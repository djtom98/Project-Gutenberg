I\r\n\r\n     MACMILLAN AND CO., LIMITED\r\n     ST. MARTIN\xe2\x80\x99S STREET LONDON\r\n     1921\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     COPYRIGHT\r\n\r\n     First published in 1886\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simplest account of the origin of _The Princess Casamassima_ is,\r\nI think, that this fiction proceeded quite directly, during the first\r\nyear of a long residence in London, from the habit and the interest of\r\nwalking the streets. I walked a great deal\xe2\x80\x94for exercise, for amusement,\r\nfor acquisition, and above all I always walked home at the evening\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nend, when the evening had been spent elsewhere, as happened more often\r\nthan not; and as to do this was to receive many impressions, so the\r\nimpressions worked and sought an issue, so the book after a time was\r\nborn. It is a fact that, as I look back, the attentive exploration\r\nof London, the assault directly made by the great city upon an\r\nimagination quick to react, fully explains a large part of it. There\r\nis a minor element that refers itself to another source, of which I\r\nshall presently speak; but the prime idea was unmistakably the ripe\r\nround fruit of perambulation. One walked of course with one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\ngreatly open, and I hasten to declare that such a practice, carried on\r\nfor a long time and over a considerable space, positively provokes,\r\nall round, a mystic solicitation, the urgent appeal, on the part of\r\neverything, to be interpreted and, so far as may be, reproduced.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSubjects\xe2\x80\x9d and situations, character and history, the tragedy and\r\ncomedy of life, are things of which the common air, in such conditions,\r\nseems pungently to taste; and to a mind curious, before the human\r\nscene, of meanings and revelations the great grey Babylon easily\r\nbecomes, on its face, a garden bristling with an immense illustrative\r\nflora. Possible stories, presentable figures, rise from the thick\r\njungle as the observer moves, fluttering up like startled game, and\r\nbefore he knows it indeed he has fairly to guard himself against the\r\nbrush of importunate wings. He goes on as with his head in a cloud of\r\nhumming presences\xe2\x80\x94especially during the younger, the initiatory time,\r\nthe fresh, the sharply-apprehensive months or years, more or less\r\nnumerous. We use our material up, we use up even the thick tribute\r\nof the London streets\xe2\x80\x94if perception and attention but sufficiently\r\nlight our steps. But I think of them as lasting, for myself, quite\r\nsufficiently long; I think of them as even still\xe2\x80\x94dreadfully changed\r\nfor the worse in respect to any romantic idea as I find them\xe2\x80\x94breaking\r\nout on occasion into eloquence, throwing out deep notes from their vast\r\nvague murmur.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment at any rate when they offered me no image more vivid\r\nthan that of some individual sensitive nature or fine mind, some small\r\nobscure intelligent creature whose education should have been almost\r\nwholly derived from them, capable of profiting by all the civilisation,\r\nall the accumulations to which they testify, yet condemned to see\r\nthese things only from outside\xe2\x80\x94in mere quickened consideration, mere\r\nwistfulness and envy and despair. It seemed to me I had only to imagine\r\nsuch a spirit intent enough and troubled enough, and to place it in\r\npresence of the comings and goings, the great gregarious company, of\r\nthe more fortunate than himself\xe2\x80\x94all on the scale on which London could\r\nshow them\xe2\x80\x94to get possession of an interesting theme. I arrived so at\r\nthe history of little Hyacinth Robinson\xe2\x80\x94he sprang up for me out of the\r\nLondon pavement. To find his possible adventure interesting I had only\r\nto conceive his watching the same public show, the same innumerable\r\nappearances, I had watched myself, and of his watching very much as\r\nI had watched; save indeed for one little difference. This difference\r\nwould be that so far as all the swarming facts should speak of freedom\r\nand ease, knowledge and power, money, opportunity and satiety, he\r\nshould be able to revolve round them but at the most respectful of\r\ndistances and with every door of approach shut in his face. For one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself, all conveniently, there had been doors that opened\xe2\x80\x94opened into\r\nlight and warmth and cheer, into good and charming relations; and if\r\nthe place as a whole lay heavy on one\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness there was yet\r\nalways for relief this implication of one\xe2\x80\x99s own lucky share of the\r\nfreedom and ease, lucky acquaintance with the number of lurking springs\r\nat light pressure of which particular vistas would begin to recede,\r\ngreat lighted, furnished, peopled galleries, sending forth gusts of\r\nagreeable sound.\r\n\r\nThat main happy sense of the picture was always there and that retreat\r\nfrom the general grimness never forbidden; whereby one\xe2\x80\x99s own relation\r\nto the mere formidable mass and weight of things was eased off and\r\nadjusted. One learned from an early period what it might be to know\r\nLondon in such a way as that\xe2\x80\x94an immense and interesting discipline, an\r\neducation on terms mostly convenient and delightful. But what would\r\nbe the effect of the other way, of having so many precious things\r\nperpetually in one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, yet of missing them all for any closer\r\nknowledge, and of the confinement of closer knowledge entirely to\r\nmatters with which a connexion, however intimate, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly\r\npass for a privilege? Truly, of course, there are London mysteries\r\n(dense categories of dark arcana) for every spectator, and it\xe2\x80\x99s in a\r\ndegree an exclusion and a state of weakness to be without experience\r\nof the meaner conditions, the lower manners and types, the general\r\nsordid struggle, the weight of the burden of labour, the ignorance, the\r\nmisery and the vice. With such matters as those my tormented young man\r\nwould have had contact\xe2\x80\x94they would have formed, fundamentally, from the\r\nfirst, his natural and immediate London. But the reward of a romantic\r\ncuriosity would be the question of what the total assault, that of\r\nthe world of his work-a-day life and the world of his divination and\r\nhis envy together, would have made of him, and what in especial he\r\nwould have made of them. As tormented, I say, I thought of him, and\r\nthat would be the point\xe2\x80\x94if one could only see him feel enough to be\r\ninteresting without his feeling so much as not to be natural.\r\n\r\nThis in fact I have ever found rather terribly the point\xe2\x80\x94that the\r\nfigures in any picture, the agents in any drama, are interesting\r\nonly in proportion as they feel their respective situations; since\r\nthe consciousness, on their part, of the complication exhibited\r\nforms for us their link of connexion with it. But there are degrees\r\nof feeling\xe2\x80\x94the muffled, the faint, the just sufficient, the barely\r\nintelligent, as we may say; and the acute, the intense, the complete,\r\nin a word\xe2\x80\x94the power to be finely aware and richly responsible. It is\r\nthose moved in this latter fashion who \xe2\x80\x9cget most\xe2\x80\x9d out of all that\r\nhappens to them and who in so doing enable us, as readers of their\r\nrecord, as participators by a fond attention, also to get most. Their\r\nbeing finely aware\xe2\x80\x94as Hamlet and Lear, say, are finely aware\xe2\x80\x94_makes_\r\nabsolutely the intensity of their adventure, gives the maximum of sense\r\nto what befalls them. We care, our curiosity and our sympathy care,\r\ncomparatively little for what happens to the stupid, the coarse and the\r\nblind; care for it, and for the effects of it, at the most as helping\r\nto precipitate what happens to the more deeply wondering, to the really\r\nsentient. Hamlet and Lear are surrounded, amid their complications, by\r\nthe stupid and the blind, who minister in all sorts of ways to their\r\nrecorded fate. Persons of markedly limited sense would, on such a\r\nprinciple as that, play a part in the career of my tormented youth; but\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be of markedly limited sense himself\xe2\x80\x94he would note as many\r\nthings and vibrate to as many occasions as I might venture to make him.\r\n\r\nThere wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, moreover, simply be the question of his suffering\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nwhich we might soon get enough; there would be the question of what,\r\nall beset and all perceptive, he should thus adventurously do, thus\r\ndream and hazard and attempt. The interest of the attitude and the act\r\nwould be the actor\xe2\x80\x99s imagination and vision of them, together with the\r\nnature and degree of their felt return upon him. So the intelligent\r\ncreature would be required and so some picture of his intelligence\r\ninvolved. The picture of an intelligence appears for the most part,\r\nit is true, a dead weight for the reader of the English novel to\r\ncarry, this reader having so often the wondrous property of caring\r\nfor the displayed tangle of human relations without caring for its\r\nintelligibility. The teller of a story is primarily, none the less,\r\nthe listener to it, the reader of it, too; and, having needed thus to\r\nmake it out, distinctly, on the crabbed page of life, to disengage it\r\nfrom the rude human character and the more or less gothic text in which\r\nit has been packed away, the very essence of his affair has been the\r\n_imputing_ of intelligence. The basis of his attention has been that\r\nsuch and such an imbroglio has got started\xe2\x80\x94on the page of life\xe2\x80\x94because\r\nof something that some one has felt and more or less understood.\r\n\r\nI recognise at the same time, and in planning _The Princess\r\nCasamassima_ felt it highly important to recognise, the danger of\r\nfilling too full any supposed and above all any obviously limited\r\nvessel of consciousness. If persons either tragically or comically\r\nembroiled with life allow us the comic or tragic value of their\r\nembroilment in proportion as their struggle is a measured and directed\r\none, it is strangely true, none the less, that beyond a certain point\r\nthey are spoiled for us by this carrying of a due light. They may carry\r\ntoo much of it for our credence, for our compassion, for our derision.\r\nThey may be shown as knowing too much and feeling too much\xe2\x80\x94not\r\ncertainly for their remaining remarkable, but for their remaining\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d and typical, for their having the needful communities with\r\nour own precious liability to fall into traps and be bewildered. It\r\nseems probable that if we were never bewildered there would never be\r\na story to tell about us; we should partake of the superior nature\r\nof the all-knowing immortals whose annals are dreadfully dull so\r\nlong as flurried humans are not, for the positive relief of bored\r\nOlympians, mixed up with them. Therefore it is that the wary reader\r\nfor the most part warns the novelist against making his characters\r\ntoo _interpretative_ of the muddle of fate, or in other words too\r\ndivinely, too priggishly clever. \xe2\x80\x9cGive us plenty of bewilderment,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthis monitor seems to say, \xe2\x80\x9cso long as there is plenty of slashing\r\nout in the bewilderment too. But don\xe2\x80\x99t, we beseech you, give us too\r\nmuch intelligence; for intelligence\xe2\x80\x94well, _endangers_; endangers not\r\nperhaps the slasher himself, but the very slashing, the subject-matter\r\nof any self-respecting story. It opens up too many considerations,\r\npossibilities, issues; it _may_ lead the slasher into dreary realms\r\nwhere slashing somehow fails and falls to the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is well reasoned on the part of the reader, who can in spite of\r\nit never have an idea\xe2\x80\x94or his earnest discriminations would come to him\r\nless easily\xe2\x80\x94of the extreme difficulty, for the painter of the human\r\nmixture, of reproducing that mixture aright. \xe2\x80\x9cGive us in the persons\r\nrepresented, the subjects of the bewilderment (that bewilderment\r\nwithout which there would be no question of an issue or of the fact\r\nof suspense, prime implications in any story), as much experience as\r\npossible, but keep down the terms in which you report that experience,\r\nbecause we only understand the very simplest\xe2\x80\x9d: such in effect are\r\nthe words in which the novelist constantly hears himself addressed,\r\nsuch the plea made him by the would-be victims of his spell on behalf\r\nof that sovereign principle the economy of interest, a principle as\r\nto which their instinct is justly strong. He listens anxiously to\r\nthe charge\xe2\x80\x94nothing can exceed his own solicitude for an economy of\r\ninterest; but feels himself all in presence of an abyss of ambiguities,\r\nthe mutual accommodations in which the reader wholly leaves to him.\r\nExperience, as I see it, is our apprehension and our measure of what\r\nhappens to us as social creatures\xe2\x80\x94any intelligent report of which\r\nhas to be based on that apprehension. The picture of the exposed and\r\nentangled state is what is required, and there are certainly always\r\nplenty of grounds for keeping down the complexities of a picture.\r\nA picture it still has to be, however, and by that condition has to\r\ndeal effectually with its subject, so that the simple device of more\r\nand more keeping down may well not see us quite to our end or even\r\nquite to our middle. One suggested way of keeping down, for instance,\r\nis not to attribute feeling, or feelings, to persons who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t in\r\nall probability have had any to speak of. The less space, within the\r\nframe of the picture, their feelings take up the more space is left for\r\ntheir doings\xe2\x80\x94a fact that may at first seem to make for a refinement of\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nAll of which is charming\xe2\x80\x94yet would be infinitely more so if here at\r\nonce ambiguity didn\xe2\x80\x99t yawn; the unreality of the sharp distinction,\r\nwhere the interest of observation is at stake, between doing and\r\nfeeling. In the immediate field of life, for action, for application,\r\nfor getting through a job, nothing may so much matter perhaps as the\r\ndescent of a suspended weight on this, that or the other spot, with\r\nall its subjective concomitants quite secondary and irrelevant. But\r\nthe affair of the painter is not the immediate, it is the reflected\r\nfield of life, the realm not of application, but of _appreciation_\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ntruth that makes our measure of effect altogether different. My report\r\nof people\xe2\x80\x99s experience\xe2\x80\x94my report as a \xe2\x80\x9cstory-teller\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is essentially my\r\nappreciation of it, and there is no \xe2\x80\x9cinterest\xe2\x80\x9d for me in what my hero,\r\nmy heroine or any one else does save through that admirable process.\r\nAs soon as I begin to appreciate simplification is imperilled: the\r\nsharply distinguished parts of any adventure, any case of endurance\r\nand performance, melt together as an appeal. I then see their \xe2\x80\x9cdoing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthat of the persons just mentioned, as, immensely, their feeling, their\r\nfeeling as their doing; since I can have none of the conveyed sense\r\nand taste of their situation without becoming intimate with them. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be intimate without that sense and taste, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate\r\nsave by intimacy, any more than I can report save by a projected\r\nlight. Intimacy with a man\xe2\x80\x99s specific behaviour, with his given case,\r\nis desperately certain to make us see it as a whole\xe2\x80\x94in which event\r\narbitrary limitations of our vision lose whatever beauty they may on\r\noccasion have pretended to. What a man thinks and what he feels are the\r\nhistory and the character of what he does; on all of which things the\r\nlogic of intensity rests. Without intensity where is vividness, and\r\nwithout vividness where is presentability? If I have called the most\r\ngeneral state of one\xe2\x80\x99s most exposed and assaulted figures the state\r\nof bewilderment\xe2\x80\x94the condition for instance on which Thackeray so much\r\ninsists in the interest of _his_ exhibited careers, the condition of\r\na humble heart, a bowed head, a patient wonder, a suspended judgement,\r\nbefore the \xe2\x80\x9cawful will\xe2\x80\x9d and the mysterious decrees of Providence\xe2\x80\x94so it\r\nis rather witless to talk of merely getting rid of that displayed mode\r\nof reaction, one of the oft-encountered, one of the highly recommended,\r\ncategories of feeling.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing comes to depend thus on the _quality_ of bewilderment\r\ncharacteristic of one\xe2\x80\x99s creature, the quality involved in the\r\ngiven case or supplied by one\xe2\x80\x99s data. There are doubtless many such\r\nqualities, ranging from vague and crepuscular to sharpest and most\r\ncritical; and we have but to imagine one of these latter to see how\r\neasily\xe2\x80\x94from the moment it gets its head at all\xe2\x80\x94it may insist on playing\r\na part. There we have then at once a case of feeling, of ever so\r\nmany possible feelings, stretched across the scene like an attached\r\nthread on which the pearls of interest are strung. There are threads\r\nshorter and less tense, and I am far from implying that the minor,\r\nthe coarser and less fruitful forms and degrees of moral reaction, as\r\nwe may conveniently call it, may not yield lively results. They have\r\ntheir subordinate, comparative, illustrative human value\xe2\x80\x94that appeal\r\nof the witless which is often so penetrating. Verily even, I think, no\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstory\xe2\x80\x9d is possible without its fools\xe2\x80\x94as most of the fine painters of\r\nlife, Shakespeare, Cervantes and Balzac, Fielding, Scott, Thackeray,\r\nDickens, George Meredith, George Eliot, Jane Austen, have abundantly\r\nfelt. At the same time I confess I never see the _leading_ interest of\r\nany human hazard but in a consciousness (on the part of the moved and\r\nmoving creature) subject to fine intensification and wide enlargement.\r\nIt is as mirrored in that consciousness that the gross fools, the\r\nheadlong fools, the fatal fools play their part for us\xe2\x80\x94they have much\r\nless to show us in themselves. The troubled life mostly at the centre\r\nof our subject\xe2\x80\x94whatever our subject, for the artistic hour, happens\r\nto be\xe2\x80\x94embraces them and deals with them for its amusement and its\r\nanguish: they are apt largely indeed, on a near view, to be all the\r\ncause of its trouble. This means, exactly, that the person capable of\r\nfeeling in the given case more than another of what is to be felt for\r\nit, and so serving in the highest degree to _record_ it dramatically\r\nand objectively, is the only sort of person on whom we can count not\r\nto betray, to cheapen or, as we say, give away, the value and beauty of\r\nthe thing. By so much as the affair matters _for_ some such individual,\r\nby so much do we get the best there is of it, and by so much as it\r\nfalls within the scope of a denser and duller, a more vulgar and more\r\nshallow capacity, do we get a picture dim and meagre.\r\n\r\nThe great chroniclers have clearly always been aware of this; they have\r\nat least always either placed a mind of some sort\xe2\x80\x94in the sense of a\r\nreflecting and colouring medium\xe2\x80\x94in possession of the general adventure\r\n(when the latter has not been purely epic, as with Scott, say, as with\r\nold Dumas and with Zola); or else paid signally, as to the interest\r\ncreated, for their failure to do so. We may note, moreover, in passing\r\nthat this failure is in almost no case intentional or part of a plan,\r\nbut has sprung from their limited curiosity, their short conception\r\nof the particular sensibility projected. Edgar of Ravenswood for\r\ninstance, visited by the tragic tempest of _The Bride of Lammermoor_,\r\nhas a black cloak and hat and feathers more than he has a mind; just\r\nas Hamlet, while equally sabled and draped and plumed, while at least\r\nequally romantic, has yet a mind still more than he has a costume. The\r\nsituation represented is that Ravenswood loves Lucy Ashton through\r\ndire difficulty and danger, and that she in the same way loves him;\r\nbut the relation so created between them is by this neglect of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfeeling\xe2\x80\x9d question never shown us as primarily taking place. It is\r\nshown only in its secondary, its confused and disfigured aspects\xe2\x80\x94where,\r\nhowever, luckily, it is presented with great romantic good faith.\r\nThe thing has nevertheless paid for its deviation, as I say, by a\r\nsacrifice of intensity; the centre of the subject is empty and the\r\ndevelopment pushed off, all round, toward the frame\xe2\x80\x94which is, so to\r\nspeak, beautifully rich and curious. But I mention that relation to\r\neach other of the appearances in a particular work only as a striking\r\nnegative case; there are in the connexion I have glanced at plenty\r\nof striking positive ones. It is very true that Fielding\xe2\x80\x99s hero in\r\n_Tom Jones_ is but as \xe2\x80\x9cfinely,\xe2\x80\x9d that is but as intimately, bewildered\r\nas a young man of great health and spirits may be when he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ngrain of imagination: the point to be made is, at all events, that his\r\nsense of bewilderment obtains altogether on the comic, never on the\r\ntragic plane. He has so much \xe2\x80\x9clife\xe2\x80\x9d that it amounts, for the effect of\r\ncomedy and application of satire, almost to his having a mind, that is\r\nto his having reactions and a full consciousness; besides which his\r\nauthor\xe2\x80\x94_he_ handsomely possessed of a mind\xe2\x80\x94has such an amplitude of\r\nreflexion for him and round him that we see him through the mellow air\r\nof Fielding\xe2\x80\x99s fine old moralism, fine old humour and fine old style,\r\nwhich somehow really enlarge, make every one and every thing important.\r\n\r\nAll of which furthers my remarking how much I have been interested, on\r\nreading _The Princess Casamassima_ over, to recognise my sense, sharp\r\nfrom far back, that clearness and concreteness constantly depend, for\r\nany pictorial whole, on some _concentrated_ individual notation of\r\nthem. That notation goes forward here in the mind of little Hyacinth,\r\nimmensely quickened by the fact of its so mattering to his very life\r\nwhat he does make of things: which passion of intelligence is, as I\r\nhave already hinted, precisely his highest value for our curiosity and\r\nour sympathy. Yet if his highest it is not at all his only one, since\r\nthe truth for \xe2\x80\x9ca young man in a book\xe2\x80\x9d by no means entirely resides\r\nin his being either exquisitely sensitive or shiningly clever. It\r\nresides in some such measure of these things as may consort with the\r\nfine measure of other things too\xe2\x80\x94with that of the other faces of his\r\nsituation and character. If he\xe2\x80\x99s too sensitive and too clever for\r\n_them_, if he knows more than is likely or natural\xe2\x80\x94for _him_\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nif he weren\xe2\x80\x99t at all, as if he were false and impossible. Extreme and\r\nattaching always the difficulty of fixing at a hundred points the place\r\nwhere one\xe2\x80\x99s impelled _bonhomme_ may feel enough and \xe2\x80\x9cknow\xe2\x80\x9d enough\xe2\x80\x94or be\r\nin the way of learning enough\xe2\x80\x94for his maximum dramatic value without\r\nfeeling and knowing too much for his minimum verisimilitude, his\r\nproper fusion with the fable. This is the charming, the tormenting, the\r\neternal little matter _to be made right_, in all the weaving of silver\r\nthreads and tapping on golden nails; and I should take perhaps too\r\nfantastic a comfort\xe2\x80\x94I mean were not the comforts of the artist just of\r\nthe raw essence of fantasy\xe2\x80\x94in any glimpse of such achieved rightnesses,\r\nwhether in my own work or that of others. In no work whatever,\r\ndoubtless, are they the felicities the most frequent; but they have so\r\ninherent a price that even the traceable attempt at them, wherever met,\r\nsheds, I think, a fine influence about.\r\n\r\nI have, for example, a weakness of sympathy with that constant effort\r\nof George Eliot\xe2\x80\x99s which plays through Adam Bede and Felix Holt and Tito\r\nMelema, through Daniel Deronda and through Lydgate in _Middlemarch_,\r\nthrough Maggie Tulliver, through Romola, through Dorothea Brooke\r\nand Gwendolen Harleth; the effort to show their adventures and\r\ntheir history\xe2\x80\x94the author\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter all\xe2\x80\x94as determined by their\r\nfeelings and the nature of their minds. Their emotions, their stirred\r\nintelligence, their moral consciousness, become thus, by sufficiently\r\ncharmed perusal, our own very adventure. The creator of Deronda and of\r\nRomola is charged, I know, with having on occasion\xe2\x80\x94as in dealing with\r\nthose very celebrities themselves\xe2\x80\x94left the figure, the concrete man\r\nand woman, too abstract by reason of the quantity of soul employed;\r\nbut such mischances, where imagination and humour still keep them\r\ncompany, often have an interest that is wanting to agitations of the\r\nmere surface or to those that may be only taken for granted. I should\r\neven like to give myself the pleasure of retracing from one of my own\r\nproductions to another the play of a like instinctive disposition,\r\nof catching in the fact, at one point after another, from _Roderick\r\nHudson_ to _The Golden Bowl_, that provision for interest which\r\nconsists in placing advantageously, placing right in the middle of the\r\nlight, the most polished of possible mirrors of the subject. Rowland\r\nMallet, in _Roderick Hudson_, is exactly such a mirror, not a bit\r\nautobiographic or formally \xe2\x80\x9cfirst person\xe2\x80\x9d though he be, and I might\r\nexemplify the case through a long list, through the nature of such\r\na \xe2\x80\x9cmind\xe2\x80\x9d even as the all-objective Newman in _The American_, through\r\nthe thickly-peopled imagination of Isabel Archer in _The Portrait of a\r\nLady_ (her imagination positively the deepest depth of her imbroglio)\r\ndown to such unmistakable examples as that of Merton Densher in _The\r\nWings of the Dove_, that of Lambert Strether in _The Ambassadors_\r\n(_he_ a mirror verily of miraculous silver and quite pre-eminent, I\r\nthink, for the connexion), and that of the Prince in the first half\r\nand that of the Princess in the second half of _The Golden Bowl_. I\r\nshould note the extent to which these persons are, so far as their\r\nother passions permit, intense _perceivers_, all, of their respective\r\npredicaments, and I should go on from them to fifty other examples;\r\neven to the divided Vanderbank of _The Awkward Age_, the extreme pinch\r\nof whose romance is the vivacity in him, to his positive sorrow and\r\nloss, of the state of being aware; even to scanted Fleda Vetch in _The\r\nSpoils of Poynton_, through whose own delicate vision of everything\r\nso little of the human value of her situation is wasted for us; even\r\nto the small recording governess confronted with the horrors of _The\r\nTurn of the Screw_, and to the innocent child patching together all\r\nineffectually those of _What Maisie Knew_; even in short, since I may\r\nname so few cases, to the disaffected guardian of an overgrown legend\r\nin _The Birthplace_, to the luckless fine artist of _The Next Time_,\r\ntrying to despoil himself, for a \xe2\x80\x9chit\xe2\x80\x9d and bread and butter, of his\r\nfatal fineness, to blunt the tips of his intellectual fingers, and to\r\nthe hapless butler Brooksmith, ruined by good talk, disqualified for\r\ncommon domestic service by the beautiful growth of his habit of quiet\r\nattention, his faculty of appreciation. But though this demonstration\r\nof a rooted vice\xe2\x80\x94since a vice it would appear mainly accounted\xe2\x80\x94might\r\nyield amusement, the examples referred to must await their turn.\r\n\r\nI had had for a long time well before me, at any rate, my small obscure\r\nbut ardent observer of the \xe2\x80\x9cLondon world,\xe2\x80\x9d saw him roam and wonder\r\nand yearn, saw all the unanswered questions and baffled passions\r\nthat might ferment in him\xe2\x80\x94once he should be made both sufficiently\r\nthoughtful and sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cdisinherited\xe2\x80\x9d; but this image, however\r\ninteresting, was of course not by itself a progression, an action,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t by itself make a drama. I got my action, however\xe2\x80\x94failing which\r\none has nothing\xe2\x80\x94under the prompt sense that the state of feeling I was\r\nconcerned with might develop and beget another state, might return at\r\na given moment, and with the greatest vivacity, on itself. To see this\r\nwas really to feel one\xe2\x80\x99s subject swim into one\xe2\x80\x99s ken, especially after\r\na certain other ingenious connexion had been made for it. I find myself\r\nagain recalling, and with the possible \xe2\x80\x9cfun\xe2\x80\x9d of it reviving too, how\r\nI recognised, as revealed and prescribed, the particular complexion,\r\nprofession and other conditions of my little presumptuous adventurer,\r\nwith his combination of intrinsic fineness and fortuitous adversity,\r\nhis small cluster of \xe2\x80\x9cdingy\xe2\x80\x9d London associations and the swelling\r\nspirit in him which was to be the field of his strange experience.\r\nAccessible through his imagination, as I have hinted, to a thousand\r\nprovocations and intimations, he would become most acquainted with\r\ndestiny in the form of a lively inward revolution. His being jealous of\r\nall the ease of life of which he tastes so little, and, bitten, under\r\nthis exasperation, with an aggressive, vindictive, destructive social\r\nfaith, his turning to \xe2\x80\x9ctreasons, stratagems and spoils\xe2\x80\x9d might be as\r\nvivid a picture as one chose, but would move to pity and terror only by\r\nthe aid of some deeper complication, some imposed and formidable issue.\r\n\r\nThe complication most interesting then would be that he should fall\r\nin love with the beauty of the world, actual order and all, at the\r\nmoment of his most feeling and most hating the famous \xe2\x80\x9ciniquity of\r\nits social arrangements\xe2\x80\x9d; so that his position as an irreconcilable\r\npledged enemy to it, thus rendered false by something more personal\r\nthan his opinions and his vows, becomes the sharpest of his torments.\r\nTo make it a torment that really matters, however, he must have got\r\npractically involved, specifically committed to the stand he has,\r\nunder the pressure of more knowledge, found impossible; out of which\r\nhas come for him the deep dilemma of the disillusioned and repentant\r\nconspirator. He has thrown himself into the more than \xe2\x80\x9cshady\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nunderworld of militant socialism, he has undertaken to play a part\xe2\x80\x94a\r\npart that with the drop of his exasperation and the growth, simply\r\nexpressed, of his taste, is out of all tune with his passion, at any\r\ncost, for life itself, the life, whatever it be, that surrounds him.\r\nDabbling deeply in revolutionary politics of a hole-and-corner sort,\r\nhe would be \xe2\x80\x9cin\xe2\x80\x9d up to his neck, and with that precarious part of him\r\nparticularly involved, so that his tergiversation is the climax of\r\nhis adventure. What was essential with this was that he should have a\r\nsocial\xe2\x80\x94not less than a socialist\xe2\x80\x94connexion, find a door somehow open\r\nto him into the appeased and civilised state, into that warmer glow of\r\nthings he is precisely to help to undermine. To look for this necessary\r\nconnexion was for me to meet it suddenly in the form of that extremely\r\n_disponible_ figure of Christina Light whom I had ten years before\r\nfound left on my hands at the conclusion of _Roderick Hudson_. She had\r\nfor so long, in the vague limbo of those ghosts we have conjured but\r\nnot exorcised, been looking for a situation, awaiting a niche and a\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nI shall not pretend to trace the steps and stages by which the\r\nimputability of a future to that young woman\xe2\x80\x94which was like the act of\r\nclothing her chilled and patient nakedness\xe2\x80\x94had for its prime effect\r\nto plant her in my little bookbinder\xe2\x80\x99s path. Nothing would doubtless\r\nbeckon us on further, with a large leisure, than such a chance to study\r\nthe obscure law under which certain of a novelist\xe2\x80\x99s characters, more or\r\nless honourably buried, revive for him by a force or a whim of their\r\nown and \xe2\x80\x9cwalk\xe2\x80\x9d round his house of art like haunting ghosts, feeling\r\nfor the old doors they knew, fumbling at stiff latches and pressing\r\ntheir pale faces, in the outer dark, to lighted windows. I mistrust\r\nthem, I confess, in general; my sense of a really expressed character\r\nis that it shall have originally so tasted of the ordeal of service\r\nas to feel no disposition to yield again to the strain. Why should\r\nthe Princess of the climax of _Roderick Hudson_ still have made her\r\ndesire felt, unless in fact to testify that she had not been\xe2\x80\x94for what\r\nshe was\xe2\x80\x94completely recorded? To continue in evidence, that had struck\r\nme from far back as her natural passion; in evidence at any price, not\r\nconsenting to be laid away with folded hands in the pasteboard tomb,\r\nthe doll\xe2\x80\x99s box, to which we usually relegate the spent puppet after the\r\nfashion of a recumbent worthy on the slab of a sepulchral monument. I\r\nwas to see this, after all, in the event, as the fruit of a restless\r\nvanity: Christina had felt herself, known herself, striking, in the\r\nearlier connexion, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resign herself not to strike again.\r\nHer pressure then was not to be resisted\xe2\x80\x94sharply as the question might\r\ncome up of why she should pretend to strike just _there_. I shall not\r\nattempt to answer it with reasons (one can never tell everything); it\r\nwas enough that I could recognise her claim to have travelled far\xe2\x80\x94far\r\nfrom where I had last left her: that, one felt, was in character\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwas what she naturally _would_ have done. Her prime note had been\r\nan aversion to the _banal_, and nothing could be of an effect less\r\n_banal_, I judged, than her intervention in the life of a dingy little\r\nLondon bookbinder whose sensibility, whose flow of opinions on \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\r\nquestions\xe2\x80\x9d in especial, should have been poisoned at the source.\r\n\r\nShe would be world-weary\xe2\x80\x94that was another of her notes; and the\r\nextravagance of her attitude in these new relations would have its root\r\nand its apparent logic in her need to feel freshly about something or\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94it might scarce matter what. She can, or she believes she can,\r\nfeel freshly about the \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\xe2\x80\x9d and their wrongs and their sorrows\r\nand their perpetual smothered ferment; for these things are furthest\r\nremoved from those others among which she has hitherto tried to make\r\nher life. That was to a certainty where I was to have looked for\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94quite _off_ and away (once granted the wisdom of listening to her\r\nanew at all): therefore Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s encounter with her could pass for\r\nnatural, and it was fortunately to be noted that she was to serve for\r\nhis experience in quite another and a more \xe2\x80\x9cleading\xe2\x80\x9d sense than any\r\nin which he was to serve for hers. I confess I was not averse\xe2\x80\x94such are\r\nthe possible weaknesses of the artist in face of high difficulties\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nfeeling that if his appearance of consistency were obtained I might\r\nat least try to remain comparatively at my ease about hers. I may add,\r\nmoreover, that the resuscitation of Christina (and, on the minor scale,\r\nof the Prince and of Madame Grandoni) put in a strong light for me the\r\nwhole question, for the romancer, of \xe2\x80\x9cgoing on with a character\xe2\x80\x9d: as\r\nBalzac first of all systematically went on, as Thackeray, as Trollope,\r\nas Zola all more or less ingeniously went on. I was to find no small\r\nsavour in the reflexions so precipitated; though I may treat myself\r\nhere only to this remark about them\xe2\x80\x94that the revivalist impulse on the\r\nfond writer\xe2\x80\x99s part strikes me as one thing, a charmingly conceivable\r\nthing, but the effect of a free indulgence in it (effect, that is,\r\non the nerves of the reader) as, for twenty rather ineffable reasons,\r\nquite another.\r\n\r\nI remember at any rate feeling myself all in possession of little\r\nHyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s consistency, as I have called it, down at Dover during\r\ncertain weeks that were none too remotely precedent to the autumn\r\nof 1885 and the appearance, in the _Atlantic Monthly_ again, of\r\nthe first chapters of the story. There were certain sunny, breezy,\r\nbalconied rooms at the quieter end of the Esplanade of that cheerful\r\ncastle-crested little town\xe2\x80\x94now infinitely perturbed by gigantic\r\n\xe2\x80\x9charbour works,\xe2\x80\x9d but then only faded and over-soldiered and all\r\npleasantly and humbly submissive to the law that snubs in due course\r\nthe presumption of flourishing resorts\xe2\x80\x94to which I had already more\r\nthan once had recourse in hours of quickened industry and which, though\r\nmuch else has been swept away, still archaically exist. To have lately\r\nnoted this again from the old benched and asphalted walk by the sea,\r\nthe twinkling Channel beyond which on occasion the opposite coast of\r\nFrance used to gleam as an incident of the charming tendency of the\r\nwhole prospect (immediate picture and fond design alike) amusingly\r\nto _shine_, was somehow to taste afresh, and with a certain surprise,\r\nthe odd quality of that original confidence that the parts of my plan\r\n_would_ somehow hang together. I may wonder at my confidence now\xe2\x80\x94given\r\nthe extreme, the very particular truth and \xe2\x80\x9cauthority\xe2\x80\x9d required at\r\nso many points; but to wonder is to live back gratefully into the\r\nfiner reasons of things, with all the detail of harsh application and\r\nfriction (that there must have been) quite happily blurred and dim. The\r\nfinest of reasons\xe2\x80\x94I mean for the sublime confidence I speak of\xe2\x80\x94was that\r\nI felt in full _personal_ possession of my matter; this really seemed\r\nthe fruit of direct experience. My scheme called for the suggested\r\nnearness (to all our apparently ordered life) of some sinister anarchic\r\nunderworld, heaving in its pain, its power and its hate; a presentation\r\nnot of sharp particulars, but of loose appearances, vague motions and\r\nsounds and symptoms, just perceptible presences and general looming\r\npossibilities. To have adopted the scheme was to have had to meet the\r\nquestion of one\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnotes,\xe2\x80\x9d over the whole ground, the question of what,\r\nin such directions, one had \xe2\x80\x9cgone into\xe2\x80\x9d and how far one had gone; and\r\nto have answered that question\xe2\x80\x94to one\xe2\x80\x99s own satisfaction at least\xe2\x80\x94was\r\ntruly to see one\xe2\x80\x99s way.\r\n\r\nMy notes then, on the much-mixed world of my hero\xe2\x80\x99s both overt and\r\ncovert consciousness, were exactly my gathered impressions and stirred\r\nperceptions, the deposit in my working imagination of all my visual\r\nand all my constructive sense of London. The very plan of my book\r\nhad in fact directly confronted me with the rich principle of the\r\nNote, and was to do much to clear up, once for all, my practical\r\nview of it. If one was to undertake to tell tales and to report with\r\ntruth on the human scene, it could be but because \xe2\x80\x9cnotes\xe2\x80\x9d had been\r\nfrom the cradle the ineluctable consequence of one\xe2\x80\x99s greatest inward\r\nenergy: to take them was as natural as to look, to think, to feel,\r\nto recognise, to remember, as to perform any act of understanding.\r\nThe play of the energy had been continuous and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t change; what\r\nchanged was only the objects and situations pressing the spring of\r\nit. Notes had been, in other words, the things one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t _not_\r\ntake, and the prime result of all fresh experience was to remind one\r\nof that. I have endeavoured to characterise the peremptory fashion\r\nin which my fresh experience of London\xe2\x80\x94the London of the habitual\r\nobserver, the preoccupied painter, the pedestrian prowler\xe2\x80\x94reminded me;\r\nan admonition that represented, I think, the sum of my investigations.\r\nI recall pulling no wires, knocking at no closed doors, applying for\r\nno \xe2\x80\x9cauthentic\xe2\x80\x9d information; but I recall also on the other hand the\r\npractice of never missing an opportunity to add a drop, however small,\r\nto the bucket of my impressions or to renew my sense of being able to\r\ndip into it. To haunt the great city and by this habit to penetrate it,\r\nimaginatively, in as many places as possible\xe2\x80\x94_that_ was to be informed,\r\n_that_ was to pull wires, _that_ was to open doors, _that_ positively\r\nwas to groan at times under the weight of one\xe2\x80\x99s accumulations.\r\n\r\nFace to face with the idea of Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s subterraneous politics and\r\noccult affiliations, I recollect perfectly feeling, in short, that I\r\nmight well be ashamed if, with my advantages\xe2\x80\x94and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a street,\r\na corner, an hour, of London that was not an advantage\xe2\x80\x94I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nable to piece together a proper semblance of those things, as indeed\r\na proper semblance of all the odd parts of his life. There was always\r\nof course the chance that the propriety might be challenged\xe2\x80\x94challenged\r\nby readers of a knowledge greater than mine. Yet knowledge, after all,\r\nof what? My vision of the aspects I more or less fortunately rendered\r\n_was_, exactly, my knowledge. If I made my appearances live, what was\r\nthis but the utmost one could do with them? Let me at the same time not\r\ndeny that, in answer to probable ironic reflexions on the full licence\r\nfor sketchiness and vagueness and dimness taken indeed by my picture,\r\nI had to bethink myself in advance of a defence of my \xe2\x80\x9cartistic\r\nposition.\xe2\x80\x9d Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I find it in the happy contention that the value\r\nI wished most to render and the effect I wished most to produce were\r\nprecisely those of our not knowing, of society\xe2\x80\x99s not knowing, but\r\nonly guessing and suspecting and trying to ignore, what \xe2\x80\x9cgoes on\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nirreconcilably, subversively, beneath the vast smug surface? I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeal with that positive quantity for itself\xe2\x80\x94my subject had another too\r\nexacting side; but I might perhaps show the social ear as on occasion\r\napplied to the ground, or catch some gust of the hot breath that I had\r\nat many an hour seemed to see escape and hover. What it all came back\r\nto was, no doubt, something like _this_ wisdom\xe2\x80\x94that if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t, for\r\nfiction, the root of the matter in you, haven\xe2\x80\x99t the sense of life and\r\nthe penetrating imagination, you are a fool in the very presence of the\r\nrevealed and assured; but that if you _are_ so armed you are not really\r\nhelpless, not without your resource, even before mysteries abysmal.\r\n\r\nHENRY JAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIRST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I daresay I can find the child, if you would like to see\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent said; she had a fluttered wish to assent to every\r\nsuggestion made by her visitor, whom she regarded as a high and rather\r\nterrible personage. To look for the little boy she came out of her\r\nsmall parlour, which she had been ashamed to exhibit in so untidy a\r\nstate, with paper \xe2\x80\x9cpatterns\xe2\x80\x9d lying about on the furniture and snippings\r\nof stuff scattered over the carpet\xe2\x80\x94she came out of this somewhat\r\nstuffy sanctuary, dedicated at once to social intercourse and to the\r\ningenious art to which her life had been devoted, and, opening the\r\nhouse-door, turned her eyes up and down the little street. It would\r\npresently be tea-time, and she knew that at that solemn hour Hyacinth\r\nnarrowed the circle of his wanderings. She was anxious and impatient\r\nand in a fever of excitement and complacency, not wanting to keep Mrs.\r\nBowerbank waiting, though she sat there, heavily and consideringly, as\r\nif she meant to stay; and wondering not a little whether the object\r\nof her quest would have a dirty face. Mrs. Bowerbank had intimated\r\nso definitely that she thought it remarkable on Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s part\r\nto have taken care of him gratuitously for so many years, that the\r\nhumble dressmaker, whose imagination took flights about every one but\r\nherself and who had never been conscious of an exemplary benevolence,\r\nsuddenly aspired to appear, throughout, as devoted to the child as\r\nshe had struck her large, grave guest as being, and felt how much\r\nshe should like him to come in fresh and frank and looking as pretty\r\nas he sometimes did. Miss Pynsent, who blinked confusedly as she\r\nsurveyed the outer prospect, was very much flushed, partly with the\r\nagitation of what Mrs. Bowerbank had told her and partly because, when\r\nshe offered that lady a drop of refreshment at the end of so long\r\nan expedition, she had said she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of touching anything\r\nunless Miss Pynsent would keep her company. The \xe2\x80\x9ccheffoneer,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nAmanda was always careful to call it, yielded up a small bottle which,\r\nformerly containing eau-de-cologne, now exhibited half a pint of a\r\nrich gold-coloured liquid. Miss Pynsent was very delicate; she lived\r\non tea and watercress and kept the little bottle in the cheffoneer\r\nonly for great emergencies. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like hot brandy and water with a\r\nlump or two of sugar, but she partook of half a tumbler on the present\r\noccasion, which was of a highly exceptional kind. At this time of day\r\nthe boy was often planted in front of the little sweet-shop on the\r\nother side of the street, an establishment where periodical literature,\r\nas well as tough toffy and hard lollipops, was dispensed and where\r\nsong-books and pictorial sheets were attractively exhibited in the\r\nsmall-paned dirty window. He used to stand there for half an hour at\r\na time and spell out the first page of the romances in the _Family\r\nHerald_ and the _London Journal_, where he particularly admired the\r\nobligatory illustration in which the noble characters (they were always\r\nof the highest birth) were presented to the carnal eye. When he had\r\na penny he spent only a fraction of it on stale sugar-candy; for the\r\nremaining halfpenny he always bought a ballad with a vivid woodcut at\r\nthe top. Now, however, he was not at his post of contemplation, nor was\r\nhe visible anywhere to Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s impatient glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMillicent \xe2\x80\x99Enning, tell me quickly, have you seen my child?\xe2\x80\x9d These\r\nwords were addressed by Miss Pynsent to a little girl who sat on\r\nthe doorstep of the adjacent house nursing a dingy doll and whose\r\nextraordinary luxuriance of dark brown hair was surmounted by a torn\r\nstraw hat.\r\n\r\nThe child looked up from her dandling and patting and, after a stare\r\nof which the blankness was visibly overdone, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cLaw no, Miss\r\nPynsent, I never see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you always messing about with him, you naughty little girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe dressmaker returned with sharpness. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he round the corner,\r\nplaying marbles or\xe2\x80\x94or some jumping game?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent went on, trying\r\nto be suggestive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure _you_ he never plays nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Millicent Henning with\r\na mature manner which she bore out by adding: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I\r\nshould be called naughty, neither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you want to be called good please go find him and tell him\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a lady come here on purpose to see him this very instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMiss Pynsent waited a moment to see if her injunction would be obeyed,\r\nbut she got no satisfaction beyond another gaze of deliberation, which\r\nmade her feel that the child\xe2\x80\x99s perversity was as great as the beauty,\r\nsomewhat soiled and dimmed, of her insolent little face. She turned\r\nback into the house with an exclamation of despair, and as soon as\r\nshe had disappeared Millicent Henning sprang erect and began to race\r\ndown the street in the direction of another, which crossed it. I take\r\nno unfair advantage of the innocence of childhood in saying that the\r\nmotive of this young lady\xe2\x80\x99s flight was not a desire to be agreeable to\r\nMiss Pynsent, but an extreme curiosity on the subject of the visitor\r\nwho wanted to see Hyacinth Robinson. She wished to participate, if\r\nonly in imagination, in the interview that might take place, and she\r\nwas moved also by a quick revival of friendly feeling for the boy,\r\nfrom whom she had parted only half an hour before with considerable\r\nasperity. She was not a very clinging little creature, and there was no\r\none in her own domestic circle to whom she was much attached; but she\r\nliked to kiss Hyacinth when he didn\xe2\x80\x99t push her away and tell her she\r\nwas hateful. It was in this action and epithet he had indulged half an\r\nhour ago; but she had reflected rapidly (while she made play with Miss\r\nPynsent) that it was the worst he had ever done. Millicent Henning was\r\nonly eight years of age, but she knew there was worse in the world than\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bowerbank, in a leisurely, roundabout way, wandered off to her\r\nsister, Mrs. Chipperfield, whom she had come into that part of the\r\nworld to see, and the whole history of the dropsical tendencies of\r\nwhose husband, an undertaker with a business that had been a blessing\r\nbecause you could always count on it, she unfolded to Miss Pynsent\r\nbetween the sips of a second glass. She was a high-shouldered, towering\r\nwoman, and suggested squareness as well as a pervasion of the upper\r\nair, so that Amanda reflected that she must be very difficult to fit,\r\nand had a sinking at the idea of the number of pins she would take.\r\nHer sister had nine children and she herself had seven, the eldest of\r\nwhom she left in charge of the others when she went to her service. She\r\nwas on duty at the prison only during the day; she had to be there at\r\nseven in the morning, but she got her evenings at home, quite regular\r\nand comfortable. Miss Pynsent thought it wonderful she could talk of\r\ncomfort in such a life as that, but could easily imagine she should be\r\nglad to get away at night, for at that time the place must be much more\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd aren\xe2\x80\x99t you frightened of them\xe2\x80\x94ever?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, looking up at\r\nher visitor with her little heated face.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bowerbank, who was very slow, considered her so long before\r\nreplying that she felt herself to be, to an alarming degree, in the\r\neye of the law; for who could be more closely connected with the\r\nadministration of justice than a female turnkey, especially so big and\r\nmajestic a one? \xe2\x80\x9cI expect they\xe2\x80\x99re more frightened of me,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared\r\nat last; and it was an idea into which Miss Pynsent could easily enter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at night I suppose they rave quite awful,\xe2\x80\x9d the little dressmaker\r\nsuggested, feeling vaguely that prisons and madhouses came very much to\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if they do we hush \xe2\x80\x99em up,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bowerbank remarked rather\r\nportentously; while Miss Pynsent fidgeted to the door again, without\r\nresults, to see if the child had become visible. She observed to her\r\nguest that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it anything but contrary that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nturn up when he knew so well, most days in the week, when his tea was\r\nready. To which Mrs. Bowerbank rejoined, fixing her companion again\r\nwith the steady orb of justice: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do he have his tea that way by\r\nhimself, like a real little gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I try to give it to him tidy-like, at a suitable hour,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Pynsent guiltily. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there might be some who would say that, for\r\nthe matter of that, he is a real little gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with an\r\neffort at mitigation which, as she immediately became conscious, only\r\ninvolved her more deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are people silly enough to say anything. If it\xe2\x80\x99s your parents\r\nthat settle your station the child hasn\xe2\x80\x99t much to be thankful for,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs. Bowerbank went on in the manner of a woman accustomed to looking\r\nfacts in the face.\r\n\r\nMiss Pynsent was very timid, but she adored the aristocracy, and there\r\nwere elements in the boy\xe2\x80\x99s life which she was not prepared to sacrifice\r\neven to a person who represented such a possibility of grating bolts\r\nand clanking chains. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to forget that his father\r\nwas very high,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested appealingly and with a tight clasp of her\r\nhands in her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis father? Who knows who he was? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t set up for having a\r\nfather, does he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, surely, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it proved that Lord Frederick\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear woman, nothing was proved except that she stabbed his lordship\r\nin the back with a very long knife, that he died of the blow, and that\r\nshe got the full sentence. What does such a piece as that know about\r\nfathers? The less said about the poor child\xe2\x80\x99s ancestors the better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis view of the case caused Miss Pynsent fairly to gasp, for it\r\npushed over with a touch a tall fond fantastic structure that she had\r\nbeen piling up for years. Even as she heard it crash around her she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forbear the attempt to save at least some of the material.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally\xe2\x80\x94really,\xe2\x80\x9d she panted, \xe2\x80\x9cshe never had to do with any one but the\r\nnobility!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bowerbank surveyed her hostess with an expressionless eye. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ndear young lady, what does a respectable little body like you, that\r\nsits all day with her needle and scissors, know about the doings of\r\na wicked low foreigner of the sort that carries a knife? I was there\r\nwhen she came in and I know to what she had sunk. Her conversation was\r\nchoice, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s very dreadful, and of course I know nothing in particular,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMiss Pynsent quavered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t low when I worked at the same\r\nplace with her, and she often told me she would do nothing for any one\r\nthat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at the very top.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe might have talked to you of something that would have done you\r\nboth more good,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bowerbank remarked, while the dressmaker felt\r\nrebuked in the past as well as in the present. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the very top, poor\r\nthing! Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s at the very bottom now. If she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t low when she\r\nworked, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity she didn\xe2\x80\x99t stick to her work; and as for pride\r\nof birth, that\xe2\x80\x99s an article I recommend your young friend to leave to\r\nothers. You had better believe what I say, because I\xe2\x80\x99m a woman of the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed she was, as Miss Pynsent felt, to whom all this was very\r\nterrible, letting in the cold light of the penal system on a dear,\r\ndim little theory. She had cared for the child because maternity\r\nwas in her nature and this was the only manner in which fortune had\r\nput it in her path to become a mother. She had had herself as few\r\nbelongings as the desolate baby, and it had seemed to her he would\r\nadd to her importance in the little world of Lomax Place (if she kept\r\nit a secret how she came by him) quite in the proportion in which she\r\nshould contribute to his maintenance. Her own isolation went out to\r\nhis, and in the course of time their associated solitude was peopled\r\nby the dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s romantic mind with a hundred consoling evocations.\r\nThe boy proved neither a dunce nor a reprobate; but what endeared him\r\nto her most was her conviction that he belonged, \xe2\x80\x9cby the left hand,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas she had read in a novel, to a proud and ancient race, the list of\r\nwhose representatives and the record of whose alliances she had once\r\n(when she took home some work and was made to wait, alone, in a lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboudoir) had the opportunity of reading in a fat red book, eagerly\r\nand tremblingly consulted. She bent her head before Mrs. Bowerbank\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noverwhelming logic, but she felt in her heart that she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nthe child up for mere words she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer\xe2\x80\x94of course she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanswer them\xe2\x80\x94that she believed in him still, and that she recognised\r\nas distinctly as she revered the quality of her betters. To believe in\r\nHyacinth, for Miss Pynsent, was to believe that he _was_ the son of the\r\nextremely immoral Lord Frederick. She had from his earliest age made\r\nhim feel that there was a grandeur in his past, and as Mrs. Bowerbank\r\nwould be sure not to approve of such aberrations she prayed she might\r\nnot be questioned on that part of the business. It was not that when\r\nit was necessary the little dressmaker had any scruple about using\r\nthe arts of prevarication; she was a kind and innocent creature, but\r\nshe told fibs as freely as she applied trimmings. She had, however,\r\nnot yet been questioned by an emissary of the law, and her heart beat\r\nfaster when Mrs. Bowerbank said to her in deep tones, with an effect of\r\nabruptness: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray, Miss Pynsent, does the innocent child know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow about Lord Frederick?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent palpitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother Lord Frederick! Know about his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never told him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut has any one else told him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this inquiry Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s answer was more prompt and more proud;\r\nit was with an agreeable sense of having conducted herself with\r\nextraordinary wisdom and propriety that she replied: \xe2\x80\x9cHow could any one\r\nknow? I\xe2\x80\x99ve never breathed it to a creature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bowerbank gave utterance to no commendation; she only put down\r\nher empty glass and wiped her large mouth with much thoroughness and\r\njudgement. Then she said, as if it were as cheerful an idea as, in the\r\npremises, she was capable of expressing: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be plenty\r\nlater on to give him all information!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray God he may live and die without knowing it!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent cried\r\nwith intensity.\r\n\r\nHer companion gazed at her with a kind of professional patience. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t keep your ideas together. How can he go to her then, if he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnever to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, did you mean she\xe2\x80\x99d tell him?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent plaintively gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him! He won\xe2\x80\x99t need to be told, once she gets hold of him and\r\ngives him\xe2\x80\x94what she mentioned to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat she mentioned\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent repeated, open-eyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe kiss her lips have been famished for all these years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor desolate woman!\xe2\x80\x9d the little dressmaker murmured while her\r\npity gushed up again. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course he\xe2\x80\x99ll see she\xe2\x80\x99s fond of him,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\npursued simply. Then she added with an inspiration more brilliant: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nmight tell him she\xe2\x80\x99s his aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may tell him she\xe2\x80\x99s his grandmother if you like. But it\xe2\x80\x99s all in\r\nthe family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, on that side,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Pynsent musingly and irrepressibly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwill she speak that fluent French?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired as from a full mind.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case he won\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a child will understand its own mother, whatever she speaks,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBowerbank returned, declining to administer a superficial comfort.\r\nBut she subjoined, opening the door for escape from a prospect which\r\nbristled with dangers: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it\xe2\x80\x99s just according to your own idea.\r\nYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t bring the child at all unless you like. There\xe2\x80\x99s many a one\r\nthat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. There\xe2\x80\x99s no compulsion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd would nothing be done to me if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d poor Miss Pynsent asked,\r\nunable to rid herself of the impression that it was somehow the arm of\r\nthe law that was stretched out to touch her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing that could happen to you would be that _he_ might throw\r\nit up against you later,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady from the prison observed with a\r\ngloomy breadth of view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, if he were to know that I had kept him back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99d be sure to know, one of these days. We see a great deal\r\nof that\xe2\x80\x94the way things come out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bowerbank, whose outlook\r\nappeared to abound in cheerless contingencies. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must remember that\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s her dying wish and that you may have it on your conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I _never_ could abide!\xe2\x80\x9d the little dressmaker exclaimed\r\nwith great emphasis and a visible shiver; after which she picked up\r\nvarious scattered remnants of muslin and cut paper and began to roll\r\nthem together with a desperate and mechanical haste. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite awful,\r\nto know what to do\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99re very sure she _is_ dying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean she\xe2\x80\x99s shamming? We\xe2\x80\x99ve plenty of that\xe2\x80\x94but we know how to\r\ntreat \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, I suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Miss Pynsent; while her visitor went on\r\nto say that the unfortunate person on whose behalf she had undertaken\r\nthis solemn pilgrimage might live a week and might live a fortnight,\r\nbut if she lived a month would violate (as Mrs. Bowerbank might express\r\nherself) every established law of nature, being reduced to skin and\r\nbone and with nothing left of her but the main desire to see her child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of her talking, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t much she\xe2\x80\x99d be able to\r\nsay. And we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow you more than about eight minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBowerbank pursued in a tone that seemed to refer itself to an iron\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want more; that would be enough to last me many\r\na year,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Pynsent accommodatingly. And then she added with\r\nanother illumination: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think he might throw it up against me\r\nthat I _did_ take him? People might tell him about her in later years;\r\nbut if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen her he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be obliged to believe them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bowerbank considered this a moment as if it were rather an\r\nintricate argument, and then answered quite in the spirit of her\r\nofficial pessimism. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing you may be sure of: whatever you\r\ndecide to do, as soon as ever he grows up he\xe2\x80\x99ll make you wish you had\r\ndone the opposite.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bowerbank called it oppos_ite_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear then, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad it will be a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be ever so long, if once he gets it into his head! At any rate\r\nyou must do as you think best. Only if you come you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t come when\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too impossible to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bowerbank with superior consistency. And she\r\nseemed more placidly grim than ever when she remarked, gathering up\r\nher loosened shawl, that she was much obliged to Miss Pynsent for her\r\ncivility and had been quite freshened up: her visit had so completely\r\ndeprived her hostess of that sort of calm. Miss Pynsent gave the\r\nfullest expression to her perplexity in the supreme exclamation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you could only wait and see the child I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it would help you to\r\njudge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear woman, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to judge\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s none of our business!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBowerbank exclaimed; and she had no sooner uttered the words than the\r\ndoor of the room creaked open and a small boy stood there gazing at\r\nher. Her eyes rested on him a moment, and then, most unexpectedly, she\r\ngave an inconsequent cry. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the child? Oh, Lord o\xe2\x80\x99 mercy, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake _him_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow _ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ he shrinking and sensitive?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Miss Pynsent, who\r\nhad pounced upon him and, holding him an instant at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length,\r\nappealed eagerly to her visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t he delicate and high-bred,\r\nand wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he be thrown into a state?\xe2\x80\x9d Delicate as he might be the\r\nlittle dressmaker shook him smartly for his naughtiness in being out of\r\nthe way when he was wanted, and brought him to the big square-faced,\r\ndeep-voiced lady who took up, as it were, all that side of the room.\r\nBut Mrs. Bowerbank laid no hand upon him; she only dropped her gaze\r\nfrom a tremendous height, and her forbearance seemed a tribute to that\r\nfragility of constitution on which Miss Pynsent desired to insist, just\r\nas her continued gravity was an implication that this scrupulous woman\r\nmight well not know what to do. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to the lady nicely and tell her\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re very sorry to have kept her waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child hesitated while he repaid with interest Mrs. Bowerbank\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninspection, and then he said with a cool, conscious indifference which\r\nMiss Pynsent instantly recognised as his aristocratic manner: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink she can have been in a very great hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was irony in the words, for it is a remarkable fact that even\r\nat the age of ten Hyacinth Robinson was ironic; but the subject of his\r\nallusion, who was not nimble withal, appeared not to interpret it; so\r\nthat she met it only by remarking over his head to Miss Pynsent: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe very face of her again\xe2\x80\x94only for the complexion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf _her_? But what do you say to Lord Frederick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _have_ seen lords that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so dainty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Pynsent had seen very few lords, but she entered with a passionate\r\nthrill into this generalisation; controlling herself, however, for she\r\nremembered the child was tremendously sharp, sufficiently to declare in\r\nan edifying tone that he would look more like what he ought to if his\r\nface were a little cleaner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was probably Millicent Henning dirtied my face when she kissed\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy announced with slow gravity, looking all the while at Mrs.\r\nBowerbank. He exhibited not a symptom of shyness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMillicent \xe2\x80\x99Enning\xe2\x80\x99s a very bad little girl; she\xe2\x80\x99ll come to no good,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Pynsent with familiar decision and also, considering the\r\nyoung lady in question had been her effective messenger, with marked\r\ningratitude.\r\n\r\nAgainst this qualification the child instantly protested. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is she\r\nbad? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99s bad; I like her awfully.\xe2\x80\x9d It came over him\r\nthat he had too hastily shifted to her shoulders the responsibility\r\nof his unseemly appearance, and he wished to make up to her for this\r\nbetrayal. He dimly felt that nothing but that particular accusation\r\ncould have pushed him to it, for he hated people with too few fair\r\ninterspaces, too many smutches and streaks. Millicent Henning generally\r\nhad two or three of these at least, which she borrowed from her doll,\r\ninto whom she was always rubbing her nose and whose dinginess was\r\ncontagious. It was quite inevitable she should have left her mark under\r\nhis own nose when she claimed her reward for coming to tell him about\r\nthe lady who wanted him.\r\n\r\nMiss Pynsent held the boy against her knee, trying to present him\r\nso that Mrs. Bowerbank should agree with her about his having the\r\nair of race. He was exceedingly diminutive, even for his years,\r\nand though his appearance was not so sickly as to excite remark, it\r\nseemed written in his attenuated little person that he would never\r\nbe either tall or positively hard. His dark blue eyes were separated\r\nby a wide interval, which increased the fairness and sweetness of his\r\nface, and his abundant curly hair, which grew thick and long, had the\r\ngolden brownness predestined to elicit exclamations of delight from\r\nladies when they take the inventory of a child. His features were\r\nformed and distributed; his head was set on a slim, straight neck;\r\nhis expression, grave and clear, showed a quick perception as well as\r\na great credulity; and he was altogether, in his tender fineness, an\r\ninteresting, an appealing little person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s one that would be sure to remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bowerbank,\r\nmentally contrasting him with the undeveloped members of her own brood,\r\nwho had never been retentive of anything but the halfpence which they\r\noccasionally contrived to filch from her. Her eyes descended to the\r\ndetails of his dress: the careful mending of his short breeches and his\r\nlong, coloured stockings, which she was in a position to appreciate,\r\nas well as the knot of bright ribbon which the dressmaker had passed\r\ninto his collar, slightly crumpled by Miss Henning\xe2\x80\x99s embrace. Of course\r\nMiss Pynsent had only one to look after, but her visitor was obliged\r\nto recognise that she had the highest standard in respect to buttons.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you _do_ turn him out so it\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, noting\r\nthe ingenious patches in the child\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, which, to her mind, were\r\nrepaired for all the world like those of a little nobleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re very civil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Pynsent, in a state of severe\r\nexaltation. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s never a needle but mine has come near him. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexactly what I think: the impression would go so deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to see me only to look at me?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth inquired with a\r\ncandour which, though unstudied, had again much satiric force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of the lady to notice you at all!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his\r\nprotectress, giving him an ineffectual jerk. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re no bigger than a\r\nflea; there are many that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know you from one, and not one of\r\nthem \xe2\x80\x98performing\xe2\x80\x99 ones either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find he\xe2\x80\x99s big enough, I expect, when he begins to go,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBowerbank remarked tranquilly; and she added that now she saw how he\r\nwas done for she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t but feel the other side was to be considered.\r\nIn her effort to be discreet by reason of his being present (and so\r\nprecociously attentive) she became slightly enigmatical; but Miss\r\nPynsent gathered her meaning, which was that it was very true the\r\nchild would take everything in and keep it, yet that at the same time\r\nit was precisely his being so attractive that made it a kind of sin\r\nnot to gratify the poor woman, who, if she knew what he looked like\r\nto-day, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forgive the person who had stepped into her place for\r\nnot producing him. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, in her position, I should go off easier\r\nif I had seen them curls,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bowerbank declared with a flight of\r\nmaternal imagination which brought her to her feet; while Miss Pynsent\r\nfelt she was leaving her dreadfully ploughed up and without any really\r\nfertilising seed sown. The little dressmaker packed the child upstairs\r\nto tidy himself for his tea, and as she accompanied her visitor to the\r\ndoor pleaded that if the latter would have a little more patience she\r\nwould think a day or two longer what was best and write when she should\r\nhave decided. Mrs. Bowerbank continued to move in a realm superior to\r\npoor Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s vacillations and timidities, and her detachment\r\ngave her hostess a high idea of her respectability; but the way was\r\na little smoothed when, after Amanda had moaned once more, on the\r\nthreshold, helplessly and irrelevantly, \xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t it a pity she\xe2\x80\x99s so bad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe ponderous lady from the prison rejoined in those tones which seemed\r\nmeant to resound through corridors of stone: \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmany that\xe2\x80\x99s ever so much worse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Pynsent, when she found herself alone, felt she was really\r\nquite upside down; for this lurid crisis had never entered into her\r\ncalculations: the very nature of the case had seemed to preclude\r\nit. All she had known or had wished to know was that in one of the\r\ndreadful establishments constructed for such purposes her quondam\r\ncomrade was serving out the sentence that had been substituted for\r\nthe other (the unspeakable horror) almost when the halter was already\r\nround her neck. As there had been no question of _that_ concession\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeing stretched any further, poor Florentine had seemed only a little\r\nmore dead than other people, having no decent tombstone to mark the\r\nplace where she lay. Miss Pynsent had therefore never thought of her\r\ndying again; she had had no idea to what prison she was committed on\r\nremoval from Newgate (she had wished to keep her mind a blank about\r\nthe matter in the interest of the child), and it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t occur to\r\nher that out of such silence and darkness a second voice would reach\r\nher, especially a voice she should really have to listen to. Miss\r\nPynsent would have said, before Mrs. Bowerbank\xe2\x80\x99s visit, that she had\r\nno account to render to any one; that she had taken up the child (who\r\nmight have starved in the gutter) out of charity, and had brought him\r\non, poor and precarious though her own subsistence, without a penny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhelp from another source; that the mother had forfeited every right and\r\ntitle; and that this had been understood between them\xe2\x80\x94if anything in\r\nso dreadful an hour could have been said to be understood\xe2\x80\x94when she had\r\ngone to see her at Newgate (that terrible episode, nine years before,\r\nstill overshadowed all Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s other memories): had gone to\r\nsee her because Florentine had sent for her (a name, face and address\r\ncoming up out of the still recent but sharply separated past of their\r\nworking-girl years) as the one friend to whom she could appeal with\r\nsome chance of a pitying answer. The effect of violent emotion with\r\nMiss Pynsent was not to make her sit with idle hands or fidget about\r\nto no purpose; under its influence, on the contrary, she threw herself\r\ninto little jobs as a fugitive takes to by-paths, and clipped and cut\r\nand stitched and basted as if to run a race with hysterics. And while\r\nher hands, her scissors, her needle flew an infinite succession of\r\nfantastic possibilities trotted through her confused little head: she\r\nhad a furious imagination, and the act of reflexion, in her mind, was\r\nalways a panorama of figures and scenes. She had had her picture of\r\nthe future, painted in rather rosy hues, hung up before her now for\r\na good many years; but it struck her that Mrs. Bowerbank\xe2\x80\x99s heavy hand\r\nhad suddenly punched a hole in the canvas. It must be added, however,\r\nthat if Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts were apt to be bewildering visions they\r\nsometimes led her to make up her mind, and on this particular September\r\nevening she arrived at a momentous decision. What she made up her\r\nmind to was to take advice, and in pursuance of this view she rushed\r\ndownstairs and, jerking Hyacinth away from his simple but unfinished\r\nrepast, packed him across the street to tell Mr. Vetch (if he had not\r\nyet started for the theatre) that she begged he would come in to see\r\nher when he came home that night, as she had something very particular\r\nindeed to say to him. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if he should be very late, he\r\ncould come in at any hour\xe2\x80\x94he would see her light in the window\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhe would do her no end of good. Miss Pynsent knew it was no use for\r\nher to go to bed; she felt as if she should never close her eyes\r\nagain. Mr. Vetch was her most distinguished friend; she had an immense\r\nappreciation of his cleverness and knowledge of the world, as well as\r\nof the purity of his taste in matters of conduct and opinion; and she\r\nhad already consulted him about Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s education. The boy needed\r\nno urging to go on such an errand, for he too had his ideas about the\r\nlittle fiddler, the second violin in the orchestra of the Bloomsbury\r\nTheatre. Mr. Vetch had on a great occasion, within the year, obtained\r\nfor the pair an order for two seats at a pantomime, and to Hyacinth\r\nthe impression of that ecstatic evening had consecrated him, placed\r\nhim for ever in the golden glow of the footlights. There were things in\r\nlife of which, even at the age of ten, it was a conviction of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat it would be his fate never to see enough, and one of these was the\r\nwonder-world illuminated by those playhouse lamps. But there would be\r\nchances perhaps if one didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose sight of Mr. Vetch: he might open\r\nthe door again\xe2\x80\x94he was a privileged, magical mortal who went to the play\r\nevery night.\r\n\r\nHe came in to see Miss Pynsent about midnight; as soon as she heard the\r\nlame tinkle of the bell she went to the door and let him in. He was an\r\noriginal, in the fullest sense of the word: a lonely, disappointed,\r\nembittered, cynical little man, whose musical organisation had been\r\nsterile, who had the nerves and sensibilities of a gentleman, yet whose\r\nfate had condemned him for the last ten years to play a fiddle at a\r\nsecond-rate establishment for a few shillings a week. He had ideas of\r\nhis own about everything, and they were not always very improving. For\r\nAmanda Pynsent he represented art, literature (the literature of the\r\nplay-bill) and philosophy, so that she always felt about him as if he\r\nbelonged to a higher social sphere, though his earnings were hardly\r\ngreater than her own and he occupied a single back room in a house\r\nwhere she had never seen a window washed. He had for her the glamour\r\nof reduced gentility and fallen fortunes; she was conscious that he\r\nspoke a different language (though she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said in what,\r\nunless in more wicked words as well as more grand ones, the difference\r\nconsisted) from the other members of her humble, almost suburban\r\ncircle; and the shape of his hands was distinctly aristocratic. (Miss\r\nPynsent, as I have intimated, was immensely preoccupied with that\r\nelement in life.) Mr. Vetch displeased her only by one of the aspects\r\nof his character\xe2\x80\x94his blasphemous republican, radical views and the\r\nlicentious manner in which he expressed himself about the nobility.\r\nOn that ground he worried her extremely, though he never seemed to\r\nher so probably well-connected, like Hyacinth himself, as when he\r\nhorrified her most. These dreadful theories (expressed so brilliantly\r\nthat really they might have been dangerous if Miss Pynsent had not been\r\nso grounded in the Christian faith and known thereby her own place so\r\nwell) constituted no presumption against his refined origin; they were\r\nexplained rather to a certain extent by a just resentment at finding\r\nhimself excluded from his proper position. Mr. Vetch was short, fat\r\nand bald, though he was not much older than Miss Pynsent, who was not\r\nmuch older than some people who called themselves forty-five; he always\r\nwent to the theatre in evening dress, with a flower in his buttonhole,\r\nand wore a glass in one eye. He looked placid and genial and as if he\r\nwould fidget at the most about the \xe2\x80\x9cget up\xe2\x80\x9d of his linen; you would\r\nhave thought him finical but superficial, and never have suspected\r\nthat he was a revolutionist, or even an at all bold critic of life.\r\nSometimes when he could get away from the theatre early enough he\r\nwent with a pianist, a friend of his, to play dance-music at small\r\nparties; and after such expeditions he was particularly cynical and\r\nstartling; he indulged in diatribes against the British middle-class,\r\nits Philistinism, its absurdity, its snobbery. He seldom had much\r\nconversation with Miss Pynsent without telling her that she had the\r\nintellectual outlook of a caterpillar; but this was his privilege after\r\na friendship now of seven years\xe2\x80\x99 standing, which had begun (the year\r\nafter he came to live in Lomax Place) with her going over to nurse him\r\non learning from the milk-woman that he was alone at number 17\xe2\x80\x94laid up\r\nthere with an attack of gastritis. He always compared her to an insect\r\nor a bird, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, because she knew he liked her, and she\r\nherself liked all winged creatures. How indeed could she complain after\r\nhearing him call the Queen a superannuated form and the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury a grotesque superstition?\r\n\r\nHe laid his violin-case on the table, which was covered with a\r\nconfusion of fashion-plates and pin-cushions, and glanced toward the\r\nfire where a kettle was gently hissing. Miss Pynsent, who had put it\r\non half an hour before, read his glance and reflected with complacency\r\nthat Mrs. Bowerbank had not absolutely drained the little bottle in\r\nthe cheffoneer. She placed it on the table again, this time with a\r\nsingle glass, and told her visitor that, as a great exception, he\r\nmight light his pipe. In fact she always made the exception, and\r\nhe always replied to the gracious speech by inquiring whether she\r\nsupposed the greengrocers\xe2\x80\x99 wives, the butchers\xe2\x80\x99 daughters, for whom\r\nshe worked had fine enough noses to smell in the garments she sent\r\nhome the fumes of his tobacco. He knew her \xe2\x80\x9cconnexion\xe2\x80\x9d was confined\r\nto small shopkeepers, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish others to know it and would\r\nhave liked them to believe it important the poor little stuffs she\r\nmade up (into very queer fashions I am afraid) should not surprise the\r\nfeminine nostril. But it had always been impossible to impose on Mr.\r\nVetch; he guessed the truth, the treacherous untrimmed truth, about\r\neverything in a moment. She was sure he would do so now in regard to\r\nthis solemn question that had come up for Hyacinth; he would see that,\r\nthough agreeably flurried at finding herself whirled in the last eddies\r\nof a case that had been so celebrated in its day, her secret wish\r\nwas to shirk her duty\xe2\x80\x94if it was a duty; to keep the child from ever\r\nknowing his mother\xe2\x80\x99s unmentionable history, the shame that attached\r\nto his origin, the opportunity she had had of letting him see the\r\nwretched woman before it was too late. She knew Mr. Vetch would read\r\nher troubled thoughts, but she hoped he would say they were natural\r\nand just: she reflected that as he took an interest in Hyacinth he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t desire him to be subjected to a mortification that might\r\nrankle for ever and perhaps even crush him to the earth. She related\r\nMrs. Bowerbank\xe2\x80\x99s visit while he sat on the sofa in the very place\r\nwhere that majestic woman had reposed and puffed his smoke-wreaths\r\ninto the dusky little room. He knew the story of the child\xe2\x80\x99s birth,\r\nhad known it years before, so that she had no startling revelation\r\nto make. He was not in the least agitated to hear of Florentine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napproaching end in prison and of her having managed to get a message\r\nconveyed to Amanda; he thought this so much in the usual course that he\r\nsaid to Miss Pynsent: \xe2\x80\x9cDid you expect her to live on there for ever,\r\nworking out her terrible sentence, just to spare you the annoyance of\r\na dilemma, to save you a reminder of her miserable existence, which\r\nyou have preferred to forget?\xe2\x80\x9d That was just the sort of question Mr.\r\nVetch was sure to ask, and he inquired further of his dismayed hostess\r\nif she were sure her friend\xe2\x80\x99s message (he called the unhappy creature\r\nher friend) had come to her in the regular way. The warders surely\r\nhad no authority to introduce visitors to their captives, and was it a\r\nquestion of her going off to the prison on the sole authority of Mrs.\r\nBowerbank? The little dressmaker explained that this lady had merely\r\ncome to sound her: Florentine had begged so hard. She had been in Mrs.\r\nBowerbank\xe2\x80\x99s ward before her removal to the infirmary, where she now\r\nlay ebbing away, and she had communicated her desire to the Catholic\r\nchaplain, who had undertaken that some satisfaction\xe2\x80\x94of inquiry, at\r\nleast\xe2\x80\x94should be given her. He had thought it best to ascertain first\r\nwhether the person in charge of the child would be willing to bring\r\nhim, such a course being perfectly optional, and he had had some talk\r\nwith Mrs. Bowerbank on the subject, in which it was agreed between\r\nthem that if she would approach Miss Pynsent and explain to her the\r\nsituation, leaving her to do what she thought best, he would answer\r\nfor it that the consent of the governor of the prison should be given\r\nto the interview. Miss Pynsent had lived for fourteen years in Lomax\r\nPlace, and Florentine had never forgotten that this was her address at\r\nthe time she came to her at Newgate (before her dreadful sentence had\r\nbeen commuted) and promised, in an outgush of pity for one whom she had\r\nknown in the days of her honesty and brightness, that she would save\r\nthe child, rescue it from the workhouse and the streets, keep it from\r\nthe fate that had swallowed up the mother. Mrs. Bowerbank had had a\r\nhalf-holiday, and she also rejoiced in a sister living in the north of\r\nLondon, to whom she had been for some time intending a visit; so that\r\nafter her domestic duty had been performed it had been possible for her\r\nto drop in on Miss Pynsent in an informal, natural way and put the case\r\nbefore her. It would be just as she might be disposed to view it. She\r\nwas to think it over a day or two, but not long, because the woman was\r\nso ill, and then write to Mrs. Bowerbank at the prison. If she should\r\nconsent Mrs. Bowerbank would tell the chaplain, and the chaplain would\r\nobtain the order from the governor and send it to Lomax Place; after\r\nwhich Amanda would immediately set out with her unconscious victim. But\r\nshould she\xe2\x80\x94_must_ she\xe2\x80\x94consent? That was the terrible, the heart-shaking\r\nquestion, with which Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s unaided wisdom had been unable to\r\ngrapple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t hers any more\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s mine, mine only and mine\r\nalways. I should like to know if all I\xe2\x80\x99ve done for him doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nhim so!\xe2\x80\x9d It was in this manner that Amanda Pynsent delivered herself\r\nwhile she plied her needle faster than ever in a piece of stuff that\r\nwas pinned to her knee.\r\n\r\nMr. Vetch watched her a while, blowing silently at his pipe, his head\r\nthrown back on the high, stiff, old-fashioned sofa and his little legs\r\ncrossed under him like a Turk\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true you\xe2\x80\x99ve done a good deal\r\nfor him. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good little woman, my dear Pinnie, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cafter all\xe2\x80\x9d because that was a part of his tone. In reality he had\r\nnever had a moment\xe2\x80\x99s doubt that she was the best little woman in the\r\nnorth of London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done what I could, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t put myself forward above others.\r\nOnly it does make a difference when you come to look at it\xe2\x80\x94about taking\r\nhim off to see another woman. And _such_ another woman\xe2\x80\x94and in such a\r\nplace! I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hardly right to take an innocent child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that; there are people who would tell you it would\r\ndo him good. If he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the place as a child he\xe2\x80\x99d take more care\r\nto keep out of it later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, Mr. Vetch, how can you think? And him such a perfect little\r\ngentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you that have made him one?\xe2\x80\x9d the fiddler asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run\r\nin the family, you\xe2\x80\x99d say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFamily? what do you know about that?\xe2\x80\x9d she returned quickly, catching\r\nat her dearest, her only hobby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes indeed, what does any one know? what did she know herself?\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s visitor added irrelevantly: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you have\r\ntaken him on your back? Why did you want to be so extra good? No one\r\nelse thinks it necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be extra good. That is I do want to, of course, in a\r\ngeneral way: but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the reason then. You see I had nothing of\r\nmy own\xe2\x80\x94I had nothing in the world but my thimble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would have seemed to most people a reason for not adopting a\r\nprostitute\xe2\x80\x99s bastard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I went to see him at the place where he was (just where she\r\nhad left him, with the woman of the house) and I saw what kind of a\r\nshop _that_ was, and felt it a shame an unspotted child should grow\r\nup in such a place.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent defended herself as earnestly as if\r\nher inconsistency had been of a criminal cast. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ngrown up neither. _They_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have troubled themselves long with\r\na helpless baby. _They\xe2\x80\x99d_ have played some bad trick on him, if it was\r\nonly to send him to the workhouse. Besides, I always was fond of tiny\r\ncreatures and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been fond of this one,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, speaking as if\r\nwith a consciousness, on her own part, of almost heroic proportions.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was in my way the first two or three years, and it was a good deal\r\nof a pull to look after the business and him together. But now he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike the business\xe2\x80\x94he seems to go of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if he flourishes as the business flourishes you can just enjoy\r\nyour peace of mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fiddler, still with his manner of making\r\na small dry joke of everything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very well, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t close my eyes to that poor woman\r\nlying there and moaning just for the touch of his little \xe2\x80\x99and before\r\nshe passes away. Mrs. Bowerbank says she believes I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho believes? Mrs. Bowerbank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything in life holy enough for you to take it\r\nseriously,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent rejoined, snapping off a thread with temper.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day you stop laughing I should like to be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as you\xe2\x80\x99re there I shall never stop. What is it you want me to\r\nadvise you? to take the child, or to leave the mother to wail herself\r\naway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to tell me if he\xe2\x80\x99ll curse me when he grows older.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends on what you do. However, he\xe2\x80\x99ll probably curse you in\r\neither case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that, because you like him, you love him,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAmanda with acuteness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely; and he\xe2\x80\x99ll curse me too. He\xe2\x80\x99ll curse every one. Much good\r\nwill our love do us! He won\xe2\x80\x99t be happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you think I bring him up,\xe2\x80\x9d the little dressmaker\r\nremarked with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t bring him up at all. He brings you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve always said; but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. If you mean that\r\nhe does as he likes, then he ought to be happy. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t kind of you to\r\nsay he won\xe2\x80\x99t be,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent added reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d say anything you like if what I say would help the matter. He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nthin-skinned, morbid, mooning, introspective little beggar, with a good\r\ndeal of imagination and not much perseverance, who\xe2\x80\x99ll expect a good\r\ndeal more of life than he\xe2\x80\x99ll find in it. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he won\xe2\x80\x99t be happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Pynsent listened to this description of her _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_ with an\r\nappearance of criticising it mentally; but in reality she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat \xe2\x80\x9cintrospective\xe2\x80\x9d meant and didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to ask. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the cleverest\r\nperson I know except yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a moment; for Mr. Vetch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords had been in the key of what she thought most remarkable in him.\r\nWhat that was she would have been unable to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much for putting me first,\xe2\x80\x9d the fiddler returned after\r\na series of puffs. \xe2\x80\x9cThe youngster\xe2\x80\x99s interesting; one sees he has a\r\nmind and even a soul, and in that respect he\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t say unique, but\r\npeculiar. I shall watch with curiosity to see what he grows into. But I\r\nshall always be glad that I\xe2\x80\x99m a selfish brute of a decent bachelor\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nI never invested in that class of goods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you _are_ comforting. You\xe2\x80\x99d spoil him more than I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAmanda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly, but it would be in a different way. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him\r\nevery three minutes that his father was a duke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA duke I never mentioned!\xe2\x80\x9d the little dressmaker cried with\r\neagerness. \xe2\x80\x9cI never specified any rank nor said a word about any one\r\nin particular. I never so much as insinuated the name of his lordship.\r\nBut I may have said that if the truth was to be found out he might be\r\nproved to be connected\xe2\x80\x94in the way of cousinship, or something of the\r\nkind\xe2\x80\x94with the highest in the land. I should have thought myself wanting\r\nif I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t given him a glimpse of that. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nalways added\xe2\x80\x94that the truth never _is_ found out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re still more comforting than I!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Vetch exclaimed. He\r\ncontinued to watch her with his charitable, round-faced smile, and\r\nthen he said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t do what I say; so what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of my telling\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you I will, if you say you believe it\xe2\x80\x99s the only right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I often say anything so asinine? Right\xe2\x80\x94right? what have you to do\r\nwith that? If you want the only right you\xe2\x80\x99re very particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease then what am I to go by?\xe2\x80\x9d the dressmaker asked bewildered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re to go by this, by what will take the youngster down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake him down, my poor little pet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour poor little pet thinks himself the flower of creation. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay there\xe2\x80\x99s any harm in that: a fine blooming, odoriferous conceit is\r\na natural appendage of youth and intelligence. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say there\xe2\x80\x99s any\r\ngreat harm in it, but if you want a guide as to how you\xe2\x80\x99re to treat the\r\nboy, that\xe2\x80\x99s as good a guide as any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want me to arrange the interview then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to do anything but give me another _leetle_\r\nswig\xe2\x80\x94thanks. I just say this: that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a great gain, early\r\nin life, to know the worst; then we don\xe2\x80\x99t live in a rank fools\xe2\x80\x99\r\nparadise. I did that till I was nearly forty; then I woke up and found\r\nI was in Lomax Place.\xe2\x80\x9d Whenever Mr. Vetch said anything that could be\r\nconstrued as a reference to a former position that had had elements\r\nof distinction Miss Pynsent observed a respectful, a tasteful silence\r\nand that is why she didn\xe2\x80\x99t challenge him now, though she wanted very\r\nmuch to say that Hyacinth was no more \xe2\x80\x9cpresumptious\xe2\x80\x9d (that was the\r\nterm she would have used) than he had reason to be, with his genteel\r\nappearance, and his acknowledged powers; and that as for thinking\r\nhimself a \xe2\x80\x9cflower\xe2\x80\x9d of any kind he knew but too well that he lived in\r\na small black-faced house miles away from any good family, rented by\r\na poor little woman who took lodgers and who, as they were of such\r\na class that they were not always to be depended upon to settle her\r\nweekly account, had a strain to make two ends meet, for all the sign\r\nbetween her windows\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     MISS AMANDA PYNSENT\r\n     _Modes et Robes_\r\n\r\n     DRESSMAKING IN ALL ITS BRANCHES: COURT-DRESSES:\r\n     MANTLES AND FASHIONABLE BONNETS\r\n\r\nSingularly enough, her companion, before she had permitted herself to\r\ninterpose, took up her own thought (in one of its parts) and remarked\r\nthat perhaps she would say of the child that he was, so far as his\r\nactual circumstances were concerned, low enough down in the world\r\nwithout one\xe2\x80\x99s wanting him to be any lower. \xe2\x80\x9cBut by the time he\xe2\x80\x99s twenty\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll persuade himself that Lomax Place was a bad dream, that your\r\nlodgers and your dressmaking were as imaginary as they are vulgar, and\r\nthat when an old friend came to see you late at night it was not your\r\namiable practice to make him a glass of brandy and water. He\xe2\x80\x99ll teach\r\nhimself to forget all this: he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean he\xe2\x80\x99ll forget _me_, he\xe2\x80\x99ll deny me?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Pynsent,\r\nstopping the movement of her needle short off for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the person designated in that attractive blazonry on the outside\r\nof your house decidedly he will; and me, equally, as a bald-headed,\r\npot-bellied fiddler who regarded you as the most perfect lady of his\r\nacquaintance. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean he\xe2\x80\x99ll disown you and pretend he never knew\r\nyou: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99ll ever be such an odious little cad as that; he\r\nprobably won\xe2\x80\x99t be a sneak, and he strikes me as having some affection\r\nand possibly even some gratitude in him. But his imagination (which\r\nwill always give him his cue about everything) shall subject you to\r\nsome extraordinary metamorphosis. He\xe2\x80\x99ll dress you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll dress me up?\xe2\x80\x9d Amanda ejaculated, quite ceasing to follow\r\nthe train of Mr. Vetch\xe2\x80\x99s demonstration. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean he\xe2\x80\x99ll have the\r\nproperty\xe2\x80\x94that his relations will take him up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, delightful, idiotic Pinnie, I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking in a figurative\r\nmanner. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to say what his precise position will be when\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re relegated; but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure relegation will be our fate. Therefore\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t stuff him with any more false notions and fine illusions than are\r\nnecessary to keep him alive; he\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to pick up enough on the\r\nway. On the contrary, give him a good stiff dose of the truth at the\r\nstart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeary me, of course you see much further into it than I could ever\r\ndo,\xe2\x80\x9d Pinnie murmured as she threaded a needle.\r\n\r\nMr. Vetch paused a minute, but apparently not out of deference to this\r\namiable interruption. He went on suddenly with a ring of feeling in his\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him know, because it will be useful to him later, the state\r\nof the account between society and himself; he can then conduct himself\r\naccordingly. If he\xe2\x80\x99s the illegitimate child of a French impropriety\r\nwho murdered one of her numerous lovers, don\xe2\x80\x99t shuffle out of sight so\r\nimportant a fact. I regard that as a most valuable origin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, Mr. Vetch, how you _can_ talk!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Pynsent with her\r\never-fresh faculty of vain protest. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what one would think,\r\nto hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, my dear lady, and for this reason: that those are the people\r\nwith whom society has to count. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t with you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss\r\nPynsent gave a sigh which might have meant either that she was well\r\naware of that or that Mr. Vetch had a terrible way of enlarging a\r\nsubject, especially when it was already too big for her; and her\r\nphilosophic visitor went on: \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little devil, let him see her, take\r\nhim straight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if later, when he\xe2\x80\x99s twenty, he says to me that if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t meddled\r\nin it he need never have known, need never have had that shame, pray\r\nwhat am I to say to him then? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can say to him that a young man who\xe2\x80\x99s sorry for having gone to his\r\nmother when, in her last hours, she lay crying for him on a pallet in\r\na penitentiary, deserves more than the sharpest pang he can possibly\r\nfeel.\xe2\x80\x9d And the little fiddler, getting up, went over to the fireplace\r\nand shook out the ashes of his pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s natural he should feel badly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Pynsent,\r\nfolding up her work with the same desperate quickness that had animated\r\nher through the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least objection to his feeling badly; that\xe2\x80\x99s not the\r\nworst thing in the world! If a few more people felt badly, in this\r\nsodden, stolid, stupid race of ours, the world would wake up to an\r\nidea or two and we should see the beginning of the dance. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndull acceptance, the absence of reflexion, the impenetrable density.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHere Mr. Vetch stopped short; his hostess stood before him with eyes of\r\nentreaty, with clasped hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Anastasius Vetch, don\xe2\x80\x99t go off into them dreadful wild theories!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe cried, always ungrammatical when she was strongly moved. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nalways fly away over the house-tops. I thought you liked him better\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndear little unfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnastasius Vetch had pocketed his pipe; he put on his hat with the\r\nfreedom of old acquaintance and of Lomax Place, and took up his small\r\ncoffin-like fiddle-case. \xe2\x80\x9cMy good Pinnie, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you understand\r\na word I say. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use talking\xe2\x80\x94do as you like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must say I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was worth your coming in at midnight\r\nonly to tell me that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like anything\xe2\x80\x94I hate the whole dreadful\r\nbusiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bent over, for all his figure, to kiss her hand with the flourish\r\nof a troubadour and as he had seen people do on the stage. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nfriend, we\xe2\x80\x99ve different ideas, and I never shall succeed in driving\r\nmine into your head. It\xe2\x80\x99s because I _am_ fond of him, poor little\r\ndevil; but you\xe2\x80\x99ll never understand that. I want him to know everything,\r\nand especially the worst\xe2\x80\x94the very worst, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said. If I were in his\r\nposition I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t thank you for trying to make a fool of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fool of you?\xe2\x80\x94as if I thought of anything but his \xe2\x80\x99appiness!\xe2\x80\x9d Amanda\r\nPynsent exclaimed. She stood looking at him but following her own\r\nreflexions; she had given up the attempt to enter into his whims. She\r\nremembered what she had noticed in other occurrences, that his reasons\r\nwere always more extraordinary than his behaviour itself. If you only\r\nconsidered his life you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought him so immoral. \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\nlikely I think too much of that,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wants him and cries\r\nfor him; that\xe2\x80\x99s what keeps coming back to me.\xe2\x80\x9d She took up her lamp to\r\nlight Mr. Vetch to the door (for the dim luminary in the passage had\r\nlong since been extinguished), and before he left the house he turned\r\nsuddenly, stopping short and with his composed face taking a strange\r\nexpression from the quizzical glimmer of his little round eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter after all, and why do you worry? What difference\r\ncan it make what happens\xe2\x80\x94on either side\xe2\x80\x94to such low people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Bowerbank had let her know she would meet her almost at the\r\nthreshold of the dreadful place; and this thought had sustained Miss\r\nPynsent in her long and devious journey, performed partly on foot,\r\npartly in a succession of omnibuses. She had had ideas about a cab,\r\nbut she decided to reserve the cab for the return, as then, very\r\nlikely, she should be so prostrate with emotion, so overpoweringly\r\naffected, that it would be a comfort to escape from observation. She\r\nhad no confidence that if once she passed the door of the prison she\r\nshould ever be restored to liberty and her customers; it seemed to\r\nher an adventure as dangerous as it was dismal, and she was immensely\r\ntouched by the clear-faced eagerness of the child at her side, who\r\nstrained forward as brightly as he had done on another occasion, still\r\ncelebrated in Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s industrious annals, a certain sultry\r\nSaturday in August when she had taken him to the Tower. It had been a\r\nterrible question with her, once she had made up her mind, what she\r\nshould tell him about the nature of their errand. She determined to\r\ntell him as little as possible, to say only that she was going to see\r\na poor woman who was in prison on account of a crime committed many\r\nyears before, and who had sent for her and caused her to be told at\r\nthe same time that if there was any child she could see\xe2\x80\x94as children (if\r\nthey were good) were bright and cheering\xe2\x80\x94it would make her very happy\r\nthat such a little visitor should come as well. It was very difficult,\r\nwith Hyacinth, to make reservations or mysteries; he wanted to know\r\neverything about everything and he projected the fierce light of his\r\nquestions on Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s incarcerated friend. She had to admit that\r\nshe had been her friend (since where else was the obligation to go\r\nto see her?) but she spoke of the acquaintance as if it were of the\r\nslightest (it had survived in the memory of the prisoner only because\r\nevery one else\xe2\x80\x94the world was so very severe!\xe2\x80\x94had turned away from\r\nher) and she congratulated herself on a happy inspiration when she\r\nrepresented the crime for which such a penalty had been exacted as the\r\ntheft of a gold watch in a moment of cruel want. The woman had had a\r\nwicked husband who maltreated and deserted her; she had been very poor,\r\nalmost starving, dreadfully pressed. Hyacinth listened to her history\r\nwith absorbed attention and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she any children\xe2\x80\x94hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she a little boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis inquiry seemed to Miss Pynsent an omen of future embarrassments,\r\nbut she met it as bravely as she could, replying that she believed the\r\nwretched victim of the law had had (once upon a time) a very small\r\nbaby, but was afraid she had completely lost sight of it. He must\r\nknow they didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow babies in prisons. To this Hyacinth rejoined\r\nthat of course they would allow him, because of his size. Miss Pynsent\r\nfortified herself with the memory of her other pilgrimage, the visit\r\nto Newgate upwards of ten years before; she had escaped from _that_\r\nordeal and had even had the comfort of knowing that in its fruits the\r\ninterview had been beneficent. The responsibility, however, was much\r\ngreater now, and, after all, it was not on her own account she faltered\r\nand feared, but on that of the tender sensibility over which the shadow\r\nof the house of shame might cast itself.\r\n\r\nThey made the last part of their approach on foot, having got\r\nthemselves deposited as near as possible to the river and keeping\r\nbeside it (according to advice elicited by Miss Pynsent, on the way,\r\nin a dozen confidential interviews with policemen, conductors of\r\nomnibuses and small shopkeepers) till they came to a big dark-towered\r\nbuilding which they would know as soon as they looked at it. They\r\nknew it in fact soon enough when they saw it lift its dusky mass from\r\nthe bank of the Thames, lying there and sprawling over the whole\r\nneighbourhood with brown, bare, windowless walls, ugly, truncated\r\npinnacles and a character unspeakably sad and stern. It looked very\r\nsinister and wicked, to Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and she wondered why a\r\nprison should have such an evil air if it was erected in the interest\r\nof justice and order\xe2\x80\x94a builded protest, precisely, against vice and\r\nvillainy. This particular penitentiary struck her as about as bad and\r\nwrong as those who were in it; it threw a blight on the face of day,\r\nmaking the river seem foul and poisonous and the opposite bank, with a\r\nprotrusion of long-necked chimneys, unsightly gasometers and deposits\r\nof rubbish, wear the aspect of a region at whose expense the jail had\r\nbeen populated. She looked up at the dull, closed gates, tightening her\r\ngrasp of Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s small hand; and if it was hard to believe anything\r\nso barred and blind and deaf would relax itself to let her in, there\r\nwas a dreadful premonitory sinking of the heart attached to the idea of\r\nits taking the same trouble to let her out. As she hung back, murmuring\r\nvague ejaculations, at the very goal of her journey, an incident\r\noccurred which fanned all her scruples and reluctances into life again.\r\nThe child suddenly jerked away his hand and, placing it behind him in\r\nthe clutch of the other, said to her respectfully but resolutely, while\r\nhe planted himself at a considerable distance:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither do I like it, my darling,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the dressmaker pitifully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you knew how little!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll go away. I won\xe2\x80\x99t go in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would have embraced this proposition with alacrity if it had not\r\nbecome very vivid to her while she stood there, in the midst of her\r\nshrinking, that behind those sullen walls the mother who bore him was\r\neven then counting the minutes. She was alive in that huge dark tomb,\r\nand Miss Pynsent could feel that they had already entered into relation\r\nwith her. They were near her and she was aware; in a few minutes\r\nshe would taste the cup of the only mercy (except the reprieve from\r\nhanging) she had known since her fall. A few, a very few minutes would\r\ndo it, and it seemed to our pilgrim that if she should fail of her\r\ncharity now the watches of the night in Lomax Place would be haunted\r\nwith remorse\xe2\x80\x94perhaps even with something worse. There was something\r\ninside that waited and listened, something that would burst, with an\r\nawful sound, a shriek or a curse, were she to lead the boy away. She\r\nlooked into his pale face, perfectly conscious it would be vain for\r\nher to take the tone of command; besides, that would have seemed to her\r\nshocking. She had another inspiration, and she said to him in a manner\r\nin which she had had occasion to speak before:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason why we\xe2\x80\x99ve come is only to be kind. If we\xe2\x80\x99re kind we shan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind its being disagreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we be so kind if she\xe2\x80\x99s a bad woman?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth demanded.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must be very low; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush,\xe2\x80\x9d groaned poor Amanda, edging toward him with clasped\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not bad now; it has all been washed away\xe2\x80\x94it has been\r\nexpiated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98expiated\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the child while she almost kneeled down in\r\nthe dust to catch him to her bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s when you\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered terribly\xe2\x80\x94suffered so much that it has made\r\nyou good again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas _she_ suffered very much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor years and years. And now she\xe2\x80\x99s dying. It proves she\xe2\x80\x99s very good\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94that she should want to see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean because _we_ are good?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth went on, probing\r\nthe matter in a way that made his companion quiver and gazing away\r\nfrom her, very seriously, across the river, at the dreary waste of\r\nBattersea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be good if we\xe2\x80\x99re compassionate, if we make an effort,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe dressmaker, seeming to look up at him rather than down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if she\xe2\x80\x99s dying? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see any one die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Pynsent was bewildered, but her desperation helped. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we go to\r\nher perhaps she won\xe2\x80\x99t. Maybe we shall save her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe transferred his remarkable little eyes\xe2\x80\x94eyes which always appeared to\r\nher to belong to a person older and stronger than herself\xe2\x80\x94to her face;\r\nand then he put to her: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I save such a creature if I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she likes you, that will be enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Miss Pynsent began to see that he was moved. \xe2\x80\x9cWill she like me\r\nvery much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore, much more, than any one\xe2\x80\x94ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than you, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amanda quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean more than she likes any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth had slipped his hands into the pockets of his scanty\r\nknickerbockers and, with his legs slightly apart, looked from his\r\ncompanion back to the immense dreary jail. A great deal, to her sense,\r\ndepended on the moment. \xe2\x80\x9cOh well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just step\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeary, deary!\xe2\x80\x9d the dressmaker murmured to herself as they crossed\r\nthe bare semicircle which separated the gateway from the unfrequented\r\nstreet. She exerted herself to pull the bell, which seemed to her\r\nterribly big and stiff, and while she waited again for the consequences\r\nof this effort the boy broke out abruptly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can she like me so much if she has never seen me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Pynsent wished the gate would open before an answer to this\r\nquestion should become imperative, but the people within were a long\r\ntime arriving, and their delay gave Hyacinth an opportunity to repeat\r\nit. So she replied, seizing the first pretext that came into her head:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s because the little baby she had of old was also named Hyacinth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a rummy reason,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy murmured, still staring across at the\r\nBattersea shore.\r\n\r\nA moment later they found themselves in a vast interior dimness,\r\nwhile a grinding of keys and bolts went on behind them. Hereupon Miss\r\nPynsent gave herself up to an overruling providence, and she remembered\r\nafterwards no circumstance of what happened to her till the great\r\nperson of Mrs. Bowerbank loomed up in the narrowness of a strange, dark\r\ncorridor. She had only had meanwhile a confused impression of being\r\nsurrounded with high black walls, whose inner face was more dreadful\r\nthan the other, the one that overlooked the river; of passing through\r\ngrey, stony courts, in some of which dreadful figures, scarcely female,\r\nin hideous brown misfitting uniforms and perfect frights of hoods, were\r\nmarching round in a circle; of squeezing up steep unlighted staircases\r\nat the heels of a woman who had taken possession of her at the first\r\nstage and who made incomprehensible remarks to other women, of lumpish\r\naspect, as she saw them erect themselves, suddenly and spectrally, with\r\ndowdy untied bonnets, in uncanny corners and recesses of the draughty\r\nlabyrinth. If the place had seemed cruel to the poor little dressmaker\r\noutside, it may be trusted not to have struck her as an abode of\r\nmercy while she pursued her tortuous way into the circular shafts\r\nof cells where she had an opportunity of looking at captives through\r\ngrated peepholes and of edging past others who had temporarily been\r\nturned into the corridors\xe2\x80\x94silent women, with fixed eyes, who flattened\r\nthemselves against the stone walls at the brush of the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndress and whom Miss Pynsent was afraid to glance at. She never had\r\nfelt so immured, so made sure of; there were walls within walls and\r\ngalleries on top of galleries; even the daylight lost its colour and\r\nyou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what o\xe2\x80\x99clock it was. Mrs. Bowerbank appeared to\r\nhave failed her, and that made her feel worse; a panic seized her, as\r\nshe went, in regard to the child. On him too the horror of the scene\r\nwould have fallen, and she had a sickening prevision that he would have\r\nconvulsions after they got home. It was a most improper place to have\r\nbrought him to, no matter who had sent for him and no matter who was\r\ndying. The stillness would terrify him, she was sure\xe2\x80\x94the penitential\r\ndumbness of the clustered or isolated women. She clasped his hand more\r\ntightly and felt him keep close to her without speaking a word. At\r\nlast in an open doorway darkened by her ample person Mrs. Bowerbank\r\nrevealed herself, and Miss Pynsent thought it subsequently a sign of\r\nher place and power that she should not condescend to apologise for not\r\nhaving appeared till that moment, or to explain why she had not met\r\nthe bewildered pilgrims near the principal entrance according to her\r\npromise. Miss Pynsent couldn\xe2\x80\x99t embrace the state of mind of people who\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t apologise, though she vaguely envied and admired it, she herself\r\nspending much of her time in making excuses for obnoxious acts she had\r\nnot committed. Mrs. Bowerbank, however, was not arrogant, she was only\r\nmassive and muscular; and after she had taken her timorous friends\r\nin tow the dressmaker was able to comfort herself with the reflexion\r\nthat even so masterful a woman couldn\xe2\x80\x99t inflict anything gratuitously\r\ndisagreeable on a person who had made her visit in Lomax Place pass off\r\nso pleasantly.\r\n\r\nIt was on the outskirts of the infirmary she had been hovering, and\r\nit was into certain dismal chambers dedicated to sick criminals she\r\npresently ushered her guests. These chambers were naked and grated,\r\nlike all the rest of the place, and caused Miss Pynsent to say to\r\nherself that it must be a blessing to be ill in such a hole, because\r\nyou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly pick up again, whereby your case was simple. Such\r\nsimplification, nevertheless, had for the moment been offered to very\r\nfew of Florentine\xe2\x80\x99s fellow-sufferers, for only three of the small stiff\r\nbeds were occupied\xe2\x80\x94occupied by white-faced women in tight, sordid caps,\r\non whom, in the stale ugly room, the sallow light itself seemed to rest\r\nwithout pity. Mrs. Bowerbank discreetly paid no attention whatever to\r\nHyacinth; she only said to Miss Pynsent with her hoarse distinctness:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find her very low; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have waited another day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd she guided them, through a still further door, to the smallest\r\nroom of all, where there were but three beds placed in a row. Miss\r\nPynsent\xe2\x80\x99s frightened eyes rather faltered than inquired, but she became\r\naware that a woman was lying on the middle bed and that her face was\r\nturned toward the door. Mrs. Bowerbank led the way straight up to her\r\nand, giving a businesslike pat to her pillow, signed invitation and\r\nencouragement to the visitors, who clung together not far within the\r\nthreshold. Their conductress reminded them that very few minutes were\r\nallowed them and that they had better not dawdle them away; whereupon,\r\nas the boy still hung back, the little dressmaker advanced alone,\r\nlooking at the sick woman with what courage she could muster. It seemed\r\nto her she was approaching a perfect stranger, so completely had nine\r\nyears of prison transformed Florentine. She felt it immediately to\r\nhave been a mercy she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told Hyacinth she was pretty (as she used\r\nto be) since there was no beauty left in the hollow bloodless mask\r\nthat presented itself without a movement. She _had_ told him the poor\r\nwoman was good, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t look so, nor evidently was he struck\r\nwith it as he returned her gaze across the interval he declined to\r\ntraverse, though kept at the same time from retreating by this appeal\r\nof her strange, fixed eyes, the only part of all her wasted person in\r\nwhich was still any appearance of life. She looked unnatural to Amanda\r\nPynsent, and terribly old; a speechless, motionless creature, dazed and\r\nstupid, whereas Florentine Vivier, in the obliterated past, had been\r\nher idea of personal as distinguished from social brilliancy. Above all\r\nshe seemed disfigured and ugly, cruelly misrepresented by her coarse\r\ncap and short rough hair. Amanda, as she stood beside her, thought\r\nwith a degree of scared elation that Hyacinth would never guess that a\r\nperson in whom there was so little trace of smartness, or of cleverness\r\nof any kind, was his mother, which would be quite another matter. At\r\nthe very most it might occur to him, as Mrs. Bowerbank had suggested,\r\nthat she was his grandmother. Mrs. Bowerbank seated herself on the\r\nfurther bed with folded hands, a monumental timekeeper, and remarked,\r\nin the manner of one speaking from a sense of duty, that the poor thing\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get much good of the child unless he showed more confidence.\r\nThis observation was evidently lost on the boy; he was too intensely\r\nabsorbed in watching the prisoner. A chair had been placed near her\r\npillow, and Miss Pynsent sat down without her appearing to notice it.\r\nIn a moment, however, she lifted her hand a little, pushing it out from\r\nunder the coverlet, and the dressmaker laid her own hand softly on it.\r\nThis gesture elicited no response, but after a little, still gazing at\r\nthe boy, Florentine murmured in words no one present was in a position\r\nto understand\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Dieu de Dieu, qu\xe2\x80\x99il est donc beau!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t speak nothing but French since she has been so bad\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget a natural word out of her,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bowerbank said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt used to be so pretty when she spoke her odd English\xe2\x80\x94and so very\r\namusing,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent ventured to mention with a feeble attempt to\r\nbrighten up the scene. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose she has forgotten it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may well have forgotten it\xe2\x80\x94she never gave her tongue much\r\nexercise. There was little enough trouble to keep _her_ from\r\nchattering,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bowerbank rejoined, giving a twitch to the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncounterpane. Miss Pynsent settled it a little on the other side and\r\nconsidered, in the same train, that this separation of language was\r\nindeed a mercy; for how could it ever come into her small companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead that he was the offspring of a person who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t so much as say\r\ngood-morning to him? She felt at the same time that the scene might\r\nhave been somewhat less painful if they had been able to communicate\r\nwith the object of their compassion. As it was they had too much the\r\nair of having been brought together simply to look at each other, and\r\nthere was a gruesome awkwardness in that, considering the delicacy\r\nof Florentine\xe2\x80\x99s position. Not indeed that she looked much at her old\r\ncomrade; it was as if she were conscious of Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s being there\r\nand would have been glad to thank her for it\xe2\x80\x94glad even to examine her\r\nfor her own sake and see what change for her too the horrible years had\r\nbrought, yet felt, more than this, how she had but the thinnest pulse\r\nof energy left and how not a moment that could still be of use to her\r\nwas too much to take in her child. She took him in with all the glazed\r\nentreaty of her eyes, quite giving up his substituted guardian, who\r\nevidently would have to take her gratitude for granted. Hyacinth, on\r\nhis side, after some moments of embarrassing silence\xe2\x80\x94there was nothing\r\naudible but Mrs. Bowerbank\xe2\x80\x99s breathing\xe2\x80\x94had satisfied himself, and he\r\nturned about to look for a place of patience while Miss Pynsent should\r\nfinish her business, which as yet made so little show. He appeared to\r\nwish not to leave the room altogether, as that would be the confession\r\nof a broken spirit, but to take some attitude that should express\r\nhis complete disapproval of the unpleasant situation. He was not in\r\nsympathy, and he could not have made it more clear than by the way he\r\npresently went and placed himself on a low stool in a corner near the\r\ndoor by which they had entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Est-il possible, mon Dieu, qu\xe2\x80\x99il soit gentil comme \xc3\xa7a?_\xe2\x80\x9d his mother\r\nmoaned just above her breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re very glad you should have cared\xe2\x80\x94that they look after you so\r\nwell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Pynsent confusedly and at random; feeling first\r\nthat Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s coldness was perhaps excessive and his scepticism too\r\nmarked, and then that allusions to the way the poor woman was looked\r\nafter were not exactly happy. These didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, however, for she\r\nevidently heard nothing, giving no sign of interest even when Mrs.\r\nBowerbank, in a tone between a desire to make the interview more\r\nlively and an idea of showing she know how to treat the young, referred\r\nherself to the little boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there nothing the little gentleman would like to say, now, to\r\nthe unfortunate? Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he any pleasant remark to make to her about\r\nhis coming so far to see her when she\xe2\x80\x99s so sunk? It isn\xe2\x80\x99t often that\r\nchildren are shown over the place (as the little man has been) and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s many that\xe2\x80\x99d think themselves lucky if they could see what he\r\nhas seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon pauvre joujou, mon pauvre ch\xc3\xa9ri_,\xe2\x80\x9d the prisoner went on in her\r\ntender, tragic whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe only wants to be very good; he always sits that way at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Pynsent, alarmed at Mrs. Bowerbank\xe2\x80\x99s address and hoping there\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might have stayed at home then\xe2\x80\x94with this wretched person taking on\r\nso over him,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bowerbank remarked with some sternness. She plainly\r\nfelt the occasion threaten to be wanting in brilliancy, and wished to\r\nintimate that though she was to be trusted for discipline she thought\r\nthey were all getting off too easily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came because Pinnie brought me,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth spoke up from his\r\nlow perch. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought at first it would be pleasant. But it ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npleasant\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t like prisons.\xe2\x80\x9d And he placed his little feet on the\r\ncrosspiece of the stool as if to touch the institution at as few points\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nThe woman in bed continued her strange, almost whining plaint. \xe2\x80\x9c_Il ne\r\nveut pas s\xe2\x80\x99approcher, il a honte de moi._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a many who begin like that!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Mrs. Bowerbank, irritated\r\nby the boy\xe2\x80\x99s contempt for one of Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s finest establishments.\r\n\r\nHyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s little white face exhibited no confusion; he only turned it\r\nto the prisoner again, and Miss Pynsent felt that some extraordinary\r\ndumb exchange of meanings was taking place between them. \xe2\x80\x9cShe used\r\nto be so elegant; she _was_ a fine woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed gently and\r\nhelplessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Il a honte de moi\xe2\x80\x94il a honte, Dieu le pardonne!_\xe2\x80\x9d Florentine Vivier\r\nwent on, never moving her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s asking for something, in her language. I used to know a few\r\nwords,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Pynsent, stroking down the bed very nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that woman? what does she want?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth broke out again, his\r\nsmall, clear voice ringing over the dreary room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants you to come near her, she wants to kiss you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nBowerbank, as if it were more than he deserved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t kiss her; Pinnie says she stole a watch!\xe2\x80\x9d the child answered\r\nwith resolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you dreadful\xe2\x80\x94how could you ever?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pinnie, blushing all over\r\nand starting out of her chair.\r\n\r\nIt was partly Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s agitation perhaps, which by the jolt it\r\nadministered gave an impulse to the sick woman, and partly the\r\npenetrating and expressive tone in which Hyacinth announced his\r\nrepugnance: at any rate Florentine, in the most unexpected and violent\r\nmanner, jerked herself up from her pillow and, with dilated eyes and\r\nprotesting hands, shrieked out, \xe2\x80\x9c_Ah quelle infamie!_ I never stole\r\na watch, I never stole anything\xe2\x80\x94anything! _Ah par exemple!_\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nshe fell back sobbing with the passion that had given her a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you needn\xe2\x80\x99t put more on her than she has by rights,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Bowerbank with dignity to the dressmaker, and laid a large red\r\nhand on the patient to keep her in her place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy, more? I thought it so much less!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Pynsent, convulsed\r\nwith confusion and jerking herself in a wild tremor from the mother to\r\nthe child, as if she wished to fling herself on the one for contrition\r\nand the other for revenge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Il a honte de moi\xe2\x80\x94il a honte de moi!_\xe2\x80\x9d Florentine repeated in the\r\nmisery of her sobs. \xe2\x80\x9c_Dieu de bont\xc3\xa9, quelle horreur!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Pynsent dropped on her knees beside the bed and, trying to possess\r\nherself of the unfortunate\xe2\x80\x99s hand again, protested with an almost\r\nequal passion (she felt that her nerves had been screwed up to the\r\nsnapping-point, and now they were all in shreds) that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t meant\r\nwhat she had told the child, that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t understood, that Florentine\r\nherself hadn\xe2\x80\x99t understood, that she had only said she had been accused\r\nand meant that no one had ever believed it. The Frenchwoman paid\r\nno attention to her whatever, and Amanda buried her face and her\r\nembarrassment in the side of the hard little prison-bed, while, above\r\nthe sound of their common lamentation, she heard the judicial tones of\r\nMrs. Bowerbank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child\xe2\x80\x99s delicate\xe2\x80\x94you might well say! I\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed in the\r\neffect\xe2\x80\x94I was in hopes you\xe2\x80\x99d hearten her up. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99ll be down on\r\n_me_ of course for putting her in such a state, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll just pass out\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry I made you cry. And you must pardon Pinnie\xe2\x80\x94I asked her\r\nso many questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words came from close beside the prostrate dressmaker, who,\r\nlifting herself quickly, found the little boy had advanced to her elbow\r\nand was taking a nearer view of the mysterious captive. They produced\r\non the latter an effect even more powerful than his misguided speech\r\nof a moment before; for she found strength partly to raise herself in\r\nher bed again and to hold out her arms to him with the same thrilling\r\nsobs. She was talking still, but had become quite inarticulate, and\r\nMiss Pynsent had but a glimpse of her white ravaged face and the\r\nhollows of its eyes and the rude crop of her hair. Amanda caught the\r\nchild with an eagerness almost as great as Florentine\xe2\x80\x99s and, drawing\r\nhim to the head of the bed, pushed him into his mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms. \xe2\x80\x9cKiss\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94kiss her well, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go home!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered desperately while\r\nthey closed about him and the poor dishonoured head pressed itself\r\nagainst his young cheek. It was a terrible, irresistible embrace, to\r\nwhich Hyacinth submitted with instant patience. Mrs. Bowerbank had\r\ntried at first to keep her sad charge from rising, evidently wishing\r\nto abbreviate the scene; then as the child was enfolded she accepted\r\nthe situation and gave judicious support from behind, with an eye to\r\nclearing the room as soon as this effort should have spent itself. She\r\npropped up her patient with a vigorous arm; Miss Pynsent rose from her\r\nknees and turned away, and there was a minute\xe2\x80\x99s stillness during which\r\nthe boy accommodated himself as he might to his strange ordeal. What\r\nthoughts were begotten at that moment in his wondering little mind his\r\nprotectress was destined to learn at another time. Before she had faced\r\nround to the bed again she was swept out of the room by Mrs. Bowerbank,\r\nwho had lowered the prisoner, exhausted and with closed eyes, to her\r\npillow and given Hyacinth a businesslike little push which sent him on\r\nin advance. Miss Pynsent went home in a cab\xe2\x80\x94she was so shaken; though\r\nshe reflected very nervously, getting into it, on the opportunities it\r\nwould give Hyacinth for the exercise of inquisitorial rights. To her\r\nsurprise, however, he completely neglected them; he sat looking out of\r\nthe window in silence till they re-entered Lomax Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to guess my name before I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl\r\nsaid with a free laugh, pushing her way into the narrow hall and\r\nleaning against the tattered wall-paper which, representing blocks of\r\nmarble with bevelled edges, in streaks and speckles of black and grey,\r\nhad not been renewed for years and came back to her out of the past. As\r\nMiss Pynsent closed the door, seeing her visitor so resolute, the light\r\nfiltered in from the street through the narrow dusty glass above, and\r\nthen the very smell and sense of the place returned to Millicent: the\r\nimpression of a musty dimness with a small steep staircase at the end,\r\ncovered with the very strip of oilcloth she could recognise and made\r\na little less dark by a window in the turn (you could see it from the\r\nhall) where you might almost bump your head against the house behind.\r\nNothing was changed but Miss Pynsent and of course the girl herself.\r\nShe had noticed outside how the sign between the windows had not even\r\nbeen touched up; there was still the same preposterous announcement\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cfashionable bonnets\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as if the poor little dressmaker had the\r\nslightest acquaintance with that style of head-dress, of which Miss\r\nHenning\xe2\x80\x99s own knowledge was now so complete. She could see this artist\r\nwas looking at her hat, a wonderful composition of flowers and ribbons;\r\nher eyes had travelled up and down Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s whole person, but they\r\nrested in fascination on that grandest ornament. The girl had forgotten\r\nhow small the dressmaker was; she barely came up to her shoulder. She\r\nhad lost her hair and wore a cap which Millicent noticed in return,\r\nwondering if it were a specimen of what she thought the fashion. Miss\r\nPynsent stared up at her as if she had been six feet high; but she was\r\nused to that sort of surprised admiration, being perfectly conscious\r\nshe was a magnificent young woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you take me into your shop?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to order\r\nanything; I only want to inquire after your \xe2\x80\x99ealth. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this rather\r\nan awkward place to talk?\xe2\x80\x9d She made her way further in without waiting\r\nfor permission, seeing that her startled hostess had not yet guessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe show-room\xe2\x80\x99s on the right hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Pynsent with her\r\nprofessional manner, which was intended evidently to mark a difference.\r\nShe spoke as if on the other side, where the horizon was bounded by\r\nthe partition of the next house, there were labyrinths of apartments.\r\nPassing in after her guest she found the young lady already spread out\r\nupon the sofa, the everlasting sofa in the right-hand corner as you\r\nfaced the window, a piece of furniture covered with a tight shrunken\r\nshroud of strange yellow stuff, the tinge of which revealed years of\r\nwashing, and surmounted by a coloured print of Rebekah at the Well,\r\nbalancing, in the opposite quarter, against a portrait of the Empress\r\nof the French taken from an illustrated newspaper and framed and glazed\r\nin the manner of 1853. Millicent looked about, asking herself what Miss\r\nPynsent had to show and acting perfectly the part of the most brilliant\r\nfigure the place had ever contained. The old implements were there on\r\nthe table: the pincushions and needle-books, the pink measuring-tape\r\nwith which, as children, she and Hyacinth used to take each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheight; and the same collection of fashion-plates (she could see in a\r\nminute) crumpled, sallow and fly-blown. The little dressmaker bristled,\r\nas she used to do, with needles and pins stuck all over the front of\r\nher dress\xe2\x80\x94they might almost have figured the stiff sparse fur of a\r\nsick animal; but there were no rustling fabrics tossed in heaps over\r\nthe room\xe2\x80\x94nothing but the skirt of a shabby dress (it might have been\r\nher own) which she was evidently repairing and had flung upon the\r\ntable when she came to the door. Miss Henning speedily arrived at the\r\nconclusion that her old friend\xe2\x80\x99s business had not increased, and felt\r\nsome safe luxurious scorn of a person who knew so little what was to\r\nbe got out of London. It was Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s belief that she herself was\r\nalready perfectly acquainted with the resources of the capital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow tell me, how\xe2\x80\x99s old Hyacinth? I should like so much to see him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe remarked while she extended a pair of large protrusive feet and\r\nsupported herself on the sofa by her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Hyacinth?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent repeated with majestic blankness and as if\r\nshe had never heard of such a person. She felt the girl to be cruelly,\r\nscathingly well dressed and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine who she was nor with what\r\ndesign she might have presented herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you call him Mr. Robinson to-day\xe2\x80\x94you always wanted him to hold\r\nhimself so high. But to his face at any rate I\xe2\x80\x99ll call him as I used\r\nto: you just see if I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my soul, you must be the awful little \xe2\x80\x99Enning!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent\r\nexclaimed, planted before her and going now into every detail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve made up your mind. I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d know me\r\ndirectly and I daresay I _was_ awful. But I ain\xe2\x80\x99t so bad now, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe young woman went on with confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a call to make in this\r\npart, and it came into my \xe2\x80\x99ead to look you up. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to lose\r\nsight of old friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never knew you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve improved as I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMiss Pynsent returned with a candour justified by her age and her\r\nconsciousness of respectability.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _you_ haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed; you were always calling me something\r\nhorrid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to you now, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the dressmaker,\r\nseating herself but quite unable to take up her work, blank as she was\r\nbefore the greatness of her visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m all right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Henning declared with the air of one who\r\nhad nothing to fear from human judgements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were a pretty child\xe2\x80\x94I never said the contrary to that; but I\r\nhad no idea you\xe2\x80\x99d turn out like this. You\xe2\x80\x99re too tall for a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMiss Pynsent added, much divided between an old prejudice and a new\r\nappreciation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I enjoy beautiful \xe2\x80\x99ealth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady; \xe2\x80\x9cevery one\r\nthinks I\xe2\x80\x99m at least twenty-two.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke with a certain artless pride\r\nin her bigness and her bloom and as if, to show her development, she\r\nwould have taken off her jacket or let you feel her upper arm. She was\r\ncertainly handsome, with a shining, bold, good-natured eye, a fine,\r\nfree, physiognomic oval, an abundance of brown hair and a smile that\r\nfairly flaunted the whiteness of her teeth. Her head was set on a fair\r\nstrong neck and her robust young figure was rich in feminine curves.\r\nHer gloves, covering her wrists insufficiently, showed the redness\r\nof those parts in the interstices of the numerous silver bracelets\r\nthat encircled them, and Miss Pynsent made the observation that her\r\nhands were not more delicate than her feet. She was not graceful, and\r\neven the little dressmaker, whose preference for distinguished forms\r\nnever deserted her, indulged in the mental reflexion that she was\r\ncommon, despite her magnificence; but there was something about her\r\nindescribably fresh, successful and satisfying. She was to her blunt,\r\nexpanded finger-tips a daughter of London, of the crowded streets\r\nand bustling traffic of the great city; she had drawn her health and\r\nstrength from its dingy courts and foggy thoroughfares and peopled\r\nits parks and squares and crescents with her ambitions; it had entered\r\ninto her blood and her bone, the sound of her voice and the carriage\r\nof her head; she understood it by instinct and loved it with passion;\r\nshe represented its immense vulgarities and curiosities, its brutality\r\nand its knowingness, its good-nature and its impudence, and might\r\nhave figured, in an allegorical procession, as a kind of glorified\r\ntownswoman, a nymph of the wilderness of Middlesex, a flower of the\r\nclustered parishes, the genius of urban civilisation, the muse of\r\ncockneyism. The restrictions under which Miss Pynsent regarded her\r\nwould have cost the dressmaker some fewer scruples if she had guessed\r\nthe impression she herself made on Millicent, and how the whole place\r\nseemed to that prosperous young lady to smell of poverty and failure.\r\nHer childish image of its mistress had shown her as neat, fine,\r\nsuperior, with round loops of hair fastened on the temples by combs\r\nand associations of brilliancy arising from the constant manipulation\r\nof precious stuffs\xe2\x80\x94tissues at least that Millicent regarded with envy.\r\nBut the little woman before her was bald and white and pinched; she\r\nlooked shrunken and sickly and insufficiently nourished; her small\r\neyes were sharp and suspicious and her hideous cap didn\xe2\x80\x99t disguise the\r\nway everything had gone. Miss Henning thanked her stars, as she had\r\noften done before, that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been obliged to get _her_ living by\r\ndrudging over needlework year after year in that undiscoverable street,\r\nin a dismal little room where nothing had been changed for ages; the\r\nabsence of change had such an exasperating effect upon her vigorous\r\nyoung nature. She reflected with complacency on her good fortune in\r\nbeing attached to a more exciting, a more dramatic department of the\r\ngreat drapery interest, and noticed that though it was already November\r\nthere was no fire in the neatly-kept grate beneath the chimney-piece,\r\non which a design, partly architectural, partly botanical, executed\r\nin the hair of Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s parents, was flanked by a pair of vases,\r\nunder glass, containing muslin flowers.\r\n\r\nIf she thought that lady\xe2\x80\x99s eyes suspicious it must be confessed that\r\nher hostess felt much on her guard in presence of so unexpected and\r\nundesired a reminder of one of the least honourable episodes in the\r\nannals of Lomax Place. Miss Pynsent esteemed people in proportion\r\nto their success in constituting a family circle\xe2\x80\x94in cases, that is,\r\nwhen the materials were under their hand. This success, among the\r\nvarious members of the house of Henning, had been of the scantiest,\r\nand the domestic broils in the establishment adjacent to her own,\r\nthe vicissitudes of which she was able to follow, as she sat near her\r\nwindow at work, by simply inclining an ear to the thin partition behind\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94these scenes, rendering the crash of crockery and the imprecations\r\nof the wounded frequently and peculiarly audible, had long been the\r\nscandal of a humble but harmonious neighbourhood. Mr. Henning was\r\nsupposed to fill a place of confidence in a brush factory, while his\r\nwife, at home, occupied herself with the washing and mending of a\r\nconsiderable brood, mainly of sons. But economy and sobriety and indeed\r\na virtue more important still had never presided at their councils. The\r\nfreedom and frequency of Mrs. Henning\xe2\x80\x99s relations with a stove-polisher\r\noff the Euston Road were at least not a secret to a person who lived\r\nnext door and looked up from her work so often that it was a wonder\r\nit was always finished so quickly. The little Hennings, unwashed\r\nand unchidden, spent most of their time either in pushing each other\r\ninto the gutter or in running to the public-house at the corner for a\r\npennyworth of gin, and the borrowing propensities of their elders were\r\na theme for exclamation. There was no object of personal or domestic\r\nuse which Mrs. Henning had not at one time or another endeavoured to\r\nelicit from the dressmaker; beginning with a mattress, on an occasion\r\nwhen she was about to take to her bed for a considerable period, and\r\nending with a flannel petticoat and a pewter teapot. Lomax Place had\r\neventually, from its over-peeping windows and doorways, been present\r\nat the seizure, by a long-suffering landlord, of the chattels of this\r\ninteresting race and at the ejectment of the whole insolvent group, who\r\ndeparted in a straggling, jeering, unabashed, cynical manner, carrying\r\nwith them but little of the sympathy of the street. Millicent, whose\r\nchildish intimacy with Hyacinth Robinson Miss Pynsent had always viewed\r\nwith vague anxiety\xe2\x80\x94she thought the girl a nasty little thing and was\r\nafraid she would teach the innocent orphan low ways\xe2\x80\x94Millicent, with\r\nher luxuriant tresses, her precocious beauty, her staring, mocking\r\nmanner on the doorstep, was at this time twelve years of age. She\r\nvanished with her vanishing companions; Lomax Place saw them double\r\nthe cape, that is turn the corner, and returned to its occupations\r\nwith a conviction that they would make shipwreck on the outer reefs.\r\nBut neither spar nor splinter floated back to their former haunts,\r\nand they were engulfed altogether in the fathomless deeps of the town.\r\nMiss Pynsent drew a long breath; it was her judgement that none of them\r\nwould come to any good whatever, and Millicent least of all.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore this young lady reappeared with all the signs of\r\naccomplished survival she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fail to ask herself whether, under\r\na specious seeming, the phenomenon didn\xe2\x80\x99t simply represent the triumph\r\nof vice. She was alarmed, but she would have given her silver thimble\r\nto know the girl\xe2\x80\x99s history, and between her shock and her curiosity she\r\npassed an uncomfortable half-hour. She felt the familiar mysterious\r\ncreature to be playing with her; revenging herself for former\r\nanimadversions, for having been snubbed and miscalled by a prying\r\nlittle spinster who could now make no figure beside her. If it was not\r\nthe triumph of vice it was at least the triumph of impertinence, as\r\nwell as of youth, health and a greater acquaintance with the art of\r\ndress than Miss Pynsent could boast, for all her ridiculous signboards.\r\nShe perceived, or she believed she perceived, that Millicent wanted\r\nto scare her, to make her think she had come after Hyacinth, that she\r\nwished to get hold of him and somehow mislead and tempt him. I should\r\nbe sorry to impute to Miss Henning any motive more complicated than\r\nthe desire to amuse herself, of a Saturday afternoon, by a ramble her\r\nvigorous legs had no occasion to deprecate; but it must be confessed\r\nthat with her shrewd guess of this estimate of her as a ravening wolf\r\nand of her early playmate as an unspotted lamb she laughed out, in\r\nMiss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s anxious face, irrelevantly and good-humouredly and\r\nwithout deigning to explain. But what indeed had she come for if she\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t come for Hyacinth? It was not for the love of the dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretty ways. She remembered the boy and some of their tender passages,\r\nand in the wantonness of her full-blown freedom\xe2\x80\x94her attachment also\r\nto any tolerable pretext for wandering through the streets of London\r\nand gazing into shop-windows\xe2\x80\x94had said to herself she might dedicate\r\nan afternoon to the pleasures of memory, might revisit the scenes\r\nof her childhood. She considered that her childhood had ended with\r\nthe departure of her family from Lomax Place. If the tenants of that\r\nscarce-dissimulated slum had never learned what their banished fellows\r\nwere to go through she herself had at least retained a deep impression\r\nof those horrible intermediate years. The family, as a family, had gone\r\ndownhill, to the very bottom; and in her humbler moments Millicent\r\nsometimes wondered what lucky star had checked her own descent and\r\nindeed enabled her to mount the slope again. In her humbler moments,\r\nI say, for as a general thing she was provided with an explanation\r\nof any good fortune that might befall her. What was more natural than\r\nthat a girl should achieve miracles when she was at once so handsome\r\nand so clever? Millicent thought with compassion of the young persons\r\nwhom a niggardly fate had endowed with only one of these advantages.\r\nShe was good-natured, but she had no idea of gratifying Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncuriosity: it seemed to her quite a sufficient kindness to stimulate\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShe told the dressmaker she had a high position at a great\r\nhaberdasher\xe2\x80\x99s in the neighbourhood of Buckingham Palace; she was in\r\nthe department for jackets and mantles; she put on all these articles\r\nto show them off to the customers, and on her person they appeared to\r\nsuch advantage that nothing she took up ever failed to go off. Miss\r\nPynsent could imagine from this how highly her services were prized.\r\nShe had had a splendid offer from another establishment, an immense\r\none in Oxford Street, and was just thinking if she should accept it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to be beautifully dressed, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, because I like\r\nto look nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked to her hostess, who at the end of half an\r\nhour, very grave behind the clumsy glasses she had been obliged to wear\r\nof late years, seemed still not to know what to make of her. On the\r\nsubject of her parents, of her history during the interval that was to\r\nbe accounted for, the girl was large and vague, and Miss Pynsent saw\r\nthat the domestic circle had not even a shadow of sanctity for her.\r\nShe stood on her own feet\xe2\x80\x94stood very firm. Her staying so long, her\r\nremaining over the half-hour, proved she had come for Hyacinth, since\r\npoor Amanda gave her as little information as was decent, told her\r\nnothing that would encourage or attract. She simply mentioned that Mr.\r\nRobinson (she was careful to speak of him in that manner) had given his\r\nattention to bookbinding and had served an apprenticeship in a house\r\nwhere they turned out the best work of that kind that was to be found\r\nin London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bookbindery? Laws!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Henning. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean they get them\r\nup for the shops? Well, I always thought he would have something to do\r\nwith books.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he would ever follow\r\na trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA trade?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Pynsent. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should hear Mr. Robinson speak of\r\nit. He considers it too lovely, quite one of the fine arts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMillicent smiled as if she knew how people often considered things,\r\nand remarked that very likely it was tidy comfortable work, but she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe there was much to be seen in it. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsay there\xe2\x80\x99s more than there is here,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, finding at last an\r\neffect of irritation, or reprehension, an implication of aggressive\r\nrespectability, in the image of the patient dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s sitting for so\r\nmany years in her close brown little den with the foggy familiarities\r\nof Lomax Place on the other side of the pane. Millicent liked to think\r\nshe herself was strong, yet she was not strong enough for that.\r\n\r\nThis allusion to her shrunken industry seemed to Miss Pynsent very\r\ncruel; but she reflected it was natural one should be insulted if one\r\ntalked to a vulgar girl. She judged this young lady in the manner of\r\na person who was not vulgar herself, and if there was a difference\r\nbetween them she was right in feeling it to be in her favour. Miss\r\nPynsent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccut,\xe2\x80\x9d as I have intimated, was not truly fashionable, and\r\nin the application of gimp and the matching of colours she was not\r\nabsolutely to be trusted; but morally she had the best taste in the\r\nworld. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t so much work as I used to have, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\r\nmean. My eyes are not so good and my health has failed with advancing\r\nyears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI know not to what extent Millicent was touched by the dignity of\r\nthis admission, but she replied without embarrassment that what Miss\r\nPynsent wanted was a smart young assistant, some nice girl of a \xe2\x80\x9ctasty\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nturn who would brighten up the business and give her new ideas. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan see you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the same old ones, always: I can tell that by the\r\nway you\xe2\x80\x99ve stuck the braid on that dress\xe2\x80\x9d; and she directed a poke of\r\nher neat little umbrella at the drapery in the dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s lap. She\r\ncontinued to patronise and exasperate her, and to offer her consolation\r\nand encouragement with the heaviest hand that had ever been applied to\r\nMiss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s sensitive surface. Poor Amanda ended by gazing at her as\r\nif she had been a public performer of some kind, a ballad-singer or a\r\nconjurer, and went so far as to ask herself whether the creature could\r\nbe (in her own mind) the \xe2\x80\x9cnice girl\xe2\x80\x9d who was to regild the tarnished\r\nsign. Miss Pynsent had had assistants in the past\xe2\x80\x94she had even once,\r\nfor a few months, had a \xe2\x80\x9cforewoman\xe2\x80\x9d; and some of these damsels had been\r\nprecious specimens, whose misdemeanours lived vividly in her memory.\r\nNever, all the same, in her worst hour of delusion, had she trusted\r\nher interests to such an exponent of the latest thing as this. She was\r\nquickly reassured as to Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s own views, perceiving more and more\r\nthat she was a tremendous highflyer, who required a much larger field\r\nof action than the musty bower she now honoured, goodness only knew\r\nwhy, with her presence. Miss Pynsent held her tongue as she always did\r\nwhen the sorrow of her life had been touched, the thought of the slow,\r\ninexorable decline on which she had entered that day, nearly ten years\r\nbefore, when her hesitations and scruples resolved themselves into\r\na hideous mistake. The deep conviction of error on this unspeakably\r\nimportant occasion had ached and throbbed within her ever since like\r\nan incurable disease. She had sown in her boy\xe2\x80\x99s mind the seeds of\r\nshame and rancour; she had made him conscious of his stigma, of his\r\nexquisitely vulnerable spot, and condemned him to know that for him\r\nthe sun would never shine as it shone for most others. By the time he\r\nwas sixteen years old she had learned\xe2\x80\x94or believed she had learned\xe2\x80\x94the\r\njudgement he had passed on her, and at that period she had lived\r\nthrough a series of horrible months, an ordeal in which every element\r\nof her old prosperity perished. She cried her eyes out, on coming to\r\na sense of her blunder, so blinded and weakened herself with weeping\r\nthat she might for a while have believed she should never be able to\r\ntouch a needle again. She lost all interest in her work, and that play\r\nof invention which had always been her pride deserted her, together\r\nwith the reputation of keeping the tidiest lodgings in Lomax Place.\r\nA couple of commercial gentlemen and a Welsh plumber of religious\r\ntendencies who for several years had made her establishment their home\r\nwithdrew their patronage on the ground that the airing of her beds\r\nwas not what it used to be, and disseminated cruelly this injurious\r\nlegend. She ceased to notice or to care how sleeves were worn, and on\r\nthe question of flounces and gores her mind was a blank. She fell into\r\na grievous debility and then into a long, low, languid fever, during\r\nwhich Hyacinth tended her with a devotion that only made the wrong she\r\nhad done him seem sharper, and that determined in Mr. Vetch, so soon as\r\nshe was able to hold up her head a little, the impulse to come and sit\r\nwith her through the dull hours of convalescence. She re-established to\r\na certain extent, after a time, her connexion, so far as the letting of\r\nher rooms was concerned (from the other department of her activity the\r\ntide had ebbed apparently for ever); but nothing was the same again,\r\nand she knew it was the beginning of the end. So it had gone on, and\r\nshe watched the end approach; she felt it very near indeed when a child\r\nshe had seen playing in the gutters came to flaunt it over her in silk\r\nand lace. She gave a low, inaudible sigh of relief as Millicent at last\r\ngot up and stood there, smoothing the glossy cylinder of her umbrella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind you give my love to Hyacinth,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said with an assurance\r\nwhich showed all her insensibility to tacit protests. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care if\r\nyou do guess that if I\xe2\x80\x99ve stopped so long it was in the hope he would\r\nbe dropping in to his tea. You can tell him I sat an hour, on purpose,\r\nif you like; there\xe2\x80\x99s no shame in my wanting to see my childhood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsweetheart. He may know I call him that!\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent continued with\r\nher showroom laugh, as Miss Pynsent judged it to be; conferring these\r\npermissions, successively, as if they were great indulgences. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\ngive him my best love and tell him I hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll come and see me. I see\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t tell him anything. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of; but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave my card for him, all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d She drew forth a little\r\nbright-coloured pocket-book, and it was with amazement that Miss\r\nPynsent saw her extract from it a morsel of engraved pasteboard\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nmonstrous did it seem that one of the squalid little Hennings should\r\nhave lived to display this emblem of social consideration. Millicent\r\nenjoyed the effect she produced as she laid the card on the table,\r\nand gave another ringing peal of mirth at the sight of her hostess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhalf-hungry, half-astonished look. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat _do_ you think I want to do\r\nwith him? I could swallow him at a single bite!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nPoor Amanda gave no second glance at the document on the table, though\r\nshe had perceived it contained, in the corner, her visitor\xe2\x80\x99s address,\r\nwhich Millicent had amused herself ingeniously with not mentioning: she\r\nonly got up, laying down her work with an agitated hand, so that she\r\nshould be able to see Miss Henning well out of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I shall put myself out to keep him in the dark. I shall certainly\r\ntell him you\xe2\x80\x99ve been here, and exactly how you strike me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you\xe2\x80\x99ll say something nasty\xe2\x80\x94like you used to when I was a\r\nchild. You usually let me \xe2\x80\x99ave it then, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Pynsent, nettled at this reminder of an acerbity\r\nwhich the girl\xe2\x80\x99s present development caused to appear absurdly\r\nineffectual, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re very different now, when I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve come\r\nfrom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve come from?\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent threw back her head and opened her\r\neyes very wide, while all her feathers and ribbons nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you\r\nwant me to stick fast in this low place for the rest of my days? You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad to stay in it yourself, so you might speak civilly of it.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ncoloured and raised her voice and looked magnificent in her scorn. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\npray what have you come from yourself, and what has _he_ come from\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmysterious \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Robinson\xe2\x80\x99 who used to be such a puzzle to the whole\r\nPlice? I thought perhaps I might clear it up, but you haven\xe2\x80\x99t told me\r\nthat yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Pynsent turned straight away, covering her ears with her hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to tell you! Leave my room\xe2\x80\x94leave my house!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried\r\nwith a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in this way she failed either to see or to hear the opening\r\nof the door of the room, which obeyed a slow, apparently cautious\r\nimpulse given it from the hall and revealed the figure of a young man\r\nstanding there with a short pipe in his teeth. There was something\r\nin his face which immediately told Millicent Henning he had heard her\r\nlast tones resound into the passage. He entered as if, young as he was,\r\nhe knew that when women were squabbling men were not called upon to\r\nbe headlong, and now evidently wondered who the dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s evident\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmatch\xe2\x80\x9d might be. She recognised on the instant her old playmate,\r\nand without reflexion, confusion or diplomacy, in the fulness of her\r\nvulgarity and sociability, exclaimed at no lower pitch: \xe2\x80\x9cGracious,\r\nHyacinth Robinson, is _that_ your form?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Pynsent turned round in a flash, but kept silent; then, very white\r\nand shaken, took up her work again and seated herself in her window.\r\nHyacinth on his side stood staring\xe2\x80\x94he blushed all over. He knew who she\r\nwas but didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so; he only asked in a voice which struck the girl\r\nas quite different from the old one\xe2\x80\x94the one in which he used to tell\r\nher she was beastly tiresome\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIs it of me you were speaking just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I asked where you had come from? That was because we \xe2\x80\x99eard you\r\nin the \xe2\x80\x99all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Millicent, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve come from your\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou used to live in the Place\xe2\x80\x94you always wanted to kiss me,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nyoung man remarked with an effort not to show all the surprise and\r\nsatisfaction he felt. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t she live in the Place, Pinnie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPinnie, for all answer, fixed a pair of strange pleading eyes upon\r\nhim, and Millicent broke out, with her recurrent laugh, in which the\r\ndressmaker had been right in discovering the note of affectation, \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou want to know what you look like? You look for all the world like\r\na little plastered-up Frenchman! Don\xe2\x80\x99t he look like a funny little\r\nFrenchman, Miss Pynsent?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on as if she were on the best\r\npossible terms with the mistress of the establishment.\r\n\r\nHyacinth caught a light from that afflicted woman; he saw something\r\nin her face that he knew very well by this time and in the sight of\r\nwhich he always found an odd, perverse, unholy relish. It seemed to say\r\nthat she prostrated herself, that she did penance in the dust, that\r\nshe was his to trample upon, to spit upon. He did neither of these\r\nthings, but she was constantly offering herself, and her permanent\r\nhumility, her perpetual abjection, was a vague counter-irritant to\r\nthe soreness lodged in his own heart for ever and which had often at\r\nnight made him cry with rage in his little room under the roof. Pinnie\r\nmeant this to-day as a matter of course, and could only especially mean\r\nit in the presence of Miss Henning\xe2\x80\x99s remark about his looking like a\r\nFrenchman. He knew he looked like a Frenchman, he had often been told\r\nso before, and a large part of the time, often quite grandly, he felt\r\nlike one\xe2\x80\x94like one of those he had read about in Michelet and Carlyle.\r\nHe had picked up their language with the most extraordinary facility,\r\nby the aid of one of his mates, a refugee from Paris, in the workroom,\r\nand of a second-hand dog\xe2\x80\x99s-eared dictionary bought for a shilling in\r\nthe Brompton Road during one of his interminable, restless, melancholy,\r\nmoody, yet all-observant strolls through London. He spoke it, he\r\nbelieved, by a natural impulse, caught the accent, the gesture, the\r\nmovement of eyebrow and shoulder; so that on any occasion of his having\r\nto pass for a foreigner\xe2\x80\x94there was no telling what might happen\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nshould certainly be able to do so to admiration, especially if he could\r\nborrow a blouse. He had never seen a blouse in his life, but he knew\r\nexactly the form and colour of such a garment and how it was worn.\r\nWhat the complications might be which should compel him to assume the\r\ndisguise of a person of a social station lower still than his own he\r\nwould not for the world have mentioned to you; but as they were very\r\npresent to the mind of our imaginative, ingenious youth we shall catch\r\na glimpse of them in the course of a further acquaintance with him.\r\nActually, when there was no question of masquerading, it made him blush\r\nagain that such a note should be struck by a loud, laughing, handsome\r\ngirl who came back out of his past. There was more in Pinnie\xe2\x80\x99s weak\r\neyes now than her usual rueful profession; there was a dumb intimation,\r\nalmost as pathetic as the other, that if he cared to let her off easily\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t detain their terrible visitor very long. He had no wish\r\nto do that; he kept the door open on purpose; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy talking\r\nto girls under Pinnie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and could see that this one had every\r\ndisposition to talk. So without responding to her observation about\r\nhis appearance he said, not knowing exactly what to say: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you come\r\nback to live in the Place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid I should ever do that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Henning with genuine\r\nemotion. \xe2\x80\x9cI must live near the establishment in which I\xe2\x80\x99m employed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what establishment is that now?\xe2\x80\x9d the young man asked, gaining\r\nconfidence and perceiving in detail how handsome she was. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nroamed about London for nothing, and he knew that when a girl had such\r\nlooks a jocular tone of address, a pleasing freedom, was _de rigueur_;\r\nso he added: \xe2\x80\x9cIs it the Bull and Gate or the Elephant and Castle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA public-house? Well, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the politeness of a Frenchman at\r\nall events!\xe2\x80\x9d Her good-nature had come back to her perfectly, and her\r\nresentment of his imputation of her looking like a barmaid\xe2\x80\x94a blowsy\r\nbeauty who handled pewter\xe2\x80\x94was tempered by her more and more curious\r\nconsideration of Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s form. He was exceedingly \xe2\x80\x9crum,\xe2\x80\x9d but he had\r\na stamp as sharp for her as that of a new coin and which also agreeably\r\nsuggested value. Since he remembered so well that she had been fond of\r\nkissing him in their early days she would have liked to show herself\r\nprepared to repeat this graceful attention. But she reminded herself\r\nin time that her line should be religiously the ladylike, and she was\r\ncontent to exclaim simply: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what a man looks like so long\r\nas he knows a lot. That\xe2\x80\x99s the form _I_ like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Pynsent had promised herself the satisfaction of taking no further\r\nnotice of her brilliant invader; but the temptation was great to\r\nexpose her to Hyacinth, in mitigation of her brilliancy, by remarking\r\nsarcastically, according to opportunity, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss \xe2\x80\x99Enning wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live in\r\nLomax Plice for the world. She thinks it too dreadfully low.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is; it\xe2\x80\x99s a beastly hole,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\nThe poor dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s little dart fell to the ground and Millicent\r\nexclaimed jovially, \xe2\x80\x9cRight you are!\xe2\x80\x9d while she directed to the object\r\nof her childhood\xe2\x80\x99s admiration an expression of face that put him more\r\nand more at his ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose I know something?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, planted before her with\r\nhis little legs slightly apart and, with his hands behind him, making\r\nthe open door waver to and fro.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a straw what you know!\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and he had\r\nat any rate a mind sufficiently enriched to see what she meant by\r\nthat. If she meant he was so good-looking that he might pass on this\r\nscore alone her judgement was conceivable, though many women would\r\nstrongly have dissented from it. He was as small as he had announced\r\nfrom the first\xe2\x80\x94he had never got his growth\xe2\x80\x94and she could easily see\r\nthat he was not what she at least would call strong. His bones were\r\nsmall, his chest was narrow, his complexion pale, his whole figure\r\nalmost childishly slight; and Millicent noted afterwards that he had\r\na very delicate hand\xe2\x80\x94the hand, as she said to herself, of a gentleman.\r\nWhat she liked was his face and something jaunty and romantic, almost\r\ntheatrical, in his whole little person. Miss Henning was not acquainted\r\nwith any member of the dramatic profession, but she supposed vaguely\r\nthat that was the way an actor would look in private life. Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeatures were perfect; his eyes, large and much divided, had as their\r\nusual expression a kind of witty, almost an impertinent, candour, and\r\na small, soft, fair moustache disposed itself upon his upper lip in a\r\nway that made him appear to smile even when his heart was heavy. The\r\nwaves of his dense fine hair clustered round a forehead which was high\r\nenough to suggest remarkable things, and Miss Henning had observed\r\nthat when he first appeared he wore his little soft circular hat in\r\na way that left these frontal locks very visible. He was dressed in\r\nan old brown velveteen jacket and wore exactly the bright-coloured\r\nnecktie which Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s quick fingers used of old to shape out of\r\nhoarded remnants of silk and muslin. He was shabby and work-stained,\r\nbut an observant eye would have caught the hint of an \xe2\x80\x9carrangement\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nhis dress (his appearance being plainly not a matter of indifference\r\nto himself), while a painter (not of the heroic) would have liked to\r\nmake a sketch of him. There was something exotic in him, and yet, with\r\nhis sharp young face, destitute of bloom but not of sweetness, and a\r\ncertain conscious cockneyism that pervaded him, he was as strikingly\r\nas Millicent, in her own degree, a product of the London streets and\r\nthe London air. He looked both ingenuous and slightly wasted, amused,\r\namusing and indefinably sad. Women had always found him touching, but\r\nhe made them\xe2\x80\x94so they had repeatedly assured him\xe2\x80\x94die of laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you had better shut the door,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Pynsent, meaning that\r\nhe had better shut their departing visitor out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you come here on purpose to see us?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, not heeding\r\nthis injunction, of which he divined the spirit, and wishing the\r\ngirl would take her leave so that he might go out again with her.\r\nHe should like talking with her much better away from Pinnie, who\r\nevidently was ready to stick a bodkin into her for reasons he perfectly\r\nunderstood. He had seen plenty of them before, Pinnie\xe2\x80\x99s reasons, even\r\nwhere girls were concerned who were not nearly so good-looking as\r\nthis one. She was always in a fearful \xe2\x80\x9cfunk\xe2\x80\x9d about their getting hold\r\nof him and persuading him to make a marriage beneath his station.\r\nHis station!\xe2\x80\x94poor Hyacinth had often asked himself and inquired of\r\nMiss Pynsent what it could possibly be. He had thought of it bitterly\r\nenough, wondering how in the world he could marry \xe2\x80\x9cbeneath\xe2\x80\x9d it. He\r\nwould never marry at all\xe2\x80\x94to that his mind was absolutely made up; he\r\nwould never hand on to another the burden that had made his own young\r\nspirit so intolerably sore, the inheritance that had darkened the whole\r\nthreshold of his manhood. All the more reason why he should have his\r\ncompensation; why, if the soft society of women was to be enjoyed on\r\nother terms, he should cultivate it with a bold free mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d just give a look at the old shop; I had an engagement\r\nnot far off,\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed any one who\r\nhad told me I should find you just where I left you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe needed you to look after us!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent irrepressibly exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re such a rattling swell yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth observed without\r\nheeding the dressmaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of _your_ \xe2\x80\x98rattling\xe2\x80\x99 impudence! I\xe2\x80\x99m as good a girl as there is in\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x9d And to corroborate this Miss Henning went on: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were to\r\noffer to see me a part of the way home I\xe2\x80\x99d tell you I don\xe2\x80\x99t knock about\r\nthat way with gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you as far as you like,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth replied simply, as if\r\nhe knew how to treat that sort of speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s only because I knew you as a baby!\xe2\x80\x9d And they went out\r\ntogether, Hyacinth careful not to look at poor Pinnie at all (he felt\r\nher glaring whitely and tearfully at him out of her dim corner\xe2\x80\x94it had\r\nby this time grown too dusky to work without a lamp) and his companion\r\ngiving her a cruelly familiar nod of farewell over her shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was a long walk from Lomax Place to the quarter of the town in\r\nwhich (to be near the haberdashers of the Buckingham Palace Road) Miss\r\nHenning occupied a modest back room; but the influences of the hour\r\nwere such as to make the excursion very agreeable to our young man,\r\nwho liked the streets at all times, but especially at nightfall in the\r\nautumn, of a Saturday, when in the vulgar districts the smaller shops\r\nand open-air industries were doubly active, and big clumsy torches\r\nflared and smoked over hand-carts and costermongers\xe2\x80\x99 barrows drawn\r\nup in the gutters. Hyacinth had roamed through the great city since\r\nhe was an urchin, but his imagination had never ceased to be stirred\r\nby the preparations for Sunday that went on in the evening among the\r\ntoilers and spinners, his brothers and sisters, and he lost himself\r\nin all the quickened crowding and pushing and staring at lighted\r\nwindows and chaffering at the stalls of fishmongers and hucksters.\r\nHe liked the people who looked as if they had got their week\xe2\x80\x99s wage\r\nand were prepared to lay it out discreetly; and even those whose use\r\nof it would plainly be extravagant and intemperate; and, best of all,\r\nthose who evidently hadn\xe2\x80\x99t received it at all and who wandered about\r\ndisinterestedly and vaguely, their hands in empty pockets, watching\r\nothers make their bargains and fill their satchels, or staring at the\r\nstriated sides of bacon, at the golden cubes and triangles of cheese,\r\nat the graceful festoons of sausage, in the most brilliant of the\r\nwindows. He liked the reflexion of the lamps on the wet pavements, the\r\nfeeling and smell of the carboniferous London damp; the way the winter\r\nfog blurred and suffused the whole place, made it seem bigger and more\r\ncrowded, produced halos and dim radiations, trickles, and evaporations\r\non the plates of glass. He moved in the midst of these impressions this\r\nevening, but he enjoyed them in silence, with an attention taken up\r\nmainly by his companion, and pleased to be already so intimate with a\r\nyoung lady whom people turned round to look at. She herself affected to\r\nspeak of the rush and crush of the week\xe2\x80\x99s end with disgust: she said\r\nshe liked the streets, but liked the respectable ones; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nabide the smell of fish, which the whole place seemed full of, so that\r\nshe hoped they would soon get into the Edgeware Road, toward which\r\nthey tended and which was a proper street for a lady. To Hyacinth she\r\nappeared to have no connexion with the long-haired little girl who,\r\nin Lomax Place, years before, was always hugging a smutty doll and\r\ncourting his society; she was a stranger, a new acquaintance, and he\r\nobserved her in suspense, wondering by what transitions she had reached\r\nher present pitch.\r\n\r\nShe enlightened him but little on this point, though she talked a\r\ngreat deal on a variety of subjects and mentioned to him her habits,\r\nher aspirations, her likes and dislikes\xe2\x80\x94which last were as emphatic\r\nas the giggles of a person tickled. She was tremendously particular,\r\ndifficult to please, he could see that; and she assured him she never\r\nput up with anything a moment after she had ceased to care for it.\r\nEspecially was she particular about gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s society, and she made\r\nit plain that a young fellow who wanted to have anything to say to her\r\nmust be in receipt of wages amounting at the least to fifty shillings a\r\nweek. Hyacinth assured her he didn\xe2\x80\x99t earn that as yet, and she remarked\r\nagain that she made an exception for him because she knew all about\r\nhim (or if not all at least a great deal) and he could see that her\r\ngood-nature was equal to her beauty. She made such an exception that\r\nwhen, after they were moving down the Edgeware Road (which had still\r\nthe brightness of late closing, but with more nobleness), he proposed\r\nshe should enter a coffee-house with him and \xe2\x80\x9ctake something\xe2\x80\x9d (he\r\ncould hardly tell himself afterwards what brought him to this point)\r\nshe acceded without a demur\xe2\x80\x94without a demur even on the ground of\r\nhis slender earnings. Slender as they were he had them in his pocket\r\n(they had been destined in some degree for Pinnie) and therefore felt\r\nequal to the occasion. Millicent partook profusely of tea and bread\r\nand butter, with a relish of raspberry jam, and thought the place most\r\ncomfortable, though he himself, after finding himself ensconced, was\r\nvisited by doubts of its propriety, suggested, among several things,\r\nby photographs, on the walls, of young ladies in tights. He himself\r\nwas hungry, he had not yet had his tea, but he was too excited, too\r\npreoccupied to eat; the situation made him restless and gave him\r\nthrills; it seemed the beginning of something new and rare. He had\r\nnever yet \xe2\x80\x9cstood\xe2\x80\x9d even a glass of beer to a girl of Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s stamp\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngirl who rustled and glittered and smelt of musk\xe2\x80\x94and if she should turn\r\nout as jolly a specimen of the sex as she seemed it might make a great\r\ndifference in his leisure hours, in his evenings, in which he had often\r\nfelt a likeness to great square blackboards uninscribed with a stroke\r\nof chalk. That it would also make a difference in his savings (he was\r\nunder a pledge to Pinnie and to Mr. Vetch to put by something every\r\nweek) it didn\xe2\x80\x99t concern him for the moment to reflect; and indeed,\r\nthough he thought it odious and insufferable to be poor, the ways and\r\nmeans of ceasing to be so had hitherto left his fancy unstirred. He\r\nknew what Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s age must be, but felt her nevertheless older,\r\nmuch older, than himself\xe2\x80\x94she seemed to know so much about London\r\nand about life; and this made it still more of a sensation to be\r\nentertaining her like a young swell. He thought of it too in connexion\r\nwith the question of the character of the establishment; if this\r\ncharacter was what it easily might be she would perceive it as soon\r\nas he, and very likely it would be a part of the general initiation\r\nshe had given him an impression of that she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind so long as\r\nthe tea was strong and the bread and butter thick. She described to\r\nhim what had passed between Miss Pynsent and herself (she didn\xe2\x80\x99t call\r\nher Pinnie, and he was glad, for he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have liked it) before he\r\ncame in, and let him know that she should never dare to come to the\r\nplace again, as his mother would tear her eyes out. Then she checked\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of course she ain\xe2\x80\x99t your mother! How stupid I am! I keep\r\nforgetting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth had, as he supposed, from far back cultivated a manner with\r\nwhich he could meet allusions of this kind: he had had first and\r\nlast so many opportunities to practise it. Therefore he looked at his\r\ncompanion very steadily while he said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother died many years ago;\r\nshe was a great invalid. But Pinnie has been awfully good to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s dead too\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Miss Henning was prompt, as if \xe2\x80\x9ccapping\xe2\x80\x9d it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe died very suddenly. I daresay you remember her in the Plice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen, while Hyacinth disengaged from the past the obscure figure of\r\nMrs. Henning, of whom he mainly remembered that she used to strike him\r\nas cross and dirty, the girl added, smiling, but with more sentiment,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no Pinnie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look as if you could take care of yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m very confiding,\xe2\x80\x9d said Millicent Henning. Then she asked\r\nwhat had become of Mr. Vetch. \xe2\x80\x9cWe used to say that if Miss Pynsent was\r\nyour mamma he was your papa. In our family we used to call him Miss\r\nPynsent\xe2\x80\x99s young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s her young man still,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth returned. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s our best friend\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nsupposed to be. He got me the place I\xe2\x80\x99m in now. He lives by his fiddle,\r\nas he used to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMillicent looked a little at her companion, after which she observed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought he would have got you a place at his theatre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt his theatre? That would have been no use. I don\xe2\x80\x99t play any\r\ninstrument.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean in the orchestra, you gaby! You\xe2\x80\x99d look very nice in\r\na fancy costume.\xe2\x80\x9d She had her elbows on the table and her shoulders\r\nlifted, an attitude of extreme familiarity. He was on the point of\r\nreplying that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for fancy costumes, he wished to go\r\nthrough life in his own character; but he checked himself with the\r\nreflexion that this was exactly what he was apparently destined not\r\nto do. His own character? He was to cover that up as carefully as\r\npossible; he was to go through life in a mask, in a borrowed mantle;\r\nhe was to be every day and every hour an actor. Suddenly and with\r\nthe utmost irrelevance Miss Henning inquired: \xe2\x80\x9cIs Miss Pynsent some\r\nrelation? What gave her any right over you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth had an answer ready for this question; he had determined to\r\nsay as he had several times said before: \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s an old friend\r\nof my family. My mother was very fond of her and she was very fond of\r\nmy mother.\xe2\x80\x9d He repeated the formula now, looking at the girl with the\r\nsame inscrutable calmness, as he fancied; though a remark more to his\r\ntaste would have been that his mother was none of her business. But\r\nshe was too handsome for such risks, and she presented her large fair\r\nface to him across the table with an air of solicitation to be cosy and\r\ncomfortable. There were things in his heart and a torment and a hidden\r\npassion in his life which he should be glad enough to lay open to some\r\nwoman. He believed that perhaps this would be the cure ultimately; that\r\nin return for something he might drop, syllable by syllable, into some\r\nlistening ear that would be attached to some kissable cheek, certain\r\nother words would be spoken to him which would make his pain for ever\r\nless sharp. But what woman could he trust, what ear would be both safe\r\nand happily enough attached? How much didn\xe2\x80\x99t he already ask? The answer\r\nwas not in this loud fresh laughing creature, whose sympathy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave the fineness he was looking for, since her curiosity was vulgar.\r\nHyacinth objected to the vulgar as much as Miss Pynsent herself;\r\nin this respect she had long since discovered that he was after her\r\nown heart. He had not at any rate now taken up the subject of Mrs.\r\nHenning\xe2\x80\x99s death; he felt himself incapable of researches into that lady\r\nand had no desire for knowledge of Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s relationships. Moreover\r\nhe always suffered, to sickness, when people began to hover about the\r\nquestion of his origin, the reasons why Pinnie had had the care of him\r\nfrom a baby. Mrs. Henning had been repulsive, but at least her daughter\r\ncould speak of her. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Vetch has changed his lodgings: he moved\r\nout of 17 three years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, to vary the topic. \xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand the other people in the house; there was a man who played the\r\naccordeon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMillicent, however, was but moderately interested in this anecdote,\r\nthough wanting to know why people should like Mr. Vetch\xe2\x80\x99s fiddle any\r\nbetter. Then she added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think that while he was about it he\r\nmight have put you into something better than a bookbinder\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t obliged to put me into anything. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very good place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t where I should have looked to find you,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ngirl declared, not so much in the tone of wishing to offer him tribute\r\nas of resentment at having miscalculated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere should you have looked to find me? In the House of Commons? It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na pity you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told me in advance what you would have liked\r\nme to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe faced him over her cup while she drank in ladylike sips. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nknow what they used to say in the Plice? That your father was a lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely. That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of rot they talk in that precious hole,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe young man said without blenching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps he was,\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent ventured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may have been a prime-minister for all the good it has done me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy your talking as if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d said Millicent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinish your tea\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t mind how I talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you _\xe2\x80\x99ave_ got a temper!\xe2\x80\x9d she archly retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have\r\nthought you\xe2\x80\x99d be a clerk at a banker\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they select them for their tempers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I mean. You used to be too clever to follow a trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not clever enough to live on air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might be, really, for all the tea you drink! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you go in\r\nfor some high profession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was I to go in? Who the devil was to help me?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth asked with\r\na certain vibration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you got any relations?\xe2\x80\x9d said Millicent after a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing? Are you trying to make me swagger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke sharply she only laughed, not in the least ruffled, and\r\nby the way she looked at him seemed to like the effect. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsorry you\xe2\x80\x99re only a journeyman,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on as she pushed away her\r\ncup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth answered; but he called for the bill as if he had\r\nbeen an employer of labour. Then while they waited he remarked to his\r\ncompanion that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe she had an idea of what his work was\r\nand how charming it could be. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I get up books for the shops,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid when she had asserted that she perfectly understood. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the art\r\nof the binder\xe2\x80\x99s an exquisite art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Miss Pynsent told me. She said you had some samples at home. I\r\nshould like to see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know how good they are,\xe2\x80\x9d he finely smiled.\r\n\r\nHe expected she would exclaim in answer that he was an impudent wretch,\r\nand for a moment she seemed on the point of doing so. But the words\r\nchanged on her lips and she replied almost tenderly: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the\r\nway you used to speak to me years ago in the Plice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care about that. I hate all that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, so do I, if you come to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Millicent as if she could\r\nrise to any breadth of view. With which she returned to her idea that\r\nhe had not done himself justice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou used always to have your nose in\r\nsomething or other. I never thought you\xe2\x80\x99d work with your \xe2\x80\x99ands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis seemed to irritate him, and, having paid the bill and given\r\nthreepence, ostentatiously, to the young woman with a languid manner\r\nand hair of an unnatural yellow who had waited on them, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmay depend upon it I shan\xe2\x80\x99t do it an hour longer than I can help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see some day.\xe2\x80\x9d In the street, after they had begun to walk\r\nagain, he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cYou speak as if I could have my pick. What was an\r\nobscure little beggar to do, buried in a squalid corner of London under\r\na million of idiots? I had no help, no influence, no acquaintance of\r\nany kind with professional people, and no means of getting at them.\r\nI had to do something; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on living on Pinnie. Thank God I\r\nhelp her now a little. I took what I could get.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke as if he had\r\nbeen touched by the imputation of having derogated.\r\n\r\nMillicent seemed to imply that he defended himself successfully when\r\nshe said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou express yourself like a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar gentleman\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a speech\r\nto which he made no response. But he began to talk again afterwards,\r\nand, the evening having definitely set in, his companion took his arm\r\nfor the rest of the way home. By the time he reached her door he had\r\nconfided to her that in secret he wrote\xe2\x80\x94quite as for publication; he\r\nwas haunted with the dream of literary distinction. This appeared\r\nto impress her, and she branched off to remark, with the agreeable\r\nincoherence that characterised her, that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care anything for\r\na man\xe2\x80\x99s family if she liked the man himself; she thought families and\r\nthat sort of rot were about played out. Hyacinth wished she would leave\r\nhis origin alone; and while they lingered in front of her house before\r\nshe went in he broke out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt you\xe2\x80\x99re a jolly girl, and I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy to have seen you\r\nagain. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve awfully little tact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ have little tact? You should see me work off an old jacket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent a little, standing before her with his hands in his\r\npockets. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good job you\xe2\x80\x99re so lovely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMillicent didn\xe2\x80\x99t blush at this compliment, and probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand all it conveyed, but she looked into his eyes a while,\r\nwith all the smile that showed her teeth, and then came back more\r\ninconsequently than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cCome now, who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho am I? I\xe2\x80\x99m a wretched little \xe2\x80\x98forwarder\xe2\x80\x99 in the shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever could fancy any one in that line!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncompetently cried. Then she let him know she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask him in,\r\nas she made it a point not to receive gentlemen, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nif she took another walk with him and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care if she met him\r\nsomewhere\xe2\x80\x94if it were handy enough. As she lived so far from Lomax Place\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t care if she met him half-way. So in the dusky by-street\r\nin Pimlico, before separating, they took a casual tryst; the most\r\ninteresting, the young man felt, that had yet been\xe2\x80\x94he could scarcely\r\ncall it granted him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day shortly after this, at the bindery, his friend Poupin, absent,\r\nhad failed to send the explanation customary in case of illness or\r\ndomestic accident. There were two or three men employed in the place\r\nwhose non-appearance, usually following close upon pay-day, was better\r\nunexplained, was in fact an implication of moral feebleness; but as a\r\ngeneral thing Mr. Crookenden\xe2\x80\x99s establishment was a haunt of punctuality\r\nand sobriety. Least of all had Eustache Poupin been in the habit of\r\nasking for a margin. Hyacinth knew how little indulgence he had ever\r\ncraved, and this was part of his admiration for the extraordinary\r\nFrenchman, an ardent stoic, a cold conspirator and an exquisite\r\nartist, who was by far the most interesting person in the ranks of\r\nhis acquaintance and whose conversation, in the workshop, helped him\r\nsometimes to forget the smell of leather and glue. His conversation!\r\nHyacinth had had plenty of that and had endeared himself to the\r\npassionate refugee by the solemnity and candour of his attention.\r\nPoupin had come to England after the Commune of 1871, to escape the\r\nreprisals of the government of M. Thiers, and had remained there in\r\nspite of amnesties and rehabilitations. He was a Republican of the\r\nold-fashioned sort, of the note of 1848, humanitary and idealistic,\r\ninfinitely addicted to fraternity and equality and inexhaustibly\r\nsurprised and exasperated at finding so little enthusiasm for them in\r\nthe land of his exile. He had a marked claim upon Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s esteem and\r\ngratitude, for he had been his _parrain_, his protector at the bindery.\r\nWhen Anastasius Vetch found something for Miss Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s young charge\r\nto do, it was through the Frenchman, with whom he had accidentally made\r\nacquaintance, that he found it.\r\n\r\nWhen the boy was about fifteen years of age Mr. Vetch made him a\r\npresent of the essays of Lord Bacon, and the purchase of this volume\r\nhad important consequences for Hyacinth. Anastasius Vetch was a poor\r\nman, and the luxury of giving was for the most part denied him; but\r\nwhen once in a way he tasted it he liked the sensation to be pure.\r\nNo man knew better the difference between the common and the rare,\r\nor was more capable of appreciating a book which opened well\xe2\x80\x94of which\r\nthe margin was not hideously chopped and of which the lettering on the\r\nback was sharp. It was only such a book that he could bring himself\r\nto offer even to a poor little devil whom a fifth-rate dressmaker\r\n(he knew Pinnie was fifth-rate) had rescued from the workhouse. So\r\nwhen it became a question of fitting the great Elizabethan with a\r\nnew coat\xe2\x80\x94a coat of full morocco discreetly, delicately gilt\xe2\x80\x94he went\r\nwith his little cloth-bound volume, a Pickering, straight to Mr.\r\nCrookenden, whom every one who knew anything about the matter knew to\r\nbe a prince of binders, though they also knew that his work, limited\r\nin quantity, was mainly done for a particular bookseller and only\r\nthrough the latter\xe2\x80\x99s agency. Anastasius Vetch had no idea of paying the\r\nbookseller\xe2\x80\x99s commission, and though he could be lavish (for him) when\r\nhe made a present, he was capable of taking an immense deal of trouble\r\nto save sixpence. He made his way into Mr. Crookenden\xe2\x80\x99s workshop,\r\nwhich was situated in a small superannuated square in Soho and where\r\nthe proposal of so slender a job was received at first with chilling\r\ncalm. Mr. Vetch, however, insisted; he explained with irresistible\r\nfrankness the motive of his errand: the desire to obtain the best\r\npossible binding for the least possible money. He made his conception\r\nof the best possible binding so vivid, so exemplary, that the master\r\nof the shop at last confessed to that disinterested sympathy which, in\r\nfavouring conditions, establishes itself between the artist and the\r\nconnoisseur. Mr. Vetch\xe2\x80\x99s little book was put in hand as a particular\r\nservice to an eccentric gentleman whose visit had been a smile-stirring\r\ninterlude (for the circle of listening workmen) in a merely mechanical\r\nday; and when he went back three weeks later to see if the job were\r\ndone he had the pleasure of finding that his injunctions, punctually\r\ncomplied with, had even been bettered. The work had been accomplished\r\nwith a perfection of skill which made him ask whom he was to thank for\r\nit (he had been told that one man should do the whole of it) and in\r\nthis manner he made the acquaintance of the most brilliant craftsman\r\nin the establishment, the incorruptible, the imaginative, the unerring\r\nEustache Poupin.\r\n\r\nIn response to an appreciation which he felt not to be _banal_ M.\r\nPoupin remarked that he had at home a small collection of experiments\r\nin morocco, russia, parchment, of fanciful specimens with which, for\r\nthe love of the thing itself, he had amused his leisure hours and which\r\nhe should be happy to show his interlocutor if the latter would do him\r\nthe honour to call upon him at his lodgings in Lisson Grove. Mr. Vetch\r\nmade a note of the address and, for the love of the thing itself, went\r\none Sunday afternoon to see the binder\xe2\x80\x99s esoteric studies. On this\r\noccasion he made the acquaintance of Madame Poupin, a small, fat lady\r\nwith a bristling moustache, the white cap of an _ouvri\xc3\xa8re_, a knowledge\r\nof her husband\xe2\x80\x99s craft that was equal to his own, and not a syllable\r\nof English save the words \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you think, what you think?\xe2\x80\x9d which she\r\nintroduced with indefatigable frequency. He also discovered that his\r\nnew acquaintance had been a political proscript and that he regarded\r\nthe iniquitous fabric of Church and State with an eye scarcely more\r\nreverent than the fiddler\xe2\x80\x99s own. M. Poupin was an aggressive socialist,\r\nwhich Anastasius Vetch was not, and a constructive democrat (instead of\r\nbeing a mere scoffer at effete things) and a theorist and an optimist\r\nand a collectivist and a perfectionist and a visionary; he believed the\r\nday was to come when all the nations of the earth would abolish their\r\nfrontiers and armies and custom-houses, and embrace on both cheeks and\r\ncover the globe with boulevards, radiating from Paris, where the human\r\nfamily would sit in groups at little tables, according to affinities,\r\ndrinking coffee (not tea, _par exemple!_) and listening to the music of\r\nthe spheres. Mr. Vetch neither prefigured nor desired this organised\r\nbeatitude; he was fond of his cup of tea and only wanted to see the\r\nBritish constitution a good deal simplified; he thought it a much\r\noverrated system, but his heresies rubbed shoulders sociably with those\r\nof the little bookbinder, and his friend in Lisson Grove became for him\r\nthe type of the intelligent foreigner whose conversation gives wings\r\nto our heavy-footed culture. Poupin\xe2\x80\x99s humanitary zeal was as unlimited\r\nas his English vocabulary was the reverse, and the new friends agreed\r\nwith each other enough, and not too much, to discuss, which was much\r\nbetter than an unspeakable harmony. On several other Sunday afternoons\r\nthe fiddler went back to Lisson Grove, and having, at his theatre, as\r\na veteran, a faithful servant, an occasional privilege, he was able\r\nto carry thither, one day in the autumn, an order for two seats in\r\nthe second balcony. Madame Poupin and her husband passed a lugubrious\r\nevening at the English comedy, where they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand a word\r\nthat was spoken and consoled themselves by hanging on the agitated\r\nfiddlestick of their friend in the orchestra. But this adventure failed\r\nto arrest the development of a friendship into which, eventually,\r\nAmanda Pynsent was drawn. Madame Poupin, among the cold insularies,\r\nlacked female society, and Mr. Vetch proposed to his amiable friend\r\nin Lomax Place to call upon her. The little dressmaker, who in the\r\ncourse of her life had known no Frenchwoman but the unhappy Florentine\r\n(so favourable a specimen till she began to go wrong) adopted his\r\nsuggestion in the hope that she should get a few ideas from a lady\r\nwhose appearance would doubtless exemplify (as Florentine\xe2\x80\x99s originally\r\nhad done) the fine taste of her nation; but she found the bookbinder\r\nand his wife a bewildering mixture of the brilliant and the relaxed,\r\nand was haunted long afterwards by the memory of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s camisole in\r\nsome hideous print, her uncorseted overflow and her carpet slippers.\r\n\r\nThe acquaintance, none the less, was sealed three months later by a\r\nsupper, one Sunday night, in Lisson Grove, to which Mr. Vetch brought\r\nhis fiddle, at which Amanda presented to her hosts her adoptive\r\nson, and which also revealed to her that Madame Poupin could dress a\r\nMichaelmas goose if she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t dress a fat Frenchwoman. This lady\r\nconfided to the fiddler that she thought Miss Pynsent exceedingly\r\n_comme il faut\xe2\x80\x94dans le genre anglais_; and neither Amanda nor Hyacinth\r\nhad ever passed an evening of such splendour. It took its place, in\r\nthe boy\xe2\x80\x99s recollection, beside the visit, years before, to Mr. Vetch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntheatre. He drank in the remarks exchanged between that gentleman\r\nand M. Poupin. M. Poupin showed him his bindings, the most precious\r\ntrophies of his skill, and it seemed to Hyacinth that on the spot he\r\nwas initiated into a fascinating mystery. He handled the books for half\r\nan hour; Anastasius Vetch watched him without giving any particular\r\nsign. When therefore, presently, Miss Pynsent consulted her friend for\r\nthe twentieth time on the subject of Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccareer\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she spoke\r\nas if she were hesitating between the diplomatic service, the army\r\nand the church\xe2\x80\x94the fiddler replied with promptitude: \xe2\x80\x9cMake him, if\r\nyou can, what the Frenchman is.\xe2\x80\x9d At the mention of a handicraft poor\r\nPinnie always looked very solemn, yet when Mr. Vetch asked her if she\r\nwere prepared to send the boy to one of the universities, or to pay\r\nthe premium required for his being articled to a solicitor, or to make\r\nfavour on his behalf with a bank director or a merchant prince, or, yet\r\nagain, to provide him with a comfortable home while he should woo the\r\nmuse and await the laurels of literature\xe2\x80\x94when, I say, he put the case\r\nbefore her with this cynical, ironical lucidity she only sighed and\r\nsaid that all the money she had ever saved was ninety pounds, which, as\r\nhe knew perfectly well, it would cost her his acquaintance for evermore\r\nto take out of the bank. The fiddler had in fact declared to her in\r\na manner not to be mistaken that if she should divest herself, on the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s account, of this sole nest-egg of her old age, he would wash his\r\nhands of her and her affairs. Her standard of success for Hyacinth\r\nwas vague save on one point, as regards which she was passionately,\r\nfiercely firm: she was perfectly determined he should never go into\r\na small shop. She would rather see him a bricklayer or a costermonger\r\nthan dedicated to a retail business, tying up candles at a grocer\xe2\x80\x99s or\r\ngiving change for a shilling across a counter. She would rather, she\r\ndeclared on one occasion, see him articled to a shoemaker or a tailor.\r\n\r\nA stationer in a neighbouring street had affixed to his window a\r\nwritten notice that he was in want of a smart errand-boy, and Pinnie,\r\non hearing of it, had presented Hyacinth to his consideration.\r\nThe stationer was a dreadful bullying man with a patch over his\r\neye, who seemed to think the boy would be richly remunerated with\r\nthree shillings a week; a contemptible measure, as it seemed to the\r\ndressmaker, of his rare abilities and acquirements. His schooling had\r\nbeen desultory, precarious, and had had a certain continuity mainly\r\nin his early years, while he was under the care of an old lady who\r\ncombined with the functions of pew-opener at a neighbouring church the\r\nmanipulation, in the Place itself, where she resided with her sister,\r\na monthly nurse, of such pupils as could be spared (in their families)\r\nfrom the more urgent exercise of holding the baby and fetching the\r\nbeer. Later, for a twelvemonth, Pinnie had paid five shillings a\r\nweek for him at an \xe2\x80\x9cAcademy\xe2\x80\x9d in a genteel part of Islington, where\r\nthere was an \xe2\x80\x9cinstructor in the foreign languages,\xe2\x80\x9d a platform for\r\noratory and a high social standard, but where Hyacinth suffered from\r\nthe fact that almost all his mates were the sons of dealers in edible\r\narticles\xe2\x80\x94pastry-cooks, grocers and fishmongers\xe2\x80\x94and in this capacity\r\nsubjected him to pangs and ignominious contrasts by bringing to school,\r\nfor their exclusive consumption or for exchange and barter, various\r\nbuns, oranges, spices and marine animals, which the boy, with his hands\r\nin his empty pockets and the sense of a savourless home in his heart,\r\nwas obliged to see devoured without his participation. Miss Pynsent\r\nwould not have pretended he was highly educated in the technical sense\r\nof the word, but she believed that at fifteen he had read almost every\r\nbook in the world. The limits of his reading had been in fact only the\r\nlimits of his opportunity. Mr. Vetch, who talked with him more and more\r\nas he grew older, knew this, and lent him every volume he possessed\r\nor could pick up for the purpose. Reading was his extravagance, while\r\nthe absence of any direct contact with a library represented for him\r\nmainly the hard shock of the real; the shock, that is, he could most\r\neasily complain of. Mr. Vetch believed him subtly intelligent, and\r\ntherefore thought it a woeful pity that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have furtherance in\r\nsome liberal walk; but he would have thought it a greater pity still\r\nthat a youth with that expression in his eyes should be condemned to\r\nmeasure tape or cut slices of cheese. He himself had no influence he\r\ncould bring into play, no connexion with the great world of capital or\r\nthe market of labour. That is he touched these mighty institutions at\r\nbut one very small point\xe2\x80\x94a point which, such as it was, he kept well in\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nWhen Pinnie replied to the stationer round the corner, after he had\r\nmentioned the \xe2\x80\x9cterms\xe2\x80\x9d on which he was prepared to receive applications\r\nfrom errand-boys, that, thank her stars, she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t sunk so low as\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94so low as to sell her darling into slavery for three shillings\r\na week\xe2\x80\x94he felt that she only gave more florid expression to his own\r\nsentiment. Of course if Hyacinth didn\xe2\x80\x99t begin by carrying parcels he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hope to be promoted, through the more refined nimbleness\r\nof tying them up, to a position as accountant or manager; but both\r\nthe fiddler and his friend\xe2\x80\x94Miss Pynsent indeed only in the last\r\nresort\xe2\x80\x94resigned themselves to the forfeiture of this prospect. Mr.\r\nVetch saw clearly that a charming handicraft was a finer thing than a\r\nvulgar \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness,\xe2\x80\x9d and one day after his acquaintance with Eustache\r\nPoupin had gone a considerable length he inquired of the fervid\r\nFrenchman if there were a chance of the lad\xe2\x80\x99s obtaining a footing,\r\nunder his own wing, in Mr. Crookenden\xe2\x80\x99s workshop. There could be no\r\nbetter place for him to acquire a knowledge of the most elegant of\r\nthe mechanical arts; and to be received into such an establishment\r\nand at the instance of such an artist would be a real start in life.\r\nM. Poupin meditated, and that evening confided his meditations to\r\nthe companion who reduplicated all his thoughts and understood him\r\nbetter even than he understood himself. The pair had no children\r\nand had felt the deficiency; moreover they had heard from Mr. Vetch\r\nthe dolorous tale of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s entrance into life. He was one of\r\nthe disinherited, one of the expropriated, one of the exceptionally\r\ninteresting; and moreover he was one of themselves, a child, as it\r\nwere, of the inexhaustible France, an offshoot of the sacred race.\r\nIt is not the most authenticated point in this veracious history, but\r\nthere is strong reason to believe that tears were shed that night, in\r\nLisson Grove, over poor Hyacinth Robinson. In a day or two M. Poupin\r\nreplied to the fiddler that he had now been several years in _le vieux_\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrook\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d employ; that during that time he had done work for him which\r\nhe would have had _bien du mal_ to get done by another, and had never\r\nasked for an indulgence, an allowance, a remission, an augmentation.\r\nIt was time, if only for the dignity of the thing, he should ask for\r\nsomething, and he would make their little friend the subject of his\r\ndemand. \xe2\x80\x9c_La soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 lui doit bien cela_,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked afterwards,\r\nwhen, Mr. Crookenden proving dryly hospitable and the arrangement\r\nbeing formally complete, Mr. Vetch thanked him in his kindly, casual,\r\nbashful English way. He was paternal when Hyacinth began to occupy a\r\nplace in the malodorous chambers in Soho; he took him in hand, made\r\nhim a disciple, the recipient of a precious tradition, discovered\r\nin him a susceptibility to philosophic, to cosmic, as well as to\r\ntechnic truth. He taught him French and socialism, encouraged him\r\nto spend his evenings in Lisson Grove, invited him to regard Madame\r\nPoupin as a second, or rather as a third, mother, and in short made\r\na very considerable mark on the boy\xe2\x80\x99s mind. He fostered and drew out\r\nthe latent Gallicism of his nature, and by the time he was twenty\r\nHyacinth, who had completely assimilated his influence, regarded him\r\nwith a mixture of veneration and amusement. M. Poupin was the person\r\nwho consoled him most when he was miserable; and he was very often\r\nmiserable.\r\n\r\nHis staying away from his work was so rare that, in the afternoon,\r\nbefore he went home, Hyacinth walked to Lisson Grove to see what\r\nailed him. He found his friend in bed with a plaster on his chest\r\nand Madame Poupin making _tisane_ over the fire. The Frenchman took\r\nhis indisposition solemnly but resignedly, like a man who believed\r\nthat all illness was owing to the imperfect organisation of society,\r\nand lay covered up to his chin with a red cotton handkerchief bound\r\nround his head. Near his bed sat a visitor, a young man unknown to\r\nHyacinth. Hyacinth naturally had never been to Paris, but he always\r\nsupposed that the _int\xc3\xa9rieur_ of his friends in Lisson Grove gave\r\nrather a vivid idea of that city. The two small rooms constituting\r\ntheir establishment contained a great many mirrors as well as\r\nlittle portraits (old-fashioned prints) of revolutionary heroes. The\r\nchimney-piece in the bedroom was muffled in some red drapery which\r\nappeared to Hyacinth extraordinarily magnificent; the principal\r\nornament of the salon was a group of small and highly-decorated cups,\r\non a tray, accompanied by gilt bottles and glasses, the latter still\r\nmore diminutive\xe2\x80\x94the whole intended for black coffee and liqueurs. There\r\nwas no carpet on the floor, but rugs and mats of various shapes and\r\nsizes disposed themselves at the feet of the chairs and sofas; and in\r\nthe sitting-room, where stood a wonderful gilt clock of the Empire,\r\nsurmounted with a \xe2\x80\x9csubject\xe2\x80\x9d representing Virtue receiving a crown of\r\nlaurel from the hands of Faith, Madame Poupin, with the aid of a tiny\r\nstove, a handful of charcoal and two or three saucepans, carried on a\r\ntriumphant _cuisine_. On the windows were curtains of white muslin much\r\nfluted and frilled and tied with pink ribbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m suffering extremely, but we must all suffer so long as the\r\nsocial question is so abominably, so iniquitously neglected,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPoupin remarked, speaking French and rolling toward Hyacinth his\r\nsalient, excited-looking eyes, which always had the same declamatory,\r\nreclamatory, proclamatory, the same universally inaugurative\r\nexpression, whatever his occupation or his topic. Hyacinth had seated\r\nhimself near his friend\xe2\x80\x99s pillow, opposite the strange young man, who\r\nhad been accommodated with a chair at the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes; with their filthy politics the situation of the _pauvre monde_\r\nis the last thing they ever think of!\xe2\x80\x9d his wife exclaimed from the\r\nfire. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are times when I ask myself how long it will go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will go on till the measure of their imbecility, their infamy, is\r\nfull. It will go on till the day of justice, till the reintegration of\r\nthe despoiled and disinherited, is ushered in with a force that will\r\nshake the globe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we always see things go on; we never see them change,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame\r\nPoupin, making a very cheerful clatter with a big spoon in a saucepan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may not see it, but _they\xe2\x80\x99ll_ see it,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband returned.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do I say, my children? I do see it,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbefore my eyes in its radiant reality, especially as I lie here\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nrevendication, the rehabilitation, the rectification.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth ceased to pay attention, not because he had a differing\r\nopinion about what M. Poupin called the _av\xc3\xa8nement_ of the\r\ndisinherited, but, on the contrary, precisely on account of his\r\nfamiliarity with that prospect. It was the constant theme of his\r\nFrench friends, whom he had long since perceived to be in a state of\r\nchronic spiritual inflammation. For them the social question was always\r\nin order, the political question always abhorrent, the disinherited\r\nalways present. He wondered at their zeal, their continuity, their\r\nvivacity, their incorruptibility; at the abundant supply of conviction\r\nand prophecy they always had on hand. He believed that at bottom he\r\nwas sorer than they, yet he had deviations and lapses, moments when\r\nthe social question bored him and he forgot not only his own wrongs,\r\nwhich would have been pardonable, but those of the people at large, of\r\nhis brothers and sisters in misery. They, however, were perpetually\r\nin the breach, and perpetually consistent with themselves and, what\r\nis more, with each other. Hyacinth had heard that the institution of\r\nmarriage in France was lightly considered, but he was struck with the\r\ncloseness and intimacy of the union in Lisson Grove, the passionate\r\nidentity of interest: especially on the day when M. Poupin informed\r\nhim, in a moment of extreme but not indiscreet expansion, that the\r\nlady was his wife only in a spiritual, affectional sense. There were\r\nhypocritical concessions and debasing superstitions of which this\r\nexalted pair had wholly disapproved. Hyacinth knew their vocabulary\r\nby heart and could have said everything, in the same words, that on\r\nany given occasion M. Poupin was likely to say. He knew that \xe2\x80\x9cthey,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin their phraseology, was a comprehensive allusion to every one in the\r\nworld but the people\xe2\x80\x94though who, exactly, in their length and breadth,\r\nthe people were was less definitely established. He himself was of this\r\nsacred body, for which the future was to have such compensations; and\r\nso of course were his French friends, and so was Pinnie, and so were\r\nmost of the inhabitants of Lomax Place and the workmen in old Crook\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop. But was old Crook himself, who wore an apron rather dirtier\r\nthan the rest of them and was a master-hand at \xe2\x80\x9cforwarding,\xe2\x80\x9d yet who,\r\non the other side, was the occupant of a villa all but detached, at\r\nPutney, with a wife known to have secret aspirations toward a page in\r\nbuttons? Above all was Mr. Vetch, who earned a weekly wage, and not\r\na large one, with his fiddle, but who had mysterious affinities of\r\nanother sort, reminiscences of a phase in which he smoked cigars, had\r\na hat-box and used cabs\xe2\x80\x94besides visiting Boulogne? Anastasius Vetch\r\nhad interfered in his life, atrociously, at a terrible crisis; but\r\nHyacinth, who strove to cultivate justice in his own conduct, believed\r\nhe had acted conscientiously, and tried to esteem him, the more so as\r\nthe fiddler evidently felt he had something to make up to him for and\r\nhad ever treated him with marked benevolence. He believed in short that\r\nMr. Vetch took a sincere interest in him and if he should meddle again\r\nwould meddle in a different way: he used to see him sometimes look at\r\nhim with the kindest eyes. It would make a difference therefore if he\r\nwere of the people or not, inasmuch as on the day of the great revenge\r\nit would only be the people who should be saved. It was for the people\r\nthe world was made: whoever was not of them was against them; and\r\nall others were cumberers, usurpers, exploiters, _accapareurs_, as M.\r\nPoupin used to say. Hyacinth had once put the question directly to Mr.\r\nVetch, who looked at him a while through the fumes of his eternal pipe\r\nand then said: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I\xe2\x80\x99m an aristocrat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know but you were a bourgeois,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m neither. I\xe2\x80\x99m a Bohemian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith your evening dress, every night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fiddler, \xe2\x80\x9cthose are the most confirmed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth was only half satisfied with this, for it was by no means\r\ndefinite to him that Bohemians were also to be saved; if he could be\r\nsure perhaps he would become one himself. Yet he never suspected Mr.\r\nVetch of being a governmental agent, though Eustache Poupin had told\r\nhim that there were a great many who looked a good deal like that: not\r\nof course with any purpose of incriminating the fiddler, whom he had\r\ntrusted from the first and continued to trust. The governmental agent\r\nin extraordinary disguises, the wondrous _mouchard_ of M. Poupin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nview, became a very familiar type to Hyacinth, and though he had never\r\ncaught one of the infamous brotherhood in the act there were plenty of\r\npersons to whom, on the very face of the matter, he had no hesitation\r\nin attributing the character. There was nothing of the Bohemian,\r\nat any rate, about the Poupins, whom Hyacinth had now known long\r\nenough not to be surprised at the way they combined the socialistic\r\npassion, a red-hot impatience for the general rectification, with\r\nan extraordinary decency of life and a worship of proper work. The\r\nFrenchman spoke habitually as if the great swindle practised upon the\r\npeople were too impudent to be endured a moment longer, and yet he\r\nfound patience for the most exquisite \xe2\x80\x9ctooling\xe2\x80\x9d and took a book in hand\r\nwith the deliberation of one who should believe that everything was\r\nimmutably constituted. Hyacinth knew what he thought of priests and\r\ntheologies, but he had the religion of conscientious craftsmanship and\r\nhe reduced the boy, on his side, to a kind of prostration before his\r\ndelicate wonder-working fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you have? _J\xe2\x80\x99ai la main\r\nparisienne_,\xe2\x80\x9d M. Poupin would reply modestly when Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s admiration\r\nbroke out; and he was good enough, after he had seen a few specimens\r\nof what our hero could do, to inform him that _he_ had the same happy\r\nconformation. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a good workman,\r\n_il n\xe2\x80\x99y a que \xc3\xa7a_\xe2\x80\x9d; and his own life was practically governed by this\r\nconviction. He delighted in the use of his hands and his tools and the\r\nexercise of his taste, which was faultless, and Hyacinth could easily\r\nimagine how it must torment him to spend a day on his back. He ended\r\nby perceiving, however, that consolation was on this occasion in some\r\ndegree conveyed by the presence of the young man who sat at the foot of\r\nthe bed and with whom M. Poupin exhibited such signs of acquaintance as\r\nto make our hero wonder why he had not seen him before, nor even heard\r\nof him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by force that will shake the globe?\xe2\x80\x9d the young\r\nman inquired, leaning back in his chair with raised arms and his\r\ninterlocked hands, behind him, supporting his head. M. Poupin had\r\nspoken French, which he always preferred to do, the insular tongue\r\nbeing an immense tribulation to him; but his visitor spoke English,\r\nand Hyacinth immediately took in that there was nothing French about\r\n_him_\xe2\x80\x94M. Poupin could never tell him he had _la main parisienne_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean a force that will make the bourgeois go down into their cellars\r\nand hide, pale with fear, behind their barrels of wine and their heaps\r\nof gold!\xe2\x80\x9d cried M. Poupin, rolling terrible eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in this country, I hope, in their coal-bins. _La-la_, we shall\r\nfind them even there,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9989 was an irresistible force,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Poupin. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you would\r\nhave thought so if you had been there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so was the entrance of the Versaillais, which sent you over here\r\nten years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man returned. He saw Hyacinth was watching\r\nhim and he met his eyes, smiling a little, in a way that added to our\r\nhero\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardon, pardon_, I resist!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Eustache Poupin, glaring, in his\r\nimprovised nightcap, out of his sheets; and Madame repeated that they\r\nresisted\xe2\x80\x94she believed well that they resisted! The young man burst out\r\nlaughing; whereupon his host declared with a dignity which even his\r\nrecumbent position didn\xe2\x80\x99t abate that it was really frivolous of him to\r\nask such questions as that, knowing as he did\xe2\x80\x94what he did know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know\xe2\x80\x94I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man good-naturedly, lowering his\r\narms and thrusting his hands into his pockets while he stretched his\r\nlong legs a little. \xe2\x80\x9cBut everything is yet to be tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the trial will be on a great scale\xe2\x80\x94_soyez tranquille_! It will be\r\none of those experiments that constitute a proof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth wondered what they were talking about, and perceived that\r\nit must be something important, for the stranger was not a man who\r\nwould take an interest in anything else. Hyacinth was immensely struck\r\nwith him, could see he was remarkable, and felt slightly aggrieved\r\nthat he should be a stranger: that is that he should be apparently a\r\nfamiliar of Lisson Grove and yet that M. Poupin should not have thought\r\nhis young friend from Lomax Place worthy up to this time to be made\r\nacquainted with him. I know not to what degree the visitor in the\r\nother chair discovered these reflexions in Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s face, but after a\r\nmoment, looking across at him, he said in a friendly yet just slightly\r\ndiffident way, a way our hero liked: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I know what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hyacinth in wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you did you would!\xe2\x80\x9d the young man exclaimed and laughed again.\r\nSuch a rejoinder from any one else would have irritated our sensitive\r\nhero, but it only made him more curious about his interlocutor, whose\r\nlaugh was loud and extraordinarily gay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon ami_, you ought to present _ces messieurs_,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Poupin\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ah \xc3\xa7a_, is that the way you trifle with state secrets?\xe2\x80\x9d her husband\r\ncried without heeding her. Then he went on in a different tone: \xe2\x80\x9cM.\r\nHyacinthe is a gifted child, _un enfant tr\xc3\xa8s-dou\xc3\xa9_, in whom I take a\r\ntender interest\xe2\x80\x94a child who has an account to settle. Oh, a thumping\r\nbig one! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it so, _mon petit_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was very well meant, but it made Hyacinth blush, and, without\r\nknowing exactly what to say, he murmured shyly: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I only want them\r\nto let me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s very young,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustache Poupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the person we have seen in this country whom we like best,\xe2\x80\x9d his\r\nwife added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re French,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the strange young man.\r\n\r\nThe trio seemed to Hyacinth to be waiting for his answer to this; it\r\nwas as if a listening stillness had fallen. He found it a difficult\r\npass, partly because there was something exciting and embarrassing in\r\nthe attention of the other visitor, and partly because he had never yet\r\nhad to decide that important question. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know if he were\r\nFrench or were English, or which of the two he should prefer to be.\r\nHis mother\xe2\x80\x99s blood, her suffering in an alien land, the unspeakable,\r\nirremediable misery that consumed her in a place and among a people she\r\nmust have execrated\xe2\x80\x94all this made him French; yet he was conscious at\r\nthe same time of qualities that didn\xe2\x80\x99t mix with it. He had spun to the\r\nlast fineness, long ago, a legend about his mother, built it up slowly,\r\nadding piece to piece, in passionate musings and broodings, when his\r\ncheeks burned and his eyes filled; but there were times when it wavered\r\nand faded, when it ceased to console him and he ceased to trust it.\r\nHe had had a father too, and his father had suffered as well, and had\r\nfallen under a blow, and had paid with his life; and him also he felt\r\nin his spirit and his senses, when the effort to think it out didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsimply end in darkness and confusion, challenging still even while they\r\nbaffled, and inevitable freezing horror. At any rate he seemed rooted\r\nin the place where his wretched parents had expiated, and he knew\r\nnothing of any other. Moreover when old Poupin said \xe2\x80\x9cM. Hyacinthe,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nhe had often done before, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t altogether enjoy it; he thought it\r\nmade his name, which he liked well enough in English, sound like the\r\nname of a hairdresser. Our young friend was under a cloud and a stigma,\r\nbut he was not yet prepared to admit he was ridiculous. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I daresay\r\nI ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_En v\xe2\x80\x99l\xc3\xa0 des b\xc3\xaatises!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Poupin. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not as good as any one in the world? I should like to see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all have an account to settle, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d said the strange\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\nHe evidently meant this to be encouraging to Hyacinth, whose quick\r\ndesire to avert M. Poupin\xe2\x80\x99s allusions had not been lost on him; but our\r\nhero could see that he himself would be sure to be one of the first\r\nto be paid. He would make society bankrupt, but he would be paid. He\r\nwas tall and fair and good-natured looking, but you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nat least Hyacinth couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94if he were handsome or ugly, with his large\r\nhead and square forehead, his thick, straight hair, his heavy mouth and\r\nrather vulgar nose, his admirably clear steady eyes, light-coloured\r\nand set very deep; for despite a want of fineness in some of its\r\nparts his face had a marked expression of intelligence and resolution,\r\nspoke somehow, as if it had showed you his soul drawing deep and even\r\nbreaths, of a state of moral health. He was dressed as a workman in\r\nhis Sunday toggery, having evidently put on his best to call in Lisson\r\nGrove, where he was to meet a lady, and wearing in particular a necktie\r\nwhich was both cheap and pretentious and of which Hyacinth, who noticed\r\neverything of that kind, observed the crude false blue. He had very\r\nbig shoes\xe2\x80\x94the shoes almost of a country labourer\xe2\x80\x94and spoke with a\r\nprovincial accent which Hyacinth believed to be that of Lancashire.\r\nThis didn\xe2\x80\x99t suggest cleverness, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent Hyacinth from\r\nfeeling sure he was the reverse of stupid, that he probably indeed\r\nhad a large easy brain quite as some people had big strong fists.\r\nOur little hero had a great desire to know superior persons, and he\r\ninterested himself on the spot in this quiet stranger whose gravity, by\r\nany fine balance, showed, like that of a precious metal, in the small\r\npiece as well as in the big. He had the complexion of a ploughboy and\r\nthe glance of a commander-in-chief, and might have been a distinguished\r\nyoung _savant_ in the disguise of an artisan. The disguise would have\r\nbeen very complete, for he had several brown stains on his fingers.\r\nHyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity on this occasion was both excited and gratified;\r\nfor after two or three allusions, which he didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, had\r\nbeen made to a certain place where Poupin and their friend had met and\r\nexpected to meet again, Madame Poupin exclaimed that it was a shame not\r\nto take in M. Hyacinthe, who, she would answer for it, had in him the\r\nmaking of one of the pure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll in good time, in good time, _ma bonne_,\xe2\x80\x9d the worthy invalid\r\nreplied. \xe2\x80\x9cM. Hyacinthe knows I count on him, whether or no I make him\r\nan _interne_ to-day or only wait a little longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by an _interne_?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu_, what shall I say!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Eustache Poupin stared at him\r\nsolemnly from his pillow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very sympathetic, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re too young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is never too young to contribute one\xe2\x80\x99s _obole_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame\r\nPoupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you keep a secret?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the other guest, but not as if he\r\nthought it probable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a plot\xe2\x80\x94a conspiracy?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth broke out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asks that as if he were asking if it\xe2\x80\x99s a plum-pudding,\xe2\x80\x9d said M.\r\nPoupin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t good to eat, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t do it for our amusement.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s terribly serious, my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a group of workers to which he and I and a good many others\r\nbelong. There\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in telling him that,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI advise you not to tell it to Mademoiselle; she\xe2\x80\x99s quite in the old\r\nideas,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Poupin suggested to Hyacinth, tasting her _tisane_.\r\n\r\nHyacinth sat baffled and wondering, looking from his fellow-labourer in\r\nSoho to his new acquaintance opposite. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve some plan, something\r\nto which one can give one\xe2\x80\x99s self, I think you might have told me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nremarked in a moment to Poupin.\r\n\r\nThe latter merely viewed him a little as if he were a pleasing object\r\nand then said to the strange young man: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a little jealous of you.\r\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in that; it\xe2\x80\x99s of his age. You must know him, you\r\nmust like him. We\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you his history some other day; it will make\r\nyou feel that he belongs to us of necessity. It\xe2\x80\x99s an accident that he\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t met you here before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could _ces messieurs_ have met when M. Paul never comes? He\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t spoil us!\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Poupin cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see I\xe2\x80\x99ve my little sister at home to take care of when I\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t at the works,\xe2\x80\x9d M. Paul explained. \xe2\x80\x9cThis afternoon it was just a\r\nchance; there was a lady we know came in to sit with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady\xe2\x80\x94a real lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, every inch,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled M. Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like them to thrust themselves into your apartment like\r\nthat because you\xe2\x80\x99ve the _d\xc3\xa9sagr\xc3\xa9ment_ of being poor? It seems to be\r\nthe custom in this country, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t suit me at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame\r\nPoupin continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see one of _ces dames_\xe2\x80\x94the real\r\nones\xe2\x80\x94coming in to sit with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re not a cripple; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the use of your legs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and of my arms!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Frenchwoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis lady looks after several others in our court and she reads to my\r\nsister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, you\xe2\x80\x99re patient, you other English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall never do anything without that,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Paul with\r\nundisturbed good-humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly right; you can\xe2\x80\x99t say that too often. It will be a\r\ntremendous job and only the strong will prevail,\xe2\x80\x9d his host murmured\r\na little wearily, turning his eyes to Madame Poupin, who approached\r\nslowly, holding the _tisane_ in rather a full bowl and tasting it again\r\nand yet again as she came.\r\n\r\nHyacinth had been watching his fellow-visitor with deepening interest;\r\na fact of which M. Paul apparently became aware, for he volunteered\r\npresently, giving a little nod in the direction of the bed, \xe2\x80\x9cHe says we\r\nought to know each other. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing against it. I like to\r\nknow folk if they\xe2\x80\x99re likely to be worth it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth was too pleased with this even to take it up; it seemed to him\r\nfor a moment that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch it gracefully enough. But he said\r\nwith sufficient eagerness: \xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me all about your plot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s no plot. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I care much for plots.\xe2\x80\x9d And with his\r\nmild, steady, light-blue English eye, M. Paul certainly had not much\r\nthe appearance of a conspirator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it a new era?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hyacinth, rather disappointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; it\xe2\x80\x99s just a taking of a stand on two or three\r\npoints.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ah bien, voil\xc3\xa0 du propre_; between us we\xe2\x80\x99ve thrown him into a fever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Madame Poupin, who had put down her bowl on a table near her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s bed and was bending over him with her hand on his forehead.\r\nHer patient was flushed, he had closed his eyes, and it was evident\r\nthere had been more than enough conversation. Madame Poupin announced\r\nas much, with the addition that if the young men wished to make\r\nacquaintance they must do it outside; their friend must be perfectly\r\nquiet. They accordingly withdrew with apologies and promises to return\r\nfor further news on the morrow, and two minutes later Hyacinth found\r\nhimself standing face to face with his companion on the pavement in\r\nfront of M. Poupin\xe2\x80\x99s residence, under a street-lamp which struggled\r\nineffectually with the brown winter dusk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that your name, M. Paul?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked as he looked up at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh bless you, no; that\xe2\x80\x99s only her Frenchified way of putting it. My\r\nname _is_ Paul, though\xe2\x80\x94Paul Muniment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s your trade?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth demanded with a jump into\r\nfamiliarity; for his friend seemed to have told him a great deal more\r\nthan was usually conveyed in that item of information.\r\n\r\nPaul Muniment looked down at him from above broad shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cI work\r\nfor a firm of wholesale chemists at Lambeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI live over the water too; in the far south of London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you going home now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to toddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd may I toddle with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Muniment considered him further and then gave a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll carry\r\nyou if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you; I expect I can walk as far as you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I admire your spirit and I daresay I shall like your company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something in his face, taken in connexion with the idea\r\nthat he was concerned in the taking of a stand\xe2\x80\x94it offered our quick\r\nyouth the image of a rank of bristling bayonets\xe2\x80\x94which made Hyacinth\r\nfeel the desire to go with him till he dropped; and in a moment they\r\nstarted away together and took the direction Muniment had mentioned.\r\nThey discoursed as they went, exchanging a great many opinions and\r\nanecdotes; but they reached the south-westerly court in which the\r\nyoung chemist lived with his infirm sister before he had told Hyacinth\r\nanything definite about the \xe2\x80\x9cpoints\xe2\x80\x9d of his reference or Hyacinth,\r\non his side, had detailed the circumstances involved in his being,\r\naccording to M. Poupin, one of the disinherited. Hyacinth didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwish to press, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t for the world have appeared indiscreet, and\r\nmoreover, though he had taken so great a fancy to Muniment, was not\r\nquite prepared as yet to be pressed himself. Therefore it failed to\r\nbecome very clear how his companion had made Poupin\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance and\r\nhow long he had enjoyed it. Paul Muniment nevertheless was to a certain\r\nextent communicative, especially on the question of his living in a\r\nvery poor little corner. He had his sister to keep\xe2\x80\x94she could do nothing\r\nfor herself; and he paid a low rent because she had to have doctors and\r\ndoses and all sorts of little comforts. He spent a bob a week for her\r\non flowers. It was better too when you got upstairs, and from the back\r\nwindows you could see the dome of Saint Paul\xe2\x80\x99s. Audley Court, with its\r\npretty name, which reminded Hyacinth of Tennyson, proved to be a still\r\ndingier nook than Lomax Place; and it had the further drawback that you\r\nhad to penetrate a narrow alley, a passage between high black walls,\r\nto enter it. At the door of one of the houses the young men paused,\r\nlingering a little, and then Muniment said: \xe2\x80\x9cI say, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ncome up? I like you well enough for that, and you can see my sister;\r\nher name\xe2\x80\x99s Rosy.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke as if this would be a great privilege and\r\nadded, for the joke, that Rosy enjoyed a call from a gentleman of\r\nall things. Hyacinth needed no urging, and he groped his way at his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s heels up a dark staircase which appeared to him\xe2\x80\x94for they\r\nstopped only when they could go no further\xe2\x80\x94the longest and steepest he\r\nhad ever ascended. At the top Paul Muniment pushed open a door, but\r\nexclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cHullo, have you gone to roost?\xe2\x80\x9d on perceiving the room on\r\nthe threshold of which they stood to be unlighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, no; we\xe2\x80\x99re sitting in the dark,\xe2\x80\x9d a small bright voice\r\ninstantly replied. \xe2\x80\x9cLady Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s so kind; she\xe2\x80\x99s here still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice came out of a corner so pervaded by gloom that the speaker\r\nwas indistinguishable. \xe2\x80\x9cWell now, that\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d Paul Muniment\r\nrejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a party then, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought some one else.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re poor, you know, but honest, and not afraid of showing up, and I\r\ndaresay we can manage a candle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, in the dim firelight, Hyacinth saw a tall figure erect\r\nitself\xe2\x80\x94a figure angular and slim, crowned with a large vague hat and\r\na flowing umbrageous veil. This unknown person gave a singular laugh\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh I brought some candles; we could have had a light if we\r\nhad wished.\xe2\x80\x9d Both the tone and the purport of the words announced to\r\nHyacinth that they proceeded from Lady Aurora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Muniment took a match out of his pocket and lighted it on the sole\r\nof his shoe; after which he applied it to a tallow candle which stood\r\nin a tin receptacle on the low mantel-shelf. This enabled Hyacinth\r\nto perceive a narrow bed in a corner and a small object stretched\r\nupon it\xe2\x80\x94an object revealed to him mainly by the bright fixedness of a\r\npair of large eyes, of which the whites were sharply contrasted with\r\nthe dark pupil and which gazed at him across a counterpane of gaudy\r\npatchwork. The brown room seemed crowded with heterogeneous objects\r\nand presented moreover, thanks to a multitude of small prints, both\r\nplain and coloured, fastened all over the walls, a highly-decorated\r\nappearance. The little person in the corner had the air of having gone\r\nto bed in a picture-gallery, and as soon as Hyacinth became aware of\r\nthis his impression deepened that Paul Muniment and his sister were\r\nvery wonderful people. Lady Aurora hovered before him with an odd\r\ndrooping, swaying erectness, and she laughed a good deal, vaguely and\r\nshyly, as for the awkwardness of her being found still on the premises.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRosy, girl, I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought you a visitor,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s guide soon said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis young man has walked all the way from Lisson Grove to make your\r\nacquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d Rosy continued to look at the visitor from over her\r\ncounterpane, and he felt slightly embarrassed, for he had never yet\r\nbeen presented to a young lady in her position. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t mind her\r\nbeing in bed\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s always in bed,\xe2\x80\x9d her brother went on. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s in bed\r\njust the same as a little slippery trout\xe2\x80\x99s in the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive company because I was in bed, there\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be much use, would there, Lady Aurora?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosy put this question in a light, gay tone, with a dart of shining\r\neyes at her companion, who replied at once with still greater hilarity\r\nand in a voice which struck Hyacinth as strange and affected: \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nmercy, no; it seems quite the natural place!\xe2\x80\x9d Then she added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuch a lovely bed, such a comfortable bed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed it is, when your ladyship makes it up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosy; while\r\nHyacinth wondered at this strange phenomenon of a peer\xe2\x80\x99s daughter (for\r\nhe knew she must be that) performing the functions of a housemaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say now, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been doing that again to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment asked,\r\npunching the mattress of the invalid with a vigorous hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, who would if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Aurora inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cIt only takes a\r\nminute if one knows how.\xe2\x80\x9d Her manner was jocosely apologetic and she\r\nseemed to plead guilty to having been absurd; in the dim light Hyacinth\r\nthought he saw her blush as if she were much embarrassed. In spite of\r\nher blushing her appearance and manner suggested to him a personage in\r\na comedy. She sounded the letter _r_ as a _w_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do it beautifully. I often do it, when Mrs. Major doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nup,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul Muniment said, continuing to thump his sister\xe2\x80\x99s couch in an\r\nappreciative but somewhat subversive manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt whatever!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Aurora exclaimed quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nMajor must have so very much to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the making-up of beds, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid; there are only two or three,\r\ndown there, for so many,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man returned loudly and with a kind\r\nof inconsequent cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought a great deal about that. But there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be room\r\nfor more, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Aurora, this time with all gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not much room for a family of that sort anywhere\xe2\x80\x94thirteen\r\npeople of all ages and sizes,\xe2\x80\x9d her host observed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe world\xe2\x80\x99s pretty\r\nbig, but there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re also thirteen at home,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Aurora hastened to mention. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nalso rather crowded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean at Inglefield?\xe2\x80\x9d Rosy demanded from her dusky\r\nnook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about Inglefield. I\xe2\x80\x99m so much in town.\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth could\r\nsee that Inglefield was a subject she wished to turn off, and to do so\r\nshe added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe too are of all ages and sizes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s fortunate you\xe2\x80\x99re not all _your_ size!\xe2\x80\x9d Paul Muniment\r\ndeclared with a freedom at which Hyacinth was rather shocked and which\r\nled him to suspect that though his new friend was a very fine fellow\r\na delicate tact was not his main characteristic. Later he explained\r\nthis by the fact that he was rural and provincial and had not had,\r\nlike himself, the benefit of the life of a capital; and later still he\r\nwished to know what, after all, such a character as that had to do with\r\ntact or with compliments, and why its work in the world was not most\r\nproperly performed by the simple exercise of a rude manly strength.\r\n\r\nAt this familiar allusion to her stature Lady Aurora turned hither and\r\nthither a little confusedly; Hyacinth saw her high, lean figure almost\r\nrock in the dim little room. Her commotion carried her to the door, and\r\nwith ejaculations of which it was difficult to guess the meaning she\r\nwas about to depart when Rosy detained her, having evidently much more\r\nsocial art than Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see it\xe2\x80\x99s only because her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstanding up that she\xe2\x80\x99s so, you gawk? _We\xe2\x80\x99re_ not thirteen, at any rate,\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99ve got all the furniture we want, so there\xe2\x80\x99s a chair for every\r\none. Do be seated again, Lady Aurora, and help me to entertain this\r\ngentleman. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know your name, sir; perhaps my brother will mention\r\nit when he has collected his wits. I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad to see you, though I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see you very well. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we light one of her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncandles? It\xe2\x80\x99s very different to that common thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth thought Miss Muniment very charming; he had begun to make her\r\nout better by this time, and he watched her small wan, pointed face,\r\nframed on the pillow by thick black hair. She was a diminutive dark\r\nperson, pale and wasted with a lifelong infirmity; Hyacinth thought her\r\nmanner denoted high accomplishment\xe2\x80\x94he judged it impossible to tell her\r\nage. Lady Aurora pleaded that she ought to have gone, long since; but\r\nshe seated herself nevertheless on the chair that Paul pushed toward\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a go!\xe2\x80\x9d this young man exclaimed to the other guest. \xe2\x80\x9cYou told\r\nme your name, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve clean forgotten it.\xe2\x80\x9d Then when Hyacinth had\r\npronounced it again he said to his sister: \xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you much;\r\nthere are bushels of Robinsons in the north. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll like him,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s all right; I met him at the Poupins.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPuppin\xe2\x80\x9d would represent\r\nthe sound by which he designated the French bookbinder, and that was\r\nthe name by which Hyacinth always heard him called at Crookenden\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nHyacinth knew how much nearer to the right thing he himself came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name, like mine, represents a flower,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little woman in\r\nthe bed. \xe2\x80\x9cMine is Rose Muniment and her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s is Aurora Langrish.\r\nThat means the morning or the dawn; it\xe2\x80\x99s the most beautiful of all,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\xe2\x80\x9d Rose Muniment addressed this question to Hyacinth\r\nwhile Lady Aurora gazed at her shyly and mutely and as if admiring\r\nher manner, her self-possession and flow of conversation. Her brother\r\nlighted one of the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s candles and the girl went on without\r\nwaiting for Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s response. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it right she should be called\r\nthe dawn when she brings light where she goes? The Puppins are the\r\ncharming foreigners I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you about,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained to her friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s so pleasant knowing a few foreigners!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Aurora exclaimed\r\nwith a spasm of expression. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re often so very fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of foreigner and he\xe2\x80\x99s very fresh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul\r\nMuniment. \xe2\x80\x9cHe meets Mr. Puppin quite on his own ground. If I had his\r\ngift of tongues it would bring me on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I should be very happy to help you with your French. I\r\nfeel the advantage of knowing it,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth remarked finely, becoming\r\nconscious that his declaration drew the attention of Lady Aurora toward\r\nhim; so that he wondered what he could go on to say to keep at that\r\nlevel. This was the first time he had encountered socially a member of\r\nthat aristocracy to which he had now for a good while known it was Miss\r\nPynsent\xe2\x80\x99s theory that he belonged; and the occasion was interesting in\r\nspite of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s appearing to have so few of the qualities of her\r\ncaste. She was about thirty years of age; her nose was large and, in\r\nspite of the sudden retreat of her chin, her face long and lean. She\r\nhad the manner of extreme near-sightedness; her front teeth projected\r\nfrom her upper gums, which she revealed when she smiled, and her fair\r\nhair, in tangled silky skeins (Rose Muniment thought it too lovely),\r\ndrooped over her pink cheeks. Her clothes looked as if she had worn\r\nthem a good deal in the rain, and the note of a certain disrepair in\r\nher apparel was given by a hole in one of her black gloves, through\r\nwhich a white finger gleamed. She was plain and diffident and she might\r\nhave been poor; but in the fine grain and sloping, shrinking slimness\r\nof her whole person, the delicacy of her curious features and a kind\r\nof cultivated quality in her sweet, vague, civil expression, there was\r\na suggestion of race, of long transmission, of an organism that had\r\nresulted from fortunate touch after touch. She was not a common woman;\r\nshe was one of the caprices of an aristocracy. Hyacinth didn\xe2\x80\x99t define\r\nher in this manner to himself, but he received from her the impression\r\nthat if she was a simple creature (which he learned later she was\r\nnot) aristocracies were yet complicated things. Lady Aurora remarked\r\nthat there were many delightful books in French, and he proclaimed\r\nit a torment to know that (as he did very well) when you saw no way\r\nto getting hold of them. This led Lady Aurora to say after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation that she had a good lot of her own and that if he liked she\r\nshould be most happy to lend them to him. Hyacinth thanked her\xe2\x80\x94thanked\r\nher even too much, and felt both the kindness and the brilliant promise\r\nof the offer (he knew the exasperation of having volumes in his hands,\r\nfor external treatment, which he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take home at night, having\r\ntried that method surreptitiously during his first weeks at old Crook\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand come very near being sacked in consequence) while he wondered how\r\nsuch a system could be put into practice; whether she would expect him\r\nto call at her house and wait in the hall till the books were sent\r\nout to him. Rose Muniment exclaimed that that was her ladyship all\r\nover\xe2\x80\x94always wanting to make up to people for being less lucky than\r\nherself: she would take the shoes off her feet for any one that might\r\ntake a fancy to them. At this the visitor declared that she would stop\r\ncoming to see her if the girl caught her up that way for everything;\r\nand Rosy, without heeding the remonstrance, explained to Hyacinth that\r\nshe thought it the least she could do to give what she had. She was so\r\nashamed of being rich that she wondered the lower classes didn\xe2\x80\x99t break\r\ninto Inglefield and take possession of all the treasures in the Italian\r\nroom. She was a tremendous socialist; she was worse than any one\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwas worse even than Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if she\xe2\x80\x99s worse than me,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth returned at a venture,\r\nnot understanding the allusions to Inglefield and the Italian room,\r\nwhich Miss Muniment made as if she knew all about these places. After\r\nlearning more of the world he remembered this tone of Muniment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x94he was to have plenty of observation of it on other occasions\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nthat of a person in the habit of visiting the nobility at their\r\ncountry-seats; she talked about Inglefield as if she had stayed there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were so advanced!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the master of\r\nthe scene, who had been sitting silent and sidewise in a chair that\r\nwas too narrow for him, his big arm hugging the back. \xe2\x80\x9cHave we been\r\nentertaining an angel unawares?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth made out he was chaffing him, but he knew the way to face that\r\nsort of thing was to exaggerate one\xe2\x80\x99s meaning. \xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was\r\nadvanced? Why, I thought that was the principal thing about me. I think\r\nI go about as far as any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought the principal thing about you was that you knew French,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPaul Muniment said with an air of derision which showed him he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nput that ridicule upon him unless he liked him, at the same time that\r\nit revealed to him how he had come within an ace of posturing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know it for nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99ll say something that will take\r\nyour head off if you don\xe2\x80\x99t look out\xe2\x80\x94just the sort of thing they say so\r\nwell in French.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do say something of that kind; we should enjoy it so much!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nRosy in perfect good faith and clasping her hands for expectation.\r\n\r\nThe appeal was embarrassing, but Hyacinth was saved from the\r\nconsequences of it by a remark from Lady Aurora, who quavered out the\r\nwords after two or three false starts, appearing to address him, now\r\nthat she spoke to him directly, with a sort of overdone consideration.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like so very much to know\xe2\x80\x94it would be so interesting\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind\xe2\x80\x94how far exactly you do go.\xe2\x80\x9d She threw back her head very far\r\nand thrust her shoulders forward, and if her chin had been more adapted\r\nto such a purpose would have appeared to point it at him.\r\n\r\nThis challenge was hardly less alarming than the other, for he was far\r\nfrom being ready with an impressive formula. He replied, however, with\r\na candour in which he tried as far as possible to sink his vagueness:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m very strong indeed. I think I see my way to conclusions\r\nfrom which even Monsieur and Madame Poupin would shrink. Poupin, at any\r\nrate; I\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure about his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like so much to know Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Aurora murmured as if\r\npoliteness demanded that she should content herself with this answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Puppin isn\xe2\x80\x99t strong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Muniment; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can easily look over his\r\nhead! He has a sweet assortment of phrases\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re really pretty things\r\nto hear, some of them; but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a new idea these thirty years.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the old stock that has been withering in the window. All the\r\nsame he warms one up; he has a spark of the sacred fire. The principal\r\nconclusion Mr. Robinson sees his way to,\xe2\x80\x9d he added to Lady Aurora, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nthat your father ought to have his head chopped off and carried on a\r\npike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes, the French Revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about your father, my lady!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth\r\ninterposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever hear of the Earl of Inglefield?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rose Muniment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Aurora as if she were pleading for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely, but he\xe2\x80\x99s a landlord, and he has an hereditary seat and\r\na park of five thousand acres all to himself, while we\xe2\x80\x99re bundled\r\ntogether into this sort of kennel.\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth admired the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsistency till he saw he was amusing himself; after which he still\r\nadmired the way he could mix that up with the tremendous opinions\r\nit must have been certain he entertained. In his own imagination he\r\nassociated bitterness with the revolutionary passion; but the young\r\nchemical expert, at the same time that he was planning far ahead,\r\nseemed capable of turning revolutionists themselves into ridicule even\r\nfor the entertainment of the revolutionised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you often enough that I don\xe2\x80\x99t go with you at all,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Rose Muniment, whose recumbency appeared not in the least to\r\ninterfere with her universal participation. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll make a tremendous\r\nmistake if you try to turn everything round. There ought to be\r\ndifferences, and high and low, and there always will be, true as ever\r\nI lie here. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s against everything, pulling down them that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything points to great changes in this country, but if once our\r\nRosy\xe2\x80\x99s against them how can you be sure? That\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing that\r\nmakes me doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d her brother went on, looking at her with a placidity\r\nwhich showed the habit of indulgence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I may be ill, but I ain\xe2\x80\x99t buried, and if I\xe2\x80\x99m content with my\r\nposition\xe2\x80\x94such a position as it is\xe2\x80\x94surely other folk might be with\r\ntheirs. Her ladyship may think I\xe2\x80\x99m as good as her if she takes that\r\nnotion; but she\xe2\x80\x99ll have a deal to do to make me believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re much better than I, and I know very few people so good\r\nas you,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Aurora brought out, blushing not for her opinions but for\r\nher timidity. It was easy to see that though she was original she would\r\nhave liked to be even more original than she was. She was conscious,\r\nhowever, that such a declaration might appear rather gross to persons\r\nwho didn\xe2\x80\x99t see exactly how she meant it; so she added, as quickly as\r\nher hesitating manner permitted, to cover it up: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know there\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nthing you ought to remember, _\xc3\xa0 propos_ of revolutions and changes and\r\nall that sort of thing; I just mention it because we were talking of\r\nsome of the dreadful things that were done in France. If there were to\r\nbe a great disturbance in this country\xe2\x80\x94and of course one hopes there\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94it would be my impression that the people would behave in a\r\ndifferent way altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat people do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth allowed himself to inquire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the upper class, the people who\xe2\x80\x99ve got all the things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t call them the _people_,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Hyacinth, reflecting the\r\nnext instant that his remark was a little primitive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you call them the wretches, the scoundrels!\xe2\x80\x9d Rose Muniment\r\nsuggested, laughing merrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the things, but not all the brains,\xe2\x80\x9d her brother said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they stupid?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her ladyship. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the same,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99d all go abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo abroad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean like the French nobles who emigrated so much. They\xe2\x80\x99d stay at\r\nhome and resist; they\xe2\x80\x99d make more of a fight. I think they\xe2\x80\x99d fight very\r\nhard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to hear it, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99d win!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rosy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t collapse, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Aurora continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d struggle till they were beaten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you think they\xe2\x80\x99d be beaten in the end?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with a familiar confidence at which he was\r\ngreatly surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of course one hopes it won\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI infer from what you say that they talk it over a good deal among\r\nthemselves, to settle the line they\xe2\x80\x99ll take,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul Muniment.\r\n\r\nBut Rosy intruded before Lady Aurora could answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s wicked\r\nto talk it over, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we haven\xe2\x80\x99t any business to talk it over\r\nhere! When her ladyship says the aristocracy will make a fine stand I\r\nlike to hear her say it and I think she speaks in a manner that becomes\r\nher own position. But there\xe2\x80\x99s something else in her tone which, if\r\nI may be allowed to say so, I think a great mistake. If her ladyship\r\nexpects, in case of the lower classes coming up in that odious manner,\r\nto be let off easily, for the sake of the concessions she may have made\r\nin advance, I\xe2\x80\x99d just advise her to save herself the disappointment\r\nand the trouble. They won\xe2\x80\x99t be a bit the wiser and they won\xe2\x80\x99t either\r\nknow or care. If they\xe2\x80\x99re going to trample over their betters it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\non account of her having seemed to give up everything to us here that\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll let _her_ off. They\xe2\x80\x99ll trample on her just the same as on the\r\nothers, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll say she has got to pay for her title and her grand\r\nrelations and her fine appearance. Therefore I advise her not to waste\r\nher good-nature in trying to let herself down. When you\xe2\x80\x99re up so high\r\nas that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stay there; and if the powers above have made you\r\na lady the best thing you can do is to hold up your head. I can promise\r\nyour ladyship _I_ would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe close logic of this speech and the quaint self-possession with\r\nwhich the little bedridden speaker delivered it struck Hyacinth as\r\namazing and confirmed his idea that the brother and sister were a\r\nmost extraordinary pair. It had a terrible effect on poor Lady Aurora,\r\nby whom so stern a lesson from so humble a quarter had evidently not\r\nbeen expected and who sought refuge from her confusion in a series of\r\npleading gasps, while Paul Muniment, with his humorous density, which\r\nwas deliberate, and acute too, not seeing, or at any rate not heeding,\r\nthat she had been sufficiently snubbed by his sister, inflicted a fresh\r\nhumiliation in saying: \xe2\x80\x9cRosy\xe2\x80\x99s right, my lady. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use trying to\r\nbuy yourself off. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do enough; your sacrifices don\xe2\x80\x99t count.\r\nYou spoil your fun now and you don\xe2\x80\x99t get it made up to you later. To\r\nall you people nothing will ever be made up. Eat your pudding while you\r\nhave it; you mayn\xe2\x80\x99t have it long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Aurora listened to him with her eyes on his face, and as they\r\nrested there Hyacinth scarcely knew what to make of her expression.\r\nAfterwards he thought he could attach a meaning to it. She got up\r\nquickly when Muniment had ceased speaking; the movement suggested she\r\nhad taken offence and he would have liked to show her he thought she\r\nhad been rather roughly used. But she gave him no chance, not glancing\r\nat him for a moment. Then he saw he was mistaken and that if she had\r\nflushed considerably it was only with the excitement of pleasure, the\r\nenjoyment of such original talk and of seeing her friends at last as\r\nfree and familiar as she wished them to be. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the most delightful\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94I wish every one could know you!\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must\r\nreally be going.\xe2\x80\x9d She went to the bed and bent over Rosy and kissed\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaul will see you as far as you like on your way home,\xe2\x80\x9d this young\r\nwoman remarked.\r\n\r\nLady Aurora protested, but Paul, without protesting in return, only\r\ntook up his hat and smiled at her as if he knew his duty. On this her\r\nladyship said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you may see me downstairs; I forgot it was so\r\ndark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must take her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s own candle and you must call a cab,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosy\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t go in cabs. I walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you may go on the top of a \xe2\x80\x99bus if you like; you can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nbeing superb,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Muniment declared, watching her sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuperb? Oh mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the poor devoted, grotesque lady, leaving\r\nthe room with Paul, who told Hyacinth to wait for him a little. She\r\nneglected to take leave of our young man, and he asked himself what was\r\nto be hoped from that sort of people when even the best of them\xe2\x80\x94those\r\nthat wished to be agreeable to the _demos_\xe2\x80\x94reverted inevitably to the\r\nsupercilious. She had said no more about lending him her books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lives in Belgrave Square; she has ever so many brothers and\r\nsisters; one of her sisters is married to Lord Warmington,\xe2\x80\x9d Rose\r\nMuniment instantly began, not apparently in the least discomposed at\r\nbeing left alone with a strange young man in a room which was now half\r\ndark again, thanks to her brother\xe2\x80\x99s having carried off the second and\r\nmore brilliant candle. She was so interested for the time in telling\r\nHyacinth the history of Lady Aurora that she appeared not to remember\r\nhow little she knew about himself. Her ladyship had dedicated her\r\nlife and her pocket-money to the poor and sick; she cared nothing for\r\nparties and races and dances and picnics and cards and life in great\r\nhouses, the usual amusements of the aristocracy: she was like one of\r\nthe saints of old come to life again out of a legend. She had made\r\ntheir acquaintance, Paul\xe2\x80\x99s and hers, about a year before, through\r\na friend of theirs, such a fine brave young woman, who was in Saint\r\nThomas\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital for a surgical operation. She had been laid up there\r\nfor weeks during which Lady Aurora, always looking out for those who\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help themselves, used to come and talk to her and read to her,\r\ntill the end of her time in the ward, when the poor girl, parting with\r\nher kind friend, told her how she knew of another unfortunate creature\r\n(for whom there was no place there, because she was incurable) who\r\nwould be mighty thankful for any little attention of that sort. She\r\nhad given Lady Aurora the address in Audley Court and the very next\r\nday her ladyship had knocked at their door. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because she was\r\npoor\xe2\x80\x94though in all conscience they were pinched enough\xe2\x80\x94but because\r\nshe had so little satisfaction in her limbs. Lady Aurora came very\r\noften, for several months, without meeting Paul, because he was always\r\nat his work; but one day he came home early on purpose to find her,\r\nto thank her for her goodness, and also to see (Miss Muniment rather\r\nshyly intimated) if she were really so good as his extravagant little\r\nsister made her out. Rosy had a triumph after that: Paul had to admit\r\nthat her ladyship was beyond anything that any one in his waking senses\r\nwould believe. She seemed to want to give up everything to those who\r\nwere below her and never to expect any thanks at all. And she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nalways preaching and showing you your duty; she wanted to talk to\r\nyou sociable-like, as if you were just her own sister. And _her_ own\r\nsisters were the highest in the land, and you might see her name in\r\nthe newspapers the day they were presented to the Queen. Lady Aurora\r\nhad been presented too, with feathers in her head and a long tail to\r\nher gown; but she had turned her back on it all with a kind of terror\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsort of shivering sinking state which she had often described to Miss\r\nMuniment. The day she had first seen Paul was the day they became so\r\nintimate, the three of them together\xe2\x80\x94if she might apply such a word as\r\nthat to such a peculiar connexion. The little woman, the little girl,\r\nas she lay there (Hyacinth scarce knew how to characterise her) told\r\nour young man a very great secret, in which he found himself too much\r\ninterested to think of criticising so precipitate a confidence. The\r\nsecret was that, of all the people she had ever seen in the world, her\r\nladyship thought Rosy\xe2\x80\x99s Paul the very cleverest. And she had seen the\r\ngreatest, the most famous, the brightest of every kind, for they all\r\ncame to stay at Inglefield, thirty and forty of them at once. She had\r\ntalked with them all and heard them say their best (and you could fancy\r\nhow they would try to give it out at such a place as that, where there\r\nwas nearly a mile of conservatories and a hundred wax candles were\r\nlighted at a time) and at the end of it all she had made the remark to\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94and she had made it to Rosy too\xe2\x80\x94that there was none of them\r\nhad such a head on his shoulders as the young man in Audley Court.\r\nRosy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t spread such a rumour as that in the court itself, but\r\nshe wanted every friend of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s (and she could see Hyacinth\r\nwas a real one by the way he listened) to know what was thought of\r\nhim by them that had an experience of intellect. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to\r\ngive it out that her ladyship had lowered herself in any manner to\r\na person that earned his bread in a dirty shop (clever as he _might_\r\nbe), but it was easy to see she minded what he said as if he had been\r\na bishop\xe2\x80\x94or more indeed, for she didn\xe2\x80\x99t think much of bishops, any\r\nmore than Paul himself, and that was an idea she had got from him.\r\nOh, she took it none so ill if he came back from his work before\r\nshe had gone, and to-night Hyacinth could see for himself how she\r\nhad lingered. This evening, she was sure, her ladyship would let him\r\nwalk home with her half the way. This announcement gave Hyacinth the\r\nprospect of a considerable session with his communicative hostess; but\r\nhe was very glad to wait, for he was vaguely, strangely excited by her\r\ntalk, fascinated by the little queer-smelling, high-perched interior,\r\nencumbered with relics, treasured and polished, of a poor north-country\r\nhome, bedecked with penny ornaments and related in so unexpected a\r\nmanner to Belgrave Square and the great landed estates. He spent half\r\nan hour with Paul Muniment\xe2\x80\x99s small, odd, sharp, crippled, chattering\r\nsister, who gave him an impression of education and native wit (she\r\nexpressed herself far better than Pinnie or than Milly Henning) and\r\nwho startled, puzzled and at the same time rather distressed him by\r\nthe manner in which she referred herself to the most abject class\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nclass that prostrated itself, that was in a fever and flutter, in\r\nthe presence of its betters. That was Pinnie\xe2\x80\x99s attitude of course,\r\nbut Hyacinth had long ago perceived that his adoptive mother had\r\ngenerations of plebeian patience in her blood, and that though she had\r\na tender soul she had not a truly high spirit. He was more entertained\r\nthan afflicted, however, by Miss Muniment\xe2\x80\x99s tone, and he was thrilled\r\nby the frequency and familiarity of her allusions to a kind of life\r\nhe had often wondered about; this was the first time he had heard it\r\ndescribed with that degree of authority. By the nature of his mind he\r\nwas perpetually, almost morbidly conscious that the circle in which he\r\nlived was an infinitesimally small shallow eddy in the roaring vortex\r\nof London, and his imagination plunged again and again into the flood\r\nthat whirled past it and round it, in the hope of being carried to some\r\nbrighter, happier vision\xe2\x80\x94the vision of societies where, in splendid\r\nrooms, with smiles and soft voices, distinguished men, with women who\r\nwere both proud and gentle, talked of art, literature and history.\r\nWhen Rosy had delivered herself to her complete satisfaction on the\r\nsubject of Lady Aurora she became more quiet, asking as yet, however,\r\nno straight questions of her guest, whom she seemed to take very much\r\nfor granted. He presently remarked that she must let him come very soon\r\nagain, and he added, to explain this wish: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you seem to me\r\nvery curious people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Muniment didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least repudiate the imputation. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\r\nI daresay we seem very curious. I think we\xe2\x80\x99re generally thought so;\r\nespecially me, being so miserable and yet so lively.\xe2\x80\x9d And she laughed\r\ntill her bed creaked again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s lucky you\xe2\x80\x99re ill; perhaps if you had your health you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe all over the place,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth suggested. And he went on candidly: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t make it out, your being so up in everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you need make it out! But you would, perhaps, if you\r\nhad known my father and mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere they such a rare lot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99d say so if you had ever been in the mines. Yes, in the\r\nmines, where the filthy coal\xe2\x80\x99s dug out. That\xe2\x80\x99s where my father came\r\nfrom\xe2\x80\x94he was working in the pit when he was a child of ten. He never\r\nhad a day\xe2\x80\x99s schooling in his life, but he climbed up out of his black\r\nhole into daylight and air, and he invented a machine, and he married\r\nmy mother, who came out of Durham, and (by her people) out of the pits\r\nand the awfulness too. My father had no great figure, but _she_ was\r\nmagnificent\xe2\x80\x94the finest woman in the country and the bravest and the\r\nbest. She\xe2\x80\x99s in her grave now, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to look at it even if\r\nit were in the nearest churchyard. My father was as black as the coal\r\nhe worked in: I know I\xe2\x80\x99m just his pattern, barring that _he_ did have\r\nhis legs, when the liquor hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got into them. Yet between him and my\r\nmother, for grand high intelligence, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much to choose. But\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of brains if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a backbone? My poor father\r\nhad even less of that than I, for with me it\xe2\x80\x99s only the body that can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand up, and with him it was the very nature. He invented, for use\r\nin machine-shops, a mechanical improvement\xe2\x80\x94a new kind of beam-fixing,\r\nwhatever that is\xe2\x80\x94and he sold it at Bradford for fifteen pounds: I mean\r\nthe whole right and profit of it and every hope and comfort of his\r\nfamily. He was always straying and my mother was always bringing him\r\nback. She had plenty to do, with me a puny ailing brat from the moment\r\nI opened my eyes. Well, one night he strayed so far that he never came\r\nhome, or only came a loose bloody bundle of clothes. He had fallen into\r\na gravel-pit, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where he was going. That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason my\r\nbrother won\xe2\x80\x99t ever touch so much as you could wet your finger with, and\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve only a drop once a week or so in the way of a strengthener. I\r\ntake what her ladyship brings me, but I take no more. If she could but\r\nhave come to us before my mother went\xe2\x80\x94that would have been a saving! I\r\nwas only nine when my father died, and I\xe2\x80\x99m three years older than Paul.\r\nMy mother did for us with all her might, and she kept us decent\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nsuch a useless little mess as me can be said to be decent. At any rate\r\nshe kept me alive, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a proof she was handy. She went to the\r\nwash-tub, and she might have been a queen as she stood there with her\r\nbare arms in the foul linen and her long hair braided on her head. She\r\nwas terrible handsome, but he\xe2\x80\x99d have been a bold man that had taken on\r\nhimself to tell her so. And it was from her we got our education\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwas determined we should rise above the common. You might have thought,\r\nin her position, that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go into such things, but she was a\r\nrare one for keeping you at your book. She could hold to her idea when\r\nmy poor father couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and her idea for us was that Paul should get\r\nlearning and should look after me. You can see for yourself that that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat has come of it. How he got it\xe2\x80\x99s more than I can say, as we never\r\nhad a penny to pay for it; and of course my mother\xe2\x80\x99s head wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nbeen of much use if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a head himself. Well, it was all in\r\nthe family. Paul was a boy that would learn more from a yellow poster\r\non a wall or a time-table at a railway station than many a young fellow\r\nfrom a year at college. That was his only college, poor lad\xe2\x80\x94picking\r\nup what he could. Mother was taken when she was still needed, nearly\r\nfive years ago. There was an epidemic of typhoid, and of course it\r\nmust pass me over, the goose of a thing\xe2\x80\x94only that I\xe2\x80\x99d have made a poor\r\nfeast\xe2\x80\x94and just lay that really grand character on her back. Well, she\r\nnever again made it ache over her soapsuds, straight and broad as it\r\nwas. Not having seen her, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose Muniment in\r\nconclusion; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I just wanted you to understand that our parents had\r\njolly good brains at least to give us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth listened to this eloquence\xe2\x80\x94the clearest statement of anything\r\nhe had ever heard made by a woman\xe2\x80\x94with the deepest interest, and\r\nwithout being in the least moved to allow for filial exaggeration;\r\ninasmuch as his impression of the brother and sister was such as it\r\nwould have taken a much more marvellous tale to account for. The very\r\nway Rose Muniment talked of brains made him feel this; she pronounced\r\nthe word as if she were distributing prizes for intellectual eminence\r\nfrom off a platform. No doubt the weak inventor and the strong worker\r\nhad been fine specimens, but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t diminish the merit of their\r\nhighly original offspring. The girl\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvirtues (even now that her age had become more definite to him he\r\nthought of her as a girl) touched in his heart a chord that was\r\nalways ready to throb\xe2\x80\x94the chord of melancholy aimless wonder as to the\r\ndifference it would have made for his life to have had some rich warm\r\npresence like that in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very fond of your brother?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired after a little.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of his hostess glittered at him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you ever quarrel with him\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll see whose side I shall take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, before that I shall make you like _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very possible, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see how I shall fling you over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy then do you object so to his views\xe2\x80\x94his ideas about the way the\r\npeople are to come up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll get over them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hyacinth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only known him an hour or two, but\r\nI deny that with all my strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the way you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make me like you\xe2\x80\x94contradicting me so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMiss Muniment asked with familiar archness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use, when you tell me I shall be sacrificed? One might as\r\nwell perish for a lamb as for a sheep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re a lamb at all. Certainly you\xe2\x80\x99re not if you want\r\nall the great people pulled down and the most dreadful scenes enacted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you believe in human equality? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want anything done for\r\nthe groaning, toiling millions\xe2\x80\x94those who have been cheated and crushed\r\nand bamboozled from the beginning of time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth asked this question with considerable heat, but the effect\r\nof it was to send his companion off into a new ring of laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsay that just like a man my brother described to me three days ago,\r\na little man at some club whose hair stood up\xe2\x80\x94Paul imitated the way\r\nhe raved and stamped. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you do either, but you use\r\nalmost the same words as him.\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth scarce knew what to make of\r\nthis allusion or of the picture offered him of Paul Muniment casting\r\nridicule on those who spoke in the name of the down-trodden. But Rosy\r\nwent on before he had time to do more than reflect that there would\r\nevidently be great things to learn about her brother: \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nleast objection to seeing the people improved, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nsee the aristocracy lowered an inch. I like so much to look at it up\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to know my Aunt Pinnie\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s just such another benighted\r\nidolater!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re making me like you very fast! And pray who\xe2\x80\x99s your Aunt\r\nPinnie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a dressmaker and a charming little woman. I should like her to\r\ncome and see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m not in her line\xe2\x80\x94I never had on a dress in my life. But,\r\nas a charming woman, I should be delighted to see her,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Muniment\r\nhastened to add.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring her some day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and then he went on rather\r\nincongruously, for he was irritated by the girl\xe2\x80\x99s optimism, thinking it\r\na shame her sharpness should be enlisted on the wrong side. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nwant, for yourself, a better place to live in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe jerked herself up and for a moment he thought she would jump out\r\nof her bed at him. \xe2\x80\x9cA better place than this? Pray how could there be\r\na better place? Every one thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s lovely; you should see our view\r\nby daylight\xe2\x80\x94you should see everything I\xe2\x80\x99ve got. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re used to\r\nsomething very fine, but Lady Aurora says that in all Belgrave Square\r\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t such a cosy little room. If you think I\xe2\x80\x99m not perfectly\r\ncontent you\xe2\x80\x99re very much mistaken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch an attitude could only exasperate him, and his exasperation made\r\nhim indifferent to the mistake of his having appeared to sniff at Miss\r\nMuniment\xe2\x80\x99s quarters. Pinnie herself, submissive as she was, had spared\r\nhim that sort of displeasure; she groaned over the dinginess of Lomax\r\nPlace sufficiently to remind him that she had not been absolutely\r\nstultified by misery. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you sometimes make your brother very\r\ncross?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, smiling, of his present entertainer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCross? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you take us for! I never saw him lose his\r\ntemper in his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be a rum customer! Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he really care for\xe2\x80\x94for what we were\r\ntalking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a space Rosy was silent; then she replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat my brother really\r\ncares for\xe2\x80\x94well, one of these days, when you know, you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth stared. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t he tremendously deep in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d What should he\r\ncall the mystery?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeep in what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in what\xe2\x80\x99s going on beneath the surface. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he belong to\r\nimportant things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he belongs to\xe2\x80\x94you may ask him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rosy,\r\nwho laughed gaily again as the opening door re-admitted the subject\r\nof their conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have crossed the water with her\r\nladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder who enjoyed their walk most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a handy old girl and she has a goodish stride,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s in love with you simply, Mr. Muniment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, my dear, for an admirer of the aristocracy you allow yourself\r\na licence,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul scoffed, smiling at Hyacinth.\r\n\r\nHyacinth got up, feeling that really he had paid a long visit; his\r\ncuriosity was far from satisfied, but there was a limit to the time one\r\nshould spend in a young lady\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping apartment. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she is; why\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d he struck out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she is then; she\xe2\x80\x99s daft enough for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere have been fine folks before who have patted the people on the\r\nback and pretended to enter into their life,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she\r\nonly playing with that idea or is she in earnest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn earnest\xe2\x80\x94in terrible deadly earnest, my dear fellow! I think she\r\nmust be rather crowded out at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrowded out of Inglefield? Why, there\xe2\x80\x99s room for three hundred!\xe2\x80\x9d Rosy\r\nbroke in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of mob that\xe2\x80\x99s in possession, no wonder she\r\nprefers Camberwell. We must be kind to the poor lady,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul added in\r\na tone that Hyacinth noticed. He attributed a remarkable meaning to\r\nit; it seemed to say that people such as he were now so sure of their\r\ngame that they could afford to be magnanimous; or else it expressed\r\na prevision of the doom that hung over her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s head. Muniment\r\nasked if Hyacinth and Rosy had got on together, and the girl replied\r\nthat Mr. Robinson had made himself most agreeable. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you must tell\r\nme all about him after he goes, for you know I don\xe2\x80\x99t know him much\r\nmyself,\xe2\x80\x9d said her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you everything\xe2\x80\x94you know how I like describing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth found himself amused at the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s account of his\r\nefforts to please her, the fact being that he had only listened to\r\nher own eager discourse without opening his mouth; but Paul, whether\r\nor no guessing the truth, said to him all pertinently: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nwonderful\xe2\x80\x94she can describe things she has never seen. And they\xe2\x80\x99re just\r\nlike the reality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosy declared. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the advantage\r\nof my lying here in such a manner. I see everything in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to see your brother\xe2\x80\x99s meetings\xe2\x80\x94his secret societies and\r\nhis revolutionary clubs. You put that aside when I asked you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t ask her that sort of thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul, lowering at\r\nHyacinth with a fierce frown\xe2\x80\x94an expression he perceived in a moment to\r\nbe facetiously assumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do then, since you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me anything definite\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be definite enough when you get hanged for it!\xe2\x80\x9d Rosy exclaimed\r\nmockingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want to poke your head into ugly black holes?\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment\r\nasked, laying his hand on Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and shaking it gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you belong to the party of action?\xe2\x80\x9d our young man gravely\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the way he has picked up all the silly bits of catchwords!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPaul cried in not unkindly derision to his sister. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have got\r\nthat precious phrase out of the newspapers, out of some drivelling\r\nleader. Is that the party you want to belong to?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with his\r\nclear eyes ranging over his diminutive friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll show me the thing itself I shall have no more occasion to\r\nmind the newspapers,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth candidly pleaded, rejoicing all the\r\nwhile to feel himself in such a relation. It was his view of himself,\r\nand not an unfair one, that his was a character that would never sue\r\nfor a favour; but now he felt that in any connexion with Paul Muniment\r\nsuch a law would be suspended. This rare man he could go on his knees\r\nto without a sense of humiliation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat thing do you mean, infatuated, deluded youth?\xe2\x80\x9d Paul pursued,\r\nrefusing to be serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know you do go to places you had far better keep out of, and\r\nthat often when I lie here and listen to steps on the stairs I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nthey are coming in to make a search for your papers,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Muniment\r\nlucidly interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day they find my papers, my dear, will be the day you\xe2\x80\x99ll get up\r\nand dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you ask me to come home with you for?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth demanded\r\nas he twirled his hat. It was an effort for a moment to keep the\r\ntears from his eyes; he saw himself forced to put such a different\r\nconstruction on his new friend\xe2\x80\x99s hospitality. He had had a happy\r\nimpression that Muniment had divined in him a possible associate of\r\na high type in a subterranean crusade against the existing order of\r\nthings, whereas it now came over him that the real use he had been put\r\nto was to beguile an hour for a pert invalid. That was all very well,\r\nand he would sit by Miss Rosy\xe2\x80\x99s bedside, were it a part of his service,\r\nevery day in the week; only in such a case it should be his reward to\r\nenjoy the confidence of her brother. This young man justified at the\r\npresent juncture the high estimate Lady Aurora Langrish had formed of\r\nhis intelligence: whatever his natural reply to Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s question\r\nwould have been he invented straight off a better one and said at\r\nrandom, smiling and not knowing exactly what his visitor had meant:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I ask you to come with me for? To see if you\xe2\x80\x99d be afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat there was to be afraid of was to Hyacinth a quantity equally\r\nvague; but he answered quickly enough: \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99ve only to try me\r\nto see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure that if you introduce him to some of your low wicked friends\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll be quite satisfied after he has looked round a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss\r\nMuniment remarked irrepressibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are just the kind of people I want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth rang out.\r\n\r\nHis sincerity appeared to touch his friend. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I see you\xe2\x80\x99re a good\r\n\xe2\x80\x99un. Just meet me some night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, where?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hyacinth eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you where when we get away from _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d And Muniment led\r\nhim good-humouredly out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral months after Hyacinth had made his acquaintance, Millicent\r\nHenning remarked that it was high time our hero should take her to some\r\nfirst-class place of amusement. He proposed hereupon the Canterbury\r\nMusic Hall; at which she tossed her head and affirmed that when a young\r\nlady had done for a young man what she had done for him the least he\r\ncould do was to give her an evening at some theatre in the Strand.\r\nHyacinth would have been a good deal at a loss to say exactly what she\r\nhad done for him, but it was familiar to him by this time that she\r\nregarded him as under great obligations. From the day she had come\r\nto look him up in Lomax Place she had taken a position, largely, in\r\nhis life, and he had seen poor Pinnie\xe2\x80\x99s wan countenance grow several\r\ndegrees more blank. Amanda Pynsent\xe2\x80\x99s forebodings had been answered to\r\nthe letter; the flaring cometary creature had become a fixed star. She\r\nhad never spoken to him of Millicent but once, several weeks after her\r\ninterview with the girl; and this had not been in a tone of rebuke, for\r\nshe had divested herself for ever of any maternal prerogative. Tearful,\r\ntremulous, deferential inquiry was now her only weapon, and nothing\r\ncould be more humble and circumspect than the manner in which she made\r\nuse of it. He was never at home of an evening, at present, and he had\r\nmysterious ways of spending his Sundays, with which church-going had\r\nnothing to do. The time had been when often, after tea, he sat near\r\nthe lamp with the dressmaker and, while her fingers flew, read out to\r\nher the works of Dickens and of Scott; happy hours of vain semblance\r\nthat he had forgotten the wrong she had done him, so that she could\r\nalmost forget it herself. But now he gulped down his tea so fast that\r\nhe hardly took off his hat while he sat there, and Pinnie, with her\r\nquick eye for all matters of costume, noticed that he wore it still\r\nmore gracefully askew than usual, cocking it with a victorious exalted\r\nair. He hummed to himself; he fingered his moustache; he looked out\r\nof window when there was nothing to look at; he seemed preoccupied,\r\nlaunched in intellectual excursions, half anxious and half in spirits.\r\nDuring the whole winter Miss Pynsent explained everything by four words\r\nmurmured beneath her breath: \xe2\x80\x9cThat beastly forward jade!\xe2\x80\x9d On the single\r\noccasion, however, on which she had sought relief from her agitation in\r\nan appeal to Hyacinth she didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust herself to designate the girl by\r\nepithet or title.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing I want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him in a manner\r\nwhich might have seemed casual if in her silence, knowing her as well\r\nas he did, he had not already perceived the implication of her thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she expect you to marry her, dearest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes who expect me? I should like to see the woman who does!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you know who I mean. The one that came after you\xe2\x80\x94and picked\r\nyou right up\xe2\x80\x94from the other end of London.\xe2\x80\x9d And at the remembrance\r\nof that insufferable scene poor Pinnie flamed for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthere plenty of vulgar fellows in that low part where she lives without\r\nher ravaging over here? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t she stick to her own beat, I should\r\nlike to know?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth had flushed at the question, and she had seen\r\nsomething in his face to make her change her tone. \xe2\x80\x9cJust promise me\r\nthis, my precious child: that if you get into any sort of mess with\r\nthat piece you\xe2\x80\x99ll immediately confide it to your poor old Pinnie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor old Pinnie sometimes makes me quite sick,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked for\r\nanswer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a mess do you suppose I shall get into?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, suppose she does come it over you that you promised to marry\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry\r\nany one\xe2\x80\x94the way she sees it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how the dickens does she see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you imagine I\xe2\x80\x99d tell a lady\xe2\x80\x99s secrets?\xe2\x80\x9d the young man returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh laws, if she was a lady I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pinnie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery woman\xe2\x80\x99s a lady when she has placed herself under one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprotection,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth declared with his little manner of a man of the\r\ngreat world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder your protection? Oh I say!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pinnie, staring. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s to protect you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had said this she repented, because it seemed just the\r\nsort of exclamation that would have made Hyacinth bite her head off.\r\nOne of the things she loved him for, however, was that he gave you\r\ntouching surprises in this line, had sudden inconsistencies of temper\r\nthat were all for your advantage. He was by no means always mild when\r\nhe ought to have been, but he was sometimes heavenly when he needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave been at all. At such moments Pinnie wanted to kiss him and had\r\noften tried to make Mr. Vetch understand what fascinating traits of\r\ncharacter she was always noting in their young friend. This particular\r\none was rather difficult to describe, and Mr. Vetch never would admit\r\nthat he understood, or that he had observed anything that seemed to\r\ncorrespond to the dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat confused psychological sketch.\r\nIt was a comfort to her in these days, and almost the only one she had,\r\nthat she was sure Anastasius Vetch understood a good deal more than he\r\nfelt bound to acknowledge. He was always up to his old game of being\r\na great deal cleverer than cleverness itself required; and it consoled\r\nher present weak, pinched feeling to know that, though he still talked\r\nof the boy as if it would be a pity to take him too seriously, that\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t the way he thought of him. He also took him seriously and had\r\neven a certain sense of duty in regard to him. Miss Pynsent went so far\r\nas to say to herself that the fiddler probably had savings and that no\r\none had ever known of any one else belonging to him. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nmentioned it to Hyacinth for the world, for fear of leading up to a\r\ndisappointment; but she had visions of a foolscap sheet folded away in\r\nsome queer little bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s box (she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fancy what men kept in\r\nsuch places) on which the youth\xe2\x80\x99s name would have been written down in\r\nvery big letters before a solicitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m unprotected in the nature of things,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, smiling at\r\nhis too scrupulous companion. Then he added: \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfrom that girl any danger will come to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think why you like her,\xe2\x80\x9d Pinnie remarked as if she had spent\r\non the question treasures of impartiality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s jolly to hear one woman on the subject of another,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re kind and good and yet you\xe2\x80\x99re ready\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d He gave a sigh as\r\nfor long experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what am I ready to do? I\xe2\x80\x99m not ready to see you gobbled up\r\nbefore my eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid. She won\xe2\x80\x99t drag me to the altar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she think you good enough\xe2\x80\x94for one of the beautiful\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Ennings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, my poor Pinnie,\xe2\x80\x9d he wearily pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsometimes think there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a single thing in life that you understand.\r\nOne of these days she\xe2\x80\x99ll marry an alderman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn alderman\xe2\x80\x94that creature?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn alderman or a banker or a bishop or some of that bloated kind. She\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to end her career to-day\xe2\x80\x94she wants to begin it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wish she\xe2\x80\x99d take you later!\xe2\x80\x9d the dressmaker returned.\r\n\r\nHyacinth said nothing for a little, but then broke out: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you\r\nafraid of? Look here, we had better clear this up once for all. Are you\r\nafraid of my marrying a girl out of a shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, would you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pinnie with conciliatory\r\neagerness. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way I like to hear you talk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I\xe2\x80\x99d marry any one who would marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cThe kind of girl who\xe2\x80\x99d look at me is the kind of girl I\xe2\x80\x99d never\r\nlook at.\xe2\x80\x9d He struck Pinnie as having thought it all out; which didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsurprise her, as she had been familiar from his youth with his way\r\nof following things up. But she was always delighted when he made a\r\nremark that showed he was conscious of being of fine clay\xe2\x80\x94flashed out\r\nan allusion to his not being what he seemed. He was not what he seemed,\r\nbut even with Pinnie\xe2\x80\x99s valuable assistance he had not succeeded in\r\nrepresenting to himself very definitely what he was. She had placed\r\nat his disposal for this purpose a passionate idealism which, employed\r\nin some case where it could have consequences, might have been termed\r\nprofligate and which yet never cost her a scruple or a compunction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure a princess might look at you and be none the worse!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndeclared in her delight at this assurance, more positive than any she\r\nhad yet received, that he was safe from the worse danger. This the\r\ndressmaker considered to be the chance of his marrying some person\r\nof her own base order. Still it came over her that his taste might be\r\nlowered, and before the subject was dropped, on the present occasion,\r\nshe said that of course he must be quite aware of all that was wanting\r\nto such a girl as Millicent \xe2\x80\x99Enning\xe2\x80\x94who visibly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth any\r\nstruggle for her aspirate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t bother about what\xe2\x80\x99s wanting to her. I\xe2\x80\x99m content with what\r\nshe has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContent, dearest\xe2\x80\x94how do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d the little dressmaker quavered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContent to make an intimate friend of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible I should discuss these matters with you,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth\r\ngrandly enough replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I see that. But I should think she\xe2\x80\x99d bore you sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMiss Pynsent threw off cunningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe does, I assure you, to extinction!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you spend every evening with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere should you like me to spend my evenings? At some beastly\r\npublic-house\xe2\x80\x94or at the Italian opera?\xe2\x80\x9d His association with Miss\r\nHenning was not so close as that, but nevertheless he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nthe trouble to prove to poor Pinnie that he enjoyed her society only\r\ntwo or three times a week; that on other evenings he simply strolled\r\nabout the streets (this boyish habit clung to him) and that he had even\r\noccasionally the resource of going to the Poupins\xe2\x80\x99 or of gossiping and\r\nsmoking a pipe at some open house-door, when the night was not cold,\r\nwith a fellow-mechanic. Later in the winter, after he had made Paul\r\nMuniment\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance, the aspect of his life changed considerably,\r\nthough Millicent continued to be exceedingly mixed up with it. He hated\r\nthe taste of liquor and still more the taste of the places where it was\r\nsold; besides which the types of misery and vice that one was liable\r\nto see collected in them frightened and harrowed him, made him ask\r\nhimself questions that pierced the deeper because they were met by no\r\nanswer. It was both a blessing and a drawback to him that the delicate,\r\ncharming character of the work he did at old Crook\xe2\x80\x99s, under Eustache\r\nPoupin\xe2\x80\x99s influence, was a kind of education of the taste, trained him\r\nin the finest discriminations, in the recognition of the rare and the\r\nhatred of the cheap. This made the brutal, garish, stodgy decoration\r\nof public-houses, with their deluge of gaslight, their glittering\r\nbrass and pewter, their lumpish woodwork and false colours, detestable\r\nto him. He had been still very young when the \xe2\x80\x9cgin-palace\xe2\x80\x9d ceased to\r\nconvey to him an idea of the palatial.\r\n\r\nFor this unfortunate but remarkably-organised youth every displeasure\r\nor gratification of the visual sense coloured his whole mind, and\r\nthough he lived in Pentonville and worked in Soho, though he was poor\r\nand obscure and cramped and full of unattainable desires, nothing in\r\nlife had such an interest or such a price for him as his impressions\r\nand reflexions. They came from everything he touched, they made him\r\nvibrate, kept him thrilled and throbbing, for most of his waking\r\nconsciousness, and they constituted as yet the principal events\r\nand stages of his career. Fortunately they were often an immense\r\namusement. Everything in the field of observation suggested this or\r\nthat; everything struck him, penetrated, stirred; he had in a word\r\nmore news of life, as he might have called it, than he knew what to\r\ndo with\xe2\x80\x94felt sometimes as he could have imagined an overwhelmed man of\r\nbusiness to whom the post brought too many letters. The man of business\r\nindeed could keep a secretary, but what secretary could have cleared\r\nup for Hyacinth some of the strange communications of life? He liked\r\nto talk about these things, but it was only a few here and there he\r\ncould discuss with Milly. He allowed Miss Pynsent to imagine that his\r\nhours of leisure were almost exclusively dedicated to this young lady,\r\nbecause, as he said to himself, if he were to account to her for every\r\nevening in the week it would make no difference\xe2\x80\x94she would stick to her\r\nsuspicion; and he referred this perversity to the general weight of\r\nmisconception under which he at this crude period of his growth held\r\nit was his lot to languish. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if one was a little more\r\nor a little less misunderstood. He might indeed have remembered it\r\nmattered to Pinnie, who, after her first relief at hearing him express\r\nhimself so properly on the subject of a matrimonial connexion with\r\nMiss Henning, allowed her faded, kind, weak face little by little to\r\nlengthen out to its old solemnity. This came back as the days went\r\non, for it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much comfort that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry the young\r\nwoman in Pimlico when he allowed himself to be held as tight as if he\r\ndid. For the present, however, she simply said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh well, if you see\r\nher as she is I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what you do\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a sentiment implying a certain\r\nmoral recklessness on the part of the good little dressmaker. She was\r\nirreproachable herself, but she had lived more than fifty years in a\r\nworld of wickedness; like so many London women of her class and kind\r\nshe had little sentimental softness for her own sex, whose general\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpaying\xe2\x80\x9d seemed the simplest and most natural arrangement; and she\r\njudged it quite a minor evil that Millicent should be left lamenting\r\nif only Hyacinth might get out of the scrape. Between a young person\r\nwho had taken a gross risk and a premature, lowering marriage for her\r\nbeloved little boy she very well knew which she preferred. It should be\r\nadded that her view of Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s power to look after herself was such\r\nas to make it absurd to pity her in advance. Pinnie thought Hyacinth\r\nthe cleverest young man in the, or at least in their, world, but her\r\nstate of mind implied that the young lady in Pimlico was cleverer. Her\r\nability, at any rate, was of a kind that precluded the knowledge of\r\nsuffering, whereas Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s was somehow fairly founded on it.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had enjoyed for three months the acquaintance of\r\nthe brother and sister in Audley Court the whole complexion of his\r\nlife seemed changed; it was pervaded by an element of romance which\r\novershadowed, though by no means eclipsing, the brilliant figure of\r\nMiss Henning. It was pitched in a higher key altogether and appeared\r\nto command a view of horizons equally fresh and vast. Millicent\r\ntherefore shared her dominion without knowing exactly what it was that\r\ndrew her old playfellow off and without indeed demanding of him an\r\naccount she was not on her own side prepared to give. Hyacinth was,\r\nin the language of the circle in which she moved, her personal fancy,\r\nand she was content to fill as regards himself the same eminent and\r\nsomewhat irresponsible position. She had the assurance that she was a\r\nbeneficent friend: fond of him and careful of him as an elder sister\r\nmight be; warning him as no one else could do against the dangers of\r\nthe town; putting that stiff common sense, of which she was convinced\r\nthat she possessed an extraordinary supply, at the service of his\r\nincurable verdancy; looking after him generally as no one, poor child,\r\nhad ever done. Millicent made light of the dingy dressmaker in this\r\nview of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s meagre little past (she thought Pinnie no better\r\nthan a starved cat) and enjoyed herself immensely in the character of\r\nguide and philosopher. She felt that character never so high as when\r\nshe pushed the young man with a robust elbow or said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nyou _are_ a sharp \xe2\x80\x99un, you are!\xe2\x80\x9d Her theory of herself, as we know,\r\nwas that she was the \xe2\x80\x9cbest sort\xe2\x80\x9d in the world, as well as one of the\r\ngreatest beauties and quickest wits, and there could be no better proof\r\nof her kindness of heart than her disinterested affection for a snippet\r\nof a bookbinder. Her sociability was certainly immense, and so were\r\nher vanity, her grossness, her presumption, her appetite for beer, for\r\nbuns, for entertainment of every kind. She represented for Hyacinth\r\nduring this period the eternal feminine, and his taste, considering\r\nhe was fastidious, will be wondered at; the judgement will be that she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t represent it very favourably.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be believed that he criticised his inclination even while\r\nhe gave himself up to it, and that he often wondered he should find so\r\nmuch to attract in a girl in whom he found so much to condemn. She was\r\nvulgar, clumsy and grotesquely ignorant; her conceit was proportionate\r\nand she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a grain of tact or of quick perception. And yet there\r\nwas something so elementally free in her, by his loose measure,\r\nshe carried with such an air the advantages she did possess, that\r\nher figure constantly mingled itself even with those bright visions\r\nhovering before him after Paul Muniment had opened a queerly-placed\r\nbut far-reaching window. She was bold and generous and incalculable,\r\nand if she was coarse she was neither false nor cruel. She laughed with\r\nthe laugh of the people and if you hit her hard enough would cry with\r\ntheir tears. When he himself was not letting his imagination wander\r\namong the haunts of the aristocracy and stretching it in the shadow\r\nof an ancestral beech to read the last number of the _Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_ he was occupied with contemplations of a very different kind;\r\nhe was absorbed in the struggles and sufferings of the millions whose\r\nlife flowed in the same current as his and who, though they constantly\r\nexcited his disgust and made him shrink and turn away, had the power\r\nto chain his sympathy, to raise it to passion, to convince him for the\r\ntime at least that real success in the world would be to do something\r\nwith them and for them. All this, strange to say, was never so vivid as\r\nin Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s company\xe2\x80\x94which is a proof of his fantastic, erratic way\r\nof seeing things. She had no such ideas about herself; they were almost\r\nthe only ideas she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have. She had no theories about redeeming or\r\nuplifting the people; she simply loathed them, for being so dirty, with\r\nthe outspoken violence of one who had known poverty and the strange\r\nbedfellows it makes in a very different degree from Hyacinth, brought\r\nup (with Pinnie to put sugar in his tea and let him never want for\r\nneckties) like a regular little swell.\r\n\r\nMillicent, to hear her talk, only asked to keep her skirts clear\r\nand marry some respectable tea-merchant. But for our hero she was\r\nmagnificently plebeian, in the sense that implied loud recklessness of\r\ndanger and the qualities that shine forth in a row. She summed up the\r\nsociable humorous ignorant chatter of the masses, their capacity for\r\noffensive and defensive passion, their instinctive perception of their\r\nstrength on the day they should really exercise it; and as much as\r\nany of this their ideal of something smug and prosperous, where washed\r\nhands and oiled hair and plates in rows on dressers and stuffed birds\r\nunder glass and family photographs of a quite similar effect would\r\nsymbolise success. She was none the less plucky for being at bottom a\r\nshameless Philistine, ambitious of a front garden with rockwork; and\r\nshe presented the plebeian character in none the less plastic a form.\r\nHaving the history of the French Revolution at his fingers\xe2\x80\x99 ends,\r\nHyacinth could easily see her (if there should ever be barricades in\r\nthe streets of London) with a red cap of liberty on her head and her\r\nwhite throat bared so that she should be able to shout the louder the\r\nMarseillaise of that hour, whatever it might be. If the festival of\r\nthe Goddess of Reason should ever be enacted in the British Capital\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nHyacinth could consider such possibilities without a smile, so much was\r\nit a part of the little religion he had to remember always that there\r\nwas no knowing what might happen\xe2\x80\x94if this solemnity, I say, should be\r\nrevived in Hyde Park, who was better designated than Miss Henning to\r\nfigure in a grand statuesque manner as the heroine of the occasion?\r\nIt was plain she had laid her inconsequent admirer under a peculiar\r\nspell, since he could associate her with such scenes as that while she\r\nconsumed beer and buns at his expense. If she had a weakness it was\r\nfor prawns; and she had, all winter, a plan for his taking her down to\r\nGravesend, where this luxury was cheap and abundant, when the fine long\r\ndays should arrive. She was never so frank and facetious as when she\r\ndwelt on the details of a project of this kind; and then Hyacinth was\r\nreminded afresh that it was an immense good fortune for him she was so\r\nhandsome. If she had been ugly he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have listened to her; but\r\nthe rare bloom and grand style of her person glorified even her accent,\r\ninterfused her cockney genius with prismatic hues, gave her a large and\r\nconstant impunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nShe desired at last to raise their common experience to a loftier\r\nlevel, to enjoy what she called a high-class treat. Their commerce had\r\nbeen condemned for the most part to go forward in the streets, the\r\nwintry, dusky, foggy streets, which looked bigger and more numerous\r\nin their perpetual obscurity and in which everything was covered\r\nwith damp, gritty smut, an odour extremely agreeable to Miss Henning.\r\nHappily she shared Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s relish of vague perambulation and was\r\nstill more addicted than he to looking into the windows of shops,\r\nbefore which, in long, contemplative halts, she picked out freely\r\nthe articles she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind having put up for her. He invariably\r\npronounced the objects of her selection hideous and made no scruple to\r\nassure her she had the worst taste of any girl in the place. Nothing he\r\ncould say to her affronted her so much, for her pretensions in the way\r\nof a cultivated judgement were boundless. Had not indeed her natural\r\naptitude been fortified, in the neighbourhood of Buckingham Palace\r\n(there was scarcely anything they didn\xe2\x80\x99t sell in the great shop of\r\nwhich she was an ornament), by daily contact with the freshest products\r\nof modern industry? Hyacinth laughed this establishment to scorn and\r\nmade the point that there was nothing in it from top to bottom that\r\na real artist would look at. She inquired with answering derision\r\nif this were a description of his own few inches; but in reality she\r\nwas fascinated as much as she was provoked by his attitude of being\r\ndifficult to please, of seeing indescribable differences among the\r\nsmartest things. She had given herself out originally as very knowing,\r\nbut he could make her gape with doubts. When once in a while he pointed\r\nout a commodity that he condescended to like (this didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen often,\r\nbecause the only shops in which there was a chance of his making such\r\na discovery were closed at nightfall) she stared and bruised him with\r\nher elbow, declaring that if any one should give her such a piece of\r\nrubbish she would sell it for fourpence. Once or twice she asked him to\r\nbe so good as to explain to her in what its superiority consisted\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rid herself of a suspicion that there might be something in\r\nhis judgement and was angry at not finding herself as positive as any\r\none. Then he would reply that it was no use attempting to tell her;\r\nshe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand and had better continue to admire the insipid\r\nproductions of an age that had lost the sense of fineness\xe2\x80\x94a phrase she\r\nremembered, proposing to herself even to make use of it on some future\r\noccasion, but was quite unable to interpret.\r\n\r\nWhen her companion demeaned himself in this manner it was not with\r\na view of strengthening the tie that united him to his childhood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend; but the effect followed on Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s side and the girl was\r\nproud to think herself in possession of a young man whose knowledge\r\nwas of so high an order that it was inexpressible. In spite of her\r\nvanity she was not so convinced of her perfection as not to be full of\r\nungratified aspirations; she had an idea it might be to her advantage\r\nsome day to exhibit a sample of that learning; and at the same time,\r\nwhen, in consideration for instance of a jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s gas-lighted\r\ndisplay in Great Portland Street, Hyacinth lingered for five minutes\r\nin perfect silence and she delivered herself according to her wont at\r\nsuch junctures, she was a thousand miles from guessing the perverse\r\nsentiments that made it impossible for him to speak. She could long\r\nfor things she was not likely to have; envy other people for possessing\r\nthem and say it was a \xe2\x80\x9cregular shime\xe2\x80\x9d; draw brilliant pictures of what\r\nshe should do with them if she did have them; and pass immediately,\r\nwith a mind unencumbered by superfluous inductions, to some other\r\ntopic equally intimate and personal. The sense of privation with her\r\nwas often extremely acute; but she could always put her finger on\r\nthe remedy. With her fellow-sufferer the case was very different; the\r\nremedy for him was terribly vague and inaccessible. He was liable to\r\nmoods in which the sense of exclusion from all he would have liked most\r\nto enjoy in life settled on him like a pall. They had a bitterness, but\r\nthey were not invidious\xe2\x80\x94they were not moods of vengeance, of imaginary\r\nspoliation: they were simply states of paralysing melancholy, of\r\ninfinite sad reflexion, in which he felt how in this world of effort\r\nand suffering life was endurable, the spirit able to expand, only in\r\nthe best conditions, and how a sordid struggle in which one should go\r\ndown to the grave without having tasted them was not worth the misery\r\nit would cost, the dull demoralisation it would involve.\r\n\r\nIn such hours the great roaring indifferent world of London seemed to\r\nhim a huge organisation for mocking at his poverty, at his inanition;\r\nand then its vulgarest ornaments, the windows of third-rate jewellers,\r\nthe young man in a white tie and a crush-hat who dandled by on his way\r\nto a dinner-party in a hansom that nearly ran over one\xe2\x80\x94these familiar\r\nphenomena became symbolic, insolent, defiant, took on themselves to\r\nmake him smart with the sense that _he_ was above all out of it. He\r\nfelt, moreover, that there was neither consolation nor refutation in\r\nsaying to himself that the immense majority of mankind were out of\r\nit with him and appeared to put up well enough with the annoyance.\r\nThat was their own affair; he knew nothing of their reasons or their\r\nresignation, and if they chose neither to rebel nor to compare he\r\nat least, among the disinherited, would keep up the standard. When\r\nthese fits were on our young man his brothers of the people fared,\r\ncollectively, very ill at his hands; their function then was to\r\nrepresent in massive shape precisely the grovelling interests which\r\nattracted one\xe2\x80\x99s contempt, and the only acknowledgment one owed them\r\nwas for the completeness of the illustration. Everything which in a\r\ngreat city could touch the sentient faculty of a youth on whom nothing\r\nwas lost ministered to his conviction that there was no possible good\r\nfortune in life of too \xe2\x80\x9cquiet\xe2\x80\x9d an order for him to appreciate\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nprivilege, no opportunity, no luxury to which he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t do full\r\njustice. It was not so much that he wanted to enjoy as that he\r\nwanted to know; his desire wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be pampered but to be initiated.\r\nSometimes of a Saturday in the long evenings of June and July he made\r\nhis way into Hyde Park at the hour when the throng of carriages, of\r\nriders, of brilliant pedestrians was thickest; and though lately,\r\non two or three of these occasions, he had been accompanied by\r\nMiss Henning, whose criticism of the scene was rich and distinct, a\r\ntremendous little drama had taken place privately on the stage of his\r\ninner consciousness. He wanted to drive in every carriage, to mount\r\non every horse, to feel on his arm the hand of every pretty woman in\r\nthe place. In the midst of this his sense was vivid that he belonged\r\nto the class whom the \xe2\x80\x9cbloated\xe2\x80\x9d as they passed didn\xe2\x80\x99t so much as rest\r\ntheir eyes on for a quarter of a second. They looked at Millicent, who\r\nwas safe to be looked at anywhere and was one of the handsomest girls\r\nin any company, but they only reminded him of the high human walls,\r\nthe deep gulfs of tradition, the steep embankments of privilege and\r\ndense layers of stupidity fencing the \xe2\x80\x9clikes\xe2\x80\x9d of him off from social\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nAnd this was not the fruit of a morbid vanity on his part, or of a\r\njealousy that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be intelligent; his personal discomfort was\r\nthe result of an intense admiration for what he had missed. There\r\nwere individuals whom he followed with his eyes, with his thoughts,\r\nsometimes even with his steps; they seemed to tell him what it was to\r\nbe the flower of a high civilisation. At moments he was aghast when he\r\nreflected that the cause he had secretly espoused, the cause from which\r\nM. Poupin and Paul Muniment (especially the latter) had within the last\r\nfew months drawn aside the curtain, proposed to itself to bring about\r\na state of things in which that particular scene would be impossible.\r\nIt made him even rather faint to think that he must choose; that he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t (with any respect for his own consistency) work underground\r\nfor the enthronement of the democracy and yet continue to enjoy in\r\nhowever platonic a manner a spectacle which rested on a hideous social\r\ninequality. He must either suffer with the people as he had suffered\r\nbefore, or he must apologise to others, as he sometimes came so near\r\ndoing to himself, for the rich; inasmuch as the day was certainly near\r\nwhen these two mighty forces would come to a death-grapple. Hyacinth\r\nthought himself obliged at present to have reasons for his feelings;\r\nhis intimacy with Paul Muniment, which had now grown very great, laid\r\na good deal of that sort of responsibility upon him. Muniment laughed\r\nat his reasons whenever he produced them, but appeared to expect him\r\nnevertheless to have them ready on demand, and Hyacinth had ever a\r\ndesire to do what he expected. There were times when he said to himself\r\nthat it might very well be his fate to be divided to the point of\r\ntorture, to be split open by sympathies that pulled him in different\r\nways; for hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he an extraordinarily mingled current in his blood,\r\nand from the time he could remember wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there one half of him always\r\neither playing tricks on the other or getting snubs and pinches from\r\nit?\r\n\r\nThat dim, dreadful, confused legend of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s history, as regards\r\nwhich what Pinnie had been able to tell him when he first began to\r\nquestion her was at once too much and too little\xe2\x80\x94this stupefying\r\nexplanation had supplied him first and last with a hundred different\r\ntheories of his identity. What he knew, what he guessed had sickened\r\nand what he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know tormented him; but in his illuminated ignorance\r\nhe had fashioned forth an article of faith. This had gradually emerged\r\nfrom the depths of darkness in which he found himself plunged as a\r\nconsequence of the challenge he had addressed to Pinnie\xe2\x80\x94while he was\r\nstill only a child\xe2\x80\x94on the memorable day that had transformed the whole\r\nface of his future. It was one January afternoon when he had come in\r\nfrom a walk. She was seated at her lamp, as usual, with her work, and\r\nhad begun to tell him of a letter one of the lodgers had got describing\r\nthe manner in which his brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s shop at Nottingham had been\r\nrifled by burglars. He had listened to her story, standing in front\r\nof her, and then by way of response had suddenly said to her: \xe2\x80\x9cWho was\r\nthat awful woman you took me to see ever so long ago?\xe2\x80\x9d The expression\r\nof her white face as she looked up at him, her fear of such an attack\r\nall dormant after so many years\xe2\x80\x94this strange, scared, sick glance was\r\na thing he could never forget, any more than the tone, with her breath\r\nfailing her, in which she had repeated \xe2\x80\x9cThat awful woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat woman in the prison years ago\xe2\x80\x94how old was I?\xe2\x80\x94who was dying and\r\nwho kissed me so, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been kissed, as I never shall be again!\r\nWho _was_ she, who WAS she?\xe2\x80\x9d Poor Pinnie, to do her justice, had made,\r\nafter she recovered her breath, a gallant fight: it had lasted a week;\r\nit was to leave her spent and sore for ever after, and before it was\r\nover Anastasius Vetch had been called in. At his instance she had\r\nretracted the falsehoods with which she had previously tried to put\r\nthe boy off, and had made at last a confession and a report which he\r\nwas satisfied to believe as complete as her knowledge. Hyacinth could\r\nnever have told you why the crisis had occurred on such a day, why his\r\nquestion had broken out at that particular moment. The strangeness\r\nof the matter to himself was that the germ of his curiosity should\r\nhave developed so slowly; that the haunting wonder which now, as he\r\nlooked back, appeared to fill his whole childhood, should only after\r\nso long an interval have crept up to the air. It was only of course\r\nlittle by little that he had recovered his bearings in his new and more\r\npoignant consciousness; little by little that he had reconstructed\r\nhis antecedents, taken the measure, so far as was possible, of his\r\nheredity. His having the courage to disinter from the _Times_ in the\r\nreading-room of the British Museum a report of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s trial\r\nfor the murder of Lord Frederick Purvis, which was very copious, the\r\naffair having been quite a _cause c\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8bre_; his resolution in sitting\r\nunder that splendid dome and, with his head bent to hide his hot\r\neyes, going through every syllable of the ghastly record, had been an\r\nachievement of comparatively recent years. There were certain things\r\nPinnie knew that appalled him; and there were others, as to which\r\nhe would have given his hand to have some light, that it made his\r\nheart ache supremely to find she was honestly ignorant of. He scarce\r\nunderstood what sort of favour Mr. Vetch wished to make with him (as\r\na compensation for the precious part he had played in the business\r\nyears before) when the fiddler permitted himself to pass judgement\r\non the family of the wretched young nobleman for not having provided\r\nin some manner for the infant child of his assassin. Why should they\r\nhave provided when it was evident they had refused absolutely to\r\nrecognise his lordship\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility? Pinnie had to admit this\r\nunder Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s terrible cross-questioning; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend with\r\nany show of evidence that Lord Whiteroy and the other brothers (there\r\nhad been no less than seven, most of them still living) had at the\r\ntime of the trial given any symptom of believing Florentine Vivier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nasseverations. That was their affair; he had long since made up his\r\nmind that his own was very different. One couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe at will, and\r\nfortunately, in the case, he had no effort to make; for from the moment\r\nhe began to consider the established facts (few as they were and poor\r\nand hideous) he regarded himself immutably as the son of the recreant\r\nand sacrificed Lord Frederick.\r\n\r\nHe had no need to reason about it; all his nerves and pulses pleaded\r\nand testified. His mother had been a daughter of the wild French\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94all Pinnie could tell him of her parentage was that Florentine\r\nhad once mentioned that in her extreme childhood her father, his gun\r\nin his hand, had fallen in the blood-stained streets of Paris on a\r\nbarricade; but on the other side it took an English aristocrat to\r\naccount for him, though a poor specimen apparently had to suffice.\r\nThis, with its further implications, became Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s article of\r\nfaith; the reflexion that he was a bastard involved in a remarkable\r\nmanner the reflexion that he was a gentleman. He was conscious he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t hate the image of his father as he might have been expected\r\nto do; and he supposed this was because Lord Frederick had paid so\r\ntremendous a penalty. It was in the exaction of that penalty that the\r\nmoral proof for him resided; his mother wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have armed herself\r\non account of any injury less cruel than the passage of which her\r\nmiserable baby was the living sign. She had avenged herself because\r\nshe had been thrown over, and the bitterness of that wrong had been in\r\nthe fact that he, hopeless brat, lay there in her lap. _He_ was the one\r\nproperly to have been sacrificed: that remark our young man often made\r\nto himself. That his judgement of the whole question was passionate and\r\npersonal and took little account of any disturbing conflict of evidence\r\nis proved by the importance he attached for instance to the name by\r\nwhich his mother had told poor Pinnie (when this excellent creature\r\nconsented to take him) that she wished him to be called. Hyacinth had\r\nbeen the name of her father, a republican clockmaker, the martyr of\r\nhis opinions, whose memory she professed to worship; and when Lord\r\nFrederick had insinuated himself into her confidence he had had reasons\r\nfor preferring to be known as plain Mr. Robinson\xe2\x80\x94reasons, however,\r\ninto which, in spite of the light thrown upon them at the trial, it was\r\ndifficult after so many years to enter.\r\n\r\nHyacinth had never known of Mr. Vetch\xe2\x80\x99s saying more than once to\r\nPinnie, \xe2\x80\x9cIf her contention as regards that dissolute young swell was\r\ntrue why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she make the child bear his real name instead of his\r\nfalse one?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an inquiry which the dressmaker had answered, with some\r\ningenuity, by remarking that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t call him after a man she\r\nhad murdered, as one must suppose her unwilling to publish to every\r\none his connexion with a crime that had been so much talked about.\r\nIf Hyacinth had assisted at this little discussion it is needless\r\nto say that he would have sided with Miss Pynsent; though that his\r\njudgement was independently formed is proved by the fact that Pinnie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfearfully indiscreet attempts at condolence should not have made him\r\nthrow up his version in disgust. It was after the complete revelation\r\nthat he understood the romantic innuendoes with which his childhood\r\nhad been surrounded and of which he had never caught the meaning;\r\nthey having seemed but a feature of the general fact of the poor\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s professional life\xe2\x80\x94so much cutting and trimming and shaping and\r\nembroidering, so much turning and altering and doing-up. When it came\r\nover him that she had for years made a fool of him to himself and to\r\nothers he could have beaten her for grief and shame; and yet before he\r\nadministered this rebuke he had to remember that she only chattered\r\n(though she professed to have been extraordinarily dumb) about a\r\nmatter over which he spent nine-tenths of his own time in all gloomily\r\nbrooding. When she tried to console him for the horror of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhistory by descanting on the glory of the Purvises and reminding him\r\nthat he was related through them to half the aristocracy of England he\r\nfelt her to be turning the tragedy of his life into a monstrous farce;\r\nand yet he none the less continued to cherish the belief that he was\r\na gentleman born. He allowed her to tell him nothing about the family\r\nin question, and his impracticability on this subject was one of the\r\nreasons of the deep dejection of her later years. If he had only let\r\nher idealise him a little to himself she would have felt she was making\r\nup by so much for her grand mistake. He sometimes saw the name of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s kin in the newspaper, but he then always cast the sheet away.\r\nHe had nothing to ask of them and wished to prove to himself that he\r\ncould ignore them (who had been willing to let him die like a rat)\r\nas completely as they ignored him. A thousand times yes, he was with\r\nthe people and every possible vengeance of the people as against such\r\nshameless egoism as that; but all the same he was happy to feel he had\r\nblood in his veins that would account for the finest sensibilities.\r\n\r\nHe had no money to pay for places at a theatre in the Strand, Millicent\r\nHenning having made it clear to him that on this occasion she expected\r\nsomething better than the pit. \xe2\x80\x9cShould you like the royal box or a\r\ncouple of stalls at ten bob apiece?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of her on a note of that\r\ntoo uniform irony which formed the basis of almost all their talk.\r\nShe had replied that she would content herself with a seat in the\r\nsecond balcony, in the very front; and as such a position involved\r\nan expenditure still beyond his compass he waited one night on Mr.\r\nVetch, to whom he had already more than once had recourse in moments of\r\npecuniary embarrassment. His relations with the caustic fiddler were\r\nof the oddest and much easier when put to the proof than in theory.\r\nMr. Vetch had let him know\xe2\x80\x94long before this and with the purpose of\r\ncovering Pinnie to the utmost\xe2\x80\x94the part he had played at the crisis of\r\nthat question of her captive\xe2\x80\x99s being taken to call on Mrs. Bowerbank;\r\nand Hyacinth, in the face of this information, had asked with some\r\nsublimity what the devil the fiddler had had to do with his private\r\naffairs. Their neighbour had replied that it was not as an affair of\r\nhis but as an affair of Pinnie\xe2\x80\x99s he had considered the matter; and our\r\nhero had afterwards let it drop, though he had never been formally\r\nreconciled to so officious a critic. Of course his feeling on this\r\nhead had been immensely modified by the trouble Mr. Vetch had taken to\r\nget him a place with old Crook; and at the period of which I write it\r\nhad long been familiar to him that the author of that benefit didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare a straw what he thought of his advice at the dark hour and in\r\nfact took a perverse pleasure in \xe2\x80\x9cfollowing\xe2\x80\x9d the career of a youth put\r\ntogether of such queer pieces. It was impossible to Hyacinth not to be\r\nconscious that this projected attention was kindly; and to-day, at any\r\nrate, he would have declared that nothing could have made up to him for\r\nnot knowing the truth, horrible as it might be. His miserable mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nembrace seemed to furnish him with an inexhaustible fund of motive, and\r\nin the conditions that was a support. What he chiefly objected to in\r\nMr. Vetch was the betrayed habit of still regarding him as extremely\r\njuvenile; he would have got on much better with a better recognition\r\nof his being already a man of the world. The obscure virtuoso knew an\r\nimmense deal about society and seemed to know the more because he never\r\nswaggered\xe2\x80\x94it was only little by little you discovered it; but that was\r\nno reason for his looking as if his chief boon in life was a private\r\ndiverting commentary on the conversation of his young friend. Hyacinth\r\nfelt that he gave considerable evidence of patience with this when\r\nhe occasionally asked his fellow-resident in Lomax Place to lend him\r\nhalf-a-crown. Somehow circumstances had of old tied them together, and\r\nthough this partly vexed the little bookbinder it also touched him; he\r\nhad more than once solved the problem of deciding how to behave (when\r\nthe fiddler exasperated him) by simply asking of him some substantial\r\nservice. Mr. Vetch had never once refused. It was satisfactory to\r\nHyacinth to remember as much when knocking at his door late, after\r\nallowing him time to come home from the theatre. He knew his habits:\r\nhe never went straight to bed, but sat by his fire an hour, smoking his\r\npipe, mixing a grog and reading some old book. Hyacinth could tell when\r\nto go up by the light in his window, which he could see from a court\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to see you for a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in\r\nresponse to the remark with which his neighbour greeted him; \xe2\x80\x9cand I may\r\nas well tell you immediately what has brought me at present\xe2\x80\x94in addition\r\nto the desire to ask after your health. I want to take a young lady to\r\nthe theatre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vetch was habited in a tattered dressing-gown; his apartment smelt\r\nstrongly of the liquor he was consuming. Divested of his evening-gear\r\nhe looked to our hero so plucked and blighted as on the spot to\r\nsettle his claims in the event of a social liquidation; he too was\r\nunmistakably a creditor. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you find your young lady rather\r\nexpensive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI find everything expensive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth as if to finish that\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially, I suppose, your secret societies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d the young man asked with a fine stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you told me in the autumn that you were just about to join a few.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few? How many do you suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d But our friend checked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou suppose if I had been serious I\xe2\x80\x99d tell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, oh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mr. Vetch. Then he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to\r\ntake her to my shop, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say she won\xe2\x80\x99t go there. She wants something in the\r\nStrand: that\xe2\x80\x99s a great point. She wants very much to see _The Pearl of\r\nParaguay_. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to pay anything, if possible; I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say\r\nI haven\xe2\x80\x99t a penny. But as you know people at the other theatres and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say that you do each other little favours from place\r\nto place, _\xc3\xa0 charge de revanche_, it occurred to me you might be able\r\nto get me an order. The piece has been running a long time and most\r\npeople (except poor devils like me) must have seen it: therefore there\r\nprobably isn\xe2\x80\x99t a rush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vetch listened in silence and presently said: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want a box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; something more modest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not a box?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the fiddler in a tone the youth knew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the clothes people wear in that sort of place,\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nyou must have such a definite reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your young lady\xe2\x80\x94has _she_ the clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I daresay; she seems to have everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere does she get \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. She belongs to a big shop; she has to be fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you have a pipe?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Vetch asked, pushing an old tobacco-pouch\r\nacross the table; and while the young man helped himself he puffed a\r\nwhile in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will she do with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he finally asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will who do with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour big beauty\xe2\x80\x94Miss Henning. I know all about her from Pinnie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you know what she\xe2\x80\x99ll do with me!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth returned with rather\r\na scornful laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but, after all, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t very much matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now the other thing\xe2\x80\x94what do they call it? the Subterranean?\xe2\x80\x94are\r\nyou very deep in that?\xe2\x80\x9d the fiddler went on as if he had not heard him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Pinnie tell you also about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, our friend Puppin has told me a good deal. He knows you\xe2\x80\x99ve put\r\nyour head into something. Besides, I see it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vetch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you see it, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got such a speaking eye. Any one can tell, to look at you,\r\nthat you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken some oath on bloody bones, that you belong to some\r\nterrible gang. You seem to say to every one, \xe2\x80\x98Slow torture won\xe2\x80\x99t induce\r\nme to tell where it meets!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t get me an order then?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth said in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy, I offer you a box. I take the greatest interest in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey smoked together a while and at last Hyacinth remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cIt has\r\nnothing to do with the Subterranean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it more terrible, more deadly secret?\xe2\x80\x9d his companion asked with\r\nextreme seriousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you pretended to be a radical,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so I am\xe2\x80\x94of the old-fashioned, constitutional, milk-and-water,\r\njog-trot sort. I\xe2\x80\x99m not an exterminator.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know what we may be when the time comes,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth observed\r\nmore sententiously than he intended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the time coming then, my dear young friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to give you any more of a warning than\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled our hero.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you to do so much, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, and to rush in here at\r\nthe small hours for the purpose. Meanwhile, in the few weeks or months\r\nor years, or whatever they are, that are left, you wish to crowd in\r\nall possible enjoyment with the young ladies: that\xe2\x80\x99s a very natural\r\ninclination.\xe2\x80\x9d To which Mr. Vetch irrelevantly added: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see many\r\nforeigners?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a good many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you think of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, all sorts of things. I rather like Englishmen best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Muniment for example?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, what do you know about _him_?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him at the Puppins\xe2\x80\x99. I know you and he are as thick as\r\nthieves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll distinguish himself some day very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth, who was\r\nperfectly willing and indeed very proud to be thought a close ally of\r\na highly original man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely\xe2\x80\x94very likely. And what will _he_ do with you?\xe2\x80\x9d the fiddler\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\nHyacinth got up; they looked at each other hard. \xe2\x80\x9cDo get me two good\r\nplaces in the second balcony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vetch replied that he would do what he could, and three days\r\nafterwards he handed his young friend the coveted order. He accompanied\r\nit with the injunction, \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better put in all the fun you can, you\r\nknow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SECOND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nHyacinth and his companion took their seats with extreme promptitude\r\nbefore the curtain rose on _The Pearl of Paraguay_. Thanks to\r\nMillicent\xe2\x80\x99s eagerness not to be late they encountered the discomfort\r\nwhich had constituted her main objection to going into the pit:\r\nthey waited for twenty minutes at the door of the theatre, in a\r\ntight, stolid crowd, before the official hour of opening. Millicent,\r\nbareheaded and powerfully laced, presented a splendid appearance\r\nand, on Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s part, gratified a youthful, ingenuous pride of\r\npossession in every respect save a tendency, while ingress was denied\r\nthem, to make her neighbours feel her elbows and to comment loudly and\r\nsarcastically on the situation. It was more clear to him even than it\r\nhad been before that she was a young lady who in public places might\r\neasily need a champion or an apologist. Hyacinth knew there was only\r\none way to apologise for a \xe2\x80\x9cfemale\xe2\x80\x9d when the female was attached very\r\nclosely and heavily to one\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and was reminded afresh of how little\r\nconstitutional aversion Miss Henning had to a row. He had an idea she\r\nmight think his own taste ran even too little in that direction, and\r\nentertained visions of violent confused scenes in which he should in\r\nsome way distinguish himself: he scarcely knew in what way and imagined\r\nhimself more easily routing some hulking adversary by an exquisite\r\napplication of the retort courteous than by flying at him with a pair\r\nof very small fists.\r\n\r\nBy the time they had reached their places in the balcony she was rather\r\nflushed and a good deal ruffled; but she had composed herself in season\r\nfor the rising of the curtain on the farce preceding the melodrama\r\nand which the pair had had no intention of losing. At this stage a\r\nmore genial agitation took possession of her and she surrendered her\r\nsympathies to the horse-play of the traditional prelude. Hyacinth found\r\nit less amusing, but the theatre, in any conditions, was full of sweet\r\ndeception for him. His imagination projected itself lovingly across\r\nthe footlights, gilded and coloured the shabby canvas and battered\r\naccessories, losing itself so effectually in the fictive world that\r\nthe end of the piece, however long or however short, brought with\r\nit something of the alarm of a stoppage of his personal life. It was\r\nimpossible to be more friendly to the dramatic illusion. Millicent, as\r\nthe audience thickened, rejoiced more largely and loudly, held herself\r\nas a lady, surveyed the place as if she knew all about it, leaned back\r\nand leaned forward, fanned herself with majesty, gave her opinion upon\r\nthe appearance and coiffure of every woman within sight, abounded\r\nin question and conjecture and produced from her pocket a little\r\npaper of peppermint-drops of which under cruel threats she compelled\r\nHyacinth to partake. She followed with attention, though not always\r\nwith success, the complicated adventures of the Pearl of Paraguay\r\nthrough scenes luxuriantly tropical, in which the male characters wore\r\nsombreros and stilettos and the ladies either danced the cachucha or\r\nfled from licentious pursuit; but her eyes wandered intermittently\r\nto the occupants of the boxes and stalls, concerning several of whom\r\nshe had theories which she imparted to Hyacinth, while the play went\r\non, greatly to his discomfiture, he being unable to conceive of such\r\nlevity. She had the pretension of knowing who every one was; not\r\nindividually and by name, but as regards their exact social station,\r\nthe quarter of London in which they lived and the amount of money they\r\nwere prepared to spend in the neighbourhood of Buckingham Palace.\r\nShe had seen the whole town pass through her establishment there,\r\nand though Hyacinth, from his infancy, had been watching it at his\r\nown point of view, his companion made him feel all the characteristic\r\npoints he had missed. Her interpretations differed from his largely\r\nin being so very bold and irreverent. Miss Henning\xe2\x80\x99s observation of\r\nthe London world had not been of a nature to impress her with its high\r\nmoral tone, and she had a free off-hand cynicism which imposed itself.\r\nShe thought most ladies hypocrites and had in all ways a low opinion\r\nof her own sex, which more than once before this she had justified to\r\nHyacinth by narrating observations of a surprising kind gathered during\r\nher career as a shop-girl. There was a pleasing inconsequence therefore\r\nin her being moved to tears in the third act of the play, when the\r\nPearl of Paraguay, dishevelled and distracted, dragging herself on\r\nher knees, implored the stern hidalgo her father to believe in her\r\ninnocence in spite of circumstances appearing to condemn her\xe2\x80\x94a midnight\r\nmeeting with the wicked hero in the grove of cocoanuts. It was at this\r\ncrisis none the less that she asked Hyacinth who his friends were in\r\nthe principal box on the left of the stage and let him know that a\r\ngentleman seated there had been watching him at intervals for the past\r\nhalf-hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatching _me_! I like that! When I want to be watched I take you with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he has looked at me,\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent answered as if she had no\r\ninterest in denying that. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re the one he wants to get hold of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get hold of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you ninny: don\xe2\x80\x99t hang back. He may make your fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like him to come and sit by you I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and take a\r\nwalk in the Strand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth, entering into the humour of the\r\noccasion but not seeing from where he was placed any gentleman in the\r\nbox. Millicent explained that the mysterious observer had just altered\r\nhis position; he had gone to the back, which must have had considerable\r\ndepth. There were other persons there, out of sight; she and Hyacinth\r\nwere too much on the same side. One of them was a lady concealed by the\r\ncurtain; her arm, bare save for its bracelets, was visible at moments\r\non the cushioned ledge. Hyacinth saw it in effect reappear there, and\r\neven while the piece proceeded regarded it with a certain interest;\r\nbut till the curtain fell at the end of the act there was no further\r\nsymptom that a gentleman wished to get hold of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow do you say it\xe2\x80\x99s me he\xe2\x80\x99s after?\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent asked abruptly, giving\r\nhim a sidelong dig while the fiddlers in the orchestra began to scrape\r\ntheir instruments for the interlude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; I\xe2\x80\x99m only the pretext,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth replied, after he had\r\nlooked a moment, in a manner which he flattered himself was a proof\r\nof quick self-possession. The gentleman designated by his friend was\r\nonce more at the front and leaning forward with his arms on the edge.\r\nHyacinth saw he was looking straight at him, and our young man returned\r\nhis gaze\xe2\x80\x94an effort not rendered the more easy by the fact that after an\r\ninstant he recognised him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if he knows us he might give some sign, and if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\nmight leave us alone,\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent declared, abandoning the distinction\r\nshe had made between herself and her companion. She had no sooner\r\nspoken than the gentleman complied with the first-mentioned of these\r\nconditions; he smiled at Hyacinth across the house\xe2\x80\x94he nodded to him\r\nwith unmistakable friendliness. Millicent, perceiving this, glanced\r\nat the young man from Lomax Place and saw that the demonstration had\r\nbrought a deep colour to his cheek. He was blushing, flushing; whether\r\nwith pleasure or embarrassment didn\xe2\x80\x99t immediately appear. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, I\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94is it one of your grand relations?\xe2\x80\x9d she promptly asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nI can stare as well as him\xe2\x80\x9d; and she told Hyacinth it was a \xe2\x80\x9cshime\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nto bring a young lady to the play when you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t so much as an\r\nopera-glass for her to look at the company. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he one of those lords\r\nyour aunt was always talking about in the Plice? Is he your uncle or\r\nyour grandfather or your first or second cousin? No, he\xe2\x80\x99s too young for\r\nyour grandfather. What a pity I can\xe2\x80\x99t see if he looks like you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt any other time Hyacinth would have thought these inquiries in\r\nthe worst possible taste, but now he was too much given up to other\r\nreflexions. It pleased him that the gentleman in the box should\r\nrecognise and notice him, because even so small a fact as this was\r\nan extension of his social existence; but it no less surprised and\r\npuzzled him, producing altogether, in his easily-excited organism, an\r\nagitation of which, in spite of his attempted self-control, the air\r\nhe had for Millicent was the sign. They had met three times, he and\r\nhis fellow-spectator; but they had met in quarters that, to Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind, would have made a furtive wink, a mere tremor of the eyelid,\r\na more judicious reference to the fact than so public a salutation.\r\nOur friend would never have permitted himself to greet him first, and\r\nthis was not because the gentleman in the box belonged\xe2\x80\x94conspicuously\r\nas he did so\xe2\x80\x94to a different walk of society. He was apparently a\r\nman of forty, tall, lean and loose-jointed; he fell into lounging,\r\ndawdling attitudes and even at a distance looked lazy. He had a long,\r\namused, contented face, unadorned with moustache or whisker, and his\r\nbrown hair, parted at the side, came forward on either temple in a\r\nrich, well-brushed lock, after the fashion of the portraits of 1820.\r\nMillicent had a glance of such range and keenness that she was able to\r\nmake out the details of his evening-dress, of which she appreciated the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cform\xe2\x80\x9d; to observe the character of his large hands; and to note that\r\nhe continually smiled at something, that his eyes were extraordinarily\r\nlight in colour and that in spite of the dark, well-marked brows\r\narching over them his fine skin never had produced and never would\r\nproduce a beard of any strength. Our young lady pronounced him mentally\r\na \xe2\x80\x9cswell\xe2\x80\x9d of the first magnitude and wondered more than ever where he\r\nhad picked up Hyacinth. Her companion seemed to echo her thought when\r\nhe exclaimed with a little surprised sigh, almost an exhalation of awe:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I had no idea he was one of that lot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might at least tell me his name, so that I shall know what to call\r\nhim when he comes round to speak to us,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said, provoked at her\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComes round to speak to us\xe2\x80\x94a chap like that!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth echoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure if he had been your own brother he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ngrinned at you more! He may want to make my acquaintance after all; he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman had once more retreated from sight, and there was that\r\namount of evidence of the intention she imputed to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m at all clear that I\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to tell his name.\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth spoke\r\nresponsibly, yet with all disposition to magnify an incident which\r\ndeepened the brilliancy of the entertainment he had been able to offer\r\nMiss Henning. \xe2\x80\x9cI met him in a place where he may not like to have it\r\nknown he goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you go to places that people are ashamed of? Is it one of your\r\npolitical clubs, as you call them, where that dirty young man from\r\nCamberwell, Mr. Monument (what do you call him?), fills your head with\r\nideas that\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you to no good? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure your friend over there\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t look as if he\xe2\x80\x99d be on your side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth had indulged in this reflexion himself; but the only answer he\r\nmade to Millicent was: \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99ll be on yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, I hope _she_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t one of the aristocracy!\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent exclaimed\r\nwith apparent irrelevance; and following the direction of her eyes\r\nHyacinth saw that the chair his mysterious acquaintance had quitted in\r\nthe stage-box was now occupied by a lady hitherto invisible\xe2\x80\x94not the one\r\nwho had given them a glimpse of her shoulder and bare arm. This was an\r\nancient personage muffled in a voluminous and crumpled white shawl\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nstout, odd, foreign-looking woman with a fair, nodding, wiggy head. She\r\nhad a placid, patient air and a round wrinkled face in which, however,\r\na pair of small bright eyes moved quickly enough. Her rather soiled\r\nwhite gloves were too large for her, and round her head, horizontally\r\narranged as if to keep her wig in its place, she wore a narrow band\r\nof tinsel decorated in the middle of the forehead by a jewel which\r\nthe rest of her appearance would lead the spectator to suppose false.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the old woman his mother? Where did she dig up her clothes? They\r\nlook as if she had hired them for the evening. Does _she_ come to your\r\nwonderful club too? I daresay she cuts it fine, don\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent\r\nwent on; and when Hyacinth suggested sportively that the old lady\r\nmight be not the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s mother but his wife or his fancy of the\r\nmoment she declared that in that case, were he to come to see them, she\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fear for herself. No wonder he wanted to get out of _that_\r\nbox! The party in the wig\xe2\x80\x94and what a wig!\xe2\x80\x94was sitting there on purpose\r\nto look at them, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say she was particularly honoured by\r\nthe notice of such an old guy. Hyacinth pretended he quite liked her\r\nappearance and admired in her a charm of her own; he offered to bet\r\nanother paper of peppermints that if they could find out she would be\r\nsome tremendous old dowager, some one with a handle to her name. To\r\nthis Millicent replied with an air of experience that she had never\r\nthought the greatest beauty was in the upper class; and her companion\r\ncould see she was covertly looking over her shoulder to watch for his\r\nstrange clubmate and that she would be disappointed if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come.\r\nThis idea didn\xe2\x80\x99t make Hyacinth jealous, for his mind was occupied with\r\nanother side of the business; and if he offered sportive suggestions\r\nit was because he was really excited, was dazzled, by an incident\r\nof which the reader will have failed as yet to perceive the larger\r\nrelations. What moved him was not the pleasure of being patronised by\r\na rich man; it was simply the prospect of new experience\xe2\x80\x94a sensation\r\nfor which he was always ready to exchange any present boon; and he was\r\nconvinced that if the gentleman with whom he had conversed in a small\r\noccult back room in Bloomsbury as Captain Godfrey Sholto\xe2\x80\x94the Captain\r\nhad given him his card\xe2\x80\x94had in more positive fashion than by Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupposing it come out of the stage-box to see him, he would bring with\r\nhim rare influences. His view of this possibility made suspense akin to\r\npreparation; therefore when at the end of a few minutes he became aware\r\nthat his young woman, with her head turned, was taking the measure\r\nof some one who had come in behind them, he felt fate to be doing for\r\nhim by way of a change as much as could be expected. He got up in his\r\nplace, but not too soon to see that Captain Sholto had been standing\r\nthere a moment in contemplation of Millicent and that she on her side\r\nhad performed with deliberation the ceremony of appraising him. The\r\nCaptain had his hands in his pockets and wore his crush-hat pushed a\r\ngood deal back. He laughed to the young couple in the balcony in the\r\nfriendliest way, as if he had known them both for years, and Millicent\r\ncould see on a nearer view that he was a fine distinguished easy genial\r\ngentleman, at least six feet high in spite of a habit or an affectation\r\nof carrying himself in a casual relaxed familiar manner. Hyacinth felt\r\na little, after the first, as if he were treating them rather too much\r\nas a pair of children on whom he had stolen to startle them; but this\r\nimpression was speedily removed by the air with which he said, laying\r\nhis hand on our hero\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder as he stood in the little passage at\r\nthe end of the bench where the holders of Mr. Vetch\xe2\x80\x99s order occupied\r\nthe first seats: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, I really thought I must come round\r\nand speak to you. My spirits are all gone with this brute of a play.\r\nAnd those boxes are fearfully stuffy, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\xe2\x80\x94quite as\r\nif Hyacinth had had at least an equal experience of that part of the\r\ntheatre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hot enough here too,\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s companion returned. He had\r\nsuddenly become much more conscious of the high temperature, of his\r\nproximity to the fierce chandelier, and he mentioned that the plot of\r\nthe play certainly was unnatural, though he thought the piece rather\r\nwell acted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s the good old stodgy British tradition. This is the only place\r\nwhere you find it still, and even here it can\xe2\x80\x99t last much longer; it\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t survive old Baskerville and Mrs. Ruffler. \xe2\x80\x99Gad, how old they are!\r\nI remember her, long past her prime, when I used to be taken to the\r\nplay, as a boy, in the Christmas holidays. Between them they must be\r\nsomething like a hundred and eighty, eh? I believe one\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to\r\ncry a good deal about the middle,\xe2\x80\x9d Captain Sholto continued in the same\r\nfriendly familiar encouraging way, addressing himself to Millicent,\r\nupon whom indeed his eyes had rested almost uninterruptedly from the\r\nstart. She sustained his glance with composure, but with just enough\r\nof emphasised reserve to intimate (what was perfectly true) that she\r\nwas not in the habit of conversing with gentlemen with whom she was\r\nunacquainted. She turned away her face at this (she had already given\r\nthe visitor the benefit of a good deal of it) and left him, as in the\r\nlittle passage he leaned against the parapet of the balcony with his\r\nback to the stage, facing toward Hyacinth, who was now wondering, with\r\nrather more vivid a sense of the relations of things, what he had come\r\nfor. He wanted to do him honour in return for his civility, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what one could talk of at such short notice to a person whom\r\nhe immediately perceived to be, and the more finely that it was all\r\nunaggressively, a man of the world. He instantly saw Captain Sholto\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t take the play seriously, so that he felt himself warned off\r\nthat topic, on which otherwise he might have had much to say. On the\r\nother hand he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t in the presence of a third person allude to the\r\nmatters they had discussed at the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon\xe2\x80\x9d; nor might he suppose\r\nhis visitor would expect this, though indeed he impressed him as a\r\nman of humours and whims, disposed to amuse himself with everything,\r\nincluding esoteric socialism and a little bookbinder who had so much\r\nmore of the gentleman about him than one would expect. Captain Sholto\r\nmay have been slightly embarrassed, now that he was completely launched\r\nin his attempt at fraternisation, especially after failing to elicit\r\na smile from Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s rare respectability; but he left to Hyacinth\r\nthe burden of no initiative and went on to say that it was just this\r\nprospect of the dying-out of the old British tradition that had brought\r\nhim to-night. He was with a friend, a lady who had lived much abroad,\r\nwho had never seen anything of the kind and who liked everything that\r\nwas characteristic. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the foreign school of acting\xe2\x80\x99s a very\r\ndifferent affair,\xe2\x80\x9d he said again to Millicent, who this time replied\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d and, considering afresh the old woman in the box,\r\nreflected that she looked as if there were nothing in the world that\r\nshe at least hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve never been abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth candidly said while he looked into\r\nhis friend\xe2\x80\x99s curious light-coloured eyes, the palest in tint he had\r\never encountered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of nonsense talked about that!\xe2\x80\x9d Captain Sholto\r\nreplied; on which Hyacinth remained uncertain of his reference and\r\nMillicent decided to volunteer a remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re making a tremendous row on the stage. I should think it would\r\nbe very bad in those boxes.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a banging and thumping behind\r\nthe curtain, the sound of heavy scenery pushed about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s much better here every way. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve the best seats\r\nin the house,\xe2\x80\x9d said their visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like very much to finish\r\nmy evening beside you. The trouble is I\xe2\x80\x99ve ladies\xe2\x80\x94a pair of them,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe pursued as if he were seriously considering this possibility. Then\r\nlaying his hand again on Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder he smiled at him a moment\r\nand indulged in a still greater burst of frankness. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s just what, as a partial reason, has brought me up here to see\r\nyou. One of my ladies has a great desire to make your acquaintance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make my acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth felt himself turn pale; the\r\nfirst impulse he could have in connexion with such an announcement\r\nas that\xe2\x80\x94and it lay far down in the depths of the unspeakable\xe2\x80\x94was\r\na conjecture that it had something to do with his parentage on his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s side. Captain Sholto\xe2\x80\x99s smooth bright face, irradiating such\r\nunexpected advances, seemed for an instant to swim before him. The\r\nCaptain went on to say that he had told the lady of the talks they had\r\nhad, that she was immensely interested in such matters\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what\r\nI mean, she really is\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and that as a consequence of what he had said\r\nshe had begged him to come and ask\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94his young friend (Hyacinth saw in\r\na moment that the Captain had forgotten his name) to look in at her if\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has a tremendous desire to meet some one who looks at the whole\r\nbusiness from your standpoint, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? And in her position she\r\nscarcely ever has a chance, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come across them\xe2\x80\x94to her great\r\nannoyance. So when I spotted you to-night she immediately declared\r\nI must introduce you at any cost. I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind just for a\r\nquarter of an hour. I ought perhaps to tell you that she\xe2\x80\x99s a person\r\nused to having nothing refused her. \xe2\x80\x98Go up and bring him down,\xe2\x80\x99 you\r\nknow, as if it were the simplest thing in the world. She\xe2\x80\x99s really\r\nvery much in earnest: I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean about wishing to see you\xe2\x80\x94that goes\r\nwithout saying\xe2\x80\x94but about our whole job, yours and mine. Then I should\r\nadd\xe2\x80\x94it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spoil anything\xe2\x80\x94that she\xe2\x80\x99s the most charming woman in the\r\nworld, simply! Honestly, my dear boy, she\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps the most remarkable\r\nwoman in Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Captain Sholto delivered himself, with the highest naturalness\r\nand plausibility, and Hyacinth, listening, felt that he himself ought\r\nperhaps to resent the idea of being served up for the entertainment\r\nof capricious not to say presumptuous triflers, but that somehow he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t, and that it was more worthy of the part he aspired to play\r\nin life to meet such occasions calmly and urbanely than to take\r\nthe trouble of avoidance. Of course the lady in the box couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nsincere; she might think she was, though even that was questionable;\r\nbut you didn\xe2\x80\x99t really care for the cause exemplified in the guarded\r\nback room in Bloomsbury when you came to the theatre in that style. It\r\nwas Captain Sholto\xe2\x80\x99s style as well, but it had been by no means clear\r\nto Hyacinth hitherto that _he_ really cared. All the same this was no\r\ntime for going into the question of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s sincerity, and at the\r\nend of sixty seconds our young man had made up his mind that he could\r\nafford to indulge her. None the less, I must add, the whole proposal\r\ncontinued to make things dance, to appear fictive and phantasmagoric;\r\nso that it sounded in comparison like a note of reality when Millicent,\r\nwho had been turning from one of the men to the other, exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very well, but who\xe2\x80\x99s to look after _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d Her assumption of\r\nthe majestic had broken down and this was the cry of nature.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been pleasanter and more charitable to her alarm\r\nthan the manner in which Captain Sholto reassured her. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young\r\nlady, can you suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ve been unmindful of that? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hoping\r\nthat after I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken down our friend and introduced him you might\r\nallow me to come back and in his absence occupy his seat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth was preoccupied with the idea of meeting the most remarkable\r\nwoman in Europe; but at this juncture he looked at Millicent Henning\r\nwith some curiosity. She rose grandly to the occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m much\r\nobliged to you, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about that!\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain benevolently cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I should introduce you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth, and he mentioned to\r\nMiss Henning the name of his distinguished acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the army?\xe2\x80\x9d the young lady inquired as if she must have every\r\nguarantee of social position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94not in the navy! I\xe2\x80\x99ve left the army, but it always sticks to one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Robinson, is it your intention to leave me?\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent asked in a\r\ntone of the highest propriety.\r\n\r\nHyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s imagination had taken such a flight that the idea of what\r\nhe owed to the beautiful girl who had placed herself under his care\r\nfor the evening had somehow effaced itself. Her words put it before him\r\nin a manner that threw him quickly and consciously back on his honour;\r\nyet there was something in the way she uttered them that made him look\r\nat her harder still before he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, no\xe2\x80\x94of course it would\r\nnever do. I must put off to some other opportunity the honour of making\r\nthe acquaintance of your friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he added to their visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear fellow, we might manage it so easily now,\xe2\x80\x9d this\r\ngentleman murmured with evident disappointment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not as if\r\nMiss\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94Miss\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94were to be alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt flashed upon Hyacinth that the root of the project might be a desire\r\nof Captain Sholto to insinuate himself into Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s good graces;\r\nthen he wondered why the most remarkable woman in Europe should lend\r\nherself to that design, consenting even to receive a visit from a\r\nlittle bookbinder for the sake of furthering it. Perhaps after all she\r\nwas not the most remarkable; still, even at a lower estimate, of what\r\nadvantage could such a complication be to her? To Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s surprise\r\nMillicent\xe2\x80\x99s face made acknowledgment of his implied renunciation; and\r\nshe said to Captain Sholto as if she were considering the matter very\r\nimpartially: \xe2\x80\x9cMight one know the name of the lady who sent you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Princess Casamassima.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Millicent Henning. And then quickly, as if to cover up\r\nthis crudity: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd might one also know what it is, as you say, that she\r\nwants to talk to him about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the lower orders, the rising democracy, the spread of ideas and\r\nall that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lower orders? Does she think we belong to them?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl demanded\r\nwith a strange provoking laugh.\r\n\r\nCaptain Sholto was certainly the readiest of men. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she could see you\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d think you one of the first ladies in the land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll never see me!\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent replied in a manner which made it\r\nplain that she at least was not to be whistled for.\r\n\r\nBeing whistled for by a princess presented itself to Hyacinth as an\r\nindignity endured gracefully enough by the heroes of several French\r\nnovels in which he had found a thrilling interest; nevertheless he said\r\nincorruptibly to the Captain, who hovered there like a Mephistopheles\r\nconverted to inscrutable good: \xe2\x80\x9cHaving been in the army you\xe2\x80\x99ll know\r\nthat one can\xe2\x80\x99t desert one\xe2\x80\x99s post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, for the third time, laid his hand on his young friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder, and for a minute his smile rested in silence on Millicent\r\nHenning. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I tell you simply I want to talk with this young lady,\r\nthat certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t help me particularly, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why\r\nit should. Therefore I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the whole truth: I want to talk\r\nwith her about _you_!\xe2\x80\x9d And he patted Hyacinth in a way which conveyed\r\nat once that this idea must surely commend him to the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompanion and that he himself liked him infinitely.\r\n\r\nHyacinth was conscious of the endearment, but he put before Millicent\r\nthat he would do just as she liked; he was determined not to let a\r\nmember of a justly-doomed patriciate suppose he held any daughter of\r\nthe people cheap. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Henning. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhad better hurry\xe2\x80\x94the curtain\xe2\x80\x99s going to rise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s charming of you! I\xe2\x80\x99ll rejoin you in three minutes!\xe2\x80\x9d Captain\r\nSholto exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe passed his hand into Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and as our hero lingered still,\r\na little uneasy and questioning Millicent always with his eyes, the\r\ngirl spoke with her bright boldness: \xe2\x80\x9cThat kind of princess\xe2\x80\x94I should\r\nlike to hear all about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that too,\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain returned with his perfect\r\nease as he led his young friend away. It must be confessed that\r\nHyacinth also rather wondered what kind of princess she was, and his\r\nsuspense on this point made his heart beat fast when, after traversing\r\nsteep staircases and winding corridors, they reached the small door of\r\nthe stage-box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHis first consciousness after his companion had opened it was of his\r\nproximity to the stage, on which the curtain had now again risen. The\r\nplay was in progress, the actors\xe2\x80\x99 voices came straight into the box,\r\nand it was impossible to speak without disturbing them. This at least\r\nwas his inference from the noiseless way his conductor drew him in and,\r\nwithout announcing or introducing him, simply pointed to a chair and\r\nwhispered: \xe2\x80\x9cJust drop into that; you\xe2\x80\x99ll see and hear beautifully.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nheard the door close behind him and became aware that Captain Sholto\r\nhad already retreated. Millicent would at any rate not be left long\r\nto languish in solitude. Two ladies were seated in the front of the\r\nbox, which was so large that there was a considerable space between\r\nthem; and as he stood there, where Captain Sholto had planted him\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nappeared not to have noticed the opening of the door\xe2\x80\x94they turned their\r\nheads and looked at him. The one on whom his eyes first rested was the\r\nodd party he had already viewed at a distance; she looked queerer still\r\non a closer view and gave him a little friendly gratified nod. The\r\nother was partly overshadowed by the curtain of the box, drawn forward\r\nwith the intention of shielding her from the observation of the house;\r\nshe had still the air of youth, and the simplest way to express the\r\ninstant effect upon Hyacinth of her fair face of welcome is to say that\r\nshe dazzled him. He remained as Sholto had left him, staring rather\r\nconfusedly and not moving an inch; whereupon the younger lady put out\r\nher hand\xe2\x80\x94it was her left, the other rested on the ledge of the box\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nthe expectation, as he perceived, to his extreme mortification, too\r\nlate, that he would give her his own. She converted the gesture into\r\na sign of invitation and beckoned him silently but graciously to move\r\nhis chair forward. He did so and seated himself between the two; then\r\nfor ten minutes he stared straight before him at the stage, not turning\r\nhis eyes sufficiently even to glance up at Millicent in the balcony.\r\nHe looked at the play, but was far from seeing it; he had no sense\r\nof anything but the woman who sat there, close to him, on his right,\r\nwith a fragrance in her garments and a light about her which he seemed\r\nto see even while his head was averted. The vision had been only of\r\na moment, but it hung before him, threw a vague white mist over the\r\nproceedings on the stage. He was consciously embarrassed, overturned\r\nand bewildered; he made a great effort to collect himself, to consider\r\nthe situation lucidly. He wondered if he ought to speak, to look at\r\nher again, to behave differently in some way; if she would take him\r\nfor a clown, for an idiot; if she were really as beautiful as she had\r\nseemed or it were only a superficial glamour which a renewed inspection\r\nwould dissipate. While he so pondered the minutes lapsed and neither\r\nof his hostesses spoke; they watched the play in perfect stillness, so\r\nthat he divined this to be the proper thing and that he himself must\r\nremain dumb until a word should be addressed him. Little by little\r\nhe recovered himself, took possession of his predicament and at last\r\ntransferred his eyes to the Princess. She immediately perceived this\r\nand returned his glance with a bright benevolence. She might well be a\r\nprincess\xe2\x80\x94it was impossible to conform more to the finest evocations of\r\nthat romantic word. She was fair, shining, slender, with an effortless\r\nmajesty. Her beauty had an air of perfection; it astonished and\r\nlifted one up, the sight of it seemed a privilege, a reward. If the\r\nfirst impression it had given Hyacinth was to make him feel strangely\r\ntransported he need still not have set that down to his simplicity,\r\nfor this was the effect the Princess Casamassima produced on persons\r\nof a wider experience and greater pretensions. Her dark eyes, blue or\r\ngrey, something that was not brown, were as kind as they were splendid,\r\nand there was an extraordinary light nobleness in the way she held her\r\nhead. That head, where two or three diamond stars glittered in the\r\nthick, delicate hair which defined its shape, suggested to Hyacinth\r\nsomething antique and celebrated, something he had admired of old\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmemory was vague\xe2\x80\x94in a statue, in a picture, in a museum. Purity of line\r\nand form, of cheek and chin and lip and brow, a colour that seemed\r\nto live and glow, a radiance of grace and eminence and success\xe2\x80\x94these\r\nthings were seated in triumph in the face of the Princess, and her\r\nvisitor, as he held himself in his chair trembling with the revelation,\r\nquestioned if she were really of the same substance with the humanity\r\nhe had hitherto known. She might be divine, but he could see she\r\nunderstood human needs\xe2\x80\x94that she wished him to be at his ease and happy;\r\nthere was something familiar in her benignity, as if she had seen\r\nhim many times before. Her dress was dark and rich; she had pearls\r\nround her neck and an old rococo fan in her hand. He took in all these\r\nthings and finally said to himself that if she wanted nothing more of\r\nhim he was content, he would like it to go on; so pleasant was it to\r\nbe enthroned with fine ladies in a dusky, spacious receptacle which\r\nframed the bright picture of the stage and made one\xe2\x80\x99s own situation\r\nseem a play within the play. The act was a long one, and the repose in\r\nwhich his companions left him might have been a calculated charity,\r\nto enable him to get used to them, to see how harmless they were. He\r\nlooked at Millicent in the course of time and saw that Captain Sholto,\r\nseated beside her, had not the same standard of propriety, inasmuch as\r\nhe made a remark to her every few minutes. Like himself the young lady\r\nin the balcony was losing the play, thanks to her so keeping her eyes\r\non her friend from Lomax Place, whose position she thus endeavoured\r\nto gauge. He had quite given up the Paraguayan complications; by the\r\nend of the half-hour his attention might have come back to them had\r\nhe not then been engaged in wondering what the Princess would say to\r\nhim after the descent of the curtain\xe2\x80\x94or if she would say anything. The\r\nconsideration of this problem as the moment of the solution drew nearer\r\nmade his heart again beat fast. He watched the old lady on his left\r\nand supposed it was natural a princess should have an attendant\xe2\x80\x94he took\r\nfor granted she was an attendant\xe2\x80\x94as different as possible from herself.\r\nThis ancient dame was without majesty or grace; huddled together with\r\nher hands folded on her stomach and her lips protruding, she solemnly\r\nfollowed the performance. Several times, however, she turned her head\r\nto Hyacinth, and then her expression changed; she repeated the jovial,\r\nencouraging, almost motherly nod with which she had greeted him on\r\nhis making his bow and by which she appeared to wish to intimate that,\r\nbetter than the serene beauty on the other side, she could enter into\r\nthe full anomaly of his situation. She seemed to argue that he must\r\nkeep his head and that if the worst should come to the worst she was\r\nthere to look after him. Even when at last the curtain descended it\r\nwas some moments before the Princess spoke, though she rested her\r\nsmile on her guest as if she were considering what he would best like\r\nher to say. He might at that instant have guessed what he discovered\r\nlater\xe2\x80\x94that among this lady\xe2\x80\x99s faults (he was destined to learn they\r\nwere numerous) not the least eminent was an exaggerated fear of the\r\ncommonplace. He expected she would make some remark about the play, but\r\nwhat she said was, very gently and kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cI like to know all sorts of\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d find the least difficulty in that,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if one wants anything very much it\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be difficult. Every\r\none isn\xe2\x80\x99t so obliging as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth could think immediately of no proper answer to this, but the\r\nold lady saved him the trouble by declaring with a foreign accent: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink you were most extraordinarily good-natured. I had no idea you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncome\xe2\x80\x94to two strange women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99re strange women,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Princess musingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not true she finds things difficult; she makes every one do\r\neverything,\xe2\x80\x9d her companion went on.\r\n\r\nThe Princess glanced at her and then remarked to Hyacinth: \xe2\x80\x9cHer name\r\nis Madame Grandoni.\xe2\x80\x9d The tone was not familiar, but there was a happy\r\nshade in it, as if he had really taken so much trouble for them that\r\nit was but just he should be entertained a little at their expense. It\r\nseemed to imply also that Madame Grandoni\xe2\x80\x99s fitness for supplying such\r\nentertainment was obvious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not Italian\xe2\x80\x94ah no!\xe2\x80\x9d the old lady cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of my\r\nname I\xe2\x80\x99m an honest, ugly, unfortunate German. But _cela n\xe2\x80\x99a pas\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99importance_. She also, with such a name, isn\xe2\x80\x99t Italian either. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan accident; the world\xe2\x80\x99s full of accidents. But she isn\xe2\x80\x99t German,\r\npoor lady, any more.\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni appeared to have entered into\r\nthe Princess\xe2\x80\x99s view, and Hyacinth thought her exceedingly droll. In a\r\nmoment she added: \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a very charming person you were with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s very charming,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth replied, not sorry to have a\r\nchance to say it.\r\n\r\nThe Princess made no remark on this subject, and Hyacinth saw not only\r\nthat from her position in the box she could have had no glimpse of\r\nMillicent, but that she would never take up such an allusion as that.\r\nIt was as if she had not heard it that she asked: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you find the play\r\nvery interesting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, then told the simple truth. \xe2\x80\x9cI must confess I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost the\r\nwhole of this last act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor bothered young man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Grandoni. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see\xe2\x80\x94you see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I see?\xe2\x80\x9d the Princess inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re annoyed at being\r\nhere now you\xe2\x80\x99ll like us later; probably at least. We take a great\r\ninterest in the things you care for. We take a great interest in the\r\npeople,\xe2\x80\x9d the Princess went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, allow me, allow me, and speak only for yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d the elder\r\nlady interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cI take no interest whatever in the people; I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand them and I know nothing about them. An honourable nature, of\r\nany class, I always respect; but I won\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to a passion for the\r\nignorant masses, because I have it not. Moreover that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t touch the\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Princess Casamassima had a clear faculty of completely ignoring\r\nthings of which she wished to take no account; it was not in the least\r\nthe air of contempt, but thoughtful, tranquil, convenient absence,\r\nafter which she came back to the point where she wished to be. She made\r\nno protest against her companion\xe2\x80\x99s speech, but said to Hyacinth, as if\r\nvaguely conscious she had been committing herself in some absurd way:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lives with me; she\xe2\x80\x99s everything to me; she\xe2\x80\x99s the best woman in the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, fortunately, with many superficial defects I\xe2\x80\x99m as good as good\r\nbread,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni conceded.\r\n\r\nHyacinth was by this time less embarrassed than when he had presented\r\nhimself, but he was not less mystified; he wondered afresh if he were\r\nnot being practised on for some inconceivable end: so strangely did\r\nit strike him that two such products of another world than his own\r\nshould of their own movement take the trouble to explain each other\r\nto a dire little bookbinder. This idea made him flush; it might have\r\ncome over him that he had fallen into a trap. He was conscious he\r\nlooked frightened, and he was conscious the moment afterwards that the\r\nPrincess noticed it. This was apparently what made her say: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nlost so much of the play I ought to tell you what has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he would follow that any more?\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would tell me\xe2\x80\x94if you would tell me\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d And then Hyacinth\r\nstopped. He had been going to say \xe2\x80\x9cIf you would tell me what all this\r\nmeans and what you want of me it would be more to the point!\xe2\x80\x9d but the\r\nwords died on his lips and he sat staring, for the woman at his right\r\nhand was simply too beautiful. She was too beautiful to question,\r\nto judge by common logic; and how could he know, moreover, what was\r\nnatural to a person in that exaltation of grace and splendour? Perhaps\r\nit was her habit to send out every evening for some witless stranger\r\nto amuse her; perhaps that was the way the foreign aristocracy lived.\r\nThere was no sharpness in her face\xe2\x80\x94for the present hour at least: there\r\nwas nothing but luminous charity, yet she looked as if she knew what\r\nwas going on in his mind. She made no eager attempt to reassure him,\r\nbut there was a world almost of direct tenderness in the tone in which\r\nshe said: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve already forgotten what they have\r\nbeen doing\xe2\x80\x94? It\xe2\x80\x99s terribly complicated; some one or other was hurled\r\nover a precipice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99re a brilliant pair,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni declared with a laugh\r\nof long experience. \xe2\x80\x9cI could describe everything. The person who was\r\nhurled over the precipice was the virtuous hero, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see him in\r\nthe next act all the better for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t describe anything; I\xe2\x80\x99ve so much to ask.\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth had looked\r\naway in tacit deprecation at hearing himself \xe2\x80\x9cpaired\xe2\x80\x9d with the\r\nPrincess, and he felt she was watching him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of\r\nCaptain Sholto?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on suddenly, to his surprise, if anything in\r\nhis position could excite surprise more than anything else; and as he\r\nhesitated, not knowing what to say, she added: \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he a very curious\r\ntype?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know him very little.\xe2\x80\x9d But he had no sooner uttered the words than\r\nit struck him they were far from brilliant, were poor and flat and very\r\nlittle calculated to satisfy the Princess. Indeed he had said nothing\r\nat all that could place him in a favourable light; so he continued at a\r\nventure: \xe2\x80\x9cI mean I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen him at home.\xe2\x80\x9d That sounded still more\r\nsilly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt home? Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s never at home; he\xe2\x80\x99s all over the world. To-night\r\nhe was as likely to have been in Paraguay for instance\xe2\x80\x94though what a\r\nplace to be!\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cas here. He is what they call a cosmopolite.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you know that species; very modern, more and more\r\nfrequent and exceedingly tiresome. I prefer the Chinese. He had told me\r\nhe had had a lot of very interesting talk with you. That was what made\r\nme say: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, do ask him to come in and see me. A little interesting\r\ntalk, that would be a change!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s very complimentary to me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Grandoni.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh my dear, you and I, you know, we never talk: we understand each\r\nother without that!\xe2\x80\x9d Then the Princess pursued, addressing herself to\r\nHyacinth: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you never admit women?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmit women\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInto those s\xc3\xa9ances\xe2\x80\x94what do you call them?\xe2\x80\x94those little meetings that\r\nCaptain Sholto describes to me. I should like so much to be present.\r\nWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nrule, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen nothing but men\xe2\x80\x9d; and he subjoined, smiling, though\r\nhe thought the dereliction rather serious and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the\r\npart Captain Sholto was playing, nor, considering the grand company\r\nhe kept, how he had originally secured admittance into the subversive\r\nlittle circle in Bloomsbury: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure he ought to go\r\nabout reporting our proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. Perhaps you think he\xe2\x80\x99s a spy, an _agent provocateur_ or\r\nsomething of that sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth after a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI think a spy would be more\r\ncareful\xe2\x80\x94would disguise himself more. Besides, after all, he has heard\r\nvery little.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke as with mild amusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really been behind the scenes?\xe2\x80\x9d the Princess asked,\r\nbending forward a little and now covering the young man steadily with\r\nher beautiful deep eyes, as if by this time he must have got used to\r\nher and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t flinch from such attention. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said of herself, however, \xe2\x80\x9cand he never will be. He knows that,\r\nand that it\xe2\x80\x99s quite out of his power to tell any real secrets. What\r\nhe repeated to me was interesting, but of course I could see there was\r\nnothing the authorities anywhere could put their hand on. It was mainly\r\nthe talk he had had with you which struck him so very much, and which\r\nstruck me, as I tell you. Perhaps you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how he was drawing\r\nyou out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that\xe2\x80\x99s rather easy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth with perfect candour;\r\nfor it came over him that he _had_ chattered with a vengeance in\r\nBloomsbury and had thought it natural enough there that his sociable\r\nfellow-visitor should offer him cigars and attach importance to the\r\nviews of a clever and original young artisan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that I find it so! However, I ought to tell you that you\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t have the least fear of Captain Sholto. He\xe2\x80\x99s a perfectly honest\r\nman, so far as he goes; and even if you had trusted him much more than\r\nyou appear to have done he\xe2\x80\x99d be incapable of betraying you. However,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t trust him: not because he\xe2\x80\x99s not safe, but because\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d She took\r\nherself up. \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see for yourself. He has gone into that\r\nsort of thing simply to please me. I should tell you, merely to make\r\nyou understand, that he would do anything for that. That\xe2\x80\x99s his own\r\naffair. I wanted to know something, to learn something, to ascertain\r\nwhat really is going on; and for a woman everything of that sort\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\ndifficult, especially for a woman in my position, who\xe2\x80\x99s tiresomely\r\nknown and to whom every sort of bad faith is sure to be imputed. So\r\nSholto said he would look into the subject for me. Poor man, he has\r\nhad to look into so many subjects! What I particularly wanted was\r\nthat he should make friends with some of the leading spirits, really\r\ncharacteristic types.\xe2\x80\x9d The Princess\xe2\x80\x99s voice was low and rather deep,\r\nbut her tone perfectly natural and easy, with a charming assumption\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nyou could call it nothing else\xe2\x80\x94of more wonderful things than he\r\ncould count. Her manner of speaking was in fact altogether new to\r\nher listener, for whom the pronunciation of her words and the very\r\npunctuation of her sentences were the revelation of what he supposed\r\nto be society\xe2\x80\x94the very Society to the destruction of which he was\r\ndedicated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely Captain Sholto doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ a leading spirit!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed with the resolve not to be laughed at any more than he could\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me you were very original.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know, and\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me to say so\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t think _you_\r\nknow. How should you? I\xe2\x80\x99m one of many thousands of young men of my\r\nclass\xe2\x80\x94you know, I suppose, what _that_ is\xe2\x80\x94in whose brains certain ideas\r\nare fermenting. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing original about me at all. I\xe2\x80\x99m very\r\nyoung and very ignorant; it\xe2\x80\x99s only a few months since I began to talk\r\nof the possibility of a social revolution with men who have considered\r\nthe whole ground much more than I could possibly do. I\xe2\x80\x99m a mere\r\nparticle,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cin the grey immensity of the people. All\r\nI pretend to is my good faith and a great desire that justice shall be\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Princess listened to him intently and her attitude made him feel\r\nhow little _he_, in comparison, expressed himself like a person who had\r\nthe habit of conversation; he seemed to himself to betray ridiculous\r\neffort, to stammer and emit vulgar sounds. For a moment she said\r\nnothing, only looking at him with her exquisite smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI do draw you\r\nout!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed at last. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re much more interesting to me than\r\nif you were an exception.\xe2\x80\x9d At these last words Hyacinth flinched a\r\nhair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth; the movement was shown by his dropping his eyes. We\r\nknow to what extent he really regarded himself as of the stuff of the\r\ncommon herd. The Princess doubtless guessed it as well, for she quickly\r\nadded: \xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time I can see you\xe2\x80\x99re remarkable enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m remarkable for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ve general ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one has them to-day. They have them in Bloomsbury to a terrible\r\ndegree. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a friend (who understands the matter much better than\r\nI) who has no patience with them: he declares they\xe2\x80\x99re our folly, our\r\ndanger and our bane. A few very special ideas\xe2\x80\x94if they\xe2\x80\x99re the right\r\nones\xe2\x80\x94are what we want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s your friend?\xe2\x80\x9d the Princess asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Christina, Christina!\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni murmured from the other\r\nside of the box.\r\n\r\nChristina took no notice of her, and Hyacinth, not understanding the\r\nwarning and only remembering how personal women always are, replied:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young man who lives in Camberwell and who\xe2\x80\x99s in the employ of a big\r\nwholesale chemist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf he had designed in this description of his friend a stronger dose\r\nthan his hostess would be able to digest he was greatly mistaken.\r\nShe seemed to gaze tenderly at the picture suggested by his words,\r\nand she immediately inquired if the young man were also clever and\r\nif she mightn\xe2\x80\x99t hope to know him. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t Captain Sholto seen him, and\r\nif so why hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he spoken of him too? When Hyacinth had replied that\r\nCaptain Sholto had probably seen him, but, as he believed, had had no\r\nparticular conversation with him, the Princess asked with startling\r\nfrankness if her visitor wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring the person so vividly described\r\nsome day to see her.\r\n\r\nHyacinth glanced at Madame Grandoni, but that worthy woman was engaged\r\nin a survey of the house through an old-fashioned eyeglass with a\r\nlong gilt handle. He had perceived much before this that the Princess\r\nCasamassima had no desire for vain phrases, and he had the good taste\r\nto feel that from himself to such a great lady compliments, even had\r\nhe wished to pay them, would have had no suitability. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhether he would be willing to come. He\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of man that in such\r\na case you can\xe2\x80\x99t answer for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes me want to know him all the more. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll come yourself\r\nat all events, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Hyacinth murmured something about the unexpected honour; after all\r\nhe had a French heredity and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so easy for him to say things\r\nas ill as his other idiom mainly required. But Madame Grandoni, laying\r\ndown her eyeglass, almost took the words out of his mouth with the\r\ncheerful exhortation: \xe2\x80\x9cGo and see her\xe2\x80\x94go and see her once or twice.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99ll treat you like an angel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must think me very peculiar,\xe2\x80\x9d the Princess remarked sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I think. It will take a good while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could make you trust me\xe2\x80\x94inspire you with confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean only you personally, but others who think as\r\nyou do. You\xe2\x80\x99d find I\xe2\x80\x99d go with you\xe2\x80\x94pretty far. I was answering just\r\nnow for Captain Sholto; but who in the world\xe2\x80\x99s to answer for _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd her sadness merged itself in a smile that affected Hyacinth as\r\nindescribably magnanimous and touching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I, my dear, I promise you!\xe2\x80\x9d her ancient companion ejaculated with\r\na laugh which made the people in the stalls look up at the box.\r\n\r\nHer spirit was contagious; it gave Hyacinth the audacity to say to\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d trust _you_, if you did!\xe2\x80\x9d though he felt the next minute that\r\nthis was even a more familiar speech than if he had expressed a want of\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt comes then to the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Princess. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshow herself with me in public if I weren\xe2\x80\x99t respectable. If you knew\r\nmore about me you\xe2\x80\x99d understand what has led me to turn my attention to\r\nthe great social question. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long story and the details wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ninterest you; but perhaps some day, if we have more talk, you\xe2\x80\x99ll put\r\nyourself a little in my place. I\xe2\x80\x99m very serious, you know; I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\namusing myself with peeping and running away. I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced that we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nliving in a fool\xe2\x80\x99s paradise, that the ground\xe2\x80\x99s heaving under our feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the ground, my dear; it\xe2\x80\x99s you who are turning somersaults,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMadame Grandoni interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you, my friend, you\xe2\x80\x99ve the happy faculty of believing what you like\r\nto believe. I have to believe what I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wishes to throw herself into the revolution, to guide it, to\r\nenlighten it,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni said to Hyacinth, speaking now with\r\nimperturbable gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure she could direct it in any sense she would wish!\xe2\x80\x9d the young\r\nman responded in his glow. The pure, high dignity with which the\r\nPrincess had just spoken and which appeared to cover a suppressed\r\ntremor of passion set his pulses throbbing, and though he scarcely saw\r\nwhat she meant\xe2\x80\x94her aspirations appearing as yet so vague\xe2\x80\x94her tone, her\r\nvoice, her wonderful face showed she had a generous soul.\r\n\r\nShe answered his eager declaration with a serious smile and a\r\nmelancholy head-shake. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no such pretensions and my good old\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s laughing at me. Of course that\xe2\x80\x99s very easy; for what in fact\r\ncan be more absurd on the face of it than for a woman with a title,\r\nwith diamonds, with a carriage, with servants, with a position, as\r\nthey call it, to sympathise with the upward struggles of those who\r\nare below? \xe2\x80\x98Give all that up and we\xe2\x80\x99ll believe you,\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99ve a right\r\nto say. I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to give them up the moment it will help the cause;\r\nI assure you that\xe2\x80\x99s the least difficulty. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to teach, I\r\nwant to learn; and above all I want to know _\xc3\xa0 quoi m\xe2\x80\x99en tenir_. Are\r\nwe on the eve of great changes or are we not? Is everything that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngathering force underground, in the dark, in the night, in little\r\nhidden rooms, out of sight of governments and policemen and idiotic\r\n\xe2\x80\x98statesmen\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94heaven save them!\xe2\x80\x94is all this going to burst forth some\r\nfine morning and set the world on fire? Or is it to sputter out and\r\nspend itself in vain conspiracies, be dissipated in sterile heroisms\r\nand abortive isolated movements? I want to know _\xc3\xa0 quoi m\xe2\x80\x99en tenir_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe repeated, fixing her visitor with more brilliant eyes and almost\r\nas if he could tell her on the spot. Then suddenly she added in quite\r\na different tone: \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve an idea you know French. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nCaptain Sholto tell me so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve some little acquaintance with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve French\r\nblood in my veins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe considered him as if he had proposed to her some attaching problem.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can see you\xe2\x80\x99re not _le premier venu_. Now your friend, of\r\nwhom you were speaking, is a chemist; and you yourself\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\noccupation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just a bookbinder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must be delightful. I wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99d bind me some books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d have to bring them to our shop, and I can do there only the work\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s given out to me. I might manage it by myself at home,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth\r\nfreely professed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like that better. And what do you call home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe place I live in, in the north of London: a little street you\r\ncertainly never heard of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it called?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLomax Place, at your service,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to reflect his innocent gaiety; she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit afraid\r\nto let him see she liked him. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of it.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know London very well; I haven\xe2\x80\x99t lived here long. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent\r\nmost of my life abroad. My husband\xe2\x80\x99s a foreigner, a South Italian. We\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t live always together. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the manners of this country\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nof any class, have I, eh? Oh this country\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal to be\r\nsaid about it and a great deal to be done, as you of course understand\r\nbetter than any one. But I want to know London; it interests me more\r\nthan I can say\xe2\x80\x94the huge, swarming, smoky, human city. I mean real\r\nLondon, the people and all their sufferings and passions; not Park Lane\r\nand Bond Street. Perhaps you can help me\xe2\x80\x94it would be a great kindness:\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know men like you for. You see it isn\xe2\x80\x99t idle, my\r\nhaving given you so much trouble to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very glad to show you all I know. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t much and\r\nabove all it isn\xe2\x80\x99t pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you live with in Lomax Place?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, a little oddly, by\r\nway of allowance for this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Sholto\xe2\x80\x99s leaving the young lady\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s coming back here,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame\r\nGrandoni announced, inspecting the balcony with her instrument. The\r\norchestra had been for some time playing the overture to the following\r\nact.\r\n\r\nHyacinth had just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI live with a dressmaker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a dressmaker? Do you mean\xe2\x80\x94do you mean\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d But the Princess paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean she\xe2\x80\x99s your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame Grandoni more bravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she gives you rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d the Princess suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many do you think I have? She gives me everything, or has done\r\nso in the past. She brought me up; she\xe2\x80\x99s the best little woman in the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better command a dress of her,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni threw off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your family, where are they?\xe2\x80\x9d the Princess continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone at all. I never had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the French blood you speak of and which I see perfectly in your\r\nface\xe2\x80\x94you haven\xe2\x80\x99t the English expression or want of expression\xe2\x80\x94that must\r\nhave come to you through some one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, through my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she\xe2\x80\x99s dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a great loss, because French mothers are usually so much to\r\ntheir sons.\xe2\x80\x9d The Princess looked at her painted fan as she opened and\r\nclosed it; after which she said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, you\xe2\x80\x99ll come some day.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll arrange it.\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth felt the answer to this could be only a\r\nsilent inclination of his utmost stature, and to make it he rose from\r\nhis chair. As he stood there, conscious he had stayed long enough and\r\nyet not knowing exactly how to withdraw, the Princess, with her fan\r\nclosed, resting upright on her knee, and her hands clasped on the end\r\nof it, turned up her strange lovely eyes at him and said: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think\r\nanything will occur soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill occur\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a crisis\xe2\x80\x94that you\xe2\x80\x99ll make yourselves felt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this beautiful woman\xe2\x80\x99s face there was to his bewildered perception\r\nsomething at once inspiring, tempting and mocking; and the effect\r\nof her expression was to make him say rather clumsily, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try and\r\nascertain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d as if she had asked him whether her carriage were at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about; but please don\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nit for another hour or two. I want to see what becomes of the Pearl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMadame Grandoni interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember what I told you: I\xe2\x80\x99d give up everything\xe2\x80\x94everything!\xe2\x80\x9d And the\r\nPrincess kept looking up at him. Then she held out her hand, and this\r\ntime he knew sufficiently what he was about to take it.\r\n\r\nWhen he bade good-night to Madame Grandoni the old lady sounded at him\r\nwith a comical sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, she is respectable!\xe2\x80\x9d and out in the lobby\r\nwhen he had closed the door of the box behind him he found himself\r\nechoing these words and repeating mechanically, \xe2\x80\x9cShe _is_ respectable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThey were on his lips as he stood suddenly face to face with Captain\r\nSholto, who grasped his shoulder once more and shook him in that free\r\nyet insinuating manner for which this officer appeared remarkable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, you were born under a lucky star.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never supposed it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth, changing colour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy what in the world would you have? You\xe2\x80\x99ve the faculty, the precious\r\nfaculty, of inspiring women with an interest\xe2\x80\x94but an interest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ask them in the box there! I behaved like an awful muff,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHyacinth declared, overwhelmed now with a sense of opportunities\r\nmissed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that. And the lady upstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me of anything but you. You may imagine how I\r\nliked it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it either. But I must go up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, she counts the minutes. Such a charming person!\xe2\x80\x9d Captain\r\nSholto added with more propriety of tone. As Hyacinth left him he\r\ncalled out: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll go far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the young man took his place in the balcony beside Millicent she\r\ngave him no greeting nor asked any question about his adventures in the\r\nmore privileged part of the house. She only turned her fine complexion\r\nupon him for some minutes, and as he himself was not in the mood to\r\nbegin to chatter the silence continued\xe2\x80\x94continued till after the curtain\r\nhad risen on the last act of the play. Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s attention was now\r\nevidently not at her disposal for the stage, and in the midst of a\r\nviolent scene which included pistol-shots and shrieks she said at last\r\nto her companion: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a tidy lot, your Princess, by what I learn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray what do you know about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what that fellow told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what may that have been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s a bad \xe2\x80\x99un as ever was. Her own husband has had to turn her\r\nout of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth remembered the allusion the lady herself had made to her\r\nmatrimonial situation; in spite of which he would have liked to be\r\nable to reply to Miss Henning that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe a word of it. He\r\nwithheld the doubt and after a moment simply remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care? Well, I do then!\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent cried. And as it was\r\nimpossible in view of the performance and the jealous attention of\r\ntheir neighbours to continue the conversation at this pitch, she\r\ncontented herself with ejaculating in a somewhat lower key at the\r\nend of five minutes during which she had been watching the stage:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious, what dreadful common stuff!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth then wondered if\r\nCaptain Sholto had given her this formula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention to Pinnie or Mr. Vetch that he had been taken up by\r\na great lady; but he mentioned it to Paul Muniment, to whom he now\r\nconfided a great many things. He had at first been in considerable\r\nfear of his straight loud north-country friend, who showed signs of\r\ncultivating logic and criticism in a degree that was hostile to fine\r\nloose talk; but he discovered in him later a man to whom one could\r\nsay anything in the world if one didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it of more importance\r\nto be sympathised with than to be understood. For a revolutionist\r\nhe was strangely unexasperated, was indulgent even to contempt. The\r\nsight of all the things he wanted to change had seemingly no power to\r\nirritate him, and if he joked about questions that lay very near his\r\nheart his humour had no ferocity\xe2\x80\x94the fault Hyacinth sometimes found\r\nwith it rather was that it was innocent to puerility. Our hero envied\r\nhis power of combining a care for the wide misery of mankind with the\r\napparent state of mind of the cheerful and virtuous young workman who\r\nof a Sunday morning has put on a clean shirt and, not having taken the\r\ngilt off his wages the night before, weighs against each other, for a\r\nhappy day, the respective attractions of Epping Forest and Gravesend.\r\nHe never dragged in with the least snarl his personal lot and his daily\r\nlife; it had not seemed to occur to him for instance that \xe2\x80\x9csociety\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas really responsible for the condition of his sister\xe2\x80\x99s spinal column,\r\nthough Eustache Poupin and his wife (who practically, however, were as\r\npatient as he) did everything they could to make him say so, believing\r\nevidently that it would relieve him. Apparently he cared nothing for\r\nwomen, talked of them rarely and always decently, and had never a sign\r\nof a sweetheart save in so far as Lady Aurora Langrish might pass for\r\none. He never drank a drop of beer nor touched a pipe; he always had a\r\nclear tone, a fresh cheek and a merely, an imperturbably intelligent\r\neye, and once excited on Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s part a kind of elder-brotherly\r\nindulgence by the open-mouthed glee and credulity with which, when\r\nthe pair were present, in the sixpenny gallery, at Astley\xe2\x80\x99s, at an\r\nequestrian pantomime, he followed the tawdry spectacle. He once\r\npronounced the young bookbinder a suggestive little beggar, and\r\nHyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of him was by this time so exalted that the remark\r\nhad almost the value of a patent of nobility. Our hero treated himself\r\nto a high unlimited faith in him; he had always dreamed of some grand\r\nfriendship and this was the best opening he had yet encountered. No one\r\ncould entertain a sentiment of that sort more nobly, more ingeniously\r\nthan Hyacinth, or cultivate with more art the intimate personal\r\nrelation. It disappointed him sometimes that his confidence was not\r\nmore unreservedly repaid; that on certain important points of the\r\nsocialistic programme Muniment would never commit himself and had not\r\nyet shown the _fond du sac_, as Eustache Poupin called it, to so ardent\r\nan admirer. He answered particular appeals freely enough, and answered\r\nthem occasionally in a manner that made Hyacinth jump, as when in reply\r\nto a question about his attitude on capital punishment he said that\r\nso far from wishing it abolished he should go in for extending it much\r\nfurther\xe2\x80\x94he should impose it on those who habitually lied or got drunk;\r\nbut his friend had always a feeling that he kept back his best card and\r\nthat even in the listening circle in Bloomsbury, when only the right\r\nmen were present, there were unspoken conclusions in his mind which\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t as yet think any one good enough to be favoured with. So far\r\ntherefore from suspecting him of any real poverty of programme Hyacinth\r\nwas sure he had extraordinary things in his head; that he was thinking\r\nthem out to the logical end, wherever it might land him; and that the\r\nnight he should produce them with the door of the club-room guarded and\r\nthe company bound by a tremendous oath the others would look at each\r\nother, gasp and turn pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants to see you; she asked me to bring you; she was very\r\nserious,\xe2\x80\x9d our young man meanwhile said, reporting his interview with\r\nthe ladies in the box at the play; which, however, now that he looked\r\nback upon it, seemed as queer as a dream and not much more likely than\r\nthat sort of experience to have a continuation in one\xe2\x80\x99s waking hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo bring me\xe2\x80\x94to bring me where?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Muniment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou talk as if I were\r\na sample out of your shop or a little dog you had for sale. Has she\r\never seen me? Does she think I\xe2\x80\x99m smaller than you? What does she know\r\nabout me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, principally that you\xe2\x80\x99re a friend of mine\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean it ought to be enough for me that she\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of\r\nyours? I\xe2\x80\x99ve a notion you\xe2\x80\x99ll have some queer ones before you\xe2\x80\x99ve done;\r\na good many more than I have time to talk to. And how can I go to see\r\na delicate female with those paws?\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment said as he exhibited ten\r\nwork-stained fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuy a pair of gloves\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth recognised the serious character of\r\nthis obstacle. But after a moment he added: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to do\r\nthat. She wants to see dirty hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough, good Lord! She needn\xe2\x80\x99t send for me for the\r\npurpose. But isn\xe2\x80\x99t she making game of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very possible, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what good it can do her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not obliged to find excuses for the pampered classes. Their\r\nbloated luxury begets evil, impudent desires; they\xe2\x80\x99re capable of doing\r\nharm for the sake of harm. Besides, is she genuine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she isn\xe2\x80\x99t, what becomes of your explanation?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter; at night all cats are grey. Whatever she\r\nis, she\xe2\x80\x99s an idle, bedizened trifler; perhaps even a real profligate\r\nfemale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had seen her you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk of her that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid I should see her then, if she\xe2\x80\x99s going to corrupt me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose she\xe2\x80\x99ll corrupt _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth demanded with an\r\nexpression of face and a tone of voice which produced on his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart an explosion of mirth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can she, after all, when you\xe2\x80\x99re already such a little mass of\r\ncorruption?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d and Hyacinth looked very grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that if I did I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you noticed that\r\nI say what I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you don\xe2\x80\x99t, not half of it: you\xe2\x80\x99re as dark as a fish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul Muniment glanced at his friend as if rather struck with the\r\npenetration of that remark; then he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, if I should give\r\nyou the other half of my opinion of you do you think you\xe2\x80\x99d fancy it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll save you the trouble. I\xe2\x80\x99m a very clever, conscientious, promising\r\nyoung chap, and any one would be proud to claim me as a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what your Princess told you? She must be a precious piece of\r\ngoods!\xe2\x80\x9d Paul exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cDid she pick your pocket meanwhile?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; a few minutes later I missed a silver cigar-case engraved with\r\nthe arms of the Robinsons. Seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth continued, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nconsider it possible that a woman of that class should want to know\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on among the like of us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends on what class you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, a woman with a lot of wonderful jewels and wonderful scents\r\nand the manners of an angel. I wonder if even the young ladies in the\r\nperfumery shops have such manners\xe2\x80\x94they can\xe2\x80\x99t have such pearls. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nqueer of course, that sort of interest, but it\xe2\x80\x99s conceivable; why not?\r\nThere may be unselfish natures; there may be disinterested feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there may be fine ladies in an awful funk about their jewels\r\nand even about their manners. Seriously, as you say, it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly\r\nconceivable. I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the least surprised at the aristocracy being\r\ncurious to know what we\xe2\x80\x99re up to and wanting very much to look into\r\nit. In their place I should be very uneasy, and if I were a woman\r\nwith angelic manners very likely I too should be glad to get hold of a\r\nsoft susceptible little bookbinder and pump him dry, bless his tender\r\nheart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her secrets?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hyacinth, flushing with\r\nvirtuous indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecrets? What secrets could you tell her, my pretty lad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth turned away. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t trust me\xe2\x80\x94you never have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will, some day\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Muniment, who evidently had\r\nno intention of harshness, at least in respect to Hyacinth, a thing\r\nthat appeared impossible to him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when we do you\xe2\x80\x99ll cry with\r\ndisappointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _you_ won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth returned. And then he asked if his friend\r\nthought the Princess Casamassima a spy of spies\xe2\x80\x94the devil she\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nto be!\xe2\x80\x94and why, if she were in that line, Sholto was not, since it\r\nmust be supposed he was not when they had seen fit to let him walk in\r\nand out, at any rate, at the place in Bloomsbury. Muniment didn\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nknow whom he meant, not having had any relations with the gentleman;\r\nbut he summoned a sufficient image after his companion had described\r\nthe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. He then remarked with his usual geniality\r\nthat he didn\xe2\x80\x99t take him for anything worse than a jackass; but even\r\nif he had edged himself into the place with every intention to betray\r\nthem what handle could he possibly get\xe2\x80\x94what use against them could he\r\nmake of anything he had seen or heard? If he had a fancy to dip into\r\nworkingmen\xe2\x80\x99s clubs (Paul remembered now the first night he came; he\r\nhad been brought by that German cabinet-maker who always had a bandaged\r\nneck and smoked a pipe with a bowl as big as a stove); if it amused him\r\nto put on a bad hat and inhale foul tobacco and call his \xe2\x80\x9cinferiors\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy dear fellow\xe2\x80\x9d; if he thought that in doing so he was getting an\r\ninsight into the people and going halfway to meet them and preparing\r\nfor what was coming\xe2\x80\x94all this was his own affair and he was very\r\nwelcome, though a man must be a flat who would spend his evening in a\r\nhole like that when he might enjoy his comfort in one of those flaming\r\nbig shops, full of armchairs and flunkies, in Pall Mall. And what did\r\nhe see after all in Bloomsbury? Nothing but a remarkably stupid \xe2\x80\x9csocial\r\ngathering\xe2\x80\x9d where there were clay pipes and a sanded floor and not half\r\nenough gas and the principal papers; and where the men, as any one\r\nwould know, were advanced radicals and mostly advanced idiots. He could\r\npat as many of them on the back as he liked and say the House of Lords\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t last till midsummer; but what discoveries would he make? He\r\nwas simply on the same lay as Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s Princess; he was nervous and\r\nscared and thought he would see for himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same sort as the Princess. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s in a very\r\ndifferent line!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDifferent of course; she\xe2\x80\x99s a handsome woman, I suppose, and he\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nugly man; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that either of them will save us or spoil\r\nus. Their curiosity\xe2\x80\x99s natural, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve other things to do than to show\r\nthem over: therefore you can tell her Serene Highness that I\xe2\x80\x99m much\r\nobliged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth reflected a moment and then said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou show Lady Aurora over;\r\nyou seem to wish to give her the information she desires; therefore\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the difference? If it\xe2\x80\x99s right for her to take an interest why\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it right for my Princess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she\xe2\x80\x99s already yours what more can she want?\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\nI know of Lady Aurora and all I look at is that she comes and sits\r\nwith Rosy and brings her tea and waits on her. If the Princess will do\r\nas much I\xe2\x80\x99ll see what _I_ can do; but apart from that I shall never\r\ntake a grain of interest in her interest in the masses\xe2\x80\x94or in this\r\nparticular mass!\xe2\x80\x9d And Paul, with his discoloured thumb, designated\r\nhis own substantial person. His tone was disappointing to Hyacinth,\r\nwho was surprised at his not appearing to think the incident at the\r\ntheatre more remarkable and romantic. He seemed to regard his mate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexplanation of the passage as all-sufficient; but when a moment later\r\nhe made use, in referring to the mysterious lady, of the expression\r\nthat she was \xe2\x80\x9cquaking\xe2\x80\x9d that critic broke out: \xe2\x80\x9cNever in the world;\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s not afraid of anything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my lad, not afraid of you, evidently!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth paid no attention\r\nto this coarse sally, but resumed with a candour that was proof against\r\nfurther ridicule: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she can do me a hurt of any kind if we\r\nfollow up our acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very likely, but you must hit her back and give it to her badly.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s your line, you know\xe2\x80\x94to go in for what\xe2\x80\x99s going, to live your\r\nlife, to gratify the \xe2\x80\x98sex.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m an ugly, grimy brute, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to watch\r\nthe fires and mind the shop; but you\xe2\x80\x99re one of those taking little\r\nbeggars who _must_ run about and see the world. You ought to be an\r\nornament to society, like a young man in an illustrated storybook. Only\r\nyou know,\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment added in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cif she should hurt you very\r\nmuch I _would_ have a go at her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth had been intending for some time to take Pinnie to call on\r\nthe prostrate damsel in Audley Court, to whom he had promised that\r\nhis benefactress (he had told Rose Muniment she was his godmother\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nsounded so right) should pay this civility; but the affair had been\r\ndelayed by wan hesitations on the part of the dressmaker, the poor\r\nwoman having hard work to imagine to-day that there were people in\r\nLondon forlorn enough for her countenance to be of value to them.\r\nHer social curiosity had quite died out and she knew she no longer\r\nmade the same figure in public as when her command of the fashions\r\nenabled her to illustrate them in her own little person by the aid of\r\na good deal of whalebone. Moreover she felt that Hyacinth had strange\r\nfriends and still stranger opinions; she suspected him of taking an\r\nunnatural interest in politics and of being somehow not on the right\r\nside, little as she knew about parties or causes; and she had a vague\r\nconviction that this kind of perversity only multiplied the troubles of\r\nthe poor, who, according to theories which Pinnie had never reasoned\r\nout but which in her breast were as deep as religion, ought always\r\nto be of the same way of thinking as the rich. They were unlike them\r\nenough in their poverty without trying to add other differences. When\r\nat last she accompanied Hyacinth to Camberwell one Saturday evening at\r\nmidsummer it was in a sighing, sceptical, second-best manner; but if\r\nhe had told her he wished it she would have gone with him to a soiree\r\nat a scavenger\xe2\x80\x99s. There was no more danger of Rose Muniment\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\nout than that one of the bronze couchant lions in Trafalgar Square\r\nshould have walked down Whitehall; but he had let her know in advance\r\nand he perceived, as he opened her door in obedience to a quick, shrill\r\nsummons, that she had had the happy thought of inviting Lady Aurora to\r\nhelp her entertain Miss Pynsent. Such at least was the inference he\r\ndrew from seeing her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s memorable figure rise before him for\r\nthe first time since their meeting there. He presented his companion to\r\ntheir reclining hostess, and Rosy immediately repeated her name to the\r\nrepresentative of Belgrave Square. Pinnie curtseyed down to the ground\r\nas Lady Aurora put out her hand to her, and then slipped noiselessly\r\ninto a chair beside the bed. Lady Aurora laughed and fidgeted in a\r\nfriendly, cheerful, yet at the same time rather pointless manner, and\r\nHyacinth gathered that she had no recollection of having seen him.\r\nHis attention, however, was mainly given to Pinnie: he watched her\r\njealously, to see if on this important occasion she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put forth\r\na certain stiff, quaint, polished politeness of which she possessed\r\nthe secret and which made him liken her extraction of the sense of\r\nthings to the nip of a pair of old-fashioned silver sugar-tongs. Not\r\nonly for Pinnie\xe2\x80\x99s sake but for his own as well he wished her to figure\r\nas a superior little woman; so he hoped she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose her head if\r\nRosy should begin to talk about Inglefield. She was evidently much\r\nimpressed by Rosy and kept repeating \xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d under her breath\r\nwhile the small strange person in the bed rapidly explained to her\r\nthat there was nothing in the world she would have liked so much as\r\nto follow _her_ delightful profession, but that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sit up to\r\nit, and had never had a needle in her hand but once, when at the end of\r\nthree minutes it had dropped into the sheets and got into the mattress,\r\nso that she had always been afraid it would work out again and stick\r\ninto her: which it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done yet and perhaps never would\xe2\x80\x94she lay so\r\nquiet, pushing it about so little. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d think it\xe2\x80\x99s me that\r\ntrimmed the little handkerchief I wear round my neck,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Muniment\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d think I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do less, lying here all day long\r\nwith complete command of my time. Not a stitch of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m the finest\r\nlady in London; I never lift my finger for myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s a present from\r\nher ladyship\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s own beautiful needlework. What do you\r\nthink of that? Have you ever met any one so favoured before? And the\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x94just look at the work and tell me how it strikes you.\xe2\x80\x9d The girl\r\npulled off the bit of muslin from her neck and thrust it at Pinnie,\r\nwho looked at it confusedly and gasped \xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d partly in\r\nsympathy, partly as if, in spite of the consideration she owed every\r\none, those were very odd proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very badly done; surely you see that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Aurora. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nonly a joke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, everything\xe2\x80\x99s a joke!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the irrepressible\r\ninvalid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ceverything except my state of health; that\xe2\x80\x99s admitted to be\r\nserious. When her ladyship sends me five shillings\xe2\x80\x99 worth of coals\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s only a joke; and when she brings me a bottle of the finest port,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s another; and when she climbs up seventy-seven stairs (there are\r\nseventy-seven, I know perfectly, though I never go up or down) to spend\r\nthe evening with me at the height of the London season, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best\r\nof all. I know all about the London season though I never go out, and\r\nI appreciate what her ladyship gives up. She\xe2\x80\x99s very jocular indeed, but\r\nfortunately I know how to take it. You can see it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do for me to\r\nbe touchy, can\xe2\x80\x99t you, Miss Pynsent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear, I should be so glad to make you anything myself; it would\r\nbe better\xe2\x80\x94it would be better\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d poor Pinnie floundered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be better than my poor work. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do that sort\r\nof thing in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Aurora.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that, my lady\xe2\x80\x94I only meant it would be more\r\nconvenient. Anything in the world she might fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d the dressmaker went\r\non as if it were a question of the invalid\xe2\x80\x99s appetite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you see I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear things\xe2\x80\x94only a flannel jacket to be a bit\r\ntidy,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Muniment returned. \xe2\x80\x9cI go in only for smart counterpanes, as\r\nyou can see for yourself\xe2\x80\x9d; and she spread her white hands complacently\r\nover her coverlet of brilliant patchwork. \xe2\x80\x9cNow doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that look to\r\nyou, Miss Pynsent, as if it might be one of her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s jokes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh my good friend, how can you? I never went so far as that!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady\r\nAurora interposed with visible anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ve given me almost everything; I sometimes forget. This only\r\ncost me sixpence; so it comes to the same thing as if it had been a\r\npresent. Yes, only sixpence in a raffle in a bazaar at Hackney, for the\r\nbenefit of the Wesleyan Chapel three years ago. A young man who works\r\nwith my brother and lives in that part offered him a couple of tickets;\r\nand he took one and I took one. When I say \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99 of course I mean he\r\ntook the two; for how should I find (by which I naturally mean how\r\nshould _he_ find) a sixpence in that little cup on the chimney-piece\r\nunless he had put it there first? Of course my ticket took a prize, and\r\nof course, as my bed\xe2\x80\x99s my dwelling-place, the prize was a beautiful\r\ncounterpane of every colour of the rainbow. Oh there never was such\r\nluck as mine!\xe2\x80\x9d Rosy chattered, flashing her gay demented eyes at\r\nHyacinth as if to irritate him with her contradictious optimism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very lovely, but if you\xe2\x80\x99d like another for a change I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\ngreat many pieces,\xe2\x80\x9d Pinnie remarked with a generosity which made the\r\nyoung man feel she was acquitting herself finely.\r\n\r\nRose Muniment laid her little hand on the dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s arm and\r\nresponded straight: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not a change, not a change. How can there\r\nbe a change when there\xe2\x80\x99s already everything? There\xe2\x80\x99s everything\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94every colour that was ever seen or invented or dreamed of since\r\nthe world began.\xe2\x80\x9d And with her other hand she stroked affectionately\r\nher variegated quilt. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve a great many pieces, but you haven\xe2\x80\x99t as\r\nmany as there are here; and the more you should patch them together the\r\nmore the whole thing would resemble this dear dazzling old friend. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nanother idea, very very charming, and perhaps her ladyship can guess\r\nwhat it is.\xe2\x80\x9d Rosy kept her fingers on Pinnie\xe2\x80\x99s arm and, smiling, turned\r\nher brilliant eyes from one of her female companions to the other as\r\nto associate and blend them as closely as possible in their interest\r\nin her. \xe2\x80\x9cIn connexion with what we were talking about a few minutes\r\nago\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t your ladyship just go a little further in the same line?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen as Lady Aurora looked troubled and embarrassed, blushing at being\r\ncalled upon to answer a conundrum, as it were, so publicly, her infirm\r\nfriend came to her assistance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will surprise you at first, but\r\nit won\xe2\x80\x99t when I\xe2\x80\x99ve explained it: my idea is just simply a sweet pink\r\ndressing-gown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sweet pink dressing-gown!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Aurora repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a neat black trimming! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see the connexion with what we\r\nwere talking of before our good visitors came in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pinnie. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made them like that in\r\nmy time. Or a carefully-selected blue trimmed with white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, pink and black, pink and black\xe2\x80\x94to suit my complexion. Perhaps\r\nyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I _have_ a complexion; but there are very few things I\r\nlack! Anything at all I should fancy, you were so good as to say. Well\r\nnow, I fancy that! Your ladyship does see the connexion by this time,\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Aurora looked distressed, as if she felt she certainly ought to\r\nsee it but was not sure that even yet it didn\xe2\x80\x99t escape her, and as\r\nif at the same time she were struck with the fact that this sudden\r\nevocation might result in a strain on the small dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s resources.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pink dressing-gown would certainly be very becoming and Miss Pynsent\r\nwould be very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; while Hyacinth made the mental comment\r\nthat it was a largeish order, since Pinnie would have obviously to\r\nfurnish the materials as well as the labour. The amiable coolness with\r\nwhich the invalid laid her under contribution was, however, to his\r\nsense, quite in character, and he reflected that after all when you\r\nwere flat on your back like that you had the right to reach out your\r\nhands (it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far you could reach at best) and grab what you could\r\nget. Pinnie declared she knew just the article Miss Muniment wanted and\r\nthat she would undertake to make a perfect duck of it; and Rosy went\r\non to say that she must explain of what use such an article would be,\r\nbut for this purpose there must be another guess. She would give it to\r\nMiss Pynsent and Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x94as many times as they liked: what _had_ she\r\nand Lady Aurora been talking about before they came in? She clasped her\r\nhands and her eyes shone with her eagerness while she continued to turn\r\nthem from Lady Aurora to the dressmaker. What would they imagine? What\r\nwould they think natural, delightful, magnificent\xe2\x80\x94if one could only\r\nend at last by making out the right place to put it? Hyacinth suggested\r\nsuccessively a cage of Java sparrows, a music-box and a shower-bath\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nperhaps even a full-length portrait of her ladyship; and Pinnie looked\r\nat him askance in a frightened way, as if perchance he were joking too\r\nbroadly. Rosy at last relieved their suspense and announced: \xe2\x80\x9cA sofa,\r\njust a sofa now! What do you say to that? Do you suppose that idea\r\ncould have come from any one but her ladyship? She must have all the\r\ncredit of it; she came out with it in the course of conversation. I\r\nbelieve we were talking of the peculiar feeling that comes just under\r\nthe shoulder-blades if one never has a change. She mentioned it as she\r\nmight have mentioned just the right sort of rub\xe2\x80\x94there _are_ such wrong\r\nsorts!\xe2\x80\x94or another spoonful of that American stuff. We\xe2\x80\x99re thinking it\r\nover and one of these days, if we give plenty of time to the question,\r\nwe shall find the place, the very nicest and snuggest of all and no\r\nother. I hope _you_ see the connexion with the pink dressing-gown,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\npursued to Pinnie, \xe2\x80\x9cand I hope you see the importance of the question,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall anything go?\xe2\x80\x99 I should like you to look round a bit and tell me\r\nwhat you would answer if I were to say to you, \xe2\x80\x98_Can_ anything go?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing _I_ should like to part with,\xe2\x80\x9d Pinnie\r\nreturned; and while she surveyed the scene Lady Aurora, with\r\ndiscretion, to lighten Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility, got up and turned to\r\nthe window, which was open to the summer evening and admitted still\r\nthe last rays of the long day. Hyacinth, after a moment, placed\r\nhimself beside her, looking out with her at the dusky multitude of\r\nchimney-pots and the small black houses roofed with grimy tiles. The\r\nthick warm air of a London July floated beneath them, suffused with\r\nthe everlasting uproar of the town, which appeared to have sunk into\r\nquietness but again became a mighty voice as soon as one listened for\r\nit; here and there, in poor windows, glimmered a turbid light, and high\r\nabove, in a clearer smokeless zone, a sky still fair and luminous, a\r\nfaint silver star looked down. The sky was the same that bent far away\r\nin the country over golden fields and purple hills and gardens where\r\nnightingales sang; but from this point of view everything that covered\r\nthe earth was ugly and sordid and seemed to express or to represent the\r\nweariness of toil. Presently, to Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment, Lady Aurora\r\nsaid to him: \xe2\x80\x9cYou never came after to get the books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose you kindly offered to lend me? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was an\r\nunderstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave an uneasy laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve picked them out; they\xe2\x80\x99re quite ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awfully kind of you,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man hastened to say. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nand get them some day with pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very sure he would, but\r\nit was the least he could profess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you where I live, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Aurora went on with a\r\nmovement of her head in the direction of the bed, as if she were too\r\nshy to mention it herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt she knows the way\xe2\x80\x94she could tell me every street and\r\nevery turn!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has made me describe to her very often how I come and go,\xe2\x80\x9d his\r\ncompanion concurred. \xe2\x80\x9cI think few people know more about London than\r\nshe. She never forgets anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful little witch\xe2\x80\x94she terrifies me!\xe2\x80\x9d he acknowledged.\r\n\r\nLady Aurora turned her modest eyes on him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, she\xe2\x80\x99s so good, she\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\npatient!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and so preternaturally wise and so awfully all there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she\xe2\x80\x99s immensely clever,\xe2\x80\x9d said her ladyship. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich do you think\r\nthe cleverer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cleverer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the girl or her brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be some day prime minister of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really? I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried with a flush of colour. \xe2\x80\x9cI do\r\nrejoice if you think that will be possible. You know it ought to be if\r\nthings were right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth had not professed this high faith for the purpose of playing\r\non her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, but when he felt her intense agreement\r\nit was as if he had been making sport of her. Still he said no more\r\nthan he believed when he observed in a moment that he had the greatest\r\nexpectations of Paul Muniment\xe2\x80\x99s future: he was sure the world would\r\nhear of him, that England would need him, that the public some day\r\nwould acclaim him. It was impossible to know him without feeling he was\r\nvery strong and must play some important part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe\xe2\x80\x94they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe.\xe2\x80\x9d She abounded in\r\nhis sense and he could measure the good he did her. It was moreover\r\na pleasure to himself to place on record his opinion of his friend;\r\nit seemed to make that opinion more clear, to give it the force of an\r\ninvocation or a prophecy. This was especially the case when he asked\r\nwhy on earth nature had endowed Paul Muniment with such extraordinary\r\npowers of mind, and powers of body too\xe2\x80\x94because he was as strong as a\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x94if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been intended he should do something supreme for\r\nhis fellow-men. Hyacinth confided to her ladyship that he thought the\r\npeople in his own class generally very stupid\xe2\x80\x94distinctly what he should\r\ncall third-rate minds. He wished it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so, for heaven knew he\r\nfelt kindly to them and only asked to cast his lot with theirs; but he\r\nwas obliged to confess that centuries of poverty, of ill-paid toil, of\r\nbad insufficient food and wretched housing hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a favourable effect\r\non the higher faculties. All the more reason that when there was a\r\nsplendid exception like their friend it should count for a tremendous\r\nforce\xe2\x80\x94it had so much to make up for, so many to act for. And then\r\nHyacinth repeated that in his own low walk of life people had really\r\nnot the faculty of thought; their minds had been simplified\xe2\x80\x94reduced\r\nto two or three elements. He saw that such judgements made his\r\nfellow-guest very uncomfortable; she turned about, she twisted herself\r\nvaguely as if she wished to protest, but she was far too considerate\r\nto interrupt him. He had no wish to worry her, but there were times\r\nwhen he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t withstand the perverse satisfaction of insisting on\r\nhis lowliness of station, of turning the knife in the wound inflicted\r\nby such explicit reference, and of letting it be seen that if his\r\nplace in the world was immeasurably small he at least had no illusions\r\nabout either himself or his species. Lady Aurora replied as quickly as\r\npossible that she knew a great deal about the poor\xe2\x80\x94not the poor after\r\nthe fashion of Rosy, but the terribly, hopelessly poor, with whom she\r\nwas more familiar than Hyacinth would perhaps believe\xe2\x80\x94and that she\r\nwas often struck with their great talents and their quick wit, with\r\ntheir command of conversation really of much more interest to her than\r\nmost of what one usually heard in drawing-rooms. She often found them\r\nimmensely clever.\r\n\r\nHyacinth smiled at her and said: \xe2\x80\x9cAh when you get to the lowest depths\r\nof poverty they may become rich and rare again. But I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t gone so far down. In spite of my opportunities I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nmany absolute paupers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know a great many.\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Aurora hesitated as if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nto swagger, but she brought it out. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay I know more than any\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d There was something touching and beautiful to Hyacinth in this\r\nsimple and diffident claim: it confirmed his impression that she was\r\nin some mysterious, incongruous and even slightly ludicrous manner a\r\ntrue heroine, a creature of a noble ideal. She perhaps guessed he was\r\nindulging in reflexions that might be favourable to her, for she said\r\nprecipitately the next minute, as if there were nothing she dreaded\r\nso much as the danger of a compliment: \xe2\x80\x9cI think your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s so very\r\nattractive\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure dear Rosy thinks so.\xe2\x80\x9d No sooner had she spoken\r\nthan she blushed again; it appeared to have occurred to her that he\r\nmight suppose she wished to contradict him by presenting this case of\r\nhis aunt as a proof that the baser sort, even in a prosaic upper layer,\r\nwere not without redeeming points. There was no reason why she should\r\nnot have had this intention; so without sparing her he replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean she\xe2\x80\x99s an exception to what I was saying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stammered a little; then at last, as if, since he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t spare\r\nher, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t spare him either: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and you\xe2\x80\x99re an exception\r\ntoo; you\xe2\x80\x99ll not make me believe you\xe2\x80\x99re wanting in intelligence. The\r\nMuniments don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more do I myself; but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prove that exceptions are not\r\nfrequent. I\xe2\x80\x99ve blood in my veins that\xe2\x80\x99s not the blood of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Aurora sympathetically. And with a smile she\r\nwent on: \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99re all the more of an exception\xe2\x80\x94in the upper class!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer way of taking it was the kindest in the world, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nblind Hyacinth to the fact that from his own point of view he had been\r\nextraordinarily indiscreet. He had believed a moment before that he\r\nwould have been proof against the strongest temptation to refer to the\r\nmysteries of his lineage, inasmuch as if made in a boastful spirit (and\r\nhe had no desire as yet to treat it as an exercise in humility) any\r\nsuch reference would inevitably contain an element of the grotesque. He\r\nhad never opened his lips to any one about his birth since the dreadful\r\ndays when the question was discussed with Mr. Vetch\xe2\x80\x99s assistance in\r\nLomax Place; never even to Paul Muniment, never to Millicent Henning\r\nnor to Eustache Poupin. He had his impression that people had ideas\r\nabout him, and with some of Miss Henning\xe2\x80\x99s he had been made acquainted:\r\nthese were of such a nature that he sometimes wondered if the tie\r\nuniting him to her were not on her own side a secret determination\r\nto satisfy her utmost curiosity before she had done with him. But\r\nhe flattered himself he was impenetrable, and none the less he had\r\nbegun to swagger idiotically the first time a temptation (really to\r\ncall a temptation) presented itself. He turned crimson as soon as\r\nhe had spoken, partly at the sudden image of what he had to swagger\r\nabout and partly at the absurdity of a challenge from the model of\r\ncivility before him. He hoped she didn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly regard what he\r\nhad said\xe2\x80\x94and indeed she gave no sign whatever of being startled by\r\nhis claim to a pedigree, she had too much quick delicacy for that; she\r\nappeared to notice only the symptoms of confusion that followed. But\r\nas soon as possible he gave himself a lesson in humility by remarking:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gather you spend most of your time among the poor and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\r\ncarry blessings with you. But I frankly confess I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s giving herself up to people like us when there\xe2\x80\x99s no obligation.\r\nWretched company we must be when there\xe2\x80\x99s so much better to be had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like it very much\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I say. Our little friend on the bed is\r\nperpetually talking about your house, your family, your splendours,\r\nyour gardens and greenhouses. They must be magnificent of course\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wish she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; really I wish she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. It makes one feel\r\ndreadfully!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Aurora interposed with vehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you had better give her her way; it\xe2\x80\x99s such a pleasure to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, more than to any of us!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed her ladyship helplessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how can you leave all those beautiful things to come and breathe\r\nthis beastly air, surround yourself with hideous images and associate\r\nwith people whose smallest fault is that they\xe2\x80\x99re ignorant, brutal and\r\ndirty? I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of the ladies here present,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth added with\r\nthe manner which most made Millicent Henning (who at once admired and\r\nhated it) wonder where on earth he had got it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wish I could make you understand!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lady Aurora, looking\r\nat him with troubled, appealing eyes and as if he were unexpectedly\r\ndiscouraging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when all\xe2\x80\x99s said I think I do understand! Charity exists in your\r\nnature as a kind of passion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of passion!\xe2\x80\x9d her ladyship repeated eagerly, all\r\nthankful for the word. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s charity\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that.\r\nBut whatever it is it\xe2\x80\x99s a passion\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s my life\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all I care for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe faltered as if there might be something indecent in the confession\r\nor uncertain in the recipient; and then evidently was mastered by the\r\ncomfort of being able to justify herself for an eccentricity that had\r\nexcited notice, as well as by the luxury of discharging her soul of a\r\nlong accumulation of intense things. \xe2\x80\x9cAlready when I was fifteen years\r\nold I wanted to sell all I had and give to the poor. And ever since\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to do something: it has seemed as if my heart would break\r\nif I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth was struck with a great respect, which however didn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent\r\nhis presently saying, though in words that sounded patronising even to\r\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re very religious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked away into the thickening dusk, at the smutty housetops,\r\nthe blurred emanation of lamp-light above the streets. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\nOne has one\xe2\x80\x99s ideas. Some of them may be strange. I think a great many\r\nclergymen do good, but there are others I don\xe2\x80\x99t like at all. I daresay\r\nwe had too many always at home; my father likes them so particularly.\r\nI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve known too many bishops, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the church too much on\r\nmy back. I daresay they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think at home, you know, that one was\r\nquite what one ought to be; but of course they consider me very odd\r\nin every way, as there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt I am. I should tell you that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell them everything; for what\xe2\x80\x99s the use when people don\xe2\x80\x99t understand?\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re twelve at home and eight of us girls; and if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nvery splendid, and _she_ thinks so, I should like you both to try it\r\nfor a little! My father isn\xe2\x80\x99t rich and there\xe2\x80\x99s only one of us, Eva,\r\nmarried, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not at all handsome, and\xe2\x80\x94oh there are all kinds\r\nof things,\xe2\x80\x9d the young woman went on, looking round at him an instant\r\nthrough her sense of being launched. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like society, and neither\r\nwould you if you were to see the kind there is in London\xe2\x80\x94at least in\r\nsome parts,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Aurora added considerately. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve all the humbuggery and the tiresomeness that one has to go\r\nthrough. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve got out of it; I do as I like, though it has been\r\nrather a struggle. I have my liberty, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest blessing\r\nin life except the reputation of being queer, and even a little mad,\r\nwhich is a greater advantage still. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little mad, you know; you\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if you hear it. That\xe2\x80\x99s because I stop in town\r\nwhen they go into the country; all the autumn, all the winter, when\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no one here (except three or four millions) and the rain drips,\r\ndrips, drips from the trees in the big dull park where my people live.\r\nI daresay I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to say such things to you, but, as I tell you,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m quite a proper lunatic and I might as well keep up the character.\r\nWhen one\xe2\x80\x99s one of eight daughters and there\xe2\x80\x99s very little money (for\r\nany of _us_ at least) and nothing to do but to go out with three or\r\nfour others in mackintoshes, one can easily go off one\xe2\x80\x99s head. Of\r\ncourse there\xe2\x80\x99s the village, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all a nice one, and there\r\nare the people to look after, and goodness knows they\xe2\x80\x99re in want of\r\nit; but one must work with the vicarage, and at the vicarage are four\r\nmore daughters, all old maids, and it\xe2\x80\x99s dreary and dreadful and one has\r\ntoo much of it, for they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what one thinks or feels or\r\na single word one says to them. Besides, they _are_ stupid, I admit,\r\nthe country poor; they\xe2\x80\x99re very very dense. I like Camberwell better,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Lady Aurora, smiling and taking breath at the end of her nervous,\r\nhurried, almost incoherent speech, of which she had delivered herself\r\npantingly, with strange intonations and contortions, as if afraid that\r\nfrom one moment to the other she would repent, not of her confidence\r\nbut of her egotism.\r\n\r\nIt placed her for Hyacinth in an unexpected light, making him feel\r\nthat her awkward aristocratic spinsterhood was the cover of tumultuous\r\npassions. No one could have less the appearance of being animated by a\r\nvengeful irony; but he saw this timorous, scrupulous, though clearly\r\nall generous, creature to be evidently most a person not to spare,\r\nwherever she could prick them, the institutions among which she had\r\nbeen brought up and against which she had violently reacted. He had\r\nalways supposed a reactionary to mean a backslider from the liberal\r\nfaith, but Rosy\xe2\x80\x99s devotee gave a new value to the term; she appeared to\r\nhave been driven to her present excesses by the squire and the parson\r\nand the conservative influences of that upper-class British home which\r\nour young man had always held the highest fruit of civilisation. It was\r\nclear that her ladyship was an original, and an original with force;\r\nbut it gave Hyacinth a real pang to hear her make light of Inglefield\r\n(especially the park) and of the opportunities that must have abounded\r\nin Belgrave Square. It had been his belief that in a world of suffering\r\nand injustice these things were if not the most righteous at least the\r\nmost fascinating. If they didn\xe2\x80\x99t give one the finest sensations where\r\nwere such sensations to be had? He looked at Lady Aurora with a face\r\nthat was a tribute to her sudden vividness while he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI can easily\r\nunderstand your wanting to do some good in the world, because you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nkind of saint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very curious kind!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed her ladyship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand your not liking what your position gives you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about my position. I want to live!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you call _this_ life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what my position is if you want to know: it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndeadness of the grave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth was startled by her tone, but he nevertheless laughed back\r\nat her: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, as I say, you\xe2\x80\x99re a regular saint!\xe2\x80\x9d She made no reply,\r\nfor at that moment the door opened and Paul Muniment\xe2\x80\x99s tall figure\r\nemerged from the blackness of the staircase into the twilight, now very\r\nfaint, of the room. Lady Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as they rested on him seemed to\r\ndeclare that such a vision as that at least was life. Another person\r\nas tall as himself appeared behind him, and Hyacinth recognised with\r\nastonishment their insinuating friend Captain Sholto. Paul had brought\r\nhim up for Rosy\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment, being ready, and more than ready,\r\nalways to introduce any one in the world, from the prime minister to\r\nthe common hangman, who might give that young lady a sensation. They\r\nmust have met at the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon,\xe2\x80\x9d and if the Captain, some accident\r\nsmoothing the way, had made him half as many advances as he had made\r\nsome other people, Hyacinth could see that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take long for\r\nPaul to lay him under contribution. But what the mischief was the\r\nCaptain up to? It can\xe2\x80\x99t be said that our young man arrived this evening\r\nat an answer to that question. The occasion proved highly festal and\r\nthe hostess rose to it without lifting her head from the pillow. Her\r\nbrother introduced Captain Sholto as a gentleman who had a great desire\r\nto know extraordinary people, and she made him take possession of the\r\nchair at her bedside, out of which Miss Pynsent quickly edged herself,\r\nand asked him who he was and where he came from and how Paul had made\r\nhis acquaintance and whether he had many friends in Camberwell. Sholto\r\nhad not the same grand air that hovered about him at the theatre;\r\nhe was dressed with ingenious cheapness, to an effect coinciding,\r\nhowever different the cause, with poor Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s own; but his disguise\r\nprompted our young man to wonder what made him so unmistakably a\r\ngentleman in spite of it\xe2\x80\x94in spite too of his rather overdoing the\r\nmanner of being appreciative even to rapture and thinking everything\r\nand every one most charming and curious. He stood out, in poor Rosy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntawdry little room, among her hideous attempts at decoration, and\r\nlooked to Hyacinth a being from another sphere, playing over the\r\nplace and company a smile (one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it false or unpleasant,\r\nyet it was distinctly not natural) of which he had got the habit in\r\ncamps and courts. It became intense when it rested on our hero, whom\r\nhe greeted as he might have done a dear young friend from whom he had\r\nbeen long and painfully separated. He was easy, he was familiar, he was\r\nexquisitely benevolent and bland\xe2\x80\x94he was altogether a problem.\r\n\r\nRosy was a match for him, however; he evidently didn\xe2\x80\x99t puzzle her\r\nin the least and she thought his visit the most natural thing in\r\nthe world. She expressed all the gratitude decency required, but\r\nappeared to assume that people who climbed her stairs would always\r\nfind themselves repaid. She remarked that her brother must have\r\nmet him for the first time that day, since the way he sealed a new\r\nacquaintance was usually by bringing the person immediately to call\r\non her. And when the Captain said that if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like them he\r\nsupposed the poor wretches were dropped on the spot she admitted\r\nthat this would be true if it ever happened she disapproved: as yet,\r\nhowever, she had not been obliged to draw the line. This was perhaps\r\npartly because he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t brought up any of his awful firebrands, the\r\npeople he knew for unmentionable reasons. Of such in general she had\r\na very small opinion, and she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t conceal from Captain Sholto\r\nthat she hoped he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one of them. Rosy spoke as if her brother\r\nrepresented the Camberwell district in the House of Commons and she\r\nhad discovered that a parliamentary career lowered the moral tone.\r\nThe Captain nevertheless entered quite into her views and told her\r\nthat it was as common friends of Mr. Hyacinth Robinson Mr. Muniment\r\nand he had come together; they were both so fond of him that this had\r\nimmediately constituted a kind of tie. On hearing himself commemorated\r\nin such a brilliant way Mr. Hyacinth Robinson averted his head; he\r\nsaw Captain Sholto might be trusted to make as great an effort for\r\nRosy\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment as he gathered he had made for Milly Henning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat evening at the theatre. There were not chairs enough to go round,\r\nand Paul fetched a three-legged stool from his own apartment, after\r\nwhich he undertook to make tea for the company with the aid of a tin\r\nkettle and a spirit-lamp\xe2\x80\x94these implements having been set out, flanked\r\nby half-a-dozen cups, in honour, presumably, of the little dressmaker,\r\nwho had come such a distance. The little dressmaker, Hyacinth observed\r\nwith pleasure, fell into earnest conversation with Lady Aurora, who\r\nbent over her, flushed, smiling, stammering and apparently so nervous\r\nthat Pinnie, in comparison, was majestic and serene. They communicated\r\npresently to Hyacinth a plan they had arrived at as by a quick\r\nfreemasonry, the idea that Miss Pynsent should go home to Belgrave\r\nSquare with her ladyship and settle certain preliminaries in regard to\r\nthe pink dressing-gown, toward which, if Miss Pynsent assented, her\r\nladyship hoped to be able to contribute sundry brown \xe2\x80\x9cbreadths\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\nhad proved their quality in honourable service and might be dyed to\r\nthe proper hue. Pinnie, Hyacinth could see, was in a state of religious\r\nexaltation; the visit to Belgrave Square and the idea of co-operating\r\nin such a manner with the nobility were privileges she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nsolemnly enough. The latter luxury indeed she began to enjoy without\r\ndelay, Lady Aurora suggesting that Mr. Muniment might be rather awkward\r\nabout making tea and that they should take the business off his hands.\r\nPaul gave it up to them with a pretence of compassion for their conceit\r\nand the observation that at any rate it took two women to supplant\r\none man; and Hyacinth drew him to the window to ask where he had\r\nencountered Sholto and how he liked him.\r\n\r\nThey had met in Bloomsbury, as Hyacinth supposed, and Sholto had made\r\nup to him very much as a country curate might make up to an archbishop.\r\nHe wanted to know what he thought of this and that: of the state of\r\nthe labour market at the East End, of the terrible case of the old\r\nwoman who had starved to death at Walham Green, of the practicability\r\nof more systematic out-of-door agitation and of the prospect of their\r\ngetting one of their own men\xe2\x80\x94one of the Bloomsbury lot\xe2\x80\x94into the House.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was mighty civil,\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t find that he has yet\r\npicked my pocket. He looked as if he would like me to suggest that _he_\r\nshould stand as one of our own men, one of the Bloomsbury lot. He asks\r\ntoo many questions, but makes up for it by not paying any attention to\r\nthe answers. He told me he\xe2\x80\x99d give the world to see a really superior\r\nworkingman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98interior.\xe2\x80\x99 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know at first just where he proposed\r\nto cut me open: he wanted a favourable specimen, one of the best; he\r\nhad seen one or two that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe to be up to the average.\r\nI suppose he meant Schinkel\xe2\x80\x99s, the cabinetmaker\xe2\x80\x99s, neat home, and he\r\nwanted to compare. I told him I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what sort of a specimen\r\nmy place would be, but that he was welcome to look in and that it\r\ncontained at any rate one or two original features. I expect he has\r\nfound that\xe2\x80\x99s the case\xe2\x80\x94with Rosy and the noble lady. I wanted to show\r\nhim off to Rosy; he\xe2\x80\x99s good for that if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t good for anything else.\r\nI told him we expected a little company this evening, so it might be a\r\ngood time; and he assured me that to mingle in such an occasion as that\r\nwas the dream of his existence. He seemed in a rare hurry, as if I were\r\ngoing to show him a hidden treasure, and insisted on driving me over\r\nin a hansom. Perhaps his idea is to introduce the use of cabs among the\r\nworking-classes; certainly I\xe2\x80\x99ll work to return him if that\xe2\x80\x99s to be his\r\nplatform. On our way over he talked to me about you; told me you were\r\nan intimate friend of his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say about me?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth asked with promptness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVain little beggar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he call me that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth ingenuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said you were simply astonishing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply astonishing?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a person of your low extraction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I may be rum, but he is certainly rummer. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so now\r\nyou know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul eyed his young friend. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to know what he is? He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ntout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA tout? What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, a cat\xe2\x80\x99s-paw, if you like better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth stared. \xe2\x80\x9cFor whom, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr a deep-sea fisherman, if you like better still. I give you your\r\nchoice of comparisons. I made them up as we came along in the hansom.\r\nHe throws his nets and hauls in the little fishes\xe2\x80\x94the pretty little\r\nshining, wriggling fishes. They are all for _her_; she swallows \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor her? Do you mean the Princess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho else should I mean? Take care, my tadpole!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I take care? The other day you told me not to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I remember. But now I see more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he speak of her? What did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth eagerly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you now what he said, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I guessed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had been talking of course in a very low tone, and their voices\r\nwere covered by Rosy\xe2\x80\x99s chatter in the corner, by the liberal laughter\r\nwith which Captain Sholto accompanied it, and by the much more\r\ndiscreet, though earnest, intermingled accents of Lady Aurora and Miss\r\nPynsent. But Muniment spoke more softly still\xe2\x80\x94Hyacinth felt a kind of\r\nsuspense\xe2\x80\x94as he replied in a moment: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she\xe2\x80\x99s a monster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA monster?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated our young man, from whom, this evening, his\r\nfriend was destined to draw ejaculations and echoes.\r\n\r\nPaul glanced toward the Captain, who was apparently more and more\r\nengaged by Rosy. \xe2\x80\x9cIn him I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no great harm. He\xe2\x80\x99s only a\r\npatient angler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that Captain Sholto justified to a certain extent\r\nthis definition by the manner in which he baited his hook for such\r\nlittle facts as might help him to a more intimate knowledge of his\r\nhost and hostess. When the tea was made Rosy asked Miss Pynsent to be\r\nso good as to hand it about. They must let her poor ladyship rest a\r\nlittle, mustn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x94and Hyacinth could see that in her innocent but\r\ninveterate self-complacency she wished to reward and encourage the\r\ndressmaker, draw her out and present her still more by offering her\r\nthis graceful exercise. Sholto sprang up, however, and begged Pinnie\r\nto let him relieve her, taking a cup from her hand; and poor Pinnie,\r\nwho noted in a moment that he was some kind of uncanny masquerader, who\r\nwas bewildered by the strange mixture of elements that surrounded her\r\nand unused to being treated like a duchess (for the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s manner\r\nwas a triumph of respectful gallantry), collapsed on the instant into a\r\nchair, appealing to Lady Aurora with a frightened smile and conscious\r\nthat, deeply versed as she might be in the theory of decorum, she had\r\nno precedent that could meet such an occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cNow how many families\r\nwould there be in such a house as this, and what should you say about\r\nthe sanitary arrangements? Would there be others on this floor\xe2\x80\x94what is\r\nit, the third, the fourth?\xe2\x80\x94beside yourselves, you know, and should you\r\ncall it a fair example of a tenement of its class?\xe2\x80\x9d It was with such\r\ninquiries as this that the good gentleman beguiled their tea-drinking,\r\nwhile Hyacinth made the reflexion that, though he evidently meant\r\nthem very well, they were characterised by a want of fine tact, by\r\ntoo patronising a curiosity. The Captain invited information as to the\r\nposition in life, the avocations and habits of the other lodgers, the\r\nrent they paid, their relations with each other, both in and out of\r\nthe family. \xe2\x80\x9cNow would there be a good deal of close packing, do you\r\nsuppose, and any perceptible want of\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94sobriety?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul Muniment, who had swallowed his cup of tea at a single gulp\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwas no offer of a second\xe2\x80\x94gazed out of the window into the dark, which\r\nhad now come on, with his hands in his pockets, whistling, impolitely,\r\nno doubt, but with extreme animation. He had the manner of having made\r\nover their visitor altogether to Rosy and of thinking that whatever\r\nthat personage said or did was all so much grist to her indefatigable\r\nlittle mill. Lady Aurora writhed in her pain, and it is a proof of the\r\ndegree to which our slight hero had the instincts of a man of the world\r\nthat he guessed exactly how vulgar she thought this new acquaintance.\r\nShe was doubtless rather vexed also\xe2\x80\x94Hyacinth had learned this evening\r\nthat Lady Aurora could be vexed\xe2\x80\x94at the alacrity of Rosy\xe2\x80\x99s responses:\r\nthe little person in the bed gave the Captain every satisfaction,\r\nconsidered his questions as a proper tribute to humble respectability\r\nand supplied him, as regards the population of Audley Court, with\r\nstatistics and anecdotes picked up by mysterious processes of her own.\r\nAt last her ladyship, on whom Paul Muniment had not been at pains to\r\nbestow much conversation, took leave of her, signifying to Hyacinth\r\nthat for the rest of the evening she would assume the care of Miss\r\nPynsent. Pinnie might have been consciously laid bare for monstrous\r\nrites now that she was really about to be transported to Belgrave\r\nSquare, but Hyacinth was sure she would acquit herself only the more\r\nhonourably; and when he offered to call for her there later on she\r\nreminded him under her breath and with a small sad smile of the many\r\nyears during which, after nightfall, she carried her work, pinned up in\r\na cloth, about London.\r\n\r\nPaul Muniment, according to his habit, lighted Lady Aurora downstairs,\r\nand Captain Sholto and Hyacinth were alone for some minutes with\r\nRosy; which gave the former, taking up his hat and stick, an\r\nopportunity to say to his young friend: \xe2\x80\x9cWhich way are you going?\r\nNot my way, by chance?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth saw that he hoped for his company,\r\nand he became conscious that, strangely as Paul had indulged him and\r\ntoo promiscuously investigating as he had just shown himself, this\r\ningratiating character was not more easy to resist than he had been\r\nthe other night at the theatre. The Captain bent over Rosy\xe2\x80\x99s bed as if\r\nshe had been a fine lady on a satin sofa, promising to come back very\r\nsoon and very often, and the two men went downstairs. On their way they\r\nmet their host coming up, and Hyacinth felt rather ashamed, he could\r\nscarce tell why, that his friend should see him marching off with the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctout.\xe2\x80\x9d After all, if Paul had brought him to see his sister might not\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s pupil and devotee at least walk with him? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming again, you\r\nknow, very often. I daresay you\xe2\x80\x99ll find me a great bore!\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain\r\nannounced as he bade good-night to Muniment. \xe2\x80\x9cYour sister\xe2\x80\x99s a most\r\ninteresting creature, one of the most interesting creatures I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever\r\nseen, and the whole thing, you know, exactly the type of place I wanted\r\nto get at, only much more\xe2\x80\x94really much more\xe2\x80\x94original and curious. It has\r\nbeen a jolly glimpse\xe2\x80\x94a grand success!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the Captain felt his way down the dusky shaft, while Paul Muniment,\r\nabove, gave him the benefit of rather a wavering candlestick and\r\nanswered his civil speech with an \xe2\x80\x9cOh well, you take us as you find us,\r\nyou know!\xe2\x80\x9d and an outburst of frank but not unfriendly laughter.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later Hyacinth found himself in Captain Sholto\xe2\x80\x99s chambers,\r\nseated on a big divan covered with Persian rugs and cushions and\r\nsmoking the most expensive cigar that had ever touched his lips. As\r\nthey left Audley Court the Captain had taken his arm and they had\r\nwalked along together in a desultory, colloquial manner, till on\r\nWestminster Bridge (they had followed the embankment beneath Saint\r\nThomas\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital) Sholto brought out: \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou come home with me and see my little place? I\xe2\x80\x99ve a few things that\r\nmight amuse you\xe2\x80\x94some pictures, some odds and ends I\xe2\x80\x99ve picked up, and\r\na few bindings; you might tell me what you think of them.\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth\r\nassented without demur; he had still in his ear the reverberation of\r\nthe Captain\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries in Rosy\xe2\x80\x99s room, and he saw no reason why he\r\non his side shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t embrace an occasion of ascertaining how, as his\r\ncompanion would have said, a man of fashion would live now.\r\n\r\nThis particular specimen lived in a large old-fashioned house in Queen\r\nAnne Street, of which he occupied the upper floors, where he had filled\r\nthe high wainscoted rooms with the spoils of travel and the ingenuities\r\nof modern taste. There was not a country in the world he appeared\r\nnot to have ransacked, and to Hyacinth his trophies represented a\r\nwonderfully long purse. The whole establishment, from the low-voiced\r\ninexpressive valet who, after he had poured brandy into tall tumblers,\r\nsolemnised the very popping of soda-water corks, to the quaint little\r\nsilver receptacle in which he was invited to deposit the ashes of his\r\ncigar, was such a revelation for our appreciative youth that he felt\r\nhimself hushed and depressed, so poignant was the thought that it took\r\nthousands of things he then should never possess nor know to make a\r\ncivilised being. He had often in evening walks wondered what was behind\r\nthe walls of certain ample bright-windowed houses in the West End, and\r\nnow he got an idea. The first effect of the idea was to lay him rather\r\nflat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, tell me what you thought of our friend the Princess,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nCaptain said, thrusting out the loose yellow slippers his servant had\r\nhelped to exchange for his shoes. He spoke as if he had been waiting\r\nimpatiently for the proper moment to ask that question, so much might\r\ndepend on the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful\xe2\x80\x94beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth answered almost dreamily while\r\nhis eyes wandered all over the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was so interested in all you said to her; she\xe2\x80\x99d like so much to\r\nsee you again. She means to write to you\xe2\x80\x94I suppose she can address to\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Sun and Moon\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x94and I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll go to her house if she proposes\r\na day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It seems so strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat seems strange, my dear chap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything! My sitting here with you; my introduction to that lady;\r\nthe idea of her wanting, as you say, to see me again and of her writing\r\nto me; and this whole place of yours, with all its dim rich curiosities\r\nhanging on the walls and glinting in the light of that rose-coloured\r\nlamp. You yourself too\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re strangest of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain looked at him so silently and so fixedly, through the fumes\r\nof their tobacco, after he had made this last charge that Hyacinth\r\nthought he was perhaps offended; but this impression was presently\r\ndissipated by further signs of sociability and hospitality, and Sholto\r\ntook occasion later to let him know how important it was, in the days\r\nthey were living in, not to have too small a measure of the usual,\r\ndestined as they certainly were\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin the whole matter of the relations\r\nof class with class and all that sort of thing, you know\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to witness\r\nsome very startling developments. The Captain spoke as if, for his\r\npart, he were a child of his age (so that he only wanted to see all\r\nit could show him) down to the points of his yellow slippers. Hyacinth\r\nfelt that he himself had not been very satisfactory about the Princess;\r\nbut as his nerves began to tremble a little more into tune with the\r\nsituation he repeated to his host what Milly had said about her at\r\nthe theatre\xe2\x80\x94asked if this young lady had correctly understood him in\r\nbelieving she had been turned out of the house by her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he literally pushed her into the street\xe2\x80\x94or into the garden; I\r\nbelieve the scene took place in the country. But perhaps Miss Henning\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mention, or perhaps I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, that the Prince would at the\r\npresent hour give everything he owns in the world to get her back.\r\nFancy such an absurd scene!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, laughing in a manner\r\nthat struck Hyacinth as rather profane.\r\n\r\nHe stared with dilated eyes at this picture, which seemed to demand\r\na comparison with the only incident of the sort that had come within\r\nhis experience\xe2\x80\x94the forcible ejection of intoxicated females from\r\npublic-houses. \xe2\x80\x9cThat magnificent being\xe2\x80\x94what had she done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she had made him feel he was an ass!\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain answered\r\npromptly. He turned the conversation to Miss Henning; said he was so\r\nglad Hyacinth gave him an opportunity to speak of her. He got on with\r\nher famously; perhaps she had told him. They became immense friends\xe2\x80\x94_en\r\ntout bien tout honneur, s\xe2\x80\x99entend_. Now, _there_ was another London\r\ntype, plebeian but brilliant; and how little justice one usually\r\ndid it, how magnificent it was! But she of course was a wonderful\r\nspecimen. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many women, and the women of many\r\ncountries,\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them as intimately\r\nas you like, and I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about; and when I tell you\r\nthat that one\xe2\x80\x94that one\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he suddenly paused, laughing in his\r\ndemocratic way. \xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m going too far: you must always pull\r\nme up, you know, when I do. At any rate I congratulate you; I do right\r\nheartily. Have another cigar. Now what sort of\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94salary would she\r\nreceive at her big shop, you know? I know where it is; I mean to go\r\nthere and buy some pocket-handkerchiefs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth knew neither how far Captain Sholto had been going, nor\r\nexactly on what he congratulated him; and he pretended at least an\r\nequal ignorance on the subject of Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s pecuniary gains. He\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about her, moreover, nor about his own life; he\r\nwanted to talk about the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s and to elicit information that would\r\nbe in harmony with his romantic chambers, which reminded one somehow\r\nof certain of Bulwer\xe2\x80\x99s novels. His host gratified this pretension most\r\nliberally and told him twenty stories of things of interest, often\r\nof amazement, that had happened to him in Albania, in Madagascar and\r\neven in Paris. Hyacinth induced him easily to talk about Paris (from\r\na different point of view from M. Poupin\xe2\x80\x99s) and sat there drinking in\r\nenchantments. The only thing that fell below the high level of his\r\nentertainment was the bindings of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s books, which he told\r\nhim frankly, with the conscience of an artist, were not up to the\r\nmark. After he left Queen Anne Street he was quite too excited to go\r\nstraight home; he walked about with his mind full of images and strange\r\nspeculations till the grey London streets began to clear with the\r\nsummer dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aspect of South Street, Mayfair, on a Sunday afternoon in August,\r\nis not enlivening, yet the Prince had stood for ten minutes gazing\r\nout of the window at the genteel vacancy of the scene; at the closed\r\nblinds of the opposite houses, the lonely policeman on the corner,\r\ncovering a yawn with a white cotton hand, the low-pitched light itself,\r\nwhich seemed conscious of an obligation to observe the decency of the\r\nBritish Sabbath. Our personage, however, had a talent for that kind\r\nof attitude: it was one of the things by which he had exasperated his\r\nwife; he could remain motionless, with the aid of some casual support\r\nfor his high, lean person, considering serenely and inexpressively any\r\nobject that might lie before him and presenting his aristocratic head\r\nat a favourable angle, for periods of extraordinary length. On first\r\ncoming into the room he had given some attention to its furniture and\r\ndecorations, perceiving at a glance that they were rich and varied;\r\nsome of the things he recognised as old friends, odds and ends the\r\nPrincess was fond of, which had accompanied her in her remarkable\r\nwanderings, while others were unfamiliar and suggested vividly that she\r\nhad not ceased to \xe2\x80\x9ccollect.\xe2\x80\x9d He made two reflexions: one was that she\r\nwas living as expensively as ever; the other that, however this might\r\nbe, no one had such a feeling as she for the _mise-en-sc\xc3\xa8ne_ of life,\r\nsuch a talent for arranging a room. She had always, wherever she was,\r\nthe most charming room in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was his impression that she had taken the house in South Street\r\nbut for three months; yet, gracious heaven, what had she not put into\r\nit? The Prince asked himself this question without violence, for that\r\nwas not to be his line to-day. He could be angry to a point at which\r\nhe himself was often frightened, but he honestly believed this to be\r\nonly when he had been baited past endurance, so that as a usual thing\r\nhe was really as mild and accommodating as the extreme urbanity of his\r\nmanner appeared to announce. There was indeed nothing to suggest to the\r\nworld in general that he was an impracticable or vindictive nobleman:\r\nhis features were not regular and his complexion had a bilious tone;\r\nbut his dark brown eye, which was at once salient and dull, expressed\r\nbenevolence and melancholy; his head drooped from his long neck in\r\na considerate, attentive style; and his close-cropped black hair,\r\ncombined with a short, fine, pointed beard, completed his resemblance\r\nto some old portrait of a personage of distinction under the Spanish\r\ndominion at Naples. To-day at any rate he had come in conciliation,\r\nalmost in humility, and that is why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t permit himself even\r\nto murmur at the long delay he had to accept. He knew very well that\r\nif his wife should consent to take him back it would be only after a\r\nprobation to which this little wait in her drawing-room was a trifle.\r\nIt was a quarter of an hour before the door opened, and even then it\r\nwas not the Princess who appeared, but only Madame Grandoni.\r\n\r\nTheir greeting was at first all a renouncement of words. She came to\r\nhim with both hands outstretched, and took his own and held them a\r\nwhile, looking up at him with full benignity. She had elongated her\r\nflorid, humorous face to a degree that was almost comical, and the\r\npair might have passed, in their silent solemnity, for acquaintances\r\nmeeting in a house in which last obsequies were about to take place.\r\nIt was indeed a house on which death had descended, as he very soon\r\nlearned from Madame Grandoni\xe2\x80\x99s expression; something had perished\r\nthere for ever and he might proceed to bury it as soon as he liked. His\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s ancient German friend, however, was not a person to sustain that\r\nnote very long, and when, after she had made him sit down on the sofa\r\nbeside her, she shook her head slowly and definitely several times, it\r\nwas with a brow on which a more genial appreciation of the facts had\r\nalready begun to appear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever\xe2\x80\x94never\xe2\x80\x94never?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince in a deep hoarse voice, a voice\r\nat variance with his attenuated capacity. He had much of the complexion\r\nwhich in late-coming members of long-descended races we qualify to-day\r\nas effete; but his tone might have served for the battle-cry of some\r\ndeep-chested fighting ancestor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you know your wife as well as I,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied in Italian,\r\nwhich she evidently spoke with facility, though with a strong guttural\r\naccent. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking with her: that\xe2\x80\x99s what has made me keep you.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve urged her to see you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told her that this could do no harm and\r\nwould pledge her to nothing. But you know your wife,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni\r\nrepeated with an intensity now much relaxed.\r\n\r\nPrince Casamassima looked down at his boots. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can one ever know a\r\nperson like that? I hoped she\xe2\x80\x99d see me five little minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what purpose? Have you anything to propose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what purpose? To rest my eyes on her beautiful face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you come to England for that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what else should I have come?\xe2\x80\x9d the Prince asked as he turned his\r\nblighted gaze to the opposite side of South Street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn London, such a day as this, _gi\xc3\xa0_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady\r\nsympathetically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry for you; but if I had known you were\r\ncoming I\xe2\x80\x99d have written to you that you might spare yourself the pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave a deep interminable sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ask me what I wish to propose.\r\nWhat I wish to propose is that my wife shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill me inch by inch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d be much more likely to do that if you lived with her!\xe2\x80\x9d Madame\r\nGrandoni cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Cara amica_, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to have killed you,\xe2\x80\x9d the melancholy\r\nnobleman returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, me? I\xe2\x80\x99m past killing. I\xe2\x80\x99m as hard as a stone. I went through my\r\nmiseries long ago; I suffered what you\xe2\x80\x99ve not had to suffer; I wished\r\nfor death many times and I survived it all. Our troubles don\xe2\x80\x99t kill\r\nus, _Principe mio_; it\xe2\x80\x99s we who must try to kill them. I\xe2\x80\x99ve buried not\r\na few. Besides, Christina\xe2\x80\x99s fond of me, the devil knows why!\xe2\x80\x9d Madame\r\nGrandoni added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re so good to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, who laid his hand on her\r\nfat wrinkled fist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Che vuole?_ I\xe2\x80\x99ve known her so long. And she has some such great\r\nqualities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, to whom do you say it?\xe2\x80\x9d And he gazed at his boots again, for some\r\nmoments, in silence. Suddenly he resumed: \xe2\x80\x9cHow does she look to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe always looks the same: like an angel who came down from heaven\r\nyesterday and has been rather disappointed in her first day on earth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince was evidently a man of a simple nature, and Madame\r\nGrandoni\xe2\x80\x99s rather violent metaphor took his fancy. His face lighted up\r\na little and he replied with eagerness: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, she\xe2\x80\x99s the only woman I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\never seen whose beauty never for a moment falls below itself. She has\r\nno bad days. She\xe2\x80\x99s so handsome when she\xe2\x80\x99s angry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s very handsome to-day, but she\xe2\x80\x99s not angry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot when my name was announced?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not with her then; but when she sent for me and asked me to see\r\nyou it was quite without passion. And even when I argued with her and\r\ntried to persuade her (and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like that, you know) she was\r\nstill perfectly quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe hates me, she despises me too much, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell, dear Prince, when she never mentions you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, never?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s much better than if she railed at you and abused you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean it should give me more hope for the future?\xe2\x80\x9d the young man\r\nasked quickly.\r\n\r\nHis old friend had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean it\xe2\x80\x99s better for _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered\r\nwith a laugh of which the friendly ring covered as much as possible her\r\nequivocation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you like me enough to care,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured as he turned on her his\r\nsad grateful eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry for you. _Ma che vuole?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince had apparently nothing to suggest and only exhaled in reply\r\nanother gloomy groan. Then he inquired if his wife pleased herself in\r\nthat country and if she intended to pass the summer in London. Would\r\nshe remain long in England and\xe2\x80\x94might he take the liberty to ask?\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nwere her plans? Madame Grandoni explained that the Princess had\r\nfound the English capital much more to her taste than one might have\r\nexpected, and that as for plans she had as many or as few as she had\r\nalways had. Had he ever known her to carry out any arrangement or to\r\ndo anything of any kind she had prepared or promised? She always at\r\nthe last moment did the other thing, the one that had been out of the\r\nquestion; and it was for this Madame Grandoni herself privately made\r\nher preparations. Christina, now that everything was over, would leave\r\nLondon from one day to the other; but they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know where they\r\nwere going till they arrived. The old lady concluded by asking if the\r\nPrince himself liked England. He thrust forward his full lips. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can\r\nI like anything? Besides, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here before; I\xe2\x80\x99ve many friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion saw he had more to say to her, to extract from her,\r\nbut that he was hesitating nervously because he feared to incur some\r\nwarning, some rebuff with which his dignity\xe2\x80\x94in spite of his position\r\nof discomfiture, really very great\xe2\x80\x94might find it difficult to square\r\nitself. He looked vaguely round the room and presently remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwanted to see for myself how she\xe2\x80\x99s living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s very natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d And Prince Casamassima stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard great rubbish, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni watched\r\nhim as if she foresaw what was coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe spends a terrible deal of money,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed she does.\xe2\x80\x9d The old lady knew that, careful as he was of\r\nhis very considerable property, which at one time had required much\r\nnursing, his wife\xe2\x80\x99s prodigality was not what lay heaviest on his mind.\r\nShe also knew that expensive and luxurious as Christina might be she\r\nhad never yet exceeded the income settled upon her by the Prince at the\r\ntime of their separation\xe2\x80\x94an income determined wholly by himself and his\r\nestimate of what was required to maintain the social consequence of his\r\nname, for which he had a boundless reverence. \xe2\x80\x9cShe thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s a model\r\nof thrift\xe2\x80\x94that she counts every shilling,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s a virtue she prides herself upon it\xe2\x80\x99s her economy. Indeed\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing for which she takes any credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if she knows that I\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he just hesitated, then went on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cspend\r\nalmost nothing at all. But I\xe2\x80\x99d rather live on dry bread than that in a\r\ncountry like this, in this great English society, she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a\r\nproper appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer appearance is all you could wish. How can it help being proper\r\nwith me to set her off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the best thing she has, dear friend. So long as you\xe2\x80\x99re with her\r\nI feel a certain degree of security; and one of the things I came for\r\nwas to extract from you a promise that you won\xe2\x80\x99t leave her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, let us not tangle ourselves up with promises!\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni\r\nexclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the value of any engagement one may take with\r\nregard to the Princess; it\xe2\x80\x99s like promising you I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in the\r\nbath when the hot water\xe2\x80\x99s on. When I begin to be scalded I\xe2\x80\x99ve to jump\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94naked as I may naturally be. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay while I can, but I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstay if she were to do certain things.\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni uttered\r\nthese last words with a clear emphasis, and for a minute she and her\r\ncompanion looked deep into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat things do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say what things. It\xe2\x80\x99s utterly impossible to predict on any\r\noccasion what Christina will do. She\xe2\x80\x99s capable of giving us great\r\nsurprises. The things I mean are things I should recognise as soon as\r\nI saw them, and they would make me leave the house on the spot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that if you\xe2\x80\x99ve not left it yet\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with extreme eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought I may do some good by staying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed but half content with this answer; nevertheless he said in a\r\nmoment: \xe2\x80\x9cTo me it makes all the difference. And if anything of the kind\r\nyou speak of should happen, that would be only the greater reason for\r\nyour staying.\xe2\x80\x94You might interpose, you might arrest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped short\r\nbefore her large Germanic grimace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have been in Rome more than once when the Tiber had\r\noverflowed, _\xc3\xa8 vero_? What would you have thought then if you had heard\r\npeople telling the poor wretches in the Ghetto, on the Ripetta, up to\r\ntheir knees in liquid mud, that they ought to interpose, to arrest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Capisco bene_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, dropping his eyes. He appeared to\r\nhave closed them, for some moments, as if under a slow spasm of pain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what torments me most,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently went on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nthought that sometimes makes my heart rise into my mouth. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nhaunting fear.\xe2\x80\x9d And his pale face and disturbed respiration might\r\nindeed have been those of a man before whom some horrible spectre had\r\nrisen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. I know what you mean, my poor friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think then there _is_ a danger\xe2\x80\x94that she\xe2\x80\x99ll drag my name, do\r\nwhat no one has ever dared to do? That I\xe2\x80\x99d never forgive,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared\r\nalmost under his breath; and the hoarseness of his whisper lent it a\r\ngreat effect.\r\n\r\nMadame Grandoni hastily wondered if she had not better tell him (as it\r\nwould prepare him for the worst) that his wife cared about as much for\r\nhis name as for any old label on her luggage; but after an instant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreflexion she reserved this information for another hour. Besides, as\r\nshe said to herself, the Prince ought already to know perfectly to what\r\nextent Christina attached the idea of an obligation or an interdict to\r\nher ill-starred connexion with an ignorant and superstitious Italian\r\nrace whom she despised for their provinciality, their parsimony and\r\ntheir futility (she thought their talk the climax of childishness)\r\nand whose fatuous conception of their importance in the great modern\r\nworld she had on various public occasions sufficiently riddled with her\r\nderision. She finally contented herself with remarking: \xe2\x80\x9cDear Prince,\r\nyour wife\xe2\x80\x99s a very proud woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, how could my wife be anything else? But her pride\xe2\x80\x99s not my pride.\r\nAnd she has such ideas; such opinions! Some of them are monstrous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Grandoni smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think it so necessary to have them\r\nwhen you\xe2\x80\x99re not there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy then do you say that you enter into my fears\xe2\x80\x94that you recognise\r\nthe stories I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI know not whether the good lady lost patience with his pressure;\r\nat all events she broke out with a certain sharpness. \xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand\r\nthis, understand this: Christina will never consider you\xe2\x80\x94your name,\r\nyour illustrious traditions\xe2\x80\x94in any case in which she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t consider\r\nherself much more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince appeared to study for a moment this somewhat ambiguous yet\r\nportentous phrase; then he slowly got up with his hat in his hand and\r\nwalked about the room softly, solemnly, as if suffering from his long\r\nthin feet. He stopped before one of the windows and took another survey\r\nof South Street; then turning he suddenly asked in a voice into which\r\nhe had evidently endeavoured to infuse a colder curiosity: \xe2\x80\x9cIs she\r\nadmired in this place? Does she see many people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s thought very strange of course. But she sees whom she likes. And\r\nthey mostly bore her to death!\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni conscientiously added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy then do you tell me this country pleases her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman left her place. She had promised Christina, who detested\r\nthe sense of being under the same roof with her husband, that the\r\nlatter\xe2\x80\x99s visit should be kept within narrow limits; and this movement\r\nwas intended to signify as kindly as possible that it had better\r\nterminate. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the common people who please her,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned with\r\nher hands folded on her crumpled satin stomach and her ancient eyes,\r\nstill keen for all comedy, raised to his face. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the lower orders,\r\nthe _basso popolo_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _basso popolo_?\xe2\x80\x9d The Prince stared at this fantastic announcement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _povera gente_,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued his friend, amused at his dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe London mob\xe2\x80\x94the most horrible, the most brutal\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she wishes to raise them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, something like that\xe2\x80\x99s no more than I had heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nPrince gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Che vuole?_ Don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself; it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Grandoni saw this comforting assurance lost upon him; his\r\nface was turned to the door of the room, which had been thrown open,\r\nand all his attention given to the person who crossed the threshold.\r\nShe transferred her own to the same quarter and recognised the\r\nlittle artisan whom Christina had, in a manner so extraordinary and\r\nso profoundly characteristic, drawn into her box that night at the\r\ntheatre\xe2\x80\x94afterwards informing her old friend that she had sent for him\r\nto come and see her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Robinson!\xe2\x80\x9d the butler, who had had a lesson, announced in a loud\r\ncolourless tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be for long,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Grandoni repeated for the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbenefit; but it was to Mr. Robinson the words had the air of being\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\nHyacinth stood, while she signalled to the servant to leave the door\r\nopen and wait, looking from the queer old lady, who was as queer as\r\nbefore, to the tall foreign gentleman (he recognised his foreignness at\r\na glance) whose eyes seemed to challenge him, to devour him; wondering\r\nif he had made some mistake and needing to remind himself that he had\r\nthe Princess\xe2\x80\x99s note in his pocket, with the day and hour as clear as\r\nher magnificent script could make them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, good-morning. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Grandoni\r\nwith quick friendliness, but turning her back upon him at the same time\r\nin order to ask of their companion, in the other idiom, as she extended\r\nher hand: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you leave London soon\xe2\x80\x94in a day or two?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince made no answer; he still scanned the little bookbinder\r\nfrom head to foot, as if wondering who the deuce he could be. His\r\neyes seemed to Hyacinth to search for the small neat bundle he ought\r\nto have had under his arm and without which he was incomplete. To the\r\nreader, however, it may be confided that, dressed more carefully than\r\nhe had ever been in his life before, stamped with that extraordinary\r\ntransformation which the British Sunday often operates in the person\r\nof the wage-earning cockney, with his handsome head uncovered and\r\nthe heat of wonder in his fine face, the young man from Lomax Place\r\nmight have passed for anything rather than a carrier of parcels. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nPrincess wrote to me, madam, to come and see her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as a prompt\r\nprecaution; in case he should have incurred the reproach of undue\r\nprecipitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I daresay.\xe2\x80\x9d And Madame Grandoni guided the Prince to the door\r\nwith an expression of the desire he might have a comfortable journey\r\nback to Italy.\r\n\r\nBut he stood stiff there; he appeared to have jumped to a dark\r\nconclusion about Mr. Robinson. \xe2\x80\x9cI must see you once more. I must. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpossible\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well, not in this house, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you do me the honour to meet me then?\xe2\x80\x9d And as the old lady\r\nhesitated he added with sudden intensity: \xe2\x80\x9cDearest friend, I beg you on\r\nmy knees!\xe2\x80\x9d After she had agreed that if he would write to her proposing\r\na day and place she would see him were it possible, he raised her\r\nancient knuckles to his lips and, without further notice of Hyacinth,\r\nturned away. She bade the servant announce the other visitor to the\r\nPrincess, and then approached Mr. Robinson, rubbing her hands and\r\nsmiling, her head very much to one side. He smiled back at her vaguely;\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what she might be going to say. What she said was, to\r\nhis surprise\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor young man, may I take the liberty of asking your age?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, madam; I\xe2\x80\x99m twenty-four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re industrious, and temperate in all ways and\xe2\x80\x94what do\r\nyou call it in English?\xe2\x80\x94steady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m very wild,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth without offence. He\r\nthought the old woman patronising, but he forgave her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how one speaks in this country to young men like you.\r\nPerhaps one\xe2\x80\x99s considered meddling or impertinent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like the way you speak,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth hastened to profess.\r\n\r\nShe stared, and then with a comical affectation of dignity: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nvery good. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad it amuses you. You\xe2\x80\x99re evidently intelligent and\r\nclever,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand if you\xe2\x80\x99re disappointed it will be a pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean if I\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I daresay you expect great things when you come into a house\r\nlike this. You must tell me if I upset you. I\xe2\x80\x99m very old-fashioned and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not of this country. I speak as one speaks to young men like you in\r\nother places.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not so easily upset!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth assured her with a flight of\r\nimagination. \xe2\x80\x9cTo expect anything one must know something, one must\r\nunderstand: isn\xe2\x80\x99t it so? And I\xe2\x80\x99m here without knowing, without\r\nunderstanding. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come only because a lady who seems to me very\r\nbeautiful and very kind has done me the honour to send for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Grandoni examined him a moment as if struck by his good looks,\r\nby something delicate stamped on him everywhere. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see you\xe2\x80\x99re very\r\nclever, very intelligent; no, you\xe2\x80\x99re not like the young men I mean. All\r\nthe more reason\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d And she paused, giving a short sigh. Her case might\r\nhave been all too difficult. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to warn you a little, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how. If you were a young Roman it would be different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young Roman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where I live properly, in the Eternal City. If I hurt you, you\r\ncan explain it that way. No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not like them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me\xe2\x80\x94please believe that; you interest me very much,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Hyacinth, to whom it didn\xe2\x80\x99t occur that he himself might seem\r\npatronising. \xe2\x80\x9cOf what do you want to warn me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94only to advise you a little. Don\xe2\x80\x99t give up anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I give up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t give up _yourself_. I say that to you in your interest. I think\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve some honest little trade\xe2\x80\x94I forget what. But whatever it may\r\nbe remember that to do it well is the best thing; better than paying\r\nextraordinary visits, better even than being liked by Princesses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes, I see what you mean!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth returned, exaggerating a\r\nlittle. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of my trade indeed, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to hear it. Hold fast to it then and be quiet; be\r\ndiligent and good and get on. I gathered the other night that you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\none of the young men who want everything changed\xe2\x80\x94I believe there are a\r\ngreat many in Italy and also in my own dear old Deutschland, and who\r\neven think it useful to throw bombs into innocent crowds and shoot\r\npistols at their rulers or at any one. I won\xe2\x80\x99t go into that. I might\r\nseem to be speaking for myself, and the fact is that for myself I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare; I\xe2\x80\x99m so old that I may hope to spend the few days that are left me\r\nwithout receiving a bullet. But before you go any further please think\r\na little whether you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t just that you should impute to me ideas which I may not\r\nhave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth, turning very red but taking more and more of a\r\nfancy, all the same, to Madame Grandoni. \xe2\x80\x9cYou talk at your ease about\r\nour ways and means, but if we were only to make use of those that you\r\nwould like to see\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d And while he blushed, smiling, the young man shook\r\nhis head two or three times with great significance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to see any!\xe2\x80\x9d the old lady cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI like people to\r\nbear their troubles as one has done one\xe2\x80\x99s self. And as for injustice,\r\nyou see how kind I am to you when I say to you again, Don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\ngive anything up. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them to send you some tea,\xe2\x80\x9d she added as\r\nshe took her way out of the room, presenting to him her round, low,\r\naged back and dragging over the carpet a scanty and lustreless train.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had been warned by Mr. Vetch as to what brilliant women might do\r\nwith him\xe2\x80\x94it was only a word on the old fiddler\xe2\x80\x99s lips, but the word\r\nhad had a point; he had been warned by Paul Muniment, and now he was\r\nadmonished by a person supremely well placed for knowing: a fact that\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fail to deepen the emotion which, any time these three days,\r\nhad made him draw his breath more quickly. That emotion, nevertheless,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t actually make him fear remote consequences; as he looked\r\nover the Princess Casamassima\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room and inhaled an air that\r\nseemed to him inexpressibly delicate and sweet he hoped his adventure\r\nwould throw him on his mettle only half as much as the old lady had\r\nwished to intimate. He considered, one after the other, the different\r\nchairs, couches and ottomans the room contained\xe2\x80\x94he wished to treat\r\nhimself to the most sumptuous\xe2\x80\x94and then for reasons he knew best sank\r\ninto a seat covered with rose-coloured brocade and of which the legs\r\nand frame appeared of pure gold. Here he sat perfectly still, only\r\nwith his heart beating very sensibly and his eyes coursing again and\r\nagain from one object to another. The splendours and suggestions of\r\nCaptain Sholto\xe2\x80\x99s apartment were thrown completely into the shade by\r\nthe scene before him, and as the Princess didn\xe2\x80\x99t scruple to keep him\r\nwaiting twenty minutes (during which the butler came in and set out\r\non a small table a glittering tea-service) Hyacinth had time to count\r\nover the innumerable _bibelots_ (most of which he had never dreamed of)\r\ninvolved in the character of a woman of high fashion and to feel that\r\ntheir beauty and oddity revealed not only whole provinces of art, but\r\nrefinements of choice on the part of their owner, complications of mind\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94almost\xe2\x80\x94terrible depths of temperament.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the door opened and the servant, reappearing, threw it\r\nfar back as to make a wide passage for a person of the importance of\r\nhis mistress, Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s suspense became very acute; it was much the\r\nsame feeling with which, at the theatre, he had sometimes awaited\r\nthe entrance of a celebrated actress. In this case the actress was to\r\nperform for him alone. There was still a moment before she came on, and\r\nwhen she arrived she was so simply dressed\xe2\x80\x94besides his seeing her now\r\non her feet\xe2\x80\x94that she looked quite a different figure. She approached\r\nhim rapidly and a little stiffly and shyly, but in the prompt manner\r\nin which she shook hands was an evident desire to be very direct and\r\nperfectly easy. She might have been another person, but that person\r\nhad a beauty even more radiant; the fairness of her face shone forth at\r\nour young man as if to dissipate any doubts assailing and bewildering\r\nhim as to the reality of the vision bequeathed to him by his former\r\ninterview. And in this peculiar high grace of her presence he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave told you if she struck him as more proud or more kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve kept you a long time, but it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed not usually to be a\r\nbad place, my salon; there are various things to look at and perhaps\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed some of them. Over on that side for instance is rather\r\na curious collection of miniatures.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke abruptly, quickly, as\r\nif conscious that their communion might be awkward and she were trying\r\nto strike instantly (to conjure that element away) the sort of note\r\nthat would make them both most comfortable. Quickly too she sat down\r\nbefore her tea-tray and poured him out a cup, which she handed him\r\nwithout asking if he would have it. He accepted it with a trembling\r\nhand, though he had no desire for it; he was too nervous to swallow\r\nthe tea, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have appeared to him possible to decline. When\r\nhe had murmured that he had indeed looked at all her things, but that\r\nit would take hours to do justice to such treasures, she asked if he\r\nwere fond of works of art; immediately adding, however, that she was\r\nafraid he had not many opportunities of seeing them, though of course\r\nthere were the public collections, open to all. He replied with perfect\r\nveracity that some of the happiest moments of his life had been spent\r\nat the British Museum and the National Gallery, and this fact appeared\r\nto interest her greatly, so that she straightway begged him to tell her\r\nwhat he thought of certain pictures and antiques. In this way it was\r\nthat in an incredibly short time, as appeared to him, he found himself\r\ndiscussing the Bacchus and Ariadne and the Elgin Marbles with one\r\nof the most remarkable women in Europe. It was true that she herself\r\ntalked most, passing precipitately from one point to another, putting\r\nquestions and not waiting for answers, describing and qualifying\r\nthings, expressing feelings, by the aid of phrases that he had never\r\nheard before but which seemed to him illuminating and happy\xe2\x80\x94as when\r\nfor instance she asked what art was, after all, but a synthesis made\r\nin the interest of pleasure, or said that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like England in\r\nthe least, but absurdly loved it. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t occur to him to think these\r\ndiscriminations pedantic. Suddenly she threw off, \xe2\x80\x9cMadame Grandoni told\r\nme you saw my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, was the gentleman your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately! What do you think of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth decently pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t either! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him for nearly three years.\r\nHe wanted to see me to-day, but I refused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the young man stared, not knowing how he ought to receive so\r\nunexpected a confidence. Then as the suggestions of inexperience are\r\nsometimes the happiest of all he spoke simply what was in his mind and\r\nsaid gently: \xe2\x80\x9cIt has made you\xe2\x80\x94naturally\xe2\x80\x94nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d Later on, when he had\r\nleft the house, he wondered how at that stage he could have ventured on\r\nsuch a familiar remark.\r\n\r\nBut she had taken it with a quick, surprised laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d Before he had time to tell she added: \xe2\x80\x9cYour saying that\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94shows me how right I was to ask you to come to see me. You know I\r\nhesitated. It shows me you\xe2\x80\x99ve perceptions; I guessed as much the other\r\nnight at the theatre. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have asked you. I may be\r\nwrong, but I like people who understand what one says to them, and also\r\nwhat one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think I understand too much. You might easily exaggerate that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHyacinth declared conscientiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou confirm completely my first impression,\xe2\x80\x9d the Princess returned,\r\nsmiling in a way that showed him he really amused her. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall\r\ndiscover the limits of your comprehension! I am atrociously nervous.\r\nBut it will pass. How\xe2\x80\x99s your cousin the dressmaker?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired\r\nabruptly. And when Hyacinth had briefly given some account of poor\r\nPinnie\xe2\x80\x94described her as tolerably well for her, but old and tired\r\nand sad and not very successful\xe2\x80\x94she exclaimed impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, well,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s not the only one!\xe2\x80\x9d and came back with irrelevance to the former\r\nquestion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not only my husband\xe2\x80\x99s visit\xe2\x80\x94absolutely unexpected!\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nhas made me fidgety, but the idea that now you\xe2\x80\x99ve been so kind as to\r\ncome here you may wonder why, after all, I made such a point of it,\r\nand even think any explanation I might be able to give you entirely\r\ninsufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any explanation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyacinth with a sense of great\r\npresence of mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s charming of you to say that, and I shall take you at your word.\r\nExplanations usually make things worse. All the same I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you\r\nto think (as you might have done so easily the other evening) that I\r\nwish only to treat you as a curious animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care how you treat me!\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable silence, after which she pursued: \xe2\x80\x9cAll I ask\r\nof my husband is to let me alone. But he won\xe2\x80\x99t. He won\xe2\x80\x99t return my\r\nindifference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth wondered what reply he ought to make to such an announcement\r\nas that, and it seemed to him the least civility demanded was that he\r\nshould say\xe2\x80\x94as he could with such conviction\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be easy to be\r\nindifferent to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not if I\xe2\x80\x99m odious? I _can_ be\xe2\x80\x94oh there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt of that!\r\nHowever, I can honestly say that with the Prince I\xe2\x80\x99ve been exceedingly\r\nreasonable and that most of the wrongs\xe2\x80\x94the big ones, those that\r\nsettled the question\xe2\x80\x94have been on his side. You may tell me of course\r\nthat that\xe2\x80\x99s the pretension of every woman who has made a mess of her\r\nmarriage. But ask Madame Grandoni.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me it\xe2\x80\x99s none of my business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true\xe2\x80\x94she might!\xe2\x80\x9d the Princess inconsequently laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know either why I should bore you with my domestic affairs;\r\nexcept that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wondering what I could do to show you confidence\r\nin return for your showing so much in me. As this matter of my\r\nseparation from my husband happens to have been turned uppermost by his\r\nsudden descent on me I just mention it, though the subject\xe2\x80\x99s tiresome\r\nenough. Moreover, I ought to let you know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve very little respect\r\nfor distinctions of class\xe2\x80\x94the sort of thing they make so much of in\r\nthis country. They\xe2\x80\x99re doubtless convenient in some ways, but when one\r\nhas a reason\xe2\x80\x94a reason of feeling\xe2\x80\x94for overstepping them, and one allows\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s self to be deterred by some dreary superstition about one\xe2\x80\x99s place\r\nor some one else\xe2\x80\x99s place, then I think it\xe2\x80\x99s ignoble. It always belongs\r\nto one\xe2\x80\x99s place not to be a poor creature. I take it that if you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na socialist you think about this as I do; but lest by chance, as the\r\nsense of those differences is the English religion, it may have rubbed\r\noff even on you (though I\xe2\x80\x99m more and more impressed with the fact that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re scarcely more British than I am): lest you should in spite of\r\nyour theoretic democracy be shocked at some of the applications that\r\nI, who cherish the creed, am capable of making of it, let me assure\r\nyou without delay that in that case we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get on together at\r\nall and had better part company before we go further.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused long\r\nenough for Hyacinth to declare with a great deal of emphasis that he\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t easily shocked; and then restlessly, eagerly, as if it relieved\r\nher to talk and made their queer conjunction less abnormal that she\r\nshould talk most, she arrived at the point that she wanted to know\r\nthe _people_, and know them intimately\xe2\x80\x94the toilers and strugglers and\r\nsufferers\xe2\x80\x94because she was convinced they were the most interesting\r\nportion of society, and at the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could really be in worse\r\ntaste than for me to carry into such an undertaking a pretension of\r\ngreater delicacy and finer manners? If I must do that,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s simpler to leave them alone. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t leave them alone; they\r\npress on me, they haunt me, they fascinate me. There it is\xe2\x80\x94after all\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s very simple: I want to know them and I want you to help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you with pleasure to the best of my humble ability. But\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be awfully disappointed,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth said. Very strange it seemed\r\nto him that within so few days two ladies of rank should have found\r\noccasion to express to him the same mysterious longing. A breeze\r\nfrom a thoroughly unexpected quarter was indeed blowing through the\r\naristocracy. Nevertheless, though there was much of the same accent\r\nof passion in the Princess Casamassima\xe2\x80\x99s communication that there\r\nhad been in Lady Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s, and though he felt bound to discourage his\r\npresent interlocutress as he had done the other, the force that drove\r\nher struck him as a very different mixture from the shy, conscientious,\r\nanxious heresies of Rose Muniment\xe2\x80\x99s friend. The temper varied in the\r\ntwo women as much as the aspect and the address, and that perhaps made\r\ntheir curiosity the more significant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x9d this investigator answered; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing in life in which I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been awfully disappointed. But\r\ndisappointment for disappointment I shall like it better than some\r\nothers. You\xe2\x80\x99ll not persuade me either that among the people I speak\r\nof characters and passions and motives are not more natural, more\r\ncomplete, more _na\xc3\xaffs_. The upper classes are so deadly _banals_.\r\nMy husband traces his descent from the fifth century, and he\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ngreatest bore in Europe. That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of people I was condemned to\r\nby my marriage. Oh, if you knew what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been through you\xe2\x80\x99d allow\r\nthat intelligent mechanics (of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know idiots)\r\nwould be a pleasant change. I must begin with some one\xe2\x80\x94mustn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x94so I\r\nbegan the other night with you!\xe2\x80\x9d As soon as she had uttered these words\r\nthe Princess added a correction with the consciousness of her mistake\r\nin her face. It made that face, to Hyacinth, more nobly, tenderly\r\nbeautiful. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only objection to you individually is that you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnothing of the people about you\xe2\x80\x94to-day not even the dress.\xe2\x80\x9d Her eyes\r\nwandered over him from head to foot, and their recognitions made him\r\nashamed. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had come in the clothes you wear at your work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see you do regard me as a curious animal,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps to contradict this that, after a moment, she began\r\nto tell him more about her domestic affairs. He ought to know who\r\nshe was, unless Captain Sholto had told him; and she mentioned her\r\nparentage\xe2\x80\x94American on the mother\xe2\x80\x99s side, Italian on the father\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhow she had led from her youngest years a wandering Bohemian life in\r\na thousand different places (always in Europe, she had never been in\r\nAmerica and knew very little about it, though she wanted greatly to\r\ncross the Atlantic) and largely at one period in Rome. She had been\r\nmarried by her people, in a mercenary way, for the sake of a fortune\r\nand a great name, and it had turned out as badly as her worst enemy\r\ncould have wished. Her parents were dead, luckily for them, and she had\r\nno one near her of her own except Madame Grandoni, who belonged to her\r\nonly in the sense that she had known her as a girl; was an association\r\nof her\xe2\x80\x94what should she call them?\xe2\x80\x94her uneasy but innocent years. Not\r\nthat she had ever been very innocent; she had had a horrible education.\r\nHowever, she had known a few good people\xe2\x80\x94people she respected then;\r\nbut Madame Grandoni was the only one who had stuck to her. She too was\r\nliable to leave her any day; the Princess appeared to intimate that her\r\ndestiny might require her to take some step which would test severely\r\nthe old woman\xe2\x80\x99s attachment. It would detain her too long to make him\r\nunderstand the stages by which she had arrived at her present state of\r\nmind: her disgust with a thousand social arrangements, her rebellion\r\nagainst the selfishness, the corruption, the iniquity, the cruelty,\r\nthe imbecility of the people who all over Europe had the upper hand.\r\nIf he could have seen her life, the _milieu_ in which she had for\r\nseveral years been condemned to move, the evolution of her opinions\r\n(Hyacinth was delighted to hear her use that term) would strike him\r\nas perfectly logical. She had been humiliated, outraged, tortured; she\r\nconsidered that she too was one of the numerous class who could be put\r\non a tolerable footing only by a revolution. At any rate she had some\r\nself-respect left, and there was still more that she wanted to recover;\r\nthe only way to arrive at which was to throw herself into some effort\r\nthat would make her forget her own affairs and comprehend the troubles\r\nand efforts of others. Hyacinth listened to her with a wonderment\r\nwhich, as she went on, was transformed into willing submission; she\r\nseemed so natural, so vivid, so exquisitely generous and sincere. By\r\nthe time he had been with her half an hour she had made the situation\r\nitself easy and usual, and a third person who should have joined them\r\nat this moment would have noticed nothing to suggest that friendly\r\nsocial intercourse between little bookbinders and Neapolitan princesses\r\nwas not in London a matter of daily occurrence.\r\n\r\nHyacinth had seen plenty of women who chattered about themselves and\r\ntheir affairs\xe2\x80\x94a vulgar garrulity of confidence was indeed a leading\r\ncharacteristic of the sex as he had hitherto learned to know it\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nhe was quick to perceive that the great lady who now took the trouble\r\nto open herself to him was not of a gossiping habit; that she must be\r\non the contrary, as a general thing, proudly, ironically reserved,\r\neven to the point of passing with many people for a model of the\r\nunsatisfactory. It was very possible she was capricious; yet the fact\r\nthat her present sympathies and curiosities might be a caprice wore\r\nin her visitor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes no sinister aspect. Why was it not a noble and\r\ninteresting whim, and why mightn\xe2\x80\x99t he stand for the hour at any rate\r\nin the silvery moonshine it cast on his path? It must be added that he\r\nwas far from taking in everything she said, some of her allusions and\r\nimplications being so difficult to seize that they mainly served to\r\nreveal to him the limits of his own acquaintance with life. Her words\r\nevoked all sorts of shadowy suggestions of things he was condemned not\r\nto know, touching him most when he had not the key to them. This was\r\nespecially the case with her reference to her career in Italy, on her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s estates, and her relations with his family, who considered\r\nthat they had done her a great honour in receiving her into their\r\naugust circle (putting the best face on a bad business) after they\r\nhad moved heaven and earth to keep her out of it. The position made\r\nfor her among such people and what she had had to suffer from their\r\nfamily tone, their opinions and customs (though what these might be\r\nremained vague to her listener) had evidently planted in her soul\r\na lasting resentment and contempt; and Hyacinth gathered that the\r\nforce of reaction and revenge might carry her far, make her modern\r\nand democratic and heretical _\xc3\xa0 outrance_\xe2\x80\x94lead her to swear by Darwin\r\nand Spencer and all the scientific iconoclasts as well as by the\r\nrevolutionary spirit. He surely needn\xe2\x80\x99t have been so sensible of the\r\nweak spots in his comprehension of the Princess when he could already\r\nsurmise that personal passion had counted for so much in the formation\r\nof her views. This induction, however, which had no harshness, didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake her affect him any the less as a creature compounded of the\r\nfinest elements; brilliant, delicate, complicated, but complicated with\r\nsomething divine.\r\n\r\nIt was not till after he had left her that he became conscious she\r\nhad forced him to talk in spite of talking so much herself. He drew\r\na long breath as he reflected that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made quite such an ass\r\nof himself as might very well have happened; he had been saved by\r\nthe thrill of his interest and admiration, which had not gone to his\r\nhead and prompted him to show that he too in his improbable little\r\nway was remarkable, but had kept him in a state of anxious, conscious\r\ntension, as if the occasion had been a great appointed solemnity,\r\nsome initiation more formal than any he believed practised even in the\r\ngrimmest subterranean circles. He had said indeed much more than he had\r\nwarrant for when she questioned him on his \xe2\x80\x9cradical\xe2\x80\x9d affiliations; he\r\nhad spoken as if the movement were vast and mature, whereas in fact, so\r\nfar at least as he was as yet concerned with it and could answer for it\r\nfrom personal knowledge, it was circumscribed by the hideously-papered\r\nwalls of the little club-room at the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon.\xe2\x80\x9d He reproached\r\nhimself with this laxity, but it had not been engendered by pride. He\r\nwas only afraid of disappointing his hostess too much, of making her\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy in the world then did you come to see me if you\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing\r\nmore remarkable to put before me?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a question to which of course he\r\nwould have had an answer ready but for its being so impossible to say\r\nhe had never asked to come and that his coming was her own affair. He\r\nwanted too much to come a second time to have the courage to make that\r\nspeech. Nevertheless when she exclaimed, changing the subject abruptly,\r\nas she always did, from something else they had been talking about,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if I shall ever see you again!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied with perfect\r\nsincerity that it was scarce possible for him to believe anything so\r\ndelightful could be repeated. There were some kinds of happiness that\r\nto many people never came at all, and to others could come only once.\r\nHe added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very true I had just that feeling after I left you the\r\nother night at the theatre. And yet here I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Princess thoughtfully\xe2\x80\x94as if this might\r\nbe a still graver and more embarrassing fact than she had yet supposed\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cI take it there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing essentially inconceivable in my seeing\r\nyou again; but it may very well be that you\xe2\x80\x99ll never again find it\r\nso pleasant. Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s the happiness that comes but once. At any\r\nrate, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m going away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, of course; every one leaves town\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth rose to that\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo _you_, Mr. Robinson?\xe2\x80\x9d the Princess asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t as a general thing. Nevertheless it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that this\r\nyear I may get three or four days at the seaside. I should like to take\r\nmy old lady. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd except for that shall you be always at work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but you must understand that I love my work. You must understand\r\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s a great blessing for a young fellow like me to have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it what would you do? Should you starve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should starve,\xe2\x80\x9d our friend replied judicially.\r\n\r\nShe looked a little chagrined, but after a moment pursued: \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder\r\nwhether you\xe2\x80\x99d come to see me in the country somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh cracky!\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth exclaimed, catching his breath. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so kind\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be _banal_, please. That\xe2\x80\x99s what other people are. What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nuse of my looking for something fresh in other walks of life if you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngoing to be _banal_ too? I ask if you\xe2\x80\x99d come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said at this moment whether he were plunging or\r\nsoaring. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d come. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know at all how I should do\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94there would be several obstacles; but wherever you should call for\r\nme I\xe2\x80\x99d come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you can\xe2\x80\x99t leave your work like that? You might lose it if you\r\ndid, and then be in want of money and much embarrassed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there would be little difficulties of that kind. You see that\r\nimmediately, in practice, great obstacles and complications come up\r\nwhen it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of a person like you making friends with a person\r\nlike me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way I like you to talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Princess with a pitying\r\ngentleness that struck her visitor as quite sacred. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow where I shall be. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to pay stupid visits myself, visits\r\nwhere the only comfort will be that I shall make the people jump.\r\nEvery one here thinks me exceedingly odd\xe2\x80\x94as there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt I am!\r\nI might be ever so much more so if you\xe2\x80\x99d only help me a little. Why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I have my bookbinder after all? In attendance, you know\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwould be awfully _chic_. We might have immense fun, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\r\nNo doubt it will come. At any rate I shall return to London when I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot through that _corv\xc3\xa9e_; I shall be here next year. In the meantime\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t forget me,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on as she rose to her feet. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember on\r\nthe contrary that I expect you to take me into the slums\xe2\x80\x94into very bad\r\nplaces.\xe2\x80\x9d Why the idea of these scenes of misery should have lighted\r\nup her face is more than may be explained; but she smiled down at\r\nHyacinth\xe2\x80\x94who even as he stood up was of slightly smaller stature\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nall her strange high radiance. Then in a manner almost equally\r\nquaint she added a reference to what she had said a moment before. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nrecognise perfectly the obstacles in practice as you call them; but\r\nthough I\xe2\x80\x99m not by nature persevering, and am really very easily put\r\noff, I don\xe2\x80\x99t consider they\xe2\x80\x99ll prove insurmountable. They exist on my\r\nside as well, and if you\xe2\x80\x99ll help me to overcome mine I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the same\r\nfor you with yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words, repeating themselves again and again in his consciousness,\r\nappeared to give him wings, to help him to float and soar as he turned\r\nthat afternoon out of South Street. He had at home a copy of Tennyson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npoems\xe2\x80\x94a single comprehensive volume, with a double column on the page,\r\nin a tolerably neat condition despite much handling. He took it to\r\npieces that same evening, and during the following week, in his hours\r\nof leisure, at home in his little room, with the tools he kept there\r\nfor private use and a morsel of delicate, blue-tinted Russia leather\r\nof which he obtained possession at old Crook\xe2\x80\x99s, he devoted himself to\r\nthe task of binding the book as perfectly as he knew how. He worked\r\nwith passion, with religion, and produced a masterpiece of firmness\r\nand finish, of which his own appreciation was as high as that of M.\r\nPoupin when at the end of the week he exhibited to him the fruit of his\r\ntoil, and much more freely expressed than that of old Crook himself,\r\nwho grunted approbation but was always too long-headed to create\r\nprecedents. Hyacinth carried the volume to South Street as an offering\r\nto the Princess, hoping she would not yet have left London; in which\r\ncase he would ask the servant to deliver it to her along with a little\r\nnote he had sat up all night to compose. But the majestic major-domo\r\nin charge of the house, opening the door yet looking down at him as\r\nif from a second-story window, took the life out of his vision and\r\nerected instead of it, by a touch, a high blank wall. The Princess had\r\nbeen absent for some days; her representative was so good as to inform\r\nthe young man with the parcel that she was on a visit to a \xe2\x80\x9cJuke\xe2\x80\x9d in a\r\ndistant part of the country. He offered, however, to receive and even\r\nto forward anything Hyacinth might wish to leave; but our hero felt\r\na sudden indisposition to launch his humble tribute into the vast,\r\nthe possibly cold unknown of a \xe2\x80\x9cjucal\xe2\x80\x9d circle. He decided to retain\r\nhis little package for the present; he would offer it to her when he\r\nshould see her again, and he retreated without giving it up. Later on\r\nit seemed to create a manner of material link between the Princess and\r\nhimself, and at the end of three months it had almost come to appear\r\nnot that the exquisite book was an intended present from his own hand,\r\nbut that it had been placed in that hand by the most remarkable woman\r\nin Europe. Rare sensations and impressions, moments of acute happiness,\r\nalmost always, with our young man, in retrospect, became rather mythic\r\nand legendary; and the superior piece of work he had done after seeing\r\nher last, in the immediate heat of his emotion, turned to a virtual\r\nproof and gage\xe2\x80\x94as if a ghost in vanishing from sight had left a\r\npalpable relic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe matter touched him but indirectly, yet it may concern the reader\r\nmore closely to know that before the visit to the Duke took place\r\nMadame Grandoni granted to Prince Casamassima the private interview\r\nshe had promised him on that sad Sunday afternoon. She crept out\r\nof South Street after breakfast\xe2\x80\x94a repast which under the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroof was served in the foreign fashion at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94crossed the\r\nsultry solitude into which at such a season that precinct resolves\r\nitself, and entered the Park, where the grass was already brown and a\r\nwarm, smoky haze prevailed, a tepid and tasteless _r\xc3\xa9chauff\xc3\xa9_, as it\r\nstruck our old friend, of the typical London fog. The Prince met her\r\nby appointment at the gate and they went and sat down together under\r\nthe trees beside the drive, amid a wilderness of empty chairs and with\r\nnothing to distract their attention from an equestrian or two left over\r\nfrom the cavalcades of a fortnight before and whose vain agitation in\r\nthe saddle the desolate scene threw into high relief. They remained\r\nthere nearly an hour, though Madame Grandoni, in spite of her leaning\r\nto friendly interpretations, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told herself what comfort\r\nit was to her afflicted companion. She had nothing to say to him that\r\ncould better his case as he bent his mournful gaze on a prospect not\r\nafter all perceptibly improved by its not being Sunday, and could only\r\nfeel that with her he must seem to himself to be nearer his wife\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nbe touching something she had touched. She wished he would resign\r\nhimself more, but she was willing to minister to that thin illusion,\r\nlittle as she approved of the manner in which he had conducted himself\r\nat the time of the last sharp crisis in the remarkable history of his\r\nrelations with Christina. He had conducted himself after the fashion of\r\na spoiled child, a child with a bad little nature, in a rage; he had\r\nbeen fatally wanting in dignity and wisdom and had given the Princess\r\nan advantage which she took on the spot and would keep for ever. He had\r\nacted without manly judgement, had put his uncles upon her (as if she\r\ncared for his uncles, powerful prelate as one of them might be!), had\r\nbeen suspicious and jealous on exactly the wrong occasions\xe2\x80\x94occasions as\r\nto which her resentment of it had been just and in particular had been\r\nshowy. He had not been clever enough or strong enough to make good his\r\nvalid rights, and had transferred the whole quarrel to ground where his\r\nwife was far too accomplished a combatant not to obtain the appearance\r\nof victory.\r\n\r\nThere was another reflexion for Madame Grandoni to make as her\r\ninterview with her dejected friend prolonged itself. She could make it\r\nthe more freely as, besides being naturally quick and appreciative, she\r\nhad always, during her Roman career, in the dear old days (mixed with\r\nbitterness as they had been for her) lived with artists, arch\xc3\xa6ologists,\r\ningenious strangers, people who abounded in good talk, threw out ideas\r\nand played with them. It came over her that really, even if things\r\nhad not reached that particular crisis, Christina\xe2\x80\x99s active, various,\r\nironical mind, with all its audacities and impatiences, could not have\r\ntolerated long the simple deadly dulness of the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s company. The\r\nold lady had begun on meeting him: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course what you want to know at\r\nonce is whether she has sent you a message. No, my poor friend, I must\r\ntell you the truth. I asked her for one, but she assures me she has\r\nnothing whatever, of any kind, to say to you. She knew I was coming out\r\nto see you\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done so _en cachette_. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but\r\nshe accepts the necessity for this once, since you\xe2\x80\x99ve made the mistake,\r\nas she considers it, of approaching her again. We talked of you last\r\nnight after your note came to me\xe2\x80\x94for five minutes; that is, I talked in\r\nmy independent way and Christina was good enough to listen. At the end\r\nshe spoke briefly, with perfect calmness and the appearance of being\r\nthe most reasonable woman in the world. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to repeat it\r\nto you, but I do so because it\xe2\x80\x99s the only substitute I can offer you\r\nfor a message. \xe2\x80\x98I try to occupy my life, my mind, to create interests,\r\nin the odious position in which I find myself; I endeavour to get out\r\nof myself, my small personal disappointments and troubles, by the aid\r\nof such poor faculties as I possess. There are things in the world more\r\ninteresting after all, and I hope to succeed in giving my attention\r\nto them. It appears to me not too much to ask that the Prince on his\r\nside should make the same conscientious effort\xe2\x80\x94and leave me contentedly\r\nalone!\xe2\x80\x99 Those were your wife\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable words; they\xe2\x80\x99re all I have to\r\ngive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter she had given them Madame Grandoni felt a pang of regret; the\r\nPrince turned upon her a face so white, bewildered and wounded. It\r\nhad seemed to her they might form a wholesome admonition, but she now\r\nsaw that, as coming from his wife, they were cruel, and she herself\r\nfelt almost cruel for having repeated them. What they amounted to was\r\nan exquisite taunt of his mediocrity\xe2\x80\x94a mediocrity after all neither\r\na crime nor a design nor a preference. How could the Prince occupy\r\nhimself, what interests could he create and what faculties, gracious\r\nheaven, did he possess? He was as ignorant as one of the dingy London\r\nsheep browsing before them, and as contracted as his hat-band. His\r\nexpression became pitiful; it was as if he dimly measured the insult,\r\nfelt it more than saw it\xe2\x80\x94felt he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t plead incapacity without\r\nputting his wife largely in the right. He gazed at Madame Grandoni, his\r\nface worked, and for a moment she thought he was going to cry right\r\nout. But he said nothing\xe2\x80\x94perhaps because he was afraid of that\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nthat suffering silence, during which she gently laid her hand on his\r\nown, remained his sole answer. He might doubtless do so much he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthat when Christina touched on this she was unanswerable. The old lady\r\nchanged the subject: told him what a curious country England was in so\r\nmany ways; offered information as to their possible movements during\r\nthe summer and autumn, which within a day or two had taken more form.\r\nBut at last, as if he had not heard her, he broke out on the identity\r\nof the young man who had come in the day he called, just as he was\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nMadame Grandoni risked the truth. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s bookbinder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer bookbinder? Do you mean one of her lovers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince, how can you dream she\xe2\x80\x99ll ever live with you again?\xe2\x80\x9d the old\r\nlady asked in reply to this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy then does she have him in her drawing-room\xe2\x80\x94announced like an\r\nambassador, carrying a hat in his hand like mine? Where were his\r\nbooks, his bindings? I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say this to _her_,\xe2\x80\x9d he added as if the\r\ndeclaration justified him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you the other day that she\xe2\x80\x99s making studies of the people\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlower orders. The young man you saw is a study.\xe2\x80\x9d She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nlaughing out as she gave her explanation this turn; but her mirth\r\nelicited no echo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought that over\xe2\x80\x94over and over; but the more I think the less I\r\nunderstand. Would it be your idea that she\xe2\x80\x99s quite crazy? I must tell\r\nyou I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if she is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all quite crazy, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Grandoni; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the\r\nPrincess no more than the rest of us. No, she must try everything; at\r\npresent she\xe2\x80\x99s trying democracy, she\xe2\x80\x99s going all lengths in radicalism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Santo Dio!_\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do they say here when\r\nthey see the bookbinder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him and perhaps they won\xe2\x80\x99t. But if they do it won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter, because here everything\xe2\x80\x99s forgiven. That a person should be\r\nextraordinary in some way of his own\xe2\x80\x94and a woman as much as a man\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nall they want. A bookbinder will do as well as anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince mused a while. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can she bear the dirt, the bad smell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. If you mean the young man you\r\nsaw at the house\xe2\x80\x94I may tell you, by the way, that it was only the first\r\ntime he had been there and that the Princess had only seen him once\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nyou mean the little bookbinder he isn\xe2\x80\x99t dirty, especially what _we_\r\nshould call. The people of that kind here are not like our dear Romans.\r\nEvery one has a sponge as big as your head; you can see them in the\r\nshops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re full of gin; their faces are awful, are purple,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nPrince; after which he immediately asked: \xe2\x80\x9cIf she had only seen him\r\nonce how could he have come into her drawing-room that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend looked at him a little sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve at least what _I_\r\nsay, my poor friend! Never forget that this was how you spoiled your\r\naffairs most of all\xe2\x80\x94by treating a person (and such a person!) as if,\r\nas a matter of course, she lied. Christina has many faults, but she\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t that one; that\xe2\x80\x99s why I can live with her. She\xe2\x80\x99ll speak the truth\r\nalways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was plainly not agreeable to the Prince to be reminded so sharply of\r\nhis greatest mistake, and he flushed a little as Madame Grandoni spoke.\r\nBut he didn\xe2\x80\x99t admit his error and she doubted if he even saw it. At any\r\nrate he remarked rather grandly, like a man who has still a good deal\r\nto say for himself: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are things it\xe2\x80\x99s better to conceal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all depends on whether you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid. Christina never is. Oh, I\r\ngrant you she\xe2\x80\x99s very perverse, and when the entertainment of watching\r\nher, to see how she\xe2\x80\x99ll carry out some of her inspirations, is not\r\nstronger than anything else I lose all patience with her. When she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t charm she can only exasperate. But, as regards yourself, since\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re here and I mayn\xe2\x80\x99t see you again for a long time or perhaps ever\r\n(at my age\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m a hundred and twenty!) I may as well give you the key\r\nof certain parts of your wife\xe2\x80\x99s conduct. It may make her seem to you a\r\nlittle less fantastic. At the bottom then of much that she does is the\r\nfact that she\xe2\x80\x99s ashamed of having married you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLess fantastic?\xe2\x80\x9d the young man repeated, staring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may say that there can be nothing more extravagant\xe2\x80\x94as even more\r\ninsane\xe2\x80\x94than that. But you know\xe2\x80\x94or if not it isn\xe2\x80\x99t for want of her\r\nhaving told you\xe2\x80\x94how the Princess considers that in the darkest hour of\r\nher life she sold herself for a title and a fortune. She regards her\r\ndoing so as such a horrible piece of frivolity that she can\xe2\x80\x99t for the\r\nrest of her days be serious enough to make up for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know she pretends to have been forced. And does she think she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso serious now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young man you saw the other day thinks so,\xe2\x80\x9d the old woman smiled.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes she calls it by another name: she says she has thrown\r\nherself with passion into being \xe2\x80\x98modern.\xe2\x80\x99 That sums up the greatest\r\nnumber of things that you and your family are not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99re not anything of that low sort, thank God! _Dio mio, Dio\r\nmio!_\xe2\x80\x9d groaned the Prince. He seemed so exhausted by his reflexions\r\nthat he remained sitting in his chair after his companion, lifting her\r\ncrumpled corpulence out of her own, had proposed that they should walk\r\nabout a little. She had no ill-nature, but she had already noticed that\r\nwhenever she was with Christina\xe2\x80\x99s husband the current of conversation\r\nmade her, as she phrased it, bump against him. After administering\r\nthese small shocks she always steered away, and now, the Prince having\r\nat last got up and offered her his arm, she tried again to talk with\r\nhim of things he could consider without bitterness. She asked him about\r\nthe health and habits of his uncles, and he replied for the moment\r\nwith the minuteness he had been taught that in such a case courtesy\r\ndemanded; but by the time that at her request they had returned to\r\nthe gate nearest South Street (she wished him to come no further) he\r\nhad prepared a question to which she had not opened the way. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who\r\nand what then is this English captain? About him there\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal\r\nsaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis English captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGodfrey Gerald Cholto\xe2\x80\x94you see I know a good deal about him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nPrince, articulating the English names with difficulty.\r\n\r\nThey had stopped near the gate, on the edge of Park Lane, and a couple\r\nof predatory hansoms dashed at them from opposite quarters. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought\r\nthat was coming, and at bottom it\xe2\x80\x99s he who has occupied you most!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMadame Grandoni exclaimed with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in reality he\xe2\x80\x99s the last\r\none you need trouble about. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count the least little bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he count?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\xe2\x80\x94except that some people don\xe2\x80\x99t, you know. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven think he does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, when she receives him always\xe2\x80\x94lets him go wherever she goes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s just the reason. When people give her a chance to\r\nget tired of them she takes it rather easily. At any rate you needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe any more jealous of him than you are of me. He\xe2\x80\x99s a convenience, a\r\n_factotum_, but he works without wages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he then in love with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally. He has, however, no hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince lugubriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe accepts the situation better than you. He occupies himself\xe2\x80\x94as she\r\nhas strongly recommended him in my hearing to do\xe2\x80\x94with other women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the brute!\xe2\x80\x9d the Prince exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cAt all events he sees her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see _him_!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Madame Grandoni as she turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pink dressing-gown that Pinnie had engaged to make for Rose\r\nMuniment became in Lomax Place a conspicuous object, supplying\r\npoor Amanda with a constant theme for reference to one of the great\r\noccasions of her life\xe2\x80\x94her visit to Belgrave Square with Lady Aurora\r\nafter their meeting at Rosy\xe2\x80\x99s bedside. She detailed this episode\r\nminutely to her companion, repeating a thousand times that her\r\nladyship\xe2\x80\x99s affability was beyond anything she could have expected.\r\nThe grandeur of the house in Belgrave Square figured in her recital\r\nas something oppressive and fabulous, tempered though it had been by\r\nshrouds of brown holland and the nudity of staircases and saloons\r\nof which the trappings had been put away. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s so noble when\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re out of town what can it be when they\xe2\x80\x99re all there together and\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x99s out?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired suggestively; and she permitted herself\r\nto be restrictive only on two points, one of which was the state of\r\nLady Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s gloves and bonnet-strings. If she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been afraid to\r\nappear to notice the disrepair of these objects she should have been\r\nso happy to offer to do any little mending. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she\xe2\x80\x99d only come to\r\nme every week or two I\xe2\x80\x99d keep up her rank for her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pinnie, who\r\nhad visions of a needle that positively flashed in the disinterested\r\nservice of the aristocracy. She added that her ladyship got all dragged\r\nout with her long expeditions to Camberwell; she might be in tatters\r\nfor all they could do to help her, at the top of those dreadful stairs,\r\nwith that strange sick creature (she was too unnatural) thinking only\r\nof her own finery and talking about her complexion. If she wanted\r\npink she should have pink; but to Pinnie there was something almost\r\nunholy in it, like decking out a corpse or dressing up the cat. This\r\nwas the second perversity that left Miss Pynsent cold; it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nother than difficult for her to enter into the importance her ladyship\r\nappeared to attach to those pushing people. The girl was unfortunate\r\ncertainly, stuck up there like a puppy on a shelf, but in her\r\nladyship\xe2\x80\x99s place she would have found some topic more in keeping while\r\nthey walked about under those tremendous gilded ceilings. Lady Aurora,\r\nseeing how she was struck, showed her all over the house, carrying the\r\nlamp herself and telling an old woman who was there\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cconfidential\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhousekeeper, a person with ribbons in her cap who would have pushed\r\nPinnie out if you could push with your eyes\xe2\x80\x94that they would do very\r\nwell without her. If the pink dressing-gown, in its successive stages\r\nof development, filled up the little brown parlour (it was terribly\r\nlong on the stocks), making such a pervasive rose-coloured presence as\r\nhad not been seen there for many a day, this was evidently because it\r\nwas associated with Lady Aurora, not because it was dedicated to her\r\nhumble friend.\r\n\r\nOne day when Hyacinth came home Pinnie at once announced to him that\r\nher ladyship had been there to look at it\xe2\x80\x94to pass judgement before the\r\nlast touches were conferred. The dressmaker intimated that in such\r\na case as that her judgement was rather wild and she seemed to have\r\nembarrassing ideas about pockets. Whatever could poor Miss Muniment\r\nwant of pockets and what had she to put in them? But Lady Aurora had\r\nevidently found the garment far beyond anything she expected, and she\r\nhad been more affable than ever and had wanted to know about every one\r\nin the \xe2\x80\x9cPlice\xe2\x80\x9d: not in a meddling, prying way, either, like some of\r\nthose condescending swells, but quite as if the poor people were the\r\nhigh ones and she was afraid her curiosity might be \xe2\x80\x9cpresumptious.\xe2\x80\x9d It\r\nwas in the same discreet spirit that she had invited Amanda to relate\r\nher whole history and had expressed an interest in the career of her\r\nyoung friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said you had charming manners,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Pynsent hastened to remark;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut on my life, Hyacinth Robinson, I never mentioned a scrap that\r\nit could give you pain that any one should talk about.\xe2\x80\x9d There was an\r\nheroic explicitness in this, on Pinnie\xe2\x80\x99s part, for she knew in advance\r\njust how Hyacinth would look at her\xe2\x80\x94fixedly, silently, hopelessly, as\r\nif she were still capable of tattling horribly (with the idea that her\r\nrevelations would increase her importance) and putting forward this\r\nhollow theory of her supreme discretion to cover it up. His eyes seemed\r\nto say it all: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I believe you, and yet how can I prove you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlying? I\xe2\x80\x99m very helpless, for I can\xe2\x80\x99t prove that without applying to\r\nthe person to whom your incorrigible folly has probably led you to\r\nbrag, to throw out mysterious and tantalising hints. You know of course\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99d never condescend to that.\xe2\x80\x9d Pinnie suffered acutely from this\r\nimputation, yet exposed herself to it often, because she could never\r\ndeny herself the pleasure, keener still than her pain, of letting\r\nHyacinth know he was appreciated, admired and, for those \xe2\x80\x9ccharming\r\nmanners\xe2\x80\x9d commended by Lady Aurora, even all but wondered at in so many\r\nwords; and this kind of interest always appeared to imply a suspicion\r\nof his secret\xe2\x80\x94something which, when he expressed to himself the sense\r\nof it, he called, resenting it at once and finding a certain softness\r\nin it, \xe2\x80\x9ca beastly _attendrissement_.\xe2\x80\x9d When Pinnie went on to say to him\r\nthat Lady Aurora appeared to feel a certain surprise at his never yet\r\nhaving come to Belgrave Square for the famous books he reflected that\r\nhe must really wait upon her without more delay if he wished to keep up\r\nhis reputation as a man of the world; and meanwhile he considered much\r\nthe extreme oddity of this new phase of his life which had opened so\r\nsuddenly from one day to the other: a phase in which his society should\r\nhave become indispensable to ladies of high rank and the obscurity of\r\nhis condition only an attraction the more. They were taking him up then\r\none after the other and were even taking up poor Pinnie as a means of\r\ngetting at him; so that he wondered with gaiety and irony if it meant\r\nthat his destiny was really seeking him out\xe2\x80\x94that the aristocracy,\r\nrecognising a mysterious affinity (with that fineness of _flair_ for\r\nwhich they were remarkable), were coming to him to save him the trouble\r\nof coming to them.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the day (the beginning of an October evening) and Lady\r\nAurora was at home. Hyacinth had made a mental calculation of the time\r\nat which she would have risen from dinner; the operation of \xe2\x80\x9crising\r\nfrom dinner\xe2\x80\x9d having always been, in his imagination, for some reason\r\nor other, highly characteristic of the nobility. He was ignorant\r\nof the fact that Lady Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s principal meal consisted of a scrap\r\nof fish and a cup of tea served on a little stand in the dismantled\r\nbreakfast-parlour. The door was opened for Hyacinth by the invidious\r\nold lady whom Pinnie had described and who listened to his appeal,\r\nconducted him through the house and ushered him into her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence without the smallest relaxation of a pair of tightly-closed\r\nlips. His good hostess was seated in the little breakfast-parlour\r\nby the light of a couple of candles and apparently immersed in a\r\ncollection of crumpled papers and account-books. She was ciphering,\r\nconsulting memoranda, taking notes; she had had her head in her hands\r\nand the silky entanglement of her hair resisted the rapid effort she\r\nmade to smooth herself down as she saw the little bookbinder come\r\nin. The impression of her fingers remained in little rosy streaks on\r\nher pink skin. She exclaimed instantly, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve come about the\r\nbooks\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s so very kind of you\xe2\x80\x9d; and she hurried him off to another\r\nroom, to which, as she explained, she had had them brought down for\r\nhim to choose from. The effect of this precipitation was to make him\r\nsuppose at first that she might wish him to execute his errand as\r\nquickly as possible and take himself off; but he presently noted that\r\nher nervousness and her shyness were of an order that would always\r\ngive false ideas. She wanted him to stay, she wanted to talk with him\r\nand she had rushed with him at the books in order to gain time and\r\ncomposure for exercising some subtler art. Hyacinth, staying half an\r\nhour, became more and more convinced that her ladyship was, as he had\r\nventured to pronounce her on the occasion of their last meeting, a\r\nregular saint. He was privately a little disappointed in the books,\r\nthough he selected three or four, as many as he could carry, and\r\npromised to come back for others: they denoted on Lady Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s part\r\na limited acquaintance with French literature and even a certain\r\npuerility of taste. There were several volumes of Lamartine and a set\r\nof the spurious memoirs of the Marquise de Cr\xc3\xa9qui; but for the rest\r\nthe little library consisted mainly of Marmontel and Madame de Genlis,\r\n_Le R\xc3\xa9cit d\xe2\x80\x99une S\xc5\x93ur_ and the tales of M. J. T. de Saint-Germain.\r\nThere were certain members of an intensely modern school, advanced and\r\nconsistent realists of whom Hyacinth had heard and on whom he had long\r\ndesired to put his hand; but evidently none of them had ever stumbled\r\ninto Lady Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s candid collection, though she did possess a couple\r\nof Balzac\xe2\x80\x99s novels, which by ill luck happened to be just those our\r\nyoung man had read more than once.\r\n\r\nThere was nevertheless something very agreeable to him in the moments\r\nhe passed in the big, dim, cool, empty house, where, at intervals,\r\nmonumental pieces of furniture\xe2\x80\x94not crowded and miscellaneous, as he\r\nhad seen the appurtenances of the Princess\xe2\x80\x94loomed and gleamed, and\r\nLady Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic intonations awakened echoes which gave him a\r\nsense of privilege, of rioting, decently, in the absence of prohibitory\r\npresences. She spoke again of the poor people in the south of London\r\nand of the Muniments in particular; evidently the only fault she\r\nhad to find with these latter was that they were not poor enough\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nsufficiently exposed to dangers and privations against which she could\r\nstep in. Hyacinth liked her for this, even though he wished she would\r\ntalk of something else\xe2\x80\x94he hardly knew what, unless it was that, like\r\nRose Muniment, he wanted to hear more about Inglefield. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\r\nwith the poor, going into questions of their state\xe2\x80\x94it even gave him\r\nat times a strange savage satisfaction; but he saw that in discussing\r\nthem with the rich the interest must inevitably be less: the rich\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t consider poverty in the light of experience. Their mistakes\r\nand illusions, their thinking they had got hold of the sensations of\r\nwant and dirt when they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t at all, would always be more or less\r\nirritating. It came over Hyacinth that if he found this deficient\r\nperspective in Lady Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s deep conscientiousness it would be a\r\nqueer enough business when he should come to pretending to hold the\r\ncandlestick for the Princess Casamassima.\r\n\r\nHis present hostess said no word to him about Pinnie, and he guessed\r\nshe must have wished to place him on the footing on which people don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpress approbation or surprise at the decency or good-breeding of\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s relatives. He saw how she would always treat him as a\r\ngentleman and that even if he should be basely ungrateful she would\r\nnever call his attention to the fact that she had done so. He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave occasion to say to her, as he had said to the Princess, that she\r\nregarded him as a curious animal; and it gave him at once the sense\r\nof learning more about life, a sense always delightful to him, to\r\nperceive there were such different ways (which implied still a good\r\nmany more) of being a lady of rank. The manner in which Lady Aurora\r\nappeared to wish to confer with him on the great problems of pauperism\r\nand reform might have implied he was a benevolent nobleman (of the type\r\nof Lord Shaftesbury) who had endowed many charities and was noted,\r\nin philanthropic schemes, for the breadth of his views. It was not\r\nless present to him that Pinnie might have tattled, put forward his\r\nclaims to high consanguinity, than it had been when the dressmaker\r\nherself descanted on her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s condescensions; but he remembered\r\nnow that he too had only just escaped being asinine when, the other\r\nday, he flashed out an allusion to his accursed origin. At all events\r\nhe was much touched by the delicacy with which the earl\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\r\ncomported herself, simply assuming that he was \xe2\x80\x9cone of themselves\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand he reflected that if she did know his history (he was sure he might\r\npass twenty years in her society without discovering if she did) this\r\nshade of courtesy, this natural tact, coexisting even with extreme\r\nawkwardness, illustrated that \xe2\x80\x9cbest breeding\xe2\x80\x9d which he had seen alluded\r\nto in novels portraying the aristocracy. The only remark on Lady\r\nAurora\xe2\x80\x99s part that savoured in the least of looking down at him from a\r\nheight was when she said cheerfully and encouragingly: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose one\r\nof these days you\xe2\x80\x99ll be setting up in business for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d This was\r\nnot so cruelly patronising that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reply with a smile equally\r\nfree from any sort of impertinence: \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, no, I shall never do\r\nthat. I should make a great mess of any attempt to carry on a business.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve no turn at all for that sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Aurora looked a little surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see; you don\xe2\x80\x99t like\xe2\x80\x94you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d She hesitated: he saw she was going to say he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nthe idea of going in to that extent for a trade; but he stopped her in\r\ntime from imputing to him a sentiment so foolish and declared what he\r\nmeant to be simply that his one faculty was the faculty of doing his\r\nlittle piece of work, whatever it was, of liking to do it skilfully\r\nand prettily, and of liking still better to get his money for it when\r\ndone. His conception of \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d or of rising in the world didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo beyond that. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I can fancy!\xe2\x80\x9d her ladyship exclaimed; but she\r\nlooked at him a moment with eyes which showed that he puzzled her, that\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand his tone. Before he left her she asked him\r\nabruptly (nothing had led up to it) what he thought of Captain Sholto,\r\nwhom she had seen that other evening in Audley Court. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he think\r\nhim a very odd sort of person? Hyacinth confessed to this impression;\r\nwhereupon Lady Aurora went on anxiously, eagerly: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you consider\r\nhim decidedly vulgar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can know perfectly\xe2\x80\x94as well as any one!\xe2\x80\x9d Then she added: \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a pity they should form relations with any one of that kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x9d of course meant Paul Muniment and his sister. \xe2\x80\x9cWith a person\r\nwho may be vulgar?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Hyacinth regarded this solicitude as exquisite.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut think of the people they know\xe2\x80\x94think of those they\xe2\x80\x99re surrounded\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94think of all Audley Court!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor, the unhappy, the labouring classes? Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t call _them_\r\nvulgar!\xe2\x80\x9d cried her ladyship with radiant eyes. The young man, lying\r\nawake a good deal that night, laughed to himself, on his pillow, not\r\nunkindly, at her fear that he and his friends would be contaminated by\r\nthe familiar of a princess. He even wondered if she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the\r\nPrincess herself a bit vulgar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that his relations with Millicent had remained\r\nunaffected by the remarkable incident that had brushed her with its\r\nwing at the theatre. The whole occurrence had made a great impression\r\non the young lady from Pimlico; he never saw her, for weeks afterwards,\r\nthat she had not an immense deal to say about it; and though it\r\nsuited her to cultivate the shocked state at the crudity of such\r\nproceedings and to denounce the Princess for a bold-faced foreigner,\r\nof a kind to which any one who knew anything of what could go on in\r\nLondon would give a wide berth, it was easy to see she enjoyed having\r\nrubbed shoulders across the house with a person so splendid and having\r\nfound her own critical estimate of her friend confirmed in such high\r\nquarters. She professed to draw her warrant for her low opinion of\r\nthe lady in the box from information given her by Captain Sholto as\r\nhe sat beside her\xe2\x80\x94information of which at different moments she gave a\r\ndifferent version; her notes of it having nothing in common save that\r\nthey were alike unflattering to the Princess. Hyacinth had many doubts\r\nof the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s having talked indiscreetly; it would be in such a case\r\nsuch a very unnatural thing for him to do. He _was_ unnatural\xe2\x80\x94that was\r\ntrue\xe2\x80\x94and he might have told Millicent, who was capable of having plied\r\nhim with questions, that his distinguished friend was separated from\r\nher husband; but, for the rest, it was more probable that the girl\r\nhad given the rein to a fine faculty of free invention of which he had\r\nhad frequent glimpses, under pressure of her primitive half-childish,\r\nhalf-plebeian impulse of destruction, the instinct of pulling down what\r\nwas above her, the reckless energy that would, precisely, make her so\r\neffective in revolutionary scenes. Hyacinth (it has been mentioned)\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t consider that Millicent was false, and it struck him as a proof\r\nof positive candour that she should make up absurd, abusive stories\r\nabout a person as to whom she only knew that she disliked her and\r\ncould hope for no esteem, and indeed for no recognition of any kind,\r\nin return. When people were fully false you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where you\r\nstood with them, and on such a point as this Miss Henning could never\r\nbe accused of leaving you in obscurity. She said little else about the\r\nCaptain and didn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to repeat the remainder of his conversation,\r\ntaking on her air of grand indifference when Hyacinth amused himself\r\nwith repaying her criticism of his new acquaintance by drawing a\r\nsufficiently derisive portrait of hers.\r\n\r\nHis line was that Sholto\xe2\x80\x99s admiration for the high-coloured beauty\r\nin the second balcony had been at the bottom of the whole episode:\r\nhe had persuaded the Princess to pretend she was a revolutionist and\r\nshould like therefore to confer with the little firebrand above in\r\norder that he might slip into the seat of this too easily deluded\r\nyouth. At the same time it never occurred to our young man to conceal\r\nthe fact that the lady in the box had followed him up; he contented\r\nhimself with saying that this had been no part of the original plot,\r\nbut a simple result\xe2\x80\x94not unnatural after all\xe2\x80\x94of his showing so much\r\nmore charm than might have been expected. He described with sportive\r\nvariations his visit in South Street, conscious that he would never\r\nfeel the need, with his childhood\xe2\x80\x99s friend, of glossing over that sort\r\nof experience. She might make him a scene of jealousy and welcome\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwere things that would have much more terror for him than that; her\r\njealousy, with its violence, its energy, even a certain inconsequent,\r\ndare-devil humour that played through it, entertained him, emphasised\r\nthe frankness, the passion and pluck he admired her for. He should\r\nnever be on the footing of sparing Miss Henning\xe2\x80\x99s susceptibilities; how\r\nfond she might really be of him he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take upon himself to say,\r\nbut her affection would never assume the form of that sort of delicacy,\r\nand their intercourse was plainly foredoomed to be an exchange of\r\nthumps and concussions, of sarcastic shouts and mutual _d\xc3\xa9fis_. He\r\nliked her, at bottom, strangely, absurdly; but after all it was only\r\nwell enough to torment her\xe2\x80\x94she could bear so much\xe2\x80\x94not well enough to\r\nspare her. Of any actual ground for the girl\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy of the Princess\r\nhe never thought; it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t occur to him to weigh against each\r\nother the sentiments he might excite in such opposed bosoms or those\r\nthat the spectacle of either emotion might have kindled in his own.\r\nHe had no doubt his share of fatuity, but he found himself unable to\r\nassociate mentally a great lady and a bouncing shop-girl in a contest\r\nfor a prize which should have anything of _his_ figure. How could they\r\nshow the least common mark\xe2\x80\x94even so small a one as a desire to possess\r\nthemselves of Hyacinth Robinson? A fact he didn\xe2\x80\x99t impart to Millicent\r\nand could have no wish to impart to her was the different matter of his\r\npilgrimage to Belgrave Square. He might be in love with the Princess\r\n(how could he qualify as yet the bewildered emotion she had produced\r\nin him?) and he certainly never would conceive a passion for poor Lady\r\nAurora; yet it would have given him pain much greater than any he felt\r\nin the other case to hear Milly make free with the ministering angel\r\nof Audley Court. The distinction was perhaps somehow in her appearing\r\nreally not to touch or arrive at the Princess at all, whereas Lady\r\nAurora was within her range and compass.\r\n\r\nAfter paying him that visit at his rooms Hyacinth lost sight of\r\nCaptain Sholto, who had not again reappeared at the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe little tavern which presented so common and casual a face to the\r\nworld, but offered in its unsuspected rear a security still unimpugned\r\nto machinations going down to the very bottom of things. Nothing was\r\nmore natural than that the Captain should be engaged at this season in\r\nthe recreations of his class; and our young man took for granted that\r\nif he were not hanging about the Princess on that queer footing as to\r\nwhich one had a secret hope one should some day command more light,\r\nhe was probably buffeting breezy northern seas on a yacht or creeping\r\nafter stags in the Highlands; our hero\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with the light\r\nliterature of his country being such as to assure him that in one or\r\nother of these occupations people of leisure, during the autumn, were\r\nnecessarily immersed. If the Captain were giving his attention to\r\nneither he must have started for Albania, or at least for Paris. Happy\r\nCaptain, Hyacinth mused, while his imagination followed him through\r\nvivid exotic episodes and his restless young feet continued to tread,\r\nthrough the stale flat weeks of September and October, the familiar\r\npavements of Soho, Islington and Pentonville, and the shabby sinuous\r\nways that unite these regions of labour. He had told the Princess he\r\nsometimes had a holiday at this period and that there was a chance\r\nof his escorting his respectable companion to the seaside; but as it\r\nturned out at present the spare cash for such an excursion was wanting.\r\nHyacinth had indeed for the moment an exceptionally keen sense of the\r\nlack of this convenience and was forcibly reminded that the society\r\nof agreeable women was a direct and constant appeal to the pocket.\r\nHe not only hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a penny, but was much in debt, owed pence and\r\nshillings, as he would have largely put it, all over the place, and\r\nthe explanation of his pinched feeling was in a vague half-remorseful,\r\nhalf-resigned reference to the numerous occasions when he had had not\r\nto fail of funds under penalty of disappointing a young lady whose\r\nneeds were positive, and especially to a certain high crisis (as it\r\nmight prove to be) in his destiny when it had come over him that one\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call on a princess just as one was. So this year he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nask old Crook for the week which some of the other men took\xe2\x80\x94Eustache\r\nPoupin, who had never quitted London since his arrival, launched\r\nhimself precisely that summer, supported by his brave wife, into the\r\nBritish unknown on the strength of a return ticket to Worthing\xe2\x80\x94simply\r\nbecause he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with it. The best way not to spend\r\nmoney, though no doubt not the best in the world to make it, was still\r\nto take one\xe2\x80\x99s daily course to the old familiar shabby shop, where, as\r\nthe days shortened and November thickened the air to a livid yellow,\r\nthe uncovered flame of the gas, burning often from the morning on,\r\nlighted up the ugliness in which the hand of practice endeavoured to\r\ndisengage a little beauty\xe2\x80\x94the ugliness of a dingy belittered interior,\r\nof battered dispapered walls, of work-tables stained and hacked, of\r\nwindows opening into a foul drizzling street, of the bared arms, the\r\nsordid waistcoat-backs, the smeared aprons, the personal odour, the\r\npatient obstinate irritating shoulders and vulgar narrow inevitable\r\nfaces of his fellow-labourers. Our young friend\xe2\x80\x99s relations with his\r\ncomrades would form a chapter by itself, but all that may be said of\r\nthe matter here is that the clever little operator from Lomax Place\r\nhad in a manner a double identity and that much as he lived in Mr.\r\nCrookenden\xe2\x80\x99s establishment he lived out of it still more. In this busy,\r\npasty, sticky, leathery little world, where wages and beer were the\r\nmain objects of consideration, he played his part in a way that marked\r\nhim as a queer lot, but capable of queerness in the line of equanimity\r\ntoo. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made good his place there without discovering that the\r\nBritish workman, when animated by the spirit of mirth, has rather a\r\nheavy hand, and he tasted of the practical joke in every degree of\r\nviolence. During his first year he dreamed, with secret passion and\r\nsuppressed tears, of a day of bliss when at last they would let him\r\nalone\xe2\x80\x94a day which arrived in time, for it is always an advantage to\r\nbe clever if one be only clever enough. Hyacinth was sufficiently so\r\nto have invented a _modus vivendi_ in respect to which M. Poupin said\r\nto him, \xe2\x80\x9c_Enfin vous voil\xc3\xa0 ferme!_\xe2\x80\x9d (the Frenchman himself, terribly\r\n_\xc3\xa9prouv\xc3\xa9_ at the beginning, had always bristled with firmness and\r\nopposed to insular grossness a refined dignity) and under the influence\r\nof which the scenery of Soho figured a daily dusky exhibition of\r\nprojected shadows, confined to the passive part of life and giving\r\nno hostages to reality, or at least to ambition, save an insufficient\r\nnumber of shillings on Saturday night and stray spasmodic reminiscences\r\nof delicate work that might have been more delicate still, as well as\r\nof such applications of the tool as he flattered himself unsurpassed\r\nunless by the supreme Eustache.\r\n\r\nOne evening in November he had after discharging himself of a\r\nconsiderable indebtedness to Pinnie still a sovereign in his pocket\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsovereign that seemed to spin there under the equal breath of a\r\ndozen different lively uses. He had come out for a walk with a vague\r\nintention of pushing as far as Audley Court; and lurking within this\r\nnebulous design, on which the damp breath of the streets, making\r\nobjects seem that night particularly dim and places particularly far,\r\nhad blown a certain chill, was a sense of how nice it would be to take\r\nsomething to Rose Muniment, who delighted in a sixpenny present and\r\nto whom he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t for some time rendered any such homage. At last,\r\nafter he had wandered a while, hesitating between the pilgrimage to\r\nLambeth and the possibility of still associating the two or three hours\r\nwith those perhaps in some lucky way or other at Millicent Henning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisposal, he reflected that if a sovereign was to be pulled to pieces\r\nit was a simplification to get it changed. He had struck through\r\nthe region of Mayfair, partly with the preoccupation of a short cut\r\nand partly from an instinct of self-defence; if one was in danger of\r\nspending one\xe2\x80\x99s money with a rush it was so much gained to plunge into\r\na quarter where, at that hour especially, there were no shops for\r\nlittle bookbinders. Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s victory, however, was imperfect when\r\nit occurred to him to turn into a public-house in order to convert his\r\ngold into convenient silver. When it was a question of entering these\r\nestablishments he selected in preference the most decent; he never knew\r\nwhat unpleasant people he might find on the other side of the swinging\r\ndoor. Those which glitter at intervals amid the residential gloom of\r\nthe large district abutting on Grosvenor Square partake of the general\r\ngentility of the neighbourhood, so that our friend was not surprised\r\n(he had passed into the compartment marked \xe2\x80\x9cprivate bar\xe2\x80\x9d) to see but a\r\nsingle drinker leaning against the counter on which, with his request\r\nvery civilly enunciated, he put down his sovereign. He was surprised\r\non the other hand when, glancing up again, he became aware that this\r\nlonely reveller was Captain Godfrey Sholto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear boy, what a remarkable coincidence!\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain\r\nexclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cFor once in five years that I come into a place like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t come in often myself. I thought you were in Madagascar,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHyacinth said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been at the \xe2\x80\x98Sun and Moon\xe2\x80\x99? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nconstantly out of town, you know. And then\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you see what I mean?\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwant to be tremendously careful. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way to get on, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nBut I daresay you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in my discretion!\xe2\x80\x9d Sholto laughed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do to make you understand? I say, have a brandy and\r\nsoda,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued as if this might assist Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s comprehension.\r\nHe seemed a trifle flurried and, were it possible to imagine such\r\na thing of so independent and whimsical a personage, the least bit\r\nabashed or uneasy at having been found in such a low place. Yet it was\r\nnot any lower than the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon.\xe2\x80\x9d He was dressed on this occasion\r\naccording to his station, without the pot-hat and the shabby jacket,\r\nand Hyacinth looked at him with the pang of the felt charm that a good\r\ntailor would add to life. Our hero was struck more than ever before\r\nwith his being the type of man whom, as he strolled about observing\r\npeople, he had so often regarded with wonder and envy\xe2\x80\x94the sort of\r\nman of whom one said to one\xe2\x80\x99s self that he was the \xe2\x80\x9cfinest white,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfeeling that he and his like had the world in their pocket. Sholto\r\nrequested the barmaid to please not dawdle in preparing the brandy\r\nand soda Hyacinth had thought to ease off the situation by accepting:\r\nthis indeed was perhaps what the finest white would naturally do.\r\nAnd when the young man had taken the glass from the counter didn\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\nappear to encourage him not to linger as he drank it and to smile down\r\nat him very kindly and amusedly, as if the combination of so small a\r\nbookbinder and so big a tumbler were sufficiently droll? The Captain\r\ntook time, however, to ask how he had spent his autumn and what was the\r\nnews in Bloomsbury; he further inquired about those jolly people across\r\nthe river. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what an impression they made on me\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nevening you know.\xe2\x80\x9d After this he went on suddenly and irrelevantly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you\xe2\x80\x99re just going to stay on for the winter quietly?\xe2\x80\x9d Our hero\r\nstared: he wondered what other high course could be imputed to him;\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect immediately that this was the sort of thing the\r\nfinest whites said to each other when they met after their fashionable\r\ndispersals, and that his friend had only been guilty of a momentary\r\ninadvertence. In point of fact the Captain recovered himself. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, of\r\ncourse you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your work, and that sort of thing\xe2\x80\x9d; and as Hyacinth\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed in swallowing at a gulp the contents of his big tumbler\r\nhe asked him presently if he had heard anything from the Princess. Our\r\nyouth replied that he could have no news except what the Captain might\r\nbe good enough to give him; but he added that he had been to see her\r\njust before she left town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you did go? That was quite right\xe2\x80\x94jolly right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went because she very kindly wrote me to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she wrote to you to come?\xe2\x80\x9d The Captain fixed him a moment with\r\nhis curious colourless eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know you\xe2\x80\x99re a devilish privileged\r\nmortal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I know it.\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth blushed and felt foolish; the barmaid,\r\nwho had heard this odd couple talking of a princess, was staring at him\r\ntoo with her elbows on the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know there are people who\xe2\x80\x99d give their heads that she should\r\nwrite them to come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt of it whatever!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he took refuge in a laugh that\r\nsounded less natural than he would have liked, and wondered if his\r\ninterlocutor weren\xe2\x80\x99t precisely one of these people. In this case the\r\nbarmaid might well stare; for deeply convinced as our young man might\r\nbe that he was the son of Lord Frederick Purvis, there was really no\r\nend to the oddity of his being preferred\xe2\x80\x94and by a princess\xe2\x80\x94to Captain\r\nSholto. If anything could have re-enforced at that moment his sense\r\nof this anomaly it would have been the indescribably gentlemanly way,\r\nimplying all sorts of common initiations, in which his companion went\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well, I see you know how to take it! And if you\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\ncorrespondence with her why do you say you can hear from her only\r\nthrough me? My dear fellow, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in correspondence with her. You\r\nmight think I\xe2\x80\x99d naturally be, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xe2\x80\x9d He subjoined as Hyacinth\r\nhad laughed again in a manner that might have passed for ambiguous:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the worse for me\xe2\x80\x94is that what you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth replied\r\nthat he himself had had the honour of hearing from the Princess but\r\nonce, and mentioned her having told him how her letter-writing came\r\non only in fits, when it was sometimes very profuse: there were months\r\ntogether that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t touch a pen. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can imagine what she told\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain knowingly returned. \xe2\x80\x9cLook out for the next fit! She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvisiting about, you know\xe2\x80\x94at a lot of great houses. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great thing\r\nto be somewhere with her\xe2\x80\x94an immense comedy.\xe2\x80\x9d He remarked that he had\r\nheard, now he remembered, that she either had taken or was thinking\r\nof taking a place in the country for a few months, and he added that\r\nif Hyacinth didn\xe2\x80\x99t propose to finish his brandy and soda they might as\r\nwell turn out. Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s thirst had been very superficial, and as they\r\nturned out the Captain observed by way of explanation of his having\r\nbeen found in a public-house (it was the only attempt of this kind he\r\nmade) that any friend of his would always know him by his love of rum\r\nout-of-the-way nooks. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have noticed that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy taste\r\nfor exploration. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t explored I never should have known you,\r\nshould I? That was rather a nice little girl in there; did you twig her\r\ngood bust? It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity they always have such beastly hands.\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth\r\nhad instinctively made a motion to go southward, but Sholto, passing\r\na hand into his arm, led him the other way. The house they had quitted\r\nwas near a corner, which they rounded, the Captain pushing forward as\r\nif there were some reason for haste. His haste was checked, however,\r\nby a prompt encounter with a young woman who, coming in the opposite\r\ndirection, turned the angle as briskly as themselves. At this moment\r\nhe gave his friend a great jerk, but not before Hyacinth had caught a\r\nglimpse of the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x94it seemed to flash upon him out of\r\nthe dusk\xe2\x80\x94and given quick voice to his surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Millicent!\xe2\x80\x9d This was the simple cry that escaped from his lips\r\nwhile the Captain, still going on, but threw off, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\r\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s your pretty friend?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth declined to go on and repeated Miss\r\nHenning\xe2\x80\x99s baptismal name so loudly that the young woman, who had passed\r\nthem without looking back, was obliged to stop. Then he saw he was not\r\nmistaken, though Millicent gave no audible response. She stood looking\r\nat him with her head very high, and he approached her, disengaging\r\nhimself from Sholto, who, however, hung back only an instant before\r\njoining them. Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s heart had suddenly begun to beat very fast;\r\nthere was a sharp shock in the girl\xe2\x80\x99s turning up just in that place\r\nat that moment. Yet when she began to laugh, and with violence, and\r\nto ask him why he should look at her as if she were a kicking horse,\r\nhe recognised that there was nothing so very extraordinary, after\r\nall, in a casual meeting between persons who were such frequenters of\r\nthe London streets. Millicent had never concealed the fact that she\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctrotted about\xe2\x80\x9d on various errands at night; and once when he had said\r\nto her that the less a respectable young woman took the evening air\r\nalone the better for her respectability she had asked how respectable\r\nhe thought she pretended to be and had remarked that if he would\r\nmake her a present of a brougham or even call for her three or four\r\ntimes a week in a cab she would doubtless preserve more of her social\r\npurity. She could turn the tables quickly enough and she exclaimed now,\r\nprofessing on her own side great astonishment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever are you prowling about here for? You\xe2\x80\x99re after no good, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe bound!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Miss Henning; what a jolly meeting!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain,\r\nremoving his hat with a humorous flourish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how d\xe2\x80\x99ye do?\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent returned as if not at once placing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere were you going so fast? What are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hyacinth, who\r\nhad looked from one to the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I never did see such a manner\xe2\x80\x94from one that knocks about like\r\n_you_!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Henning. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to see a friend of mine\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid in Curzon Street. Have you anything to say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell us\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t tell us!\xe2\x80\x9d Sholto interposed after she had\r\nspoken\xe2\x80\x94and she had not, however slightly, hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI at least\r\ndisavow the indiscretion. Where may not a charming woman be going when\r\nshe trips with a light foot through the deepening dusk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, what are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl demanded with dignity of\r\nHyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s companion. She spoke as if with a resentful suspicion that\r\nher foot had not really been felt to be light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what errand of mercy, on what secret ministration?\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecret yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Millicent. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you two always hunt in couples?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, we\xe2\x80\x99ll turn round and go with you as far as your friend\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHyacinth said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain added; and the three took their way together\r\nin the direction of Curzon Street. They walked for a few moments in\r\nsilence, though the Captain whistled, and then Millicent suddenly\r\nturned to Hyacinth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t told me where _you_ were going yet, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe met in that public-house,\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain said, \xe2\x80\x9cand were each so\r\nashamed of being found in such a place by the other that we tumbled out\r\ntogether without much thinking what we should do with ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he\xe2\x80\x99s out with me he pretends he can\xe2\x80\x99t abide them houses,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss\r\nHenning declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had looked in that one to see who was\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s rather nice,\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain went on. \xe2\x80\x9cShe told me her name\r\nwas Georgiana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to get a piece of money changed,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth said with the sense\r\nof a certain dishonesty in the air and glad he at least could afford to\r\nspeak the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get your grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s nightcap changed! I recommend you to keep\r\nyour money together\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve none too much of it!\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the reason you\xe2\x80\x99re playing me false?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth flashed out.\r\nHe had been thinking with still intentness as they walked; at once\r\nnursing and strangling a kindled suspicion. He was pale with the idea\r\nthat he had been bamboozled, yet was able to say to himself that one\r\nmust allow in life, thank goodness, for the element of coincidence,\r\nand that he might easily put himself immensely in the wrong by making\r\na groundless charge. It was only later that he pieced his impressions\r\ntogether and saw them\xe2\x80\x94as it appeared\xe2\x80\x94justify each other; at present, as\r\nsoon as he had uttered it, he was almost ashamed of his quick retort to\r\nMillicent\xe2\x80\x99s taunt. He ought at least to have waited to see what Curzon\r\nStreet would bring forth.\r\n\r\nThe girl broke out on him immediately, repeating \xe2\x80\x9cFalse, false?\xe2\x80\x9d with\r\nhigh derision and wanting to know whether that was the way to knock a\r\nlady about in public. She had stopped short on the edge of a crossing\r\nand she went on with a voice so uplifted that he was glad they were\r\nin a street apt to be empty at such an hour: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a pretty one\r\nto talk about falsity when a woman has only to leer at you out of an\r\nopera-box!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about _her_,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man interposed, trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray why not about \xe2\x80\x98her,\xe2\x80\x99 I should like to know? You don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s a decent woman, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d Millicent\xe2\x80\x99s laughter rang through the\r\nquiet neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, you know you _have_ been to her,\xe2\x80\x9d Captain Sholto\r\nwonderfully smiled.\r\n\r\nHyacinth turned on him staring and at once provoked and baffled by\r\nhis ambiguous part in an incident it was doubtless possible to magnify\r\nbut not possible to treat as perfectly simple. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to\r\nthe Princess Casamassima, thanks to you. When you came and pressed me\r\nto go, when you dragged me, do you make it a reproach? Who the devil\r\nare you, anyway, and what do you want of me?\xe2\x80\x9d our hero cried\xe2\x80\x94his mind\r\nflooded in a moment with everything in the Captain that had puzzled\r\nand worried and escaped him. This swelling tide obliterated on the spot\r\neverything that had beguiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, whatever I am I\xe2\x80\x99m not an ass,\xe2\x80\x9d this gentleman replied\r\nwith imperturbable good-humour. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t reproach you with anything.\r\nI only wanted to put in a word as a peacemaker. My good friends\xe2\x80\x94my\r\ngood friends,\xe2\x80\x9d and he laid a hand in his practised way on Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder while with the other pressed to his heart he bent on the girl\r\na face of gallantry which had something paternal in it: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m determined\r\nthis absurd misunderstanding shall end as lovers\xe2\x80\x99 quarrels ought always\r\nto end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth withdrew himself from the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s touch and said to\r\nMillicent: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not really jealous of\xe2\x80\x94of any one. You pretend that\r\nonly to throw dust in my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this sally Miss Henning returned him an answer which promised to be\r\nlively, but the Captain swept it away in the profusion of his protests.\r\nHe declared them a dear delightful abominable pair; he pronounced\r\nit rarely interesting to see how in people of their sort the prime\r\npassions lay near the surface; he almost pushed them into each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms and then wound up with proposing that they should all terminate\r\ntheir little differences by proceeding together to the Pavilion\r\nmusic-hall, the nearest place of entertainment in that neighbourhood,\r\nleaving the lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid in Curzon Street to dress her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s wig\r\nin peace. He has been presented to the reader as an accomplished man,\r\nand it will doubtless be felt that the picture is justified by his\r\nhaving eventually placed this idea in so attractive a light that his\r\ncompanions entered a hansom with him and rattled toward the haunt\r\nof pleasure, Hyacinth sandwiched, on the edge of the seat, between\r\nthe others. Two or three times our young man\xe2\x80\x99s ears burned; he felt\r\nthat if there was an understanding between them they had now, behind\r\nhim, a rare opportunity for carrying it out. If this understanding\r\nflourished at his expense the whole evening constituted for them indeed\r\nan opportunity, and that thought rendered his diversion but scantly\r\nabsorbing, though at the Pavilion the Captain engaged a big private box\r\nand ordered ices brought in. Hyacinth cared so little for his little\r\npink pyramid that he suffered Millicent to consume it after she had\r\ndisposed of her own. It was present to him, however, that if he should\r\nmake a fool of himself the folly would be of a very gross kind, and\r\nthis is why he withheld a question repeatedly on his lips\xe2\x80\x94the impulse\r\nto demand of his entertainer why the mischief he had hurried him so\r\nout of the public-house if he had not been waiting there preconcertedly\r\nfor Millicent. We know that in Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s eyes one of this young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompensatory merits had been that she was not deceitful, and he asked\r\nhimself if a girl could change that way from one month to the other.\r\nThis was optimistic, but, all the same, before leaving the Pavilion he\r\ndecided with one of his highest flights of intelligence that he could\r\nquite well see what Lady Aurora had meant by calling Captain Sholto\r\nvulgar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Muniment had fits of silence while the others were talking; but\r\non this occasion he had not opened his lips for half an hour. When he\r\ntalked Hyacinth listened almost to the retention of breath, and when he\r\nsaid nothing watched him fixedly, listening to the others only through\r\nthe medium of his candid countenance. At the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment\r\npaid very little attention to his young friend, doing nothing that\r\nshould cause it to be perceived they were particular pals; and Hyacinth\r\neven divined him at moments bored or irritated by the serious manner\r\nin which his small worrying bookbinder couldn\xe2\x80\x99t conceal from the world\r\nthat he regarded him. He wondered if this were a system, a calculated\r\nprudence, on Muniment\xe2\x80\x99s part, or only a manifestation of the superior\r\nbrutality latent in his composition and which, without an intention of\r\ndirect harshness, was naturally impatient of palaver. There was plenty\r\nof palaver at the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon\xe2\x80\x9d; there were nights when a blast of\r\nimbecility seemed to blow over the place and one felt ashamed to be\r\nassociated with so much crude fatuity and flat-faced vanity. Then every\r\none, with two or three exceptions, made an ass of himself, thumping\r\nthe table and repeating over some inane phrase which appeared for the\r\nhour to constitute the whole furniture of his mind. There were men who\r\nkept saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThem was my words in the month of February last, and what\r\nI say I stick to\xe2\x80\x94what I say I stick to\xe2\x80\x9d; and others who perpetually\r\ninquired of the company, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what the plague am I to do with seventeen\r\nbob\xe2\x80\x94with seventeen bloody bob? What am I to do with them\xe2\x80\x94will ye tell\r\nme that?\xe2\x80\x9d an interrogation which in truth usually ended by producing\r\na ribald reply. There were still others who remarked to satiety that\r\nif it was not done to-day it would have to be done to-morrow, and\r\nseveral who constantly proclaimed their opinion that the only way\r\nwas to pull up the Park rails again, just to haul \xe2\x80\x99em straight up. A\r\nlittle shoemaker with red eyes and a greyish face, whose appearance\r\nHyacinth deplored, scarcely ever expressed himself but in the same form\r\nof words: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, are we in earnest or ain\xe2\x80\x99t we in earnest?\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nthing _I_ want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d He was terribly in earnest himself, but this\r\nwas almost the only way he had of showing it; and he had much in common\r\n(though they were always squabbling) with a large red-faced man, of\r\nuncertain attributes and stertorous breathing, who was understood to\r\nknow a good deal about dogs, had fat hands and wore on his forefinger\r\na big silver ring containing some one\xe2\x80\x99s hair\xe2\x80\x94Hyacinth believed it to\r\nbe that of a terrier snappish in life. He had always the same refrain:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now are we just starving or ain\xe2\x80\x99t we just starving? I should like\r\nthe v\xe2\x80\x99ice of the company on that question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the tone fell as low as this Paul Muniment held his peace save for\r\nwhistling a little and leaning back with his hands in his pockets and\r\nhis eyes on the table. Hyacinth often supposed him to be on the point\r\nof breaking out and letting the company know what he thought of them\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nhad a perfectly clear vision of what he must think: but Muniment never\r\ncompromised his popularity to that degree; he judged it\xe2\x80\x94this he once\r\ntold his young comrade\xe2\x80\x94too valuable a weapon, so that he cultivated the\r\nfaculty of patience, which had the advantage of showing one more and\r\nmore that one must do one\xe2\x80\x99s thinking for one\xe2\x80\x99s self. His popularity\r\nindeed struck Hyacinth as rather an uncertain amount, and the only\r\nmistake he had seen a symptom of on his friend\xe2\x80\x99s part was a tendency\r\nto overestimate it. Muniment thought many of their colleagues asinine,\r\nbut it was Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s belief that he himself knew still better how\r\nasinine they were; and this inadequate conception supported in some\r\ndegree on Paul\xe2\x80\x99s part his theory of his influence\xe2\x80\x94an influence that\r\nwould be stronger than any other on the day he should choose to exert\r\nit. Hyacinth only wished that day would come; it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be till\r\nthen, he was sure, that they would all know where they were and that\r\nthe good they were striving for, blindly, obstructedly, in a kind of\r\neternal dirty intellectual fog, would pass from the stage of crude\r\ndiscussion and mere sore, sharp, tantalising desirableness into that\r\nof solid, seated reality. Muniment was listened to unanimously when\r\nhe spoke and much talked about, usually with a knowing, implicit\r\nallusiveness, when he was absent; it was generally admitted he could\r\nsee further than most. But it was suspected he wanted to see further\r\nthan was necessary; as one of the most inveterate frequenters of\r\nthe club remarked one evening, if a man could see as far as he could\r\n\xe2\x80\x99eave a brick this was far enough. There was an idea he had nothing\r\nparticular to complain of personally, or perhaps that if he had he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t complain of it\xe2\x80\x94an attitude which could only contain the germs\r\nof a latent disaffection. Hyacinth was aware of being himself exposed\r\nto the same imputation; but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it\xe2\x80\x94it would have been\r\nimpossible to him to keep up his character for sincerity by revealing\r\nat the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon\xe2\x80\x9d the condition of his wardrobe or by announcing\r\nthat he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a penn\xe2\x80\x99orth of bacon for six months. There were\r\nmembers of the club who were apparently always in the enjoyment of\r\ninvoluntary leisure\xe2\x80\x94narrating the vainest peregrinations in search of a\r\njob, the cruellest rebuffs, the most vivid anecdotes of the insolence\r\nof office. They made Hyacinth uncomfortably conscious at times that\r\nif _he_ should be out of work it would be wholly by his own fault;\r\nthat he held in his hand a fine bread-winning tool on which he might\r\nabsolutely count. He was also not unadvised, however, that his position\r\nin this little band of malcontents (it was small only if measured\r\nby the numbers gathered on any one occasion; he liked to think it\r\nlarge in its latent possibilities, its mysterious ramifications and\r\naffiliations) was peculiar and distinguished: it would be favourable\r\nif he should develop the kind of energy and assurance that would help\r\nhim to make use of it. He had an intimate conviction\xe2\x80\x94the proof of it\r\nwas in the air, in the sensible facility of his footing at the \xe2\x80\x9cSun\r\nand Moon\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that Eustache Poupin had taken on himself to disseminate the\r\nanecdote of his origin, of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s disaster; in consequence of\r\nwhich, as the victim of social infamy, of heinous laws, it was conceded\r\nto him that he had a larger account to settle even than most. He was\r\n_ab ovo_ a revolutionist, and that balanced against his smart neckties,\r\na certain suspicious security that was perceived in him as to the _h_\r\n(he had had from his earliest years a natural command of it) and the\r\nfact that he possessed the sort of hand on which there is always a\r\npremium\xe2\x80\x94an accident somehow to be guarded against in a thorough-going\r\nsystem of equality. He never challenged Poupin on the subject, for he\r\nowed the Frenchman too much to reproach him with any officious step\r\nthat was meant in kindness; and, moreover, his fellow-labourer at old\r\nCrook\xe2\x80\x99s had said to him, as if to anticipate such an impugnment of\r\nhis discretion: \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, my child, that I\xe2\x80\x99m incapable of drawing\r\naside any veil that you may have preferred to drop over your lacerated\r\npersonality. Your moral dignity will always be safe with me. But\r\nremember at the same time that among the disinherited there\xe2\x80\x99s a mystic\r\nlanguage which dispenses with proofs\xe2\x80\x94a freemasonry, a reciprocal\r\ndivination: they understand each other at half a word.\xe2\x80\x9d It was at half\r\na word then in Bloomsbury that Hyacinth had been understood; but there\r\nwas a certain delicacy in him that forbade him to push his advantage,\r\nto treat implications of sympathy, none the less definite for being\r\nawkward and obscure, as steps in the ladder of success. He had no wish\r\nto be a leader because his mother had murdered her lover and died\r\nin penal servitude: these circumstances recommended intentness, but\r\nthey also imposed modesty. When the gathering at the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas at its best and its temper seemed really an earnest of what was\r\nthe basis of all its calculations\xe2\x80\x94that the people was only a sleeping\r\nlion, already breathing shorter and beginning to stretch its limbs\r\nand stiffen its claws\xe2\x80\x94at these hours, some of them thrilling enough,\r\nHyacinth waited for the voice that should allot him the particular part\r\nhe was to play. His ambition was to play it with brilliancy, to offer\r\nan example\xe2\x80\x94an example even that might survive him\xe2\x80\x94of pure youthful,\r\nalmost juvenile, consecration. He was conscious of no commission to\r\ngive the promises, to assume the responsibilities, of a redeemer, and\r\nhe had no envy of the man on whom this burden should rest. Muniment\r\nindeed might carry it, and it was the first article of his faith\r\nthat to help him to carry it the better he himself was ready for any\r\nsacrifice. Then it was\xe2\x80\x94on these nights of intenser vibration\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\nwaited for the sacred sign.\r\n\r\nThey came oftener this second winter, for the season was terribly\r\nhard; and as in that lower world one walked with one\xe2\x80\x99s ear nearer the\r\nground the deep perpetual groan of London misery seemed to swell and\r\nswell and form the whole undertone of life. The filthy air reached\r\nthe place in the damp coats of silent men and hung there till it was\r\nbrewed to a nauseous warmth, and ugly serious faces squared themselves\r\nthrough it, and strong-smelling pipes contributed their element in a\r\nfierce dogged manner which appeared to say that it now had to stand\r\nfor everything\xe2\x80\x94for bread and meat and beer, for shoes and blankets\r\nand the poor things at the pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s and the smokeless chimney at\r\nhome. Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s colleagues affected him as wiser then, as more richly\r\npermeated with intentions boding ill to the satisfied classes; and\r\nthough the note of popularity was still most effectively struck by\r\nthe man who could demand oftenest, unpractically, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell am I\r\nto do with half a quid?\xe2\x80\x9d it was brought home to our hero on more than\r\none occasion that revolution was ripe at last. This was especially\r\nthe case on the evening I began by referring to, when Eustache Poupin\r\nsqueezed in and announced, as if it were a great piece of news, that\r\nin the east of London that night there were forty thousand men out of\r\nwork. He looked round the circle with his dilated foreign eye as he\r\ntook his place: he seemed to address the company individually as well\r\nas collectively and to make each man responsible for hearing him. He\r\nowed his position at the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon\xe2\x80\x9d to the brilliancy with which\r\nhe represented the political exile, the magnanimous immaculate citizen\r\nwrenched out of bed at dead of night, torn from his hearthstone, his\r\nloved ones and his profession and hurried across the frontier with only\r\nthe coat on his back. Poupin had performed in this character now for\r\nmany years, but had never lost the bloom of the outraged proscript,\r\nand the passionate pictures he had often drawn of the bitterness of\r\nexile were moving even to those who knew with what success he had set\r\nup his household gods in Lisson Grove. He was recognised as suffering\r\neverything for his opinions; and his hearers in Bloomsbury, who even\r\nin their most infuriated hours felt as Britons, appeared never to have\r\nmade the subtle reflexion, though they made many others, that there\r\nwas a want of tact in his calling on them to sympathise with him for\r\nbeing one of themselves. He imposed himself by the eloquence of his\r\nassumption that if one were not in the beautiful supreme France one was\r\nnowhere worth speaking of, and ended by producing an impression that\r\nthat country had a quite supernatural charm. Muniment had once said\r\nto Hyacinth that he was sure Poupin would be very sorry to be enabled\r\nto go home again (as he really might from one week to the other,\r\nthe Republic being so indulgent and the amnesty to the Communards\r\nconstantly extended) for over there he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a refugee; and\r\nhowever this might be he certainly flourished a good deal in London on\r\nthe basis of this very fact that he so suffered from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you tell us that as if it was so very striking? Don\xe2\x80\x99t we know\r\nit and haven\xe2\x80\x99t we known it always? But you\xe2\x80\x99re right; we behave as if\r\nwe knew nothing at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Schinkel, the German cabinet-maker\r\nwho had originally introduced Captain Sholto to the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nhad a long, unhealthy, benevolent face and greasy hair, and constantly\r\nwore an untidy bandage round his neck, as if for a local ailment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nremind us\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s very well; but we shall forget it in half an hour.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re not serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardon, pardon_; for myself I don\xe2\x80\x99t admit that!\xe2\x80\x9d Poupin replied,\r\nstriking the table with his finger-tips several times, very fast. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not serious I\xe2\x80\x99m nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, you\xe2\x80\x99re something,\xe2\x80\x9d said the German, smoking his monumental pipe\r\nwith a contemplative air. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all something, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanything very useful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, things would be worse without us. I\xe2\x80\x99d jolly rather be in\r\nhere, in _this_ kind of muck, than outside,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the fat man who\r\nunderstood dogs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, it\xe2\x80\x99s very pleasant, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99ve your beer; but\r\nnot so pleasant over there at the Docks, where fifty thousand people\r\nstarve. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very unpleasant night,\xe2\x80\x9d the cabinet-maker went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can it be worse?\xe2\x80\x9d Eustache Poupin asked while he looked at the\r\nGerman as to make him responsible for the fat man\xe2\x80\x99s reflexion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nbad that the imagination recoils, refuses\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for the imagination!\xe2\x80\x9d the fat man declared. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want\r\na compact body in marching order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call a compact body?\xe2\x80\x9d the little grey-faced shoemaker\r\ndemanded. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean your kind of body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I know what I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fat man severely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a grand thing. Perhaps one of these days you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see it for yourself perhaps, before that day comes,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ngentleman with the silver ring rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps when you do you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nremember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, Schinkel says we don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shoemaker, nodding\r\nat the cloud-compelling German.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a bloody rap what no man says!\xe2\x80\x9d the dog-fancier\r\nexclaimed, gazing straight before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad year\xe2\x80\x94the blockheads in the newspapers,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nSchinkel went on, addressing himself to the company at large. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say\r\nthat on purpose\xe2\x80\x94to convey the impression that there are such things as\r\ngood years. I ask the company, has any gentleman present ever happened\r\nto notice that article? The good year\xe2\x80\x99s yet to come: it might begin\r\nto-night, if we like: it all depends on our being able to be serious\r\nfor a few hours. But that\xe2\x80\x99s too much to expect. Mr. Muniment\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nserious; he looks as if he was waiting for the signal, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspeak\xe2\x80\x94he never speaks if I want particularly to hear him. He only\r\ndeliberates very deeply\xe2\x80\x94oh I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. But it\xe2\x80\x99s almost as bad to think\r\nwithout speaking as to speak without thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth always admired the cool, easy way in which Muniment comported\r\nhimself when the attention of the public was directed at him. These\r\nmanifestations of curiosity or of hostility would have put him out\r\nimmensely himself. When a lot of people, especially the kind of people\r\ncollected at the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon,\xe2\x80\x9d looked at him or listened to him all\r\nat once, he always blushed and stammered, feeling that if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave a million of spectators (which would have been inspiring) he\r\nshould prefer to have but two or three; there was something rather\r\nawful in twenty.\r\n\r\nMuniment smiled an instant good-humouredly; then after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation, looking across at the German and the German only, as if his\r\nremark were worth noticing but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if the others didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand the reply, he said simply: \xe2\x80\x9cHoffendahl\xe2\x80\x99s in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoffendahl? _Gott in Himmel!_\xe2\x80\x9d the cabinet-maker exclaimed, taking the\r\npipe out of his mouth. And the two men exchanged a longish glance. Then\r\nMr. Schinkel remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cThat surprises me, _sehr_. Are you very sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuniment continued for a little to look at him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I keep quiet half\r\nan hour, with so many valuable suggestions flying all round me, you\r\nthink I say too little. Then if I open my head to give out three words\r\nyou appear to think I say too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh no, on the contrary\xe2\x80\x94I want you to say three more. If you tell me\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him I shall be perfectly satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word I should hope so! Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of bloke a\r\nfellow says he has seen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustache Poupin, who had been listening.\r\nEvery one was listening now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends on the fellow he says it to. Not even here?\xe2\x80\x9d the German\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh here!\xe2\x80\x9d Paul Muniment exclaimed in a peculiar tone while he resumed\r\nhis muffled whistle again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care\xe2\x80\x94take care; you\xe2\x80\x99ll make me think you haven\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Poupin\r\nwith his excited expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Muniment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Nun_, I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d the cabinet-maker remarked, restoring his pipe\r\nto his lips after an interval almost as momentous as the stoppage of a\r\nsteamer in mid-ocean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_\xe2\x80\x99Ere_, \xe2\x80\x99ere?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the small shoemaker indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s as good as the place he came from. He might look in and see what\r\nhe thinks of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a place you might tell us a little about now,\xe2\x80\x9d the fat man\r\nsuggested as if he had been waiting for his chance.\r\n\r\nBefore the shoemaker had time to notice this challenge some one\r\ninquired with a hoarse petulance who the bloody blazes they were\r\ntalking about; and Mr. Schinkel took upon himself to reply that they\r\nwere talking about a man who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done what he had done by simply\r\nexchanging abstract ideas, however valuable, with his friends in a\r\nrespectable pot-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil has he done then?\xe2\x80\x9d some one else demanded; and Muniment\r\nreplied quietly that he had spent twelve years in a Prussian prison\r\nand was consequently still an object of a good deal of interest to the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you call that very useful I must say I prefer a pot-house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried the shoemaker, appealing to all the company and looking, as it\r\nappeared to Hyacinth, particularly hideous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Doch, doch_, it\xe2\x80\x99s useful,\xe2\x80\x9d the German remarked philosophically among\r\nhis yellow clouds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you\xe2\x80\x99re not prepared for that yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment\r\nasked of the shoemaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrepared for that? I thought we were going to smash that sort of shop\r\naltogether; I thought that was the main part of the job.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll smash best who\xe2\x80\x99ve been inside,\xe2\x80\x9d the German said; \xe2\x80\x9cunless\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve only gone bad, like fish too long caught. But Hoffendahl\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nthere yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh no; no smashing, no smashing of any valuable property,\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no wrong places\xe2\x80\x94there are only wrong uses for them.\r\nWe want to keep them standing and even to put up a few more; but the\r\ndifference will be that we shall put the correct sort into them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take your idea\xe2\x80\x94that Griffin\xe2\x80\x99s one of the correct sort,\xe2\x80\x9d the fat man\r\nremarked, indicating the shoemaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought we was going to \xe2\x80\x99ave their \xe2\x80\x99eads\xe2\x80\x94all that bloomin\xe2\x80\x99 lot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMr. Griffin protested; while Eustache Poupin began to enlighten the\r\ncompany as to the great Hoffendahl, one of the purest martyrs of their\r\ncause, a man who had been through everything\xe2\x80\x94who had been scarred and\r\nbranded, tortured, almost flayed, and had never given his would-be\r\nbutchers the names they wanted. Was it possible they didn\xe2\x80\x99t remember\r\nthat great combined assault, early in the sixties, which took place in\r\nfour Continental cities at once and which in spite of every effort to\r\nsmother it up\xe2\x80\x94there had been editors and journalists transported even\r\nfor hinting at it\xe2\x80\x94had done more for the social question than anything\r\nbefore or since? \xe2\x80\x9cThrough \xe2\x80\x99im being served in the manner you describe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsome one asked with plainness; to which Poupin replied that it was one\r\nof those failures that are more glorious than any success. Muniment\r\nsaid that the affair had been only a flash in the pan, but that the\r\ngreat value of it was this\xe2\x80\x94that whereas some forty persons (and of\r\nboth sexes) had been engaged in it, only one had been seized and had\r\nsuffered. It had been Hoffendahl himself who was collared. Certainly\r\nhe had suffered much, he had suffered for every one; but from that\r\npoint of view\xe2\x80\x94that of the economy of material\xe2\x80\x94the thing had been a rare\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I call the others? I call \xe2\x80\x99em bloody sneaks!\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nfat man cried; and Eustache Poupin, turning to Muniment, expressed\r\nthe hope that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t really approve of such a solution\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconsider that an economy of heroism was an advantage to any cause.\r\nHe himself esteemed Hoffendahl\xe2\x80\x99s attempt because it had shaken, more\r\nthan anything\xe2\x80\x94except of course the Commune\xe2\x80\x94had shaken it since the\r\nFrench Revolution, the rotten fabric of the actual social order, and\r\nbecause that very fact of the impunity, the invisibility of the persons\r\nconcerned in it had given the predatory classes, had given all Europe,\r\na shudder that had not yet subsided; but for his part, he must regret\r\nthat some of the associates of the devoted victim had not come forward\r\nand insisted on sharing with him his tortures and his captivity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_\xc3\x87\xe2\x80\x99aurait \xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 d\xe2\x80\x99un bel exemple!_\xe2\x80\x9d said the Frenchman with an\r\nimpressive moderation of statement which made even those who\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand him see he was saying something fine; while the\r\ncabinet-maker observed that in Hoffendahl\xe2\x80\x99s place any of them would\r\nhave stood out just the same. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t care if they set it down to\r\nself-love (Mr. Schinkel called it \xe2\x80\x9cloaf\xe2\x80\x9d) but he might say that he\r\nhimself would have done so if he had been trusted and had been bagged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to have it all drawn up clear first; then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go in,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nfat man, who seemed to think it was expected of him to be reassuring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, who the dickens is to draw it up, eh? That\xe2\x80\x99s what we happen to\r\nbe talking about,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his antagonist the shoemaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine example, old man? Is that your idea of a fine example?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMuniment, with his amused face, asked of Poupin. \xe2\x80\x9cA fine example of\r\nasininity! Are there capable people, in such plenty, about the place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapable of greatness of soul, I grant you not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour greatness of soul is usually greatness of blundering. A man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforemost duty is not to get collared. If you want to show you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncapable, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Hyacinth suddenly felt himself moved to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cBut some one\r\nmust be caught always, must he not? Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t some one always been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I daresay you\xe2\x80\x99ll be if you like it!\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment replied without\r\nlooking at him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they succeed in potting you, do as Hoffendahl\r\ndid, and do it as a matter of course; but if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, make it your\r\nsupreme duty, make it your religion, to lie close and keep yourself for\r\nanother go. The world\xe2\x80\x99s full of unclean beasts whom I shall be glad to\r\nsee shovelled away by the thousand; but when it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of honest\r\nmen and men of courage I protest against the idea that two should be\r\nsacrificed where one will serve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Trop d\xe2\x80\x99arithm\xc3\xa9tique\xe2\x80\x94trop d\xe2\x80\x99arithm\xc3\xa9tique!_\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s fearfully English!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPoupin cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, no doubt; what else should it be? You shall never share my\r\nfate if I have a fate and I can prevent it!\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment laughed.\r\n\r\nPoupin stared at him and his coarse mirth, as if he thought the English\r\nfrivolous as well as calculating; then he rejoined: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I suffer I\r\ntrust it may be for suffering humanity, but I trust it may also be for\r\nFrance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I hope you ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to suffer any more for France,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nGriffin. \xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t it done that insatiable old country of yours some good\r\nby this time, all you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to put up with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I want to know what Hoffendahl has come over for; it\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nkind of him, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. What\xe2\x80\x99s he going to do for _us_?\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_\r\nwant to know,\xe2\x80\x9d brought out in a loud argumentative tone a personage at\r\nthe end of the table most distant from Muniment\xe2\x80\x99s place. His name was\r\nDelancey and he gave himself out as holding a position in a manufactory\r\nof soda-water; but Hyacinth had a secret belief that he was really a\r\nhairdresser\xe2\x80\x94a belief connected with a high lustrous curl or crest which\r\nhe wore on the summit of his large head, as well as with the manner in\r\nwhich he thrust over his ear, as if it were a barber\xe2\x80\x99s comb, the pencil\r\naddressed to his careful note-taking on the discussions conducted\r\nat the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon.\xe2\x80\x9d His opinions were distinct and frequently\r\nexpressed; he had a watery (Muniment had once called it a soda-watery)\r\neye and a personal aversion to a lord. He desired to change everything\r\nexcept religion, of which he approved.\r\n\r\nMuniment answered that he was unable to say as yet what the German\r\nrevolutionist had come to England for, but that he hoped to be able to\r\ngive some information on the matter the next time they should meet.\r\nIt was very certain Hoffendahl hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come for nothing, and he would\r\nundertake to declare that they would all feel within a short time that\r\nhe had given a lift to the cause they had at heart. He had had a great\r\nexperience, which they might very well find it useful to appeal to.\r\nIf there was a way for them then and there he would be sure to know\r\nthe way. \xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree with the majority of you\xe2\x80\x94as I take it to be,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMuniment went on in his fresh, cheerful, reasonable manner\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI quite\r\nagree with you that the time has come to settle upon it and to follow\r\nit. I quite agree with you that the actual state of things is\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\npaused a moment and then went on in the same pleasant tone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis infamous\r\nand hellish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese remarks were received with a differing demonstration: some of\r\nthe company declaring that if the Dutchman cared to come round and\r\nsmoke a pipe they\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to see him\xe2\x80\x94perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99d show where the\r\nthumbscrews had been put on; others being strongly of the opinion that\r\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any more advice\xe2\x80\x94they had already had advice enough\r\nto turn a donkey\xe2\x80\x99s stomach. What they wanted was to put forth their\r\nmight without any more palaver; to do for something or for some one;\r\nto go out somewhere and smash something on the spot\xe2\x80\x94why not?\xe2\x80\x94smash\r\nit that very night. While they sat still and talked there were about\r\nhalf a million of people in London that didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where the hell the\r\nmorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meal was to come from; what they wanted to do, unless they\r\nwere just a collection of pettifogging old women, was to show them\r\nwhere to get it, to take it to them with heaped-up hands. Hyacinth\r\nlistened, with a divided attention, to interlaced iterations, while the\r\ntalk blew hot and cold; there was a genuine emotion, a quick pulse of\r\nhigh fever, to-night in the rear of the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon,\xe2\x80\x9d and he felt the\r\ncontagion of excited purpose. But he was following a train of his own;\r\nhe was wondering what Muniment had in reserve (for certainly Paul but\r\nplayed with the company), and his imagination, quickened by the sense\r\nof impending relations with the heroic Hoffendahl and the discussion\r\nas to the alternative duty of escaping or of facing one\xe2\x80\x99s fate, had\r\nlaunched itself into possible perils\xe2\x80\x94into the idea of how he might in a\r\ngiven case settle for himself that question of paying for the lot. The\r\nloud, contradictory, vain, unpractical babble went on about him, but\r\nhe was definitely conscious only that the project of breaking into the\r\nbakers\xe2\x80\x99 shops was well before the assembly and was receiving a vigorous\r\ntreatment, and that there was likewise a good deal of reference to\r\nthe butchers and grocers and even to the fishmongers. He was in a\r\nstate of inward exaltation, possessed by an intense desire to stand\r\nface to face with the sublime Hoffendahl, to hear his voice and touch\r\nhis mutilated hand. He was ready for anything: he knew he was himself\r\nsafe to breakfast and dine, if poorly still sufficiently, and that his\r\ncolleagues were perhaps even more crude and clumsy than usual; but a\r\nbreath of popular passion had warmed his cheek and his heart, and he\r\nseemed to see, immensely magnified, the monstrosity of the great ulcers\r\nand sores of London\xe2\x80\x94the sick, eternal misery crying out of the darkness\r\nin vain, confronted with granaries and treasure-houses and places of\r\ndelight where shameless satiety kept guard. In such a mood as this he\r\nfelt there was no need to consider, to reason: the facts themselves\r\nwere as imperative as the cry of the drowning, since while pedantry\r\ngained time didn\xe2\x80\x99t starvation and anguish gain it too? He knew Muniment\r\ndisapproved of delay, that he held the day had come for a forcible\r\nrectification of horrible inequalities. In the last conversation they\r\nhad had together his judicious friend had given him a more definite\r\nwarrant than ever before for numbering him in the party of immediate\r\naction, though indeed he remarked on this occasion, once more, that\r\nthat particular formula the little bookbinder appeared to have taken\r\nsuch a fancy to was mere gibberish. He hated this sort of pretentious\r\nlabel; it was fit only for politicians and amateurs. None the less he\r\nhad been as plain as possible on the point that their game must be now\r\nto frighten society, and frighten it effectually; to make it believe\r\nthat the swindled classes were at last fairly in league\xe2\x80\x94had really\r\ngrasped the idea that, closely combined, they would be irresistible.\r\nThey were not in league and they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t in their totality grasped\r\nany idea at all\xe2\x80\x94Muniment was not slow to make that equally plain.\r\nAll the same society was scareable, and every great scare was a gain\r\nfor the people. If Hyacinth had needed warrant to-night for a faith\r\ntranscending logic he would have found it in his recall of this quiet\r\nprofession; but his friend\xe2\x80\x99s words came back to him mainly to make him\r\nwonder what that friend had in his head just now. He took no part in\r\nany vociferation; he had called Schinkel to come round and sit beside\r\nhim, and the two appeared to confer together in honest ease while the\r\nbrown atmosphere grew denser, the passing to and fro of firebrands more\r\nlively and the flush of faces more portentous. What Hyacinth would\r\nhave liked to know most of all was why Muniment had not mentioned to\r\nhim first that Hoffendahl was in London and that he had seen him;\r\nfor he _had_ seen him, though he had dodged Schinkel\xe2\x80\x99s question\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nthat Hyacinth instantly felt sure. He would ask for more information\r\nlater; and meanwhile he wished, without resentment, but with a patient\r\nconscious ache, that Muniment would treat him with a little more\r\nconfidence. If there were a secret in regard to Hoffendahl\xe2\x80\x94and there\r\nevidently was: Muniment, quite rightly, though he had dropped the\r\nannouncement of his arrival for a certain effect, had no notion of\r\nsharing the rest of what he knew with that raw roomful\xe2\x80\x94if there were\r\nsomething to be silent and devoted about Hyacinth ardently hoped that\r\nto him in particular would a chance be given to show how he could\r\npractise this superiority. He felt hot and nervous; he got up suddenly\r\nand, through the dark tortuous greasy passage communicating with the\r\nouter world, went forth into the street. The air was foul and sleety\r\nbut refreshed him, and he stood in front of the public-house and smoked\r\nanother pipe. Bedraggled figures passed in and out and a damp tattered\r\nwretched man with a spongy purple face, who had been thrust suddenly\r\nacross the threshold, stood and whimpered in the brutal blaze of the\r\nrow of lamps. The puddles glittered roundabout and the silent vista\r\nof the street, bordered with low black houses, stretched away in the\r\nwintry drizzle to right and left, losing itself in the huge tragic city\r\nwhere unmeasured misery lurked beneath the dirty night, ominously,\r\nmonstrously still, only howling, for its pain, in the heated human\r\ncockpit behind him. Ah what could he do? What opportunity would rise?\r\nThe blundering divided counsels he had been listening to but made the\r\nhelplessness of every one concerned more abject. If he had a definite\r\nwish while he stood there it was that that exalted deluded company\r\nshould pour itself forth with Muniment at its head and surge through\r\nthe sleeping world and gather the myriad miserable out of their slums\r\nand burrows, should roll into the selfish squares and lift a tremendous\r\nhungry voice and awaken the gorged indifferent to a terror that would\r\nbring them down. He lingered a quarter of an hour, but this grand\r\ntreat gave no sign of coming off, and he finally returned to the noisy\r\nclub-room in a state of tormented wonder as to what better idea than\r\nthis very bad one (which seemed to our young man to have at the least\r\nthe merit that it was an idea) Muniment could be revolving in that\r\ntoo-comprehensive brain of his.\r\n\r\nAs he re-entered the place he saw the meeting was breaking up in\r\ndisorder, or at all events in confusion, and that certainly no\r\norganised attempt at the rescue of any number of victims would take\r\nplace that night. All the men were on their feet and were turning away\r\namid a shuffle of benches and chairs, a hunch of shabby shoulders,\r\na frugal abatement of flaring gas and a varied vivacity of disgust\r\nand resignation. The moment after Hyacinth came in Mr. Delancey, the\r\nsupposititious hairdresser, jumped upon a chair at the far end of the\r\nroom and shrieked out an accusation which made every one stop and stare\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I want you all to know what strikes me before we part company.\r\nThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a man in the blessed lot of you that isn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of his\r\nbloody skin\xe2\x80\x94afraid, afraid, afraid! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go anywhere with any one,\r\nbut there isn\xe2\x80\x99t another, by G\xe2\x80\x94, by what I can make out! There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s son of you that\xe2\x80\x99ll risk his precious bones!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis little oration affected Hyacinth like a quick blow in the face:\r\nit seemed to leap at him personally, as if a three-legged stool or\r\nsome hideous hob-nailed boot had been shied at him. The room surged\r\nround, heaving up and down, while he was conscious of a loud explosion\r\nof laughter and scorn, of cries of \xe2\x80\x9cOrder, order!\xe2\x80\x9d of some clear word\r\nof Muniment\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Delancey, just step down\xe2\x80\x9d; of Eustache Poupin\r\nshouting out, \xe2\x80\x9c_Vous insultez le peuple\xe2\x80\x94vous insultez le peuple!_\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nother retorts not remarkable for refinement. The next moment he found\r\nhe had himself sprung up on a chair opposite the barber and that at\r\nthe sight of so prompt a display the commotion had suddenly turned to\r\nalmost amused suspense. It was the first time he had asked the ear of\r\nthe company, which was given on the spot. He was sure he looked very\r\nwhite\xe2\x80\x94it was even possible they could see him tremble. He could only\r\nhope this didn\xe2\x80\x99t make him ridiculous when he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright of him to say that. There are others besides him. At all events I\r\nwant to speak for myself: it may do some good; I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nafraid; I\xe2\x80\x99m very sure I\xe2\x80\x99m not. I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to do anything that will do\r\nany good; anything, anything\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a damned rap. In such a cause\r\nI should like the idea of danger. I don\xe2\x80\x99t consider my bones precious\r\nin the least, compared with some other things. If one\xe2\x80\x99s sure one isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nafraid, and one\xe2\x80\x99s accused, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t one say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appeared to him he was talking a long time and when it was over\r\nhe scarcely knew what happened. He felt himself in a moment down\r\nalmost under the feet of the other men; stamped upon with intentions\r\nof applause, of familiarity; laughed over and jeered over, hustled\r\nand poked in the ribs. He felt himself also pressed to the bosom of\r\nEustache Poupin, who apparently was sobbing, while he heard some one\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cDid ye hear the little bloody beggar, as bold as a lion?\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\ntrial of personal prowess between him and Mr. Delancey was proposed,\r\nbut somehow it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take place, and at the end of five minutes the\r\nclub-room had emptied itself, yet clearly not to be reconstituted\r\noutside in a revolutionary procession. Paul Muniment had taken hold of\r\nhim and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble you to stay, you small desperado: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nblowed if I ever expected to see _you_ on the stump!\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment remained\r\nand M. Poupin and Mr. Schinkel lingered, donning overcoats, beneath a\r\ndim surviving gas-burner in the unventilated medium in which at each\r\nrenewed gathering the Bloomsbury club seemed to recognise itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my life I believe you\xe2\x80\x99re game,\xe2\x80\x9d said Muniment, looking down at\r\nhim with a serious face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you think it\xe2\x80\x99s swagger, \xe2\x80\x98self-loaf\xe2\x80\x99 as Schinkel says. But it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Hyacinth asked: \xe2\x80\x9cIn God\xe2\x80\x99s name why don\xe2\x80\x99t we do something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh my child, to whom do you say it?\xe2\x80\x9d Eustache Poupin exclaimed,\r\nfolding his arms despairingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d said Muniment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the lot of us. There are plenty of them ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReady for what? There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be done here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHyacinth stared. \xe2\x80\x9cThen why the deuce do you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay I shan\xe2\x80\x99t come much more. It\xe2\x80\x99s a place in which you\xe2\x80\x99ve always\r\nseen too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen too much in you,\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth risked, gazing at his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s going to introduce us to Hoffendahl!\xe2\x80\x9d Schinkel\r\nexclaimed, putting away his pipe in a receptacle almost as large as a\r\nfiddle-case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you like to see the right man, Robinson, that is the real\r\nthing?\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment asked with the same rare grave sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe real thing?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth looked from one of his companions to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen it yet\xe2\x80\x94though you think you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you shown it me before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I had never seen you on the stump.\xe2\x80\x9d This was more lightly said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother the stump! I was trusting you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so. That gave me time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t come unless your mind\xe2\x80\x99s made up, _mon petit_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going now\xe2\x80\x94and to see Hoffendahl? Is _he_ the right man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHyacinth cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t shout it all over the place. He wants a perfect little\r\ngentleman, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re not one\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Muniment went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true? Are we all going?\xe2\x80\x9d Hyacinth eagerly went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, these two are in it. They\xe2\x80\x99re not very wise, but they\xe2\x80\x99re decent,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Muniment, looking at Poupin and Schinkel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre _you_ the real thing, Muniment?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hyacinth, catching this\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nMuniment dropped his eyes on him. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\xe2\x80\x99re the lamb of sacrifice he\r\nwants. It\xe2\x80\x99s at the other end of London. We must have a growler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe calm, my child; _me voici_!\xe2\x80\x9d And Poupin led their young friend out.\r\n\r\nThey all walked away from the \xe2\x80\x9cSun and Moon,\xe2\x80\x9d and it was not for\r\nsome five minutes that they encountered the four-wheeled cab which\r\nso deepened and dignified their purpose. After they were seated in it\r\nHyacinth learned that the \xe2\x80\x9cright man\xe2\x80\x9d was in London but for three days,\r\nwas liable to hurry away on the morrow, and was accustomed to receive\r\nvisits at all kinds of queer hours. It was getting to be midnight; the\r\ndrive seemed interminable to Hyacinth\xe2\x80\x99s impatience and curiosity. He\r\nsat next Muniment, who passed a strong arm round him, holding him all\r\nthe way as if for a tacit sign of indebtedness. This gave Hyacinth\r\npleasure till he began to wonder if it mightn\xe2\x80\x99t represent also the\r\ninstinct to make sure of him as against possible weak afterthoughts.\r\nThey all ended by sitting silent as the cab jogged along murky miles,\r\nand by the time it stopped our young man had wholly lost, in the\r\ndrizzling gloom, a sense of their whereabouts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
