Words are sometimes very poor exponents of such an event: but it\r\nhappens now and then, on the other hand, that a plain intimation\r\nexpresses too much, and suggests emotion and suffering which, in\r\nreality, have but little, if any, existence. Mrs Marjoribanks, poor\r\nlady, had been an invalid for many years; she had grown a little peevish\r\nin her loneliness, not feeling herself of much account in this world.\r\nThere are some rare natures that are content to acquiesce in the general\r\nneglect, and forget themselves when they find themselves forgotten; but\r\nit is unfortunately much more usual to take the plan adopted by Mrs\r\nMarjoribanks, who devoted all her powers, during the last ten years of\r\nher life, to the solacement and care of that poor self which other\r\npeople neglected. The consequence was, that when she disappeared from\r\nher sofa--except for the mere physical fact that she was no longer\r\nthere--no one, except her maid, whose occupation was gone, could have\r\nfound out much difference. Her husband, it is true, who had, somewhere,\r\nhidden deep in some secret corner of his physical organisation, the\r\nremains of a heart, experienced a certain sentiment of sadness when he\r\nre-entered the house from which she had gone away for ever. But Dr\r\nMarjoribanks was too busy a man to waste his feelings on a mere\r\nsentiment. His daughter, however, was only fifteen, and had floods of\r\ntears at her command, as was natural at that age. All the way home she\r\nrevolved the situation in her mind, which was considerably enlightened\r\nby novels and popular philosophy--for the lady at the head of Miss\r\nMarjoribanks school was a devoted admirer of _Friends in Council_, and\r\nwas fond of bestowing that work as a prize, with pencil-marks on the\r\nmargin--so that Lucilla\'s mind had been cultivated, and was brimful of\r\nthe best of sentiments. She made up her mind on her journey to a great\r\nmany virtuous resolutions; for, in such a case as hers, it was\r\nevidently the duty of an only child to devote herself to her father\'s\r\ncomfort, and become the sunshine of his life, as so many young persons\r\nof her age have been known to become in literature. Miss Marjoribanks\r\nhad a lively mind, and was capable of grasping all the circumstances of\r\nthe situation at a glance. Thus, between the outbreaks of her tears for\r\nher mother, it became apparent to her that she must sacrifice her own\r\nfeelings, and make a cheerful home for papa, and that a great many\r\nchanges would be necessary in the household--changes which went so far\r\nas even to extend to the furniture. Miss Marjoribanks sketched to\r\nherself, as she lay back in the corner of the railway carriage, with her\r\nveil down, how she would wind herself up to the duty of presiding at her\r\npapa\'s dinner-parties, and charming everybody by her good humour, and\r\nbrightness, and devotion to his comfort; and how, when it was all over,\r\nshe would withdraw and cry her eyes out in her own room, and be found in\r\nthe morning languid and worn-out, but always heroical, ready to go\r\ndownstairs and assist at dear papa\'s breakfast, and keep up her smiles\r\nfor him till he had gone out to his patients. Altogether the picture was\r\na very pretty one; and, considering that a great many young ladies in\r\ndeep mourning put force upon their feelings in novels, and maintain a\r\nsmile for the benefit of the unobservant male creatures of whom they\r\nhave the charge, the idea was not at all extravagant, considering that\r\nMiss Marjoribanks was but fifteen. She was not, however, exactly the\r\nkind of figure for this _mise en sc\xe8ne_. When her schoolfellows talked\r\nof her to their friends--for Lucilla was already an important personage\r\nat Mount Pleasant--the most common description they gave her was, that\r\nshe was "a large girl"; and there was great truth in the adjective. She\r\nwas not to be described as a tall girl--which conveys an altogether\r\ndifferent idea--but she was large in all particulars, full and\r\nwell-developed, with somewhat large features, not at all pretty as yet,\r\nthough it was known in Mount Pleasant that somebody had said that such a\r\nface might ripen into beauty, and become "grandiose," for anything\r\nanybody could tell. Miss Marjoribanks was not vain; but the word had\r\ntaken possession of her imagination, as was natural, and solaced her\r\nmuch when she made the painful discovery that her gloves were half a\r\nnumber larger, and her shoes a hair-breadth broader, than those of any\r\nof her companions; but the hands and feet were both perfectly well\r\nshaped; and being at the same time well clothed and plump, were much\r\nmore presentable and pleasant to look upon than the lean rudimentary\r\nschoolgirl hands with which they were surrounded. To add to these\r\nexcellences, Lucilla had a mass of hair which, if it could but have been\r\ncleared a little in its tint, would have been golden, though at present\r\nit was nothing more than tawny, and curly to exasperation. She wore it\r\nin large thick curls, which did not, however, float or wave, or do any\r\nof the graceful things which curls ought to do; for it had this\r\naggravating quality, that it would not grow long, but would grow\r\nridiculously, unmanageably thick, to the admiration of her companions,\r\nbut to her own despair, for there was no knowing what to do with those\r\nshort but ponderous locks. These were the external characteristics of\r\nthe girl who was going home to be a comfort to her widowed father, and\r\nmeant to sacrifice herself to his happiness. In the course of her rapid\r\njourney she had already settled upon everything that had to be done; or\r\nrather, to speak truly, had rehearsed everything, according to the habit\r\nalready acquired by a quick mind, a good deal occupied with itself.\r\nFirst, she meant to fall into her father\'s arms--forgetting, with that\r\nsingular facility for overlooking the peculiarities of others which\r\nbelongs to such a character, that Dr Marjoribanks was very little given\r\nto embracing, and that a hasty kiss on her forehead was the warmest\r\ncaress he had ever given his daughter--and then to rush up to the\r\nchamber of death and weep over dear mamma. "And to think I was not there\r\nto soothe her last moments!" Lucilla said to herself, with a sob, and\r\nwith feelings sufficiently real in their way. After this, the devoted\r\ndaughter made up her mind to come downstairs again, pale as death, but\r\nself-controlled, and devote herself to papa. Perhaps, if great emotion\r\nshould make him tearless, as such cases had been known, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks would steal into his arms unawares, and so surprise him\r\ninto weeping. All this went briskly through her mind, undeterred by the\r\nreflection that tears were as much out of the Doctor\'s way as embraces;\r\nand in this mood she sped swiftly along in the inspiration of her first\r\nsorrow, as she imagined, but in reality to suffer her first\r\ndisappointment, which was of a less soothing character than that mild\r\nand manageable grief.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Marjoribanks reached home her mother had been dead for\r\ntwenty-four hours; and her father was not at the door to receive her as\r\nshe had expected, but by the bedside of a patient in extremity, who\r\ncould not consent to go out of the world without the Doctor. This was a\r\nsad reversal of her intentions, but Lucilla was not the woman to be\r\ndisconcerted. She carried out the second part of her programme without\r\neither interference or sympathy, except from Mrs Marjoribanks\'s maid,\r\nwho had some hopes from the moment of her arrival. "I can\'t abear to\r\nthink as I\'m to be parted from you all, miss," sobbed the faithful\r\nattendant. "I\'ve lost the best missus as ever was, and I shouldn\'t mind\r\ngoing after her. Whenever any one gets a good friend in this world,\r\nthey\'re the first to be took away," said the weeping handmaiden, who\r\nnaturally saw her own loss in the most vivid light. "Ah, Ellis," cried\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, reposing her sorrow in the arms of this anxious\r\nattendant, "we must try to be a comfort to poor papa!"\r\n\r\nWith this end Lucilla made herself very troublesome to the sober-minded\r\nDoctor during those few dim days before the faint and daily lessening\r\nshadow of poor Mrs Marjoribanks was removed altogether from the house.\r\nWhen that sad ceremony had taken place, and the Doctor returned, serious\r\nenough, Heaven knows, to the great house, where the faded helpless\r\nwoman, who had notwithstanding been his love and his bride in other\r\ndays, lay no longer on the familiar sofa, the crisis arrived which Miss\r\nMarjoribanks had rehearsed so often, but after quite a different\r\nfashion. The widower was tearless, indeed, but not from excess of\r\nemotion. On the contrary, a painful heaviness possessed him when he\r\nbecame aware how little real sorrow was in his mind, and how small an\r\nactual loss was this loss of his wife, which bulked before the world as\r\nan event of just as much magnitude as the loss, for example, which poor\r\nMr Lake, the drawing-master, was at the same moment suffering. It was\r\neven sad, in another point of view, to think of a human creature passing\r\nout of the world, and leaving so little trace that she had ever been\r\nthere. As for the pretty creature whom Dr Marjoribanks had married, she\r\nhad vanished into thin air years and years ago. These thoughts were\r\nheavy enough--perhaps even more overwhelming than that grief which\r\ndevelops love to its highest point of intensity. But such were not\r\nprecisely the kind of reflections which could be solaced by paternal\r\n_attendrissement_ over a weeping and devoted daughter. It was May, and\r\nthe weather was warm for the season; but Lucilla had caused the fire to\r\nbe lighted in the large gloomy library where Dr Marjoribanks always sat\r\nin the evenings, with the idea that it would be "a comfort" to him;\r\nand, for the same reason, she had ordered tea to be served there,\r\ninstead of the dinner, for which her father, as she imagined, could have\r\nlittle appetite. When the Doctor went in to his favourite seclusion,\r\ntired and heated and sad--for even on the day of his wife\'s funeral the\r\nfavourite doctor of Carlingford had patients to think of--the very\r\nheaviness of his thoughts gave warmth to his indignation. He had longed\r\nfor the quiet and the coolness and the solitude of his library, apart\r\nfrom everybody; and when he found it radiant with firelight, tea set on\r\nthe table, and Lucilla crying by the fire, in her new crape, the effect\r\nupon a temper by no means perfect may be imagined. The unfortunate man\r\nthrew both the windows wide open and rang the bell violently, and gave\r\ninstant orders for the removal of the unnecessary fire and the\r\ntea-service. "Let me know when dinner is ready," he said, in a voice\r\nlike thunder; "and if Miss Marjoribanks wants a fire, let it be lighted\r\nin the drawing-room." Lucilla was so much taken by surprise by this\r\nsudden overthrow of her programme, that she submitted, as a girl of much\r\nless spirit might have done, and suffered herself and her fire and her\r\ntea-things to be dismissed upstairs, where she wept still more at sight\r\nof dear mamma\'s sofa, and where Ellis came to mingle her tears with\r\nthose of her young mistress, and to beg dear Miss Lucilla, for the sake\r\nof her precious \'elth and her dear papa, to be persuaded to take some\r\ntea. On the whole, master stood lessened in the eyes of all the\r\nhousehold by his ability to eat his dinner, and his resentment at having\r\nhis habitudes disturbed. "Them men would eat and drink if we was all in\r\nour graves," said the indignant cook, who indeed had a real grievance;\r\nand the outraged sentiment of the kitchen was avenged by a bad and hasty\r\ndinner, which the Doctor, though generally "very particular," swallowed\r\nwithout remark. About an hour afterwards he went upstairs to the\r\ndrawing-room, where Miss Marjoribanks was waiting for him, much less at\r\nease than she had expected to be. Though he gave a little sigh at the\r\nsight of his wife\'s sofa, he did not hesitate to sit down upon it, and\r\neven to draw it a little out of its position, which, as Lucilla\r\ndescribed afterwards, was like a knife going into her heart. Though,\r\nindeed, she had herself decided already, in the intervals of her tears,\r\nthat the drawing-room furniture had got very faded and shabby, and that\r\nit would be very expedient to have it renewed for the new reign of\r\nyouth and energy which was about to commence. As for the Doctor, though\r\nMiss Marjoribanks thought him insensible, his heart was heavy enough.\r\nHis wife had gone out of the world without leaving the least mark of her\r\nexistence, except in that large girl, whose spirits and forces were\r\nunbounded, but whose discretion at the present moment did not seem much\r\ngreater than her mother\'s. Instead of thinking of her as a comfort, the\r\nDoctor felt himself called upon to face a new and unexpected\r\nembarrassment. It would have been a satisfaction to him just then to\r\nhave been left to himself, and permitted to work on quietly at his\r\nprofession, and to write his papers for the _Lancet_, and to see his\r\nfriends now and then when he chose; for Dr Marjoribanks was not a man\r\nwho had any great need of sympathy by nature, or who was at all addicted\r\nto demonstrations of feeling; consequently, he drew his wife\'s sofa a\r\nlittle farther from the fire, and took his seat on it soberly, quite\r\nunaware that, by so doing, he was putting a knife into his daughter\'s\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"I hope you have had something to eat, Lucilla," he said; "don\'t get\r\ninto that foolish habit of flying to tea as a man flies to a dram. It\'s\r\na more innocent stimulant, but it\'s the same kind of intention. I am not\r\nso much against a fire; it has always a kind of cheerful look."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa," cried his daughter, with a flood of indignant tears, "you\r\ncan\'t suppose I want anything to look cheerful this dreadful day."\r\n\r\n"I am far from blaming you, my dear," said the Doctor; "it is natural\r\nyou should cry. I am sorry I did not write for my sister to come, who\r\nwould have taken care of you; but I dislike strangers in the house at\r\nsuch a time. However, I hope, Lucilla, you will soon feel yourself able\r\nto return to school; occupation is always the best remedy, and you will\r\nhave your friends and companions----"\r\n\r\n"Papa!" cried Miss Marjoribanks; and then she summoned courage, and\r\nrushed up to him, and threw herself and her clouds of crape on the\r\ncarpet at his side (and it may here be mentioned that Lucilla had seized\r\nthe opportunity to have her mourning made _long_, which had been the\r\ndesire of her heart, baffled by mamma and governess for at least a\r\nyear). "Papa!" she exclaimed with fervour, raising to him her\r\ntear-stained face, and clasping her fair plump hands, "oh, don\'t send me\r\naway! I was only a silly girl the other day, but _this_ has made me a\r\nwoman. Though I can never, never hope to take dear mamma\'s place, and\r\nbe--all--that she was to you, still I feel I can be a comfort to you if\r\nyou will let me. You shall not see me cry any more," cried Lucilla with\r\nenergy, rubbing away her tears. "I will never give way to my feelings. I\r\nwill ask for no companions--nor--nor anything. As for pleasure, that is\r\nall over. Oh, papa, you shall never see me regret anything, or wish for\r\nanything. I will give up everything in the world to be a comfort to\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\nThis address, which was utterly unexpected, drove Dr Marjoribanks to\r\ndespair. He said, "Get up, Lucilla;" but the devoted daughter knew\r\nbetter than to get up. She hid her face in her hands, and rested her\r\nhands upon her mother\'s sofa, where the Doctor was sitting; and the sobs\r\nof that emotion which she meant to control henceforward, echoed through\r\nthe room. "It is only for this once--I can--cannot help it," she cried.\r\nWhen her father found that he could neither soothe her, nor succeed in\r\nraising her, he got up himself, which was the only thing left to him,\r\nand began to walk about the room with hasty steps. Her mother, too, had\r\npossessed this dangerous faculty of tears; and it was not wonderful if\r\nthe sober-minded Doctor, roused for the first time to consider his\r\nlittle girl as a creature possessed of individual character, should\r\nrecognise, with a thrill of dismay, the appearance of the same qualities\r\nwhich had wearied his life out, and brought his youthful affections to\r\nan untimely end. Lucilla was, it is true, as different from her mother\r\nas summer from winter; but Dr Marjoribanks had no means of knowing that\r\nhis daughter was only doing her duty by him in his widowhood, according\r\nto a programme of filial devotion resolved upon, in accordance with the\r\nbest models, some days before.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when her sobs had ceased, her father returned and raised\r\nher up not unkindly, and placed her in her chair. In doing so, the\r\nDoctor put his finger by instinct upon Lucilla\'s pulse, which was\r\nsufficiently calm and regulated to reassure the most anxious parent. And\r\nthen a furtive momentary smile gleamed for a single instant round the\r\ncorners of his mouth.\r\n\r\n"It is very good of you to propose sacrificing yourself for me," he\r\nsaid; "and if you would sacrifice your excitement in the meantime, and\r\nlisten to me quietly, it would really be something--but you are only\r\nfifteen, Lucilla, and I have no wish to take you from school just now;\r\nwait till I have done. Your poor mother is gone, and it is very natural\r\nyou should cry; but you were a good child to her on the whole, which\r\nwill be a comfort to you. We did everything that could be thought of to\r\nprolong her days, and, when that was impossible, to lessen what she had\r\nto suffer; and we have every reason to hope," said the Doctor, as indeed\r\nhe was accustomed to say in the exercise of his profession to mourning\r\nrelatives, "that she\'s far better off now than if she had been with us.\r\nWhen that is said, I don\'t know that there is anything more to add. I am\r\nnot fond of sacrifices, either one way or another; and I\'ve a great\r\nobjection to any one making a sacrifice for me----"\r\n\r\n"But, oh, papa, it would be no sacrifice," said Lucilla, "if you would\r\nonly let me be a comfort to you!"\r\n\r\n"That is just where it is, my dear," said the steady Doctor; "I have\r\nbeen used to be left a great deal to myself; and I am not prepared to\r\nsay that the responsibility of having you here without a mother to take\r\ncare of you, and all your lessons interrupted, would not neutralise any\r\ncomfort you might be. You see," said Dr Marjoribanks, trying to soften\r\nmatters a little, "a man is what his habits make him; and I have been\r\nused to be left a great deal to myself. It answers in some cases, but I\r\ndoubt if it would answer with me."\r\n\r\nAnd then there was a pause, in which Lucilla wept and stifled her tears\r\nin her handkerchief, with a warmer flood of vexation and disappointment\r\nthan even her natural grief had produced. "Of course, papa, if I can\'t\r\nbe any comfort--I will--go back to school," she sobbed, with a touch of\r\nsullenness which did not escape the Doctor\'s ear.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, you will certainly go back to school," said the\r\nperemptory father; "I never had any doubt on that subject. You can stay\r\nover Sunday and rest yourself. Monday or Tuesday will be time enough to\r\ngo back to Mount Pleasant; and now you had better ring the bell, and get\r\nsomebody to bring you something--or I\'ll see to that when I go\r\ndownstairs. It\'s getting late, and this has been a fatiguing day. I\'ll\r\nsend you up some negus, and I think you had better go to bed."\r\n\r\nAnd with these commonplace words, Dr Marjoribanks withdrew in calm\r\npossession of the field. As for Lucilla, she obeyed him, and betook\r\nherself to her own room, and swallowed her negus with a sense, not only\r\nof defeat, but of disappointment and mortification which was very\r\nunpleasant. To go back again and be an ordinary schoolgirl, after the\r\npomp and woe in which she had come away, was naturally a painful\r\nthought; she who had ordered her mourning to be made long, and\r\ncontemplated new furniture in the drawing-room, and expected to be\r\nmistress of her father\'s house, not to speak of the still dearer\r\nprivilege of being a comfort to him; and now, after all, her active mind\r\nwas to be condemned over again to verbs and chromatic scales, though she\r\nfelt within herself capacities so much more extended. Miss Marjoribanks\r\ndid not by any means learn by this defeat to take the characters of the\r\nother person\xe6 in her little drama into consideration, when she rehearsed\r\nher pet scenes hereafter--for that is a knowledge slowly acquired--but\r\nshe was wise enough to know when resistance was futile; and like most\r\npeople of lively imagination, she had a power of submitting to\r\ncircumstances when it became impossible to change them. Thus she\r\nconsented to postpone her reign, if not with a good grace, yet still\r\nwithout foolish resistance, and retired with the full honours of war.\r\nShe had already rearranged all the details, and settled upon all the\r\nmeans possible of preparing herself for what she called the charge of\r\nthe establishment when her final emancipation took place, before she\r\nreturned to school. "Papa thought me too young," she said, when she\r\nreached Mount Pleasant, "though it was dreadful to come away and leave\r\nhim alone with only the servants; but, dear Miss Martha, you will let me\r\nlearn all about political economy and things, to help me manage\r\neverything; for now that dear mamma is gone, there is nobody but me to\r\nbe a comfort to papa."\r\n\r\nAnd by this means Miss Marjoribanks managed to influence the excellent\r\nwoman who believed in _Friends in Council_, and to direct the future\r\ntenor of her own education; while, at least, in that one moment of\r\nopportunity, she had achieved long dresses, which was a visible mark of\r\nwomanhood, and a step which could not be retraced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter II_\r\n\r\n\r\nDr Marjoribanks was so far from feeling the lack of his daughter\'s\r\npowers of consolation, that he kept her at Mount Pleasant for three\r\nyears longer, during which time it is to be supposed he managed to be\r\ncomfortable after a benighted fashion--good enough for a man of fifty,\r\nwho had come to an end of his illusions. To be sure, there were in the\r\nworld, and even in Carlingford, kind women, who would not have objected\r\nto take charge of the Doctor and his "establishment," and be a comfort\r\nto him; but, on the whole, it was undeniable that he managed tolerably\r\nwell in external matters, and gave very good men\'s dinners, and kept\r\neverything in perfect order, so far as it went. Naturally the fairer\r\npart of existence was left out altogether in that grim, though\r\nwell-ordered house; but then he was only a man and a doctor, and knew no\r\nbetter; and while the feminine part of Grange Lane regarded him with\r\nnatural pity, not only for what he lacked, but for a still more sad\r\ndefect, his total want of perception on the subject, their husbands and\r\nfathers rather liked to dine with the Doctor, and brought home accounts\r\nof sauces which were enough to drive any woman to despair. Some of the\r\nladies of Grange Lane--Mrs Chiley, for example, who was fond of good\r\nliving herself, and liked, as she said, "a little variety"--laid siege\r\nto the Doctor, and did their best to coax his receipts out of him; but\r\nDr Marjoribanks knew better than that. He gave all the credit to his\r\ncook, like a man of sense; and as that functionary was known in\r\nCarlingford to be utterly regardless and unprincipled in respect to\r\ngravy-beef, and the materials for "stock," or "consomm\xe9," as some people\r\ncalled it, society was disinclined to exert its ordinary arts to seduce\r\nso great an artiste from the kitchen of her indulgent master. And then\r\nthere were other ladies who took a different tone. "Dr Marjoribanks,\r\npoor man, has nothing but his table to take up his mind," said Mrs\r\nCentum, who had six children; "I never heard that the heart could be\r\nnourished upon sauces, for my part; and for a man who has his children\'s\r\nfuture to think of, I must say I am surprised at you, Mr Centum." As\r\nfor young Mrs Woodburn, her reply was still more decisive, though milder\r\nin its tone. "Poor cook! I am so sorry for her," said the gentle young\r\nmatron. "You know you always like something for breakfast, Charles; and\r\nthen there is the children\'s dinner, and our lunch, and the servants\'\r\ndinner, so that the poor thing is worn out before she comes to what\r\n_you_ call the great event of the day; and you know how angry you were\r\nwhen I asked for a kitchen-maid for her, poor soul." The consequence of\r\nall this was, that Dr Marjoribanks remained unrivalled in Grange Lane in\r\nthis respect at least. When rumours arose in Carlingford of a possible\r\nsecond marriage for the Doctor--and such rumours naturally arose three\r\nor four times in the course of the three years--the men of Grange Lane\r\nsaid, "Heaven forbid!" "No wife in the world could replace Nancy," said\r\nColonel Chiley, after that fervent aspiration, "and none could put up\r\nwith her;" while, on the other side, there were curious speculations\r\nafloat as to the effect upon the house, and especially the table, of the\r\ndaughter\'s return. When a young woman comes to be eighteen it is\r\ndifficult to keep her at school; and though the Doctor had staved off\r\nthe danger for the moment, by sending Lucilla off along with one of her\r\nschoolfellows, whose family was going abroad, to make orthodox\r\nacquaintance with all the Swiss mountains, and all the Italian capitals,\r\nstill that was plainly an expedient for the moment; and a new mistress\r\nto the house, which had got along so well without any mistress, was\r\ninevitable. So that it cannot be denied Miss Marjoribanks\'s advent was\r\nregarded in Carlingford with as much interest and curiosity as she could\r\nhave wished. For it was already known that the Doctor\'s daughter was not\r\na mild young lady, easy to be controlled; but, on the contrary, had all\r\nthe energy and determination to have her own way, which naturally\r\nbelonged to a girl who possessed a considerable chin, and a mouth which\r\ncould shut, and tightly curling tawny tresses, which were still more\r\ndetermined than she was to be arranged only according to their\r\ninclination. It was even vaguely reported that some passages-of-arms had\r\noccurred between Miss Marjoribanks and the redoubtable Nancy during the\r\nshort and uncertain opportunities which were afforded by holidays; and\r\nthe community, accordingly, regarded as an affair of almost municipal\r\nimportance Lucilla\'s final return home.\r\n\r\nAs for the young lady herself, though she was at school, she was\r\nconscious of having had a career not without importance, even during\r\nthese three years of pupilage. Since the day when she began to read\r\npolitical economy with Miss Martha Blount, who, though the second\r\nsister, was the directing spirit of the establishment, Lucilla had\r\nexercised a certain influence upon the school itself which was very\r\nsatisfactory. Perhaps her course might be a little deficient in grace,\r\nbut grace, after all, is but a secondary quality; and, at all events,\r\nMiss Marjoribanks went straight forward, leaving an unquestionable wake\r\nbehind her, and running down with indifference the little skiffs in her\r\nway. She was possessed by nature of that kind of egotism, or rather\r\negoism, which is predestined to impress itself, by its perfect reality\r\nand good faith, upon the surrounding world. There are people who talk of\r\nthemselves, and think of themselves, as it were, under protest, and with\r\ndepreciation, not actually able to convince themselves that anybody\r\ncares; but Lucilla, for her part, had the calmest and most profound\r\nconviction that, when she discussed her own doings and plans and\r\nclevernesses, she was bringing forward the subject most interesting to\r\nher audience as well as to herself. Such a conviction is never without\r\nits fruits. To be sure, there were always one or two independent spirits\r\nwho revolted; but for the crowd, it soon became impressed with a\r\nprofound belief in the creed which Miss Marjoribanks supported so\r\nfirmly. This conviction of the importance and value of her own\r\nproceedings made Lucilla, as she grew older, a copious and amusing\r\nconversationalist--a rank which few people who are indifferent to, or do\r\nnot believe in, themselves can attain to. One thing she had made up her\r\nmind to as soon as she should return home, and that was to revolutionise\r\nsociety in Carlingford. On the whole, she was pleased with the success\r\nof the Doctor\'s dinners, though a little piqued to think that they owed\r\nnothing to herself; but Lucilla, whose instinct of government was of the\r\ntrue despotic order, and who had no objection to stoop, if by that means\r\nshe could conquer, had no such designs against Nancy as were attributed\r\nto her by the expectant audience in Carlingford. On the contrary, she\r\nwas quite as much disposed as her father was to take Nancy for\r\nprime-minister; for Miss Marjoribanks, though too much occupied with\r\nherself to divine the characteristic points of other people, had a\r\nsensible and thorough belief in those superficial general truths which\r\nmost minds acquiesce in, without taking the trouble to believe. She\r\nknew, for example, that there was a great difference between the\r\nbrilliant society of London, or of Paris, which appears in books, where\r\nwomen have generally the best of it, and can rule in their own right;\r\nand even the very best society of a country town, where husbands are\r\nvery commonly unmanageable, and have a great deal more of their own way\r\nin respect to the houses they will or will not go to, than is good for\r\nthat inferior branch of the human family. Miss Marjoribanks had the good\r\nsense to see and appreciate these details; and she knew that a good\r\ndinner was a great attraction to a man, and that, in Carlingford at\r\nleast, when these refractory mortals were secured, the wives and\r\ndaughters would necessarily follow. Besides, as is not uncommon with\r\nwomen who are clever women, and aware of the fact, Miss Marjoribanks\r\npreferred the society of men, and rather liked to say so. With all these\r\nintentions in her mind, it may be imagined that she received coolly\r\nenough the invitation of her friend to join in the grand tour, and the\r\nready consent given by her father when he heard of it. But even the\r\ngrand tour was a tool which Lucilla saw how to make use of. Nowadays,\r\nwhen people go everywhere, an untravelled woman would find it so much\r\nthe harder to keep up the _r\xf4le_ of a leader of society to which she had\r\ndevoted herself; and she felt to the depth of her heart the endless\r\nadvantage to her future conversation of the experiences to be acquired\r\nin Switzerland and Italy. But she rejected with scorn the insinuation of\r\nother accidents that might occur on the way.\r\n\r\n"You will never come back again, Lucilla," said one of her companions;\r\n"you will marry some enchanting Italian with a beautiful black beard,\r\nand a voice like an angel; and he\'ll sing serenades to you, and do all\r\nsorts of things: oh, how I wish I was you!"\r\n\r\n"That may be," said Miss Marjoribanks, "but I shall never marry an\r\nItalian, my dear. I don\'t think I shall marry anybody for a long time. I\r\nwant to amuse myself. I wonder, by the way, if it would improve my voice\r\nto take lessons in Italy. Did I ever tell you of the Italian nobleman\r\nthat was so very attentive to me that Christmas I spent at Sissy\r\nVernon\'s? He was very handsome. I suppose they really are all very\r\nhandsome--except, of course, the Italian masters; but I did not pay any\r\nattention to him. My object, dear, and you know it, is to return home as\r\nwell educated as possible, to be a comfort to dear papa."\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear Lucilla," said the sympathetic girl, "and it is so good of\r\nyou; but do tell me about the Italian nobleman--what did he look\r\nlike--and what did he say?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, as for what he said, that is quite a different matter," said\r\nLucilla; "but it is not what they say, but the way they say it, that is\r\nthe fun. I did not give him the least encouragement. As for that, I\r\nthink a girl can always stop a man when she does not care for him. It\r\ndepends on whether you intend him to commit himself or not," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks continued, and fixed her eyes meditatively, but intently,\r\nupon her friend\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Whether I intend?--oh, goodness, Lucilla! how can you speak so? as if I\r\never intended anything," said her companion, confused, yet flattered, by\r\nthe possibility; to which the elder sage answered calmly, with all the\r\ncomposure in the world.\r\n\r\n"No, I never supposed you did; I was thinking of myself," said Lucilla,\r\nas if, indeed that was the only reasonable subject of thought. "You know\r\nI have seen a good deal of the world, one way and another, with going to\r\nspend the holidays, and I could tell you quantities of things. It is\r\nquite astonishing how much experience one gets. When I was at Midhurst,\r\nat Easter, there was my cousin Tom, who was quite ridiculous; I declare\r\nhe nearly brought things to an explanation, Fanny--which, of course, of\r\nall things in the world I most wanted to avoid."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but why, Lucilla?" cried Fanny, full of delight and wonder; "I do\r\nso want to know what they say when they make--explanations, as you call\r\nthem. Oh, do tell me, Lucilla, why?"\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Miss Marjoribanks, "a cousin of my own! and only\r\ntwenty-one, and reading for the bar! In the first place, my aunt would\r\nnever have forgiven me, and I am very fond of my aunt. It\'s so nice to\r\nlike all one\'s relations. I know some girls who can\'t bear theirs. And\r\nthen a boy not much older than myself, with nothing but what his mother\r\npleases! Fortunately he did not just say the words, so I escaped that\r\ntime; but, of course, I could understand perfectly what he meant."\r\n\r\n"But, oh, Lucilla, tell me the words," cried the persistent questioner;\r\n"do, there\'s a darling! I am quite sure you have heard them--and I\r\nshould so like to know exactly what they say;--do they go down on their\r\nknees?--or do they try to take your hand as they always do in\r\nnovels?--or what do they do?--Oh, Lucilla, tell me, there\'s a dear!"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," said Lucilla; "I only want you to understand that I am not\r\nlikely to fall into any danger of that sort. My only ambition, Fanny, as\r\nI have told you often, is to go home to Carlingford and be a comfort to\r\ndear papa."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Fanny, kissing her devoted companion, "and it is so good of\r\nyou, dear; but then you cannot go on all your life being a comfort to\r\ndear papa," said the intelligent girl, bethinking herself, and looking\r\nagain with some curiosity in Lucilla\'s face.\r\n\r\n"We must leave that to Providence," said Miss Marjoribanks, with a sense\r\nof paying a compliment to Providence in entrusting it with such a\r\nresponsibility. "I have always been guided for the best hitherto," she\r\ncontinued, with an innocent and unintentional profanity, which sounded\r\nsolemn to her equally innocent companion, "and I don\'t doubt I shall be\r\nso till the end."\r\n\r\nFrom which it will be perceived that Miss Marjoribanks was of the\r\nnumerous class of religionists who keep up civilities with heaven, and\r\npay all the proper attentions, and show their respect for the divine\r\ngovernment in a manner befitting persons who know the value of their own\r\napprobation. The conversation dropped at this point; for Lucilla was too\r\nimportant a person to be left to the undivided possession of an\r\ninquisitive innocent like Fanny Middleton, who was only sixteen, and had\r\nnever had even a flirtation in her own person. There were no Carlingford\r\ngirls at Mount Pleasant, except poor little Rose Lake, the\r\ndrawing-master\'s second daughter, who had been received on Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s recommendation, and who heard the little children their\r\ngeography and reading, and gave them little lessons in drawing, by way\r\nof paying for her own education; but then Rose was entirely out of Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s way, and could never count for anything in her designs\r\nfor the future. The girls at Mount Pleasant were good girls on the\r\nwhole, and were rather improved by the influence of Lucilla, who was\r\nextremely good-natured, and, so long as her superiority was duly\r\nacknowledged, was ready to do anything for anybody--so that Rose Lake\r\nwas not at all badly off in her inferior position. She could be made\r\nuseful too, which was a great point in her favour; and Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, who possessed by nature some of the finest qualities of a\r\nruler, instinctively understood and appreciated the instruments that\r\ncame to her hand. As for Rose, she had been brought up at the School of\r\nDesign in Carlingford, of which, under the supervision of the\r\nauthorities who, in those days, inhabited Marlborough House, Mr Lake was\r\nthe master. Rose was the pride of the school in the peaceable days\r\nbefore her mother died; she did not know much else, poor child, except\r\nnovels, but her copies "from the round" filled her father with\r\nadmiration, and her design for a Honiton-lace flounce, a spirited\r\ncomposition of dragons\' tails and the striking plant called teazle,\r\nwhich flourishes in the neighbourhood of Carlingford (for Mr Lake had\r\nleanings towards Preraphaelitism), was thought by the best judges to\r\nshow a wonderful amount of feeling for art, and just missed being\r\nselected for the prize. A girl with such a talent was naturally much\r\nappreciated in Mount Pleasant. She made the most charming design for\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s handkerchief--"Lucilla," in Gothic characters,\r\nenclosed in a wreath of forget-me-nots, skilfully combined with\r\nthistle-leaves, which Rose took great pains to explain were so much\r\nbetter adapted to ornamentation than foliage of a less distinct\r\ncharacter; and the young draftswoman was so charmed by Lucilla\'s\r\nenthusiastic admiration, that she volunteered to work the design in the\r\ncambric, which was a much more serious matter. This was on the eve of\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s final departure from school. She was to spend a year\r\nabroad, to the envy of all whom she left behind; but for herself Lucilla\r\nwas not elated. She thought it very probable that she would ascend Mont\r\nBlanc as far as the Grands Mulets at least, and, of course, in spring,\r\ngo up Vesuvius, having got through the Carnival and Miserere and all the\r\nballs in Rome; but none of these things moved her out of her usual\r\ncomposure. She took it all in the way of business, as she had taken her\r\nFrench and her German and her singing and her political economy. As she\r\nstepped into the steamboat at Dover which was to convey her to scenes so\r\nnew, Lucilla felt more and more that she who held the reorganisation of\r\nsociety in Carlingford in her hands was a woman with a mission. She was\r\ngoing abroad as the heir-apparent went to America and the Holy Land, to\r\ncomplete her education, and fit herself, by an examination of the\r\npeculiarities of other nations, for an illustrious and glorious reign at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter III_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be well to seize the opportunity of Miss Marjoribanks\'s travels,\r\nthrough which it is unnecessary to follow her, as they have nothing\r\nparticular to do with the legitimate history of her great undertaking,\r\nto explain a little the state of affairs in Carlingford before this\r\ndistinguished revolutionary began her labours. It is something like\r\ngoing back into the prehistoric period--those ages of the flint, which\r\nonly ingenious quarrymen and learned geologists can elucidate--to recall\r\nthe social condition of the town before Miss Marjoribanks began her\r\nThursday evenings, before St Roque\'s Chapel was built or thought of,\r\nwhile Mr Bury, the Evangelical Rector, was still in full activity, and\r\nbefore old Mr Tufton, at Salem Chapel (who sometimes drank tea at the\r\nRectory, and thus had a kind of clandestine entrance into the dim\r\noutskirts of that chaos which was then called society), had his first\r\n"stroke." From this latter circumstance alone the entirely disorganised\r\ncondition of affairs will be visible at a glance. It is true, Mr\r\nVincent, who succeeded Mr Tufton, was received by Lady Western, in days\r\nwhen public opinion had made great advances; but then Lady Western was\r\nthe most good-natured creature in the world, and gave an invitation,\r\nwhen it happened to come into her head, without the least regard for the\r\nconsequences; and, after all, Mr Vincent was very nice-looking and\r\nclever, and quite presentable. Fortunately, however, the period to which\r\nwe allude was prior to the entrance of Lady Western into Grange Lane.\r\nShe was a very pretty woman, and knew how to look like a lady of\r\nfashion, which is always of importance; but she was terribly\r\ninconsequent, as Miss Marjoribanks said, and her introductions were not\r\nin the least to be depended upon. She was indeed quite capable of\r\ninviting a family of retired drapers to meet the best people in Grange\r\nLane, for no better reason than to gratify her prot\xe9g\xe9s, which, of\r\ncourse, was a proceeding calculated to strike at the roots of all\r\nsociety. Fortunately for Carlingford, its reorganisation was in abler\r\nhands. Affairs were in an utterly chaotic state at the period when this\r\nrecord commences. There was nothing which could be properly called a\r\ncentre in the entire town. To be sure, Grange Lane was inhabited, as at\r\npresent, by the best families in Carlingford; but then, without\r\norganisation, what good does it do to have a number of people together?\r\nFor example, Mr Bury was utterly unqualified to take any lead. Mrs Bury\r\nhad been dead a long time, and the daughters were married, and the\r\nRector\'s maiden sister, who lived with him, was entirely of his own way\r\nof thinking, and asked people to tea-parties, which were like\r\nMethodists\' class-meetings, and where Mr Tufton was to be met with, and\r\nsometimes other Dissenters, to whom the Rector gave what he called the\r\nright hand of fellowship. But he never gave anything else to society,\r\nexcept weak tea and thin bread-and-butter, which was fare, the ladies\r\nsaid, which the gentlemen did not relish. "I never can induce Charles to\r\ngo out to tea," said young Mrs Woodburn piteously; "he won\'t, and there\r\nis an end of it. After dinner he thinks of nothing but an easy-chair and\r\nthe papers; and, my dear Miss Bury, what can I do?" "It is a great pity,\r\nmy dear, that your husband\'s carelessness should deprive you of the\r\nbenefit of Christian conversation; but, to be sure, it is your duty to\r\nstay with him, and I hope it will be made up to you at home," Miss Bury\r\nwould say. As for the Rector, his favourites were devoted to him; and as\r\nhe always saw enough of familiar faces at his sister\'s tea-parties, he\r\ntook no account of the defaulters. Then there was Dr Marjoribanks, who\r\ngave only dinners, to which naturally, as there was no lady in the\r\nhouse, ladies could not be invited, and who, besides, was rather a\r\ndrawback than a benefit to society, since he made the men quite\r\nintolerable, and filled them with such expectations, in the way of\r\ncookery, that they never were properly content with a good family dinner\r\nafter. Then the ladies, from whom something might justly have been\r\nexpected in the way of making society pleasant--such as Mrs Centum and\r\nMrs Woodburn, for example, who had everything they could desire, and the\r\nmost liberal housekeeping allowances--were either incapacitated by\r\ncircumstances (which was a polite term in use at Carlingford, and meant\r\nbabies) or by character. Mrs Woodburn liked nothing so well as to sit by\r\nthe fire and read novels, and "take off" her neighbours, when any one\r\ncalled on her; and, of course, the lady who was her audience on one\r\noccasion, left with the comfortable conviction that next time she would\r\nbe the victim; a circumstance which, indeed, did not make the offender\r\nunpopular--for there were very few people in Carlingford who could be\r\namusing, even at the expense of their neighbours--but made it quite\r\nimpossible that she should ever do anything in the way of knitting\r\npeople together, and making a harmonious whole out of the scraps and\r\nfragments of society. As for Mrs Chiley, she was old, and had not energy\r\nenough for such an undertaking; and, besides, she had no children, and\r\ndisliked bustle and trouble, and was of opinion that the Colonel never\r\nenjoyed his dinner if he had more than four people to help him to eat\r\nit; and, in short, you might have gone over Grange Lane, house by house,\r\nfinding a great deal of capital material, but without encountering a\r\nsingle individual capable of making anything out of it. Such was the\r\nlamentable condition, at the moment this history commences, of society\r\nin Carlingford.\r\n\r\nAnd yet nobody could say that there were not very good elements to make\r\nsociety with. When you add to a man capable of giving excellent dinners,\r\nlike Dr Marjoribanks, another man like young Mr Cavendish, Mrs\r\nWoodburn\'s brother, who was a wit and a man of fashion, and belonged to\r\none of the best clubs in town, and brought down gossip with the bloom on\r\nit to Grange Lane; and when you join to Mrs Centum, who was always so\r\ngood and so much out of temper that it was safe to calculate on\r\nsomething amusing from her, the languid but trenchant humour of Mrs\r\nWoodburn--not to speak of their husbands, who were perfectly available\r\nfor the background, and all the nephews and cousins and grand-children,\r\nwho constantly paid visits to old Mr Western and Colonel Chiley; and the\r\nBrowns, when they were at home, with their floating suite of admirers;\r\nand the young ladies who sang, and the young ladies who sketched, and\r\nthe men who went out with the hounds, when business permitted them; and\r\nthe people who came about the town when there was an election; and the\r\nbarristers who made the circuit; and the gay people who came to the\r\nraces; not to speak of the varying chances of curates, who could talk or\r\nplay the piano, with which Mr Bury favoured his parishioners--for he\r\nchanged his curates very often; and the occasional visits of the lesser\r\ncounty people, and the country clergymen;--it will be plainly apparent\r\nthat all that was wanting to Carlingford was a master-hand to blend\r\nthese different elements. There had even been a few feeble preliminary\r\nattempts at this great work, which had failed, as such attempts always\r\nfail when they are premature, and when the real agent of the change is\r\nalready on the way; but preparations and presentiments had taken vague\r\npossession of the mind of the town, as has always been observed to be\r\nthe case before a great revolution, or when a man destined to put his\r\nmark on his generation, as the newspapers say, is about to appear. To be\r\nsure, it was not a man this time, but Miss Marjoribanks; but the\r\natmosphere thrilled and trembled to the advent of the new luminary all\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nYet, at the same time, the world of Carlingford had not the least idea\r\nof the real quarter from which the sovereign intelligence which was to\r\ndevelop it from chaos into order and harmony was, _effectivement_, to\r\ncome. Some people had hoped in Mrs Woodburn before she fell into her\r\npresent languor of appearance and expression; and a great many people\r\nhoped in Mr Cavendish\'s wife, if he married, as he was said to intend to\r\ndo; for this gentleman, who was in the habit of describing himself, no\r\ndoubt, very truthfully, as one of the Cavendishes, was a person of great\r\nconsideration in Grange Lane; and some hoped in a new Rector, for it was\r\napparent that Mr Bury could not last very long. Thus, with the ordinary\r\nshort-sightedness of the human species, Carlingford blinded itself, and\r\nturned its eyes in every direction in the world rather than in that of\r\nthe Swiss mountains, which were being climbed at that moment by a large\r\nand blooming young woman, with tawny short curls and alert decided\r\nmovements; so little do we know what momentous issues may hang upon the\r\nmost possible accident! Had that energetic traveller slipped but an inch\r\nfarther upon the _mer de glace_--had she taken that other step which she\r\nwas with difficulty persuaded not to take on the Wengern Alp--there\r\nwould have been an end of all the hopes of social importance for\r\nCarlingford. But the good fairies took care of Lucilla and her mission,\r\nand saved her from the precipice and the crevasses; and instinctively\r\nthe air at home got note of what was coming, and whispered the news\r\nmysteriously through the keyholes. "Miss Marjoribanks is coming home,"\r\nthe unsuspecting male public said to itself as it returned from Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s dinners, with a certain distressing, but mistaken\r\npresentiment, that these delights were to come to an end; and the ladies\r\nrepeated the same piece of news, conjoining with it benevolent\r\nintimations of their intention to call upon her, and make the poor thing\r\nfeel herself at home. "Perhaps she may be amusing," Mrs Woodburn was\r\ngood enough to add; but these words meant only that perhaps Lucilla, who\r\nwas coming to set them all right, was worthy of being placed in the\r\nsatirist\'s collection along with Mrs Centum and Mrs Chiley. Thus, while\r\nthe town ripened more and more for her great mission, and the ignorant\r\nhuman creatures, who were to be her subjects, showed their usual\r\nblindness and ignorance, the time drew nearer and nearer for Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter IV_\r\n\r\n\r\n"My daughter is coming home, Nancy," said Dr Marjoribanks. "You will\r\nhave to make preparations for her immediately. So far as I can make out\r\nfrom this letter, she will arrive to-morrow by the half-past five\r\ntrain."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," said Nancy, with the tone of a woman who makes the best of\r\na misfortune, "it ain\'t every young lady as would have the sense to fix\r\nan hour like that. Ladies is terrible tiresome in that way; they\'ll come\r\nin the middle o\' the day, when a body don\'t know in the world what to\r\nhave for them; or they\'ll come at night, when a body\'s tired, and ain\'t\r\ngot the heart to go into a supper. There was always a deal of sense in\r\nMiss Lucilla, when she hadn\'t got nothing in her head."\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Dr Marjoribanks, who was rather relieved to have got\r\nthrough the announcement so easily. "You will see that her room is\r\nready, and everything comfortable; and, of course, to-morrow she and I\r\nwill dine alone."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Nancy; but this assent was not given in the decisive\r\ntone of a woman whose audience was over; and then she was seized with a\r\ndesire to arrange in a more satisfactory manner the cold beef on the\r\nsideboard. When she had secured this little interval for thought, she\r\nreturned again to the table, where her master ate his breakfast, with a\r\npresentiment. "If you please, sir," said Nancy, "not to give you no\r\nvexation nor trouble, which every one knows as it has been the aim o\' my\r\nlife to spare you, as has so much on your mind. But it\'s best to settle\r\nafore commencing, and then we needn\'t have no heartburning. If you\r\nplease, am I to take my orders of Miss Lucilla, or of you, as I\'ve\r\nalways been used to? In the missus\'s time," said Nancy, with modest\r\nconfidence, "as was a good missus, and never gave no trouble as long as\r\nshe had her soup and her jelly comfortable, it was always you as said\r\nwhat there was to be for dinner. I don\'t make no objection to doing up a\r\nnice little luncheon for Miss Lucilla, and giving a little more thought\r\nnow and again to the sweets; but it ain\'t my part to tell you, sir, as a\r\nlady\'s taste, and more special a young lady\'s, ain\'t to be expected to\r\nbe the same as yours and mine as has been cultivated like. I\'m not one\r\nas likes contention," continued the domestic oracle, "but I couldn\'t\r\nabear to see a good master put upon; and if it should be as Miss Lucilla\r\nsets her mind upon messes as ain\'t got no taste in them, and\r\nmilk-puddings and stuff, like the most of the ladies, I\'d just like to\r\nknow out of your own mouth, afore the commencement, what I\'m to do?"\r\n\r\nDr Marjoribanks was so moved by this appeal that he laid down his knife\r\nand contemplated the alarming future with some dismay. "It is to be\r\nhoped Miss Lucilla will know better," he said. "She has a great deal of\r\ngood sense, and it is to be hoped that she will be wise enough to\r\nconsult the tastes of the house."\r\n\r\nBut the Doctor was not to be let off so easily. "As you say, sir,\r\neverything\'s to be hoped," said Nancy steadily; "but there\'s a-many\r\nladies as don\'t seem to me to have got no taste to their mouths; and it\r\nain\'t as if it was a thing that could be left to hopes. Supposin\' as it\r\ncomes to that, sir, what am I to do?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Doctor, who was himself a little puzzled, "you know\r\nMiss Lucilla is nineteen, Nancy, and my only child, and the natural\r\nmistress of the house."\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Nancy austerely, "them is things as it ain\'t needful to\r\nname; that ain\'t the question as I was asking. Supposin\' as things come\r\nto such a point, what am I to do?"\r\n\r\n"Bless me! it\'s half-past nine," said the Doctor, "and I have an\r\nappointment. You can come just as usual when we are at breakfast, that\r\nwill be the best way," he said as he went out at the door, and chuckled\r\na little to himself when he felt he had escaped. "Lucilla is her\r\nmother\'s daughter, it is true," he said to himself when he had got into\r\nthe safe seclusion of his brougham, with a degree of doubt in his tone\r\nwhich was startling, to say the least of it, from the lips of a medical\r\nman; "but she is my child all the same," he added briskly, with\r\nreturning confidence; and in this conviction there was something which\r\nreassured the Doctor. He rubbed his hands as he bowled along to his\r\nappointment, and thought within himself that if she turned out a girl of\r\nspirit, as he expected, it would be good fun to see Lucilla\'s struggle\r\nwith Nancy for the veritable reins of government. If Dr Marjoribanks had\r\nentertained any positive apprehensions that his dinners would be spoiled\r\nin consequence, his amusement would have come to an abrupt conclusion;\r\nbut he trusted entirely in Nancy and a little in Lucilla, and suffered\r\nhis long upper-lip to relax at the thought without much fear.\r\n\r\nHer father had not returned from the labours of his long day when\r\nLucilla arrived, but he made his last visits on foot in order to be able\r\nto send the brougham for her, which was a great thing for the Doctor to\r\ndo. There was, indeed, a mutual respect between the two, who were not\r\nnecessary to each other\'s comfort, it is true, as such near relations\r\nsometimes are; but who, at the same time, except on the sole occasion of\r\nMrs Marjoribanks\'s death, had never misunderstood each other, as\r\nsometimes happens. This time Miss Marjoribanks was rather pleased, on\r\nthe whole, that the Doctor did not come to meet her. At other times she\r\nhad been a visitor; now she had come into her kingdom, and had no desire\r\nto be received like a guest. A sense of coming home, warmer than she\r\nremembered to have felt before, came into Lucilla\'s active mind as she\r\nstepped into the brougham. Not that the words bore any special tender\r\nmeaning, notwithstanding that it was the desire of her heart, well known\r\nto all her friends, to live henceforward as a comfort to dear papa, but\r\nthat now at last she was coming into her kingdom, and entering the\r\ndomain in which she intended her will to be law. After living for a year\r\nwith friends whose arrangements (much inferior to those which she could\r\nhave made had she had the power) she had to acquiesce in, and whose\r\ndomestic economy could only be criticised up to a certain point, it was\r\nnaturally a pleasure to Miss Marjoribanks to feel that now at length she\r\nwas emancipated, and at liberty to exercise her faculty. There were\r\ntimes during the past year when Lucilla had with difficulty restrained\r\nherself from snatching the reins out of the hands of her hosts, and\r\nshowing them how to manage. But, impatient as she was, she had to\r\nrestrain herself, and make the best of it. Now all that bondage was\r\nover. She felt like a young king entering in secret a capital which\r\nawaits him with acclamations. Before she presented herself to the\r\nrejoicing public, there were arrangements to be made and things to be\r\ndone; and Miss Marjoribanks gave a rapid glance at the shops in George\r\nStreet as she drove past, and decided which of them she meant to honour\r\nwith her patronage. When she entered the garden it was with the same\r\nrapid glance of reorganising genius that she cast her eyes around it;\r\nand still more decided was the look with which she regarded her own\r\nroom, where she was guided by the new housemaid, who did not know Miss\r\nLucilla. Nancy, who knew no better (being, like most gifted persons, a\r\nwoman of one idea), had established her young mistress in the little\r\nchamber which had been Lucilla\'s when she was a child; but Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, who had no sentimental notions about white dimity, shook\r\nher head at the frigid little apartment, where, however, she was not at\r\nall sorry to be placed at present; for if Dr Marjoribanks had been a man\r\nof the _prevenant_ class, disposed to make all the preparations possible\r\nfor his daughter, and arrange elegant surprises for her, he would have\r\nthoroughly disgusted Lucilla, who was bent on making all the necessary\r\nimprovements in her own person. When she went down to the drawing-room\r\nto await her father, Miss Marjoribanks\'s look of disapprobation was\r\nmingled with so much satisfaction and content in herself that it was\r\npleasant to behold. She shook her head and shrugged her shoulders as she\r\npaused in the centre of the large faded room, where there was no light\r\nbut that of the fire, which burned brightly, and kept up a lively play\r\nof glimmer and shadow in the tall glass over the fireplace, and even\r\ntwinkled dimly in the three long windows, where the curtains hung stiff\r\nand solemn in their daylight form. It was not an uncomfortable sort of\r\nbig, dull, faded, respectable drawing-room; and if there had been a\r\nfamily in it, with recollections attached to every old ottoman and\r\neasy-chair, no doubt it would have been charming; but it was only a\r\nwaste and howling wilderness to Lucilla. When she had walked from one\r\nend to the other, and verified all the plans she had already long ago\r\nconceived for the embellishment of this inner court and centre of her\r\nkingdom, Lucilla walked with her unhesitating step to the fire, and took\r\na match and lighted all the candles in the large old-fashioned\r\ncandlesticks, which had been flickering in grotesque shadows all over\r\nthe roof. This proceeding threw a flood of light on the subject of her\r\nconsiderations, and gave Miss Marjoribanks an idea, in passing, about\r\nthe best mode of lighting, which she afterwards acted upon with great\r\nsuccess. She was standing in this flood of light, regarding everything\r\naround her with the eye of an enlightened critic and reformer, when Dr\r\nMarjoribanks came in. Perhaps there arose in the soul of the Doctor a\r\nmomentary thought that the startling amount of _\xe9clairage_ which he\r\nwitnessed was scarcely necessary, for it is certain that he gave a\r\nmomentary glance at the candles as he went up to greet his daughter; but\r\nhe was far too well-bred a man to suggest such an idea at the moment. On\r\nthe contrary, he kissed her with a sentiment of real pleasure, and owned\r\nto himself that, if she was not a fool, and could keep to her own\r\ndepartment, it might be rather agreeable on the whole to have a woman in\r\nthe house. The sentiment was not enthusiastic, and neither were the\r\nwords of his salutation: "Well, Lucilla; so this is you!" said the\r\nmoderate and unexcited father. "Yes, papa, it is me," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, "and very glad to get home;" and so the two sat down and\r\ndiscussed the journey--whether she had been cold, and what state the\r\nrailway was in--till the Doctor bethought himself that he had to prepare\r\nfor dinner. "Nancy is always very punctual, and I am sure you are\r\nhungry," he said; "so I\'ll go upstairs, with your permission, Lucilla,\r\nand change my coat;" and with this the actual arrival terminated, and\r\nthe new reign began.\r\n\r\nBut it was only next morning that the young sovereign gave any\r\nintimation of her future policy. She had naturally a great deal to tell\r\nthat first night; and though it was exclusively herself, and her own\r\nadventures and achievements, which Miss Marjoribanks related, the\r\noccasion of her return made that sufficiently natural; and the Doctor\r\nwas not altogether superior to the natural prejudice which makes a man\r\ninterested, even when they are not in themselves particularly\r\ninteresting, in the doings of his children. She succeeded in doing what\r\nis certainly one of the first duties of a woman--she amused her father.\r\nHe followed her to the drawing-room for a marvel, and took a cup of tea,\r\nthough it was against his principles; and, on the whole, Lucilla had the\r\nsatisfaction of feeling that she had made a conquest of the Doctor,\r\nwhich, of course, was the grand and most essential preliminary. In the\r\nlittle interval which he spent over his claret, Miss Marjoribanks had\r\nsucceeded in effecting another fundamental duty of woman--she had, as\r\nshe herself expressed it, harmonised the rooms, by the simple method of\r\nrearranging half the chairs and covering the tables with trifles of her\r\nown--a proceeding which converted the apartment from an abstract English\r\ndrawing-room of the old school into Miss Marjoribanks\'s drawing-room, an\r\nindividual spot of ground revealing something of the character of its\r\nmistress. The Doctor himself was so moved by this, that he looked\r\nvaguely round when he came in, as if a little doubtful where he was--but\r\nthat might only be the effect of the sparkling mass of candles on the\r\nmantelpiece, which he was too well-bred to remark upon the first night.\r\nBut it was only in the morning that Lucilla unfolded her standard. She\r\nwas down to breakfast, ready to pour out the coffee, before the Doctor\r\nhad left his room. He found her, to his intense amazement, seated at the\r\nfoot of the table, in the place which he usually occupied himself,\r\nbefore the urn and the coffee-pot. Dr Marjoribanks hesitated for one\r\nmomentous instant, stricken dumb by this unparalleled audacity; but so\r\ngreat was the effect of his daughter\'s courage and steadiness, that\r\nafter that moment of fate he accepted the seat by the side where\r\neverything was arranged for him, and to which Lucilla invited him\r\nsweetly, though not without a touch of mental perturbation. The moment\r\nhe had seated himself, the Doctor\'s eyes were opened to the importance\r\nof the step he had taken. "I am afraid I have taken your seat, papa,"\r\nsaid Miss Marjoribanks, with ingenuous sweetness. "But then I should\r\nhave had to move the urn, and all the things, and I thought you would\r\nnot mind." The Doctor said nothing but "Humph!" and even that in an\r\nundertone; but he became aware all the same that he had abdicated,\r\nwithout knowing it, and that the reins of state had been smilingly\r\nwithdrawn from his unconscious hands.\r\n\r\nWhen Nancy made her appearance the fact became still more apparent,\r\nthough still in the sweetest way. "It is so dreadful to think papa\r\nshould have been bothered with all these things so long," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. "After this I am sure you and I, Nancy, can arrange it all\r\nwithout giving him the trouble. Perhaps this morning, papa, as I am a\r\nstranger, you will say if there is anything you would like, and then I\r\nshall have time to talk it all over with Nancy, and find out what is\r\nbest,"--and Lucilla smiled so sweetly upon her two amazed subjects that\r\nthe humour of the situation caught the fancy of the Doctor, who had a\r\nkeen perception of the ridiculous.\r\n\r\nHe laughed out, much to Nancy\'s consternation, who was standing by in\r\nopen-eyed dismay. "Very well, Lucilla," he said; "you shall try what you\r\ncan do. I daresay Nancy will be glad to have me back again before long;\r\nbut in the meantime I am quite content that you should try," and he went\r\noff laughing to his brougham, but came back again before Lucilla could\r\ntake Nancy in hand, who was an antagonist more formidable. "I forgot to\r\ntell you," said the Doctor, "that Tom Marjoribanks is coming on Circuit,\r\nand that I have asked him to stay here, as a matter of course. I suppose\r\nhe\'ll arrive to-morrow. Good-bye till the evening."\r\n\r\nThis, though Dr Marjoribanks did not in the least intend it, struck\r\nLucilla like a Parthian arrow, and brought her down for the moment. "Tom\r\nMarjoribanks!" she ejaculated in a kind of horror. "Of all people in the\r\nworld, and at this moment!" but when she saw the open eyes and rising\r\ncolour of Nancy the young dictator recovered herself--for a conqueror in\r\nthe first moment of his victory has need to be wary. She called Nancy to\r\nher in her most affectionate tones as she finished her breakfast. "I\r\nsent papa away," said Miss Marjoribanks, "because I wanted to have a\r\ngood talk with you, Nancy. I want to tell you my object in life. It is\r\nto be a comfort to papa. Ever since poor mamma died that is what I have\r\nbeen thinking of; and now I have come home, and I have made up my mind\r\nthat he is not to be troubled about anything. I know what a good,\r\nfaithful, valuable woman you are, I assure you. You need not think me a\r\nfoolish girl who is not able to appreciate you. The dinner was charming\r\nlast night, Nancy," said Lucilla, with much feeling; "and I never saw\r\nanything more beautifully cooked than papa\'s cutlets to-day."\r\n\r\n"Miss Lucilla, I may say as I am very glad I have pleased you," said\r\nNancy, who was not quite conquered as yet. She stood very stiffly\r\nupright by the table, and maintained her integrity. "Master _is_\r\nparticular, I don\'t deny," continued the prime minister, who felt\r\nherself dethroned. "I\'ve always done my best to go in with his little\r\nfancies, and I don\'t mean to say as it isn\'t right and natural as you\r\nshould be the missis. But I ain\'t used to have ado with ladies, and\r\nthat\'s the truth. Ladies is stingy in a-many things as is the soul of a\r\ngood dinner to them as knows. I may be valleyable or not, it ain\'t for\r\nme to say; but I\'m not one as can always be kept to a set figger in my\r\ngravy-beef, and my bacon, and them sorts of things. As for the butter, I\r\ndon\'t know as I could give nobody an idea. I ain\'t one as likes changes,\r\nbut I can\'t abide to be kept to a set figger; and that\'s the chief\r\nthing, Miss Lucilla, as I\'ve got to say."\r\n\r\n"And quite reasonable too," said Miss Marjoribanks; "you and I will work\r\nperfectly well together, Nancy. I am sure we have both the same meaning;\r\nand I hope you don\'t think I am less concerned about dear papa than\r\nabout the gravy-beef. He must have been very desolate, with no one to\r\ntalk to, though he has been so good and kind and self-sacrificing in\r\nleaving me to get every advantage; but I mean to make it up to him, now\r\nI\'ve come home."\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss," said Nancy, somewhat mystified; "not but what master has\r\nhad his little parties now and again, to cheer him up a bit; and I make\r\nbold to say, miss, as I have heard compliments, which it was Thomas that\r\nbrought \'em downstairs, as might go nigh to turn a body\'s head, if it\r\nwas vanity as I was thinking of; but I ain\'t one as thinks of anything\r\nbut the comfort of the family," said Nancy, yielding in spite of herself\r\nto follow the leadings of the higher will in presence of which she found\r\nherself, "and I\'m always one as does my best, Miss Lucilla, if I ain\'t\r\nworried nor kept to a set figger with my gravy-beef."\r\n\r\n"I have heard of papa\'s dinners," said Lucilla graciously, "and I don\'t\r\nmean to let down your reputation, Nancy. Now we are two women to manage\r\neverything, we ought to do still better. I have two or three things in\r\nmy head that I will tell you after; but in the meantime I want you to\r\nknow that the object of my life is to be a comfort to poor papa; and now\r\nlet us think what we had better have for dinner," said the new\r\nsovereign. Nancy was so totally unprepared for this manner of\r\ndethronement, that she gave in like her master. She followed Miss\r\nMarjoribanks humbly into those details in which Lucilla speedily proved\r\nherself a woman of original mind, and powers quite equal to her\r\nundertaking. The Doctor\'s formidable housekeeper conducted her young\r\nmistress downstairs afterwards, and showed her everything with the\r\nmeekness of a saint. Lucilla had won a second victory still more\r\nexhilarating and satisfactory than the first; for, to be sure, it is no\r\ngreat credit to a woman of nineteen to make a man of any age throw down\r\nhis arms; but to conquer a woman is a different matter, and Lucilla was\r\nthoroughly sensible of the difference. Now, indeed, she could feel with\r\na sense of reality that her foundations were laid.\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks had enough of occupation for that day, and for many\r\ndays. But her mind was a little distracted by her father\'s parting\r\nintelligence, and she had, besides, a natural desire to view the country\r\nshe had come to conquer. When she had made a careful supervision of the\r\nhouse, and shifted her own quarters into the pleasantest of the two best\r\nbedrooms, and concluded that the little bare dimity chamber she had\r\noccupied the previous night was quite good enough for Tom Marjoribanks,\r\nLucilla put on her hat and went out to make a little reconnaissance. She\r\nwalked down to the spot where St Roque\'s now stands, on her own side of\r\nGrange Lane, and up on the other side into George Street, surveying all\r\nthe capabilities of the place with a rapid but penetrating glance. Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s house could not have been better placed as a strategic\r\nposition, commanding as it did all Grange Lane, of which it was, so to\r\nspeak, the key, and yet affording a base of communication with the\r\nprofaner public, which Miss Marjoribanks was wise enough to know a\r\nleader of society should never ignore completely; for, indeed, one of\r\nthe great advantages of that brilliant position is, that it gives a\r\nwoman a right to be arbitrary, and to select her materials according to\r\nher judgment. It was more from a disinclination to repeat herself than\r\nany other motive that Lucilla, when she had concluded this preliminary\r\nsurvey, went up into Grove Street, meaning to return home that way. At\r\nthat hour in the morning the sun was shining on the little gardens on\r\nthe north side of the street, which was the plebeian side; and as it was\r\nthe end of October, and by no means warm, Lucilla was glad to cross over\r\nand continue her walk by the side of those little enclosures where the\r\nstraggling chrysanthemums propped each other up, and the cheerful\r\nMichaelmas daisies made the best of it in the sunshine that remained to\r\nthem. Miss Marjoribanks had nearly reached Salem Chapel, which pushed\r\nitself forward amid the cosy little line of houses, pondering in her\r\nmind the unexpected hindrance which was about to be placed in her\r\ntriumphant path, in the shape of Tom Marjoribanks, when that singular\r\npiece of good fortune occurred to her which had so much effect upon her\r\ncareer in Carlingford. Such happy accidents rarely happen, except to\r\ngreat generals or heroes of romance; and it would have been, perhaps, a\r\npresumption on the part of Lucilla to place herself conspicuously in\r\neither of these categories. The fact is, however, that at this eventful\r\nmoment she was walking along under the shade of her pretty parasol, not\r\nexpecting anything, but absorbed in many thoughts, and a little cast\r\ndown in her expectations of success by a consciousness that this unlucky\r\ncousin would insist upon making love to her, and perhaps even, as she\r\nherself expressed it, _saying the words_ which it had taken all her\r\nskill to prevent him from saying before. Not that we would have any one\r\nbelieve that love-making in the abstract was disagreeable to Miss\r\nMarjoribanks; but she was only nineteen, well off and good-looking, and\r\nwith plenty of time for all that; and at the present moment she had\r\nother matters of more importance in hand. It was while occupied with\r\nthese reflections, and within three doors of Salem Chapel, in front of a\r\nlittle garden where a great deal of mignonette had run to seed, and\r\nwhere the Michaelmas daisies had taken full possession, that Lucilla was\r\nroused suddenly out of her musings. The surprise was so great that she\r\nstopped short and stood still before the house in the extremity of her\r\nastonishment and delight. Who could it be that possessed that voice\r\nwhich Miss Marjoribanks felt by instinct was the very one thing\r\nwanting--a round, full, delicious contralto, precisely adapted to\r\nsupplement without supplanting her own high-pitched and much-cultivated\r\norgan? She stopped short before the door and made a rapid observation\r\neven in the first moment of her surprise. The house was not exactly like\r\nthe other humble houses in Grove Street. Two little blank squares hung\r\nin the centre of each of the lower windows, revealed to Lucilla\'s\r\neducated eye the existence of so much "feeling" for art as can be\r\nsatisfied with a transparent porcelain version of a famous Madonna; and\r\nshe could even catch a glimpse, through the curtains of the best\r\nroom--which, contrary to the wont of humble gentility in Carlingford,\r\nwere well drawn back, and allowed the light to enter fully--of the\r\nglimmer of gilt picture-frames. And in the little garden in front, half\r\nburied among the mignonette, were some remains of plaster-casts,\r\noriginally placed there for ornament, but long since cast down by rain\r\nand neglect. Lucilla made her observations with the promptitude of an\r\naccomplished warrior, and before the second bar of the melody indoors\r\nwas finished, had knocked very energetically. "Is Miss Lake at home?"\r\nshe asked, with confidence, of the little maid-servant who opened the\r\ndoor to her. And it was thus that Lucilla made her first bold step out\r\nof the limits of Grange Lane for the good of society, and secured at\r\nonce several important personal advantages, and the great charm of those\r\nThursday evenings which made so entire a revolution in the taste and\r\nideas of Carlingford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter V_\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks did not leave the contralto any time to recover from\r\nher surprise; she went up to her direct where she stood, with her song\r\narrested on her lips, as she had risen hastily from the piano. "Is it\r\nRose?" said Lucilla, going forward with the most eager cordiality, and\r\nholding out both her hands; though, to be sure, she knew very well it\r\nwas not Rose, who was about half the height of the singer, and was known\r\nto everybody in Mount Pleasant to be utterly innocent of a voice.\r\n\r\n"No," said Miss Lake, who was much astonished and startled and offended,\r\nas was unfortunately rather her custom. She was a young woman without\r\nany of those instincts of politeness, which make some people pleasant in\r\nspite of themselves; and she added nothing to soften this abrupt\r\nnegative, but drew her hands away from the stranger and stood bolt\r\nupright, looking at her, with a burning blush, caused by temper much\r\nmore than by embarrassment, on her face.\r\n\r\n"Then," said Lucilla, dropping lightly into the most comfortable chair\r\nshe could get sight of in the bare little parlour, "it is Barbara--and\r\nthat is a great deal better; Rose is a good little thing, but--she is\r\ndifferent, you know. It is so odd you should not remember me; I thought\r\neverybody knew me in Carlingford. You know I have been a long time away,\r\nand now I have come home for good. Your voice is just the very thing to\r\ngo with mine: was it not a lucky thing that I should have passed just at\r\nthe right moment? I don\'t know how it is, but somehow these lucky\r\nchances _always_ happen to me. I am Lucilla Marjoribanks, you know."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Barbara, who had not the least intention of being civil,\r\n"I did not recognise you in the least."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I remember you were always shortsighted a little," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks calmly. "I should so like if we could try a duet. I have\r\nbeen having lessons in Italy, you know, and I am sure I could give you a\r\nfew hints. I always like, when I can, to be of use. Tell me what songs\r\nyou have that we could sing together. You know, my dear, it is not as if\r\nI was asking you for mere amusement to myself; my grand object in life\r\nis to be a comfort to papa----"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean Dr Marjoribanks?" said the uncivil Barbara. "I am sure he\r\ndoes not care in the least for music. I think you must be making a\r\nmistake----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Lucilla, "I never make mistakes. I don\'t mean to sing\r\n_to_ him, you know; but you are just the very person I wanted. As for\r\nthe ridiculous idea some people have that nobody can be called on who\r\ndoes not live in Grange Lane, I assure you I mean to make an end of\r\nthat. Of course I cannot commence just all in a moment. But it would\r\nalways be an advantage to practise a little together. I like to know\r\nexactly how far one can calculate upon everybody; then one can tell,\r\nwithout fear of breaking down, just what one may venture to do."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand in the least," said Barbara, whose pride was up in\r\narms. "Perhaps you think I am a professional singer?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, a professional singer spoils everything," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks; "it changes the character of an evening altogether. There\r\nare so few people who understand that. When you have professional\r\nsingers, you have to give yourself up to music; and that is not my view\r\nin the least. My great aim, as all my friends are aware, is to be a\r\ncomfort to dear papa."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would not talk in riddles," said Lucilla\'s amazed and\r\nindignant companion, in her round rich contralto. "I suppose you really\r\nare Miss Marjoribanks. I have always heard that Miss Marjoribanks was a\r\nlittle----"\r\n\r\n"There!" said Lucilla triumphantly; "really it is almost like a\r\nrecitativo to hear you speak. I am so glad. What have you got there? Oh,\r\nto be sure, it\'s _that_ duet out of the Trovatore. Do let us try it;\r\nthere is nobody here, and everything is so convenient--and you know it\r\nwould never do to risk a breakdown. Will you play the accompaniment, or\r\nshall I?" said Miss Marjoribanks, taking off her gloves. As for the\r\ndrawing-master\'s daughter, she stood aghast, lost in such sudden\r\nbewilderment and perplexity that she could find no words to reply. She\r\nwas not in the least amiable or yielding by nature; but Lucilla took it\r\nso much as a matter of course that Barbara could not find a word to\r\nsay; and before she could be sure that it was real, Miss Marjoribanks\r\nhad seated herself at the piano. Barbara was so obstinate that she would\r\nnot sing the first part, which ought to have been hers; but she was not\r\nclever enough for her antagonist. Lucilla sang her part by herself\r\ngallantly; and when it came to Barbara\'s turn the second time, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks essayed the second in a false voice, which drove the\r\ncontralto off her guard; and then the magnificent volume of sound flowed\r\nforth, grand enough to have filled Lucilla with envy if she had not been\r\nsustained by that sublime confidence in herself which is the first\r\nnecessity to a woman with a mission. She paused a moment in the\r\naccompaniment to clap her hands after that strophe was accomplished, and\r\nthen resumed with energy. For, to be sure, she knew by instinct what\r\nsort of clay the people were made of by whom she had to work, and gave\r\nthem their reward with that liberality and discrimination which is the\r\nglory of enlightened despotism. Miss Marjoribanks was naturally elated\r\nwhen she had performed this important and successful _tour_. She got up\r\nfrom the piano, and closed it in her open, imperial way. "I do not want\r\nto tire you, you know," she said; "that will do for to-day. I told you\r\nyour voice was the very thing to go with mine. Give my love to Rose when\r\nshe comes in, but don\'t bring her with you when you come to me. She is a\r\ngood little thing--but then she is different, you know," said the bland\r\nLucilla; and she held out her hand to her captive graciously, and\r\ngathered up her parasol, which she had left on her chair. Barbara Lake\r\nlet her visitor go after this, with a sense that she had fallen asleep,\r\nand had dreamt it all; but, after all, there was something in the visit\r\nwhich was not disagreeable when she came to think it over. The\r\ndrawing-master was poor, and he had a quantity of children, as was\r\nnatural, and Barbara had never forgiven her mother for dying just at the\r\nmoment when she had a chance of seeing a little of what she called the\r\nworld. At that time Mr Lake and his portfolio of drawings were asked out\r\nfrequently to tea; and when he had pupils in the family, some kind\r\npeople asked him to bring one of his daughters with him--so that\r\nBarbara, who was ambitious, had beheld herself for a month or two almost\r\non the threshold of Grange Lane. And it was at this moment of all\r\nothers, just at the same time as Mrs Marjoribanks finished her pale\r\ncareer, that poor Mrs Lake thought fit to die, to the injury of her\r\ndaughter\'s prospects and the destruction of her hopes. Naturally\r\nBarbara had never quite forgiven that injury. It was this sense of\r\nhaving been ill-used which made her so resolute about sending Rose to\r\nMount Pleasant, though the poor little girl did not in the least want to\r\ngo, and was very happy helping her papa at the School of Design. But\r\nBarbara saw no reason why Rose should be happy, while she herself had to\r\nresign her inclinations and look after a set of odious children. To be\r\nsure, it was a little hard upon a young woman of a proper ambition, who\r\nknew she was handsome, to fall back into housekeeping, and consent to\r\nremain unseen and unheard; for Barbara was also aware that she had a\r\nremarkable voice. In these circumstances, it may be imagined that, after\r\nthe first movement of a passionate temper was over, when she had taken\r\nbreath, and had time to consider this sudden and extraordinary visit, a\r\nglimmer of hope and interest penetrated into the bosom of the gloomy\r\ngirl. She was two years older than Miss Marjoribanks, and as different\r\nin "style" as she was in voice. She was not stout as yet, though it is\r\nthe nature of a contralto to be stout; but she was tall, with all due\r\nopportunity for that development which might come later. And then\r\nBarbara possessed a kind of beauty, the beauty of a passionate and\r\nsomewhat sullen brunette, dark and glowing, with straight black\r\neyebrows, very dark and very straight, which gave, oddly enough, a\r\nsuggestion of oblique vision to her eyes; but her eyes were not in the\r\nleast oblique, and looked at you straight from under that black line of\r\nshadow with no doubtful expression. She was shy in a kind of way, as was\r\nnatural to a young woman who had never seen any society, and felt\r\nherself, on the whole, injured and unappreciated. But no two things\r\ncould be more different than this shyness which made Barbara look you\r\nstraight in the face with a kind of scared defiance, and the sweet\r\nshyness that pleaded for kind treatment in the soft eyes of little Rose,\r\nwho was plain, and had the oddest longing to make people comfortable,\r\nand please them in her way, which, to be sure, was not always\r\nsuccessful. Barbara sat down on the stool before the piano, which Miss\r\nMarjoribanks had been so obliging as to close, and thought it all over\r\nwith growing excitement. No doubt it was a little puzzling to make out\r\nhow the discovery of a fine contralto, and the possibility of getting up\r\nunlimited duets, could further Lucilla in the great aim of her life,\r\nwhich was to be a comfort to her dear papa. But Barbara was like a young\r\nsoldier of fortune, ready to take a great deal for granted, and swallow\r\nmuch that was mysterious in the programme of the adventurous general who\r\nmight lead her on to glory. In half an hour her dreams had gone so far\r\nthat she saw herself receiving in Miss Marjoribanks\'s drawing-room the\r\nhomage, not only of Grange Lane, but even of the county families, who\r\nwould be attracted by rumours of her wonderful performance; and Barbara\r\nwas, to her own consciousness, walking up the middle aisle of\r\nCarlingford Church in a veil of real Brussels, before little Mr Lake\r\ncame in, hungry and good-tempered, from his round. To be sure, she had\r\nnot concluded who was to be the bridegroom; but that was one of those\r\nmatters of detail which could not be precisely concluded on till the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSuch was the immediate result, so far as this secondary personage was\r\nconcerned, of Lucilla\'s masterly impromptu; and it is needless to say\r\nthat the accomplished warrior, who had her wits always about her, and\r\nhad made, while engaged in a simple reconnaissance, so brilliant and\r\nsuccessful a capture, withdrew from the scene still more entirely\r\nsatisfied with herself. Nothing, indeed, could have come more\r\nopportunely for Lucilla, who possessed in perfection that faculty of\r\nthrowing herself into the future, and anticipating the difficulties of a\r\nposition, which is so valuable to all who aspire to be leaders of\r\nmankind. With a prudence which Dr Marjoribanks himself would have\r\nacknowledged to be remarkable "in a person of her age and sex," Lucilla\r\nhad already foreseen that to amuse her guests entirely in her own\r\nperson, would be at once impracticable and "bad style." The first\r\nobjection might have been got over, for Miss Marjoribanks had a soul\r\nabove the ordinary limits of possibility, but the second unanswerable.\r\nThis discovery, however, satisfied all the necessities of the position.\r\nLucilla, who was liberal, as genius ought always to be, was perfectly\r\nwilling that all the young ladies in Carlingford should sing their\r\nlittle songs while she was entertaining her guests; and then at the\r\nright moment, when her ruling mind saw it was necessary, would occur the\r\nduet--the one duet which would be the great feature of the evening. Thus\r\nit will be seen that another quality of the highest order developed\r\nitself during Miss Marjoribanks\'s deliberations; for, to tell the truth,\r\nshe set a good deal of store by her voice, and had been used to\r\napplause, and had tasted the sweetness of individual success. This,\r\nhowever, she was willing to sacrifice for the enhanced and magnificent\r\neffect which she felt could be produced by the combination of the two\r\nvoices; and the sacrifice was one which a weaker woman would have been\r\nincapable of making. She went home past Salem Chapel by the little lane\r\nwhich makes a line of communication between the end of Grove Street and\r\nthe beginning of Grange Lane, with a sentiment of satisfaction worthy\r\nthe greatness of her mission. Dr Marjoribanks never came home to lunch,\r\nand indeed had a contempt for that feminine indulgence; which, to be\r\nsure, might be accounted for by the fact that about that time in the day\r\nthe Doctor very often found himself to be passing close by one or other\r\nof the houses in the neighbourhood which had a reputation for good\r\nsherry or madeira, such as exists no more. Lucilla, accordingly, had her\r\nlunch alone, served to her with respectful care by Nancy, who was still\r\nunder the impression of the interview of the morning; and it occurred to\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, as she sat at table alone, that this was an\r\nopportunity too valuable to be left unimproved; for, to be sure, there\r\nare few things more pleasant than a little impromptu luncheon-party,\r\nwhere everybody comes without being expected, fresh from the outside\r\nworld, and ready to tell all that is going on; though, on the other\r\nhand, it was a little doubtful how it might work in Carlingford, where\r\nthe men had generally something to do, and where the married ladies took\r\ntheir luncheon when the children had their dinner, and presided at the\r\nnursery meal. And as for a party of young ladies, even supposing they\r\nhad the courage to come, with no more solid admixture of the more\r\nimportant members of society, Lucilla, to tell the truth, had no\r\nparticular taste for that. Miss Marjoribanks reflected as she ate--and\r\nindeed, thanks to her perfect health and her agreeable morning walk,\r\nLucilla had a very pretty appetite, and enjoyed her meal in a way that\r\nwould have been most satisfactory to her many friends--that it must be\r\nby way of making his visit, which was aggravating under all\r\ncircumstances, more aggravating still, that Tom Marjoribanks had decided\r\nto come now, of all times in the world. "If he had waited till things\r\nwere organised, he might have been of a little use," Lucilla said to\r\nherself; "for at least he could have brought some of the men that come\r\non circuit, and that would have made a little novelty; but, of course,\r\njust now it would never do to make a rush at people, and invite them all\r\nat once." After a moment\'s consideration, however. Miss Marjoribanks,\r\nwith her usual candour, reflected that it was not in Tom Marjoribanks\'s\r\npower to change the time of the Carlingford assizes, and that,\r\naccordingly, he was not to be blamed in this particular at least. "Of\r\ncourse _it_ is not his fault," she added, to herself, "but it is\r\nastonishing how things happen with some men always at the wrong moment;\r\nand it is _so_ like Tom." These reflections were interrupted by the\r\narrival of visitors, whom Miss Marjoribanks received with her usual\r\ngrace. The first was old Mrs Chiley, who kissed Lucilla, and wanted to\r\nknow how she had enjoyed herself on the Continent, and if she had\r\nbrought many pretty things home. "My dear, you have grown ever so much\r\nsince the last time I saw you," the old lady said in her grandmotherly\r\nway, "and stout with it, which is such a comfort with a tall girl; and\r\nthen your poor dear mamma was so delicate. I have always been a little\r\nanxious about you on that account, Lucilla; and I am so glad, my dear,\r\nto see you looking so strong."\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley," said Miss Marjoribanks, who perhaps in her heart was\r\nnot quite so gratified by this compliment as the old lady intended, "the\r\ngreat aim of my life is to be a comfort to dear papa."\r\n\r\nMrs Chiley was very much moved by this filial piety, and she told\r\nLucilla that story about the Colonel\'s niece, Susan, who was such a good\r\ndaughter, and had refused three excellent offers, to devote herself to\r\nher father and mother, with which the public in Grange Lane were\r\ntolerably acquainted. "And one of them was a baronet, my dear," said Mrs\r\nChiley. Miss Marjoribanks did not make any decided response, for she\r\nfelt that it would be dangerous to commit herself to such a height of\r\nself-abnegation as that; but the old lady was quite pleased to hear of\r\nher travels and adventures instead; and stayed so long that Mrs Centum\r\nand Mrs Woodburn, who happened to arrive at the same moment, found her\r\nstill there. Mrs Chiley was a little afraid of Mrs Woodburn, and she\r\ntook her leave hastily, with another kiss; and Lucilla found herself\r\nface to face with the only two women who could attempt a rival\r\nenterprise to her own in Carlingford. As for Mrs Woodburn, she had\r\nsettled herself in an easy-chair by the fire, and was fully prepared to\r\ntake notes. To be sure, Lucilla was the very person to fall victim to\r\nher arts; for that confidence in herself which, in one point of view,\r\ngave grandeur to the character of Miss Marjoribanks, gave her also a\r\ncertain na\xefvet\xe9 and openness which the most simple rustic could not have\r\nsurpassed.\r\n\r\n"I am sure by her face she has been telling you about my niece Susan,"\r\nsaid the mimic, assuming Mrs Chiley\'s tone, and almost her appearance,\r\nfor the moment, "and that one of them was a baronet, my dear. I always\r\nknow from her looks what she has been saying; and \'the Colonel was much\r\nas usual, but suffering a little from the cold, as he always does in\r\nthis climate.\' She must be a good soul, for she always has her favourite\r\nlittle speeches written in her face."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I don\'t know," said Miss Marjoribanks, who felt it was her\r\nduty to make an example; "there has always been one thing remarked of me\r\nall my life, that I never have had a great sense of humour. I know it is\r\nsingular, but when one has a defect, it is always so much better to\r\nconfess it. I always get on very well with anything else, but I never\r\nhad any sense of humour, you know; and I am very fond of Mrs Chiley. She\r\nhas always had a fancy for me from the time I was born; and she has such\r\nnice manners. But then, it is so odd I should have no sense of humour,"\r\nsaid Lucilla, addressing herself to Mrs Centum, who was sitting on the\r\nsofa by her. "Don\'t you think it is very odd?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure it is very nice," said Mrs Centum. "I hate people that laugh\r\nat everything. I don\'t see much to laugh at myself, I am sure, in this\r\ndistracting world; any one who has a lot of children and servants like\r\nme to look after, finds very little to laugh at." And she seized the\r\nopportunity to enter upon domestic circumstances. Mrs Woodburn did not\r\nanswer a word. She made a most dashing murderous sketch of Lucilla, but\r\nthat did the future ruler of Carlingford very little harm; and then, by\r\nthe evening, it was known through all Grange Lane that Miss Marjoribanks\r\nhad snubbed the caricaturist who kept all the good people in terror of\r\ntheir lives. Snubbed her absolutely, and took the words out of her very\r\nmouth, was the report that flew through Grange Lane; and it may be\r\nimagined how Lucilla\'s prestige rose in consequence, and how much people\r\nbegan to expect of Miss Marjoribanks, who had performed such a feat\r\nalmost on the first day of her return home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter VI_\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Marjoribanks arrived that night, according to the Doctor\'s\r\nexpectation. He arrived, with that curious want of adaptation to the\r\ncircumstances which characterised the young man, at an hour which put\r\nNancy entirely out, and upset the equanimity of the kitchen for\r\ntwenty-four hours at least. He came, if any one can conceive of such an\r\ninstance of carelessness, by the nine o\'clock train, just as they had\r\nfinished putting to rights downstairs. After this, Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\nconclusion that the fact of the Carlingford assizes occurring a day or\r\ntwo after her arrival, when as yet she was not fully prepared to take\r\nadvantage of them, was _so_ like Tom, may be partially understood. And\r\nof course he was furiously hungry, and could have managed perfectly to\r\nbe in time for dinner if he had not missed the train at Didcot Junction,\r\nby some wonderful blunder of the railway people, which never could have\r\noccurred but for his unlucky presence among the passengers. Lucilla took\r\nThomas apart, and sent him downstairs with the most conciliatory\r\nmessage. "Tell Nancy not to put herself about, but to send up something\r\ncold--the cold pie, or anything she can find handy. Tell her I am _so_\r\nvexed, but it is just like Mr Tom; and he never knows what he is\r\neating," said Miss Marjoribanks. As for Nancy, this sweetness did not\r\nsubdue her in the least. She said, "I\'ll thank Miss Lucilla to mind her\r\nown business. The cold pie is for master\'s breakfast. I ain\'t such a\r\ngoose as not to know what to send upstairs, and that Tummas can tell her\r\nif he likes." In the meantime the Doctor was in the drawing-room, much\r\nagainst his will, with the two young people, spinning about the room,\r\nand looking at Lucilla\'s books and knick-knacks on the tables by way of\r\ncovering his impatience. He wanted to carry off Tom, who was rather a\r\nfavourite, to his own den downstairs, where the young man\'s supper was\r\nto be served; but, at the same time, Dr Marjoribanks could not deny that\r\nLucilla had a right to the greetings and homage of her cousin. He could\r\nnot help thinking, on the whole, as he looked at the two, what a much\r\nmore sensible arrangement it would have been if he had had the boy,\r\ninstead of his sister, who had been a widow for ever so long, and no\r\ndoubt had spoiled her son, as women always do; and then Lucilla might\r\nhave passed under the sway of Mrs Marjoribanks, who no doubt would have\r\nknown how to manage her. Thus the Doctor mused, with that sense of mild\r\namazement at the blunders of Providence, which so many people\r\nexperience, and without any idea that Mrs Marjoribanks would have found\r\na task a great deal beyond her powers in the management of Lucilla. As\r\nfor Tom, he was horribly hungry, having found, as was to be expected, no\r\npossible means of lunching at Didcot; but, at the same time, he was\r\nexhilarated by Lucilla\'s smile, and delighted to think of having a week\r\nat least to spend in her society. "I don\'t think I ever saw you looking\r\nso well," he was saying; "and you know my opinion generally on that\r\nsubject." To which Lucilla responded in a way to wither all the germs of\r\nsentiment in the bud.\r\n\r\n"What subject?" she said; "my looks? I am sure they can\'t be interesting\r\nto you. You are as hungry as ever you can be, and I can see it in your\r\neyes. Papa, he is famishing, and I don\'t think he can contain himself\r\nany longer. Do take him downstairs, and let him have something to eat.\r\nFor myself," Lucilla continued, in a lower tone, "it is my duty that\r\nkeeps me up. You know it has always been the object of my life to be a\r\ncomfort to papa."\r\n\r\n"Come along, Tom," said the Doctor. "Don\'t waste your time philandering\r\nwhen your supper is ready." And Dr Marjoribanks led the way downstairs,\r\nleaving Tom, who followed him, in a state of great curiosity to know\r\nwhat secret oppression it might be under which his cousin was supported\r\nby her duty. Naturally his thoughts reverted to a possible rival--some\r\none whom the sensible Doctor would have nothing to say to; and his very\r\nears grew red with excitement at this idea. But, notwithstanding, he ate\r\na very satisfactory meal in the library, where he had to answer all\r\nsorts of questions. Tom had his tray at the end of the table, and the\r\nDoctor, who had, according to his hospitable old-fashioned habit, taken\r\na glass of claret to "keep him company," sat in his easy-chair between\r\nthe fire and the table, and sipped his wine, and admired its colour and\r\npurity in the light, and watched with satisfaction the excellent meal\r\nhis nephew was making. He asked him all about his prospects, and what he\r\nwas doing, which Tom replied to with the frankest confidence. He was not\r\nvery fond of work, nor were his abilities anything out of the common;\r\nbut at the present moment Tom saw no reason why he should not gain the\r\nWoolsack in time; and Dr Marjoribanks gave something like a sigh as he\r\nlistened, and wondered much what Providence could be thinking of not to\r\ngive _him_ the boy.\r\n\r\nLucilla meantime was very much occupied upstairs. She had the new\r\nhousemaid up nominally to give her instructions about Mr Tom\'s room, but\r\nreally to take the covers off the chairs, and see how they looked when\r\nthe room was lighted up; but the progress of decay had gone too far to\r\nstand that trial. After all, the chintz, though none of the freshest,\r\nwas the best. When the gentlemen came upstairs, which Tom, to the\r\nDoctor\'s disgust, insisted on doing, Lucilla was found in the act of\r\npacing the room--pacing, not in the sentimental sense of making a little\r\npromenade up and down, but in the homely practical signification, with a\r\nview of measuring, that she might form an idea how much carpet was\r\nrequired. Lucilla was tall enough to go through this process without any\r\ngreat drawback in point of grace--the long step giving rather a\r\ntragedy-queen effect to her handsome but substantial person and long,\r\nsweeping dress. She stopped short, however, when she saw them, and\r\nwithdrew to the sofa, on which she had established her throne; and there\r\nwas a little air of conscious pathos on her face as she sat down, which\r\nimpressed her companions. As for Tom, he instinctively felt that it must\r\nhave something to do with that mystery under which Lucilla was supported\r\nby her duty; and the irrelevant young man conceived immediately a\r\nviolent desire to knock the fellow down; whereas there was no fellow at\r\nall in the case, unless it might be Mr Holden, the upholsterer, whose\r\nvisits Miss Marjoribanks would have received with greater enthusiasm at\r\nthis moment than those of the most eligible eldest son in England. And\r\nthen she gave a little pathetic sigh.\r\n\r\n"What were you doing, Lucilla?" said her father,--"rehearsing Lady\r\nMacbeth, I suppose. At least you looked exactly like it when we came\r\ninto the room."\r\n\r\n"No, papa," said Lucilla sweetly; "I was only measuring to see how much\r\ncarpet we should want; and that, you know, and Tom\'s coming, made me\r\nthink of old times. You are so much downstairs in the library that you\r\ndon\'t feel it; but a lady has to spend her life in the drawing-room--and\r\nthen I always was so domestic. It does not matter what is outside, I\r\nalways find my pleasure at home. I cannot help if it has a little effect\r\non my spirits now and then," said Miss Marjoribanks, looking down upon\r\nher handkerchief, "to be always surrounded with things that have such\r\nassociations----"\r\n\r\n"What associations?" said the amazed Doctor. To be sure, he had\r\nforgotten his wife; but it was four years ago, and he had got used to\r\nher absence from her favourite sofa; and, on the whole, in that\r\nparticular, had acquiesced in the arrangements of Providence. "Really,\r\nLucilla, I don\'t know what you mean."\r\n\r\n"No, papa," said Miss Marjoribanks, with resignation. "I know you don\'t,\r\nand that is what makes it so sad. But talking of new carpets, you know,\r\nI had such an adventure to-day that I must tell you--quite one of _my_\r\nadventures--the very luckiest thing. It happened when I was out walking;\r\nI heard a voice out of a house in Grove Street, just the _very_ thing to\r\ngo with my voice. That is not a thing that happens every day," said\r\nLucilla, "for all the masters have always told me that my voice was\r\nsomething quite by itself. When I heard it, though it was in Grove\r\nStreet, and all the people about, I could have danced for joy."\r\n\r\n"It was a man\'s voice, I suppose," suggested Tom Marjoribanks, in gloomy\r\ntones; and the Doctor added, in his cynical way:\r\n\r\n"It\'s a wonderful advantage to be so pleased about trifles. What number\r\nwas it? For my part, I have not many patients in Grove Street," said Dr\r\nMarjoribanks. "I would find a voice to suit you in another quarter, if I\r\nwere you."\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, it\'s such a pity that you don\'t understand," said Lucilla\r\ncompassionately. "It turned out to be Barbara Lake; for, of course, I\r\nwent in directly, and found out. I never heard a voice that went so well\r\nwith mine." If Miss Marjoribanks did not go into raptures over the\r\ncontralto on its own merits, it was not from any jealousy, of which,\r\nindeed, she was incapable, but simply because its adaptation to her own\r\nseemed to her by far its most interesting quality, and indeed almost the\r\nsole claim it had to consideration from the world.\r\n\r\n"Barbara Lake?" said the Doctor. "There\'s something in that. If you can\r\ndo her any good or get her teaching or anything--I have a regard for\r\npoor Lake, poor little fellow! He\'s kept up wonderfully since his wife\r\ndied; and nobody expected it of him," Dr Marjoribanks continued, with a\r\nmomentary dreary recollection of the time when the poor woman took\r\nfarewell of her children, which indeed was the next day after that on\r\nwhich his own wife, who had nobody in particular to take farewell of,\r\nfaded out of her useless life.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lucilla, "I mean her to come here and sing with me; but,\r\nthen, one needs to organise a little first. I am nineteen--how long is\r\nit since you were married, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Two-and-twenty years," said the Doctor abruptly. He did not observe the\r\nstrangeness of the question, because he had been thinking for the moment\r\nof his wife, and perhaps his face was a trifle graver than usual, though\r\nneither of his young companions thought of remarking it. To be sure he\r\nwas not a young man even when he married; but, on the whole, perhaps\r\nsomething more than this perfect comfort and respectability, and those\r\nnice little dinners, had seemed to shine on his horizon when he brought\r\nhome his incapable bride.\r\n\r\n"Two-and-twenty years!" exclaimed Lucilla. "I don\'t mind talking before\r\nTom, for he is one of the family. The things are all the same as they\r\nwere when mamma came home, though, I am sure, nobody would believe it. I\r\nthink it is going against Providence, for my part. Nothing was ever\r\nintended to last so long, except the things the Jews, poor souls! wore\r\nin the desert, perhaps. Papa, if you have no objection, I should like to\r\nchoose the colours myself. There is a great deal in choosing colours\r\nthat go well with one\'s complexion. People think of that for their\r\ndresses, but not for their rooms, which are of so much more importance.\r\nI should have liked blue, but blue gets so soon tawdry. I think," said\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, rising and looking at herself seriously in the glass,\r\n"that I have enough complexion at present to venture upon a pale spring\r\ngreen."\r\n\r\nThis little calculation, which a timid young woman would have taken care\r\nto do by herself, Lucilla did publicly, with her usual discrimination.\r\nThe Doctor, who had looked a little grim at first, could not but laugh\r\nwhen he saw the sober look of care and thought with which Miss\r\nMarjoribanks examined her capabilities in the glass. It was not so much\r\nthe action itself that amused her father, as the consummate ability of\r\nthe young revolutionary. Dr Marjoribanks was Scotch, and had a respect\r\nfor "talent" in every development, as is natural to his nation. He did\r\nnot even give his daughter that credit for sincerity which she deserved,\r\nbut set it all to the score of her genius, which was complimentary,\r\ncertainly, in one point of view; but the fact was that Lucilla was\r\nperfectly sincere, and that she did what was natural to her under\r\nguidance of her genius, so as always to be in good fortune, just as Tom\r\nMarjoribanks, under the guidance of his, brought discredit even upon\r\nthose eternal ordinances of English government which fixed the time of\r\nthe Carlingford assizes. Lucilla was quite in earnest in thinking that\r\nthe colour of the drawing-room was an important matter, and that a woman\r\nof sense had very good reason for suiting it to her complexion--an idea\r\nwhich accordingly she proceeded to develop and explain.\r\n\r\n"For one can change one\'s dress," said Miss Marjoribanks, "as often as\r\none likes--at least as often, you know, as one has dresses to change;\r\nbut the furniture remains the same. I am always a perfect guy, whatever\r\nI wear, when I sit against a red curtain. You men say that a woman\r\nalways knows when she\'s good-looking, but I am happy to say _I_ know\r\nwhen I look a guy. What I mean is a delicate pale green, papa. For my\r\npart, I think it wears just as well as any other colour; and all the\r\npainters say it is the very thing for pictures. The carpet, of course,\r\nwould be a darker shade; and as for the chairs, it is not at all\r\nnecessary to keep to one colour. Both red and violet go beautifully with\r\ngreen, you know. I am sure Mr Holden and I could settle all about it\r\nwithout giving you any trouble."\r\n\r\n"Who told you, Lucilla," said the Doctor, "that I meant to refurnish the\r\nhouse?" He was even a little angry at her boldness, but at the same time\r\nhe was so much amused and pleased in his heart to have so clever a\r\ndaughter, that all the tones that could produce terror were softened out\r\nof his voice. "I never heard that was a sort of thing a man had to do\r\nfor his daughter," said Dr Marjoribanks; "and I would like to know what\r\nI should do with all that finery when you get married--as I suppose you\r\nwill by and by--and leave me alone in the house?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is the important question," said Tom. As usual, it was Tom\'s\r\nluck; but then, when there did happen to be a moment when he ought to be\r\nsilent, the unfortunate fellow could not help but speak.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I may marry some time," said Miss Marjoribanks, with composure;\r\n"it would be foolish, you know, to make any engagements; but that will\r\ndepend greatly upon how you behave, and how Carlingford behaves, papa.\r\nI give myself ten years here, if you should be very good. By twenty-nine\r\nI shall be going off a little, and perhaps it may be tiring, for\r\nanything I can tell. Ten years is a long time, and naturally, in the\r\nmeantime, I want to look as well as possible. Stop a minute; I forgot to\r\nput down the number of paces for the length. Tom, please to do it over\r\nagain for me; of course, your steps are a great deal longer than mine."\r\n\r\n"Tom is tired," said the Doctor; "and there are no new carpets coming\r\nout of my pockets. Besides, he\'s going to bed, and I\'m going downstairs\r\nto the library. We may as well bid you good-night."\r\n\r\nThese words, however, were addressed to deaf ears. Tom, as was natural,\r\nhad started immediately to obey Lucilla, as he was in duty bound; and\r\nthe old Doctor looked on with a little amazement and a little amusement,\r\nrecognising, with something of the surprise which that discovery always\r\ngives to fathers and mothers, that his visitor cared twenty times more\r\nfor what Lucilla said than for anything that his superior wisdom could\r\nsuggest. He would have gone off and left them as a couple of young\r\nfools, if it had not occurred to him all at once that since this sort of\r\nthing had begun, the last person in the world that he would choose to\r\nsee dancing attendance on his daughter was Tom Marjoribanks. Oddly\r\nenough, though he had just been finding fault with Providence for not\r\ngiving him a son instead of a daughter, he was not at all delighted nor\r\ngrateful when Providence put before him this simple method of providing\r\nhimself with the son he wanted. He took a great deal too much interest\r\nin Tom Marjoribanks to let him do anything so foolish; and as for\r\nLucilla, the idea that, after all her accomplishments, and her expensive\r\neducation, and her year on the Continent, she should marry a man who had\r\nnothing, disgusted the Doctor. He kept his seat accordingly, though he\r\nwas horribly bored by the drawing-room and its claims, and wanted very\r\nmuch to return to the library, and get into his slippers and his\r\ndressing-gown. It was rather a pretty picture, on the whole, which he\r\nwas regarding. Lucilla, perhaps, with a view to this discussion, had put\r\non green ribbons on the white dress which she always wore in the\r\nevening, and her tawny curls and fresh complexion carried off\r\ntriumphantly that difficult colour. Perhaps a critical observer might\r\nhave said that her figure was a little too developed and substantial\r\nfor these vestal robes; but then Miss Marjoribanks was young, and could\r\nbear it. She was standing by, not far from the fire, on the other side\r\nfrom the Doctor, looking on anxiously, while Tom measured the room with\r\nhis long steps. "I never said you were to stride," said Lucilla; "take\r\nmoderate steps, and don\'t be so silly. I was doing it myself famously if\r\nyou had not come in and interrupted me. It is frightful to belong to a\r\nfamily where the men are so stupid," said Miss Marjoribanks, with a sigh\r\nof real distress; for, to be sure, the unlucky Tom immediately bethought\r\nhimself to take small steps like those of a lady, which all but threw\r\nhim on his well-formed though meaningless nose. Lucilla shook her head\r\nwith an exasperated look, and contracted her lips with disdain, as he\r\npassed her on his ill-omened career. Of course he came right up against\r\nthe little table on which she had with her own hand arranged a bouquet\r\nof geraniums and mignonette. "It is what he always does," she said to\r\nthe Doctor calmly, as Tom arrived at that climax of his fate; and the\r\nlook with which she accompanied these words, as she rang the bell\r\nsmartly and promptly, mollified the Doctor\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"I can tell you the size of the room, if that is all you want," said Dr\r\nMarjoribanks. "I suppose you mean to give parties, and drive me out of\r\nmy senses with dancing and singing.--No, Lucilla, you must wait till you\r\nget married--that will never do for me."\r\n\r\n"Dear papa," said Lucilla sweetly, "it is so dreadful to hear you say\r\n_parties_. Everybody knows that the only thing I care for in life is to\r\nbe a comfort to you; and as for dancing, I saw at once that was out of\r\nthe question. Dancing is all very well," said Miss Marjoribanks\r\nthoughtfully; "but it implies quantities of young people--and young\r\npeople can never make what _I_ call society. It is _Evenings_ I mean to\r\nhave, papa. I am sure you want to go downstairs, and I suppose Tom would\r\nthink it civil to sit with me, though he is tired; so I will show you a\r\ngood example, and Thomas can pick up the table and the flowers at his\r\nleisure. Good-night, papa," said Lucilla, giving him her round fresh\r\ncheek to kiss. She went out of the room with a certain triumph, feeling\r\nthat she had fully signified her intentions, which is always an\r\nimportant matter; and shook hands in a condescending way with Tom, who\r\nhad broken his shins in a headlong rush to open the door. She looked at\r\nhim with an expression of mild despair, and shook her head again as she\r\naccorded him that sign of amity. "If you only would look a little where\r\nyou are going," said Miss Marjoribanks;--perhaps she meant the words to\r\nconvey an allegorical as well as a positive meaning, as so many people\r\nhave been found out to do--and then she pursued her peaceful way\r\nupstairs. As for the Doctor, he went off to his library rubbing his\r\nhands, glad to be released, and laughing softly at his nephew\'s abashed\r\nlooks. "She knows how to put _him_ down at least," the Doctor said to\r\nhimself, well pleased; and he was so much amused by his daughter\'s\r\nsuperiority to the vulgar festivity of parties, that he almost gave in\r\nto the idea of refurnishing the drawing-room to suit Lucilla\'s\r\ncomplexion. He rubbed his hands once more over the fire, and indulged in\r\na little laugh all by himself over that original idea. "So it is\r\nEvenings she means to have?" said the Doctor; and, to be sure, nothing\r\ncould be more faded than the curtains, and there were bits of the carpet\r\nin which the pattern was scarcely discernible. So that, on the whole, up\r\nto this point there seemed to be a reasonable prospect that Lucilla\r\nwould have everything her own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter VII_\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks had so many things to think of next morning that she\r\nfound her cousin, who was rather difficult to get rid of, much in her\r\nway: naturally the young man was briefless, and came on circuit for the\r\nname of the thing, and was quite disposed to dawdle the first morning,\r\nand attach himself to the active footsteps of Lucilla; and for her part,\r\nshe had things to occupy her so very much more important. For one thing,\r\none of Dr Marjoribanks\'s little dinner-parties was to take place that\r\nevening, which would be the first under the new r\xe9gime, and was\r\nnaturally a matter of some anxiety to all parties. "I shall go down and\r\nask Mrs Chiley to come with the Colonel," said Lucilla. "I have always\r\nmeant to do that. We can\'t have a full dinner-party, you know, as long\r\nas the house is so shabby; but I am sure Mrs Chiley will come to take\r\ncare of me."\r\n\r\n"To take care of you!--in your father\'s house! Do you think they\'ll\r\nbite?" said the Doctor grimly; but as for Lucilla, she was quite\r\nprepared for that.\r\n\r\n"I must have a chaperone, you know," she said. "I don\'t say it is not\r\nquite absurd; but then, at first, I always make it a point to give in to\r\nthe prejudices of society. That is how I have always been so\r\nsuccessful," said the experienced Lucilla. "I never went in the face of\r\nanybody\'s prejudices. Afterwards, you know, when one is known----"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor laughed, but at the same time he sighed. There was nothing to\r\nbe said against Mrs Chiley, who had, on the whole, as women go, a very\r\nsuperior training, and knew what a good dinner was; but it was the\r\nbeginning of the revolution of which Dr Marjoribanks, vaguely oppressed\r\nwith the idea of new paper, new curtains, and all that was involved in\r\nthe entrance of Mr Holden the upholsterer into the house, did not see\r\nthe end. He acquiesced, of course, since there was nothing else for it:\r\nbut it must be confessed that the spectre of Mrs Chiley sitting at his\r\nright hand clouded over for the Doctor the pleasant anticipation of the\r\nevening. If it had been possible to put her at the head of the table\r\nbeside Lucilla, whom she was to come to take care of, he could have\r\nborne it better--and to be sure it would have been a great deal more\r\nreasonable; but then that was absolutely out of the question, and the\r\nDoctor gave in with a sigh. Thus it was that he began to realise the\r\nmore serious result of that semi-abdication into which he had been\r\nbeguiled. The female element, so long peacefully ignored and kept at a\r\ndistance, had come in again in triumph and taken possession, and the\r\nDoctor knew too well by the experience of a long life what a restless\r\nand troublesome element it was. He had begun to feel that it had ceased\r\nto be precisely amusing as he took his place in his brougham. It was\r\ngood sport to see Lucilla make an end of Tom, and put her bridle upon\r\nthe stiff neck of Nancy; but when it came to changing the character of\r\nthe Doctor\'s dinners, his intellect naturally got more obtuse, and he\r\ndid not see the joke.\r\n\r\nAs for Tom, he had to be disposed of summarily. "Do go away," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks said, in her straightforward way. "You can come back to\r\nluncheon if you like;--that is to say, if you can pick up anybody that\r\nis very amusing, you may bring him here about half-past one, and if any\r\nof my friends have come to call by that time, I will give you lunch; but\r\nit must be somebody very amusing, or I will have nothing to say to you,"\r\nsaid Lucilla. And with this dismissal Tom Marjoribanks departed, not\r\nmore content than the Doctor; for, to be sure, the last thing in the\r\nworld which the poor fellow thought of was to bring somebody who was\r\namusing, to injure his chances with Lucilla. Tom, like most other\r\npeople, was utterly incapable of fathoming the grand conception which\r\ninspired Miss Marjoribanks. When she told him that it was the object of\r\nher life to be a comfort to papa, he believed it to a certain extent,\r\nbut it never occurred to him that filial devotion, though beautiful to\r\ncontemplate, would preserve Lucilla\'s heart from the ordinary dangers of\r\nyouth, or that she was at all in earnest in postponing all matrimonial\r\nintentions until she was nine-and-twenty, and had begun to "go off" a\r\nlittle. So he went away disconsolate enough, wavering between his\r\ninstinct of obedience and his desire of being in Lucilla\'s company, and\r\na desperate determination never to be the means of injuring himself by\r\npresenting to her anybody who was very amusing. All Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\n_monde_, as it happened, was a little out of humour that day. She had\r\ngone on so far triumphantly that it had now come to be necessary that\r\nshe should receive a little check in her victorious career.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom was disposed of, Miss Marjoribanks put on her hat and went down\r\nGrange Lane to carry her invitation to Mrs Chiley, who naturally was\r\nvery much pleased to come. "But, my dear, you must tell me what to put\r\non," the old lady said. "I don\'t think I have had anything new since you\r\nwere home last. I have heard so much about Dr Marjoribanks\'s dinners\r\nthat I feel a little excited, as if I was going to be made a freemason\r\nor something. There is my brown, you know, that I wear at home when we\r\nhave anybody--and my black velvet; and then there is my French gray that\r\nI got for Mary Chiley\'s marriage."\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley," said Lucilla, "it doesn\'t matter in the least what\r\nyou wear; there are only to be gentlemen, you know, and one never\r\ndresses for gentlemen. You must keep that beautiful black velvet for\r\nanother time."\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," said Mrs Chiley, "_I_ am long past that sort of\r\nthing--but the men think, you know, that it is always for them we\r\ndress."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Miss Marjoribanks, "their vanity is something dreadful--but\r\nit is one of my principles _never_ to dress unless there are ladies. A\r\nwhite frock, high in the neck," said Lucilla, with sweet simplicity--"as\r\nfor anything else, it would be bad style."\r\n\r\nMrs Chiley gave her young visitor a very cordial kiss when she went\r\naway. "The sense she has!" said the old lady; but at the same time the\r\nColonel\'s wife was so old-fashioned that this contemptuous way of\r\ntreating "The Gentlemen" puzzled her unprogressive intelligence. She\r\nthought it was superhuman virtue on Lucilla\'s part, nearly incredible,\r\nand yet established by proofs so incontestable that it would be a shame\r\nto doubt it; and she felt ashamed of herself--she who might have been a\r\ngrandmother, had such been the will of Providence--for lingering five\r\nminutes undecided between her two best caps. "I dare say Lucilla does\r\nnot spend so much time on such vanity, and she only nineteen," said the\r\npenitent old lady. As for Miss Marjoribanks, she returned up Grange Lane\r\nwith a mind at ease, and that consciousness of superior endowments\r\nwhich gives amiability and expansion even to the countenance. She did\r\nnot give any money to the beggar who at that period infested Grange Lane\r\nwith her six children, for that was contrary to those principles of\r\npolitical economy which she had studied with such success at Mount\r\nPleasant; but she stopped and asked her name, and where she lived, and\r\npromised to inquire into her case. "If you are honest and want to work,\r\nI will try to find you something to do," said Miss Marjoribanks; which,\r\nto be sure, was a threat appalling enough to keep her free from any\r\nfurther molestation on the part of that interesting family. But Lucilla,\r\nto do her justice, felt it equally natural that beneficence should issue\r\nfrom her in this manner as in that other mode of feeding the hungry\r\nwhich she was willing to adopt at half-past one, and had solemnly\r\nengaged herself to fulfil at seven o\'clock. She went up after that to Mr\r\nHolden\'s, and had a most interesting conversation, and found among his\r\nstores a delicious damask, softly, spiritually green, of which, to his\r\ngreat astonishment, she tried the effect in one of the great mirrors\r\nwhich ornamented the shop. "It is just the tint I want," Lucilla said,\r\nwhen she had applied that unusual test; and she left the fashionable\r\nupholsterer of Carlingford in a state of some uncertainty whether it was\r\ncurtains or dresses that Miss Marjoribanks meant to have made.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this confusion arose from the fact that Lucilla\'s mind was\r\noccupied in discussing the question whether she should not go round by\r\nGrove Street, and try that duet again with Barbara, and invite her to\r\nGrange Lane in the evening to electrify the little company; or whether,\r\nin case this latter idea might not be practicable, she should bring\r\nBarbara with her to lunch by way of occupying Tom Marjoribanks. Lucilla\r\nstood at Mr Holden\'s door for five seconds at least balancing the\r\nmatter; but finally she gave her curls a little shake, and took a quick\r\nstep forward, and without any more deliberation returned towards Grange\r\nLane; for, on the whole, it was better not to burst in full triumph all\r\nat once upon her constituency, and exhaust her forces at the beginning.\r\nIf she condescended to sing something herself, it would indeed be a\r\ngreater honour than her father\'s dinner-party, in strict justice, was\r\nentitled to; and as for the second question, though Miss Marjoribanks\r\nwas too happy in the confidence of her own powers to fear any rivals,\r\nand though her cousin\'s devotion bored her, still she felt doubtful how\r\nfar it was good policy to produce Barbara at luncheon for the purpose of\r\noccupying Tom. Other people might see her besides Tom, and her own grand\r\n_coup_ might be forestalled for anything she could tell; and then Tom\r\nhad some title to consideration on his own merits, though he was the\r\nunlucky member of the family. He might even, if he were so far left to\r\nhimself (though Miss Marjoribanks smiled at the idea), fall in love with\r\nBarbara; or, what was more likely, driven to despair by Lucilla\'s\r\nindifference, he might _pretend_ to fall in love; and Lucilla reflected,\r\nthat if anything happened she could never forgive herself. This was the\r\npoint she had arrived at when she shook her tawny curls and set out\r\nsuddenly on her return home.\r\n\r\nIt was now nearly one o\'clock, and it was quite possible that Tom, as\r\nwell as herself, might be on the way to Grange Lane; but Lucilla, who,\r\nas she said, made a point of never going against the prejudices of\r\nsociety, made up her mind to remain sweetly unconscious of the hour of\r\nluncheon, unless some lady came to keep her company. But then Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was always lucky, as she said. A quarter of an hour before\r\nTom applied for admission, Miss Bury came to pay Lucilla a visit. She\r\nhad been visiting in her district all the morning, and was very easily\r\npersuaded to repose herself a little; and then, naturally, she was\r\nanxious about her young friend\'s spiritual condition, and the effect\r\nupon her mind of a year\'s residence abroad. She was asking whether\r\nLucilla had not seen something soul-degrading and dishonouring to\r\nreligion in all the mummeries of Popery; and Miss Marjoribanks, who was\r\nperfectly orthodox, had replied to the question in the most satisfactory\r\nmanner; when Tom made his appearance, looking rather sheepish and\r\nreluctant, and followed by the "somebody amusing" whom Lucilla had\r\ncommissioned him to bring. He had struggled against his fate, poor\r\nfellow! but when it happens to be a man\'s instinct to do what he is\r\ntold, he can no more resist it than if it was a criminal impulse. Tom\r\nentered with his amusing companion, who had been chosen with care, and\r\nwas very uninviting to look at; and by and by Miss Bury, with the most\r\npuzzled looks, found herself listening to gossip about the theatres and\r\nall kinds of profane subjects. "I think they are going to hang that\r\nfellow that killed the tailor," said the amusing man; "that will stir\r\nyou up a little in Carlingford, I should suppose. It is as good as a\r\nplay for a country town. Of course, there will be a party that will get\r\nup a memorial, and prove that a man so kind-hearted never existed out of\r\nparadise; and there will be another party who will prove him to be\r\ninsane; and then at the end all the blackguards within a hundred miles\r\nwill crowd into Carlingford, and the fellow will be hanged, as he\r\ndeserves to be; but I assure you it\'s a famous amusement for a country\r\ntown."\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Miss Bury, with a tremulous voice, for her feelings had\r\novercome her, "when you speak of amusement, does it ever occur to you\r\nwhat will become of his miserable soul?"\r\n\r\n"I assure you, wretches of that description have no souls," said the\r\nyoung barrister, "or else, of course, I would not permit myself to speak\r\nso freely. It is a conclusion I have come to not rashly, but after many\r\nopportunities of observing," the young man went on with solemnity; "on\r\nthe whole, my opinion is, that this is the great difference between one\r\nportion of mankind and the other: that description of being, you may\r\ntake my word for it, has no soul."\r\n\r\n"I never take anybody\'s word for what is so plainly stated in the Holy\r\nScriptures," said Miss Bury; "I never heard any one utter such a\r\nterrible idea. I am sure I don\'t want to defend a--a murderer," cried\r\nthe Rector\'s sister, with agitation; "but I have heard of persons in\r\nthat unfortunate position coming to a heavenly frame of mind, and giving\r\nevery evidence of being truly converted. The law may take their lives,\r\nbut it is an awful thing--a truly dreadful thing," said Miss Bury,\r\ntrembling all over, "to try to take away their soul."\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense, Lucilla. By Jove! he does not mean that, you know," said\r\nTom, interposing to relieve his friend.\r\n\r\n"Do you believe in Jove, Mr Thomas Marjoribanks," said Miss Bury,\r\nlooking him in an alarming manner full in the face.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Tom grew red and then he grew green under this question\r\nand that awful look. "No, Miss Bury, I can\'t say I do," he answered\r\nhumbly; and the amusing man was so much less brotherly than Tom that he\r\nburst into unsympathetic laughter. As for Lucilla, it was the first real\r\ncheck she had sustained in the beginning of her career. There could not\r\nhave been a more unfortunate _contretemps_, and there is no telling how\r\ndisastrous the effect might have been, had not her courage and\r\ncoolness, not to say her orthodoxy, been equal to the occasion. She gave\r\nher cousin a look which was still more terrible than Miss Bury\'s, and\r\nthen she took affairs into her own hands.\r\n\r\n"It is dreadful sometimes to see what straits people are put to, to keep\r\nup the conversation," said Lucilla; "Tom in particular, for I think he\r\nhas a pleasure in talking nonsense. But you must not suppose I am of\r\nthat opinion. I remember quite well there was a dreadful man once here\r\nin jail for something, and Mr Bury made him the most beautiful\r\ncharacter! Every creature has a soul. I am sure we say so in the Creed\r\nevery day of our lives, and especially in that long creed where so many\r\npeople perish everlastingly. So far from laughing, it is quite dreadful\r\nto think of it," said Lucilla. "It is one of my principles never to\r\nlaugh about anything that has to do with religion. I always think it my\r\nduty to speak with respect. It has such a bad effect upon some minds.\r\nMiss Bury, if you will not take anything more, I think we had better go\r\nupstairs."\r\n\r\nTo think that Tom, whose luck, as usual, had betrayed him to such an\r\nunlooked-for extent, should have been on the point of following to the\r\ndrawing-room, was more than Miss Marjoribanks could comprehend; but\r\nfortunately his companion had more sense, and took his leave, taking his\r\nconductor with him. Miss Bury went upstairs in silence, sighing heavily\r\nfrom time to time. The good woman was troubled in her spirit at the\r\nevident depravity of the young men with whom circumstances had\r\nconstrained her to sit down at table, and she was sadly afraid that such\r\ncompanionship must have a debasing effect upon the mind of that lamb of\r\nthe flock now standing before her. Miss Bury bethought herself of Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s profane jokes, and the indifference he had shown to many\r\nthings in which it was his duty to have interested himself, and she\r\ncould not but look with tender pity in her young friend\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Poor dear," said Miss Bury, "it is dreadful indeed if this is the sort\r\nof society you are subjected to. I could recommend to Dr Marjoribanks a\r\nmost admirable woman, a true Christian, who would take charge of things\r\nand be your companion, Lucilla. It is not at all nice for you, at your\r\nage, to be obliged to receive young men like these alone."\r\n\r\n"I had you!" said Lucilla, taking both Miss Bury\'s hands. "I felt it was\r\nsuch a blessing. I would not have let Tom stay for luncheon if you had\r\nnot been there; and now I am so glad, because it has shown me the danger\r\nof letting him bring people. I am quite sure it was a special providence\r\nthat made you think of coming here to-day."\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," said Miss Bury, who was naturally mollified by this\r\nstatement of the question, "I am very glad to have been of use to you.\r\nIf there is anything I desire in this life, it is to be useful to my\r\nfellow-creatures, and to do my work while it is called day. I should not\r\nthink the time lost, my dear Lucilla, if I could only hope that I had\r\nimpressed upon your mind that an account must be given of every careless\r\nword----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Lucilla, "that is _so_ true; and besides, it is quite\r\nagainst my principles. I make it a point never to speak of anything\r\nabout religion except with the greatest respect; and I am quite sure it\r\nwas a special providence that I had _you_."\r\n\r\nMiss Bury took her farewell very affectionately, not to say effusively,\r\nafter this, with her heart melting over the ingenuous young creature who\r\nwas so thankful for her protection; but at the same time she left Miss\r\nMarjoribanks a prey to the horrible sensation of having made a failure.\r\nTo be sure, there was time to recover herself in the evening, which was,\r\nso to speak, her first formal appearance before the public of\r\nCarlingford. Tom was so ill-advised as to come in when she was having\r\nher cup of tea before dinner to fortify her for her exertions; and the\r\nreception he met with may be left to the imagination. But, after all,\r\nthere was little satisfaction in demolishing Tom; and then Lucilla had\r\nknown from the beginning that the success of her undertaking depended\r\nentirely on herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter VIII_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening passed off in a way which, if Miss Marjoribanks had been an\r\nordinary woman, would have altogether obliterated from her mind all\r\nrecollection of the failure at lunch. To speak first of the most\r\nimportant particular, the dinner was perfect. As for the benighted men\r\nwho had doubted Lucilla, they were covered with shame, and, at the same\r\ntime, with delight. If there had been a fault in Dr Marjoribanks\'s table\r\nunder the ancient r\xe9gime, it lay in a certain want of variety, and\r\noccasional over-abundance, which wounded the feelings of young Mr\r\nCavendish, who was a person of refinement. To-night, as that\r\naccomplished critic remarked, there was a certain air of feminine grace\r\ndiffused over everything--and an amount of doubt and expectation,\r\nunknown to the composed feastings of old, gave interest to the meal. As\r\nfor the Doctor, he found Mrs Chiley, at his right hand, not so great a\r\nbore as he expected. She was a woman capable of appreciating the\r\ntriumphs of art that were set before her; and had indeed been trained to\r\nas high a pitch of culture in this respect as perhaps is possible to the\r\nfemale intelligence; and then her pride and delight in being admitted to\r\na participation in those sacred mysteries was beyond expression. "My\r\ndear Lucilla, I feel exactly as if I was going to be made a freemason;\r\nand as if your dear good papa had to blindfold me, and make me swear all\r\nsorts of things before he took me downstairs," she said, as they sat\r\ntogether waiting for the commencement of the ceremony; and when the two\r\nladies returned to the drawing-room, Mrs Chiley took Lucilla in her arms\r\nand gave her a kiss, as the only way of expressing adequately her\r\nenthusiasm. "My love," said the Colonel\'s wife, "I never realised before\r\nwhat it was to have a genius. You should be very thankful to Providence\r\nfor giving you such a gift. I have given dinners all my life--that is,\r\nall my married life, my dear, which comes to almost the same thing, for\r\nI was only a baby--but I never could come up to anything like that,"\r\nsaid Mrs Chiley, with tears in her eyes. As for Miss Marjoribanks, she\r\nwas so satisfied with her success that she felt at liberty to\r\ntranquillise her old friend.\r\n\r\n"I am sure you always give very nice dinners," she said; "and then, you\r\nknow, the Colonel has his favourite dishes--whereas, I must say for\r\npapa, he is very reasonable for a man. I am so glad you are pleased. It\r\nis very kind of you to say it is genius, but I don\'t pretend to anything\r\nbut paying great attention and studying the combinations. There is\r\nnothing one cannot manage if one only takes the trouble. Come here to\r\nthis nice easy-chair--it is so comfortable. It is so nice to have a\r\nlittle moment to ourselves before they come upstairs."\r\n\r\n"That is what I always say," said Mrs Chiley; "but there are not many\r\ngirls so sensible as you, Lucilla. I hear them all saying it is so much\r\nbetter French fashion. Of course, I am an old woman, and like things in\r\nthe old style."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it is because I am more sensible," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, with modesty. "I don\'t pretend to be better than other\r\npeople. It is because I have thought it all over, you know--and then I\r\nwent through a course of political economy when I was at Mount\r\nPleasant," Lucilla said tranquilly, with an air of having explained the\r\nwhole matter, which much impressed her hearer. "But for all that,\r\nsomething dreadful happened to-day. Tom brought in one of his friends\r\nwith him, you know, and Miss Bury was here, and they talked--I want to\r\ntell you, in case she should say something, and then you will know what\r\nto believe. I never felt so dreadfully ashamed in my life--they\r\ntalked----"\r\n\r\n"My dear! not anything improper, I hope," cried the old lady, in dismay.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Lucilla; "but they began laughing about some people\r\nhaving no souls, you know--as if there could be anybody without a\r\nsoul--and poor Miss Bury nearly fainted. You may think what a dreadful\r\nthing it was for me."\r\n\r\n"My dear child, if that was all," said Mrs Chiley, reassured--"as for\r\neverybody having a soul, I am sure I cannot say. You never were in\r\nIndia, to be sure; but Miss Bury should have known better than to faint\r\nat a young man\'s talk, and frighten you, my poor dear. She ought to be\r\nashamed of herself, at her age. Do you think Tom has turned out clever?"\r\nthe old lady continued, not without a little finesse, and watching\r\nLucilla with a curious eye.\r\n\r\n"Not in the very least," said Miss Marjoribanks calmly; "he is just as\r\nawkward as he used to be. It is dreadful to have him here just now, when\r\nI have so many things to do--and then he would follow me about\r\neverywhere if I would let him. A cousin of that sort is always in the\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"I am always afraid of a cousin, for my part," said Mrs Chiley; "and\r\ntalking of that, what do you think of Mr Cavendish, Lucilla? He is very\r\nnice in himself, and he has a nice property; and some people say he has\r\na very good chance to be member for Carlingford when there is an\r\nelection. I think that is just what would suit you."\r\n\r\n"I could not see him for the lamp," said Lucilla; "it was right between\r\nus, you know--but it is no use talking of that sort of thing just now.\r\nOf course, if I had liked, I never need have come home at all," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks added, with composure; "and, now I have come home, I have\r\ngot other things to think of. If papa is good, I will not think of\r\nleaving him for ten years."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I have heard girls say that before," said Mrs Chiley; "but\r\nthey always changed their minds. You would not like to be an old maid,\r\nLucilla; and in ten years----"\r\n\r\n"I should have begun to go off a little, no doubt," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. "No, I can\'t say I wish to be an old maid. Can they be\r\ncoming upstairs already, do you think? Oh, it is Tom, I suppose," said\r\nLucilla, with a little indignation. But when _They_ did make their\r\nappearance, which was at a tolerably early period--for a return to the\r\ndrawing-room was quite a novelty for Dr Marjoribanks\'s friends, and\r\ntempted them accordingly--Miss Marjoribanks was quite ready to receive\r\nthem. And just before ten o\'clock, when Mrs Chiley began to think of\r\ngoing home, Lucilla, without being asked, and without indeed a word of\r\npreface, suddenly went to the piano, and before anybody knew, had\r\ncommenced to sing. She was a great deal too sensible to go into high art\r\non this occasion, or to electrify her father\'s friends with her\r\nnewly-acquired Italian, or even with German, as some young ladies do.\r\nShe sang them a ballad out of one of those treasures of resuscitated\r\nballads which the new generation had then begun to dig out of the bowels\r\nof the earth. There was not, to tell the truth, a great deal of music\r\nin it, which proved Lucilla\'s disinterestedness. "I only sang it to\r\namuse you," she said, when all the world crowded to the piano; and for\r\nthat night she was not to be persuaded to further exertions. Thus Miss\r\nMarjoribanks proved to her little public that power of subordinating her\r\npersonal tastes and even her vanity to her great object, which more than\r\nanything else demonstrates a mind made to rule. "I hope next time you\r\nwill be more charitable, and not tantalise us in this way," Mr Cavendish\r\nsaid, as he took his leave; and Lucilla retired from the scene of her\r\ntriumph, conscious of having achieved entire success in her first\r\nappearance in Carlingford. She laid her head upon her pillow with that\r\nsweet sense of an approving conscience which accompanies the footsteps\r\nof the benefactors of their kind. But even Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\nsatisfaction was not without its drawbacks. She could not get out of her\r\nmind that unhappy abortive luncheon and all its horrors; not to speak of\r\nthe possibility of her religious principles being impugned, which was\r\ndreadful in itself ("for people can stand a man being sceptical, you\r\nknow," Miss Marjoribanks justly observed, "but everybody knows how\r\nunbecoming it is in a woman--and me who have such a respect for\r\nreligion!"); there remained the still more alarming chance that Miss\r\nBury, who was so narrow-minded, might see something improper in the\r\npresence of the two young men at Lucilla\'s maidenly table; for, to be\r\nsure, the Rector\'s sister was altogether incapable of grasping the idea\r\nthat young men, like old men and the other less interesting members of\r\nthe human family, were simple material for Miss Marjoribanks\'s genius,\r\nout of which she had a great result to produce. This was the dread that\r\novershadowed the mind of Lucilla as she composed herself to rest after\r\nher fatigues. When she slept the sleep of the innocent, it still pursued\r\nher into her dreams. She dreamed that she stood at the altar by the side\r\nof the member for Carlingford, and that Mr Bury, with inflexible\r\ncruelty, insisted upon marrying her to Tom Marjoribanks instead; and\r\nthen the scene changed, and instead of receiving the salutations of Mr\r\nCavendish as M.P. for the borough, it was the amusing man, in the\r\ncharacter of the defeated candidate, who grinned and nodded at her, and\r\nsaid from the hustings that he would never forget the luncheon that had\r\nbeen his first introduction to Carlingford. Such was the nightmare that\r\npursued Lucilla even into the sphere of dreams.\r\n\r\nWhen such a presentiment takes possession of a well-balanced mind like\r\nthat of Miss Marjoribanks, it may be accepted as certain that something\r\nis likely to follow. Lucilla did her best to disarm fate, not only by\r\nthe sweetest submission and dutifulness to the Doctor and his wishes,\r\nbut by a severe disregard of Tom, which drove that unhappy young man\r\nnearly desperate. Far from saying anything about luncheon, she even\r\nignored his presence at breakfast, and remained calmly unconscious of\r\nhis empty cup, until he had to ask for some coffee in an injured and\r\npathetic voice, which amused Dr Marjoribanks beyond description. But\r\neven this did not prove sufficient to propitiate the Fates. When They\r\nwere gone--and it may be well to say that Lucilla used this pronoun to\r\nsignify _the gentlemen_, in greater or smaller number as it might\r\nhappen--and she had finished all her arrangements, Miss Marjoribanks\r\ndecided upon going to Grove Street to pay Barbara Lake a visit, and\r\npractise some duets, which was certainly as innocent an occupation for\r\nher leisure as could be desired. She was putting on her hat with this\r\nobject when the bell in the garden rang solemnly, and Lucilla, whose\r\ncuriosity conquered her good manners for the moment, hastening to the\r\nwindow, saw Mr Bury himself enter the garden, accompanied by a black\r\nfigure in deep and shabby mourning. All the tremors of the night rushed\r\nback upon her mind at the sight. She felt that the moment had arrived\r\nfor a trial of her courage very different from the exertions which had\r\nhitherto sufficed her. Nothing but the most solemn intentions could have\r\nsupported the Rector in that severe pose of his figure and features,\r\nevery line in which revealed an intention of being "faithful"; and the\r\naccompanying mute in black, whose office the culprit could not divine,\r\nhad a veil over her face, and wore a widow\'s dress. Miss Marjoribanks,\r\nit is true, was not a woman to be discouraged by appearances, but she\r\nfelt her heart beat as she collected all her powers to meet this\r\nmysterious assault. She took off her hat with an instinctive certainty\r\nthat, for this morning at least, the duet was impracticable, when she\r\nheard Mr Bury\'s steady step ascending the stairs; but, notwithstanding,\r\nit was with a perfectly cheerful politeness that she bade him welcome\r\nwhen he came into the room. "It is so good of you to come," Lucilla\r\nsaid; "you that have so much to do. I scarcely could believe it when I\r\nsaw you come in: I thought it must be for papa."\r\n\r\n"I did hope to find Dr Marjoribanks," said the Rector, "but as he is not\r\nat home, I thought it best to come to you. This is Mrs Mortimer," said\r\nMr Bury, taking the chair Lucilla had indicated with a certain want of\r\nobservance of his companion which betrayed to the keen perceptions of\r\nMiss Marjoribanks that she was a dependant of some kind or other. The\r\nRector was a very good man, but was Evangelical, and had a large female\r\ncircle who admired and swore by him; and, consequently, he felt it in a\r\nmanner natural that he should take his seat first, and the place that\r\nbelonged to him as the principal person present; and then, to be sure,\r\nhis mission here was for Mrs Mortimer\'s as well as Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\n"good." After this introduction, the figure in black put up its veil,\r\nand revealed a deprecating woman, with a faint sort of pleading smile on\r\nher face. Probably she was making believe to smile at the position in\r\nwhich she found herself; but anyhow she took her seat humbly on another\r\nchair at a little distance, and waited, as Lucilla did, for the next\r\ngolden words that it might please the Rector to say.\r\n\r\n"My sister told me what happened yesterday," said Mr Bury. "She is very\r\nsorry for you, Miss Marjoribanks. It is sad for you to be left alone so\r\nyoung, and without a mother, and exposed to--to temptations which it is\r\ndifficult to withstand at your age. Indeed, at all ages, we have great\r\noccasion to pray not to be led into temptation; for the heart of man is\r\nterribly deceitful. After hearing what she had to say, I thought it best\r\nto come up at once this morning and talk to Dr Marjoribanks. I am sure\r\nhis natural good sense will teach him that you ought not to be left\r\nalone in the house."\r\n\r\n"I do not see how papa can help it," said Lucilla. "I am sure it is very\r\nsad for him as well; but since dear mamma died there has been nobody but\r\nme to be a comfort to him. I think he begins to look a little cheerful\r\nnow," Miss Marjoribanks continued, with beautiful simplicity, looking\r\nher adversary in the face. "Everybody knows that to be a comfort to him\r\nis the object of my life."\r\n\r\n"That is a very good feeling," said the Rector, "but it does not do to\r\ndepend too much upon our feelings. You are too young to be placed in a\r\nposition of so much responsibility, and open to so much temptation. I\r\nwas deeply grieved for Dr Marjoribanks when his partner in life was\r\ntaken from him; but my dear Miss Lucilla, now you have come home, who\r\nstand so much in need of a mother\'s care, we must try to find some one\r\nto fill her place."\r\n\r\nLucilla uttered a scream of genuine alarm and dismay; and then she came\r\nto herself, and saw the force of her position. She had it in her power\r\nto turn the tables on the Rector, and she did not hesitate, as a weaker\r\nwoman might have done, out of consideration for anybody\'s feelings. "Do\r\nyou mean you have found some one for him to marry?" she asked, with a\r\nlook of artless surprise, bending her earnest gaze on Mr Bury\'s face.\r\n\r\nAs for the Rector, he looked at Lucilla aghast, like a man caught in a\r\ntrap. "Of course not, of course not," he stammered, after his first\r\npause of consternation; and then he had to stop again to take breath.\r\nLucilla kept up the air of amazement and consternation which had come\r\nnaturally at the first, and had her eyes fixed on him, leaning forward\r\nwith all the eager anxiety natural to the circumstances, and the\r\nunfortunate clergyman reddened from the edge of his white cravat to the\r\nroots of his gray hair. He was almost as sensitive to the idea of having\r\nproposed something improper as his sister could have been, though\r\nindeed, at the worst, there would have been nothing improper in it had\r\nDr Marjoribanks made up his mind to another wife.\r\n\r\n"It is very dreadful for me that am so young to go against _you_" said\r\nLucilla; "but if it is _that_, I cannot be expected to take any part in\r\nit--it would not be natural. It is the great object of my life to be a\r\ncomfort to papa; but if that is what you mean, I could not give in to\r\nit. I am sure Miss Bury would understand me," said Miss Marjoribanks;\r\nand she looked so nearly on the point of tears, that the Rector\'s\r\nanxious disclaimer found words for itself.\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the kind, my dear Miss Lucilla--nothing of the kind," cried\r\nMr Bury; "such an idea never came into my mind. I cannot imagine how I\r\ncould have said anything--I can\'t fancy what put such an idea----Mrs\r\nMortimer, you are not going away?"\r\n\r\nLucilla had already seen with the corner of her eye that the victim had\r\nstarted violently, and that her heavy veil had fallen over her face--but\r\nshe had not taken any notice, for there are cases in which it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to have a victim. By this time, however, the poor\r\nwoman had risen in her nervous, undecided way.\r\n\r\n"I had better go--I am sure I had better go," she said hurriedly,\r\nclasping together a pair of helpless hands, as if they could find a\r\nlittle strength in union. "Miss Marjoribanks will understand you better,\r\nand you will perhaps understand Miss Marjoribanks----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, sit down, sit down," said Mr Bury, who was not tolerant of\r\nfeelings. "Perhaps I expressed myself badly. What I meant to say was,\r\nthat Mrs Mortimer, who has been a little unfortunate in\r\ncircumstances--sit down, pray--had by a singular providence just applied\r\nto me when my sister returned home yesterday. These things do not happen\r\nby chance, Lucilla. We are taken care of when we are not thinking of it.\r\nMrs Mortimer is a Christian lady for whom I have the greatest respect. A\r\nsituation to take the superintendence of the domestic affairs, and to\r\nhave charge of you, would be just what would suit her. It must be a\r\ngreat anxiety to the Doctor to leave you alone, and without any control,\r\nat your age. You may think the liberty is pleasant at first, but if you\r\nhad a Christian friend to watch over and take care of you----What is the\r\nmatter?" said the Rector, in great alarm. It was only that the poor\r\nwidow who was to have charge of Lucilla, according to his benevolent\r\nintention, looked so like fainting, that Miss Marjoribanks jumped up\r\nfrom her chair and rang the bell hastily. It was not Lucilla\'s way to\r\nlose time about anything; she took the poor woman by the shoulders and\r\nall but lifted her to the sofa, where she was lying down with her bonnet\r\noff when the Rector came to his senses. To describe the feelings with\r\nwhich Mr Bury contemplated this little _entr\'acte_, which was not in his\r\nprogramme, would be beyond our powers. He went off humbly and opened the\r\nwindow when he was told to do so, and tried to find the eau-de-Cologne\r\non the table; while Thomas rushed downstairs for water at a pace very\r\nunlike his usual steady rate of progress. As for Lucilla, she stood by\r\nthe side of her patient quite self-possessed, while the Rector looked so\r\nfoolish. "She will be all right directly," Miss Marjoribanks was saying;\r\n"luckily she never went right off. When you don\'t go right off, lying\r\ndown is everything. If there had been any one to run and get some water\r\nshe would have got over it; but luckily I saw it in time." What possible\r\nanswer Mr Bury could make to this, or how he could go on with his\r\naddress in sight of the strange turn things had taken, it would have\r\nbeen hard to say. Fortunately for the moment he did not attempt it, but\r\nwalked about in dismay, and put himself in the draught (with his\r\nrheumatism), and felt dreadfully vexed and angry with Mrs Mortimer, who,\r\nfor her part, now she had done with fainting, manifested an inclination\r\nto cry, for which Mr Bury in his heart could have whipped her, had that\r\nmode of discipline been permitted in the Church of England. Lucilla was\r\nmerciful, but she could not help taking a little advantage of her\r\nvictory. She gave the sufferer a glass of water, and the eau-de-Cologne\r\nto keep her from a relapse, and whispered to her to lie quiet; and then\r\nshe came back and took her seat, and begged the Rector not to stand in\r\nthe draught.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she is strong," said Miss Marjoribanks confidentially,\r\nwhen she had wiled the disconcerted clergyman back to her side, "her\r\ncolour changes so; she never would be able for what there is to do here,\r\neven if papa would consent to think of it. For my part I am sure I\r\nshould be glad of a little assistance," said Lucilla, "but I never like\r\nto give false hopes, and I don\'t think papa would consent;--she looks\r\nnice if she was not so weak, poor thing!--and there are such quantities\r\nof things to be done here: but if you wish it, Mr Bury, I will speak to\r\npapa," said Miss Marjoribanks, lifting her eyes, which were so open and\r\nstraightforward, to the Rector\'s face.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, he did not in the least know what to say, and the\r\nchances are he would not have been half so vexed and angry, nor felt in\r\nso unchristian a disposition with the poor woman on the sofa, had he\r\nmeant to do her harm instead of good. "Yes, I should be glad if you\r\nwould mention it to Dr Marjoribanks," he said, without very well knowing\r\nwhat he said; and got up to shake hands with Lucilla, and then\r\nrecollected that he could not leave his prot\xe9g\xe9e behind him, and\r\nhesitated, and did not know what to do. He was really grateful, without\r\nbeing aware of it, to Miss Marjoribanks, when once again she came to his\r\naid.\r\n\r\n"Please, leave her a little," said Lucilla, "and I can make acquaintance\r\nwith her, you know, in case papa should be disposed to think of it;--she\r\nmust lie still till it quite wears off. I would ask you to stay to lunch\r\nif I was not afraid of wasting your precious time----"\r\n\r\nMr Bury gave a little gasp of indignation, but he did not say anything.\r\nOn the whole, even though smarting under the indignity of being asked to\r\nlunch, as his sister had been, when probably there might be a repetition\r\nof the scene of yesterday, he was glad to get safely out of the house,\r\neven at the risk of abandoning his enterprise. As for a woman in want of\r\na situation, who had so little common sense as to faint at such a\r\ncritical moment, the Rector was disposed to wash his hands of her; for\r\nMr Bury, "like them all," as Lucilla said, was horribly frightened by a\r\nfaint when he saw one, and afterwards pretended to disbelieve it, and\r\ncalled it one of the things which a little self-command could always\r\nprevent. When he was gone Miss Marjoribanks felt the full importance of\r\nher victory; and then, though she had not hesitated to sacrifice this\r\npoor woman when it was necessary to have a victim, that moment was over,\r\nand she had no pleasure in being cruel; on the contrary, she went and\r\nsat by her patient, and talked, and was very kind to her; and after a\r\nwhile heard all her story, and was more comforting than the Rector could\r\nhave been for his life.\r\n\r\n"I knew it would hurt your feelings," Miss Marjoribanks said candidly,\r\n"but I could not do anything else--and you know it was Mr Bury\'s fault;\r\nbut I am sure if I can be of any use to you----" It was thus that\r\nLucilla added, without knowing it, another complication to her fortunes;\r\nbut then, to be sure, clear-sighted as she was, she could not see into\r\nthe future, nor know what was to follow. She told the Doctor in the\r\nevening with the greatest faithfulness, and described how Mr Bury\r\nlooked, and that she had said she did not think papa would be disposed\r\nto think of it; and Dr Marjoribanks was so much entertained that he came\r\nupstairs to hear the end, and took a cup of tea. It was the third night\r\nin succession that the Doctor had taken this step, though it was against\r\nhis principles; and thus it will be seen that good came out of evil in a\r\nbeautifully distinct and appropriate way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter IX_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not till Miss Marjoribanks had surmounted to a certain extent the\r\nvexation caused her by her unlucky confidence in Tom, that that unhappy\r\nyoung man took the step which Lucilla had so long dreaded, but which she\r\ntrusted to her own genius to hinder him from carrying into execution.\r\nMiss Marjoribanks had extricated herself so triumphantly from the\r\nconsequences of that unhappy commencement of her very charming\r\nluncheon-parties, that she had begun to forget the culpability of her\r\ncousin. She had defeated the Rector in his benevolent intentions, and\r\nshe had taken up his prot\xe9g\xe9e just at the moment when Mr Bury was most\r\ndisgusted with the unfortunate woman\'s weakness. Poor Mrs Mortimer, to\r\nbe sure, had fainted, or had been near fainting, at the most inopportune\r\nmoment, and it was only natural that the Rector should be annoyed; but\r\nas for Lucilla, who was always prompt in her actions, and whose good\r\nnature and liberality were undoubted, she found her opportunity in the\r\nfailure of Mr Bury\'s scheme. After the Rector had gone away, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks herself conducted the widow home; and by this time Mrs\r\nMortimer\'s prospects were beginning to brighten under the active and\r\nefficient patronage of her new friend. This being the case, Lucilla\'s\r\ngood humour was perfectly restored, and she had forgiven Tom his\r\nmaladroitness. "He cannot help it, you know," she said privately to old\r\nMrs Chiley: "I suppose some people are born to do ridiculous things."\r\nAnd it was indeed as if he had intended to give a practical illustration\r\nof the truth of this conclusion that Tom chose the particular moment he\r\ndid for driving Miss Marjoribanks to the extremity of her patience. The\r\nupholsterers were in the house, and indeed had just finished putting up\r\nthe pictures on the new paper in the drawing-room (which was green, as\r\nLucilla had determined it should be, of the most delicate tint, and\r\nlooked, as she flattered herself, exactly like silk hangings); and Mr\r\nHolden himself waited with a certain complaisance for Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s opinion of the effect. He had no doubt on the subject\r\nhimself; but he was naturally impressed, as most people were, with that\r\nconfidence in Lucilla\'s judgment which so much facilitates the\r\noperations of those persons who are born to greatness. It was precisely\r\nat this moment that his evil genius persuaded Tom Marjoribanks to\r\ninterrupt Thomas, who was carrying Mr Holden\'s message to his young\r\nmistress, and to shut the library door upon the external world. Lucilla\r\nhad taken refuge in the library during the renovation of the\r\ndrawing-room; and she was aware that this was Tom\'s last day at\r\nCarlingford, and had no intention of being unkind to him. To tell the\r\ntruth, she had at the bottom of her heart a certain regard and impulse\r\nof protection and patronage towards Tom, of which something might have\r\ncome had the unlucky fellow known how to manage. But, at the same time,\r\nMiss Marjoribanks was aware that things must be approaching a crisis\r\nupstairs, and was listening intently to the movements overhead, and\r\nwondering why she was not sent for. This was the moment of all others at\r\nwhich Tom thought fit to claim a hearing; and the state of Lucilla\'s\r\nfeelings may be easily imagined when she saw him plant himself by her\r\nside, with his face alternately red and white, and all the signs of a\r\ndesperate resolution in his countenance. For the first time in her life\r\na certain despair took possession of Miss Marjoribanks\'s mind. The\r\nsounds had suddenly ceased upstairs, as if the artists were making a\r\npause to contemplate the effect of their completed work--which indeed\r\nwas precisely the case--and at the same time nobody came to call her,\r\nimportant though the occasion was. She made a last effort to emancipate\r\nherself before it was too late.\r\n\r\n"Ring, please, Tom," she said; "I want to know if they have finished\r\nupstairs. I am so sorry you are going away; but you know it is one of my\r\nprinciples never to neglect my duty. I am sure they must be waiting for\r\nme--if you would only be kind enough to ring."\r\n\r\n"Lucilla," said Tom, "you know I would do anything in the world you\r\nliked to tell me; but don\'t ask me to ring just now: I am going to leave\r\nyou, and there is something I must say to you, Lucilla," said the young\r\nman, with agitation. Miss Marjoribanks was seated near the window, and\r\nshe had a moral certainty that if any of the Browns happened to be in\r\nthat ridiculous glass-house where they did their photography, they must\r\nhave a perfectly good view of her, with Tom in the background, who had\r\nplaced himself so as to shut her into the recess of the window. This,\r\ncoupled with the evidence of her senses that the workmen up stairs had\r\nceased their work, and that a slow footstep traversing the floor now and\r\nthen was all that was audible, drove Lucilla to despair.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, temporising a little, which was the only thing she\r\ncould do, "I am sure I am very sorry; but then, you know, with the house\r\nin such a condition! Next time you come I shall be able to enjoy your\r\nsociety," said the designing young woman; "but at present I am _so_\r\nbusy. It is one of my principles, you know, that things are never\r\nrightly done if the lady of the house does not pay proper attention.\r\nThey are sure to make some dreadful mistake upstairs if I don\'t look\r\nafter them. I shall see you again before you go."\r\n\r\n"Lucilla, don\'t be so cruel!" cried the unlucky Tom, and he caught her\r\nhand though they were at the window; "do stop a moment and listen to me.\r\nLucilla! what does it matter about furniture and things when a man\'s\r\nheart is bursting?" cried the unfortunate lover; and just at that moment\r\nMiss Marjoribanks could see that the curtain was drawn aside a\r\nlittle--ever so little--in the glass-house. She sat down again with a\r\nsigh, and drew her hand away, and prepared herself to meet her fate with\r\nheroism at least.\r\n\r\n"What in the world can you have been doing?" said Lucilla innocently;\r\n"you used always to tell me, you know, when you got into any difficulty,\r\nand I am sure if I can be of any use to you, Tom----But as for furniture\r\nand things, they matter a great deal, I assure you, to people\'s\r\nhappiness; and then, you know, it is the object of my life to be a\r\ncomfort to dear papa."\r\n\r\nWhen she said this, Miss Marjoribanks settled herself again in the\r\nrecess of the window, so that the Miss Browns could command a full view\r\nif they chose; for Lucilla\'s courage was of the highest order, and\r\nnothing, except, perhaps, a strategical necessity of profound\r\nimportance, would have moved her to retreat before an enemy. As for Tom,\r\nhe was bewildered, to start with, by this solemn repetition of her great\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n"I know how good you are, Lucilla," he said, with humility; "but then my\r\nuncle, you know--I don\'t think he is a man to appreciate----Oh,\r\nLucilla! why should you go and sacrifice to him the happiness of your\r\nlife?"\r\n\r\n"Tom," said Miss Marjoribanks, with some solemnity, "I wish you would\r\nnot talk to me of happiness. I have always been brought up to believe\r\nthat duty was happiness; and everybody has known for a long time what\r\nwas the object of my life. As for poor papa, it is the worse for him if\r\nhe does not understand; but that does not make any difference to my\r\nduty," said the devoted daughter. She gave a little sigh as she spoke,\r\nthe sigh of a great soul, whose motives must always remain to some\r\nextent unappreciated; and the sight of her resignation and beautiful\r\nperseverance overwhelmed her unlucky suitor; for indeed, up to this\r\nmoment, Lucilla still entertained the hope of preventing Tom from, as\r\nshe herself described it, "saying the very words," which, to be sure,\r\nare awkward words to hear and to say.\r\n\r\n"Lucilla, when you are so good to my uncle, you ought to have a little\r\npity on me," said Tom, driven to the deepest despondency. "How do you\r\nthink I can bear it, to see you getting everything done here, as if you\r\nmeant to stay all your life--when you know I love you?" said the\r\nunfortunate young man; "when you know I have always been so fond of you,\r\nLucilla, and always looked forward to the time----; and now it is very\r\nhard to see you care so little for me."\r\n\r\n"Tom," said Miss Marjoribanks, with indignant surprise, "how _can_ you\r\nsay I care little for you? you know I was always very fond of you, on\r\nthe contrary. I am sure I always stood your friend at home, whatever\r\nhappened, and never said a word when you broke that pretty little pearl\r\nring I was so fond of, and tore the scarf that my aunt gave me. I\r\nwonder, for my part, how you can be so unkind as so say so. We have\r\nalways been the very best friends in the world," said Lucilla, with an\r\nair of injury. "I always said at school I liked you the best of all my\r\ncousins; and I am very fond of all my cousins." Miss Marjoribanks\r\nconcluded, after a little pause, "It is so unkind to tell me that I\r\ndon\'t care for _you_."\r\n\r\nPoor Tom groaned within himself as he listened. He did not know what to\r\nanswer to Lucilla\'s aggrieved yet frank confession. Naturally it would\r\nhave been much less displeasing to Tom to understand that she hated him,\r\nand never desired to see him any more. But Miss Marjoribanks was far\r\nfrom entertaining any such unchristian sentiments. She even began to\r\nforget her anxiety about what was going on upstairs in that delightful\r\nsense of power and abundant resources with which she was mastering the\r\npresent difficulty. She reflected in herself that though it was\r\nexcessively annoying to be thus occupied at such a moment, still it was\r\nnearly as important to make an end of Tom as to see that the pictures\r\nwere hung rightly; for, to be sure, it was always easy to return to the\r\nlatter subject. Accordingly, she drew her chair a little nearer to the\r\nwindow, and regarded Tom with a calm gaze of benevolent interest which\r\nwas in perfect accordance with the sentiments she had just expressed; a\r\nlook in which a gentle reproach was mingled. "I have always been like a\r\nsister to you," said Lucilla; "how can you be so unkind as to say I\r\ndon\'t care?"\r\n\r\nAs for the unhappy Tom, he got up, as was natural, and took a little\r\nwalk in front of the table, as a young man in trouble is apt to do. "You\r\nknow very well that is not what I mean, Lucilla," he said\r\ndisconsolately. "It is you who are unkind. I don\'t know why it is that\r\nladies are so cruel; I am not such a snob as to persecute anybody. But\r\nwhat is the good of pretending not to know what I mean?"\r\n\r\n"Tom, listen!" cried Miss Marjoribanks, rising in her turn; "I feel sure\r\nthey must have finished. There is Mr Holden going through the garden.\r\nAnd everybody knows that hanging pictures is just the thing of all\r\nothers that requires a person of taste. If they have spoiled the room,\r\nit will be all your fault."\r\n\r\n"Oh, for Heaven\'s sake never mind the room!" said Tom. "I never thought\r\nyou would have trifled with a man, Lucilla. You know quite well what I\r\nmean; you know it isn\'t a--a new thing," said the lover, beginning to\r\nstammer and get confused. "You know that is what I have been thinking of\r\nall along, as soon as ever I had anything to live on. I love you,\r\nLucilla; you know I love you! how can you trifle with me so?"\r\n\r\n"It is you who are trifling," said Miss Marjoribanks, "especially when\r\nyou know I have really something of importance to do. You can come\r\nupstairs with me if you like. Of course we all love each other. What is\r\nthe good of being relations otherwise?" said Lucilla calmly; "it is such\r\na natural thing, you know. I suppose it is because you are going away\r\nthat you are so affectionate to-day. It is very nice of you, I am sure;\r\nbut, Tom, I feel quite certain you have not packed your things," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks added, in an admonitory tone. "Come along with me\r\nupstairs."\r\n\r\nAnd by this time Lucilla\'s curiosity was beginning again to get the\r\nupper hand. If she only could have escaped, it would have been\r\nimpossible for her cousin to have renewed the conversation; and luckily\r\nhe was to leave Carlingford the same evening; but then a man is always\r\nan inconsequent creature, and not to be calculated on. This time,\r\ninstead of obeying as usual, Tom--having, as Miss Marjoribanks\r\nafterwards described (but only in the strictest confidence), "worked\r\nhimself up to it"--set himself directly in her way, and seized upon both\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\n"Lucilla," cried the unlucky fellow, "is it possible that you really\r\nhave misunderstood me all this time? Do you mean to say that you don\'t\r\nknow? Oh, Lucilla, listen just five minutes. It isn\'t because I am your\r\ncousin. I wish to Heaven I was not your cousin, but some one you had\r\nnever seen before. I mean I want you to consent to--to--to--marry me,\r\nLucilla. That is what I mean. I am called to the bar, and I can work for\r\nyou, and make a reputation. Lucilla, listen to what I have to say."\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks left her hands in his with a calmness which froze poor\r\nTom\'s heart in his breast. She did not even take the trouble to draw\r\nthem away. "Have you gone out of your senses, Tom?" she asked, in her\r\nsensible way; and she lifted her eyes to the face of the poor young\r\nfellow who was in love, with an inquiring look, as if she felt a little\r\nanxious about him. "If you have any feeling as if fever was coming on,"\r\nsaid Lucilla, "I think you should go upstairs and lie down a little till\r\npapa comes in. I heard there had been some cases down about the canal. I\r\nhope it is not the assizes that have been too much for you." When Miss\r\nMarjoribanks said this, she herself took fast hold of Tom\'s hands with a\r\nmotherly grasp to feel if they were hot, and looked into his eyes with a\r\ncertain serious inspection, which, under the circumstances, poor fellow!\r\nwas enough to drive him out of the little rationality he had left.\r\n\r\nTom was so far carried away by his frenzy, that he gave her a little\r\nshake in his impatience. "You are trying to drive me mad, Lucilla!"\r\ncried the young man. "I have got no fever. It is only you who are\r\ndriving me out of my senses. This time you must hear me. I will not let\r\nyou go till you have given me an answer. I am called to the bar, and I\r\nhave begun my Career," said Tom, making a pause for breath. "I knew you\r\nwould have laughed at me when I was depending on my mother; but now all\r\nthat is over, Lucilla. I have loved you as long as I can remember; and I\r\nalways thought--that you--cared for me a little. If you will have me,\r\nthere is nothing I could not do," said Tom, who thoroughly believed what\r\nhe was saying; "and if you will not have me, I will not answer for the\r\nconsequences. If I go off to India, or if I go to the bad----"\r\n\r\n"Tom," said Lucilla solemnly, and this time she drew away her hands, "if\r\nyou ever want to get married, I think the very best thing you can do is\r\nto go to India. As for marrying just now at your age, you know you might\r\nas well jump into the sea. You need not be vexed," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, in her motherly way. "I would not speak so if I was not\r\nyour best friend. As for marrying me, you know it is ridiculous. I have\r\nnot the least intention of marrying anybody. If I had thought of that, I\r\nneed never have come home at all. As for your going to the bad, I am not\r\nafraid of that. If I were to let you carry on with such a ridiculous\r\nidea, I should never forgive myself. It would be just as sensible to go\r\ninto a lunatic asylum at once. It is very lucky for you that you said\r\nthis to _me_," Lucilla went on, "and not to one of the girls that think\r\nit great fun to be married. And if I were you, Tom, I would go and pack\r\nmy things. You know you are always too late; and don\'t jump on your\r\nportmanteau and make such a dreadful noise if it won\'t shut, but ring\r\nthe bell for Thomas. You know we are to dine at half-past five to-day,\r\nto give you time for the train."\r\n\r\nThese were the last words Tom Marjoribanks heard as Lucilla left the\r\nroom. She ran up to the drawing-room without losing a minute, and burst\r\nin upon the vacant place where Mr Holden had stood so long waiting for\r\nher. To be sure, Miss Marjoribanks\'s forebodings were so far fulfilled\r\nthat the St Cecilia, which she meant to have over the piano, was hung\r\nquite in the other corner of the room, by reason of being just the same\r\nsize as another picture at the opposite angle, which the workmen,\r\nsternly symmetrical, thought it necessary to "match." But, after all,\r\nthat was a trifling defect. She stood in the middle of the room, and\r\nsurveyed the walls, well pleased, with a heart which kept beating very\r\nsteadily in her bosom. On the whole, perhaps, she was not sorry to have\r\nhad it out with Tom. So far as he was personally concerned, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, being a physician\'s daughter, had great faith in the _vis\r\nmedicatrix_, and was not afraid for her cousin\'s health or his morals,\r\nas a less experienced woman might have been. If she was angry with\r\nanybody, it was with herself, who had not taken sufficient precautions\r\nto avoid the explanation. "But, after all, everything is for the best,"\r\nLucilla said to herself, with that beautiful confidence which is common\r\nto people who have things their own way; and she devoted her mind to the\r\nSt Cecilia, and paid no more attention to Tom. It was not till more than\r\nan hour after that a succession of dreadful thumps was not only heard\r\nbut felt throughout the house. It was Tom, but he was not doing any harm\r\nto himself. He was not blowing out his brains or knocking his head\r\nagainst the wall. He was only jumping on his portmanteau,\r\nnotwithstanding that Lucilla had warned him against such a\r\nproceeding--and in his state of mind the jumps were naturally more\r\nfrantic than usual. When Lucilla heard it, she rang the bell, and told\r\nThomas to go and help Mr Tom with his packing; from which it will be\r\nseen that Miss Marjoribanks bore no grudge against her cousin but was\r\ndisposed to send him forth in friendship and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter X_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly six weeks after this before all Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\narrangements were completed, and she was able with satisfaction to\r\nherself to begin her campaign. It was just before Christmas, at the time\r\nabove all others when society has need of a ruling spirit. For example,\r\nMrs Chiley expected the Colonel\'s niece, Mary Chiley, who had been\r\nmarried about six months before, and who was not fond of her husband\'s\r\nfriends, and at the same time had no home of her own to go to, being an\r\norphan. The Colonel had invited the young couple by way of doing a kind\r\nthing, but he grumbled a little at the necessity, and had never liked\r\nthe fellow, he said--and then what were two old people to do to amuse\r\nthem? Then Mrs Centum had her two eldest boys home from school, and was\r\ndriven out of her senses by the noise and the racket, as she confided to\r\nher visitors. "It is all very well to make pretty pictures about\r\nChristmas," said the exasperated mother, "but I should like to know how\r\none can enjoy anything with such a commotion going on. I get up every\r\nmorning with a headache, I assure you; and then Mr Centum expects me to\r\nbe cheerful when he comes in to dinner; men are so unreasonable. I\r\nshould like to know what _they_ would do if they had what we have to go\r\nthrough: to look after all the servants--and they are always out of\r\ntheir senses at Christmas--and to see that the children don\'t have too\r\nmuch pudding, and to support all the noise. The holidays are the hardest\r\nwork a poor woman can have," she concluded, with a sigh; and when it is\r\ntaken into consideration that this particular Christmas was a wet\r\nChristmas, without any frost or possibility of amusement out of doors,\r\nEnglish matrons in general will not refuse their sympathy to Mrs Centum.\r\nMrs Woodburn perhaps was equally to be pitied in a different way. She\r\nhad to receive several members of her husband\'s family, who were, like\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, without any sense of humour, and who stared, and did\r\nnot in the least understand her when she "took off" any of her\r\nneighbours; not to say that some of them were Low-Church, and thought\r\nthe practice sinful. Under these circumstances it will be readily\r\nbelieved that the commencement of Lucilla\'s operations was looked upon\r\nwith great interest in Carlingford. It was so opportune that society\r\nforgot its usual instincts of criticism, and forgave Miss Marjoribanks\r\nfor being more enlightened and enterprising than her neighbours; and\r\nthen most people were very anxious to see the drawing-room, now it had\r\nbeen restored.\r\n\r\nThis was a privilege, however, not accorded to the crowd. Mrs Chiley had\r\nseen it under a vow of secrecy, and Mr Cavendish owned to having made a\r\nrun upstairs one evening after one of Dr Marjoribanks\'s little dinners,\r\nwhen the other _convives_ were in the library, where Lucilla had erected\r\nher temporary throne. But this clandestine inspection met with the\r\nfailure it deserved, for there was no light in the room except the\r\nmoonlight, which made three white blotches on the carpet where the\r\nwindows were, burying everything else in the profoundest darkness; and\r\nthe spy knocked his foot against something which reduced him to sudden\r\nand well-merited agony. As for Mrs Chiley, she was discretion itself,\r\nand would say nothing even to her niece. "I mean to work her a footstool\r\nin water-lilies, my dear, like the one I did for you when you were\r\nmarried," the old lady said; and that was the only light she would throw\r\non the subject. "My opinion is that it must be in crimson," Mrs Woodburn\r\nsaid, when she heard this, "for I know your aunt\'s water-lilies. When I\r\nsee them growing, I always think of you. It would be quite like Lucilla\r\nMarjoribanks to have it in crimson--for it is a cheerful colour, you\r\nknow, and quite different from the old furniture; and that would always\r\nbe a comfort to her dear papa." From this it will be seen that the\r\ncuriosity of Carlingford was excited to a lively extent. Many people\r\neven went so far as to give the Browns a sitting in their glass-house,\r\nwith the hope of having a peep at the colour of the hangings at least.\r\nBut Miss Marjoribanks was too sensible a woman to leave her virgin\r\ndrawing-room exposed to the sun when there was any, and to the\r\nphotographers, who were perhaps more dangerous. "I think it is blue, for\r\nmy part," said Miss Brown, who had got into the habit of rising early in\r\nhopes of finding the Doctor\'s household off its guard. "Lucilla was\r\nalways a great one for blue; she thinks it is becoming to her\r\ncomplexion;" which, indeed, as the readers of this history are aware,\r\nwas a matter of fact. As for Miss Marjoribanks, she did her best to\r\nkeep up this agreeable mystery. "For my part, I am fond of neutral\r\ntints," she herself said, when she was questioned on the subject;\r\n"anybody who knows me can easily guess my taste. I should have been born\r\na Quaker, you know, I do so like the drabs and grays, and all those soft\r\ncolours. You can have as much red and green as you like abroad, where\r\nthe sun is strong, but here it would be bad style," said Lucilla; from\r\nwhich the most simple-minded of her auditors drew the natural\r\nconclusion. Thus all the world contemplated with excitement the first\r\nThursday which was to open this enchanted chamber to their admiring\r\neyes. "Don\'t expect any regular invitation," Miss Marjoribanks said. "I\r\nhope you will all come, or as many of you as can. Papa has always some\r\nmen to dinner with him that day, you know, and it is so dreadfully slow\r\nfor me with a heap of men. That is why I fixed on Thursday. I want you\r\nto come every week, so it would be absurd to send an invitation; and\r\nremember it is not a party, only an Evening," said Lucilla. "I shall\r\nwear a white frock high, as I always do. Now be sure you come."\r\n\r\n"But we can\'t all go in high white frocks," said Mrs Chiley\'s niece,\r\nMary, who, if her trousseau had been subtracted from the joys of\r\nmarriage, would not, poor soul! have found very much left. This\r\nintimation dismayed the bride a little; for, to be sure, she had decided\r\nwhich dress she was to wear before Lucilla spoke.\r\n\r\n"But, my dear, you are married," said Miss Marjoribanks; "that makes it\r\nquite different: come in that pretty pink that is so becoming. I don\'t\r\nwant to have any dowdies, for my part; and don\'t forget that I shall\r\nexpect you all at nine o\'clock."\r\n\r\nWhen she had said this, Miss Marjoribanks proceeded on her way, sowing\r\ninvitations and gratification round her. She asked the youngest Miss\r\nBrown to bring her music, in recognition of her ancient claims as the\r\nsongstress of society in Carlingford; for Lucilla had all that regard\r\nfor constituted rights which is so necessary to a revolutionary of the\r\nhighest class. She had no desire to shock anybody\'s prejudices or wound\r\nanybody\'s feelings. "And she has a nice little voice," Lucilla said to\r\nherself, with the most friendly and tolerant feelings. Thus Miss\r\nMarjoribanks prepared to establish her kingdom with a benevolence which\r\nwas almost Utopian, not upon the ruins of other thrones, but with the\r\ngoodwill and co-operation of the lesser powers, who were, to be sure,\r\ntoo feeble to resist her advance, but whose rights she was quite ready\r\nto recognise, and even to promote, in her own way.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is necessary here to indicate a certain vague and\r\nnot disagreeable danger, which appeared to some experienced persons to\r\nshadow Lucilla\'s conquering way. Mr Cavendish, who was a young man of\r\nrefinement, not to say that he had a very nice property, had begun to\r\npay attention to Miss Marjoribanks in what Mrs Chiley thought quite a\r\nmarked manner. To be sure, he could not pretend to the honour of taking\r\nher in to dinner, which was not his place, being a young man; but he did\r\nwhat was next best, and manoeuvred to get the place on her left hand,\r\nwhich, in a party composed chiefly of men, was not difficult to manage.\r\nFor, to tell the truth, most of the gentlemen present were at that\r\nspecial moment more interested in the dinner than in Lucilla. And after\r\ndinner it was Mr Cavendish who was the first to leave the room; and to\r\nhear the two talking about all the places they had been to, and all the\r\npeople they had met, was as good as a play, Mrs Chiley said. Mr\r\nCavendish confided to Lucilla his opinions upon things in general, and\r\naccepted the reproofs which she administered (for Miss Marjoribanks was\r\nquite unquestionable in her orthodoxy, and thought it a duty, as she\r\nsaid, always to speak with respect of religion) when his sentiments were\r\ntoo speculative, and said, "How charming is divine philosophy!" so as,\r\nfor the moment, to dazzle Lucilla herself, who thought it a very pretty\r\ncompliment. He came to her assistance when she made tea, and generally\r\nfulfilled all the duties which are expected of a man who is paying\r\nattention to a young lady. Old Mrs Chiley watched the nascent regard\r\nwith her kind old grandmotherly eyes. She calculated over in her own\r\nmind the details of his possessions, so far as the public was aware of\r\nthem, and found them on the whole satisfactory. He had a nice property,\r\nand then he was a very nice, indeed an unexceptionable young man; and to\r\nadd to this, it had been agreed to between Colonel Chiley and Mr Centum,\r\nand several other of the leading people in Carlingford, that he was the\r\nmost likely man to represent the borough when old Mr Chiltern, who was\r\nalways threatening to retire, fulfilled his promise. Mr Cavendish had a\r\nvery handsome house a little out of town, where a lady would be next\r\nthing to a county lady--indeed, quite a county lady, if her husband was\r\nthe Member for Carlingford.\r\n\r\nAll these thoughts passed through Mrs Chiley\'s mind, and, as was\r\nnatural, in the precious moments after dinner, were suggested in\r\noccasional words of meaning to the understanding ear of Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. "My dear Lucilla, it is just the position that would suit\r\nyou--with your talents!" the old lady said; and Lucilla did not say No.\r\nTo be sure, she had not at the present moment the least inclination to\r\nget married, as she truly said; it would, indeed, to tell the truth,\r\ndisturb her plans considerably; but still, if such was the intention of\r\nProvidence, and if it was to the Member for Carlingford, Lucilla felt\r\nthat it was still credible that everything might be for the best.\r\n\r\n"But it is a great deal too soon to think of anything of that sort,"\r\nMiss Marjoribanks would reply. "If I had thought of that, I need never\r\nhave come home at all; and especially when papa has been so good about\r\neverything." Yet for all that she was not ungracious to Mr Cavendish\r\nwhen he came in first as usual. To marry a man in his position would\r\nnot, after all, be deranging her plans to any serious extent. Indeed, it\r\nwould, if his hopes were realised, constitute Lucilla a kind of queen in\r\nCarlingford, and she could not but feel that, under these circumstances,\r\nit might be a kind of duty to reconsider her resolution. And thus the\r\ntime passed while the drawing-room was undergoing renovation. Mr\r\nCavendish had been much tantalised, she said, by the absence of the\r\npiano, which prevented them from having any music, and Lucilla had even\r\nbeen tempted into a few snatches of song, which, to tell the truth, some\r\nof the gentlemen present, especially the Doctor himself and Colonel\r\nChiley, being old-fashioned, preferred without the accompaniment. And\r\nthus it was, under the most brilliant auspices, and with the full\r\nconfidence of all her future constituency, that Miss Marjoribanks\r\nsuperintended the arrangement of the drawing-room on that momentous\r\nThursday, which was to be the real beginning of her great work in\r\nCarlingford.\r\n\r\n"My dear, you must leave yourself entirely in my hands," Lucilla said to\r\nBarbara Lake on the morning of that eventful day. "Don\'t get impatient.\r\nI dare say you don\'t know many people, and it may be a little slow for\r\nyou at first; but everybody has to put up with that, you know, for a\r\nbeginning. And, by the bye, what are you going to wear?"\r\n\r\n"I have not thought about it," said Barbara, who had the painful pride\r\nof poverty, aggravated much by a sense that the comforts of other people\r\nwere an injury to her. Poor soul! she had been thinking of little else\r\nfor at least a week past; and then she had not very much choice in her\r\nwardrobe; but her disposition was one which rejected sympathy, and she\r\nthought it would look best to pretend to be indifferent. At the same\r\ntime, she said this with a dull colour on her cheeks, the colour of\r\nirritation; and she could not help asking herself why Lucilla, who was\r\nnot so handsome as she was, had the power to array herself in gorgeous\r\napparel, while she, Barbara, had nothing but a white frock. There are\r\ndifferences even in white frocks, though the masculine mind may be\r\nunaware of them. Barbara\'s muslin had been washed six times, and had a\r\nvery different air from the vestal robes of her patroness. To be sure,\r\nLucilla was not taken in, in the least, by her companion\'s look of\r\nindifference, and would even have been delighted to bestow a pretty\r\ndress upon Barbara, if that had been a possible thing to do.\r\n\r\n"There will be no dress," said Miss Marjoribanks, with solemnity. "I\r\nhave insisted upon that. You know it is not a party, it is only an\r\nEvening. A white frock, _high_--that is all I mean to wear; and mind you\r\ndon\'t lose patience. I shall keep my eye on you; and after the first, I\r\nfeel sure you will enjoy yourself. Good-bye for the present." When she\r\nhad uttered these encouraging words. Miss Marjoribanks went away to\r\npursue her preparations, and Barbara proceeded to get out her dress and\r\nexamine it. It was as important to her as all the complicated\r\nparaphernalia of the evening\'s arrangements were to Lucilla. It is true\r\nthat there were greater interests involved in the case of the leader;\r\nbut then Barbara was the soldier of fortune who had to open the oyster\r\nwith her sword, and she was feeling the point of it metaphorically while\r\nshe pulled out the breadths of her white dress, and tried to think that\r\nthey would not look limp at night; and what her sentiments lost in\r\nbreadth, as compared with Lucilla\'s, they gained in intensity, for--for\r\nanything she could tell--her life might change colour by means of this\r\nThursday Evening; and such, indeed, was her hope. Barbara prepared for\r\nher first appearance in Grange Lane, with a mind wound up to any degree\r\nof daring. It did not occur to her that she required to keep faith with\r\nMiss Marjoribanks in anything except the duet. As regarded other\r\nmatters, Barbara was quite unscrupulous, for at the bottom she could not\r\nbut feel that any one who was kind to her was taking an unwarrantable\r\nliberty. What right had Lucilla Marjoribanks to be kind to her? as if\r\nshe was not as good as Lucilla any day! and though it might be worth her\r\nwhile to take advantage of it for the moment, it was still an insult, in\r\nits way, to be avenged if an opportunity ever should arise.\r\n\r\nThe evening came, as evenings do come, quite indifferently whether\r\npeople are glad or sorry; and it was with a calmness which the other\r\nladies regarded as next to miraculous, that Miss Marjoribanks took\r\nColonel Chiley\'s arm to go to the dining-room. We say the other ladies,\r\nfor on this great occasion Mrs Centum and Mrs Woodburn were both among\r\nthe dinner-guests. "To see her eat her dinner as if she had nothing on\r\nher mind!" Mrs Centum said in amazement: "as for me, though nobody can\r\nblame me if anything goes wrong, I could enjoy nothing for thinking of\r\nit. And I must say I was disappointed with the dinner," she added, with\r\na certain air of satisfaction, in Mrs Woodburn\'s ear. It was when they\r\nwere going upstairs, and Lucilla was behind with Mrs Chiley. "The fuss\r\nthe men have always made about these dinners! and except for a few made\r\ndishes that were really nothing, you know, I can\'t say _I_ saw anything\r\nparticular in it. And as for Lucilla, I can\'t think she has any\r\nfeeling," said the banker\'s wife.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, it is because you don\'t understand," said Mrs Woodburn.\r\n"She is kept up, you know, by a sense of duty. It is all because she has\r\nset her heart on being a comfort to her dear papa!"\r\n\r\nSuch, it is true, were the comments that were made upon the\r\npublic-spirited young woman who was doing so much for Carlingford; but\r\nthen Lucilla only shared the fate of all the great benefactors of the\r\nworld. An hour later the glories of the furniture were veiled and hidden\r\nby the robes of a radiant flood of society, embracing all that was most\r\nfair and all that was most distinguished in Carlingford. No doubt there\r\nwas a world of heterogeneous elements; but then if there had not been\r\ndifficulties where would have been the use of Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\ngenius? Mr Bury and his sister, who had been unconsciously mollified by\r\nthe admirable dinner provided for them downstairs, found some stray\r\nlambs in the assembly who were in need of them, and thus had the double\r\nsatisfaction of combining pleasure with duty; and though there were\r\nseveral people in the room whose lives were a burden to them in\r\nconsequence of Mrs Woodburn\'s remarkable gift, even they found it\r\nimpossible not to be amused by an occasional representation of an\r\nabsent individual, or by the dashing sketch of Lucilla, which she gave\r\nat intervals in her corner, amid the smothered laughter of the audience,\r\nwho were half ashamed of themselves. "She is never ill-tempered, you\r\nknow," the persons who felt themselves threatened in their turn said to\r\neach other with a certain piteous resignation; and oddly enough it was\r\nin general the most insignificant people about who were afraid of Mrs\r\nWoodburn. It is needless to say that such a dread never entered the\r\nserene intelligence of Miss Marjoribanks, who believed in herself with a\r\nreasonable and steady faith. As for old Mrs Chiley, who had so many\r\nfunny little ways, and whom the mimic executed to perfection, she also\r\nwas quite calm on the subject. "You know there is nothing to take off in\r\nme," the old lady would say; "I always was a simple body: and then I am\r\nold enough to be all your grandmothers, my dear;" which was a saying\r\ncalculated, as Miss Marjoribanks justly observed, to melt a heart of\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nThen the Miss Browns had brought their photographs, in which most people\r\nin Grange Lane were caricatured hideously, but with such a charming\r\nequality that the most _exigeant_ forgave the wrong to himself in\r\nlaughing at his neighbours. Miss Brown had brought her music too, and\r\nsang her feeble little strain to the applause of her immediate\r\nneighbours, and to the delight of those who were at a distance, and who\r\ncould talk louder and flirt more openly under cover of the music; and\r\nthere were other young ladies who had also come prepared with a little\r\nroll of songs or "pieces." Lucilla, with her finger as it were upon the\r\npulse of the company, let them all exhibit their powers with that\r\nenlightened impartiality which we have already remarked in her. When Mr\r\nCavendish came to her in his ingratiating way, and asked her how she\r\ncould possibly let all the sparrows chirp like that when the nightingale\r\nwas present, Miss Marjoribanks proved herself proof to the flattery. She\r\nsaid, "Do go away, like a good man, and make yourself agreeable. There\r\nare so few men, you know, who can flirt in Carlingford. I have always\r\nreckoned upon you as such a valuable assistant. It is always an\r\nadvantage to have a man who flirts," said Miss Marjoribanks. This was a\r\nsentiment perhaps too large and enlightened, in the truest sense of the\r\nword, to meet, as it ought to have done, with the applause of her\r\naudience. Most of the persons immediately surrounding her thought,\r\nindeed, that it was a mere _bon-mot_ to which Lucilla had given\r\nutterance, and laughed accordingly; but it is needless to explain that\r\nthese were persons quite unable to understand her genius.\r\n\r\nAll this time she was keeping her eyes upon a figure in the corner of a\r\nsofa, which looked as if it was glued there, and kept staring defiance\r\nat the world in general from under black and level brows. Lucilla, it is\r\ntrue, had introduced Barbara Lake in the most flattering way to Mrs\r\nChiley, and to some of the young ladies present; but then she was a\r\nstranger, and an intruder into those regions of the blest, and she could\r\nnot help feeling so. If her present companions had not whispered among\r\nthemselves, "Miss Lake! what Miss Lake? Good gracious! Lake the\r\ndrawing-master\'s daughter!" she herself would still have reminded\r\nherself of her humble paternity. Barbara sat as if she could not move\r\nfrom that corner, looking out upon everybody with scared eyes, which\r\nexpressed nothing but defiance, and in her own mind making the\r\nreflections of bitter poverty upon the airy pretty figures round her, in\r\nall the variations of that costume which Miss Marjoribanks had announced\r\nas the standard of dress for the evening. Barbara\'s muslin, six times\r\nwashed, was not more different from the spotless lightness of all the\r\ndraperies round her, than was her air of fright, and at the same time of\r\ndefiance, from the gay babble and pleasant looks of the group which, by\r\na chance combination, she seemed to form part of. She began to say to\r\nherself that she had much better go away, and that there never could be\r\nanything in common between those frivolous creatures and herself, a poor\r\nman\'s daughter; and she began to get dreadfully exasperated with\r\nLucilla, who had beguiled her into this scene, to make game of her, as\r\npoor Barbara said; though, so far from making game of her, nobody took\r\nmuch notice, after the first unsuccessful attempt at conversation, of\r\nthe unfortunate young woman. It was when she was in this unhappy humour\r\nthat her eye fell upon Mr Cavendish, who was in the act of making the\r\nappeal to Lucilla which we have already recorded. Barbara had never as\r\nyet had a lover, but she had read an unlimited number of novels, which\r\ncame to nearly the same thing, and she saw at a glance that this was\r\nsomebody who resembled the indispensable hero. She looked at him with a\r\ncertain fierce interest, and remembered at that instant how often in\r\nbooks it is the humble heroine, behind backs, whom all the young ladies\r\nsnub, who wins the hero at the last. And then Miss Marjoribanks, though\r\nshe sent him away, smiled benignantly upon him. The colour flushed to\r\nBarbara\'s cheeks, and her eyes, which had grown dull and fixed between\r\nfright and spite, took sudden expression under her straight brows. An\r\nintention, which was not so much an intention as an instinct, suddenly\r\nsprang into life within her, and, without knowing, she drew a long\r\nbreath of eagerness and impotence. He was standing quite near by this\r\ntime, doing his duty according to Miss Marjoribanks\'s orders, and\r\nflirting with all his might; and Barbara looked at him as a hungry\r\nschoolboy might be supposed to look at a tempting apple just out of his\r\nreach. How was she to get at this suitor of Lucilla\'s? It would have\r\ngiven her so pure a delight to tear down the golden apple, and tread on\r\nit, and trample it to nothing; and then it came into her head that it\r\nmight be good to eat as well.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Miss Marjoribanks, who was in six places at\r\nonce, suddenly touched Barbara\'s shoulder. "Come with me a minute; I\r\nwant to show you something," she said loud out. Barbara, on her side,\r\nlooked round with a crimson countenance, feeling that her secret\r\nthoughts must be written in her guilty eyes. But then these were eyes\r\nwhich could be utterly destitute of expression when they pleased, though\r\ntheir owner, at present just at the beginning of her experience, was not\r\nquite aware of the fact. She stumbled to her feet with the awkward\r\nmotion natural to that form of shyness which her temper and her\r\ntemperament united to produce in her. She did all but put her foot\r\nthrough Miss Brown\'s delicate skirt, and she had neither the natural\r\ndisposition nor the acquired grace which can carry off one of those\r\ntrifling offences against society. Nevertheless, as she stood beside\r\nLucilla at the piano, the company in general owned a little thrill of\r\ncuriosity. Who was she? A girl with splendid black hair, with brows as\r\nlevel as if they had been made with a line, with intense eyes which\r\nlooked a little oblique under that straight bar of shadow. Her dress was\r\nlimp, but she was not such a figure as could be passed over even at an\r\nevening party; and then her face was a little flushed, and her eyes lit\r\nup with excitement. She seemed to survey everybody with that defiant\r\nlook which was chiefly awkwardness and temper, but which looked like\r\npride when she was standing up at her full height, and in a conspicuous\r\nposition, where everybody could see her. Most people concluded she was\r\nan Italian whom Lucilla had picked up somewhere in her travels. As for\r\nMr Cavendish, he stopped short altogether in the occupation which Miss\r\nMarjoribanks had allotted to him, and drew close to the piano. He\r\nthought he had seen the face somewhere under a shabby bonnet in some\r\nby-street of Carlingford, and he was even sufficiently learned in female\r\napparel to observe the limpness of her dress.\r\n\r\nThis preface of curiosity had all been foreseen by Miss Marjoribanks,\r\nand she paused a moment, under pretence of selecting her music, to take\r\nthe full advantage of it: for Lucilla, like most persons of elevated\r\naims, was content to sacrifice herself to the success of her work; and\r\nthen all at once, before the Carlingford people knew what they were\r\ndoing, the two voices rose, bursting upon the astonished community like\r\na sudden revelation. For it must be remembered that nobody in\r\nCarlingford, except the members of Dr Marjoribanks\'s dinner-party, had\r\never heard Lucilla sing, much less her companion; and the account which\r\nthese gentlemen had carried home to their wives had been generally\r\npooh-poohed and put down. "Mr Centum never listens to a note if he can\r\nhelp it," said the banker\'s wife, "and how could he know whether she had\r\na nice voice or not?" which, indeed, was a powerful argument. But this\r\nevening there could be no mistake about it. The words were arrested on\r\nthe very lips of the talkers; Mrs Woodburn paused in the midst of doing\r\nLucilla, and, as we have before said, Mr Cavendish broke a flirtation\r\nclean off at its most interesting moment. It is impossible to record\r\nwhat they sang, for those events, as everybody is aware, happened a good\r\nmany years ago, and the chances are that the present generation has\r\naltogether forgotten the duet which made so extraordinary an impression\r\non the inhabitants of Grange Lane. The applause with which the\r\nperformance was received reached the length of a perfect ovation.\r\nBarbara, for her part, who was not conscious of having ever been\r\napplauded before, flushed into splendid crimson, and shone out from\r\nunder her straight eyebrows, intoxicated into absolute beauty. As for\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, she took it more calmly. Lucilla had the advantage of\r\nknowing what she could do, and accordingly she was not surprised when\r\npeople found it remarkable. She consented, on urgent persuasion, to\r\nrepeat the last verse of the duet, but when that was over, was smilingly\r\nobdurate. "Almost everybody can sing," said Miss Marjoribanks, with a\r\nmagnificent depreciation of her own gift. "Perhaps Miss Brown will sing\r\nus something; but as for me, you know, I am the mistress of the house."\r\n\r\nLucilla went away as she spoke to attend to her guests, but she left\r\nBarbara still crimson and splendid, triumphing over her limp dress and\r\nall her disadvantages, by the piano. Fortunately, for that evening\r\nBarbara\'s pride and her shyness prevented her from yielding to the\r\nrepeated demands addressed to her by the admiring audience. She said to\r\nMr Cavendish, with a disloyalty which that gentleman thought piquant,\r\nthat "Miss Marjoribanks would not be pleased"; and the future Member for\r\nCarlingford thought he could not do better than obey the injunctions of\r\nthe mistress of the feast by a little flirtation with the gifted\r\nunknown. To be sure, Barbara was not gifted in talk, and she was still\r\ndefiant and contradictory; but then her eyes were blazing with\r\nexcitement under her level eyebrows, and she was as willing to be\r\nflirted with as if she had known a great deal better. And then Mr\r\nCavendish had a weakness for a contralto. While this little by-play was\r\ngoing on, Lucilla was moving about, the centre of a perfect tumult of\r\napplause. No more complete success could be imagined than that of this\r\nfirst Thursday Evening, which was remarkable in the records of\r\nCarlingford; and yet perhaps Miss Marjoribanks, like other conquerors,\r\nwas destined to build her victory upon sacrifice. She did not feel any\r\nalarm at the present moment; but even if she had, that would have made\r\nno difference to Lucilla\'s proceedings. She was not the woman to shrink\r\nfrom a sacrifice when it was for the promotion of the great object of\r\nher life; and that, as everybody knew who knew Miss Marjoribanks, was to\r\nbe a comfort to her dear papa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XI_\r\n\r\n\r\n"You have never told us who your unknown was," said Mr Cavendish. "I\r\nsuppose she is professional. Carlingford could not possibly possess two\r\nsuch voices in private life."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know about two such voices," said Miss Marjoribanks; "her\r\nvoice suits mine, you know. It is always a great thing to find two\r\nvoices that suit. I never would choose to have professional singers, for\r\nmy part. You have to give yourself up to music when you do such a thing;\r\nand that is not my idea of society. I am very fond of music," said\r\nLucilla--"excessively fond of it; but then everybody is not of my\r\nopinion--and one has to take so many things into consideration. For\r\npeople who give one party in the year it does very well--but then I hate\r\nparties: the only pleasure in society is when one\'s friends come to see\r\none without any ado."\r\n\r\n"In white frocks, _high_," said Mrs Woodburn, who could not help\r\nassuming Lucilla\'s manner for the moment, even while addressing herself;\r\nbut as the possibility of such a _l\xe8se-majest\xe9_ did not even occur to\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, she accepted the observation in good faith.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I hate a grand toilette when it is only a meeting of friends," she\r\nsaid--"for the girls, you know; of course you married ladies can always\r\ndo what you like. You have your husbands to please," said Lucilla. And\r\nthis was a little hard upon her satirist, for, to tell the truth, that\r\nwas a particular of domestic duty to which Mrs Woodburn did not much\r\ndevote herself, according to the opinion of Grange Lane.\r\n\r\n"But about the contralto," said Mr Cavendish, who had come to call on\r\nMiss Marjoribanks under his sister\'s wing, and desired above all things\r\nto keep the peace between the two ladies, as indeed is a man\'s duty\r\nunder such circumstances. "You are always statesmanlike in your views;\r\nbut I cannot understand why you let poor little Molly Brown carry on her\r\nchirping when you had such an astonishing force in reserve. She must\r\nhave been covered with confusion, the poor little soul."\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the sort," said Mrs Woodburn, pursuing her favourite\r\noccupation as usual. "She only said, \'Goodness me! how high Lucilla\r\ngoes! Do you like that dreadfully high music?\' and made little\r\neyebrows." To be sure, the mimic made Miss Brown\'s eyebrows, and spoke\r\nin her voice, so that even Lucilla found it a little difficult to keep\r\nher gravity. But then Miss Marjoribanks was defended by her mission, and\r\nshe felt in her heart that, representing public interest as she did, it\r\nwas her duty to avoid all complicity in any attack upon an individual;\r\nand consequently, to a certain extent, it was her duty also to put Mrs\r\nWoodburn down.\r\n\r\n"Molly Brown has a very nice little voice," said Lucilla, with most\r\ndisheartening gravity. "I like to hear her sing, for my part--the only\r\nthing is that she wants cultivation a little. It doesn\'t matter much you\r\nknow, whether or not you have a voice to begin with. It is cultivation\r\nthat is the thing," said Miss Marjoribanks deliberately. "I hope you\r\n_really_ thought it was a pleasant evening. Of course everybody said so\r\nto me; but then one can never put any faith in that. I have said it\r\nmyself ever so many times when I am sure I did not mean it. For myself,\r\nI don\'t give any importance to the first evening. Anybody can do a thing\r\nonce, you know; the second and the third, and so on--that is the real\r\ntest. But I hope you thought it pleasant so far as it went."\r\n\r\n"It was a great deal more than pleasant," said Mr Cavendish; "and as for\r\nyour conception of social politics, it is masterly," the future M.P.\r\nadded, in a tone which struck Lucilla as very significant; not that she\r\ncared particularly about Mr Cavendish\'s meaning, but still, when a young\r\nman who intends to go into Parliament congratulates a young lady upon\r\nher statesmanlike views, and her conception of politics, it must be\r\nconfessed that it looks a little particular; and then, if that was what\r\nhe meant, it was no doubt Lucilla\'s duty to make up her mind.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know, I went through a course of political economy at Mount\r\nPleasant," she said, with a laugh. "One of the Miss Blounts was\r\ndreadfully strong-minded. I wonder, for my part, that she did not make\r\nme literary; but fortunately I escaped that."\r\n\r\n"Heaven be praised!" said Mr Cavendish. "I think you ought to be Prime\r\nMinister. That contralto of yours is charming raw material; but if I\r\nwere you I would put her through an elementary course. She knows how to\r\nsing, but she does not know how to move; and as for talking, she seems\r\nto expect to be insulted. If you make a pretty-behaved young lady out of\r\nthat, you will beat Adam Smith."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know much about Adam Smith," said Miss Marjoribanks. "I\r\nthink Miss Martha thought him rather old-fashioned. As for poor Barbara,\r\nshe is only a little shy, but that will soon wear off. I don\'t see what\r\nneed she has to talk--or to move either, for that matter. I thought she\r\ndid very well indeed for a girl who never goes into society. Was it not\r\nclever of me to find her out the very first day I was in Carlingford? It\r\nhas always been so difficult to find a voice that went perfectly with\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"For my part, I think it was a great deal more than clever," said Mr\r\nCavendish; for Mrs Woodburn, finding herself unappreciated, was silent\r\nand making notes. "It was a stroke of genius. So her name is Barbara? I\r\nwonder if it would be indiscreet to ask where Mademoiselle Barbara comes\r\nfrom, or if she belongs to anybody, or lives anywhere. My own impression\r\nis that you mean to keep her shut up in a box all the week through, and\r\nproduce her only on the Thursday evenings. I have a weakness for a fine\r\ncontralto. If she had been existing in an ordinary habitation like other\r\npeople in Carlingford, I should have heard her, or heard of her. It is\r\nclear to me that you keep her shut up in a box."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said Lucilla. "I don\'t mean to tell you anything about her.\r\nYou may be sure, now I have found her out, I mean to keep her for\r\nmyself. Her box is quite a pretty one, like what Gulliver had somewhere.\r\nIt is just time for lunch, and you are both going to stay, I hope; and\r\nthere is poor Mary Chiley and her husband coming through the garden.\r\nWhat a pity it is he is such a goose!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but you know she never would take her uncle\'s advice, my dear,"\r\nsaid the incorrigible mimic, putting on Mrs Chiley\'s face; "and being an\r\norphan, what could anybody do? And then she does not get on with _his_\r\nfamily. By the way," Mrs Woodburn said, falling into her natural\r\ntone--"I wonder if anybody ever does get on with her husband\'s family?"\r\nThe question was one which was a little grave to herself at the moment;\r\nand this was the reason why she returned to her identity--for there was\r\nno telling how long the Woodburns, who had come for Christmas, meant to\r\nstay. "I shall be quite interested to watch _you_, Lucilla, when it\r\ncomes to be your turn, and see how you manage," she went on, with a keen\r\nlook at Miss Marjoribanks; and Mr Cavendish laughed. He too looked at\r\nher, and Lucilla felt herself in rather a delicate position: not that\r\nshe was agitated, as might have been the case had the future M.P. for\r\nCarlingford "engaged her affections," as she herself would have said.\r\nFortunately these young affections were quite free as yet; but\r\nnevertheless Miss Marjoribanks felt that the question was a serious one,\r\nas coming from the sister of a gentleman who was undeniably paying her\r\nattention. She did not in the least wish to alarm a leading member of a\r\nfamily into which it was possible she might enter; and then at the same\r\ntime she intended to reserve fully all her individual rights.\r\n\r\n"I always make it a point never to shock anybody\'s prejudices," said\r\nMiss Marjoribanks. "I should do just the same with _them_ as with other\r\npeople; all you have to do is to show from the first that you mean to be\r\ngood friends with everybody. But then I am so lucky: I can _always_ get\r\non with people," said Lucilla, rising to greet the two unfortunates who\r\nhad come to Colonel Chiley\'s to spend a merry Christmas, and who did not\r\nknow what to do with themselves. And then they all went downstairs and\r\nlunched together very pleasantly. As for Mr Cavendish, he was "quite\r\ndevoted," as poor Mary Chiley said, with a touch of envy. To be sure,\r\nher trousseau was still in its full glory; but yet life under the\r\nconditions of marriage was not nearly such fun as it had been when she\r\nwas a young lady, and had some one paying attention to her: and she\r\nrather grudged Lucilla that climax of existence, notwithstanding her own\r\nsuperior standing and dignity as a married lady. And Mrs Woodburn too\r\nawoke from her study of the stupid young husband to remark upon her\r\nbrother\'s behaviour: she had not seen the two together so often as Mrs\r\nChiley had done, and consequently this was the first time that the\r\nthought had occurred to her. She too had been born "one of the\r\nCavendishes," as it was common to say in Carlingford, with a certain\r\nimposing yet vague grandeur--and she was a little shocked, like any good\r\nsister, at the first idea. She watched Lucilla\'s movements and looks\r\nwith a quite different kind of attention after this idea struck her, and\r\nmade a rapid private calculation as to who Dr Marjoribanks\'s connections\r\nwere, and what he would be likely to give his daughter; so that it is\r\nevident that Lucilla did not deceive herself, but that Mr Cavendish\'s\r\nattentions must have been marked indeed.\r\n\r\nThis was the little cloud which arose, as we have said, no bigger than a\r\nman\'s hand, over Miss Marjoribanks\'s prosperous way. When the luncheon\r\nwas over and they had all gone, Lucilla took a few minutes to think it\r\nover before she went out. It was not that she was unduly flattered by Mr\r\nCavendish\'s attentions, as might have happened to an inexperienced young\r\nwoman; for Lucilla, with her attractions and genius, had not reached the\r\nmature age of nineteen without receiving the natural homage of mankind\r\non several clearly-defined occasions. But then the present case had\r\nvarious features peculiar to itself, which prevented Lucilla from\r\ncrushing it in the bud, as she had meant to do with her cousin\'s\r\nill-fated passion. She had to consider, in the first place, her mission\r\nin Carlingford, which was more important than anything else; but though\r\nMiss Marjoribanks had vowed herself to the reorganisation of society in\r\nher native town, she had not by any means vowed that it was absolutely\r\nas Miss Marjoribanks that she was to accomplish that renovation. And\r\nthen there was something in the very idea of being M.P. for Carlingford\r\nwhich moved the mind of Lucilla. It was a perfectly ideal position for a\r\nwoman of her views, and seemed to offer the very field that was\r\nnecessary for her ambition. This was the reason, of all others, which\r\nmade her less careful to prevent Mr Cavendish from "saying the words"\r\nthan she had been with Tom. To be sure, it would be a trial to leave the\r\ndrawing-room after it had just been furnished so entirely to her\r\nliking--not to say to her complexion; but still it was a sacrifice which\r\nmight be made. It was in this way that Miss Marjoribanks prepared\r\nherself for the possible modifications which circumstances might impose.\r\nShe did not make any rash resolution to resist a change which, on the\r\nwhole, might possibly be "for the best," but prepared herself to take\r\neverything into consideration, and possibly to draw from it a superior\r\ngood: in short, she looked upon the matter as a superior mind, trained\r\nin sound principles of political economy, might be expected to look upon\r\nthe possible vicissitudes of fortune, with an enlightened regard to the\r\nuses of all things, and to the comparative values on either side.\r\n\r\nBarbara Lake, as it happened, was out walking at the very moment when\r\nMiss Marjoribanks sat down to consider this question. She had gone to\r\nthe School of Design to meet Rose, with an amiability very unusual in\r\nher. Rose had made such progress, after leaving Mount Pleasant, under\r\nher father\'s care, and by the help of that fine feeling for art which\r\nhas been mentioned in the earlier part of this history, that the charge\r\nof the female pupils in the School of Design had been confided to her,\r\nwith a tiny little salary, which served Mr Lake as an excuse for keeping\r\nhis favourite little daughter with him. Nothing could be supposed more\r\nunlike Barbara than her younger sister, who just came up to her\r\nshoulder, and was twice as serviceable and active and "nice," according\r\nto the testimony of all the children. Barbara had led her father a hard\r\nlife, poor man! the time that Rose was at Mount Pleasant; but now that\r\nhis assistant had come back again, the poor drawing-master had recovered\r\nall his old spirits. She was just coming out of the School of Design,\r\nwith her portfolio under her arm, when Barbara met her. There were not\r\nmany pupils, it is true, but still there were enough to worry poor Rose,\r\nwho was not an imposing personage, and who was daily wounded by the\r\ndiscovery that after all there are but a limited number of persons in\r\nthis world, especially in the poorer classes of the community, and under\r\nthe age of sixteen, who have a feeling for art. It was utterly\r\ninconceivable to the young teacher how her girls could be so clever as\r\nto find out each a different way of putting the sublime features of the\r\nBelveder Apollo out of drawing, and she was still revolving this\r\ndifficult problem when her sister joined her. Barbara, for her part, was\r\noccupied with thoughts of a hero much more interesting than he of\r\nOlympus. She was flushed and eager, and looking very handsome under her\r\nshabby bonnet; and her anxiety to have a _confidante_ was so great that\r\nshe made a dart at Rose, and grasped her by the arm under which she was\r\ncarrying her portfolio, to the great discomposure of the young artist.\r\nShe asked, with a little anxiety, "What is the matter? is there anything\r\nwrong at home?" and made a rapid movement to get to the other side.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Rose," said Barbara, panting with haste and agitation, "only fancy;\r\nI have just seen him. I met him right in front of Masters\'s, and he took\r\noff his hat to me. I feel in such a way--I can scarcely speak."\r\n\r\n"Met--who?" said Rose--for she was imperfect in her grammar, like most\r\npeople in a moment of emergency; and, besides, she shared to some extent\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s reluctance to shock the prejudices of society, and\r\nwas disturbed by the idea that somebody might pass and see Barbara in\r\nher present state of excitement, and perhaps attribute it to its true\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you stupid little thing!" said Barbara, giving her "a shake" by her\r\ndisengaged arm. "I tell you, _him_!--the gentleman I met at Lucilla\r\nMarjoribanks\'s. He looked as if he was quite delighted to see me again;\r\nand I am sure he turned round to see where I was going. He couldn\'t\r\nspeak to me, you know, the first time; though indeed I shouldn\'t be the\r\nleast surprised if he had followed--at a distance, you know, only to see\r\nwhere I live," said Barbara, turning round and searching into the\r\ndistance with her eager eyes. But there was nobody to be seen in the\r\nstreet, except some of Rose\'s pupils lingering along in the sunshine,\r\nand very probably exchanging similar confidences. Barbara turned back\r\nagain with a touch of disappointment. "I am quite sure he will find out\r\nbefore long; and don\'t forget I said so," she added, with a little nod\r\nof her head.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what it matters if he found out directly," said Rose. "Papa\r\nwould not let anybody come to our house that he did not approve of; and\r\nthen, you know, he will never have anything to say to people who are\r\npatronising. I don\'t want to hear any more about your fine gentleman. If\r\nyou were worried as I am, you would think much more of getting home than\r\nof anybody bowing to you in the street. One of the gentlemen from\r\nMarlborough House once took off his hat to me," said Rose, with a\r\ncertain solemnity. "Of course I was pleased; but then I knew it was my\r\ndesign he was thinking of--my Honiton flounce, you know. I suppose this\r\nother one must have thought you had a pretty voice."\r\n\r\nThis time, however, it was an angry shake that Barbara gave to her\r\nsister. "I wish you would not be such a goose," she said; "who cares\r\nabout your Honiton flounce? He took off his hat because--because he\r\nadmired me, I suppose--and then it was a great deal more than just\r\ntaking off his hat. He gave me such a look! Papa has no sense, though I\r\nsuppose you will blaze up when I say so. He ought to think of us a\r\nlittle. As for patronising, I should soon change that, I can tell you.\r\nBut then papa thinks of nothing but paying his bills and keeping out of\r\ndebt, as he says--as if everybody was not in debt; and how do you\r\nsuppose we are ever to get settled in life? It would be far more\r\nsensible to spend a little more, and go into society a little, and do us\r\njustice. Only think all that that old Doctor is doing for Lucilla; and\r\nthere are four of us when the little ones grow up," said Barbara, in a\r\ntone of injury. "I should like to know what papa is thinking of? If\r\nmamma had not died when she did----"\r\n\r\n"It was not poor mamma\'s fault," said Rose. "I dare say she would have\r\nlived if she could for all our sakes. But then you have always taken a\r\nfalse view of our position, Barbara. We are a family of _artists_," said\r\nthe little mistress of the School of Design. She had pretty eyes, very\r\ndewy and clear, and they woke up under the excitement of this proud\r\nclaim. "When papa is appreciated as he deserves, and when Willie has\r\n_made a name_" said Rose, with modest confidence, "things will be\r\ndifferent. But the true strength of our position is that we are a family\r\nof artists. We are everybody\'s equal, and we are nobody\'s equal. We have\r\na rank of our own. If you would only remember this, you would not grudge\r\nanything to Lucilla Marjoribanks; and then I am sure she has been very\r\nkind to you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother!" said the unfeeling Barbara. "You do nothing but encourage\r\npapa with your nonsense. And I should like to know what right Lucilla\r\nMarjoribanks has to be kind to me? If I am not as good as she, it is a\r\nvery strange thing. I should never take the trouble to think about _him_\r\nif it was not that Lucilla believes he is paying her attention--that is\r\nthe great fun. It would be delicious to take him from her, and make game\r\nof her and her kindness. Goodness! there he is again. I felt sure that\r\nhe would try to find out the house."\r\n\r\nAnd Barbara crimsoned higher than ever, and held Rose fast by the arm,\r\nand called her attention by the most visible and indeed tangible signs\r\nto the elegant apparition, like any other underbred young woman. As for\r\nRose, she was a little gentlewoman born, and had a horror unspeakable of\r\nher sister\'s bad manners. When Mr Cavendish made a movement as if to\r\naddress Barbara, it was the pretty gray eyes of Rose lifted to his face\r\nwith a look of straightforward surprise and inquiry which made him\r\nretire so hastily. He took off his hat again more respectfully than\r\nbefore, and pursued his walk along Grove Street, as if he had no\r\nulterior intention in visiting that humble part of the town. As for\r\nBarbara, she held Rose faster than ever, and almost pinched her arm to\r\nmake her listen. "I knew he was trying to find out the house," she said,\r\nin an exultant whisper. "And Lucilla thinks he is paying her\r\nattention!" For the fact was, that when Miss Marjoribanks took to being\r\nkind to Barbara, she conferred upon the contralto at the same moment a\r\npalpable injury and grievance, which was what the drawing-master\'s\r\ndaughter had been looking for, for several years of her life. And\r\nnaturally Lucilla, who was at this moment thinking it all over under the\r\nsoft green shadows from her new hangings, was deprived of the light\r\nwhich might have been thrown on her reflections, had she seen what was\r\ngoing on in Grove Street. The conditions of humanity are such that even\r\na woman of genius cannot altogether overstep them. And Lucilla still\r\ncontinued to think that Mr Cavendish was paying her attention, which,\r\nindeed, was also the general opinion in Grange Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XII_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second of her Thursday evenings found Miss Marjoribanks, though\r\nsecure, perhaps more anxious than on the former occasion. The charm of\r\nthe first novelty was gone, and Lucilla did not feel quite sure that her\r\nsubjects had the good sense to recognise all the benefits which she was\r\ngoing to confer upon them. "It is the second time that counts," she said\r\nin confidence to Mrs Chiley. "Last Thursday they wanted to see the\r\ndrawing-room, and they wanted to know what sort of thing it was to be.\r\nDear Mrs Chiley, it is to-night that is the test," said Lucilla, giving\r\na nervous pressure to her old friend\'s hand; at least a pressure that\r\nwould have betokened the existence of nerves in any one else but Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, whose magnificent organisation was beyond any suspicion of\r\nsuch weakness. But, nevertheless, Mrs Chiley, who watched her with\r\ngrandmotherly interest, was comforted to perceive that Lucilla, as on\r\nthe former occasion, had strength of mind to eat her dinner. "She wants\r\na little support, poor dear," the old lady said in her heart; for she\r\nwas a kinder critic than the younger matrons, who felt instinctively\r\nthat Miss Marjoribanks was doing what they ought to have done. She took\r\nher favourite\'s arm in hers as they went upstairs, and gave Mr Cavendish\r\na kindly nod as he opened the door for them. "He will come and give you\r\nhis assistance as soon as ever he can get away from the gentlemen,"\r\nsaid Mrs Chiley, in her consolatory tone; "but, good gracious, Lucilla,\r\nwhat is the matter?" The cause of this exclamation was a universal hum\r\nand rustle as of many dresses and many voices; and, to tell the truth,\r\nwhen Miss Marjoribanks and her companion reached the top of the stairs,\r\nthey found themselves lost in a laughing crowd, which had taken refuge\r\non the landing. "There is no room, Lucilla. Lucilla, everybody in\r\nCarlingford is here. Do make a little room for us in the drawing-room,"\r\ncried this overplus of society. If there was an enviable woman in\r\nCarlingford at that moment, it certainly was Miss Marjoribanks, standing\r\non the top of her own stairs, scarcely able to penetrate through the\r\nthrong of her guests. Her self-possession did not forsake her at this\r\nsupreme moment. She grasped Mrs Chiley once again with a little\r\nsignificant gesture which pleased the old lady, for she could not but\r\nfeel that she was Lucilla\'s only _confidante_ in her brilliant but\r\nperilous undertaking. "_They_ will not be able to get in when they come\r\nupstairs," said Miss Marjoribanks; and whether the faint inflection in\r\nher voice meant exultation or disappointment, her old friend could not\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nBut the scene changed when the rightful sovereign entered the gay but\r\ndisorganised dominion where her subjects attended her. Before any one\r\nknew how it was done, Miss Marjoribanks had re-established order, and,\r\nwhat was still more important, made room. She said, "You girls have no\r\nbusiness to get into corners. The corners are for the people that can\r\ntalk. It is one of my principles always to flirt in the middle of the\r\ncompany," said Lucilla; and again, as happened so often, ignorant people\r\nlaughed and thought it a _bon mot_. But it is needless to inform the\r\nmore intelligent persons who understand Miss Marjoribanks, that it was\r\nby no means a _bon mot_, but expressed Lucilla\'s convictions with the\r\nutmost sincerity.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that the second Thursday was more brilliant and\r\ninfinitely more gratifying than the first had been. For one thing, she\r\nfelt sure that it was not to see the new furniture, nor to criticise\r\nthis new sort of entertainment, but with the sincerest intention of\r\nenjoying themselves, that all the people had come; and there are moments\r\nwhen the egotism of the public conveys the highest compliment that can\r\nbe paid to the great minds which take in hand to rule and to amuse it.\r\nThe only drawback was, that Barbara Lake did not show the same modesty\r\nand reticence as on the former occasion. Far from being sensibly\r\nsilent, which she had been so prudent as to be on Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\nfirst Thursday, she forgot herself so far as to occupy a great deal of\r\nMr Cavendish\'s valuable time, which he might have employed much more\r\nusefully. She not only sang by herself when he asked her, having brought\r\nsome music with her unseen by Lucilla, but she kept her seat upon the\r\nstool before the piano ever so long afterwards, detaining him, and, as\r\nMiss Marjoribanks had very little doubt, making an exhibition of\r\nherself: for Barbara, having received one good gift from nature, had\r\nbeen refused the other, and could not talk. When Lucilla, arrested in\r\nthe midst of her many occupations, heard her prot\xe9g\xe9e\'s voice rising\r\nalone, she stopped quite short with an anxiety which it was touching to\r\nbehold. It was not the jealousy of a rival cantatrice which inspired\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s countenance, but the far broader and grander anxiety\r\nof an accomplished statesman, who sees a rash and untrained hand\r\nmeddling with his most delicate machinery. Lucilla ignored everything\r\nfor the moment--her own voice, and Mr Cavendish\'s attentions, and every\r\nmerely secondary and personal emotion. All these details were swallowed\r\nup in the fear that Barbara would not acquit herself as it was necessary\r\nfor the credit of the house that she should acquit herself; that she\r\nshould not sing well enough, or that she should sing too much. Once more\r\nMiss Marjoribanks put her finger upon the pulse of the community as she\r\nand they listened together. Fortunately, things went so far well that\r\nBarbara sang her very best, and kept up her prestige: but it was\r\ndifferent in the second particular; for, unluckily, the contralto knew a\r\ngreat many songs, and showed no inclination to stop. Nothing remained\r\nfor it but a bold _coup_, which Lucilla executed with all her natural\r\ncoolness and success.\r\n\r\n"My dear Barbara," she said, putting her hands on the singer\'s shoulders\r\nas she finished her strain, "that is enough for to-night. Mr Cavendish\r\nwill take you downstairs and get you a cup of tea; for you know there is\r\nno room to-night to serve it upstairs." Thus Miss Marjoribanks proved\r\nherself capable of preferring her great work to her personal sentiments,\r\nwhich is generally considered next to impossible for a woman. She did\r\nwhat perhaps nobody else in the room was capable of doing: she sent away\r\nthe gentleman who was paying attention to her, in company with the girl\r\nwho was paying attention to him; and at that moment, as was usual when\r\nshe was excited, Barbara was splendid, with her crimson cheeks, and the\r\neyes blazing out from under her level eyebrows. This Miss Marjoribanks\r\ndid, not in ignorance, but with a perfect sense of what she was about.\r\nIt was the only way of preventing her Evening from losing its\r\ndistinctive character. It was the Lamp of sacrifice which Lucilla had\r\nnow to employ, and she proved herself capable of the exertion. But it\r\nwould be hopeless to attempt to describe the indignation of old Mrs\r\nChiley, or the unmitigated amazement of the company in general, which\r\nwas conscious at the same time that Mr Cavendish was paying attention to\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, and that he had been flirting in an inexcusable\r\nmanner with Miss Lake. "My dear, I would have nothing to do with that\r\nbold girl," Mrs Chiley said in Lucilla\'s ear. "I will go down and look\r\nafter them if you like. A girl like that always leads the gentlemen\r\nastray, you know. I never liked the looks of her. Let me go downstairs\r\nand look after them, my dear. I am sure I want a cup of tea."\r\n\r\n"You shall have a cup of tea, dear Mrs Chiley," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks--"some of them will bring you one; but I can\'t let you take\r\nany trouble about Barbara. She had to be stopped, you know, or she would\r\nhave turned us into a musical party; and as for Mr Cavendish, he is the\r\nbest assistant I have. There are so few men in Carlingford who can\r\nflirt," said Lucilla regretfully. Her eyes fell as she spoke upon young\r\nOsmond Brown, who was actually at that moment talking to Mr Bury\'s\r\ncurate, with a disregard of his social duties painful to contemplate.\r\nPoor Osmond started when he met Miss Marjoribanks\'s reproachful eye.\r\n\r\n"But then I don\'t know how," said the disconcerted youth,--and he\r\nflushed, poor boy, being only eighteen, and not much more than a\r\nschoolboy. As for Lucilla, who had no intention of putting up with that\r\nsort of thing, she sent off the curate summarily for Mrs Chiley\'s cup of\r\ntea.\r\n\r\n"I did not mean you, my dear Osy," she said, in her motherly tone. "When\r\nyou are a little older we shall see what you can do; but you are not at\r\nall disagreeable for a boy," she added encouragingly, and took Osmond\'s\r\narm as she made her progress down the room with an indulgence worthy of\r\nher maturer years; and even Mrs Centum and Mrs Woodburn and the Miss\r\nBrowns, who were, in a manner, Lucilla\'s natural rivals, could not but\r\nbe impressed with this evidence of her powers. They were like the Tuscan\r\nchivalry in the ballad, who could scarce forbear a cheer at the sight\r\nof their opponent\'s prowess. Perhaps nothing that she could have done\r\nwould have so clearly demonstrated the superiority of her genius to her\r\nfemale audience as that bold step of stopping the music, which began to\r\nbe too much, by sending off the singer downstairs under charge of Mr\r\nCavendish. To be sure the men did not even find out what it was that\r\nawoke the ladies\' attention; but then, in delicate matters of social\r\npolitics, one never expects to be understood by _them_.\r\n\r\nBarbara Lake, as was to be expected, took a very long time over her cup\r\nof tea; and even when she returned upstairs she made another pause on\r\nthe landing, which was still kept possession of by a lively stream of\r\nyoung people coming and going. Barbara had very little experience, and\r\nshe was weak enough to believe that Mr Cavendish lingered there to have\r\na little more of her society all to himself; but to tell the truth, his\r\nsentiments were of a very different description. For by this time it\r\nmust be owned that Barbara\'s admirer began to feel a little ashamed of\r\nhimself. He could not but be conscious of Lucilla\'s magnanimity; and, at\r\nthe same time, he was very well aware that his return with his present\r\ncompanion would be watched and noted and made the subject of comment a\r\ngreat deal more amusing than agreeable. When he did take Barbara in at\r\nlast, it was with a discomfited air which tickled the spectators beyond\r\nmeasure. And as his evil luck would have it, notwithstanding the long\r\npause he had made on the landing, to watch his opportunity of entering\r\nunobserved, Miss Marjoribanks was the first to encounter the returning\r\ncouple. They met full in the face, a few paces from the door--exactly,\r\nas Mrs Chiley said, as if it had been Mr and Mrs Cavendish on their\r\nwedding visit, and the lady of the house had gone to meet them. As for\r\nthe unfortunate gentleman, he could not have looked more utterly\r\ndisconcerted and guilty if he had been convicted of putting the spoons\r\nin his pocket, or of having designs upon the silver tea-service. He\r\nfound a seat for his companion with all the haste possible; and instead\r\nof lingering by her side, as she had anticipated, made off on the\r\ninstant, and hid himself like a criminal in the dark depths of a group\r\nof men who were talking together near the door. These were men who were\r\nhopeless, and good for nothing but to talk to each other, and whom Miss\r\nMarjoribanks tolerated in her drawing-room partly because their wives,\r\nwith an excusable weakness, insisted on bringing them, and partly\r\nbecause they made a foil to the brighter part of the company, and served\r\nas a butt when anybody wanted to be witty. As for Lucilla, she made no\r\neffort to recall the truant from the ranks of the Incurables. It was the\r\nonly vengeance she took upon his desertion. When he came to take leave\r\nof her, she was standing with her hand in that of Mrs Chiley, who was\r\nalso going away. "I confess I was a little nervous this evening," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was saying. "You know it is always the second that is the\r\ntest. But I think, on the whole, it has gone off very well. Mr\r\nCavendish, you promised to tell me the truth; for you know I have great\r\nconfidence in your judgment. Tell me sincerely, do you think it has been\r\na pleasant evening?" Lucilla said, with a beautiful earnestness, looking\r\nhim in the face.\r\n\r\nThe guilty individual to whom this question was addressed felt disposed\r\nto sink into the earth, if the earth, in the shape of Mr Holden\'s\r\nbeautiful new carpet, would but have opened to receive him; but, after\r\nall, that was perhaps not a thing to be desired under the circumstances.\r\nMr Cavendish, however, was a man of resources, and not disposed to give\r\nup the contest without striking a blow in his own defence.\r\n\r\n"Not so pleasant as last Thursday," he said. "I am not fit to be a\r\nlady\'s adviser, for I am too sincere; but I incline to think it is the\r\nthird that is the test," said the future M.P.; and Lucilla made him, as\r\nMrs Chiley remarked, the most beautiful curtsey; but then nothing could\r\nbe more delightful than the manner in which that dear girl behaved\r\nthrough the whole affair.\r\n\r\n"If everybody would only help me as you do!" said Miss Marjoribanks.\r\n"Good-night; I am so sorry you have not enjoyed yourself. But then it is\r\nsuch a consolation to meet with people that are sincere. And I think, on\r\nthe whole, it has gone off very well for the second," said Lucilla,\r\n"though I say it that should not say it." The fact was, it had gone off\r\nso well that the house could hardly be cleared of the amiable and\r\nsatisfied guests. A series of the most enthusiastic compliments were\r\npaid to Lucilla as she stood in state in the middle of the room, and\r\nbade everybody good-bye. "Next Thursday," she said, with the benevolent\r\ngrace of an acknowledged sovereign. And when they were all gone, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s reflections, as she stood alone in the centre of her\r\ndomains, were of a nature very different from the usual reflections\r\nwhich the giver of a feast is supposed to make when all is over. But\r\nthen, as everybody is aware, it was not a selfish desire for personal\r\npleasure, nor any scheme of worldly ambition, which moved the mind of\r\nLucilla. With such motives it is only natural that the conclusion, "All\r\nis vanity," should occur to the weary entertainer in the midst of his\r\nwithered flowers and extinguished lights. Such ideas had nothing in\r\ncommon with the enlightened conceptions of Miss Marjoribanks. Perhaps it\r\nwould be false to say that she had suffered in the course of this second\r\nThursday, or that a superior intelligence like Lucilla\'s could permit\r\nitself to feel any jealousy of Barbara Lake; but it would be vain to\r\ndeny that she had been _surprised_. And any one who knows Miss\r\nMarjoribanks will acknowledge that a great deal was implied in that\r\nconfession. But then she had triumphed over the weakness, and\r\ntriumphantly proved that her estimate of the importance of her work went\r\nfar beyond the influence of mere personal feeling. In these\r\ncircumstances Lucilla could contemplate her withered flowers with\r\nperfect calmness, without any thought that all was vanity. But then the\r\nfact was, Miss Marjoribanks was accomplishing a great public duty, and\r\nat the same time had the unspeakable consolation of knowing that she had\r\nproved herself a comfort to her dear papa. The Doctor, it is true, after\r\nlooking on for a little with a half-amused consciousness that his own\r\nassistance was totally unnecessary, had gradually veered into a corner,\r\nand from thence had finally managed to escape downstairs to his beloved\r\nlibrary. But then the sense of security and tranquillity with which he\r\nestablished himself at the fire, undisturbed by the gay storm that raged\r\noutside, gave a certain charm to his retirement. He rubbed his hands and\r\nlistened, as a man listens to the wind howling out of doors, when he is\r\nin shelter and comfort. So that, after all, Lucilla\'s sensation of\r\nhaving accomplished her filial duties in the most effective manner was\r\nto a certain extent justified, while at the same time it is quite\r\ncertain that nobody missed Dr Marjoribanks from the pleasant assembly\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XIII_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was thus that the reign of Miss Marjoribanks became gradually\r\nestablished and confirmed in Carlingford. It would be unnecessary to\r\nenter into detail, or to redouble instances of that singular genius\r\nwhich made itself so fully felt to the furthest limits of society, and\r\nwhich even indeed extended those limits miraculously beyond the magic\r\ncircle of Grange Lane. Lucilla\'s powers beguiled not only the Powells\r\nand Sir John Richmond\'s family, who were, as everybody knows, fully\r\nentitled to be called county people, and came only on the Thursdays when\r\nthere was moonlight to light them home, which was not so much to be\r\nwondered at, since county society in those parts was unusually heavy at\r\nthat period; but even, what was more extraordinary, Miss Marjoribanks\r\nmade a lodgment in the enemy\'s country on the other side, and made a\r\ncapture, of all people in the world, of John Brown, who lived in his\r\nfather\'s big old house at the _town_ end of George Street, and had\r\nalways laughed in his cynical way at the pretensions of Grange Lane. But\r\nthen Lucilla had, as all the ladies admitted, an influence over "the\r\ngentlemen," of which, as was natural, they were slightly contemptuous,\r\neven if perhaps envious, to some extent, of the gift. For everybody\r\nknows that it requires very little to satisfy the gentlemen, if a woman\r\nwill only give her mind to it. As for Miss Marjoribanks herself, she\r\nconfessed frankly that she did her best to please Them. "For you know,\r\nafter all, in Carlingford, one is obliged to take them into\r\nconsideration," she said, with a natural apology. "So many of you poor\r\ndear people have to go where they like, and see the people they want you\r\nto see," Miss Marjoribanks added, fluttering her maiden plumes with a\r\ncertain disdainful pity in the very eyes of Mrs Centum and Mrs Woodburn,\r\nwho were well aware, both of them, at the bottom of their hearts, that\r\nbut for Dr Marjoribanks\'s dinners, their selfish mates would find\r\ninfinite objections to the Thursday evening, which was now an\r\ninstitution in Carlingford. And Lucilla knew it just as well as they\r\ndid, which gave a certain sense of condescension and superiority to her\r\nfrankness. "I never pretend I don\'t try to please them," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks said; and the matrons found themselves worsted as usual;\r\nfor, to be sure, it was not for _Them_, but for the good of the\r\ncommunity in general, that Lucilla exerted herself so successfully.\r\n\r\nNothing, indeed, could have proved more completely the disinterested\r\ncharacter of Miss Marjoribanks\'s proceedings than her behaviour in\r\nrespect to Mr Cavendish. After the bold and decisive action taken by\r\nLucilla on the first occasion when the flirtation between him and\r\nBarbara Lake became apparent, the misguided young man returned to a\r\nbetter frame of mind; perhaps out of admiration for her magnanimity,\r\nperhaps attracted by her indifference, as is the known and ascertained\r\nweakness of the gentlemen. And perhaps also Mr Cavendish was ashamed of\r\nhimself, as, in Mrs Chiley\'s opinion at least, he had so much reason to\r\nbe. Anyhow, whatever the cause, he behaved himself with the profoundest\r\ndecorum for several weeks in succession, and treated the contralto with\r\nsuch overwhelming politeness as reduced poor Barbara out of her\r\nmomentary exultation into the depths of humiliation and despair. Mr\r\nCavendish was Lucilla\'s right hand for that short but virtuous period,\r\nand fully justified Miss Marjoribanks\'s opinion, which was founded at\r\nonce upon reflection and experience, that to have a man who can flirt is\r\nnext thing to indispensable to a leader of society; that is to say, if\r\nhe is under efficient discipline, and capable of carrying out a grand\r\nconception. Everything went on delightfully so long as this interval\r\nlasted, and Lucilla herself did not disdain to recompense her faithful\r\nassistant by bestowing upon him various little privileges, such as\r\nnaturally appertain to a subject whose place is on the steps of the\r\nthrone. She took him into her confidence, and made him to a certain\r\nextent a party to her large and philanthropic projects, and even now and\r\nthen accepted a suggestion from him with that true candour and modesty\r\nwhich so often accompany administrative genius. While this continued,\r\nkind old Mrs Chiley kept caressing them both in her old-womanly way. She\r\neven went so far as to call Mr Cavendish "my dear," as if he had been a\r\ngrandson of her own, and took her afternoon drive in her little brougham\r\npast his house with a genial sense of prospective property through\r\nLucilla, which was wonderfully pleasant. To be sure there was not very\r\nmuch known in Carlingford about his connections; but then everybody was\r\naware that he was one of the Cavendishes, and the people who are not\r\ncontent with that must be hard indeed to please. As for Mrs Woodburn,\r\nshe, it was true, continued to "take off" Miss Marjoribanks; but then,\r\nas Mrs Chiley justly remarked, she was a woman who would take off the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury or the Virgin Mary, if she had the opportunity;\r\nand there was no fear but Lucilla, if once married, would soon bring her\r\nto her senses; and then Mr Chiltern grew more and more feeble, and was\r\nscarcely once in a fortnight in his place in Parliament, which was a\r\nsacrifice of the interests of the borough dreadful to contemplate. And\r\nthus it was in the interests of Lucilla, notwithstanding that ladies are\r\nnot eligible for election under such circumstances, that Mrs Chiley\r\ncarried on a quiet little canvass for the future M.P.\r\n\r\nAll this lasted, alas! only too short a time. After a while the level\r\neyebrows and flashing eyes and magnificent voice of Barbara Lake began\r\nto reassert their ancient power. Whatever may be the predisposition of\r\nthe Cavendishes in general, this particular member of the race was\r\nunable to resist these influences. Barbara had managed to persuade Rose\r\nto persuade her father that it was necessary for her to have a new\r\ndress; and Mr Lake was more persuadable than usual, being naturally\r\npleased to be complimented, when he went to give his lessons, on his\r\ndaughter\'s beautiful voice. "Her talent has taken another development\r\nfrom _ours_," he said, with his little air of dignity, "but still she\r\nhas the artist temperament. All my children have been brought up to love\r\nthe beautiful;" and this argument had, of course, all the more effect\r\nupon him when repeated by his favourite daughter. "And then Barbara has\r\nsuch a noble head," said Rose; "when nobody is looking at her she always\r\nmakes a fine composition. To be sure, when she is observed she gets\r\nawkward, and puts herself out of drawing; but that is not to be wondered\r\nat. I don\'t want her to be fine, or to imitate the Grange Lane people;\r\nbut then, you know, papa, you always say that we have a rank of our own,\r\nbeing a family of artists," said Rose, holding up her little head with a\r\npretty arrogance which delighted the father both in a paternal and a\r\nprofessional point of view. "If one could only have made a study of her\r\nat that moment," he said to himself regretfully; and he consented to\r\nBarbara\'s dress.\r\n\r\nAs for the contralto, whose sentiments were very different from those of\r\nher father and sister, she watched over the making of the robe thus\r\nprocured with a certain jealous care which nobody unacquainted with the\r\nhabits of a family of artists could understand. Barbara\'s talent was not\r\nsufficiently developed to permit of her making it herself; but she knew\r\nalready by sad experience that Rose\'s views of what was picturesque in\r\ncostume were peculiar, and not always successful. And then it was only a\r\nnew dress to Rose, whereas to Barbara it was a supreme effort of passion\r\nand ambition and jealousy and wounded _amour propre_. Mr Cavendish had\r\npaid a great deal of attention to her, and she had naturally entertained\r\ndreams of the wildest and most magnificent character--of riding in her\r\ncarriage, as she would herself have said, and dressing as nobody else\r\ndressed in Carlingford, and becoming the great lady of the town, and\r\neclipsing utterly Lucilla Marjoribanks, who had been so impertinent as\r\nto patronise her. Such had been Barbara\'s delicious dreams for a whole\r\nfortnight; and then Mr Cavendish, who had taken her up, put her down\r\nagain, and went away from her side, and delivered himself over, heart\r\nand soul, to the service of Lucilla. Barbara had no intellect to speak\r\nof, but she had what she called a heart--that is to say, a vital centre\r\nof inclinations and passions, all of which were set in motion by that\r\nintense force of self-regard which belongs to some of the lower\r\norganisations. Thus she arrayed herself, not in simple muslin, but in\r\nall the power of fascination which a strong will and fixed purpose can\r\nadd to beauty. And in her excitement, and with the sense she had that\r\nthis was her opportunity, and that advancement and grandeur depended\r\nupon the result of her night\'s work, her level eyebrows, and flushing\r\ncheeks, and black intense eyes, rose almost into positive beauty. There\r\nwas nobody in the room to compare with her when she stood up to sing on\r\nthat memorable evening. The Miss Browns, for example, were very pretty,\r\nespecially Lydia, who was afterwards married to young Richmond, Sir\r\nJohn\'s eldest son; and they were much _nicer_ girls, and far more\r\nengaging than Barbara Lake, who was not even a lady, Mrs Chiley said.\r\nBut then her determination, though it was a poor enough thing in itself,\r\ngave a certain glow and passion to her coarser beauty.\r\n\r\nWhen she stood up to sing, the whole room was struck with her\r\nappearance. She had her new dress on, and though it was only white\r\nmuslin like other people\'s, it gave her the air of a priestess inspired\r\nby some approaching crisis, and sweeping forward upon the victim who\r\nwas ready to be sacrificed. And yet the victim that night was far from\r\nbeing ready for the sacrifice. On the contrary, he had been thinking it\r\nall over, and had concluded that prudence and every other reasonable\r\nsentiment were on the other side, and that in many ways it would be a\r\nvery good thing for him if he could persuade Miss Marjoribanks to\r\npreside over and share his fortunes. He had made up his mind to this\r\nwith all the more certainty that he was a man habitually prone to run\r\noff after everything that attracted him, in direct opposition to\r\nprudence--an inclination which he shared with his sister, who, as\r\neverybody knew, had ruined poor Mr Woodburn\'s fortunes by "taking off,"\r\nbefore his very face, the only rich uncle in the Woodburn family. Mr\r\nCavendish, with this wise resolution in his mind, stood up in the very\r\npath of the contralto as she followed Miss Marjoribanks to the piano,\r\nand, confident in his determination, even allowed himself to meet her\r\neye--which was rash, to say the least of it. Barbara flashed upon him as\r\nshe passed a blaze of intense oblique lightning from under her level\r\nbrows--or perhaps it was only that straight black line which made it\r\nlook oblique--and then went on to her place. The result was such as\r\nmight have been anticipated from the character of the man. Barbara was\r\nin richer voice than ever before, and all but obliterated even Lucilla,\r\nthough she too was singing her best; and thus poor Mr Cavendish again\r\nfell into the snare. That very night the flirtation, which had already\r\ncreated so much talk, was resumed with more energy than ever; and\r\nBarbara took Miss Marjoribanks\'s place at the piano, and sang song after\r\nsong in a kind of intoxication of triumph. This, to be sure, was visible\r\nonly to a small portion of the guests who crowded Lucilla\'s\r\ndrawing-room. But the result was soon so visible that all Carlingford\r\nbecame aware of it. The hero wavered so much that the excitement was\r\nkept up for many weeks; but still from the first nobody could have any\r\nreasonable doubt as to how it was to end.\r\n\r\nAnd it was while this process of seduction was going on that the\r\ncharacter of Miss Marjoribanks revealed itself in all its native\r\ngrandeur. Lucilla had various kind friends round her to advise her, and\r\nespecially old Mrs Chiley, whose indignation went beyond all bounds. "My\r\ndear, I would never let her enter my door again--never!" cried the old\r\nlady; "I told you long ago I never could bear her looks--you know I\r\nwarned you, Lucilla. As for her singing, what does it matter? You have a\r\nmuch prettier voice than she has: everybody knows that a soprano is\r\nperfect by itself, but a contralto is only a _second_," Mrs Chiley said,\r\nwith mingled wrath and satisfaction; "and, my dear, I should never let\r\nher enter my house again, if it was me."\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley," said Lucilla, who was now, as usual, equal to the\r\noccasion, "it is so nice of you to be vexed. You know I would do\r\nanything to please you;--but, after all, there are thousands and\r\nthousands of gentlemen, and it is not so easy to find a voice that goes\r\nwith mine. All my masters always said it was a quite peculiar second I\r\nwanted; and suppose Barbara is foolish, that is not to say I should\r\nforget _my_ duties," Miss Marjoribanks added, with a certain solemnity;\r\n"and then, you know, she has no mother to keep her right."\r\n\r\n"And neither have you, my poor dear," said Mrs Chiley, kissing her\r\nprot\xe9g\xe9e. As for Lucilla, she accepted the kiss, but repressed the\r\nenthusiasm of partisanship with which her cause was being maintained.\r\n\r\n"I have _you_," she said, with artless gratitude; "and then I am\r\ndifferent," added Lucilla. Nothing but modesty of the most delicate\r\ndescription could have expressed the fact with such a fine reticence. No\r\ndoubt Miss Marjoribanks was different; and she proved her superiority,\r\nif anybody could have doubted it, by the most beautiful behaviour. She\r\ntook no more notice of the unprincipled flirtation thus set agoing under\r\nher very eyes, than if Mr Cavendish and Barbara Lake had been two\r\nfigures in gingerbread. So far as anybody knew, not even a flying female\r\nshaft from Lucilla\'s bow, one of those dainty projectiles which the best\r\nof women cast forth by times, had ever been directed against the\r\nungrateful young person who had made so unprincipled a use of her\r\nadmittance into Grange Lane; and the faithless gallant had not even the\r\ngratification of feeling that Lucilla was "cool" to him. Whether this\r\nsingular self-denial cost Miss Marjoribanks any acute sufferings, nobody\r\ncould tell, but Mrs Chiley still marked with satisfaction that Lucilla,\r\npoor dear, was able to eat her dinner, of which she had so much need to\r\nsupport her strength; and after she had eaten her dinner Miss\r\nMarjoribanks would go upstairs and show herself just as usual. She was\r\nin perfect voice, and neither lost her colour, nor grew thin, nor showed\r\nany of those external signs of a disappointment in love with which most\r\npeople are familiar. "It might have been different, you know, if my\r\naffections had been engaged," she said to her sole and sympathising\r\ncounsellor; and Mrs Chiley, who had had a great deal of experience in\r\ngirls, became more and more of opinion that such sense was all but\r\nsuperhuman.\r\n\r\nMeantime the tide of public opinion ran very high in Carlingford against\r\nMr Cavendish, who had been so popular a little while before. If it had\r\nbeen one of the Miss Browns, or a niece of the Colonel\'s, or indeed\r\nanybody in Grange Lane, people might have passed over it--but one of Mr\r\nLake the drawing-master\'s daughters! The only person indifferent was Mrs\r\nWoodburn, who ought to have known better; but then she was thoughtless,\r\nlike her brother, and liked it all the better, on the whole, that he\r\nshould transfer those attentions which he had been paying to Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, and which in that quarter must have come to something, to\r\na little harmless amusement with Barbara, who, after all, was very\r\nhandsome, and had by times a little air of obdurate stupidity which\r\ncaptivated the mimic. As for anything coming of _that_, Mrs Woodburn\r\nrejected the idea with a simplicity which was perfectly consistent with\r\nher insight into other people\'s weaknesses. She could put on Barbara\'s\r\nstolid defiant look, and even make her eyebrows square, and give\r\nsomething of an oblique gleam to her eyes, with the most perfect skill\r\nand mastery of the character, and at the same time be just as stolid as\r\nBarbara in respect to what was going on at her very hand, and to the\r\nconsequences which must follow. She did not want her brother to marry\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, and yet she could not have said a word against so\r\nunexceptionable a match; and accordingly it was quite a satisfaction to\r\nher to see him turned aside in so perfectly legitimate a manner. She\r\nadded to her repertory a sketch of Barbara at the moment when, yielding\r\nto Mr Cavendish\'s entreaties, she seated herself at the piano "for just\r\none song"; and being perfectly successful in the representation, Mrs\r\nWoodburn took no further care about the matter. To be sure, the hero was\r\nsufficiently experienced in such matters to know how to get out of it\r\nwhen it should be the proper time.\r\n\r\nThus the affair progressed which was to have far more serious\r\nconsequences than these thoughtless persons dreamed of. Barbara ascended\r\nagain to the heights of exultation and enchantment. Perhaps she was even\r\na little in love; for, after all, she was young, and grateful to the man\r\nwho thus distinguished her from the world. Yet, on the whole, it is to\r\nbe feared that his house and his position in society, and the prospect\r\nof unlimited millinery, were more to her than Mr Cavendish. All these\r\ndetails were not perhaps contemplated by himself as he devoted himself\r\nto the handsome contralto. He had not begun to dream, as Barbara had\r\ndone for a long time, of the wedding breakfast and the orange blossoms,\r\nor even of furnishing a new drawing-room handsomer than Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s, and giving parties which should be real parties and not\r\nmere Thursdays. None of these imaginations occupied Mr Cavendish as he\r\nfollowed Barbara\'s glowing cheeks and flashing eyes to his undoing. But\r\nthen if he did not mean it she meant it; and, after all, there are\r\noccasions in which the woman\'s determination is the more important of\r\nthe two. So that, taking everything into consideration, there can be no\r\ndoubt that it was very fortunate that Lucilla\'s affections were not\r\nengaged. She behaved as nobody else in Carlingford was capable of\r\nbehaving, and very few people anywhere, according to Mrs Chiley\'s\r\nadmiring belief. It was not for a vulgar antagonist like Barbara Lake to\r\ntouch Lucilla. The way in which she asked her to lunch and went on\r\npractising duets with her was angelical--it brought the tears to Mrs\r\nChiley\'s eyes; and as for the domestic traitor whom Miss Marjoribanks\r\nthus contrived to warm in her magnanimous bosom, she was sometimes so\r\nfull of spite and disappointment that she could neither eat her lunch\r\nnor go on with her singing. For, to be sure, the dearest climax of her\r\ntriumph was wanting so long as Lucilla took no notice; and so far from\r\ntaking any notice, Miss Marjoribanks was sweeter and more friendly than\r\nusual in her serene unconsciousness. "I am so afraid you have caught\r\ncold," Lucilla would say; "if you don\'t feel clear in your lower notes,\r\nwe can pass over this passage, you know, for to-day. You must see papa\r\nbefore you go away, and he will order you something; but, my dear\r\nBarbara, you must take care." And then Barbara could have eaten her\r\nfingers instead of the gloves which she kept biting in her vexation.\r\nFor, to tell the truth, if Miss Marjoribanks was not jealous, the\r\nvictory was but half a victory after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XIV_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Miss Marjoribanks went through all the preliminary\r\nstages, and succeeded finally in making a triumph out of what would\r\ncertainly have been a defeat, and a humbling defeat, for anybody else.\r\nShe was much too sensible to deceive herself on the subject, or not to\r\nbe aware that to have a gentleman who was paying attention to her\r\nwithdrawn from her side in this open manner in the sight of all the\r\nworld, was as trying an accident as can happen to a woman. Fortunately,\r\nas Lucilla said, her affections were not engaged; but then, apart from\r\nthe affections, there are other sentiments which demand consideration.\r\nEverybody in Carlingford knew that Mr Cavendish had been paying her a\r\ngreat deal of attention, and the situation was one which required the\r\nmost delicate skill to get through it successfully. Besides, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s circumstances were all the more difficult, since up to\r\nthis moment she had been perfectly sincere and natural in all her\r\nproceedings. Policy had been constantly inspired and backed by nature in\r\nthe measures Lucilla had taken for the organisation and welfare of her\r\nkingdom, and even what people took for the cleverest calculation was in\r\nreality a succession of happy instincts, by means of which, with the\r\nsovereignty of true genius, Miss Marjoribanks managed to please\r\neverybody by having her own way. A little victory is almost necessary to\r\nbegin with, and it is a poor nature that does not expand under the\r\nstimulus of victory; but now the young reformer had come to the second\r\nstage. For, to be sure, that sort of thing cannot last for ever; and\r\nthis Lucilla, with the natural prevision of a ruling mind, had foreseen\r\nfrom the beginning. The shape in which she had feared defeat, if a\r\nnature so full of resources could ever be said to fear, was that of a\r\nbreakdown, when all the world was looking to her for amusement, or the\r\nsudden appearance of a rival entertainer in Carlingford with superior\r\npowers: though the last was but a dim and improbable danger, the first\r\nwas quite possible, and might have arrived at any moment. Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was much too sensible not to have foreseen this danger in\r\nall its shapes, and even in a kind of way to have provided against it.\r\nBut Providence, which had always taken care of her, as Lucilla piously\r\nconcluded, had spared her the trial in that form. Up to this moment it\r\nhad always providentially happened that all the principal people in\r\nCarlingford were quite well and disengaged on the "evening." To be sure,\r\nthe ladies had headaches, and the married gentlemen now and then were\r\nout of temper in Grange Lane as in other less favoured places; but these\r\nsocial accidents had been mercifully averted on Thursdays, perhaps by\r\nmeans of some special celestial agency, perhaps only through that\r\ngood-luck which had been born with Lucilla. Not in this vulgar and\r\nlikely manner was the trial of her strength to come.\r\n\r\nBut when she was at the height of her success, and full in the eye of\r\nthe world, and knew that everybody was remarking her, and that from the\r\nsauces for which the Doctor\'s table was once so famed, but which even\r\nColonel Chiley no longer thought of identifying as Dr Marjoribanks\'s, to\r\nthe fashion of the _high_ white frock in which Lucilla had taught the\r\nyoung ladies of Carlingford to appear of an evening, she was being\r\nimitated on every hand,--at that moment, when an ordinary person would\r\nhave had her head turned, and gone wild with too much success, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks suddenly saw her dragon approaching her. Just then, when\r\nshe could not put on a new ribbon, or do her hair in a different style,\r\nwithout all Carlingford knowing of it--at that epoch of intoxication and\r\ntriumph the danger came, sudden, appalling, and unlooked for. If Lucilla\r\nwas staggered by the encounter, she never showed it, but met the\r\ndifficulty like a woman of mettle, and scorned to flinch. It had come to\r\nbe summer weather when the final day arrived upon which Mr Cavendish\r\nforgot himself altogether, and went over to the insidious enemy whom\r\nMiss Marjoribanks had been nourishing in her bosom. Fifty eyes were upon\r\nLucilla watching her conduct at that critical moment--fifty ears were on\r\nthe strain to divine her sentiments in her voice, and to catch some\r\nintonation at least which should betray her consciousness of what was\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\nBut if Miss Marjoribanks\'s biographer has fitly discharged his duty, the\r\nreaders of this history will have no difficulty in divining that the\r\ncuriosity of the spectators got no satisfaction from Lucilla. Many\r\npeople even supposed she had not remarked anything, her composure was so\r\nperfect. No growing red or growing pale, no harsh notes in her voice,\r\nnor evidence of distracted attention, betrayed that her mind was\r\nelsewhere while she was attending to her guests; and yet, to be sure,\r\nshe saw, just as other people did, that Barbara, all flushed and\r\ncrimson, with her eyes blazing under their sullen brows, stood in a glow\r\nof triumph at the open window, with Mr Cavendish in devoted\r\nattendance--a captive at her chariot-wheels. Matters had been\r\nprogressing to this point for some time; but yet the two culprits had\r\nnever before showed themselves so lost to all sense of propriety.\r\nInstead of fainting or getting pale, or showing any other symptoms of\r\nviolent despite, Lucilla went upon her airy way, indirectly approaching\r\nthis point of interest. She went up and chatted with them, and ordered\r\nMr Cavendish to find a chair for Barbara. "What can you be thinking of\r\nto let her stand so near the window? If she were to catch cold and lose\r\nher voice, what should we all do?" said Lucilla; and she established the\r\ntwo in the most commodious corner before she left them. "Take care she\r\ndoes not go back again into the draught," were her parting words, and\r\neven the culprits themselves could do nothing but stare at each other\r\nwith consternation and shame.\r\n\r\nThis was all the notice Lucilla took of what was going on. If she was\r\naffronted, or if she was wounded, nobody found it out; and when Mrs\r\nChiley offered the tribute of her indignation and sympathy, it has\r\nalready been recorded how her young friend responded to her.\r\n"Fortunately my affections never were engaged," Lucilla said, and no\r\ndoubt that was a great advantage; but then, as we have said, there are\r\nother things besides affections to be taken into account when the woman\r\nwhom you have been kind to snaps up the man who has been paying\r\nattention to you, not only before your eyes, but before the eyes of all\r\nthe world. The result of her masterly conduct on this occasion was that\r\nher defeat became, as we have said, a triumph for Miss Marjoribanks. To\r\nbe sure, it is to be hoped that, in the sweets of their mutual regard,\r\nthe two criminals found compensation for the disapproval of the\r\nspectators; but nothing could be more marked than the way in which\r\nCarlingford turned its cold shoulder on its early favourite. "I never\r\nimagined Cavendish was such a fool," Mr Centum said, who was a man of\r\nfew words; "if he likes that style of philandering, it is nothing to me,\r\nbut he need not make an idiot of himself." As for Mr Woodburn, he, as\r\nwas natural, inflicted vicarious punishment upon his wife. "It must be\r\nall your fault," he growled, when he was taking her home, and had her\r\nat his mercy, with that logic peculiar to a married man; "you ought to\r\ntell him he\'s making an ass of himself. Why the deuce do you let him go\r\non with that tomfoolery? He\'ll lose all his chances in life, and then, I\r\nhope, you\'ll be satisfied. You women can never see an inch before your\r\nown noses!" cried the uncivil husband; which, it must be confessed, was\r\nrather hard upon poor Mrs Woodburn, who had nothing to do with it, and\r\nhad indeed calculated upon perfecting her sketch of Barbara in the\r\nquietness of the walk home; for as everybody lived in Grange Lane,\r\ncarriages were not necessary for Miss Marjoribanks\'s guests. They\r\nflitted out and in, in the moonlight, with pretty scarfs thrown over\r\ntheir heads and laced handkerchiefs tied under their chins, and made\r\nGrange Lane between the two straight lines of garden-wall like a scene\r\nin a masquerade.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr Cavendish was thus suffering by deputy the contempt of his\r\nformer admirers, Lucilla, by herself in the abandoned drawing-room, was\r\nthinking over the evening with a severe but on the whole satisfactory\r\nself-examination. After the first shock, which she had encountered with\r\nso much courage, Miss Marjoribanks was rather grateful than otherwise to\r\nProvidence, which had brought the necessary trial upon her in this form.\r\nIf it had been a breakdown and humiliating failure instead, how\r\ndifferent would her sensations have been! and Lucilla was quite\r\nconscious that such a thing might have occurred. It might have occurred\r\nto her, as it had done to so many people, to see Thursday come round\r\nwith a failure of all that made Thursday agreeable. Lady Richmond might\r\nhave had her influenza that day, and little Henry Centum his sudden\r\nattack, which had kept his mother in conversation ever since, and Mrs\r\nWoodburn one of her bad headaches; and as for the Miss Browns, there was\r\nnothing in the world but Lucilla\'s habitual good fortune which prevented\r\nthem from having blacked their fingers with their photography to such an\r\nextent as to make them perfectly unpresentable. Or, to turn to another\r\nchapter of accidents, the last duet, which Barbara had insisted upon\r\nsinging without proper practice, might have broken down utterly. None of\r\nthese things had happened, and Lucilla drew a long breath of gratitude\r\nas she thought how fortunate she had been in all these particulars. To\r\nbe sure, it was necessary to have a trial of one kind or other; and the\r\nmodest but intense gratification of having stood the test, diffused\r\nitself like a balm through her bosom. No doubt she would have felt, like\r\nmost people, a certain pleasure in snubbing Barbara; but then there is,\r\non the other hand, a sweetness in sacrificing such impulses to the\r\nsacred sense of duty and the high aims of genius which is still more\r\nattractive to a well-regulated mind. Miss Marjoribanks herself put out\r\nthe candles, and went to her own room with that feeling of having\r\nacquitted herself satisfactorily which many people think to be the\r\nhighest gratification of which the mind is capable. After all, it was by\r\nno means certain that Mr Cavendish would be M.P. for Carlingford. Mr\r\nChiltern might live for twenty years, or he even might get better, which\r\nwas more unlikely; or supposing him to be comfortably disposed of,\r\nnobody could say with any certainty that some man unknown at present in\r\nCarlingford might not start up all of a sudden and gain the most sweet\r\nvoices of the shopkeepers, who were the majority of the community, and\r\nquite outnumbered Grange Lane. It was thus that Lucilla consoled herself\r\nas she went meditative but undaunted to her maiden rest.\r\n\r\nWhile all this was going on, Dr Marjoribanks remained an amused\r\nspectator, and chuckled a little quietly, without saying anything to\r\nanybody, over the turn affairs had taken. The Doctor knew all about\r\neverybody in Carlingford, and he had never been an enthusiast in favour\r\nof Mrs Woodburn\'s brother, notwithstanding that the young man had been\r\nreceived so warmly into society as one of the Cavendishes. Perhaps Dr\r\nMarjoribanks being Scotch, and having a turn for genealogy, found the\r\ndescription a little vague; but at all events there can be no doubt that\r\nhe laughed to himself as he retired from the scene of his daughter\'s\r\ntrial. The Doctor possibly thought, in a professional point of view,\r\nthat a little discipline of this description would be useful to Lucilla.\r\nPerhaps he thought it would be good for her to find out that--though she\r\nhad managed to slip the reins out of his hands, and get the control of\r\naffairs with a skill which amused the Doctor, and made him a little\r\nproud of her abilities, even though he was himself the victim--she could\r\nnot go on always unchecked in her triumphant career, but must endure\r\nlike other people an occasional defeat. No doubt, had Lucilla been\r\nreally worsted, paternal feeling would have interposed, and Dr\r\nMarjoribanks would to some extent have suffered in her suffering; but\r\nthen the case was different, and nobody required, as it turned out, to\r\nsuffer for Lucilla. The Doctor was pleased she had shown so much\r\nspirit, and pleased to see how entirely she had discomfited her\r\nantagonists, and turned the tables upon the "young puppy," in whom he\r\nhad no confidence; and withal Dr Marjoribanks chuckled a little in his\r\nsecret heart over the event itself, and concluded that it would do\r\nLucilla good. She had vanquished Nancy, and by a skilful jerk taken the\r\nreins out of his own experienced hands. He was aware that he had been on\r\nthe whole very wisely governed since his abdication, but yet he was not\r\nsorry that the young conqueror should feel herself human; so that nobody\r\nexcept Mrs Chiley felt that mingled rage and disappointment with which\r\nBarbara Lake had hoped to inspire Lucilla\'s bosom; and Mrs Chiley, so to\r\nspeak, had nothing to do with it. As for Barbara herself, she returned\r\nhome in a state of mingled spite and exultation and disgust, which\r\nfilled her sister with amazement.\r\n\r\n"She is such an actor, you know," Barbara said; "she never will give in\r\nto let you know how she is feeling--not if she can help it; but for all\r\nthat she must have felt it. Nobody could help feeling it, though she\r\ncarried it off so well. I knew how it would be, as soon as I had on a\r\ndress that was fit to be seen."\r\n\r\n"What is it that she could not help feeling?" said Rose. "I suppose it\r\nis Lucilla you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to know what right she had to be kind to me," cried\r\nBarbara, all glowing in her sullen but excited beauty; "and invite me\r\nthere, and introduce me in her grand way, as if she was any better than\r\nI am! And then to look at all her India muslins; but I knew it would be\r\ndifferent as soon as I had a decent dress," said the contralto, rising\r\nup to contemplate herself in the little mirror over the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place in Mr Lake\'s little parlour, where Rose had\r\nbeen waiting for her sister, and where Barbara\'s white dress made an\r\nunusual radiance in the dim and partially-lighted room. Rose herself was\r\nall shrouded up in her morning dress, with her pretty round arms and\r\nshoulders lost to the common view. She had been amusing herself as she\r\nwaited by working at a corner of that great design which was to win the\r\nprize on a later occasion. Readers of this history who have studied the\r\nearlier chapters will remember that Rose\'s tastes in ornamentation were\r\nvery clearly defined for so young a person. Instead of losing herself in\r\nvague garlands of impossible flowers, the young artist clung with the\r\ntenacity of first love to the thistle leaf, which had been the\r\nfoundation of her early triumphs. Her mind was full of it even while she\r\nreceived and listened to Barbara; whether to treat it in a national\r\npoint of view, bringing in the rose and shamrock, which was a perfectly\r\nallowable proceeding, though perhaps not original--or whether she should\r\nyield to the "sweet feeling" which had been so conspicuous in her\r\nflounce, in the opinion of the Marlborough House gentlemen--or whether,\r\non the contrary, she should handle the subject in a boldly naturalistic\r\nway, and use her spikes with freedom,--was a question which occupied at\r\nthat moment all Rose\'s faculties. Even while she asked Barbara what the\r\nsubject was on which Lucilla might be supposed to be excited, she was\r\nwithin herself thinking out this difficult idea--all the more difficult,\r\nperhaps, considering the nature of the subject, since the design in this\r\ncase was not for a flounce, in which broad handling is practicable, but\r\nfor a veil.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would not talk in that foolish way," said Rose; "nobody need\r\nbe any better than you, as you say. To be sure, we don\'t live in Grange\r\nLane, nor keep a carriage; but I wish you would recollect that these are\r\nonly accidental circumstances. As for dress, I don\'t see that you\r\nrequire it; our position is so clearly defined; we are a family of----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, for goodness gracious sake, do be quiet with your family of\r\nartists!" cried Barbara. "Speak for yourself, if you please. I am not an\r\nartist, and never will be, I can tell you. There are better places to\r\nlive in than Grange Lane; and as for keeping a carriage, I would never\r\ncall a little bit of a brougham a carriage, if it was me. Lucilla made\r\nbelieve to take no notice, but she did not deceive me with that. She was\r\nas disappointed as ever she could be--I dare say now she\'s sitting\r\ncrying over it. I never would have cared one straw if I had not wanted\r\nto serve Lucilla out!" cried the contralto, with energy. She was still\r\nstanding before the glass pulling her black hair about into new\r\ncombinations, and studying the effect; and as for Rose, she too looked\r\nup, and, seeing her sister\'s face reflected in the glass, made the\r\ndiscovery that there was something like grimace in the countenance, and\r\npaused in the midst of her meditations with her pencil in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t put yourself out of drawing," said Rose; "I wish you would not do\r\nthat so often. When the facial angle is disturbed to that extent----But\r\nabout Lucilla, I think you are excessively ungrateful. Gratitude is not\r\na servile sentiment," said the little Preraphaelite, with a rising\r\ncolour. "It is a slavish sort of idea to think any one has done you an\r\ninjury by being kind to you. If that is the sort of thing you are going\r\nto talk of, I think you had better go to bed."\r\n\r\n"Then I will, and I shan\'t tell you anything," said Barbara\r\nangrily--"you are so poor-spirited. For my part, do you think I\'d ever\r\nhave gone to help Lucilla and sing for her, and all that sort of thing,\r\nif it had not been to better myself? Nor I wouldn\'t have thought of\r\n_him_ just at first, if it hadn\'t been to spite _her_. And I\'ve done it\r\ntoo. I\'d just like to look in at her room window and see what she\'s\r\nabout. I dare say she is crying her eyes out, for all her looking as if\r\nshe took no notice. I know better than to think she doesn\'t care. And,\r\nRose, he\'s such a dear," said Barbara, with a laugh of excitement. To be\r\nsure, what she wanted was to be Mrs Cavendish, and to have a handsome\r\nhouse and a great many nice dresses; but at the same time she was young,\r\nand Mr Cavendish was good-looking, and she was a little in love, in her\r\nway, as well.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to hear any more about it," said Rose, who was so much\r\nmoved as to forget even her design. "I can\'t think how it is you have no\r\nsense of honour, and you one of the Lakes. I would not be a traitor for\r\na dozen Mr Cavendishes!" cried Rose, in the force of her indignation.\r\n"He must be a cheat, since you are a traitor. If he was a true man he\r\nwould have found you out."\r\n\r\n"You had better be quiet, Rose," said Barbara; "you may be sure I shall\r\nnever do anything for you after we are married, if you talk like that;\r\nand then you\'ll be sorry enough."\r\n\r\n"After you are married! has he asked you to marry him?" cried Rose. She\r\npushed away her design with both her hands in the vehemence of her\r\nfeelings, and regarded her sister with eyes which blazed, but which were\r\ntotally different in their blazing from those which burned under\r\nBarbara\'s level eyebrows. It was too plain a question to have a plain\r\nanswer. Barbara only lighted her candle in reply, and smiled and shook\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t suppose I am going to answer after your insulting ways," she\r\nsaid, taking up her candle; and she swept out of the room in her white\r\ndress with a sense of pleasure in leaving this grand point unsettled. To\r\nbe sure, Mr Cavendish had not yet asked that important question; but\r\nthen the future was all before them, and the way clear. As for Rose, she\r\nclenched her little fists with a gesture that would have been too\r\nforcible for any one who was not an artist, and a member of a family of\r\nartists. "To think she should be one of us, and not to know what honour\r\nmeans," said Rose; "and as for this man, he must be a cheat himself, or\r\nhe would find her out."\r\n\r\nThis was how Mr Cavendish\'s defection from Lucilla took place; and at\r\nthe same time it is a satisfaction to know that the event was received\r\nby everybody very much as little Rose Lake received it. And as for Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, if Barbara could have had the malicious satisfaction of\r\nlooking in at the window, she would have been mortified to find that\r\nright-minded young woman sleeping the sleep of the just and innocent,\r\nand enjoying repose as profound and agreeable as if there had been no Mr\r\nCavendish in the world, not to speak of Carlingford;--which, to be sure,\r\nwas a result to be greatly attributed to Lucilla\'s perfect health, and\r\nentire satisfaction with herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XV_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis event was of far too much importance in the limited world of Grange\r\nLane to pass over without some of the many commentaries which were going\r\non upon the subject coming to the ears of Miss Marjoribanks, who was the\r\nperson principally concerned. As for the Doctor, as we have already\r\nsaid, he was so far lost to a sense of his paternal duties as to chuckle\r\na little within himself over the accident that had happened to Lucilla.\r\nIt had done her no harm, and Dr Marjoribanks permitted himself to regard\r\nthe occurrence in a professional point of view, as supplying a little\r\nalterative which he could scarcely administer himself; for it is well\r\nknown that physicians are seldom successful in the treatment of their\r\nown families. He was more jocose than usual at breakfast for some days\r\nfollowing, and, on the morning of the next Thursday, asked if everybody\r\nwas to come as usual, with a significance which did not escape the young\r\nmistress of the house.\r\n\r\n"You know best, papa," she said cheerfully, as she poured him out his\r\ncoffee: "if there is anybody who is ill and can\'t come, it must be your\r\nfault--but I did not hear that any one was ill."\r\n\r\n"Nor I," said the Doctor, with a quiet laugh; and he could not help\r\nthinking it would be good sport to see Cavendish come into the\r\ndrawing-room all by himself without any support, and make his appearance\r\nbefore Miss Marjoribanks, and do his best to be agreeable, with an awful\r\nconsciousness of his bad behaviour, and nobody sufficiently benevolent\r\nto help him out. The Doctor thought it would serve him right, but yet he\r\nwas not sufficiently irritated nor sufficiently sympathetic to lose any\r\nof the humour of the situation; and it was with a little zest, as for\r\nsomething especially piquant, that he looked forward to the evening. As\r\nfor Miss Marjoribanks, she too recognised the importance of the\r\noccasion. She resolved to produce that evening a new _plat_, which had\r\noccupied a corner of her busy mind for some time past. It was a crisis\r\nwhich called for a new step in advance. She sat down by the window after\r\nbreakfast with various novel combinations floating in her creative\r\nbrain; and while she was revolving these ideas in her mind, Nancy came\r\nin with more than her usual briskness. It is true that Lucilla had her\r\nhousehold well in hand, and possessed the faculty of government to a\r\nremarkable extent; but still, under the best of circumstances, it was a\r\nserious business to propose a new dish to Nancy. Dr Marjoribanks\'s\r\nfactotum was a woman of genius in her way, and by no means unenlightened\r\nor an enemy of progress; but then she had a weakness common to many\r\npersons of superior intelligence and decided character. When there was\r\nanything new to be introduced, Nancy liked to be herself the godmother\r\nof the interesting novelty; for, to be sure, it was her place, and Miss\r\nLucilla, though she was very clever, was not to be expected to\r\nunderstand what came in best with the other dishes for a dinner. "I\r\nain\'t one as goes just upon fish and flesh and fowl, like some as call\r\nthemselves cooks," Nancy said. "If I have a failing, it\'s for things as\r\nsuits. When it\'s brown, make it brown, and don\'t be mean about the\r\ngravy-beef--that\'s my principle; and when it ain\'t brown, mind what\r\nyou\'re a-doing of--and don\'t go and throw a heap of entrys and things at\r\na gentleman\'s head without no \'armony. I always says to Miss Lucilla as\r\n\'armony\'s the thing; and when I\'ve set it all straight in my mind, I\r\nain\'t one as likes to be put out," Nancy would add, with a gleam in her\r\neye which betokened mischief. Miss Marjoribanks was much too sensible\r\nnot to be aware of this peculiarity; and accordingly she cleared her\r\nthroat with something as near nervousness as was possible to Lucilla\r\nbefore she opened her lips to propose the innovation. Miss Marjoribanks,\r\nas a general rule, did not show much nervousness in her dealings with\r\nher prime minister, any more than in her demeanour towards the less\r\nimportant members of society; and consequently Nancy remarked the\r\nmomentary timidity, and a flash of sympathy and indignation took the\r\nplace of her usual impulse of defiance.\r\n\r\n"I heard as master said, there was some gentleman as wasn\'t a-coming,"\r\nsaid Nancy. "Not as one makes no difference in a dinner; but I allays\r\nlikes to know. I don\'t like no waste, for my part. I ain\'t one as\r\ncalk\'lates too close, but if there\'s one thing as I hates like poison,\r\nit\'s waste. I said as I would ask, for Thomas ain\'t as correct as could\r\nbe wished. Is it one less than usual, Miss Lucilla?" said Nancy; and it\r\nwas Lucilla\'s fault if she did not understand the profound and indignant\r\nsympathy in Nancy\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; it is just the usual number," said Miss Marjoribanks. "It was\r\nonly a joke of papa\'s--they are all just as usual----" And here Lucilla\r\npaused. She was thinking of the dish she wanted, but Nancy thought she\r\nwas thinking of Mr Cavendish, who had treated her so badly. She studied\r\nthe countenance of her young mistress with the interest of a woman who\r\nhas had her experiences, and knows how little _They_ are to be depended\r\nupon. Nancy murmured "Poor dear!" under her breath, almost without\r\nknowing it, and then a brilliant inspiration came to her mind. Few\r\npeople have the gift of interfering successfully in such cases, but then\r\nto offer consolation is a Christian duty, especially when one has the\r\nconfidence that to give consolation is in one\'s power.\r\n\r\n"Miss Lucilla, I would say as you\'ve been doing too much, if anybody was\r\nto ask me," said Nancy, moved by this generous impulse--"all them\r\npractisings and things. They\'re well enough for young ladies as ain\'t\r\ngot nothing else to do; but you as has such a deal in your hands----If\r\nthere was any little thing as you could fancy for dinner," said Nancy,\r\nin her most bland accents; "I\'ve set it all down as I thought would be\r\nnicest, allays if you approves, Miss Lucilla; but if there was any\r\nlittle thing as you could fancy----" "Poor dear, it\'s all as we can do,"\r\nshe murmured to herself. The faithless could not be brought back again;\r\nbut Ariadne might at least have any little thing she could fancy for\r\ndinner, which, indeed, is a very general treatment of such a case on the\r\npart of perplexed sympathisers who do not know what to say.\r\n\r\nLucilla was so excited for the moment by this unusual evidence of her\r\nown good fortune, that she had almost spoiled all by sitting straight up\r\nand entering with her usual energy into the discussion--but instinct\r\nsaved Miss Marjoribanks from this mistake. She lost no time in taking\r\nadvantage of the opportunity, and instead of having a fight with Nancy,\r\nand getting a reluctant consent, and still more reluctant execution of\r\nthe novelty, Lucilla felt that she was doing that excellent woman a\r\nfavour by naming her new dish. Nancy approved so thoroughly as to be\r\nenthusiastic. "I always said as she had a deal of sense," she said\r\nafterwards triumphantly. "There ain\'t one young lady in a hundred as\r\nknows what\'s good for her, like Miss Lucilla." But notwithstanding this\r\nfervent declaration of approval, Nancy, softened as she was, could not\r\nbut linger, when all was concluded, to give a little advice.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t worrit myself with all them practisings, Miss Lucilla, if I\r\nwas you," said her faithful retainer. "They\'re a deal too much for you.\r\nI\'ve took the liberty, when all was cleaned up, to go on the stair and\r\nlisten a bit, and there ain\'t nothing to equal it when you\'re a-singing\r\nby yourself. I don\'t think nothing of them duets--and as for that\r\nbold-faced brazen thing----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Nancy, hush!" said Lucilla; "Miss Lake has a beautiful voice. If\r\nshe does not look quite like a lady, it is not her fault, poor thing.\r\nShe has no mamma to set her right, you know. She is the best assistant I\r\nhave--she and Mr Cavendish," said Lucilla sweetly; and she gave Nancy a\r\nlook which moved the faithful servant almost to tears, though she was\r\nnot addicted to that weakness. Nancy retired with the most enthusiastic\r\ndetermination to exert herself to the utmost for the preparation of the\r\nlittle dish which Lucilla fancied. "But I wouldn\'t worrit about them\r\nduets," she said again, as she left the room. "I wouldn\'t, not if I was\r\nyou, Miss Lucilla, asking pardon for the liberty: as for having no\r\nmamma, you have no mamma yourself, and you the young lady as is most\r\nthought upon in Carlingford, and as different from that brazen-faced\r\nthing, with her red cheeks----"\r\n\r\n"Hush, oh hush, Nancy," Lucilla said, as she sank back in her chair; but\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, after all, was only human, and she was not so\r\ndistressed by these unpolished epithets as she might or perhaps ought to\r\nhave been. "Poor Barbara! I wish she could only look a little bit like a\r\nlady," she said to herself; and so proceeded with her preparations for\r\nthe evening. She had all her plans matured, and she felt quite\r\ncomfortable about that evening which all her friends were thinking would\r\nbe rather trying for Lucilla. To tell the truth, when a thing became\r\nrather trying, Lucilla\'s spirits rose. Mr Cavendish\'s desertion was,\r\nperhaps, on the whole, more than compensated for by the exhilaration of\r\na difficulty to be encountered. She too began to forecast, like her\r\nfather, the possibilities of the evening, and to think of Mr Cavendish\r\ncoming in to dinner when there was nobody to support him, and not even a\r\ncrowd of people to retire among. Would he run the risk of coming, under\r\nthe circumstances? or, if he came, would he prostrate himself as he had\r\ndone on a previous occasion, and return to his allegiance? This question\r\nroused Lucilla to a degree of energy unusual even to her who was always\r\nenergetic. It was then that the brilliant idea struck her of adjourning\r\nto the garden in the evening--a practice which was received with such\r\nenthusiasm in Carlingford, where the gardens were so pretty. She put on\r\nher hat directly and went downstairs, and called the gardener to consult\r\nhim about it; and it was thus that she was employed when Mrs Chiley rang\r\nthe bell at the garden gate. If it had been anybody else in Carlingford,\r\nLucilla would have led her back again to the house, and said nothing\r\nabout the subject of her conference with the gardener; for it is always\r\nbest, as all judicious persons are aware, not to forestall these little\r\narrangements which make so agreeable a surprise at the moment; but then\r\nMrs Chiley was Miss Marjoribanks\'s special confidant. The old lady had\r\nher face full of business that bright morning. She listened to what her\r\nyoung friend proposed, but without hearing it, and said. "Oh, yes, my\r\ndear, I am sure it will be charming," without the very least notion what\r\nit was she applauded. "Let us go in and sit down a moment, for I have\r\nsomething to say to you, Lucilla," Mrs Chiley said; and when they had\r\nreached the drawing-room and shut the door, the Colonel\'s wife gave her\r\nfavourite a kiss, and looked anxiously in her face. "You have not been\r\nto see me since Monday," said Mrs Chiley. "I am sure you are not well,\r\nor you could not have stayed away so long; but if you did not feel equal\r\nto going out, why did you not send for me, Lucilla, my poor dear?"\r\nThough Miss Marjoribanks\'s thoughts at that moment were full of the\r\ngarden, and not in the least occupied with those more troublesome\r\nmatters which procured for her Mrs Chiley\'s sympathy, she placed the\r\nkind old lady in the most easy chair, and sat down by her, as Mrs Chiley\r\nliked to see a young creature do. Lucilla\'s affairs were too important\r\nto be trusted to a young _confidante_ of her own age; but even a person\r\nof acknowledged genius like Miss Marjoribanks is the better of some one\r\nto whom she can open up her breast.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley!" said Lucilla, "I am quite well, and I meant to have\r\ncome to see you to-day."\r\n\r\n"My poor dear!" said Mrs Chiley again. "You say you are quite well for\r\nyou have such a spirit; but I can see what you have been going through.\r\nI don\'t understand how you can keep on, and do so much. But it was not\r\n_that_ that brought me here. There is some one coming to Carlingford\r\nthat I want you to meet, Lucilla. He is a relation of Mary Chiley\'s\r\nhusband, and as she does not get on very well with them, you know, I\r\nthink it is our duty to be civil. And they say he is a very nice man;\r\nand young--enough," said Mrs Chiley, with a look of some anxiety,\r\npausing to see the effect produced upon Lucilla by her words.\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks had not, as she once confessed, a very vivid sense of\r\nhumour, but she laughed a little, in spite of herself, at the old lady\'s\r\nanxious look. "Don\'t be sorry for me," she said; "I told you that\r\nfortunately my affections were not engaged. I don\'t want any new\r\ngentleman introduced to me. If _that_ was what I was thinking of, I\r\nnever need have come home," Lucilla said, with a little dignity; and\r\nyet, to be sure, she was naturally curious to know who the new man, who\r\nwas very nice and young--enough, could be; for such apparitions were not\r\ntoo plentiful in Carlingford; and it did not seem in reason that an\r\nindividual of this interesting description could come out of Colonel\r\nChiley\'s house.\r\n\r\n"My dear, he is a clergyman," said Mrs Chiley, putting her hand on Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s arm, and speaking in a half whisper; "and you know a nice\r\nclergyman is always nice, and you need not think of him as a young man\r\nunless you like. He has a nice property, and he is Rector of Basing,\r\nwhich is a very good living, and Archdeacon of Stanmore. He has come\r\nhere to hold a visitation, you know; and they say that if Carlingford\r\nwas made into a bishopric, he is almost sure to be the first bishop; and\r\nyou know a bishop, or even an archdeacon, has a very nice position. I\r\nwant to be civil to him for Mary Chiley\'s sake, who is not on such terms\r\nas we could wish with her husband\'s friends; and then I suppose he will\r\nhave to be a great deal in Carlingford, and I should like him to form a\r\ngood impression. I want you and your dear good papa to come and meet\r\nhim; and then after that--but one thing is enough at a time," the old\r\nlady said, breaking off with a nod and a smile. She too had brought her\r\nbit of consolation to Lucilla; and it was a kind of consolation which,\r\nwhen administered at the right moment, is sometimes of sovereign\r\nefficacy, as Mrs Chiley was aware.\r\n\r\n"I am sure papa will be very happy," said Lucilla; "and, indeed, if you\r\nlike, I shall be very glad to ask him here. If he is a friend of yours,\r\nthat is quite enough for me. It is very nice to know a nice clergyman;\r\nbut as for being a young man, I can\'t see how that matters. If I had\r\nbeen thinking of _that_, I need never--but I should think papa would\r\nlike to meet him; and you know it is the object of my life to please\r\npapa."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my poor dear," said the Colonel\'s wife, "and he would be\r\nhard-hearted indeed if he was not pleased; but still we must consider\r\nyou a little, Lucilla. You do everything for other people, and you never\r\nthink of yourself. But I like to see you with nice people round you, for\r\nmy part," Mrs Chiley added--"really nice people, and not these\r\npoor-spirited, ungrateful----"\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush!" said Lucilla; "I don\'t know such nice people anywhere as\r\nthere are in Carlingford. Some people are never pleased with their\r\nneighbours, but I always get on so well with everybody. It is my good\r\nluck, you know; and so long as I have you, dear Mrs Chiley----"\r\n\r\n"Ah, Lucilla!" said the old lady, "that is very kind of you--and you\r\ncould not have anybody that is fonder of you than I am; but still I am\r\nan old woman, old enough to be your grandmother, my dear--and we have\r\nyour future interests to think of. As for all the vexations you have\r\nhad, I think I could find it in my heart to turn that ungrateful\r\ncreature to the door. Don\'t let her come here any more. I like your\r\nvoice a great deal better when you are singing by yourself--and I am\r\nsure the Archdeacon would be of my opinion," said Mrs Chiley, with a\r\nconfidence which was beautiful to behold. It was true she had not seen\r\nher new hero as yet, but that only left her so much more free to take\r\nthe good of him and his probable sentiments; for to persons of frank and\r\nsimple imagination a very little foundation of fact is enough to build\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley, it is so nice of you to be vexed," said Lucilla, who\r\nthought it as well not to enter into any further argument. "Papa will be\r\ndelighted, I am sure, and I can come in the evening. The Colonel likes\r\nto have only six people, and you will be three to start with, so there\r\ncan\'t be any room for me at dinner; and you know I don\'t mind about\r\ndinner. I shall come in the evening and make tea for you--and if you\r\nthink he would like to come next Thursday----" said Lucilla graciously.\r\nThis was how it was eventually settled. Mrs Chiley went home again\r\nthrough Grange Lane in the sunshine, with that little old-womanish\r\nhobble which Mrs Woodburn executed with such precision, perfectly\r\nsatisfied with her success, and indulging herself in some pleasant\r\nvisions. To be sure, a nice clergyman is always nice to know, even\r\nthough nothing more was to come of it; and a new man in the field of\r\nsuch distinguished pretensions, would be Lucilla\'s best defence against\r\nany sort of mortification. As for Miss Marjoribanks herself, she was\r\nthinking a great deal more of the new details for the approaching\r\nevening than of anything else more distant, and consequently less\r\nimportant; but, on the whole, she was by no means displeased to hear of\r\nthe Archdeacon. In such a work as hers, a skilful leader is always on\r\nthe outlook for auxiliaries; and there are circumstances in which a nice\r\nclergyman is almost as useful to the lady of the house as a man who can\r\nflirt. To be sure, now and then there occurs a rare example in which\r\nboth these qualities are united in one person; but even in the most\r\nmodest point of view, if he was not stupid or obstinately Low-Church,\r\nthere was nothing to despise in the apparition of the Archdeacon thus\r\nsuddenly blown to her very door. While she had the seats placed in the\r\ngarden (not too visibly, but shrouded among the shrubs and round the\r\ntrunks of the trees), and chose the spot for a little illumination,\r\nwhich was not to be universal, like a tea-garden, but concentrated in\r\none spot under the big lime-tree, Lucilla permitted herself to speculate\r\na little about this unknown hero. She did not so much ask herself if he\r\nwould be dark or fair, according to the usage of young ladies, as\r\nwhether he would be High or Broad. But, however, that question, like\r\nvarious others, was still hidden in the surrounding darkness.\r\n\r\nThis was how Mrs Chiley did her best to cheer up Lucilla in the\r\ndiscouragement from which she supposed her young friend to be suffering.\r\nIt was perhaps a loftier expedient in one way than Nancy\'s desire that\r\nshe should have something she would fancy for dinner; but then there\r\ncould not be any doubt as to the kindness which prompted both\r\nsuggestions; and, after all, it is not what people do for you, but the\r\nspirit in which they do it, which should be taken into consideration, as\r\nLucilla most justly observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XVI_\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening was one which all the people in Grange Lane had unanimously\r\nconcluded would be rather hard upon Miss Marjoribanks. To be sure, when\r\na crisis arrives there is always a certain excitement which keeps one\r\nup; but afterwards, when the excitement is over, then is the time when\r\nit becomes really trying. There was naturally, under these\r\ncircumstances, a larger assemblage than usual to watch the progress of\r\nthe little drama, and how Lucilla would behave; for, after all, society\r\nwould be excessively tame if it were not for these personal\r\ncomplications, which are always arising, and which are so much better\r\nthan a play. As for the Doctor himself, the portion of the evening\'s\r\nentertainment which particularly amused him was that which preceded all\r\nthe rest--the reception given by Lucilla to her guests at dinner, and\r\nespecially to the culprit, who came in quite alone, and found nobody to\r\nstand up for him. Mr Cavendish, who felt to the full the difficulty of\r\nhis position, and, to tell the truth, was a little ashamed of himself,\r\ncame late, in order to abridge his trial as much as possible; but\r\nLucilla\'s habitual good-fortune was not confined only to her own\r\nnecessities, but seemed to involve everybody opposed to her in a\r\nceaseless ill-luck, which was very edifying to the spectators. Mr\r\nCavendish was so late that the other guests had formed into groups round\r\nthe room, leaving a great open space and avenue of approach to the lady\r\nof the house in the middle; and the audience, thus arranged, was very\r\nimpatient and unfavourable to the lingerer who kept them waiting for\r\ntheir dinner. When he came in at last, instead of doing anything to help\r\nhim, everybody ceased talking and looked on in stern silence as the\r\nwretched culprit walked all the length of the room up to Lucilla through\r\nthe unoccupied space which exposed him so unmercifully on every side.\r\nThey all stopped in the middle of what they were saying, and fixed stony\r\neyes on him, as the dead sailors did on the Ancient Mariner. He had a\r\nvery good spirit, but still there are circumstances which take the\r\ncourage out of a man. To be sure, Miss Marjoribanks, when he reached her\r\nat last, received Mr Cavendish with the utmost grace and cordiality, but\r\nit is easy to imagine what must have been the feelings of the\r\nunfortunate hero. The Balaclava charge itself, in the face of all the\r\nguns, could have been nothing to the sensation of walking through that\r\nhorrible naked space, through a crowd of reproachful men who were\r\nwaiting for dinner; and it was only after it was all over, and Mr\r\nCavendish had safely arrived at Miss Marjoribanks\'s side, and was being\r\nset at his ease, poor wretch, by her incomparable sweetness, that the\r\nDoctor, with a certain grim smile on his countenance, came and shook\r\nhands with his unfortunate guest.\r\n\r\n"You are late," Dr Marjoribanks said, taking out the great watch by\r\nwhich all the pulses of Grange Lane considered it their duty to keep\r\ntime, and which marked five minutes after seven, as everybody could see.\r\nIt was ten minutes after seven by the pretty French clock on the\r\nmantelpiece, and at least twenty by the lowering countenances of Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s guests. Mr Cavendish made the best of his unhappy\r\nposition, and threw himself upon Lucilla\'s charity, who was the only one\r\nwho had any compassion upon him; for to see Mrs Chiley\'s forbidding\r\ncountenance no one could have believed that she had ever called him "my\r\ndear." "Dinner is on the table, papa," Miss Marjoribanks said, with a\r\nlittle reassuring nod to the culprit who had made her his refuge; and\r\nshe got up and shook out her white draperies with a charitable commotion\r\nfor which her faithless admirer blessed her in his heart.\r\n\r\nBut the place at her left hand was not left vacant for Mr Cavendish; he\r\nhad not the spirit to claim it, even had he had the time; and the\r\nconsequence was that he found himself next to his brother-in-law at\r\ntable, which was indeed a hard fate. As for Lucilla, she was quite\r\nradiant when the famous dish made its appearance which Nancy had\r\nelaborated to please her, and told the story of its introduction to her\r\ntwo next neighbours, in a half whisper, to their immense amusement.\r\n"When the servants are gone I will tell you what we are laughing at,"\r\nshe breathed across the table to Mrs Chiley, who was "more than\r\ndelighted," as she said, to see her dear Lucilla keeping up so well; and\r\nwhen the dessert was put upon the table, and Thomas had finally\r\ndisappeared, Miss Marjoribanks kept her promise. "I could not think how\r\nI was going to get her to consent," Lucilla said, "but you know she\r\nthought I was in low spirits, the dear old soul, and that it would be a\r\ncomfort to me." Though there was often a great deal of fun at Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s table, nothing was ever heard there to compare with the\r\nlaughter that greeted Lucilla\'s narrative. Everybody was so entirely\r\naware of the supposed cause of the low spirits, and indeed was so\r\nconscious of having speculated, like Nancy, upon Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\nprobable demeanour at this trying moment, that the laughter was not mere\r\nlaughter, but conveyed, at the same time a confession of guilt and a\r\nstorm of applause and admiration. As for Mr Cavendish, it was alarming\r\nto look at him in the terrible paroxysm of confusion and shame which he\r\ntried to shield under the universal amusement. Miss Marjoribanks left\r\nthe dining-room that evening with the soothing conviction that she had\r\nadministered punishment of the most annihilating kind, without for a\r\nmoment diverging from the perfect sweetness and amiability with which it\r\nwas her duty to treat all her father\'s guests. It was so complete and\r\nperfect that there was not another word to be said either on one side or\r\nthe other; and yet Lucilla had not in the least committed herself, or\r\ncondescended from her maiden dignity. As for Dr Marjoribanks, if he had\r\nchuckled over it before, in anticipation, it may be supposed how he\r\nenjoyed now this perfect vindication of his daughter\'s capacity for\r\ntaking care of herself. The sound of the victory was even heard\r\nupstairs, where the young ladies at the open windows were asking each\r\nother, with a little envy, what the men could be laughing at. There was,\r\nas we have said, a larger assembly than usual that night. For one thing,\r\nit was moonlight, and all the people from the country were there; and\r\nthen public curiosity was profoundly concerned as to how Lucilla was to\r\nconduct herself on so trying an occasion. The laughter even jarred on\r\nthe sensitive feelings of some people who thought, where a young girl\'s\r\nhappiness was concerned, that it was too serious a matter to be laughed\r\nat; but then Miss Marjoribanks was not a person who could be classed\r\nwith ordinary young girls, in the general acceptation of the word.\r\n\r\nIt was when things were at this crisis, and all eyes were directed to\r\nLucilla, and a certain expectation was diffused through the company,\r\nthat Miss Marjoribanks made that proposal of adjourning to the garden,\r\nwhich was received with so much applause. Lucilla\'s instinct, or rather\r\nher genius, had warned her that something out of the ordinary course of\r\nproceedings would be expected from her on that special occasion. She\r\ncould not get up and make a speech to her excited and curious audience,\r\nneither could she, apropos of nothing, tell over again the story which\r\nhad been received with such applause downstairs; and yet something was\r\nwanting. The ordinary routine did not satisfy Lucilla\'s constituency,\r\nwho had come with the laudable intention of observing her on a trying\r\noccasion, and watching how she got through it. "The air is so delicious\r\nto-night that I had some seats placed in the garden," Miss Marjoribanks\r\nsaid, "and if you all like we will sing to you up here, and give you as\r\nmuch music as ever you please. You know I never would consent to be too\r\nmusical when everybody was in one room. It does not matter so much, when\r\nthere are a suite; but then papa, you know, is only a professional man,\r\nand I have but one drawing-room," said Lucilla, with sweet humility. It\r\nwas Lady Richmond to whom she was addressing herself at the moment, who\r\nwas a lady who liked to be the great lady of the party. "It is only in\r\nsummer that we can be a little like you fine people, who have as many\r\nrooms as you please. When you are at a little distance we will sing to\r\nyou all the evening, if you like."\r\n\r\n"But, my dear, are you sure you feel able for so much exertion?" said\r\nLady Richmond, who was one of those people who did not think a young\r\ngirl\'s happiness a thing to be trifled with; and she looked with what\r\nshe described afterwards as a very searching expression in Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Dear Lady Richmond, I hope I am always able for my duty," said that\r\ngentle martyr. "Papa would be wretched if he did not think we were all\r\nenjoying ourselves; and you know it is the object of my life to be a\r\ncomfort to papa."\r\n\r\nThis was what the searching expression in Lady Richmond\'s eyes elicited\r\nfrom Lucilla. The sentiment was perhaps a little different from that\r\nwhich she had conveyed to her delighted auditors in the dining-room, but\r\nat the same time it was equally true; for everybody in Carlingford was\r\naware of the grand object of Miss Marjoribanks\'s existence. Lady\r\nRichmond went down to the garden at the head of a bevy of ladies, and\r\nseated herself under the drawing-room windows, and placed a chair beside\r\nher own for Mrs Chiley. "I am afraid that dear girl is keeping up too\r\nwell," Lady Richmond said; "I never saw such fortitude. All the young\r\npeople say she does not feel it; but as soon as I fixed my eyes on her I\r\nsaw the difference. You can always find out what a girl\'s feelings are\r\nwhen you look into her eyes."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs Chiley, with a little doubt, for she had been shaken in\r\nher convictions by the universal laughter, though she was a little\r\nmystified herself by Lucilla\'s anecdote; and then she had never been\r\ngifted with eyes like Lady Richmond\'s, which looked people through and\r\nthrough. "She goes through a great deal, and it never seems to do her\r\nany harm," the old lady said, with a little hesitation. "It is such a\r\ncomfort that she has a good constitution, especially as her mother was\r\nso delicate; and then Lucilla has such a spirit----"\r\n\r\n"But one may try a good constitution too far," said Lady Richmond; "and\r\nI am certain she is full of feeling. It is sure to come out when she\r\nsings, and that is why I came to this seat. I should not like to lose a\r\nnote. And do tell me who is that horrid flirting, disagreeable girl,"\r\nadded the county lady, drawing her chair a little closer. By this time\r\nthe garden was full of pretty figures and pleasant voices, and under the\r\nlime-tree there was a glimmer of yellow light from the lamps, and on the\r\nother side the moon was coming up steady like a ball of silver over the\r\ndark outlines of Carlingford; and even the two voices which swelled\r\nforth upstairs in the fullest accord, betraying nothing of the personal\r\nsentiments of their owners, were not more agreeable to hear than the\r\nrustle and murmur of sound which rose all over Dr Marjoribanks\'s smooth\r\nlawn and pretty shrubbery. Here and there a group of the older people\r\nsat, like Lady Richmond and Mrs Chiley, listening with all their might;\r\nand all about them were clusters of girls and their natural attendants,\r\narrested in their progress, and standing still breathless, "just for\r\nthis bar," as young people pause in their walks and talks to listen to a\r\nchance nightingale. And, to be sure, whenever anybody was tired of the\r\nmusic, there were quantities of corners to retire into, not to speak of\r\nthat bright spot full of yellow light under the lime-tree.\r\n\r\n"Nobody but Lucilla ever could have thought of anything so delicious,"\r\nwas what everybody said. And then the two singers upstairs gave so much\r\nscope to curiosity. "Do you think they are all by themselves?" Lydia\r\nBrown was heard to ask, with a little natural anxiety; and the livelier\r\nimaginations among the party set to work at once to invent impossible\r\ntortures which the soprano might inflict on the contralto. But, to tell\r\nthe truth, the two singers were by no means alone. Half the gentlemen of\r\nthe dinner-party, who were past the sentimental age, and did not care\r\nabout moonlight, had gone upstairs according to their use and wont, and\r\nremained there, finding, to their great satisfaction, room to move\r\nabout, and comfortable chairs to sit down in. They sat and chatted in\r\nthe corners in great content and good-humour, while Lucilla and Barbara\r\nexecuted the most charming duets. Now and then old Colonel Chiley paused\r\nto put his two hands softly together and cry "Brava!" but on the whole\r\nthe gentlemen were not much disturbed by the music. And then there were\r\na few ladies, who were subject to neuralgia, or apt to take bad colds in\r\nthe head, who preferred being upstairs. So that if Lucilla had meant to\r\npinch or maltreat her rival, circumstances would have made it\r\nimpossible. Miss Marjoribanks did nothing to Barbara, except incite her\r\nto sing her very best; but no doubt she was the means of inflicting\r\nconsiderable pain on Mr Cavendish, who stood at a little distance, and\r\nlooked and listened to both, and perhaps had inward doubts as to the\r\nwisdom of his choice. Such was the arrangement of the personages of the\r\nsocial drama, and it was in this way that everybody was occupied, when\r\nan event occurred which at a later period awoke much excitement in\r\nCarlingford, and had no small influence upon the future fate of some of\r\nthe individuals whose history is here recorded.\r\n\r\nEverything was as calm and cheerful and agreeable as if Carlingford had\r\nbeen a social paradise, and Miss Marjoribanks\'s drawing-room the seventh\r\nheaven of terrestrial harmony. The sky itself was not more peaceful, nor\r\ngave less indication of any tempest than did the tranquil atmosphere\r\nbelow, where all the people knew each other, and everybody was friendly.\r\nLucilla had just risen from the piano, and there was a little pause, in\r\nwhich cheers were audible from the garden, and Colonel Chiley, in the\r\nmidst of his conversation, patted his two hands together; and it was\r\njust at that moment that the drawing-room door opened, and Thomas came\r\nin, followed by a gentleman. The gentleman was a stranger, whom Miss\r\nMarjoribanks had never seen before, and she made a step forward, as was\r\nher duty as mistress of the house. But when she had made that one step,\r\nLucilla suddenly stood still, arrested by something more urgent than the\r\narrival of a stranger. Mr Cavendish, too, had been standing with his\r\nface to the door, and had seen the new arrival. He was directly in front\r\nof Lucilla, so near her that he could not move without attracting her\r\nattention. When Miss Marjoribanks took that step in advance, Mr\r\nCavendish, as if by the same impulse, suddenly, and without saying a\r\nword, turned right round like a man who had seen something terrible, at\r\nwhich he dared not take a second look. He was too much absorbed at that\r\nmoment in his own feelings to know that he was betraying himself to\r\nLucilla, or even to be conscious that she was near him. His face was\r\nmore than pale; it had a green ghastly look, as of a face from which all\r\nthe blood had suddenly been withdrawn to reinforce the vital centre in\r\nsome failing of nature. His under-lip hung down, and two hollows which\r\nhad never been seen there before appeared in his cheeks. Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was so taken by surprise that she stood still, thinking no\r\nmore of her duties, but regarding in utter dismay and amazement the look\r\nof dead stupefied terror which thus appeared so unexpectedly before her.\r\nMr Cavendish had turned right round, turning his back upon a lady to\r\nwhom he had been talking the minute before. But he was as unconscious of\r\ndoing so as of the fact that he had presented the spectacle of his\r\nmiserable surprise and alarm in the most striking way to the one woman\r\npresent who had a right to entertain a certain grudge against him.\r\n\r\nDuring this moment of unusual inaction on Lucilla\'s part, the stranger\r\nhad been led up to Colonel Chiley, and had shaken hands with him, and\r\nwas entering into some explanations which Miss Marjoribanks divined with\r\nher usual quick intelligence; and then the old Colonel roused himself up\r\nfrom his easy-chair, and leaned over to speak to Dr Marjoribanks, and\r\nshowed symptoms of approaching the lady of the house. All these\r\nmovements Lucilla followed breathlessly, with a strange consciousness\r\nthat only her presence of mind stood between her faithless suitor and a\r\nreal danger. And as if to prove the difference, Barbara Lake chose that\r\nmoment of all others to show her power, and made an appeal to Mr\r\nCavendish and his taste in music, to which the unhappy man made no\r\nresponse. Miss Marjoribanks saw there was no time to lose. With a\r\nfearless hand she threw down a great portfolio of music which happened\r\nto be close to her, just at his feet, making a merciful disturbance. And\r\nthen she turned and made her curtsey, and received the homage of Mr\r\nArchdeacon Beverley, who had arrived a day before he was expected, and\r\nhad come to look after his host, since his host had not been at home to\r\nreceive him.\r\n\r\n"But you have broken your music-stand or something, Lucilla," said the\r\nColonel.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; it is only a portfolio. I can\'t think what could make me so\r\nawkward," said Miss Marjoribanks; "I suppose it was seeing some one come\r\nin whom I didn\'t know." And then the old gentleman, as was his duty,\r\npaid the Archdeacon a compliment on having made such a commotion. "We\r\nused to have the best of it in our day," said the old soldier; "but now\r\nyou churchmen are the men." Miss Marjoribanks heard the door open again\r\nbefore this little speech was finished. It was Mr Cavendish, who was\r\ngoing out with a long step, as if he with difficulty kept himself from\r\nrunning; and he never came back again to say good-night, or made any\r\nfurther appearance either out of doors or indoors. It is true that the\r\nArchdeacon made himself very agreeable, but then one man never quite\r\nmakes up for another. Miss Marjoribanks said nothing about it, not even\r\nwhen Mrs Woodburn came up to her with a scared face, and in full\r\npossession of her own identity, which of itself was an extraordinary\r\nfact, and proved that something had happened; but it would be vain to\r\nsay that Lucilla was not much excited by this sudden gleam of mystery.\r\nIt gave the Archdeacon an extraordinary and altogether unexpected\r\nattraction; and as for Mr Cavendish, it was utterly inconceivable that a\r\nman in society, whom everybody knew about, should give way to such a\r\npanic. The question was, What did it mean?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XVII_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Mr Archdeacon Beverley in Carlingford was, for many\r\nreasons, an event of importance to the town, and especially to society,\r\nwhich was concerned in anything that drew new and pleasant people to\r\nGrange Lane. For one thing, it occurred at the time when that first\r\nproposal of elevating Carlingford into a bishopric, in order to relieve\r\nthe present bishop of the district of a part of his immense diocese, had\r\njust been mooted; and supposing this conception to be ever carried out,\r\nnobody could have been more eligible as first bishop than the\r\nArchdeacon, who was in the prime of life, and a very successful\r\nclergyman. And then, not to speak of anything so important, his presence\r\nwas a great attraction to the country clergy, especially as he had come\r\nto hold a visitation. Notwithstanding all this, it is impossible to deny\r\nthat Mrs Chiley, his hostess, and even Miss Marjoribanks herself,\r\nregarded the manner of his first appearance with a certain displeasure.\r\nIf he had only had the good sense to stay at home, and not come to seek\r\nhis entertainers! To be sure it is awkward to arrive at a house and find\r\nthat everybody is out; but still, as Mrs Chiley justly observed, the\r\nArchdeacon was not a baby, and he might have known better. "Coming to\r\nyou the very first night, and almost in his travelling things, to take\r\nthe cream off everything," the old lady said, with tears of vexation in\r\nher eyes; "and after that, what have we to show him in Carlingford,\r\nLucilla?" As for Miss Marjoribanks, she was annoyed, but she knew the\r\nwealth of her own resources, and she was not in despair, like her old\r\nfriend. "They never know any better," she said sympathetically. "Dear\r\nMrs Chiley, there was nothing else to be expected; but, at the same\r\ntime, I don\'t think things are so very bad," said Lucilla; for she had\r\nnaturally a confidence in herself of which even Mrs Chiley\'s admiring\r\nfaith fell short.\r\n\r\nThe Archdeacon himself took it quite cheerfully, as if it was the most\r\nnatural thing in the world. "I have no doubt it was a very pleasant\r\nparty, if one could have got the key-note," he said, in his\r\nBroad-Church way, as if there was nothing more to be said on the\r\nsubject, and Lucilla\'s Thursday was the merest ordinary assembly. For\r\nthere could be no doubt that he was Broad-Church, even though his\r\nantecedents had not proclaimed the fact. He had a way of talking on many\r\nsubjects which alarmed his hostess. It was not that there was anything\r\nobjectionable in what he said--for, to be sure, a clergyman and an\r\narchdeacon may say a great many things that ordinary people would not\r\nlike to venture on,--but still it was impossible to tell what it might\r\nlead to; for it is not everybody who knows when to stop, as Mr Beverley\r\nin his position might be expected to do. It was the custom of good\r\nsociety in Carlingford to give a respectful assent, for example, to Mr\r\nBury\'s extreme Low-Churchism--as if it were profane, as it certainly was\r\nnot respectable, to differ from the Rector--and to give him as wide a\r\nfield as possible for his missionary operations by keeping out of the\r\nway. But Mr Beverley had not the least regard for respectability, nor\r\nthat respect for religion which consists in keeping as clear of it as\r\npossible; and the way in which he spoke of Mr Bury\'s views wounded some\r\npeople\'s feelings. Altogether, he was, as Mrs Chiley said, an anxious\r\nperson to have in the house; for he just as often agreed with the\r\ngentlemen in their loose ways of thinking, as with the more correct\r\nopinions by which the wives and mothers who had charge of Their morality\r\nstrove hard to keep them in the right way; and that was the reverse of\r\nwhat one naturally expected from a clergyman. He was very nice, and had\r\na nice position; and, under all the circumstances, it was not only a\r\nduty to pay attention to him, but a duty from which results of a most\r\nagreeable character might spring; but still, though she could not be\r\notherwise than kind, it would be impossible to say that it was out of\r\npersonal predilection that Mrs Chiley devoted herself to her guest. She\r\nadmitted frankly that he was not like what clergymen were in her time.\r\nFor one thing, he seemed to think that every silly boy and girl ought to\r\nhave an opinion and be consulted, as if they had anything to do with\r\nit--which was just the way to turn their heads, and make them utterly\r\ninsupportable. On the whole, perhaps, the old lady was more charitable\r\nto Mary Chiley, and understood better how it was that she, brought up in\r\nsound Church principles, did not get on so well as might be desired with\r\nher husband\'s family, after a week of the Archdeacon. And yet he was a\r\ndelightful person, and full of information, as everybody admitted; and\r\nif Carlingford should be erected into a bishopric, as would be only\r\nright--and if Mr Beverley should happen to be appointed bishop, as was\r\nhighly probable--then it would be a pleasure to think that one had been\r\nkind to him. At the same time, it must be owned that he showed a great\r\nwant of tact in coming to Miss Marjoribanks\'s Thursday on the night of\r\nhis arrival, and thus brushing, as it were, the very cream off his\r\nintroduction to Grange Lane. And Mrs Chiley still sighed a little over\r\nMr Cavendish, and thought within herself that it was not his fault, but\r\nthat designing, artful creature, who was enough to lead any man wrong.\r\nFor it was very clear to the meanest capacity that nobody could ever\r\ncall the Archdeacon "my dear," as, with all his faults, it had been\r\npossible to call Mr Cavendish. And by this line of thought Mrs Chiley\r\nwas led to regret Mr Cavendish, and to wonder what had become of him,\r\nand what family affairs it could be that had taken him so suddenly away.\r\n\r\nA great many people in Carlingford were at that moment occupied by the\r\nsame wonders and regrets. Some people thought he was frightened to find\r\nhow far he had gone with _that_ Miss Lake, and had left town for a\r\nlittle to be out of the way; and some thought he must have been\r\nspeculating, and have lost money. To tell the truth, it was very strange\r\nthat he should have disappeared so suddenly,--just at the moment, too,\r\nwhen old Mr Chiltern had one of his bad attacks of bronchitis, which Dr\r\nMarjoribanks himself had admitted might carry him off any day. Nothing\r\ncould be more important to the future interests of young Cavendish than\r\nto be on the spot at this critical moment, and yet he had disappeared\r\nwithout telling anybody he was going, or where he was going, which was\r\non the whole a perfectly unexplainable proceeding. His very servants, as\r\nhad been ascertained by some inquiring mind in the community, were\r\nunaware of his intention up to the very last moment; and certainly he\r\nhad not said good-bye to anybody before leaving Dr Marjoribanks\'s garden\r\non that Thursday evening. Mr Woodburn, who was not a person of very\r\nrefined perceptions, was the only man who found his disappearance quite\r\nnatural. "After making such a deuced ass of himself, by George! what\r\ncould the fellow do?" said his brother-in-law, who naturally enjoyed the\r\ndiscomfiture of so near a connection; and this was no doubt a\r\nprovidential circumstance for Mrs Woodburn, who was thus saved from the\r\nnecessity of explaining or accounting for her brother\'s unexpected\r\ndisappearance; but it failed to satisfy the general community, who did\r\nnot think Mr Cavendish likely to give in at the first blow even of so\r\ndistinguished an antagonist as Miss Marjoribanks. Some of the more\r\ncharitable inhabitants of Grange Lane concluded that it must be the\r\nsudden illness of some relative which had called him away; but then,\r\nthough he was well known to be one of the Cavendishes, neither he nor\r\nhis sister ever spoke much of their connections; and, on the whole,\r\npublic opinion fluctuated between the two first suggestions--which\r\nseemed truest to nature at least, whether or not they might be fully\r\ncorroborated by fact--which were, either that Mr Cavendish had taken\r\nfright, as he might very naturally have done, at the advanced state of\r\nhis relations with Barbara Lake; or that he had speculated, and lost\r\nmoney. In either case his departure would have been natural enough, and\r\nneed not, perhaps, have been accomplished with quite so much\r\nprecipitation; but still such a community as that in Grange Lane was in\r\ncircumstances to comprehend how a young man might take fright and leave\r\nhome, either because of losing a lot of money, or getting entangled with\r\na drawing-master\'s daughter.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result, so far as society was concerned, was one for which\r\npeople did not know whether to be most glad or sorry. Mrs Woodburn, who\r\nkept half the people in Grange Lane in terror of their lives, seemed to\r\nhave lost all her inspiration now her brother was away. She did not seem\r\nto have the heart to take off anybody, which was quite a serious matter\r\nfor the amusement of the community. To be sure, some people were\r\nthankful, as supposing themselves exempted from caricature; but then\r\nunfortunately, as has been said, the people who were most afraid for Mrs\r\nWoodburn were precisely those who were unworthy of her trouble, and had\r\nnothing about them to give occupation to her graphic powers. As for Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, who had supplied one of the mimic\'s most effective\r\nstudies, she was much disturbed by the failure of this element of\r\nentertainment. "I have always thought it very strange that I never had\r\nany sense of humour," Lucilla said; "but it would not do, you know, if\r\nall the world was like me; and society would be nothing if everybody did\r\nnot exert themselves to the best of their abilities." There was a\r\nmournful intonation in Lucilla\'s voice as she said this; for, to tell\r\nthe truth, since Mr Cavendish\'s departure she had been dreadfully\r\nsensible of the utter absence of any man who could flirt. As for Osmond\r\nBrown and the other boys of his age, it might be possible to train them,\r\nbut at the best they were only a provision for the future, and in the\r\nmeantime Miss Marjoribanks could not but be sensible of her loss. She\r\nlamented it with such sincerity that all the world thought her the most\r\nperfect actress in existence. "I have nothing to say against any of\r\nyou," Lucilla would say, contemplating with the eye of an artist the\r\nyoung men of Grange Lane who were her raw material. "I dare say you will\r\nall fall in love with somebody sooner or later, and be very happy and\r\ngood for nothing; but you are no assistance in any way to society. It is\r\nMr Cavendish I am sighing for," said the woman of genius, with the\r\ncandour of a great mind; and even Mrs Woodburn was beguiled out of her\r\ndespondency by a study so unparalleled. All this time, however, Lucilla\r\nhad not forgotten the last look of her faithless admirer as he faced\r\nround upon her when Mr Archdeacon Beverley came into the room. She too,\r\nlike everybody else, wondered innocently why Mr Cavendish had gone away,\r\nand when he was coming back again; but she never hinted to any one that\r\nthe Archdeacon _had_ anything to do with it; for indeed, as she said to\r\nherself, she had no positive evidence except that of a look that the\r\nArchdeacon had anything to do with it. By which it will be seen that\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s prudence equalled her other great qualities. It\r\nwould be wrong to say, however, that her curiosity was not excited, and\r\nthat in a very lively way; for the vague wonder of the public mind over\r\na strange fact, could never be compared in intensity to the surprise and\r\ncuriosity excited by something one has actually seen, and which gives\r\none, as it were, a share in the secret,--if indeed there was a secret,\r\nwhich was a matter upon which Lucilla within herself had quite made up\r\nher mind.\r\n\r\nAs for the Archdeacon, the place which he took in society was one quite\r\ndifferent from that which had been filled by Mr Cavendish, as, indeed,\r\nwas natural. He was one of those men who are very strong for the\r\nmasculine side of Christianity; and when he was with the ladies, he had\r\na sense that he ought to be paid attention to, instead of taking that\r\ntrouble in his own person. Miss Marjoribanks was not a woman to be\r\nblind to the advantages of this situation, but still, as was to be\r\nexpected, it took her a little time to get used to it, and to make all\r\nthe use of it which was practicable under the circumstances--which was\r\nall the more difficult since she was not in the least "viewy" in her own\r\nperson, but had been brought up in the old-fashioned orthodox way of\r\nhaving a great respect for religion, and as little to do with it as\r\npossible, which was a state of mind largely prevalent in Carlingford.\r\nBut that was not in the least Mr Beverley\'s way.\r\n\r\nIt was when Lucilla\'s mind was much occupied by this problem that she\r\nreceived a visit quite unexpectedly one morning from little Rose Lake,\r\nwho had just at that time a great deal on her mind. For it may easily be\r\nsupposed that Mr Cavendish\'s sudden departure, which bewildered the\r\ngeneral public who had no special interest in the matter, must have had\r\na still more overwhelming effect upon Barbara Lake, who had just been\r\nraised to the very highest pinnacle of hope, closely touching upon\r\nreality, when all her expectations collapsed and came to nothing in a\r\nmoment. She would not believe at first that it could be true; and then,\r\nwhen it was no longer possible to resist the absolute certainty of Mr\r\nCavendish\'s departure, her disappointment found vent in every kind of\r\nviolence--hysterics, and other manifestations of unreason and self-will.\r\nRose had been obliged to leave the Female School of Design upon her\r\npapa\'s overburdened shoulders, and stay at home to nurse her sister.\r\nPerhaps the little artist was not the best person to take care of a\r\nsufferer under such circumstances; for she was neither unreasonable nor\r\nself-willed to speak of, though perhaps a little opinionative in her\r\nway--and could not be brought to think that a whole household should be\r\ndisturbed and disordered, and a young woman in good health retire to her\r\nroom, and lose all control of herself, because a young man, with whom\r\nshe had no acquaintance three months before, had gone out of town\r\nunexpectedly. Perhaps it was a want of feeling on the part of the\r\nunsympathetic sister. She gave out that Barbara was ill, and kept up a\r\nmost subdued and anxious countenance downstairs, for the benefit of the\r\nchildren and the maid-of-all-work, who represented public opinion in\r\nGrove Street; but when Rose went into her sister\'s room, where Barbara\r\nkept the blinds down, and had her face swollen with crying, it was with\r\na very stern countenance that her little mentor regarded the invalid.\r\n"I do not ask you to have a sense of duty," Rose said, with a certain\r\nfine disdain, "but at least you might have a proper pride." This was all\r\nshe took the trouble to say; but it must be admitted that a great deal\r\nmore to the same effect might be read in her eyes, which were generally\r\nso dewy and soft, but which could flash on occasion. And then as the\r\nweek drew on towards Thursday, and all her representations proved\r\nunavailing to induce Barbara to get up and prepare herself for her usual\r\nduties, the scorn and vexation and impatience with which the dutiful\r\nlittle soul met her sister\'s sullen determination that "she was not\r\nable" to fulfil her ordinary engagements, roused Rose up to a great\r\nresolution. For her own part she was one of the people who do not\r\nunderstand giving in. "What do you mean by lying there?" she said,\r\npounding Barbara down small and cutting her to pieces with infallible\r\ngood sense and logic; "will that do any good? You would try to look\r\nbetter than usual, and sing better than usual, if you had any proper\r\npride. I did not fall ill when my flounce was passed over at the\r\nexhibition. I made up my mind that very evening about the combination\r\nfor my veil. I would die rather than give in if I were you."\r\n\r\n"Your flounce!" sobbed Barbara--"oh, you unfeeling insensible thing!--as\r\nif your h-heart had anything to do with--that. I only went to s-spite\r\nLucilla--and I won\'t go--no more--oh, no more--now he\'s been and\r\ndeserted me. You can\'t understand my feelings--g-go away and leave me\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"Barbara," said Rose, with solemnity, "I would forgive you if you would\r\nnot be mean. I don\'t understand it in one of _us_. If Mr Cavendish has\r\ngone away, it shows that he does not care for you; and you would scorn\r\nhim, and scorn to show you were thinking of him, if you had any proper\r\npride."\r\n\r\nBut all the answer Barbara gave was to turn away with a jerk of\r\nannoyance the old easy-chair in which she was lying buried, with her\r\nhands thrust up into her black hair, and her eyes all red; upon which\r\nRose left her to carry out her own resolution. She was prompt in all her\r\nmovements, and she wasted no time on reconsideration. She went down into\r\nGrange Lane, her little head erect, and her bright eyes regarding the\r\nworld with that air of frank recognition and acknowledgment which Rose\r\nfelt she owed as an artist to her fellow-creatures. They were all good\r\nsubjects more or less, and the consciousness that she could draw them\r\nand immortalise them gave her the same sense of confidence in their\r\nfriendliness, and her own perfect command of the situation, as a young\r\nprincess might have felt whose rank protected her like an invisible\r\nbuckler. Rose, too, walked erect and open-eyed, in the confidence of\r\n_her_ rank, which made her everybody\'s equal. It was in this frame of\r\nmind that she arrived at Dr Marjoribanks\'s house, and found Lucilla, who\r\nwas very glad to see her. Miss Marjoribanks was pondering deeply on the\r\nArchdeacon at that moment, and her little visitor seemed as one sent by\r\nheaven to help her out. For to tell the truth, though Lucilla understood\r\nall about Mr Cavendish, and men of his description, and how to manage\r\nthem, and take full use of their powers, even her commanding\r\nintelligence felt the lack of experience in respect to such a case as\r\nthat of the Archdeacon, who required a different treatment to draw him\r\nout. She was thinking it over intently at the moment of Rose\'s arrival,\r\nfor Lucilla was not a person to give up the advantages of a novel\r\nposition because she did not quite understand it. She felt within\r\nherself that there was no doubt a great effect might be produced if she\r\ncould but see how to do it. And it was Thursday morning, and there was\r\nno time to lose.\r\n\r\n"I came to speak to you about Barbara," said Rose. "She is not fit to\r\ncome out this morning. I told her it was very ungrateful not to make an\r\neffort after you had been so kind; but I am sorry to say she has not a\r\nstrong sense of duty; and I don\'t think she would be able to sing or do\r\nanything but look stupid. I hope you will not think very badly of her.\r\nThere are some people who can\'t help giving in, I suppose," said Rose,\r\nwith an impatient little sigh.\r\n\r\n"And so this is you, you dear little Rose!" said Lucilla, "and I have\r\nnever seen you before since I came home--and you always were such a pet\r\nof mine at Mount Pleasant! I can\'t think why you never came to see me\r\nbefore; as for me, you know, I never have any time. Poor papa has nobody\r\nelse to take care of him, and it always was the object of my life to be\r\na comfort to papa."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Rose, who was a straightforward little woman, and not given\r\nto compliments. "I have a great deal to do too," she said; "and then all\r\nmy spare moments I am working at my design. Papa always says that\r\nsociety accepts artists for what they can give, and does not expect them\r\nto sacrifice their time," Rose continued, with her little air of\r\ndignity. Miss Marjoribanks knew very well that society was utterly\r\nunconscious of the existence of the Lake family; but then there is\r\nalways something imposing in such a perfectly innocent and superb\r\nassumption as that to which the young Preraphaelite had just given\r\nutterance; and it began to dawn upon Lucilla that here was another\r\nimperfectly understood but effective instrument lying ready to her hand.\r\n\r\n"I should like to see your design," said Miss Marjoribanks graciously.\r\n"You made such a pretty little wreath for the corner of my\r\nhandkerchief--don\'t you remember?--all frogs\' legs and things. It looked\r\nso sweet in the old satin stitch. What is the matter with poor Barbara?\r\nI felt sure she would catch cold and lose her voice. I shall tell papa\r\nto go and see her. As for to-night, it will be a dreadful loss to be\r\nsure, for I never could find a voice that went so well with mine. But if\r\nyou are sure she can\'t come----"\r\n\r\n"When people have not a sense of duty," said Rose, with an indignant\r\nsigh, "nor any proper pride,----Some are so different. Barbara ought to\r\nhave been some rich person\'s daughter, with nothing to do. She would not\r\nmind being of no use in the world. It is a kind of temperament I don\'t\r\nunderstand," continued the little artist. All this, it is true, was\r\nnovel to Miss Marjoribanks, who had a kind of prejudice in favour of the\r\ndaughters of rich persons who had nothing to do; but Lucilla\'s genius\r\nwas broad and catholic, and did not insist upon comprehending\r\neverything. She gave Rose a sudden scrutinising look, and measured her\r\nmentally against the gap she had to fill. No doubt it was an experiment,\r\nand might fail signally; but then Miss Marjoribanks was always at hand\r\nto cover deficiencies, and she had that confidence in herself and her\r\ngood fortune which is necessary to everybody who greatly dares.\r\n\r\n"You must come yourself this evening, you dear old Rose," said Lucilla.\r\n"You know I always was fond of you. Oh, yes, I know you can\'t sing like\r\nBarbara. But the Archdeacon is coming, who understands about art; and if\r\nyou would like to bring your design----My principle has always been,\r\nthat there should be a little of everything in society," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. "I dare say you will feel a little strange at first with\r\nnot knowing the people, but that will soon pass off--and you _must_\r\ncome."\r\n\r\nWhen she had said this, Lucilla bestowed upon little Rose a friendly\r\nschoolfellow kiss, putting her hands upon the little artist\'s shoulders,\r\nand looking her full in the face as she did so. "I am sure you can\r\ntalk," said Miss Marjoribanks. She did not say "Go away now, and leave\r\nme to my arrangements;" but Rose, who was quick-witted, understood that\r\nthe salute was a dismissal, and she went away accordingly, tingling with\r\npride and excitement and pleasure and a kind of pain. The idea of\r\npractically exemplifying, in her own person, the kind of demeanour which\r\nsociety ought to expect from an artist had not occurred to Rose; but\r\ndestiny having arranged it so, she was not the woman to withdraw from\r\nher responsibilities. She said to herself that it would be shabby for\r\nher who was known to have opinions on this subject, to shrink from\r\ncarrying them out; and stimulated her courage by recourse to her\r\nprinciples, as people do who feel themselves bound to lay sacrifices on\r\nthe altar of duty. Notwithstanding this elevated view of the emergency,\r\nit must be admitted that a sudden thought of what she would wear had\r\nflushed to Rose\'s very finger-tips, with a heat and tingle of which the\r\nlittle heroine was ashamed. For it was Thursday morning, and there was\r\nnot a moment to be lost. However, after the first thrill which this idea\r\nhad given her, Rose bethought herself once more of her principles, and\r\nstilled her beating heart. It was not for her to think of what she was\r\nto put on, she who had so often proclaimed the exemption of "a family of\r\nartists" from the rules which weigh so hard upon the common world. "We\r\nhave a rank of our own," she said to herself, but with that tremor which\r\nalways accompanies the transference of a purely theoretical and even\r\nfantastic rule of conduct into practical ground--"We are everybody\'s\r\nequal, and we are nobody\'s equal--and when papa begins to be appreciated\r\nas he ought to be, and Willie has made a Name----" This was always the\r\npoint at which Rose broke off, falling into reverie that could not be\r\nexpressed in words; but she had no leisure to remark upon the chance\r\n"compositions" in the street, or the effects of light and shade, as she\r\nwent home. A sudden and heavy responsibility had fallen upon her\r\nshoulders, and she would have scorned herself had she deserted her\r\npost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XVIII_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the anticipations of Rose Lake were trifling matters in comparison\r\nwith the universal interest and even excitement which attended the\r\nArchdeacon\'s first appearance in Carlingford. What might be called his\r\nfirst public appearance took place at Dr Marjoribanks\'s table, although\r\nhe had previously dined at the Rectory, and also at Sir John Richmond\'s,\r\nbesides that there had been somebody to dinner at Colonel Chiley\'s\r\nalmost every day; but then there were only county people at Sir John\'s,\r\nand Mr Bury\'s guests naturally counted for very little in Grange\r\nLane;--indeed, it was confidently reported that the Rector had invited\r\nMr Tufton of Salem Chapel to meet the Archdeacon, and that, but for the\r\nDissenting minister having more sense and knowing his place, that\r\nunseemly conjunction would have taken place, to the horror of all\r\nright-thinking people. So that Dr Marjoribanks\'s was in reality the\r\nfirst house where he had any chance of seeing society. It would perhaps\r\nbe using too strong a word to say that Miss Marjoribanks was anxious\r\nabout the success of her arrangements for this particular evening; but,\r\nat the same time, it must be admitted that the circumstances were such\r\nas to justify a little anxiety. Mr Cavendish was gone, who, to do him\r\njustice, was always agreeable, and his departure disturbed the habitual\r\nparty; and Mrs Woodburn had lost all her powers, as it seemed, and sat\r\nat Dr Marjoribanks\'s left hand, looking just like other people, and\r\nevidently not to be in the least depended on; and Lucilla was aware that\r\nBarbara was not coming, which made, if nothing else, a change in the\r\nprogramme. No music, nobody to do the flirting, nor to supply the\r\ndramatic by-play to which Grange Lane had become accustomed; and a new\r\nman to be made use of, and to be done honour to, and introduced in\r\nsociety. A young woman of powers inferior to those of Miss Marjoribanks\r\nwould have sunk under such a weight of responsibility, and there was no\r\ndoubt that Lucilla was a little excited. She felt that everything\r\ndepended upon her courage and self-possession. If she but lost her head\r\nfor a moment and lost command of affairs, everything might have been\r\nlost; but then fortunately she knew herself and what she could do, and\r\nhad a modest confidence that she would not lose her head; and thus she\r\ncould still eat her dinner with the composure of genius, though it would\r\nbe wrong to deny that Lucilla was a little pale.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as if all these things had not been enough to discourage the\r\nlady of the house, another discordant element was added by the presence\r\nof Mr Bury and his sister, whom it had been necessary to ask to meet the\r\nArchdeacon. The Rector, though he was very Low-Church, has no particular\r\nobjections to a good dinner--but he made a principle of talking of that\r\nimportant daily necessity in a disparaging, or at best in a patronising\r\nway, which roused Dr Marjoribanks\'s temper; and sometimes the Doctor\r\nwould launch a shaft of medical wit at his spiritual guide, which Mr\r\nBury had no means of parrying. Nor was this the only danger to which the\r\npeace of the party was exposed. For the Rector, at the same time,\r\nregarded Mr Beverley with a certain critical suspiciousness, such as is\r\nseldom to be encountered except among clergymen. He did not know much\r\nabout his clerical superior, who had only recently been appointed to his\r\narchdeaconry; but there was something in his air, his looks, and\r\ndemeanour, which indicated what Mr Bury considered a loose way of\r\nthinking. When the Archdeacon made any remark the Rector would pause and\r\nlook up from his plate to listen to it, with his fork suspended in the\r\nair the while--and then he would exchange glances with his sister, who\r\nwas on the other side of the table. All this, it may be supposed, was a\r\nlittle discomposing for Lucilla, who had the responsibility of\r\neverything, and who could now look for no assistance among the ordinary\r\nmembers of her father\'s party, who were, as a general rule, much more\r\noccupied with the dinner than with anything else that was going on. In\r\nsuch a state of affairs, it was a great relief to Miss Marjoribanks when\r\nthe Archdeacon, who occupied the post of honour by her side, made a\r\nlively new beginning in the conversation. It had not to call _flagged_\r\nbefore--not precisely flagged--but still there were indications of\r\napproaching exhaustion, such as can always be perceived half a mile off\r\nby anybody who has any experience in society, and when the Archdeacon\r\ntook up the ball with all the liveliness of a man who is interested in a\r\nspecial question, it will not be difficult to any lady who has ever been\r\nin such circumstances to realise to herself Miss Marjoribanks\'s sense of\r\ngratitude and relief.\r\n\r\n"By the bye," said Mr Beverley, "I meant to ask if any one knew a man\r\nwhom I am sure I caught a glimpse of the first day I was in Carlingford.\r\nPerhaps it was in the morning after I arrived, to be precise. I can\'t\r\nrecollect exactly. If he lives about here, he ought to be known, for he\r\nis a clever amusing sort of fellow. I don\'t know if Carlingford is more\r\nblessed than other country towns with people of that complexion," said\r\nthe Archdeacon, turning to Lucilla with a smile. His smile, as he paused\r\nand turned to Miss Marjoribanks, was such as conveys a kind of challenge\r\nwhen it is addressed to a young lady, and meant to lead to a lively\r\nlittle combat by the way; and yet there was something of keen personal\r\nanxiety and animosity in it. As for Lucilla, she was conscious of an\r\nimmediate thrill of curiosity, but still it was curiosity unmingled with\r\nany excitement, and she had no particular objection to respond.\r\n\r\n"Everybody is nice in Carlingford," said Miss Marjoribanks; "some people\r\nare always finding fault with their neighbours, but I always get on so\r\nwell with everybody--I suppose it is my luck." This was not precisely an\r\nanswer to the Archdeacon\'s question; and there was somebody at the table\r\nwho could have fallen upon Lucilla and beaten her for putting off the\r\nrevelation which trembled on the lips of Mr Beverley, and yet would have\r\ngiven anything in the world to silence the Archdeacon, and felt capable\r\nof rushing at him like a fury and tearing his tongue out, or suffocating\r\nhim, to stop the next words that he was going to say. But nobody knew\r\nanything about this, or could see into the one heart that had begun to\r\nflutter and throb with alarm; for outwardly, all the well-dressed,\r\ncheerful people at Dr Marjoribanks\'s table sat eating their dinner, one\r\nprecisely like another, as if there had been no such thing as mystery or\r\nterror in the world.\r\n\r\n"You must not expect me to believe in the perfection of human society,"\r\nsaid the Archdeacon, going on in the same strain; "I would much rather\r\npin my faith to the amiable dispositions of one young lady who always\r\nfinds her neighbours agreeable--and I hope she makes no exception to the\r\nrule," said the Broad-Churchman in a parenthesis, with a smile and a\r\nbow--and then he raised his voice a little: "The man I speak of is\r\nreally a very amusing fellow, and very well got up, and calculated to\r\nimpose upon ordinary observers. It is quite a curious story; he was a\r\nson of a trainer or something of that sort about Newmarket. Old Lord\r\nMonmouth took an extraordinary fancy to him, and had him constantly\r\nabout his place--at one time, indeed, he half brought him up along with\r\nhis grandson, you know. He always was a handsome fellow, and picked up a\r\nlittle polish; and really, for people not quite used to the real thing,\r\nwas as nearly like a gentleman----"\r\n\r\n"Come, now, I don\'t put any faith in that," said Mr Woodburn. "I don\'t\r\npretend to be much of a one for fine company myself, but I know a\r\ngentleman when I see him; a snob always overdoes it, you know----"\r\n\r\n"I never said this man was a snob," said the Archdeacon, with a refined\r\nexpression of disgust at the interruption flitting over his features;\r\n"on the contrary, if he had only been honest, he would have been really\r\na very nice fellow----"\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," said Mr Bury, "excuse me for breaking in--perhaps I am\r\nold-fashioned, but don\'t you think it\'s a pity to treat the question of\r\nhonesty so lightly? A dishonest person has a precious soul to be saved,\r\nand may be a most deeply interesting character; but to speak of him as a\r\nvery nice fellow, is--pardon me--I think it\'s a pity; especially in\r\nmixed society, where it is so important for a clergyman to be guarded in\r\nhis expressions," said the Rector. When Mr Bury began to speak,\r\neverybody else at table ceased talking, and gave serious attention to\r\nwhat was going on, for the prospect of a passage of arms between the two\r\nclergymen was an opportunity too captivating to be lost.\r\n\r\n"I hope Mr Bury\'s dishonest friends will pardon me," said the\r\nArchdeacon; "I mean no harm to their superior claims. Does anybody know\r\nthe man here, I wonder? He had changed his name when I knew him, and\r\nthere is no telling what he may call himself now. I assure you he was a\r\nvery good-looking fellow--dark, good features, nearly six feet high----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, please don\'t say any more," said Miss Marjoribanks, and she could\r\nnot quite have explained why she interrupted these personal details; "if\r\nyou tell me what he is like, I shall fancy everybody I meet is him; Mr\r\nCentum is dark, and has good features, and is nearly six feet high.\r\nNever mind what he is like; you gentlemen can never describe\r\nanybody--you always keep to _generals_; tell us what he has done."\r\n\r\nSomebody drew a long breath at the table when the Archdeacon obeyed Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s injunction. More than one person caught the sound, but\r\neven Lucilla\'s keen eyes could not make out beyond controversy from whom\r\nit proceeded. To be sure, Lucilla\'s mind was in a most curious state of\r\ntumult and confusion. She was not one of the people who take a long time\r\nto form their conclusions; but the natural conclusion to which she felt\r\ninclined to jump in this case was one so monstrous and incredible that\r\nMiss Marjoribanks felt her only safeguard in the whirl of possibilities\r\nwas to reject it altogether, and make up her mind that it was\r\nimpossible; and then all the correspondences and apparent corroborations\r\nbegan to dance and whirl about her in a bewildering ring till her own\r\nbrain seemed to spin with them. She was as much afraid lest the\r\nArchdeacon by some chance should fall upon a really individual feature\r\nwhich the world in general could identify, as if she had had any real\r\nconcern in the matter. But then, fortunately, there was not much chance\r\nof that; for it was one of Lucilla\'s principles that men never can\r\ndescribe each other. She listened, however, with such a curious\r\ncommotion in her mind, that she did not quite make out what he was\r\nsaying, and only pieced it up in little bits from memory afterwards. Not\r\nthat it was a very dreadful story. It was not a narrative of robbery or\r\nmurder, or anything very alarming; but if it could by any possibility\r\nturn out that the man of whom Mr Beverley was speaking had ever been\r\nreceived in society in Carlingford, then it would be a dreadful blow to\r\nthe community, and destroy public confidence for ever in the social\r\nleaders. This was what Lucilla was thinking in her sudden turmoil of\r\namazement and apprehension. And all this time there was another person\r\nat table who knew all about it twenty times better than Lucilla, and\r\nknew what was coming, and had a still more intense terror lest some\r\npersonal detail might drop from the Archdeacon\'s lips which the public\r\nin general would recognise. Mr Beverley went on with his story with a\r\ncurious sort of personal keenness in his way of telling it, but never\r\ndreaming for a moment that anybody that heard him was disturbed or\r\nexcited by it. "He has a mark on his face," the Archdeacon said--but\r\nhere Miss Marjoribanks gave a little cry, and held up both her hands in\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell us what marks he has on his face," said Lucilla. "I know\r\nthat I shall think every man who is dark, and has good features, and is\r\nsix feet, must be him. I wonder if it could be my cousin Tom; _he_ has a\r\nlittle mark on his face--and it would be just like his dreadful luck,\r\npoor fellow. Would it be right to give up one\'s own cousin if it should\r\nturn out to be Tom?" said Miss Marjoribanks. The people who were sitting\r\nat her end of the table laughed, but there was no laughing in Lucilla\'s\r\nmind. And this fright and panic were poor preparatives for the evening,\r\nwhich had to be got through creditably with so few resources, and with\r\nsuch a total reversal of the ordinary programme. Miss Marjoribanks was\r\nstill tingling with curiosity and alarm when she rose from the table. If\r\nit should really come to pass that an adventurer had been received into\r\nthe best society of Carlingford, and that the best judges had not been\r\nable to discriminate between the false and true, how could any one\r\nexpect that Grange Lane would continue to confide its most important\r\narrangements to such incompetent hands?\r\n\r\nSuch was the dreadful question that occupied all Lucilla\'s thoughts. So\r\nfar as the adventurer himself was concerned, no doubt he deserved\r\nanything that might come upon him; but the judgment which might overtake\r\nthe careless shepherds who had admitted the wolf into the fold was much\r\nmore in Miss Marjoribanks\'s mind than any question of abstract justice.\r\nSo that it was not entirely with a philanthropical intention that she\r\nstopped Mr Beverley and put an end to his dangerous details. Now she\r\ncame to think of it, she began to remember that _nobody of her\r\nacquaintance_ had any mark on his face; but still it was best not to\r\ninquire too closely. It was thus with a preoccupied mind that she went\r\nup to the drawing-room, feeling less in spirits for her work than on any\r\nprevious occasion. It was the first of the unlucky nights, which every\r\nwoman of Lucilla\'s large and public-spirited views must calculate upon\r\nas inevitable now and then. There was no moon, and the Richmonds\r\nnaturally were absent, and so were the Miss Browns, who were staying\r\nthere on a visit--for it was after the engagement between Lydia[1] and\r\nJohn; and Mr Cavendish was away (though perhaps under the circumstances\r\nthat was no disadvantage); and Mrs Woodburn was silenced; and even\r\nBarbara Lake had failed her patroness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It may be mentioned here that this was an engagement that\r\nnone of the friends approved of, and that it was the greatest possible\r\ncomfort to Miss Marjoribanks\'s mind that she had nothing to do with\r\nit--either one way or another, as she said.]\r\n\r\n"You are not in spirits to-night, Lucilla, my poor dear," said Mrs\r\nChiley, as they went upstairs; and the kind old lady cast a fierce\r\nglance at Mrs Woodburn, who was going before them with Miss Bury, as if\r\nit could be her fault.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley," said Miss Marjoribanks, "I am in perfect spirits; it\r\nis only the responsibility, you know. Poor Barbara is ill, and we can\'t\r\nhave any music, and what if people should be bored? When one has real\r\nfriends to stand by one it is different," said Lucilla, with an\r\nintonation that was not intended for Mrs Chiley, "and I _always_ stand\r\nby my friends."\r\n\r\nThis was the spirit with which Miss Marjoribanks went upstairs. It was a\r\nsentiment which pervaded her whole life. Even when she had occasion to\r\nbe sufficiently displeased with the people who surrounded her, and to\r\nfeel that her own loyal friendship met with no adequate response, this\r\nwas the unfailing inspiration of her heart. She did not rush into\r\nopposition because any misguided man or woman failed for the moment to\r\nappreciate her efforts, and return, as they ought to have been glad to\r\ndo, her sentiments of kindness. On the contrary, nothing could have been\r\nmore long-suffering and tolerant and benign than the feelings with which\r\nLucilla regarded the unfortunate persons who mistook or did not\r\nappreciate her. She knew herself, which, however superior they might be,\r\nwas something they could not know; and she could afford to be sorry (for\r\ntheir own sakes) for their want of discrimination. If there should\r\nhappen to be somebody in Grange Lane who had gained admittance into\r\nsociety under false pretences, not even such an offence, grievous as it\r\nwas, could induce Miss Marjoribanks to condemn the culprit unheard. It\r\nwas at once her settled resolution, and a peculiarity of her character,\r\nto stand by her friends; and whatever might be the thoughts in her own\r\nmind, her immediate decision was to shut her ears to every indication of\r\nthe culprit\'s personality, and to be blind to every suggestion that\r\ncould identify him. People who like to discover the alloy which blends\r\nwith all human motives, may suppose that Lucilla felt her own credit as\r\nthe leader of society at stake, and would not admit that she had been\r\nduped. But this had in reality but a very small share in the matter. Her\r\ninstinct, even when reason suggested that she should be doubtful of\r\nthem, was always to side with her own friends; and though there might be\r\npersons included in that sacred number who were scarcely worthy of the\r\ncharacter, yet Lucilla, like every lofty character, could act but\r\naccording to her own nature, and could not forsake any one whom she\r\nsupposed to be thus mysteriously and darkly assailed.\r\n\r\nAnd she had her reward. There are virtues in this world which go without\r\nany recompense, but there are other virtues upon which a prompt guerdon\r\nis bestowed; and Lucilla possessed this happier development. Whether it\r\nwas that little speech of hers which touched the mimic\'s heart, or\r\nwhether the effect was produced by some other secret influence, it is\r\ncertain that this was the night on which Mrs Woodburn\'s talent came to\r\nwhat may be called a sort of apotheosis. She shook off her languor as by\r\na sudden inspiration, and gave such a sketch of the Archdeacon as up to\r\nthis day is remembered more clearly in Carlingford than the man himself.\r\nShe took him off to his very face, and he never found it out, though\r\neverybody else did, and the house shook with restrained laughter. And as\r\nif this was not enough, Rose Lake had come with her portfolio, with some\r\nsketches of her brother\'s (who afterwards became so celebrated) in it,\r\nwhich electrified all the people who were fond of art; and by the side\r\nof the young Preraphaelite was Barbara, who had come "to spite Lucilla,"\r\nand who remained unwittingly to grace her triumph. She stood by herself,\r\nall wan and crumpled, all the night, showing her disappointment and rage\r\nand jilted state so clearly in her face, as to afford to all the mammas\r\nin her neighbourhood a most startling example of the danger of showing\r\nyour feelings, with which to point a moral to the other young people\r\nabout. She had come because Rose was coming, and she would not be\r\neclipsed by her younger sister. But nobody took any notice of Barbara on\r\nthis miserable evening; nobody asked her to sing, or offered her a seat,\r\nor even spoke to her, except Lucilla, who in her magnanimity found time\r\nto say a word as she passed. She was carelessly dressed, and her hair\r\nwas hastily arranged, and her eyes were red. She had no desire to look\r\nas if she had not been jilted, and had no proper pride, as Rose said;\r\nand Mrs Chiley, who was Lucilla\'s partisan and champion, and who thought\r\npoor Barbara deserved it all, seized the opportunity, and delivered a\r\nlittle lecture on the subject to the first group of girls who came in\r\nher way.\r\n\r\n"A disappointment may happen to any one," said Mrs Chiley; "and so long\r\nas they had done nothing unbecoming, nobody could blame them; but, my\r\ndears, whatever you do, don\'t show it like that! It makes me ashamed of\r\nmy sex. And only look at Lucilla!" said the old lady. Lucilla had the\r\nbest of it now. Instead of a failure, such as for a moment seemed\r\nlikely, she had a triumphant success. She, and she only, said a word of\r\nkindness to her formerly triumphant rival. She drove her chariot over\r\nBarbara, and drew an advantage even from her sullen looks and red eyes.\r\nAnd the only thing that dissatisfied Mrs Chiley in the entire course of\r\nthe evening was the trustful confidence with which Miss Marjoribanks\r\nleft the Archdeacon, the (possible) new candidate for her favour, beside\r\nthe Lakes and their portfolio of drawings. In this, as in all other\r\nthings, Lucilla could not but follow the dictates of her magnanimous\r\nnature. And even her own prospects, as her old friend lamented, were as\r\nnothing to her in comparison with the good of society. Experience ought\r\nto have taught her better; but then experience rarely does that amount\r\nof practical good which is generally attributed to it in the world.\r\nLucilla gave little Rose the fullest opportunity of showing her drawings\r\nto the Archdeacon and awakening his curiosity, and even securing his\r\naffections, as the jealous observer thought; and everybody knows how\r\nlittle is necessary, if a young woman likes to exert herself, to lead a\r\npoor man to his undoing; and Mr Beverley, though an archdeacon, was most\r\nprobably, in this respect at least, no wiser than other men. This was\r\nthe painful aspect of the case which Mrs Chiley discussed with her\r\nhusband when they got home.\r\n\r\n"He is not like what clergymen were in our day," said the old lady, "but\r\nstill he is very nice, and has a nice position, and it would just suit\r\nLucilla; but to think of her going and leaving him with these Lake\r\ngirls, notwithstanding the lesson she has had! and I have no doubt the\r\nlittle one is just as designing and nasty as the other. If it should\r\ncome to anything, she has only herself to blame," said Mrs Chiley. As\r\nfor the Colonel, he took it more calmly, as a gentleman might be\r\nexpected to do.\r\n\r\n"You may trust a parson for that," said the old soldier. "He knows what\r\nhe is about. You will never find him make such an ass of himself as\r\nyoung Cavendish did." But this only made Mrs Chiley sigh the more.\r\n\r\n"Poor Mr Cavendish!" said the old lady. "I will never blame him, poor\r\nfellow. It was all that deceitful thing laying her snares for him. For\r\nmy part I never like to have anything to do with those artist kind of\r\npeople--they are all adventurers," said the Colonel\'s wife; and she went\r\nto bed with this unchristian persuasion in her mind.\r\n\r\nWhile every one else regarded the matter with, to some extent, a\r\npersonal bias, the only person who looked at it abstractly, and\r\ncontemplated not the accidents of an evening, but the work itself, which\r\nwas progressing in the face of all kinds of social difficulties, was the\r\nmaster-mind which first conceived the grand design of turning the\r\nchaotic elements of society in Carlingford into one grand unity. Lucilla\r\nwas not blind to the dangers that surrounded her, nor indifferent to the\r\npartial disappointment she had undergone; but she saw that, in spite of\r\nall, her great work was making progress. And when we announce that Miss\r\nMarjoribanks herself was satisfied, there remains little more to say.\r\n\r\nAs for the Archdeacon, he, as was natural, knew nothing about the\r\nmatter. He said again, with the natural obtuseness which is so general\r\namong the gentlemen, that it had been a very pleasant party. "She has a\r\nfine clear candid nature," said Mr Beverley, which certainly was better\r\nthan pronouncing solemnly that she was a good woman, which was what he\r\nsaid of Mrs Chiley and Lady Richmond, in the lump, as it were, without\r\nconsidering how unlike they were to each other. That was all he, being\r\nonly a man, knew about it. But though Lucilla was satisfied with the\r\nevents of the evening, it would be vain to deny that there were\r\nperturbations in her mind as she laid her head upon her maiden pillow.\r\nShe said to herself again with profounder fervour, that fortunately her\r\naffections had not been engaged; but there were more things than\r\naffections to be taken into consideration. Could it be possible that\r\nmystery, and perhaps imposture, of one kind or another, had crossed the\r\nsacred threshold of Grange Lane; and that people might find out and cast\r\nin Lucilla\'s face the dreadful discovery that a man had been received in\r\n_her_ house who was not what he appeared to be? When such an idea\r\ncrossed her mind, Miss Marjoribanks shivered under her satin quilt. Of\r\ncourse she could not change the nature of the fact one way or another;\r\nbut, at least, it was her duty to act with great circumspection, so that\r\nif possible it might not be found out--for Lucilla appreciated fully the\r\ndifference that exists between wrong and discovery. If any man was\r\nimposing upon his neighbours and telling lies about himself, it was his\r\nown fault; but if a leader of society were to betray the fact of having\r\nreceived and petted such a person, then the responsibility was on _her_\r\nshoulders. And softer thoughts mingled with these prudential\r\nconsiderations--that sweet yet stern resolution to stand by her friends\r\nwhich Miss Marjoribanks had this evening expressed, and that sense of\r\npity for everybody who is unfortunate which asserts itself even in the\r\nstrongest of female intelligences. On the whole, it was clear that\r\nprudence was the great thing required, and a determination not to give\r\ntoo hasty heed to anything, nor to put herself in the wrong by any\r\nalarmist policy. Fortunately the respectability of Dr Marjoribanks\'s\r\nhouse was enough to cover its guests with a shining buckler. Thus\r\nLucilla calmed down her own apprehensions, and succeeded in convincing\r\nherself that if the impostor whom the Archdeacon had seen had been\r\nreally received in Grange Lane, it was so much the worse for the\r\nimpostor; but that, in the meantime, in the lack of evidence it was much\r\nthe best thing to take no notice. If there was any one else in\r\nCarlingford who regarded that past danger with a livelier horror and a\r\nmore distinct fear, certainly Miss Marjoribanks had no way of knowing of\r\nit; and nobody had been remarked as being in a despondent condition, or,\r\nindeed, in anything but the highest spirits, in the course of this\r\nThursday, except the ungrateful creature who had begun all the mischief;\r\nand tolerant as Lucilla was, it would have been going beyond the limits\r\nof nature to have expected that she could have been profoundly sorry for\r\nBarbara Lake.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, poor Barbara, though she was not an elevated\r\ncharacter, had gone home in a very sad state of mind. She had taken\r\ncourage to ask Mrs Woodburn about her brother, and Mrs Woodburn had made\r\nthe very briefest and rudest response to her question, and had "taken\r\noff" her woe-begone looks almost to her very face. And no one had shown\r\nthe least sympathy for the forsaken one. She had not even been called\r\nfrom her solitude to sing, which might have been something, and it was\r\nRose, as she said to herself, who had attracted all the attention; for,\r\nlike most selfish people, Barbara, though keenly aware of her own\r\nwrongs, had no eyes to perceive that Rose, who had a proud little\r\nspirit, was anything but satisfied with the evening\'s entertainment, to\r\nwhich she had herself so largely contributed. "I feel as if I should\r\nnever see him more," Barbara said, quite subdued and broken down, with a\r\nburst of tears, as the two went home; and poor little Rose, who was\r\nsoft-hearted, forgot all her disapprobation in sympathy. "Never mind\r\nthem, dear; they have no feeling. We must cling together all the closer,\r\nand try to be everything to each other," Rose said, with eyes which were\r\nfull, but which would not shed any tears. What was passing through her\r\nown mind was, that it was not for herself, but for her portfolio and the\r\ntalk that arose over it, that Lucilla had asked her; but, at the same\r\ntime, she said to herself, that all that was nothing in comparison to\r\nthe wound of the heart under which Barbara was suffering. "Dear, never\r\nmind, we will be everything to each other," said poor little romantic\r\nRose; and the elder sister, even in the depths of her dejection, could\r\nhave given her a good shake for uttering such an absurd sentiment; for a\r\ngreat deal of good it would do to be everything to each other--as if\r\nthat could ever replace the orange blossoms and the wedding tour, and\r\nthe carriage and handsome house, which were included in the name of\r\nCavendish! "And he was such a dear!" she said to herself in her own\r\nmind, and wept, and made her eyes redder and redder. If Mr Cavendish had\r\nknown all that was going on in Carlingford that night, the chances are\r\nthat he would have been most flattered by those tears which Barbara shed\r\nfor him under the lamps in Grove Street; but then it is to be hoped he\r\nwould not have been insensible either to the just reticence and\r\nself-restraint which, mingling with Miss Marjoribanks\'s suspicions,\r\nprevented her, as she herself said, even in the deepest seclusion of her\r\nown thoughts, from naming any name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XIX_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Lucilla\'s good luck and powers of persuasion were such that after a\r\nwhile she even succeeded in convincing little Rose Lake of the perfect\r\nreasonableness, and indeed necessity, of sacrificing herself to the\r\npublic interests of the community. "As for enjoying it," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks said, "that is quite a different matter. Now and then\r\nperhaps for a minute one enjoys it; but that is not what I am thinking\r\nof. One owes something to one\'s fellow-creatures, you know; and if it\r\nmade the evening go off well, I should not mind in the least to be\r\nhustled up in a corner and contradicted. To be sure, I don\'t remember\r\nthat it ever happened to me; but then I have such luck; and I am sure I\r\ngive you full leave to box the Archdeacon\'s ears next Thursday; or to\r\ntell him he does not know anything in the world about art," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks thoughtfully, with a new combination rising in her mind.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Lucilla," said Rose, "but I shall not come back again. I am\r\nmuch obliged to you. It does not do for people who have work to do. My\r\ntime is all I have, and I cannot afford to waste it, especially----"\r\n\r\n"Rose," said Miss Marjoribanks, "how are you ever to be an artist if you\r\ndo not know life? That is just the very reason why you ought to go out\r\ninto the world; and I don\'t see, for my part, that it matters whether it\r\nis pleasant or not. To practise scales all day long is anything but\r\npleasant, but then one has to do it, you know. I don\'t blame you," said\r\nLucilla, with tender condescension. "You are a dear little thing, and\r\nyou don\'t know any better; but _I_ went through Political Economy, and\r\nlearnt all about that;--you don\'t think _I_ choose it for the pleasure?\r\nBut you all know what is the object of my life, and I hope I am not one\r\nto shrink from my duty," Miss Marjoribanks added. And it was difficult\r\nto reply to such a sublime declaration. Little Rose left her friend with\r\nthe conviction that it was her duty, too, to sacrifice herself for the\r\nbenefit of society and the advancement of art. Such were the lofty\r\nsentiments elicited naturally, as enthusiasm responds to enthusiasm, by\r\nLucilla\'s self-devotion. Already, although she was not much more than\r\ntwenty, she had the consoling consciousness that she had wrought a great\r\nwork in Carlingford; and if Miss Marjoribanks required a little\r\nsacrifice from her assistants, she did not shrink from making the same\r\nin her own person, as has been shadowed forth in the case of Mr\r\nCavendish, and as will yet, in the course of this history, be still more\r\nseriously and even sadly evolved.\r\n\r\nThree weeks had passed in this way, making it still more and more\r\nvisible to Lucilla how much she had lost in losing Mr Cavendish, of whom\r\nnothing as yet had been heard, when suddenly, one day, about\r\nluncheon-time, at the hour when Miss Marjoribanks was known to be at\r\nhome, the drawing-room door opened without any warning, and the missing\r\nman walked in. It was thus that Lucilla herself described the unexpected\r\napparition, which appeared to her to have dropped from the clouds. She\r\navowed afterwards to Mrs Chiley that his entrance was so utterly\r\nunexpected, so noiseless, and without warning, that she felt quite\r\nsilly, and could not tell in the least how she behaved; though the\r\nfriends of Miss Marjoribanks, it is to be hoped, are too well acquainted\r\nwith her promptitude of mind and action to imagine that she in any way\r\ncompromised herself even under the surprise of the moment. As for Mr\r\nCavendish, he exhibited a certain mixture of timidity and excitement\r\nwhich it was remarkable, and indeed rather flattering for any lady to\r\nsee, in such an accomplished man of the world. Lucilla was not a person\r\nto deceive herself, nor did she want experience in such matters, as has\r\nbeen already shown; but it would be vain to deny that the conviction\r\nforced upon her mind by the demeanour of her visitor was that it was a\r\nman _about to propose_ who thus made his unlooked-for appearance before\r\nher. She confessed afterwards to her confidential friend that he had all\r\nthe signs of it in his looks and manners. "He gave that little nervous\r\ncough," Lucilla said, "and pulled his cravat _just so_, and stared into\r\nhis hat as if he had it all written down there; and looked as They\r\nalways look," Miss Marjoribanks added, with a touch of natural contempt.\r\nNor was this all the change in Mr Cavendish\'s appearance. He had managed\r\nmiraculously in his month\'s absence to grow the most charming little\r\nmoustache and beard, which were, to be sure, slightly red, like most\r\npeople\'s. It gleamed into Miss Marjoribanks\'s mind in a moment that\r\npeople did such things sometimes by way of disguising themselves; but\r\nif such had been Mr Cavendish\'s intention, it had utterly failed, since\r\nhe seemed rather more like himself than before, in Lucilla\'s opinion,\r\nand certainly was more likely to attract attention, since beards were\r\nnot so usual in these days. They met on the very spot where Lucilla had\r\nseen him last, with that look of insane terror on his handsome face. And\r\nthe Archdeacon was still in Carlingford, if it was he who had occasioned\r\nsuch a panic. Mr Cavendish came in as if he had never been absent, as if\r\nhe had seen Miss Marjoribanks on the previous night, and had no fear of\r\nanything in the world but of failing to please her; and Lucilla\r\nfortunately saw the nature of the position, and was not to be put out\r\neven by such an emergency. Of course, under the circumstances, to accept\r\nhim was utterly out of the question; but, at the same time, Lucilla did\r\nnot feel it expedient, without much more distinct information, to put a\r\ndefinitive and cruel negative on Mr Cavendish\'s hopes. As for Barbara\r\nLake, that was a trifle not worth thinking of; and, notwithstanding that\r\nthere was something rather unaccountable in his conduct, he was still\r\nthe probable member for Carlingford, just, as Mrs Chiley so often said,\r\nthe position which, of all others, she would have chosen for Lucilla; so\r\nthat Miss Marjoribanks was not prepared, without due consideration, to\r\nbring the matter to a final end.\r\n\r\nWhile Lucilla made this rapid summary of affairs and took her stand in\r\nher own mind, Mr Cavendish had taken a chair and had opened the\r\nconversation. He hoped he had not been entirely forgotten, though a\r\nfortnight\'s absence was a severe tax on anybody\'s memory----\r\n\r\n"A fortnight!" said Miss Marjoribanks; "how happy you must have been\r\nwhile you have been away!--for I assure you a month is a month at\r\nCarlingford; and one does not get such ornaments in two weeks," said\r\nLucilla, putting her hand to her chin, which made Mr Cavendish laugh,\r\nand look more nervous than ever.\r\n\r\n"It is a souvenir of where I have been," he said. "I could imagine I had\r\nbeen gone two years, judging by my own feelings. I am so pleased to see\r\nthat you remember how long it is. I dare say it looked a little droll\r\nrunning away so, but I dared not trust myself with leave-takings," Mr\r\nCavendish said, with an air of sentiment. "I have been watching over a\r\npoor friend of mine on his sick-bed. He was once very good to me, and\r\nwhen he sent for me I could not delay or refuse him. I found he had\r\ntelegraphed for me when I got home the last Thursday evening I was\r\nhere," he continued, looking Lucilla full in the face with the candour\r\nof conscious truth--though, to be sure, when people are stating a simple\r\nfact, it is seldom that they take the pains to be so particular. "I\r\nstarted by the night-train, and crossed the Channel while you were all\r\nfast asleep. I wonder if any one gave me a thought," continued Mr\r\nCavendish; and it was still more and more impressed upon Lucilla that he\r\nhad all the signs of a man who had come to propose.\r\n\r\n"I cannot say about that night in particular, but I am sure a great many\r\npeople have given you a thought," said Miss Marjoribanks. "We have all\r\nbeen wondering what had become of you, where you were, and when you were\r\ncoming back. So far as I am concerned, I have missed you dreadfully,"\r\nsaid Lucilla, with her usual openness; and she really thought for a\r\nmoment that Mr Cavendish in a sudden transport was going down on his\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n"I scarcely hoped for so much happiness," he said; and though he kept up\r\nthe tone proper to good society, which might mean sport or earnest\r\naccording as the occasion required, there was a certain air of gratitude\r\nand tenderness in his face which sent Lucilla\'s active mind a-wondering.\r\n"He is thinking of the music-stand," she said to herself, and then went\r\non with what she was saying; for though Miss Marjoribanks had a very\r\ngood opinion of herself, it had not occurred to her that Mr Cavendish\r\nwas very deeply in love--with _her_, at all events.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes--not only for the flirting, you know, which of itself is a\r\ndreadful loss; but then you were so good in keeping the gentlemen to\r\ntheir duty. I missed you dreadfully--there has been nobody at all to\r\nhelp me," said Lucilla. Her tone was so genuinely plaintive that Mr\r\nCavendish grew more and more moved. He put down his hat, he cleared his\r\nthroat, he got up and walked to the window--evidently he was getting up\r\nhis courage for the last step.\r\n\r\n"But I heard you had some distinguished strangers here," he said, coming\r\nback to his seat without having, as it appeared, made up his mind. "My\r\nsister wrote--that is to say I heard--I really don\'t remember how I got\r\nthe news; a dean, or bishop, or something----?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Mr Archdeacon Beverley; he came precisely the night you went\r\naway," said Lucilla. "Didn\'t you see him? I thought you stayed till\r\nafter he came into the room. A nice clergyman is very nice, you know;\r\nbut, after all, a man who has some experience in society--and we have\r\nhad no music to speak of since you went away. Poor dear Barbara has had\r\nsuch a bad cold. In short, we have all been at sixes and sevens; and the\r\nArchdeacon----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind the Archdeacon," said Mr Cavendish, and Miss\r\nMarjoribanks felt that he had not winced at the name, though he did\r\nglance up at her in spite of himself with a little gleam in his eyes\r\nwhen she mentioned Barbara Lake. Perhaps this was because he knew\r\nnothing about the Archdeacon, perhaps because he was prepared to hear\r\nthe Archdeacon named. Lucilla did not give him all the benefit of the\r\nuncertainty, for she began to get a little impatient, and to wonder, if\r\nthe man had come to propose, as appearances suggested, why he did not do\r\nit and get done with it?--which was a very reasonable question. This\r\ntime, however, it certainly was coming. "I don\'t like nice clergymen,"\r\nsaid Mr Cavendish, "especially not when it is _you_ who find them so. If\r\nI could really flatter myself that you missed me----"\r\n\r\n"We all did," said Lucilla; "there is no compliment about it; and poor\r\ndear Barbara has had such a cold----"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the unfortunate aspirant; and once more he gave a doubtful\r\nglance at Lucilla--decidedly the name of Barbara had more effect upon\r\nhim than that of the Archdeacon. It seemed to damp his fire and smother\r\nthe words on his lips, and he had to take another promenade to the\r\nwindow to recover himself. After that, however, he came back evidently\r\nwound up and determined; and his eyes, as he returned to Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s side, fell upon the music-stand by means of which she had\r\ncovered his fright and flight (if it was not a mere hallucination on\r\nLucilla\'s part that he had been frightened and had fled) on the night he\r\nleft Carlingford. He came back with the air of a man who means to delay\r\nand deliberate no more.\r\n\r\n"If I could flatter myself that _you_ had missed me," he said;\r\n"_you_--not any one else--I might have the courage to ask----"\r\n\r\nIt was at that precise moment of all moments that Mrs Chiley, whom they\r\nhad not heard coming upstairs, though she was sufficiently audible,\r\nsuddenly opened the door. Mr Cavendish, as was natural, broke off in a\r\nmoment with a face which had turned crimson, and even Lucilla herself\r\nfelt a little annoyed and put out, when, as in duty bound, she got up to\r\nmeet and welcome her old friend. One thing was fortunate, as Miss\r\nMarjoribanks afterwards reflected, that since it was to be interrupted,\r\nit had been interrupted so early, before he could have put himself in\r\nany ridiculous attitude, for example; for at such moments it is well\r\nknown that some men go down upon their knees--or at least such is the\r\nineradicable belief of womankind. If Mr Cavendish had been on his\r\nknees--though, to tell the truth, he was not a very likely subject--the\r\nposition would have been much more embarrassing. But as it was, there\r\nwas an end. _He_ turned back again to the window, biting his glove in\r\nthe most frantic way, and taking up his hat, while _she_, always\r\nmistress of the position, advanced to the new-comer with outstretched\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n"I know you have come to have lunch with me," said Lucilla. "You are\r\nalways so nice--just when I wanted you; for, of course, I dared not have\r\nasked Mr Cavendish to go downstairs if I had been all alone."\r\n\r\n"Mr Cavendish!" cried the old lady, with a little scream. "So he has\r\nreally come back! I am so glad to see you. I can\'t tell you how glad I\r\nam to see you; and, I declare, with a beard! Oh, you need not blush for\r\nwhat I say. I am old enough to be both your grandmothers, and I am so\r\nglad to see you together again!" said Mrs Chiley, with an imprudent\r\neffusion of sentiment. And it may be imagined what the effect of this\r\nutterance was upon the suitor whose love-making (if he was really going\r\nto make love) was thus cut short in the bud. He coughed more than ever\r\nwhen he shook hands with the new-comer, and kept fast hold of his hat\r\nwith that despairing grasp which is common to men in trouble. And then\r\nhe kept looking at the door, as if he expected some one else to come in,\r\nor wanted to escape; and so far from following up his interrupted\r\naddress by any explanatory or regretful glances, he never even looked at\r\nLucilla, which, to be sure, struck her as odd enough.\r\n\r\n"Miss Marjoribanks is very good," he said, "and I am very glad to see\r\nyou so soon after my return, Mrs Chiley--though, of course, I should\r\nhave called; but I may have to go away in a day or two; and I am afraid\r\nI cannot have the pleasure of staying to lunch."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you must stay," said Mrs Chiley; "I want to hear all about it.\r\nGo away again in a day or two? If I were Lucilla I would not let you go\r\naway. She is queen now in Carlingford, you know;--and then poor old Mr\r\nChiltern is so ill. I hope you won\'t think of going away. They all say\r\nit would be such a pity if anything happened to him while you were away.\r\nTell me where you have been, and what you have been doing all this time.\r\nWe have missed you so dreadfully. And now you look quite like a military\r\nman with that beard."\r\n\r\n"I have been nursing a sick friend--on the Continent," said Mr\r\nCavendish; "not very cheerful work. I am sorry about Mr Chiltern, but I\r\ncannot help it. I have doubts now whether, even if he were to die, I\r\nshould offer myself. I couldn\'t give pledges to all the shopkeepers\r\nabout my opinions," said the embarrassed man; and as he spoke, he put\r\nhis hat against his breast like a buckler. "I must not detain you from\r\nyour lunch. Good-bye, Miss Marjoribanks; I am very sorry I can\'t stay."\r\n\r\n"But, dear me, stop a minute--don\'t run away from us," said Mrs Chiley.\r\n"Come and talk it all over with the Colonel, there is a dear--and don\'t\r\ndo anything rash. Good-bye, if you _will_ go," said the old lady. She\r\nsat with a look of consternation in her face, looking at Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, as he made his way downstairs. "Did I come in at a wrong\r\ntime, Lucilla?" said Mrs Chiley, in distress. "Have you refused him, my\r\ndear? What is the matter? I am so dreadfully afraid I came in at the\r\nwrong time."\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley," said Lucilla sweetly, "you can never come in at a\r\nwrong time; and it is just as well, on the whole, that he didn\'t--for I\r\nwas not prepared to give him any answer. I am sure, on the contrary, it\r\nwas quite providential," Miss Marjoribanks said; but it may be doubted\r\nwhether Lucilla\'s mind perfectly corresponded to her words on this\r\noccasion, though she was so amiable about it, as Mrs Chiley afterwards\r\nsaid. For even when a woman has not her answer ready, she has always a\r\ncertain curiosity about a proposal; and then when such a delicate matter\r\nis crushed in the bud like this, who can tell if it will ever blossom\r\nagain, and find full expression? Miss Marjoribanks could not be said to\r\nbe disappointed, but unquestionably she regretted a little that he had\r\nnot been permitted to say out his say. As for Mrs Chiley, when she\r\nunderstood all the rights of it, she was afflicted beyond measure, and\r\ncould not forgive herself for the unlucky part she had played.\r\n\r\n"If you had only said you were engaged," the old lady exclaimed, "or not\r\nat home--or anything, Lucilla! You know, you need never stand on\r\nceremony with me. No wonder he looked as if he could eat me! Poor\r\nfellow! and I dare say he has gone away with his heart full," said Mrs\r\nChiley, with the tenderest sympathy. She could not get over it, nor eat\r\nany lunch, nor think of anything else. "Poor dear boy! He need not have\r\nbeen so put out with an old woman like me. He might have known if he had\r\ngiven me the least hint, or even a look, I would have gone away," said\r\nthe kind old woman. "But you must be all the kinder to him when he comes\r\nback, Lucilla. And, my dear, if I were you, I would stay in this\r\nafternoon. He is sure to come back, and I would not keep him in pain."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he will come back," Lucilla could not help saying; for\r\nshe had a conviction that nothing more would come of it; but\r\nnevertheless she did stay in that afternoon, and received several\r\nvisits, but saw nothing more of Mr Cavendish. It was rather vexatious,\r\nto tell the truth; for to see a man so near the point and not even to\r\nhave the satisfaction of refusing him, is naturally aggravating to a\r\nwoman. But Miss Marjoribanks had far too much philosophy as well as good\r\nsense to be vexed on that account with Mrs Chiley, who could not forgive\r\nherself, and to make up for the consequences of her unlucky visit, would\r\nhave done anything in the world. The old lady herself returned in the\r\nafternoon to know the result, and was doubly vexed and distressed to\r\nhear he had not come back.\r\n\r\n"I ought to be on the Archdeacon\'s side, Lucilla," she said, with tears\r\nin her eyes. "I know I ought, when it was I that brought him here: but I\r\ncan\'t help feeling for the other, my dear. He always was so nice--a\r\ngreat deal nicer, to my way of thinking, than Mr Beverley; not to say\r\nbut that the Archdeacon is very agreeable," Mrs Chiley added,\r\nrecollecting herself; for in matters of that description a woman of\r\nexperience is aware that she cannot be too particular about what she\r\nsays; and supposing that Mr Cavendish did not come back, it would never\r\ndo to prejudice Lucilla against the other candidate. "I never blamed Mr\r\nCavendish about that Lake girl," the old lady continued. "It was not his\r\nfault, poor young man. I know he was always devoted to you in his heart;\r\nand to think he should come here the very first place as soon as he\r\nreturned! I only wish I had had one of my headaches this morning, my\r\ndear, to keep me indoors for an old Malaprop. I do indeed, Lucilla. It\r\nwould have served me right, and I should not have minded the pain."\r\n\r\n"But indeed I don\'t wish anything of the sort," said Miss Marjoribanks.\r\n"I would not have the best man in the world at the cost of one of those\r\ndreadful headaches of yours. It is so good of you to say so; but you\r\nknow very well it is not that sort of thing I am thinking of. If I were\r\nto go off and marry just now, after all that has been done to the\r\ndrawing-room and everything, I should feel as if I were swindling papa;\r\nand it is the object of my life to be a comfort to _him_."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear," said Mrs Chiley, "but we must not neglect your own\r\ninterest for all that. I think it is most likely he will come this\r\nevening. He has just come from the Continent, you know, where people do\r\nmake calls in the evening. I meant to have asked you to come down to us,\r\nas we shall be all alone----"\r\n\r\n"All alone? Then where is the Archdeacon?" asked Lucilla.\r\n\r\n"He has gone out to Sir John\'s for a day or two, my dear," said Mrs\r\nChiley, and she could not understand the little gleam of intelligence\r\nthat shot into Lucilla\'s eye. "He left word with me for you that he\r\nwould be sure to be back before Thursday, but seeing Mr Cavendish when I\r\ncame in made me forget all about it. He would be quite distressed, poor\r\nman! if he thought I had forgotten to give you his message. I won\'t ask\r\nyou now to come down and cheer me up a little, Lucilla. I think poor Mr\r\nCavendish is sure to come this evening, and I will not stand in his way\r\nagain. But, my dear, you must send me a little note after he has been.\r\nNow promise. I shall be quite in suspense all night."\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley, I don\'t think he will come," said Miss Marjoribanks.\r\n"For my part, I think it was providential your coming to-day--for I am\r\nsure I don\'t know what I should have said to him. And it is so odd the\r\nArchdeacon should be away just at this moment. I feel quite sure he will\r\nnot come to-night."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing odd about the Archdeacon," said Mrs Chiley. "It was\r\nfor to-day he was asked, you know; _that_ is simple enough. If you are\r\nsure that you prefer the Archdeacon, my dear----" the old lady added,\r\nwith an anxious look. But Lucilla cut short the inquiry, which was\r\nbecoming too serious, by bringing her kind visitor a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t think I prefer any of them," said the injured maiden.\r\n"If I had been thinking of that sort of thing, you know, I need never\r\nhave come home. If they would only let one do one\'s duty in peace and\r\nquiet," said Lucilla, with a sigh; and to tell the truth, both the\r\nladies had occasion on that trying afternoon for the consolation of\r\ntheir cup of tea. But while they were thus refreshing themselves, a\r\nconversation of a very different kind, yet affecting the same interests,\r\nwas being carried on not very far off, under the shelter of a little\r\nflowery arbour in another of the embowered gardens of Grange Lane, where\r\nthe subject was just then being discussed from the other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XX_\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Woodburn\'s house, everybody admitted, was one of the nicest in\r\nCarlingford; but that was not so visible out of doors as in. He was a\r\ngreat amateur of flowers and fruit, and had his garden lined on each\r\nside with greenhouses, which were no doubt very fine in their way, but\r\nsomewhat spoiled the garden, which had not in the least the homely,\r\nluxuriant, old-fashioned look of the other gardens, where, for the most\r\npart, the flowers and shrubs grew as if they liked it and were at\r\nhome--whereas Mr Woodburn\'s flower-beds were occupied only by\r\ntenants-at-will; but at one corner near the house there was a little\r\narbour, so covered up and heaped over with clematis that even the Scotch\r\ngardener had not the heart to touch it. The mass was so perfect and yet\r\nso light that it was the most perfect hiding-place imaginable; and\r\nnobody who had not been in it could have suspected that there was a\r\npossibility of getting inside. Here Mrs Woodburn and Mr Cavendish were\r\nseated on this particular afternoon; she very eager, animated, and in\r\nearnest, he silent and leaning his head on his two hands in a sort of\r\ndowncast, fallen way. Mrs Woodburn had one of her lively eyes on the\r\ngarden that nobody might enter unseen, and for this once was "taking\r\noff" no one, but was most emphatically and unquestionably herself.\r\n\r\n"So you did not do it," she said. "Why didn\'t you do it? when you knew\r\nso much depended upon it! You know I did not wish for it myself, at\r\nfirst. But now since this man has come, and you have got into such a\r\npanic, and never will have the courage to face it out----"\r\n\r\n"How can I have the courage to face it out?" said Mr Cavendish, with a\r\ngroan. "It is all very easy for a woman to speak who has only to\r\ncriticise other people. If you had to do it yourself----"\r\n\r\n"Ah, if I only had!" cried the sister. "You may be sure I would not make\r\nso much fuss. After all, what is there to do? Take your place in\r\nsociety, which you have worked for and won as honestly as anybody ever\r\nwon it, and look another man in the face who is not half so clever nor\r\nso sensible as you are. Why, what can he say? If I only could do it,\r\nyou may be sure I should not lose any time."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mr Cavendish, lifting his head. "To be sure, you\'re a\r\nmimic--you can assume any part you like; but I am not so clever. I tell\r\nyou again, the only thing I can do is to go away----"\r\n\r\n"Run away, you mean," said Mrs Woodburn. "I should be foolish, indeed,\r\nif I were trusting to your cleverness to assume a part. My dear good\r\nbrother, you would find it impossible to put yourself sufficiently in\r\nsympathy with another," cried the mimic, in the Archdeacon\'s very tone,\r\nwith a laugh, and at the same time a little snarl of bitter contempt.\r\n\r\n"Oh, for Heaven\'s sake, Nelly, no foolery just now," said Mr Cavendish.\r\n"I don\'t understand how you can be so heartless. To mimic a man who has\r\nmy position, my reputation, my very existence in his hands!"\r\n\r\n"Have you murdered anybody?" said Mrs Woodburn, with intense scorn.\r\n"Have you robbed anybody? If you have, I can understand all this stuff.\r\nHe is the very man to mimic, on the contrary. I\'d like to let you see\r\nhim as he was on that famous occasion when he delivered his opinions on\r\nart in Lucilla\'s drawing-room. Look here," said the mimic, putting one\r\nhand behind an imaginary coat tail, and with the other holding up a\r\nvisionary drawing to the light; but this was more than her audience\r\ncould bear.\r\n\r\n"I think you must have vowed to drive me crazy," cried the exasperated\r\nbrother. "Put aside for once that confounded vanity of yours--as if a\r\nman had always leisure to look at your playing the fool." While he spoke\r\nin this unusual way, he got up, as was natural, and took one or two\r\nsteps across the narrow space which was shut in by those luxuriant heaps\r\nof clematis; and Mrs Woodburn, for her part, withdrew her chair out of\r\nhis way in equal heat and indignation.\r\n\r\n"You have always the leisure to play the fool yourselves, you men," she\r\nsaid. "Vanity, indeed! as if it were not simply to show you that one can\r\nlaugh at him without being stricken with thunder. But leave that if you\r\nlike. You know quite well if you married Lucilla Marjoribanks that there\r\nwould be no more about it. There _could_ be no more about it. Why, all\r\nGrange Lane would be in a sort of way pledged to you. I don\'t mean to\r\nsay _I_ am attached to Lucilla, but you used to be, or to give yourself\r\nout for being. You flirted with her dreadfully in the winter, I\r\nremember, when those terrible Woodburns were here," she continued, with\r\na shiver. "If you married Lucilla and got into Parliament, you might\r\nlaugh at all the archdeacons in the world."\r\n\r\n"It is very easy for a woman to talk," said the reluctant wooer again.\r\n\r\n"I can tell you something it is not easy to do," cried his sister. "It\r\nis frightfully hard for a woman to stand by and see a set of men making\r\na mess of things, and not to dare to say a word till all is spoiled.\r\nWhat is this Archdeacon, I would like to know, or what could he say? If\r\nyou only would have the least courage, and look him in the face, he\r\nwould be disabled. As if no one had ever heard of mistaken identity\r\nbefore? And in the meantime go and see Lucilla, and get her consent. I\r\ncan\'t do that for you; but I could do a great deal of the rest, if you\r\nwould only have a little pluck and not give in like this."\r\n\r\n"A _little_ pluck, by George!" cried the unfortunate man, and he threw\r\nhimself down again upon his chair. "I am not in love with Lucilla\r\nMarjoribanks, and I don\'t want to marry her," he added doggedly, and sat\r\nbeating a tune with his fingers on the table, with but a poorly-assumed\r\nair of indifference. As for Mrs Woodburn, she regarded him with a look\r\nof contempt.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you will tell me who you are in love with," she said\r\ndisdainfully; "but I did not ask to be taken into your confidence in\r\nsuch an interesting way. What I wish to know is, whether you want a wife\r\nwho will keep your position for you. I am not in the least fond of her,\r\nbut she is very clever. Whether you want the support of all the best\r\npeople in Carlingford, and connections that would put _all that_ to\r\nsilence, and a real position of your own which nobody could interfere\r\nwith--that is what I want to know, Harry; as for the sentimental part, I\r\nam not so much interested about that," said Mrs Woodburn, with a\r\ncontemptuous smile. She was young still, and she was handsome in her way\r\n(for people who liked that style), and it jarred a little on the natural\r\nfeelings to hear a young wife express herself so disdainfully; but, to\r\nbe sure, her brother was not unaccustomed to that.\r\n\r\n"You said once that Woodburn was necessary to your happiness," he said,\r\nwith a mixture of scorn and appeal, "though I can\'t say I saw it, for my\r\npart."\r\n\r\n"Did I?" she said, with a slight shrug of her shoulders; "I saw what\r\nwas necessary on another score, as you don\'t seem to do. When a man has\r\nnobody belonging to him, it is connections he ought to try for: and\r\nLucilla has very good connections; and it would be as good as securing\r\nthe support of Grange Lane. Do it for my sake, Harry, if you won\'t do it\r\nfor your own," said Mrs Woodburn, with a change of tone. "If you were to\r\nlet things be said, and give people an advantage, think what would\r\nbecome of me. Woodburn would not mind so much if somebody else were\r\ninvolved; but oh, Harry! if he should find out _he_ had been cheated,\r\nand he only----"\r\n\r\n"He was not cheated! You were always a great deal too good for him,\r\nNelly," said Mr Cavendish, touched at last at an effectual point; "and\r\nas for _his_ friends and family, and all that----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, please, don\'t speak of them," said Mrs Woodburn, with a shudder;\r\n"but there are only two of us in the world; and, Harry, for my sake----"\r\n\r\nAt this appeal Mr Cavendish got up again, and began to pace the little\r\narbour, two steps to the wall, and two steps back again. "I told you I\r\nhad almost done it, when that confounded old woman came in," he said:\r\n"that could not be called my fault?"\r\n\r\n"And she said she was both your grandmothers," said the mimic, with a\r\nslightly hysterical laugh, in Mrs Chiley\'s voice. "I know how she did\r\nit. She can\'t be there still, you know--go now and try."\r\n\r\n"Let alone a little; don\'t hurry a fellow," said her brother, somewhat\r\nsullenly; "a man can\'t move himself up to the point of proposing twice\r\nin one day."\r\n\r\n"Then promise that you will do it to-morrow," said Mrs Woodburn. "I\r\nshall have to go in, for there is somebody coming. Harry, before I go,\r\npromise that you will do it to-morrow, for my sake."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother!" said Mr Cavendish; and it was all the answer he deigned to\r\ngive before Mrs Woodburn was called away, notwithstanding the adjuration\r\nshe addressed to him. It was then getting late, too late, even had he\r\nbeen disposed for such an exertion, to try his fortunes again that day,\r\nand Lucilla\'s allusion had given him a great longing to see Barbara once\r\nmore before his sacrifice was accomplished. Not that it was such a great\r\nsacrifice, after all. For Mr Cavendish was quite aware that Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was a far more suitable match for him than Barbara Lake,\r\nand he was not even disposed to offer himself and his name and fortune,\r\nsuch as they were, to the drawing-master\'s daughter. But, to tell the\r\ntruth, he was not a person of fixed and settled sentiments, as he ought\r\nto have been in order to triumph, as his sister desired, over the\r\ndifficulties of his position. Perhaps Mrs Woodburn herself would have\r\ndone just the same, had it been she from whom action was demanded. But\r\nshe was capable of much more spirited and determined conduct in theory,\r\nas was natural, and thought she could have done a great deal better, as\r\nso many women do.\r\n\r\nMr Cavendish lounged about the garden a little, with his hands in his\r\npockets, and then strayed out quite accidentally, and in the same\r\nunpremeditating mood made his way to Grove Street. He meant nothing by\r\nit, and did not even inquire of himself where he was going, but only\r\nstrolled out to take the air a little. And it was better to go up to the\r\nhigher parts of the town than to linger here about Grange Lane, where\r\nall the people he knew might pass, and stop to talk and ask him where he\r\nhad been, and worry his life out. And surely he had had enough of bother\r\nfor one day. By this time it was getting dark, and it was very pleasant\r\nin Grove Street, where most of the good people had just watered their\r\nlittle gardens, and brought out the sweetness of the mignonette. Mr\r\nCavendish was not sentimental, but still the hour was not without its\r\ninfluence; and when he looked at the lights that began to appear in the\r\nparlour windows, and breathed in the odours from the little gardens, it\r\nis not to be denied that he asked himself for a moment what was the good\r\nof going through all this bother and vexation, and whether love in a\r\ncottage, with a little garden full of mignonette and a tolerable amount\r\nof comfort within, was not, after all, a great deal more reasonable than\r\nit looked at first sight? This, however, it must be allowed, was no\r\nconclusion arrived at on sufficient premises, and with the calmness that\r\nbefitted such an important argument, but the mere suggestion, by the\r\nway, of an impatient, undecided mind, that did always what at the moment\r\nit found most agreeable to do, and reflected afterwards, when the moment\r\nof repentance, not of reflection, had arrived.\r\n\r\nHe had paused by instinct under a lamp not yet lighted, which was almost\r\nopposite Mr Lake\'s house; and it was not his fault if he saw at the\r\nupper window a figure looking out, like Mariana, and sighing, "He cometh\r\nnot." Naturally the figure was concerned to find out who he was, and\r\n_he_ was anxious to find out who was the figure. And, on the whole, it\r\nwas in a very innocent manner that this entirely natural curiosity was\r\nsatisfied. First the window was opened a little--a very little, just\r\nenough to change the air--and Mr Cavendish down below heard the voice of\r\nBarbara singing softly up above, which settled the matter as to her\r\nidentity. As to _his_, Barbara had never, from the first moment she\r\nperceived him, any doubt of that. Her heart leaped back, as she thought,\r\nto its right place when she first caught sight of that blessed\r\napparition; and with her heart came the orange-flowers, and the wedding\r\nbreakfast, and the veil of real Brussels for which Barbara had so much\r\nwept. She tried to sing something that would convey hope and assurance\r\nto her timid lover, according to romantic precedent; but her mind was\r\nfar from being a prompt one, as has been said. Thus it was all in the\r\nmost natural way that it came about. When Mr Cavendish felt quite sure\r\nwho it was, he took off his hat, which was only civil, and made a step\r\nor two forward; and then Barbara took the extreme step of going down to\r\nthe door. No doubt it was an extreme step. Nothing but a great public\r\naim, like that of Miss Marjoribanks, could have justified such a\r\nmeasure; but then Barbara, if she had not a great public, had at least a\r\ndecided personal, purpose, and obeyed the impulse of that mingled\r\ninclination towards another and determination to have her own way, which\r\nin such a mind calls itself passion, and which sometimes, by sheer force\r\nof will, succeeds better than either genius or calculation. She went\r\ndown to the door, all palpitating with renewed hope, and, at the same\r\ntime, with the dread that he might escape her in the moment which was\r\nnecessary for her passage downstairs. But when she opened the door and\r\nappeared with her cheeks glowing, and her eyes blazing, and her heart\r\nthumping in her breast, in the midst of that quiet twilight, the object\r\nof her hopes was still there. He had even advanced a little, with an\r\ninstinctive sense of her approach; and thus they met, the street being\r\ncomparatively quiet just then, and the mignonette perfuming the air. To\r\nbe sure, the poetry of the situation was of a homely order, for it was\r\nunder a lamp-post instead of a tree that the lover had placed himself;\r\nand it was not the dew, but the watering, that had brought out the odour\r\nof the mignonette; but then neither of the two were very poetical\r\npersonages, and the accessories did perfectly well for them.\r\n\r\n"Is it you, Mr Cavendish? Goodness! I could not think who it was," cried\r\nBarbara, out of breath.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is I. I thought, if I had an opportunity, I would ask how you\r\nwere--before I go away again," said the imprudent man. He did not want\r\nto commit himself, but at the same time he was disposed to take the\r\nbenefit of his position as a hero on the eve of departure. "I heard you\r\nhad been ill."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no--not ill," said Barbara; and then she added, taking breath, "I\r\nam quite well now. Won\'t you come in?"\r\n\r\nThis was the perfectly simple and natural manner in which it occurred.\r\nThere was nobody in, and Barbara did not see, any more than her lover\r\ndid, why she should sacrifice any of her advantages. They were, on the\r\nwhole, quite well matched, and stood in need of no special protection on\r\neither side. Though naturally Barbara, who felt by this time as if she\r\ncould almost see the pattern of the real Brussels, had a much more\r\nserious object in view than Mr Cavendish, who went in only because it\r\nwas a pleasant thing to do at the moment, and offered him a little\r\nrefuge from himself and his deliberations, and the decision which it was\r\nso necessary to come to. Thus it happened that when Mr Lake and Rose\r\ncame in from the evening walk they had been taking together, they found,\r\nto their great amazement, Barbara in the little parlour, singing to Mr\r\nCavendish, who had forgotten all about Grange Lane, and his dangers, and\r\nhis hopes of better fortune, and was quite as much contented with the\r\nmellow contralto that delighted his ears, and the blazing scarlet bloom,\r\nand black level brows that pleased his eyes, as anybody could have\r\ndesired. To be sure, he had not even yet given a thought to the wedding\r\nbreakfast, which was all arranged already in the mind of the enchantress\r\nwho thus held him in thrall; but perhaps that may be best accounted for\r\nby referring it to one of those indefinable peculiarities of difference\r\nthat exist between the mind of woman and that of man.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Lake and his daughter came in from their walk, and their talk\r\nabout Willie, and about art, and about the "effects" and "bits" which\r\nRose and her father mutually pointed out to each other, to find this\r\nunexpected conjunction in the parlour, their surprise, and indeed\r\nconsternation, may be imagined. But it was only in the mind of Rose that\r\nthe latter sentiment existed. As for Mr Lake, he had long made up his\r\nmind how, as he said, "a man of superior position" ought to be received\r\nwhen he made his appearance in an artist\'s house. Perhaps, to tell the\r\ntruth, he forgot for the moment that his visitor was young, and his\r\ndaughter very handsome, and that it was to visit Barbara and not himself\r\nthat Mr Cavendish had come. The little drawing-master would not suffer\r\nhimself to be seduced by thoughts which were apart from the subject from\r\ncarrying out his principles. When Mr Cavendish rose up confused, with a\r\nlook of being caught and found out, Mr Lake held out his hand to him\r\nwith perfect suavity--"I have the pleasure of knowing you only by\r\nsight," said the innocent father, "but I am very glad to make your\r\nacquaintance in my own house;" and as this was said with the conscious\r\ndignity of a man who knows that his house is not just an ordinary house,\r\nbut one that naturally the patrician portion of the community, if they\r\nonly knew it, would be glad to seek admittance to, the consequence was\r\nthat Mr Cavendish felt only the more and more confused.\r\n\r\n"I happened to be passing," he explained faintly, "and having heard that\r\nMiss Lake, whom I have had the pleasure of meeting----"\r\n\r\n"I assure you," said the drawing-master, "that I hail with satisfaction\r\nthe appearance of a gentleman whose intelligence I have heard so much\r\nof. We artists are a little limited, to be sure; for life, you know, is\r\nshort, and art is long, as the poet says; and our own occupation\r\nrequires so much of our thoughts. But still we are sympathetic, Mr\r\nCavendish. We can understand other subjects of study, though we cannot\r\nshare them. Yes, Barbara has been a little poorly--but she does not look\r\nas if there was much the matter with her to-night. Ask for the lamp,\r\nRose," said Mr Lake, with a little grandeur. There was no light in the\r\nroom except the candles at the piano, which lighted that corner and left\r\nthe rest of the apartment, small as it was, in comparative shade. There\r\nwas something magnificent in the idea of adding the lamp to that\r\nillumination; but then it is true that, as Mr Lake himself said, "every\r\nartist is a prodigal in his heart."\r\n\r\nRose had been standing all this time with her hat on, looking at Mr\r\nCavendish like a little Gorgon. What did he want here? How had he been\r\nadmitted? She scorned to go and interrogate the maid, which involved a\r\nkind of infidelity to her sister, but all the same she looked hard at Mr\r\nCavendish with a severity which had, on the whole, a reassuring effect\r\nupon him. For, to tell the truth, the benign reception which he was\r\nreceiving from Mr Lake, instead of setting the visitor at his ease,\r\nmade him nervous; for he was not in the least aware of the heroic soul\r\nwhich existed in the drawing-master\'s limited person. Mr Cavendish\r\nthought nothing but that he was being "caught," according to his own\r\nvulgar theory. He thought Barbara\'s father was cringing to him, and\r\nplaying the usual mean part of an interested parent who means to secure\r\na good match for his daughter. But as for Rose, she evidently, either\r\nfrom jealousy or some other reason, was not in the plot. She stood apart\r\nand scowled, as well as she knew how, upon the intruder. "I suppose,\r\npapa," said Rose, "Mr Cavendish wished to hear Barbara sing, and she has\r\nbeen singing. She is always very good-natured in that way; but as we\r\nhave none of us anything particular to do, I don\'t see what need we have\r\nfor a lamp."\r\n\r\nAt this trenchant speech Mr Cavendish rose. He was quite grateful to the\r\nlittle Preraphaelite for her incivility. It made him feel less as if he\r\nhad committed himself, and more as if he were an intruder, which was the\r\nmore agreeable suggestion of the two under the present circumstances.\r\n"You remind me that I should thank Miss Lake for letting me come in and\r\nhear once more her lovely voice," he said. "I am at present only a\r\nvisitor in Carlingford, and indeed in England--I may have to leave again\r\nin a day or two--good-bye. If I am still here, I shall hope to meet you\r\non Thursday." And then he pressed Barbara\'s hand, who, to tell the\r\ntruth, was very reluctant to let him go away.\r\n\r\n"If you must go----" she said, so low that her father could not hear\r\nher, though the vigilant, suspicious little Rose caught the sound, and\r\ncame a step nearer, like a little dragon, as Barbara was disposed to\r\nthink she was.\r\n\r\n"I _must_ go," murmured Mr Cavendish; "but I shall see you--we shall\r\nmeet." He dared not say another word, so alarming were the looks of the\r\nsmall Medusa, whose countenance he could see behind Barbara regarding\r\nthe parting. As for Mr Lake, he too regarded it with a momentary\r\ncuriosity. He did not quite understand how it was that his daughter and\r\nhis visitor could know each other well enough to communicate in this\r\nundertone.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to see so little of you," said Mr Lake. "I am afraid it is\r\nmy little girl\'s _brusque_ way of speaking that hastens your going. I\r\nassure you we were quite unoccupied, and would have been very\r\nhappy--perhaps we may be more fortunate another time;" and with that\r\nthe drawing-master gave a dignified dismissal to his surprising visitor.\r\nIt was Rose herself who saw Mr Cavendish to the door, which she opened\r\nfor him with an utter disregard of his excuses and attempts to do that\r\noffice for himself. She would not even shake hands, but made him the\r\nmost majestic curtsey that was ever executed by a personage five feet\r\nhigh, under the influence of which Mr Cavendish went away humbled, and,\r\nhe could scarcely tell why, ashamed of himself. When Rose came back to\r\nthe parlour, still with her hat on, she found that Barbara had gone to\r\nthe window, and was looking out at the edge of the blind--which was all\r\nthat was wanted to put a climax to her sister\'s exasperation.\r\n\r\n"Papa," said Rose, "I should like to know in your presence, or I should\r\nlike you to ask Barbara herself, what is the meaning of all that has\r\nbeen going on to-night."\r\n\r\nMr Lake turned right round at this appeal with an expression of utter\r\namaze and bewilderment, which at another moment would have struck Rose\r\nwith the profoundest delight as a study; and as for Barbara, without any\r\nmore ado she burst into a flood of passionate tears.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you nasty, envious thing! oh, you jealous, disagreeable thing!"\r\nsobbed the elder sister; "to send him away and spoil everything with\r\nyour airs! when he was as near--just as near"--but here Barbara\'s voice\r\nlost itself in her tears.\r\n\r\n"My dear, what does this mean?" said Mr Lake.\r\n\r\n"It means, papa, that she has encouraged him to come, and invited him\r\nin, and been singing to him," cried Rose. "To think she should be one of\r\nus, and have no proper pride! If he was fond of her, he would tell her\r\nso, and ask your permission; but she is laying herself out to please\r\n_him_, and is content that they should all jeer at her in Lucilla\'s\r\nparties, and say she is trying to catch him. I thought I could have died\r\nof shame when I saw him here to-night; and compromising you, as if that\r\nwas why you were so civil. If it were for her good, do you think _I_\r\nwould ever interfere?" cried Barbara\'s guardian angel. At this point\r\nRose herself would have liked excessively to cry, if the truth must be\r\ntold; but Barbara had already appropriated that facile mode of\r\nexpression, and the little artist scorned to copy. As for Mr Lake, he\r\nturned from one to the other of his daughters with unmitigated\r\nconsternation and dismay.\r\n\r\n"It was all your coming in," sobbed Barbara, "if you had only had the\r\nsense to see it. _That_ was what he meant. If I was singing, it was just\r\nto pass the time; I know that was what he came for. And you to send him\r\naway with your airs!" cried the injured young woman. All this made up a\r\nscene entirely novel to the amazed father, who felt it his duty to put a\r\nstop to it, and yet could not tell what to say.\r\n\r\n"Girls," he began, with a trembling voice, "this is all perfectly new to\r\nme. I don\'t understand. If Mr Cavendish, or--or any one, wishes to pay\r\nhis addresses to my daughter, it is, of course, his business to apply to\r\nme in the first place. Barbara, don\'t cry. You know how I dislike to\r\nhear you cry," said the poor man, gradually losing his head. "Don\'t make\r\na fuss, Rose; for Heaven\'s sake, girls, can\'t you say at once what you\r\nmean, and don\'t worry me to death? Ah, if your poor mother had but been\r\nspared!" cried the unfortunate widower; and he had five daughters\r\naltogether, poor soul!--and it was so easy to drive him out of his\r\nsenses. At this point Rose intervened, and did what she could to calm\r\nmatters down. Barbara, still sobbing, retired to her chamber; the boys\r\ncame in from their cricket, and the little children had to be put to\r\nbed; and there was no one to attend to all these matters, in the absence\r\nof the eldest sister, except the little mistress of the School of\r\nDesign, so that naturally all further explanation was postponed for this\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXI_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Mr Cavendish, without particularly meaning it,\r\nimpressed upon two interesting and amiable young women on the same day\r\nthe conviction that he was about to propose, without in either case\r\nrealising that expectation. After this last exploit he went home with\r\nhis head more confused, and his will more undecided, than ever. For he\r\nhad one of those perverse minds which cling to everything that is\r\nforbidden; and the idea that he ought not to have gone near Barbara\r\nLake, and that he ought not to see her again, made him more anxious to\r\nseek her out and follow her than he had ever been before. If such a\r\nthing had been permissible in England as that a man might marry one wife\r\nfor his liking and another for his interests, the matter might have been\r\ncompromised by proposing to them both; and there cannot be a doubt that\r\nLucilla, in such a case, would very soon have triumphed over her\r\nhandsome, sullen, passionate rival. But then such a way of conciliating\r\na man with himself does not exist in the British Islands, and\r\nconsequently was not to be thought of. And to be sure, every time he\r\ncame to think of it, Mr Cavendish saw more and more clearly what a fool\r\nhe would be to marry Barbara, who was evidently so ready to marry him.\r\nThe same thing could not with any confidence be predicated of Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, though, if she were to accept him, and her father were to\r\nconsent, nothing could be better for his interests. All this he felt,\r\nand yet an unconquerable reluctance kept him back. His history was not\r\nquite spotless, and there were chapters in it which he thought it would\r\nkill him to have brought before the public of Carlingford; but still he\r\nwas far from being a bad fellow in his way. And down at the bottom of\r\nhis heart, out of everybody\'s sight, and unacknowledged even by himself,\r\nthere was one little private nook full of gratitude to Lucilla. Though\r\nhe scarcely knew what was passing at the moment, he knew, when he came\r\nto think of it, that she had saved him from the effects of his first\r\npanic at the unexpected appearance of Mr Beverley. Perhaps it was partly\r\nthis consciousness that made him so embarrassed in her presence; and he\r\ncould not find it in his heart, with this sense of gratitude, to deceive\r\nher, and say he loved her, and ask her to marry him. To be sure, if Mr\r\nCavendish had been a very acute observer, he might have felt that\r\nLucilla was quite able to take care of herself in such an emergency, and\r\nwas at the least a match for him, however seductive he might appear to\r\nothers; but then, few people are acute observers in a matter so entirely\r\npersonal to themselves.\r\n\r\nHe felt furious with himself as he went home, and thought how foolish he\r\nhad been ever to go near Barbara Lake in the present position of\r\naffairs; and yet he could not help feeling that it was more delightful\r\nto him to see the colour blaze into her cheeks, and the song rise like a\r\nbird from her full crimson lips, and that flush of excitement and\r\ntriumph come from her eyes, than it could have been in any case to have\r\nbeen admitted to the same degree of intimacy with Lucilla, who was not\r\nin the least intoxicated by his presence. Thus the unfortunate man was\r\ntorn asunder, not so much by love and duty, as by inclination and\r\ninterest, though the inclination was not strong enough to have allowed\r\nof any great sacrifice, nor the interest sufficiently certain to have\r\nrepaid the exertion. This only made it the more difficult to decide; and\r\nin his circumstances, and with the panic that pursued him, he did not\r\nfeel it possible to adopt the only wise policy that remained to him, and\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Cavendish was thus making his way home, horribly vexed and annoyed\r\nwith himself, and avoiding Grange Lane as if the plague was in it, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks sat in her drawing-room alone, and thought the matter over.\r\nCertainly she had not expected him that evening, but still, when she\r\nheard ten o\'clock strike, and felt that his coming now absolutely\r\nimpossible, she was a little--not exactly disappointed, but annoyed at\r\nherself for having felt a sort of expectation. Lucilla was not a person\r\nto hide her sentiments, or even to conceal a fact which was disagreeable\r\nto her _amour propre_. She had too thorough and well-founded a\r\nconfidence in the natural interest of the world in all belonging to her\r\nto do that; so when ten o\'clock had done striking, she opened her\r\nblotting-book and took one of her pretty sheets of paper, with\r\nLucilla on it in delicate rose-tinted letters, the L very large, and\r\nthe concluding letters very small, and dashed off her note to Mrs\r\nChiley. The Miss Blounts\' at Mount Pleasant had been one of the very\r\nfirst establishments to forsake the handwriting which was all corners,\r\nin favour of the bold running hand of the present female generation; and\r\nit was accordingly in a very free and strongly-characterised manuscript,\r\nblack with much ink, that Miss Marjoribanks wrote:\r\n\r\n     "DEAREST MRS CHILEY,--I never expected him to come, and he has not.\r\n     I dare say he never meant it. I am so glad. It was Providence that\r\n     sent you at that particular moment to-day.--Always in haste, with\r\n     fond love, your most truly affectionate\r\n\r\n     "LUCILLA."\r\n\r\nAnd when she had sent Thomas with this note, Miss Marjoribanks felt her\r\nmind relieved. Not that it had been much distressed before, but when she\r\nhad put it in black and white, and concluded upon it, her satisfaction\r\nwas more complete; and no such troublous thoughts as those which\r\ndisturbed the hero of this day\'s transactions--no such wild tears as\r\npoured from the eyes of Barbara Lake--interfered with the maidenly\r\ncomposure of Lucilla\'s meditations. Notwithstanding all that people say\r\nto the contrary, there is a power in virtue which makes itself felt in\r\nsuch an emergency. Miss Marjoribanks could turn from Mr Cavendish, who\r\nhad thus failed to fulfil the demands of his position, to the serene\r\nidea of the Archdeacon, with that delightful consciousness of having\r\nnothing to reproach herself with, which is balm to a well-regulated\r\nmind. She had done her duty, whatever happened. She had not\r\ninjudiciously discouraged nor encouraged the possible Member for\r\nCarlingford; and at the same time she was perfectly free to turn her\r\nattention to the possible Bishop; and neither in one case nor the other\r\ncould anybody say that she had gone a step too far, or committed herself\r\nin any way whatsoever. While these consoling reflections were passing\r\nthrough Lucilla\'s mind, Dr Marjoribanks came upstairs, as had grown to\r\nbe his custom lately. Sometimes he took a cup of tea, though it was\r\nagainst his principles, and sometimes he only sat by while his daughter\r\nhad hers, and amused himself with her chat before he went to bed. He was\r\nlater than usual to-night, and naturally the tea-tray had disappeared\r\nsome time before. As for Lucilla, she did not for a moment permit her\r\nown preoccupation to interfere with the discharge of her immediate duty,\r\nwhich was unquestionably to be amusing and agreeable, and a comfort to\r\nher dear papa.\r\n\r\n"So you had Cavendish here to-day?" said the Doctor. "What brought him\r\nhere? What has he been doing? Since you and he are on such good terms, I\r\nhope he gave you an account of where he has been."\r\n\r\n"He has been nursing a sick friend on--the Continent," said Lucilla,\r\nwith that largeness of geographical expression which is natural to the\r\ninsular mind. "Who are Mr Cavendish\'s friends, papa?" added Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, with confiding simplicity; and it was beautiful to see how\r\nthe daughter looked up into her father\'s face, with that angelic\r\nconfidence in his knowledge on all subjects which is so rarely to be met\r\nwith in the present generation. But it was not a question to which the\r\nDoctor found it easy to respond.\r\n\r\n"Who are his friends?" said Dr Marjoribanks. "He\'s one of the\r\nCavendishes, they say. We have all heard that. I never knew he had any\r\nfriends; which is, after all, next best to having very good ones," said\r\nthe philosophical old Scotchman; and there, as it appeared, he was quite\r\ncontent to let the matter drop.\r\n\r\n"I like to know who people belong to, for my part," said Lucilla. "The\r\nArchdeacon, for example, one knows all about his friends. It\'s a great\r\ndeal nicer, you know, papa. Not that it matters in the least about the\r\nCavendishes----"\r\n\r\n"Well, I should have thought not, after the way you made an end of him,"\r\nsaid the Doctor. "I hope he doesn\'t mean to begin that nonsense over\r\nagain, Lucilla. He is a good fellow enough, and I don\'t mind asking him\r\nto my house; but it is quite a different thing to give him my daughter.\r\nHe spends too much money, and I can\'t see what real bottom he has. It\r\nmay all flare up and come to nothing any day. Nobody can have any\r\ncertainty with an expensive fellow like that," said Dr Marjoribanks.\r\n"There is no telling where he draws his income from; it isn\'t from the\r\nland, and it isn\'t from business; and if it\'s money in the Funds----"\r\n\r\n"Dear papa," said Lucilla, "if he had the Bank of England, it would not\r\nmake any difference to me. I am not going to swindle you, after you have\r\nhad the drawing-room done up, and everything. I said ten years, and I\r\nmean to keep to it,--if nothing very particular happens," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks added prudently. "Most likely I shall begin to go off a\r\nlittle in ten years. And all I think of just now is to do my duty, and\r\nbe a little comfort to you."\r\n\r\nDr Marjoribanks indulged in a faint "humph!" under his breath, as he\r\nlighted his candle; for, as has been already said, he was not a man to\r\nfeel so keenly as some men might have felt the enthusiasm of filial\r\ndevotion which beautified Lucilla\'s life. But at the same time he had\r\nthat respect for his daughter\'s genius, which only experience could have\r\nimpressed upon him; and he did not venture, or rather he did not think\r\nit necessary, to enter into any further explanations. Dr Marjoribanks\r\ndid not in the least degree share the nervousness of Mr Cavendish, who\r\nwas afraid of deceiving Lucilla. As for her father, he felt a consoling\r\nconviction that she was quite able to conduct her own affairs, and would\r\ndo him no discredit in any engagements she might form. And at the same\r\ntime he was amused by the idea that he might be swindled in respect to\r\nthe drawing-room, if she married at this early moment. He took it for\r\nwit, when it was the most solid and sensible reality; but then,\r\nfortunately, the points in which he misapprehended her redounded as much\r\nto Lucilla\'s credit, as those in which he seized her meaning clearest,\r\nso that on every side there was something to be gained.\r\n\r\nAnd when Miss Marjoribanks too retired to her maidenly chamber, a\r\nsentiment of general content and satisfaction filled her mind. It is\r\ntrue that for the moment she had experienced a natural womanly vexation\r\nto see a proposal nipped in the bud. It annoyed her not so much on\r\npersonal as on general principles; for Lucilla was aware that nothing\r\ncould be more pernicious to a man than when thus brought to the very\r\npoint to be thrown back again, and never permitted to produce that\r\ndelicate bloom of his affections. It was like preventing a rose from\r\nputting forth its flowers, a cruelty equally prejudicial to the plant\r\nand to the world. But when this pang of wounded philanthropy was over,\r\nMiss Marjoribanks felt in her heart that it was Providence that had sent\r\nMrs Chiley at that special moment. There was no telling what\r\nembarrassments, what complications she might not have got into, had Mr\r\nCavendish succeeded in unbosoming himself. No doubt Lucilla had a\r\nconfidence that, whatever difficulties there might have been, she would\r\nhave extricated herself from them with satisfaction and even _\xe9clat_,\r\nbut still it was better to avoid the necessity. Thus it was with a\r\nserene conviction that "whatever is, is best," that Miss Marjoribanks\r\nbetook herself to her peaceful slumbers. There are so many people in\r\nthe world who hold, or are tempted to hold, an entirely different\r\nopinion, that it is pleasant to linger over the spectacle of a mind so\r\nperfectly well regulated. Very different were the sentiments of Mr\r\nCavendish, who could not sleep for the ghosts that kept tugging at him\r\non every side; and those of Barbara Lake, who felt that for her too the\r\nflower of her hero\'s love had been nipped in the bud. But, to be sure,\r\nit is only natural that goodness and self-control should have the best\r\nof it sometimes even in this uncertain world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXII_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Archdeacon returned to Carlingford before Thursday, as he had\r\nanticipated; but in the interval Mr Cavendish had not recovered his\r\ncourage so far as to renew his visit to Miss Marjoribanks, or to face\r\nthe man who had alarmed him so much. Everybody in Grange Lane remarked\r\nat the time how worried poor Mrs Woodburn looked. Her eyes lost their\r\nbrightness, which some people thought was the only beauty she had, and\r\nher nerves and her temper both failed her, no one could tell why. The\r\npersonal sketches she made at this moment were truculent and bitter to\r\nan unheard-of degree. She took off Mr Beverley with a savage force which\r\nelectrified her audience, and put words into his mouth which everybody\r\nadmitted were exactly like him, if he could ever be imagined to have\r\nfallen into the extraordinary circumstances in which the mimic placed\r\nhim. In short, Mrs Woodburn made a little drama out of the Archdeacon.\r\nMr Beverley, of course, knew nothing about this, and showed some\r\nsurprise now and then at the restrained laughter which he heard in the\r\ncorners; but when anybody spoke of Mrs Woodburn, he showed an\r\ninstinctive want of confidence. "I have not studied her sufficiently to\r\ngive an opinion of her," he said, which was certainly the very reverse\r\nof her deliverance upon him. To tell the truth, she had rather studied\r\nhim too much, and gave too keen an edge to his characteristic qualities,\r\nas is natural to all literary portraiture, and even went so far that,\r\nin the end, people began to ask whether she had any personal spite\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n"She don\'t know him," Mr Woodburn said, when he heard some faint echo of\r\nthis suggestion. "She\'s clever, and it carries her away, you know. She\r\nenters into it so, she don\'t know how far she is going; but I can answer\r\nfor it she never saw the Archdeacon before; and Hal isn\'t here to give\r\nher the key-note, as she says. _He_ has met everybody, I believe, one\r\nplace or another," the simple man said, with a little natural pride; for\r\nin his heart he was vain of his fashionable brother-in-law. As for Mr\r\nCavendish himself, it began to be understood that he was with a friend\r\nwho was sick, on the Continent; and soon--for news had a wonderful\r\ntendency to increase and grow bigger as it spread in Grange Lane--that\r\nhis friend was dying, and that a probable large increase of fortune to\r\nthe popular favourite would be the result, which was an idea that did\r\ncredit to the imagination of Carlingford. He had disappeared completely\r\nonce more after the eventful day which we have described, carrying out\r\nin the fullest way Lucilla\'s prediction, but striking Barbara Lake with\r\nbitter disappointment. Miss Marjoribanks had a great many things to\r\noccupy her, but Barbara had nothing except the humble duty of looking\r\nafter her little brothers and sisters, and attending to her father\'s\r\ncomfort, which had never been occupations particularly to her mind. And\r\nthen Barbara was aware that, if she neglected her duties, Rose, on her\r\nreturn from the School of Design, would do them, though with a fierce\r\nlittle outbreak of indignation, which the elder sister felt she could\r\nbear; and accordingly, she did little else but brood over his sudden\r\ndisappearance, and spend her time at the window looking for his return.\r\n\r\nLucilla conducted herself, as might have been expected, in a much more\r\nrational and dignified manner. She made herself very agreeable to the\r\nArchdeacon, who unbended very much, and grew very nice, as Mrs Chiley\r\nherself allowed. "But, my dear, I am uneasy about his opinions," the old\r\nlady said. He certainly had a very free way of talking, and was ready to\r\ndiscuss _anything_, and was not approved of by Mr Bury. But still he had\r\nvery good connections and a nice position, and had always a chance of\r\nbeing Bishop of Carlingford; and in marriage it is well known that one\r\nnever can have everything one wants. So that, on the whole, even Mrs\r\nChiley did not see what difference his opinions made, so far as Lucilla\r\nwas concerned. When Miss Marjoribanks went down to Colonel Chiley\'s in\r\nthe evening and made tea for the old people, like a daughter of the\r\nhouse, Mr Beverley was always disposed to go over to the enemy, as the\r\nold Colonel said. No doubt he had enough of Colonel Chiley, who had not\r\nreceived a new idea into his mind since the battle of Waterloo, and did\r\nnot see what people had to do with such nonsense. And then the\r\nArchdeacon would very often walk home with the young visitor. During\r\nthis time, as was natural, Mr Beverley heard Mr Cavendish\'s name a\r\nhundred times, and regretted, like all the world, that so eminent a\r\nmember of the Carlingford commonwealth should be absent during his\r\nvisit; but, at the same time, Lucilla took great care to avoid all\r\npersonalities, and kept a discreet silence even about the gifts and\r\naccomplishments of her almost-lover. Mrs Chiley sighed, poor soul, when\r\nshe saw how her young friend avoided this subject, and thought sometimes\r\nthat he was forgotten, sometimes that the poor dear was breaking her\r\nheart for him; but it is needless to say that neither of these\r\nsuppositions was in the least true.\r\n\r\nAnd then it began to be considered rather odd in Carlingford that the\r\nArchdeacon should pay such a long visit. Mrs Chiley no doubt was very\r\nkind and hospitable, and exceedingly glad to receive such a\r\ndistinguished clergyman; but when a man has been six weeks in any one\'s\r\nhouse, and shows no inclination of going, it is natural that people\r\nshould feel a little surprised. His visitation was over, and he had\r\ndined with everybody, and studied the place and its characteristics, and\r\nentered into everything that was going on. The only thing, indeed, that\r\nhe did not seem to think of, was going away. If it had been Mr\r\nCavendish, the chances are that he would have made himself so much one\r\nof the family, that his departure would have been felt as a domestic\r\ncalamity; but the Archdeacon was very different from Mr Cavendish. So\r\nlong as he was in the house it was impossible to forget either his\r\nposition or his ways of thinking, or the absence of any real connection\r\nbetween himself and his hosts. He did not combat or contradict anybody,\r\nbut he would give a faint smile when the Colonel uttered his\r\nold-fashioned sentiments, which drove the old soldier frantic. "As if I\r\nwas not able to form an opinion, by Jove!" Colonel Chiley said; while,\r\non the other hand, the Archdeacon was quite ready to enter into the\r\nyoung people\'s absurd theories, and discuss the very Bible itself, as if\r\nthat were a book to be discussed. As for the Rector, he turned his head\r\naway when he passed Colonel Chiley\'s door, and Miss Bury made visits of\r\ncondolence and sympathy. "You must feel it a great responsibility having\r\nMr Beverley with you," the Rector\'s sister would say, though naturally\r\nwithout any distinct explanation of her meaning; and then she would look\r\nat Mrs Chiley and sigh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am sure it is a great pleasure," Mrs Chiley answered, not willing\r\nto let down the prestige of her guest. "He is very nice, and takes a\r\ngreat deal of interest in everything; and then, you know, he is a\r\nconnection of ours. The Colonel\'s niece, Mary Chiley----"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," said Miss Bury. "Poor thing! she looked suffering the\r\nlast time I saw her. I hope she has found the true consolation to\r\nsupport her, now she has entered into the troubles of life."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, I hope so," said Mrs Chiley, a little doubtfully; "but you\r\nknow one does not feel the troubles of life very severely at her age;\r\nand I don\'t think I should have called a baby a trouble when I was like\r\nher. I never had any, you know, and I used to fret over it a great deal;\r\nbut the Colonel never liked the noise of children, and I suppose it is\r\nall for the best."\r\n\r\n"One may always be sure of that," said Miss Bury, in her instructive\r\nway. "I suppose the Archdeacon is going soon," she added; "he has been\r\nhere a long time now. I almost wonder he likes to be so long absent from\r\nhis parish. Two months, is it not?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no--not quite six weeks," said Mrs Chiley briskly. "I hope he may\r\nbe persuaded to stay some time longer. I look upon it as quite a\r\ncompliment to Carlingford; for, to be sure, he would not stay if he had\r\nnot some attraction," said the imprudent old woman. And this was\r\nprecisely what Miss Bury wanted, as any one of acute perceptions might\r\nhave seen from the first.\r\n\r\n"It must be a great responsibility for you," said the Rector\'s sister,\r\nwith a sigh, pressing Mrs Chiley\'s hand. "If it should turn out badly,\r\nyou know----Of course, my brother and I don\'t agree with Mr Beverley on\r\nall points--though I am sure I hope he is quite conscientious; but I do\r\nfeel for you with such a responsibility," said Miss Bury, with a look\r\nthat made the old lady nervous in spite of herself. Thus,\r\nnotwithstanding all her sense of the duties of hospitality, and her\r\nanxiety about Lucilla\'s interests, she could not but feel that it would\r\nbe rather a relief to get so formidable a guest fairly out of the house.\r\nIt is uncomfortable, it must be allowed, to entertain in your house\r\nanybody, particularly a clergyman of whom your Rector does not approve;\r\nand there could be no doubt that the Archdeacon was not like the\r\nclergymen that Mrs Chiley had been accustomed to. "And he could come\r\nback another time," she said to herself, by way of conciliating her own\r\nweariness with her visitor\'s advantage and the interests of Lucilla. But\r\nnotwithstanding these reflections on Mrs Chiley\'s part and\r\nnotwithstanding the Colonel\'s less amiable growl, uttered every\r\nmorning--"Does that parson of yours never mean to go away?"--the\r\nArchdeacon showed no intention of budging. It was poor Mrs Chiley who\r\nhad all the brunt to bear, to exhaust herself in civilities and to be\r\nupbraided with "that parson of yours"--whereas he was not in the least\r\nher parson, nor even the kind of man she approved of as a clergyman. All\r\nthis, however, the brave old woman bore with fortitude for Lucilla\'s\r\nsake: certainly it must be Lucilla who kept him in Carlingford--if it\r\nwere not something else.\r\n\r\nThings were in this condition, Mr Cavendish having again disappeared\r\ninto utter darkness, and Carlingford beginning to enter warmly into the\r\nquestion whether or not Mr Beverley was paying attention to Lucilla,\r\nwhen it happened to Miss Marjoribanks one morning to meet the Archdeacon\r\nin a little lane running between Grove Street and Grange Lane. Opening\r\nfrom this lane was a little door in the wall, which admitted to a little\r\ngarden very bright with flowers of the simplest old-fashioned kinds,\r\nwith a little house planted at its extremity, which had pretensions to\r\nbe an old-fashioned and quasi-rural cottage, on the score of being very\r\nrickety, uncomfortable, and badly arranged. But it must be a very\r\nimpracticable erection indeed which does not look tolerable under the\r\nbright sunshine on a summer noon, at the end of a pretty garden where\r\nchildren are playing and birds singing, and a woman or two about.\r\nLucilla was standing at the door of this little closed-up hermitage,\r\nalmost filling up the opening with her crisp summer draperies, and\r\naffording only a very partial and tempting glimpse of its flowers and\r\nshrubs and whitewashed walls inside; and when Mr Beverley came up to\r\nMiss Marjoribanks he felt his curiosity excited. "Is it Armida\'s\r\ngarden, or the Elysian fields--" said the Archdeacon; and he made a dead\r\nstop before the door, not knowing any more than any other blind mortal\r\nwhat he was going to find inside.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about Armida," said Miss Marjoribanks;\r\n"unfortunately they were all Cambridge in their ways of thinking at\r\nMount Pleasant, and our classics got dreadfully neglected. But you may\r\ncome in if you like--at least I think you may come in, if you will\r\npromise not to frighten the children. I am sure they never saw an\r\nArchdeacon in their lives."\r\n\r\n"Are there children?" said Mr Beverley, with a doubtful air; for, to\r\ntell the truth, he had come to the age at which men think it best to\r\navoid children, unless, indeed, they happen to have a personal interest\r\nin them; and he stretched his neck a little to see in over Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s head.\r\n\r\n"There are a whole lot of children, and a pretty governess," said\r\nLucilla. "It is a school, and I am so much interested in it. I may call\r\nit my school, for that matter. I came to know her in the funniest way;\r\nbut I will tell you that another time. And it was just my luck, as\r\nusual. She is so nice, and quite a lady. If you will not say you are an\r\nArchdeacon, to frighten the children, I will let you come in."\r\n\r\n"You shall call me whatever you like," said Mr Beverley; "when I am with\r\nthe lady-patroness, what does it matter what I call myself? Let me see\r\nhow you manage your educational department. I have already bowed before\r\nyour genius in the other branches of government; but this ought to be\r\nmore in my own way."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you care for visiting schools," said Lucilla. "I know you\r\nthink it is a bore; but she is so nice, and so nice-looking; I am sure\r\nyou will be pleased with her. I am quite sure she is a lady, and has\r\nseen better days."\r\n\r\n"Oh, those dreadful women that have seen better days!" said the\r\nArchdeacon; "I think Mrs Chiley has a regiment of them. It is hard to\r\nknow how to get one\'s self into sympathy with those faded existences.\r\nThey fill me with an infinite pity; but then what can one do? If one\r\ntries to recall them to the past, it sounds like mockery--and if one\r\nspeaks of the present, it wounds their feelings. It is a great social\r\ndifficulty," said Mr Beverley; and he fixed his eyes on the ground and\r\nentered meditatively, without looking where he was going, in his\r\nBroad-Church way.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley is so kind," said Lucilla, who was a little puzzled for\r\nthe moment, and did not know what to say.\r\n\r\n"Mrs Chiley is a good, pure, gentle woman," said the Archdeacon. He\r\nspoke in a tone which settled the question, and from which there was no\r\nappeal; and no doubt what he said was perfectly true, though it was not\r\na very distinct characterisation. Thus they went in together into the\r\nbright little garden, thinking of nothing in particular, and loitering\r\nas people do who do not know what is coming. There was something that\r\nmorning in Mr Beverley\'s tone and manner which struck Lucilla as\r\nsomething more than usual. She was not a young woman to attach undue\r\nimportance to looks and tones; but the Archdeacon\'s manner was so\r\nsoftened and mellowed, and his eyes had so much expression in them, and\r\nhe looked at Lucilla with such marked regard, that it was impossible for\r\nher not to recognise that a crisis might be approaching. To be sure, it\r\nwas not by any means so near as that crisis _manqu\xe9_ which had so lately\r\npassed over her head in respect to Mr Cavendish. But still Miss\r\nMarjoribanks could not but remark the signs of a slowly approaching and\r\nmost likely more important climax; and as she remarked it, Lucilla\r\nnaturally by anticipation prepared herself for the coming event that\r\nthus threw a shadow upon her. She did not make up her mind to accept Mr\r\nBeverley any more than she had made up her mind to accept Mr Cavendish;\r\nbut she thought it only her duty to him and to herself, and to society\r\nin general, to take his claims into full consideration. And no doubt, if\r\nthese claims had seemed to her sufficiently strong to merit such a\r\nreward, Miss Marjoribanks had it in her to marry the Archdeacon, and\r\nmake him an admirable wife, though she was not at the present moment, so\r\nfar as she was aware, absolutely what foolish people call in love with\r\nhim. At the same time, she made herself all the more agreeable to Mr\r\nBeverley from her sense of the dawn of tenderness with which he regarded\r\nher. And in this way they went up the broad central path which traversed\r\nthe little garden, neither looking to the left nor the right, but\r\npresenting all that appearance of being occupied with each other, which,\r\nespecially to a female observer, is so easy of interpretation. For, to\r\nbe sure, the Archdeacon had not the remotest idea into whose house he\r\nwas going, nor who it was whom he was about to see.\r\n\r\nBut as it happened, Lucilla\'s prot\xe9g\xe9e, who had seen better days, had\r\njust finished one of her lessons, and sent her little pupils out into\r\nthe garden. She was preparing for the next little class, when, raising\r\nher eyes accidentally, she saw Miss Marjoribanks coming through the\r\ngarden with the Archdeacon by her side. She was the same person whom Mr\r\nBury had brought to Lucilla with the idea of recommending her to Dr\r\nMarjoribanks as a companion and chaperone for his daughter; but since\r\nthen Mrs Mortimer\'s appearance had considerably changed. She had grown\r\nyounger by ten years during the period of comparative comfort and\r\ntranquillity which Lucilla\'s active help and championship had procured\r\nfor her. Her house, and her garden, and her little scholars, and the\r\nbloom on her cheeks, and the filling-up of her worn frame, were all Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s doing. In the intervals of her legislative cares Lucilla\r\nhad run about all over Carlingford searching for pupils, and at the same\r\nmoment had cut and stitched and arranged, and papered walls, and planted\r\nflower-beds, for the feeble creature thus thrown upon her. This was a\r\nside of Lucilla\'s character which certainly she did nothing to hide from\r\nthe public, but which, at the same time, she never made any fuss about;\r\nand it was an endless pleasure to her to find a prot\xe9g\xe9e so perfectly\r\ncontent to be "done for," and do as she was told to do. It was thus that\r\nthe poor faded widow, who was sensitive and had feelings, and forgot\r\nherself so far as to faint, or nearly to faint, just at the most unlucky\r\nmoment possible, when the Rector\'s character and dignity demanded\r\nsuperior self-control on her part, had found her youth again and her\r\ngood looks under Lucilla\'s shadow. When she looked up and saw the two\r\napproaching, Mrs Mortimer\'s first impulse was to smile at the\r\nconjunction; but the next moment she had dropped the books out of her\r\nhands, and was standing gazing out like a woman in a dream, with the\r\ncolour all gone out of her cheeks, and even out of her lips, in the\r\nsurprise of the moment. It was only surprise and a kind of dismay; it\r\nwas not terror, like that which Mr Cavendish had exhibited at the same\r\napparition. She dropped into her chair without knowing it, and probably\r\nwould have fainted this time also, if something more urgent than mere\r\n"feelings" had not roused her up. As it was, it happened very happily\r\nfor her that she had thus a little preparation. When she saw that her\r\npatroness was leading Mr Beverley up to the door, and that in a minute\r\nmore he would inevitably be brought to her very side, Mrs Mortimer\r\nroused up all her strength. She gathered up her books in her hand\r\nwithout knowing very well what she was doing, and, taking virtue from\r\nnecessity, went desperately out to meet them. It was Miss Marjoribanks\r\nwho first saw her, white and tottering, leaning against the trellis of\r\nthe little porch, and Lucilla could not but give a little cry of alarm\r\nand wonder. What kind of man could this be, who thus struck down another\r\nvictim without even so much as a glance? It was just then that the\r\nArchdeacon raised his eyes, and saw standing before him, among the faded\r\nroses, the woman whom he had been approaching so indifferently--the\r\nfaded existence that had seen better days. He saw her, and he stood\r\nstock-still, as if it was she who was the basilisk, and the look of\r\npleased interest went out of his face in a moment. In that moment he had\r\nbecome as unconscious of the presence of Lucilla as if he had never in\r\nhis life softened his voice to her ear, or talked nonsense to please\r\nher. His eyes did not seem big enough to take in the figure which stood\r\nshrinking and looking at him in the porch. Then he made one long step\r\nforward, and took hold of her sleeve--not her hand--as if to convince\r\nhimself that it was something real he saw. He showed no joy, nor\r\nsatisfaction, nor anything but sheer amaze and wonder, at this\r\nunexpected appearance, for he had not had time to prepare himself as she\r\nhad. "Am I dreaming, or is it you?" he said, in a voice that sounded as\r\ndifferent from the voice with which he had been speaking to Lucilla, as\r\nif years had elapsed between the two. And it would be vain to describe\r\nthe amazement and singular sense that the earth had suddenly given way\r\nunder her feet, with which Miss Marjoribanks stood by and looked on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXIII_\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks was naturally the first to recover her senses in this\r\nemergency. Even she, self-possessed as she was, felt the natural\r\ngiddiness inseparable from such a strange reversal of the position. But\r\nshe did not lose her head like the others. She looked at the widow\r\nstanding white and tremulous in the shadow of the little porch, and on\r\nthe Archdeacon, whose manly countenance had paled to a corresponding\r\ncolour. A man does not seize a woman by the sleeve and ask, "Is it\r\n_you_?" without some reason for an address so destitute of ordinary\r\ncourtesy; and Lucilla was sufficiently versed in such matters to know\r\nthat so rude and startling an accost could be only addressed to some one\r\nwhose presence set the speaker\'s heart beating, and quickened the blood\r\nin his veins. It was odd, to say the least, after the way in which he\r\nhad just been speaking to herself; but Miss Marjoribanks, as has been\r\nalready said, was not the woman to lose her head. She recovered herself\r\nwith the second breath she drew, and took her natural place. "I can see\r\nthat you have something to say to each other," said Lucilla. "Mrs\r\nMortimer, ask Mr Beverley to walk in. Never mind me. I want to speak to\r\nthe little Lakes. I shall come back presently," Miss Marjoribanks added,\r\nnodding pleasantly to the Archdeacon--and she went away to the other end\r\nof the garden, calling to the children with that self-possession which\r\nis the gift only of great minds. But when Lucilla found herself at a\r\nsafe distance, and saw the Archdeacon stoop to go in under the porch, it\r\ncannot be denied that her mind was moved by the sight. It was she who\r\nhad seen after the putting-up of that trellis round that porch, and the\r\narrangement of the wistaria, which had been sprawling all over the front\r\nof the house uncared for. If there was any place in the world where she\r\nshould have been free from such a shock, it certainly should have been\r\nhere, in this spot, which she had, so to speak, created. Naturally the\r\nunfitness of these surroundings to witness a revolution so unlooked-for\r\nand disagreeable struck Lucilla. If she had to be again humiliated, and\r\nto submit once more to see another preferred to herself, it certainly\r\nshould have been under other circumstances. When we admit that such a\r\nthought did pass through the mind of Miss Marjoribanks, it will prove to\r\nall who know her that Lucilla found her position sufficiently\r\naggravating. She had exerted herself for Mrs Mortimer as nobody else in\r\nCarlingford would have exerted themselves. She had not only found pupils\r\nand a means of living for the widow, which, perhaps, a committee of\r\nladies might have done at the end of a year, had it been put into their\r\nhands; but Miss Marjoribanks had done it at once, and had taken charge\r\nof that timid and maladroit individual herself, and set her up, and done\r\neverything for her. It was Dr Marjoribanks\'s gardener, under Lucilla\'s\r\norders, who had arranged and planted the garden, and trained the\r\nembowering foliage which had just brushed the Archdeacon\'s clerical hat\r\nas he went in; and in the act of refurnishing her drawing-room, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks had managed to procure, without costing anybody anything\r\nexcept a little trouble, as she herself said, many accessories, which\r\ngave an air of comfort to the little parlour, in which, no doubt, at\r\nthat moment, Mr Beverley and Mrs Mortimer were explaining themselves.\r\nLucilla had a great deal too much good sense to upbraid anybody with\r\ningratitude, or even to make any claim upon that slippery quality; but\r\nshe knew at the same time that the widow was the very last person from\r\nwhom a new discomfiture should come, and that to enter in under that\r\ntrellis when he left her was, on the Archdeacon\'s part, an aggravation\r\nof the change in his sentiments which it was difficult to bear.\r\n\r\nShe walked along the garden path very briskly under the influence of\r\nthese thoughts, and it was not in nature to do otherwise than snub the\r\nchildren when she joined them. Lucilla was a woman of genius, but she\r\nwas not faultless; and when she found Ethelinda and Ethelfreda Lake, the\r\ntwo twins, the one with her clean frock all muddy and stained, the other\r\nwith the front breadth torn right up the middle, it is scarcely to be\r\nwondered at if she lost her patience. "You little nasty untidy things!"\r\nshe said, "I should like to know who you expect is to go mending up and\r\nwashing every day for you? It will not be Barbara, I am sure," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks added, with a fine intonation of scorn, of which the\r\nculprits were insensible; and she gave Ethelinda a shake, who was\r\nsitting on the wet ground, all muddy with recent watering, and who,\r\nbesides, was the one who most resembled Barbara. When this temporary\r\nebullition had taken place, Lucilla began gradually to right herself.\r\nIt was a grand sight, if anybody had been there to witness it, or if\r\nanybody could have seen into Miss Marjoribanks\'s maiden bosom; but the\r\nspectacle of a great mind thus recovering its balance is one which can\r\nrarely be visible except in its results. While she set the children to\r\nrights, and represented to Mrs Mortimer\'s little servant, who was in the\r\ngarden furtively on a pretence of cabbages, the extreme folly, and\r\nindeed idiocy, of letting them get to the water and make a mess of\r\nthemselves, Lucilla was in reality coming to herself. Perhaps she spoke\r\nwith a little more energy than usual; but the offenders were so well\r\naware of their guilt, and so thoroughly satisfied of the justice of the\r\nreproof addressed to them, that no other explanation was necessary; and,\r\nlittle by little, Miss Marjoribanks felt herself restored to her natural\r\ncalm.\r\n\r\n"You know I don\'t like to scold you," she said; "but what would anybody\r\nsay?--nice clean frocks, that I am sure were put on fresh this\r\nmorning--and you, Mary Jane----"\r\n\r\n"Please, Miss, it was only for a young cabbage. Missis is fond of a bit\r\nof vegetable," said the little maid. "I knew _she\'d_ not say\r\nnothing;--and just as I had told \'em all to have done and be good--and\r\nnobody knew as _you_ was here," said Mary Jane. There was something even\r\nin that small and humble testimony to Lucilla\'s sovereignty which helped\r\non the process which was operating in her mind. She regained bit by bit\r\nthat serene self-consciousness which places the spirit above the passing\r\nvexations of the world. What did it matter what other people might be\r\ndoing or saying? Was not she still Lucilla Marjoribanks? and when one\r\nhad said that, one had said all.\r\n\r\n"It is time you were all going home to your dinners," said Lucilla; "and\r\nI have asked Mrs Mortimer to give you a half-holiday. As for you, you\r\nlittle Linda, you are not fit to be seen; and I am sure if I were your\r\nsister I should send you off to bed. Now get all your hats and things\r\nand run away; and if you are not awfully good to-morrow, I shall never\r\nask for another half-holiday again."\r\n\r\nSaying which, Miss Marjoribanks herself saw the hats brought out, and\r\nthe little scholars sent away. She took matters into her own hand with\r\nthe confidence of a superior nature. "After all the long talk they are\r\nhaving she will not be able for her scholars to-day," Lucilla said\r\nmagnanimously to herself; and she again made the tour of the garden,\r\ninspecting everything, to see that all was in order. With every step\r\nthat she took, Miss Marjoribanks became more and more herself. As we\r\nhave already said, it was a grand and inspiring sight; but then, to be\r\nsure, as in the former case, her affections, fortunately, were not\r\nengaged. She was not in love with the Archdeacon, any more than she had\r\nbeen in love with Mr Cavendish;--though it is true, love is not\r\neverything. And to think how he had been looking and talking not much\r\nmore than half an hour ago, and to reflect that now he had most likely\r\nforgotten her very existence, and was explaining himself, and placing\r\nthat position which would have just suited Lucilla at the feet of the\r\nobject of her bounty, was enough to have driven a young woman of\r\nordinary mind half out of her senses with disgust and indignation. But,\r\nfortunately, Lucilla\'s mind was not an ordinary one; and every step she\r\ntook round the garden restored her more and more entirely to herself.\r\nInstead of conceiving any jealous dislike to Mrs Mortimer, she had\r\nalready, as has been stated, exerted herself with her usual benevolence\r\nto leave the widow free for the rest of the day. "After all, it is not\r\nher fault if she knew him before, or if he was in love with her,"\r\nLucilla said to herself. And when she had arrived at this perfectly true\r\nand profoundly philosophical conclusion, it may be said that the crisis\r\nwas at an end.\r\n\r\nBut then where personal offence and indignation (if the natural shock to\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s feelings could be called by such hard names) ended,\r\nbewilderment and curiosity began. Who could this Archdeacon be who had\r\nfrightened the most popular man in Carlingford out of the place, and\r\nwhose unlooked-for appearance had driven Mrs Mortimer back out of her\r\nrecovered good looks and cheerfulness into pallor and trembling? It is\r\ntrue that Lucilla knew quite well who he was--the second son of Mr\r\nBeverley of Trent Valley, a family as well known as any family in\r\nEngland. Everybody knew all about the Archdeacon: his career from his\r\nyouth up was as clearly traceable as if he had been killed in a railway\r\naccident and had had his memoir published in the _Times_. There was\r\nnothing in the smallest degree secret or mysterious about him; and yet\r\nhow could it come about that the sight of him should frighten Mr\r\nCavendish out of his senses, and make Mrs Mortimer, who was utterly\r\nunconnected with Mr Cavendish, all but faint, as she had done on a\r\nformer occasion? Was it his mission to go about the world driving\r\npeople into fits of terror or agitation? To be sure, he was a\r\nBroad-Churchman, and not the type of clergyman to which Lucilla in her\r\nheart inclined; but still a man may be Broad Church, and speak a little\r\nfreely on religious matters, without being a basilisk. As these thoughts\r\nwent through her mind, Miss Marjoribanks could not help observing that\r\nthe branches of the pear-tree, which was all that the garden contained\r\nin the shape of fruit, had come loose from the wall, and were swaying\r\nabout greatly to the damage of the half-grown pears,--not to say that it\r\ngave a very untidy look to that corner. "I must send Crawford down this\r\nevening to fasten it up," Lucilla said to herself, and then went on with\r\nwhat she was thinking; and she made one or two other remarks of the same\r\ndescription in a parenthesis as she made her tour. After all, it is\r\nastonishing how many little things go wrong when the man or woman with a\r\nhundred eyes is absent for a few days from the helm of affairs. It was\r\nnearly a week since Miss Marjoribanks had been round Mrs Mortimer\'s\r\ngarden, and in that time the espalier had got detached, some of the\r\nverbenas were dead in the borders, and the half of the sticks that\r\npropped up the dahlias had fallen, leaving the plants in miserable\r\nconfusion. Lucilla shook her head over this, as she asked herself what\r\nmysterious influence there could be in the Archdeacon. For her own part,\r\nshe was not in the slightest degree afraid of him, nor could she confess\r\nto having felt agitated even when he walked with her into this fated\r\ngarden; but there could be no doubt of the seriousness of the effect\r\nproduced by his appearance on the two others. "They have broken half of\r\nthe props, the little nuisances," Lucilla said to herself, as she\r\npursued her musings. For her large mind was incapable, now that its\r\nperfect serenity was happily regained, of confining itself, unless with\r\na very good reason, to one sole subject.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished her inspection, and saw that nobody had yet\r\nappeared at the door, Miss Marjoribanks collected the books which the\r\nchildren had left lying in the summer-house, and put them under\r\ncover--for, to tell the truth, it looked a little like rain; and having\r\ndone this, and looked all round her to see if anything else required her\r\nimmediate care, Lucilla carried philosophy to its highest practical\r\npoint by going away, which is, perhaps, a height of good sense which may\r\nbe thought too much for humanity. It was not too much for Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s legislative soul and knowledge of human nature;--and in\r\nthus denying herself she was perfectly aware of her advantages, and of\r\nthe inevitable result. She knew, just as well as if she had already\r\nreceived it, that Mrs Mortimer would write her a little three-cornered\r\nnote, marked _Private_, as soon as the Archdeacon was gone; and she\r\nthought it was highly probable that Mr Beverley himself would come to\r\ngive some explanation. With this tranquil assurance in her mind, Lucilla\r\nturned her face towards Grange Lane. She began to have a kind of\r\nconviction too, since this had happened, either that Carlingford would\r\nnot be raised into a bishopric, or that the Archdeacon at least would\r\nnot be the first bishop. It was difficult to give any ground for the\r\nidea, but it came into her mind with a kind of quiet certainty; and with\r\nthis conviction, in which she recognised that beautiful self-adjusting\r\nbalance of compensations which keeps everything right in the world,\r\nLucilla, quite recovered from her shock, had on the whole a pleasant\r\nwalk home.\r\n\r\nAs for the two who were shut up together in Mrs Mortimer\'s parlour,\r\ntheir state of mind was far from partaking of the virtuous peace and\r\nserenity which filled Miss Marjoribanks\'s bosom. It was more than an\r\nhour before the Archdeacon went away; and when Mrs Mortimer had a little\r\ncollected her faculties, the result arrived which had been foreseen by\r\nLucilla. In the first place, terror seized the widow as to what had\r\nbecome of her pupils, whom all this time she had forgotten, and deep was\r\nher gratitude when she had ascertained that her protecting genius had\r\nsent them away. But with that gratitude came a sudden recollection of\r\nthe manner in which Mr Beverley and Miss Marjoribanks had been coming\r\ntogether up the garden path, before the mistress of the house showed\r\nherself. Mrs Mortimer wrung her hands when she recollected the looks and\r\nattitude of the two, and the rumour which had reached her ears that the\r\nArchdeacon was paying attention to Miss Marjoribanks. What was she to\r\ndo?--was her miserable presence here to dispel perhaps the youthful\r\nhopes of her benefactress, and make a revolution in Lucilla\'s prospects?\r\nThe poor woman felt herself ready to sink into the earth at the thought.\r\nShe went to the window and looked out disconsolately into the rain--for\r\nit had come on to rain, as Lucilla supposed it would--and felt like a\r\ncreature in a cage, helpless, imprisoned, miserable, not knowing what to\r\ndo with herself, and the cause of trouble to her best friends. A little\r\nhouse in a garden may look like a little paradise in the sunshine, and\r\nyet feel like a dungeon when a poor woman all alone looks out across her\r\nflowers in the rain, and sees nothing but the wall that shuts her in,\r\nand thinks to herself that she has no refuge nor escape from it--nobody\r\nto tell her what to do, nothing but her own feeble powers to support\r\nher, and the dreadful idea that she has done harm and can do no good to\r\nher only protector. Any reasonable creature would have said, that to be\r\nthere in her own house, poor enough certainly, but secure, and no longer\r\ndriven lonely and distressed about the world, was a great matter. But\r\nyet, after all, the walls that shut her in, the blast of white,\r\nsweeping, downright rain, which seemed to cut her off from any succour\r\noutside, and the burden of something on her mind which by herself she\r\nwas quite unable to bear, was a hard combination; and wringing one\'s\r\nhands, and feeling one\'s mind ready to give way under a new and\r\nunexpected burden, could not advance matters in the slightest degree.\r\nShe was not strong-minded, as has been already proved; nor, indeed, had\r\nshe the ordinary amount of indifference to other people, or confidence\r\nin herself, which stands in the place of self-control with many people.\r\nAfter she had wrung her hands, and looked out again and again with a\r\nvague instinct of perhaps finding some suggestion of comfort outside,\r\nMrs Mortimer relapsed by necessity into the one idea that had been a\r\nsupport to her for so many months past. All that she could do was to\r\nconsult Lucilla--it might be to wound Lucilla, for anything she could\r\ntell; but when a poor creature is helpless and weak, and has but one\r\nfriend in the world who is strong, what can she do but apply to her\r\nsustainer and guardian? When, after beating about wildly from one point\r\nto another, she arrived ultimately, as might have been predicted, and as\r\nMiss Marjoribanks had expected from the first, at that conclusion, there\r\nremained a further difficulty in respect to the means of communication.\r\nLucilla had settled quite calmly in her own mind that it would be by the\r\nmedium of a three-cornered note, a matter in which there was no\r\ndifficulty whatever, for the widow was sufficiently fluent with her pen;\r\nbut then Lucilla had not thought of Mary Jane, who was the only possible\r\nmessenger. It was to this point now that Mrs Mortimer\'s ideas addressed\r\nthemselves. At that moment the rain poured down fiercer than ever, the\r\nbricks of the uncovered wall grew black with the wet, and the wistaria\r\ncrouched and shivered about the porch as if it wanted to be taken\r\nindoors. And then to get wet, and perhaps catch cold, was a thing Mary\r\nJane conscientiously avoided, like the rest of the world; and it was\r\nwith a sense of alarm even stronger than that excited by the possibility\r\nof injuring Lucilla, that Mrs Mortimer very gently and modestly rang her\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it rains quite so heavily," said the timid\r\nexperimentalist, feeling her heart beat as she made this doubtful\r\nstatement. "Have you a pair of goloshes, Mary Jane?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the little handmaiden, with precaution; "and, please, if it\'s\r\nfor the post, it rains worse nor ever; and I don\'t think as mother would\r\nlike----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is not for the post," said Mrs Mortimer; "it is for Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. You can take mine, and then you will not get your feet\r\nwet. I go out so very little; you may have them--to keep--Mary Jane. And\r\nyou can take the big shawl that hangs in the passage, and an umbrella. I\r\ndon\'t think it is so heavy as it was."\r\n\r\nMary Jane regarded the rain gloomily from the window; but her reluctance\r\nwas at an end from the moment she heard that it was to Miss Marjoribanks\r\nshe was going. To be sure, the distance between the Serenissime Nancy\r\nand Thomas, and the other inmates of the Doctor\'s kitchen, and Mrs\r\nMortimer\'s little handmaiden, was as great as that which exists between\r\nan English Duke and the poorest little cadet of a large family among his\r\nattendant gentry; but, correspondingly, the merest entrance into that\r\nhigher world was as great a privilege for Mary Jane, as the Duke\'s\r\nnotice would be to the Squire\'s youngest son. She kept up a momentary\r\nshow of resistance, but she accepted the goloshes, and even after a\r\nmoment agreed in her mistress\'s trembling assertion about the rain. And\r\nthis was how the three-cornered note got conveyed to its destination in\r\nthe heaviest of the storm, between three and four o\'clock in the\r\nafternoon. Mrs Mortimer still sat at her window, wringing her hands from\r\ntime to time, with her head aching and her heart beating, and a dreadful\r\nquestion in her mind as to what Lucilla would say, or whether perhaps\r\nshe might reject altogether in her natural indignation the appeal made\r\nto her; which was an idea which filled the widow with inexpressible\r\nhorror. While at the same moment Miss Marjoribanks sat looking for that\r\nappeal which she knew was sure to come. The rain had set in by this time\r\nwith an evident intention of lasting, and even from the windows of\r\nLucilla\'s drawing-room the prospect of the garden walls and glistening\r\ntrees was sufficiently doleful. Nobody was likely to call, nothing was\r\ndoing; and Lucilla, who never caught cold, had not the least fear of\r\nwetting her feet. And besides, her curiosity had been rising every\r\nmoment since her return; and the widow\'s pathetic appeal, "Come to me,\r\nmy dearest Lucilla. I have nobody whom I can talk to in the world but\r\nyou!" had its natural effect upon a mind so feeling. Miss Marjoribanks\r\ngot up as soon as she had read the note, and changed her dress, and put\r\non a great waterproof cloak. Instead of thinking it a trouble, she was\r\nrather exhilarated by the necessity. "Be sure you make your mistress a\r\nnice cup of tea as soon as we get there," she said to Mary Jane. "She\r\nmust want it, I am sure, if she has not had any dinner;" for the little\r\nmaid had betrayed the fact that Mrs Mortimer could not eat anything, and\r\nhad sent away her dinner, which was naturally an alarming and wonderful\r\noccurrence to Mary Jane. The widow was still sitting at the window when\r\nLucilla appeared tripping across the wet garden in her waterproof cloak,\r\nif not a ministering angel, at least a substantial prop and support to\r\nthe lonely woman who trusted in her, and yet in the present instance\r\nfeared her. But anything more unlike a disappointed maiden, whose wooer\r\nhad been taken away from her under her very eyes, could not have been\r\nseen. On the contrary, Miss Marjoribanks was radiant, with raindrops\r\nglistening on her hair, and what Mrs Chiley called "a lovely colour." If\r\nthere was one thing in the world more than another which contented\r\nLucilla, it was to be appealed to and called upon for active service. It\r\ndid her heart good to take the management of incapable people, and\r\narrange all their affairs for them, and solve all their difficulties.\r\nSuch an office was more in her way than all the Archdeacons in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n"I saw you knew him the moment I looked at you," said Lucilla. "I have\r\nseen other people look _like that_ when he appeared. Who is he, for\r\ngoodness\' sake? I know quite well, of course, who he is, in the ordinary\r\nway; but do tell me what has he done to make people look like that\r\nwhenever he appears?"\r\n\r\nMrs Mortimer did not directly answer this question--she fixed her mind\r\nupon one part of it, like an unreasonable woman, and repeated "Other\r\npeople?" with a kind of interrogative gasp.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it was only a gentleman," said Lucilla, with rapid intelligence;\r\nand then there was a little pause. "He has been here for six weeks,"\r\nMiss Marjoribanks continued; "you must have heard of him; indeed, you\r\nwould have heard him preach if you had not gone off after these\r\nDissenters. Did you really never know that he was here till to-day?"\r\n\r\n"I did not think of him being Archdeacon--he was only a curate when I\r\nused to know him," said poor Mrs Mortimer, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"Tell me all about it," said Lucilla, with ingenuous sympathy; and she\r\ndrew her chair close to that of her friend, and took her hand in a\r\nprotecting, encouraging way. "You know, whatever you like to say, that\r\nit is quite safe with me."\r\n\r\n"If you are sure you do not mind," said the poor widow. "Oh, yes, I have\r\nheard what people have been saying about him and--and you, Lucilla; and\r\nif I had known, I would have shut myself up--I would have gone away for\r\never and ever--I would----"\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Miss Marjoribanks, with a little severity, "I thought\r\nyou knew me better. If I had been thinking of that sort of thing, I\r\nnever need have come home at all; and when you know how kind papa has\r\nbeen about the drawing-room and everything. Say what you were going to\r\nsay, and never think of me."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Lucilla, I have had my life," said the trembling woman, whose\r\nagitation was coming to a climax--"I have had it, and done with it; and\r\nyou have been so good to me; and if, after all, I was to stand between\r\nyou and--and--and--anybody----" But here Mrs Mortimer broke down, and\r\ncould say no more. To be sure, she did not faint this time any more than\r\nshe did on the first occasion when she made Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\nacquaintance; but Lucilla thought it best, as then, to make her lie down\r\non the sofa, and keep her quite quiet, and hasten Mary Jane with the cup\r\nof tea.\r\n\r\n"You have been agitated, and you have not eaten anything," said Lucilla.\r\n"I am going to stay with you till half-past six, when I must run home\r\nfor dinner, so we have plenty of time; and as for your life, I don\'t\r\nconsider you gone off at all yet, and you are a great deal\r\nyounger-looking than you were six months ago. I am very glad the\r\nArchdeacon did not come until you had got back your looks. It makes such\r\na difference to a man," Miss Marjoribanks added, with that almost\r\nimperceptible tone of contempt which she was sometimes known to use when\r\nspeaking of Their absurd peculiarities. As for Mrs Mortimer, the\r\ninference conveyed by these words brought the colour to her pale\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n"It will never come to that," she said, "no more than it did in old\r\ndays; it never can, Lucilla; and I don\'t know that it is to be wished. I\r\ncouldn\'t help being put out a little when I saw him, you know; but there\r\nis one thing, that he never, never will persuade me," said the widow.\r\nLucilla could not but look on in surprise and even consternation, while\r\nMrs Mortimer thus expressed herself. A warm flush animated the pale and\r\nsomewhat worn face--and a gleam of something that looked absolutely like\r\nresolution shone in the yielding woman\'s mild eyes. Was it possible that\r\neven she had one point upon which she could be firm? Miss Marjoribanks\r\nstood still, petrified, in the very act of pouring out the tea.\r\n\r\n"If it is only one thing, if I were you, I would give in to him," said\r\nLucilla, with a vague sense that this sort of self-assertion must be put\r\na stop to, mingling with her surprise.\r\n\r\n"Never," said Mrs Mortimer again, with a still more distinct gleam of\r\nresolution. "In the first place, I have no right whatever to anything\r\nmore than my uncle gave me. He told me himself I was to have no more;\r\nand _he_ was very, very kind to poor Edward. You don\'t know all the\r\ncircumstances, or you would not say so," she cried, with a sob. As for\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, if it is possible to imagine her clear spirit\r\naltogether lost in bewilderment, it would have been at that moment; but\r\nshe recovered as soon as she had administered her cup of tea.\r\n\r\n"Now tell me all about it," said Lucilla, again sitting down by the\r\nsofa; and this time Mrs Mortimer, to whom her excitement had given a\r\nlittle spur and stimulus, did not waste any more time.\r\n\r\n"He is my cousin," she said; "not my real cousin, but distant; and I\r\nwill not deny that long, long ago--when we were both quite young, you\r\nknow, Lucilla----"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I understand," said Miss Marjoribanks, pressing her hand.\r\n\r\n"He was very nice in those days," said Mrs Mortimer, faltering; "that\r\nis, I don\'t mean to say he was not always nice, you know, but only----I\r\nnever had either father or mother. I was living with my Uncle\r\nGarrett--my uncle on the other side; and he thought he should have made\r\nme his heiress; but instead of that, he left his money, you know, to\r\n_him_; and then he was dreadfully put out, and wanted me to go to law\r\nwith him and change the will; but I never blamed him, for my part,\r\nLucilla--he knows I never blamed him--and nothing he said would make me\r\ngive in to go to the law with him----"\r\n\r\n"Stop a minute," said Lucilla, "I am not quite sure that I understand.\r\nWho was it he wanted you to go to law with? and was it to the Archdeacon\r\nthe money was left?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lucilla," said the widow, with momentary exasperation, "you who are\r\nso quick and pick up everything, to think you should not understand me\r\nwhen I speak of a thing so important! Of course it was not to Charles\r\nBeverley the money was left: if it had been left to him, how could he\r\nhave wanted me to go to law? It has always been the question between\r\nus," said Mrs Mortimer, once more lighting up with exceptional and\r\nunwonted energy. "He said I was to indict him for conspiracy; and I\r\ndeclare to you, Lucilla, that he was not to blame. Uncle Garrett might\r\nbe foolish, but I don\'t say even that he was foolish: he was so good to\r\nhim, like a son; and he had no son of his own, and I was only a girl. He\r\nnever was anything to me," said Mrs Mortimer, wiping her eyes--"never,\r\nwhatever Charles may choose to say; but if ever I was sure of anything\r\nin the world, I am sure that he was not to blame."\r\n\r\nLucilla\'s head began to whirl; but after her first unsuccessful essay,\r\nshe was wise enough not to ask any more direct questions. She made all\r\nthe efforts possible, with ears and eyes intent, to disentangle this web\r\nof pronouns, and failing, waited on in the hope that time and patience\r\nwould throw a little light upon them. "I suppose Mr Beverley thought he\r\nwas to blame?" she said, when the narrator paused to take breath.\r\n\r\n"Is not that what I am saying?" said Mrs Mortimer. "It was through that\r\nit was all broke off. I am sure I don\'t know whether he has regretted it\r\nor not, Lucilla. It is not always very easy to understand a gentleman,\r\nyou know. After I was married to poor Edward, naturally I never had any\r\nmore correspondence with him; and to see him to-day without any warning,\r\nand to find him just as bent as he was upon making me prosecute, and\r\njust as full of bad feeling, and speaking as if there was some reason\r\nmore than truth and justice why I should be so determined. No, Lucilla,"\r\nsaid Mrs Mortimer, raising herself up on the sofa, "it is just the same\r\nthing as ever, and the same obstacle as ever, and it never will come to\r\n_that_."\r\n\r\n"You are agitating yourself," said Miss Marjoribanks; "lie down--there\'s\r\na dear--and keep quite still, and see whether we cannot make anything\r\nbetter of it. Tell me, what would you go to law with him for?" Lucilla\r\ncontinued, with the natural humility of imperfect comprehension. It was\r\nperhaps the first time in her life that such a singular chance had\r\nhappened to Miss Marjoribanks, as to have a matter explained to her, and\r\nyet be unable to understand.\r\n\r\n"He says he could be indicted for conspiracy, or for having too much\r\ninfluence over him, and making him do what he liked. But he was very\r\ngood to him, Lucilla, and to my poor Edward; and when I was married to\r\nhim----"\r\n\r\n"Goodness gracious! were you married to him as well?" cried Lucilla,\r\nfairly losing the thread and her balance in this confusing circle. Mrs\r\nMortimer grew pale, and rose quite up from the sofa, and went with the\r\nair of an insulted woman to seat herself in her usual chair.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you should address me so," she said. "He is nothing to\r\nme, and never was. It is an insult to me to think that I must have a\r\npersonal reason for refusing to do a wicked and unjust thing. I could\r\ngive up anything," said the widow, losing a little of her dignity, and\r\ngrowing again pathetic--"I would give in in a moment if it was any fancy\r\nof mine--you know I would; but I am sure it would be wicked and\r\nunjust----"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I am not the person to bid you do anything unjust or wicked,"\r\nsaid Lucilla, who, in the utter confusion of her faculties, began to\r\nfeel offended in her turn.\r\n\r\n"Then I beg you will never speak to me of it again!" cried Mrs Mortimer.\r\n"How is it possible that either he or you can know the rights of it as I\r\ndo, who was in the house at the time and saw everything? He may say what\r\nhe likes, but I know there was no conspiracy; he was just as much\r\nsurprised as you could be, or Charles, or anybody. Of course it was for\r\nhis advantage--nobody denies that--but you don\'t mean to say that a man\r\nis to reject everything that is for his advantage?" said the widow,\r\nturning eyes of indignant inquiry upon her visitor; and Miss\r\nMarjoribanks for once was so utterly perplexed that she did not know how\r\nto respond.\r\n\r\n"But you said when you were married to him?" said Lucilla, who felt that\r\nthe tables were turned upon her for the moment. "I am sure I beg your\r\npardon for being so stupid; but whom were you married to?" This was said\r\nin the most deprecating tone in the world, but still it irritated Mrs\r\nMortimer, whose mind was all unhinged, and who somehow felt that she\r\nwas not finding in Miss Marjoribanks the help and support to which her\r\nclear and detailed explanation entitled her. Though her head was aching\r\ndreadfully, she sat up more upright than ever in her chair.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you can mean to insult me, Miss Marjoribanks," said the\r\nwidow, "after being so kind. Perhaps I have been trying you too much by\r\nwhat I have said; though I am sure I would have given up everything, and\r\ngone away anywhere, rather than be the cause of anything unpleasant. You\r\nknow that it was my poor dear Edward I was married to; you know I have\r\na--a horror," said Mrs Mortimer, faltering, "in general--of second\r\nmarriages."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Lucilla, "but there are always exceptions, you know; and\r\nwhen people have no children, nor anything--and you that were so young.\r\nI always make exceptions, for my part; and if you could only get over\r\nthis one point," Miss Marjoribanks added, making a dexterous strategical\r\nmovement. But Mrs Mortimer only shook her head.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I am hard to get on with," she said; "but my poor Edward\r\nalways said one must make a stand somewhere. He used to say I was so\r\neasy to be persuaded. He was glad to see I had a point to make a stand\r\non, instead of being disagreeable about it, or thinking he was anything\r\nto me. And oh, Lucilla, he was so kind to him," said the widow, with\r\ntears in her eyes. "We met him quite by chance, and he was so kind. I\r\nwill never forget it, if I should live a hundred years. And why should\r\nCharles be in such a way? He never did him any harm! If any one was\r\ninjured, it was me, and I never felt myself injured--neither did Edward.\r\nOn the contrary, he _always_ did him justice, Lucilla," Mrs Mortimer\r\ncontinued, fixing a pathetic look upon her friend. What could Lucilla\r\ndo? She was burning to take it all in her own hands, and arrange it\r\nsomehow, and unite the two lovers who had been so long separated; but\r\nunless she could understand what the point was on which Mrs Mortimer\r\nmade her stand, what could she do?\r\n\r\n"I never could understand," said the widow, who began to feel her heart\r\nsick with the disappointment of that hope which she had fixed in Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, "why he should take it so much to heart. Poor Edward never\r\nthought of such a thing! and why he should be so set against poor Mr\r\nKavan, and so----Lucilla! oh, tell me, do you see anything? what do you\r\nmean?"\r\n\r\n"I want to know who Mr Kavan is?" said Miss Marjoribanks, much startled.\r\nShe had for the moment forgotten the Archdeacon\'s discovery and her own\r\nsuspicions; and the idea of connecting the man who had (apparently) fled\r\nfrom Mr Beverley\'s presence, with the innocent and helpless woman upon\r\nwhom the appearance of the Broad Churchman had so overwhelming an\r\neffect, had never hitherto entered her imagination. But this name, which\r\nwas not the name of anybody she knew, and yet seemed to bear an odd sort\r\nof rudimentary relationship to another name, struck her like a sudden\r\nblow and brought everything back to her mind. It was a bewildering sort\r\nof explanation, if it was an explanation; but still a confused light\r\nbegan to break upon Lucilla\'s understanding. If this was what it all\r\nmeant then there was the widest opening for charitable exertions, and\r\nmuch to be done which only a mind like Miss Marjoribanks\'s could do.\r\n\r\n"That is not his name now," said Mrs Mortimer, "I don\'t see, if he liked\r\nit, why he should not change his name. I am sure a great many people do;\r\nbut his name was Kavan when he lived with my uncle. I don\'t remember\r\nwhat it was after, for of course he was always Mr Kavan to me; and\r\nCharles Beverley never could bear him. He used to think----But oh,\r\nLucilla, forgive me--oh, forgive me, if it is too much for you!" she\r\nadded, a moment after, as another idea struck her. "It was not with the\r\nidea of--of anything coming of it, you know; it will never come to\r\nthat--not now;--I don\'t know if it is to be wished. I am sure he is\r\nquite free so far as I am concerned. It was not with that idea I asked\r\nfor your advice, Lucilla," said the poor woman, in piteous tones. If\r\nMiss Marjoribanks had pressed her, and insisted upon knowing what _was_\r\nthe idea which had moved her friend to ask her advice, Mrs Mortimer\r\nwould no doubt have found it very hard to reply; but Lucilla had no such\r\ncruel intentions; and the widow, notwithstanding her piteous denial of\r\nany motive, now that her mind was cleared, and she had caught the\r\ncomprehension of her auditor, began to regard her with a certain\r\ninstinct of hope.\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Marjoribanks, this revelation at once troubled and cleared\r\nher mind. If this was the culprit, he _was_ a culprit and yet he was\r\ninnocent; and to heap coals of fire upon his head was in some respects a\r\nChristian duty. Her ideas went forward at a bound to a grand finale of\r\nreconciliation and universal brotherhood. She saw the tools under her\r\nhands, and her very fingers itched to begin. Large and varied as her\r\nexperience was, she had never yet had any piece of social business on so\r\nimportant a scale to manage, and her eyes sparkled and her heart beat at\r\nthe idea. Instead of shrinking from interference, her spirits rose at\r\nthe thought. To vanquish the Archdeacon, to pluck out from the darkness,\r\nand rehabilitate and set at his ease the mysterious adventurer, whom, to\r\nbe sure, _she could not say she knew_--for Lucilla was very careful,\r\neven in her own thoughts, not to commit herself on this subject--and to\r\nfinish off by a glorious and triumphant marriage--not her own, it is\r\ntrue, but of her making, which was more to the purpose--such was the\r\nprogramme she made out for herself with the speed of lightning, the\r\nmoment she had laid hold of the clue which guided or seemed to guide her\r\nthrough the labyrinth. It would be too lengthy a matter to go into all\r\nher tender cares for the widow\'s comfort during the rest of her stay,\r\nand the pains and delicacy with which she managed to elicit further\r\nparticulars, and to make out her brief, so to speak, while she cheered\r\nup and encouraged the witness. Miss Marjoribanks jumped to the\r\nconclusion that "poor Edward" had been, after all, but a temporary\r\ntenant of the heart, which was now again free for the reception of the\r\nArchdeacon, if he could be got to accept the conditions. When half-past\r\nsix arrived, and Thomas came for her with the great umbrella, she went\r\noff quite resplendent in her waterproof cloak, and utterly indifferent\r\nto the rain, leaving Mrs Mortimer worn out, but with a glimmer of hope\r\nin her mind. Such was the great work which, without a moment\'s\r\nhesitation, Lucilla took upon her shoulders. She had no more fear of the\r\nresult than she had of wetting her feet, which was a thing Mrs Mortimer\r\nand Thomas were both concerned about. But then Lucilla knew her own\r\nresources, and what she was capable of, and proceeded upon her way with\r\nthat unconscious calm of genius which is always so inexplicable to the\r\nordinary world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXIV_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the most unlucky moment for the weather to change, being the\r\nmiddle of July, and as near as possible to St Swithin\'s Day; but the\r\nseason had been so delightful up to that time that nobody in Carlingford\r\nat least had any reason to complain. So far as Miss Marjoribanks was\r\nconcerned, she was rather glad, on the whole, that the next day was wet,\r\nand that she could not go out all the morning, nor was likely to be\r\ninterrupted by visitors. She had all her plans to settle and mature for\r\nthe great enterprise which she had taken in hand. By this time, so far\r\nfrom feeling any personal interest in the Archdeacon, or considering\r\nherself injured by his sudden desertion, that little episode had gone\r\nout of Lucilla\'s mind as completely as if it had never been. In one\r\npoint, however, Miss Marjoribanks\'s conviction remained firm; it was\r\nimpressed upon her mind that Carlingford would not be made into a\r\nbishopric, or, if made into a bishopric, that it was not Mr Beverley who\r\nwould be chosen to occupy the new see. It was one of those instinctive\r\ncertainties which are not capable of explanation, which was thus borne\r\nin upon her spirit, and she could not have felt more sure of it had she\r\nseen it under the Queen\'s own hand and seal. While she went about her\r\nusual morning occupations, her mind was full of her great and novel\r\nundertaking. Mr Beverley was not a man to be revolutionised in a moment;\r\nand many people would have shrunk from the attempt to work in a few days\r\nor weeks, with no better arms than those of acquaintance, a change which\r\nthe influence of love had not been able to do in so many years. But it\r\nwas not in Lucilla\'s nature to be daunted by a difficulty so\r\nunimportant. There was, thank Heaven, some difference between herself\r\nand the widow, who, in a strait, could think of nothing better to do,\r\npoor soul! than to faint; and Miss Marjoribanks had the advantage of\r\nnever as yet having been beaten, whereas Mrs Mortimer had undergone\r\nnumberless defeats.\r\n\r\nThe hardest matter in the whole business, however, was the\r\nidentification of the Mr Kavan whom the Archdeacon thought he had seen\r\nin Carlingford, and was not afraid to speak of as a clever rascal and\r\nadventurer. Mr Beverley had never seen the fellow again, as he had told\r\nLucilla not many days back, and Miss Marjoribanks had been unfeignedly\r\nglad to hear it; but now matters had changed. In the course of her\r\nreflections, she decided that it would now be best that these two men,\r\nif possible, should meet and recognise each other, and that the business\r\nshould once for all be definitively settled. If all the offence he had\r\ncommitted against society was to have had a large sum of money left him\r\nby a childless old man, Lucilla saw no reason why this mysterious\r\nculprit should conceal himself; and even if he had taken a little\r\nliberty with his name, that was not a crime--his name was his own\r\nsurely, if anything was his own. At the same time, Miss Marjoribanks\r\ntook pains to impress upon herself, as it is to be hoped a friendly\r\naudience will also have the goodness to do, that she had no _real\r\nfoundation_ for her suspicions as to the identity of this personage, and\r\nmight turn out to be completely mistaken. He might have made no change\r\nwhatever on his name; he might be flourishing in some other quarter of\r\nEngland or the world, with all his antecedents perfectly well known, and\r\nunconscious of anything to be ashamed about; which, to tell the truth,\r\nwas, as Lucilla confessed to herself, a much more likely hypothesis than\r\nthe supposition which had taken such possession of her mind. But then\r\nMiss Marjoribanks had a just faith in her instincts, and in those brief\r\nbut telling pieces of evidence which supported her conclusion. She was\r\nthinking over this important branch of the subject with the greatest\r\ncare and devotion, when, looking out by chance into the rain, she saw\r\nthe Archdeacon crossing the garden. Perhaps it was just as well that she\r\nthus had warning and a moment to prepare for his visit; not that Lucilla\r\nwas a person to be taken at disadvantage; but still, in a matter so\r\npractical and pressing, it was always better to be prepared.\r\n\r\nMr Beverley came in with an air and expression so different from that\r\nwhich he had borne in their intercourse no further gone than yesterday,\r\nthat, notwithstanding the corresponding revolution in her own mind, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks could not but regard him with mingled admiration and\r\nsurprise. She judged him as the general world so often judged herself,\r\nand gave him credit for skill and courage in assuming such an attitude,\r\nwhen the fact was he was only preoccupied and natural, and did not think\r\nof his attitude at all. It did not occur to the Archdeacon that he had\r\nsinned towards Lucilla. He thought it right to explain to her his\r\nextreme surprise at the sight of Mrs Mortimer, and possibly to make her\r\naware, at the same time, of his grievances, in so far as Mrs Mortimer\r\nwas concerned; but perhaps Mr Beverley was, on the whole, innocent of\r\nthose intentions which Mrs Chiley had attributed to him, and which even\r\nLucilla, more clear-sighted, had seen dawning in their last interview;\r\nfor, to be sure, this is one of the questions which the female intellect\r\nis apt to judge in a different light from that in which it is regarded\r\nby a man. The Archdeacon, accordingly, came in preoccupied, with a cloud\r\non his brow, but without the smallest appearance of penitence or\r\ndeprecation; by which demeanour he gained, without deserving it, the\r\nrespect, and to a certain extent the admiration, of Lucilla. His\r\nexpression was not that of a man repentant, but of a man aggrieved. He\r\nhad a cloud upon his countenance, and a certain air of offence and\r\ntemper; and when he sat down, he breathed a short impatient sigh.\r\n\r\n"Thank you for receiving me so early," he said. "I called yesterday\r\nafternoon, but found you out. You must have had very particular business\r\nto take you out in that rain," Mr Beverley continued, with subdued\r\nexasperation; for naturally, being a clergyman, he was a little\r\nimpatient to find, when it was _he_ who wanted her, any of his female\r\nfriends out of the way.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lucilla, who thought it was best to open her battery boldly\r\nand at once. "I was spending the afternoon with poor Mrs Mortimer; poor\r\ndear, she is so solitary!" and to meet Mr Beverley\'s ill-temper, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks put on her most heavenly air of sympathy, and rounded her\r\nwords with a soft sigh, as different from his as a flute is from a\r\ntrumpet. It was with an exclamation of impatience that the Archdeacon\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"_Poor_ Mrs Mortimer!" he cried; "I don\'t know whether you are aware how\r\nmuch her obstinacy has cost me; and herself, I suppose," he added, in a\r\nparenthesis. "Not to depreciate your kindness, or the truly human and\r\nChristian way in which you have conducted yourself--fancy what my\r\nfeelings naturally must have been to find her an object of\r\ncharity--actually of charity! I don\'t mean to say," said Mr Beverley,\r\ncontrolling himself, "that it is degrading to accept succour when given\r\nas from man to man--quite the contrary; but you will excuse me from\r\nentering into the general question. She knew perfectly well that if I\r\nhad known where she was--if she had consented to yield to me on one\r\npoint--solely on _one_ point----"\r\n\r\n"And she such an obstinate woman!" said Miss Marjoribanks, with fine\r\nscorn. "How could you ever think of such a thing? A woman that never\r\ngives in to anybody. If you knew her as well as I do----"\r\n\r\nThe Archdeacon glanced up with a momentary intense surprise, as if it\r\nwas within the possibilities that such a change might have taken place\r\nin the widow\'s nature; and then he caught Lucilla\'s eye, and grew red\r\nand more aggrieved than ever.\r\n\r\n"Mrs Mortimer happens to be a relative of mine," he said, in his\r\nauthoritative voice. "I have known her from her youth. I am better\r\ninstructed in all her affairs than she can possibly be. When I urge her\r\nto any step, however much it may be against her inclinations, she ought\r\nto know that it can only be for her good. I beg your pardon, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. It will give me great grief to find that you, upon whose\r\nsuperior good sense I have so much calculated, should support her in her\r\nfolly. I know how much she owes to you----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, she does not owe me anything," said Lucilla. "It was just my\r\nluck, you know. I knew she would turn out to be a lady. I don\'t want to\r\nstand up for her if she is wrong; but I have only heard _her_ side. When\r\nyou tell me about it, I shall be able to form an opinion," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks added prudently; "for of course everything has two sides."\r\n\r\n"Most things," said Mr Beverley, "but this is precisely one of the\r\nthings which have not two sides. Nothing except some sort of infatuation\r\nor other--but never mind, you shall hear the facts," said the\r\nArchdeacon, once more making an effort upon himself. "Her uncle, Mr\r\nGarrett, was above eighty. Why Providence should have let him live to\r\nsuch an age to do so much mischief, Heaven alone knows. Some different\r\nrule seems to exist up _there_ about those matters, from what we find to\r\nanswer on earth," the Broad-Churchman said, with a certain air of\r\ndisapproval. "He had this young fellow to see him and then to live with\r\nhim, and took some sort of idiotic fancy to him; and when the will was\r\nmade, it was found that, with the exception of a small sum to Helen,\r\neverything was left to this impostor. No, I can\'t say I have any\r\npatience with her folly. How could any man have two opinions on the\r\nsubject? He was neither related to him, nor connected with him," cried\r\nMr Beverley, with a momentary inclination, as Lucilla thought, to get\r\naground among the pronouns, as Mrs Mortimer had done. "I do not suspect\r\nmy cousin," the Archdeacon continued, with an air so severe and\r\nindignant that it was evident he was contradicting his own sentiments,\r\n"of having any partiality for such a person; but certainly her obstinacy\r\nand determination are such----"\r\n\r\n"Hush, please," said Lucilla; "you are only laughing when you use such\r\nwords. Now, tell me one thing, and don\'t be angry if it is a stupid\r\nquestion--If there was any one that knew her and you, and perhaps him,\r\nand was to try--don\'t you think it might be arranged?"\r\n\r\n"By money?" said the Archdeacon; and he smiled one of those disagreeable\r\nsmiles which youthful writers describe by saying that his lip curled\r\nwith scorn. "You seem to take me for Mortimer, who could go into that\r\nsort of compromise. I suppose he did give them money before--before she\r\nwas left a widow," said Mr Beverley, grinding his teeth slightly with a\r\nsavage expression. "No, Miss Marjoribanks. Where everlasting truth and\r\njustice are concerned, I do not understand how things can be arranged."\r\n\r\nAfter such a truculent statement, what was the peacemaker to do? She\r\nleft the fire to blaze out by itself for a minute or two, and then she\r\ncame down upon the enemy on another wind.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I am very sorry," said Lucilla softly, "to think you should\r\nbe so fond of her and she so fond of you, and nothing but this standing\r\nin the way; and then she is too good for this world, and never thinks of\r\nherself. I often think, if anything was to happen to me--and my life is\r\nno safer than other people\'s lives," said Miss Marjoribanks, with a\r\nsigh--"what would become of her, poor dear! I am sure, if I knew of any\r\nway----As for obstinate, you know it is not in her to be obstinate. She\r\nthinks she is right, and you think you are right; and I suppose neither\r\nof you will give in," cried Lucilla. "What is anybody to do?"\r\n\r\n"If any one gives in, it should be she," said the Archdeacon. "For my\r\npart, I will never stand by and consent to such a robbery,--never. In\r\nthese matters, at least, a man must be a better judge than a woman. If\r\nyou are her friend you will persuade her of her duty," Mr Beverley\r\nadded; and he did not show so much as a symptom of yielding. To say that\r\nMiss Marjoribanks was not discouraged would be more than the truth; but\r\nshe was still at the beginning of her forces, and no thought of giving\r\nin was in her courageous soul.\r\n\r\n"I will tell you what occurs to me," said Lucilla frankly. "Let us find\r\nout something about him. Do you know anything about him? If she were to\r\nhear that he was, as you say, an impostor, you know, and a\r\nvillain?--What is his name?--Where does he live?--Is he a very, very\r\nwicked man?" said Miss Marjoribanks, and she looked up with that\r\ningenuous look of appeal, which was always so touching in her, to the\r\nArchdeacon\'s face.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr Beverley, in his haste and excitement, he gave vent to two\r\nvery contradictory statements. "She knows all about him. I don\'t know\r\nanything about him," he said, with some heat. "I mean, she knows as much\r\nas I do, though she draws such a different conclusion. I am sure I saw\r\nhim in Carlingford the first day I was here. For anything I can tell,\r\nshe knows _more_ of him than I do," said the Broad Churchman, with a\r\nsudden flash of jealousy and anger. It occurred to Lucilla then for the\r\nfirst time that she had found the grand clue to the whole.\r\n\r\n"That would be dreadful," said Miss Marjoribanks, "if she knew him, and\r\nwas keeping him out of the way till you were gone. I did not think of\r\nthat. If such a thing should be the case, fond as I am of Mrs Mortimer,\r\nI never could go near her any more," said Lucilla sadly. "Oh, don\'t say\r\nyou think so, please. I should have to give her up, and that would be\r\ndreadful; for I owe it to papa, when he gives me so much liberty, to be\r\nvery careful. Oh, Mr Beverley, don\'t say you think so," cried Lucilla,\r\ndeeply moved. She put her handkerchief to her eyes, and yet she kept\r\nwatch upon the Archdeacon through one of the corners. He had got up by\r\nthis time, and was walking about the room like any other man in trouble.\r\nTo throw suspicion on the widow, or separate her from so effectual a\r\nprotector, was the very last thing he had any inclination to do: for, to\r\ntell the truth, he made that jealous suggestion only in order to receive\r\nan indignant denial, and to be assured that such a thing was impossible.\r\nBut then Mr Beverley did not know whom he had to deal with, nor that he\r\nwas not the first man whom Miss Marjoribanks had reduced to his proper\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n"If that was the case," said Lucilla, drying her eyes, "dreadful as it\r\nis to think of it--oh, Mr Beverley, if such a thing were the case--it\r\nwould be far better for her to marry him, and then she would have all\r\nthe fortune without going to law. If things have gone so far, though it\r\nis miserable to think of it, and to believe that she could be so\r\nunkind," said Miss Marjoribanks, with a sob, "and so double-minded, and\r\nso deceitful to _me_----"\r\n\r\n"In Heaven\'s name what are you thinking of?" said the Archdeacon. He had\r\ngrown as pale as he was before red, and came to a dead stop in front of\r\nLucilla, and stood lowering and menacing over her. His shadow was so big\r\nand strong, and stood so directly between her and the window, that Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s heart gave one bound of something like alarm.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mr Beverley," said Lucilla, "try and compose yourself. It would be\r\na dreadful trial to me, but I should endeavour to bear it. If we love\r\nher, we should, on the contrary, urge her to do it," said the young\r\nmoralist, with solemnity, "however hard it may be to us. It would be\r\nbetter than--than dreadful concealment and misery--it would be better\r\nthan knowing and not telling, as you say. Oh, Mr Beverley, if you are\r\nsure that is the case, let us both go to her, and beg her to marry him.\r\nI could never, never, never see her again," sobbed Lucilla, "but she\r\nwould be happy, and that would be the end of all."\r\n\r\nThe Archdeacon, though he was not a weakling, was altogether stunned by\r\nthis address. He sank into the nearest chair, and drew it closer to\r\nLucilla, and looked perfectly flabby and ghastly in his white tie, with\r\nhis alarmed countenance. "For the sake of all that is sacred," said Mr\r\nBeverley, bending forward towards her, "tell me what foundation you\r\nhave--tell me all you know."\r\n\r\nNow was the critical moment, and Lucilla felt it. If Mrs Chiley, for\r\nexample, had only advised herself to come in then instead of\r\ninterrupting people\'s proposals, and driving a likely suitor to\r\ndesperation! But such happy chances do not occur at the real crises of\r\nlife. What she wanted was, naturally, not to explain herself, but to let\r\nthat arrow rankle in her opponent\'s heart until it should have served\r\nher purpose. All that she said in answer to Mr Beverley\'s appeal was to\r\nhide her face in her handkerchief, which was the only means that\r\noccurred to her for the moment of gaining a little time for reflection.\r\n\r\n"It is so hard to have such thoughts put into one\'s head," said Lucilla,\r\n"of a person who has been one\'s friend. And she always looked so nice\r\nand so true! I never thought she would deceive any one. I thought she\r\nwas so transparent, you know. Oh, Mr Beverley, it is so dreadful to be\r\ndisappointed in one\'s friends! I wish I had never heard of it--I wish\r\nyou had never told me. I almost wish, though it is dreadful to say such\r\na thing, that you had never come to Carlingford and found it all out."\r\n\r\n"My dear Miss Marjoribanks," said the Archdeacon solemnly, "I implore\r\nyou, as the greatest kindness you can do me, to tell me all you know."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I don\'t know what I know," said Lucilla, partially raising her\r\nface out of her handkerchief; "I don\'t think I know anything, for my\r\npart. I always thought if one could rely upon any one, one could rely\r\nupon her--for truthfulness, and for yieldingness, and doing what any one\r\nasked her. I did think so; and it is perfectly bewildering to think,\r\nafter all, that she should be obstinate and deceiving, and yet look so\r\ndifferent!" said Lucilla. "But if it has come to that, we must be firm,\r\nMr Beverley. If you ask my opinion, I say she should be allowed to marry\r\nhim. That would solve everything, you know," Miss Marjoribanks added,\r\nwith sad decision. "She would get all the fortune without going to law,\r\nand she would be settled, and off one\'s mind. That would be my final\r\nadvice, if everything has happened as you say."\r\n\r\nMr Beverley was driven as nearly out of his senses by this counsel as it\r\nwas possible for a man of ordinary self-control and warm temper to be.\r\nHe got up again and made a stride to and fro, and wiped the moisture\r\nfrom his forehead, which, as Lucilla remarked at the moment, had a\r\nLow-Church look, which she would not have expected from him. But, on the\r\nother hand, he gave vent to some stifled and unintelligible exclamations\r\nwhich, whatever they might be, were not blessings. Then he came to\r\nhimself a little, which was what Miss Marjoribanks was most afraid of,\r\nand stood over her, large and imposing as before.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, for Heaven\'s sake, what you mean!" cried the Archdeacon. "You\r\ndo not think, surely, that I for a moment meant to imply that Helen\r\nwould waste a thought upon such a miscreant. Good Heavens, marry him!\r\nYou must be raving. She would as soon think of--going for a soldier,"\r\nsaid Mr Beverley, with a hoarse and perfectly unmirthful laugh, "or\r\ndoing anything else that was mad and unnatural. That is how you women\r\nstand up for your friends--always ready to suggest something\r\ninconceivably horrible and debasing! Happily you always go too far," he\r\nadded, once more wiping his forehead. It was a very Low-Church, not to\r\nsay Dissenterish, sort of thing to do, and it unconsciously reduced her\r\nadversary\'s dignity in Miss Marjoribanks\'s opinion, besides affording a\r\nproof that he was not nearly so much convinced of what he said, as he\r\nprofessed to be, in his secret heart.\r\n\r\n"Mr Beverley, I think you forget a little," said Lucilla, with dignity.\r\n"I know nobody but yourself who has any suspicions of Mrs Mortimer. If\r\nit had been anybody but you, I should have laughed at them. But to\r\nreturn to the question," Miss Marjoribanks added, with calm grace: "I\r\nalways used to be taught at Mount Pleasant that feelings had nothing to\r\ndo with an abstract subject. I don\'t see, for my part, now you have\r\nmentioned it, why she should not marry him. It would arrange the money\r\nmatter without any trouble; and I have always heard he was very nice,"\r\nsaid the bold experimentalist, fixing her eyes calmly upon the\r\nArchdeacon\'s face. "I am sure I should never have thought of it, if it\r\nhad been left to me; but speaking calmly, I don\'t see the objections,\r\nnow it has been proposed. Oh, it is only the bell for luncheon that\r\nThomas is ringing. Is it actually half-past one? and I expect some\r\npeople," said Lucilla. She got up as she spoke and went to the mirror,\r\nand looked at herself with that beautiful simplicity which was one of\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s distinguishing features. "When one has been crying\r\nit always shows," she said, with a little anxiety. As for Mr Beverley,\r\nhis state of mind, as the newspapers say, could better be imagined than\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n"I must go away," he said, taking up his hat. "I don\'t feel capable of\r\nmeeting strangers after this exciting conversation. Miss Marjoribanks,"\r\ncontinued the Archdeacon, taking her hand, and holding it fast over his\r\nhat to give emphasis to his address, "at least I can trust to you not to\r\nbreathe a word to Mrs Mortimer--not a syllable--of the horrible\r\nsuggestion which has got utterance, I don\'t know how. I may surely trust\r\nto your honour," Mr Beverley said, with emphasis; but by this time Miss\r\nMarjoribanks considered it time to bring the crisis to an end.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would stay to luncheon," she said; "there are only one or\r\ntwo of my friends. As for _honour_, you know you gentlemen say that we\r\nhave no sense of honour," said Lucilla airily; "and to think that two\r\nwomen could be together and not talk of what might perhaps be a\r\nmarriage----"\r\n\r\nAt this moment some one rang the door-bell. Lucilla knew perfectly well\r\nthat it was only the baker, but it could not be expected that the\r\nArchdeacon should be similarly initiated into the secrets of the house.\r\nHe thought, as was natural, that it was the people she expected, and\r\nalmost wrung her hand as he let it go. "You will let me see you again\r\nfirst," he said, in a tone of entreaty. "Before you see her, you will\r\nlet me see you again. For Heaven\'s sake don\'t refuse me," cried Mr\r\nBeverley. If anybody had but heard him! as Lucilla said to herself the\r\nminute he was gone. And the truth was that Thomas did hear him, who had\r\njust opened the door to tell his young mistress that her luncheon was\r\nwaiting, and whom the Archdeacon did all but knock downstairs in his\r\nsudden and unlooked-for exit. The impression naturally conveyed to\r\nThomas by these words was of the clearest and most distinct description.\r\nHe was even known to say afterwards, "That he never knew a gentleman as\r\nspoke more plain." But Mr Beverley rushed downstairs, without thinking\r\nof Thomas, in a most unenviable frame of mind, into the rain. He was\r\nmore afraid of meeting Miss Marjoribanks\'s friends than a man of his\r\nsize and principles should have been afraid of meeting anybody; but then\r\nthere is a vast distinction, as everybody is aware, and no one more than\r\nthe Archdeacon, between physical and moral strength.\r\n\r\nAs for Lucilla, her tears and anxieties passed off in a miraculous\r\nmanner as soon as her visitor was gone. She went downstairs and ate her\r\nluncheon with the serenest brow and a most agreeable ladylike appetite.\r\nAnd it was not a fib, as may perhaps be supposed, that she was expecting\r\npeople--for at that hour Miss Marjoribanks always did expect people,\r\nwho, to be sure, might be kept back by the rain, but whom she was always\r\njustified in looking for. Perhaps, on the whole, notwithstanding her\r\nwarm sense of the duties of hospitality, Lucilla was glad that it rained\r\nso heavily, and that nobody came. She had a great deal to think of as\r\nshe took her maidenly and delicate repast. The first step had been\r\ntaken, and taken triumphantly. Henceforward, whatever the Archdeacon\'s\r\nillusions might be, he could no longer stand calm upon his eminence, and\r\nconclude that it was he, and he alone, who could raise the widow from\r\nher lowly estate. Lucilla, it is true, knew that no such idea as that of\r\nmarrying her uncle\'s heir would ever present itself to Mrs Mortimer; and\r\nthat--at least so far as Miss Marjoribanks\'s information went--such a\r\nthought was equally removed from the mind of the personage unknown, whom\r\nMr Beverley denounced as an impostor. But this did not in the least\r\naffect the value of the suggestion as an instrument to be used against\r\nthe Archdeacon, who was big enough to defend himself, and on whose\r\naccount the young philanthropist had no compunctions. The first step was\r\nthus taken, and taken successfully, but it was only after this that the\r\nreal difficulties began; and Lucilla knew no more as yet how she was to\r\nfind and identify, not to say assail and vanquish, the other side, the\r\nmysterious Mr Kavan, the man whom the Archdeacon abused and the widow\r\ndefended, than even the greatest military genius knows at the\r\ncommencement of the first campaign how to conduct the second. This was\r\nwhat she considered so closely as she sat alone in the dull afternoon.\r\nShe did not go to Mrs Mortimer, because it was impossible that every day\r\ncould be a half-holiday, and because, on the whole, she judged it best\r\nnot to subject herself, in the present undeveloped state of the\r\nposition, to much questioning; but she sent her a little note to satisfy\r\nher mind, telling her to keep herself easy, and not to let the\r\nArchdeacon bully her, and to confide in the devotion of her affectionate\r\nLucilla. When she had thus satisfied the immediate demands of\r\nfriendship, Miss Marjoribanks took her work and sat down to reflect.\r\nNothing could be more exciting than the position in which she found\r\nherself; but the difficulties were only such as stimulated her genius;\r\nand then it was not any selfish advantage, but the good of her neighbour\r\nin its most sublime manifestation--the good of her neighbour who had\r\ninjured her, and been insensible to her attractions, which, according to\r\nthe world in general, is the one thing unpardonable to a woman--which\r\nLucilla sought. And it was not even the scriptural coals of fire she was\r\nthinking of as she pondered her great undertaking in her mind. The\r\nenterprise might not be free from a touch of human vanity, but it was\r\nvanity of a loftier description: the pleasure of exercising a great\r\nfaculty, and the natural confidence of genius in its own powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXV_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Lucilla\'s long and mature reflection was that next morning\r\nbeing fine and all the clouds dispersed, she went out with her usual\r\nfirm step and self-possession, and, what was rather unusual with her,\r\nexcept on necessary occasions of ceremony, knocked at Mrs Woodburn\'s\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nMrs Woodburn and Miss Marjoribanks had never, as people say, taken to\r\neach other. They were as different in their ways as it is possible to\r\nimagine. The mimic was a little indolent, and would not take the trouble\r\nto make any exertions for the good of the community, except in the\r\nexercise of her peculiar talent, though she had been known, when\r\nexcited, to go through real fatigue for that; but she had none of the\r\nsteady force, the persevering energy--or, to sum up all in one word, the\r\ngenius--of Miss Marjoribanks, who, for her part, recognised the _use_ of\r\nsuch an instrument of entertainment as Mrs Woodburn possessed without\r\nappreciating it in her own person; for Lucilla had no sense of humour,\r\nas she candidly admitted, with that consciousness of her own faults, and\r\nslight disposition to consider them virtues, which is common to persons\r\nof great endowments. It was accordingly with a slight sense of effort on\r\nboth sides that they met thus in the familiarity of an early visit, at a\r\nmoment when people doing their duty to each other in a ceremonial way\r\nwould not have thought of calling. She was aware that Mrs Woodburn\r\nregarded her, even when she kissed her in the most neighbourly and\r\naffectionate manner, with a look which seemed to say, "What can she\r\nwant, coming here so early?" As for Lucilla, she was too wise to pretend\r\nthat it was a mere visit of regard. She was too wise, and her\r\ninterlocutor was too clever, and prone to catch every touch of\r\nexpression, though Miss Marjoribanks flattered herself she had\r\nsufficient experience to enable her to dismiss, when there was occasion\r\nfor it, all expression from her face. But such was not her policy at\r\nthis moment. When the two faces had touched each other in that loving\r\nand sisterly salutation, their owners immediately separated, and\r\nregarded each other from two opposite chairs, without decided\r\nhostility, it is true, but with the watchful air of two people whom the\r\nfates may range on different sides, and whom it behoves to be mutually\r\nwatchful. And Lucilla thought it the most expedient course, under the\r\ncircumstances, to begin her investigations at once.\r\n\r\n"I have come to make an inquisition," she said; "I may as well confess\r\nit at once, for you would find me out if I didn\'t. Mrs Woodburn, where\r\nis Mr Cavendish? I am not going to put up with it any longer. He must be\r\nwritten to, and had back again. The only man that was to be depended\r\nupon in Carlingford!" said Lucilla; "and to think he should disappear\r\nlike this and never say a word!"\r\n\r\nMrs Woodburn fairly gasped in her companion\'s face. She could no more\r\ntell what this meant, than if she had been a person utterly unacquainted\r\nwith human motives and ways of working; and, indeed, it was only the\r\ntricks of the surface for which she had any real insight. "My brother!"\r\nshe exclaimed, with something between an impulse of defence and denial,\r\nand a quite opposite instinct of confidence. Had he proposed, after all,\r\nwithout telling his sister? Had Lucilla a right to ask the question she\r\nuttered so frankly? Had he been prudent for once in his life, and\r\nsecured this sensible alliance and prop to his position? All these\r\nquestions rushed at lightning-speed through Mrs Woodburn\'s mind; but she\r\nwas not so prompt as Miss Marjoribanks would have been under the\r\ncircumstances, and all she did was to open her eyes wide, and give a\r\nstart on her chair, and say, "My brother?" with a voice which trembled,\r\nand was half extinguished by surprise.\r\n\r\n"Yes; Mr Cavendish," said Lucilla. "Do tell me his address. There is not\r\na man in Carlingford who is good for anything, now that he is gone. You\r\nmust see that as well as I do. As for flirting, I have always said he\r\nwas the only man that knew anything about it. Do tell me where he is,\r\nand I will write to him; or, please, send him word for me, that\r\nabsolutely he must come back. We are all dying for him, you may say."\r\n\r\nMrs Woodburn had recovered a little, and found a moment to think, but\r\nher faculties were not so handy, except in her own particular way, as\r\nmight have been expected from such a clever woman. She could even at\r\nthat moment have taken off Miss Marjoribanks to the life, but she was in\r\nthe most profound bewilderment as to what Lucilla could mean; whether\r\nshe was really laying herself out to "catch" Mr Cavendish, or whether\r\nshe was merely talking nonsense without any particular meaning; or\r\nwhether she was feigning indifference by way of getting information; and\r\nthe stupidest person in Carlingford would have acquitted herself as well\r\nas Mrs Woodburn felt able to do in the emergency. "I should think he\r\nwould rather hear that some of you were willing to live for him," she\r\nsaid, in a tremulous way; finding nothing better come to her lips than\r\nthe echo of an old compliment, which went against her nature, but yet\r\nwith an instinct of serving her brother so far as it might be in her\r\npower.\r\n\r\n"Not me," said Lucilla frankly. "Some people once thought so, you know;\r\nbut I can\'t say I ever thought so. There never will be anything about\r\nliving or dying between him and me. I hope we know better," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks; "besides, if I were so much as to think of that sort of\r\nthing I should feel I was swindling papa. Oh, no; I assure you I am\r\nquite disinterested. I want him for my Thursdays. Do write, and say he\r\nmust come home."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like people to be too disinterested," said Mrs Woodburn; "and I\r\ndon\'t think Harry would be at all glad to hear it. I wish he would come\r\nback, I am sure. I am always bullying him about it. I thought perhaps\r\nsome of you young ladies had been unkind to him," said the anxious\r\nsister, who had recovered her head, and thought it might be possible to\r\nget at the secret, if there was a secret, by means like this.\r\n\r\n"No," said Miss Marjoribanks; "_I_ have not been unkind to him; and\r\nthere is nobody else I know of," said the candid Lucilla, "unless poor\r\nBarbara; and _she_ will never be unkind, you know. I will write him a\r\nletter if you will give me his address. Is it true that somebody has\r\nleft him a great deal of money, and he is going to change his name?"\r\n\r\n"His name!" said Mrs Woodburn, with a little cry, like an imprudent\r\nwoman; and then she recovered herself. "I have not heard of anything of\r\nthe kind," she said, "and he would be sure to tell me of it; but in\r\nCarlingford people know things before they happen. I should be very glad\r\nto know that somebody was going to leave him a great deal of money; but\r\nI don\'t know about the name----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I heard it only in a confused sort of way," said Lucilla, "or that\r\nhe _had_ changed his name. I am sure I don\'t know if it was past or\r\npresent. Did he ever make any change to be somebody\'s heir? Oh, I beg\r\nyour pardon; but you know people do it every day."\r\n\r\nMrs Woodburn had grown quite pale--perhaps because she began to see that\r\nthere was some method in these questions, perhaps with simple and\r\nunreasonable fright at the suggestion. She could not say a word for a\r\nmoment, so startling was the question; and then there was something in\r\nLucilla\'s early visit, and in her instant onslaught upon Mr Cavendish,\r\nwhich was alarming. She was so frightened and driven into a corner that\r\nshe could not tell how to answer. It occurred to her all at once that\r\nperhaps Mr Cavendish had opened his heart to Miss Marjoribanks and given\r\nher an inkling of his secret; and what would Lucilla think if she\r\ncontradicted her brother? Never was a poor woman in a greater\r\ndifficulty. All her fun and her mimicry collapsed. She no more noticed\r\nthe peculiarities of Lucilla\'s look and manner than if she had been an\r\nordinary inhabitant of Grange Lane. "Changed his name?" she faltered, in\r\na blank sort of interrogative way; and in spite of herself faltered and\r\nshook, and conveyed to Lucilla the most perfect assurance that what she\r\nsupposed was true.\r\n\r\n"When it is for a great deal of money there is some sense in it; when it\r\nis only for a prettier name it is dreadfully stupid. Don\'t you think so?\r\nAs if we all could have pretty names!" said Lucilla. "I should like so\r\nmuch to have a talk with Mr Cavendish. I picked up some very, very old\r\nfriends of his the other day--people who used to know him long ago. I am\r\nsure he would be interested if he were to know."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it could be him," said Mrs Woodburn, with something like\r\nthe instinct of despair; "I don\'t remember any very old friends he has;\r\nit is so long a time ago----" and then the poor lady stopped short, as\r\nif she had something choking her in her throat. "I don\'t think it could\r\nbe he."\r\n\r\n"Not such a very long time," said Lucilla, in her easy way. "It is\r\ndreadful to give him a character for being old. Do write him, please,\r\nand tell him about those people. He is sure to be interested if you say\r\nit is a lady, and a pretty woman, and a widow," continued Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. "She says he was once very kind to her when her poor\r\nhusband was alive."\r\n\r\nMrs Woodburn recovered herself a little as Lucilla spoke. "It must have\r\nbeen some other Mr Cavendish," she said. "Harry was--so much abroad--so\r\nlong away from home----" At that moment there was a sound in the house\r\nof a heavy step, and Mr Woodburn\'s whistle became audible in the\r\ndistance. Then the poor woman, who had a secret, fixed haggard eyes upon\r\nMiss Marjoribanks. She dared not say, "Don\'t speak of this before my\r\nhusband." She dared not utter a word to awaken suspicion on one side or\r\nthe other. She knew very well that if Mr Woodburn heard of the existence\r\nof any old friends of his brother-in-law, he would insist upon having\r\nthem produced, and "paying them some attention"; and at the same time\r\nMrs Woodburn could not so far confide in Lucilla as to beg her to keep\r\nsilent. This was what her brother\'s poltroonery brought upon the\r\nunfortunate woman. And when the emergency came she was not as equal to\r\nit as she expected to be. Her talents were not of a nature to do her any\r\ngood in such a strait. She collapsed entirely, and looked round her in a\r\nflutter of fright and despair, as if to find some means of escape.\r\n\r\nBut this terror all arose from the fact that she did not know Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, who was generous as she was strong, and had no intention\r\nof going to extremities. Lucilla got up from her chair when she heard Mr\r\nWoodburn\'s whistle coming nearer. "I hear somebody coming," she said,\r\n"and I must not stay, for I have quantities of things to do. Only mind\r\nyou tell Mr Cavendish I have something quite serious to say to him from\r\nhis old friend; and from me, please to tell him, that it is _impossible_\r\nto get on without him," continued Lucilla, as Mr Woodburn entered the\r\nroom. "There is not a soul that can flirt or do anything. I should write\r\nto him myself if I knew his address."\r\n\r\nAnd then, as was natural, Woodburn, with his usual absurdity, as his\r\nwife explained afterwards, struck in with some boisterous _badinage_. As\r\nfor Mrs Woodburn, in her mingled terror and relief, she was too much\r\nexcited to know what he said. But when Lucilla, serenely smiling, was\r\ngone, the mimic, with her nerves strung to desperation, burst into the\r\nwildest comic travesty of Miss Marjoribanks\'s looks and manners, and her\r\ninquiries about Harry, and sent her unsuspicious husband into\r\nconvulsions of laughter. He laughed until the tears ran down his\r\ncheeks--the unconscious simpleton; and all the time his wife could have\r\nliked to throw him down and trample on him, or put pins into him, or\r\nscratch his beaming, jovial countenance. Perhaps she would have gone\r\ninto hysterics instead if she had not possessed that other safety-valve,\r\nfor Mrs Woodburn had not that supreme composure and self-command which\r\nbelonged to Lucilla\'s higher organisation. She wrote a long letter that\r\nafternoon, and had a dreadful headache all the evening after it, which,\r\nconsidering all things, was to be expected under the circumstances, and\r\nwas a weak-minded woman\'s last resource.\r\n\r\nNo headache, however, disturbed Miss Marjoribanks\'s beneficent progress.\r\nShe went home conscious that, if she had not acquired any distinct\r\ninformation, she had at least gained a moral certainty. And besides, she\r\nhad measured the forces of Mr Cavendish\'s bodyguard, and had found them\r\nutterly unequal to any prolonged resistance. All that was wanted was\r\nprudence and care, and that good luck which was as much an endowment in\r\nits way as the other qualities by which Lucilla might be said to have\r\nsecured it. She went home meditating her next step, and with a certain\r\nenjoyment in the sense of difficulty and the consciousness of how much\r\nskill and power would be required to carry on three different threads of\r\ninnocent intrigue with the three different persons in the drama, without\r\never letting the general web get confused, or confounding one strand\r\nwith another. She had to frighten the Archdeacon with the idea that Mrs\r\nMortimer might marry the impostor, and she had to keep the widow in the\r\nprofoundest ignorance of this suggestion, and she had to manage and\r\nguide the impostor himself, to save his position, and deliver him from\r\nhis enemies, and make his would-be persecutor for ever harmless. If by\r\nchance she should forget herself for a moment, and say to Mr Beverley\r\nwhat she meant for Mr Cavendish, or betray her mode of dealing with\r\neither to the third person interested, then farewell to all her hopes.\r\nBut when all that was required was skill and self-possession and\r\ncourage, Miss Marjoribanks knew herself too well to be afraid.\r\n\r\nShe came in with that sense of having done her duty which is so sweet to\r\na well-regulated mind. But it was not to that internal satisfaction\r\nalone that Providence limited Lucilla\'s reward. There are exceptional\r\ncases to be found here and there even in this world, in which virtue\r\nfinds its just acknowledgment, and disinterested well-doing is\r\nrecompensed as it deserves. While Miss Marjoribanks was still occupied\r\nwith the arrangement of her plans she was interrupted by a visitor, who\r\nentered with a brow clouded by care, and yet exalted by the sense of a\r\ncharge and dignity which is not afforded to every woman. It was Mrs\r\nCentum who thus came to unfold to Lucilla the new event which was about\r\nto happen in Carlingford. She had a great deal to say first, as was\r\nnatural, of the dreadful vexation of such a thing happening in\r\nholiday-time when the boys were all at home, and when she did not know\r\nwhat to do.\r\n\r\n"But you know, Lucilla, it will be delightful for all you young ladies\r\nto have the officers," said Mrs Centum; "it keeps a place lively;\r\nthough, for my part, I always say in six months there will not be a\r\nservant in the house that one can depend upon. It is dreadful for\r\nservants--especially young ones, and if they are nice-looking, you know;\r\nbut it is very nice for the young ladies, and for all the picnics and\r\ndances and everything----"\r\n\r\n"What officers?" said Lucilla, pricking up her ears--for to tell the\r\ntruth, the very name of officers in a place like Carlingford, where\r\nnobody could flirt but Mr Cavendish, was as water in the desert to Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s soul.\r\n\r\n"Has not the Doctor told you?" said Mrs Centum--"but, to be sure, very\r\nfew people know as yet. Mr Centum says it must be all on your account,\r\nbecause you give such nice parties--but of course that is only his fun,\r\nyou know. However, I suppose somebody has told Lord Palmerston of all\r\nthose great buildings that were meant for the factories, and of\r\nCarlingford being such a healthy place. And so the General is coming to\r\nus to-morrow, Lucilla--General Travers, you know, that was in all the\r\npapers for something he did in India; Charles used to know him at\r\nschool. He is quite handsome, and has ever so many medals and things. It\r\nis a dreadful addition to one\'s troubles in holiday-time, you know; but,\r\nmy dear, I hope you will ask him to your Thursdays, and help us to make\r\nCarlingford pleasant to him. It all depends upon him," said Mrs Centum\r\nsolemnly;--"if he likes the place, and thinks it will do, and finds nice\r\nsociety--whether it is here or at Hampton that they establish the\r\ndepot."\r\n\r\n"At Hampton!" cried Miss Marjoribanks naturally excited--"the stupidest,\r\nwretchedest little place----"\r\n\r\n"That is just what Mr Centum says," said the visitor, with a sigh; "what\r\nI am nervous about is the servants, Lucilla; and you know that\r\nunder-nurse of mine, what a nice steady girl she has always been, and\r\nsuch a comfort--but as soon as the soldiers come it turns their heads. I\r\nwant you to tell me, if you\'ll be so very good, Lucilla, how Nancy makes\r\nthat _pat\xe9_ that Mr Centum is so fond of. I know it is a good deal to\r\nask; but I am sure you are one to stand by your friends; and if the\r\nGeneral should take a dislike to Carlingford through any fault of mine,\r\nI never could forgive myself; and I want you to ask him to your\r\nThursdays, Lucilla--there\'s a dear."\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Centum," cried Miss Marjoribanks, "papa must call on the\r\nGeneral and ask him to dinner: as for my Thursdays, I always say they\r\nare not parties; they are only _evenings_," said Lucilla sweetly, "and\r\nnot worth a gentleman\'s while."\r\n\r\n"And about the _pat\xe9_, Lucilla," said Mrs Centum anxiously, "I hope you\r\nwon\'t think it too much of me to ask;--you are so clever, you know, and\r\nso is Nancy: and what with the noise, and the nursery dinners, and all\r\nthose big boys home from school----"\r\n\r\nMrs Centum fixed her eyes with true solicitude on Lucilla\'s face. Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was magnanimous, but the _pat\xe9_ in question was one of the\r\ngreatest triumphs of the Doctor\'s table. She thought, and with truth,\r\nthat it _was_ a great deal for any one to ask; but then it is true that\r\ngenius has duties as well as privileges; and to impress upon mediocrity\r\nthe benefit of loyally following and copying superior intelligence, is\r\nof itself a moral effect of the greatest importance. And besides, the\r\nwoman who at such a moment produced a live General in Carlingford, and\r\nheld out hopes of officers, was not a woman to be denied.\r\n\r\n"I will write it down for you," said Lucilla graciously, "if you think\r\nyour cook will understand; or perhaps Nancy might step in and show her\r\nhow--if I can persuade Nancy. Dear Mrs Centum, I hope you will always\r\nfeel sure that I am ready to do anything for my friends."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you, dear," cried the grateful woman; "I knew you were not\r\none to mind; and if Nancy would be so very kind----I am sure you will\r\nlike the General," added Mrs Centum, with effusion; "he will live here,\r\nyou know, if the depot comes, and be such an addition! I said to\r\nCharles, the moment he told me, That would just be the very thing for\r\nLucilla! And he is quite young looking, and so nice and pleasant," she\r\nadded, in the fulness of her enthusiasm and gratitude. As for Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, she shook her head, but nevertheless received the\r\nassurance with a smile.\r\n\r\n"It is not that sort of thing I am thinking of," said Lucilla: "if it\r\nhad been, I need never have come home; and now, after papa has been so\r\nkind about the drawing-room----; but I am always glad to hear of nice\r\nnew people," said Miss Marjoribanks; "and to meet a man that has been in\r\nthe world is such a pleasure to papa."\r\n\r\nWith this benign acknowledgment of the General\'s merits, Lucilla\r\nreceived Mrs Centum\'s affectionate leave-takings. To be sure, she knew\r\nnothing, and did not occupy herself much at that moment about General\r\nTravers. But at the same time Miss Marjoribanks, with her usual piety,\r\nrecognised the approval of Providence in this new occurrence, and was\r\nnaturally both encouraged and exhilarated. It is but in rare cases, as\r\nhas been said, that the reward of virtue is given so promptly, and with\r\nsuch beautiful discrimination: and there are even people in the world\r\nwho profess to have no faith in any prompt or visible recompense. But\r\nLucilla was not of that new and heretical school. For her own part, she\r\nfelt it very natural that her exertions for the good of her kind should\r\nthus be recognised and acknowledged, and returned to her plans with that\r\nsweet and exhilarating sense of moral harmony, which an approving\r\nHeaven, and a sense of blessings earned and goodness recompensed, are so\r\nwell calculated to give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXVI_\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s mind had scarcely subsided out of the first\r\nexhilarating sense of a great many things to do, and a truly important\r\nmission in hand, when little Rose Lake sought her with that confession\r\nof family troubles, and prayer for counsel and aid in the extremity,\r\nwhich opened a new way and mode of working to Lucilla. Rose was proud,\r\npoor little soul, not only of her exceptional position, and that of her\r\nfamily, as a family of artists, but also with a constitutional and\r\nindividual pride as one of the natural conservators of domestic honour,\r\nwho would rather have died than have heard the Lakes lightly spoken of,\r\nor upbraided with debt or indecorum, or any other crime. She had been\r\nsilent as long as she could about Barbara\'s shortcomings, jealously\r\nconcealing them from all the world, and attacking them with a violence\r\nwhich made her big elder sister, who was twice as big and six times as\r\nstrong as she, tremble before her when they were alone. But little Rose\r\nhad at length found things come to a point beyond which her experience\r\ndid not go. Barbara began to have secret meetings with a man whose\r\npresence nobody was aware of, and who did not come openly to the house\r\nto seek her, and persevered, in spite of all remonstrances, in this\r\nclandestine career; and all the prejudices and all the instincts of the\r\nyoung artist rose up against her. A vague presentiment of greater evil\r\nbehind impelled her to some action, and shame and pride combined at the\r\nsame time to keep her silent. She could not speak to her father, because\r\nthe poor man lost his head straightway, and made piteous appeals to her\r\nnot to make a fuss, and threw the burden back again upon her with a\r\ndouble weight; and besides, he was only a man, though he was her father,\r\nand Rose had the pride of a woman in addition to her other pride. In\r\nthese painful circumstances, it occurred to her to consult Lucilla, who\r\nhad been, as has been recounted in an early part of this history, a\r\ngreat authority at Mount Pleasant, where her heroic belief in herself\r\nled, as was natural, others to believe in her. And then Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was one of the people who can keep counsel; and Rose felt,\r\nbesides, that Lucilla had been injured, and had not revenged herself,\r\nand that to put confidence in her would be, to a certain extent, to make\r\nup for the offence. All these motives, combined with an intolerable\r\nsense of having upon her shoulders a burden greater than she could bear,\r\ndrove the young artist at last to Grange Lane, where Lucilla, as we have\r\nsaid, was still in the state of mental exhilaration and excitement\r\nnaturally consequent upon having a very important piece of work in hand.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what to do," said Rose; "I made up my mind I never would\r\nsay a word to any one. It is so strange she should have no proper pride!\r\nbut then it is dreadful to think, what if anything should come of it!\r\nthough I am sure I don\'t know what could come of it; but they might run\r\naway, or something; and then people are so fond of talking. I thought\r\nfor a long time, if I only knew some nice old lady; but then I don\'t\r\nsuppose there are any nice old ladies in Carlingford," added the\r\nPreraphaelist, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you little monster!" cried Lucilla, "there is Mrs Chiley, the\r\ndearest old----; but never mind, make haste and tell me all the same."\r\n\r\n"Lucilla," said Rose solemnly, "we are not great people like you; we\r\nare not rich, nor able to have all we like, and everybody to visit us;\r\nbut, all the same, we have our Pride. The honour of a family is just as\r\nprecious whether people live," said the young artist, with a certain\r\nseverity, "in Grove Street or in Grange Lane."\r\n\r\nThis exordium had its natural effect upon Miss Marjoribanks; her\r\nimagination leaped forward a long way beyond the reality which her\r\ncompanion talked of so solemnly, and she changed her colour a little, as\r\neven a woman of her experience might be excused for doing in the\r\npresence of something terrible and disastrous so near at hand.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would not frighten me," said Lucilla; "I am very sorry for\r\nyou, you dear little Rose. You are only a baby yourself, and ought not\r\nto have any bother. Tell me all about it, there\'s a dear."\r\n\r\nBut these soothing tones were too much for Rose\'s composure. She cried,\r\nand her cheeks flushed, and her dewy eyes enlarged and lightened when\r\nthey had thrown off a little part of their oppression in the form of\r\nthose hot salt tears. Miss Marjoribanks had never seen her look so\r\npretty, and said so to herself, with a momentary and perfectly\r\ndisinterested regret that there was "nobody" to see her--a regret which\r\nprobably changed its character before Rose left the house. But in the\r\nmeantime Lucilla soothed her and kissed her, and took off her hat and\r\nshed her pretty curls off her forehead. These curls were not by any\r\nmeans so strong and vehement in their twist as Miss Marjoribanks\'s own,\r\nbut hung loosely and softly with the "sweet neglect" of the poet. "You\r\nwould look very nice if you would take a little pains," Lucilla said, in\r\nher maternal way. "You must wear your hair just so on Thursday; and now\r\ntell me all about it--there\'s a dear."\r\n\r\n"Lucilla, _you know_" said Rose, drying her tears, "she has taken to\r\ngoing out in the evening, and I am sure she meets him every night. I\r\ncan\'t be a spy on her, whatever she does, and I can\'t lock her up, you\r\nknow, or lock the door, or anything like that. I am not her mother,"\r\nsaid the poor little sister pathetically, with a regretful sob. "And\r\nthen she has taken to making herself _nice_ before she goes out. I don\'t\r\nthink she ever cared much for being nice--not at home, you know; but now\r\nshe has pretty collars and gloves and things, and I can\'t tell where she\r\ngets them," cried Rose, her eyes lighting up passionately. "She has no\r\nmoney to spend on such things. Lucilla, I should die if I thought she\r\nwould accept them from _him_."\r\n\r\n"You dear old Rose, you don\'t know what you are saying," said the\r\nexperienced Lucilla; "most likely, if she meets a gentleman, she is\r\nengaged to him; and They always give people presents, you know. If you\r\nwould only tell me who it is."\r\n\r\n"Lucilla, do not trifle with me," said Rose; "it is much too serious for\r\nthat--engaged without papa knowing of it, nor me! You know very well\r\nthat would be no engagement. I sometimes think she is--is--fond of him,"\r\nsaid the reverent little maiden, whose voice changed and softened under\r\nthe influence of that supposition; "and then again I think it is only\r\nbecause he is rich," she went on, with new vehemence. "Oh, Lucilla, if\r\nyou only knew how dreadful it was to have such thoughts--and there is\r\nnobody to take care of her but me! Papa cannot be worried, for that\r\nwould react upon everything. An artist is not just like other people. It\r\nis everybody\'s duty to leave him undisturbed; and then, you know, he is\r\nonly a man, and does not understand; and if she won\'t pay any attention\r\nto me when I speak to her, oh, Lucilla, tell me, what can I do?"\r\n\r\n"Let me think," said Lucilla gravely. "You know I can\'t tell all in a\r\nmoment. It is Mr Cavendish, I suppose, though you won\'t say so. Now just\r\nwait a moment, and let me think."\r\n\r\n"I once thought of going to him," said Rose; "perhaps he might be\r\ngenerous, and go away. An artist can do many things that other people\r\ncan\'t do. We have an exceptional position," the Preraphaelist went on,\r\nfaltering a little, and not feeling quite so sure of the fact on that\r\nspecial occasion. "I thought of going and begging of him, if it was on\r\nmy knees----"\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Lucilla, with great seriousness, "if you did, I think it\r\nis most likely he would fall in love with _you_, and that would not mend\r\nthe matter; and I am sure Barbara would give you poison. I will tell you\r\nwhat we must do. I would not do it for everybody; but you know I was\r\nalways very fond of you, you dear little Rose. You shall ask me for\r\nto-morrow evening to come to tea."\r\n\r\n"To come to tea!" echoed poor Rose, in dismay. She had been waiting for\r\nLucilla\'s advice with a great deal of anxiety; but at the present moment\r\nit would be vain to conceal that the proposed expedient seemed to her\r\naltogether inadequate for the emergency. The light went out of her face\r\nas she opened her eyes wide and fixed them on Lucilla; and for one\r\nmoment, one desperate moment, Rose was disloyal, and lost faith in the\r\nonly person who could help her; which, perhaps, under the circumstances,\r\nwas not a thing to cause much surprise.\r\n\r\n"My dear, you may be sure I would not propose it, if I did not feel it\r\nwas the best thing to do," said Lucilla, with great gravity. "It happens\r\nprecisely that I want to see Mr Cavendish, and if he is at home he never\r\nshows himself, and I have been wondering how I could find him. I shall\r\nmake him walk home with me," said Miss Marjoribanks, "so you need not be\r\nuneasy, Rose, about the trouble I am taking. I am doing it to serve\r\nmyself as well as you. We shall say eight o\'clock, if that is not too\r\nlate."\r\n\r\n"But, Lucilla----" said Rose, with consternation; and then she stopped\r\nshort, and could not tell what more to say.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t understand it?" said Miss Marjoribanks; "I don\'t think it was\r\nto be expected that you should understand it. A little thing like you\r\nhas no way of knowing the world. When Barbara knows I am there, she will\r\nbe sure to bring him to the very door; she will want me to see that he\r\nis with her; and you may leave the rest to me," said Lucilla. "For my\r\npart, I have something very particular to say to Mr Cavendish. It is my\r\nluck," Miss Marjoribanks added, "for I could not think how to get to see\r\nhim. At eight o\'clock to-morrow evening----"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Rose; but perhaps it was still doubtful how far she\r\nunderstood the mode of operations proposed. Lucilla\'s prompt and facile\r\ngenius was too much for the young artist, and there was, as she herself\r\nwould have said, an entire want of "keeping" between her own sense of\r\nthe position, tragical and desperate as that was, and any state of\r\nmatters which could be ameliorated by the fact of Miss Marjoribanks\r\ncoming to tea. It had been Rose\'s only hope, and now it seemed all at\r\nonce to fail her; and yet, at the same time, that instinctive faith in\r\nLucilla which came naturally to every one under her influence struggled\r\nagainst reason in Rose\'s heart. Her red soft lips fell apart with the\r\nhurried breath of wonder and doubt; her eyes still expanded, and clearer\r\nthan usual after their tears, were fixed upon Lucilla with an appealing,\r\nquestioning look; and it was just at this moment, when Rose was a great\r\ndeal too much absorbed in her disappointment and surprise, and lingering\r\nhope, to take any notice of strange sounds or sights, or of anybody\r\ncoming, that Thomas all at once opened the door and showed Mrs Centum\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\nNow it would have mattered very little for Mrs Centum--who, to be sure,\r\nknew Lucilla perfectly well, and would never have dreamed for a moment\r\nof identifying such a trifling little person as Rose Lake in any way\r\nwith Miss Marjoribanks; but then Mrs Centum happened at that precise\r\nmoment to be bringing the new arrival, the important stranger, who had\r\nso much in his power--General Travers himself--to be introduced to\r\nLucilla; and it was not the fault either of Rose or the General if it\r\nwas on the young mistress of the Female School of Design that the\r\nwarrior\'s first glance fell. Naturally the conversation had run upon\r\nMiss Marjoribanks on the past evening, for Mrs Centum was full of the\r\nenthusiasm and excitement incident to that _pat\xe9_ which Lucilla had so\r\nmagnanimously enabled her to produce. "Is she pretty?" General Travers\r\nhad demanded, as was to be expected. "We--ll," Mrs Centum had replied,\r\nand made a long pause--"would you call Lucilla pretty, Charles?" and\r\nCharles had been equally dubious in his response; for, to be sure, it\r\nwas a dereliction from Miss Marjoribanks\'s dignity to call her pretty,\r\nwhich is a trifling sort of qualification. But when the General entered\r\nthe drawing-room, which might be called the centre of Carlingford, and\r\nsaw before him that little dewy face, full of clouds and sunshine,\r\nuncertain, unquiet, open-eyed, with the red lips apart, and the eyes\r\nclear and expanded with recent tears--a face which gave a certain\r\nsentiment of freshness and fragrance to the atmosphere like the quiet\r\nafter a storm--he did not understand what his hosts could mean. "I call\r\nher very pretty," he said, under his breath, to his interested and\r\ndelighted chaperone; and we are surely justified in appealing to the\r\nreaders of this history, as Lucilla, who was always reasonable,\r\nafterwards did to herself, whether it could be justly said under all the\r\ncircumstances, that either Rose or the General were to blame?\r\n\r\nThe little artist got up hurriedly when she awoke to the fact that other\r\nvisitors had come into the room, but she was not at all interested in\r\nGeneral Travers, whom Rose, with the unconscious insolence of youth,\r\nclassified in her own mind as an elderly gentleman. Not that he was at\r\nall an elderly gentleman; but then a man of forty, especially when he is\r\na fine man and adequately developed for his years, has at the first\r\nglance no great attraction for an impertinent of seventeen. Rose did\r\nnot go away without receiving another kiss from Lucilla, and a parting\r\nreminder. "To-morrow at eight o\'clock; and mind you leave it all to me,\r\nand don\'t worry," said Miss Marjoribanks; and Rose, half ashamed, put on\r\nher hat and went away, without so much as remarking the admiration in\r\nthe stranger\'s eyes, nor the look of disappointment with which he saw\r\nher leave the room. Rose thought no more of him than if he had been a\r\npiece of furniture; but as for the General, when he found himself\r\nobliged to turn to Lucilla and make himself agreeable, the drawback of\r\nhaving thus had his admiration forestalled and drawn away from its\r\nlegitimate object was such, that he did not find her at all pretty;\r\nwhich, after all, on a first interview at least, is all They think\r\nabout, as Miss Marjoribanks herself said.\r\n\r\n"We must do all we can to make Carlingford agreeable to the General,"\r\nsaid Mrs Centum. "You know how much depends upon it, Lucilla. If we can\r\nbut make him like the place, only think what an advantage to\r\nsociety--and we have such nice society in Carlingford," said the\r\ninjudicious woman, who did not know what to say.\r\n\r\n"Nothing very particular," said Miss Marjoribanks. "I hope General\r\nTravers will like us; but as for the officers, I am not so sure. They\r\nare all so light and airy, you know: and to have nothing but flirting\r\nmen is almost as bad as having nobody that can flirt; which is my\r\nposition," Lucilla added, with a sigh, "as long as Mr Cavendish is\r\naway."\r\n\r\n"Lucilla," cried Mrs Centum, a little shocked, "one would think to hear\r\nyou that you were the greatest coquette possible; and on the contrary\r\nshe is quite an example to all our young ladies, I assure you, General;\r\nand as for flirting----"\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Centum," said Lucilla sweetly, "one has always to do one\'s\r\nduty to society. As far as I am concerned, it is quite different. And I\r\ndon\'t mean to say that the officers would not be a great acquisition,"\r\nMiss Marjoribanks continued, with her usual politeness; "but then too\r\nmany young people are the ruin of society. If we were to run all to\r\ndancing and that sort of thing, after all the trouble one has taken----"\r\nsaid Lucilla. Perhaps it was not quite civil; but then it must be\r\nadmitted, that to see a man look blankly in your face as if he were\r\nsaying in his mind, "Then it is only _you_, and not that pretty little\r\nthing, that is Miss Marjoribanks!" was about as exasperating a sensation\r\nas one is likely to meet with. Lucilla understood perfectly well\r\nGeneral Travers\'s look, and for the moment, instead of making herself\r\nagreeable, it was the contrary impulse that moved her. She looked at\r\nhim, not blankly as he looked at her, but in a calmly considerate way,\r\nas she might have looked at Mr Holden the upholsterer, had he proposed a\r\nnew kind of _tapisserie_ to her judgment. "One would be always\r\ndelighted, of course, to have General Travers," said Miss Marjoribanks,\r\n"but I am afraid the officers would not do."\r\n\r\nAs for Mrs Centum, she was quite incapable of managing such a terrible\r\ncrisis. She felt it, indeed, a little hard that it should be her man who\r\nwas defied in this alarming way, while Mr Cavendish and the Archdeacon,\r\nthe two previous candidates, had both been received so sweetly. To be\r\nsure, it was his own fault; but that did not mend matters. She looked\r\nfrom one to the other with a scared look, and grew very red, and untied\r\nher bonnet; and then, as none of these evidences of agitation had any\r\neffect upon the other parties involved, plunged into the heat of the\r\nconflict without considering what she was about to say.\r\n\r\n"Lucilla, I am surprised at you," said Mrs Centum, "when you know how\r\nyou have gone on about Mr Cavendish--when you know what a fuss you have\r\nmade, and how you have told everybody----"\r\n\r\n"By the bye, who is Mr Cavendish?" said General Travers, interposing,\r\nwith that holy horror of a quarrel between women which is common to the\r\ninferior half of creation. "I wonder if he is a fellow one used to meet\r\neverywhere. One never could get any satisfaction who he belonged to. He\r\nnever pretended to be one of the Devonshire Cavendishes, you know. I\r\ndon\'t know if he had any family at all, or relations, or that sort of\r\nthing. In most cases a man gets on just as well without them, in my\r\nopinion. I wonder if this fellow you are talking of is he?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Mrs Centum. "I hope you will meet him before you leave\r\nCarlingford. He has a sister married here; but we have always understood\r\nhe was one of the Cavendishes. I am sure Mrs Woodburn always gives\r\nherself out for somebody," she continued, beginning to let the\r\ninteresting suspicion enter her mind; for, to be sure, they were about\r\nof a standing, and the banker\'s wife had sometimes felt a little sore at\r\nthe idea that her neighbour possessed distinctions of family which were\r\ndenied to herself. "It is true, none of her relations ever come to see\r\nher," said Mrs Centum, and she began to forget the General, and\r\nLucilla\'s reception of him, in this still more interesting subject. It\r\nwas the first time that the authenticity of the Cavendishes had been\r\nattacked in Carlingford; and, to be sure, what is the good of having\r\nfine connections if they cannot be produced? While Mrs Centum pondered a\r\nsuggestion so interesting, Lucilla, on her part, also took advantage of\r\nthe occasion, and descended from the calm heights of dignity on which\r\nshe had placed herself. And the General, who was a well-bred man, had\r\ngot over for the moment the unlucky impression made upon him by the\r\nfresh face of little Rose Lake.\r\n\r\n"Mr Cavendish is very nice," said Miss Marjoribanks. "I am very fond of\r\nall my own relations, but I don\'t care about other people\'s. Of course\r\nhe is one of the Cavendishes. I don\'t see how he can help it, when that\r\nis his name. I should think it was sure to be the same. We should be so\r\nobliged to you if you would bring him back to Carlingford. I don\'t know,\r\nI am sure, why he is so obstinate in staying away."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps somebody has been unkind to him," said the General, feeling it\r\nwas expected of him.\r\n\r\n"I am sure _I_ have not been unkind to him," said Lucilla. "He is such a\r\nloss to me. If you are going to do us the pleasure of coming on\r\nThursday--Oh, I am sure we shall feel quite honoured, both papa and I--I\r\nwill show you how badly off I am. It is not a party in the least, and we\r\ndon\'t dance," said Miss Marjoribanks, "that is why I am a little\r\nuncertain about the officers. It is one of my principles that too many\r\nyoung people are the ruin of society; but it is hard work, sometimes,\r\nwhen one is not properly supported," Lucilla added, with a gentle sigh.\r\n\r\n"If I can be of any use," said the amused soldier. "I don\'t pretend to\r\nbe able to replace Cavendish, if it is Cavendish; but----"\r\n\r\n"No," said Miss Marjoribanks, with resignation, "it is not easy to\r\nreplace him. He has quite a talent, you know; but I am sure it is very\r\nkind of you, and we shall be delighted to have such an acquisition,"\r\nLucilla continued, after a pause, with a gracious smile; and then she\r\nled her guests downstairs to luncheon, which was every way satisfactory.\r\nAs for the General, it cannot be doubted that he had the worst of it in\r\nthis little encounter, and felt himself by no means such a great\r\npersonage in Carlingford as his hospitable entertainers had persuaded\r\nhim he should be. Mrs Centum declared afterwards that she could not\r\nform the least idea what Lucilla meant by it, she who was generally so\r\ncivil to everybody. But it is not necessary to say that Miss\r\nMarjoribanks knew perfectly well what she was doing, and felt it\r\nimperatively necessary to bring down General Travers to his proper\r\nlevel. Carlingford could exist perfectly well without him and his\r\nofficers; but Lucilla did not mean that the society she had taken so\r\nmuch pains to form should be condescended to by a mere soldier. And\r\nthen, after all, she was only human, and it was not to be expected she\r\ncould pass over the blank look with which her visitor turned to herself,\r\nafter having by evil fortune cast his eyes upon Rose Lake. At the same\r\ntime, Miss Marjoribanks, always magnanimous, did not blame Rose, who had\r\nno hand whatever in the matter; and if she avenged herself in a ladylike\r\nand satisfactory manner, it is not to be supposed that it was simply a\r\nsense of offence which actuated Lucilla. She did it, on the contrary, on\r\nstrictly philosophical principles, having perceived that Mrs Centum was\r\nspoiling her General, and that it was absolutely necessary that he\r\nshould be disabused.\r\n\r\nWhen they left, Mrs Centum was almost afraid to put the question that\r\ntrembled on her lips. She uttered it at last, faltering, and with a very\r\ndoubtful expression, for she could not conceal from herself the fact\r\nthat the General had been snubbed. "How do you like Lucilla?" she said,\r\nin the most humble way; and then she turned away her face. She could\r\nbear it, whatever it might be. She said to herself that so long as the\r\nchildren were well, and the holidays about over, she could bear\r\nanything; and what did it matter to her about the officers?--but at the\r\nsame time she preferred to avert her face when she received the blow.\r\n\r\n"I am sure Miss Marjoribanks is a person for whom I shall always\r\nentertain the highest respect," said the General, and he gave a little\r\nlaugh. "Was that pretty little creature a sister of hers?--or a\r\nfriend?--or what? I don\'t know when I have seen anything so pretty,"\r\nsaid the unsuspecting man; and then Mrs Centum turned round upon him\r\nwith a kind of horror.\r\n\r\n"_That_ Lucilla\'s sister!--why, she has no sister; I told you so; she is\r\nan only child, and will have everything. She will be quite an heiress,"\r\ncried Mrs Centum, "if the old Doctor were to die; though, I am sure,\r\npoor dear man, I hope he will not die. There is no other medical man in\r\nthe town that one can have the least confidence in, except Dr Rider;\r\nand then _he_ is so young, and can\'t have much experience with children.\r\nHer sister, indeed! It was little Rose Lake, the drawing-master\'s\r\ndaughter," said Mrs Centum, with cruel distinctness. The General only\r\nsaid, "Oh!" but it was in a crestfallen tone; for to be snubbed by one\r\nlady, and struck with sudden enthusiasm for another, who, after all, was\r\nnot a lady to speak of, but only a drawing-master\'s daughter, was rather\r\nhard upon the poor man. Thus it was the soldier, who in ordinary\r\ncircumstances ought to have been the most successful, who began in the\r\nmost cruel and uncomfortable way his campaign in Carlingford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXVII_\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, except for her habitual walk, did not go out much\r\nthat day. She was too much occupied with what she had in hand. She could\r\nnot conceive--for Lucilla naturally took a reasonable view of affairs in\r\ngeneral, and did not account for the action of any such unknown quantity\r\nas love, for example--why Mr Cavendish should conceal himself so\r\ncarefully from society in Carlingford, and yet run all the risk of\r\nmeeting Barbara Lake in the evenings. It seemed to Lucilla\r\ninconceivable, and yet it was impossible not to believe it. Mr\r\nCavendish, though she had seen him on the very verge of a proposal, did\r\nnot present himself to her mind in the aspect of a man who would\r\nconsider the world well lost for any such transitory passion; neither,\r\nas was natural, did Barbara Lake appear to Lucilla the least like a\r\nperson calculated to call forth that sentiment; but nevertheless it must\r\nbe true, and the only way to account for it was by thinking, after all,\r\nwhat fools _They_ were, and what poor judges, and how little to be\r\ndepended on, when women were concerned. Miss Marjoribanks was determined\r\nto lose no more time, but to speak to Mr Cavendish, if it was Mr\r\nCavendish, and she could get the chance, quite plainly of the situation\r\nof affairs--to let him know how much she knew, and to spur him up to\r\ncome forward like a man and brave anything the Archdeacon could do. Had\r\nit been any small personal aim that moved Lucilla, no doubt she would\r\nhave shrunk from such a decided step; but it was, on the contrary, the\r\nbroadest philanthropical combination of Christian principles, help to\r\nthe weak and succour to the oppressed, and a little, just a very little,\r\nof the equally Evangelical idea of humbling the proud and bringing down\r\nthe mighty. She was so much occupied with her plans that it was with a\r\nlittle difficulty she roused herself to keep up the conversation with\r\nher father at dinner, and be as amusing and agreeable as ordinary; which\r\nindeed was more than ordinarily her duty, since Dr Marjoribanks came in,\r\nin a fractious and disturbed state of mind, discontented with things in\r\ngeneral. The truth was, he had got a letter from Tom Marjoribanks from\r\nIndia, where that unlucky man had gone. It was all very well and natural\r\nto go to India, and Lucilla had felt, indeed, rather satisfied with\r\nherself for having helped forward that desirable conclusion, especially\r\nafter the Doctor had taken pains to explain to her, not knowing that she\r\nhad any share in it, that it was the very best thing for Tom to do. For\r\nit has been already said that Dr Marjoribanks, though he liked Tom, and\r\nthought it very odd that Providence should have given the girl to him,\r\nand the boy to his incapable sister-in-law, who did not in the least\r\nknow how to manage him, had no desire to have his nephew for a\r\nson-in-law. Going to India was very right and proper, and the best thing\r\nto do; for a man might get on _there_, even at the bar, who would have\r\nno chance _here_; but after he had made one step in the right direction,\r\nit was only to be expected that all sorts of misfortunes should happen\r\nto Tom. He was wrecked, which might have been looked for, and he lost\r\nhis boxes, with the greater part of his outfit, either at that unhappy\r\nmoment, or in the Desert, or at an after part of his unlucky career; and\r\nthe object of the letter which Dr Marjoribanks had just received was to\r\nget money to make up for his losses. Tom, who was a very good son, did\r\nnot want to vex his mother, and accordingly it was his uncle whom he\r\napplied to, to sell out a portion of the money he had in the Funds. "She\r\nwould think I was ruined, or that it was my fault, or at least that I\r\nmeant to spend all my money," wrote Tom, "and you understand, uncle,\r\nthat it is not my fault." "Confound him! it is never his fault," said Dr\r\nMarjoribanks, as if that could possibly be brought against the\r\nunfortunate young man as a crime.\r\n\r\n"No, papa, it is his luck," said Lucilla; "poor Tom!--but I should not\r\nlike to take a passage in the same boat with him if I was the other\r\npeople. Though I am sure he is not a bit to blame."\r\n\r\n"I hope he does not mean to go on like this," said the Doctor. "He will\r\nsoon make ducks and drakes of his five thousand pounds. A young fellow\r\nlike that ought to mind what he\'s doing. It is a great deal easier to\r\nthrow money away than to lay it by."\r\n\r\n"Papa, it is his luck," said Miss Marjoribanks; "it is all put into a\r\nsystem in political economy, you know. For my part, I am always the\r\nother way. It is very funny before you get used to it; but you know\r\nthere has to be a balance in everything, and that is how it must be."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it at all funny," said Dr Marjoribanks, "unless your good\r\nluck and his bad were to be joined together; which is not an expedient I\r\nfancy." When he said this the Doctor gave a sharp glance at his\r\ndaughter, to see if by chance that might perhaps be what she was\r\nthinking of; but naturally the maiden candour and unsuspecting innocence\r\nof Lucilla was proof to such glances. She took no notice at all of the\r\nimplied suspicion. But though it was very absurd for anybody to think\r\nthat she would have married him, it was not in Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\nnature to be disloyal to Tom.\r\n\r\n"I think he is quite right about his mother, papa," said Lucilla; "she\r\nwould never understand it, you know; she would think the world was\r\ncoming to an end. I would not for anything take a passage in the same\r\nboat with him, but he is nice in his way, poor fellow! I wonder what he\r\nhas ever done to have such dreadful luck--but I hope you are going to do\r\nwhat he asks you:" and with this calm expression of her interest Miss\r\nMarjoribanks went upstairs. When the Doctor became thus aware of his\r\ndaughter\'s sentiments, it seemed to him that he was more at liberty to\r\nbe kind to his nephew. He had never been able to divest himself of a\r\nlittle lurking dread, an inherent idea which was so obstinate that it\r\nfelt like a prophecy, that somehow or other, after costing her father so\r\nmuch, and making such a difference in the house, Lucilla, who on the\r\nwhole was a dear production, would fall to Tom\'s share, with all Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s other possessions; and the Doctor saw no reason why he\r\nshould work and lay up money for a boy whom Providence, with a wonderful\r\nwant of discrimination, had bestowed, not upon him, but upon Mrs John\r\nMarjoribanks. However, when that question was settled and done with, his\r\nheart began to relent to Tom the unlucky, who, after all, when the\r\nson-in-law hypothesis was fully dismissed, was his natural born nephew,\r\nand, as Lucilla said, very nice in his way, poor fellow! The Doctor\r\nbegan to write him a letter, and softened more and more with every line\r\nhe wrote; but as for Lucilla, she had something more immediately\r\nimportant to occupy her upstairs.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Miss Marjoribanks had found a shadowy figure in black\r\nin the corner of one of the sofas when she came into the\r\ndrawing-room--a-figure with a veil down, and a large shawl, and a\r\ntremulous air. It was very seldom that Mrs Mortimer took courage to\r\nvisit her young patroness; and to go out at night, except sometimes to\r\nSalem Chapel when there was a meeting, and when the timid woman\r\nrepresented to herself that it was her duty, was a thing unknown to her.\r\nBut yet, nevertheless, it was Mrs Mortimer who sat waiting for Lucilla.\r\nThey had not met since that momentous interview in which the widow\r\nrevealed her history to Miss Marjoribanks\'s sympathetic ears, and the\r\npoor woman had been able to bear no longer the solitude of her cottage,\r\nand her garden-walls, and her little pupils, and Mary Jane. To know that\r\nsomething was going on outside that concerned her--to hear the waves, as\r\nit were, beating round the walls of her prison, and never to have even\r\nso much as a peep at them, what they were about, if the tide was\r\nbeginning to turn, or the wind to change, or the lifeboat to appear--was\r\nmore than Mrs Mortimer, even with all her training to patience, could\r\nput up with; and accordingly she had made a frantic rush out, under\r\ncover of night, to see if there was anything to see, and hear if there\r\nwas anything to hear.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know how dreadful it is to keep staring at the walls all day\r\nand never see any change," said the widow. "It is very stupid and silly,\r\nbut you know I cannot help it. I get to fancy always that something\r\nwonderful must be going on on the other side."\r\n\r\n"That is because you don\'t go out enough," said Lucilla. "You know how\r\noften I have said you should go out once every day; and then you would\r\nsee that everything outside was very much the same as everything\r\nwithin."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lucilla! don\'t say so," said Mrs Mortimer; "and besides, _he_ has\r\nbeen again, and I could see you had been saying something to him. He\r\nspoke as if I understood it all when I did not understand a word of it;\r\nand he spoke of him, you know, and was quite solemn, and warned me to\r\nthink well of it, and not do anything rash--as if I had anything to\r\nthink about, or was going to do anything! Tell me what you said to him,\r\nLucilla; for I am sure, by the way he spoke, he must have taken him for\r\nhimself, and perhaps you for me."\r\n\r\n"Who did he take for himself, I wonder?" said Lucilla. "As for you and\r\nme, dear Mrs Mortimer, we are so different that he could never take us\r\nfor each other, whatever the circumstances might be."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, Lucilla! we are different," said the poor widow. "You have all\r\nyour own people to take care of you, and you are not afraid of anybody;\r\nbut as for me, I have not a creature in the world who cares what becomes\r\nof me." As she made this forlorn statement it was only natural that the\r\npoor woman should cry a little. This was no doubt the result of the four\r\ngarden-walls that closed in so tightly, and the aggravating little\r\npupils; but Miss Marjoribanks felt it was not a state of feeling that\r\ncould be allowed to go on.\r\n\r\n"You ought not to speak like that; I am sure there are a great many\r\npeople who are interested in you; and you have always Me," said Lucilla,\r\nwith a certain reproachful tenderness. As for Mrs Mortimer, she raised\r\nher head and dried her eyes when Miss Marjoribanks began to speak, and\r\nlooked at her in a somewhat eager, inquiring way; but when Lucilla\r\nuttered those last reassuring words, it is undeniable that the widow\'s\r\ncountenance fell a little. She faltered and grew pale again, and only\r\ncried the more--perhaps with gratitude, perhaps with disappointment. And\r\nwhen she said, "I am sure you are very kind, Lucilla," which was all the\r\npoor soul could utter, it was in a very tremulous undecided voice. The\r\nfact that she had always the sympathy and co-operation of such a friend\r\nas Miss Marjoribanks, did not seem to have the exhilarating effect upon\r\nher that it ought to have had. It did not apparently do any more for her\r\nthan the similar reassurance that Lucilla was coming to tea did for Rose\r\nLake. But then, like every other benefactor of the human race, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was aware that the human mind has its moments of unbelief.\r\nIt was a discouraging experience to meet with; but she never permitted\r\nit seriously to interrupt her exertions for the good of her kind.\r\n\r\n"You should not have so poor an opinion of your friends," said Lucilla,\r\nwho after all was giving only a stone when her suppliant asked for\r\nbread. "You know how much interested we all are in you; and for me,\r\nanything I can do----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lucilla, you are very kind; nobody could be kinder," cried Mrs\r\nMortimer, with compunction. "It is very nice to have friends. I do not\r\nknow what I should do without you, I am sure; but then one cannot live\r\nupon one\'s friends; and then one knows, when they go away," said the\r\nwidow, with more feeling than distinctness of expression, "that they all\r\ngo away to something of their own, and pity you or forget you; but you\r\nalways stay there, and have nothing of your own to go away to. I am not\r\ngrumbling, but it is hard, Lucilla; and then you are young, and happy,\r\nand at home, and I don\'t think it is possible you can understand."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Miss Marjoribanks, "it is quite easy to understand, and\r\nI know exactly what you mean. You want me to tell you all about Mr\r\nBeverley, and what I said to him, and what he has in his mind. If he is\r\nthe something of your own you would like to go away to, I think it is a\r\npity. I am sure he has a temper, and _I_ would not marry him for my\r\npart. But if you mean _me_, I have nothing to go away to," said Lucilla,\r\nwith a little scorn. "I should be ashamed not to be enough for myself.\r\nWhen I leave you it is not to enjoy myself, but to think about you and\r\nto plan for you; and all that you want to know is about _him_!" said\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, piercing through and through the thin armour of her\r\nincapable assailant. Naturally all the widow\'s defences fell before this\r\nruthless response. She cried with a mingled sensation of shame at being\r\nfound out, and penitence for being so ungrateful, and a certain desolate\r\ndistress with her own incapacity and want of power to defend herself. It\r\nwas an acute variety of feminine anguish on the whole. The idea that\r\nshe, a mature woman, a married woman and widow, who ought to have been\r\ndone with all these vanities, should have been found out by a young girl\r\nto be thinking about _a gentleman_, struck poor Mrs Mortimer with a\r\nsharp sense of shame as if her wistful preoccupation had been a crime.\r\nIndeed the chances are, if it had been a crime, she would not have been\r\nnearly so much ashamed of it. She hid her face in her hands and blushed\r\ndown to the very edge of her black dress and up into the glooms of her\r\nwidow\'s veil; and all the self-defence she was capable of was a faint\r\n"Oh, Lucilla!" a mere appeal of weakness without reason--a virtual\r\nthrowing of herself in acknowledged guilt at her judge\'s feet.\r\n\r\n"Thomas is coming with the tea," said Miss Marjoribanks. "Come into my\r\nroom and take off your bonnet. What is the good of worrying yourself\r\nwhen you know I have taken it into my own hands? Spoiling your eyes with\r\ncrying, and making everybody uncomfortable never does the least good;\r\nand, besides, one never knows what harm one might do one\'s self," said\r\nLucilla seriously. "I don\'t think you gone off at all, for my part; but\r\nif you don\'t take proper care----I shall give you some rose-water, and\r\nyou will be all right after you have had a cup of tea."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; it will be best to go home. I am such a poor creature now. I am\r\nnot good for anything. Let me go home, Lucilla," said poor Mrs Mortimer.\r\nBut Lucilla would not let her go home; and by the time tea was ready,\r\nand Dr Marjoribanks had come upstairs, she had so managed to soothe her\r\nvisitor\'s nerves, and console her spirits, that the Doctor himself grew\r\ncomplimentary. He was so civil, in fact, that Lucilla felt slightly\r\nstartled, and on the whole thought it was as well that the Archdeacon\r\nwas at hand, and affairs in a promising way; for it was doubtful whether\r\neven Miss Marjoribanks\'s magnanimity could have got over any ridiculous\r\nexhibition of interest on the part of her father, who certainly was old\r\nenough to know better. Even to see him taking Mrs Mortimer\'s tea to her,\r\nand congratulating her upon her improved looks, and felicitating himself\r\nand the world in general on the fact that Carlingford agreed with her,\r\nwas aggravating to his daughter--more aggravating, though it is strange\r\nto say so, than even the blank looks of General Travers in the morning,\r\nor his transference of the homage intended for herself to little Rose\r\nLake; _that_ was no more than a blunder, and Lucilla felt a consolatory\r\nconviction that, so far as incivility went, the General had received a\r\nvery satisfactory set-off. But to see Dr Marjoribanks exerting himself\r\nin such an unheard-of way made her open her eyes. If he were still\r\naccessible to such influences, nobody could answer for anything that\r\nmight happen; and the widow was so grateful for his kindness, that at\r\none moment it was all that Lucilla could do to keep her lips shut fast,\r\nand restrain herself from a tempting allusion which would have made an\r\nend of Mrs Mortimer. It was the first time that Lucilla\'s prot\xe9g\xe9e had\r\nventured to come thus familiarly and uninvited to her friend\'s house;\r\nand the Doctor, who knew no special reason for the visit, expressed his\r\nsatisfaction with a warmth which was quite uncalled-for, and hoped that\r\nLucilla might often "have the advantage of her company;" and actually\r\nbetrayed symptoms of a disposition to "see her home," if Miss\r\nMarjoribanks had not already made provision for that emergency. When the\r\nvisitor had finally departed, under the charge of Thomas and Mary Jane,\r\nthe father and daughter regarded each other, for the first time, with\r\ndubious glances--for, as far as Lucilla was concerned, it was a\r\nrevelation to her of a new and altogether unsuspected danger; and the\r\nDoctor, for his part, was very conciliatory, and showed a certain\r\nconsciousness of having committed himself, which made matters twenty\r\ntimes worse.\r\n\r\n"Really, Lucilla, your friend is a credit to you," said Dr Marjoribanks.\r\n"It was a stroke of talent to pick her up, as you did, and make a woman\r\nof her--and a pretty woman too," he added incautiously; as if he, at his\r\nage, had anything to do with that.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad you think so, papa," said Lucilla, in her dutiful way. "I\r\ndon\'t think myself that she has gone off at all to speak of. In some\r\nlights she might pass for being no older than I am--if she was very well\r\ndressed, you know; and it really does not matter what age a woman is if\r\nshe keeps her looks. I should be very glad to see her nicely married,\r\nfor my part; she is one of the people who ought to be married," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks continued, with an inflection of compassionate tolerance in\r\nher voice. As for the Doctor, he mistook her as usual, and took her tone\r\nof pity and kindly patronising disdain for another instance of his\r\ndaughter\'s policy and high art; whereas the truth was she was quite in\r\nearnest, and meant every word she said. And then Dr Marjoribanks\'s sense\r\nof humour was keener than that of Lucilla. After this the conversation\r\nflagged slightly, for Miss Marjoribanks had undeniably received a shock.\r\nIn the midst of her benevolent preoccupation and care for other people,\r\nit had suddenly dawned upon her that her own stronghold might be\r\nattacked, and the tables turned upon her in the twinkling of an eye.\r\nThere are days of discouragement in the most triumphant career and this\r\nwas one of those uncomfortable moments. Her faith in herself did not\r\nfail her for an instant; but the faith of her natural born subjects--the\r\ncreatures of her bounty--had visibly failed her. Neither Rose Lake nor\r\nMrs Mortimer had shown that confidence in Lucilla\'s genius which\r\nexperience and loyalty both called upon them to show. When Dr\r\nMarjoribanks had gone downstairs to resume the case which he was writing\r\nout for the _Lancet_, Lucilla passed through one of those moments of\r\nsublime despondency which now and then try the spirits of the\r\nbenefactors of their race. A few tears came to her eyes as she reflected\r\nupon this great problem. Without such trials genius would not fully know\r\nitself nor be justly aware of its own strength. For no temptation to\r\ngive up her disinterested exertions had any effect upon the mind of Miss\r\nMarjoribanks; and even her sense of pain at the unbelief of her\r\nfollowers was mingled with that pity for their weakness which involves\r\npardon. Even when they wounded her she was sorry for them. It was nature\r\nthat was in fault, and not the fallible human creatures who had it not\r\nin them to believe in the simple force of genius. When Lucilla had shed\r\nthese few tears over her subjects\' weakness and want of faith, she rose\r\nup again in new strength from the momentary downfall. It was, as we have\r\nsaid, a sublime moment. The idea of giving them up, and leaving their\r\naffairs to their own guidance, never for an instant penetrated into her\r\nheroic mind; but she was human, and naturally she felt the prick of\r\ningratitude. When the crisis was over she rose up calmly and lighted her\r\ncandle, and went to her room with a smile upon her magnanimous lips. As\r\nshe performed that simple action, Lucilla had lifted up the feeble\r\nwidow, and taken the family of Lakes, and Mr Cavendish, and even the\r\nburly Archdeacon himself, upon her shoulders. They might be ungrateful,\r\nor even unaware of all she was doing for them; but they had the supreme\r\nclaim of Need upon Strength; and Miss Marjoribanks, notwithstanding the\r\nwound they had given her, was loyal to that appeal, and to her own\r\nconsciousness of superior Power.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it would not be just to omit all mention of a\r\nconsolatory recollection which occurred to Lucilla in this moment of her\r\nweakness. At such a crisis the mind of genius may be supported by a\r\nmatter very trifling in itself. Even at the instant when the moisture\r\nsprang to her eyes, Miss Marjoribanks said to herself, "Poor Tom!" and\r\nfelt that the bitterness, to a certain extent, had evaporated out of her\r\ntears. He was a long way off, and Lucilla would have thought it madness\r\nindeed to connect herself in any way with the fortunes of her unlucky\r\ncousin; yet it gave her a certain support to think that, amid all the\r\nwant of faith she was encountering, Tom believed in her, heart and soul.\r\nIt was an insignificant matter, so far as any practical result was\r\nconcerned, if, indeed, anything can be called insignificant which gives\r\nstrength to a great mind in a moment of discouragement. She said "Poor\r\nTom!" and felt as if for the moment she had something to lean on, and\r\nwas comforted. We mention this fact rather as a contribution to the\r\nhistory of those phenomena of the human mind, which have as yet escaped\r\nthe metaphysician, than as an actual circumstance in the life of Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. She was a woman of genius, and he only a very simple,\r\nunlucky fellow; and yet a sensation of comfort came to Lucilla\'s heart\r\nwhen she said "Poor Tom!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXVIII_\r\n\r\n\r\nLucilla prepared her toilette the next evening, to take tea with the\r\nLakes, with greater care than she would have spent upon a party of much\r\ngreater pretensions. She was, to be sure, dressed as usual in the white\r\ndress, _high_, which she had brought into fashion in Carlingford; but\r\nthen that simple evening toilette required many adjuncts which were not\r\nnecessary on other occasions, seeing that this time she was going to\r\nwalk to her destination, and had in her mind the four distinct aims of\r\npleasing Rose, of dazzling Barbara, of imposing upon Mr Cavendish, and,\r\nfinally, of being, as always, in harmony with _herself_. She was as\r\npunctual to the hour and minute of her engagement as if she had been a\r\nqueen; and, indeed, it was with a demeanour as gracious that she entered\r\nthe little house in Grove Street, where, naturally, there had been also\r\nsundry preparations made for her visit. Mr Lake himself, who had\r\npostponed his usual walk, and was taking his tea an hour later than\r\nusual, received his young visitor with all the suavity natural to him;\r\nand as for Barbara, she did the honours with a certain suppressed\r\nexultation and air of triumph, which proved to Lucilla that her plan was\r\nindeed an inspiration of genius. As for Rose, it would be impossible to\r\ndescribe what were her sensations. Her faith still failed her at that\r\nmomentous hour. She was sceptical of Lucilla, and naturally of all the\r\nworld, and regarded everybody with jealous scrutiny and expectation and\r\ndistrust, as was natural to a young conspirator. She was profoundly\r\nexcited and curious to know what Miss Marjoribanks meant to do; and at\r\nthe same time she did not believe in Miss Marjoribanks, and was almost\r\ndisposed to betray and interfere with her, if such treachery had been\r\npossible. It was Rose Lucilla specially came to visit, and yet Rose was\r\nthe only one who was cool to her, and did not seem fully to appreciate\r\nher condescension; but then, happily, Miss Marjoribanks was magnanimous,\r\nand at the same time had a purpose to support her, which was much more\r\ncomprehensive and of larger application than anything that had entered\r\ninto the mind of Rose Lake.\r\n\r\n"I am proud to see you in my house, Miss Marjoribanks," said Mr Lake. "I\r\nhave always considered your excellent father one of my best friends. I\r\nam not able to give my children the same advantages, but I have always\r\nbrought them up not to have any false pride. We have no wealth; but we\r\nhave some things which cannot be purchased by wealth," said the\r\ndrawing-master, with mild grandeur; and he looked round upon the walls\r\nof his parlour, which were hung with his own drawings, and where one of\r\nWillie\'s held the place of honour. In all Carlingford there was no other\r\nhouse that enjoyed a similar distinction; and, consequently, it was with\r\na delicious sense of chivalrous deference yet equality that the\r\nexceptional man of Grove Street received the young sovereign of Grange\r\nLane.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad to come, Mr Lake," said Lucilla. "It is so nice to be\r\namong such old friends; and, besides that, you know there never was any\r\nvoice that suited mine like Barbara\'s; and that dear old Rose was always\r\nmy pet at Mount Pleasant. I should have come long ago if anybody had\r\never asked me," said Miss Marjoribanks. And as for Mr Lake, he was so\r\noverpowered by this implied reproach upon his hospitality that he\r\nscarcely knew how to reply.\r\n\r\n"My dear Miss Marjoribanks, if you have not been asked it has been from\r\nno want of--of goodwill," said Mr Lake anxiously. "I do not know what\r\nthe girls can have been thinking of. You see Rose\'s genius takes another\r\nline; and Barbara, naturally, has a great many things to think of; but\r\nin the future, I hope----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I shall come without being asked," said Lucilla. And when the\r\ntea came it was all she could do to keep herself quiet, and remember\r\nthat she was a visitor, and not take it out of the incapable hands of\r\nBarbara, who never gave her father the right amount of sugar in his tea.\r\nTo tell the truth, Barbara\'s thoughts were occupied by a very different\r\nsubject; and even Rose had but little attention to spare for her papa\'s\r\ncomforts at that special moment. But Lucilla\'s larger mind embraced\r\neverything. She sat with her very fingers itching to cut the\r\nbread-and-butter for him, and give him a cup of tea as he liked it; and\r\nasked herself, with indignation, what was the use of that great\r\ncreature, with her level eyebrows and her crimson bloom, who could not\r\ntake the trouble to remember that three lumps was what Mr Lake liked.\r\nMiss Marjoribanks had never taken tea with him before; but his second\r\ncup, had she dispensed it, would have been exactly to his taste--which\r\nwas a thing Barbara had not learned to make it in all these years. No\r\nwonder that a certain sense of contemptuous indignation arose for one\r\nmoment, even in the calm and impartial bosom of genius. Perhaps Rose\r\nwould not have done much better; but then Rose was good for something\r\nelse, which was always a set-off on the other side. Thus it will be seen\r\nthat Lucilla had a respect for use, even of a kind which in her own\r\nperson she did not much appreciate, as became a person of a truly\r\nenlightened mind; but a creature who was of no earthly good irritated\r\nher well-regulated spirit; for, to be sure, the possession of a fine\r\ncontralto (which is, at the same time, not fine enough to be made use of\r\nprofessionally) is not a matter of sufficient moment in this world to\r\nexcuse a young woman for not knowing how to give her father a\r\ncomfortable cup of tea.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly nine o\'clock before Mr Lake went out for his walk, and by\r\nthat time it was almost dark, and the lamp outside was lighted, which\r\nwas not far from the door. Lucilla had taken a seat near the window,\r\nwith the view of witnessing everything; and it cannot be denied that she\r\nfelt a little excited when Barbara went out of the room after her\r\nfather, leaving Rose alone with her guest. Miss Marjoribanks\'s heart\r\ngave a beat or two the more in the first minute, though before the next\r\nhad passed it had fallen into its usual measure. There were no candles\r\nas yet in the parlour, and Grove Street--or at least the bit of it\r\nwhich lay before the window, lighted by the lamp outside, and relieved\r\nagainst a little square of bluish-green sky which intervened between\r\nMiss Hemmings\'s house and that of old Mr Wrangle on the opposite\r\nside--was very clear to the interested spectator. There was nobody\r\nvisible but an organ-man, who was grinding a popular melody very\r\ndolorously out of his box, in what Rose would have called the middle\r\ndistance; and beyond, Miss Jane Hemmings looking out of the long\r\nstaircase window, and three little boys in different attitudes\r\nbelow,--that is, if one did not count a tall figure which, perhaps with\r\nthe view of listening to the music of the organ, was coming and going in\r\na limited circuit round the light of the lamp.\r\n\r\n"How convenient it is to have the lamp so near," said Lucilla. "Oh,\r\ndon\'t light any candles, please; it is so nice to sit in the dark. Where\r\nis Barbara, I wonder? Let us have some music, and put down that dreadful\r\norgan. I hope she has not gone out. And where are you, you sulky little\r\nRose?"\r\n\r\n"She has gone upstairs," said Rose, who began to feel all the enormity\r\nof her conduct in thus betraying her sister. "I hate sitting in the\r\ndark. I hate being a spy; come in from the window, Lucilla, now you are\r\nhere----"\r\n\r\n"My dear Rose," said Miss Marjoribanks, "I think you forget a little.\r\nFor my part I do not understand what being a spy means. Barbara knows\r\nvery well I am here. I should scorn to take an advantage of anybody, for\r\nmy part. If she does not bring him past the very window, and under my\r\neyes--Ah, yes, that is just what I thought," said Lucilla, with gentle\r\nsatisfaction. But by this time poor little Rose had roused herself into\r\nan innocent fury.\r\n\r\n"What is just as you thought?" said Rose, laying an impatient grasp on\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s arm. "Come in from the window, Lucilla, this\r\nmoment--this moment! Oh, me, to think it should be my doing! Oh,\r\nLucilla, don\'t be so mean and shabby and wretched. I tell you to come\r\nin--come in directly! If you do not shut the window, and come and sit\r\nhere in the corner, I will never, never speak to you again!"\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, as was natural, took no notice of this childish fury.\r\nShe was sitting just where she had been sitting all the evening, within\r\nsight of the street lamp and the organ-grinder, and Miss Jane Hemmings\r\nat the staircase window;--just where Barbara had placed her, and where\r\nthat young woman calculated on finding her, when she made a promenade of\r\ntriumph up the partially lighted street by the side of her clandestine\r\nsuitor. Perhaps Barbara had seen Miss Jane as well, and knew that public\r\nopinion was thus watching over her; but at all events she was not at all\r\nashamed of herself, or indignant at being spied upon. On the contrary,\r\nit was a kind of apotheosis for Barbara, only second to the grand and\r\ncrowning triumph which would be accomplished in Carlingford Church under\r\nthe shadow of that veil of real Brussels, which grew more and more real\r\nevery day. Thus neither the actors in the drama, nor the principal\r\nspectator, were in the smallest degree disturbed by horror or shame or\r\nsense of guilt, excepting always the fanciful little Rose, who suffered\r\nfor everybody; who could have wished that the earth would open and\r\nswallow up Barbara and her lover; who could have slaughtered Lucilla on\r\nthe spot, and given herself over to any kind of torture for her\r\ntreachery. Naturally nobody paid any sort of attention to Rose. Barbara,\r\nfor her part, took her admirer\'s arm in the twilight with a swelling of\r\nexultation, which the gaining of the very highest prize in the\r\ndepartment of ornamental art could scarcely have conveyed to the bosom\r\nof the little artist; and Lucilla put back her small assailant softly\r\nwith her hand, and smoothed down her ruffled plumes.\r\n\r\n"My dear, it is Miss Hemmings that is spying," said Lucilla; "and poor\r\nBarbara would be so disappointed if I were to go away from the window.\r\nHave patience just a little longer--there\'s a dear. It is all exactly as\r\nI thought."\r\n\r\nAnd then there followed a pause, which was a terrible pause for Rose.\r\nThe organ-grinder stopped his doleful ditty, and there was scarcely any\r\nsound to be heard in the street except the footsteps approaching and\r\nretiring, the measured tread of two people occupied with each other,\r\ngoing now more slowly, now more quickly, as the humour seized them, or\r\nas their conversation grew in interest; even the sound of their voices\r\ncame by times to the auditors--Barbara\'s with an occasional laugh or\r\ntone of triumph, and the other deeper, with which Rose had but little\r\nacquaintance, but which was perfectly known to Lucilla. All this time,\r\nwhile her companion sat panting in the dark corner, Miss Marjoribanks\r\nwas looking to the joints of her harness, and feeling the edge of her\r\nweapons. For, after all, it was no small enterprise upon which she was\r\ngoing forth. She was going to denounce the faithless knight to his face,\r\nand take him out of the hands of the enchantress; but then she herself\r\nmeant to take him in hand, and show him his true dangers, and vindicate\r\nhis honour. A more disinterested enterprise was never undertaken by any\r\nknight-errant. Yet, at the same time, Lucilla could not help\r\nentertaining a certain involuntary contempt for the man who had deserted\r\nher own standard to put himself under that of Barbara Lake, and who was\r\nbeing paraded up and down here without knowing it, to gratify the vanity\r\nof his new sovereign, and make an exhibition of his weakness. Lucilla\r\nwould have been more than mortal if she had not felt the difference\r\nbetween her own rule, which would have been all to his good, and the\r\npurely egotistical sway of Barbara; and even in her magnanimous mind, it\r\nwas impossible that pity itself should not be mingled with a certain\r\ndisdain.\r\n\r\nShe sat quite still for so long that Barbara grew intoxicated with her\r\ntriumph. "It is perhaps the last time," Lucilla said to herself, with a\r\nmovement of compassion; and the breadth of her human sympathy was such\r\nthat she waited till the very latest moment, and let the deluded young\r\nwoman have the full enjoyment of her imaginary victory. Then Miss\r\nMarjoribanks rose with a certain solemnity, and put on her hat, and gave\r\nan unappreciated kiss to Rose, who kept in her corner. "Good-night; I am\r\ngoing," said Lucilla. The words were simple enough, but yet they rang in\r\nRose\'s ears like the signal of a conspiracy. When the calm leader of the\r\nexpedition went forth, sensible of the importance of her mission, but\r\ntranquil as great minds always are in a moment of danger, Rose got up\r\ntoo and followed, trembling in every limb. She was capable of having\r\nthrown herself upon the spears in her own person in a sudden _\xe9lan_ of\r\nindignation and passion; but she was not capable of waiting till the\r\nright moment, and meeting her antagonists in reasonable combat. Miss\r\nMarjoribanks went out deliberately, without any unnecessary haste,\r\nsweeping into the dusky twilight with her virginal white draperies. It\r\nwas a very ordinary scene, and yet, even in the midst of her excitement,\r\nRose could not help observing involuntarily its pictorial qualities--if\r\nonly any painter could have transferred to his canvas the subdued\r\nmusical hum of surrounding life, the fragrance of the mignonette, and\r\nthe peaceful stillness of the summer night. The sky shone out\r\ngreen-blue, lambent and wistful, from the vacant space between Miss\r\nHemmings\'s and Mr Wrangle\'s, and there were the dusky twilight shadows\r\nbelow, and the yellow gleam of the lamp, and Barbara\'s exulting,\r\ntriumphant figure, and the white robes of the avenging angel. Rose could\r\nnot have observed all this if she had not been stilled into a kind of\r\nbreathless awe by the solemn character of the situation, which struck\r\nher as being somehow like one of Millais\'s pictures. As for the lovers,\r\nthey had just turned at the moment that Miss Marjoribanks came out, and\r\nconsequently met her straight in the face, as she stood suave and\r\nsmiling at the little garden door.\r\n\r\n"It _is_ Mr Cavendish," said Lucilla; "I am so glad; I have been hoping\r\nand trying to see you for ever so long; and as soon as ever I heard you\r\ntalking I felt sure it was your voice."\r\n\r\nThis was the greeting she addressed to Barbara Lake\'s lover. For his\r\npart he stood before her, growing red and growing pale, struck dumb by\r\nthe unlooked-for meeting, and with such a sense of being ashamed of\r\nhimself as never before had entered his mind, though, no doubt, he had\r\ndone worse actions in his day. Even Barbara had not calculated upon this\r\nopen encounter; and instead of giving him any assistance, as was a\r\nwoman\'s duty in such a case, she only tossed her head, and giggled with\r\nan embarrassment which was more pride than shame. As for Mr Cavendish,\r\nhe would have liked to disappear under the pavement, if it had been\r\npossible. For once he and Rose were agreed. If a gulf had opened before\r\nhim, he would have jumped into it without ever pausing to ask himself\r\nwhy. And yet all the time Miss Marjoribanks was looking as placid as if\r\nshe had been in her own drawing-room, and expecting his reply to her\r\nfriendly observations. When he realised that he ought to say something,\r\nMr Cavendish felt that he had as much need to wipe his forehead as ever\r\nthe Archdeacon had. He turned hot and cold, and felt his mind and his\r\ntongue frozen, and could not find a word to say. With a sudden horror he\r\nwoke up, like one of Comus\'s revellers, and found himself changed into\r\nthe likeness of the creature he consorted with. If he had found an ass\'s\r\nhead on his shoulders, he could not have felt more startled and\r\nhorrified than when he heard himself, in the imbecility of the moment,\r\ngiggle like Barbara, and answer to Lucilla\'s remark, "Oh! yes, it was my\r\nvoice."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry to separate you from Barbara," said Miss Marjoribanks;\r\n"but she is at home, you know, and I want so much to talk to you.\r\nBarbara, good-night; I want Mr Cavendish to walk home with me. Rose,\r\ndon\'t stand in the garden and catch cold; thank you, dear, for such a\r\npleasant evening," said Lucilla, pressing another kiss upon her little\r\nfriend\'s unwilling cheek. When she had done this, she put out her hand\r\nto Barbara, and passed her, sweeping her white garments through the\r\nnarrow gateway. She took Mr Cavendish\'s arm as if he had been a young\r\nbrother come to fetch her. "Let us go round by the chapel," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, "I have so much to say to you. Be sure to practise for\r\nThursday, Barbara, and bid your papa good-night for me." This was how\r\nshe carried off Mr Cavendish finally out of Barbara\'s very fingers, and\r\nunder her very eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen the two sisters were left standing together at the door, they could\r\ndo nothing but stare at each other in the extremity of their amazement.\r\nRose, for her part, remained but a moment, and then, feeling by far the\r\nguiltiest and most miserable of the whole party, ran upstairs to her own\r\nroom and cried as if her heart would break. Barbara, on the contrary,\r\nwho was past crying, stood still at the door, and watched Lucilla\'s\r\nwhite dress disappearing on the way to Grange Lane with indescribable\r\nemotions. A young woman cannot call the police, or appeal to the crier,\r\nwhen it is her lover whom she has lost: but to see him carried off by\r\nthe strong hand--to watch him gradually going away and disappearing from\r\nher eyes--to hear his steps withdrawing into the distance--was such a\r\ntrial as few are called upon to bear. She stood and looked after him,\r\nand could not believe her eyes. And then it was all so sudden--an affair\r\nof a moment. Barbara could not realise how the world had turned round,\r\nand this revolution had been effected;--one minute she had been leaning\r\non his arm triumphant, making a show and exhibition of him in the pride\r\nof her heart, though he did not know it; and the next was not she\r\nstanding here watching him with a blank countenance and a despairing\r\nheart, while Lucilla had pounced upon him and carried him off in her\r\ncruel grasp? The blow was so sudden, that Barbara stood speechless and\r\nmotionless till the two departing figures had vanished in the darkness.\r\nWould he come back again to-morrow, or was he gone for ever and ever?\r\nSuch were the thoughts of the forsaken maiden, as she stood paralysed\r\nunder this sudden change of fortune, at her father\'s door. If some cruel\r\nspectator had thrown into the fire that Brussels veil with which her\r\nimagination had so long played, and Barbara had stood heart-struck,\r\nwatching the filmy tissue dissolve into ashes before her eyes, her sense\r\nof sudden anguish could not have been more acute. Yet, after all,\r\nBarbara\'s pangs were nothing to those of Mr Cavendish, as he felt Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s light touch on his arm, and felt his doomed feet turn in\r\nspite of himself in the most dangerous direction, and became conscious\r\nthat he was being led beyond all possibility of resistance, back to\r\nGrange Lane and to his fate.\r\n\r\nTo be sure it was dark, which was one consolation; but it was not dark\r\nenough to conceal Lucilla\'s white dress, nor the well-known form and\r\nlineaments of the young monarch of Grange Lane, in whose company nobody\r\ncould pass unobserved. Mr Cavendish could have faced danger by sea and\r\nland with the average amount of courage; but the danger of the walk down\r\nthe little street, which afterwards led to St Roque\'s, and up the\r\nembowered stillness of Grange Lane, was more than he was equal to. He\r\ncould not be sure of making a single step by these garden-walls without\r\nmeeting somebody who knew him--somebody whose curiosity might ruin him\r\nin Carlingford; or even without the risk of encountering in the face of\r\nthat arch-enemy, who would not go away, and whose presence had banished\r\nhim from the place. It may be supposed that, under these terrible\r\ncircumstances, Mr Cavendish\'s thoughts of Barbara, who had got him into\r\nthis scrape, were far from lover-like. He was a man universally popular\r\namong ladies, and who owed a great deal of the social consideration\r\nwhich he prized so highly to this fact; and yet the most gentle\r\nsentiment in his mind at that moment, was a "Confound these women!"\r\nwhich he breathed to himself, all low and deep, as he went slowly along\r\nby Lucilla\'s side. As for Miss Marjoribanks, her thoughts were of a very\r\nmuch more serious description than anything her unlucky escort was\r\nthinking of, and a minute or two passed in silence before she could make\r\nup her mind to speak.\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking a great deal about you lately, and wishing very\r\nmuch to see you," said Lucilla. "Did not Mrs Woodburn tell you?--I think\r\nI should have written to you had I known your address."\r\n\r\n"And I am sure you would have made me the happiest of men," said the\r\nvictim, with rueful politeness. "What had I done to deserve such a\r\nprivilege? But my sister did not tell me; she left me to hear it from\r\nyour own----"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Miss Marjoribanks, with a certain solemnity, interrupting\r\nhim; "I have been thinking a great deal--and _hearing_ a great deal\r\nabout you, Mr Cavendish." When she had said this Lucilla sighed, and her\r\nsigh found a terrible echo in her hearer\'s bosom. She knew that he\r\nturned green in the darkness as he gave an anxious look at her. But he\r\nwas too much alarmed to give her an opportunity of studying his face.\r\n\r\n"_Hearing_ of me," he said, and tried to laugh; "what have my kind\r\nfriends been saying?" and for one moment the sufferer tried to delude\r\nhimself that it was some innocent gossip about Barbara which might be\r\ncirculating in Grange Lane.\r\n\r\n"Hush," said Lucilla, "don\'t laugh, please; for I want to have a very\r\nserious talk. I have been hearing about you from some very, very old\r\nfriends, Mr Cavendish--not anything about _this_, you know," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks added, waving her hand in the direction of Grove Street.\r\nAnd then Barbara Lake and everything connected with her vanished like a\r\nshadow from the unfortunate man\'s mind. It was horribly ungrateful on\r\nhis part, but it was, as Miss Marjoribanks would have said, just what\r\nmight have been expected, and how They always behave. He had no longer\r\nany time or patience for the object which had been giving occupation and\r\ninterest to his solitude. He woke up in a moment, and gave a passing\r\ncurse to his folly, and faced the real danger as he best could.\r\n\r\n"You must be making a mistake, Miss Marjoribanks," he said, with some\r\nbitterness; "it should have been, very, very old enemy. I know who it\r\nis. It is that Archdeacon you ladies make such a fuss about. It is he\r\nwho has been telling lies about me," said Mr Cavendish. He breathed a\r\ndeep hard breath as he spoke, and the blood came back to his face.\r\nPerhaps for the first moment he felt satisfied, and breathed freer after\r\nit was over; but at the same time it was very dreadful to him to feel\r\nthat he was found out, and that henceforth Grange Lane would shut its\r\ndoors and avert its countenance. "If you take his word for it, I may\r\ngive in at once," he continued, bitterly. "A parson will say anything;\r\nthey are as bad as--as women." This the poor man said in his despair,\r\nbecause he did not know what he was saying; for in reality he knew that\r\nwomen had been his best friends, and that he had still a chance, if the\r\njudgment was to rest with them.\r\n\r\n"You are very ungrateful to say so," said Miss Marjoribanks, "but it is\r\nonly because you are excited, I suppose. No, Mr Cavendish, it was not\r\nthe Archdeacon; on the contrary, it was a lady, and she said nothing but\r\ngood of you," said Lucilla; and then there was a pause. As for Mr\r\nCavendish, it would be altogether impossible to describe the state of\r\nhis mind. He was like a man suddenly reprieved, but giddy with the\r\nshock, and feeling the halter still round his neck, and knowing that he\r\nhad himself undermined the ground on which he was standing. It was\r\nLucilla who supported him in the shock of the moment, for all his\r\nself-command could not keep him from a momentary shiver and stagger when\r\nhe found that things were not so bad as he thought.\r\n\r\n"A lady, and she said nothing but good!" he muttered, under his breath;\r\nand then he made an effort to recover himself. "Pardon me, I cannot\r\nguess who my unknown friend may be. It is very soothing to one\'s\r\nfeelings to be spoken well of by a lady," said Mr Cavendish, and he\r\nlaughed again in a discordant unsteady way. Lucilla regarded him through\r\nall these fluctuations with natural pity, and at the same time with the\r\ncalmness of a knowledge which was aware of all and had nothing more to\r\ndiscover; and at the end Mr Cavendish perceived her calm, and the\r\nabsence of wonder and curiosity in her face, and began to perceive that\r\nhe had something very serious to deal with--more serious even than he\r\nhad at first supposed.\r\n\r\n"I am going to tell you all about it," said Miss Marjoribanks, "but in\r\nthe meantime wait a minute and let me speak to you. I have something\r\nvery serious to say."\r\n\r\nIt was for this they stopped short at the foot of Grange Lane just where\r\nthe land was already parcelled out for St Roque\'s. What Lucilla was\r\ngoing to say was too important to be spoken while walking, and she\r\nwithdrew her hand from Mr Cavendish\'s arm. They were both so much\r\nabsorbed that they did not see anybody coming, nor indeed had any\r\nattention to spare for external affairs. The blood had deserted Mr\r\nCavendish\'s face, and he was once more green with anxiety and\r\ninquietude. He stood facing her, feeling that the crisis of his fate\r\nhad come, and not knowing whether it was absolute despair or a faint\r\ndawning of hope that possessed him. If he had been the most passionate\r\nof lovers, and if she had held in her hands the dreadful alternative\r\nbetween rapture and misery, there could not have been a more rapt and\r\nabsorbing attention in Mr Cavendish\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I want to tell you, first of all, that you must have confidence in me,"\r\nsaid Lucilla; "you--must--have confidence in me. We can do nothing\r\nwithout that. I know everything, Mr Cavendish," Miss Marjoribanks added\r\ncompassionately--"_everything_; but nobody else knows it. I hope I can\r\narrange everything if it is left in my hands. This is what I wanted to\r\ntell you first of all. Before everything, you must have confidence in\r\nme."\r\n\r\nWhat Mr Cavendish might have answered to this solemn appeal it would be\r\nvain to imagine; for the truth was, he was stopped before he could utter\r\na word. He was stopped and seized by the hand, and greeted with a\r\nfrankness which was, perhaps, all the more loud and cordial from what\r\nappeared to the new-comer the comic character of the situation. "It _is_\r\nCavendish, by Jove!" the intruder exclaimed, waving his hand to some\r\npeople who were coming on behind him. "I beg a thousand pardons for\r\ndisturbing you, my dear fellow; but they all talk about you so, that I\r\nwas determined to make sure it was you. Good heavens, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks!" General Travers added, taking off his hat. It was Mr and\r\nMrs Centum who were coming down behind him--she with a light shawl\r\nthrown over her head, tempted out by the beauty of the evening; and\r\nLucilla saw in a moment the consequences of this encounter, and how it\r\nwould be over all Carlingford before to-morrow morning that she and Mr\r\nCavendish were betrothed at the very least. Miss Marjoribanks had all\r\nher wits about her, as ever, fortunately for both.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is me," she said calmly; "I have been taking tea with the\r\nLakes, and I made Mr Cavendish give me his arm home. He did not like\r\nbeing found out, to be sure, but he could not help himself; and we all\r\nknow about that," Lucilla added, with a smile, taking once more the\r\nunfortunate man\'s arm. "Oh, yes, we all know," said Mrs Centum, with a\r\nlaugh; but yet, notwithstanding, everybody felt sure that it was all\r\nLucilla\'s cleverness, and that Barbara Lake was a myth and fiction. And\r\nit was thus, with Miss Marjoribanks leaning on his arm, and General\r\nTravers, in all the warmth of renewed friendship, guarding him on the\r\nother side, that Mr Cavendish, whose head was in a whirl of excitement,\r\nand who did not know what he was doing, was led back in triumph past\r\nColonel Chiley\'s very door, where the Archdeacon was lying in wait to\r\ncrunch his bones, back from all his aberrations into the very heart of\r\nGrange Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXIX_\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Cavendish was led back to his own house that evening by General\r\nTravers, whose claim of acquaintance was too decided to be rejected. He\r\nnever knew very well what passed between the moment when Miss\r\nMarjoribanks began to expound to him the urgent necessity that he should\r\nconfide in her, and the moment in which he found himself in his own\r\nhouse, admitted eagerly by the surprised and anxious servants, and\r\nconducted by the energetic soldier. That he had taken leave of Lucilla\r\nat her own door, that he had watched her white dress sweep away into the\r\ndark garden with a faint sense that it was his only remaining protector\r\nwho thus left him, and that after that he had smoked a horrible cigar\r\nwith Mr Centum, and been accompanied home by the old acquaintance, who\r\nhad turned up at so unlucky a moment,--was all that the poor man was\r\naware of. And yet it is to be supposed that on the whole he behaved\r\nhimself very much like other people, since General Travers had no\r\ndistinct idea that his company was undesirable, or that his cordial\r\nrecognition was anything but welcome. The General, indeed, took it as\r\nquite natural, under the circumstances, that Cavendish should be a\r\nlittle confused. A man who is no longer a very young man, and has a\r\ncharacter to support, does not care to be found mooning with the object\r\nof his affections on a summer evening, like a boy of twenty; and General\r\nTravers was perfectly aware that he had thus a very good joke against\r\nCavendish. "It is worth a man\'s while to set up a bachelor establishment\r\nin the country," the General said. "By Jove! I wish I could do it. It\r\nmakes a fellow feel Arcadian, and ready for anything;" and for his own\r\npart he was very ready to seize upon his former acquaintance, a man who\r\nbelonged to his club, and had a chance to know what he was talking\r\nabout. "As for Charlie Centum," the soldier said, "what between business\r\nand matrimony, he has grown the greatest guy imaginable; and I can\'t go\r\noff directly, you know; and then there\'s always this business about the\r\ndepot. It\'s immense luck to find you here, Cavendish," General Travers\r\nadded, with flattering cordiality; and if poor Mr Cavendish was not\r\ngrateful, it certainly was not his friend\'s fault. He led the way into\r\nhis house with a glum countenance and a sinking heart, though\r\nfortunately the latter was not visible. It was a very nice house, fitted\r\nup with all that luxury of comfort which a man who has, as Mrs Centum\r\nsaid, "only himself to look to," can afford to collect around him. Mr\r\nCavendish had only himself, and he had made his habitation perfect,\r\nthough, on the whole, he did not pass a very great deal of his time at\r\nhome. He had some nice pictures and a good library, though he was not\r\nparticularly given to the arts; and he had an admirable cellar, as all\r\nthe gentlemen owned in Carlingford, though, for his own part, he was\r\nvery moderate in that point, and did not give himself any airs on the\r\nsubject. Mr Centum, on the contrary, was one of the men who talk about\r\nvintages, and raise expectations never to be carried out. And General\r\nTravers could not but feel the force of the contrast as he sat deep into\r\nthe night, and "talked over everything," with the man who by that time\r\nhe felt convinced was one of his best friends.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr Cavendish, it would be very difficult to describe his\r\nfeelings. He had been knocking about in all sorts of poor places, making\r\nclandestine visits to his sister, and hovering round the more than\r\nsuburban simplicity of Grove Street, and the sense of being once more\r\nenveloped and surrounded by all that was pleasant to the eye and\r\ncomfortable to the outer man was wonderfully consolatory and agreeable.\r\nBut his mind was in a dreadfully harassed condition all the same. He was\r\npreoccupied to the last degree, wondering what Miss Marjoribanks really\r\nknew, and how far he had betrayed himself, and to what extent it would\r\nbe safe, as she herself said, to confide in Lucilla; and at the same\r\ntime he was obliged to listen to and show a certain interest in the\r\nGeneral\'s stories, and to make now and then a painful effort of mind to\r\nrecall some of the mutual friends referred to, whose names and persons\r\nhad in the meantime slipped out of his memory. All the babble of the\r\nclub, which General Travers felt must be so refreshing to the ears of a\r\nrusticated member, fell as flat upon Mr Cavendish, whose mind was full\r\nof other matters, as if it had been the merest old woman\'s gossip,\r\nwhich, to be sure, it slightly resembled in some points. The gallant\r\nGeneral made himself so agreeable that he nearly drove the unfortunate\r\nman out of his senses, and, when he had exhausted all other means of\r\naggravation, returned with fresh zest to the sentimental circumstances\r\nin which, as he supposed, he had found his companion out.\r\n\r\n"Very sensible I call it," said General Travers. "To be candid, I don\'t\r\ncall her strictly handsome, you know; she\'s too big for that--and I\r\ndon\'t suppose she\'s of any family to speak of; though perhaps you don\'t\r\nmind that trifling circumstance; but a woman that will dress well and\r\nlight up well, and knows how to give a man a capital dinner, by Jove!\r\nand no doubt has a pretty little bit of money into the bargain--I\r\nrespect your taste, Cavendish," said the friendly critic, with effusion;\r\nand somehow this applause irritated its recipient more than all that had\r\ngone before.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I am much obliged to you," said Mr Cavendish, "though,\r\nunfortunately, I don\'t merit your approbation. Miss Marjoribanks is a\r\ngreat friend of mine, but she wouldn\'t have me, and I don\'t mean to ask\r\nher. At the same time, she has very good connections; and that is not\r\nthe way to talk of a girl of twenty. She is worth a dozen of your fast\r\nyoung ladies," said the sufferer, with some heat. He was not in the\r\nleast in love with Lucilla, and indeed had a certain dread of her at\r\nthis present moment; but he could not forget that she had once stood by\r\nhim in his need--and, besides, he was glad of any subject on which he\r\ncould contradict his visitor. "I dare say her family is better than\r\neither yours or mine. Scotch, you know," said Mr Cavendish, trying to\r\nlaugh. As for the General, he leaned back on his chair with an indulgent\r\nair, and stroked his mustache.\r\n\r\n"Beg your pardon--meant no offence," he said. "For my part, I don\'t see\r\nthat it matters, if a woman is good-looking and has something, you know.\r\nFor instance, there was a pretty little thing--a charming little\r\nthing--Lake, or something like that----"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Mr Cavendish. It was a frightful want of self-control; but he\r\nhad been a long time at full strain, and he could not help it. It did\r\nnot occur to him, for the moment, that nobody in his senses would have\r\napplied the term "little thing" to Barbara; and, after all the slow\r\naggravation that he had been submitting to, the idea of this insolent\r\nsoldier interfering in Grove Street was beyond his power of endurance.\r\nAs for the General, the tone of this exclamation was such that he too\r\nturned round on his chair, and said, "Yes?" with equally unmistakable\r\nmeaning, startled, but ready for the emergency, whatever it might be.\r\n\r\nThus the two looked at each other for a second, friends in the ordinary\r\nacceptation of the word, and yet, perhaps, on the eve of becoming\r\nenemies. Mr Cavendish had, up to that moment, pretty nearly forgotten\r\nBarbara Lake. It was a piquant sort of occupation when he had nothing\r\nelse to do, and when the world, according to his morbid fancy, was on\r\nthe eve of turning its back upon him--but from the moment when he had\r\nsaid between his teeth "Confound these women!" and had felt the\r\nexcitement of the approaching crisis, Barbara, and her crimson cheeks,\r\nand her level eyebrows, and her contralto, had gone altogether out of\r\nhis mind. At the same time, it is quite true that a man may feel himself\r\nat liberty to forget a woman when other matters of more immediate\r\ninterest are absorbing his attention, and yet be driven furious by the\r\nidea suddenly presented to him that somebody else, who has nothing\r\nearthly to do with it, is about to interfere. Mr Cavendish, however,\r\nrecovered himself while the General sat staring at him, and began to see\r\nhow ridiculous his defiance was.\r\n\r\n"Well?--go on. I did not say anything," he said, and lighted another\r\ncigar. Yet he did not face his companion as a friendly listener should,\r\nbut began to beat measure to an irritating imaginary air on the table,\r\nwith a certain savage energy by moments, as if he were beating time on\r\nthe General\'s head.\r\n\r\n"Then why do you stop a fellow short like that?" said General Travers;\r\n"I was going to tell you of some one I saw the other day in the house of\r\nyour--your friend, you know. She was under Miss Marjoribanks\'s wing,\r\nthat was how I saw her--and I hope you are not playing the gay deceiver,\r\nmy friend;--a little thing, round-faced, hazel-eyed--a little soft\r\nrosebud sort of creature," said the General, growing eloquent. "By Jove!\r\nCavendish, I hope you don\'t mean to make yourself disagreeable. These\r\nsort of looks, you know----"\r\n\r\n"It was Rose, I suppose," said Mr Cavendish, relieved in a moment; and,\r\nto tell the truth, he could not help laughing. The more eloquent and\r\nangry the General grew, the more amused and contemptuous grew his\r\nentertainer. He was so tickled by the position of affairs, that he\r\nactually forgot his anxieties for the moment. "No doubt it was Rose," he\r\nrepeated, and laughed; Rose! what anybody could see in that little\r\ndragon! And then the contrast between the soldier, who prided himself on\r\nhis knowledge of the world, and liked to talk of his family and\r\nposition, to the annoyance of those who had none, and the amusement of\r\nthose who happen to possess these valuable qualifications--and the\r\nmistress of the Female School of Design, filled Mr Cavendish with\r\namusement: perhaps all the more because he himself was in a similar\r\nscrape. As for General Travers, he was as much disposed to be angry as,\r\na moment before, Mr Cavendish had been.\r\n\r\n"It might be Rose," he said, "or Lily either, for anything I can tell;\r\nbut there is nothing laughable in it that I can see. You seem to be\r\nperfectly _au courant_, at all events--which I hope is quite\r\nsatisfactory to Miss Marjoribanks," said the soldier; and then he\r\nresumed, after a disagreeable little pause, "they tell me that everybody\r\nmeets at the Doctor\'s on Thursdays. I suppose I shall see you there.\r\nThursday, ain\'t it? to-morrow?" He looked as he spoke, with what seemed\r\nto his victim an insulting consciousness, in poor Cavendish\'s face. But,\r\nin reality, the General did not mean to be insulting, and knew nothing\r\nwhatever of the horrible internal pang which rent his companion when it\r\nwas thus recalled to him that it _was_ to-morrow--a fact which, up to\r\nthis moment, had not occurred to the unfortunate. To-morrow; and not\r\neven to-morrow--to-day--for by this time it was two o\'clock in the\r\nmorning, and the unwelcome intruder was wasting the little time he had\r\nfor deciding what he should do. Once more his own personal anxieties,\r\nwhich he had put aside for a moment at the sudden dictate of jealousy,\r\nsurged over everything, and swallowed up all lesser sensations.\r\nTo-morrow!--and by this time everybody knew that he was in Carlingford,\r\nand he could not stay away from the weekly assembly without attracting\r\ngeneral attention to himself, and throwing open the flood-gates of\r\nsuspicion. What was he to do? should he turn his back on the enemy once\r\nfor all, and run away and break off his connection with Carlingford? or\r\nshould he dare everything and face the Archdeacon, and put his trust in\r\nLucilla, as that high-minded young woman had invited him to do? With\r\nthese thoughts in his mind, it may be supposed that Mr Cavendish gave\r\nbut a very mingled attention to the babble of his visitor, who found the\r\nwine and the cigars so good, and perhaps had begun to be a little moved\r\nout of his ordinary lucidity by their effect.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got a nice little house, Cavendish," said the General, "but it\'s\r\ntoo small for a married man, my boy. These women are the very deuce for\r\nturning a man out of his comfortable quarters. You\'ll have to go in for\r\nboudoirs and those sort of things; and, by George! you\'ll be an ass if\r\nyou do, with a snug little box like this to retire into," said the\r\nphilosophical warrior; and poor Cavendish smiled a ghastly smile, with\r\nthe strongest inclination all the time to take him by the collar and\r\nturn him out of doors. But then he _was_ a warrior and a general\r\nofficer, and a member of the same club, and six feet high--all which\r\nparticulars, not to speak of the sacred rights of hospitality, made it\r\nsomewhat difficult to carry this idea out.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think Centum will be sitting up for you?" he said mildly;\r\n"it\'s past two o\'clock; and it\'s Thursday morning," the victim added,\r\nwith a sigh. The last words were an involuntary utterance of his own\r\ndespair, but fortunately they struck General Travers\'s vein of humour,\r\nwhich happened to be lively at the moment, and worked the desired but\r\nunexpected result. The General laughed loud and long, and declared that\r\nhe respected a man who was above-board, and meant to look respectable\r\nfor Miss Marjoribanks\'s sake; and then he poured a mighty libation to\r\nLucilla, and took an affectionate leave of her supposed lover. The\r\nGeneral made a great commotion in the decorous quiet of Grange Lane when\r\nhe knocked at Mr Centum\'s door. Though it was nearly three o\'clock in\r\nthe morning, nothing but his inherent dread of a woman would have\r\nprevented him from knocking up the banker to share his hilarity; but Mrs\r\nCentum, in her nightcap, peaceably asleep as she was at the moment,\r\ndaunted the soul of the gallant soldier; and naturally his recollection\r\nwas not very perfect next day. "I had something very funny to tell you;\r\nbut, by Jove! I forget what it was!" General Travers said next morning\r\nwhen he met his host at breakfast; and thus one bad joke at least was\r\nspared. But Mr Cavendish shut his door upon his departing guest, without\r\nany sense, poor fellow, of having done or said anything in the least\r\nfunny. He said, "Thank Heaven!" with a kind of groan of relief when his\r\ntroublesome visitor was gone. And then he went back again into his\r\nlibrary, where they had been sitting. Perhaps he had never fully\r\nappreciated before the comfort of everything, the handsome house which\r\nhe had enjoyed so long without thinking anything of it, and all the\r\npleasant luxurious accessories of life. He had been doing without them\r\nfor a week or two, and he had not liked it; and yet at that moment it\r\nseemed to Mr Cavendish that he could rather be content to lose them all\r\nat a stroke, to make it known in Carlingford that he was ruined and had\r\nlost his fortune, than that Carlingford should find out that he was not,\r\nafter all, one of the Cavendishes, nor the person it took him for. But,\r\nalas! all his fortune could not bring reality to these pretensions, nor\r\nhinder the exposure to which he looked forward with such horror. It is\r\ntrue that he was an adventurer, but he was not a base one; nor had he\r\ndone anything dishonourable either to gain his fortune or to captivate\r\nthe good opinion of society, which had become so important to him. But\r\nthere are actual crimes that would be sooner forgiven to a man than the\r\nfolly of having permitted himself to be considered one of the\r\nCavendishes, and having set his heart on making a figure in that mild\r\nprovincial world. Mr Cavendish knew enough of human nature to know that\r\na duchess or a lord-chamberlain would forgive more readily than Mr and\r\nMrs Centum any such imposition upon them, and intrusion into their\r\nexclusive circle. And then his sister, who could not run away! For her\r\nsake it seemed to him that he had better rush off at once, and sell his\r\nhouse and furniture and horses, and give up Carlingford. As he thought\r\nof that, all the advantages of Carlingford came upon him stronger than\r\never. Perhaps a man who has always been used to be recognised as one of\r\nthe members of a local aristocracy, would not have seen anything half so\r\nprecious as Mr Cavendish saw in the fact of being everywhere known and\r\nacknowledged as a constituent part of Grange Lane;--recognised by the\r\ncounty people, and by the poor people, and pointed out as he passed by\r\none and another to any stranger who might happen to be so ignorant as\r\nnot to know Mr Cavendish. To people who are not used to it, there is a\r\ncharm in this universal acknowledgment. And then he had more need of it\r\nthan most men have; and, when Carlingford signed his patent of\r\ngentility, and acknowledged and prized him, it did an infinite deal more\r\nthan it had any intention of doing. To keep its regard and recognition\r\nhe would have done anything, given up the half or three parts, or even,\r\non emergency, all he had. Perhaps he had an undue confidence in the\r\nmagnanimity of society, and was too sure that in such a case it would\r\nbehave with a grandeur worthy of the occasion; but still he was quite\r\nright in thinking that it could forgive the loss of his fortune sooner\r\nthan his real offence. And now it was Thursday morning, the day upon\r\nwhich he must either fight or flee. He too had laughed at Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s evenings in his time, and thought of Thursday lightly as\r\nLucilla\'s day; but there was nothing in the least amusing in the\r\nprospect of that assembly now.\r\n\r\nWhen a man has thoughts like these to entertain him, nothing can be more\r\nuseless than to go to bed, although in ordinary circumstances, at three\r\no\'clock in the morning, that is about the only thing one can do. Poor Mr\r\nCavendish, however, was not quite free to act as he thought proper. He\r\nhad been a long time away from home, and he did not feel himself in a\r\nposition to shock his servants\' feelings with impunity. He went to his\r\nroom, accordingly, like a martyr, carrying all his difficulties with\r\nhim, and these unpleasant companions naturally made a night of it when\r\nthey had him all to themselves. When sheer fatigue and exhaustion\r\nprocured him a moment\'s sleep, it was only getting deeper and deeper\r\ninto trouble: for then it was the Archdeacon who had planted a heavy\r\nfoot on his neck, or General Travers, who, with still more fatal force,\r\nhad found out the way to Grove Street. When Mr Cavendish awoke, he said\r\nto himself, "Confound these women!" with more fervour than ever; but, at\r\nthe same time, he swore a mighty oath to himself that he would horsewhip\r\nthe fellow who ventured to come in his way. Barbara Lake might be no\r\ngreat things, but at least it was to him, and no one else, that she\r\nbelonged. Such was the complication that afforded him a little outlet\r\nfor his temper in the midst of the dreadful difficulties of his\r\nposition, and the question which was constantly renewing itself in his\r\nthoughts, as to whether he should go or stay. The idea of presenting\r\nhimself in the centre of society in Miss Marjoribanks\'s drawing-room,\r\nand being met by the Archdeacon, and held up to public contempt there\r\nand then, with all the world looking on, and even Travers, who would\r\ncarry the narrative out of Carlingford, was something too horrible to be\r\ncontemplated; and yet how was he to escape? He was still in this state\r\nof mind, driven backwards and forwards by every new wind, when the\r\nmorning came, and when Miss Marjoribanks\'s note was put into his hand.\r\n\r\nFor the truth was, that, after long consideration, Lucilla had\r\ndetermined that the matter was one which could not be permitted to stand\r\nover. She was of too energetic a temperament to let things linger on in\r\nan uncertain way when they could be made an end of, and brought to a\r\nconclusion; and then, as nobody can predict what sudden and unexpected\r\nturn human affairs may take, it was always possible that, if Miss\r\nMarjoribanks did not make an end of the business dramatically, and to\r\nthe satisfaction of everybody concerned, it might be found some fine day\r\nto have resolved itself by means of some one of those illegitimate and\r\nincomplete expedients which abound in ordinary life. It was with this\r\nview that Miss Marjoribanks took the step of writing to Mr Cavendish.\r\nShe had written in the sacred retirement of her own maiden chamber, when\r\nall the world was still; perhaps at the moment when General Travers was,\r\nas he would himself have vulgarly called it, "chaffing" Cavendish about\r\nthe beautiful and disinterested friendship which united him to the young\r\nsovereign of Grange Lane. But naturally such poor raillery was far from\r\nthe virginal thoughts of Lucilla at that retired and sacred hour; and we\r\nmay venture to add that the elevating influence of the maiden\'s bower in\r\nwhich she composed it, and of that tranquil moment of meditation and\r\nsolitude, breathed in every line, and gave force to every sentiment of\r\nthe letter which Mr Cavendish tore open with an excited hand. Perhaps he\r\nwas too anxious and curious to give it the solemn perusal which it ought\r\nto have received.\r\n\r\n     "MY DEAR MR CAVENDISH,--It was very unlucky that we should have\r\n     been interrupted this evening at such an important moment, when I\r\n     had so much to say to you. But I think the best thing I can do is\r\n     to write, feeling quite sure that when you know all, _you cannot\r\n     possibly mistake_ my motives. Everybody has retired, and I am quite\r\n     alone, and the silence[2] seems to me full of meaning when I think\r\n     that the fate of a person for whom I have so great a regard may be\r\n     hanging upon it. I might be afraid of writing to you so frankly, if\r\n     I did not feel quite sure that you would appreciate my intention.\r\n\r\n     "Dear Mr Cavendish, it is not the Archdeacon who has said anything.\r\n     _He does not know it is you_; therefore, of course, he could not\r\n     say anything directly bearing upon you. But then, you know, if he\r\n     were to meet you by hazard, as he is sure to do some day--and for\r\n     my part I rather think he is fond of Grove Street--you would be\r\n     exposed at once, and everything would be lost, for we all know the\r\n     prejudices that exist in Carlingford. I have another plan of\r\n     operations to propose to you, which I feel quite sure is for your\r\n     good, and also naturally for the good of anybody to whom you may\r\n     intend to unite your fortunes. I feel quite sure that it is far\r\n     safer to adopt a bold resolution, and to have it over at once. Come\r\n     to dinner to-morrow. If you may happen to find an enemy, you will\r\n     find also an unlooked-for friend; and, so far as I am concerned,\r\n     you _know_ that you may calculate on my support. I do not wonder at\r\n     your being anxious about it; but if you will only have full\r\n     confidence in me and a little in yourself, believe me it will be\r\n     all over in a night. If there had ever been anything between you\r\n     and me, as these stupid people suppose, I might have felt\r\n     hesitation in writing to you like this; but when I know a thing to\r\n     be right, I hope I will never be afraid to do it. I have been\r\n     called upon to do many things that are not common for girls of my\r\n     age, and perhaps that is why I made up my mind at once to set this\r\n     all straight for you. Once more I repeat, dear Mr Cavendish, have\r\n     confidence in me. Come to-morrow evening as if nothing had\r\n     happened; and take my word for it that all will go well.--Your\r\n     friend,\r\n\r\n     "LUCILLA MARJORIBANKS.\r\n\r\n     "_P.S._--If you would like to come and talk it over with me\r\n     to-morrow, I shall be at home till twelve o\'clock; but unless it\r\n     will be a satisfaction to your own mind, it is not necessary for\r\n     me, for I have all my plans laid."\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It is only justice to Miss Marjoribanks to say that she was\r\nnot addicted to fine writing; but then she was a person who liked to\r\nhave everything in keeping, and naturally an emergency such as the\r\npresent does not come every day, and requires to be treated\r\naccordingly.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would be quite out of the question to attempt any explanation of Mr\r\nCavendish\'s feelings when he read this letter. His utter bewilderment,\r\nhis terror, his rage, his final helpless sense that it would be utterly\r\nhopeless for him, or half a dozen men, to enter the field against this\r\ncurious complication of unknown friends and open enemies and generous\r\nprotectors, took away from him the last remnant of courage. He did not\r\nknow what to do or to think. He swallowed his coffee with a sense of\r\ndespair, and sent the rest of his breakfast away untasted; thus\r\nbetraying, without intending it, his emotions to his kitchen. "It stands\r\nto reason as there\'s a cause for it," Mr Cavendish\'s domestics concluded\r\nin committee of the whole house; and surely, if ever man had good reason\r\nfor not eating his breakfast, it was he. When he had gone over it all\r\nagain till his head had grown utterly confused and his thoughts were all\r\ntopsy-turvy, Mr Cavendish took a sudden resolution. He went upstairs and\r\nchanged his dress with a certain solemnity. He made a toilette more\r\ncareful than if he were going, as he once had gone, to propose. It was\r\nlike Nelson going into gala uniform for a battle. And then he went out\r\nto discover, if possible, what was coming to him. The difference was,\r\nthat in this battle no honour, but only a possible salvage of reputation\r\nand fortunate escape, was to be gained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXX_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible that some people may think Mr Cavendish\'s emotions too\r\nacute for all the danger to which he was exposed; but no doubt every\r\nalarm gets intensified when a man broods on it, and thinks of nothing\r\nelse for weeks at a time. All that he had to do at the present moment\r\nwas to walk into Carlingford by the most frequented way, and to go up\r\nGrange Lane, where every house was open to him, and where nobody was so\r\ngreat a favourite as he. There were as many chances in his favour that\r\nhe would not in that friendly neighbourhood encounter his one enemy, as\r\nthere is for every man who goes into action that the bullet which is\r\npredestined to strike somebody will not be directed to him; but then Mr\r\nCavendish had not the excitement of personal conflict, nor the kind of\r\nsecurity which is given by sharing a risk with a great many other\r\npeople. And to see everything smiling and serene around, and yet to know\r\nthat the most deadly danger may arrive to you at any innocent opening,\r\nor round the first street-corner, is a kind of risk which naturally\r\ntells upon the nerves more than a more open peril. Mr Cavendish met Dr\r\nMarjoribanks, and the Doctor was good enough to stop his brougham and\r\nkeep him in conversation for five minutes with his back to the foe, if\r\nfoe there was approaching; and then he met Mrs Chiley, who all but\r\nkissed him, and was so glad to see him again, and so pleased that he was\r\nin time to make acquaintance with the Archdeacon, and so sure that\r\nLucilla would be quite happy now he had come back. "Perhaps I ought not\r\nto say so, but I _know_ she has missed you," said the injudicious old\r\nlady; and she took both his hands and held the miserable man in a kind\r\nof pillory, from whence he gazed with despairing eyes over her shoulder,\r\nfeeling sure that now was the fatal moment, and that his enemy _must_ be\r\ncoming. But fortune still favoured him, as it happened. He had the\r\npresence of mind to say, "I am going to call on Miss Marjoribanks;" and\r\nMrs Chiley dropped his hands on the instant as if they burned her, and\r\npatted him on the arm and sent him away. "She is sure to be in just now,\r\nand I am so glad; and, my dear, you need not mind me, for I am both your\r\nfriends," Mrs Chiley said. But when he was delivered from that danger,\r\nsomething still more formidable awaited the unfortunate man. He could\r\nnot believe his eyes at first, nor conceive it possible that Fate would\r\nhave such a spite against him; but there was no mistaking the crumpled\r\ndress, any more than the straight eyebrows and flashing oblique glances\r\nthat had already found him out. Of all the horrible chances in the\r\nworld, it was Barbara--Barbara, who had a right to think he had deserted\r\nher on the previous night, and with whom his next interview could not be\r\notherwise than stormy--who thus appeared like a lion in his way. When he\r\nsaw what awaited him, Mr Cavendish lost courage. His heart sank down\r\ninto unfathomable depths. He did not know what he could say to her to\r\nshorten the inevitable interview, nor how he could escape, nor how\r\nhinder her from discovering that it was Lucilla he was going to see; and\r\nhe had no longer any doubt in his mind that while he was thus engaged\r\nthe Archdeacon must inevitably appear. If he had had time to think of\r\nordinary subjects, he would have been sufficiently annoyed at the idea\r\nof an interview with Barbara in broad daylight on the sacred soil of\r\nGrange Lane, where all the world could or might be spectators; but such\r\na merely prudential sentiment was entirely swallowed up to-day in much\r\nmore urgent considerations. He would have been content just now, in the\r\nhorror of the moment, to plight his troth to Barbara by way of getting\r\nrid of her, and leaving his path clear; but he could not stop her or\r\nhimself from advancing, and dared not give any vent to the panic which\r\nwas consuming his soul.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am sure I never thought of seeing you here, Mr Cavendish," said\r\nBarbara, with a toss of her head. She would have done a great deal to\r\nsecure her wavering lover, but she could not be amiable at a moment when\r\nshe had him at a disadvantage. "Perhaps you are going to see Miss\r\nMarjoribanks," said the foolish young woman. To tell the truth, she did\r\nnot suspect him of any such treachery; but her heart was beating louder\r\nthan usual, and she had the best position of the two, or thought she\r\nhad, and chose what she supposed the most aggravating thing to say.\r\n\r\nBut it is always hard to tell what a man may do when he is in a state of\r\ndespair. Mr Cavendish looked her in the face with the composure of\r\ndesperation, though she did not know that. All that he was able to think\r\nof was how to get rid of her soonest, and to be able to continue his\r\nway. "Yes, I am going to see Miss Marjoribanks," he said, with a face\r\nwhich extremity rendered stolid and impassible. As for poor Barbara, her\r\ncolour changed in a moment. The very least that she had a right to\r\nexpect was that he should have asked her pardon, put himself at her\r\nfeet; and her mingled spite and humiliation and mortification at this\r\nresponse were beyond telling. Her cheeks blazed with sudden rage, her\r\npassion was so furious that she actually did what he wanted and stood\r\nout of his way, and made him an imperious sign to pass on and leave her.\r\nBut even then she did not expect to be taken at her word. When Mr\r\nCavendish took off his hat in that heartless way and passed on, Barbara\r\nstood aghast, not able to believe her senses. Had he really passed and\r\nleft her, she who had done so much for him? Had he actually gone over to\r\nher adversary before her very eyes? She stood stock-still when he left\r\nher, gazing after him, blazing with rage and despite, and scarcely able\r\nto keep herself from shrieking out the torrent of reproaches and\r\nvituperations that were in her mind. She made no attempt whatever to\r\nhide her wrath or jealous curiosity from any eyes that might be there to\r\nsee; but to be sure she had, as her sister said, no proper pride. If Mr\r\nCavendish had carried out his intentions, the chances are that Barbara,\r\ndriven desperate, would have rushed after him, and found some means of\r\nbreaking in upon his interview with Lucilla; but after all this\r\nbadgering, he had not the courage to carry out his intentions. He looked\r\ndown the long sunshiny line of Grange Lane with a sickening sense that\r\nany of these doors might open at any moment, and his fate rush out upon\r\nhim. There was not a soul to be seen, but that only made it all the more\r\nlikely to poor Mr Cavendish\'s distempered fancy that somebody was\r\ncoming. He had not even a single thought at leisure to give to Barbara,\r\nand never asked himself whether or not she was standing watching him.\r\nAll his senses and faculties were engaged forecasting what might happen\r\nto him before he could reach Dr Marjoribanks\'s house. He was approaching\r\nit from the lower end of Grange Lane, and consequently had everything to\r\nrisk; and when Mr Centum\'s door opened, and all the nurses and all the\r\nchildren poured out, the unfortunate man felt his heart jump, and drop\r\nagain, if possible, lower than ever. It was this that drove him, instead\r\nof going on to Lucilla, to take refuge in his sister\'s house, where the\r\ndoor happened to be open. He rushed in there, and took breath, and was\r\nsafe for the instant. But Barbara, for her part, watching him, divined\r\nnone of Mr Cavendish\'s reasons. Her heart too gave a jump, and her wrath\r\ncooled down miraculously. No doubt it was a little impatience at being\r\nquestioned which had made him answer as he did. He had not gone to\r\nLucilla--he had not deserted her standard, who had always met him\r\nhalf-way, and done so much for him. Barbara calmed down as she saw him\r\nenter at Mrs Woodburn\'s door. After having thus witnessed his safe exit,\r\nshe felt at liberty to go back and return to her own affairs, and\r\nprepare her toilette for the evening; for it moved her very little less\r\nthan Mr Cavendish to know that it was Thursday, and that there was no\r\ntelling what might happen that night.\r\n\r\nAs for the hero of all this commotion, he went and buried himself in Mrs\r\nWoodburn\'s back drawing-room, and threw himself on the sofa in the dark\r\ncorner, and wiped his forehead like the Archdeacon. It was not his fault\r\nif events had overwhelmed him. If he had not met in succession Dr\r\nMarjoribanks and Mrs Chiley and Barbara, he would have gone right to\r\nLucilla without stopping to question himself further--but he could not\r\nbear all this accumulation. Panic had seized upon him, and this panic\r\nwrought more effectually than all argument. It was so terrible to live\r\nunder such a shadow, that he felt it must be put an end to. If only he\r\nwere left at rest for this moment, he felt that he could make up his\r\nmind to take the perilous leap at night, and dare everything. "It can\'t\r\nbe worse than ruin," he said to himself, and tried not to think that\r\nfor his sister it might be something even worse than ruin. But the first\r\nthing of all was to get a little rest in the meantime, and hide himself,\r\nand forget the nightmare that was seated on his shoulders. When Mrs\r\nWoodburn came to him in haste, and saw his careful dress and pale looks,\r\nshe was frightened for the moment. She thought it possible for one\r\nsecond that despair had driven him out of his wits, and that there might\r\nbe, for anything she could tell, a little bottle of prussic acid in his\r\nwaistcoat pocket. That was her first idea, and her second was that he\r\nwas going to carry out at last his most wise and laudable resolution of\r\nproposing to Miss Marjoribanks, and that it was this--naturally a\r\nserious and hazardous enterprise--which made him look so pale.\r\n\r\n"Harry, if you are going to Lucilla----!" said Mrs Woodburn; "wait and\r\nrest yourself a little, and I will get you a glass of wine. Keep still;\r\nthere\'s some Tokay," said the anxious sister. "Don\'t you go and worry\r\nyourself. You shall see nobody. I\'ll bring it you with my own hand."\r\n\r\n"Oh, confound the Tokay!" said Mr Cavendish. "I know what Woodburn\'s\r\nTokay is--if that mattered. Look here, I want to speak to you. I _was_\r\ngoing to Lucilla, but I\'m not up to it. Oh, not in the way you think!\r\nDon\'t be a fool like everybody. I tell you she wouldn\'t have me, and I\r\nwon\'t ask her. Read this, which is much more to the purpose," Mr\r\nCavendish added, taking out Miss Marjoribanks\'s letter. He watched her,\r\nwhile she read it, with that sense of contempt and superiority which a\r\nman naturally feels who has advanced much beyond the point in any\r\nspecial matter at which his interlocutor is still stationary. He even\r\nsmiled at her cry of horror and amazement, and found the agitation she\r\nshowed ridiculous. "Don\'t make a row about it," he said, regaining his\r\ncolour as his sister lost hers. "It\'s all right. I can\'t ask Lucilla\r\nMarjoribanks to have me after that, but I mean to put my trust in her,\r\nas she says. I was going to ask her to explain; but after all, on\r\nthinking of it, I don\'t see the good of explanations," said Mr\r\nCavendish, with lofty tranquillity. "The fact is, she is right, Nelly,\r\nand, stand or fall, we\'ll have it out to-night."\r\n\r\nBut Mrs Woodburn was scarcely in a condition to reply, much less to give\r\nany advice. "Oh, good heavens! what does she know?" cried the trembling\r\nwoman. "What do you suppose she can know? She gave me a dreadful\r\nfright, coming and asking about you and your name. And then she never\r\nwas a great friend of mine--and if she should say anything to Woodburn!\r\nOh, Harry, go away, go away, and don\'t face her. You know you slighted\r\nher, and she is laying a snare for us. Oh, Harry, go away! She can\'t do\r\nyou much harm, but she could ruin me, and any little peace I have!\r\nWoodburn would never--never forgive--he would be frantic, you know. It\r\nhas always been he that made a fuss about the Cavendishes--and, good\r\nheavens! to be in a girl\'s power, and she one that you have slighted,\r\nHarry! Oh, for Heaven\'s sake, for pity\'s sake, if you care anything for\r\nme----"\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, Nelly," said Mr Cavendish. "Don\'t make a row. What on\r\nearth is the use of Heaven\'s-saking? I tell you I am going to make an\r\nend of it. If I were to run away now, it would turn up again at some\r\nother corner, and some other moment. Give me a pen and a bit of paper. I\r\nwill write a note, and say I am coming. I don\'t want any explanations.\r\nIf it\'s all a mistake, so much the better; but I\'m going to face it out\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Mrs Woodburn recovered her senses; but in the\r\nmeantime her brother wrote Lucilla his note, and in sight of his\r\nsister\'s agitation felt himself perfectly composed and serene and\r\nmanful. It even made him complaisant to feel the difference that there\r\nwas, when the emergency really arrived at last, between his own manly\r\ncalm and her womanish panic. But then it was for herself that she was\r\nafraid, lest her husband should find out that she was not one of the\r\nCavendishes. "You must have been giving yourself airs on the subject,"\r\nMr Cavendish said, as he fastened up his note. "I never was so foolish\r\nas that, for my part;" and naturally the more he admired his own\r\nsteadiness and courage, the steadier and more courageous he grew--or at\r\nleast so he felt for the moment, with her terror before his eyes.\r\n\r\n"If you do go," said Mrs Woodburn at last, "oh, Harry, for goodness\'\r\nsake, mind that you deny _everything_. If you confess to anything, it\r\nwill all be proved against you; don\'t allow a single thing that\'s said\r\nto you. It is a mistaken identity, you know--that is what it is; there\r\nwas a case in the papers just the other day. Oh, Harry, for Heaven\'s\r\nsake don\'t be weak!--deny everything; you don\'t know anything about\r\nit--you don\'t know what they mean--you can\'t understand----"\r\n\r\n"It is I that have to do it, Nelly," said Mr Cavendish, more and more\r\ntranquil and superior. "You must let me do it my way;" and he was very\r\nkind and reassuring to her in his composure. This was how things ought\r\nto be; and it was astonishing how much he gained in his own mind and\r\nestimation by Mrs Woodburn\'s panic. Being the stronger vessel, he was of\r\ncourse superior to all that. But somehow when he had got back to his own\r\nhouse again, and had no longer the spectacle of his sister\'s terror\r\nbefore him, the courage began to ooze out of Mr Cavendish\'s\r\nfinger-points; he tried hard to stimulate himself up to the same point,\r\nand to regain that lofty and assured position; but as the evening\r\napproached, matters grew rather worse than better. He did not turn and\r\nflee, because flight, in the present alarmed and touchy state of public\r\nopinion, would have equally been destruction; and nobody could answer\r\nfor it how far, if he failed to obey her, Miss Marjoribanks\'s discretion\r\nmight go. And thus the eventful evening fell, and the sun went down,\r\nwhich was to Mr Cavendish as if it might be the last sun he should ever\r\n(metaphorically) see--while, in the meantime, all the other people\r\ndressed for dinner as if nothing was going to happen, and as if it was\r\nmerely a Thursday like other Thursdays, which was coming to Grange\r\nLane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXXI_\r\n\r\n\r\nLucilla waited till twelve o\'clock, as she had said, for Mr Cavendish\'s\r\nvisit; and so mingled are human sentiments, even in the mind of a person\r\nof genius, that there is no doubt she was at once a little disappointed,\r\nand that Mr Cavendish gained largely in her estimation by not coming.\r\nHer pity began to be mingled by a certain respect, of which, to tell the\r\ntruth, he was not worthy; but then Miss Marjoribanks did not know that\r\nit was circumstances, and not self-regard, or any sense of dignity, that\r\nhad kept him back. With the truest consideration, it was in the\r\ndining-room that Lucilla had placed herself to await his visit; for she\r\nhad made up her mind that he should not be disturbed _this time_ by any\r\nuntimely morning caller. But as she sat at the window and looked out\r\nupon the garden, and was tantalised by fifty successive ringings of the\r\nbell, none of which heralded her expected visitor, a gentler sentiment\r\ngradually grew in Lucilla\'s mind. Perhaps it would not be just to call\r\nit positively regret; but yet she could not help a kind of impression\r\nthat if the Archdeacon had never come to Carlingford, and if Mr\r\nCavendish had never been so weak as to be drawn aside by Barbara Lake,\r\nand if everything had gone as might have been expected from first\r\nappearances--that, on the whole, it might have been well. After all, he\r\nhad a great many good qualities. He had yielded to panic for the moment,\r\nbut (so far as Lucilla knew) he was now girding up his loins to meet the\r\nemergency in a creditable way; and if, as has been just said, nothing\r\nhad come in the way--if there had been no Archdeacon, no Mrs Mortimer,\r\nno Barbara--if Mr Chiltern had died, as was to have been expected, and\r\nMr Cavendish been elected for Carlingford--then Lucilla could not help a\r\nmomentary sense that the arrangement altogether might have been a not\r\nundesirable one. Now, of course, all that was at an end. By dexterous\r\nmanagement the crisis might be tided over, and the worst avoided; but\r\nLucilla became regretfully conscious that now no fate higher than\r\nBarbara was possible for the unfortunate man who might once, and with\r\nhope, have aspired to herself. It was very sad, but there was no help\r\nfor it. A certain tenderness of compassion entered Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\nbosom as she realised this change. It would be hard if a woman did not\r\npity a man thus shut out by hard fate from any possibility of ever\r\nbecoming the companion of her existence--a man who, on the whole, had\r\nmany capabilities, yet whose highest fortune in life could not mount\r\nabove Barbara Lake!\r\n\r\nThis thought filled Lucilla\'s heart with gentle regret. It was sad, but\r\nit was inevitable; and when Mr Cavendish\'s note was brought to her, in\r\nwhich he said simply, and very briefly, that though not sure whether he\r\nunderstood the meaning of her letter, he should certainly do himself the\r\npleasure of accepting as usual her kind invitation, Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\nregret grew more and more profound. Such a man, who had been capable of\r\nappreciating herself, to think that, having known her, he should decline\r\nupon Barbara! The pity was entirely disinterested, for nobody knew\r\nbetter than Lucilla that, under the circumstances, no other arrangement\r\nwas possible. He might marry the drawing-master\'s daughter, but Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was too well aware of her duty to her friends, and to her\r\nposition in society, to have given her consent to his marriage with\r\nanybody\'s daughter in Grange Lane. But still it was a pity--nobody could\r\nsay that it was not a pity--a man so visibly capable of better things.\r\n\r\nLucilla, however, could not afford to waste her morning in unprofitable\r\nregrets. An evening so critical and conclusive had to be provided for in\r\nmany different ways. Among other things, she had to invite, or rather\r\ncommand, the presence of a guest whom, to tell the truth, she had no\r\nparticular desire to see. The Archdeacon was only a man when all was\r\nsaid, and might change his mind like other men; and to bring Mrs\r\nMortimer to Grange Lane in the evening, looking interesting, as, to be\r\nsure, she could look by times, after that unpleasant exhibition of Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s feelings, was naturally a trial to Lucilla. Mr Beverley\r\nhad drawn back once before, and that when Mrs Mortimer was young, and no\r\ndoubt a great deal more attractive than at present; and now that she was\r\na widow, forlorn and faded, it would be no wonder if he were to draw\r\nback, especially, as Lucilla acknowledged to herself, when he saw the\r\nancient object of his affections in her own society, and among all the\r\nfresh young faces of Grange Lane: and if the Archdeacon should draw\r\nback, and leave the field open, and perhaps the Doctor, who ought to\r\nknow better, should step in--when she had got so far, Lucilla rose up\r\nand shook out her draperies, as if by way of shaking off the\r\ndisagreeable idea. "At all events I have to do my duty," she said to\r\nherself. And thus it was with that last and most exquisite refinement of\r\nwell-doing, the thought that she might possibly be going to harm herself\r\nin benefiting others, that Miss Marjoribanks heroically put on her hat,\r\nand issued forth in the dinner-hour of the little pupils, to invite her\r\nlast and most important guest.\r\n\r\nThis period of suspense had not been by any means a happy or comfortable\r\nperiod for Mrs Mortimer. The poor widow was living in a constant\r\nexpectation of something happening, whereas her only true policy was to\r\nhave made up her mind that nothing would ever happen, and shaped herself\r\naccordingly to her life. Instead of eating her dinner as she ought to\r\nhave done at that hour of leisure, and fortifying herself for the weary\r\nafternoon\'s work, she was sitting as usual at the window when Miss\r\nMarjoribanks came to the door. And if it was a tedious business looking\r\nout of the window when the rain was drenching the four walls of the\r\ngarden and breaking down the flowers, and reducing all the poor little\r\nshrubs to abject misery, it could not be said to be much more cheerful\r\nin the sunshine, when pleasant sounds came in over that\r\nenclosure--voices and footsteps of people who might be called alive,\r\nwhile this solitary woman was buried, and had nothing to do with life.\r\nSuch a fate may be accepted when people make up their minds to it; but\r\nwhen, so far from making up one\'s mind, one fixes one\'s thoughts upon\r\nthe life outside, and fancies that every moment the call may come, and\r\none may find one\'s place again in the active world, the tedium grows\r\nmore and more insupportable. As for Lucilla, naturally she could not see\r\nany reason why Mrs Mortimer should sit at the window--why she could not\r\ncontent herself, and eat her dinner instead.\r\n\r\n"There are a great many people in Carlingford who have not nearly such a\r\npleasant lookout," Lucilla said; "for my part, I think it is a very\r\npretty garden. The wistaria has grown quite nice, and there is a little\r\nof everything," said Miss Marjoribanks; and, so far as that went, she\r\nwas no doubt the best judge, having done it all herself.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, it is very pretty; and I am sure I am very grateful to\r\nProvidence for giving me such a home," said the widow; but she sighed,\r\npoor soul, as she said it: for, to tell the truth, though she was not\r\nso young as she once was, it takes some people a long time to find out\r\nthat they themselves are growing old, and have done with life. And then\r\noutside, in that existence which she could hear but could not see, there\r\nwas one figure which was wonderfully interesting to poor Mrs Mortimer;\r\nwhich is a complication which has a remarkable effect on the question of\r\ncontent or discontent.\r\n\r\n"You ought to take a walk every day," said Miss Marjoribanks, "that is\r\nwhat is the matter with you; but, in the meantime, there is something\r\nelse I want you to do. This is Thursday, you know, and I have always\r\nsome people on Thursday. It is not a party--it is only an Evening--and\r\nno dress to speak of. Your black silk will look quite nice, and be all\r\nthat is necessary. Black is very becoming to some people," said Lucilla\r\nreflectively. She looked at Mrs Mortimer with her head a little on one\r\nside, and saw in a moment, with the rapid glance of genius, just what\r\nshe wanted. "And some lace for your head," Miss Marjoribanks added. "I\r\ndon\'t think you have gone off at all, and I am sure you will look very\r\nnice. It is at nine o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"This evening, Lucilla!" said Mrs Mortimer, faintly: "but you know I\r\nnever go out--I am not fit for society. Oh, don\'t ask me, please! Since\r\npoor Edward died----\'\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lucilla, "it must have been a great loss, I am sure; though\r\nI can\'t say I mind going into a room alone, as some people do; but you\r\nknow you can avoid that, if you like, by coming early. Come at eight,\r\nand there will be nobody in the drawing-room, and you can choose your\r\nown corner. Put it quite back--at the back of your head," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, with a little anxiety. "I could show you how if I had the\r\nlace. I do so want you to look nice. Oh, never mind the fashion. When\r\none has a style of one\'s own, it is always twenty times better. Put it\r\nas you used to wear it before you were married; and then, with that nice\r\nblack silk----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lucilla, don\'t ask me," said the widow. "I shall not know how to\r\ntalk, nor look, nor anything; and then I know nobody; and then----"\r\n\r\n"My dear, you have always _me_," said Lucilla, with tender reproach. "I\r\nam so sorry I can\'t stop any longer. I leave it quite to your own taste\r\nabout the lace. And you will find people you know, you may be quite sure\r\nof that. Remember, not later than nine o\'clock; and come at eight if you\r\ndon\'t like to come into the room by yourself. Good-bye now. I want you\r\nto look very nice to-night," Miss Marjoribanks added, giving her friend\r\nan affectionate kiss; "you must, for my sake."\r\n\r\n"But, Lucilla----" cried Mrs Mortimer.\r\n\r\nIt was vain to make any further protest, however, for Lucilla was gone,\r\nhaving, in the first place, communicated her requirements to Mary Jane,\r\nwho was not likely to forget, nor to let her mistress be late. "And mind\r\nshe is _nice_," said Miss Marjoribanks emphatically, as she went out at\r\nthe door. It was necessary she should be nice; without that the intended\r\n_situation_ which Lucilla was preparing--the grand finale of her\r\nexertions--would fall flat, and probably fail of its effect. For this it\r\nwas necessary that the widow should look not only pretty, but\r\ninteresting, and a little pathetic, and all that a widow should look\r\nwhen first dragged back into society. Miss Marjoribanks gave a momentary\r\nsigh as she emerged from the garden door, and could not but feel\r\nconscious that in all this she might be preparing the most dread\r\ndiscomfiture and downfall for herself. Even if it passed over as it\r\nought to do, and nobody was charmed but the Archdeacon, who was the\r\nright person to be charmed, Lucilla felt that after this she never could\r\nhave that entire confidence in her father which she had had up to this\r\nmoment. The incipient sentiment Dr Marjoribanks had exhibited was one\r\nthat struck at the roots of all faith in him as a father; and every\r\nperson of sensibility will at once perceive how painful such a\r\nsuggestion must have been to the mind of a young woman so entirely\r\ndevoted as was Miss Marjoribanks to the consolation and comfort of her\r\ndear papa.\r\n\r\nLucilla was not allowed to spend the rest of this momentous afternoon in\r\nmaturing her plans, as might have been necessary to a lesser\r\nintelligence; and when the refreshing moment came at which she could\r\nhave her cup of tea before preparing for the fatigues of the evening, it\r\nwas Mrs Chiley who came to assist at that ceremony. The old lady came in\r\nwith an important air, and gave Lucilla a long, lingering kiss, as old\r\nladies sometimes do when they particularly mean it. "My dear, I am not\r\ngoing to stay a moment, but I thought you might have something to tell\r\nme," the kind old woman said, arranging herself in her chair with the\r\nsatisfaction of a listener who expects to be confided in. As for\r\nLucilla, who had no clue to Mrs Chiley\'s special curiosity, and who had\r\na good many things on her mind just at that moment which she rather\r\npreferred not to talk about, she was for once struck with veritable\r\nastonishment, and did not know what to say.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley, what should I have to tell you?" said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. "You know very well where I should go the very first\r\nmoment if anything happened;" and by way of staving off more particular\r\nquestions, she took her old friend a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, I hope so," said Mrs Chiley, but at the same time her\r\ndisappointment was evident. "It is very nice, thank you--your tea is\r\nalways nice, Lucilla--but it was not that I was thinking of. I can\'t\r\nunderstand how it is, I am sure. I saw him to-day with my own eyes, and\r\ncould not help seeing how anxious he was looking! I hope, I do hope, you\r\nhave not been so cruel as to refuse him, Lucilla--and all for something\r\nthat is not his fault, poor fellow, or that could be explained, you may\r\nbe sure."\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks grew more and more surprised as she listened. She put\r\naway the kettle without filling the teapot, and left her own cup\r\nstanding untasted, and went and sat down on the stool by Mrs Chiley\'s\r\nfeet. "Tell me whom I have refused this time, for I don\'t know anything\r\nabout it," said Lucilla; and then her visitor burst forth.\r\n\r\n"It must be all that creature\'s fault! He told me he was coming here;\r\nand to tell the truth, I stood and watched him, for you know how\r\ninterested I am, my dear; and then a little while after he met _that_\r\nBarbara. Oh, Lucilla, why were you ever so foolish as to have her here?\r\nI told you how it would end when you brought those artist people about\r\nyour house. They are all a set of adventurers!" cried Mrs Chiley. "I saw\r\nthem meet, and I was so disgusted that I did not know what I was doing;\r\nbut he passed her as nicely as possible. Just a civil word, you know,\r\nand then he was past. Just as I would have done myself; for it is always\r\nbest not to be uncivil to anybody. I could see her standing as if she\r\nhad been struck with lightning; and naturally, Lucilla, I never thought\r\nanything else than that he had come here, and that all was right between\r\nyou. Oh, my dear, I hope you are sure you have not refused him," Mrs\r\nChiley said, piteously; "anyhow, Lucilla, you need not mind telling\r\n_me_. I may be sorry, but I will not blame you, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I have not refused anybody," said Lucilla, with a modest innocence that\r\nit was a pleasure to see; "but, dear Mrs Chiley," she continued,\r\nraising her drooping eyelids, "I think you make a mistake about Mr\r\nCavendish. My own opinion is that Barbara would make him a very nice\r\nwife. Oh, please, don\'t be angry! I don\'t mean to say, you know, that I\r\nthink her quite what one would call _nice_--for oneself. But then the\r\ngentlemen have such strange ways of thinking. Many a girl whom we could\r\nnot put up with is quite popular with Them," said Miss Marjoribanks,\r\nwith a certain mild wonder at the inexplicable creatures whom she thus\r\ncondescended to discuss. "I suppose they have a different standard, you\r\nknow; and for my part, I would advise Mr Cavendish to marry Barbara. I\r\nthink it is the best thing he could do."\r\n\r\n"Lucilla!" cried Mrs Chiley, almost with a shriek of horror. She\r\nthought, as was perhaps natural, that there was some pique in what her\r\nyoung companion said; not doing Miss Marjoribanks justice--as indeed few\r\npeople did--for that perfect truthfulness which it was Lucilla\'s luck\r\nalways to be able to maintain. Mrs Chiley thought it was her young\r\nfriend\'s maidenly pride and determination not to take up the part of a\r\nwoman slighted or jilted. "You may refuse him, my dear, if your heart is\r\nnot with him," said the old lady; "but I would not be so hard upon him\r\nas that, poor fellow. You may say what you please, but I always will\r\nthink him nice, Lucilla. I know I ought to be on the Archdeacon\'s side,"\r\nsaid Mrs Chiley, putting her handkerchief to her eyes; "but I am an old\r\nwoman, and I like my old friends best. Oh, Lucilla, it is not kind of\r\nyou to keep up appearances with me. I wish you would give way a little.\r\nIt would do you good, my darling; and you know I might be both your\r\ngrandmothers, Lucilla," she cried, putting her arm round her favourite.\r\nAs for Miss Marjoribanks, she gave her old friend a close embrace, which\r\nwas the only thing that even her genius could suggest to do.\r\n\r\n"I have always _you_," said Lucilla, with touching eloquence; and then\r\nshe freed herself a little from Mrs Chiley\'s arms. "I don\'t say,\r\nperhaps, that everybody will receive her; but I mean to make an effort,\r\nfor my part; and I shall certainly tell Mr Cavendish so if he ever\r\nspeaks of it to me. As for Mr Beverley, he is going to be married too.\r\nDid not you hear? He told me all about it himself one day," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks; "and I will ask him to-night if I may not tell you who the\r\nlady is. It is quite a little romance, and I hope we shall have two\r\nmarriages, and it will make it quite gay for the winter. When you know\r\nall about it," Lucilla added tenderly, by way of breaking the shock, "I\r\nam sure you will be pleased."\r\n\r\nBut instead of being pleased, Mrs Chiley was speechless for the moment.\r\nHer fresh old cheeks grew ashy with dismay and horror. "The Archdeacon\r\ntoo!" she cried, gasping for breath. "Oh, Lucilla, my dear?--and you?"\r\nThen the kind old lady held Miss Marjoribanks fast, and sobbed over her\r\nin the despair of the moment. To think, after all the pains that had\r\nbeen taken, and all the hopes and all the speculations, that neither the\r\none nor the other was coming to anything! "If it should be that General,\r\nafter all--and I cannot abide him," sobbed Lucilla\'s anxious friend. But\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s genius carried her through this trial, as well as\r\nthrough all the others which she had yet encountered on her way.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley!" said Lucilla, "it is so good of you to care; but if\r\nit had been _that_ I was thinking of, I need never have come home at\r\nall, you know; and my object in life is just what it has always been, to\r\nbe a comfort to papa."\r\n\r\nUpon which Mrs Chiley kissed her young friend once more with lingering\r\nmeaning. "My dear, I don\'t know what They mean," she said, with\r\nindignation; "everybody knows men are great fools where women are\r\nconcerned--but I never knew what idiots they were till now; and you are\r\ntoo good for them, my darling!" said Mrs Chiley, with indignant\r\ntenderness. Perhaps Miss Marjoribanks was in some respects of the same\r\nway of thinking. She conducted her sympathetic friend to the garden\r\ndoor, when it came to be time for everybody to go and dress, with a\r\ncertain pathetic elevation in her own person, which was not out of\r\naccord with Mrs Chiley\'s virtuous wrath. To have Mrs Mortimer and\r\nBarbara Lake preferred to her did not wound Lucilla\'s pride--one can be\r\nwounded in that way only by one\'s equals. She thought of it with a\r\ncertain mild pity and charitable contempt. Both these two men had had\r\nthe chance of having _her_, and this was how they had chosen! And there\r\ncan be little wonder if Miss Marjoribanks\'s compassion for them was\r\nmingled with a little friendly and condescending disdain.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, an ease to Lucilla\'s mind that she had let Mrs Chiley\r\nknow, and was so far free to work out her plans without any fear of\r\nmisconception. And on the whole, her old friend\'s tender indignation was\r\nnot disagreeable to her. Thus it was, without any interval of repose to\r\nspeak of, that her lofty energies went on unwearied to overrule and\r\nguide the crisis which was to decide so many people\'s fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXXII_\r\n\r\n\r\nDr Marjoribanks was not a man to take very much notice of trivial\r\nexternal changes; and he knew Lucilla and her constitution, and, being a\r\nmedical man, was not perhaps so liable to parental anxieties as an\r\nunprofessional father might have been; but even he was a little struck\r\nby Miss Marjoribanks\'s appearance when he came into the drawing-room. He\r\nsaid, "You are flushed, Lucilla? is anything going to happen?" with the\r\ncalmness of a man who knew there was not much the matter--but yet he did\r\nobserve that her colour was not exactly what it always was. "I am quite\r\nwell, papa, thank you," said Lucilla, which, to be sure, was a fact the\r\nDoctor had never doubted; and then the people began to come in, and\r\nthere was no more to be said.\r\n\r\nBut there could be no doubt that Lucilla had more colour than usual. Her\r\npulse was quite steady, and her heart going on at its ordinary rate; but\r\nher admirable circulation was nevertheless so far affected, that the\r\nordinary rose-tints of her complexion were all deepened. It was not so\r\ndistinctly an improvement as it would have been had she been habitually\r\npale; but still the flush was moderate, and did Miss Marjoribanks no\r\nharm. And then it was a larger party than usual. The Centums were there,\r\nwho were General Travers\'s chaperons, and so were the Woodburns, and of\r\ncourse Mrs Chiley, which made up the number of ladies beyond what was\r\ngeneral at Dr Marjoribanks\'s table. Lucilla received all her guests with\r\nthe sweetest smiles and all her ordinary ease and self-possession, but\r\nat the same time her mind was not free from some excitement. She was on\r\nthe eve of a crisis which would be the greatest failure or the greatest\r\nsuccess of her public life, and naturally she anticipated it with a\r\ncertain emotion.\r\n\r\nMr Cavendish, for his part, had sufficient sense to come very early, and\r\nto get into a dark corner and keep himself out of the way; for though he\r\nwas screwed up to the emergency, his self-possession was nothing to\r\nthat of Lucilla. But on the whole, it was perhaps Mrs Woodburn who\r\nsuffered the most. Her heightened colour was more conspicuous than that\r\nof Miss Marjoribanks, because as a general rule she was pale. She was\r\npale, almost white, and had dark eyes and dark hair, and possessed\r\nprecisely all the accessories which make a sudden change of complexion\r\nremarkable; and the effect this evening was so evident that even her\r\nhusband admired her for a moment, and then stopped short to inquire, "By\r\nGeorge! had she begun to paint?" to which question Mrs Woodburn\r\nnaturally replied only by an indignant shrug of her white shoulders and\r\naversion of her head. She would not have been sorry, perhaps, for this\r\nnight only, if he had believed that it was rouge, and not emotion. Of\r\nall the people at Dr Marjoribanks\'s table, she perhaps was the only one\r\nreally to be pitied. Even Mr Cavendish, if vanquished, would at the most\r\nreceive only the recompense of his deeds, and could go away and begin\r\nover again somewhere else, or bury himself in the great depths of\r\ngeneral society, where nobody would be the wiser; but as for his sister,\r\nshe could not go away. The first result for her would be to give the\r\nmaster to whom she belonged, and for whom she had, with some affection,\r\na great deal of not unnatural contempt, a cruel and overwhelming power\r\nover her; and she knew, poor soul, that he was not at all too generous\r\nor delicate to make use of such a power. In such a case she would be\r\nbound to the rock, like a kind of hapless Andromeda, to be pecked at by\r\nall the birds and blown at by all the winds, not to speak of the\r\ndevouring monster from whom no hero could ever deliver her; and with all\r\nthese horrible consequences before her eyes, she had to sit still and\r\nlook on and do nothing, to see all the hidden meaning of every look and\r\nmovement without appearing to see it, to maintain ordinary conversation\r\nwhen her ear was strained to the uttermost to hear words of fate on\r\nwhich her whole future depended. No wonder her colour was high; and she\r\ncould not go into a corner, as Mr Cavendish did, nor keep silent, nor\r\nwithdraw herself from observation. Neither her pulse nor her heart would\r\nhave borne the scrutiny to which Miss Marjoribanks\'s calm organs might\r\nhave been subjected with perfect security; and the chances are, if the\r\nDoctor had by any hazard put his finger on her wrist when he shook hands\r\nwith her, that instead of handing her over to General Travers to be\r\ntaken down to dinner, he would have, on the contrary, sent her off to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nFortunately by this time the year was declining, and that happy season\r\nhad returned in which people once more begin to dine by artificial\r\nlight; and at the same time it was not absolutely dark in the\r\ndrawing-room, so that Lucilla had not, as she said, thought it necessary\r\nto have the candles lighted. "If there should happen to be a mistake as\r\nto who is to take down who, it will only be all the more amusing," said\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, "so long as you do not go off and leave _me_." This\r\nwas addressed to the Archdeacon, to whom Lucilla was very particular in\r\nher attentions at that moment. Mrs Chiley, who was looking on with a\r\ngreat sense of depression, could not help wondering why--"When she knows\r\nhe is engaged and everything settled," the old lady said to herself,\r\nwith natural indignation. For her part, she did not see what right a man\r\nhad to introduce himself thus under false pretences into the confiding\r\nbosom of society--when he was as bad as married, or even indeed worse.\r\nShe was ruffled, and she did not think it worth while to conceal that\r\nshe was so; for there are limits to human patience, and a visitor who\r\nstays six weeks ought at least to have confidence in his entertainers.\r\nMrs Chiley for once in her life could have boxed Lucilla\'s ears for her\r\nuncalled-for civility. "I think it very strange that it is not the\r\nGeneral who takes her downstairs," she said to Mrs Centum. "It is all\r\nvery well to have a respect for clergymen; but after being here so\r\noften, and the General quite a stranger--I am surprised at Lucilla,"\r\nsaid the indiscreet old lady. As for Mrs Centum, she felt the neglect,\r\nbut she had too much proper pride to own that her man was not receiving\r\ndue attention. "It is not the first time General Travers has been here,"\r\nshe said, reserving the question; and so in the uncertain light, when\r\nnobody was sure who was his neighbour, the procession filed downstairs.\r\n\r\nTo enter the dining-room, all brilliant and shining as it was, radiant\r\nwith light and flowers and crystal and silver, and everything that makes\r\na dinner-table pretty to look upon, was, as Mrs Centum said, "quite a\r\ncontrast." A close observer might have remarked, as Mrs Woodburn and\r\nLucilla took their places, that both of them, instead of that flush\r\nwhich had been so noticeable a short time before, had become quite pale.\r\nIt was the moment of trial. Poor Mr Cavendish, in his excitement, had\r\ntaken just the place he ought not to have taken, immediately under the\r\nlamp at the centre of the table. During the moment when the unsuspecting\r\nArchdeacon said grace with his eyes decorously cast down, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks owned the ordinary weakness of humanity so much as to drop\r\nher fan and her handkerchief, and even the napkin which was arranged in\r\na symmetrical pyramid on her plate. Such a sign of human feebleness\r\ncould but endear her to everybody who was aware of the momentous\r\ncharacter of the crisis. When these were all happily recovered and\r\neverybody seated, Lucilla kept her eyes fixed upon the Archdeacon\'s\r\nface. It was, as we have said, a terrible moment. When he raised his\r\nhead and looked round him, naturally Mr Beverley\'s eyes went direct to\r\nthe mark like an arrow; he looked, and he saw at the centre of the\r\ntable, surrounded by every kind of regard and consideration, full in the\r\nlight of the lamp, his favourite adventurer, the impostor whom he had\r\ndenounced the first time he took his place by Miss Marjoribanks\'s side.\r\nThe Archdeacon rose to his feet in the excitement of the discovery; he\r\nput his hand over his eyes as if to clear them. He said, "Good God!"\r\nloud out, with an accent of horror which paralysed the two people lower\r\ndown than himself. As for Miss Marjoribanks, she was not paralysed--she\r\nwho had not lost a single glance of his eyes or movement of his large\r\nperson. Lucilla rose to the height of the position. She put her hand\r\nupon his arm sharply, and with a certain energy. "Mr Beverley, Thomas is\r\nbehind you with the soup," said Miss Marjoribanks. The Archdeacon turned\r\nround to see what it was, conscious that somebody had spoken to him, but\r\nas indifferent to his companion and to civility as he was to Thomas and\r\nthe soup. "What?" he said hoarsely, interrupting his scrutiny for the\r\nmoment. But when he had met Miss Marjoribanks\'s eye the Archdeacon sat\r\ndown. Lucilla did not liberate him for a moment from that gaze. She\r\nfixed her eyes upon his eyes, and looked at him as people only look when\r\nthey mean something. "If you tell me what surprised you so much, perhaps\r\nI can explain," said Miss Marjoribanks. She spoke so that nobody could\r\nhear but himself; and in the meantime General Travers at her left hand\r\nwas making himself excessively agreeable to Mrs Woodburn, and no doubt\r\noccupying all her attention; and Lucilla never turned her eyes for a\r\nmoment from the Archdeacon\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," said Mr Beverley. "I was confounded by what I saw.\r\nGood heavens! it is not possible I can deceive myself. I understand your\r\nalarm. I am not going to make a disturbance and break up your party. I\r\ncan wait," the Archdeacon said, drawing a rapid forcible breath. "Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, do you know who that man is?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Lucilla, softening into a smile. "Perfectly, I assure\r\nyou. He is one of papa\'s guests, and very much respected in Carlingford;\r\nand he is one of my--very particular friends," Miss Marjoribanks added.\r\nShe laughed as she spoke, a kind of laugh which is only appropriate to\r\none subject, and which is as good, any day, as a confession; and the\r\nflush was so obliging as to return at that moment to her ingenuous\r\ncountenance. "We have known each other a long time," Lucilla went on\r\nafter that pretty pause; and then she raised her confiding eyes, which\r\nhad been cast down, once more to the Archdeacon\'s face. "You can\'t think\r\nhow nice he is, Mr Beverley," said Miss Marjoribanks. She clasped her\r\nhands together, just for a moment, as she did so, with an eloquent\r\nmeaning which it was impossible to mistake. The Archdeacon, for his\r\npart, gazed at her like a man in a dream. Whether it was true--or\r\nwhether he was being made a fool of more completely than ever man before\r\nwas--or whether he was the victim of an optical or some other kind of\r\ndelusion,--the poor man could not tell. He was utterly stricken dumb,\r\nand did not know what to say. He accepted the soup humbly, which Thomas\r\nset before him, though it was a white soup, an effeminate dish, which\r\nwent utterly in the face of his principles. And then he looked at the\r\ninnocent young creature at his side in that flutter of happy confusion.\r\nIt was a terrible position for the Broad-Churchman. After such a tacit\r\nconfession he could not spring from his seat and hurl the impostor out\r\nof the room, as in the first place he had a mind to do. On the contrary,\r\nit was with a voice trembling with emotion that he spoke.\r\n\r\n"My dear Miss Marjoribanks," said the Archdeacon, "I am struck dumb by\r\nwhat you tell me. Good heavens! that it should have come to this; and\r\nyet I should be neglecting my duty if I kept silent. You do not--you\r\ncannot know who he is."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Lucilla, with another little laugh--"_everything_--and\r\nhow he used to know Mrs Mortimer, and all about it. He has no secrets\r\nfrom me," said Miss Marjoribanks. She caught Mr Cavendish\'s eye at the\r\nmoment, who was casting a stealthy glance in her direction, and who\r\nlooked cowed and silenced and unquiet to the most miserable degree; and\r\nshe gave him a little reassuring nod, which the Archdeacon watched with\r\nan inward groan. What was he to do? He could not publicly expose the man\r\nwho had just received this mark of confidence from his young hostess,\r\nwho knew everything. Perhaps it was one of the greatest trials of\r\nChristian patience and fortitude which the Archdeacon, who was not\r\ngreat, as he himself would have said, in the passive virtues, had\r\nundergone in all the course of his life. He was so utterly subdued and\r\nconfounded that he ate his soup, and never found out what kind of soup\r\nit was. That is, he consumed it in large spoonfuls without being aware,\r\nby way of occupying his energies and filling up the time.\r\n\r\n"You cannot mean it," he said, after a pause. "You must be imperfectly\r\ninformed. At least let me talk to your father. You must hear all the\r\nrights of the story. If you will let me speak half a dozen words to--to\r\nthat person, Miss Marjoribanks, I am sure he will leave the place; he\r\nwill give up any claim----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, please talk to him," said Miss Marjoribanks, "it will be so\r\nnice to see you friends. Nothing would make me so happy. You know I have\r\nheard all about it from you and from Mrs Mortimer already, so I am sure\r\nthere cannot be much more to tell; and as for papa, he is very fond of\r\nMr Cavendish," said Lucilla, with an imperceptible elevation of her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"Is it _he_ whom you call Mr Cavendish?" said the Archdeacon. He too had\r\nraised his voice without knowing it, and several people looked up, who\r\nwere not at the moment engaged in active conversation of their own. The\r\nowner of that name, for his part, also turned his face towards the upper\r\nend of the table. He was sick of the suspense and continued endurance,\r\nand by this time was ready to rush upon his fate.\r\n\r\n"Did any one call me?" he said; and there was a little pause, and the\r\ncompany in general fixed its regard upon those three people with a sense\r\nthat something remarkable was going on among them, though it could not\r\ntell what or why.\r\n\r\n"The Archdeacon wants to make your acquaintance," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. "Mr Cavendish--Mr Beverley. There, you know each other;\r\nand when we are gone you can talk to each other if you like," Lucilla\r\nadded; "but in the meantime _you_ are too far off, and _I_ want the\r\nArchdeacon. He is _so_ much liked in Carlingford," she continued,\r\nlowering her voice. "You can\'t think how glad we are to have him back\r\nagain. I am sure if you only knew him better----" said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. As for the Archdeacon, words could not give any idea of\r\nthe state of his mind. He ate his dinner sternly after that, and did not\r\nlook at anything but his plate. He consumed the most exquisite _plats_,\r\nthe tenderest wings of chicken and morsels of _pat\xe9_, as if they had\r\nbeen his personal enemies. For, to tell the truth, he felt the tables\r\naltogether turned upon him, and was confounded, and did not know what it\r\ncould mean.\r\n\r\nIt was the General who took up Mr Beverley\'s abandoned place in the\r\nconversation. The gallant soldier talked for two with the best will in\r\nthe world. He talked of Cavendish, and all the pleasant hours they had\r\nspent together, and what a good fellow he was, and how much the men in\r\nthe club would be amused to hear of his domesticity. It was a kind of\r\ntalk very natural to a man who found himself placed at table between his\r\nfriend\'s sister, and, as he supposed, his friend\'s future bride. And\r\nnaturally the Archdeacon got all the benefit. As for Lucilla, she\r\nreceived it with the most perfect grace in the world and saw all the\r\ndelicate points of the General\'s wit, and appreciated him so thoroughly,\r\nthat he felt half inclined to envy Cavendish. "By Jove! he is the\r\nluckiest fellow I know," General Travers said; and probably it was the\r\ncharms of his intelligent and animated conversation that kept the ladies\r\nso long at table. Mrs Chiley, for her part, did not know what to make of\r\nit. She said afterwards that she kept looking at Lucilla until she was\r\nreally quite ashamed; and though she was at the other end of the table,\r\nshe could see that the poor dear did not enjoy her dinner. It happened,\r\ntoo, that when they did move at last, the drawing-room was fuller than\r\nusual. Everybody had come that evening--Sir John, and some others of the\r\ncounty people, who only came now and then, and without any exception\r\n_everybody_ in Carlingford. And Lucilla certainly was not herself for\r\nthe first half-hour. She kept close to the door, and regarded the\r\nstaircase with an anxious countenance. When she was herself at the helm\r\nof affairs, there was a certain security that everything would go on\r\ntolerably--but nobody could tell what a set of men left to themselves\r\nmight or might not do. This was the most dreadful moment of the evening.\r\nMrs Mortimer was in the drawing-room, hidden away under the curtains of\r\na window, knowing nobody, speaking to nobody, and in a state of mind to\r\ncommit suicide with pleasure; but Miss Marjoribanks, though she had\r\ncajoled her into that martyrdom, took no notice of Mrs Mortimer. She was\r\ncivil, it is true, to her other guests, but there could not be a doubt\r\nthat Lucilla was horribly preoccupied, and in a state of mind quite\r\nunusual to her. "I am sure she is not well," Mrs Chiley said, who was\r\nwatching her from afar. "I saw that she did not eat any dinner"--and the\r\nkind old lady got up slowly and extricated herself from the crowd, and\r\nput herself in motion as best she could, to go to her young friend\'s\r\naid.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Lucilla turned round radiant upon the\r\nobservant assembly. The change occurred in less than a moment, so\r\nsuddenly that nobody saw the actual point of revolution. Miss\r\nMarjoribanks turned round upon the company and took Mr Cavendish\'s arm,\r\nwho had just come upstairs. "There is a very, very old friend of yours\r\nin the corner who wants to see you," said Lucilla; and she led him\r\nacross the room as a conqueror might have led a captive. She took him\r\nthrough the crowd, to whom she dispensed on every side her most gracious\r\nglances. "I am coming directly," Miss Marjoribanks said--for naturally\r\nshe was called on all sides. What most people remarked at this moment\r\nwas, that the Archdeacon, who had also come in with the other gentlemen,\r\nwas standing very sullen and lowering at the door, watching that\r\ntriumphal progress. And it certainly was not Lucilla\'s fault if Mrs\r\nChiley and Lady Richmond, and a few other ladies, were thus led to form\r\na false idea of the state of affairs. "I suppose it is all right between\r\nthem at last," Lady Richmond said, not thinking that Barbara Lake was\r\nstanding by and heard her. According to appearances, it was all\r\nperfectly right between them. Miss Marjoribanks, triumphant, led Mr\r\nCavendish all the length of the room to the corner where the widow sat\r\namong the curtains, and the Archdeacon looked on with a visible passion,\r\nand jealous rage, which were highly improper in a clergyman, but yet\r\nwhich were exciting to see. And this was how the little drama was to\r\nconclude, according to Lady Richmond and Mrs Chiley, who, on the whole,\r\nwere satisfied with the conclusion. But, naturally, there were other\r\npeople to be consulted. There was Mr Beverley, whom Miss Marjoribanks\r\nheld in leash, but who was not yet subdued; and there was Dr\r\nMarjoribanks, who began to feel a little curiosity about his daughter\'s\r\nmovements, and did not make them out; and there was Barbara Lake, who\r\nhad begun to blaze like a tempest with her crimson cheeks and black\r\nbold eyes. But by this time Lucilla was herself again, and felt the\r\nreins in her hands. When she had deposited Mr Cavendish in safety, she\r\nfaced round upon the malcontents and upon the observers, and on the\r\nworld in general. Now that her mind was at rest, and everything under\r\nher own inspection, she felt herself ready and able for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXXIII_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Archdeacon stood before the fireplace with Dr Marjoribanks and a\r\nhost of other gentlemen. Mr Beverley\'s countenance was covered with\r\nclouds and darkness. He stood, not with the careless ease of a man\r\namusing himself, but drawn up to his full height and breadth, a\r\nformidably muscular Christian, in a state of repression and restraint,\r\nwhich it was painful, and at the same time pleasing to see. The\r\nBerserker madness was upon him; and yet such are the restraints of\r\nsociety, that a young woman\'s eye was enough to keep him down--Lucilla\'s\r\neye, and the presence of a certain number of other frivolous creatures\r\nin white muslin, and of some old women, as he irreverently called them,\r\nwho were less pleasant, but not more imposing. He was an Archdeacon, and\r\na leading man of his party, whose name alone would have conferred\r\nimportance upon any "movement," and whom his bishop himself--not to\r\nspeak of the clergy whom he charged in his visitation addresses like a\r\nregiment of cavalry--stood a little in awe of. Yet such are the\r\nbeneficial restraints of society, that he dared not follow his natural\r\nimpulses, nor even do what he felt to be his duty, for fear of Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, which was about the highest testimony to the value of\r\nsocial influence that could be given. At the same time, it was but\r\nnatural that under such circumstances the Archdeacon should feel a\r\ncertain savage wrath at the bond that confined him, and be more\r\nindignant than usual at the false and tyrannical conventionalism called\r\nsociety. And it was at this moment, of all times in the world, that\r\nGeneral Travers, like a half-educated brute as (according to Mr\r\nBeverley\'s ideas) he was, took the liberty of calling his attention to\r\nwhat the soldier called "a lot of pretty girls." "And everything\r\nadmirably got up, by Jove!" he added; not having the remotest idea what\r\neffect so simple an observation might produce.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is admirably got up," said the Archdeacon, with a snarl of\r\nconcealed ferocity. "You never said anything more profoundly true. It is\r\nall got up, the women, and the decorations, and the gaiety, and all this\r\nspecious seeming. And these are creatures made in the image of God!"\r\nsaid the Broad-Churchman--"the future wives and mothers of England. It\r\nis enough to make the devils laugh and the angels weep!"\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that everybody was stricken with utter amazement by\r\nthis unlooked-for remark. Dr Marjoribanks, for his part, took a pinch of\r\nsnuff, which, as a general rule, he only did at consultations, or in the\r\nface of a difficulty; and as for the unlucky soldier who had called it\r\nforth, there can be no doubt that a certain terror filled his manly\r\nbosom; for he naturally felt as if he must have said something\r\nextraordinary to call forth such a response.\r\n\r\n"I never was accused before of saying anything profoundly true," the\r\nGeneral said, and he grew pale. "I didn\'t mean it, I\'m sure, if that is\r\nany justification. Where has Cavendish vanished to, I wonder?" the\r\nsoldier added, looking round him, scared and nervous--for it was evident\r\nthat his only policy was to escape from society in which he was thus\r\nliable to commit himself without knowing how.\r\n\r\n"Female education is a monstrous mistake," said Mr Beverley--"always has\r\nbeen, and, so far as I can see, always will be. Why should we do our\r\nbest to make our women idiots? They are bad enough by nature. Instead of\r\ncounterbalancing their native frivolity by some real instruction----good\r\nheavens!" The critic paused. It was not that his emotions were too much\r\nfor him; it was because the crowd opened a moment, and afforded him a\r\nglimpse of a figure in black silk, with the lace for which Miss\r\nMarjoribanks had stipulated falling softly over a head which had not\r\nquite lost its youthful grace. He gave a glance round him to see if the\r\ncoast was clear. Lucilla was out of the way at the other end of the\r\nroom, and he was free. He made but one stride through the unconscious\r\nassembly which he had been criticising so severely, and all but knocked\r\ndown little Rose Lake, who was not looking at the Archdeacon, though she\r\nstood straight in his way. He might have stepped over her head without\r\nknowing it, so much was he moved. All the gay crowd gave way before him\r\nwith a cry and flutter; and Lucilla, for her part, was out of the way!\r\n\r\nBut there are moments when to be out of the way is the highest proof of\r\ngenius. Miss Marjoribanks had just had a cup of tea brought her, of\r\nwhich she had great need, and her face was turned in the other\r\ndirection, but yet she was aware that the Archdeacon had passed like a\r\nBerserker through those ranks which were not the ranks of his enemies.\r\nShe felt without seeing it that the "wind of his going" agitated his own\r\nlarge coat tails and heavy locks, and made a perfect hurricane among the\r\nwhite muslin. Lucilla\'s heart beat quicker, and she put down her tea,\r\nthough she had so much need of it. She could not swallow the cordial at\r\nsuch a moment of excitement. But she never once turned her head, nor\r\nleft off her conversation, nor betrayed the anxiety she felt. Up to this\r\ntime she had managed everything herself, which was comparatively easy;\r\nbut she felt by instinct that now was the moment to make a high effort\r\nand leave things alone. And it may be added that nothing but an inherent\r\nsense of doing the right thing under the circumstances could have\r\ninspired Miss Marjoribanks to the crowning achievement of keeping out of\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Beverley arrived in front of the two people who were seated\r\ntogether in the recess of the window, he made no assault upon them, as\r\nhis manner might have suggested. On the contrary, he placed himself in\r\nfront of them, with his back to the company, creating thus a most\r\neffectual moral and physical barrier between the little nook where his\r\nown private vengeance and fate were about to be enacted, and the\r\nconventional world which he had just been denouncing. The Archdeacon\r\nshut the two culprits off from all succour, and looked down upon them,\r\ncasting them into profound shade. "I don\'t know what combination of\r\ncircumstances has produced this meeting," he said, "but the time was\r\nripe for it, and I am glad it has happened," and it was with dry lips\r\nand the calmness of passion that he spoke.\r\n\r\nMrs Mortimer gave a little cry of terror, but her companion, for his\r\npart, sat quite dumb and immovable. The moment had arrived at last, and\r\nperhaps he too was glad it had come. He sat still, expecting to see the\r\nearth crumble under his feet, expecting to hear the humble name he had\r\nonce borne proclaimed aloud, and to hear ridicule and shame poured upon\r\nthe impostor who had called himself one of the Cavendishes. But it was\r\nno use struggling any longer. He did not even raise his eyes, but sat\r\nstill, waiting for the thunderbolt to fall.\r\n\r\nBut to tell the truth, the Archdeacon, though a torrent of words came\r\nrushing to his lips, felt at a difficulty how to begin. "I don\'t\r\nunderstand how it is that I find you here with the man who has ruined\r\nyour prospects," he said, with a slight incoherence; and then he changed\r\nthe direction of his attack. "But it is you with whom I have to do," he\r\nsaid; "you, sir, who venture to introduce yourself into society\r\nwith--with your victim by your side. Do you not understand that\r\ncompassion is impossible in such a case, and that it is my duty to\r\nexpose you? You have told some plausible story here, I suppose, but\r\nnothing can stand against the facts. It is my duty to inform Dr\r\nMarjoribanks that it is a criminal who has stolen into his house and his\r\nconfidence--that it is a conspirator who has ventured to approach his\r\ndaughter--that it is----"\r\n\r\n"A criminal? a conspirator?" said Mr Cavendish, and he looked in his\r\naccuser\'s face with an amazement which, notwithstanding his rage, struck\r\nthe Archdeacon. If he had called him an impostor, the culprit would have\r\nquailed and made no reply. But the exaggeration saved him. After that\r\nfirst look of surprise, he rose to his feet and confronted the avenger,\r\nwho saw he had made a blunder without knowing what it was. "You must be\r\nunder some strange mistake," he said. "What do you accuse me of? I know\r\nnothing about crime or conspiracy. Either you are strangely mistaken, or\r\nyou have forgotten what the words mean."\r\n\r\n"They are words which I mean to prove," said the Archdeacon; but there\r\ncan be no doubt that his certainty was diminished by the surprise with\r\nwhich his accusation was received. It checked his first heat, and it was\r\nwith a slightly artificial excitement that he went on, trying to work\r\nhimself up again to the same point. "You who worked yourself into a\r\nwretched old man\'s confidence, and robbed an unoffending woman," said Mr\r\nBeverley; and then in spite of himself he stopped short; for it was\r\neasier to say such things to a woman, who contradicted without giving\r\nmuch reason, than to a man who, with an air of the utmost astonishment,\r\nstood regarding his accuser in the face.\r\n\r\n"These are very extraordinary accusations," said Mr Cavendish. "Have you\r\never considered whether you had any proof to support them?" He was not\r\nangry to speak of, because he had been entirely taken by surprise, and\r\nbecause at the same time he was unspeakably relieved, and felt that the\r\nreal danger, the danger which he had so much dreaded, was past and over.\r\nHe recovered all his coolness from the moment he found out that it was\r\nnot a venial imposition practised upon society, but a social crime of\r\nthe ugliest character, of which he was accused. He was innocent, and he\r\ncould be tranquil on that score. "As for robbing Mrs Mortimer," he added\r\nwith a little impatience, "she knows, on the contrary, that I have\r\nalways been most anxious and ready to befriend her----"\r\n\r\n"To befriend----Her!" cried the Archdeacon, restored to all his first\r\nimpetuosity. He could not swear, because it was against his cloth and\r\nhis principles; but he said, "Good heavens!" in a tone which would have\r\nperfectly become a much less mild expletive. "It is better we should\r\nunderstand each other thoroughly," he said. "I am not in a humour for\r\ntrifling. I consider it is _her_ fortune which enables you to make an\r\nappearance here. It is _her_ money you are living upon, and which gives\r\nyou position, and makes you presume as--as you are doing--upon my\r\nforbearance. Do you think it possible that I can pass over all this and\r\nlet you keep what is not yours? If you choose to give up everything, and\r\nretire from Carlingford, and withdraw all your pretensions----It is not\r\nfor my part," said Mr Beverley, with solemnity, taking breath, "to deal\r\nharshly with a penitent sinner. It is my duty, as a clergyman, to offer\r\nyou at least a place of repentance. After _that_----"\r\n\r\nBut he was interrupted once more. Mrs Mortimer made her faint voice\r\nheard in a remonstrance. "Oh, Charles, I always told you--I had no right\r\nto anything!" cried the terrified widow; but that was not what stopped\r\nthe Archdeacon. It was because his adversary laughed that he stopped\r\nshort. No doubt it was the metallic laugh of a man in great agitation,\r\nbut still Mr Beverley\'s ear was not fine enough at that moment to\r\ndiscriminate. He paused as a man naturally pauses at the sound of\r\nridicule, still furious, yet abashed, and half conscious of a ludicrous\r\naspect to his passion--and turned his full face to his antagonist, and\r\nstood at bay.\r\n\r\n"It is a modest request, certainly," Mr Cavendish said. "Give up all I\r\nhave and all I am, and perhaps you will forgive me! You must think me a\r\nfool to make such a proposal; but look here," said the accused\r\nenergetically; "I will tell you the true state of affairs, if for once\r\nyou will listen. I do it, not for my sake, nor for your sake, but for\r\nthe sake of--of the women involved," he added hastily; and it was well\r\nfor him that, instead of looking at the shrinking widow beside him as he\r\nsaid so, his eye had been caught by the eager eye of his sister, who was\r\nwatching from her corner. With that stimulus he went on, calming himself\r\ndown, and somehow subduing and imposing upon the angry man by the mere\r\nact of encountering him fairly and openly. "I will tell you what are the\r\nactual circumstances, and you can see the will itself if you will take\r\nthe trouble," said the defendant, with a nervous moderation and\r\nself-restraint, in which there was also a certain thrill of indignation.\r\n"The old man you speak of might have left his money to a more worthy\r\nperson than myself, but he never meant to leave it to his grand-niece;\r\nand she knew that. She was neither his companion nor his nurse. There\r\nwas nothing between them but a few drops of blood. For my part, I gave\r\nhim----but, to be sure, it would not interest you to know how I spent my\r\nyouth. You came upon the scene like--a man in a passion," Mr Cavendish\r\nsaid, with an abrupt laugh, which this time was more feeble, and proved\r\nthat his composure was giving way, "and misjudged everything, as was\r\nnatural. You are doing the same again, or trying to do it. But you are a\r\nclergyman, and when you insult a man----"\r\n\r\n"I am ready to give him satisfaction," said the Broad-Churchman hotly;\r\nand then he made a pause, and that sense of ridicule which is latent in\r\nevery Englishman\'s mind, came to the Archdeacon\'s aid. He began to feel\r\nashamed of himself, and at the same time his eye caught his own\r\nreflection in a mirror, and the clerical coat which contrasted so\r\ngrotesquely with his offer of "satisfaction." Mr Beverley started a\r\nlittle, and changed his tone. "This has lasted long enough," he said, in\r\nhis abrupt imperious way. "_This_ is not the place nor the time for such\r\na discussion. We shall meet elsewhere," the Archdeacon added austerely,\r\nwith a significance which it is impossible to describe. His air and his\r\nwords were full of severe and hostile meaning, and yet he did not know\r\nwhat he meant any more than Mr Cavendish did, who took him at his word,\r\nand retired, and made an end of the interview. Whatever the Archdeacon\r\nmeant, it was his adversary who was the victor. _He_ went off, threading\r\nhis way through the curious spectators with a sense of relief that\r\nalmost went the length of ecstasy. He might have been walking on his\r\nhead for anything he knew. His senses were all lost and swallowed up in\r\nthe overwhelming and incredible consciousness of safety. Where were they\r\nto meet elsewhere? With pistols in a corner of Carlingford Common, or\r\nperhaps with their fists alone, as Mr Beverley was Broad-Church? When a\r\nman has been near ruin and has escaped by a hair-breadth, he may be\r\npermitted to be out of his wits for a few minutes afterwards. And the\r\nidea of fighting a duel with a dignitary of the Church so tickled Mr\r\nCavendish, that he had not the prudence to keep it to himself. "You will\r\nstand by me if he calls me out?" he said to General Travers as he\r\npassed; and the air of utter consternation with which the warrior\r\nregarded him, drove Mr Cavendish into such agonies of laughter, that he\r\nhad to retire to the landing-place and suffocate himself to subdue it.\r\nIf any man had said to him that he was hysterical, the chances are that\r\nit was he who would have called that man out, or at least knocked him\r\ndown. But he had to steal downstairs afterwards and apply to Thomas for\r\na cordial more potent than tea; for naturally, when a man has been\r\nhanging over an abyss for ever so long, it is no great wonder if he\r\nloses his head and balance when he suddenly finds himself standing on\r\nfirm ground, and feels that he has escaped.\r\n\r\nAs for the Archdeacon, when the other was gone, he sat down silently on\r\nhis abandoned chair. He was one of the men who take pride in seeing both\r\nsides of a question; and to tell the truth, he was always very candid\r\nabout disputed points in theology, and ready to entertain everybody\'s\r\nobjection; but it was a different thing when the matter was a matter of\r\nfact. He put down his face into his hands, and tried to think whether it\r\nwas possible that what he had just heard might be the true state of the\r\ncase. To be sure, the widow who was seated half fainting by his side had\r\ngiven him the same account often enough, but somehow it was more\r\neffective from the lips of a man who confronted him than from the mild\r\nand weeping woman whom he loved better than anything else in the world,\r\nbut whose opinion on any earthly (or heavenly) subject had not the\r\nweight of a straw upon him. He tried to take that view of it; and then\r\nit occurred to him that nothing was more ludicrous and miserable than\r\nthe position of a man who goes to law without adequate reason, or\r\nwithout proof to maintain his cause. Such a horrible divergence from\r\neverything that was just and right might be, as that the well-known and\r\nhighly-esteemed Archdeacon Beverley might be held up for the amusement\r\nand edification of the country in a _Times_ leader, which was a\r\nmartyrdom the Archdeacon would have rather liked than otherwise in a\r\nworthy cause, but not for a wretched private business connected with\r\nmoney. He sighed as he pondered, feeling, as so many have felt, the\r\ndifficulties which attend a good man\'s progress in this life--how that\r\nwhich is just is not always that which is expedient, and how the\r\nrighteous have to submit to many inconveniences in order that the\r\nadversary may have no occasion to blaspheme. In this state of mind a man\r\nnaturally softens towards a tender and wistful sympathiser close at\r\nhand. He sighed once more heavily, and lifted his head, and took into\r\nhis own a soft pale hand which was visible near him among the folds of\r\nblack silk.\r\n\r\n"So you too have been brought into it, Helen," the Archdeacon said\r\npathetically; "I did not expect to see you here."\r\n\r\n"It was Lucilla," said Mrs Mortimer timidly; "it was not any wish of\r\nmine. Oh, Charles! if you would let me speak. If you will but forget all\r\nthis, and think no more about it; and I will do my best to make you\r\na----" Here the poor woman stopped short all at once. What she meant to\r\nhave said was, that she would make him a good wife, which nature and\r\ntruth and the circumstances all prompted her to say--as the only\r\npossible solution to the puzzle. But when she had got so far, the poor\r\nwidow stopped, blushing and tingling all over, with a sense of shame,\r\nmore overwhelming than if she had done a wicked action. It was nothing\r\nbut pure honesty and affection that prompted her to speak; and yet, if\r\nit had been the vilest sentiment in human nature, she would not have\r\nbeen so utterly ashamed. "That was not what I meant to say!" she cried,\r\nwith sharp and sudden wretchedness; and was not the least ashamed of\r\ntelling a downright lie instead.\r\n\r\nBut, to tell the truth, the Archdeacon was paying no particular\r\nattention. He had never loved any other woman; but he was a little\r\nindifferent as to what innocent nonsense she might please to say. So\r\nthat her confusion and misery, and even the half offer of herself which\r\noccasioned these feelings, were lost upon him. He kept her hand and\r\ncaressed it in the midst of his own thoughts, as if it was a child\'s\r\nhead he was patting. "My poor Helen," he said, coming back to her when\r\nhe found she had stopped speaking, "I don\'t see why you should not\r\ncome, if this sort of thing is any pleasure to you; but afterwards----"\r\nhe said reflectively. He went to that sort of thing often himself, and\r\nrather liked it, and did not think of any afterwards; but perhaps the\r\ncase of a weak woman was different, or perhaps it was only that he\r\nhappened to be after his downfall in a pathetic and reflective state of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n"Afterwards?" said Mrs Mortimer. She did not take the word in any\r\nreligious or philosophical, but in its merest matter-of-fact meaning,\r\nand she was sadly hurt and wounded to see that he had not even noticed\r\nwhat she said, much as she had been ashamed of saying it. She drew away\r\nher hand with a quick movement of despite and mortification, which\r\nfilled Mr Beverley with surprise. "Afterwards I shall go back to my\r\nlittle house and my school, and shut myself in, and never, never come\r\nback again, you may be sure," said the widow, with a rush of tears to\r\nher eyes. Why they did not fall, or how she kept herself from\r\nfainting--she who fainted so easily--she never, on reviewing the\r\ncircumstances, could tell; and Miss Marjoribanks always attributed it to\r\nthe fact that _she_ was absent, and there was no eau-de-Cologne on the\r\ntable. But whatever the cause might be, Mrs Mortimer did not faint; and\r\nperhaps there never was anything so like despair and bitterness as at\r\nthat moment in her mild little feminine soul.\r\n\r\n"Never come back again?" said the Archdeacon, rousing up a little; and\r\nthen he put out his large hand and took back the other, as if it had\r\nbeen a pencil or a book that he had lost. All this, let it be known, was\r\nwell in the shadow, and could not be seen by the world in general to\r\nteach the young people a bad lesson. "Why should not you come back? I am\r\ngoing away too," said Mr Beverley; and he stopped short, and resisted\r\nthe effort his prisoner made to withdraw. Oddly enough at that moment\r\nhis Rectory rose suddenly before him as in a vision--his Rectory, all\r\nhandsome and sombre, without a soul in it, room after room uninhabited,\r\nand not a sound to be heard, except that of his own foot or his\r\nservant\'s. It was curious what connection there could be between that\r\nand the garden, with its four walls, and the tiny cottage covered with\r\nwistaria. Such as it was, it moved the Archdeacon to a singular, and,\r\nconsidering the place and moment, rather indecorous proceeding. Instead\r\nof contenting himself with the resisting hand, he drew the widow\'s arm\r\nwithin his as they sat together. "I\'ll tell you what we must do,\r\nHelen," he said confidentially--"we must go back to Basing together, you\r\nand I. I don\'t see the good of leaving you by yourself here. You can\r\nmake what alterations you like when you get to the Rectory; and I shall\r\nlet that--that person alone, if you wish it, with his ill-gotten gear.\r\nHe will never come to any good," said the Archdeacon, with some\r\nsatisfaction; and then he added in a parenthesis, as if she had\r\nexpressed some ridiculous doubt on the subject, "Of course I mean that\r\nwe should be married before we go away." It was in this rapid and\r\nsummary manner that the whole business was settled. Naturally his\r\ncompanion had nothing to say against such a reasonable arrangement. She\r\nhad never contradicted him in her life about anything but one thing; and\r\nthat being set aside, there was no possible reason why she should begin\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXXIV_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was how the crisis came to an end, which had been of so much\r\ninterest to the parties immediately affected. Mrs Woodburn had one of\r\nher nervous attacks next morning, and was very ill, and alarmed Dr\r\nMarjoribanks; but at her very worst moment the incorrigible mimic\r\nconvulsed her anxious medical adviser and all her attendants by a sudden\r\nadoption of the character of Mrs Mortimer, whom she must have made a\r\ncareful study of the previous night. "Tell him to tell him to go\r\ndownstairs," cried the half-dead patient; "I want to speak to him, and\r\nhe is not to hear;--if he were not so thoughtless, he would offer him\r\nsome lunch at least," Mrs Woodburn said pathetically, with closed eyes\r\nand a face as pale as death. "She never did anything better in her\r\nlife," Dr Marjoribanks said afterwards; and Mr Woodburn, who was fond of\r\nhis wife in his way, and had been crying over her, burst into such an\r\nexplosion of laughter that all the servants were scandalised. And the\r\npatient improved from that moment. She was perfectly well and in the\r\nfullest force a week afterwards, when she came to see Lucilla, who had\r\nalso been slightly indisposed for a day or two. When Thomas had shut the\r\ndoor, and the two were quite alone, Mrs Woodburn hugged Miss\r\nMarjoribanks with a fervour which up to that moment she had never\r\nexhibited. "It was only necessary that we should get into full sympathy\r\nwith each other as human creatures," she said, lifting her finger like\r\nthe Archdeacon; and for all the rest of that autumn and winter Mrs\r\nWoodburn kept society in Carlingford in a state of inextinguishable\r\nlaughter. The odd thing was that Miss Marjoribanks, who had been one of\r\nher favourite characters, disappeared almost entirely from her\r\nrepertory. Not quite altogether, because there were moments of supreme\r\ntemptation which the mimic could not resist; but as a general rule\r\nLucilla was the only woman in Carlingford who escaped the universal\r\ncritic. No sort of acknowledgment passed between them of the obligations\r\none had to the other, and, what was still more remarkable, no discussion\r\nof the terrible evening when Lucilla had held the Archdeacon with her\r\neye, and prevented the volcano from exploding. Perhaps Mrs Woodburn, for\r\nher part, would have been pleased to have had such an explanation, but\r\nMiss Marjoribanks knew better. She knew it was best not to enter upon\r\nconfidences which neither could ever forget, and which might prevent\r\nthem meeting with ease in the midst of the little world which knew\r\nnothing about it. What Lucilla knew, she knew, and could keep to\r\nherself; but she felt at the same time that it was best to have no\r\nexpansions on the subject. She kept it all to herself, and made the\r\narrangements for Mrs Mortimer\'s marriage, and took charge of everything.\r\nEverybody said that nothing could be more perfect than the bride\'s\r\ntoilette, which was as nice as could be, and yet not like a _real_ bride\r\nafter all; a difference which was only proper under the circumstances;\r\nfor she was married in lavender, poor soul, as was to be expected. "You\r\nhave not gone off the least bit in the world, and it is quite a pleasure\r\nto see you," Lucilla said, as she kissed her _that_ morning--and\r\nnaturally all Carlingford knew that it was owing to her goodness that\r\nthe widow had been taken care of and provided for, and saved up for the\r\nArchdeacon. Miss Marjoribanks, in short, presided over the ceremony as\r\nif she had been Mrs Mortimer\'s mother, and superintended the wedding\r\nbreakfast, and made herself agreeable to everybody. And in the meantime,\r\nbefore the marriage took place, most people in Carlingford availed\r\nthemselves of the opportunity of calling on Mrs Mortimer. "If she should\r\nhappen to be the future bishop\'s lady, and none of us ever to have\r\ntaken any notice of her," somebody said, with natural dismay. Lucilla\r\ndid not discourage the practical result of this suggestion, but she felt\r\nan instinctive certainty in her mind that _now_ Mr Beverley would never\r\nbe bishop of Carlingford, and indeed that the chances were Carlingford\r\nwould never be elevated into a bishopric at all.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the marriage that Mr Cavendish went away. To be\r\nsure, he was not absolutely present at the ceremony, but there can be no\r\ndoubt that the magnificent _parure_ which Mrs Mortimer received the\r\nevening before her marriage, "from an old friend," which made\r\neverybody\'s mouth water, and which she herself contemplated with mingled\r\nadmiration and dismay, was sent by Mr Cavendish. "Do you think it could\r\nbe from _him_; or only from him?" the bride said, bewildered and\r\nbewildering. "I am sure he might have known I never should require\r\nanything so splendid." But Lucilla, for her part, had no doubt whatever\r\non the subject; and the perfect good taste of the offering made Miss\r\nMarjoribanks sigh, thinking once more how much that was admirable was\r\nwasted by the fatal obstacle which prevented Mr Cavendish from aspiring\r\nto anybody higher than Barbara Lake. As for the Archdeacon, he too found\r\nit very easy to satisfy his mind as to the donor of the emeralds. He put\r\nthem away from him severely, and did not condescend to throw a second\r\nglance at their deceitful splendour. "Women are curiously constituted,"\r\nsaid Mr Beverley, who was still at the height of superiority, though he\r\nwas a bridegroom. "I suppose those sort of things give them\r\npleasure--things which neither satisfy the body nor delight the soul."\r\n\r\n"If it had been something to eat, would it have pleased you better?"\r\nsaid Lucilla, moved for once in her life to be impertinent, like an\r\nordinary girl. For really when a man showed himself so idiotic as to\r\ndespise a beautiful set of emeralds, it went beyond even the well-known\r\ntolerance and compassionate good-humour with which Miss Marjoribanks\r\nregarded the vagaries of "the gentlemen." There is a limit in all\r\nthings, and this was going too far.\r\n\r\n"I said, to satisfy the body, Miss Marjoribanks," said the Archdeacon,\r\n"which is an office very temporarily and inadequately performed by\r\nsomething to eat. I prefer the welfare of my fellow-creatures to a few\r\nglittering stones--even when they are round Her neck," Mr Beverley\r\nadded, with a little concession to the circumstances. "Jewellery is\r\nrobbery in a great town where there is always so much to be done, and so\r\nlittle means of doing it; to secure health to the people, and\r\neducation----"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Miss Marjoribanks, who knew in her heart that the Archdeacon\r\nwas afraid of her. "It is so nice of you not to say any of those\r\ndreadful sanitary words--and I am sure you could make something very\r\nnasty and disagreeable with that diamond of yours. It is a beautiful\r\ndiamond; if I were Helen I should make you give it me," said Lucilla\r\nsweetly; and the Archdeacon was so much frightened by the threat that he\r\nturned his ring instinctively, and quenched the glitter of the diamond\r\nin his closed hand.\r\n\r\n"It was a present," he said hastily, and went away to seek some better\r\noccupation than tilting with the womankind, who naturally had possession\r\nof the bride\'s little house and everything in it at that interesting\r\nmoment. It was the last evening of Lucilla\'s reign, and she was disposed\r\nto take the full good of it. And though Mrs Mortimer\'s trousseau was\r\nmodest, and not, as Lydia Brown repeated, like that of a _real_ bride,\r\nit was still voluminous enough to fill the room to overflowing, where it\r\nwas all being sorted and packed under Miss Marjoribanks\'s eye.\r\n\r\n"It is a very nice diamond indeed," said Lucilla; "if I were you I would\r\ncertainly make him give it to me--rings are no good to a gentleman. They\r\nnever have nice hands, you know--though indeed when they have nice\r\nhands," said Miss Marjoribanks reflectively, "it is a great deal worse,\r\nfor they keep always thrusting them under your very eyes. It is curious\r\nwhy They should be so vain. They talk of women!" Lucilla added, with\r\nnatural derision; "but, my dear, if I were you I would make him give it\r\nme; a nice diamond is always a nice thing to have."\r\n\r\n"Lucilla," said the widow, "I am sure I don\'t know how to thank you for\r\nall you have done for me; but, dear, if you please, I would not talk\r\nlike that! The gentlemen laugh, but I am sure they don\'t like it all the\r\nsame;" for indeed the bride thought it her duty, having won the prize in\r\nher own person, to point out to her young friend how, to attain the same\r\nend, she ought to behave.\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks did not laugh, for her sense of humour, as has been\r\nsaid, was not strong, but she kissed her friend with protecting\r\ntenderness. "My dear, if that had been what I was thinking of I need\r\nnever have come home," said Lucilla; and her superiority was so calm\r\nand serene, that Mrs Mortimer felt entirely ashamed of herself for\r\nmaking the suggestion. The widow was simple-minded, and, like most other\r\nwomen, it gratified her to believe that here and there, as in Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s case, there existed one who was utterly indifferent to\r\nthe gentlemen, and did not care whether they were pleased or not; which\r\nrestored a little the balance of the world to the widow-bride, who felt\r\nwith shame that she cared a great deal, and was quite incapable of such\r\nvirtue. As for Lucilla herself, she was not at that moment in conscious\r\nenjoyment of the strength of mind for which her friend gave her credit.\r\nOn the contrary, she could not help a certain sense of surprised\r\ndepression as she superintended the packing of the boxes. The man had\r\nhad it in his power to propose to her, and he was going to be married to\r\nMrs Mortimer! It was not that Lucilla was wounded or disappointed, but\r\nthat she felt it as a wonderful proof of the imperfection and weakness\r\nof human nature. Even in the nineteenth century, which has learnt so\r\nmuch, such a thing was possible! It filled her with a gentle sadness as\r\nshe had the things put in, and saw the emeralds safely deposited in\r\ntheir resting-place. Not that she cared for the Archdeacon, who had thus\r\ndisposed of himself; but still it was a curious fact that such a thing\r\ncould be.\r\n\r\nAltogether it must be admitted that at this special moment Miss\r\nMarjoribanks occupied a difficult position. She had given the Archdeacon\r\nto understand that Mr Cavendish was a "_very_ particular friend"; and\r\neven when the danger was past, Lucilla scorned to acknowledge her pious\r\nprevarications. During all this interval she continued so gracious to\r\nhim that everybody was puzzled, and Mrs Woodburn even insisted on her\r\nbrother, after all, making his proposal, which would be better late than\r\nnever.\r\n\r\n"I am sure she is fond of you," said the softened mimic, "and that sort\r\nof thing doesn\'t matter to a woman as it does to a man;" for it has been\r\nalready said that Mrs Woodburn, notwithstanding her knack of external\r\ndiscrimination, had very little real knowledge of character. And even at\r\nmoments, Mr Cavendish himself, who ought to have known better, was half\r\ntempted to believe that Lucilla meant it. The effect upon Dr\r\nMarjoribanks was still more decided. He thought he saw in his daughter\r\nthe indications of that weakness which is sometimes so surprising in\r\nwomen, and it disturbed the Doctor\'s serenity; and he actually tried to\r\nsnub Lucilla on sundry occasions, with that wonderful fatuity which is\r\ncommon to men.\r\n\r\n"I hope when this marriage is over people will recover their senses. I\r\nhear of nothing else," Dr Marjoribanks said one day at dessert, when\r\nthey were alone. He took some chestnuts as he spoke, and burned his\r\nfingers, which did not improve his temper. "That sort of rubbish, I\r\nsuppose, is much more interesting than attending to your natural\r\nduties," the Doctor added morosely, which was not a kind of address\r\nwhich Miss Marjoribanks was used to hear.\r\n\r\n"Dear papa," said Lucilla, "if I attended to my duties ever so much I\r\ncould not keep you from burning your fingers. There are some things that\r\npeople _must_ do for themselves," the dutiful daughter added, with a\r\nsigh. Nobody could doubt who knew Lucilla that she would have gladly\r\ntaken the world on her shoulders, and saved everybody from those little\r\nmisadventures; but how could she help it if people absolutely would not\r\ntake care of themselves?\r\n\r\nThe Doctor smiled grimly, but he was not satisfied. He was, on the\r\ncontrary, furious in a quiet way. "I don\'t need at this time of day to\r\nbe told how clever you are, Lucilla," said her father; "and I thought\r\nyou had been superior to the ordinary folly of women----"\r\n\r\n"Papa, for Heaven\'s sake!" cried Miss Marjoribanks. She was really\r\nalarmed this time, and she did not hesitate to let it be apparent. "I do\r\nnot mean to say that I always do precisely what I ought to do," said\r\nLucilla; "nobody does that I know of; but I am sure I never did anything\r\nto deserve _that_. I never was superior, and I hope I never shall be;\r\nand I know I never pretended to it," she said, with natural horror; for\r\nthe accusation, as everybody will perceive, was hard to bear.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor laughed again, but with increased severity. "We understand\r\nall that," he said. "I am not in the secret of your actions, Lucilla. I\r\ndon\'t know what you intend, or how far you mean to go. The only thing I\r\nknow is that I see that young fellow Cavendish a great deal oftener in\r\nthe house and about it than I care to see him; and I have had occasion\r\nto say the same thing before. I know nothing about his means," said Dr\r\nMarjoribanks; "his property may be in the Funds, but I think it a great\r\ndeal more likely that he speculates. I have worked hard for my money,\r\nand I don\'t mean it to go in that way, Lucilla. I repeat, I am not in\r\nthe secret of your proceedings----"\r\n\r\n"Dear papa! as if there was any secret," said Lucilla, fixing her candid\r\neyes upon her father\'s face. "I might pretend I did not understand you\r\nif there was anything in what you say, but I never go upon false\r\npretences when I can help it. I am very fond of Mr Cavendish," she\r\ncontinued regretfully, after a pause. "There is nobody in Carlingford\r\nthat is so nice; but I don\'t see whom he can marry except Barbara Lake."\r\nMiss Marjoribanks would have scorned to conceal the unfeigned regret\r\nwhich filled her mind when she uttered these words. "I am dreadfully\r\nsorry, but I don\'t see anything that can be done for him," she said, and\r\nsighed once more. As for the Doctor, he forgot all about his chestnuts,\r\nand sat and stared at her, thinking in his ignorance that it was a piece\r\nof acting, and not knowing whether to be angry or to yield to the\r\namusement which began to rise in his breast.\r\n\r\n"He may marry half a dozen Barbara Lakes," said Dr Marjoribanks, "and I\r\ndon\'t see what reason we should have to interfere: so long as he doesn\'t\r\nwant to marry you----"\r\n\r\n"That would be impossible, papa," said Lucilla, with pensive gravity. "I\r\nam sure I am very, very sorry. She has a very nice voice, but a man\r\ncan\'t marry a voice, you know; and if there was anything that I could\r\ndo----I am not sure that he ever wished for _that_ either," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks added, with her usual candour. "It is odd, but for all that\r\nit is true." For it was a moment of emotion, and she could not help\r\ngiving utterance to the surprise with which this consideration naturally\r\nfilled her mind.\r\n\r\n"What is odd, and what is true?" said Dr Marjoribanks, growing more and\r\nmore bewildered. But Lucilla only put aside her plate and got up from\r\nher chair.\r\n\r\n"Not any more wine, thank you," she said. "I know you don\'t want me any\r\nmore, and I have so much to do. I hope you will let me invite Barbara\r\nhere when they are married, and pay her a little attention; for nobody\r\nlikes her in Grange Lane, and it would be so hard upon _him_. The more I\r\nthink of it, the more sorry I am," said Lucilla; "he deserved better,\r\npapa; but as for me, everybody knows what is my object in life."\r\n\r\nThus Miss Marjoribanks left the table, leaving her father in a singular\r\nstate of satisfaction and surprise. He did not believe a word of what\r\nshe had been saying, with that curious perversity common to the people\r\nwho surrounded Lucilla, and which arose not so much from doubt of her\r\nveracity as from sheer excess of confidence in her powers. He thought\r\nshe had foiled him in a masterly manner, and that she was only, as\r\npeople say, amusing herself, and had no serious intentions; and he\r\nlaughed quietly to himself when she left him, in the satisfaction of\r\nfinding there was nothing in it. Miss Marjoribanks, for her part, went\r\non tranquilly with the arrangements for the marriage; one by one she was\r\ndisembarrassing herself from the complications which had grown round her\r\nduring the first year of her reign in Carlingford; and now only the last\r\nlinks of the difficulty remained to be unrolled.\r\n\r\nThe explanation she had with Mr Cavendish himself was in every way more\r\ninteresting. It happened pretty late one evening, when Lucilla was\r\nreturning with her maid from the widow\'s little cottage, which was so\r\nsoon to be deserted. She was just at that moment thinking of the\r\nwistaria which had grown so nicely, and of all the trouble she had taken\r\nwith the garden. Nobody could tell who might come into it now, after she\r\nhad done so much for it; and Miss Marjoribanks could not but have a\r\nmomentary sense that, on the whole, it was a little ungrateful on the\r\npart of Mrs Mortimer, when everybody had taken such pains to make her\r\ncomfortable. At this moment, indeed, Lucilla was slightly given to\r\nmoralising, though with her usual wisdom she kept her meditations to\r\nherself. She was thinking with a momentary vexation of all the plants\r\nthat had been put into the beds, and of so much time and trouble\r\nlost--when Mr Cavendish came up to her. It was a cold evening, and there\r\nwas nothing in common between this walk and the walk they had taken\r\ntogether from Grove Street to Grange Lane on an earlier occasion. But\r\nthis time, so far from being reluctant to accompany her, Mr Cavendish\r\ncame to her side eagerly. The maid retired a little behind, and then the\r\ntwo found themselves in that most perfect of all positions for mutual\r\nconfidence--a street not too crowded and noisy, all shrouded in the\r\ndarkness, and yet twinkling with the friendly lights of an autumn\r\nevening. Nothing could have been more perfect than their isolation from\r\nthe surrounding world, if they thought proper to isolate themselves; and\r\nyet it was always there to be taken refuge in if the confidence should\r\nreceive a check, or the mind of the chance companions change.\r\n\r\n"I have been trying to catch a glimpse of you for a long time," said Mr\r\nCavendish, after they had talked a little in the ordinary way, as\r\neverybody was doing in Grange Lane, about the two people henceforward to\r\nbe known in Carlingford as "the Beverleys." "But you are always so busy\r\nserving everybody. And I have a great deal to say to you that I don\'t\r\nknow how to say."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t say it, please," said Lucilla. "It is a great deal better\r\nnot. It might be funny, you know; but I am not disposed to be funny\r\nto-night. I am very glad about Mrs Mortimer, to be sure, that she is to\r\nbe settled so nicely, and that they are going to be married at last.\r\nBut, after all, when one thinks of it, it is a little vexatious. Just\r\nwhen her house was all put to rights, and the garden looking so pretty,\r\nand the school promising so well," said Lucilla; and there was a certain\r\naggrieved tone in her voice.\r\n\r\n"And it is you who have done everything for her, as for all the rest of\r\nus," said Mr Cavendish, though he could not help laughing a little; and\r\nthen he paused, and his voice softened in the darkness by Lucilla\'s\r\nside. "Do not let us talk of Mrs Mortimer," he said. "I sometimes have\r\nsomething just on my lips to say, and I do not know whether I dare say\r\nit. Miss Marjoribanks----"\r\n\r\nAnd here he came to a pause. He was fluttered and frightened, which was\r\nwhat she, and not he, ought to have been. And at the bottom of his heart\r\nhe did not wish to say it, which gave far more force to his hesitation\r\nthan simply a doubt whether he might dare. Perhaps Lucilla\'s heart\r\nfluttered too, with a sense that the moment which once would not have\r\nbeen an unwelcome moment, had at last arrived. Her heart, it is true,\r\nwas not _very_ particularly engaged; but still she was sensible of all\r\nMr Cavendish\'s capacities, and was "very fond" of him, as she said; and\r\nher exertions on his behalf had produced their natural effect, and moved\r\nher affections a little. She made an involuntary pause for the hundredth\r\npart of a minute, and reckoned it all up again, and asked herself\r\nwhether it were possible. There was something, in the first place,\r\nbecoming and suitable in the idea that she, who was the only person who\r\nknew his secret, should take him and it together and make the best of\r\nthem. And Lucilla had the consciousness that she could indeed make a\r\ngreat deal of Mr Cavendish. Nobody had ever crossed her path of whom so\r\nmuch could be made; and as for any further danger of his real origin and\r\nposition being found out and exposed to the world, Miss Marjoribanks was\r\ncapable of smiling at that when the defence would be in her own hands.\r\nShe might yet accept him, and have him elected member for Carlingford,\r\nand carry him triumphantly through all his difficulties. For a small\r\npart--nay, even for the half of a minute--Lucilla paused, and made a\r\nrapid review of the circumstances, and reconsidered her decision.\r\nPerhaps if Mr Cavendish had been really in earnest, that which was only\r\na vague possibility might have become, in another minute, a fact and\r\nreal. It was about the first time that her heart had found anything to\r\nsay in the matter; and the fact was that it actually fluttered in her\r\nreasonable bosom, and experienced a certain _malaise_ which was quite\r\nnew to her. Was it possible that she could be in love with Mr Cavendish?\r\nor was it merely the excitement of a final decision which made that\r\nunusual commotion far away down at the bottom of Lucilla\'s heart?\r\n\r\nHowever that might be, Miss Marjoribanks triumphed over her momentary\r\nweakness. She saw the possibility, and at the same moment she saw that\r\nit could not be; and while Mr Cavendish hesitated, she, who was always\r\nprompt and ready, made up her mind.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what I have done in particular, either for her or the rest\r\nof you," she said, ignoring the other part of her companion\'s faltering\r\naddress, "except to help to amuse you; but I am going to do something\r\nvery serious, and I hope you will show you are grateful, as you\r\nsay--though I don\'t know what you have to be grateful about--by paying\r\ngreat attention to me. Mr Cavendish, I am going to give you good\r\nadvice," said Lucilla; and, notwithstanding her courage, she too\r\nfaltered a little, and felt that it was rather a serious piece of\r\nbusiness that she had taken in hand.\r\n\r\n"Advice?" Mr Cavendish said, like an echo of her voice; but that was all\r\nhe found time to say.\r\n\r\n"We are such old friends, that I know you won\'t be vexed," said Lucilla;\r\n"and then we understand each other. It is so nice when two people\r\nunderstand each other; they can say quantities of things that strangers\r\ncannot say. Mr Cavendish, you and Barbara are in love," said Lucilla,\r\nmaking a slight pause, and looking in his face.\r\n\r\n"Miss Marjoribanks!" cried the assaulted man, in the extremity of his\r\namazement and horror. As for Lucilla, she came a little closer to him,\r\nand shook her head in a maternal, semi-reproving way.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say you are not," said Miss Marjoribanks; "you never could\r\ndeceive _me_--not in anything like that. I saw it almost as soon as you\r\nmet. They are not rich, you know, but they are very nice. Mr Lake and\r\nRose," said Lucilla, with admirable prudence, keeping off the difficult\r\nsubject of Barbara herself, "are the two very nicest people I know; and\r\neverybody says that Willie is dreadfully clever. I hope you will soon be\r\nmarried, and that you will be very happy," she continued, with an\r\neffort. It was a bold thing to say, and Lucilla\'s throat even contracted\r\na little, as if to prevent the words from getting utterance; but then\r\nshe was not a person, when she knew a thing was right, to hesitate about\r\ndoing it; and in Miss Marjoribanks\'s mind duty went before all, as has\r\nalready been on several occasions said.\r\n\r\nAfter this a horrible silence fell upon the two--a silence which, like\r\ndarkness, could be felt. The thunderbolt fell upon the victim\'s\r\nunprotected head without any warning. The idea that Lucilla would talk\r\nto him about Barbara Lake was the very last that could have entered Mr\r\nCavendish\'s mind. He was speechless with rage and mortification. He took\r\nit for an insult inflicted upon him in cold blood, doing Lucilla much\r\ninjustice as the other people who took the candid expression of her\r\nsentiments for a piece of acting. He was a gentleman, notwithstanding\r\nhis doubtful origin, and civilised down to his very finger-tips; but he\r\nwould have liked to have knocked Miss Marjoribanks down, though she was\r\na woman. And yet, as she was a woman, he dared not for his life make any\r\ndemonstration of his fury. He walked along by her side down into the\r\nrespectable solitude of Grange Lane, passing through a bright bit of\r\nGeorge Street, and seeing askance, by the light from the shop windows,\r\nhis adviser walking beside him, with the satisfaction of a good\r\nconscience in her face. This awful silence lasted until they reached Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s door.\r\n\r\n"Thank you for coming with me so far," said Lucilla, holding out her\r\nhand. "I suppose I must not ask you to come in, though papa would be\r\ndelighted to see you. I am afraid you are very angry with me," Miss\r\nMarjoribanks added, with a touch of pathos; "but you may be sure I would\r\nalways stand by _you_; and I said it because I thought it was for the\r\nbest."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I am much obliged to you," said Mr Cavendish, with\r\nquiet fury, "and deeply touched by the interest you take in my\r\nhappiness. You may be sure I shall always be grateful for it; and for\r\nthe offer of your support," said the ungrateful man, with the most\r\ntruculent meaning. As for Miss Marjoribanks, she pressed quite kindly\r\nthe hurried hand with which he touched hers, and went in, still saying,\r\n"Good-night." She had done her duty, whatever might come of it. He\r\nrushed home furious; but she went to a little worsted-work with a mind\r\nat peace with itself and all men. She was gentler than usual even to the\r\nmaids, who always found Miss Marjoribanks a good mistress--but she felt\r\na little sad in the solitude of her genius. For it is true that to be\r\nwiser and more enlightened than one\'s neighbours is in most cases a\r\nweariness to the flesh. She had made a sacrifice, and nobody appreciated\r\nit. Instead of choosing a position which pleased her imagination, and\r\nsuited her energies, and did not go against her heart, Lucilla, moved by\r\nthe wisest discretion, had decided, not without regret, to give it up.\r\nShe had sacrificed her own inclination, and a sphere in which her\r\nabilities would have had the fullest scope, to what she believed to be\r\nthe general good; and instead of having the heroism acknowledged, she\r\nwas misunderstood and rewarded with ingratitude. When Miss Marjoribanks\r\nfound herself alone in the solitude of her drawing-room, and in the\r\nstill greater solitude, as we have said, of her genius, she felt a\r\nlittle sad, as was natural. But at the same moment there came into\r\nLucilla\'s mind a name, a humble name, which has been often pronounced in\r\nthe pages of this history, and it gave her once more a certain\r\nconsolation. A sympathetic presence seemed to diffuse itself about her\r\nin her loneliness. There are moments when the faith of a very humble\r\nindividual may save a great soul from discouragement; and the\r\nconsciousness of being believed in once more came with the sweetest and\r\nmost salutary effect upon Lucilla\'s heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXXV_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the very day after the marriage, and two or three days after this\r\nconversation, that Mr Cavendish left Carlingford. He went to spend the\r\nwinter in Italy, which had long been "a dream" of his, as he explained\r\nto some of the young ladies--most of whom had the same "dream," without\r\nthe enviable power of carrying it out. He made very brief and formal\r\nadieux to Lucilla, to the extreme amazement of all the surrounding\r\nworld, and then disappeared, leaving--just at that moment after the\r\nexcitement of the marriage was over, when Grange Lane stood most in need\r\nof somebody to rouse its drooping spirits--a wonderful blank behind him.\r\nLucilla said much less about her feelings on this occasion than she was\r\nin the habit of doing, but there could be no doubt that she felt it, and\r\nfelt it acutely. And the worst of it was, that it was she who was\r\nuniversally blamed for the sudden and unexplained departure of the most\r\npopular man in Carlingford. Some people thought he had gone away to\r\nescape from the necessity of proposing to her; and some of more friendly\r\nand charitable disposition believed with Mrs Chiley that Lucilla had\r\nrefused him; and some, who were mostly outsiders and of a humble class,\r\nwere of opinion that Miss Marjoribanks had exercised all her influence\r\nto send Mr Cavendish out of the way of Barbara Lake. It was with this\r\nimpression that Rose made her way one of those foggy autumn mornings\r\nthrough the fallen leaves with which the garden was carpeted, to see if\r\nany explanation was to be got from Lucilla. The art-inspectors from\r\nMarlborough House had just paid their annual visit to Carlingford, and\r\nhad found the Female School of Design in a condition which, as they said\r\nin their report, "warranted the warmest encomiums," and Rose had also\r\nwon a prize for her veil in the exhibition at Kensington of ornamental\r\nart. These were triumphs which would have made the little artist\r\noverwhelmingly happy, if they had not been neutralised by other\r\ncircumstances; but as it was, they only aggravated the difficulties of\r\nthe position in which she found herself. She came to Lucilla in a\r\nbonnet--a circumstance which of itself was solemn and ominous; for\r\ngenerally that portentous article of dress, which was home-made, and did\r\nnot consist with cheerful dispositions, was reserved by Rose for going\r\nto church; and her soft cheeks were pale, and the hazel eyes more dewy\r\nthan usual, though it was rain, and not dew, that had been falling from\r\nthem during those last painful days.\r\n\r\n"I am ashamed to ask you such a question," said Rose; "but I want you to\r\ntell me, Lucilla, if you know why Mr Cavendish has gone away. She will\r\nnot come and ask you herself, or rather I would not let her come; for\r\nshe is so passionate, one does not know what she might do. You have\r\nbehaved a little strange, Lucilla," said the straightforward Rose. "If\r\nhe cared for her, and she cared for him, you had no right to come and\r\ntake him away."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I did not take him away," said Miss Marjoribanks. "I had to\r\ntalk to him about some--business; that was all. It is disgraceful of\r\nBarbara to bother you about it, who are only a baby and oughtn\'t to know\r\nanything----"\r\n\r\n"Lucilla!" cried Rose, with flashing eyes, "I am seventeen, and I will\r\nnot put up with it any longer. It is all your fault. What right had you\r\nto come and drag us to your great parties? We are not as rich as you,\r\nnor as fine, but we have a rank of our own," cried the little artist.\r\n"You have a great deal more money, but we have some things that money\r\ncannot buy. You made Barbara come and sing, and put things into her\r\nhead; and you made me come, though I did not want to. Why did you ask\r\n_us_ to your parties, Lucilla? It is all your fault!"\r\n\r\nLucilla was in a subdued state of mind, as may have been perceived, and\r\nanswered quite meekly. "I don\'t know why you should all turn against me\r\nlike this," she said, more sadly than surprised. "It is unkind of you to\r\nsay it was my fault. I did not expect it from you; and when I have so\r\nmany vexations----" Miss Marjoribanks added. She sat down as she spoke,\r\nafter being repulsed by Rose, with an air of depression which was quite\r\nunusual to her; for to be blamed and misunderstood on all sides was hard\r\nfor one who was always working in the service of her fellow-creatures,\r\nand doing everything for the best.\r\n\r\nAs for Rose, her heart smote her on the instant. "Have _you_ vexations,\r\nLucilla?" she said, in her innocence. It was the first time such an idea\r\nhad entered into her mind.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I have anything else," said Lucilla; though even as she\r\nsaid it she began to recover her spirits. "I do all I can for my\r\nfriends, and they are never pleased; and when anything goes wrong it is\r\nalways my fault."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps if you were not to do so much----" Rose began to say, for she\r\nwas in her way a wise little woman; but her heart smote her again, and\r\nshe restrained the truism, and then after a little pause she resumed her\r\nactual business. "I am ashamed to ask you, but do you know where Mr\r\nCavendish is, Lucilla?" said Rose. "She is breaking her heart because he\r\nhas gone away."\r\n\r\n"Did he never go to say good-bye nor anything?" asked Miss Marjoribanks.\r\nShe was sorry, for it was quite the contrary of the advice she had\r\ngiven, but still it would be wrong to deny that Mr Cavendish rose higher\r\nin Lucilla\'s opinion when she heard it. "I don\'t know any more than\r\neverybody knows. He has gone to Italy, but he will come back, and I\r\nsuppose she can wait," Miss Marjoribanks added, with perhaps a touch of\r\ncontempt. "For my part, I don\'t think she will break her heart."\r\n\r\n"It is because you do not know her," said Rose, with some\r\nindignation--for at seventeen a broken heart comes natural. "Oh,\r\nLucilla, it is dreadful, and I don\'t know what to do!" cried the little\r\nartist, changing her tone. "I am a selfish wretch, but I cannot help it.\r\nIt is as good as putting an end to my Career; and just after my design\r\nhas been so successful--and when papa was so proud--and when I thought I\r\nmight have been a help. It is dreadful to think of oneself when her\r\nheart is breaking; but I shall have to give up everything; and I--I\r\ncan\'t help feeling it, Lucilla," cried Rose, with a sudden outburst of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nAll this was sufficiently unintelligible to Miss Marjoribanks, who was\r\nnot the least in anxiety about Barbara\'s breaking heart. "Tell me what\r\nis the matter, and perhaps we can do something," said Lucilla,\r\nforgetting how little her past exertions had been appreciated; and Rose,\r\nwith equal inconsistency, dried her tears at the sound of Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s reassuring voice.\r\n\r\n"I know I am a wretch to be thinking of myself," she said. "She cannot\r\nbe expected to stay and sacrifice herself for us, after all she has\r\nsuffered. She has made up her mind and advertised in the _Times_, and\r\nnothing can change it now. She is going out for a governess, Lucilla."\r\n\r\n"Going for a--what?" said Miss Marjoribanks, who could not believe her\r\nears.\r\n\r\n"For a governess," said Rose calmly; for though she had been partly\r\nbrought up at Mount Pleasant, she had not the elevated idea of an\r\ninstructress of youth which might have been expected from a pupil of\r\nthat establishment. "She has advertised in the _Times_," Rose added,\r\nwith quiet despair, "with no objections to travel. I would do anything\r\nin the world for Barbara, but one can\'t help thinking of oneself\r\nsometimes, and there is an end of my Career." When she had said this she\r\nbrushed the last tear off her eyelashes, and sat straight up, a little\r\nmartyr and heroic victim to duty. "Her eye, though fixed on empty space,\r\nbeamed keen with honour"; but still there was a certain desperation in\r\nthe composure with which Rose regarded, after the first outburst, the\r\nabandonment of all her hopes.\r\n\r\n"She is a selfish thing," said Lucilla indignantly; "she always was a\r\nselfish thing. I should like to know what she can teach anybody? If I\r\nwere you and your papa, I certainly would not let her go away. I don\'t\r\nsee any reason in the world why you should give in to her and let her\r\nstop your--your Career, you know; why should you? I would not give in to\r\nher for one moment, if I were your papa and you."\r\n\r\n"Why should I?" said Rose; "because there is nobody else to do anything,\r\nLucilla. Fleda and Dreda are such two little things; and there are all\r\nthe boys to think of, and poor papa. It is of no use asking why. If I\r\ndon\'t do it, there will be nobody to do it," said Rose, with big tears\r\ncoming to her eyes. Her Career was dear to her heart, and those two\r\ntears welled up from the depths; but then there would be nobody else to\r\ndo it--a consideration which continually filters out the people who are\r\ngood for anything out of the muddy current of the ordinary world.\r\n\r\n"And your pretty drawings, and the veil, and the School of Design!"\r\ncried Lucilla. "You dear little Rose, don\'t cry. It never can be\r\npermitted, you know. She cannot teach anything, and nobody will have\r\nher. She is a selfish thing, though she is your sister; and if I were\r\nyour papa and you----"\r\n\r\n"It would be no good," said Rose. "She will go, whatever anybody may\r\nsay. _She_ does not care," said the little martyr, and the two big tears\r\nfell, making two big round blotches upon the strings of that bonnet\r\nwhich Lucilla had difficulty in keeping her hands off. But when she had\r\nthus expressed her feelings, Rose relented over her sister. "She has\r\nsuffered so much here; how can any one ask her to sacrifice herself to\r\nus?" said the young artist mournfully. "And I am quite happy," said\r\nRose--"quite happy; it makes all the difference. It is her _heart_, you\r\nknow, Lucilla; and it is only my Career."\r\n\r\nAnd this time the tears were dashed away by an indignant little hand.\r\nBarbara\'s heart, if she had such an organ, had never in its existence\r\ncost such bitter drops. But as for Lucilla, what could she do? She could\r\nonly repeat, "If I was your papa and you," with a melancholy sense that\r\nshe was here balked and could do no more. For even the aid of Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was as nothing against dead selfishness and folly, the two\r\nmost invincible forces in the world. Instead of taking the business into\r\nher own hands, and carrying it through triumphantly as she had hitherto\r\nbeen in the habit of doing, Lucilla could only minister to the sufferer,\r\nand keep up her courage, and mourn over the Career thus put in danger.\r\nBarbara\'s advertisement was in the newspapers, and her foolish mind was\r\nmade up; and the hope that nobody would have her was a forlorn hope, for\r\nsomebody always does have the incapable people, as Miss Marjoribanks was\r\nwell aware. And the contralto had been of some use in Grange Lane and a\r\nlittle in Grove Street, and it would be difficult, either in the one\r\nsphere or the other, to find any one to fill her place. It was thus amid\r\nuniversal demolition that Christmas approached, and Miss Marjoribanks\r\nended the first portion of her eventful career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXXVI_\r\n\r\n\r\nOne fytte of Lucilla\'s history is here ended, and another is to be told.\r\nWe have recorded her beginning in all the fulness of youthful confidence\r\nand undaunted trust in her own resources; and have done our best to show\r\nthat in the course of organising society Miss Marjoribanks, like all\r\nother benefactors of their kind, had many sacrifices to make, and had to\r\nundergo the mortification of finding out that many of her most able\r\nefforts turned to other people\'s profit and went directly against\r\nherself. She began the second period of her career with, to some certain\r\nextent, that sense of failure which is inevitable to every high\r\nintelligence after a little intercourse with the world. She had\r\nsucceeded in a great many things, but yet she had not succeeded in all;\r\nand she had found out that the most powerful exertions in behalf of\r\nfriends not only fail to procure their gratitude, but sometimes convert\r\nthem into enemies, and do actual harm; which is a discovery which can\r\nonly be made by those who devote themselves, as Miss Marjoribanks had\r\ndone, to the good of the human species. She had done everything for the\r\nbest, and yet it had not always turned out for the best; and even the\r\npeople who had been most ready to appeal to her for assistance in their\r\nneed, had proved the readiest to accuse her when something disagreeable\r\nhappened, and to say "It was your fault." In the second stage of her\r\nprogress Miss Marjoribanks found herself, with a great responsibility\r\nupon her shoulders, with nearly the entire social organisation of\r\nCarlingford depending upon her; and, at the same time, with her means of\r\nproviding for the wants of her subjects sensibly diminished, and her\r\nconfidence in the resources of the future impaired to an equal degree.\r\nOne thing was sure, that she had taken the work upon her shoulders, and\r\nthat she was not the woman to draw back, whatever the difficulties might\r\nbe. She did not bate a jot of her courage, though the early buoyancy of\r\nhope had departed, never to return. It is true that she was not so\r\njoyful and triumphant a figure as when she conquered Nancy, and won over\r\nDr Marjoribanks, and electrified Mr Holden by choosing curtains which\r\nsuited her complexion; but with her diminished hopes and increased\r\nexperience and unabated courage, no doubt Miss Marjoribanks presented a\r\nstill nobler and more imposing aspect to everybody who had an eye for\r\nmoral grandeur, though it would be difficult to tell how many of such\r\nworthy spectators existed in Grange Lane.\r\n\r\nThere was, as our readers are aware, another subject also on which\r\nLucilla had found her position altered. It was quite true that, had she\r\nbeen thinking of _that_, she never need have come home at all; and that,\r\nin accepting new furniture for the drawing-room, she had to a certain\r\nextent pledged herself not to marry immediately, but to stay at home and\r\nbe a comfort to her dear papa. This is so delicate a question that it is\r\ndifficult to treat it with the freedom necessary for a full development\r\nof a not unusual state of mind. Most people are capable of falling in\r\nlove only once or twice, or at the most a very few times, in their life;\r\nand disappointed and heartbroken suitors are not so commonly to be met\r\nwith as perhaps could be wished. But at the same time, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that the chief way in which society is supposed to signify\r\nits approval and admiration and enthusiasm for a lady, is by making\r\ndozens of proposals to her, as may be ascertained from all the\r\nbest-informed sources. When a woman is a great beauty, or is very\r\nbrilliant and graceful, or even is only agreeable and amusing, the\r\nordinary idea is that the floating men of society, in number less or\r\nmore according to the lady\'s merits, propose to her, though she may not\r\nperhaps accept any of them. In proportion as her qualities rise towards\r\nthe sublime, these victims are supposed to increase; and perhaps, to\r\ntell the truth, no woman feels herself set at her true value until some\r\npoor man, or set of men, have put, as people say, their happiness into\r\nher hands. It is, as we have said, a delicate subject to discuss; for\r\nthe truth is, that this well-known and thoroughly established reward of\r\nfemale excellence had not fallen to Miss Marjoribanks\'s lot. There was\r\nTom, to be sure, but Tom did not count. And as for the other men who had\r\nbeen presented to Lucilla as eligible candidates for her regard, none of\r\nthem had given her this proof of their admiration. The year had passed\r\naway, and society had laid no tribute of this description upon Lucilla\'s\r\nshrine. The Archdeacon had married Mrs Mortimer instead, and Mr\r\nCavendish had been led away by Barbara Lake! After such an experience\r\nnothing but the inherent sweetness and wholesome tone of Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s character could have kept her from that cynicism and\r\ndisbelief in humanity which is so often the result of knowledge of the\r\nworld. As for Lucilla, she smiled as she thought of it, not cynically,\r\nbut with a sweetly melancholy smile. What she said to herself was, Poor\r\nmen! they had had the two ways set before them, and they had not chosen\r\nthe best. It made her sad to have this proof of the imperfection of\r\nhuman nature thrust upon her, but it did not turn her sweet into bitter,\r\nas might have been the case with a more ordinary mind. Notwithstanding\r\nthat this universal reward, which in other cases is, as everybody knows,\r\ngiven so indiscriminately, and with such liberality, had altogether\r\nfailed in her case, Lucilla still resumed her way with a beautiful\r\nconstancy, and went forward in the face of fate undaunted and with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that she began the second period of her career. Up to this\r\nmoment there had never been a time in which it was not said in\r\nCarlingford that some one was paying attention to Miss Marjoribanks; but\r\nat present no one was paying attention to her. There were other\r\nmarriages going on around her, and other preliminaries of marriage, but\r\nnobody had proposed to Lucilla. Affairs were in this state when she took\r\nup her burden again boldly, and set out anew upon her way. It was a\r\nproof of magnanimity and philanthropy which nobody could have asked from\r\nher, if Lucilla had not been actuated by higher motives than those that\r\nsway the common crowd. Without any assistance but that of her own\r\ngenius--without the stimulating applause of admirers, such as a woman in\r\nsuch circumstances has a right to calculate upon--with no sympathising\r\nsoul to fall back upon, and nothing but a dull level of ordinary people\r\nbefore her,--Miss Marjoribanks, undaunted, put on her harness and\r\nresumed her course. The difficulties she had met only made her more\r\nfriendly, more tender, to those who were weaker than herself, and whom\r\nevil fortune had disabled in the way. When Barbara Lake got her\r\nsituation, and went out for a governess, and Rose\'s fears were realised,\r\nand she had with bitter tears to relinquish her Career, Lucilla went and\r\nsat whole afternoons with the little artist, and gave her the handiest\r\nassistance, and taught her a great many things which she never could\r\nhave learned at the School of Design. And the effect of this\r\nself-abnegation was, that Lucilla bore General Travers\'s decision, and\r\ngave up all hope of the officers, with a stout-heartedness which nobody\r\ncould have looked for, and did not hesitate to face her position\r\nboldly, and to erect her standard, and to begin her new campaign,\r\nunaided and unappreciated as she was. People who know no better may go\r\naway upon marriage tours, or they may fly off to foreign travel, or go\r\nout as governesses, when all things do not go just as they wish. But as\r\nfor Miss Marjoribanks, she stood bravely at her post, and scorned to\r\nflinch or run away. Thus commenced, amid mists of discouragement, and in\r\nan entire absence of all that was calculated to stimulate and\r\nexhilarate, the second grand period of Lucilla\'s life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXXVII_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be vain to follow Lucilla in detail through her consistent and\r\nadmirable career; nor is it necessary to say that she went on steadily\r\nin face of all her discouragements, with that mixture of success and\r\nfailure which comes natural to all human affairs. The singular thing\r\nabout it was, that the years passed on, and that she was permitted by\r\nthe world in general to fulfil her own promise and prophecy about\r\nremaining ten years at home to be a comfort to her dear papa. She had\r\nbeen nineteen when she began her career, and she was nine-and twenty\r\nwhen that little episode occurred with young Dr Rider, before he was\r\nmarried to his present wife. There would have been nothing in the least\r\nunsuitable in a marriage between Dr Rider and Miss Marjoribanks, though\r\npeople who were the best informed never thought either of them had any\r\nserious meaning; but, of course, the general public, having had Lucilla\r\nfor a long time before their eyes, naturally added on seven or eight\r\nyears to her age, and concluded her to be a great deal older than the\r\nyoung doctor, though everybody allowed that it would have been a most\r\nadvantageous match for him in every possible point of view. But,\r\nhowever, it did not come to anything, no more than a great many other\r\nnibbles of the same kind did. The period arrived at which Lucilla had\r\nthought she might perhaps have begun to go off in her looks, but still\r\nthere was no immediate appearance of any change of name or condition on\r\nher part. Many people quite congratulated themselves on the fact, as it\r\nwas impossible to imagine what might be the social condition of Grange\r\nLane without Miss Marjoribanks; but it is doubtful whether Lucilla\r\ncongratulated herself. She was very comfortable, no doubt, in every way,\r\nand met with little opposition to speak of, and had things a great deal\r\nmore in her own hands than she might have had, had there been a husband\r\nin the case to satisfy; but notwithstanding, she had come to an age when\r\nmost people have husbands, and when an independent position in the world\r\nbecomes necessary to self-respect. To be sure, Lucilla _was_\r\nindependent; but then--there is a difference, as everybody knows.\r\n\r\nAnd Miss Marjoribanks could not but feel that the world had not shown\r\nthat appreciation of her, to which, in her earlier days, she looked\r\nforward with so little fear. The ten years, as they had really gone by,\r\nwere very different from the ten years she had looked forward to, when,\r\nin the triumph of her youth, she named that period as the time when she\r\nmight probably begin to go off, and would be disposed to marry. By this\r\ntime the drawing-room carpets and curtains had faded a little, and\r\nLucilla had found out that the delicate pale green which suited her\r\ncomplexion was not to call a profitable colour; and nobody could have\r\nthought or said that to marry at this period would be in the least\r\ndegree to swindle the Doctor. Thus the moment had arrived to which she\r\nlooked forward, but the man had not arrived with it. Ten years had\r\npassed, during which she had been at the head of society in Grange Lane,\r\nand a great comfort to her dear papa; and now, if there remained another\r\ndevelopment for Lucilla\'s character, it was about time that it should\r\nbegin to show itself. But at the same time, the main element necessary\r\nfor that new development did not seem at present likely to be found in\r\nGrange Lane.\r\n\r\nUnless, indeed, it might happen to be found in the person of Mr\r\nAshburton, who was so often in Carlingford that he might be said to form\r\na part of society there. It was he who was related to the Richmonds, who\r\nwere a family much respected in the county. He had been at the bar, and\r\neven begun to distinguish himself, before old Miss Penrhyn died and left\r\nhim the Firs. He had begun to distinguish himself, but he had not, it\r\nappeared, gone so far as to prevent him from coming down to his new\r\nproperty and settling upon it, and taking his place as a local\r\nnotability. He was not a man who could be expected to care for evening\r\nparties in a provincial town; but he never refused to dine with Dr\r\nMarjoribanks, and was generally popular upstairs, where he always paid a\r\nlittle attention to Lucilla, though nothing very marked and noticeable.\r\nMr Ashburton was not like Mr Cavendish, for instance (if anybody\r\nremembered Mr Cavendish), a man whose money might be in the Funds, but\r\nwho more probably speculated. Everybody knew everything about him, which\r\nwas an ease to the public mind. The Firs was as well known as\r\nCarlingford steeple, and how much it was worth a year, and everything\r\nabout it; and so was the proprietor\'s pedigree, which could be traced to\r\na semi-mythical personage known as old Penrhyn, whose daughter was Sir\r\nJohn Richmond\'s grandmother. The Firs, it is true, had descended in the\r\nfemale line, but still it is something to know where a man comes from,\r\neven on one side.\r\n\r\nMr Ashburton made himself very agreeable in the neighbourhood, and was\r\nnever above enlightening anybody on a point of law. He used to say that\r\nit was kind to give him something to do, which was an opinion endorsed\r\npractically by a great many people. It is true that some of his\r\nneighbours wondered much to see his patience, and could not make out why\r\nhe chose to rusticate at the Firs at his age, and with his abilities.\r\nBut either he never heard these wonderings, or at least he never took\r\nany notice of them. He lived as if he liked it, and settled down, and\r\npresented to all men an aspect of serene contentment with his sphere.\r\nAnd it would be difficult to say what suggestion or association it was\r\nwhich brought him all of a sudden into Miss Marjoribanks\'s head, one\r\nday, when, seeing a little commotion in Masters\'s shop, she went in to\r\nhear what it was about. The cause of the commotion was an event which\r\nhad been long expected, and which, indeed, ten years before, had been\r\nlooked on as a possible thing to happen any day. The wonder was, not\r\nthat old Mr Chiltern should die, but that he should have lived so long.\r\nThe ladies in Masters\'s cried, "Poor dear old man!" and said to each\r\nother that however long it might have been expected, a death always\r\nseemed sudden at the last. But, to tell the truth, the stir made by this\r\ndeath was rather pleasant than sad. People thought, not of the career\r\nwhich was ended, but of the one which must now begin, and of the\r\nexcitement of an election, which was agreeable to look forward to. As\r\nfor Lucilla, when she too had heard the news, and had gone upon her way,\r\nit would be vain to assert that a regretful recollection of the time\r\nwhen Mr Cavendish was thought a likely man to succeed Mr Chiltern did\r\nnot occur to her. But when Miss Marjoribanks had dismissed that\r\ntransitory thought, Mr Ashburton suddenly came into her head by one of\r\nthose intuitions which have such an effect upon the mind that receives\r\nthem. Lucilla was not of very marked political opinions, and perhaps was\r\nnot quite aware what Mr Ashburton\'s views were on the Irish Church\r\nquestion, or upon parliamentary reform; but she said after, that it came\r\ninto her mind in a moment, like a flash of lightning, that he was the\r\nman. The idea was so new and so striking, that she turned back and went,\r\nin the excitement of the moment, to suggest it to Mrs Chiley, and see\r\nwhat her old friend and the Colonel would say. Of course, if such a\r\nthing was practicable, there was no time to lose. She turned round\r\nquickly, according to her prompt nature; and such was her absorbed\r\ninterest in the idea of Mr Ashburton, that she did not know until she\r\nhad almost done it, that she was walking straight into her hero\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Ashburton!" said Lucilla, with a little scream, "is it you? My\r\nmind was quite full of you. I could not see you for thinking. Do come\r\nback with me, for I have something very particular to say----"\r\n\r\n"To me?" said Mr Ashburton, looking at her with a smile and a sudden\r\nlook of interest; for it is always slightly exciting to the most\r\nphilosophical mortal to know that somebody else\'s mind is full of him.\r\n"What you have said already is so flattering----"\r\n\r\n"I did not mean anything absurd," said Miss Marjoribanks. "Don\'t talk\r\nany nonsense, please. Mr Ashburton, do you know that old Mr Chiltern is\r\ndead?"\r\n\r\nLucilla put the question solemnly, and her companion grew a little red\r\nas he looked at her. "It is not my fault," he said, though he still\r\nsmiled; and then he grew redder and redder, though he ought to have been\r\nabove showing such signs of emotion; and looked at her curiously, as if\r\nhe would seize what she was going to say out of her eyes or her lips\r\nbefore it was said.\r\n\r\n"It is not anything to laugh about," said Lucilla. "He was a very nice\r\nold man; but he is dead, and somebody else must be Member for\r\nCarlingford: that was why I told you that my mind was full of you. I am\r\nnot in the least superstitious," said Miss Marjoribanks, solemnly; "but\r\nwhen I stood there--there, just in front of Mr Holden\'s--you came into\r\nmy mind like a flash of lightning. I was not thinking of you in the\r\nleast, and you came into my mind like--like Minerva, you know. If it was\r\nnot an intimation, I don\'t know what it was. And that was why I ran\r\nagainst you, and did not see you were there. Mr Ashburton, it is you who\r\nmust be the man," said Lucilla. It was not a thing to speak lightly\r\nabout, and for her part she spoke very solemnly; and as for Mr\r\nAshburton, his face flushed deeper and deeper. He stood quite still in\r\nthe excitement of the moment, as if she had given him a blow.\r\n\r\n"Miss Marjoribanks, I don\'t know how to answer you," he cried; and then\r\nhe put out his hand in an agitated way and grasped her hand. "You are\r\nthe only creature in Carlingford, man or woman, that has divined me," he\r\nsaid, in a trembling voice. It was a little public at the top of Grange\r\nLane, where people were liable to pass at every moment; but still Miss\r\nMarjoribanks accepted the pressure of the hand, which, to be sure, had\r\nnothing whatever to do with love-making. She was more shy of such\r\ndemonstrations than she had been in her confident youth, knowing that in\r\nmost cases they never came to anything, and at the same time that the\r\nspectators kept a vivid recollection of them; but still, in the\r\nexcitement of the moment, Miss Marjoribanks accepted and returned in a\r\nwomanly way the pressure of Mr Ashburton\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Come in and let us talk it over," Lucilla said, feeling that no time\r\nwas to be lost. It was a conference very different from that which, had\r\nMr Chiltern been so well advised as to die ten years before, might have\r\nbeen held in Dr Marjoribanks\'s drawing-room over his successor\'s\r\nprospects; but at the same time there was something satisfactory to the\r\npersonal sentiments of both in the way in which this conversation had\r\ncome about. When Lucilla took off her hat and sat down to give him all\r\nher attention, Mr Ashburton could not but feel the flattering character\r\nof the interest she was taking in him. She was a woman, and young\r\n(comparatively speaking), and was by no means without admirers, and\r\nunquestionably took the lead in society; and to be divined by such a\r\nperson was perhaps, on the whole, sweeter to the heart of the aspirant\r\nthan if Colonel Chiley had found out his secret, or Dr Marjoribanks, or\r\neven the Rector: and Lucilla for her part had all that natural pleasure\r\nin being the first to embrace a new interest which was natural under the\r\ncircumstances. "Let us talk it all over," she said, giving Mr Ashburton\r\na chair near her own. "If I believed in spirit-rapping, you know, I\r\nshould be sure that was what it meant. I was not thinking of you in the\r\nleast, and all at once, like a flash of lightning--Mr Ashburton sit down\r\nand tell me--what is the first thing that must be done?"\r\n\r\n"If I could ask you to be on my committee, that would be the first thing\r\nto be done," said Mr Ashburton, "but unfortunately I can\'t do that. Let\r\nme tell you in the first place how very much I am obliged----"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that, please," said Miss Marjoribanks, with her usual good\r\nsense, "for I have done nothing. But papa can be on the committee, and\r\nold Colonel Chiley, who is such a one for politics; and of course Sir\r\nJohn--that will be a very good beginning; and after that----"\r\n\r\n"My dear Miss Marjoribanks," Mr Ashburton said, with a smile, and a\r\nlittle hesitation, "Sir John takes exactly the other side in politics;\r\nand I am afraid the Doctor and the Colonel are not of the same way of\r\nthinking; and then my opinions----"\r\n\r\n"If they are not of the same way of thinking we must make them," said\r\nLucilla: "after having such an intimation, I am not going to be put off\r\nfor a trifle; and besides, what does it matter about opinions? I am sure\r\nI have heard you all saying over and over that the thing was to have a\r\ngood _man_. Don\'t go and make speeches about opinions. If you begin with\r\nthat, there is no end to it," said Miss Marjoribanks. "I know what you\r\ngentlemen are. But if you just say distinctly that you are the best\r\nman----"\r\n\r\n"It would be an odd thing to say for oneself," said Mr Ashburton,\r\nand he laughed; but, to tell the truth, he was not a man of very\r\nquick understanding, and at the first outset of the thing he\r\ndid not understand Lucilla; and he was a little--just a very\r\nlittle--disappointed. She had divined him, which was a wonderful proof\r\nof her genius; but yet at the bottom she was only an ignorant woman\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\n"I see it all quite clear what to do," said Miss Marjoribanks. "You must\r\nhave the Colonel and Sir John, and everybody. I would not pay the least\r\nattention to Tories or Whigs, or anything of the sort. For my part I\r\ndon\'t see any difference. All that has to be said about it is simply\r\nthat you are the right man. Papa might object to one thing and the\r\nColonel might object to another, and then if Sir John, as you say, is of\r\nquite another way of thinking----But you are the man for Carlingford\r\nall the same; and none of them can say a word against that," said\r\nLucilla, with energy. She stopped short, with her colour rising and her\r\neyes brightening. She felt herself inspired, which was a new sensation,\r\nand very pleasant; and then the idea of such a coming struggle was sweet\r\nto Miss Marjoribanks, and the conviction burst upon her that she was\r\nstriking out a perfectly new and original line.\r\n\r\nAs for her candidate, he smiled, and hesitated, and paid her pretty\r\nlittle compliments for a few minutes longer, and said it was very good\r\nof her to interest herself in his fortunes. All which Lucilla listened\r\nto with great impatience, feeling that it had nothing to do with the\r\nmatter in hand. But then after these few minutes had elapsed the meaning\r\nof his fair adviser, as he called her, began to dawn upon Mr Ashburton\'s\r\nmind. He began to prick up his mental ears, so to speak, and see that it\r\nwas not womanish ignorance, but an actual suggestion. For, after all, so\r\nlong as he was the Man for Carlingford, all the rest was of little\r\nimportance. He took something out of his pocket, which was his address\r\nto the constituency of Carlingford (for being anxious on the subject, he\r\nhad heard of Mr Chiltern\'s death an hour or two before anybody else),\r\nand choke-full of political sentiments. In it he described to the\r\nelectors what he would do if they sent him to Parliament, as carefully\r\nas if their election could make him Prime Minister at least; and\r\nnaturally a man does not like to sacrifice such a confession of faith.\r\n"I should like to read it to you," he said, spreading it out with\r\naffectionate care: but Lucilla had already arranged her plans, and knew\r\nbetter than that.\r\n\r\n"If you were to read it to me," said Miss Marjoribanks, "I should be\r\nsure to be convinced that you were quite right, and to go in with you\r\nfor everything; and then I should be no good, you know. If it were to\r\ndrive papa and Sir John and the Colonel all to their own ways of\r\nthinking, we never should make any progress. I would never mind about\r\nanybody\'s ways of thinking, if I were you. After all," said Lucilla,\r\nwith fine satire, of which she was unconscious, "what does it matter\r\nwhat people think? I suppose when it comes to doing anything, the Whigs\r\nand the Tories are just the same. Mr Ashburton, it is the Man that is\r\nwanted," said Miss Marjoribanks, with all the warmth of sudden\r\nconviction. She felt a little like Joan of Arc as she spoke. When an\r\narmy has the aid of a sacred maiden to bring inspiration to its\r\ncounsels, the idea of going on in the old formal way is no longer to be\r\ntolerated. And such was the force of Lucilla\'s conviction, that Mr\r\nAshburton, though he felt a little affronted, and could not but look\r\nwith fond and compunctious regret upon his address, yet began more and\r\nmore to feel that there was justice in what she said.\r\n\r\n"I will think over what you say," he said, rather stiffly, and put up\r\nhis address--for it was natural, when he had done her such an honour as\r\nto offer to read it to her, that he should be affronted by her refusal.\r\nIt was a bold experiment on Lucilla\'s part, but then she was carried out\r\nof herself at the moment by this singular flash of inspiration. "I will\r\nthink over what you say," Mr Ashburton continued; "and if my judgment\r\napproves----At all events I shall not issue _this_ till I have thought\r\nit all over. I am sure I am extremely obliged to you for your interest."\r\nAnd here he stopped short, and looked as if he were going to get up and\r\ngo away, which would have spoiled all.\r\n\r\n"You are going to stop to lunch," said Lucilla; "somebody is sure to\r\ncome in. And you know you must not lose any opportunity of seeing\r\npeople. I am so glad to-night is Thursday. Tell me just one thing, Mr\r\nAshburton, before any one comes. There is one thing that is really\r\nimportant, and must be fixed upon. If we were to make any mistake, you\r\nknow----"\r\n\r\n"What?" said the candidate eagerly--"about Reform? I have expressed\r\nmyself very clearly----"\r\n\r\nLucilla smiled compassionately, and with the gentlest tolerance, at this\r\nwild suggestion. "I was not thinking of Reform," she said, with that\r\nmeekness which people assume when it is of no use being impatient. "I\r\nwas thinking what your colours were to be. I would not have anything to\r\ndo with the old colours, for my part--they would be as bad as opinions,\r\nyou know. You may laugh, but I am quite in earnest," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. As for Mr Ashburton, he did not begin to laugh until he\r\nhad fixed upon her that gaze of utter amazement and doubt with which on\r\nmany similar occasions ordinary people had regarded Lucilla--thinking\r\nshe was joking, or acting, or doing something quite different from the\r\nsevere sincerity which was her leading principle. She was so used to it,\r\nthat she waited with perfect patience till her companion\'s explosion of\r\namusement was over. He was thinking to himself what a fool she was, or\r\nwhat a fool he was to think of taking a woman into his counsels, or what\r\ncurious unintelligible creatures women were, made up of sense and folly;\r\nand all the time he laughed, which was a relief to his feelings. Miss\r\nMarjoribanks laughed a little too, to keep him in countenance, for she\r\nwas always the soul of good nature; and then she repeated, "Now you must\r\ntell me what our colours are to be----"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I don\'t know anything about colours," said the candidate,\r\n"any more than you do about opinions. I think they are equally\r\nunimportant, to say the least. I shall adopt the colours of my fair\r\ncounsellor," Mr Ashburton added, laughing, and making a mock bow to her,\r\nand getting his hat as he did so--for he had naturally calmed down a\r\nlittle from the first enthusiasm with which he had hailed the woman who\r\ndivined him, and he did not mean to stay.\r\n\r\n"Blue and yellow are the old colours," said Lucilla thoughtfully, "and\r\nyou are the new man, you know, and we must not meddle with these\r\nantiquated things. Do you think this would do?" As she spoke she took up\r\na handful of ribbons which were lying by, and put them up to her face\r\nwith an air of serious deliberation which once more disturbed Mr\r\nAshburton\'s gravity. And yet, when a young woman who is not at all\r\nbad-looking puts up a rustling, gleaming knot of ribbons to her hair and\r\nasks a man\'s opinion of the same, the man must be a philosopher or a\r\nwretch indeed who does not give a glance to see the effect. The\r\ncandidate for Carlingford looked and approached, and even, in the\r\ntemptation of the moment, took some of the long streamers in his hand.\r\nAnd he began to think Miss Marjoribanks was very clever, and the most\r\namusing companion he had met with for a long time. And her interest in\r\nhim touched his heart; and, after all, it is no drawback to a woman to\r\nbe absurd by moments. His voice grew quite soft and caressing as he took\r\nthe end of ribbon into his hand.\r\n\r\n"If they are your colours they shall be mine," he said, with a sense of\r\npatronage and protection which was very delightful; and the two were\r\nstill talking and laughing over the silken link thus formed between\r\nthem, when the people came in whom Lucilla was expecting to lunch, and\r\nwho were naturally full of Mr Chiltern\'s death, which, poor old man! was\r\nso sudden at the last. Mr Ashburton stayed, though he had not intended\r\nit, and made himself very pleasant. And Lucilla took no pains to\r\nconceal her opinion that the thing was neither to consider Whigs nor\r\nTories, but a good _Man_. And Major Brown, who had come with his\r\ndaughters, echoed this sentiment so warmly that Mr Ashburton was\r\nentirely convinced of the justice of Miss Marjoribanks\'s ideas. "We\r\ncan\'t have a tip-topper, you know," Major Brown said, who was not very\r\nrefined in his expressions; "and what I should like to see is a man that\r\nknows the place and would look after Carlingford. That\'s what we\'re all\r\nlooking for." Mr Ashburton did not declare himself to Major Brown, but\r\nhe dashed off his new address ten minutes after he had taken leave of\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, and put the other one in the fire like a Christian,\r\nand telegraphed for his agent to town. Lucilla, for her part, made an\r\neffort equally great and uncompromising. She took the ribbon Mr\r\nAshburton had played with, and cut it up into cockades of all\r\ndescriptions. It was an early moment, but still there was no time to be\r\nlost in a matter of such importance. And she wore one on her breast and\r\none in her hair when Mr Ashburton\'s address was published, and all the\r\nworld was discussing the new candidate.\r\n\r\n"Of course they are his colours--that is why I wear them," said Lucilla.\r\n"I shall always think there was something very strange in it. Just after\r\nI had heard of poor old Mr Chiltern\'s death, as I was passing\r\nHolden\'s--when I was not in the least thinking of him--he came into my\r\nmind like a flash of lightning, you know. If I had been very intimate\r\nwith poor old Mr Chiltern, or if I believed in spirit-rapping, I should\r\nthink _that_ was it. He came into my head without my even thinking of\r\nhim, all in a moment, with his very hat on and his umbrella, like\r\nMinerva--wasn\'t it Minerva?" said Miss Marjoribanks. And she took up Mr\r\nAshburton\'s cause openly, and unfurled his standard, and did not even\r\nask her father\'s opinion. "Papa knows about politics, but he has not had\r\nan intimation, as I have," said Lucilla. And, naturally, she threw all\r\nthe younger portion of Grange Lane, which was acquainted with Mr\r\nAshburton, and looked forward eagerly to a little excitement, and liked\r\nthe idea of wearing a violet-and-green cockade, into a flutter of\r\nexcitement. Among these rash young people there were even a few\r\nindividuals who took Lucilla\'s word for it, and knew that Mr Ashburton\r\nwas very _nice_, and did not see that anything more was necessary. To be\r\nsure, these enthusiasts were chiefly women, and in no cases had votes;\r\nbut Miss Marjoribanks, with instinctive correctness of judgment,\r\ndecided that there were more things to be thought of than the electors.\r\nAnd she had the satisfaction of seeing with her own eyes and hearing\r\nwith her own ears the success of that suggestion of her genius.\r\nCarlingford had rarely been more excited by any public event than it was\r\nby the address of the new candidate, who was in the field before anybody\r\nelse, and who had the boldness to come before them without uttering any\r\npolitical creed. "The enlightened electors of Carlingford do not demand,\r\nlike other less educated constituencies, a system of political doctrines\r\ncut and dry, or a representative bound to give up his own judgment, and\r\nact according to arbitrary promises," said the daring candidate: "what\r\nthey want is an honest man, resolved to do his duty by his country, his\r\nborough, and his constituency; and it is this idea alone which has\r\ninduced me to solicit your suffrages." This was what Mr Ashburton said\r\nin his address, though at that moment he had still his other address in\r\nhis pocket, in which he had entered at some length into his distinctive\r\npersonal views. It was thus that an independent candidate, unconnected\r\nwith party, took the field in Carlingford, with Miss Marjoribanks, like\r\nanother Joan of Arc, wearing a knot of ribbons, violet and green, in her\r\nhair, to inspire and lead him on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXXVIII_\r\n\r\n\r\nLife with most people is little more than a succession of high and low\r\ntides. There are times when the stream runs low, and when there is\r\nnothing to be seen but the dull sandbanks, or even mud-banks, for\r\nmonths, or even years together; and then all at once the waters swell,\r\nand come rushing twice a day like the sea, carrying life and movement\r\nwith them. Miss Marjoribanks had been subject to the _eaux mortes_ for a\r\nlong time: but now the spring-tides had rushed back. A day or two after\r\nMr Ashburton had been revealed to her as the predestined member,\r\nsomething occurred, not in itself exciting, but which was not without\r\nits ultimate weight upon the course of affairs. It was the day when Aunt\r\nJemima was expected in Grange Lane. She was Aunt Jemima to Lucilla; but\r\nthe Doctor called her Mrs John, and was never known to address her by\r\nany more familiar title. She was, as she herself described it, a widow\r\nlady, and wore the dress of her order, and was the mother of Tom\r\nMarjoribanks. She was not a frequent visitor at Carlingford, for she and\r\nher brother-in-law had various points on which they were not of accord.\r\nThe Doctor, for his part, could not but feel perennially injured that\r\nthe boy had fallen to the lot of Mrs John, while he had only a\r\ngirl--even though that girl was Lucilla; and Aunt Jemima could not\r\nforgive him for the rude way in which he treated her health, which was\r\nso delicate, and his want of sympathy for many other people who were\r\ndelicate too. Even when she arrived, and was being entertained with the\r\nusual cup of tea, fears of her brother-in-law\'s robustness and\r\nunsympathetic ways had begun to overpower her. "I hope your papa does\r\nnot ask too much from you, Lucilla," she said, as she sat in her\r\neasy-chair, and took her tea by the fire in the cosy room which had been\r\nprepared for her. "I hope he does not make you do too much, for I am\r\nsure you are not strong, my dear. Your poor mamma, you know----" and Mrs\r\nJohn looked with a certain pathos at her niece, as though she saw signs\r\nof evil in Lucilla\'s fresh complexion and substantial frame.\r\n\r\n"I am pretty well, thank you, Aunt Jemima," said Miss Marjoribanks,\r\n"and papa lets me do pretty much what I like: I am too old now, you\r\nknow, to be told what to do."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t call yourself old, my dear," said Aunt Jemima, with a passing\r\ngleam of worldly wisdom--"one gets old quite soon enough. Are you\r\nsubject to headaches, Lucilla, or pains in the limbs? Your poor\r\nmamma----"\r\n\r\n"Dear Aunt Jemima, I am as well as ever I can be," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. "Tell me when you heard from Tom, and what he is doing.\r\nLet me see, it is ten years since he went away. I used to write to him,\r\nbut he did not answer my letters--not as he ought, you know. I suppose\r\nhe has found friends among the Calcutta ladies," said Lucilla, with a\r\nslight but not unapparent sigh.\r\n\r\n"He never says anything to me about Calcutta ladies," said Tom\'s mother;\r\n"to tell the truth, I always thought before he went away that he was\r\nfond of _you_--I must have been mistaken, as he never said anything; and\r\n_that_ was very fortunate at all events."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I am very thankful he was not fond of me," said Lucilla, with\r\na little natural irritation, "for I never could have returned it. But I\r\nshould like to know why that was so fortunate. I can\'t see that it would\r\nhave been such a very bad thing for him, for my part."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear," said Aunt Jemima, placidly, "it would have been a very\r\nbad thing; for you know, Lucilla, though you get on very nicely here,\r\nyou never could have done for a poor man\'s wife."\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s bosom swelled when she heard these words--it swelled\r\nwith that profound sense of being unappreciated and misunderstood, which\r\nis one of the hardest trials in the way of genius; but naturally she was\r\nnot going to let her aunt see her mortification. "I don\'t mean to be any\r\nman\'s wife just now," she said, making a gulp of it--"I am too busy\r\nelectioneering; we are going to have a new member in dear old Mr\r\nChiltern\'s place. Perhaps he will come in this evening to talk things\r\nover, and you shall see him," Lucilla added, graciously. She was a\r\nlittle excited about the candidate, as was not unnatural--more excited,\r\nperhaps, than she would have been ten years ago, when life was young;\r\nand then it was not to be expected that she could be pleased with Aunt\r\nJemima for thinking it was so fortunate; though even that touch of\r\nwounded pride did not lead Miss Marjoribanks to glorify herself by\r\nbetraying Tom.\r\n\r\n"My brother-in-law used to be a dreadful Radical," said Aunt Jemima; "I\r\nhope it is not one of those revolutionary men; I have seen your poor\r\nuncle sit up arguing with him till I thought they never would be done.\r\nIf that is the kind of thing, I hope you will not associate yourself\r\nwith it, Lucilla. Your papa should have more sense than to let you. I\r\nshould never have permitted it if you had been _my_ daughter," added Mrs\r\nJohn, with a little heat--for, to tell the truth, she too felt a slight\r\nvexation on her part that the Doctor had the girl--even though not for\r\ntwenty girls would she have given up Tom.\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks looked upon the weak woman who thus ventured to\r\naddress her with indescribable feelings; but after all she was not so\r\nmuch angry as amused and compassionate. She could not help thinking to\r\nherself, if she had been Mrs John\'s daughter, how perfectly docile Aunt\r\nJemima would have been by this time, and how little she would have\r\nreally ventured to interfere. "It would have been very nice," she said,\r\nwith a meditative realisation of the possibility--"though it is very odd\r\nto think how one could have been one\'s own cousin--I should have taken\r\nvery good care of you, I am sure."\r\n\r\n"You would have done no such thing," said Mrs John; "you would have gone\r\noff and married; I know how girls do. You have not married now, because\r\nyou have been too comfortable, Lucilla. You have had everything your own\r\nway, and all that you wanted, without any of the bother. It is very\r\nstrange how differently people\'s lots are ordered. I was married at\r\nseventeen--and I am sure I have not known what it was to have a day\'s\r\nhealth----"\r\n\r\n"Dear Aunt Jemima!" said her affectionate niece, kissing her, "but papa\r\nshall see if he cannot give you something, and we will take such care of\r\nyou while you are here."\r\n\r\nMrs John was softened in spite of herself; but still she shook her head.\r\n"It is very nice of you to say so, my dear," she said, "and it\'s\r\npleasant to feel that one has somebody belonging to one; but I have not\r\nmuch confidence in your papa. He never understood my complaints. I used\r\nto be very sorry for your poor mamma. He never showed that sympathy--but\r\nI did not mean to blame him to you, Lucilla. I am sure he is a very good\r\nfather to you."\r\n\r\n"He has been a perfect old angel," said Miss Marjoribanks; and then the\r\nconversation came to a pause, as it was time to dress for dinner. Mrs\r\nJohn Marjoribanks had a very nice room, and everything that was adapted\r\nto make her comfortable; but she too had something to think of when the\r\ndoor closed upon Lucilla, and she was left with her maid and her hot\r\nwater and her black velvet gown. Perhaps it was a little inconsistent to\r\nwear a black velvet gown with her widow\'s cap; it was a question which\r\nshe had long debated in her mind before she resigned herself to the\r\ntemptation--but then it always looked so well, and was so very\r\nprofitable! and Mrs John felt that it was incumbent upon her to keep up\r\na respectable appearance for Tom\'s sake. Tom was very much in her mind\r\nat that moment, as indeed he always was; for though it was a long time\r\nago, she could not get the idea out of her head that he must have said\r\nsomething to Lucilla before he went off to India; and he had a way of\r\nasking about his cousin in his letters; and though she would have done\r\nanything to secure her boy\'s happiness, and was on the whole rather fond\r\nof her niece, yet the idea of the objections her brother-in-law would\r\nhave to such a match, excited to the uttermost the smouldering pride\r\nwhich existed in Aunt Jemima\'s heart. He was better off, and had always\r\nbeen better off, than her poor John--and he had robust health and an\r\nawful scorn of the coddling, to which, as he said, she had subjected his\r\nbrother; and he had money enough to keep _his_ child luxuriously, and\r\nmake her the leader of Carlingford society, while _her_ poor boy had to\r\ngo to India and put himself in the way of all kinds of unknown diseases\r\nand troubles. Mrs John was profoundly anxious to promote her son\'s\r\nhappiness, and would gladly have given every penny she had to get him\r\nmarried to Lucilla, "if that was what he wanted," as she justly said;\r\nbut to have her brother-in-law object to him, and suggest that he was\r\nnot good enough, was the one thing she could not bear. She was thinking\r\nabout this, and whether Tom really had not said anything, and whether\r\nLucilla cared for him, and what amid all these perplexities she should\r\ndo, while she dressed for dinner; and, at the same time, she felt her\r\npalpitation worse than usual, and knew Dr Marjoribanks would smile his\r\ngrim smile if she complained, so that her visit to Grange Lane, though\r\nLucilla meant to take good care of her, was not altogether unmingled\r\ndelight to Mrs John.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, Dr Marjoribanks\'s dinner-table was always a cheerful\r\nsight, even when it was only a dinner-party of three; for then naturally\r\nthey used the round table, and were as snug as possible. Lucilla wore\r\nher knot of green and violet ribbons on her white dress, to her aunt\'s\r\ngreat amazement, and the Doctor had all the air of a man who had been\r\nout in the world all day and returned in the evening with something to\r\ntell--which is a thing which gives great animation to a family party.\r\nMrs John Marjoribanks had been out of all that sort of thing for a long\r\ntime. She had been living quite alone in a widowed, forlorn way, and had\r\nhalf forgotten how pleasant it was to have somebody coming in with a\r\nbreath of fresh air about him and the day\'s budget of news--and it had\r\nan animating effect upon her, even though she was not fond of her\r\nbrother-in-law. Dr Marjoribanks inquired about Tom in the most fatherly\r\nway, and what he was about, and how things were looking for him, and\r\nwhether he intended to come home. "Much better not," the Doctor\r\nsaid,--"I should certainly advise him not, if he asked me. He has got\r\nover all the worst of it, and now is his time to do something worth\r\nwhile."\r\n\r\n"Tom is not one to think merely of worldly advantages," said his mother,\r\nwith a fine instinct of opposition. "I don\'t think he would care to\r\nwaste all the best part of his life making money. I\'d rather see him\r\ncome home and be happy, for my part, even if he were not so rich----"\r\n\r\n"If all men were happy that came home," said the Doctor, and then he\r\ngave a rather grim chuckle. "Somebody has come home that you did not\r\nreckon on, Lucilla. I am sorry to spoil sport; but I don\'t see how you\r\nare to get out of it. There is another address on the walls to-day\r\nbesides that one of yours----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope there will be six addresses!" cried Miss Marjoribanks; "if\r\nwe had it all our own way it would be no fun;--a Tory, and a Whig, and\r\na--did you say Radical, Aunt Jemima? And then, what is a Conservative?"\r\nasked Lucilla, though certainly she had a very much better notion of\r\npolitical matters than Aunt Jemima had, to say the least.\r\n\r\n"I wonder how you can encourage any poor man to go into Parliament,"\r\nsaid Mrs John; "so trying for the health as it must be, and an end to\r\neverything like domestic life. If it was my Tom I would almost rather he\r\nstayed in India. He looks strong, but there is never any confidence to\r\nbe put in young men looking strong. Oh, I know you do not agree with me,\r\nDoctor; but I have had sad reason for my way of thinking," said the poor\r\nlady. As for the Doctor, he did not accept the challenge thus thrown to\r\nhim. Tom Marjoribanks was not the foremost figure in the world in his\r\neyes, as the absent wanderer was in that of his mother; and he had not\r\nyet unburdened himself of what he had to say.\r\n\r\n"I am not saying anything in favour of going into Parliament," said the\r\nDoctor. "I\'d sooner be a barge-man on the canal, if it was me. I am only\r\ntelling Lucilla what she has before her. I don\'t know when I have been\r\nmore surprised. Of course you were not looking for _that_," said Dr\r\nMarjoribanks. He had kept back until the things were taken off the\r\ntable, for he had a benevolent disinclination to spoil anybody\'s dinner.\r\nNow, when all the serious part of the meal was over, he tossed the\r\n_Carlingford Gazette_ across the table, folded so that she could not\r\nmiss what he wanted her to see. Lucilla took it up lightly between her\r\nfinger and thumb; for the Carlingford papers were inky and badly\r\nprinted, and soiled a lady\'s hand. She took it up delicately without\r\neither alarm or surprise, knowing very well that the Blues and the\r\nYellows were not likely without a struggle to give up to the new\r\nstandard, which was violet and green. But what she saw on that inky\r\nbroadsheet overwhelmed in an instant Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\nself-possession. She turned pale, though her complexion was, if\r\npossible, fresher than ever, and even shivered in her chair, though her\r\nnerves were so steady. Could it be a trick to thwart and startle her? or\r\ncould it be true? She lifted her eyes to her father with a look of\r\nhorror-stricken inquiry, but all that she met in return was a certain\r\nair of amusement and triumph, which struck her at the tenderest point.\r\nHe was not sorry nor sympathetic, nor did he care at all for the sudden\r\nshock she had sustained. On the contrary, he was laughing within himself\r\nat the utterly unexpected complication. It was cruel, but it was\r\nsalutary, and restored her self-command in a moment. She might have\r\ngiven way under kindness, but this look of satisfaction over her\r\ndiscomfiture brought Lucilla to herself.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I thought you would be surprised," said Dr Marjoribanks dryly; and\r\nhe took his first glass of claret with a slow relish and enjoyment,\r\nwhich roused every sentiment of self-respect and spark of temper\r\nexisting in his daughter\'s mind. "If you had kept your own place it\r\nwould not have mattered; but I don\'t see how you are to get out of it.\r\nYou see young ladies should let these sort of things alone, Lucilla."\r\nThis was all the feeling he showed for her in her unexpected dilemma.\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s heart gave one throb, which made the green and\r\nviolet ribbons jump and thrill; and then she came to herself, and\r\nrecognised, as she had so often done before, that she had to fight her\r\nway by herself, and had nobody to look to. Such a thought is dreary\r\nenough sometimes, and there are minds that sink under it; but at other\r\ntimes it is like the touch of the mother earth which gave the giant back\r\nits strength; and Lucilla was of the latter class of intelligence. When\r\nshe saw the triumph with which her embarrassment was received and that\r\nshe had no sympathy nor aid to look for, she recovered herself as if by\r\nmagic. Let what would come in the way, nothing could alter her certainty\r\nthat Mr Ashburton was the man for Carlingford; and that determination\r\nnot to be beaten, which is the soul of British valour, sprang up in an\r\ninstant in Miss Marjoribanks\'s mind. There was not even the alternative\r\nof victory or Westminster Abbey for Lucilla. If she was ever to hold up\r\nher head again, or have any real respect for herself, she must win. All\r\nthis passed through her head in the one bewildering moment, while her\r\nfather\'s words were still making her ears tingle, and _that name_,\r\nprinted in big inky letters, seemed to flutter in all the air round her.\r\nIt was hard to believe the intelligence thus conveyed, and harder still\r\nto go on in the face of old friendships and the traditions of her youth;\r\nbut still duty was dearer than tradition, and it was now a necessity to\r\nfight the battle to the last, and at all risks to win.\r\n\r\n"Thank you all the same, papa, for bringing me the paper," said Lucilla.\r\n"It would have been a great deal worse if I had not known of it before I\r\nsaw him. I am sure I am very glad for one thing. He can\'t be married or\r\ndead, as people used to say. I am quite ashamed to keep you so long\r\ndownstairs, Aunt Jemima, when I know you must be longing for a cup of\r\ntea--but it is somebody come back whom nobody expected. Tell him I shall\r\nbe _so_ glad to see him, papa; though I have no reason to be glad, for\r\nhe was one of my _young_ friends, you know, and he is sure to think I\r\nhave gone off." As she spoke, Lucilla turned Aunt Jemima, to whom she\r\nhad given her arm, quite round, that she might look into the great glass\r\nover the mantelpiece: "I don\'t think I _am_ quite so much gone off as I\r\nexpected to be," said Miss Marjoribanks, with candid impartiality;\r\n"though of course he will think me stouter--but it does not make any\r\ndifference about Mr Ashburton being the right man for Carlingford." She\r\nsaid the words with a certain solemnity, and turned Mrs John, who was so\r\nmuch surprised as to be speechless, round again, and led her upstairs.\r\nIt was as if they were walking in a procession of those martyrs and\r\nrenouncers of self, who build up the foundations of society; and it\r\nwould not be too much to say that under her present circumstances, and\r\nin the excitement of this singular and unexpected event, such was the\r\npainful but sublime consciousness which animated Lucilla\'s breast.\r\n\r\nAs for Dr Marjoribanks, his triumph was taken out of him by that\r\nspectacle. He closed the door after the ladies had gone, and came back\r\nto his easy-chair by the side of the fire, and could not but feel that\r\nhe had had the worst of it. It was actually Mr Cavendish who had come\r\nhome, and whose address to the electors of Carlingford, dated from Dover\r\non his return to England, the Doctor had just put into his daughter\'s\r\nhand. But wonderful and unlooked-for as was the event, Lucilla, though\r\ntaken unawares, had not given in, nor shown any signs of weakness. And\r\nthe effect upon her father of her last utterance and confession was such\r\nthat he took up the paper again and read both addresses, which were\r\nprinted side by side. In other days Mr Cavendish had been the chosen\r\ncandidate of Grange Lane; and the views which he expressed (and he\r\nexpressed his views very freely) were precisely those of Dr\r\nMarjoribanks. Yet when the Doctor turned to Mr Ashburton\'s expression of\r\nhis conviction that he was the right man for Carlingford, it cannot be\r\ndenied that the force of that simple statement had a wonderful effect\r\nupon his mind--an effect all the greater, perhaps, in comparison with\r\nthe political exposition made by the other unexpected candidate. The\r\nDoctor\'s meditations possibly took a slumbrous tone from the place and\r\nthe moment at which he pursued them; for the fact was that the words he\r\nhad just been hearing ran in his head all through the reading of the two\r\naddresses. Mr Cavendish would think Lucilla had gone off; but yet she\r\nhad not gone off so much as might have been expected, and Mr Ashburton\r\nwas the man for Carlingford. Dr Marjoribanks laughed quietly by himself\r\nin his easy-chair, and then went back to Mr Cavendish\'s opinions; and\r\nended again, without knowing it, in a kind of odd incipient agreement\r\nwith Lucilla. The new candidate was right in politics; but, after all,\r\nMr Ashburton was a more satisfactory sort of person. He was a man whom\r\npeople knew everything about, and a descendant of old Penrhyn, and had\r\nthe Firs, and lived in it, and spent about so much money every year\r\nhonestly in the face of the world. When a man conducts himself in this\r\nway, his neighbours can afford to be less exacting as to his political\r\nopinions. This comparison went on in the Doctor\'s thoughts until the\r\ndistinction between the two grew confused and faint in that ruddy and\r\ngenial glow of firelight and lamplight and personal well-being which is\r\napt to engross a man\'s mind after he has come in out of the air, as\r\npeople say, and has eaten a good dinner, and feels himself comfortable;\r\nand at last all that remained in Dr Marjoribanks\'s mind was that Mr\r\nCavendish would think Lucilla had gone off, though she had not gone off\r\nnearly so much as might have been expected; at which he laughed with an\r\nodd sound, which roused him, and might have induced some people to think\r\nhe had been sleeping--if, indeed, anybody had been near to hear.\r\n\r\nBut this news was naturally much more serious to Miss Marjoribanks when\r\nshe got upstairs, and had time to think of it. She would not have been\r\nhuman if she had heard without emotion of the return of the man whom she\r\nhad once dreamed of as member for Carlingford, with the addition of\r\nother dreams which had not been altogether without their sweetness. He\r\nhad returned now and then for a few days, but Lucilla knew that he had\r\nnever held up his head in Grange Lane since the day when she advised him\r\nto marry Barbara Lake. And now when he had bethought himself of his old\r\nambition, had he possibly bethought himself of other hopes as well? And\r\nthe horrible thing was, that she had pledged herself to another, and put\r\nher seal upon it that Mr Ashburton was the man for Carlingford! It may\r\nbe supposed that, with such a complication in her mind, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was very little capable of supporting Aunt Jemima\'s\r\nquestions as to what it was about, and who was Mr Cavendish, and why was\r\nhis return of consequence to Lucilla? Mrs John was considerably alarmed\r\nand startled, and began to think in earnest that Tom was fond of his\r\ncousin, and would never forgive his mother for letting Lucilla perhaps\r\nmarry some one else, and settle down before her very eyes.\r\n\r\n"If it is a very particular friend, I can understand it," Mrs John said,\r\nwith a little asperity; but that was after she had made a great many\r\nattempts, which were only partially successful, to find it all out.\r\n\r\n"Dear Aunt Jemima," said Lucilla, "we are all particular friends in\r\nCarlingford--society is so limited, you know;--and Mr Cavendish has been\r\na very long time away. He used to be of such use to me, and I am so fond\r\nof him," Miss Marjoribanks said, with a sigh; and it may be supposed\r\nthat Mrs John\'s curiosity was not lessened by such a response.\r\n\r\n"If you are engaged to any one, Lucilla, I must say I think I ought to\r\nhave been told," said Tom\'s mother, with natural indignation. "Though I\r\nought not to blame _you_ for it, perhaps. It is a sad thing when a girl\r\nis deprived of a mother\'s care; but still I am your nearest\r\nrelation----"\r\n\r\n"My dear aunt, it is something about the election," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. "How could I be engaged to a man who has been away ten\r\nyears?"\r\n\r\n"Tom has been away ten years," said Mrs John impetuously; and then she\r\nblushed, though she was past the age of blushing, and made haste to\r\ncover her imprudence. "I don\'t see what you can have to do with the\r\nelection," she said, with suspicion, but some justice; "and I don\'t\r\nfeel, Lucilla, as if you were telling me all."\r\n\r\n"I have the favours to make, Aunt Jemima," said Lucilla--"green and\r\nviolet. You used to be so clever at making bows, and I hope you will\r\nhelp me;--papa, you know, will have to be on Mr Ashburton\'s committee,"\r\nMiss Marjoribanks added; and then, in spite of herself, a sigh of doubt\r\nand anxiety escaped her bosom. It was easy to say that "papa would be on\r\nMr Ashburton\'s committee, you know," but nobody had known that Mr\r\nCavendish was coming to drive everything topsy-turvy; and Lucilla,\r\nthough she professed to know only who was the man for Carlingford, had\r\nat the same time sufficient political information to be aware that the\r\nsentiments propounded in Mr Cavendish\'s address were also Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s sentiments; and she did not know the tricks which some\r\ngreen-and-violet spirit in the dining-room was playing with the Doctor\'s\r\nfancy. Perhaps it might turn out to be Mr Cavendish\'s committee which\r\nher father would be on; and after she had pledged herself that the other\r\nman was the man for Carlingford! Lucilla felt that she could not be\r\ndisloyal and go back from her word, neither could she forget the\r\nintimation which had so plainly indicated to her that Mr Ashburton was\r\nthe man; and yet, at the same time, she could not but sigh as she\r\nthought of Mr Cavendish. Perhaps he had grown coarse, as men do at that\r\nage, just as Lucilla herself was conscious that he would find her\r\nstouter. Perhaps he had ceased to flirt, or be of any particular use of\r\nan evening; possibly even he might have forgotten Miss Marjoribanks--but\r\nnaturally that was a thing that seemed unlikely to Lucilla. And oh! if\r\nhe had but come a little earlier, or for ever stayed away!\r\n\r\nBut while all these thoughts were going through her mind, her fingers\r\nwere still busy with the violet-and-green cockades which Aunt Jemima,\r\nafter making sure that Mr Ashburton was not a Radical, had begun to help\r\nher with. And they sat and talked about Mrs John\'s breathing, which was\r\nso bad, and about her headaches, while Lucilla by snatches discussed the\r\nsituation in her mind. Perhaps, on the whole, embarrassment and\r\nperplexity are a kind of natural accompaniment to life and movement; and\r\nit is better to be driven out of your senses with thinking which of two\r\nthings you ought to do than to do nothing whatever, and be utterly\r\nuninteresting to all the world. This at least was how Lucilla reasoned\r\nto herself in her dilemma; and while she reasoned she used up yard upon\r\nyard of her green ribbon (for naturally the violet bore but a small\r\nproportion to the green). Whatever she might have to do or to\r\nsuffer--however her thoughts might be disturbed or her heart\r\ndistracted--it is unnecessary to add that it was impossible to Lucilla\r\neither to betray or to yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XXXIX_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a very good thing for Lucilla that Mrs John was so much of an\r\ninvalid, notwithstanding that the Doctor made little of her complaints.\r\nAll that Dr Marjoribanks said was--with that remnant of Scotch which was\r\noften perceptible in his speech--that her illnesses were a fine thing to\r\noccupy her, and he did not know what she would do without them--a manner\r\nof speaking which naturally lessened his daughter\'s anxiety, though her\r\nsympathetic care and solicitude were undiminished. And no doubt, when\r\nshe had been once assured that there was nothing dangerous in her aunt\'s\r\ncase, it was a relief to Miss Marjoribanks at the present juncture that\r\nMrs John got up late and always breakfasted in her own room. Lucilla\r\nwent into that sanctuary after she had given her father his breakfast,\r\nand heard all about the palpitation and the bad night Aunt Jemima had\r\npassed; and then when she had consoled her suffering relative by the\r\nreflection that one never sleeps well the first night or two, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was at liberty to go forth and attend a little to her own\r\naffairs, which stood so much in need of being attended to. She had had\r\nno further talk with the Doctor on the subject, but she had read over Mr\r\nCavendish\'s address, and could not help seeing that it went dead against\r\nher candidate; neither could Lucilla remain altogether unaffected by the\r\nexpression of feeling in respect to "a place in which I have spent so\r\nmany pleasant years, and which has so many claims on my affections," and\r\nthe touching haste with which the exile had rushed back as soon as he\r\nheard of the old member\'s death. If it touched Miss Marjoribanks, who\r\nwas already pledged to support another interest, what might it not do to\r\nthe gentlemen in Grange Lane who were not pledged, and who had a\r\nfriendship for Mr Cavendish? This was the alarming thought that had\r\ndisturbed her sleep all night, and returned to her mind with her first\r\nawakening; and when she had really her time to herself, and the fresh\r\nmorning hours before her, Lucilla began, as everybody ought to do, by\r\ngoing to the very root and foundation, and asking herself what, beyond\r\nall secondary considerations, it was _right_ to do. To change from one\r\nside to the other and go back from her word was a thing abhorrent to\r\nher; but still Miss Marjoribanks was aware that there are certain\r\ncircumstances in which honesty and truth themselves demand what in most\r\ncases is considered an untruthful and dishonest proceeding.\r\n\r\nThus in order to come to a right decision, and with a sense of the duty\r\nshe owed to her country which would have shamed half the electors in\r\nEngland, not to say Carlingford, Lucilla, who naturally had no vote,\r\nread the two addresses of the two candidates, and addressed herself\r\ncandidly and impartially to the rights of the subject. Mr Cavendish was\r\ndisposed, as we have said, to be pathetic and sentimental, and to speak\r\nof the claims the borough had upon his affections, and the eagerness\r\nwith which he had rushed home at the earliest possible moment to present\r\nhimself to them. If poor old Mr Chiltern had been King Bomba, or a\r\ngloomy Oriental tyrant, keeping all possible reformers and successors\r\nbanished from his dominions, the new candidate could not have spoken\r\nwith more pathos. It was a sort of thing which tells among the\r\nimaginative part of the community, or so, at least, most people think;\r\nand Miss Marjoribanks was moved by it for the first moment; but then her\r\nenlightened mind asserted its rights. She said to herself that Mr\r\nCavendish might have come home at any hour, by any steamboat; that\r\nCalais and Boulogne, and even Dieppe, were as open to him as if he had\r\nbeen an actual refugee, and that consequently there was nothing\r\nparticular to be pathetic about. And then, if the town had such claims\r\non his affections, why had he stayed so long away? These two\r\nrationalistic questions dispersed the first _attendrissement_ which had\r\nbegun to steal over Lucilla\'s mind. When she came to this conclusion,\r\nher difficulties cleared away. She had no reason to go back from her\r\nengagements and reject that intimation which had so impressed it on her,\r\nthat Mr Ashburton was the man. It was a sacrifice which ancient truth\r\nand friendship did not demand, for verity was not in the document she\r\nhad just been reading, and that appeal to sentiment was nothing more\r\nthan what is generally called humbug. "He might have been living here\r\nall the time," Lucilla said to herself; "he might have had much stronger\r\nclaims upon our affections; if he had wanted, he might have come back\r\nages ago, and not let people struggle on alone." When this view of the\r\nsubject occurred to her, Lucilla felt more indignation than sympathy.\r\nAnd then, as Dr Marjoribanks had done, she turned to the calm utterance\r\nof her own candidate--the man who was the only man for Carlingford--and\r\nthat sweet sense of having given sound counsel, and of having at last\r\nmet with some one capable of carrying it out, which makes up for so many\r\nfailures, came like balm to Lucilla\'s bosom. There was nothing more\r\nnecessary; the commotion in her mind calmed down, and the tranquillity\r\nof undisturbed conviction came in its place. And it was with this sense\r\nof certainty that she put on her bonnet and issued forth, though it\r\nsnowed a little, and was a very wintry day, on Mr Ashburton\'s behalf, to\r\ntry her fortune in Grange Lane.\r\n\r\nShe went to Mrs Chiley\'s, who was now very old, poor old lady! and\r\nfeeble, and did not like to leave her sofa. Not but what she could leave\r\nthe sofa, she said to her friends, but at that time of the year, and at\r\nher time of life, it was comfortable. The sofa was wheeled to the side\r\nof the fire, and Mrs Chiley reclined upon it, covered with knitted rugs\r\nof the brightest colours, which her young friends all worked for her.\r\nThe last one arrived was what used to be called an Afghanistan blanket,\r\ndone in stripes of all sorts of pretty tints, which was a present from\r\nMrs Beverley. "Her work, she says, Lucilla," said the old lady; "but we\r\nknow what sort of soft dawdling woman she is, and it must have been the\r\nArchdeacon\'s nieces, you know." But still it had the place of honour at\r\npresent, covering Mrs Chiley\'s feet, and affording something to talk\r\nabout when any one came in. And by her side was a little table, upon\r\nwhich stood one China rose, in a glass of water--a pale rose, almost as\r\npale as her soft old cheeks, and chilled like them by the approaching\r\nfrost. And the fire burned with an officious cheerfulness at her elbow,\r\nas if it thought nothing of such accidental circumstances as winter and\r\nold age. To be sure this was a reflection which never came into Mrs\r\nChiley\'s head, who was, on the contrary, very thankful for the fire, and\r\nsaid it was like a companion. "And I often think, my dear, how do the\r\npoor people get on, especially if they are old and sick, they have no\r\nfires to keep them cheerful in this dreadful weather," the kind old lady\r\nwould say. She did say so now when Lucilla came in, glowing with cold\r\nand her rapid walk, and with a flake or two of snow slowly melting on\r\nher sealskin cloak. Perhaps it was not a sentiment the Colonel agreed\r\nwith, for he gave a humph and a little hoist of his shoulders, as if in\r\nprotest, being himself a good deal limited in his movements, and not\r\nliking to own it, by the wintry torpor within his big old frame, and the\r\nwintry weather outside.\r\n\r\n"Come and tell us all the news, Lucilla, my darling," Mrs Chiley said,\r\nas she drew down her young friend\'s glowing face to her own, and gave\r\nher one of her lingering kisses; "I felt sure you would come and tell us\r\neverything. I said it would not be like Lucilla if she didn\'t. We know\r\nnothing but _the fact_, you know--not another word. Make haste and tell\r\nus everything, my dear."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t know anything," said Miss Marjoribanks. "Of course you mean\r\nabout Mr Cavendish. I saw it in the papers, like everybody else, but I\r\ndon\'t know anything more."\r\n\r\nAnd then Mrs Chiley\'s countenance fell. She was not very strong, poor\r\nold lady, and she could have cried, as she said afterwards. "Ah, well, I\r\nsuppose there is not time," she said, after a little pause; "I suppose\r\nhe has not got here from Dover yet--one always forgets the distance. I\r\ncalculated it all over last night, and I thought he would get home by\r\nthe eleven train; but these trains are never to be calculated upon, you\r\nknow, my dear. I _am_ a little disappointed, Lucilla. Poor dear! to\r\nthink how he must have rushed home the first moment--I could have cried\r\nwhen I read that address."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why any one should cry," said Lucilla. "I think he makes a\r\ngreat deal too much of that; he might have come ever so many years ago\r\nif he had liked. Poor Mr Chiltern did not banish him, poor old man!--he\r\nmight have been here for years."\r\n\r\nUpon which the Colonel himself drew a little nearer, and poked the fire.\r\n"I am glad to see you are so sensible, Lucilla," he said. "It\'s the\r\nfirst rational word I have heard on the subject. _She_ thinks he\'s a\r\nkind of saint and martyr; a silly young fellow that runs off among a set\r\nof Frenchmen because he can\'t get everything his own way--and then he\r\nexpects that we are all to go into transports of joy, and give him our\r\nvotes," Colonel Chiley added, smashing a great piece of coal with the\r\npoker, with a blow full of energy, yet showing a slight unsteadiness in\r\nit, which sent a host of blazing splinters into the hearth. He was a man\r\nwho wore very well, but he was not so steady as he once was, and\r\nnowadays was apt, by some tremulous movement, to neutralise the strength\r\nwhich he had left.\r\n\r\nMrs Chiley, for her part, was apt to be made very nervous by her\r\nhusband\'s proceedings. She was possessed by a terror that the splinters\r\nsome day would jump out of the hearth on to the carpet and fly into the\r\ncorners, "and perhaps burn us all up in our beds," as she said. She gave\r\na little start among her cushions, and stooped down to look over the\r\nfloor. "He will never learn that he is old," she said in Lucilla\'s ear,\r\nwho instantly came to her side to see what she wanted; and thus the two\r\nold people kept watch upon each other, and noted, with a curious mixture\r\nof vexation and sympathy, each other\'s declining strength.\r\n\r\n"For my part, I would give him all my votes, if I had a hundred," said\r\nMrs Chiley, "and so will you, too, when you hear the rights of it.\r\nLucilla, my dear, tell him--I hope _you_ are not going to forsake old\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\n"No," said Miss Marjoribanks--but she spoke with a gravity and\r\nhesitation which did not fail to reach Mrs Chiley\'s ear--"I hope I shall\r\nnever desert my old friends; but I think all the same that it is Mr\r\nAshburton who is the right man for Carlingford," she said slowly. She\r\nsaid it with reluctance, for she knew it would shock her audience, but,\r\nat the same time, she did not shrink from her duty; and the moment had\r\nnow arrived when Lucilla felt concealment was impossible, and that the\r\ntruth must be said.\r\n\r\nAs for Mrs Chiley, she was so distressed that the tears came to her\r\neyes; and even the Colonel laughed, and did not understand it. Colonel\r\nChiley, though he was by no means as yet on Mr Cavendish\'s side, was not\r\nany more capable than his neighbours of understanding Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s single-minded devotion to what was just and right; and\r\nwhy she should transfer her support to Ashburton, who was not a ladies\'\r\nman, nor, in the Colonel\'s opinion, a marrying man, nor anything at all\r\nattractive, now that the other had come back romantic and repentant to\r\nthrow his honours at her feet, was beyond his power of explanation. He\r\ncontented himself with saying "humph"; but his wife was not so easily\r\nsatisfied. She took Lucilla by the hand and poured forth a flood of\r\nremonstrances and prayers.\r\n\r\n"I do not understand you, Lucilla," said Mrs Chiley. "He whom we know so\r\nlittle about--whom, I am sure, you have no reason to care for. And where\r\ncould you find anybody nicer than Mr Cavendish?--and he to have such\r\nfaith in us, and to come rushing back as soon as he was able. I am sure\r\nyou have not taken everything into consideration, Lucilla. He might not\r\nperhaps do exactly as could have been wished before he went away; but he\r\nwas young and he was led astray; and I do think you were a little hard\r\nupon him, my dear; but I have always said I never knew anybody nicer\r\nthan Mr Cavendish. And what possible reason you can have to care about\r\nthat other man----"\r\n\r\n"It was like a special Intimation," said Lucilla, with solemnity. "I\r\ndon\'t see how I could neglect it, for my part. The day the news came\r\nabout poor old Mr Chiltern\'s death I was out, you know, and heard it;\r\nand just at one spot upon the pavement, opposite Mr Holden\'s, it came\r\ninto my mind like a flash of lightning that Mr Ashburton was the man. I\r\ndon\'t care in the least for him, and I had not been thinking of him, or\r\nanything. It came into my head all in a moment. If I had been very\r\nintimate with poor dear old Mr Chiltern, or if I believed in\r\nspirit-rapping, I should think it was a message from _him_."\r\n\r\nLucilla spoke with great gravity, but she did not impress her audience,\r\nwho were people of sceptical minds. Mrs Chiley, for her part, was almost\r\nangry, and could scarcely forgive Lucilla for having made her give grave\r\nattention to such a piece of nonsense. "If it _had_ been him," she said,\r\nwith some wrath, "I don\'t see how having been dead for a few hours\r\nshould make his advice worth having. It never was good for anything when\r\nhe was alive. And you don\'t believe in spirit-rapping, I _hope_. I\r\nwonder how you can talk such nonsense," the old lady said severely. And\r\nColonel Chiley, who had been a little curious too, laughed and coughed\r\nover the joke; for the two old people were of the old school, and of a\r\nvery unbelieving frame of mind.\r\n\r\n"I knew you would laugh," said Miss Marjoribanks, "but I cannot help it.\r\nIf it had been impressed upon _your_ mind like that, you would have been\r\ndifferent. And, of course, I like Mr Cavendish much the best. I am so\r\nglad I have no vote," said Lucilla; "it does not matter to anybody what\r\nI think; but if I had anything to do with it, you know I could not stand\r\nup for Mr Cavendish, even though I am fond of him, when I felt sure that\r\nMr Ashburton is the man for Carlingford--nobody could ask me to do\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nThere followed a pause upon this declaration; for Miss Marjoribanks,\r\nthough she had no vote, was a person of undoubted influence, and such a\r\nconviction on her part was not to be laughed at. Even Colonel Chiley,\r\nwho was undecided in his own mind, was moved by it a little. "What does\r\nthe Doctor think?" he asked. "Ashburton doesn\'t say a word about his\r\nprinciples that I can see; and the other, you know----"\r\n\r\n"Dear Colonel Chiley," cried Lucilla, "he is not going to be Prime\r\nMinister; and I have always heard you say, as long as I can remember,\r\nthat it was not opinions, you know, but a good _man_ that people wanted.\r\nI have heard people talking politics for hours, and I always remember\r\nyou saying that, and thinking it was the only sensible thing that was\r\nsaid; but, of course, I don\'t understand politics," Lucilla added, with\r\nhumility. As for the Colonel, he took up the poker, perhaps to hide a\r\nlittle pleasant confusion, and again drew near the fire.\r\n\r\n"By George! I believe Lucilla is in the right," he said, with a certain\r\nagreeable consciousness. Perhaps he did not quite recollect at what\r\nmoment of his life he had originated that sentiment, but he thought he\r\ncould recollect having said it; and it was with the view of carrying off\r\nthe bashfulness of genius, and not because the coals had any need of it,\r\nthat he took up the poker--a proceeding which was always regarded with\r\nalarm and suspicion by his wife.\r\n\r\n"The fire is very nice," said Mrs Chiley. "I hate to have the fire poked\r\nwhen it does not want it. Lucilla, if you make him go over to _that_ Mr\r\nAshburton\'s side, you will have a great deal to answer for, and I will\r\nnever forgive you. My dear, you must be dreaming--a man that is as dry\r\nas a stick, and not one-hundredth nor one-thousandth part so nice----"\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t say another word," said Lucilla; "I shan\'t stay any longer,\r\nfor I can\'t help it, and you would be angry with me. People can\'t help\r\nwhat they believe, you know. There is poor little Oswald Brown, who has\r\ndoubts, and can\'t go into the Church, and will ruin all his prospects,\r\nand nobody can help it----"\r\n\r\n"If I were his mother I should help it!" cried Mrs Chiley. "I promise\r\nyou he should not talk of his doubts to me! A bit of a lad; and what is\r\ngood enough for all the bishops, and everybody in their senses, is not\r\ngood enough for him! If that is the kind of example you are going to\r\nfollow, Lucilla----"\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley," said Miss Marjoribanks, "everybody knows what my\r\nChurch principles are; and perhaps you will come round to think with me;\r\nbut I am not going to say any more about it now. I am so glad your\r\nrheumatism is better this morning; but you must wrap up well, for it is\r\nso cold, oh, so cold, out of doors!"\r\n\r\nWhen Lucilla had thus dismissed the subject, she came to her old\r\nfriend\'s side and bent over her in her sealskin cloak, to say good-bye.\r\nMrs Chiley took her by both hands as she thus stood with her back to the\r\nold Colonel, and drew her down close, and looked searchingly into her\r\neyes. "If you have any _particular_ reason, Lucilla, you ought to tell\r\nme--that would make such a difference," said the old lady. "I always\r\ntell you everything," said Miss Marjoribanks, with evasive fondness, as\r\nshe kissed the soft old withered cheek; and naturally, with the Colonel\r\nbehind, who was standing up before the fire shadowing over them both,\r\nand quite unaware of this little whispered episode, it would have been\r\nimpossible to say more had there been ever so much to say. But it had\r\nbeen a close encounter in its way, and Lucilla was rather glad to get\r\noff without any further damage. She did not feel quite successful as she\r\nwent out; but still she had left a very wholesome commotion behind her;\r\nfor Colonel Chiley could not but feel that the sentiment which she had\r\nquoted from himself was a very just sentiment. "By George! Lucilla was\r\nin the right of it," he said again, after she was gone; and in fact went\r\nthrough a process very similar to that which had modified the sentiments\r\nof Dr Marjoribanks on the previous night. Mr Cavendish was a young\r\nfellow who had rushed off among a set of Frenchmen, because Lucilla\r\nMarjoribanks would not have him, or because he could not marry Barbara\r\nLake in addition, or at least somehow because he failed of having his\r\nown way. It was all very well for him to come back and make a commotion,\r\nand be sentimental about it. But what if, after all, Ashburton, who had\r\nthe Firs, and lived there, and spent his money like a Christian, was the\r\nman for Carlingford? The Colonel\'s mind still wavered and veered about;\r\nyet it had received an impulse which was by no means unworthy of\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nAs for Mrs Chiley, she laid back her head upon her pillows and painfully\r\nquestioned with herself whether Lucilla could have any _particular_\r\nreason for taking Mr Ashburton\'s part so warmly. She thought with\r\njustice that Miss Marjoribanks was looking brighter and better, and had\r\nmore of her old animation than she had shown for a long time--which\r\narose from the simple fact that she had something in hand, though the\r\nold lady thought it might have a more touching and delicate motive. If\r\n_that_ was the case, it would make a great difference. Mrs Chiley was no\r\nlonger able to go out in the evening, and had to be dependent on other\r\npeople\'s observation for a knowledge of what happened--and she was\r\nwounded by a sense that her young friend had not been appreciated as her\r\nworth deserved. If Mr Ashburton had the sense to see what was for his\r\nown advantage, it would be a frightful thing, as Mrs Chiley said to\r\nherself, if Lucilla\'s friends should fly in his face. And though it was\r\na hard trial to give up Mr Cavendish, still if anything of the kind had\r\nhappened----Thus it will be evident that Lucilla\'s visit, though it was\r\nnot a long one, nor the least in the world an argumentative visit, was\r\nnot without its fruit.\r\n\r\nShe went up Grange Lane again cheerful and warm in her sealskin coat. It\r\nwas a thing that suited her remarkably well, and corresponded with her\r\ncharacter, and everybody knows how comfortable they are. The snowflakes\r\nfell softly, one at a time, and melted away to nothing upon her sleeves\r\nand her shoulders without leaving any trace--and Lucilla, with the chill\r\nair blowing in her face, and those feathery messengers in the air, could\r\nnot but feel that her walk and the general readiness which she felt to\r\nface all kinds of objections and difficulties, and to make a sacrifice\r\nof her own feelings, had in them a certain magnanimous and heroic\r\nelement. For after all she had no _particular_ reason, as Mrs Chiley\r\nsaid. Mr Ashburton was a dry man, and of very little use in a social\r\npoint of view, and had never paid her any attention to speak of, nor at\r\nall put himself forth as a candidate for her favour. If he had done so,\r\nshe would not have felt that thrill of utter disinterestedness which\r\nkept her as warm within as her sealskin did without.\r\n\r\nThere was not a soul to be seen in Grange Lane at that moment in the\r\nsnow, which came on faster and faster, but one of Mr Wentworth\'s (who at\r\nthat time was new in St Roque\'s) gray sisters, and another lady who was\r\ncoming down, as quickly as Lucilla was going up, by the long line of\r\ngarden walls. The gentlemen were either at business or at their club, or\r\nkeeping themselves snug indoors; and it was only these devoted women who\r\nbraved the elements outside. The figure in the gray cloak was occupied\r\nsimply with the poor people, and that is not our present business; but\r\nthe other two were otherwise inspired. Mr Cavendish, who had lately\r\narrived, had not been able to make up his mind to face the weather; but\r\nhis sister was of a different way of thinking. She was not of half the\r\ncapacity of Lucilla, but still she felt that something ought to be done,\r\nand that there was not a moment to be lost. When she saw it was Miss\r\nMarjoribanks that was advancing to meet her, a momentary chill came over\r\nMrs Woodburn. She was thinking so much of her own errand that she could\r\nnot but jump at the idea that nothing less important could have induced\r\nLucilla to be out of doors on such a day; and her heart beat loud as the\r\ntwo drew near each other. Was it an unexpected and generous auxiliary,\r\nor was it a foe accomplished and formidable? For one thing, she was not\r\ncoming out of Mr Centum\'s, where Mrs Woodburn herself was going, which\r\nat least was a relief. As they came nearer the two ladies instinctively\r\nlooked to their weapons. They had met already in many a little passage\r\nof arms, but nothing like this had ever occurred to them before. If they\r\nwere to work in union, Mrs Woodburn felt that they would carry all\r\nbefore them; and if not, then it must be a struggle unto the death.\r\n\r\n"Is it really you, Lucilla?" she said; "I could not believe my eyes.\r\nWhat can have brought you out of doors on such a day? You that have\r\neverything your own way, and no call to exert yourself----"\r\n\r\n"I have been to see Mrs Chiley," said Lucilla sweetly; "when the weather\r\nis bad she sees nobody, and she is always so pleased to have me. Her\r\nrheumatism is not so bad, thank you--though I am sure if this weather\r\nshould last----"\r\n\r\n"You would see Mrs Beverley\'s blanket," said Mrs Woodburn, who was a\r\nlittle nervous, though perhaps that might only be the cold; "but we know\r\nwhat sort of woman she is, and it must have been the Archdeacon\'s\r\nnieces, my dear. Do turn back with me a moment, Lucilla; or I shall go\r\nwith you. I want to speak to you. Of course you have heard of Harry\'s\r\ncoming home?"\r\n\r\n"I saw it in the papers," said Miss Marjoribanks, whose perfect serenity\r\noffered a curious contrast to her companion\'s agitation. "I am sure I\r\nshall be very glad to see him again. I hope he will come to dinner on\r\nThursday as he used to do. It will be quite nice to see him in his old\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs Woodburn; "but that was not what I was thinking of. You\r\nknow you used always to say he ought to be in Parliament; and he has\r\nalways kept thinking of it since he went away--and thinking, I am sure,\r\nthat it would please you," said the poor woman, faltering; for Lucilla\r\nlistened with a smile that was quite unresponsive, and did not change\r\ncountenance in the least, even at this tender suggestion. "He has come\r\nhome with that object now, you know, now that poor old Mr Chiltern is\r\ndead; and I hope you are going to help us, Lucilla," said Mrs Woodburn.\r\nHer voice quite vibrated with agitation as she made this hurried,\r\nperhaps injudicious, appeal, thinking within herself at the same moment\r\nwhat would Harry say if he knew that she was thus committing him. As for\r\nLucilla, she received it all with the same tranquillity, as if she\r\nexpected it, and was quite prepared for everything that her assailant\r\nhad to say.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I wish I had a vote," said Lucilla; "but I have no vote, and\r\nwhat can a girl do? I am so sorry I don\'t understand politics. If we\r\nwere going in for that sort of thing, I don\'t know what there would be\r\nleft for the gentlemen to do."\r\n\r\n"You have influence, which is a great deal better than a vote," said Mrs\r\nWoodburn; "and they all say there is nobody like a lady for\r\nelectioneering--and a young lady above all; and then you know Harry so\r\nwell, and can always draw him out to the best advantage. I never thought\r\nhe looked so nice, or showed his talents so much, as when he was with\r\nyou," said the eager advocate. She was only wrapped in a shawl herself,\r\nand when she looked at Lucilla\'s sealskin coat, and saw how rosy and\r\ncomfortable she looked, and how serene and immovable, poor Mrs Woodburn\r\nwas struck with a pang of envy. If Miss Marjoribanks had married ten\r\nyears ago, it might have been she now who would have had to stand\r\ntrembling with anxiety and eagerness among the falling snow, knowing\r\nsundry reasons why Mr Cavendish should be disposed to go into Parliament\r\nmore substantial than that of gratifying a young lady, and feeling how\r\nmuch depended on her ability to secure support for him. This, as it\r\nhappened, had fallen to his sister\'s share instead, and Lucilla stood\r\nopposite to her looking at her, attentive and polite, and unresponsive.\r\nIf Harry had only not been such a fool ten years ago! for Mrs Woodburn\r\nbegan to think now with Aunt Jemima, that Lucilla did not marry because\r\nshe was too comfortable, and, without any of the bother, could have\r\neverything her own way.\r\n\r\n"It is so cold," said Miss Marjoribanks, "and I do think it is coming on\r\nto snow very fast. I don\'t think it is good to stand talking. Do come in\r\nto lunch, and then we can have a long chat; for I am sure nobody else\r\nwill venture out to-day."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could come," said Mrs Woodburn, "but I have to go down to Mary\r\nCentum\'s, and hear all about her last new housemaid, you know. I don\'t\r\nknow what servants are made of for my part. They will go out in their\r\ncaps and talk to the young men, you know, in a night that is enough to\r\ngive any one their death," the mimic added, with a feeble exercise of\r\nher gift which it was sad to see. "But Harry will be sure to come to\r\ncall the first time he goes out, and you _will_ not forget what I have\r\nsaid to you, Lucilla?" and with this Mrs Woodburn took her young\r\nfriend\'s hand and looked in her face with a pathetic emphasis which it\r\nwould be impossible to describe.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, certainly not," said Miss Marjoribanks, with cheerful\r\ncertainty; and then they kissed each other in the midst of the falling\r\nsnow. Mrs Woodburn\'s face was cold, but Lucilla\'s cheek was warm and\r\nblooming as only a clear conscience and a sealskin cloak could have made\r\nit; and then they went their several ways through the wintry solitude.\r\nAh, if Harry had only not been such a fool ten years ago! Mrs Woodburn\r\nwas not an enthusiastic young wife, but knew very well that marriage had\r\nits drawbacks, and had come to an age at which she could appreciate the\r\ncomfort of having her own way without any of the bother. She gave a\r\nfurtive glance after Lucilla, and could not but acknowledge to herself\r\nthat it would be very foolish of Miss Marjoribanks to marry, and forfeit\r\nall her advantages, and take somebody else\'s anxieties upon her\r\nshoulders, and never have any money except what she asked from her\r\nhusband. Mrs Chiley, to be sure, who was more experienced than Mrs\r\nWoodburn, and might have been her grandmother, took a different view of\r\nthe subject; but this was what the middle-aged married woman felt, who\r\nhad, as may be said, two men to carry on her shoulders, as she went\r\nanxiously down Grange Lane to conciliate Mrs Centum, wrapping her shawl\r\nabout her, and feeling the light snow melt beneath her feet, and the\r\ncold and discomfort go to her heart. She had her husband to keep in good\r\nhumour, and her brother to keep up and keep to the mark, and to do what\r\nshe could to remedy in public the effects of his indolent Continental\r\nhabits, and carry, if it was possible, the election for him--all with\r\nthe horrid sense upon her mind that if at any time the dinner should be\r\na little less cared for than usual, or the children more noisy, Woodburn\r\nwould go on like a savage. Under such circumstances, the poor woman,\r\namid her cares, may be excused if she looked back a little wistfully at\r\nLucilla going home all comfortable and independent and light-hearted,\r\nwith no cares, nor anybody to go on at her, in her sealskin coat.\r\n\r\nThis was how Lucilla commenced that effective but decorous advocacy\r\nwhich did Mr Ashburton so much good in Carlingford. She did not pretend\r\nto understand about politics, or to care particularly about Reform or\r\nthe Income-tax; but she expressed with quiet solemnity her conviction\r\nthat it was not opinions but a good man that was wanted; that it was not\r\na prime minister they were going to elect, and that Mr Ashburton was the\r\nman for Carlingford. "By George! Lucilla is in the right of it!" Colonel\r\nChiley said; "that was always my opinion;" and the people in Grange Lane\r\nsoon began to echo the Colonel\'s sentiments, which were so sound and so\r\njust.\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Marjoribanks, nobody had any occasion to "go on" about any\r\nneglect on her part of her household duties. Dr Marjoribanks\'s dinners\r\nwere always excellent, and it was now, as ever, a privilege to be\r\nadmitted to his table; and nothing could be more exemplary than the care\r\nLucilla took of Aunt Jemima, who had always such bad nights. Even on\r\nthis snowy afternoon she went in from her more important cares, with a\r\ncomplexion freshened by the cold, and coaxed Mrs John into eating\r\nsomething, and made her as comfortable as possible at the drawing-room\r\nfireside.\r\n\r\n"Now, tell me all about Tom," Lucilla said, when she had got her work\r\nand settled herself comfortably for a quiet afternoon--for the snow had\r\ncome on heavier than ever, and unless it might be a sister of charity,\r\nor such another sister not of charity, as Lucilla had already\r\nencountered, nobody was like to stir abroad or to disturb the two ladies\r\nin their work and their talk. Lucilla had some very interesting\r\nworsted-work in hand; and the drawing-room never looked more cosy, with\r\nsomebody to talk to inside, and the wintry world and driving snow\r\nwithout. And such an invitation as Miss Marjoribanks had just given\r\nlifted Aunt Jemima into a paradise of content. She took Lucilla at her\r\nword, and told her, as may be supposed, _all_ about Tom, including many\r\nthings which she was quite acquainted with and knew by heart; and at the\r\nsame time there was something implied all through, but never\r\nobtrusively set forth, which was not displeasing to the auditor. Miss\r\nMarjoribanks listened with affectionate satisfaction, and asked a great\r\nmany questions, and supplied a great many reminiscences, and entered\r\nquite into the spirit of the conversation, and the two spent a very\r\npleasant afternoon together,--so pleasant that Mrs John felt quite\r\nannoyed at the reflection that it must come to an end like everything\r\nelse that is good, and that she must get herself once more into her\r\nvelvet gown and dine with her brother-in-law. If Providence had only\r\ngiven her the girl instead of the Doctor, who would no doubt have got on\r\nquite well without any children! but then, to be sure, if Lucilla had\r\nbeen hers to start with, she never could have married Tom.\r\n\r\nFor this was the extravagant hope which had already begun to blossom in\r\nhis mother\'s breast. To be sure a woman might marry Tom, who was too\r\ncomfortable at home to think of marrying just anybody who might make her\r\nan offer. But it was not easy to tell how Lucilla herself felt on this\r\nsubject. Her complexion was so bright with her walk, her sensations so\r\nagreeable after that warm, cheerful, pleasant afternoon, her position so\r\nentirely everything that was to be desired, and her mind so nobly\r\nconscious of being useful to her kind and country, that, even without\r\nany additional argument, Miss Marjoribanks had her reward, and was\r\nhappy. Perhaps a touch more exquisite might still come in to round the\r\nfull proportions of content. But, to tell the truth, Lucilla was so well\r\noff that it was not necessary to invent any romantic source of happiness\r\nto account for the light of well-being and satisfaction that shone in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XL_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of Miss Marjoribanks\'s wise precaution and reticence was that\r\nSir John Richmond and the Doctor and Colonel Chiley were all on Mr\r\nAshburton\'s committee. They might not agree with his principles; but\r\nthen when a man does not state any very distinct principles, it is\r\ndifficult for any one, however well disposed, to disagree with him; and\r\nthe fact that he was the man for Carlingford was so indisputable, that\r\nnobody attempted to go into the minor matters. "Mr Ashburton is a\r\ngentleman known to us all," Sir John said, with great effect, in his\r\nnomination speech; and it was a sentence which went to the hearts of his\r\naudience. The other candidate had been a long time from home, and it was\r\nlonger still since anybody in Carlingford could be said to have\r\nbenefited by his residence there. He had had all his things down from\r\ntown, as Mr Holden, the upholsterer, pithily remarked--and that made a\r\ngreat difference to start with. As for Mr Ashburton, though it is true\r\nnobody knew what he thought about Reform or the Income-tax, everybody\r\nknew that he lived at the Firs, and was supplied in a creditable way by\r\nGeorge Street tradesmen. There was no mystery whatever about him. People\r\nknew how much he had a year, and how much he paid for everything, and\r\nthe way in which his accounts were kept, and all about him. Even when he\r\nhad his wine direct from the growers (for naturally his own county could\r\nnot supply the actual liquor), it was put in Carlingford bottles, and\r\npeople knew the kinds he had, and how much, and a hundred agreeable\r\ndetails. And then, "he was a gentleman as was always ready to give his\r\nadvice," as some of the people said. All this furnished an immense body\r\nof evidence in his favour, and made Sir John\'s remark eloquent. And then\r\nCarlingford, as a general rule, did not care the least in the world\r\nabout Reform. There were a few people who had once done so, and it was\r\nremarked in Grove Street that Mr Tozer had once been in a dreadful state\r\nof mind about it. But he was quite tranquil on the subject now, and so\r\nwas the community in general. And what was really wanted, as Lucilla\'s\r\ngenius had seen at a glance, was not this or that opinion, but a good\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time it would be vain to deny that Miss Marjoribanks\r\nlooked forward to a possible visit from Mr Cavendish with a certain\r\namount of anxiety. She was not frightened, for she knew her own powers;\r\nbut she was a little excited and stimulated by the idea that he might\r\ncome in at any minute, bringing back a crowd of recollections with him;\r\nand it was a perpetual wonder to her how he would take the inevitable\r\ndifference, whether he would accept it as natural, or put on the airs of\r\nan injured man. Lucilla did not go out the two afternoons after her\r\nmeeting with Mrs Woodburn, partly that she might not miss him if he\r\ncalled--for it was better to have it over; but Mr Cavendish did not come\r\non either of these days. After that, of course, she did not wait for him\r\nany longer. But on the third or fourth day, when she was in Miss Brown\'s\r\nphotographing room (the eldest Miss Brown was not married, and was a\r\nmother to the younger girls, and always enthusiastic about sitters), Mr\r\nAshburton called about business, and Thomas came to fetch Miss\r\nMarjoribanks. She was sitting with the greatest good-nature for half a\r\ndozen pictures, knowing in her secret heart all the time that she would\r\nlook a perfect fright, and that all Carlingford would see her grinning\r\nwith imbecile amiability out of the hazy background of Miss Brown\'s\r\n_cartes_. Lucilla knew this, and had hitherto avoided the process with\r\nsuccess; but now she gave in; and as the Major was there, of course they\r\ntalked of the coming election, which, indeed, at present was almost the\r\nonly topic of conversation in Grange Lane.\r\n\r\n"Of course, you are on Mr Ashburton\'s committee," said Lucilla; "you\r\nmust be, or going to be, after what you said the other day at lunch----"\r\n\r\n"What did I say?" asked Major Brown, with an air of dismay; for, to tell\r\nthe truth, his heart inclined a little towards poor Mr Cavendish, who\r\nwas an old neighbour, and to whom Major Brown could not but think the\r\nMarjoribanks and others had behaved rather cruelly. But then in these\r\nelectioneering matters one never knows what one may have done to\r\ncompromise oneself without meaning it; and the Major was a little\r\nanxious to find out what he had said.\r\n\r\n"Dear Major Brown," said Lucilla, seriously, "I am so sorry if you did\r\nnot mean it. I am sure it was that as much as anything that influenced\r\nMr Ashburton. He was turning it all over in his mind, you know, and was\r\nafraid the people he most esteemed in Carlingford would not agree with\r\nhim, and did not know what to do; and then you said, What did it matter\r\nabout opinions, if it was a good man?--that was what decided him," said\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, with sad yet gentle reproachfulness. "I am so sorry\r\nif you did not mean what you said----"\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! I don\'t remember saying anything of the sort," said Major\r\nBrown. "I--I am sure I never thought of influencing anybody. It is true\r\nenough about a good man, you know; but if I had imagined for an instant\r\nthat any one was paying attention----By George! it was you that said it,\r\nLucilla--I remember now."\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t make fun of me," said Miss Marjoribanks; "as if anybody\r\ncared what _I_ say about politics. But I know that was what decided poor\r\nMr Ashburton. Indeed, he told me so; and when he finds you did not mean\r\nanything----"\r\n\r\n"But, good heavens!--I--I did mean something," cried the accused, with\r\ndismay. And he grew quite inarticulate in his confusion, and red in the\r\nface, and lost his head altogether, while Lucilla sat calmly looking on\r\nwith that air of virtue at once severe and indulgent, which pities, and\r\nblames, and hopes that perhaps there is not so much harm done as might\r\nhave been expected. This was the position of affairs when Thomas came to\r\nsay that Miss Marjoribanks was wanted, as she had told him to do when\r\nher candidate came; for, to be sure, it was only next door. It was\r\nterrible to hear the soft sigh she gave when she shook hands with Major\r\nBrown. "I hope he will not feel it so much as I think; but I should be\r\nafraid to tell him," said Lucilla; and she went away, leaving the good\r\nman in a state of bewilderment and embarrassment and doubt, which would\r\nhave been much more unpleasant if he had not felt so flattered at the\r\nsame time. "I never meant to influence anybody, I am sure!" he said,\r\nwith a comical mixture of complacence and dismay, when Lucilla was gone.\r\n"I have always said, papa, that you don\'t think enough of the weight\r\npeople give to your opinion," Miss Brown replied, as she gave the final\r\nbath to her negatives; and they both left off work with a certain glow\r\nof comforted _amour propre_, and the most benevolent sentiments towards\r\nMr Ashburton, who, to tell the truth, until he got his lesson from Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, had never once thought about the opinion of Major Brown.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting with Aunt Jemima when Lucilla came in, and talking to her\r\nin a steady sort of a way. Nothing could have made Mr Ashburton socially\r\nattractive, but still there are many people to whom this steady sort of\r\ntalk is more agreeable than brilliancy. When a man is brilliant there is\r\nalways a doubt in some minds whether he is trustworthy, or sincere, or\r\nto be relied upon; but an ordinary commonsense sort of talker is free\r\nfrom such suspicion. Mr Ashburton was very sorry to hear that Mrs John\r\nMarjoribanks had bad nights, and suggested that it might be nervousness,\r\nand hoped that the air of Carlingford would do her good, and was very\r\nglad to hear that her son was getting on so well in India; and Aunt\r\nJemima could not help approving of him, and feeling that he was a person\r\nof substance and reflection, and not one of those fly-away young men who\r\nturn girls\' heads, and never mean anything. Lucilla herself gained\r\nsomething in Mrs John\'s eyes from Mr Ashburton\'s high opinion; but at\r\nthe same time it was quite clear that he was not thinking of anything\r\nsentimental, but was quite occupied about his election, as a man of\r\nsense should be. Lucilla came in with a fine bloom on her cheeks, but\r\nstill with a shade of that sadness which had had so great an effect upon\r\nMajor Brown. She had taken off her hat before she came in, and dropped\r\ninto her chair with an air of languor and fatigue which was quite\r\nunusual to her. "It makes such a difference in life when one has\r\nsomething on one\'s mind," said Lucilla, and she sighed, as was but\r\nnatural; for though that did not affect the energy of her proceedings,\r\nshe knew and remembered at moments of discouragement how seldom one\'s\r\nmost disinterested exertions are appreciated at the end.\r\n\r\n"You want your lunch, my dear," said Mrs John.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I do," said Miss Marjoribanks, with a mournful affectionate\r\nsmile. "I have been sitting to Maria Brown. She has taken six, and I am\r\nsure they are every one more hideous than the other; and they will go\r\nall over England, you know, for the Browns have hosts of people\r\nbelonging to them; and everybody will say, \'So _that_ is Miss\r\nMarjoribanks.\' I don\'t think I am vain to speak of," said Lucilla, "but\r\nthat sort of thing goes to one\'s heart."\r\n\r\n"These amateurs are terrible people," said Mr Ashburton, in his steady\r\nway; "and photographs are a regular nuisance. For my part----"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that," said Miss Marjoribanks. "I know what you are going to\r\nsay; and you _must_ sit to her, please. I have said already she must do\r\none of you; and I will tell you presently about the Major. But wait and\r\ntalk to Aunt Jemima a little, for I am so tired," said Lucilla. She was\r\nlying back negligently in her seat, with that air of languor which so\r\nmany young ladies excel in, but which was for her a novel indulgence.\r\nHer hand hung over the arm of her chair as if there was no longer any\r\nforce in it. Her head fell back, her eyes were half closed; it was a\r\nmoment of abandonment to her sensations, such as a high-principled young\r\nwoman like Miss Marjoribanks seldom gives way to. But Lucilla went into\r\nit conscientiously, as into everything she did, that she might regain\r\nher strength for the necessary duties that were before her.\r\n\r\nAnd it was at this moment that Thomas appeared at the door with a\r\nsuspicion of a grin appearing at the corners of his sober mouth, and\r\nannounced Mr Cavendish, who came in before an ordinary woman would have\r\nhad time to open her eyes. This was the moment he had chosen for his\r\nfirst visit; and yet it was not he who had chosen it, but fate, who\r\nseemed to have in this respect a spite against Lucilla. It was not only\r\nthe embarrassing presence of his rival, but the fact that neither of the\r\ntwo people in the room knew or had ever seen Mr Cavendish, that put a\r\nclimax to the horror of the situation. She alone knew him, and had to\r\ntake upon herself to present and introduce him, and bridge over for him\r\nthe long interval of absence, and all this with the sense of being in\r\nthe enemy\'s interest, and to a certain extent false to Mr Cavendish!\r\nLucilla rose at once, but she was not a woman to make pretences. She did\r\nnot throw off all in a moment her fatigue, and dash into spasmodic\r\naction. She held out her hand silently to Mr Cavendish, with a look\r\nwhich spoke only affectionate satisfaction in a friend\'s return. She did\r\nnot even speak at all for the first moment, but contented herself with a\r\nlook, which indeed, if he had been younger and less preoccupied, would\r\nno doubt have touched his very heart.\r\n\r\n"So you have really come back," she said. "I am so glad! after all that\r\npeople said about your being married and dead and ever so many stupid\r\nthings. Oh! don\'t look at me, please. It doesn\'t matter with a\r\ngentleman, but I know as well as if you had told me that you think me\r\ndreadfully gone off----"\r\n\r\n"_I_ entertain such a profane idea!" said Mr Cavendish; but he was\r\nconsiderably embarrassed, and he was a great deal stouter, and\r\naltogether different from what he used to be, and he had not the light\r\nhand of his youth for a compliment. And then he sat down on the chair\r\nThomas had given him; and he looked uncomfortable, to say the least of\r\nit; and he was getting large in dimensions and a little red in the face,\r\nand had by no means the air of thinking that it didn\'t matter for a\r\ngentleman. As for Miss Marjoribanks, it would be impossible to say what\r\nmists of illusion dropped away from her mind at the sight of him. Even\r\nwhile she smiled upon the new-comer, she could not but ask herself, with\r\nmomentary dismay--Had _she_ really gone off as much in the same time?\r\n\r\n"I have been looking for you," Miss Marjoribanks resumed; "I waited in\r\nfor you Tuesday and Wednesday, and it is so odd you should have come\r\njust at this minute. Aunt Jemima, this is Mr Cavendish, whom you have\r\nheard so much about--and don\'t go, please, Mr Ashburton--you two must\r\nknow each other. You will be hearing of each other constantly; and I\r\nsuppose you will have to shake hands or something on the hustings--so it\r\nwill be much the best to begin it here."\r\n\r\nBut the two candidates did not shake hands: they bowed to each other in\r\nan alarming way, which did not promise much for their future\r\nbrotherliness, and then they both stood bolt upright and stared at Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, who had relapsed, in the pleasantest way in the world,\r\ninto her easy-chair.\r\n\r\n"Now, please sit down and talk a little," said Lucilla; "I am so proud\r\nof having you both together. There never has been anybody in the world\r\nthat I have missed so much as _you_--you knew that when you went away,\r\nbut you didn\'t mind. Mr Ashburton is very nice, but he is of no use to\r\nspeak of in an evening," said Miss Marjoribanks, turning a reflective\r\nglance upon her own candidate with a certain sadness; and then they both\r\nlaughed as if it was a joke; but it was no joke, as one of them at least\r\nmust have known.\r\n\r\n"Lucilla," said Mrs John, with consternation, "I never heard anybody\r\ntalk as you do; I am sure Mr Ashburton is the very best of society, and\r\nas for Mr Cavendish----"\r\n\r\n"Dear Aunt Jemima," said Lucilla, "would you mind ringing the bell? I\r\nhave been sitting to Maria Brown, and I am almost fainting. I wish you\r\ngentlemen would sit to her; it would please her, and it would not do\r\n_you_ much harm; and then for your constituents, you know----"\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t wish me to look like one of Maria Brown\'s photographs\r\nto my constituents," said Mr Cavendish; "but then I am happy to say they\r\nall know me pretty well." This was said with a slight touch of\r\ngentlemanly spite, if there is such a thing; for, after all, he _was_ an\r\nold power in Carlingford, though he had been so long away.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lucilla reflectively, "but you are a little changed since\r\nthen; a little perhaps--just a little--stouter, and----"\r\n\r\n"Gone off?" said Mr Cavendish, with a laugh; but he felt horribly\r\ndisconcerted all the same, and savage with Miss Marjoribanks, and could\r\nnot think why "that fellow" did not go away. What had _he_ to do in\r\nLucilla\'s drawing-room? what did he mean by sitting down again and\r\ntalking in that measured way to the old lady, as if all the ordinary\r\nrules of good breeding did not point out to him that he should have gone\r\naway and left the field clear?\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know it does not matter for a gentleman," said Lucilla; and\r\nthen she turned to Mr Ashburton--"I am sure the Major wants to see you,\r\nand he thinks that it was he who put it into your head to stand. He was\r\nhere that day at lunch, you know, and it was something he said----"\r\n\r\n"Quite true," said Mr Ashburton in his business way. "I shall go to see\r\nhim at once. Thank you for telling me of it, Miss Marjoribanks; I shall\r\ngo as soon as I leave here."\r\n\r\nAnd then Mr Cavendish laughed. "This is what I call interesting," he\r\nsaid. "I hope Mr Ashburton sees the fun; but it is trying to an old\r\nfriend to hear of _that_ day at lunch, you know. I remember when these\r\nsort of allusions used to be pleasant enough; but when one has been\r\nbanished for a thousand years----"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lucilla, "one leaves all that behind, you know--one leaves\r\never so many things behind. I wish we could always be twenty, for my\r\npart. I always said, you know, that I should be gone off in ten years."\r\n\r\n"Was it the only fib you ever told that you repeat it so?" said Mr\r\nCavendish; and it was with this pretty speech that he took her\r\ndownstairs to the well-remembered luncheon. "But you _have_ gone off in\r\nsome things when you have to do with a prig like that," he said in her\r\near, as they went down together, "and cast off old friends. It was a\r\nthing a fellow did not expect of _you_."\r\n\r\n"I never cast off old friends," said Miss Marjoribanks. "We shall look\r\nfor you on Thursday, you know, all the same. Must you go, Mr Ashburton,\r\nwhen lunch is on the table? But then, to be sure, you will be in time at\r\nthe Browns\'," said Lucilla sweetly, and she gave the one rival her hand\r\nwhile she held the arm of the other, at the door of the dining-room, in\r\nwhich Mr Ashburton had gallantly deposited Aunt Jemima before saying\r\ngood-bye. They were both looking a little black, though the gloom was\r\nmoderate in Mr Ashburton\'s case; but as for Lucilla, she stood between\r\nthem a picture of angelic sweetness and goodness, giving a certain\r\nmeasure of her sympathy to both--Woman the Reconciler, by the side of\r\nthose other characters of Inspirer and Consoler, of which the world has\r\nheard. The two inferior creatures scowled with politeness at each other,\r\nbut Miss Marjoribanks smiled upon them both. Such was the way in which\r\nshe overcame the difficulties of the meeting. Mr Ashburton went away a\r\nlittle annoyed, but still understanding his instructions, and ready to\r\nact upon them in that businesslike way he had, and Mr Cavendish\r\nremained, faintly reassured in the midst of his soreness and\r\nmortification, by at least having the field to himself and seeing the\r\nlast (for the present) of his antagonist--which was a kind of victory in\r\nits way.\r\n\r\n"I thought I knew you better than to think you ever would have anything\r\nto do with _that_ sort of thing," said Mr Cavendish. "There are people,\r\nyou know, whom I could have imagined--but a prig like that." He became\r\nindeed quite violent, as Aunt Jemima said afterwards, and met with that\r\nlady\'s decided disapproval, as may be supposed.\r\n\r\n"Mr Ashburton is very well-bred and agreeable," Mrs John said, with\r\nemphasis. "I wish all the young men I see nowadays were as nice."\r\n\r\n"Young men!" said Mr Cavendish. "Is that what people call young\r\nnowadays? And he must be insane, you know, or he would never dream of\r\nrepresenting a town without saying a single word about his principles.\r\nI dare say he thinks it is original," said the unhappy man. He thought\r\nhe was pointing out his rival\'s weakness to Lucilla, and he went on with\r\nenergy--"I know you better than to think you can like that\r\nmilk-and-water sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t pretend to know anything about politics," said Lucilla. "I\r\nhear you gentlemen talk, but I never pretend to understand. If we were\r\nnot to leave you _that_ all to yourselves, I don\'t know what you could\r\nfind to do," Miss Marjoribanks added compassionately; and as she spoke\r\nshe looked so like the Lucilla of old, who had schemed and plotted for\r\nMr Cavendish, that he could not believe in her desertion in his heart.\r\n\r\n"That is a delusion like the going off," he said. "I can\'t believe you\r\nhave gone over to the enemy. When I remember how I have been roving\r\nabout all those ten years, and how different it might have been, and\r\nwhose fault it all was----"\r\n\r\nThis Mr Cavendish said in a low voice, but it did not the less horrify\r\nAunt Jemima, who felt prepared for any atrocity after it. She would have\r\nwithdrawn, in justice to her own sense of propriety; but then she\r\nthought it was not impossible that he might propose to Lucilla on the\r\nspot, or take her hand or something, and for propriety\'s sake she\r\nstayed.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lucilla--and her heart did for one little moment give a\r\nfaint thump against her breast. She could not help thinking what a\r\ndifference it might have made to him, poor fellow, had he been under her\r\nlawful and righteous sway these ten years. But as she looked at him it\r\nbecame more and more apparent to Miss Marjoribanks that Mr Cavendish\r\n_had_ gone off, whatever she herself might have done. The outlines of\r\nhis fine figure had changed considerably, and his face was a little red,\r\nand he had the look of a man whose circumstances, spiritual and\r\ntemporal, would not quite bear a rigid examination. As she looked at him\r\nher pity became tinged by a certain shade of resentment to think that\r\nafter all it was his own fault. She could not, notwithstanding her\r\nnatural frankness of expression, say to him, "You foolish soul, why\r\ndidn\'t you marry me somehow, and make a man of yourself?" Lucilla\r\ncarried honesty very far, but she could not go as far as that. "Yes,"\r\nshe said, turning her eyes upon him with a sort of abstract sympathy,\r\nand then she added softly, "Have you ever seen Her again?" with a\r\nlowering of her voice.\r\n\r\nThis interesting question, which utterly bewildered Aunt Jemima, drove\r\nMr Cavendish wild with rage. Mrs John said afterwards that she felt a\r\nshiver go through her as he took up the carving-knife, though it was\r\nonly to cut some cold beef. He grew white all at once, and pressed his\r\nlips tightly together, and fixed his eyes on the wall straight before\r\nhim. "I did not think, after what I once said to you, Miss Marjoribanks,\r\nthat you would continue to insult my judgment in that way," he said,\r\nwith a chill which fell upon the whole table, and took the life out of\r\neverything, and dimmed the very fire in the chimney. And after that the\r\nconversation was of a sufficiently ordinary description until they went\r\nback again into the drawing-room, by which time Mr Cavendish seemed to\r\nhave concluded that it was best to pocket the affront.\r\n\r\n"I am going to begin my canvass to-morrow," he said. "I have not seen\r\nanybody yet. I have nobody but my sister to take _me_ in hand, you know.\r\nThere was once a time when it might have been different"--and he gave\r\nLucilla a look which she thought on the whole it was best to meet.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Miss Marjoribanks, with cruel distinctness, "there was a\r\ntime when you were the most popular man in Grange Lane--everybody was\r\nfond of you. I remember it as if it had been yesterday," said Lucilla,\r\nwith a sigh.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t give a man much encouragement, by Jove!" said the unlucky\r\ncandidate. "You remember it like yesterday? It may be vanity, but I\r\nflatter myself I shall still be found the most popular man in Grange\r\nLane."\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks sighed again, but she did not say anything. On the\r\ncontrary she turned to Aunt Jemima, who kept in the background an\r\nalarmed and alert spectator, to consult her about a shade of wool; and\r\njust then Mr Cavendish, looking out of the window, saw Major Brown\r\nconducting his rival through his garden, and shaking hands with him\r\ncordially at the door. This was more than the patience of the other\r\ncandidate could bear. A sudden resolution, hot and angry, as are the\r\nresolutions of men who feel themselves to have a failing cause, came\r\ninto his mind. He had been badgered and baited to such an extent (as he\r\nthought) that he had not time to consider if it was wise or not. He,\r\ntoo, had sat to Maria Brown, and commanded once the warmest admiration\r\nof the household. He thought he would put it to the test, and see if\r\nafter all his popularity was only a thing to be remembered like\r\nyesterday;--and it was with this intention that he bade a hurried\r\ngood-bye to Lucilla, and, rushing out, threw himself at once upon the\r\ntroubled waves of society, which had once been as smooth as glass to the\r\nmost popular man in Grange Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XLI_\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Cavendish thought he had been an object of admiration to Maria Brown,\r\nas we have said. He thought of it with a little middle-aged complacency,\r\nand a confidence that this vague sentiment would stand the test he was\r\nabout to apply to it, which did honour to the freshness of his heart.\r\nWith this idea it was Miss Brown he asked for as he knocked at the\r\nMajor\'s door; and he found them both in the drawing-room, Maria with\r\ngloves on to hide the honourable stains of her photography, which made\r\nher comparatively useless when she was out of her "studio"--and her\r\nfather walking about in a state of excitement, which was, indeed, what\r\nMr Cavendish expected. The two exchanged a guilty look when they saw who\r\ntheir visitor was. They looked as people might well look who had been\r\ncaught in the fact and did not know how to get over it. They came\r\nforward, both of them, with a cowardly cordiality and eagerness to\r\nwelcome him--"How very good of you to come to see us so soon!" Miss\r\nBrown said, and fluttered and looked at her father, and could not tell\r\nwhat more to say. And then a dead pause fell upon them--such a pause as\r\nnot unfrequently falls upon people who have got through their mutual\r\ngreetings almost with an excess of cordiality. They stopped short all at\r\nonce, and looked at each other, and smiled, and made a fatal conscious\r\neffort to talk of something. "It is so good of you to come so soon,"\r\nMiss Brown repeated; "perhaps you have been to see Lucilla," and then\r\nshe stopped again, slightly tremulous, and turned an appealing gaze to\r\nher papa.\r\n\r\n"I have come to see _you_," said Mr Cavendish, plucking up all his\r\ncourage. "I have been a long time gone, you know, but I have not\r\nforgotten Carlingford; and you must forgive me for saying that I was\r\nvery glad to hear I might still come to see--Miss Brown. As for Lydia?"\r\nsaid the candidate, looking about him with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Lydia," said her sister, with a sigh--"her eldest is eight, Mr\r\nCavendish. We don\'t see her as often as we should like--marriage makes\r\nsuch a difference. Of course it is quite natural she should be all for\r\nher own family now."\r\n\r\n"Quite natural," said Mr Cavendish, and then he turned to the Major. "I\r\ndon\'t think there are quite so many public changes as I expected to see.\r\nThe old Rector always holds out, and the old Colonel; and you have not\r\ndone much that I can see about the new paving. You know what I have come\r\nhome about, Major; and I am sure I can count upon you to support me,"\r\nthe candidate said, with a great deal more confidence than he felt in\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\nMajor Brown cleared his throat; his heart was moved by the familiar\r\nvoice, and he could not conceal his embarrassment. "I hope nothing will\r\never occur," he said, "to make any difference in the friendly\r\nfeelings--I am sure I shall be very glad to welcome you back permanently\r\nto Carlingford. You may always rest assured of that," and he held out\r\nhis hand. But he grew red as he thought of his treachery, and Maria, who\r\nwas quaking over it, did not even try to say a word to help him--and as\r\nfor Mr Cavendish, he took up his position on the arm of the sofa, as he\r\nused to do. But he had a slim youthful figure when he used to do it, and\r\nnow the attitude was one which revealed a certain dawning rotundity,\r\nvery different, as Maria afterwards said, from one\'s idea of Mr\r\nCavendish. He was not aware of it himself, but as these two people\r\nlooked, their simultaneous thought was how much he had changed.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, you are very kind," said Mr Cavendish. "I have been a little\r\nlazy, I am afraid, since I came here; but I expect my agent down\r\nto-night, and then, I hope, you\'ll come over to my place and have a talk\r\nwith Woodburn and Centum and the rest about it. I am a poor tactician,\r\nfor my part. You shall contrive what is best to be done, and I\'ll carry\r\nit out. I suppose I may expect almost to walk over," he said. It was the\r\nconfidence of despair that moved him. The more he saw that his cause was\r\nlost, the more he would make it out that he was sure to win--which is\r\nnot an unusual state of mind.\r\n\r\n"I--I don\'t know, I am sure," said poor Major Brown. "To tell the truth,\r\nI--though I can safely say my sympathies are always with you,\r\nCavendish--I--have been so unfortunate as to commit myself, you know. It\r\nwas quite involuntary, I am sure, for I never thought my casual\r\nexpression of opinion likely to have any weight----"\r\n\r\n"Papa never will perceive the weight that is attached to his opinion,"\r\nsaid Miss Brown.\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of it in the least, Maria," said the modest Major;\r\n"but the fact is, it seems to have been _that_ that decided Ashburton to\r\nstand; and after drawing a man in to such a thing, the least one can do\r\nis to back him out in it. Nobody had an idea then, you know, that you\r\nwere coming back, my dear fellow. I assure you, if I had known----"\r\n\r\n"But even if you had known, you know you never meant it, papa," said\r\nMaria. And Mr Cavendish sat on the arm of the sofa, and put his hands\r\ndeep into his pockets, and dropped his upper lip, and knit his eyebrows\r\na little, and listened to the anxious people excusing themselves. He did\r\nnot make any answer one way or another. He was terribly mortified and\r\ndisappointed, and it went against his pride to make further\r\nremonstrances. When they had done, he got down off his seat and took his\r\nright hand out of his pocket and offered it to Miss Brown, who, putting\r\nher own into it, poor soul! with the remembrance of her ancient\r\nallegiance, was like to cry.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, "if that is the case, I suppose I need not bother you\r\nany longer. You\'ll give me your good wishes all the same. I used to hear\r\nof Ashburton sometimes, but I never had the least idea he was so\r\npopular. And to tell the truth, I don\'t think he\'s any great things to\r\nbrag of--though I suppose it\'s not to be expected _I_ should appreciate\r\nhis qualities," Mr Cavendish added, with a laugh. As for Miss Brown, it\r\nwas all she could do to keep from crying as he went away. She said she\r\ncould see, by the way he left the drawing-room, that he was a stricken\r\ndeer; and yet, notwithstanding this sympathetic feeling, she could not\r\nbut acknowledge, when Miss Marjoribanks mentioned it, that, to have been\r\nsuch a handsome man, he was inconceivably gone off.\r\n\r\nMr Cavendish went up Grange Lane with his hands in his pockets, and\r\ntried to think that he did not care; but he did care all the same, and\r\nwas very bitter in his mind over the failure of friends and the vanity\r\nof expectations. The last time he had walked past those garden walls he\r\nhad thought himself sure of the support of Carlingford, and the\r\npersonal esteem of all the people in all the houses he was passing. It\r\nwas after the Archdeacon had broken down in his case against the man\r\nwhom he called an adventurer, and when Mr Cavendish felt all the\r\nsweetness of being a member of an oligarchy, and entitled to the\r\nsympathy and support of his order. Now he went along the same path with\r\nhis hat over his ears and his hands in his pockets, and rage and pain in\r\nhis heart. Whose fault was it that his friends had deserted him and\r\nCarlingford knew him no more? He might as well have asked whose fault it\r\nwas that he was getting stout and red in the face, and had not the same\r\ngrace of figure nor ease of mind as he used to have? He had come very\r\nnear to settling down and becoming a man of domestic respectability in\r\nthis quiet place, and he had just escaped in time, and had laughed over\r\nit since, and imagined himself, with much glee, an old fogy looking\r\nafter a lot of children. But the fact is that men do become old fogies\r\neven when they have no children to look after, and lose their figure and\r\ntheir elasticity just as soon and perhaps a little sooner in the midst\r\nof what is called life than in any milder scene of enjoyment. And it\r\nwould have been very handy just now to have been sure of his election\r\nwithout paying much for it. He had been living fast, and spending a\r\ngreat deal of money, and this, after all, was the only real ambition he\r\nhad ever had; and he had thought within himself that if he won he would\r\nchange his mode of life, and turn over a new leaf, and become all at\r\nonce a different man. When a man has made such a resolution, and feels\r\nnot only that a mere success but a moral reformation depends upon his\r\nvictory, he may be permitted to consider that he has a right to win; and\r\nit may be divined what his state of mind was when he had made the\r\ndiscovery that even his old friends did not see his election to be of\r\nany such importance as he did, and could think of a miserable little bit\r\nof self-importance or gratified vanity more than of his interests--even\r\nthe women who had once been so kind to him! He had just got so far in\r\nhis thoughts when he met Mr Centum, who stared for a moment, and then\r\nburst into one of his great laughs as he greeted him. "Good Lord!\r\nCavendish, is this you? I never expected to see you like that!" the\r\nbanker said, in his coarse way. "You\'re stouter than I am, old fellow;\r\nand such an Adonis as you used to be!" Mr Cavendish had to bear all this\r\nwithout giving way to his feelings, or even showing them any more than\r\nhe could help it. Nobody would spare him that imbecile suggestion as to\r\nhow things used to be. To be growing stouter than Centum without\r\nCentum\'s excuse of being a well-to-do householder and father of a\r\nfamily, and respectable man from whom stoutness was expected, was very\r\nbitter to him: but he had to gulp it down, and recollect that Centum was\r\nas yet the only influential supporter, except his brother-in-law, whom\r\nhe had in Carlingford.\r\n\r\n"What have you been doing with yourself since you came that nobody has\r\nseen you?" said Mr Centum. "If you are to do any good here, you know, we\r\nshall have to look alive."\r\n\r\n"I have been ill," said the unfortunate candidate, with a little natural\r\nloss of temper. "You would not have a man to trudge about at this time\r\nof year in all weathers when he is ill."\r\n\r\n"I would not be ill again, if I were you, till it\'s all over," said Mr\r\nCentum. "We shall have to fight every inch of our ground; and I tell you\r\nthat fellow Ashburton knows what he\'s about--he goes at everything in a\r\nsteady sort of way. He\'s not brilliant, you know, but he\'s sure----"\r\n\r\n"Brilliant!" said Mr Cavendish, "I should think not. It is Lucilla\r\nMarjoribanks who is putting him up to it. You know she had an old grudge\r\nat me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense about Lucilla," said Mr Centum. "I can tell you Ashburton\r\nis not at all a contemptible adversary. He is going to work in the\r\ncunningest way--not a woman\'s sort of thing, and he\'s not a ladies\' man\r\nlike you," the banker added, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"But I am afraid you can\'t go in for that sort of thing as you used to\r\ndo, Cavendish. You should marry, and settle, and become a steady member\r\nof society, now you\'ve grown so stout." This was the kind of way in\r\nwhich he was addressed even by his own supporter, who uttered another\r\ngreat laugh as he went off upon his busy way. It was a sort of thing Mr\r\nCavendish was not used to, and he felt it accordingly. To be sure he\r\nknew that he was ten years older, and that there were several things\r\nwhich he could not do with the same facility as in his youth. But he had\r\nsaved up Carlingford in his imagination as a spot in which he would\r\nalways be young, and where nobody should find out the difference; and\r\ninstead of that, it was precisely in Carlingford that he was fated to\r\nhear how changed he was, with a frankness which only old friends would\r\nhave been justified in using. As for Lucilla Marjoribanks, she was\r\nrather better looking than otherwise, and absolutely had not gone off.\r\nIt did not occur to Mr Cavendish that this might be because Lucilla at\r\npresent was not still so old as he had been ten years ago, in the period\r\nwhich he now considered his youth. He was rather disposed, on the\r\ncontrary, to take a moral view, and to consider that it was her feminine\r\nincapacity for going too far, which had kept years and amusements from\r\nhaving their due effect upon Miss Marjoribanks. And, poor fellow, he\r\n_had_ gone too far. He had not been as careful in his life as he might\r\nhave been had he stayed at Carlingford; and now he was paying the\r\npenalty. Such was the edifying state of mind which he had come to when\r\nhe reached the top of Grove Street. And there a waft of soft\r\nrecollections came across his mind. In the absence of all sympathy he\r\ncould not help turning back to the thought of the enchantress of old who\r\nused to sing to him, and listen to him, and storm at him. Probably he\r\nwould have ended by strolling along the familiar street, and canvassing\r\nfor Mr Lake\'s vote, which would have done him no good in Carlingford,\r\nbut just then Dr Marjoribanks stopped in his brougham. The Doctor was\r\nlooking very strange that morning, though nobody had particularly\r\nremarked it--perhaps because he smoothed his countenance when he was out\r\nof the brougham, which was his refuge when he had anything to think\r\nabout. But he stopped suddenly to speak to Mr Cavendish, and perhaps he\r\nhad not time to perform that ceremony. He looked dark and cloudy, and\r\nconstrained, and as if he forced himself to speak; which, to be sure,\r\nunder the circumstances, was not so very strange.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to see you," the Doctor said, "though you were a day too\r\nlate, you know. Why didn\'t you give us warning before we all went and\r\ncommitted ourselves? If we had known that you were coming----"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s what old Brown said," said Mr Cavendish, with a slight shrug\r\nof his shoulders; which was imprudent, for the Major was not so old as\r\nthe Doctor, and besides was a much less important man in Grange Lane.\r\n\r\n"So you have been to see old Brown," said Dr Marjoribanks, in his dry\r\nway. "He always was a great admirer of yours. I can\'t wish you luck, you\r\nknow, for if you win we lose----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t want you to wish me luck. I don\'t suppose there can be much\r\ncomparison between my chance and that of a new man whom nobody ever\r\nheard of in my time," said the candidate for Carlingford. "I thought you\r\nScotchmen, Doctor, always liked to be on the winning side."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve a way of making our side the winning side," said Dr Marjoribanks\r\ngrimly, for he was touchy where his nationality was concerned. "Health\r\nall right, I hope?" he added, looking at Mr Cavendish with that critical\r\nmedical glance which shows that a verbal response is quite unnecessary.\r\nThis time there was in the look a certain insinuation of doubt on the\r\nsubject, which was not pleasant. "You are getting stout, I see," Dr\r\nMarjoribanks added--not laughing, but as if that too was poor Mr\r\nCavendish\'s fault.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m very well," he answered curtly; but the truth was that he did\r\nnot feel sure that he was quite well after he had seen the critical look\r\nin Dr Marjoribanks\'s eye.\r\n\r\n"You young men always go too fast," said the Doctor, with a strange\r\nlittle smile; but the term at least was consolatory; and after that\r\nDoctor Marjoribanks quite changed his tone. "Have you heard Woodburn\r\ntalking of that great crash in town?" he said--"that India house, you\r\nknow--I suppose it\'s quite true?"\r\n\r\n"Quite true," said Mr Cavendish, promptly, and somehow he felt a\r\npleasure in saying it. "I got all the particulars to-day in one of my\r\nletters--and lots of private people involved, which is always the way\r\nwith these old houses," he added, with a mixture of curiosity and\r\nmalice--"widows, and all sorts of superannuated folks."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a great pity," said the Doctor: "I knew old Lichfield once, the\r\nchief partner--I am very sorry to hear it\'s true;" and then the two\r\nshook hands, and the brougham drove on. As for Mr Cavendish, he made up\r\nhis mind at once that the Doctor was involved, and was not sorry, and\r\nfelt that it was a sort of judicial recompense for his desertion of his\r\nfriends. And he went home to tell his sister of it, who shared in his\r\nsentiments. And then it was not worth while going out any more that\r\nday--for the electioneering agent, who knew all about it, was not coming\r\ntill the last train. "I suppose I shall have to work when he is here,"\r\nMr Cavendish said. And in the meantime he threw himself into an easy\r\nchair. Perhaps that was why he was getting so stout.\r\n\r\nAnd in the meantime the Doctor went on visiting his patients. When he\r\ncame back to his brougham between his visits, and went bowling along in\r\nthat comfortable way, along the familiar roads, there was a certain\r\nglumness upon his face. He was not a demonstrative man, but when he was\r\nalone you could tell by certain lines about the well-worn cordage of his\r\ncountenance whether all was right with the Doctor; and it was easy to\r\nsee just at this moment that all was not right with him. But he did not\r\nsay anything about it when he got home; on the contrary, he was just as\r\nusual, and told his daughter all about his encounter with Mr Cavendish.\r\n"A man at his time of life has no right to get fat--it\'s a sort of thing\r\nI don\'t like to see. And he\'ll never be a ladies\' man no more, Lucilla,"\r\nsaid the Doctor, with a gleam of humour in his eye.\r\n\r\n"He is exactly like George the Fourth, papa," said Miss Marjoribanks;\r\nand the Doctor laughed as he sat down to dinner. If he had anything on\r\nhis mind he bore it like a hero, and gave no sign; but then, as Mrs John\r\nvery truly remarked, when a man does not disclose his annoyances they\r\nalways tell more upon him in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XLII_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were a great many reasons why this should be a critical period in\r\nMiss Marjoribanks\'s life. For one thing, it was the limit she had always\r\nproposed to herself for her term of young-ladyhood; and naturally, as\r\nshe outgrew the age for them, she felt disposed to put away childish\r\nthings. To have the control of society in her hands was a great thing;\r\nbut still the mere means, without any end, was not worth Lucilla\'s\r\nwhile--and her Thursdays were almost a bore to her in her present stage\r\nof development. They occurred every week, to be sure, as usual; but the\r\nmachinery was all perfect, and went on by itself, and it was not in the\r\nnature of things that such a light adjunct of existence should satisfy\r\nLucilla, as she opened out into the ripeness of her thirtieth year. It\r\nwas this that made Mr Ashburton so interesting to her, and his election\r\na matter into which she entered so warmly, for she had come to an age at\r\nwhich she might have gone into Parliament herself had there been no\r\ndisqualification of sex, and when it was almost a necessity for her to\r\nmake some use of her social influence. Miss Marjoribanks had her own\r\nideas in respect to charity, and never went upon ladies\' committees,\r\nnor took any further share than what was proper and necessary in parish\r\nwork; and when a woman has an active mind, and still does not care for\r\nparish work, it is a little hard for her to find a "sphere." And\r\nLucilla, though she said nothing about a sphere, was still more or less\r\nin that condition of mind which has been so often and so fully described\r\nto the British public--when the ripe female intelligence, not having the\r\nnatural resource of a nursery and a husband to manage, turns inwards,\r\nand begins to "make a protest" against the existing order of society,\r\nand to call the world to account for giving it no due occupation--and to\r\nconsume itself. She was not the woman to make protests, nor claim for\r\nherself the doubtful honours of a false position; but she felt all the\r\nsame that at her age she had outlived the occupations that were\r\nsufficient for her youth. To be sure, there were still the dinners to\r\nattend to, a branch of human affairs worthy of the weightiest\r\nconsideration, and she had a house of her own, as much as if she had\r\nbeen half a dozen times married; but still there are instincts which go\r\neven beyond dinners, and Lucilla had become conscious that her\r\ncapabilities were greater than her work. She was a Power in Carlingford,\r\nand she knew it; but still there is little good in the existence of a\r\nPower unless it can be made use of for some worthy end.\r\n\r\nShe was coming up Grange Lane rather late one evening, pondering upon\r\nthese things--thinking within herself compassionately of poor Mr\r\nCavendish, a little in the same way as he had been thinking of her, but\r\nfrom the opposite point of view. For Lucilla could not but see the\r\nantithesis of their position, and how he was the foolish apprentice who\r\nhad chosen his own way and was coming to a bad end, while she was the\r\nsteady one about to ride by in her Lord Mayor\'s coach. And Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was thinking at the same time of the other candidate, whose\r\ncanvass was going on so successfully; and that, after the election and\r\nall the excitement was over, she would feel a blank--and Lucilla did not\r\nsee how the blank was to be filled up as she looked into the future;\r\nfor, as has been said, parish work was not much in her way, and for a\r\nwoman who feels that she is a Power, there are so few other outlets. She\r\nwas a little disheartened as she thought it all over. Gleams of\r\npossibility, it is true, crossed her mind, such as that of marrying the\r\nmember for Carlingford, for instance, and thus beginning a new and more\r\nimportant career; but she was too experienced a woman not to be aware\r\nby this time, that possibilities which did not depend upon herself alone\r\nhad better not be calculated upon. And there did occur to her, among\r\nother things, the idea of making a great Experiment which could be\r\ncarried out only by a woman of genius--of marrying a poor man, and\r\naffording to Carlingford and England an example which might influence\r\nunborn generations. Such were the thoughts that were passing through her\r\nmind when, to her great surprise, she came up to her father, walking up\r\nGrange Lane over the dirty remains of the snow--for there was a great\r\ndeal of snow that year. It was so strange a sight to see Dr Marjoribanks\r\nwalking that at the first glance Lucilla was startled, and thought\r\nsomething was the matter; but, of course, it all arose from a perfectly\r\nnatural and explainable cause.\r\n\r\n"I have been down to see Mrs Chiley," said the Doctor; "she has her\r\nrheumatism very bad again; and the horse has been so long out that I\r\nthought I would walk home. I think the old lady is a little upset about\r\nCavendish, Lucilla. He was always a pet of hers."\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley! she is not very bad, I hope?" said Miss Marjoribanks.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, she is not very bad," said the Doctor, in a dreary tone. "The\r\npoor old machine is just about breaking up, that is all. We can cobble\r\nit this once, but next time perhaps----"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk in such a disheartening way, papa," said Lucilla. "I am sure\r\nshe is not so very old."\r\n\r\n"We\'re all pretty old, for that matter," said the Doctor; "we can\'t run\r\non for ever, you know. If you had been a boy like that stupid fellow\r\nTom, you might have carried on my practice, Lucilla--and even extended\r\nit, I shouldn\'t wonder," Dr Marjoribanks added, with a little grunt, as\r\nwho should say _that_ is the way of the world.\r\n\r\n"But I am not a boy," said Lucilla mildly; "and even if I had been, you\r\nknow, I might have chosen another profession. Tom never had any turn for\r\nmedicine that I ever heard of----"\r\n\r\n"I hope you know pretty well about all the turns he ever had with that\r\nold--woman," said the Doctor, pulling himself up sharply, "always at\r\nyour ear. I suppose she never talks of anything else. But I hope you\r\nhave too much sense for that sort of thing, Lucilla. Tom will never be\r\nanything but a poor man if he were to live a hundred years."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not, papa," said Lucilla, with a little sigh. The Doctor knew\r\nnothing about the great social experiment which it had entered into Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s mind to make for the regeneration of her contemporaries\r\nand the good of society, or possibly he might not have distinguished Tom\r\nby that particular title. Was it he, perhaps, who was destined to be the\r\nhero of a domestic drama embodying the best principles of that Moral\r\nPhilosophy which Lucilla had studied with such success at Mount\r\nPleasant? She did not ask herself the question, for things had not as\r\nyet come to that point, but it gleamed upon her mind as by a side-light.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how you would get on if you were poor," said the Doctor.\r\n"I don\'t think that would suit you. You would make somebody a capital\r\nwife, I can say that for you, Lucilla, that had plenty of money and a\r\nliberal disposition like yourself. But poverty is another sort of thing,\r\nI can tell you. Luckily you\'re old enough to have got over all the\r\nlove-in-a-cottage ideas--if you ever had them," Dr Marjoribanks added.\r\nHe was a worldly man himself, and he thought his daughter a worldly\r\nwoman; and yet, though he thoroughly approved of it, he still despised\r\nLucilla a little for her prudence, which is a paradoxical state of mind\r\nnot very unusual in the world.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I ever had them," said Lucilla; "not that kind of\r\npoverty. I know what a cottage means; it means a wretched man, always\r\nabout the house with his feet in slippers, you know--what poor dear Mr\r\nCavendish would come to if he was poor----"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor laughed, though he had not seemed up to this moment much\r\ndisposed for laughing. "So that is all your opinion of Cavendish," he\r\nsaid; "and I don\'t think you are far wrong either; and yet that was a\r\nyoung fellow that might have done better," Dr Marjoribanks said\r\nreflectively, perhaps not without a slight prick of conscience that he\r\nhad forsaken an old friend.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lucilla, with a certain solemnity--"but you know, papa, if a\r\nman will not when he may----" And she sighed, though the Doctor, who\r\nhad not been thinking of Mr Cavendish\'s prospects in that light, laughed\r\nonce more; but it was a sharp sort of sudden laugh without much heart in\r\nit. He had most likely other things of more importance in his mind.\r\n\r\n"Well, there have been a great many off and on since that time," he\r\nsaid, smiling rather grimly. "It is time you were thinking about it\r\nseriously, Lucilla. I am not so sure about some things as I once was,\r\nand I\'d rather like to see you well settled before----It\'s a kind of\r\nprejudice a man has," the Doctor said abruptly, which, whatever he might\r\nmean by it, was a dismal sort of speech to make.\r\n\r\n"Before what, papa?" asked Lucilla, with a little alarm.\r\n\r\n"Tut--before long, to be sure," he said impatiently. "Ashburton would\r\nnot be at all amiss if he liked it and you liked it; but it\'s no use\r\nmaking any suggestions about those things. So long as you don\'t marry a\r\nfool----" Dr Marjoribanks said, with energy. "I know--that is, of\r\ncourse, I\'ve _seen_ what that is; you can\'t expect to get perfection, as\r\nyou might have looked for perhaps at twenty; but I advise you to marry,\r\nLucilla. I don\'t think you are cut out for a single woman, for my part."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see the good of single women," said Lucilla, "unless they are\r\nawfully rich; and I don\'t suppose I shall ever be awfully rich. But,\r\npapa, so long as I can be a comfort to you----"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Doctor, with that tone which Lucilla could remember\r\nfifteen years ago, when she made the same magnanimous suggestion, "but I\r\ncan\'t live for ever, you know. It would be a pity to sacrifice yourself\r\nto me, and then perhaps next morning find that it was a useless\r\nsacrifice. It very often happens like that when self-devotion is carried\r\ntoo far. You\'ve behaved very well, and shown a great deal of good sense,\r\nLucilla--more than I gave you credit for when you commenced--I may say\r\nthat; and if there was to be any change, for instance----"\r\n\r\n"What change?" said Lucilla, not without some anxiety; for it was an odd\r\nway of talking, to say the least of it; but the Doctor had come to a\r\npause, and did not seem disposed to resume.\r\n\r\n"It is not so pleasant as I thought walking over this snow," he said; "I\r\ncan\'t give _that_ up, that I can see. And there\'s more snow in the air\r\nif I\'m any judge of the weather. There--go in--go in; don\'t wait for\r\nme;--but mind you make haste and dress, for I want my dinner. I may have\r\nto go down to Mrs Chiley again to-night."\r\n\r\nIt was an odd way of talking, and it was odd to break off like this; but\r\nthen, to be sure, there was no occasion for any more conversation, since\r\nthey had just arrived at their own door. It made Lucilla uneasy for the\r\nmoment, but while she was dressing she managed to explain it to herself,\r\nand to think, after all, it was only natural that her papa should have\r\nseen a little into the movement and commotion of her thoughts; and then\r\npoor dear old Mrs Chiley being so ill, who was one of his own set, so to\r\nspeak. He was quite cheerful later in the evening, and enjoyed his\r\ndinner, and was even more civil than usual to Mrs John. And though he\r\ndid not come up to tea, he made his appearance afterwards with a flake\r\nof new-fallen snow still upon his rusty gray whiskers. He had gone to\r\nsee his patient again, notwithstanding the silent storm outside. And his\r\ncountenance was a little overcast this time, no doubt by the late walk,\r\nand the serious state Mrs Chiley was in, and his encounter with the\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, she is better," he said. "I knew she would do this time.\r\nPeople at our time of life don\'t go off in that accidental kind of way.\r\nWhen a woman has been so long used to living, it takes her a time to get\r\ninto the way of dying. She might be a long time thinking about it yet,\r\nif all goes well----"\r\n\r\n"Papa, don\'t speak like that!" said Lucilla. "Dying! I can\'t bear to\r\nthink of such a thing. She is not so very old."\r\n\r\n"Such things will happen whether you can bear to think of them or not,"\r\nsaid the Doctor. "I said you would go down and see her to-morrow. We\'ve\r\nall held out a long time--the lot of us. I don\'t like to think of the\r\nfirst gap myself, but somebody must make a beginning, you know."\r\n\r\n"The Chileys were always older than you," said Mrs John. "I remember in\r\npoor Mrs Marjoribanks\'s time:--they were quite elderly then, and you\r\nwere just beginning. When my Tom was a baby----"\r\n\r\n"We were always of the same set," said the Doctor, interrupting her\r\nwithout hesitation. "Lucilla, they say Cavendish has got hold of the\r\nRector. He has made believe to be penitent, you know. That is cleverer\r\nthan anything you could have done. And if he can\'t be won back again it\r\nwill be serious, the Colonel says. You are to try if you can suggest\r\nanything. It seems," said the Doctor, with mingled amusement and satire,\r\nand a kind of gratification "that Ashburton has great confidence in\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"It must have been the agent," said Lucilla. "I don\'t think any of the\r\nrest of them are equal to that. I don\'t see, if that is the case, how we\r\nare to win him back. If Mr Ashburton had ever done anything very wicked,\r\nperhaps----"\r\n\r\n"You are safe to say _he_ is not penitent anyhow," said Dr\r\nMarjoribanks, and he took his candle and went away with a smile. But\r\neither Mr Ashburton\'s good opinion of Lucilla, or some other notion, had\r\ntouched the Doctor. He was not a man who said much at any time, but when\r\nhe bade her good-night, his hand drooped upon Lucilla\'s shoulder, and he\r\npatted it softly, as he might have patted the head of a child. It was\r\nnot much, but still it was a good deal from him. To feel the lingering\r\ntouch of her father\'s hand caressing her, even in so mild a way, was\r\nsomething quite surprising and strange to Miss Marjoribanks. She looked\r\nup at him almost with alarm, but he was just then turning away with his\r\ncandle in his hand. And he seemed to have laid aside his gloom, and even\r\nsmiled to himself as he went upstairs. "If _she_ had been the boy\r\ninstead of that young ass," he said to himself. He could not have\r\nexplained why he was more than ordinarily hard just then upon the\r\ninnocent, far-distant Tom, who was unlucky, it is true, but not exactly\r\nan ass, after all. But somehow it struck the Doctor more than ever how\r\ngreat a loss it was to society and to herself that Lucilla was not "the\r\nboy." She could have continued, and perhaps extended, the practice,\r\nwhereas just now it was quite possible that she might drop down into\r\nworsted-work and tea-parties like any other single woman--while Tom, who\r\nhad carried off the family honours, and was "the boy" in this limited\r\nand unfruitful generation, was never likely to do anything to speak of,\r\nand would be a poor man if he were to live for a hundred years. Perhaps\r\nthere was something else behind that made the Doctor\'s brow contract a\r\nlittle as he crossed the threshold of his chamber, into which, no more\r\nthan into the recesses of his heart, no one ever penetrated; but it was\r\nthe lighter idea of that comparison, which had no actual pain in it, but\r\nonly a kind of humorous discontent, which was the last articulate\r\nthought in his mind as he went to his room and closed his door with a\r\nlittle sharpness, as he always did, upon the outside world.\r\n\r\nAunt Jemima, for her part, lingered a little with Lucilla downstairs.\r\n"My dear, I don\'t think my brother-in-law looks well to-night. I don\'t\r\nthink Carlingford is so healthy as it is said to be. If I were you,\r\nLucilla, I would try and get your papa to take something," said Mrs\r\nJohn, with anxiety, "before he goes to bed."\r\n\r\n"Dear Aunt Jemima, he never takes anything. You forget he is a doctor,"\r\nsaid Miss Marjoribanks. "It always puts him out when he has to go out in\r\nthe evening; and he is sad about Mrs Chiley, though he would not say\r\nso." But nevertheless Lucilla knocked at his door when she went\r\nupstairs. And the Doctor, though he did not open, growled within with a\r\nvoice which reassured his dutiful daughter. "What should I want, do you\r\nthink, but to be left quiet?" the Doctor said. And even Mrs John, who\r\nhad waited at his door, with her candle in her hand, to hear the result,\r\nshrank within at the sound and was seen no more. And Miss Marjoribanks,\r\ntoo, went to her rest, with more than one subject of thought which kept\r\nher awake. In the first place, the Rector was popular in his way, and if\r\nhe chose to call all his forces to rally round a penitent, there was no\r\nsaying what might come of it; and then Lucilla could not help going back\r\nin the most illogical manner to her father\'s caress, and wondering what\r\nwas the meaning of it. Meantime the snow fell heavily outside, and\r\nwrapped everything in a soft and secret whiteness. And amid the\r\nwhiteness and darkness, the lamp burned steadily outside at the\r\ngarden-gate, which pointed out the Doctor\'s door amid all the closed\r\nhouses and dark garden-walls in Grange Lane--a kind of visible succour\r\nand help always at hand for those who were suffering. And though Dr\r\nMarjoribanks was not like a young man making a practice, but had perfect\r\ncommand of Carlingford, and was one of the richest men in it, it was\r\nwell known in the town that the very poorest, if in extremity, in the\r\ndepths of the wildest night that ever blew, would not seek help there in\r\nvain. The bell that had roused him when he was young, still hung near\r\nhim in the silence of his closed-up house when he was old, and still\r\ncould make him spring up, all self-possessed and ready, when the enemy\r\nDeath had to be fought with. But that night the snow cushioned the wire\r\noutside, and even made white cornices and columns about the steady lamp,\r\nand the Doctor slept within, and no one disturbed him; for except Mrs\r\nChiley and a few chronic patients, there was nothing particularly amiss\r\nin Carlingford, and then it was Dr Rider whom all the new people went\r\nto, the people who lived in the innumerable new houses at the other end\r\nof Carlingford, and had no hallowing tradition of the superior authority\r\nof Grange Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XLIII_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe talk of this evening might not have been considered of any\r\nimportance to speak of, but for the extraordinary and most unlooked-for\r\nevent which startled all Carlingford next morning. Nobody could believe\r\nthat it was true. Dr Marjoribanks\'s patients waited for him, and\r\ndeclared to their nurses that it was all a made-up story, and that he\r\nwould come and prove that he was not dead. How could he be dead? He had\r\nbeen as well as he ever was that last evening. He had gone down Grange\r\nLane in the snow, to see the poor old lady who was now sobbing in her\r\nbed, and saying it was all a mistake, and that it was she who ought to\r\nhave died. But all those protestations were of no avail against the cold\r\nand stony fact which had frightened Thomas out of his senses, when he\r\nwent to call the Doctor. He had died in the night without calling or\r\ndisturbing anybody. He must have felt faint, it seemed, for he had got\r\nup and taken a little brandy, the remains of which still stood on the\r\ntable by his bedside; but that was all that anybody could tell about it.\r\nThey brought Dr Rider, of course; but all that he could do was to\r\nexamine the strong, still frame--old, and yet not old enough to be\r\nweakly, or to explain such sudden extinction--which had ceased its human\r\nfunctions. And then the news swept over Carlingford like a breath of\r\nwind, though there was no wind even on that silent snowy day to carry\r\nthe matter. Dr Marjoribanks was dead. It put the election out of\r\npeople\'s heads, and even their own affairs for the time being; for had\r\nhe not known all about the greater part of them--seen them come into the\r\nworld and kept them in it--and put himself always in the breach when the\r\npale Death approached that way? He had never made very much boast of his\r\nfriendliness or been large in sympathetic expressions, but yet he had\r\nnever flinched at any time, or deserted his patients for any\r\nconsideration. Carlingford was sorry, profoundly sorry, with that true\r\nsorrow which is not so much for the person mourned as for the mourner\'s\r\nself, who feels a sense of something lost. The people said to\r\nthemselves, Whom could they ever find who would know their\r\nconstitutions so well, and who was to take care of So-and-so if he had\r\nanother attack? To be sure Dr Rider was at hand, who felt a little\r\nagitated about it, and was conscious of the wonderful opening, and was\r\nvery ready to answer, "I am here;" but a young doctor is different from\r\nan old one, and a living man all in commonplace health and comfort is\r\nnot to be compared with a dead one, on the morning at least of his\r\nsudden ending. Thank Heaven, when a life is ended there is always that\r\nhour or two remaining to set straight the defective balances and do a\r\nhasty late justice to the dead, before the wave sweeps on over him and\r\nwashes out the traces of his steps, and lets in the common crowd to make\r\ntheir thoroughfare over the grave.\r\n\r\n"It cannot be the Doctor," Mrs Chiley said, sobbing in her bed, "or else\r\nit has been in mistake for me. He was always a healthy man, and never\r\nhad anything the matter with him--and a great deal younger than we are,\r\nyou know. If anything has happened to him it must have been in mistake\r\nfor me," said the poor old lady, and she was so hysterical that they had\r\nto send for Dr Rider, and she was thus the first to begin to build the\r\nnew world on the foundations of the old, little as she meant it. But for\r\nthe moment everything was paralysed in Grange Lane, and canvassing came\r\nto a standstill, and nothing was discussed but Dr Marjoribanks--how he\r\nwas dead, though nobody could or would believe it; and how Lucilla would\r\nbe left, and who her trustees were, and how the place could ever get\r\nused to the want of him, or would ever look like itself again without\r\nhis familiar presence. It was by way of relieving their minds from the\r\nhorror of the idea, that the good people rushed into consultations what\r\nLucilla would do. It took their minds a little off the ghastly\r\nimagination of that dark room with the snow on the window, and the late\r\nmoonlight trying to get into the darkness, and the white rigid face\r\ninside, as he was said to have been found. It could not but make a\r\nterrible change to her--indeed, through her it could not but make a\r\ngreat change to everybody. The Doctor\'s house would, of course, be shut\r\nup, which had been the most hospitable house in Carlingford, and things\r\nwould drop into the unsatisfactory state they used to be in before Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s time, and there would no longer be anybody to organise\r\nsociety. Such were the ideas the ladies of Grange Lane relapsed into by\r\nway of delivering themselves from the pain of their first realisation of\r\nwhat had happened. It would make a great change. Even the election and\r\nits anticipated joys could not but change character in some respects at\r\nleast, and there would be nobody to make the best of them; and then the\r\nquestion was, What would Lucilla do? Would she have strength to "make an\r\neffort," as some people suggested; or would she feel not only her grief,\r\nbut her downfall, and that she was now only a single woman, and sink\r\ninto a private life, as some others were inclined to believe?\r\n\r\nInside the house, naturally, the state of affairs was sad enough.\r\nLucilla, notwithstanding the many other things she had had to occupy her\r\nmind, was fond of her father, and the shock overwhelmed her for the\r\nmoment. Though she was not the kind of woman to torture herself with\r\nthinking of things that she might have done, still at the first moment\r\nthe idea that she ought not to have left him alone--that she should have\r\nsat up and watched or taken some extraordinary, unusual precaution--was\r\nnot to be driven away from her mind. The reign of reason was eclipsed in\r\nher as it often is in such an emergency. She said it was her fault in\r\nthe first horror. "When I saw how he was looking, and how he was\r\ntalking, I should never have left him," said Lucilla, which indeed was a\r\nvery natural thing to say, but would have been an utterly impossible one\r\nto carry out, as she saw when she came to think of it. But she could not\r\nthink of it just then. She did not think at all that first long snowy,\r\ntroubled day, but went about the house, on the bedroom floor, wringing\r\nher hands like a creature distracted. "If I had only sat up," she said;\r\nand then she would recall the touch of his hand on her shoulder, which\r\nshe seemed still to be feeling, and cry out, like all the rest of the\r\nworld, that it could not be true. But, to be sure, that was a state of\r\nfeeling that could not last long. There are events for which something\r\nhigher than accident must be held accountable, were one ever so ready to\r\ntake the burden of affairs on one\'s own shoulders; and Lucilla knew,\r\nwhen she came to herself, that if she had watched ever so long or so\r\nclosely, that could have had no effect upon the matter. After a while,\r\nthe bewildering sense of her own changed position began to come upon\r\nher, and roused her up into that feverish and unnatural activity of\r\nthought which, in some minds, is the inevitable reaction after the\r\nunaccustomed curb and shock of grief. When she had got used to that\r\ndreadful certainty about her father, and had suddenly come with a leap\r\nto the knowledge that she was not to blame, and could not help it, and\r\nthat though _he_ was gone, _she_ remained, it is no censure upon\r\nLucilla to say that her head became immediately full of a horror and\r\nconfusion of thoughts, an involuntary stir and bustle of plans and\r\nprojects which she did all she could to put down, but which would return\r\nand overwhelm her whether she chose it or not. She could not help asking\r\nherself what her new position was, thinking it over, so strangely free\r\nand new and unlimited as it seemed. And it must be recollected that Miss\r\nMarjoribanks was a woman of very active mind and great energies, too old\r\nto take up a girl\'s fancy that all was over because she had encountered\r\na natural grief on her passage, and too young not to see a long future\r\nstill before her. She kept her room, as was to be expected, and saw\r\nnobody, and only moved the household and superintended the arrangements\r\nin a muffled way through Thomas, who was an old servant, and knew "the\r\nways" of the house; but notwithstanding her seclusion and her honest\r\nsorrow, and her perfect observance of all the ordinary restraints of the\r\nmoment, it would be wrong to omit all mention of this feverish bustle of\r\nthinking which came into Lucilla\'s mind in her solitude. Of all that she\r\nhad to bear, it was the thing that vexed and irritated and distressed\r\nher the most--as if, she said to herself indignantly, she ought to have\r\nbeen able to think of anything! And the chances are that Lucilla, for\r\nsheer duty\'s sake, would have said, if anybody had asked, that of course\r\nshe had not thought of anything as yet; without being aware that the\r\nmere shock, and horror, and profound commotion had a great deal more to\r\ndo than anything else in producing that fluttering crowd of busy,\r\nvexatious speculations which had come, without any will of hers, into\r\nher heart.\r\n\r\nIt looked a dreadful change in one way as she looked at it, without\r\nwishing to look at it, in the solitude of her own room, where the blinds\r\nwere all down, and the snow sometimes came with a little thump against\r\nthe window, and where it was so dark that it was a comfort when night\r\ncame, and the lamp could be lighted. So far as Carlingford was\r\nconcerned, it would be almost as bad for Miss Marjoribanks as if she\r\nwere her father\'s widow instead of his daughter. To keep up a position\r\nof social importance in a single woman\'s house, unless, as she had\r\nherself lightly said so short a time since, she were awfully rich, would\r\nbe next to impossible. All that gave importance to the centre of\r\nsociety--the hospitable table, the open house--had come to an end with\r\nthe Doctor. Things could no more be as they had once been, in that\r\nrespect at least. She might stay in the house, and keep up to the\r\nfurthest extent possible to her its old traditions; but even to the\r\nutmost limit to which Lucilla could think it right to go it could never\r\nbe the same. This consciousness kept gleaming upon her as she sat in the\r\ndull daylight behind the closed blinds, with articles of mourning piled\r\nabout everywhere, and the gray dimness getting into her very eyes, and\r\nher mind distressed by the consciousness that she ought to have been\r\nunable to think; and the sadness of the prospect altogether was enough\r\nto stir up a reaction, in spite of herself, in Miss Marjoribanks\'s mind.\r\n\r\nAnd on the other side she would no doubt be very well off, and could go\r\nwherever she liked, and had no limit, except what was right and proper\r\nand becoming, to what she might please to do. She might go abroad if she\r\nliked, which perhaps is the first idea of the modern English mind when\r\nanything happens to it, and settle wherever she pleased, and arrange her\r\nmode of existence as seemed good in her own eyes. She would be an\r\nheiress in a moderate way, and Aunt Jemima was by this time absolutely\r\nat her disposal, and could be taken anywhere; and at Lucilla\'s age it\r\nwas quite impossible to predict what might not happen to a woman in such\r\na position. When these fairer possibilities gleamed into Lucilla\'s mind,\r\nit would be difficult to describe the anger and self-disgust with which\r\nshe reproached herself--for perhaps it was the first time that she had\r\nconsciously failed in maintaining a state of mind becoming the occasion;\r\nand though nobody but herself knew of it, the pain of the accusation was\r\nacute and bitter. But how could Miss Marjoribanks help it?--the mind\r\ntravels so much quicker than anything else, and goes so far, and makes\r\nits expeditions in such subtle, stealthy ways. She might begin by\r\nthinking of her dear papa, and yet, before she could dry her eyes, might\r\nbe off in the midst of one of these bewildering speculations. For\r\neverything was certain now so far as he was concerned; and everything\r\nwas so uncertain, and full of such unknown issues for herself. Thus the\r\ndark days before the funeral passed by--and everybody was very kind. Dr\r\nMarjoribanks was one of the props of the place, and all Carlingford\r\nbestirred itself to do him the final honours; and all her friends\r\nconspired how to save Lucilla from all possible trouble, and help her\r\nover the trial; and to see how much he was respected was the greatest of\r\nall possible comforts to her, as she said.\r\n\r\nThus it was that among the changes that everybody looked for, there\r\noccurred all at once this change which was entirely unexpected, and put\r\neverything else out of mind for the moment. For to tell the truth, Dr\r\nMarjoribanks was one of the men who, according to external appearance,\r\nneed never have died. There was nothing about him that wanted to be set\r\nright, no sort of loss, or failure, or misunderstanding, so far as\r\nanybody could see. An existence in which he could have his friends to\r\ndinner every week, and a good house, and good wine, and a very good\r\ntable, and nothing particular to put him out of his way, seemed in fact\r\nthe very ideal of the best life for the Doctor. There was nothing in him\r\nthat seemed to demand anything better, and it was confusing to try to\r\nfollow him into that which, no doubt, must be in all its fundamentals a\r\nvery different kind of world. He was a just man and a good man in his\r\nway, and had been kind to many people in his lifetime--but still he did\r\nnot seem to have that need of another rectifying, completer existence\r\nwhich most men have. There seemed no reason why he should die--a man who\r\nwas so well contented with this lower region in which many of us fare\r\nbadly, and where so few of us are contented. This was a fact which\r\nexercised a very confusing influence, even when they themselves were not\r\naware of it, on many people\'s minds. It was hard to think of him under\r\nany other circumstances, or identify him with angels and spirits--which\r\nfeeling on the whole made the regret for him a more poignant sort of\r\nregret.\r\n\r\nAnd they buried him with the greatest signs of respect. People from\r\ntwenty miles off sent their carriages, and all the George Street people\r\nshut their shops, and there was very little business done all day. Mr\r\nCavendish and Mr Ashburton walked side by side at the funeral, which was\r\nan affecting sight to see; and if anything more could have been done to\r\nshow their respect which was not done, the corporation of Carlingford\r\nwould have been sorry for it. And the snow still lay deep in all the\r\ncorners, though it had been trampled down all about the Doctor\'s house,\r\nwhere the lamp was not lighted now of nights; for what was the use of\r\nlighting the lamp, which was a kind of lighthouse in its way, and meant\r\nto point out succour and safety for the neighbours, when the physician\r\nhimself was lying beyond all hope of succour or aid? And all the Grange\r\nLane people retired in a sympathetic, awe-stricken way, and decided, or\r\nat least the ladies did, to see Lucilla next day, if she was able to see\r\nthem, and to find out whether she was going to make an effort, or what\r\nshe meant to do. And Mrs Chiley was so much better that she was able to\r\nbe up a little in the evening, though she scarcely could forgive\r\nherself, and still could not help thinking that it was she who had\r\nreally been sent for, and that the Doctor had been taken in mistake. And\r\nas for Lucilla, she sat in her room and cried, and thought of her\r\nfather\'s hand upon her shoulder--that last unusual caress which was more\r\ntouching to think of than a world of words. He had been fond of her and\r\nproud of her, and at the last moment he had showed it. And by times she\r\nseemed to feel again that lingering touch, and cried as if her heart\r\nwould break: and yet, for all that, she could not keep her thoughts\r\nsteady, nor prevent them from wandering to all kinds of profane\r\nout-of-door matters, and to considerations of the future, and estimates\r\nof her own position. It wounded her sadly to feel herself in such an\r\ninappropriate state of mind, but she could not help it; and then the\r\nwant of natural light and air oppressed her sorely, and she longed for\r\nthe evening, which felt a little more natural, and thought that at last\r\nshe might have a long talk with Aunt Jemima, who was a kind of refuge in\r\nher present loneliness, and gave her a means of escape at the same time\r\nfrom all this bustle and commotion of unbecoming thoughts.\r\n\r\nThis was enough surely for any one to have to encounter at one time; but\r\nthat very night another rumour began to murmur through Carlingford--a\r\nrumour more bewildering, more incredible still, than that of the\r\nDoctor\'s death, which the town had been obliged to confirm and\r\nacknowledge, and put its seal to. When the thing was first mentioned,\r\neverybody (who could find it in their heart to laugh) laughed loud in\r\nthe face of the first narrator with mingled scepticism and indignation.\r\nThey asked him what he meant by it, and ridiculed and scoffed at him to\r\nhis face. "Lucilla will be the richest woman in Grange Lane," people\r\nsaid; "everybody in Carlingford knows that." But after this statement\r\nhad been made, the town began to listen. It was obliged to listen, for\r\nother witnesses came in to confirm the story. It never might have been\r\nfound out while the Doctor lived, for he had a great practice, and made\r\na great deal of money; but now that he was dead, nothing could be hid.\r\nHe was dead, and he had made an elaborate will, which was all as just\r\nand righteous as a will could be; but after the will was read, it was\r\nfound out that everything named in it had disappeared like a bubble.\r\nInstead of being the richest, Dr Marjoribanks was one of the poorest\r\nmen in Carlingford when he shut his door behind him on that snowy night.\r\nIt was a revelation which took the town perfectly by storm, and startled\r\neverybody out of their senses. Lucilla\'s plans, which she thought so\r\nwicked, went out all of a sudden, in a certain dull amaze and dismay, to\r\nwhich no words could give any expression. Such was the second\r\ninconceivable reverse of fortune which happened to Miss Marjoribanks,\r\nmore unexpected, more incomprehensible still than the other, in the very\r\nmidst of her most important activities and hopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XLIV_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the first whisper of the way in which she was--as people\r\nsay--"left" reached Lucilla, her first feeling was incredulity. It was\r\nconveyed to her by Aunt Jemima, who came to her in her room after the\r\nfuneral with a face blanched with dismay. Miss Marjoribanks took it for\r\ngrief; and, though she did not look for so much feeling from Mrs John,\r\nwas pleased and comforted that her aunt should really lament her poor\r\npapa. It was a compliment which, in the softened and sorrowful state of\r\nLucilla\'s mind, went to her heart. Aunt Jemima came up and kissed her in\r\na hasty excited way, which showed genuine and spontaneous emotion, and\r\nwas not like the solemn pomp with which sympathising friends generally\r\nembrace a mourner; and then she made Lucilla sit down by the fire and\r\nheld her hands. "My poor child," said Aunt Jemima--"my poor, dear,\r\nsacrificed child! you know, Lucilla, how fond I am of you, and you can\r\nalways come to me----"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, dear Aunt Jemima," said Miss Marjoribanks, though she was a\r\nlittle puzzled. "You are the only relative I have, and I knew you would\r\nnot forsake me. What should I do without you at such a time? I am sure\r\nit is what dear papa would have wished----"\r\n\r\n"Lucilla," cried Mrs John impulsively, "I know it is natural you should\r\ncry for your father; but when you know all,--you that never knew what it\r\nwas to be without money--that never were straitened even, or obliged to\r\ngive up things, like most other young women. Oh, my dear, they said I\r\nwas to prepare you, but how can I prepare you? I feel as if I never\r\ncould forgive my brother-in-law; that he should bring you up like this,\r\nand then----"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" said Miss Marjoribanks, drying her tears. "If it is\r\nanything new, tell me, but don\'t speak so of--of----What is it? say it\r\nright out."\r\n\r\n"Lucilla," said Aunt Jemima solemnly, "you think you have a great deal\r\nof courage, and now is your time to show it. He has left you without a\r\nfarthing--he that was always thought to be so rich. It is quite true\r\nwhat I am saying. He has gone and died and left nothing, Lucilla. Now I\r\nhave told you; and oh, my poor, dear, injured child," cried Mrs John,\r\nwith fervour, "as long as I have a home there will be room in it for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nBut Lucilla put her aunt away softly when she was about to fall upon her\r\nneck. Miss Marjoribanks was struck dumb; her heart seemed to stop\r\nbeating for the moment. "It is quite impossible--it cannot be true," she\r\nsaid, and gave a gasp to recover her breath. Then Mrs John came down\r\nupon her with facts, proving it to be true--showing how Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s money was invested, and how it had been lost. She made a\r\nterrible muddle of it, no doubt, but Lucilla was not very clear about\r\nbusiness details any more than her aunt, and she did not move nor say a\r\nword while the long, involved, endless narrative went on. She kept\r\nsaying it was impossible in her heart for half of the time, and then she\r\ncrept nearer the fire and shivered, and said nothing even to herself,\r\nand did not even seem to listen, but knew that it must be true. It would\r\nbe vain to attempt to say that it was not a terrible blow to Lucilla;\r\nher strength was weakened already by grief and solitude and want of\r\nfood, for she could not find it in her heart to go on eating her\r\nordinary meals as if nothing had happened; and all of a sudden she felt\r\nthe cold seize her, and drew closer and closer to the fire. The thoughts\r\nwhich she had been thinking in spite of herself, and for which she had\r\nso greatly condemned herself, went out with a sudden distinctness, as if\r\nit had been a lamp going out and leaving the room in darkness, and a\r\nsudden sense of utter gloom and cold and bewildering uncertainty came\r\nover Lucilla. When she lifted her eyes from the fire, into which she had\r\nbeen gazing, it almost surprised her to find herself still in this warm\r\nroom where there was every appliance for comfort, and where her entire\r\nwardrobe of new mourning--everything, as Aunt Jemima said, that a woman\r\ncould desire--was piled up on the bed. It was impossible that she could\r\nbe a penniless creature, left on her own resources, without father or\r\nsupporter or revenue; and yet--good heavens! could it be true?\r\n\r\n"If it is true, Aunt Jemima," said Lucilla, "I must try to bear it; but\r\nmy poor head feels all queer. I\'d rather not think any more about it\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"How can you help thinking about it, Lucilla?" cried Mrs John. "I can\r\nthink of nothing else; and I am not so much concerned as you."\r\n\r\nUpon which Lucilla rose and kissed Aunt Jemima, though her head was all\r\nconfused and she had noises in her ears. "I don\'t think we are much like\r\neach other, you know," she said. "Did you hear how Mrs Chiley was? I am\r\nsure she will be very sorry;" and with that Miss Marjoribanks softened,\r\nand felt a little comforted, and cried again--not for the money, but for\r\nher father. "If you are going downstairs, I think I will come down to\r\ntea, Aunt Jemima," she said. But after Mrs John had gone away full of\r\nwonder at her philosophy, Lucilla drew close to the fire again and took\r\nher head between her hands and tried to think what it meant. Could it be\r\ntrue? Instead of the heiress, in a good position, who could go abroad or\r\nanywhere, and do anything she liked, was it possible that she was only a\r\npenniless single woman with nobody to look to, and nothing to live on?\r\nSuch an extraordinary incomprehensible revolution might well make any\r\none feel giddy. The solid house and the comfortable room, and her own\r\nsober brain, which was not in the way of being put off its balance,\r\nseemed to turn round and round as she looked into the fire. Lucilla was\r\nnot one to throw the blame upon her father, as Mrs John had done. On the\r\ncontrary she was sorry, profoundly sorry for him, and made such a\r\npicture to herself of what his feelings must have been, when he went\r\ninto his room that night and knew that all his hard-earned fortune was\r\ngone, that it made her weep the deepest tears for him that she had yet\r\nshed. "Poor papa!" she said to herself; and as she was not much given to\r\nemploying her imagination in this way, and realising the feeling of\r\nothers, the effect was all the greater now. If he had but told her, and\r\nput off a share of the burden from his own shoulders on to hers who\r\ncould have borne it! but the Doctor had never done justice to Lucilla\'s\r\nqualities. This, amid her general sense of confusion and dizziness and\r\ninsecurity, was the only clear thought that struck Miss Marjoribanks;\r\nand that it was very cold and must be freezing outside; and how did the\r\npoor people manage who had not all her present advantages? She tried to\r\nput away this revelation from her, as she had said to Aunt Jemima, and\r\nkeep it for a little at arm\'s length, and get a night\'s rest in the\r\nmeantime, and so be able to bring a clear head to the contemplation of\r\nit to-morrow, which was the most judicious thing to do. But when the\r\nmind has been stimulated by such a shock, Solomon himself, one would\r\nsuppose, could scarcely, however clearly he might perceive what was\r\nbest, take the judicious passive way. When Lucilla got up from where she\r\nwas crouching before the fire, she felt so giddy that she could scarcely\r\nstand. Her head was all queer, as she had said, and she had a singing in\r\nher ears. She herself seemed to have changed along with her position. An\r\nhour or two before, she could have answered for her own steadiness and\r\nself-possession in almost any circumstances, but now the blood seemed to\r\nbe running a race in her veins, and the strangest noises hummed in her\r\nears. She felt ashamed of her weakness, but she could not help it; and\r\nthen she was weak with grief and excitement and comparative fasting,\r\nwhich told for something, probably, in her inability to bear so\r\nunlooked-for a blow.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Marjoribanks thought it was best to go down to the drawing-room\r\nfor tea, as she had said. To see everything just as it had been, utterly\r\nindifferent and unconscious of what had happened, made her cry, and\r\nrelieved her giddiness by reviving her grief; and then the next minute a\r\nbewildering wonder seized her as to what would become of this\r\ndrawing-room, the scene of her triumphs--who would live in it, and whom\r\nthe things would go to--which made her sick, and brought back the\r\nsinging in her ears. But on the whole she took tea very quietly with\r\nAunt Jemima, who kept breaking into continual snatches of lamentation,\r\nbut was always checked by Lucilla\'s composed looks. If she had not heard\r\nthis extraordinary news, which made the world turn round with her, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks would have felt that soft hush of exhaustion and grief\r\nsubdued which, when the grief is not too urgent, comes after all is\r\nover; and even now she felt a certain comfort in the warm firelight and\r\nthe change out of her own room--where she had been living shut up, with\r\nthe blinds down, and the black dresses everywhere about, for so many\r\ndreary days.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown, who had charge of Dr Marjoribanks\'s affairs, came next day\r\nand explained everything to Lucilla. The lawyer had had one short\r\ninterview with his client after the news came, and Dr Marjoribanks had\r\nborne it like a man. His face had changed a little, and he had sat down,\r\nwhich he was not in the habit of doing, and drawn a kind of shivering\r\nlong breath; and then he had said, "Poor Lucilla!" to himself. This was\r\nall Mr Brown could say about the effect the shock had on the Doctor. And\r\nthere was something in this very scanty information which gave Lucilla a\r\nnew pang of sorrow and consolation. "And he patted me on the shoulder\r\nthat last night," she said, with tender tears; and felt she had never\r\nloved her father so well in all her life--which is one of the sweeter\r\nuses of death which many must have experienced, but which belonged to a\r\nmore exquisite and penetrating kind of emotion than was common to\r\nLucilla.\r\n\r\n"I thought he looked a little broken when he went out," said Mr Brown,\r\n"but full of pluck and spirit, as he always was. \'I am making a good\r\ndeal of money, and I _may_ live long enough to lay by a little still,\'\r\nwere the last words he said to me. I remember he put a kind of emphasis\r\non the _may_. Perhaps he knew he was not so strong as he looked. He was\r\na good man, Miss Marjoribanks, and there is nobody that has not some\r\nkind thing to tell of him," said the lawyer, with a certain moisture in\r\nhis eyes; for there was nobody in Carlingford who did not miss the old\r\nDoctor, and John Brown was very tender-hearted in his way.\r\n\r\n"But nobody can know what a good father he was," said Lucilla, with a\r\nsob; and she meant it with all her heart, thinking chiefly of his hand\r\non her shoulder that last night, and of the "Poor Lucilla!" in John\r\nBrown\'s office; though, after all, perhaps, it was not chiefly as a\r\ntender father that Dr Marjoribanks shone, though he gave his daughter\r\nall she wanted or asked for. Her grief was so true, and so little\r\ntinctured by any of that indignation over the unexpected loss, which\r\nAunt Jemima had not been able to conceal, that John Brown was quite\r\ntouched, and felt his heart warm to Lucilla. He explained it all very\r\nfully to her when she was composed enough to understand him; and as he\r\nwent through all the details the giddiness came back, and once more Miss\r\nMarjoribanks felt the world running round, and heard his statement\r\nthrough the noises in her ears. All this settled down, however, into a\r\ncertain distinctness as John Brown, who was very clear-headed and good\r\nat making a concise statement, went on; and gradually the gyrations\r\nbecame slower and slower, and the great universe became solid once more,\r\nand held to its moorings under Lucilla\'s feet, and she ceased to hear\r\nthat supernatural hum and buzz. The vague shadows of chaos and ruin\r\ndispersed, and through them she saw once more the real aspect of things.\r\nShe was not quite penniless. There was the house, which was a very good\r\nhouse, and some little corners and scraps of money in the Funds, which\r\nwere Lucilla\'s very own, and could not be lost; and last of all there\r\nwas the business--the best practice in Carlingford, and entire command\r\nof Grange Lane.\r\n\r\n"But what does that matter?" said Lucilla; "if poor papa had retired\r\nindeed, as I used to beg him to do, and parted with it----But everybody\r\nhas begun to send for Dr Rider already," she said, in an aggrieved\r\nvoice; and then for the first time John Brown remembered, to his\r\nconfusion, that there was once said to be "something between" Miss\r\nMarjoribanks and Dr Rider; which complicated the affair in the most\r\nuncomfortable way.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "and of course that would make it much more difficult to\r\nbring in another man; but Rider is a very honourable young fellow, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks----"\r\n\r\n"He is not so very young," said Lucilla. "He is quite as old as I am,\r\nthough no one ever would think so. I am sure he is honourable, but what\r\nhas that to do with it? And I do think Mrs Chiley might have done\r\nwithout--anybody else: for a day or two, considering when it was----"\r\n\r\nAnd here she stopped to cry, unreasonably, but yet very naturally; for\r\nit did feel hard that in the house to which Dr Marjoribanks\'s last visit\r\nhad been paid, another doctor should have been called in next day.\r\n\r\n"What I meant to say," said John Brown, "was, that Dr Rider, though he\r\nis not rich, and could not pay a large sum of money down, would be very\r\nglad to make some arrangement. He is very anxious about it, and he\r\nseemed himself to think that if you knew his circumstances you would not\r\nbe disinclined to----But as I did not at all know----"\r\n\r\nLucilla caught, as it were, and met, and forced to face her, her\r\ninformant\'s embarrassed, hesitating look. "You say this," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, "because people used to say there was something between\r\nus, and you think I may have some feeling about it. But there never was\r\nanything between us. Anybody with a quarter of an eye could have seen\r\nthat he was going out of his senses about that little Australian girl.\r\nAnd I am rather fond of men that are in love--it shows they have some\r\ngood in them. But it is dreadful to talk of such things now," said\r\nLucilla, with a sigh of self-reproach. "If Dr Rider has any arrangement\r\nto propose, I should like to give him the preference, please. You see\r\nthey have begun to send for him already in Grange Lane."\r\n\r\n"I will do whatever you think proper," said John Brown, who was rather\r\nscared, and very much impressed by Miss Marjoribanks\'s candour. Dr Rider\r\nhad been the first love of Mr Brown\'s own wife, and the lawyer had a\r\ncurious kind of satisfaction in thinking that this silly young fellow\r\nhad thus lost two admirable women, and that probably the little\r\nAustralian was equally inferior to Miss Marjoribanks and Mrs Brown. He\r\nought to have been grateful that Dr Rider had left the latter lady to\r\nhis own superior discrimination--and so he was; and yet it gave him a\r\ncertain odd satisfaction to think that the Doctor was not so happy as he\r\nmight have been. He went away fully warranted to receive Dr Rider\'s\r\nproposition, and even, to a certain extent, to decide upon it--and\r\nLucilla threw herself back in her chair in the silent drawing-room, from\r\nwhich Aunt Jemima had discreetly withdrawn, and began to think over the\r\nreality of her position as she now saw it for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe sense of bewildering revolution and change was over; for, strangely\r\nenough, the greater a change is the more easily the mind, after the\r\nfirst shock, accepts and gets accustomed to it. It was over, and the\r\nworld felt steady once more under Lucilla\'s feet, and she sat down, not\r\nprecisely amid the ruins of her happiness, but still in the presence of\r\nmany an imagination overthrown, to look at her real position. It was\r\nnot, after all, utter poverty, misery, and destitution, as at the first\r\nglance she had believed. According to what John Brown had said, and a\r\nrapid calculation which Lucilla had herself made in passing, something\r\napproaching two hundred a year would be left to her--just a small single\r\nwoman\'s revenue, as she thought to herself. Two hundred a year! All at\r\nonce there came into Miss Marjoribanks\'s mind a sudden vision of the two\r\nMiss Ravenswoods, who had lived in that pretty set of rooms over\r\nElsworthy\'s shop, facing into Grange Lane, and who had kept a lady\'s\r\nmaid, and asked the best people in the place to tea, upon a very\r\nsimilar income, and how their achievements had been held up to everybody\r\nas a model of what genteel economy could do. She thought of them, and\r\nher heart sank within her; for it was not in Lucilla\'s nature to live\r\nwithout a sphere, nor to disjoin herself from her fellow-creatures, nor\r\nto give up entirely the sovereign position she had held for so many\r\nyears. Whatever she might ultimately do, it was clear that, in the\r\nmeantime, she could not make up her mind to any such giving up of the\r\nbattle as that. And then there was the house. She might let it to the\r\nRiders, and add probably another hundred a year to her income; for\r\nthough it was an excellent house, and worth more than a hundred a year,\r\nstill there was no competition for houses in Grange Lane, and the new\r\nDoctor was the only probable tenant. And, to tell the truth, though\r\nLucilla was very reasonable, it went to her heart at the present moment\r\nto think of letting the house to the new Doctor, and having the patients\r\ncome as usual, and the lamp lighted as of old, and nothing changed\r\nexcept the central figure of all. She ought to have been above such\r\nsentimental ideas when a whole hundred pounds a year was in question;\r\nbut she was not, which of itself was a strange phenomenon. If she could\r\nhave made up her mind to that, there were a great many things that she\r\nmight have done. She might still have gone abroad, and to some extent\r\ntaken a limited share in what was going on in some section of English\r\nsociety on the Continent. Or she might have gone to one of the mild\r\ncentres of a similar kind of life in England. But such a prospect did\r\nnot offer many attractions to Miss Marjoribanks. If she had been rich,\r\nit would have been different. Thus there gradually dawned upon her the\r\ngerm of the plan she ultimately adopted, and which was the only one that\r\ncommended itself to her feelings. Going away was expensive and\r\ntroublesome at the best; and even at Elsworthy\'s, if she could have made\r\nup her mind to such an expedient, she would have been charged a pound a\r\nweek for the rooms alone, not to speak of all kinds of extras, and never\r\nhaving the satisfaction of feeling yourself in your own place. Under all\r\nthe circumstances, it was impressed upon Lucilla\'s mind that her natural\r\ncourse was to stay still where she was, and make no change. Why should\r\nshe make any change? The house was her own, and did not cost anything,\r\nand if Nancy would but stand by her and one good maid----It was a\r\nventure; but still Lucilla felt as if she might be equal to it. Though\r\nshe was no mathematician, Miss Marjoribanks was very clever at mental\r\narithmetic in a practical sort of way. She put down lines upon lines of\r\nfigures in her head while she sat musing in her chair, and worked them\r\nout with wonderful skill and speed and accuracy. And the more she\r\nthought of it, the more it seemed to her that this was the thing to do.\r\nWhy should she retreat and leave her native soil and the neighbourhood\r\nof all her friends because she was poor and in trouble? Lucilla was not\r\nashamed of being poor--nor even frightened by it, now that she\r\nunderstood what it was--any more than she would have been frightened,\r\nafter the first shock, had her poverty even been much more absolute. She\r\nwas standing alone at this moment as upon a little island of as yet\r\nundisturbed seclusion and calm, and she knew very well that outside a\r\nperfect sea of good advice would surge round her as soon as she was\r\nvisible. In these circumstances Lucilla took by instinct the only wise\r\ncourse: she made up her mind there and then with a perfect unanimity\r\nwhich is seldom to be gained when counsellors are admitted. And what she\r\ndecided upon, as was to be expected from her character, was not to fly\r\nfrom her misfortune and the scene of it, but to confront fate and take\r\nup her lawful burden and stay still in her own house. It was the wisest\r\nand the easiest, and at the same time the most heroic course to adopt,\r\nand she knew beforehand that it was one which would be approved of by\r\nnobody. All this Lucilla steadily faced and considered and made up her\r\nmind to while she sat alone; although silence and solitude and\r\ndesolation seemed to have suddenly come in and taken possession all\r\naround her of the once gay and brilliant room.\r\n\r\nShe had just made her final decision when she was rejoined by her aunt,\r\nwho, everybody said, was at this trying moment like a mother to Lucilla.\r\nYet Aunt Jemima, too, had changed a little since her brother-in-law\'s\r\ndeath. She was very fond of Miss Marjoribanks, and meant every word she\r\nhad said about giving her a home, and still meant it. But she did not\r\nfeel so certain now as she had done about Tom\'s love for his cousin, nor\r\nat all anxious to have him come home just at this moment; and for\r\nanother thing, she had got a way of prowling about the house and looking\r\nat the furniture in a speculative, auctioneering sort of way. "It must\r\nbe all sold, of course," Aunt Jemima had said to herself, "and I may as\r\nwell look what things would suit me; there is a little chiffonier that I\r\nhave always wanted for my drawing-room, and Lucilla would like to see a\r\nfew of the old things about her, poor dear." With this idea Mrs John\r\ngave herself a great deal of unnecessary fatigue, and gave much offence\r\nto the servants by making pilgrimages all over the house, turning up at\r\nthe most unlikely places and poking about in the least frequented rooms.\r\nIt was a perfectly virtuous and even amiable thing to do, for it was\r\nbetter, as she reasoned, that they should go to her than to a stranger,\r\nand it would be nice for Lucilla to feel that she had some of the old\r\nthings about her; but then such delicate motives are seldom appreciated\r\nby the homely critics downstairs.\r\n\r\nIt was with something of this same air that she came into the\r\ndrawing-room, where Lucilla was. She could not help laying her hand in a\r\nsuggestive sort of way on a small table which she had to pass, as if she\r\nwere saying to herself (as indeed she was saying), "The veneer has been\r\nbroken off at that side, and the foot is mended; it will bring very\r\nlittle; and yet it looks well when you don\'t look too close." Such were\r\nthe ideas with which Aunt Jemima\'s mind was filled. But yet she came\r\nforward with a great deal of sympathy and curiosity, and forgot about\r\nthe furniture in presence of her afflicted niece.\r\n\r\n"Did he tell you anything, Lucilla?" said Mrs John; "of course he must\r\nhave told you something--but anything satisfactory, I mean."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know if you can call it satisfactory," said Lucilla, with a\r\nsudden rush of softer thoughts; "but it was a comfort to hear it. He\r\ntold me something about dear papa, Aunt Jemima. After he had heard of\r\n_that_, you know--all that he said was, Poor Lucilla! And don\'t you\r\nremember how he put his hand on my shoulder that last night? I am\r\nso--so--glad he did it," sobbed Miss Marjoribanks. It may be supposed it\r\nwas an abrupt transition from her calculations; but after all it was\r\nonly a different branch of the same subject; and Lucilla in all her life\r\nhad never before shed such poignant and tender tears.\r\n\r\n"He might well say, Poor Lucilla!" said Mrs John--"brought up as you\r\nhave been, my dear; and did not you hear anything more important?--I\r\nmean, more important in a worldly point of view," Aunt Jemima added,\r\ncorrecting herself, "of course, it must be the greatest comfort to hear\r\nsomething about your poor papa."\r\n\r\nAnd then Lucilla unfolded John Brown\'s further particulars to her\r\nsurprised hearer. Mrs John lived upon a smallish income herself, and she\r\nwas not so contemptuous of the two hundred a year. "And the house," she\r\nsaid--"the house would bring you in another hundred, Lucilla. The\r\nRiders, I am sure, would take it directly, and perhaps a great part of\r\nthe furniture too. Three hundred would not be so bad for a single woman.\r\nDid you say anything about the furniture, my dear?" Aunt Jemima added,\r\nhalf regretfully, for she did feel that she would be sorry to lose that\r\nchiffonier.\r\n\r\n"I think I shall stay in the house," said Lucilla; "you may think it\r\nsilly, Aunt Jemima, but I was born in it, and----"\r\n\r\n"Stay in the house!" Mrs John said, with a gasp. She did not think it\r\nsilly, but simple madness, and so she told her niece. If Lucilla could\r\nnot make up her mind to Elsworthy\'s, there was Brighton and Bath and\r\nCheltenham, and a hundred other places where a single woman might be\r\nvery comfortable on three hundred a year. And to lose a third part of\r\nher income for a piece of sentiment was so utterly unlike any conception\r\nAunt Jemima had ever formed of her niece. It _was_ unlike Miss\r\nMarjoribanks; but there are times of life when even the most reasonable\r\npeople are inconsistent. Lucilla, though she felt it was open to grave\r\ncriticism, felt only more confirmed in her resolution by her aunt\'s\r\nremarks. She heard a voice Aunt Jemima could not hear, and that voice\r\nsaid, Stay!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XLV_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be allowed that Lucilla\'s decision caused very general surprise\r\nin Carlingford, where people had been disposed to think that she would\r\nbe rather glad, now that things were so changed, to get away. To be sure\r\nit was not known for some time; but everybody\'s idea was that, being\r\nthus left alone in the world, and in circumstances so reduced, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks naturally would go to live with somebody. Perhaps with her\r\naunt, who had something, though she was not rich; perhaps, after a\r\nlittle, to visit about among her friends, of whom she had so many.\r\nNobody doubted that Lucilla would abdicate at once, and a certain\r\nuneasy, yet delicious, sense of freedom had already stolen into the\r\nhearts of some of the ladies in Grange Lane. They lamented, it is true,\r\nthe state of chaos into which everything would fall, and the dreadful\r\nloss Miss Marjoribanks would be to society; but still, freedom is a\r\nnoble thing, and Lucilla\'s subjects contemplated their emancipation with\r\na certain guilty delight. It was, at the same time, a most fertile\r\nsubject of discussion in Carlingford, and gave rise to all those lively\r\nspeculations and consultations, and oft-renewed comparing of notes,\r\nwhich take the place of bets in the feminine community. The Carlingford\r\nladies as good as betted upon Lucilla, whether she would go with her\r\naunt, or pay Mrs Beverley a visit at the Deanery, or retire to Mount\r\nPleasant for a little, where those good old Miss Blounts were so fond of\r\nher. Each of these opinions had its backers, if it is not profane to say\r\nso; and the discussion which of them Miss Marjoribanks would choose\r\nwaxed very warm. It almost put the election out of people\'s heads; and\r\nindeed the election had been sadly damaged in interest and social\r\nimportance by the sad and most unexpected event which had just happened\r\nin Grange Lane.\r\n\r\nBut when the fact was really known, it would be difficult to describe\r\nthe sense of guilt and horror which filled many innocent bosoms. The\r\nbound of freedom had been premature--liberty and equality had not come\r\nyet, notwithstanding that too early unwise _\xe9lan_ of republican\r\nsatisfaction. It was true that she was in deep mourning, and that for a\r\nyear, at least, society must be left to its own devices; and it was\r\ntrue, also, that she was poor--which might naturally be supposed a\r\ndamper upon her energies--but, at the same time, Carlingford knew its\r\nLucilla. As long as she remained in Grange Lane, even though retired and\r\nin crape, the constitutional monarch was still present among her\r\nsubjects; and nobody could usurp her place or show that utter\r\nindifference to her regulations which some revolutionaries had dreamed\r\nof. Such an idea would have gone direct in the face of the British\r\nConstitution, and the sense of the community would have been dead\r\nagainst it. But everybody who had speculated upon her proceedings\r\ndisapproved of Lucilla in her most unlooked-for resolution. Some could\r\nnot think how she could bear it, staying on there when everything was so\r\nchanged; and some said it was a weakness they could never have believed\r\nto exist in her; and some--for there are spiteful people\r\neverywhere--breathed the names of Cavendish and Ashburton, the rival\r\ncandidates, and hinted that Miss Marjoribanks had something in her mind\r\nto justify her lingering. If Lucilla had not been supported by a\r\nconscious sense of rectitude, she must have broken down before this\r\nuniversal disapprobation. Not a soul in the world except one supported\r\nher in her resolution, and that was perhaps, of all others, the one\r\nleast likely to be able to judge.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not for want of opportunity to go elsewhere. Aunt Jemima, as\r\nhas been seen, did not lose an instant in offering the shelter of her\r\nhouse to her niece; and Mrs Beverley wrote the longest, kindest, most\r\nincoherent letter begging her dear Lucilla to come to her immediately\r\nfor a long visit, and adding, that though she had to go out a good deal\r\ninto society, she needn\'t mind, for that everything she could think of\r\nwould be done to make her comfortable; to which Dr Beverley himself, who\r\nwas now a dean, added an equally kind postscript, begging Miss\r\nMarjoribanks to make her home at the Deanery "until she saw how things\r\nwere to be." "He would have found me a place, perhaps," Lucilla said,\r\nwhen she folded up the letter--and this was a terrible mode of\r\nexpression to the genteel ears of Mrs John.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would not use such words, my dear," said Aunt Jemima; "even\r\nif you had been as poor as you thought, my house would always have been\r\na home for you. Thank Heaven I have enough for both; you never needed to\r\nhave thought, under any circumstances, of taking a--a situation. It is a\r\nthing I could never have consented to,"--which was a very handsome thing\r\nof Aunt Jemima to say.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, aunt," said Lucilla, but she sighed; for, though it was very\r\nkind, what was Miss Marjoribanks to have done with herself in such a\r\ndowager establishment? And then Colonel Chiley came in, who had also his\r\nproposal to make.\r\n\r\n"_She_ sent me," the Colonel said; "it\'s been a sad business for us all,\r\nLucilla; I don\'t know when I have felt anything more; and as for her,\r\nyou know, she has never held up her head since----"\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley!" Miss Marjoribanks said, unable to resist the old\r\naffection; "and yet I heard she had sent for Dr Rider directly," Lucilla\r\nadded. She knew it was quite natural, and perhaps quite necessary, but\r\nthen it did seem hard that his own friends should be the first to\r\nreplace her dear papa.\r\n\r\n"It was I did that," said the Colonel. "What was a man to do? I was\r\nhorribly cut up, but I could not stand and see her making herself worse;\r\nand I said you had too much sense to mind----"\r\n\r\n"So I ought," said Lucilla, with penitence, "but when I remembered where\r\nhe was last, the very last place----"\r\n\r\nIt was hard upon the Colonel to stand by and see a woman cry. It was a\r\nthing he could never stand, as he had always said to his wife. He took\r\nthe poker, which was his favourite resource, and made one of his\r\ntremendous dashes at the fire, to give Lucilla time to recover herself,\r\nand then he turned to Aunt Jemima, who sat pensively by:\r\n\r\n"_She_ sent me," said the Colonel, who did not think his wife needed any\r\nother name--"not that I would not have come of my own accord; we want\r\nLucilla to go to us, you see. I don\'t know what plans she may have been\r\nmaking, but we\'re both very fond of her--she knows that. I think, if you\r\nhave not settled upon anything, the best that Lucilla can do is to come\r\nto us. She\'ll be the same as at home, and always somebody to look after\r\nher----"\r\n\r\nThe old Colonel was standing before the fire, wavering a little on his\r\nlong unsteady old legs, and looking wonderfully well preserved, and old\r\nand feeble; and Lucilla, though she was in mourning, was so full of life\r\nand force in her way. It was a curious sort of protection to offer her,\r\nand yet it was real protection, and love and succour, though, Heaven\r\nknows! it might not perhaps last out the year.\r\n\r\n"I am sure, Colonel Chiley, it is a very kind offer," said Aunt Jemima,\r\n"and I would have been thankful if she could have made up her mind to go\r\nwith me. But I must say she has taken a very queer notion into her\r\nhead--a thing I should never have expected from Lucilla--she says she\r\nwill stay here."\r\n\r\n"Here?--ah--eh--what does she mean by here?" said the Colonel.\r\n\r\n"_Here_, Colonel Chiley, in this great big melancholy house. I have been\r\nthinking about it, and talking about it till my head goes round and\r\nround. Unless she were to take Inmates," said Aunt Jemima, in a resigned\r\nand doleful voice. As for the Colonel, he was petrified, and for a long\r\ntime had not a word to say.\r\n\r\n"_Here!_--By Jove, I think she must have lost her senses," said the old\r\nsoldier. "Why, Lucilla, I--I thought--wasn\'t there something about the\r\nmoney being lost? You couldn\'t keep up this house under a--fifteen\r\nhundred a year at least; the Doctor spent a mint of money;--you must be\r\ngoing out of your senses. And to have all the sick people coming, and\r\nthe bell ringing of nights. Bless my soul! it would kill anybody," said\r\nColonel Chiley. "Put on your bonnet, and come out with me; shutting her\r\nup here, and letting her cry, and so forth--I don\'t say it ain\'t\r\nnatural--I\'m terribly cut up myself whenever I think of it; but it\'s\r\nbeen too much for her head," said the Colonel, with anxiety and\r\nconsternation mingling in his face.\r\n\r\n"Unless she were to take Inmates, you know," said Aunt Jemima, in a\r\nsepulchral voice. There was something in the word that seemed to carry\r\nout to a point of reality much beyond anything he had dreamt of, the\r\nsuggestion Colonel Chiley had just made.\r\n\r\n"Inmates! Lord bless my soul! what do you mean, ma\'am?" said the old\r\nsoldier. "Lucilla, put on your bonnet directly, and come and have a\r\nlittle fresh air. She\'ll soon be an inmate herself if we leave her\r\nhere," the Colonel said. They were all very sad and grave, and yet it\r\nwas a droll scene; and then the old hero offered Lucilla his arm, and\r\nled her to the door. "You\'ll find me in the hall as soon as you are\r\nready," he said, in tones half gruff, half tender, and was glad to go\r\ndownstairs, though it was cold, and put on his greatcoat with the aid of\r\nThomas, and stand warming the tips of his boots at the hall fire. As\r\nfor Lucilla, she obeyed him without a word; and it was with his unsteady\r\nbut kind old arm to lean upon that she first saw how the familiar world\r\nlooked through the mist of this strange change that had come over it,\r\nand through the blackness of her crape veil.\r\n\r\nBut though she succeeded in satisfying her friends that she had made up\r\nher mind, she did not secure their approval. There were so many\r\nobjections to her plan. "If you had been rich even, I don\'t think I\r\nshould have approved of it, Lucilla," Mrs Chiley said, with tears; "and\r\nI think we could have made you happy here." So the good old lady spoke,\r\nlooking round her pretty room, which was so warm and cheery and bright,\r\nand where the Colonel, neat and precise as if he had come out of a box,\r\nwas standing poking the fire. It looked all very solid and substantial,\r\nand yet it was as unstable as any gossamer that the careless passenger\r\nmight brush away. The two good people were so old that they had\r\nforgotten to remember they were old. But neither did Lucilla think of\r\nthat. This was really what she thought and partly said:\r\n\r\n"I am in my own house, that wants no expense nor changing, and Nancy is\r\ngetting old, and does not mind standing by me. And it is not so much\r\ntrouble after all keeping everything nice when there is no gentleman\r\ncoming in, and nothing else to do. And, besides, I don\'t mean to be\r\nLucilla Marjoribanks for ever and ever." This was the general scope,\r\nwithout going into all the details, of what Lucilla said.\r\n\r\nBut, at the same time, though she was so happy as not to be disturbed in\r\nher decision, or made uncomfortable, either by lamentation or\r\nremonstrance, and had no doubt in her mind that she was doing right, it\r\nwas disagreeable to Miss Marjoribanks to go thus in the face of all her\r\nfriends. She went home by herself, and the house did look dreary from\r\nthe outside. It was just as it had always been, for none of the servants\r\nwere dismissed as yet, nor any external change made; but still a look as\r\nif it had fallen asleep--a look as if it too had died somehow, and only\r\npretended to be a house and home--was apparent, in the aspect of the\r\nplace; and when the servants were gone, and nobody remained except\r\nLucilla and her faithful Nancy, and a young maid--which must be the\r\nfurthest limit of Miss Marjoribanks\'s household, and difficult enough to\r\nmaintain upon two hundred a year--what would it look like? This thought\r\nwas more discouraging than any remonstrances; and it was with a heavy\r\nheart that Lucilla re-entered her solitary house. She told Thomas to\r\nfollow her upstairs; and when she sank, tired, into a chair, and put up\r\nher veil before commencing to speak to him, it was all she could do to\r\nkeep from crying. The depressing influences of this sad week had told so\r\nmuch on her, that she was quite fatigued by her walk to see Mrs Chiley;\r\nand Thomas, too, knew why he had been called, and stood in a formal\r\nmanner before her, with his hands crossed, against the closed door. When\r\nshe put back her thick black veil, the last climax of painful change\r\ncame upon Miss Marjoribanks. She did not feel as if she were Lucilla; so\r\ndiscouraged and depressed and pale, and tired with her walk as she was,\r\nwith all sorts of projects and plans so quenched out of her; almost if\r\nshe had been charged with being somebody else, the imputation was one\r\nwhich she could not have denied.\r\n\r\n"Thomas," she said faintly, "I think I ought to speak to you myself\r\nabout all that has happened--we are such old friends, and you have been\r\nsuch a good kind servant. You know I shan\'t be able to keep up----"\r\n\r\n"And sorry we all was, Miss, to hear it," said Thomas, when Lucilla\'s\r\nutterance failed. "I am sure there never was a better master, though\r\nparticular; and for a comfortabler house----"\r\n\r\n"If I had been as poor papa expected to leave me," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, after a little pause, "everything would have gone on as\r\nusual: but after your long service here, and so many people as know you,\r\nThomas, you will have no difficulty in getting as good a place: and you\r\nknow that anything I can say----"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Miss," said Thomas; and then he made a pause. "It was not\r\nexactly that as I was thinking of; I\'ve set my heart, this many a day,\r\non a little business. If you would be so kind as to speak a word for me\r\nto the gentlemen as has the licensing. There ain\'t nobody as knows\r\nbetter how----"\r\n\r\n"What kind of a business, Thomas?" said Lucilla, who cheered up a little\r\nin ready interest, and would have been very glad if she could have taken\r\na little business too.\r\n\r\n"Well, Miss, a kind of a quiet--public-house, if I don\'t make too bold\r\nto name it," said Thomas, with a deprecating air--"not one of them\r\ndrinking-places, Miss, as, I know, ladies can\'t abide; but many a man,\r\nas is a very decent man, wants his pint o\' beer now and again, and their\r\nlittle sort of clubs of a night as well as the gentlefolks; and it\'s my\r\nopinion, Miss, as it\'s a man\'s dooty to see as that sort of thing don\'t\r\ngo too far, and yet as his fellow-creatures has their bit of pleasure,"\r\nsaid Thomas, who naturally took the defensive side.\r\n\r\n"I am sure you are quite right," said Lucilla, cheering up more and\r\nmore, and instinctively, with her old statesmanlike breadth of view,\r\nthrowing a rapid glance upon the subject to see what capabilities there\r\nmight be in it; "and I hope you will try always to exercise a good\r\ninfluence--What is all that noise and shouting out of doors?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s one of the candidates, Miss," said Thomas, "as is addressing of\r\nthe bargemen at the top o\' Prickett\'s Lane."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Lucilla; and a deep sigh escaped from her bosom. "But you\r\ncannot do anything of that kind, you know, Thomas, without a wife."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss," said Thomas, with great confusion and embarrassment; "that\r\nwas just what I was going to say. Me and Betsy----"\r\n\r\n"Betsy!" said Lucilla, with dismay; for it had been Betsy she had\r\nspecially fixed upon as the handy, willing, cheerful maid who, when\r\nthere was no gentleman coming in, and little else to do, might keep even\r\nthis big house in order. She sighed; but it was not in her power, even\r\nif she had desired it, to put any restriction upon Betsy\'s wishes. And\r\nit was not without a momentary envy that she received the intelligence.\r\nIt was life the housemaid was about to enter on--active life of her own,\r\nwith an object and meaning--clogged by Thomas, no doubt, who did not\r\nappear to Lucilla as the bright spot in the picture--but still\r\nindependent life; whereas her mistress knew of nothing particularly\r\ninteresting in her own uncertain future. She was roused from her\r\nmomentary meditation by the distant shouts which came from the top of\r\nPrickett\'s Lane, and sighed again, without knowing it, as she spoke.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity you had not got your--little inn," said Lucilla, for the\r\nsake of euphony, "six months or a year ago, for then you might have\r\nvoted for Mr Ashburton, Thomas. I had forgotten about the election until\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Not as that needn\'t stand in the way, Miss," said Thomas eagerly;\r\n"there\'s Betsy\'s brother as has it now, and he ain\'t made up his mind\r\nabout his vote; and if he knowed as it would be any comfort to you----"\r\n\r\n"Of course it will be a comfort to me!" said Miss Marjoribanks; and she\r\ngot up from her chair with a sense that she was still not altogether\r\nuseless in the world. "Go and speak to him directly, Thomas; and here\'s\r\none of Mr Ashburton\'s colours that I made up myself; and tell him that\r\nthere can be no doubt _he_ is the man for Carlingford; and send up Nancy\r\nto me. And I hope Betsy and you will be very happy," said Lucilla. She\r\nhad been dreadfully down, but the rebound was all the more grateful. "I\r\nam not done with yet, and, thank Heaven! there must always be something\r\nto do," she said to herself when she was alone. And she threw off her\r\nshawl, and began to make the drawing-room look like itself; not that it\r\nwas not perfectly in order, and as neat as a room could be; but still\r\nthe neatness savoured of Betsy, and not of Lucilla. Miss Marjoribanks,\r\nin five minutes, made it look like that cosy empire of hospitality and\r\nkindness and talk and wit, and everything pleasant, that it used to be;\r\nand then, when she had finished, she sat down and had a good cry, which\r\ndid not do her any harm.\r\n\r\nThen Nancy appeared, disturbed in her preparations for dinner, and with\r\nher arms wrapped in her apron, looking glum and defiant. Hers was not\r\nthe resigned and resourceful preparation for her fate which had appeared\r\nin Thomas. She came in, and put the door ajar, and leant her back\r\nagainst the sharp edge. She might be sent off like the rest, if that was\r\nMiss Lucilla\'s meaning--her that had been in the house off and on for\r\nmore than thirty years; but if it was so, at least she would not give up\r\nwithout unfolding a bit of her mind.\r\n\r\n"Come in," said Lucilla, drying her eyes--"come in and shut the door;\r\nyou had better come and sit down here, Nancy, for I have a great deal to\r\nsay, and I want to speak to you as a friend."\r\n\r\nNancy shut the door, but she thought to herself that she knew what all\r\nthis meant, and made but a very little movement into the room, looking\r\nmore forbidding than ever. "Thank you all the same, Miss Lucilla, but I\r\nain\'t too old to stand," she said; and stood firm to meet the shock,\r\nwith her arms folded under her apron, thinking in her heart that it was\r\nabout one of the almshouses, her horror and hope, that her young\r\nmistress was going to speak.\r\n\r\n"Nancy," said Lucilla, "I want to tell you what I am going to do. I\r\nhave to make up my mind for myself now. They all go against me, and one\r\nsays I should do this and another says I should do that; but I don\'t\r\nthink anybody knows me so well as you do. Don\'t stand at the door. I\r\nwant to consult you as a friend. I want to ask you a question, and you\r\nmust answer as if you were before a judge--I have such confidence in\r\n_you_."\r\n\r\nNancy\'s distrust and defiance gave way a little before this appeal. She\r\ncame a step nearer, and let the apron drop from her folded arms. "What\r\nis it, Miss Lucilla?--though I ain\'t pretending to be one to advise,"\r\nshe said, building a kind of intrenchment round her with the nearest\r\nchairs.\r\n\r\n"You know how things are changed," said Lucilla, "and that I can\'t stay\r\nhere as I used to do. People think I should go and live with somebody;\r\nbut _I_ think, you know--if I was one of those ladies that have a\r\nfaithful old servant to stand by them, and never to grumble nor make a\r\nfuss, nor go back on the past, nor go in for expensive dishes--one that\r\nwouldn\'t mind cooking a chop or making a cup of tea, if that was all we\r\ncould afford--why, I think, Nancy----"\r\n\r\nBut Nancy could not hear any more. She made a little rush forward, with\r\na kind of convulsive chuckling that was half sobbing and half laughter.\r\n"And me here!" cried Dr Marjoribanks\'s famous cook, who had spent a\r\nfortune on her gravy-beef alone, and was one of the most expensive\r\npeople in Carlingford--"me as has done for you all your days! me as\r\nwould--if it was but a roast potato!" cried the devoted woman. She was\r\nin such a state of hysterical flutter and excitement that Lucilla had to\r\ntake her almost into her arms and put the old woman into a chair and\r\nbring her to, which was an occupation quite in Miss Marjoribanks\'s way.\r\n\r\n"But I shall only have two hundred a year," said Lucilla. "Now don\'t be\r\nrash; there will have to be a maid to keep things tidy, and that is\r\nevery farthing I shall have. You used to spend as much in gravy-beef,"\r\nsaid Miss Marjoribanks, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Miss Lucilla, let bygones be bygones," said Nancy, with tears. "If\r\nI did, it wasn\'t without many a little something for them as was too\r\npoor to buy it for themselves--for I never was one as boiled the senses\r\nout of a bit of meat; and when a gentleman is well-to-do, and hasn\'t got\r\nno occasion to count every penny----The Doctor, I will say for him, was\r\nnever one as asked too many questions. Give him a good dinner on his\r\nown table, and he wasn\'t the gentleman as grudged a bit of broken meat\r\nfor the poor folks. He did a deal of good as you nor no one never know\'d\r\nof, Miss Lucilla," said Nancy, with a sob.\r\n\r\nAnd then his daughter and his faithful old servant cried a little in\r\ncompany over Dr Marjoribanks\'s vacant place. What could a man have more?\r\nNobody was made altogether desolate by his death, nor was any heart\r\nbroken, but they wept for him honestly, though the old woman felt happy\r\nin her sorrow. And Lucilla, on her knees before the fire, told Nancy of\r\nthat exclamation the Doctor had made in John Brown\'s office, and how he\r\nhad put his hand on her shoulder that last night. "All he said was, Poor\r\nLucilla!" sobbed Miss Marjoribanks; "he never thought of himself nor all\r\nhis money that he had worked so hard for;" and once more that touch of\r\nsomething more exquisite than was usual to her went sharply down into\r\nLucilla\'s heart and brought up tenderer and deeper tears.\r\n\r\nShe felt all the better for it after, and was even a little cheerful in\r\nthe evening, and like herself; and thus it will be seen that one person\r\nin Carlingford--not, it is true, a popular oracle, but of powerful\r\ninfluence and first-rate importance in a practical point of view--gave\r\nthe heartiest approbation to Miss Marjoribanks\'s scheme for her new\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XLVI_\r\n\r\n\r\nLucilla\'s calculations were fully justified by the result. Twenty times\r\nin a day she recognised the wisdom of her own early decision, which was\r\nmade while she was still by herself, and before anybody had come in to\r\nadvise her. If she had left it over until the time when, though much\r\nshaken, she was understood to be able to see her friends, it is just\r\npossible that the whirlwind of popular opinion which raged about her\r\nmight have exercised a distracting influence even upon Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s clear head and steady judgment. For even now, though they\r\nsaw her in her own house, in her mourning, people would not believe that\r\nit was true, and that Lucilla actually intended to make "no change"; and\r\nall that tide of good advice which had been flowing through Carlingford\r\never since the Doctor\'s death in the form of opinion, now rushed in upon\r\nher, notwithstanding that all the world knew that she had made up her\r\nmind. "Everybody says you are going to stay on, but we do hope it is not\r\ntrue, Lucilla," her friends said, in many voices. "It is dreadful for us\r\nto lose you, but you never _could_ bear it, dear." And this was repeated\r\nso often that if Miss Marjoribanks had been weak-minded, she must have\r\nended by believing not only that it was more than she was equal to, but\r\nmore than she ought to be equal to--which was a more touching argument\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n"You are excited now," Miss Brown said, who had a great deal of\r\nexperience in family troubles; "one always is at such a time; but when\r\nthings have settled down in their ordinary way, then you will find it is\r\nmore than you can bear. I think it is always best to make a change. If\r\nyou were to travel a little, you know----"\r\n\r\n"But, my dear, I am poor," said Lucilla.\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t require so much money when you know how to set about it,"\r\nsaid her adviser; "and there are so many people who would be glad to\r\nhave you, Lucilla! And then you might settle a little at Caen or Tours,\r\nor some of those nice places, where there is such capital English\r\nsociety, and everything so cheap; or, if you thought your health\r\nrequired it, at Pau or Nice, you know. You are looking quite pale, and\r\nI don\'t think you were ever very strong in the chest, Lucilla; and\r\neverything is _so_ different on the Continent--one feels it the moment\r\none crosses the Channel; there is something different in the very air."\r\n\r\n"It smells different, I know," said Lucilla meekly; and then the\r\nconversation was interrupted by that afternoon cup of tea, which Nancy\r\ncould not be got to think was an extravagance, and around which, to tell\r\nthe truth, the Grange Lane ladies began to resume their habit of\r\ngathering--though Miss Marjoribanks, of course, was still quite unequal\r\nto society--as in the old times.\r\n\r\n"And unless it is for a very short time, Lucilla," Mrs Centum said, who\r\nhad joined them, "you never can keep it up, you know. _I_ could not\r\npretend to afford Nancy, for my part; and when a cook is extravagant she\r\nmay promise as faithfully as you please, and make good resolutions, and\r\nall that; but when it is in her, Lucilla--I am sure one or two receipts\r\nshe has given me have been quite ridiculous. You don\'t like to give in,\r\nI know, but you\'ll be driven to give in; and if she does not get you\r\ninto debt as well, you will be very lucky. I know what it is. With my\r\nfamily, you know, a week of Nancy would make an end of me."\r\n\r\n"And the worst of all is," said Lady Richmond, who had driven in\r\nexpressly to add her mite to the treasure of precious counsel, of which\r\nMiss Marjoribanks was making so little use, "that I am sure Lucilla is\r\noverestimating her strength. She will find after that she is not equal\r\nto it, you know; all the associations--and the people coming at night to\r\nask for the Doctor--and--and all that. I know it would kill _me_."\r\n\r\n"Dear Lady Richmond," said Lucilla, making a desperate stand, and\r\nsetting, as it were, her back against a rock, "don\'t you think I can\r\nbear it best here where you are all so kind to me; and where everybody\r\nwas so fond of--of _him_? You can\'t think what a comfort it is to me,"\r\nsaid Lucilla, with a sob, "to see all the hatbands upon the gentlemen\'s\r\nhats."\r\n\r\nAnd then there was a pause, for this was an argument against which\r\nnobody could find anything to say.\r\n\r\n"For my part, I think the only thing she can do is to take Inmates,"\r\nsaid Aunt Jemima. "If I were obliged to leave she would be so very\r\nlonely. I have known ladies do it who were in a very good position, and\r\nit made no difference; people visited them all the same. She could say,\r\n\'In consequence of changes in the family,\' or \'A lady who has a larger\r\nhouse than she requires\'; which I am sure is quite true. It goes to\r\none\'s heart to think of all these bedrooms, and only one lady to sleep\r\nin them all--when so many people are so hampered for want of room. Or\r\nshe might say, \'For the sake of society\'; for, I am sure, if I should\r\nhave to go away----"\r\n\r\n"But I hope you are not going away. It would be so sad for Lucilla to be\r\nleft alone," said Lady Richmond, who took a serious view of everything,\r\n"at such a time."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" Aunt Jemima said, faltering a little; and then a pink blush,\r\nwhich seemed strangely uncalled for in such a mild little tea-party,\r\ncame over her mature countenance; "but then one can never tell what may\r\nhappen. I might have other duties--my son might make a call upon my\r\ntime. Not that I know of anything at present," she added hurriedly, "but\r\nI never can bind myself on account of Tom----"\r\n\r\nAnd then she caught Lucilla\'s eye, and grew more confused than ever.\r\nWhat could she have to be confused about? If Tom did make a call upon\r\nher time, whatever that might mean, there was nothing in it to call a\r\nblush upon his mother\'s face. And the fact was, that a letter had come\r\nfrom Tom a day or two before, of which, contrary to all her usual\r\nhabits, Aunt Jemima had taken no notice to Lucilla. These were things\r\nwhich would have roused Miss Marjoribanks\'s curiosity if she had been\r\nable to think about anything, as she said. But her visitors were taking\r\ntheir cup of tea all the time, in a melancholy, half-sympathetic,\r\nhalf-disapproving way, and they could not be expected to see anything\r\nparticularly interesting in Aunt Jemima\'s blush.\r\n\r\nAnd then Rose Lake came in from Grove Street, who was rather an unusual\r\nvisitor, and whose appearance, though they were all very kind and\r\ngracious to her, rather put the others to flight; for nobody had ever\r\nquite forgotten or forgiven Barbara\'s brief entrance into society and\r\nflirtation with Mr Cavendish, which might be said to have been the\r\nbeginning of all that happened to him in Grange Lane. As for Mrs Centum,\r\nshe took her leave directly, and pressed Lucilla\'s hand, and could not\r\nhelp saying in her ear that she hoped _the other_ was not coming back to\r\nCarlingford to throw herself in poor Mr Cavendish\'s way. "It would do\r\nhim so much harm," Mrs Centum said anxiously; "but oh! I forgot,\r\nLucilla, you are on the other side."\r\n\r\n"I am on no side _now_," said Miss Marjoribanks, with plaintive meaning;\r\n"and Barbara was as old as I am, you know, and she must have gone off."\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt she has gone off," said Mrs Centum, with righteous\r\nindignation. "As old as you, Lucilla! She must be ten years older at\r\nleast; and such a shocking style of looks--if men were not so\r\ninfatuated! And you have not gone off at all, my poor dear," she added,\r\nwith all the warmth of friendship! And then they were joined at the door\r\nby the county lady, who was the next to go away.\r\n\r\n"My dear, I hope you will be guided for the best," Lady Richmond said as\r\nshe went away; but she gave a deep sigh as she kissed Lucilla, and\r\nlooked as if she had very little faith in the efficacy of her own wish.\r\nMaria Brown had withdrawn to another part of the drawing-room with Aunt\r\nJemima, so that Lucilla was, so to speak, left alone with Rose. And\r\nRose, too, had come with the intention of giving advice.\r\n\r\n"I hear you are going to stay, Lucilla," she said, "and I did not think\r\nI would be doing my duty if I did not tell you what was in my mind. _I_\r\ncan\'t do any good to anybody, you know; but you who are so clever, and\r\nhave so much in your power----"\r\n\r\n"I am poor now," said Miss Marjoribanks; "and as for being clever, I\r\ndon\'t know about that. I never was clever about drawing or Art, like\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Oh, like me!" said poor little Rose, whose Career had been sacrificed\r\nten years ago, and who was a little misanthropical now, and did not\r\nbelieve even in Schools of Design; "I am not so sure about the moral\r\ninfluence of Art as I used to be--except High Art, to be sure; but we\r\nnever have any High Art down here. And oh, Lucilla! the poor people _do_\r\nwant something done for them. If I was as clever as you, and with a\r\ngreat house all to myself like this, and well off, and with plenty of\r\ninfluence, and no ties----" said Rose, with energetic emphasis. She made\r\na pause there, and she was so much in earnest that the tears came into\r\nher eyes. "I would make it a House of Mercy, Lucilla! I would show all\r\nthese poor creatures how to live and how to manage, if I was as clever\r\nas you; and teach them and their children, and look after them, and be\r\na mother to them!" said Rose; and here she stopped short, altogether\r\novercome by her own magnificent conception of what her friend could or\r\nmight do.\r\n\r\nAunt Jemima and Miss Brown, who had drawn near out of curiosity, stared\r\nat Rose as if they thought she had gone mad; but Lucilla, who was of a\r\nlarger mind and more enlightened ideas, neither laughed nor looked\r\nhorrified. She did not make a very distinct answer, it is true, but she\r\nwas very kind to her new adviser, and made her a fresh cup of tea, and\r\neven consented, though in an ambiguous way, to the principle she had\r\njust enunciated, "If you won\'t be affronted, my dear," Lucilla said, "I\r\ndo not think that Art could do very much in Carlingford; and I am sure\r\nany little thing that I may be of use for----" But she did not commit\r\nherself any further, and Rose too found the result of her visit\r\nunsatisfactory, and went home disappointed in Lucilla. This was how the\r\nafternoon passed; and at the end of such a day, it may well be imagined\r\nhow Miss Marjoribanks congratulated herself on having made up her mind\r\nbefore the public, so to speak, were admitted. For Rose was followed by\r\nthe Rector, who, though he did not propose in so many words a House of\r\nMercy, made no secret of his conviction that parish-work was the only\r\nthing that could be of any service to Lucilla; and that, in short, such\r\nwas the inevitable and providential destination of a woman who had "no\r\nties." Indeed, to hear Mr Bury, a stranger would have been disposed to\r\nbelieve that Dr Marjoribanks had been, as he said, "removed," and his\r\nfortune swept away, all in order to indicate to Lucilla the proper\r\nsphere for her energies. In the face of all this it will be seen how\r\nentirely Miss Marjoribanks\'s wisdom in making her decision by herself\r\nbefore her advisers broke in upon her, was justified. She could now set\r\nher back against her rock, and face her assailants, as Fitz-James did.\r\n\r\n    Come one, come all, this rock shall fly\r\n    From its firm base as soon as I,\r\n\r\nmight have been her utterance; but she was not in a defiant mood. She\r\nkissed all her counsellors that day (except, of course, the Rector), and\r\nheard them out with the sweetest patience; and then she thought to\r\nherself how much better it was that she had made up her mind to take her\r\nown way.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, all this commotion of public opinion about her made a\r\ncertain impression upon Miss Marjoribanks\'s mind. It was not unpleasant\r\nto feel that, for this moment at least, she was the centre of the\r\nthoughts of the community, and that almost everybody in Carlingford had\r\ntaken the trouble to frame an ideal existence for her, according as he\r\nor she regarded life. It is so seldom that any one has it in his power,\r\nconsciously and evidently, to regulate his life for himself, and make it\r\nwhatever he wants it to be. And then, at the same time, the best that\r\nshe could make of it would, after all, be something very limited and\r\nunsatisfactory. In her musings on this subject, Lucilla could not but go\r\nback a great many times to that last conversation she had with her\r\nfather, when she walked up Grange Lane with him that night over the\r\nthawed and muddy snow. The Doctor had said she was not cut out for a\r\nsingle woman; and Lucilla, with candour, yet a certain philosophical\r\nspeculativeness, had allowed that she was not--unless, indeed, she could\r\nbe very rich. If she had been very rich, the prospect would no doubt\r\nhave been, to a certain extent, different. And then, oddly enough, it\r\nwas Rose Lake\'s suggestion which came after this to Lucilla\'s mind. She\r\ndid not smile at it as some people might expect she would. One thing was\r\nquite sure, that she had no intention of sinking into a nobody, and\r\ngiving up all power of acting upon her fellow-creatures; and she could\r\nnot help being conscious of the fact that she was able to be of much use\r\nto her fellow-creatures. If it had been Maria Brown, for instance, who\r\nhad been concerned, the whole question would have been one of utter\r\nunimportance, except to the heroine itself; but it was different in Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s case. The House of Mercy was not a thing to be taken into\r\nany serious consideration; but still there was something in the idea\r\nwhich Lucilla could not dismiss carelessly as her friends could. She had\r\nno vocation, such as the foundress of such an establishment ought to\r\nhave, nor did she see her way to the abandonment of all projects for\r\nherself, and that utter devotion to the cause of humanity which would be\r\ninvolved in it; but yet, when a woman happens to be full of energy and\r\nspirit, and determined that whatever she may be she shall certainly not\r\nbe a nonentity, her position is one that demands thought. She was very\r\ncapable of serving her fellow-creatures, and very willing and well\r\ndisposed to serve them; and yet she was not inclined to give herself up\r\nentirely to them, nor to relinquish her personal prospects--vague\r\nthough these might be. It was a tough problem, and one which might have\r\ncaused a most unusual disturbance in Lucilla\'s well-regulated mind, had\r\nnot she remembered all at once what deep mourning she was in, and that\r\nat present no sort of action, either of one kind or another, could be\r\nexpected of her. There was no need for making a final decision, either\r\nabout the parish-work, or about taking Inmates, as Aunt Jemima proposed,\r\nor about any other single suggestion which had been offered to her; no\r\nmore than there was any necessity for asking what her cousin Tom\'s last\r\nletter had been about, or why his mother looked so guilty and\r\nembarrassed when she spoke of him. Grief has its privileges and\r\nexemptions, like other great principles of life; and the recollection\r\nthat she could not at present be expected to be able to think about\r\nanything, filled Lucilla\'s mind with the most soothing sense of\r\nconsolation and refreshing calm.\r\n\r\nAnd then other events occurred to occupy her friends; the election for\r\none thing began to grow a little exciting, and took away some of the\r\nsuperfluous energy of Grange Lane. Mr Ashburton had carried all before\r\nhim at first; but since the Rector had come into the field, the balance\r\nhad changed a little. Mr Bury was very Low-Church; and from the moment\r\nat which he was persuaded that Mr Cavendish was a great penitent, the\r\nquestion as to which was the Man for Carlingford had been solved in his\r\nmind in the most satisfactory way. A man who intrenched himself in mere\r\nrespectability, and trusted in his own good character, and considered\r\nhimself to have a clear conscience, and to have done his duty, had no\r\nchance against a repentant sinner. Mr Cavendish, perhaps, had not done\r\nhis duty quite so well; but then he was penitent, and everything was\r\nexpressed in that word. The Rector was by no means contemptible, either\r\nas an adversary or a supporter--and the worst of it was that, in\r\nembracing Mr Cavendish\'s claims, he could scarcely help speaking of Mr\r\nAshburton as if he was in a very bad way. And feeling began to rise\r\nrather high in Carlingford. If anything could have deepened the\r\nintensity of Miss Marjoribanks\'s grief, it would have been to know that\r\nall this was going on, and that affairs might go badly with her\r\ncandidate, while she was shut up, and could give no aid. It was hard\r\nupon her, and it was hard upon the candidates themselves--one of whom\r\nhad thus become generally disapproved of, without, so far as he knew,\r\ndoing anything to deserve it; while the other occupied the still more\r\npainful character of being on his promotion--a repentant man, with a\r\ncharacter to keep up. It was no wonder that Mrs Centum grew pale at the\r\nvery idea of such a creature as Barbara Lake throwing herself in poor Mr\r\nCavendish\'s way. A wrong step one way or other--a relapse into the ways\r\nof wickedness--might undo in a moment all that it had cost so much\r\ntrouble to do. And the advantage of the Rector\'s support was thus\r\ngrievously counterbalanced by what might be called the uncertainty of\r\nit--especially as Mr Cavendish was not, as his committee lamented\r\nsecretly among themselves, a man of strong will or business habits, in\r\nwhom implicit confidence could be placed. He might get restive, and\r\nthrow the Rector over just at the critical moment; or he might relapse\r\ninto his lazy Continental habits, and give up church-going and other\r\ngood practices. But still, up to this moment, he had shown very\r\ntolerable perseverance; and Mr Bury\'s influence thrown into his scale\r\nhad equalised matters very much, and made the contest very exciting. All\r\nthis Lucilla heard, not from Mr Cavendish, but from her own candidate,\r\nwho had taken to calling in a steady sort of way. He never went into any\r\neffusions of sympathy, for he was not that kind of man; but he would\r\nshake hands with her, and say that people must submit to the decrees of\r\nProvidence; and then he would speak of the election and of his chances.\r\nSometimes Mr Ashburton was despondent, and then Lucilla cheered him up;\r\nand sometimes he had very good hopes.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad you are to be here," he said on one of these occasions.\r\n"It would have been a great loss to me if you had gone away. I shall\r\nnever forget our talk about it here _that_ day, and how you were the\r\nfirst person that found me out."\r\n\r\n"It was not any cleverness of mine," said Lucilla. "It came into my mind\r\nin a moment, like spirit-rapping, you know. It seems so strange to talk\r\nof that _now_; there have been such changes since then--it looks like\r\nyears."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mr Ashburton, in his steady way. "There is nothing that\r\nreally makes time look so long; but we must all bow to these\r\ndispensations, my dear Miss Marjoribanks. I would not speak of the\r\nelection, but that I thought it might amuse you. The writs are out now,\r\nyou know, and it takes place on Monday week."\r\n\r\nUpon which Miss Marjoribanks smiled upon Mr Ashburton, and held out her\r\nhands to him with a gesture and look which said more than words. "You\r\nknow you will have _all_ my best wishes," she said; and the candidate\r\nwas much moved--more moved than at such a moment he had thought it\r\npossible to be.\r\n\r\n"If I succeed, I know whom I shall thank the most," he said fervently;\r\nand then, as this was a climax, and it would have been a kind of bathos\r\nto plunge into ordinary details after it, Mr Ashburton got up, still\r\nholding Lucilla\'s hand, and clasped it almost tenderly as he said\r\ngood-bye. She looked very well in her mourning, though she had not\r\nexpected to do so; for black was not Lucilla\'s style. And the fact was,\r\nthat instead of having gone off, as she herself said, Miss Marjoribanks\r\nlooked better than ever she did, and was even embellished by the natural\r\ntears which still shone by times in her eyes. Mr Ashburton went out in a\r\nkind of bewilderment after this interview, and forgot his overcoat in\r\nthe hall, and had to come back for it, which was a confusing\r\ncircumstance; and then he went on his way with a gentle excitement which\r\nwas not unpleasant. "Would she, I wonder?" he said to himself, as he\r\nwent up Grange Lane. Perhaps he was only asking himself whether Lucilla\r\nwould or could be present along with Lady Richmond and her family at the\r\nwindow of the Blue Boar on the great day; but if that was it, the idea\r\nhad a certain brightening and quickening influence upon his face and his\r\nmovements. The doubt he had on the subject, whatever it was, was not a\r\ndiscouraging, but a piquant, stimulating, exciting doubt. He had all but\r\nproposed the question to his committee when he went in among them, which\r\nwould have filled these gentlemen with wonder and dismay. But though he\r\ndid not do that, he carried it home with him, as he trotted back to the\r\nFirs to dinner. Mr Ashburton took a walk through his own house that\r\nevening, and examined all its capabilities--with no particular motive,\r\nas he was at pains to explain to his housekeeper; and again he said to\r\nhimself, "Would she, I wonder?" before he retired for the night; which\r\nwas no doubt an unusual sort of iteration for so sensible a man, and one\r\nso fully occupied with the most important affairs, to make.\r\n\r\nAs for Lucilla, she was not in the way of asking herself any questions\r\nat that moment. She was letting things take their course, and not\r\ninterfering; and consequently, nothing that happened could be said to be\r\nher fault. She carried this principle so far, that even when Aunt Jemima\r\nwas herself led to open the subject, in a hesitating way, Miss\r\nMarjoribanks never even asked a single question about Tom\'s last letter.\r\nShe was in mourning, and that was enough for her. As for appearing at\r\nthe window of the Blue Boar with Lady Richmond, if that was what Mr\r\nAshburton was curious about, he might have saved himself the trouble of\r\nany speculations on the subject. For though Miss Marjoribanks would be\r\nvery anxious about the election, she would indeed have been ashamed of\r\nherself could her feelings have permitted her to appear anywhere in\r\npublic so soon. Thus, while Mr Ashburton occupied himself much with the\r\nquestion which had taken possession of his mind, Lucilla took a good\r\nbook, which seemed the best reading for her in her circumstances, and\r\nwhen she had looked after all her straitened affairs in the morning, sat\r\ndown sweetly in the afternoon quiet of her retirement and seclusion, and\r\nlet things take their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XLVII_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the election approached, it became gradually the one absorbing object\r\nof interest in Carlingford. The contest was so equal that everybody took\r\na certain share in it, and became excited as the decisive moment drew\r\nnigh. Most of the people in Grange Lane were for Mr Ashburton, but then\r\nthe Rector, who was a host in himself, was for Mr Cavendish; and the\r\ncoquetting of the Dissenting interest, which was sometimes drawn towards\r\nthe liberal sentiments of the former candidate, but sometimes could not\r\nhelp reflecting that Mr Ashburton "dealt" in George Street; and the\r\nfluctuations of the bargemen, who were, many of them, freemen, and a\r\nvery difficult part of the population, excited the most vivid interest.\r\nYoung Mr Wentworth, who had but lately come to Carlingford, had already\r\nbegun to acquire a great influence at Wharfside, where most of the\r\nbargees lived, and the steady ones would no doubt have been largely\r\nswayed by him had his inclinations been the same as the Rector\'s; but Mr\r\nWentworth, perversely enough, had conceived that intuitive repugnance\r\nfor Mr Cavendish which a high-principled and not very tolerant young man\r\noften feels for the middle-aged individual who still conceives himself\r\nto have some right to be called young, and whose antecedents are not\r\nentirely beyond suspicion. Mr Wentworth\'s disinclination (and he was a\r\nman rather apt to take his own way) lay like a great boulder across the\r\nstream of the Rector\'s enthusiasm, and unquestionably interrupted it a\r\nlittle. Both the candidates and both the committees had accordingly work\r\nenough to do up to the last moment. Mr Cavendish all at once became a\r\nconnoisseur in hams, and gave a magnificent order in the most\r\ncomplimentary way to Tozer, who received it with a broad smile, and\r\n"booked" it, as he said. "It ain\'t ham he\'s a wanting," the butterman\r\nsaid, not without amusement; for Tozer was well-to-do, and, except that\r\nhe felt the honour of a mark of confidence, was not to be moved one way\r\nor another by one order. "If he dealt regular, it might be different.\r\nThem\'s the sort of folks as a man feels drawn to," said the true\r\nphilosopher. Mr Ashburton, on the other side, did not make the\r\nimpression which his friends thought he ought to have made in Prickett\'s\r\nLane; but at least nobody could say that he did not stick very close to\r\nhis work. He went at it like a man night and day, and neglected no means\r\nof carrying it to a successful issue; whereas, as Mr Centum and Mr\r\nWoodburn mourned in secret to each other, Cavendish required perpetual\r\negging on. He did not like to get up in the morning, and get early to\r\nhis work. It went against all his habits--as if his habits mattered in\r\nthe face of so great an emergency; and in the afternoon it was hard to\r\nprevent him from lounging into some of his haunts, which were utterly\r\nout of the way of business. He would stay in Masters\'s for an hour at a\r\ntime, though he knew Mr Wentworth, who was Masters\'s great patron, did\r\nnot care for him, and that his favour for such a Tractarian sort of\r\nplace was bitter to the Rector. Anything for a little idleness and waste\r\nof time, poor Mr Centum said, who was two stone lighter on the eve of\r\nthe election than when the canvass began. Such a contrast would make any\r\nman angry. Mr Cavendish was goaded into more activity as the decisive\r\nmoment approached, and performed what seemed to himself unparalleled\r\nfeats. But it was only two days before the moment of fate when the\r\naccident happened to him which brought such dismay to all his\r\nsupporters. Our own opinion is, that it did not materially affect the\r\nissue of the contest one way or other; but that was the reverse of the\r\nfeeling which prevailed in Grange Lane.\r\n\r\nIt was just two days before the election, and all seemed going on\r\nsufficiently well. Mr Cavendish had been meeting a Dissenting committee,\r\nand it was on leaving them that he found himself at the corner of Grove\r\nStreet, where, under ordinary circumstances, he had no occasion to be.\r\nAt a later period he was rather fond of saying that it was not of his\r\nown motion that he was there at all, but only in obedience to the\r\ncommittee, which ordered him about like a nigger. The spring afternoon\r\nwas darkening, and the Dissenters (almost wholly unimpressed by his\r\narguments, and remarking more strongly than ever where Mr Ashburton\r\n"dealt," and how thoroughly everybody knew all about him) had all\r\ndispersed. It was but natural, when Mr Cavendish came to the corner of\r\nGrove Street, where, in other days, he had played a very different part,\r\nthat certain softening influences should take possession of his soul.\r\n"What a voice she had, by Jove!" he said to himself; "very different\r\nfrom that shrill pipe of Lucilla\'s." To tell the truth, if there was one\r\nperson in Carlingford whom he felt a resentment against, it was Lucilla.\r\nShe had never done him any harm to speak of, and once she had\r\nunquestionably done him a great deal of good. But, on the other hand, it\r\nwas she who first showed herself candidly conscious that he had grown\r\nstout, and who all along had supported and encouraged his rival. It was\r\npossible, no doubt, that this might be pique; and, mixed with his anger\r\nfor her sins against him, Mr Cavendish had, at the same time, a\r\ncounterbalancing sense that there still remained to him in his life one\r\nsupereminently wise thing that he still could do--and that was, to go\r\ndown Grange Lane instantly to the Doctor\'s silenced house, and go down\r\non his knees, or do any other absurdity that might be necessary to make\r\nLucilla marry him; after which act he would henceforward be, pecuniarily\r\nand otherwise (notwithstanding that she was poor), a saved man. It did\r\nnot occur to him that Lucilla would never have married him, even had he\r\ngone down on his knees; but perhaps that would be too much to ask any\r\nman to believe of any woman; and his feeling that this was the right\r\nthing to do, rather strengthened than otherwise the revolt of his heart\r\nagainst Lucilla. It was twilight, as we have said, and he had done a\r\nhard day\'s work, and there was still an hour before dinner which he\r\nseemed to have a right to dispose of in his own way; and he did\r\nhesitate at the corner of Grove Street, laying himself open, as it were,\r\nto any temptation that might offer itself. Temptations come, as a\r\ngeneral rule, when they are sought; and thus, on the very eve of the\r\nelection, a grievous accident happened to Mr Cavendish. It might have\r\nhappened at any time, to be sure, but this was the most inopportune\r\nmoment possible, and it came accordingly now.\r\n\r\nFor, as he made that pause, some one passed him whom he could not but\r\nlook after with a certain interest. She went past him with a whisk, as\r\nif she too was not without reminiscences. It was not such a figure as a\r\nromantic young man would be attracted by on such a sudden meeting, and\r\nit was not attraction but recollection that moved Mr Cavendish. It was\r\nthe figure of a large woman in a large shawl, not very gracefully put\r\non, and making her look very square about the shoulders and bunchy at\r\nthe neck; and the robe that was whisked past him was that peculiar kind\r\nof faded silk gown which looks and rustles like tin, or some other thin\r\nmetallic substance. He made that momentary pause at the street corner,\r\nand then he went on, slowly, not following her, to be sure, but merely,\r\nas he said to himself, pursuing his own course; for it was just as easy\r\nto get into Grange Lane by the farther end as by this end. He went along\r\nvery slowly, and the lady before him walked quickly, even with something\r\nlike a bounce of excitement, and went in at Mr Lake\'s door long before\r\nMr Cavendish reached it. When he came up on a level with the parlour\r\nwindow, which was partially open though the evening was so cold, Mr\r\nCavendish positively started, notwithstanding the old associations which\r\nhad been rising in his mind; for there was pouring forth from the\r\nhalf-open window such a volume of melody as had not been heard for years\r\nin Grove Street. Perhaps the voice had lost some of its freshness, but\r\nin the surprise of the moment the hearer was not critical; and its\r\nvolume and force seemed even greater than before.\r\n\r\nIt has been already mentioned in this history that a contralto had a\r\nspecial charm for Mr Cavendish. He was so struck that he stood\r\nstock-still for the moment, not knowing what to make of it; and then he\r\nwavered for another moment, with a sudden sense that the old allegorical\r\ncrisis had occurred to him, and that Pleasure, in a magnificent gush of\r\nsong, wooed him on one side, while Duty, with still small voice, called\r\nhim at the other. He stood still, he wavered--for fifty seconds perhaps\r\nthe issue was uncertain, and the victim was still within reach of\r\nsalvation; but the result in such a case depends very much upon whether\r\na man really likes doing his duty, which is by no means an invariable\r\nnecessity. Mr Cavendish had in the abstract no sort of desire to do his\r\nunless when he could not help it, and consequently his resistance to\r\ntemptation was very feeble. He was standing knocking at Mr Lake\'s door\r\nbefore half the thoughts appropriate to the occasion had got through his\r\nmind, and found himself sitting on the little sofa in Mr Lake\'s parlour\r\nas he used to do ten years ago, before he could explain to himself how\r\nhe came there. It was all, surely, a kind of enchantment altogether. He\r\nwas there--he who had been so long away from Carlingford--he who had\r\nbeen so deeply offended by hearing his name seriously coupled with that\r\nof Barbara Lake--he who ought to have been anywhere in the world rather\r\nthan here upon the eve of his election, when all the world was keeping\r\nwatch over his conduct. And it was Barbara who sat at the piano\r\nsinging--singing one of the same songs, as if she had spent the entire\r\ninterval in that occupation, and never had done anything else all these\r\nyears. The sensation was so strange that Mr Cavendish may be excused for\r\nfeeling a little uncertainty as to whether or not he was dreaming, which\r\nmade him unable to answer himself the graver question whether or not he\r\nwas doing what he ought to do. He did not seem to be able to make out\r\nwhether it was now or ten years ago--whether he was a young man free to\r\namuse himself, or a man who was getting stout, and upon whom the eyes of\r\nan anxious constituency were fixed. And then, after being so virtuous\r\nfor a length of time, a forbidden pleasure was sweet.\r\n\r\nMr Cavendish\'s ideas, however, gradually arranged themselves as he sat\r\nin the corner of the little haircloth sofa, and began to take in the\r\ndifferences as well as the bewildering resemblances of the present and\r\npast. Barbara, like himself, had changed. She did not insult him, as\r\nLucilla had done, by fresh looks and mischievous candour about "going\r\noff." Barbara _had_ gone off, like himself, and, like himself, did not\r\nmean to acknowledge it. She had expanded all over, as was natural to a\r\ncontralto. Her eyes were blacker and more brilliant in a way, but they\r\nwere eyes which owned an indescribable amount of usage; and her cheeks,\r\ntoo, wore the deep roses of old, deepened and fixed by wear and tear.\r\nInstead of feeling ashamed of himself in her presence, as he had done in\r\nLucilla\'s, Mr Cavendish felt somehow consoled and justified and\r\nsympathetic. "Poor soul!" he said to himself, as he sat by while she was\r\nsinging. She, too, had been in the wars, and had not come out\r\nscatheless. She did not reproach him, nor commiserate him, nor look at\r\nhim with that mixture of wonder and tolerance and pity which other\r\npeople had manifested. She did not even remark that he had grown stout.\r\nHe was not a man fallen, fallen, fallen from his high estate, to\r\nBarbara. She herself had fallen from the pinnacles of youth, and Mr\r\nCavendish was still a great man in her eyes. She sang for him as she had\r\nsung ten years ago, and received him with a flutter of suppressed\r\ndelight, and in her satisfaction was full of excitement. The hardworked\r\ncandidate sank deeper and deeper into the corner of the sofa and\r\nlistened to the music, and felt it very soothing and pleasant, for\r\neverybody had united in goading him on rather than petting him for the\r\nlast month or two of his life.\r\n\r\n"Now tell me something about yourself," he said, when the song was over,\r\nand Barbara had turned round, as she used to do in old times, on her\r\nmusic-stool; "I hear you have been away, like me."\r\n\r\n"Not like you," said Barbara, "for you went because you pleased, and I\r\nwent----"\r\n\r\n"Why did you go?" asked Mr Cavendish.\r\n\r\n"Because I could not stay here any longer," said Barbara, with her\r\nold vehemence; "because I was talked about, and looked down upon,\r\nand----Well, never mind, that\'s all over now; and I am sure I am very\r\nglad to see you, Mr Cavendish, as a _friend_."\r\n\r\nAnd with that something like a tear came into her eye. She had been\r\nknocked about a good deal in the world, and though she had not learned\r\nmuch, still she had learned that she was young no longer, and could not\r\nindulge in the caprices of that past condition of existence. Mr\r\nCavendish, for his part, could not but smile at this intimation that he\r\nwas to be received as a friend, and consequently need not have any fear\r\nof Barbara\'s fascinations,--as if a woman of her age, worn and gone off\r\nas she was, could be supposed dangerous; but still he was touched by her\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"We were once very good friends, Barbara," said the inconsistent man;\r\n"we have lost sight of each other for a long time, as people do in this\r\nworld; but we were once very good friends."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, with a slight touch of annoyance in her voice; "but\r\nsince we have lost sight of each other for so long, I don\'t see why you\r\nshould call me Barbara. It would be much more becoming to say Miss\r\nLake."\r\n\r\nMr Cavendish was amused, and he was touched and flattered. Most people\r\nhad been rather forbearing to him since he came back, putting up with\r\nhim for old friendship\'s sake, or supporting his cause as that of a\r\nreformed man, and giving him, on the whole, a sort of patronising\r\nhumiliating countenance; and to find somebody in whose eyes he was still\r\nthe paladin of old times, _the_ Mr Cavendish whom people in Grange Lane\r\nwere proud of, was balm to his wounded soul.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how I am to learn to say Miss Lake--when you are just as\r\ngood to me as ever, and sing as you have just been doing," he said. "I\r\nsuppose you say so because you find me so changed?"\r\n\r\nUpon which Barbara lifted her black eyes and looked at him as she had\r\nscarcely done before. The eyes were as bright as ever, and they were\r\nsoftened a little for the moment out of the stare that seemed to have\r\ngrown habitual to them; and her crimson cheeks glowed as of old; and\r\nthough she was untidy, and looked worn, and like a creature much\r\nbuffeted about by wind and waves, she was still what connoisseurs in\r\nthat article call a fine woman. She looked full at Mr Cavendish, and\r\nthen she cast down her eyes, as if the sight was too much for her. "I\r\ndon\'t see any difference," she said, with a certain tremor in her voice;\r\nfor he was a man of whom, in the days of her youth, she had been fond in\r\nher way.\r\n\r\nAnd naturally Mr Cavendish was more touched than ever. He took her hand,\r\nand called her Barbara again without any reproof; and he saw that she\r\ntrembled, and that his presence here made to the full as great an\r\nimpression as he had ever done in his palmiest days. Perhaps a greater\r\nimpression; for their old commerce had been stormy, and interrupted by\r\nmany a hurricane; and Barbara then had, or thought she might have, many\r\nstrings to her bow, and did not believe that there was only one Mr\r\nCavendish in the world. Now all that was changed: and if this old hope\r\nshould revive again, it would not be allowed to die away for any\r\ngratification of temper. Mr Cavendish did not remember ever to have seen\r\nher tremble before, and he too was fond of her in his way.\r\n\r\nThis curious revival did not come to anything of deeper importance, for\r\nof course just then Rose came in from her household affairs, and Mr Lake\r\nto tea; and the candidate recollected that it was time for dinner. But\r\nfather and sister also gave him, in their different ways, a rather\r\nflattering reception. Mr Lake had already pledged him his vote, and was\r\nfull of interest as to how things were going on, and enthusiastic for\r\nhis success; and Rose scowled upon him as of old, as on a dangerous\r\ncharacter, whose comings and goings could not be seen without\r\napprehension; which was an unexpected pleasure to a man who had been\r\nstartled to find how very little commotion his presence made in Grange\r\nLane. He pressed Barbara\'s hand as he went away, and went to his dinner\r\nwith a heart which certainly beat lighter, and a more pleasant sense of\r\nreturning self-confidence, than he had felt for a long time. When he was\r\ncoming out of the house, as a matter of course, he met with the chief of\r\nhis Dissenting supporters, accompanied (for Mr Bury, as has been said,\r\nwas very Low-Church, and loved, wherever he could do it, to work in\r\nunison with his Dissenting brethren) by the Rector\'s churchwarden, both\r\nof whom stopped with a curiously critical air to speak to the Candidate,\r\nwho had to be every man\'s friend for the time being. The look in their\r\neyes sent an icy chill through him, but still the forbidden pleasure had\r\nbeen sweet. As he walked home, he could not help thinking it over, and\r\ngoing back ten years, and feeling a little doubtful about it, whether it\r\nwas then or now. And as he mused Miss Marjoribanks, whom he could not\r\nhelp continually connecting and contrasting with the other, appeared to\r\nhim as a kind of jealous Queen Eleanor, who had a right to him, and\r\ncould take possession at any time, should she choose to make the effort;\r\nwhile Barbara was a Rosamond, dilapidated indeed, but always ready to\r\nreceive and console him in her bower. This was the kind of unconscious\r\nsentiment he had in his mind, feeling sure, as he mused, that Lucilla\r\nwould be very glad to marry him, and that it would be very wise on his\r\npart to ask her, and was a thing which might still probably come to\r\npass. Of course he could not see into Miss Marjoribanks\'s mind, which\r\nhad travelled such a long way beyond him. He gave a glance up at the\r\nwindows as he passed her door, and felt a kind of disagreeable\r\nsatisfaction in seeing how diminished the lights were in the once\r\nradiant house. And Lucilla was so fond of a great deal of light! but\r\nshe could not afford now to spend as much money upon wax as a\r\nContinental church might do. Mr Cavendish had so odd a sense of\r\nLucilla\'s power over him, that it gave him a certain pleasure to think\r\nof the coming down of her pride and diminution of her lights.\r\n\r\nBut the fact was, that not more than ten minutes after he had passed her\r\ndoor with this reflection, Lucilla, sitting with her good book on the\r\ntable and her work in her hand, in the room which was not so well\r\nlighted as it used to be, heard that Mr Cavendish had been met with\r\ncoming out of Mr Lake\'s, and that Barbara had been singing to him, and\r\nthat there was no telling what might have happened. "A man ain\'t the man\r\nfor Carlingford as takes up with that sort," Thomas said indignantly,\r\nwho had come to pay his former mistress a visit, and to assure her of\r\nhis brother-in-law\'s vote. He was a little more free-spoken than of old,\r\nbeing now set up, and an independent householder, and calling no man\r\nmaster; and he was naturally indignant at an occurrence which, regarded\r\nin the light of past events, was an insult not only to Carlingford, but\r\nto Lucilla. Miss Marjoribanks was evidently startled by the news. She\r\nlooked up quickly as if she had been about to speak, and then stopped\r\nherself and turned her back upon Thomas, and poked the fire in a most\r\nenergetic way. She had even taken the hearth-brush in her hand to make\r\nall tidy after this onslaught, but that was a thing that went to\r\nThomas\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t stand by and see it, Miss Lucilla," said Thomas; "it don\'t\r\nfeel natural;" and there was actually a kind of moisture in his eye as\r\nhe took that domestic implement out of her hand. Mr Cavendish pitied\r\nLucilla for having less light than of old, and Thomas for being reduced\r\nso low as to sweep her own hearth. But Lucilla was very far from pitying\r\nher own case. She had been making an effort over herself, and she had\r\ncome out of it triumphant; after reading so many good books, it is not\r\nto be wondered at if she felt herself a changed and softened and\r\nelevated character. She had the means in her hands of doing her\r\ncandidate\'s rival a deadly mischief, and yet, for old friendship\'s sake,\r\nLucilla made up her mind to forbear.\r\n\r\n"I will give it you, Thomas," she said, with dignity, holding the\r\nhearth-brush, which was in such circumstances elevated into something\r\nsublime, "if you will promise, never, until after the election--never\r\nto say a word about Mr Cavendish and Miss Lake. It was quite right to\r\ntell me, and you are very kind about the hearth; but you must promise\r\nnever to say a syllable about it, not even to Nancy, until the election\r\nis over; or I will never give it you, nor ask you to do a single thing\r\nfor me again."\r\n\r\nThomas was so much struck with this address that he said "Good Lord!" in\r\nsheer amazement; and then he made the necessary vow, and took the\r\nhearth-brush out of Lucilla\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"No doubt he was asking for Mr Lake\'s vote," said Miss Marjoribanks.\r\n"They say everybody is making great exertions, and you know they are\r\nboth my friends. I ought to be pleased whoever wins. But it is impressed\r\non my mind that Mr Ashburton will be the man," Lucilla added, with a\r\nlittle solemnity, "and, Thomas, we must give them fair-play."\r\n\r\nIt would be vain to assert that Thomas understood this romantic\r\ngenerosity, but he was taken by surprise, and had relinquished his own\r\nliberty in the matter, and had nothing further to say. Indeed he had so\r\nlittle to say downstairs, that Nancy, who was longing for a little\r\ngossip, insulted and reviled him, and declared that since he took up\r\nwith _that_ Betsy there never was a sensible word to be got out of him.\r\nAnd all the time the poor man was burning with this bit of news. Many a\r\nman has bartered his free-will before under the influence of female\r\nwiles, or so at least history would have us believe; but few have done\r\nit for so poor a compensation as that hearth-brush. Thomas withdrew sore\r\nat heart, longing for the election to be over, and kept his word like an\r\nhonest man; but notwithstanding, before the evening was over, the fatal\r\nnews was spreading like fire to every house in Grange Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XLVIII_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Mr Cavendish considered the indulgence above\r\nrecorded all the more excusable in that it was Saturday night. The\r\nnomination was to take place on Monday, and if a man was not to be\r\nsupposed to be done with his work on the Saturday evening, when could he\r\nbe expected to have a moment of repose? He had thought as he went\r\nhome--for naturally, while putting himself so skilfully in the way of\r\ntemptation, such questions had not entered into his mind--that the fact\r\nof to-morrow being Sunday would effectually neutralise any harm he could\r\nhave been supposed to have done by a visit so simple and natural, and\r\nthat neither his sister nor his committee, the two powers of which he\r\nstood in a certain awe, could so much as hear of it until the election\r\nwas over, and all decided for good or for evil. This had been a comfort\r\nto his mind, but it was the very falsest and most deceitful consolation.\r\nThat intervening Sunday was a severer calamity for Mr Cavendish than\r\nhalf a dozen ordinary days. The general excitement had risen so high,\r\nand all the chances on both sides had been so often discussed and\r\ndebated, that something new was as water in the desert to the thirsting\r\nconstituency. The story was all through Grange Lane that very night, but\r\nCarlingford itself, from St Roque\'s to the wilderness of the North End,\r\ntingled with it next morning. It is true, the Rector made no special\r\nallusion to it in his sermon, though the tone of all his services was so\r\nsad, and his own fine countenance looked so melancholy, that Mr Bury\'s\r\ndevoted followers could all see that he had something on his mind. But\r\nMr Tufton at Salem Chapel was not so reticent. He was a man quite famous\r\nfor his extempore gifts, and who rather liked to preach about any very\r\nrecent public event, which it was evident to all his hearers could not\r\nhave found place in a "prepared" discourse; and his sermon that morning\r\nwas upon wickedness in high places, upon men who sought the confidence\r\nof their fellows only to betray it, and offered to the poor man a hand\r\nred with his sister\'s (metaphorical) blood.\r\n\r\nBut it would be wrong to say that this was the general tone of public\r\nopinion in Grove Street; most people, on the contrary, thought of Mr\r\nCavendish not as a wolf thirsting for the lamb\'s blood, but rather\r\nhimself as a kind of lamb caught in the thicket, and about to be offered\r\nup in sacrifice. Such was the impression of a great many influential\r\npersons who had been wavering hitherto, and inclining on the whole to Mr\r\nCavendish\'s liberal principles and supposed Low-Church views. A man\r\nwhose hand is red metaphorically with your sister\'s blood is no doubt a\r\nhighly objectionable personage; but it is doubtful whether, under the\r\ncircumstances, an enlightened constituency might not consider the man\r\nwho had given a perfectly unstained hand to so thoroughly unsatisfactory\r\na sister as more objectionable still; and the indignation of Grange Lane\r\nat Barbara\'s reappearance was nothing to the fury of George Street, and\r\neven of Wharfside, where the bargees began to scoff openly. Society had\r\nnothing worse to say than to quote Mrs Chiley, and assert that "these\r\nartist people were all adventurers"; and then Grange Lane in general\r\ncould not forget that it "had met" Barbara, nor dismiss from its\r\nconsideration her black eyes, her level brows, and her magnificent\r\ncontralto; whereas in the other region the idea of the Member for\r\nCarlingford marrying "that sort!" cast all the world into temporary\r\ndelirium. It was a still more deadly offence to the small people than to\r\nthe great. And the exceptional standing which poor Mr Lake and his\r\ndaughter Rose used to lay claim to--the "rank of their own" which they\r\npossessed as artists--was a pretension much more disagreeable to the\r\nshopkeepers than to society in general. Thus in every sense Mr Cavendish\r\nhad done the very worst for himself by his ill-timed indulgence; and his\r\nguilt was about the same with most of his critics whether he meant\r\nperfectly well and innocently, or entertained the most guilty intentions\r\never conceived by man.\r\n\r\nAnd all his misfortunes were increased by the fact that the intervening\r\nday was a Sunday. Barbara Lake herself, who did not know what people\r\nwere saying, and who, if she had known, would not have cared, came to\r\nchurch, as was natural, in the morning; and under pretence that the\r\nfamily pew was full, had the assurance, as people remarked, to come to\r\nthe middle aisle, in that same silk dress which rustled like tin, and\r\nmade more demonstration than the richest draperies. The pew-opener\r\ndisapproved of her as much as everybody else did, but she could not turn\r\nthe intruder out; and though Barbara had a long time to wait, and was\r\ncuriously inspected by all the eyes near her while she did so, the end\r\nwas that she got a seat in her rustling silk not very far from where\r\nLucilla sat in deep mourning, a model of every righteous observance. As\r\nfor poor Barbara, she too was very exemplary in church. She meant nobody\r\nany harm, poor soul. She could not help the flashing of those big black\r\neyes, to which the level line above them gave such a curious appearance\r\nof obliqueness--nor was it to be expected that she should deny herself\r\nthe use of her advantages, or omit to "take the second" in all the\r\ncanticles with such melodious liquid tones as made everybody stop and\r\nlook round. She had a perfect right to do it; indeed it was her duty, as\r\nit is everybody\'s duty, to aid to the best of their ability in the\r\nchurch-music of their parish, which was what Lucilla Marjoribanks\r\npersisted in saying in answer to all objections. But the effect was\r\ngreat in the congregation, and even the Rector himself was seen to\r\nchange colour as his eye fell upon the unlucky young woman. Mr\r\nCavendish, for his part, knew her voice the moment he heard it, and gave\r\na little start, and received such a look from his sister, who was\r\nstanding by him, as turned him to stone. Mrs Woodburn looked at him, and\r\nso did her husband, and Mr Centum turned a solemnly inquiring\r\nreproachful gaze upon him from the other side of the aisle. "Oh, Harry,\r\nyou will kill me with vexation! why, for goodness\' sake, did you let her\r\ncome?" his sister whispered when they had all sat down again. "Good\r\nheavens! how could I help it?" cried poor Mr Cavendish, almost loud\r\nenough to be heard. And then by the slight, almost imperceptible, hum\r\naround him, he felt that not only his sister and his committee, but the\r\nRector and all Carlingford, had their eyes upon him, and was thankful to\r\nlook up the lesson, poor man, and bury his face in it. It was a hard\r\npunishment for the indiscretion of an hour.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps of all the people concerned it was the Rector who was the\r\nmost to be pitied. He had staked his honour upon Mr Cavendish\'s\r\nrepentance, and here was he going back, publicly to wallow in the\r\nmire--and it was Sunday when such a worldly subject ought not to be\r\npermitted to enter a good man\'s mind, much less to be discussed and\r\nacted upon as it ought to be if anything was to be done; for there was\r\nlittle more than this sacred day remaining in which to undo the mischief\r\nwhich a too great confidence in human nature had wrought. And then, to\r\ntell the truth, the Rector did not know how to turn back. It would have\r\nbeen hard, very hard, to have told all the people who confided in him\r\nthat he had never had any stronger evidence for Mr Cavendish\'s\r\nrepentance than he now had for his backsliding; and to give in, and let\r\nthe other side have it all their own way, and throw over the candidate\r\nwith whom he had identified himself, was as painful to Mr Bury as if,\r\ninstead of being very Low-Church, he had been the most muscular of\r\nChristians. Being in this state of mind, it may be supposed that his\r\nsister\'s mild wonder and trembling speculations at lunch, when they were\r\nalone together, were well qualified to raise some sparks of that old\r\nAdam, who, though well kept under, still existed in the Rector\'s, as in\r\nmost other human breasts.\r\n\r\n"But, dear Edward, I would not quite condemn him," Miss Bury said. "He\r\nhas been the cause of a good deal of remark, you know, and the poor girl\r\nhas been talked about. He may think it is his duty to make her amends.\r\nFor anything we can tell, he may have the most honourable\r\nintentions----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother his honourable intentions!" said the Rector. Such an\r\nexclamation from him was as bad as the most dreadful oath from an\r\nordinary man, and very nearly made Miss Bury drop from her chair in\r\namazement. Things must have gone very far indeed when the Rector himself\r\ndisregarded all proprieties and the sacredness of the day in such a\r\nwildly-daring fashion. For, to tell the truth, in his secret heart Mr\r\nBury was himself a little of the way of thinking of the people in Grove\r\nStreet. Strictly speaking, if a man has done anything to make a young\r\nwoman be talked about, every well-principled person ought to desire that\r\nhe should make her amends; but at the same time, at such a crisis there\r\nwas little consolation in the fact that the candidate one was supporting\r\nand doing daily battle for had honourable intentions in respect to\r\nBarbara Lake. If it had been Rose Lake, it would still have been a blow;\r\nbut Rose was unspeakably respectable, and nobody could have said a\r\nsyllable on the subject: while Barbara, who came to church in a tin\r\ngown, and rustled up the middle aisle in it, attracting all eyes, and\r\ntook such a second in the canticles that she overwhelmed the choir\r\nitself--Barbara, who had made people talk at Lucilla\'s parties, and had\r\nbeen ten years away, wandering over the face of the earth, nobody could\r\ntell where--governessing, singing, play-acting, perhaps, for anything\r\nthat anybody could tell! A clergyman, it is true, dared not have said\r\nsuch a thing, and Mr Bury\'s remorse would have been bitter could he have\r\nreally believed himself capable even of thinking it; but still it is\r\ncertain that the unconscious, unexpressed idea in his mind was, that the\r\nhonourable intentions were the worst of it--that a candidate might be a\r\nfool, or even an unrepentant sinner, and after all it would be chiefly\r\nhis own concern; but that so much as to dream of making Barbara Lake the\r\nMember\'s wife, was the deepest insult that could be offered to\r\nCarlingford. The Rector carried his burden silently all day, and\r\nscarcely opened his lips, as all his sympathetic following remarked; but\r\nbefore he went to bed he made a singular statement, the complete\r\naccuracy of which an impartial observer might be disposed to doubt, but\r\nwhich Mr Bury uttered with profound sincerity, and with a sigh of\r\nself-compassion. "_Now_ I understand Lucilla Marjoribanks," was what the\r\ngood man said, and he all but puffed out the candle he had just lighted,\r\nwith that sigh.\r\n\r\nLucilla, however, in her own person took no part in it at all, one way\r\nor other. She shook hands very kindly with Barbara, and hoped she would\r\ncome and see her, and made it clearly apparent that _she_ at least bore\r\nno malice. "I am very glad I told Thomas to say nothing about it," she\r\nsaid to Aunt Jemima, who, however, did not know the circumstances, and\r\nwas very little the wiser, as may be supposed.\r\n\r\nAnd then the two ladies walked home together, and Miss Marjoribanks\r\ndevoted herself to her good books. It was almost the first moment of\r\nrepose that Lucilla had ever had in her busy life, and it was a repose\r\nnot only permitted but enjoined. Society, which had all along expected\r\nso much from her, expected now that she should not find herself able for\r\nany exertion; and Miss Marjoribanks responded nobly, as she had always\r\ndone, to the requirements of society. To a mind less perfectly\r\nregulated, the fact that the election which had been so interesting to\r\nher was now about, as may be said, to take place without her, would have\r\nbeen of itself a severe trial; and the sweet composure with which she\r\nbore it was not one of the least remarkable phenomena of the present\r\ncrisis. But the fact was that this Sunday was on the whole an oppressive\r\nday. Mr Ashburton came in for a moment, it is true, between services;\r\nbut he himself, though generally so steady, was unsettled and agitated.\r\nHe had been bearing the excitement well until this last almost\r\nincredible accident occurred, which made it possible that he might not\r\nonly win, but win by a large majority. "The Dissenters have all held out\r\ntill now, and would not pledge themselves," he said to Lucilla, actually\r\nwith a tremble in his voice; and then he told her about Mr Tufton\'s\r\nsermon and the wickedness in high places, and the hand imbrued\r\nmetaphorically in his sister\'s blood.\r\n\r\n"I wonder how he could say so," said Lucilla, with indignation. "It is\r\njust like those Dissenters. What harm was there in going to see her? I\r\nheard of it last night, but even for your interest I would never have\r\nspread such mere gossip as that."\r\n\r\n"No--certainly it is mere gossip," said Mr Ashburton; "but it will do\r\nhim a great deal of harm all the same," and then once more he got\r\nrestless and abstracted. "I suppose it is of no use asking you if you\r\nwould join Lady Richmond\'s party at the Blue Boar? You could have a\r\nwindow almost to yourself, you know, and would be quite quiet."\r\n\r\nLucilla shook her head, and the movement was more expressive than words.\r\n"I did not think you would," said Mr Ashburton; and then he took her\r\nhand, and his looks too became full of meaning. "Then I must say adieu,"\r\nhe said--"adieu until it is all over. I shall not have a moment that I\r\ncan call my own--this will be an eventful week for me."\r\n\r\n"You mean an eventful day," said Lucilla; for Mr Ashburton was not such\r\na novice as to be afraid of the appearance he would have to make at the\r\nnomination. He did not contradict her, but he pressed her hand with a\r\nlook which was equivalent to kissing it, though he was not romantic\r\nenough to go quite that length. When he was gone, Miss Marjoribanks\r\ncould not but wonder a little what he could mean by looking forward to\r\nan eventful week. For her own part, she could not but feel that after so\r\nmuch excitement things would feel rather flat for the rest of the week,\r\nand that it was almost wrong to have an election on a Tuesday. Could it\r\nbe that Mr Ashburton had some other contest or candidateship in store\r\nfor himself which he had not told her about? Such a thing was quite\r\npossible; but what had Lucilla in her mourning to do with worldly\r\ncontingencies? She went back to her seat in the corner of the sofa and\r\nher book of sermons, and read fifty pages before tea-time; she knew how\r\nmuch, because she had put a mark in her book when Mr Ashburton came in.\r\nMarks are very necessary things generally in sermon-books; and Lucilla\r\ncould not but feel pleased to think that since her visitor went away she\r\nhad got over so much ground.\r\n\r\nTo compare Carlingford to a volcano that night (and indeed all the next\r\nday, which was the day of nomination) would be a stale similitude; and\r\nyet in some respects it was like a volcano. It was not the same kind of\r\nexcitement which arises in a town where politics run very high--if there\r\nare any towns nowadays in such a state of unsophisticated nature.\r\nNeither was it a place where simple corruption could carry the day; for\r\nthe freemen of Wharfside were, after all, but a small portion of the\r\npopulation. It was in reality a quite ideal sort of contest--a contest\r\nfor the best man, such as would have pleased the purest-minded\r\nphilosopher. It was the man most fit to represent Carlingford for whom\r\neverybody was looking, not a man to be baited about parish-rates and\r\nReform Bills and the Irish Church;--a man who lived in, or near the\r\ntown, and "dealt regular" at all the best shops; a man who would not\r\ndisgrace his constituency by any unlawful or injudicious sort of\r\nlove-making--who would attend to the town\'s interests and subscribe to\r\nits charities, and take the lead in a general way. This was what\r\nCarlingford was looking for, as Miss Marjoribanks, with that intuitive\r\nrapidity which was characteristic of her genius, had at once remarked;\r\nand when everybody went home from church and chapel, though it was\r\nSunday, the whole town thrilled and throbbed with this great question.\r\nPeople might have found it possible to condone a sin or wink at a mere\r\nbacksliding; but there were few so bigoted in their faith as to believe\r\nthat the man who was capable of marrying Barbara Lake could ever be the\r\nman for Carlingford; and thus it was that Mr Cavendish, who had been\r\nflourishing like a green bay-tree, withered away, as it were, in a\r\nmoment, and the place that had known him knew him no more.\r\n\r\nThe hustings were erected at that central spot, just under the windows\r\nof the Blue Boar, where Grange Lane and George Street meet, the most\r\ncentral point in Carlingford. It was so near that Lucilla could hear the\r\nshouts and the music and all the divers noises of the election, but\r\ncould not, even when she went into the very corner of the window and\r\nstrained her eyes to the utmost, see what was going on, which was a very\r\ntrying position. We will not linger upon the proceedings or excitement\r\nof Monday, when the nomination and the speeches were made, and when the\r\nshow of hands was certainly thought to be in Mr Cavendish\'s favour. But\r\nit was the next day that was the real trial. Lady Richmond and her party\r\ndrove past at a very early hour, and looked up at Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\nwindows, and congratulated themselves that they were so early, and that\r\npoor dear Lucilla would not have the additional pain of seeing them go\r\npast. But Lucilla did see them, though, with her usual good sense, she\r\nkept behind the blind. She never did anything absurd in the way of early\r\nrising on ordinary occasions; but this morning it was impossible to\r\nrestrain a certain excitement, and though it did her no good, still she\r\ngot up an hour earlier than usual, and listened to the music, and heard\r\nthe cabs rattling about, and could not help it if her heart beat\r\nquicker. It was perhaps a more important crisis for Miss Marjoribanks\r\nthan for any other person, save one, in Carlingford; for of course it\r\nwould be foolish to attempt to assert that she did not understand by\r\nthis time what Mr Ashburton meant; and it may be imagined how hard it\r\nwas upon Lucilla to be thus, as it were, in the very outside row of the\r\nassembly--to hear all the distant shouts and sounds, everything that was\r\nnoisy and inarticulate, and conveyed no meaning, and to be out of reach\r\nof all that could really inform her as to what was going on.\r\n\r\nShe saw from her window the cabs rushing past, now with her own\r\nviolet-and-green colours, now with the blue-and-yellow. And sometimes it\r\nseemed to Lucilla that the blue-and-yellow predominated, and that the\r\ncarriages which mounted the hostile standard carried voters in larger\r\nnumbers and more enthusiastic condition. The first load of bargemen that\r\ncame up Grange Lane from the farther end of Wharf side were all Blues;\r\nand when a spectator is thus held on the very edge of the event in a\r\nsuspense which grows every moment more intolerable, especially when he\r\nor she is disposed to believe that things in general go on all the worse\r\nfor his or her absence, it is no wonder if that spectator becomes\r\nnervous, and sees all the dangers at their darkest. What if, after all,\r\nold liking and friendship had prevailed over that beautiful optimism\r\nwhich Lucilla had done so much to instil into the minds of her\r\ntownsfolk? What if something more mercenary and less elevating than the\r\nideal search for the best man, in which she had hoped Carlingford was\r\nengaged, should have swayed the popular mind to the other side? All\r\nthese painful questions went through Lucilla\'s mind as the day crept on;\r\nand her suspense was much aggravated by Aunt Jemima, who took no real\r\ninterest in the election, but who kept saying every ten minutes--"I\r\nwonder how the poll is going on--I wonder what that is they are\r\nshouting--is it \'Ashburton for ever!\' or \'Cavendish for ever!\' Lucilla?\r\nYour ears should be sharper than mine; but I think it is Cavendish."\r\nLucilla thought so too, and her heart quaked within her, and she went\r\nand squeezed herself into the corner of the window, to try whether it\r\nwas not possible to catch a glimpse of the field of battle; and her\r\nperseverance was finally rewarded by the sight of the extremity of the\r\nwooden planks which formed the polling-booth; but there was little\r\nsatisfaction to be got out of that. And then the continual dropping of\r\nAunt Jemima\'s questions drove her wild. "My dear aunt," she said at\r\nlast, "I can see nothing and hear nothing, and you know as much about\r\nwhat is going on as I do"--which, it will be acknowledged, was not an\r\nanswer such as one would have expected from Lucilla\'s perfect temper and\r\nwonderful self-control.\r\n\r\nThe election went on with all its usual commotion while Miss\r\nMarjoribanks watched and waited. Mr Cavendish\'s committee brought their\r\nsupporters very well up in the morning--no doubt by way of making sure\r\nof them, as somebody suggested on the other side; and for some time Mrs\r\nWoodburn\'s party at Masters\'s windows (which Masters had given rather\r\nreluctantly, by way of pleasing the Rector) looked in better spirits and\r\nless anxious than Lady Richmond\'s party, which was at the Blue Boar.\r\nTowards noon Mr Cavendish himself went up to his female supporters with\r\nthe bulletin of the poll--the same bulletin which Mr Ashburton had just\r\nsent down to Lucilla. These were the numbers; and they made Masters\'s\r\ntriumphant, while silence and anxiety fell upon the Blue Boar:--\r\n\r\n    Cavendish       283\r\n    Ashburton       275\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Marjoribanks received this disastrous intelligence, she put\r\nthe note in her pocket without saying a word to Aunt Jemima, and left\r\nher window, and went back to her worsted-work; but as for Mrs Woodburn,\r\nshe gave her brother a hug, and laughed, and cried, and believed in it,\r\nlike a silly woman as she was.\r\n\r\n"It is something quite unlooked-for, and which I never could have\r\ncalculated upon," she said, thrusting her hand into an imaginary\r\nwaistcoat with Mr Ashburton\'s very look and tone, which was beyond\r\nmeasure amusing to all the party. They laughed so long, and were so gay,\r\nthat Lady Richmond solemnly levelled her opera-glass at them with the\r\nair of a woman who was used to elections, but knew how such _parvenus_\r\nhave their heads turned by a prominent position. "That woman is taking\r\nsome of us off," she said, "but if it is me, I can bear it. There is\r\nnothing so vulgar as that sort of thing, and I hope you never encourage\r\nit in your presence, my dears."\r\n\r\nJust at that moment, however, an incident occurred which took up the\r\nattention of the ladies at the windows, and eclipsed even the interest\r\nof the election. Poor Barbara Lake was interested, too, to know if her\r\nfriend would win. She was not entertaining any particular hopes or plans\r\nabout him. Years and hard experiences had humbled Barbara. The Brussels\r\nveil which she used to dream of had faded as much from her memory as\r\npoor Rose\'s Honiton design, for which she had got the prize. At the\r\npresent moment, instead of nourishing the ambitious designs which\r\neverybody laid to her charge, she would have been content with the very\r\ninnocent privilege of talking a little to her next employers about Mr\r\nCavendish, the member for Carlingford, and his visits to her father\'s\r\nhouse. But at the same time, she had once been fond of him, and she took\r\na great interest in him, and was very anxious that he should win. And\r\nshe was in the habit, like so many other women, of finding out, as far\r\nas she could, what was going on, and going to see everything that there\r\nmight be to see. She had brought one of her young brothers with her,\r\nwhose anxiety to see the fun was quite as great as her own; and she was\r\narrayed in the tin dress--her best available garment--which was made\r\nlong, according to the fashion, and which, as Barbara scorned to tuck it\r\nup, was continually getting trodden on, and talked about, and reviled\r\nat, on that crowded pavement. The two parties of ladies saw, and even it\r\nmight be said heard, the sweep of the metallic garment, which was\r\nundergoing such rough usage, and which was her best, poor soul. Lady\r\nRichmond had alighted from her carriage carefully tucked up, though\r\nthere were only a few steps to make, and there was no _lady_ in\r\nCarlingford who would have swept "a good gown" over the stones in such\r\na way; but then poor Barbara was not precisely a lady, and thought it\r\nright to look as if it did not matter. She went up to read the numbers\r\nof the poll--in the sight of everybody; and she clasped her hands\r\ntogether with ecstatic satisfaction as she read; and young Carmine, her\r\nbrother, dashed into the midst of the fray, and shouted "Cavendish for\r\never! hurrah for Cavendish!" and could scarcely be drawn back again to\r\ntake his sister home. Even when she withdrew, she did not go home, but\r\nwent slowly up and down Grange Lane with her rustling train behind her,\r\nwith the intention of coming back for further information. Lady Richmond\r\nand Mrs Woodburn both lost all thought of the election as they watched;\r\nand lo! when their wandering thoughts came back again, the tide had\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nThe tide had turned. Whether it was Barbara, or whether it was fate, or\r\nwhether it was the deadly unanimity of those Dissenters, who, after all\r\ntheir wavering, had at last decided for the man who "dealt" in George\r\nStreet--no one could tell; but by two o\'clock Mr Ashburton was so far\r\nahead that he felt himself justified in sending another bulletin to\r\nLucilla--so far that there was no reasonable hope of the opposite\r\ncandidate ever making up his lost ground. Mrs Woodburn was not a woman\r\nto be content when reasonable hope was over--she clung to the last\r\npossibility desperately, with a pertinacity beyond all reason, and swore\r\nin her heart that it was Barbara that had done it, and cursed her with\r\nher best energies; which, however, as these are not melodramatic days,\r\nwas a thing which did the culprit no possible harm. When Barbara herself\r\ncame back from her promenade in Grange Lane, and saw the altered\r\nnumbers, she again clasped her hands together for a moment, and looked\r\nas if she were going to faint; and it was at that moment that Mr\r\nCavendish\'s eyes fell upon her, as ill fortune would have it. They were\r\nall looking at him as if it was his fault; and the sight of that\r\nsympathetic face was consoling to the defeated candidate. He took off\r\nhis hat before everybody; probably, as his sister afterwards said, he\r\nwould have gone and offered her his arm had he been near enough. How\r\ncould anybody wonder, after that, that things had gone against him, and\r\nthat, notwithstanding all his advantages, he was the loser in the fight?\r\n\r\nAs for Lucilla, she had gone back to her worsted-work when she got Mr\r\nAshburton\'s first note, in which his rival\'s name stood above his own.\r\nShe looked quite composed, and Aunt Jemima went on teasing with her\r\nsenseless questions. But Miss Marjoribanks put up with it all; though\r\nthe lingering progress of these hours from one o\'clock to four, the\r\nsound of cabs furiously driven by, the distant shouts, the hum of\r\nindefinite din that filled the air, exciting every moment a keener\r\ncuriosity, and giving no satisfaction or information, would have been\r\nenough to have driven a less large intelligence out of its wits. Lucilla\r\nbore it, doing as much as she could of her worsted-work, and saying\r\nnothing to nobody, except, indeed, an occasional word to Aunt Jemima,\r\nwho would have an answer. She was not walking about Grange Lane\r\nrepeating a kind of prayer for the success of her candidate, as Barbara\r\nLake was doing; but perhaps, on the whole, Barbara had the easiest time\r\nof it at that moment of uncertainty. When the next report came,\r\nLucilla\'s fingers trembled as she opened it, so great was her emotion;\r\nbut after that she recovered herself as if by magic. She grew pale, and\r\nthen gave a kind of sob, and then a kind of laugh, and finally put her\r\nworsted-work back into her basket, and threw Mr Ashburton\'s note into\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n"It is all right," said Lucilla. "Mr Ashburton is a hundred ahead, and\r\nthey can never make up that. I am so sorry for poor Mr Cavendish. If he\r\nonly had not been so imprudent on Saturday night!"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I don\'t understand you," said Aunt Jemima. "After being so\r\nanxious about one candidate, how can you be so sorry for the other? I\r\nsuppose you did not want them both to win?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think that _was_ what I wanted," said Lucilla, drying her eyes;\r\nand then she awoke to the practical exigencies of the position. "There\r\nwill be quantities of people coming to have a cup of tea, and I must\r\nspeak to Nancy," she said, and went downstairs with a cheerful heart. It\r\nmight be said to be as good as decided, so far as regarded Mr Ashburton;\r\nand when it came for her final judgment, what was it that she ought to\r\nsay?\r\n\r\nIt was very well that Miss Marjoribanks\'s unfailing foresight led her to\r\nspeak to Nancy; for the fact was, that after four o\'clock, when the\r\npolling was over, everybody came in to tea. All Lady Richmond\'s party\r\ncame, as a matter of course, and Mr Ashburton himself, for a few\r\nminutes, bearing meekly his new honours; and so many more people\r\nbesides, that but for knowing it was a special occasion, and that "our\r\ngentleman" was elected, Nancy\'s mind never could have borne the strain.\r\nAnd the tea that was used was something frightful. As for Aunt Jemima,\r\nwho had just then a good many thoughts of her own to occupy her, and did\r\nnot care so much as the rest for all the chatter that was going on, nor\r\nfor all those details about poor Barbara and Mr Cavendish\'s looks, which\r\nLucilla received with such interest, she could not but make a\r\ncalculation in passing as to this new item of fashionable expenditure\r\ninto which her niece was plunging so wildly. To be sure, it was an\r\noccasion that never might occur again, and everybody was so excited as\r\nto forget even that Lucilla was in mourning, and that such a number of\r\npeople in the house so soon might be more than she could bear. And she\r\nwas excited herself, and forgot that she was not able for it. But still\r\nAunt Jemima, sitting by, could not help thinking, that even five-o\'clock\r\nteas of good quality and unlimited amount would very soon prove to be\r\nimpracticable upon two hundred a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter XLIX_\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Ashburton, it may be supposed, had but little time to think on that\r\neventful evening; and yet he was thinking all the way home, as he drove\r\nback in the chilly spring night to his own house. If his further course\r\nof action had been made in any way to depend upon the events of this\r\nday, it was now settled beyond all further uncertainty; and though he\r\nwas not a man in his first youth, nor a likely subject for a romantic\r\npassion, still he was a little excited by the position in which he found\r\nhimself. Miss Marjoribanks had been his inspiring genius, and had\r\ninterested herself in his success in the warmest and fullest way; and if\r\never a woman was made for a certain position, Lucilla was made to be the\r\nwife of the Member for Carlingford. Long, long ago, at the very\r\nbeginning of her career, when it was of Mr Cavendish that everybody was\r\nthinking, the ideal fitness of this position had struck everybody.\r\nCircumstances had changed since then, and Mr Cavendish had fallen, and a\r\nworthier hero had been placed in his stead; but though the person was\r\nchanged, the circumstances remained unaltered. Natural fitness was\r\nindeed so apparent, that many people would have been disposed to say\r\nthat it was Lucilla\'s duty to accept Mr Ashburton, even independent of\r\nthe fact that he was perfectly eligible in every other respect.\r\n\r\nBut with all this the new Member for Carlingford was not able to assure\r\nhimself that there had been anything particular in Lucilla\'s manner to\r\nhimself. With her as with Carlingford, it was pure optimism. He was the\r\nbest man, and her quick intelligence had divined it sooner than anybody\r\nelse had done. Whether there was anything more in it, Mr Ashburton could\r\nnot tell. His own impression was that she would accept him; but if she\r\ndid not, he would have no right to complain of "encouragement," or to\r\nthink himself jilted. This was what he was thinking as he drove home;\r\nbut at the same time he was very far from being in a desponding state of\r\nmind. He felt very nearly as sure that Lucilla would be his wife, as if\r\nthey were already standing before the Rector in Carlingford Church. He\r\nhad just won one victory, which naturally made him feel more confident\r\nof winning another; and even without entertaining any over-exalted\r\nopinion of himself, it was evident that, under all the circumstances, a\r\nwoman of thirty, with two hundred a year, would be a fool to reject such\r\nan offer. And Lucilla was the very furthest in the world from being a\r\nfool. It was in every respect the beginning of a new world to Mr\r\nAshburton, and it would have been out of nature had he not been a little\r\nexcited. After the quiet life he had led at the Firs, biding his time,\r\nhe had now to look forward to a busy and important existence, half of it\r\nspent amid the commotion and ceaseless stir of town. A new career, a\r\nwife, a new position, the most important in his district--it was not\r\nmuch wonder if Mr Ashburton felt a little excited. He was fatigued at\r\nthe same time, too much fatigued to be disposed for sleep; and all these\r\nunited influences swayed him to a state of mind very much unlike his\r\nordinary sensible calm. All his excitement culminated so in thoughts of\r\nLucilla, that the new Member felt himself truly a lover; and late as the\r\nhour was, he took up a candle and once more made a survey all alone of\r\nhis solitary house.\r\n\r\nNothing could look more dismal than the dark rooms, where there was\r\nneither light nor fire--the great desert drawing-room, for example,\r\nwhich stood unchanged as it had been in the days of his grand-aunts, the\r\ngood old ladies who had bequeathed the Firs to Mr Ashburton. He had made\r\nno change in it, and scarcely ever used it, keeping to his library and\r\ndining-room, with the possibility, no doubt, always before him of\r\npreparing it in due course of time for his wife. That moment had now\r\narrived, and in his excitement he went into the desolate room with his\r\ncandle, which just made the darkness visible, and tried to see the dusky\r\ncurtains and faded carpet, and the indescribable fossil air which\r\neverything had. There were the odd little spider-legged stands, upon\r\nwhich the Miss Penrhyns had placed their work-boxes, and the old sofas\r\non which they had sat, and the floods of old tapestry-work with which\r\nthey had decorated their favourite sitting-room. The sight of it chilled\r\nthe Member for Carlingford, and made him sad. He tried to turn his\r\nthoughts to the time when this same room should be fitted up to suit\r\nLucilla\'s complexion, and should be gay with light and with her\r\npresence. He did all he could to realise the moment when, with a\r\nmistress so active and energetic, the whole place would change its\r\naspect, and glow forth resplendent into the twilight of the county, a\r\ncentral point for all. Perhaps it was his fatigue which gained upon him\r\njust at this moment, and repulsed all livelier thoughts; but the fact\r\nis, that however willing Lucilla might turn out to be, her image was\r\ncoy, and would not come. The more Mr Ashburton tried to think of her as\r\nin possession here, the more the grim images of the two old Miss\r\nPenrhyns walked out of the darkness and asserted their prior claims.\r\nThey even seemed to have got into the library before him when he went\r\nback, though there his fire was burning, and his lamp. After that there\r\nwas nothing left for a man to do, even though he had been that day\r\nelected Member for Carlingford, but to yield to the weakness of an\r\nordinary mortal, and go to bed.\r\n\r\nThoughts very different, but even more disturbing, were going on at the\r\nsame time in Grange Lane. Poor Mr Cavendish, for one thing,--upbraided\r\nby everybody\'s looks, and even by some people\'s words--feeling himself\r\ncondemned, censured, and despised on all sides--smarting under his\r\nsister\'s wild reproaches and her husband\'s blunt commentary\r\nthereupon,--had slunk away from their society after dinner, not seeing\r\n_now_ why he should bear it any longer. "By Jove! if it had only been\r\nfor _her_ sake, you might have left over your philandering for another\r\nnight," Mr Woodburn had said, in his coarse way; and it was all Mr\r\nCavendish could do to refrain from saying that one time and another he\r\nhad done quite enough for _her_ sake, but he did not see any reason why\r\nhe should put up with it any longer. He strolled out of doors, though\r\nthe town was still in commotion, and could not but think of the\r\nsympathetic countenance which had paled to-day at sight of the numbers\r\nof the poll. She, by Heaven! might have had reason to find fault with\r\nhim, and she had never done so; _she_ had never perceived that he was\r\nstout, or changed from old times. As he entertained these thoughts, his\r\nsteps going down Grange Lane gradually quickened, but he did not say to\r\nhimself where he was going. He went a very roundabout way, as if he did\r\nnot mean it, as far as St Roque\'s, and then up by the lane to the\r\nfar-off desert extremity of Grove Street. It was simply to walk off his\r\nexcitement and disappointment, and free himself from criticism for that\r\nevening at least; but as he walked he could not help thinking that\r\nBarbara, if she were well dressed, would still be a fine woman, that her\r\nvoice was magnificent in its way, and that about Naples, perhaps, or the\r\nbaths of Lucca, or in Germany, or the south of France, a man might be\r\nable to get on well enough with such a companion, where society was not\r\nso exacting or stiff-starched as in England. And the end was, that the\r\nfeet of the defeated candidate carried him, ere ever he was aware, with\r\nsome kind of independent volition of their own, to Mr Lake\'s door--and\r\nit may be here said, once for all, that this visit was decisive of Mr\r\nCavendish\'s fate.\r\n\r\nThis will not be regarded as anything but a digression by such of\r\nLucilla\'s friends as may be solicitous to know what she was making up\r\nher mind to under the circumstances; but the truth is that Lucilla\'s\r\nhistorian cannot, any more than Miss Marjoribanks herself could, refrain\r\nfrom a certain regret over Mr Cavendish. That was what he came to, poor\r\nman! after all his experiences; a man who was capable of so much better\r\nthings--a man even who, if he had made a right use of his opportunities,\r\nmight once have had as good a chance as any other of marrying Lucilla\r\nherself. If there ever was an instance of chances thrown away and lost\r\nopportunities, surely here was that lamentable example. And thus, poor\r\nman! all his hopes and all his chances came to an end.\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Marjoribanks herself, it would be vain to say that this was\r\nnot a very exciting moment for her. If there ever could be said to be a\r\ntime when she temporarily lost the entire sway and control of herself\r\nand her feelings, it would be at this crisis. She went about all that\r\nevening like a woman in a dream. For the first time in her life she not\r\nonly did not know what she would do, but she did not know what she\r\nwanted to do. There could now be no mistaking what Mr Ashburton\'s\r\nintentions were. Up to a very recent time Lucilla had been able to take\r\nrefuge in her mourning, and conclude that she had no present occasion to\r\ndisturb herself. But now that calm was over. She could not conceal from\r\nherself that it was in her power by a word to reap all the advantages of\r\nthe election, and to step at once into the only position which she had\r\never felt might be superior to her own in Carlingford. At last this\r\ngreat testimonial of female merit was to be laid at her feet. A man\r\nthoroughly eligible in every way--moderately rich, well connected, able\r\nto restore to her all, and more than all, the advantages which she had\r\nlost at her father\'s death--a man, above all, who was Member for\r\nCarlingford, was going to offer himself to her acceptance, and put his\r\nhappiness in her hands; and while she was so well aware of this, she was\r\nnot at all so well aware what answer she would make him. Lucilla\'s mind\r\nwas in such a commotion as she sat over her embroidery, that she thought\r\nit strange indeed that it did not show, and could not understand how\r\nAunt Jemima could sit there so quietly opposite her, as if nothing was\r\nthe matter. But, to tell the truth, there was a good deal the matter\r\nwith Aunt Jemima too, which was perhaps the reason why she saw no signs\r\nof her companion\'s agitation. Mrs John Marjoribanks had not been able\r\nany more than her niece to shut her eyes to Mr Ashburton\'s evident\r\nmeaning, and now that matters were visibly coming to a crisis, a sudden\r\npanic and horror had seized her. What would Tom say? If she stood by and\r\nsaw the prize snapped up under her very eyes, what account could she\r\ngive to her son of her stewardship? how could she explain her silence as\r\nto all _his_ wishes and intentions, her absolute avoidance of his name\r\nin all her conversations with Lucilla? While Miss Marjoribanks marvelled\r\nthat the emotion in her breast could be invisible, and at Aunt Jemima\'s\r\ninsensibility, the bosom of that good woman was throbbing with equal\r\nexcitement. Sometimes each made an indifferent remark, and panted after\r\nit, as if she had given utterance to the most exhausting emotions; but\r\nso great was the preoccupation of both that neither observed how it was\r\nfaring with the other.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps, on the whole, it was Aunt Jemima that suffered the most;\r\nfor her there was nothing flattering, nothing gratifying, no prospect of\r\nchange or increased happiness, or any of the splendours of imagination\r\ninvolved. All that could happen to her would be the displeasure of her\r\nson and his disappointment; and it might be her fault, she who could\r\nhave consented to be chopped up in little pieces, if that would have\r\ndone Tom any good; but who, notwithstanding, was not anxious for him to\r\nmarry his cousin, now that her father\'s fortune was all lost and she had\r\nbut two hundred a year. They had a silent cup of tea together at eight\r\no\'clock, after that noisy exciting one at five, which had been shared by\r\nhalf Carlingford, as Aunt Jemima thought. The buzz of that impromptu\r\nassembly, in which everybody talked at the same moment, and nobody\r\nlistened, except perhaps Lucilla, had all died away into utter\r\nstillness; but the excitement had not died away; _that_ had only risen\r\nto a white heat, silent and consuming, as the two ladies sat over their\r\ntea.\r\n\r\n"Do you expect Mr Ashburton to-morrow, Lucilla?" Aunt Jemima said, after\r\na long pause.\r\n\r\n"Mr Ashburton?" said Lucilla, with a slight start; and, to tell the\r\ntruth, she was glad to employ that childish expedient to gain a little\r\ntime, and consider what she should say. "Indeed I don\'t know if he will\r\nhave time to come. Most likely there will be a great deal to do."\r\n\r\n"If he does come," said Mrs John, with a sigh--"or _when_ he does come,\r\nI ought to say, for you know very well he _will_ come, Lucilla--I\r\nsuppose there is no doubt that he will have something very particular to\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I don\'t know, Aunt Jemima," said Miss Marjoribanks; but she\r\nnever raised her eyes from her work, as she would have done in any other\r\ncase. "Now that the election is over, you know----"\r\n\r\n"I hope, my dear, I have been long enough in the world to know all about\r\nthat," Aunt Jemima said severely, "and what it means when young ladies\r\ntake such interest in elections;" and then some such feeling as the dog\r\nhad in the manger--a jealousy of those who sought the gift though she\r\nherself did not want it--came over Mrs John, and at the same time a\r\nsudden desire to clear her conscience and make a stand for Tom. She did\r\nit suddenly, and went further than she meant to go; but then she never\r\ndreamt it would have the least effect. "I would not say anything to\r\ndisturb your mind, Lucilla, if you have made up your mind; but when you\r\nreceive your new friends, you might think of other people who perhaps\r\nhave been fond of you before you ever saw them, or heard their very\r\nname."\r\n\r\nShe was frightened at it herself before the words were out of her mouth,\r\nand the effect it had upon Miss Marjoribanks was wonderful. She threw\r\nher embroidery away, and looked Tom\'s mother keenly in the face. "I\r\ndon\'t think you know anybody who is fond of me, Aunt Jemima," she said;\r\n"I don\'t suppose anybody is fond of me. Do you?" said Lucilla. But by\r\nthat time Aunt Jemima had got thoroughly frightened, both at herself and\r\nher companion, and had nothing more to say.\r\n\r\n"I am sure all these people to-day have been too much for you," she\r\nsaid. "I wonder what they could all be thinking of, for my part,\r\nflocking in upon you like that, so soon after----I thought it was very\r\nindelicate of Lady Richmond. And Lucilla, my dear, your nerves are quite\r\naffected, and I am sure you ought to go to bed."\r\n\r\nUpon which Miss Marjoribanks recovered herself in a moment, and folded\r\nup her worsted-work. "I do feel tired," she said sweetly, "and perhaps\r\nit _was_ too much. I think I will take your advice, Aunt Jemima. The\r\nexcitement keeps one up for the moment, and then it tells after. I\r\nsuppose the best thing is to go to bed."\r\n\r\n"Much the best, my dear," Aunt Jemima said, giving Lucilla a kiss; but\r\nshe did not take her own advice. She took a long time to think it all\r\nover, and sat up by the side of the decaying fire until it was\r\nmidnight--an hour at which a female establishment like this should\r\nsurely have been all shut up and at rest. And Lucilla did very much the\r\nsame thing, wondering greatly what her aunt could tell her if she had a\r\nmind, and having the greatest inclination in the world to break into her\r\nchamber, and see, at any risk, what was in Tom\'s last letter. If she\r\ncould have seen that, it might have thrown some light on the problem\r\nLucilla was discussing, or given her some guidance through her\r\ndifficulties. It was just then that Mr Ashburton was inviting her image\r\ninto the fossil drawing-room, and finding nothing but the grim shades of\r\nthe Miss Penrhyns answer to his call. Perhaps this was because Lucilla\'s\r\nimage at that moment was called upon more potently from another quarter\r\nin a more familiar voice.\r\n\r\nBut after this exhausting day and late sitting-up, everybody was late in\r\nthe morning, at least in Grange Lane. Miss Marjoribanks had slept\r\nlittle all night, and she was not in a more settled state of mind when\r\nthe day returned which probably would bring the matter to a speedy\r\ndecision. Her mind was like a country held by two armies, one of which\r\nby turns swept the other into a corner, but only to be driven back in\r\nits turn. After the unaccountable stupidity of the general public--after\r\nall the Cavendishes, Beverleys, and Riders who had once had it in their\r\npower to distinguish themselves by at least making her an offer, and who\r\nhad not done it--here at last, in all good faith, honesty, and\r\npromptitude, had appeared a man superior to them all--a man whom she\r\nwould have no reason to be ashamed of in any particular, sensible like\r\nherself, public-spirited like herself--a man whose pursuits she could\r\nenter into fully, who had a perfectly ideal position to offer her, and\r\nin whose person, indeed, all sorts of desirable qualities seemed to\r\nmeet. Miss Marjoribanks, when she considered all this, and thought over\r\nall their recent intercourse, and the terms of friendship into which the\r\nelection had brought them, felt, as any other sensible person would have\r\nfelt, that there was only one answer which could be given to such a man.\r\nIf she neglected or played with his devotion, then certainly she never\r\nwould deserve to have another such possibility afforded to her, and\r\nmerited nothing better than to live and die a single woman on two\r\nhundred a year. But then, on the other hand, there would rush forth a\r\ncrowd of quick-coming and fantastic suggestions which took away\r\nLucilla\'s breath, and made her heart beat loud. What if there might be\r\n"other people" who had been fond of her before she ever heard of Mr\r\nAshburton\'s name? What if there might be some one in the world who was\r\nready, not to offer her his hand and fortune in a reasonable way, as Mr\r\nAshburton no doubt would, but to throw himself all in a heap at her\r\nfeet, and make the greatest fool of himself possible for her sake? Miss\r\nMarjoribanks had been the very soul of good sense all her days, but now\r\nher ruling quality seemed to forsake her. And yet she could not consent\r\nto yield herself up to pure unreason without a struggle. She fought\r\nmanfully, womanfully against the weakness which hitherto must have been\r\nlying hidden in some out-of-the-way corner in her heart. Probably if Mr\r\nAshburton had asked her all at once amid the excitement of the election,\r\nor at any other unpremeditated moment, Lucilla would have been saved all\r\nthis self-torment; but it is hard upon a woman to have a proposal\r\nhanging over her head by a hair, as it were, and to look forward to it\r\nwithout any uncertainty or mystery, and have full time to make up her\r\nmind. And there was no accounting for the curious force and vividness\r\nwith which that strange idea about "other people," upon which Aunt\r\nJemima would throw no light, had come into Lucilla\'s head.\r\n\r\nShe was still in the same frightful chaos of uncertainty when Mr\r\nAshburton was shown into the drawing-room. She had not even heard him\r\nring, and was thus deprived of the one possible moment of coming to a\r\ndecision before she faced and confronted her fate. Miss Marjoribanks\'s\r\nheart gave a great jump, and then she recovered herself, and rose up\r\nwithout faltering, and shook hands with him. She was all alone, for Aunt\r\nJemima had not found herself equal to facing the emergency; and there\r\nwas not the least possibility of evading or postponing, or in any way\r\nrunning away from it now. Lucilla sat down again upon her sofa where she\r\nhad been sitting, and composed herself with a certain despairing\r\ntranquillity, and trusted in Providence. She had thrown herself on other\r\noccasions, though never at an equally important crisis, upon the\r\ninspiration of the moment, and she felt it would not forsake her now.\r\n\r\n"I should be sorry the election was over," said Mr Ashburton, who was\r\nnaturally a little agitated too, "if I thought its privileges were over,\r\nand you would not let me come----I shall always think I owe my success\r\nto you; and I would thank you for being so kind--so very kind to me,\r\nif----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no; pray don\'t say so," cried Lucilla. "I only felt sure that\r\nyou were the best man--the only man--for Carlingford."\r\n\r\n"I wish I might but prove the best man for something else," said the\r\ncandidate nervously; and then he cleared his throat. "I would say you\r\nhad been kind if I did not hope--if I was not so very anxious that you\r\nshould be something more than kind. It may be vain of me, but I think we\r\ncould get on together. I think I could understand you, and do you\r\njustice----Lucilla! what is the matter? Good heavens! is it possible\r\nthat I have taken you quite by surprise?"\r\n\r\nWhat caused this question was that Miss Marjoribanks had all at once\r\nchanged colour, and given a great start, and put her hand to her breast,\r\nwhere her heart had taken such a leap that she felt it in her throat.\r\nBut it was not because of what Mr Ashburton was saying; it was because\r\nof one of the very commonest sounds of everyday existence--a cab\r\ndriving down Grange Lane; but then it was a cab driving in such a way\r\nthat you could have sworn there was somebody in it in a terrible hurry,\r\nand who had just arrived by the twelve o\'clock train.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no," said Miss Marjoribanks; "I know you have always done me\r\nmore than justice, Mr Ashburton, and so have all my friends; and I am\r\nsure we always will get on well together. I wish you joy with all my\r\nheart, and I wish you every happiness; and I always thought, up to this\r\nvery last moment----"\r\n\r\nLucilla stopped again, and once more put her hand to her breast. Her\r\nheart gave another jump, and, if such a thing were possible to a heart,\r\nwent off from its mistress altogether, and rushed downstairs bodily to\r\nsee who was coming. Yet, with all her agitation, she had still enough\r\nself-control to lift an appealing look--a look which threw herself upon\r\nhis mercy, and implored his forbearance--to Mr Ashburton\'s face.\r\n\r\nAs for the Member for Carlingford, he was confounded, and could not tell\r\nwhat to make of it. What was it she had thought up to the very last\r\nmoment? Was this a refusal, or was she only putting off his claim, or\r\nwas it something altogether independent of him and his intentions that\r\nagitated Lucilla to such an unusual extent? While he sat in his\r\nconfusion trying to make it out, the most startling sound interrupted\r\nthe interview. The old disused bell that had so often called Dr\r\nMarjoribanks up at night, and which hung near the door of the old\r\nDoctor\'s room, just over the drawing-room, began to peal through the\r\nsilence, as if rung by a hand too impatient to notice what it was with\r\nwhich it made its summons.\r\n\r\n"Papa\'s bell!" Miss Marjoribanks cried, with a little shriek; and she\r\ngot up trembling, and then dropped upon her seat again, and in her\r\nagitated state burst into tears. And Mr Ashburton felt that, under these\r\nmost extraordinary circumstances, even so sensible a woman as Lucilla\r\nmight be justified in fainting, embarrassing and uncomfortable as that\r\nwould be.\r\n\r\n"I will go and see what it means," he said, with still half the air of a\r\nman who had a right to go and see, and was, as it were, almost in his\r\nown house. As he turned round, the door bell pealed wildly below in\r\ncorrection of the mistake. It was evident that somebody wanted admission\r\nwho had not a moment to lose, and who was in the habit of pulling wildly\r\nat whatever came in his way. Mr Ashburton went out of the room to see\r\nwho it was, a little amused and a little alarmed, but much annoyed at\r\nbottom, as was only natural, at such an interruption. He did not very\r\nwell know whether he was accepted or rejected; but it was equally his\r\nduty in either case to put a stop to the ringing of that ghostly bell.\r\nHe went away, meaning to return immediately and have it out and know his\r\nfate. And Lucilla, whose heart had come back, having fully ascertained\r\nwho it was, and was now choking her with its beating, was left to await\r\nthe new event and the new-comer alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter L_\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Ashburton went away from Lucilla\'s side, thinking to come back again,\r\nand clear everything up: but he did not come back. Though he heard\r\nnothing, and saw nothing, that could throw any distinct light on the\r\nstate of her mind, yet instinct came to his aid, it is to be supposed,\r\nin the matter. He did not return: and Lucilla sat on her sofa with her\r\nhands clasped together to support her, and her heart leaping in her very\r\nmouth. She was in a perfect frenzy of suspense, listening with her whole\r\nheart and soul; but that did not prevent the same crowd of thoughts\r\nwhich had been persecuting her for twenty-four hours from keeping up\r\ntheir wild career as before. What reason had she to suppose that "any\r\none" had arrived? Who could arrive in that accidental way, without a\r\nword of warning? And what possible excuse had she to offer to herself\r\nfor sending the new member for Carlingford--a man so excellent and\r\nhonourable and eligible--away? The minutes, or rather the seconds,\r\npassed over Miss Marjoribanks like hours, as she sat thus waiting, not\r\ndaring to stir lest the slightest movement might keep from her ears some\r\nsound from below, till at last the interval seemed so long that her\r\nheart began to sink, and her excitement to fail. It could not be any\r\none--if it had been any one, something more must have come of it before\r\nnow. It must have been Lydia Richmond coming to see her sister next\r\ndoor, or somebody connected with the election, or----\r\n\r\nWhen she got as far as this, Lucilla\'s heart suddenly mounted up again\r\nwith a spring into her ears. She heard neither words nor voice, but she\r\nheard something which had as great an effect upon her as either could\r\nhave had. On the landing half-way up the stairs, there had stood in Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s house from time immemorial a little old-fashioned table,\r\nwith a large china bowl upon it, in which the cards of visitors were\r\nplaced. It was a great bowl, and it was always full, and anybody rushing\r\nupstairs in a reckless way might easily upset table and cards and all in\r\ntheir progress. This was what happened while Lucilla sat listening.\r\nThere was a rumble, a crash, and a sound as of falling leaves, and it\r\nmade her heart, as we have said, jump into her ears. "It is the table\r\nand all the cards," said Lucilla--and in that moment her composure came\r\nback to her as by a miracle. She unclasped her hands, which she had been\r\nholding pressed painfully together by way of supporting herself, and she\r\ngave a long sigh of unutterable relief, and her whirl of thought stopped\r\nand cleared up with an instantaneous rapidity. Everything seemed to be\r\nexplained by that sound; and there never was a greater change upon the\r\nlooks and feelings of any one in this world than that which passed upon\r\nthe looks and feelings of Lucilla, in the interval between the drawing\r\nup of that cab and the rush of Tom Marjoribanks at the drawing-room\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nFor after the commotion on the staircase Lucilla had no further doubt on\r\nthe subject. She even had the strength to get up to meet him, and hold\r\nout her hands to him by way of welcome--but found herself, before she\r\nknew how, in the arms of a man with a beard, who was so much changed in\r\nhis own person that he ventured to kiss her, which was a thing Tom\r\nMarjoribanks, though her cousin, had never dared to do before. He kissed\r\nher--such was his audacity; and then he held her at arm\'s length to have\r\na good look at her; and then, according to all appearance, would have\r\nrepeated his first salutation, but that Lucilla had come to herself, and\r\ntook the reins at once into her hand.\r\n\r\n"Tom!" she said, "of course it is you; nobody else would have been so\r\nimpertinent. When did you come? Where did you come from? Who could ever\r\nhave thought of your appearing like this, in such an altogether\r\nunexpected----?"\r\n\r\n"Unexpected!" said Tom, with an astonished air. "But I suppose you had\r\nother things to think of. Ah, Lucilla, I could not write to you. I felt\r\nI ought to be beside you, trying if there was not something I could do.\r\nMy mother told you, of course; but I could not trust myself to write to\r\n_you_."\r\n\r\nThen Lucilla saw it all, and that Aunt Jemima had meant to do Mr\r\nAshburton a good turn. And she was not grateful to her aunt, however\r\nkind her intentions might have been. But Tom was holding her hand, and\r\nlooking into her face while this thought passed through her mind, and\r\nMiss Marjoribanks was not the woman, under any circumstances, to make\r\ndispeace.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I am very glad," said Lucilla. "I would say you were changed,\r\nbut only of course that would make you think how I am changed; and\r\nthough one knows one has gone off----"\r\n\r\n"I never saw you look so nice all your life," cried Tom energetically;\r\nand he took hold of both her hands, and looked into her face more and\r\nmore. To be sure he had a kind of right, being a cousin, and newly\r\nreturned after so long an absence; but it was embarrassing all the same.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Tom, don\'t say so," cried Lucilla; "if you but knew how different\r\nthe house is, and everything so altered--and dear papa!"\r\n\r\nIt was natural, and indeed it was only proper, that Miss Marjoribanks\r\nshould cry--which she did abundantly, partly for grief, and partly\r\nbecause of the flutter of agitation, and something like joy, in which\r\nshe was, and which, considering that she had always frankly owned that\r\nshe was fond of Tom, was quite natural too. She cried with honest\r\nabandonment, and did not take much notice what her cousin was doing to\r\ncomfort her, though indeed he applied himself to that benevolent office\r\nin the most anxious way.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t cry, Lucilla," he said, "I can\'t bear it. It don\'t look natural\r\nto see you cry. My poor uncle was an old man, and you were always the\r\nbest daughter in the world----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Tom! sometimes I don\'t think so," sobbed Lucilla; "sometimes I\r\nthink if I had sat up that last night----And you don\'t know how good he\r\nwas. It was me he was thinking of, and never himself. When he heard the\r\nmoney was lost, all that he said was, Poor Lucilla! You rang his bell\r\nthough it is the night-bell, and nobody ever touches it now; I knew it\r\ncould be nobody but you; and to see you again brings up everything so\r\ndistinctly. Oh, Tom! he was always very fond of you."\r\n\r\n"Lucilla," said Tom Marjoribanks, "you know I always had a great regard\r\nfor my uncle. But it was not for him I came back. He was never half so\r\nfond of me as I am of you. You know that as well as I do. There never\r\nwas a time that I would not have gone to the other end of the world if\r\nyou had told me; and I have done it as near as possible. I went to India\r\nbecause you sent me away. And I have come back----"\r\n\r\n"You have not come back only for an hour, I hope?" said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks, with momentary impatience; "you are not obliged to talk of\r\neverything all in a moment--and when one has not even got over one\'s\r\nsurprise at seeing you. When _did_ you come back? When did you have\r\nanything to eat? You want your breakfast or your lunch or something;\r\nand, Tom! the idea of sitting here talking to me, and talking nonsense,\r\nwhen you have not seen your mother. She is in her own room, you\r\nunnatural boy--the blue room, next to what used to be yours. To think\r\nAunt Jemima should be in the house, and you should sit here talking\r\nnonsense to me!"\r\n\r\n"This minute," said Tom apologetically; but he drew his chair in front\r\nof Miss Marjoribanks, so that she could not get away. "I have come back\r\nto stay as long as you will let me," he said; "don\'t go away yet. Look\r\nhere, Lucilla--if you had married, I would have tried to bear it; but as\r\nlong as you are not married, I can\'t help feeling as if there might be a\r\nchance for me yet. And that is why I have come home. I met somebody\r\ncoming downstairs."\r\n\r\n"Tom," said Miss Marjoribanks, "it is dreadful to see that you have come\r\nback just as tiresome as ever. I always said I would not marry for ten\r\nyears. If you mean to think I have never had any opportunities----"\r\n\r\n"Lucilla," said Tom, and there was decision in his eye, "somebody came\r\ndownstairs as I came in. I want to know whether it is to be him or me!"\r\n\r\n"Him--or you!" said Lucilla, in dismay. Blunderer as he was, he had gone\r\ndirect to the very heart of the question, and it was impossible not to\r\ntremble a little in the presence of such straightforward\r\nclear-sightedness. Miss Marjoribanks had risen up to make her escape as\r\nsoon as it should be possible, but she was so much struck by Tom\'s\r\nunlooked-for perspicuity, that she sat down again in her consternation.\r\n"I think you are going out of your mind," she said. "What do you know\r\nabout the gentleman who went downstairs? I am not such a wonderful\r\nbeauty, nor such a witch, that everybody who sees me should want to--to\r\nmarry me. Don\'t talk any more nonsense, but let me go and get you\r\nsomething to eat."\r\n\r\n"They would if they were of my way of thinking," said the persistent\r\nTom. "Lucilla, you shan\'t go. This is what I have come home for. You may\r\nas well know at once, and then there can be no mistake about it. My poor\r\nuncle is gone, and you can\'t be left by yourself in the world. Will you\r\nhave him or me?"\r\n\r\n"I am not going to be tyrannised over like this," said Lucilla, with\r\nindignation, again rising, though he still held her hands. "You talk as\r\nif you had just come for a call, and had everything to say in a moment.\r\nWhen a man comes off a long journey it is his breakfast he wants, and\r\nnot a--not anything else that I know of. Go up to your mother, and let\r\nme go."\r\n\r\n"Will you have him or me?" repeated Tom. It was not wisdom, is was\r\ninstinct, that made him thus hold fast by his text; and as for Lucilla,\r\nnothing but the softened state in which she was, nothing but the fact\r\nthat it was Tom Marjoribanks who had been ten years away, and was always\r\nridiculous, could have kept her from putting down at once such an\r\nattempt to coerce her. But the truth was, that Miss Marjoribanks did not\r\nfeel her own mistress at that moment, and perhaps that was why he had\r\nthe audacity to repeat, "Will you have him or me?"\r\n\r\nThen Lucilla found herself fairly driven to bay. "Tom!" she said, with a\r\nsolemnity that overwhelmed him for the moment, for he thought at first,\r\nwith natural panic, that it was himself who was being rejected, "I would\r\nnot have _him_ if he were to go down on his knees. I know he is very\r\nnice and very agreeable, and the best man----And I am sure I ought to do\r\nit," said Miss Marjoribanks, with a mournful sense of her own weakness;\r\n"and everybody will expect it of me; but I am not going to have him, and\r\nI never meant it, whatever you or anybody may say."\r\n\r\nWhen Lucilla had made this decisive utterance she turned away with a\r\ncertain melancholy majesty to go and see after lunch--for he had loosed\r\nher hand and fallen back in consternation, thinking for the moment that\r\nit was all over. Miss Marjoribanks sighed, and turned round, not\r\nthinking of Tom, who was safe enough, but with a natural regret for the\r\nmember for Carlingford, who now, poor man, was as much out of the\r\nquestion as if he had been dead and buried. But before she reached the\r\ndoor Tom had recovered himself. He went up to her in his ridiculous way\r\nwithout the slightest regard either for the repast she was so anxious to\r\nprepare for him, or for his mother\'s feelings, or indeed for anything\r\nelse in the world, except the one thing which had brought him, as he\r\nsaid, home.\r\n\r\n"Then, Lucilla, after all, it is to be me," he said, taking her to him,\r\nand arresting her progress as if she had been a baby; and though he had\r\nsuch a beard, and was twice as big and strong as he used to be, there\r\nwere big tears in the great fellow\'s eyes. "It is to be me after all,"\r\nsaid Tom, looking at her in a way that startled Lucilla. "Say it is to\r\nbe me!"\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks had come through many a social crisis with dignity and\r\ncomposure. She had never yet been known to fail in an emergency. She had\r\nmanaged Mr Cavendish, and, up to the last moment, Mr Ashburton, and all\r\nthe intervening candidates for her favour, with perfect self-control and\r\ncommand of the situation. Perhaps it was because, as she had herself\r\nsaid, her feelings had never been engaged. But now, when it was only\r\nTom--he whom, once upon a time, she had dismissed with affectionate\r\ncomposure, and given such excellent advice to, and regarded in so\r\nmotherly a way--all Lucilla\'s powers seemed to fail her. It is hard to\r\nhave to wind up with such a confession after having so long entertained\r\na confidence in Lucilla which nothing seemed likely to impair. She broke\r\ndown just at the moment when she had most need to have all her wits\r\nabout her. Perhaps it was her past agitation which had been too much for\r\nher. Perhaps it was the tears in Tom Marjoribanks\'s eyes. But the fact\r\nwas that Lucilla relinquished her superior position for the time being,\r\nand suffered him to make any assertion he pleased, and was so weak as to\r\ncry, for the second time, too--which, of all things in the world, was\r\nsurely the last thing to have been expected of Miss Marjoribanks at the\r\nmoment which decided her fate.\r\n\r\nLucilla cried, and acquiesced, and thought of her father and of the\r\nMember for Carlingford, and gave to each a tear and a regret; and she\r\ndid not even take the trouble to answer any question, or to think who it\r\nwas she was leaning on. It was to be Tom after all--after all the\r\narchdeacons, doctors, generals, members of Parliament--after the ten\r\nyears and more in which she had not gone off--after the poor old\r\nDoctor\'s grudge against the nephew whom he did not wish to inherit his\r\nwealth, and Aunt Jemima\'s quiet wiles, and attempt to disappoint her\r\nboy. Fate and honest love had been waiting all the time till their\r\nmoment came; and now it was not even necessary to say anything about it.\r\nThe fact was so clear that it did not require stating. It was to be Tom\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nTo do him justice, Tom behaved at this moment, in which affairs were\r\nleft in his hands, as if he had been training for it all his life.\r\nPerhaps it was the first time in which he had done anything absolutely\r\nwithout a blunder. He had wasted no time, and no words, and left no room\r\nfor consideration, or for that natural relenting towards his rival which\r\nwas inevitable as soon as Mr Ashburton was off the field. He had\r\ninsisted, and he had perceived that there was but one alternative for\r\nLucilla. Now that all was over, he took her back to her seat, and\r\ncomforted her, and made no offensive demonstrations of triumph. "It is\r\nto be me after all!" he repeated; and it was utterly impossible to add\r\nanything to the eloquent brevity of this succinct statement of the case.\r\n\r\n"Tom," said Miss Marjoribanks, when she had a little recovered, "if it\r\nis to be you, that is no reason why you should be so unnatural. Go up\r\ndirectly and see your mother. What will Aunt Jemima think of me if she\r\nknows I have let you stay talking nonsense here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lucilla--this moment," said Tom; but all the same he showed not\r\nthe slightest inclination to go away. He did not quite believe in it as\r\nyet, and could not help feeling as if, should he venture to leave her,\r\nthe whole fabric of his incredible good fortune must dissolve and melt\r\naway. As for Lucilla, her self-possession gradually came back to her\r\nwhen the crisis was over, and she felt that her involuntary abdication\r\nhad lasted long enough, and that it was full time to take the management\r\nof affairs back into her own hands.\r\n\r\n"You shall go _now_," she said, drying her eyes, "or else you cannot\r\nstay here. I thought of letting you stay in the house, as Aunt Jemima is\r\nwith me; but if you do not mean to go and tell your mother, I will tell\r\nNancy to send your things up to the Blue Boar. Ring the bell, please; if\r\nyou will not ring the bell, I will do it myself, Tom. You may say what\r\nyou like, but I know you are famishing; and Aunt Jemima is in the blue\r\nroom, next door to----Oh, here is Nancy. It is Mr Tom, who has come\r\nhome," said Lucilla hastily, not without a rising colour; for it was\r\nhard to explain why, when his mother was in the blue room all this\r\ntime, he should have stayed here.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Lucilla--so I heard," said Nancy, dropping a doubtful\r\ncurtsey. And then only Tom was persuaded, and bethought himself of his\r\nnatural duty, and rushed upstairs. He seized Nancy\'s hand, and shook it\r\nviolently, as he passed her, to her great consternation. The moment of\r\nhis supremacy was over. It was to be Tom after all; but Lucilla had\r\nrecovered her self-possession, and taken the helm in her hand again, and\r\nTom was master of the situation no more.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is Mr Tom," said Lucilla, shaking her head with something\r\nbetween a smile and a sigh. "It could be nobody but him that would ring\r\n_that_ bell, and upset all the cards. I hope he has not broken dear\r\npapa\'s punch-bowl that he used to be so fond of. He must have something\r\nto eat, Nancy, though he is such an awkward boy."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see nothing like a boy in him," said Nancy; "he\'s big and\r\nstout, and one o\' them awful beards. There\'s been a deal of changes\r\nsince he went away; but if he\'s new comed off that terrible long\r\njourney, it is but natural, as you say, Miss Lucilla, that he should\r\nwant something to eat."\r\n\r\nAnd then Miss Marjoribanks made various suggestions, which were received\r\nstill doubtfully by her prime minister. Nancy, to tell the truth, did\r\nnot like the turn things were taking. Lucilla\'s maiden household had\r\nbeen on the whole getting along very comfortably, and there was no\r\ntelling how long it might have lasted without any new revolution. To be\r\nsure, Mr Ashburton had looked dangerous, but Nancy had seen a great many\r\ndangers of that kind blow over, and was not easily alarmed. Mr Tom,\r\nhowever, was a very different person; and Nancy was sufficiently\r\npenetrating to see that something had happened. Therefore, she received\r\nvery coldly Lucilla\'s suggestions about lunch. "It ain\'t like the old\r\ntimes," she said at last, "when there was always something as one could\r\nput to the fire in a hurry;" and Nancy stood turning round the handle of\r\nthe door in her hand, and contemplating the changed state of affairs\r\nwith a sigh.\r\n\r\n"That would be all very true if you were like anybody else," said\r\nLucilla; "but I hope you would not like to send Mr Tom off to the Blue\r\nBoar. After all, perhaps it is better to have a--a gentleman in the\r\nhouse. I know you always used to think so. They are a great deal of\r\ntrouble; but--for some things, you know----" said Lucilla; "and then Mr\r\nTom is not just like other people; and whatever happens, Nancy, you are\r\nan old dear, and it shall never make any difference between you and me."\r\n\r\nWhen she had said these words, Lucilla gave her faithful servant a hug,\r\nand sent her off to look after Tom Marjoribanks\'s meal; and then she\r\nherself went half-way downstairs and picked up the cards that were still\r\nscattered about the landing, and found with satisfaction that the\r\nDoctor\'s old punch-bowl was not broken. All Tom\'s things were lying\r\nbelow in the hall--heaps of queer Indian-looking baggage--tossed down\r\nanyhow in a corner, as if the owner had been in much too great a hurry\r\nto think of any secondary circumstances. "And it was there he met poor\r\nMr Ashburton," said Lucilla to herself, with a certain pathos. There it\r\nwas indeed that the encounter had taken place. They had seen each other\r\nbut for a moment, but that moment had been enough to send the Member for\r\nCarlingford away dejected, and to impress upon Tom\'s mind the\r\nalternative that it was either to be "him or me." Miss Marjoribanks\r\ncontemplated the spot with a certain tender sentimental interest, as any\r\ngentle moralist might look at a field of battle. What feelings must have\r\nbeen in the minds of the two as they met and looked at each other! What\r\na dread sense of disappointment on the one side; what sharp stimulation\r\non the other! Thus Lucilla stood and looked down from her own landing\r\nupon the scene of that encounter, full of pensive interest. And now it\r\nwas all over, and Mr Ashburton had passed away as completely as Mr\r\nChiltern, who was in his grave, poor man; or Mr Cavendish, who was going\r\nto marry Barbara Lake. The thought of so sudden a revolution made\r\nLucilla giddy as she went thoughtfully upstairs. Poor Mr Ashburton! It\r\nhardly seemed real even to Miss Marjoribanks when she sat down again in\r\nthe drawing-room, and confessed to herself that, after all, it was to be\r\nTom.\r\n\r\nBut when he came downstairs again with his mother, Lucilla was quite\r\nherself, and had got over all her weakness. Aunt Jemima, for her part,\r\nwas in a very agitated state of mind. Tom had come too soon or Mr\r\nAshburton too late, and all the fruits of her little bit of treachery\r\nwere accordingly lost, and at the same time, the treachery itself\r\nremained, revealed at least to one person in the very clearest light.\r\nIt did not seem possible to Aunt Jemima that Lucilla would not tell. If\r\nshe had not done it now, in the excitement of the moment, at least it\r\nwould come out some time when she was least expecting it, and her son\'s\r\nesteem and confidence would be lost. Therefore it was with a very blank\r\ncountenance that Mrs John Marjoribanks came downstairs. She dared not\r\nsay a word, and she had to kiss her niece, and take her to her maternal\r\nbosom, Tom looking on all the while; but she gave Lucilla a look that\r\nwas pitiful to see. And when Tom finally was dismissed to his room, to\r\nopen his trunks, and show the things he had brought home, Aunt Jemima\r\ndrew near her future daughter with wistful guiltiness. There was no\r\ncomfort to her in the thought of the India shawl, which her son had gone\r\nto find. Any day, any hour, Lucilla might tell; and if the unlucky\r\nmother were put on her defence, what could she say?\r\n\r\n"Lucilla," said the guilty woman, under her breath, "I am sure you think\r\nit very strange. I don\'t attempt to deceive _you_. I can\'t tell you how\r\nthankful and glad I am that it has all ended so well; but you know,\r\nLucilla, in the first place, I did not know what your feelings were; and\r\nI thought, perhaps, that if anything would tell, it would be a surprise,\r\nand then----"\r\n\r\n"Did you, Aunt Jemima?" said Miss Marjoribanks, with gentle wonder. "I\r\nthought you had been thinking of Mr Ashburton, for my part."\r\n\r\n"And so I was, Lucilla," said the poor lady, with great relief and\r\neagerness. "I thought he was coming forward, and of course he would have\r\nbeen a far better match than my Tom. I had to think for you both, my\r\ndear. And then I never knew what your feelings were, nor if you would\r\ncare; and then it was not as if there had been a day fixed----"\r\n\r\n"Dear Aunt Jemima," said Miss Marjoribanks, "if you are pleased now,\r\nwhat does it matter? but I do hope you are pleased now?"\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs John took her niece into her arms again this time with better\r\nwill, and cried. "I am as happy as ever I can be," said the inconsistent\r\nmother. "I always knew you were fond of each other, Lucilla; before you\r\nknew it yourselves, I saw what would come of it. But my poor\r\nbrother-in-law----And you will make my boy happy, and never turn him\r\nagainst his mother," cried the repentant sinner. Lucilla was not the\r\nwoman to resist such an appeal. Mrs John had meant truly enough towards\r\nher in other ways, if not in this way; and Miss Marjoribanks was fond of\r\nher aunt, and it ended in a kiss of peace freely bestowed, and a vow of\r\nprotection and guidance from the strong to the weak, though the last was\r\nonly uttered in the protectress\'s liberal heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter LI_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Marjoribanks had time to consider the prospect which had thus\r\nso suddenly opened before her, it also had its difficulties, like\r\neverything else in the world. Her marriage now could not be the\r\nstraightforward business it might have been had it been Mr Ashburton\r\ninstead of Tom. In that case she would have gone to an established house\r\nand life--to take her place in the one and her share in the other, and\r\nto find the greater part of her surroundings and duties already fixed\r\nfor her, which was a thing that would have very greatly simplified the\r\nmatter. But Tom, who had dashed home from India at full speed as soon as\r\nhe heard of his uncle\'s death, had left his profession behind him at\r\nCalcutta, and had nothing to do in England, and was probably too old to\r\nresume his (non) practice at the bar, even if he had been in the least\r\ndisposed to do so; while, at the same time, an idle man--a man to be\r\nfound everlastingly at home--would have been insupportable to Lucilla.\r\nMiss Marjoribanks might feel disposed (for everybody\'s good) to assume\r\nthe sovereign authority in her own house, but to marry anybody that\r\nwould be merely an appendage to her was a thing not to be thought of;\r\nand as soon as the first preliminaries were arranged her active mind\r\nsprang up with redoubled vigour from the maze in which it had been. Her\r\nintelligence had suspended, so to speak, all its ordinary operations for\r\ntwenty-four hours at least, while it was busy investigating the purely\r\npersonal question: from the moment when the Member for Carlingford was\r\nfinally elected until Tom Marjoribanks rang the night-bell at the old\r\nDoctor\'s door, Lucilla\'s thoughts had been in that state of\r\nover-stimulation and absorption which is almost as bad as having no\r\npower of thought at all. But as soon as the pressure was removed--as\r\nsoon as it was all over, and the decision made, and no further question\r\nwas possible--then Miss Marjoribanks\'s active mind sprang up with\r\nrenewed energy. For it was not only a new beginning, but everything had\r\nto be settled and arranged.\r\n\r\nHer mind was full of it while her hands were busy putting away all the\r\nIndian presents which Tom had brought--presents which were chronological\r\nin their character, and which he had begun to accumulate from the very\r\nbeginning of his exile. It could not but be touching to Lucilla to see\r\nhow he had thought of her for all these years; but her mind being, as\r\neverybody is aware, of a nobly practical kind, her thoughts, instead of\r\ndallying with these tokens of the past, went forward with serious\r\nsolicitude into the future. The marriage could not take place until the\r\nyear was out; and there was, accordingly, time to arrange everything,\r\nand to settle all the necessary preliminaries to a point as near\r\nperfection as is possible to merely human details. Tom, no doubt, was\r\nvery urgent and pressing, and would have precipitated everything, and\r\nhad the whole business concluded to-morrow, if he could have had his\r\nway. But the fact was that, having once given in to him in the memorable\r\nway which we have already recorded, Lucilla did not now, so far as the\r\nfinal arrangements were concerned, make much account of Tom\'s wishes.\r\nHeaven be praised, there was one of the two who knew what was right and\r\nproper, and was not to be moved from the correct path by any absurd\r\nrepresentations. Miss Marjoribanks was revolving all these important\r\nquestions when she laid her hand by chance, as people say, upon the\r\n_Carlingford Gazette_, all damp and inky, which had just been laid upon\r\nthe library table. It contained, of course, all the news of the\r\nelection, but Lucilla was too well acquainted with that beforehand to\r\nthink of condescending to derive her information from a newspaper. She\r\nlooked at the advertisements with an eye which saw all that was there\r\nwithout pausing upon anything in particular. She saw the usual notice\r\nabout marmalade oranges, and the announcement that young Mr Vincent, who\r\nafter that made himself so well known in Carlingford, was to preach the\r\nnext Sunday in Salem Chapel, and all the other important novelties in\r\nthe place; but naturally she took but a moderate amount of interest in\r\nsuch details as these.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, Lucilla\'s eye, which, if it could ever be said to be\r\nvacant, had been regarding vacantly the list of advertisements, kindled\r\nup, and all its usual energy and intelligence came back to it. Her\r\nthoughtful face woke up as from a dream. Her head, which had been\r\ndrooping in pensive meditation, grew erect--her whole figure expanded.\r\nShe clasped her hands together, as if in the fervour of the moment,\r\nnobody else being present, she could not refrain from shaking hands with\r\nherself, and giving vent to a self-congratulation. "It is a special\r\nprovidence," said Lucilla to herself, with her usual piety; and then she\r\nfolded up the paper in a little square, with the announcement in the\r\nmiddle which had struck her so much, and placed it where Tom could not\r\nfail to see it when he came in, and went upstairs with a new and\r\ndefinite direction given to her thoughts. That was how it must be!\r\nLucilla, for her part, felt no difficulty in discerning the leadings of\r\nProvidence, and she could not but appreciate the readiness with which\r\nher desires were attended to, and the prompt clearing-up of her\r\ndifficulties. There are people whose inclinations Providence does not\r\nseem to superintend with such painstaking watchfulness; but then, no\r\ndoubt, that must be their own fault.\r\n\r\nAnd when Tom came in, they had what Aunt Jemima called "one of their\r\ndiscussions" about their future life, although the only thing in it\r\nworthy consideration, so far as Tom was concerned, seemed to be the time\r\nwhen they should be married, which occupied at present all that hero\'s\r\nfaculties. "Everything else will arrange itself after, you know," he\r\nsaid, with calm confidence. "Time enough for all the rest. The thing is,\r\nLucilla, to decide when you will leave off those formalities, and let It\r\nbe. Why shouldn\'t it be now? Do you think my uncle would wish to keep us\r\nunhappy all for an idea?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Tom, I am not in the least unhappy," said Lucilla, interrupting\r\nhim sweetly, "nor you either, unless you tell dreadful stories; and as\r\nfor poor dear papa," Miss Marjoribanks added, with a sigh, "if we were\r\nto do exactly as _he_ wished, I don\'t think It would ever be. If you\r\nwere not so foolish, you would not oblige me to say such things. Tom,\r\nlet us leave off talking nonsense--the thing that we both want is\r\nsomething to do."\r\n\r\n"That is what _I_ want," said Tom quickly, "but as for you, Lucilla, you\r\nshall do nothing but enjoy yourself and take care of yourself. The idea\r\nof _you_ wanting something to do!"\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks regarded her betrothed with mild and affectionate\r\ncontempt as he thus delivered himself of his foolish sentiments. "It is\r\nof no use trying to make him understand," she said, with an air of\r\nresignation. "Do you know that I have always been doing something, and\r\nresponsible for something, all my life?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my poor darling," said Tom, "I know; but now you are in my hands I\r\nmean to take care of you, Lucilla; you shall have no more anxiety or\r\ntrouble. What is the good of a man if he can\'t save the woman he is fond\r\nof from all that?" cried the honest fellow--and Lucilla could not but\r\ncast a despairing glance round her, as if appealing to heaven and earth.\r\nWhat was to be done with a man who had so little understanding of her,\r\nand of himself, and of the eternal fitness of things?\r\n\r\n"My dear Tom," she said once more, mildly, "we may have lost some money,\r\nbut we are very well off, and Providence has been very kind to us. And\r\nthere are a great many poor people in the world who are not so well off.\r\nI have always tried to be of some use to my fellow-creatures," said\r\nLucilla, "and I don\'t mean, whatever you may say, to give it up now."\r\n\r\n"My dearest Lucilla, if it was the poor you were thinking of----! I\r\nmight have known it was something different from my stupid notions,"\r\ncried Tom. This kind of adoration was new to Lucilla, notwithstanding\r\nher many experiences. And he thought it so good of her to condescend to\r\nbe good, that she could not help thinking a little better of herself\r\nthan ordinary, though that, perhaps, was not absolutely needful; and\r\nthen she proceeded with the elucidation of her views.\r\n\r\n"I have been of some use to my fellow-creatures in my way," said Miss\r\nMarjoribanks modestly, "but it has been hard work, and people are not\r\nalways grateful, you know. And then things are a good deal changed in\r\nCarlingford. A woman may devote herself to putting some life into\r\nsociety, and give up years of her time, and--and even her opportunities\r\nand all that, and do a great deal of good; but yet if she is put aside\r\nfor a moment, there is an end of it. I have been doing the best I could\r\nfor Carlingford for ten years," said Lucilla, with a little natural\r\nsadness, "and if any one were to examine into it, where is it all now?\r\nThey have only got into the way of looking to me; and I do believe if\r\nyou were to go up and down from Elsworthy\'s to St Roque\'s, though you\r\nmight find people at dinner here and there, you would not find a shadow\r\nof what could really be called society in all Grange Lane!"\r\n\r\nLucilla paused, for naturally her feelings were moved, and while Tom\r\nbent over her with tender and respectful devotion, it was not to be\r\nwondered at if Miss Marjoribanks, in the emotion of her heart, should\r\nwipe away a tear.\r\n\r\n"After working at it for ten years!" said Lucilla; "and now, since poor\r\npapa died, who was always full of discrimination----This is what will\r\ncome of it, Tom," she added solemnly--"they will go back to their old\r\nridiculous parties, as if they had never seen anything better; and they\r\nwill all break up into little cliques, and make their awful morning\r\ncalls and freeze one another to death. That will be the end of it all,\r\nafter one has slaved like a--like a woman in a mill," said the\r\ndisappointed reformer, "and given up ten years."\r\n\r\n"My poor darling!" cried Tom, who would have liked to go and challenge\r\nCarlingford for being so insensible to his Lucilla\'s devotion and\r\ncherishing maternal care.\r\n\r\n"But if it had been the poor," said Miss Marjoribanks, recovering her\r\nspirits a little, "they could not help being the better for what one did\r\nfor them. They might continue to be as stupid as ever, and ungrateful,\r\nand all that; but if they were warm and comfortable, instead of cold and\r\nhungry, it would always make a difference. Tom, I will tell you what you\r\nwill do if you want to please me. You will take all our money and\r\nrealise it, you know, whatever that means, and go off directly, as fast\r\nas the train can carry you, and buy an Estate."\r\n\r\n"An estate!" cried Tom, in consternation; and the magnitude of the word\r\nwas such, and Lucilla was so entirely in earnest, that he jumped from\r\nhis chair and gazed at her as if constrained, notwithstanding his\r\namazement, to rush off instantly and obey.\r\n\r\n"I did not mean just this moment," said Lucilla; "sit down and we can\r\ntalk it all over, Tom. You know it would be something for you to do; you\r\ncannot just go living on like this at your age; you could improve the\r\nland, you know, and do all that sort of thing, and the people you could\r\nleave to me."\r\n\r\n"But Lucilla," said Tom, recovering a little from his consternation, "it\r\nis not so easy buying an estate. I mean all that I have to be settled\r\nupon you, in case of anything happening. Land may be a safe enough\r\ninvestment; but you know, very often, Lucilla--the fact is, it doesn\'t\r\npay."\r\n\r\n"_We_ could make it pay," said Miss Marjoribanks, with a benevolent\r\nsmile, "and besides there are estates and estates. I don\'t want you to\r\ngo and throw away your money. It was in the _Carlingford Gazette_ this\r\nmorning, and I can\'t help feeling it was a special providence. Of course\r\nyou never looked at it in the paper, though I marked it for you. Tom, it\r\nis Marchbank that I want you to buy. You know how papa used to talk of\r\nit. He used to say it was just a nice little property that a gentleman\r\ncould manage. If he had been spared," said Lucilla, putting her\r\nhandkerchief to her eyes, "and these wicked dreadful people had not\r\nfailed, nor nothing happened, I know he would have bought it himself.\r\nDear papa! and he would have given it to me; and most likely, so far as\r\none can tell, it would have come to you at the last, and you would have\r\nbeen Marjoribanks of Marchbank, like our great-great-grandpapa; and that\r\nis what I want you to do."\r\n\r\nLucilla\'s proposition, as it thus unfolded itself, took away Tom\r\nMarjoribanks\'s breath, for notwithstanding that it came from a (young)\r\nlady, and was confused by some slightly unintelligible conditions about\r\ndoing good to one\'s fellow-creatures, it was not a trifling or romantic\r\nsuggestion. Tom, too, could remember Marchbank, and his uncle\'s interest\r\nin it, and the careful way in which he explained to the ignorant that\r\nthis was the correct pronunciation of his own name. While Lucilla made\r\nher concluding address, Tom seemed to see himself a little fellow, with\r\nhis eyes and his ears very wide open, trotting about with small steps\r\nafter the Doctor, as he went over the red-brick house and neglected\r\ngardens at Marchbank: it was only to be let then, and had passed through\r\nmany hands, and was in miserable case, both lands and house. But neither\r\nthe lands nor the house were bad of themselves, and Tom was, like\r\nLucilla, perfectly well aware that something might be made of them.\r\n\r\nThis idea gave a new direction to his thoughts. Though he had been\r\nbrought up to the bar, he had never been a lover of town, and was in\r\nreality, like so many young Englishmen, better qualified to be something\r\nin the shape of a country gentleman than for any other profession in the\r\nworld; and he had left his profession behind, and was in most urgent\r\nwant of something to do. He did not give in at once with a lover\'s\r\nabject submission, but thought it over for twenty-four hours at all his\r\nspare moments,--when he was smoking his evening cigar in the garden,\r\nand studying the light in his lady\'s window, and when he ought to have\r\nbeen asleep, and again in the morning when he sallied forth, before Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s blinds were drawn up or the house had fairly awoke. He\r\nwas not a man of brilliant ability, but he had that sure and steady eye\r\nfor the real secret of a position which must have been revealed to every\r\ncompetent critic by the wonderful clear-sightedness with which he saw,\r\nand the wise persistence with which he held to the necessity of an\r\nimmediate choice between himself and Mr Ashburton. He had seen that\r\nthere was but one alternative, and he had suffered no delay nor\r\ndivergence from the question in hand. And it was this same quality which\r\nhad helped him to the very pretty addition to his small patrimony which\r\nhe had meant to settle on Lucilla, and which would now make the\r\nacquisition of Marchbank an easy thing enough. And though Tom had looked\r\nwise on the subject of investment in land, it was a kind of investment\r\nin every way agreeable to him. Thus Lucilla\'s arrow went straight to the\r\nmark--straighter even than she had expected; for besides all the other\r\nand more substantial considerations, there was to Tom\'s mind a sweet\r\nsense of poetic justice in the thought that, after his poor uncle\'s\r\nfailure, who had never thought him good enough for Lucilla, it should be\r\nhe and no other who would give this coveted possession to his cousin.\r\nHad Marchbank been in the market in Dr Marjoribanks\'s time, it was, as\r\nLucilla herself said, his money that would have bought it; but in such a\r\ncase, so far as the Doctor was concerned, there would have been little\r\nchance for Tom. Now all that was changed, and it was in Tom\'s hands that\r\nthe wealth of the family lay. It was he who was the head, and could\r\nalone carry out what Lucilla\'s more original genius suggested. If the\r\nDoctor could but have seen it, he who had formed plans so very\r\ndifferent--but perhaps by that time Dr Marjoribanks had found out that\r\nProvidence after all had not been so ill-advised as he once thought in\r\ncommitting to his care such a creative intelligence as that of Lucilla,\r\nand withholding from him "the boy."\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Marjoribanks, after she had made up her mind and stated her\r\nconviction, she gave herself no further trouble on the subject, but took\r\nit for granted, with that true wisdom which is unfortunately so rare\r\namong women. She did not talk about it overmuch, or display any feverish\r\nanxiety about Marchbank, but left her suggestion to work, and had faith\r\nin Tom. At the same time, the tranquillising sense of now knowing, to a\r\ncertain extent, what lay before her came into Lucilla\'s mind. It would\r\nbe a new sphere, but a sphere in which she would find herself at home.\r\nStill near enough to Carlingford to keep a watchful eye upon society and\r\ngive it the benefit of her experience, and yet at the same time\r\ntranslated into a new world, where her influence might be of untold\r\nadvantage, as Lucilla modestly said, to her fellow-creatures. There was\r\na village not far from the gates at Marchbank, where every kind of\r\nvillage nuisance was to be found. There are people who are very tragical\r\nabout village nuisances, and there are other people who assail them with\r\nloathing, as a duty forced upon their consciences; but Lucilla was\r\nneither of the one way of thinking nor of the other. It gave her the\r\nliveliest satisfaction to think of all the disorder and disarray of the\r\nMarchbank village. Her fingers itched to be at it--to set all the\r\ncrooked things straight, and clean away the rubbish, and set everything,\r\nas she said, on a sound foundation. If it had been a model village, with\r\nprize flower-gardens and clean as Arcadia, the thought of it would not\r\nhave given Miss Marjoribanks half so much pleasure. The recollection of\r\nall the wretched hovels and miserable cottages exhilarated her heart.\r\n\r\n"They may be as stupid and ungrateful as they like," she said to\r\nherself, "but to be warm and comfortable instead of cold and hungry\r\nalways makes a difference." Perhaps it was not the highest motive\r\npossible, and it might be more satisfactory to some people to think of\r\nLucilla as actuated by lofty sentiments of philanthropy; but to persons\r\nacquainted with Miss Marjoribanks\'s character, her biographer would\r\nscorn to make any pretence. What would be the good of a spirit full of\r\nboundless activity and benevolent impulses if there was nobody to\r\nhelp?--what would be the use of self-devotion if the race in general\r\nstood in no need of charitable ministrations? Lucilla had been of use to\r\nher fellow-creatures all her life; and though she was about to\r\nrelinquish one branch of usefulness, that was not to say that she should\r\nbe prevented from entering into another. The state of the Marchbank\r\nvillage did her good to the very bottom of her soul. It justified her to\r\nherself for her choice of Tom, which, but for this chance of doing good,\r\nmight perhaps have had the air of a merely selfish personal preference.\r\nNow she could regard it in a loftier light, and the thought was sweet\r\nto Lucilla; for such a beautiful way of helping her neighbour would no\r\ndoubt have been to a certain extent impracticable amid the many\r\noccupations of the Member\'s wife.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most difficult thing in Miss Marjoribanks\'s way at this\r\notherwise satisfactory moment was the difficulty she found in persuading\r\nsociety, first of the reality, and then of the justice, of the step she\r\nhad taken. Most of them, to tell the truth, had forgotten all about Tom\r\nMarjoribanks. It is true that when Lucilla\'s intentions and prospects\r\nwere discussed in Grange Lane, as they had been so often, it was not\r\nuncommon for people to say, "There was once a cousin, you know"; but\r\nnobody had ever given very much heed to the suggestion. When Lucilla\r\nwent to tell Mrs Chiley of what had happened, she was but inadequately\r\nprepared for the surprise with which her intelligence was received. For\r\nit all seemed natural enough to Miss Marjoribanks. She had gone on very\r\nsteadily for a long time, without thinking particularly about anybody,\r\nand disposed to accept the most eligible and satisfactory person who\r\nhappened to present himself; but all the time there had been a warm\r\ncorner in her heart for Tom. And then the eligible person had not come,\r\nand she had been worried and wearied, and had had her losses, like most\r\nother people. And it had always been pleasant to remember that there was\r\none man in the world who, if she but held out a finger to him----But\r\nthen the people in Grange Lane were not capable of discrimination on\r\nsuch a delicate subject, and had never, as was to be expected, had the\r\nsmallest insight into Lucilla\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"You have something to tell me, Lucilla?" said old Mrs Chiley. "You need\r\nnot say no, for I can see it in your eyes. And how lucky it is the\r\nColonel is out, and we can have it all to ourselves! Come here and sit\r\nby me, and tell me all--every word."\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley," said Lucilla, "you can always see what one means\r\nbefore one says a word. And it has all happened so suddenly; but the\r\nvery first thing I thought of doing was to come and tell you."\r\n\r\nMrs Chiley gave her young friend, who was leaning over her, a hug, which\r\nwas the only answer which could be made to so touching a speech, and\r\ndrew Lucilla down upon a low chair that had been placed by the side of\r\nher sofa. She kept Miss Marjoribanks\'s hand in her own, and caressed it,\r\nand looked at her with satisfaction in every line of her face. After\r\nwaiting so long, and having so many disappointments, everything was\r\ngoing to turn out so entirely as it ought to do at last.\r\n\r\n"I think I know what you are going to tell me, my dear," said Mrs\r\nChiley; "and I am so pleased, Lucilla. I only wonder you did not give me\r\na hint from the very first. You remember I asked you when you came here\r\nthat snowy evening. I was a hard-hearted old woman, and I dare say you\r\nwere very vexed; but I am so glad to think that the Colonel never stood\r\nout against him, but gave his consent that very day."\r\n\r\nThis was the moment, if there ever was such a moment, when Lucilla lost\r\ncourage. Mrs Chiley was so entirely confident as to what was coming, and\r\nit was something so different that was really coming; and it was hard\r\nupon Miss Marjoribanks to feel that she was about to disappoint\r\neverybody\'s expectations. She had to clear her throat before she\r\nspoke--she who was generally so ready for every emergency; and she could\r\nnot help feeling for the moment as if she was a young girl who had run\r\naway with somebody, and deceived all her anxious friends.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley, I am afraid I am not going to say what you expected,"\r\nsaid Lucilla. "I am very comfortable and happy, and I think it\'s for the\r\nbest; and I am so anxious that you should like him; but it is not the\r\nperson you are thinking of. It is----"\r\n\r\nHere the old lady, to Lucilla\'s surprise, rose up upon her pillows and\r\nthrew her arms round her, and kissed her over again, and fell a-crying.\r\n"I always said how generous you were, Lucilla," cried Mrs Chiley. "I\r\nknew it from the first. I was always fond of him, you know; and now that\r\nhe has been beaten, poor dear, and disappointed, you\'ve gone and made it\r\nup to him! Lucilla, other people may say what they like, but it is just\r\nwhat I always expected of you!"\r\n\r\nThis unlooked-for burst of enthusiasm took Lucilla entirely by surprise.\r\nShe could not say in reply that Mr Cavendish did not want her to make it\r\nup to him; but the fact that this was the only alternative which\r\noccurred to Mrs Chiley filled Miss Marjoribanks with a sense of\r\nsomething like positive guilt. She had deceived everybody, and raised\r\nfalse expectations, and how was she to explain herself? It was with\r\nhumility and embarrassment that she spoke.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you will say when you hear who it really is," she\r\nsaid. "He has been fond of me all this time, though he has been so far\r\naway. He went to India because I sent him, and he came back as soon as\r\never he heard about--what had happened. And what could I do? I could not\r\nbe so ungrateful or so hard-hearted _again_, as to send him away?"\r\n\r\n"Lucilla, who is it?" said Mrs Chiley, growing pale--for she generally\r\nhad a little wintry bloom on her cheek like the China roses she was so\r\nfond of. "Don\'t keep me like this in suspense."\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley," said Lucilla, with the brevity of excitement, "I\r\ndon\'t see what other person in the world it could be but my cousin Tom."\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs Chiley started, so that the sofa and Lucilla\'s chair and the\r\nvery room shook. She said herself afterwards that she felt as if\r\nsomebody had discharged a pistol into her breast. She was so shocked and\r\nstartled that she threw off all her coverings and the Afghanistan\r\nblanket Mrs Beverley had sent, and put her tottering old feet to the\r\nfloor; and then she took her young friend solemnly by both her hands.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lucilla, my poor dear!" she cried, "you have gone and done it\r\nwithout thinking what you were doing. You have taken it into your head\r\nthat it was all over, and that there was nothing more to look for. And\r\nyou are only nine-and-twenty, Lucilla; and many a girl marries very\r\nwell--better than common--long after she\'s nine-and-twenty; and I know\r\nfor a fact--oh! my poor dear child, I know for a _certain_ fact!--that\r\nMr Ashburton was coming forward. He as good as said it to Lady Richmond,\r\nLucilla. He as good as said, as soon as the election was over--and now\r\nyou have gone and got impatient, and thrown yourself away!"\r\n\r\nMiss Marjoribanks was quite carried away for the moment by this flood of\r\nsorrowful eloquence. She was silenced, and had nothing to answer, and\r\naccepted it as in some respect the just penalty for the disappointment\r\nshe was causing everybody. She let Mrs Chiley say out her say, and then\r\nshe restored the old lady to her sofa, and made her comfortable, and\r\ncovered her up with all her wraps and blankets. Though she ran on in a\r\nfeeble strain all the time weeping and lamenting, Lucilla took no\r\nnotice. She wrapped her old friend up, and put her pillows just as she\r\nliked them, and sat down again on the low chair; and by that time the\r\npoor old lady had sunk into a faint sob of vexation and disappointment,\r\nand had given her remonstrances up.\r\n\r\n"Now, I will tell you all about it," said Miss Marjoribanks. "I knew you\r\nwould be surprised; and if it would be any comfort to you, dear Mrs\r\nChiley, to know that Mr Ashburton _did_----"\r\n\r\n"And you refused him, Lucilla?" Mrs Chiley asked, with horror in her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Ought I to have accepted him when there was somebody I liked better?"\r\nsaid Lucilla, with the force of conscious virtue, "and you used always\r\nto say just the contrary. One great thing that supported me was, that\r\n_you_ would be sure to understand. I did not know it at the time," said\r\nMiss Marjoribanks, with sweet confidence and simplicity, "but I see it\r\nall now. Why it never came to anything before, you know, was that I\r\nnever could in my heart have accepted anybody but Tom."\r\n\r\nMrs Chiley turned round with unaffected surprise, which was not\r\nunmingled with awe. Up to this moment she had been under the impression\r\nthat it was the blindness, and folly, and stupidity of the gentlemen\r\nwhich had kept it from ever coming to anything. It was altogether a new\r\nlight that broke upon her now, confusing, though on the whole\r\nsatisfactory; but for the moment she was struck dumb, and had no answer\r\nto make.\r\n\r\n"I never knew it myself until--quite lately," said Miss Marjoribanks,\r\nwith confidential tenderness, "and I don\'t think I could tell it to any\r\none but you. Dear Mrs Chiley, you have always taken such an interest in\r\nme! I sent him away, you know, and thought I was only fond of him\r\nbecause he was my cousin. And then there were all the others, and some\r\nof them were very nice; but always when it came to the point--And it\r\nnever came into my head that Tom was at the bottom of it all--never till\r\nthe other day."\r\n\r\nMrs Chiley was still so much confounded by this unexpected revelation\r\nthat it was some time before she could find her voice; and even now the\r\nlight penetrated slowly into her mind, and it was only by degrees that\r\nshe accepted the new fact thus presented to her faith--that it was not\r\nthe gentlemen who were to blame--that it was all Lucilla\'s or rather Tom\r\nMarjoribanks\'s fault.\r\n\r\n"And Mr Ashburton, Lucilla?" she asked faintly.\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry," said Miss Marjoribanks, "very, very sorry; but I\r\ndon\'t think I can blame myself that I gave him encouragement, you know.\r\nI may have been foolish at other times, but I am sure I was very careful\r\nwith him. It was all the election that was to blame. I spoke very\r\nfrankly to him," Lucilla added, "for I knew he was a man to do me\r\njustice; and it will always be a comfort to me to think that we had\r\nour--our explanation, you know, before I knew it was Tom."\r\n\r\n"Well, Lucilla, it is a great change," said Mrs Chiley, who could not\r\nreconcile herself to the new condition of affairs. "I don\'t mean to\r\npretend that I can make up my mind to it all at once. It seems so\r\nstrange that you should have been setting your heart on some one all\r\nthese ten years, and never saying a word; I wonder how you could do it.\r\nAnd when people were always in the hopes that you would marry at home,\r\nas it were, and settle in Carlingford. I am sure your poor dear papa\r\nwould be as much astonished as anybody. And I suppose now he will take\r\nyou away to Devonshire, where his mother lives, and we shall never see\r\nyou any more." And once more Mrs Chiley gave a little sob. "The Firs\r\nwould almost have been as good as Grange Lane," she said, "and the\r\nMember for Carlingford, Lucilla!"\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Marjoribanks, she knelt down by the side of the sofa and\r\ntook her old friend, as well as the blankets and pillows would permit,\r\ninto her arms.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs Chiley, we are going to buy Marchbank and settle," said\r\nLucilla, weeping a little for company. "You could not think I would ever\r\ngo far away from you. And as for being Member for Carlingford, there are\r\nMembers for counties too," Miss Marjoribanks said in her excitement. It\r\nwas a revelation which came out unawares, and which she never intended\r\nto utter; but it threw a gleam of light over the new world of ambition\r\nand progress which was opened to Lucilla\'s far-seeing vision; and Mrs\r\nChiley could not but yield to the spell of mingled awe and sympathy\r\nwhich thrilled through her as she listened. It was not to be supposed\r\nthat what Lucilla did was done upon mere unthinking impulse; and when\r\nshe thought of Marchbank, there arose in Mrs Chiley\'s mind "the slow\r\nbeginnings of content."\r\n\r\n"But, Lucilla," the old lady said with solemnity, as she gave her a last\r\nkiss of reconciliation and peace, "if all Grange Lane had taken their\r\noaths to it, I never could have believed, had you not told me, that,\r\nafter all, it was to be Tom!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter the Last_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the hardest personal encounter which Miss Marjoribanks was\r\nsubjected to; but when the news circulated in Grange Lane there was\r\nfirst a dead pause of incredulity and amazement, and then such a\r\ncommotion as could be compared to nothing except a sudden squall at sea.\r\nPeople who had been going peaceably on their way at one moment, thinking\r\nof nothing, were to be seen the next buffeted by the wind of Rumour and\r\ntossed about on the waves of Astonishment. To speak less metaphorically\r\n(but there are moments of emotion so overwhelming and unprecedented that\r\nthey can be dealt with only in the language of metaphor), every\r\nhousehold in Grange Lane, and at least half of the humbler houses in\r\nGrove Street, and a large proportion of the other dwellings in\r\nCarlingford, were nearly as much agitated about Lucilla\'s marriage as if\r\nit had been a daughter of their own. Now that he was recalled to their\r\nminds in such a startling way, people began to recollect with greater\r\nand greater distinctness that "there was once a cousin, you know," and\r\nto remember him in his youth, and even in his boyhood, when he had been\r\nmuch in Carlingford. And by degrees the Grange Lane people came to see\r\nthat they knew a great deal about Tom, and to remind each other of the\r\nabrupt end of his last visit, and of his going to India immediately\r\nafter, and of many a little circumstance in Lucilla\'s looks and general\r\ndemeanour which this _d\xe9nouement_ seemed to make plain.\r\n\r\nLady Richmond, though she was a little annoyed about Mr Ashburton\'s\r\ndisappointment, decided at once that it was best to ignore that\r\naltogether, and was quite glad to think that she had always said there\r\nmust be somebody. "She bore up a great deal too well against all her\r\nlittle disappointments," she said, when discussing the matter. "When a\r\ngirl does that one may be always sure there is somebody behind--and you\r\nknow I always said, when she was not just talking or busy, that there\r\nwas a preoccupation in Lucilla\'s eye." This was a speech which Mrs\r\nWoodburn, as might have been expected, made a great deal of--but,\r\nnotwithstanding, it had its effect in Grange Lane. Going back upon their\r\nrecollections, most people were able to verify the fact that Miss\r\nMarjoribanks had borne her little disappointments very well, and that\r\nthere was sometimes a preoccupation in her eye. The first was beyond\r\ndispute; and as for the second, it was a thing which did not require a\r\nvery great stretch of imagination to suppose--and the unexpected\r\nsensation of finding at last a distinct bit of romance to round off\r\nLucilla\'s history, was pleasant to most people. If she had married Mr\r\nAshburton, it would have been (so far as anything connected with Miss\r\nMarjoribanks could be) a commonplace conclusion. But now she had upset\r\neverybody\'s theories, and made an altogether original and unlooked-for\r\nending for herself, which was a thing to have been expected from\r\nLucilla, though nobody could have foreseen the special turn which her\r\noriginality would take.\r\n\r\nAnd nothing could have come in more appropriately after the election,\r\nwhen people felt the blank of ordinary existence just beginning to\r\nsettle down upon them again. It kept all Carlingford in conversation for\r\na longer time than might be supposed in these busy days; for there was\r\nnot only the fact itself, but what _they_ were to do, and where they\r\nwere to go, to be discussed. And then Tom himself began to be visible\r\nabout Grange Lane; and he had heaps of Indian things among his baggage,\r\nand recollected so affectionately the people he used to know, and\r\ndispensed his curiosities with such a liberal hand, that the heart of\r\nCarlingford was touched. He had a way of miscalculating distances, as\r\nhas been said, and exercised some kind of magnetic influence upon all\r\nthe little tables and unsteady articles of furniture, which somehow\r\nseemed to fall if he but looked at them. But, on the other hand, John\r\nBrown, who had in hand the sale of Marchbank, found him the most\r\nstraightforward and clear-headed of clients. The two had all the\r\npreliminaries arranged before any other intending purchaser had time to\r\nturn the matter over in his mind. And Tom had the old brick house full\r\nof workmen before anybody knew it was his. When the summer had fairly\r\ncommenced he went over and lived there, and saw to everything, and went\r\nso far as to fit up the drawing-room with the same well-remembered tint\r\nof pale green which had been found ten years ago to suit so well with\r\nLucilla\'s complexion. It was perhaps a little hazardous to repeat the\r\nexperiment, for green, as everybody knows, is a very trying colour; but\r\nit was a most touching and triumphant proof that to Tom, at least,\r\nLucilla was as young as ever, and had not even begun to go off. It was\r\nMr Holden who supplied everything, and he was naturally proud of the\r\ntrust thus reposed in him, and formed the very highest opinion of his\r\ncustomer; and it was probably from his enthusiasm on this subject that\r\nmight be traced the commencement of that singular revolution of\r\nsentiment in Grange Lane, which suddenly woke up all in an instant\r\nwithout knowing how, to recognise the existence of Mr Marjoribanks, and\r\nto forget the undue familiarity which had ventured upon the name of Tom.\r\n\r\nWhen Lucilla went over in the most proper and decorous way, under the\r\ncharge of Aunt Jemima, to see her future home, the sight of the village\r\nat Marchbank was sweet to her eyes. That it was not by any means sweet\r\nto any other sense did but enhance Miss Marjoribanks\'s satisfaction. "A\r\nyear after this!" she said to herself, and her bosom swelled; for to\r\nrealise clearly how much she had it in her power to do for her\r\nfellow-creatures was indeed a pleasure. It occupied her a great deal\r\nmore than the gardens did, which Tom was arranging so carefully, or even\r\nthan the kitchen, which she inspected for the information of Nancy; for\r\nat that time the drawing-room was not fitted up. Lucilla\'s eyes went\r\nover the moral wilderness with the practical glance of a statesman, and,\r\nat the same time, the sanguine enthusiasm of a philanthropist. She saw\r\nof what it was capable, and already, in imagination, the desert\r\nblossomed like a rose before her beneficent steps, and the sweet sense\r\nof well-doing rose in her breast. And then to see Tom at Marchbank was\r\nto see his qualities. He was not a man of original mind, nor one who\r\nwould be likely to take a bold initiative. Considering all the\r\ncircumstances, that was a gift which was scarcely to be wished for; but\r\nhe had a perfect genius for carrying out a suggestion, which, it need\r\nscarcely be added, was a faculty that, considering the good fortune\r\nwhich Providence had so long reserved for him, made his character as\r\nnear perfect as humanity permits. Lucilla felt, indeed, as she drove\r\naway, that approbation of Providence which a well-regulated mind, in\r\npossession of most things which it desires, might be expected to feel.\r\nOther delusive fancies _had_ one time and another swept across her\r\nhorizon; but after all there could be no doubt that only thus could she\r\nhave been fitly mated, and full development afforded to all the\r\nresources of her spirit. As the carriage passed the Firs she sighed and\r\nput down her veil with a natural sentiment; but still she felt it was\r\nfor the best. The Member for Carlingford must be a busy man, occupied\r\nabout his own affairs, and with little leisure for doing good to his\r\nfellow-creatures except in a parliamentary way. "And there are members\r\nfor counties as well," Lucilla, in the depths of her soul, said to\r\nherself. Then there rose up before her a vision of a parish saved, a\r\nvillage reformed, a county reorganised, and a triumphant election at the\r\nend, the recompense and crown of all, which should put the government of\r\nthe country itself, to a certain extent, into competent hands. This was\r\nthe celestial vision which floated before Miss Marjoribanks\'s eyes as\r\nshe drove into Carlingford, and recollected, notwithstanding occasional\r\nmoments of discouragement, the successful work she had done, and the\r\ngood she had achieved in her native town. It was but the natural\r\nculmination of her career that transferred her from the town to the\r\ncounty, and held out to her the glorious task of serving her generation\r\nin a twofold way, among the poor and among the rich. If a momentary sigh\r\nfor Grange Lane, which was about to lose her, breathed from her lips, it\r\nwas sweetened by a smile of satisfaction for the county which was about\r\nto gain her. The lighter preface of life was past, and Lucilla had the\r\ncomfort of feeling that its course had been full of benefit to her\r\nfellow-creatures; and now a larger sphere opened before her feet, and\r\nMiss Marjoribanks felt that the arrangements of Providence were on the\r\nwhole full of discrimination, and that all was for the best, and she had\r\nnot lived in vain.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, perhaps it is not necessary to go much further into\r\ndetail. Mr Ashburton never said anything about his disappointment, as\r\nmight have been expected. When he did mention that eventful day at all,\r\nhe said that he had happened accidentally to be calling on Miss\r\nMarjoribanks the day her cousin came home, and saw at once the state of\r\naffairs; and he sent her a very nice present when she was married. After\r\nall, it was not her fault. If Providence had ordained that it was to be\r\nTom, how could Lucilla fly in the face of such an ordinance? and, at the\r\nsame time, there was to both parties the consoling reflection, that\r\nwhatever might happen to them as individuals, the best man had been\r\nchosen for Carlingford, which was an abiding benefit to all concerned.\r\n\r\nUnder all the circumstances, it was to be looked for that Miss\r\nMarjoribanks\'s spirits should improve even in her mourning, and that the\r\ntenacity with which she clung to her father\'s house should yield to the\r\nchanged state of affairs. This was so much the case, that Lucilla took\r\nheart to show Mrs Rider all over it, and to point out all the\r\nconveniences to her, and even, with a sigh, to call her attention to the\r\nbell which hung over the Doctor\'s bedroom door. "It breaks my heart to\r\nhear it," Miss Marjoribanks said; "but still Dr Rider will find it a\r\ngreat convenience." It was a very nice house; and so the new Doctor\'s\r\nwife, who had not been used to anything so spacious, was very willing to\r\nsay; and instead of feeling any grudge against the man who was thus in\r\nevery respect to take her father\'s place, so sweet are the softening\r\ninfluences of time and personal well-being, that Lucilla, who was always\r\nso good-natured, made many little arrangements for their comfort, and\r\neven _left the carpets_, which was a thing nobody could have expected of\r\nher, and which Aunt Jemima did not scruple to condemn. "They are all\r\nfitted," Lucilla said, "and if they were taken up they would be spoiled;\r\nand besides, we could have no use for them at Marchbank." It was a very\r\nkind thing to do, and simplified matters very much for the Riders, who\r\nwere not rich. But Aunt Jemima, in the background, could not but pull\r\nLucilla\'s sleeve, and mutter indistinct remarks about a valuation, which\r\nnobody paid any particular attention to at the moment, as there were so\r\nmany things much more important to think of and to do.\r\n\r\nAnd the presents that came pouring in from every quarter were enough to\r\nhave made up for twenty carpets. Lucilla got testimonials, so to speak,\r\nfrom every side, and all Carlingford interested itself, as has been\r\nsaid, in all the details of the marriage, as if it had been a daughter\r\nof its own. "And yet it is odd to think that, after all, I shall never\r\nbe anything but Lucilla Marjoribanks!" she said, in the midst of all her\r\ntriumphs, with a certain pensiveness. If there could be any name that\r\nwould have suited her better, or is surrounded by more touching\r\nassociations, we leave it to her other friends to find out; for at the\r\nmoment of taking leave of her, there is something consoling to our own\r\nmind in the thought that Lucilla can now suffer no change of name. As\r\nshe was in the first freshness of her youthful daring, when she rose\r\nlike the sun upon the chaos of society in Carlingford, so is she now as\r\nshe goes forth into the County to carry light and progress there. And\r\nin this reflection there is surely comfort for the few remaining\r\nmalcontents, whom not even his own excellent qualities, and Lucilla\'s\r\nhappiness, can reconcile to the fact that after all it was Tom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Miss Marjoribanks, by Mrs (Margaret) Oliphant\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MISS MARJORIBANKS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 41286-8.txt or 41286-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/1/2/8/41286/\r\n\r\nProduced by Delphine Lettau, Mary Meehan and the Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
