There were yards and yards of sandy passages,\r\nleading to storerooms and nut-cellars and seed-cellars, all amongst the\r\nroots of the hedge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the pantry]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In bed]\r\n\r\nThere was a kitchen, a parlour, a pantry, and a larder.\r\n\r\nAlso, there was Mrs. Tittlemouse\'s bedroom, where she slept in a little\r\nbox bed!\r\n\r\nMrs. Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse,\r\nalways sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.\r\n\r\nSometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.\r\n\r\n"Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!" said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering her\r\ndust-pan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shooing a beetle]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ladybird]\r\n\r\nAnd one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.\r\n\r\n"Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird! Fly away home to your\r\nchildren!"\r\n\r\nAnother day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Go away, you bold bad spider! Leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice\r\nclean house!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spider]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Out the window]\r\n\r\nShe bundled the spider out at a window.\r\n\r\nHe let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch\r\ncherry-stones and thistle-down seed for dinner.\r\n\r\nAll along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.\r\n\r\n"I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge? I\r\nam sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marks of little feet]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Babbitty Bumble]\r\n\r\nSuddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble--"Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!"\r\nsaid the bumble bee.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely. She wished that she had a\r\nbroom.\r\n\r\n"Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some beeswax. But\r\nwhat are you doing down here? Why do you always come in at a window, and\r\nsay Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?" Mrs. Tittlemouse began to get cross.\r\n\r\n"Zizz, Wizz, Wizzz!" replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak. She\r\nsidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been\r\nused for acorns.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom\r\nought to have been empty.\r\n\r\nBut it was full of untidy dry moss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Full of moss]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bees nest]\r\n\r\nMrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss. Three or four other bees\r\nput their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.\r\n\r\n"I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!" said\r\nMrs. Tittlemouse. "I will have them turned out--" "Buzz! Buzz!\r\nBuzzz!"--"I wonder who would help me?" "Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!"\r\n\r\n--"I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen she got back to the parlour, she heard some one coughing in a fat\r\nvoice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself!\r\n\r\nHe was sitting all over a small rocking-chair, twiddling his thumbs and\r\nsmiling, with his feet on the fender.\r\n\r\nHe lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Jackson]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sitting and dripping]\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Mr. Jackson? Deary me, you have got very wet!"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! I\'ll sit awhile and\r\ndry myself," said Mr. Jackson.\r\n\r\nHe sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails. Mrs.\r\nTittlemouse went round with a mop.\r\n\r\nHe sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some\r\ndinner?\r\n\r\nFirst she offered him cherry-stones. "Thank you, thank you, Mrs.\r\nTittlemouse! No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!" said Mr. Jackson.\r\n\r\nHe opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a\r\ntooth in his head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Feeding Mr. Jackson]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thistledown]\r\n\r\nThen she offered him thistle-down seed--"Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Pouff,\r\npouff, puff!" said Mr. Jackson. He blew the thistle-down all over the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! Now what I\r\nreally--_really_ should like--would be a little dish of honey!"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson," said Mrs. Tittlemouse.\r\n\r\n"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!" said the smiling Mr.\r\nJackson, "I can _smell_ it; that is why I came to call."\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the\r\ncupboards.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dish-cloth, to wipe his large wet\r\nfootmarks off the parlour floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wiping up footmarks]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Walking down the passage]\r\n\r\nWhen he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards,\r\nhe began to walk down the passage.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!"\r\n\r\n"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"\r\n\r\nFirst he squeezed into the pantry.\r\n\r\n"Tiddly, widdly, widdly? no honey? no honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?"\r\n\r\nThere were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate-rack. Two of\r\nthem got away; but the littlest one he caught.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Creepy-crawly people]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Butterfly tasting the sugar]\r\n\r\nThen he squeezed into the larder. Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar;\r\nbut she flew away out of the window.\r\n\r\n"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of\r\nvisitors!"\r\n\r\n"And without any invitation!" said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse.\r\n\r\nThey went along the sandy passage--"Tiddly widdly--" "Buzz! Wizz! Wizz!"\r\n\r\nHe met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"I do not like bumble bees. They are all over bristles," said Mr.\r\nJackson, wiping his mouth with his coat-sleeve.\r\n\r\n"Get out, you nasty old toad!" shrieked Babbitty Bumble.\r\n\r\n"I shall go distracted!" scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Confronting the Bee]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shut into the nut-cellar]\r\n\r\nShe shut herself up in the nut-cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the\r\nbees-nest. He seemed to have no objection to stings.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out--everybody had gone away.\r\n\r\nBut the untidiness was something dreadful--"Never did I see such a\r\nmess--smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown--and marks of big and\r\nlittle dirty feet--all over my nice clean house!"\r\n\r\nShe gathered up the moss and the remains of the beeswax.\r\n\r\nThen she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Closing up the front door]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Too tired]\r\n\r\nShe fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the\r\nstoreroom. But she was too tired to do any more. First she fell asleep\r\nin her chair, and then she went to bed.\r\n\r\n"Will it ever be tidy again?" said poor Mrs. Tittlemouse.\r\n\r\nNext morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which\r\nlasted a fortnight.\r\n\r\nShe swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture\r\nwith beeswax, and polished her little tin spoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Polishing]\r\n\r\nWhen it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five\r\nother little mice, without Mr. Jackson.\r\n\r\nHe smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The party]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Honey-dew through the window]\r\n\r\nSo they handed him out acorn-cupfuls of honey-dew through the window,\r\nand he was not at all offended.\r\n\r\nHe sat outside in the sun, and said--"Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Your very\r\ngood health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note: Punctuation normalized and captions added to\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse, by Beatrix Potter\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TALE OF MRS.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
