The Edgeworths were people of good means and position,\r\nand their rental, we are told, amounted to nearly \xc2\xa33000 a year. At one\r\ntime there was some talk of a peerage for Mr. Edgeworth, but he was\r\nconsidered too independent for a peerage.\r\n\r\nThe family tradition seems to have been unconventional and spirited\r\nalways. There are records still extant in the present Mr. Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npossession,--papers of most wonderful vitality for parchment,--where\r\nyou may read passionate remonstrances and adjurations from\r\ngreat-grandfathers to great-great-grandfathers, and where\r\ngreat-great-grandmothers rush into the discussion with vehement spelling\r\nand remonstrance, and make matters no better by their interference. I\r\nnever read more passionately eloquent letters and appeals. There\r\nare also records of a pleasanter nature; merrymakings, and festive\r\npreparations, and 12s. 6d. for a pair of silk stockings for Miss\r\nMargaret Edgeworth to dance in, carefully entered into the family\r\nbudget. All the people whose portraits are hanging up, beruffled,\r\ndignified, calm, and periwigged, on the old walls of Edgeworthstown\r\ncertainly had extraordinarily strong impressions, and gave eloquent\r\nexpression to them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people could feel quite so strongly\r\nnow about their own affairs as they did then; there are so many printed\r\nemotions, so many public events, that private details cannot seem quite\r\nas important. Edgeworths of those days were farther away from the world\r\nthan they are now, dwelling in the plains of Longford, which as yet\r\nwere not crossed by iron rails. The family seems to have made little\r\nof distances, and to have ridden and posted to and fro from Dublin to\r\nEdgeworthstown in storm and sunshine.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen Messrs. Macmillan asked me to write a preface to this new edition\r\nof Miss Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s stories I thought I should like to see the place\r\nwhere she had lived so long and where she had written so much, and so it\r\nhappened that being in Ireland early this year, my daughter and I found\r\nourselves driving up to Broadstone Station one morning in time for the\r\nearly train to Edgeworthstown. As we got out of our cab we asked the\r\ndriver what the fare should be. \xe2\x80\x98Sure the fare is half a crown,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x98and if you wish to give me more, I could keep it for myself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe train was starting and we bought our papers to beguile the road.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you have a Home Rule paper or one of them others?\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nnewsboy, with such a droll emphasis that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help laughing.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me one of each,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; then he laughed, as no English newsboy\r\nwould have done. . . . We went along in the car with a sad couple of\r\npeople out of a hospital, compatriots of our own, who had been settled\r\nten years in Ireland, and were longing to be away. The poor things\r\nwere past consolation, dull, despairing, ingrained English, sick and\r\nsuffering and yearning for Brixton, just as other aliens long for their\r\nnative hills and moors. We travelled along together all that spring\r\nmorning by the blossoming hedges, and triumphal arches of flowering May;\r\nthe hills were very far away, but the lovely lights and scents were all\r\nabout and made our journey charming. Maynooth was a fragrant vision as\r\nwe flew past, of vast gardens wall-enclosed, of stately buildings.\r\nThe whole line of railway was sweet with the May flowers, and with the\r\npungent and refreshing scent of the turf-bogs. The air was so clear and\r\nso limpid that we could see for miles, and short-sighted eyes needed no\r\nglasses to admire with. Here and there a turf cabin, now and then a lake\r\nplacidly reflecting the sky. The country seemed given over to silence,\r\nthe light sped unheeded across the delicate browns and greens of the\r\nbog-fields; or lay on the sweet wonderful green of the meadows. One\r\ndazzling field we saw full of dancing circles of little fairy pigs\r\nwith curly tails. Everything was homelike but NOT England, there was\r\nsomething of France, something of Italy in the sky; in the fanciful\r\ntints upon the land and sea, in the vastness of the picture, in the\r\nhappy sadness and calm content which is so difficult to describe or to\r\naccount for. Finally we reached our journey\xe2\x80\x99s end. It gave one a real\r\nemotion to see EDGEWORTHSTOWN written up on the board before us, and\r\nto realise that we were following in the steps of those giants who had\r\npassed before us. The master of Edgeworthstown kindly met us and drove\r\nus to his home through the outlying village, shaded with its sycamores,\r\nunderneath which pretty cows were browsing the grass. We passed\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church, the great iron crucifix standing in the\r\nchurchyard. Then the horses turned in at the gate of the park, and there\r\nrose the old home, so exactly like what one expected it, that I felt as\r\nif I had been there before in some other phase of existence.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a tradition in the family to welcome travellers! I\r\nthought of the various memoirs I had read, of the travellers arriving\r\nfrom the North and the South and the West; of Scott and Lockhart, of\r\nPictet, of the Ticknors, of the many visitants who had come up in turn;\r\nwhether it is the year 14, or the year 94, the hospitable doors open\r\nkindly to admit them. There were the French windows reaching to the\r\nground, through which Maria used to pass on her way to gather her roses;\r\nthere was the porch where Walter Scott had stood; there grew the quaint\r\nold-fashioned bushes with the great pink peonies in flower, by those\r\nrailings which still divide the park from the meadows beyond; there\r\nspread the branches of the century-old trees. Only last winter they told\r\nus the storms came and swept away a grove of Beeches that were known in\r\nall the country round, but how much of shade, of flower, still remain!\r\nThe noble Hawthorn of stately growth, the pine-trees (there should be\r\nNAMES for trees, as there are for rocks or ancient strongholds). Mr.\r\nEdgeworth showed us the oak from Jerusalem, the grove of cypress and\r\nsycamore where the beautiful depths of ground ivy are floating upon the\r\nDEBRIS, and soften the gnarled roots, while they flood the rising banks\r\nwith green.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Edgeworth brought us into the house. The ways go upstairs\r\nand downstairs, by winding passages and side gates; a pretty domed\r\nstaircase starts from the central hall, where stands that old clock-case\r\nwhich Maria wound up when she was over eighty years old. To the right\r\nand to the left along the passages were rooms opening from one into\r\nanother. I could imagine Sir Walter\xe2\x80\x99s kind eyes looking upon the scene,\r\nand Wordsworth coming down the stairs, and their friendly entertainer\r\nmaking all happy, and all welcome in turn; and their hostess, the\r\nwidowed Mrs. Edgeworth, responding and sympathising with each. We saw\r\nthe corner by the fire where Maria wrote; we saw her table with\r\nits pretty curves standing in its place in the deep casements. Miss\r\nEdgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s own room is a tiny little room above looking out on the back\r\ngarden. This little closet opens from a larger one, and then by a narrow\r\nflight of stairs leads to a suite of ground-floor chambers, following\r\none from another, lined with bookcases and looking on the gardens. What\r\na strange fellow-feeling with the past it gave one to stand staring at\r\nthe old books, with their paper backs and old-fashioned covers, at the\r\ngray boards, which were the liveries of literature in those early\r\ndays; at the first editions, with their inscriptions in the author\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandwriting, or in Maria\xe2\x80\x99s pretty caligraphy. There was the PIRATE in\r\nits original volumes, and Mackintosh\xe2\x80\x99s MEMOIRS, and Mrs. Barbauld\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nESSAYS, and Descartes\xe2\x80\x99s ESSAYS, that Arthur Hallam liked to read;\r\nHallam\xe2\x80\x99s CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY, and Rogers\xe2\x80\x99s POEMS, were there\r\nall inscribed and dedicated. Not less interesting were the piles of\r\nMagazines that had been sent from America. I never knew before how many\r\nMagazines existed even those early days; we took some down at hazard and\r\nread names, dates, and initials. . . . Storied urn and monumental bust\r\ndo not bring back the past as do the books which belong to it. Storied\r\nurns are in churches and stone niches, far removed from the lives of\r\nwhich they speak; books seem a part of our daily life, and are like the\r\nsound of a voice just outside the door. Here they were, as they had\r\nbeen read by her, stored away by her hands, and still safely preserved,\r\nbringing back the past with, as it were, a cheerful encouraging greeting\r\nto the present. Other relics there are of course, but, as I say, none\r\nwhich touch one so vividly. There is her silver ink-stand, the little\r\ntable her father left her on which she wrote (it had belonged to his\r\nmother before him). There is also a curious trophy--a table which was\r\nsent to her from Edinburgh, ornamented by promiscuous views of Italy,\r\ncuriously inappropriate to her genius; but not so the inscription, which\r\nis quoted from Sir Walter Scott\xe2\x80\x99s Preface to his Collected Edition, and\r\nwhich may as well be quoted here: \xe2\x80\x98WITHOUT BEING SO PRESUMPTUOUS AS TO\r\nHOPE TO EMULATE THE RICH HUMOUR, THE PATHETIC TENDERNESS, AND ADMIRABLE\r\nTRUTH WHICH PERVADE THE WORKS OF MY ACCOMPLISHED FRIEND,\xe2\x80\x99 Sir Walter\r\nwrote, I FELT THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE ATTEMPTED FOR MY OWN COUNTRY OF\r\nTHE SAME KIND AS THAT WHICH MISS EDGEWORTH SO FORTUNATELY ACHIEVED FOR\r\nIRELAND.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the MEMOIRS of Miss Edgeworth there is a pretty account of her sudden\r\nburst of feeling when this passage so unexpected, and so deeply felt by\r\nher, was read out by one of her sisters, at a time when Maria lay weak\r\nand recovering from illness in Edgeworthstown.\r\n\r\nOur host took us that day, among other pleasant things, for a marvellous\r\nand delightful flight on a jaunting car, to see something of the\r\ncountry. We sped through storms and sunshine, by open moors and fields,\r\nand then by villages and little churches, by farms where the pigs were\r\nstanding at the doors to be fed, by pretty trim cottages. The lights\r\ncame and went; as the mist lifted we could see the exquisite colours,\r\nthe green, the dazzling sweet lights on the meadows, playing upon the\r\nmeadow-sweet and elder bushes; at last we came to the lovely glades of\r\nCarriglass. It seemed to me that we had reached an enchanted forest amid\r\nthis green sweet tangle of ivy, of flowering summer trees, of immemorial\r\noaks and sycamores.\r\n\r\nA squirrel was darting up the branches of a beautiful spreading\r\nbeech-tree, a whole army of rabbits were flashing with silver tails into\r\nthe brushwood; swallows, blackbirds, peacock-butterflies, dragonflies\r\non the wing, a mighty sylvan life was roaming in this lovely orderly\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nThe great Irish kitchen garden, belonging to the house, with its seven\r\nmiles of wall, was also not unlike a part of a fairy tale. Its owner,\r\nMr. Lefroy, told me that Miss Edgeworth had been constantly there. She\r\nwas a great friend of Judge Lefroy. As a boy he remembered her driving\r\nup to the house and running up through the great drawing-room doors to\r\ngreet the Judge.\r\n\r\nMiss Edgeworth certainly lived in a fair surrounding, and, with Sophia\r\nWestern, must have gone along the way of life heralded by sweetest\r\nthings, by the song of birds, by the gold radiance of the buttercups, by\r\nthe varied shadows of those beautiful trees under which the cows gently\r\ntread the grass. English does not seem exactly the language in which to\r\nwrite of Ireland, with its sylvan wonders of natural beauty. Madame de\r\nSevigne\xe2\x80\x99s descriptions of her woods came to my mind. It is not a place\r\nwhich delights one by its actual sensual beauty, as Italy does; it is\r\nnot as in England, where a thousand associations link one to every\r\nscene and aspect--Ireland seems to me to contain some unique and most\r\nimpersonal charm, which is quite unwritable.\r\n\r\nAll that evening we sat talking with our hosts round the fire (for it\r\nwas cold enough for a fire), and I remembered that in Miss Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMEMOIRS it was described how the snow lay upon the ground and upon\r\nthe land, when the family came home in June to take possession of\r\nEdgeworthstown.\r\n\r\nAs I put out my candle in the spacious guest-chamber I wondered which of\r\nits past inhabitants I should wish to see standing in the middle of the\r\nroom. I must confess that the thought of the beautiful Honora filled\r\nme with alarm, and if Miss Seward had walked in in her pearls and satin\r\nrobe I should have fled for my life. As I lay there experimentalising\r\nupon my own emotions I found that after all, natural simple people do\r\nnot frighten one whether dead or alive. The thought of them is ever\r\nwelcome; it is the artificial people who are sometimes one thing,\r\nsometimes another, and who form themselves on the weaknesses and fancies\r\nof those among whom they live, who are really terrifying.\r\n\r\nThe shadow of the bird\xe2\x80\x99s wing flitted across the window of my bedroom,\r\nand the sun was shining next morning when I awoke. I could see the cows,\r\nfoot deep in the grass under the hawthorns. After breakfast we went out\r\ninto the grounds and through an arched doorway into the kitchen garden.\r\nIt might have been some corner of Italy or the South of France; the\r\nsquare tower of the granary rose high against the blue, the gray walls\r\nwere hung with messy fruit trees, pigeons were darting and flapping\r\ntheir wings, gardeners were at work, the very vegetables were growing\r\nluxuriant and romantic and edged by thick borders of violet pansy;\r\ncrossing the courtyard, we came into the village street, also orderly\r\nand white-washed. The soft limpid air made all things into pictures,\r\ninto Turners, into Titians. A Murillo-like boy, with dark eyes, was\r\nleaning against a wall, with his shadow, watching us go by; strange\r\nold women, with draperies round their heads, were coming out of their\r\nhouses. We passed the Post-Office, the village shops, with their names,\r\nthe Monaghans and Gerahtys, such as we find again in Miss Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnovels. We heard the local politics discussed over the counter with a\r\ncertain aptness and directness which struck me very much. We passed the\r\nboarding-house, which was not without its history--a long low building\r\nerected by Mr. and Miss Edgeworth for a school, where the Sandfords\r\nand Mertons of those days were to be brought up together: a sort of\r\nforeshadowing of the High Schools of the present. Mr. Edgeworth was,\r\nas we know, the very spirit of progress, though his experiment did not\r\nanswer at the time. At the end of the village street, where two roads\r\ndivide, we noticed a gap in the decent roadway--a pile of ruins in a\r\ngarden. A tumble-down cottage, and beyond the cottage, a falling shed,\r\non the thatched roof of which a hen was clucking and scraping. These\r\ncottages Mr. Edgeworth had, after long difficulty, bought up and\r\ncondemned as unfit for human habitation. The plans had been considered,\r\nthe orders given to build new cottages in their place, which were to\r\nbe let to the old tenants at the old rent, but the last remaining\r\ninhabitant absolutely refused to leave; we saw an old woman in a hood\r\nslowly crossing the road, and carrying a pail for water; no threats or\r\ninducements would move her, not even the sight of a neat little house,\r\nwhite-washed and painted, and all ready for her to step into. Her\r\npresent rent was 10d. a week, Mr. Edgeworth told me, and she had been\r\nletting the tumble-down shed to a large family for 1s. 4d. This sub-let\r\nwas forcibly put an end to, but the landlady still stops there, and\r\nthere she will stay until the roof tumbles down upon her head. The old\r\ncreature passed on through the sunshine, a decrepit, picturesque figure\r\ncarrying her pail to the stream, defying all the laws of progress and\r\npolitical economy and civilisation in her feebleness and determination.\r\n\r\nMost of the women came to their doors to see us go by. They all looked\r\nas old as the hills--some dropt curtseys, others threw up their arms in\r\nbenediction. From a cottage farther up the road issued a strange, shy\r\nold creature, looking like a bundle of hay, walking on bare legs. She\r\ncame up with a pinch of snuff, and a shake of the hand; she was of the\r\nfamily of the man who had once saved Edgeworthstown from being destroyed\r\nby the rebels. \xe2\x80\x98Sure it was not her father,\xe2\x80\x99 said old Peggy,\xe2\x80\x99 it was her\r\ngrandfather did it!\xe2\x80\x99 So she explained, but it was hard to believe that\r\nsuch an old, old creature had ever had a grandfather in the memory of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe glebe lands lie beyond the village. They reach as far as the church\r\non its high plateau, from which you can see the Wicklow Hills on a fine\r\nday, and the lovely shifting of the lights of the landscape. The remains\r\nof the great pew of the Edgeworth family, with its carved canopy of\r\nwood, is still a feature in the bare church from which so much has been\r\nswept away. The names of the fathers are written on the chancel walls,\r\nand a few medallions of daughters and sisters also. In the churchyard,\r\namong green elder bushes and tall upspringing grasses, is the square\r\nmonument erected to Mr. Edgeworth and his family; and as we stood there\r\nthe quiet place was crossed and recrossed by swallows with their beating\r\ncrescent wings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWhatever one may think of Mr. Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s literary manipulations and of\r\nhis influence upon his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s writings, one cannot but respect the\r\nsincere and cordial understanding which bound these two people together,\r\nand realise the added interest in life, in its machinery and evolutions,\r\nwhich Maria owed to her father\xe2\x80\x99s active intelligence. Her own gift, I\r\nthink, must have been one for perceiving through the minds of others,\r\nand for realising the value of what they in turn reflected; one is\r\nstruck again and again by the odd mixture of intuition, and of absolute\r\nmatter of fact which one finds in her writings.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to realise, when one reads the memoirs of human beings\r\nwho loved and hated, and laughed and scolded, and wanted things and did\r\nwithout them, very much as we do ourselves, that though they thought as\r\nwe do and felt as we do (only, as I have said, with greater vehemence),\r\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t LOOK like us at all; and Mr. Edgeworth, the father of\r\nMaria Edgeworth, the \xe2\x80\x98gay gallant,\xe2\x80\x99 the impetuous, ingenious, energetic\r\ngentleman, sat writing with powdered hair and a queue, with tights and\r\nbuckles, bolt upright in a stiff chair, while his family, also bequeued\r\nand becurled and bekerchiefed, were gathered round him in a group,\r\ncomposedly attentive to his explanations, as he points to the roll\r\nupon the table, or reads from his many MSS. and notebooks, for their\r\nedification.\r\n\r\nTo have four wives and twenty-two children, to have invented so many\r\nmachines, engines, and curricles, steeples and telegraph posts, is more\r\nthan commonly falls to the lot of one ordinary man, but such we know was\r\nMr. Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s history told by his own lips.\r\n\r\nI received by chance an old newspaper the other day, dated the 23rd July\r\n1779. It is called the LONDON PACKET, and its news, told with long s\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand pretty curly italics, thrills one even now as one looks over the\r\nfour short pages. The leading article is entitled \xe2\x80\x98Striking Instance\r\nof the PERFIDY of France.\xe2\x80\x99 It is true the grievance goes back to Louis\r\nXIV., but the leader is written with plenty of spirit and present\r\nindignation. Then comes news from America and the lists of New\r\nCouncillors elected:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Artemus Ward, Francis Dana, Oliver Prescott, Samuel Baker, while a very\r\nsuitable sermon on the occasion is preached by the Rev. Mr. Stillman\r\nof Boston.\xe2\x80\x99 How familiar the names all sound! Then the thanks of the\r\nMembers of Congress are given to \xe2\x80\x98General Lee, Colonel Moultrie, and the\r\nofficers and soldiers under their command who on the 28th of June last\r\nRepulsed with so much Valour the attack that was made that day on the\r\nState of South Carolina by the fleet and army of his Britannic Majesty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere is an irresistible spirit of old-world pigtail decorum and dash\r\nabout it all. We read of our \xe2\x80\x98grand fleet\xe2\x80\x99 waiting at Corunna for the\r\nSpanish; of 80,000 men on the coast of Brittany supposed to be ready for\r\nan invasion of England; of the Prince of Conde playing at cards, with\r\nNorthumberland House itself for stakes (Northumberland House which he is\r\nINTENDING to take). We read the list of Lottery Prizes, of the \xc2\xa31000 and\r\n\xc2\xa3500 tickets; of the pressing want of seamen for His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Navy,\r\nand how the gentlemen of Ireland are subscribers to a bounty fund. Then\r\ncomes the narrative of James Caton of Bristol, who writes to complain\r\nthat while transacting his business on the Bristol Exchange he is\r\nviolently seized by a pressgang, with oaths and imprecations. Mr. Farr,\r\nattempting to speak to him, is told by the Lieutenant that if he does\r\nnot keep off he will be shot with a pistol. Mr. Caton is violently\r\ncarried off, locked up in a horrible stinking room, prevented from\r\nseeing his friends; after a day or two he is forced on board a tender,\r\nwhere Mr. Tripp, a midshipman, behaves with humanity, but the Captain\r\nand Lieutenant outvie each other in brutality; Captain Hamilton behaving\r\nas an \xe2\x80\x98enraged partisan.\xe2\x80\x99 Poor Mr. Caton is released at last by the\r\nexertions of Mr. Edmund Burke, of Mr. Farr, and another devoted friend,\r\nwho travel post-haste to London to obtain a Habeas Corpus, so that he\r\nis able to write indignantly and safe from his own home to the LONDON\r\nPACKET to describe his providential escape. The little sheet gives one\r\na vivid impression of that daily life in 1779, when Miss Edgeworth\r\nmust have been a little girl of twelve years old, at school at Mrs.\r\nLataffiere\xe2\x80\x99s, and learning to write in her beautiful handwriting. It\r\nwas a time of great events. The world is fighting, armies marching and\r\ncounter-marching, and countries rapidly changing hands. Miss Seward is\r\ninditing her elegant descriptions for the use of her admiring circle.\r\nBut already the circle is dwindling! Mr. Day has parted from Sabrina.\r\nThe well-known episodes of Lichfield gaieties and love-makings are over.\r\nPoor Major Andre has been exiled from England and rejected by Honora.\r\nThe beautiful Honora, whose \xe2\x80\x9cblending charms of mind and person\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n are celebrated by one adoring lover after another, has married Mr.\r\nEdgeworth. She has known happiness, and the devoted affection of an\r\nadoring husband, and the admiring love of her little step-daughter, all\r\nthis had been hers; and now all this is coming to an end, and the poor\r\nlady lying on her death-bed imploring her husband to marry her sister\r\nElizabeth. Accordingly Mr. Edgeworth married Elizabeth Sneyd in 1780,\r\nwhich was also the year of poor Andre\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\nThere is a little oval picture at the National Gallery in Dublin, the\r\nphotograph of a sketch at Edgeworthstown House, which gives one a very\r\ngood impression of the family as it must have appeared in the reigns of\r\nKing George and the third Mrs. Edgeworth. The father in his powder and\r\nfrills sits at the table with intelligent, well-informed finger showing\r\nsome place upon a map. He is an agreeable-looking youngish man; Mrs.\r\nEdgeworth, his third wife, is looking over his shoulder; she has marked\r\nfeatures, beautiful eyes, she holds a child upon her knee, and one can\r\nsee the likeness in her to her step-daughter Honora, who stands just\r\nbehind her and leans against the chair. A large globe appropriately\r\nstands in the background. The grown-up ladies alternate with small\r\nchildren. Miss Edgeworth herself, sitting opposite to her father, is\r\nthe most prominent figure in the group. She wears a broad leghorn hat,\r\na frizzed coiffure, and folded kerchief; she has a sprightly, somewhat\r\nFrench appearance, with a marked nose of the RETROUSSE order. I had\r\nso often heard that she was plain that to see this fashionable and\r\nagreeable figure was a pleasant surprise.\r\n\r\nMiss Edgeworth seems to be about four-and-twenty in the sketch; she\r\nwas born in 1767; she must have been eleven in 1778, when Mr. Edgeworth\r\nfinally came over to Ireland to settle on his own estate, and among\r\nhis own people. He had been obliged some years before to leave\r\nEdgeworthstown on account of Mrs. Honora Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s health; he now\r\nreturned in patriarchal fashion with Mrs. Elizabeth Edgeworth, his third\r\nwife, with his children by his first, second, and third marriages,\r\nand with two sisters-in-law who had made their home in his family. For\r\nthirty-five years he continued to live on in the pretty old home which\r\nhe now adapted to his large family, and which, notwithstanding Miss\r\nEdgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s objections, would have seemed so well fitted for its various\r\nrequirements. The daughter\xe2\x80\x99s description of his life there, of his\r\nwork among his tenants, of his paternal and spirited rule, is vivid and\r\ninteresting. When the present owner of Edgeworthstown talked to us of\r\nhis grandfather, one felt that, with all his eccentricities, he must\r\nhave been a man of a far-seeing mind and observation. Mr. Erroles\r\nEdgeworth said that he was himself still reaping the benefit of his\r\ngrandfather\xe2\x80\x99s admirable organisation and arrangements on the estate,\r\nand that when people all around met with endless difficulties and\r\ncomplications, he had scarcely known any. Would that there had been more\r\nMr. Edgeworths in Ireland!\r\n\r\nWhatever business he had to do, his daughter tells us, was done in the\r\nmidst of his family. Maria copied his letters of business and helped\r\nhim to receive his rents. \xe2\x80\x98On most Irish estates,\xe2\x80\x99 says Miss Edgeworth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98there is, or there was, a personage commonly called a driver,--a person\r\nwho drives and impounds cattle for rent and arrears.\xe2\x80\x99 The drivers are,\r\nalas! from time to time too necessary in collecting Irish rents. Mr.\r\nEdgeworth desired that none of his tenants should pay rent to any\r\none but himself; thus taking away subordinate interference, he became\r\nindividually acquainted with his tenantry. He also made himself\r\nacquainted with the different value of land on his estate. In every\r\ncase where the tenant had improved the land his claim to preference over\r\nevery new proposer was admitted. The mere plea, \xe2\x80\x98I have been on\r\nyour Honour\xe2\x80\x99s estate so many years,\xe2\x80\x99 was disregarded. \xe2\x80\x98Nor was it\r\nadvantageous that each son,\xe2\x80\x99 says Miss Edgeworth, \xe2\x80\x98of the original\r\ntenant should live on his subdivided little potato garden without\r\nfurther exertion of mind or body.\xe2\x80\x99 Further on she continues: \xe2\x80\x98Not being\r\nin want of ready money, my father was not obliged to let his land to the\r\nhighest bidder. He could afford to have good tenants.\xe2\x80\x99 In the old leases\r\nclaims of duty-fowl, of duty-work, of man or beast had been inserted.\r\nMr. Edgeworth was one of the first to abolish them. The only clause he\r\ncontinued in every lease was the alienation fine, which was to protect\r\nthe landlord and to prevent a set of middlemen from taking land at a\r\nreasonable rent, and letting it immediately at the highest possible\r\nprice. His indulgence as to the time he allowed for the payment of\r\nrent was unusually great, but beyond the half year the tenants knew his\r\nstrictness so well, that they rarely ventured to go into arrears, and\r\nnever did so with impunity. \xe2\x80\x98To his character as a good landlord,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe continues, \xe2\x80\x98was added that he was a real gentleman; this phrase\r\ncomprises a good deal in the opinion of the lower Irish.\xe2\x80\x99 There is one\r\nvery curious paragraph in which Miss Edgeworth describes how her father\r\nknew how to make use of the tenants\xe2\x80\x99 prejudices, putting forward his\r\nwishes rather than his convictions. \xe2\x80\x98It would be impossible for me,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays his daughter, \xe2\x80\x98without ostentation to give any of the proofs I\r\nmight record of my father\xe2\x80\x99s liberality. Long after they were forgotten\r\nby himself, they were remembered by the warm-hearted people among whom\r\nhe lived.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Edgeworth was one of those people born to get their own way. Every\r\none seems to have felt the influence of his strong character. It was not\r\nonly with his family and his friends that he held his own--the tenants\r\nand the poor people rallied to his command. To be sure, it sounds like\r\nsome old Irish legend to be told that Mr. Edgeworth had so loud a voice\r\nthat it could be heard a mile off, and that his steward, who lived in a\r\nlodge at that distance from the house, could hear him calling from the\r\ndrawing-room window, and would come up for orders.\r\n\r\nIn 1778, says Miss Edgeworth retrospectively, when England was\r\ndespatching her armies all over the world, she had no troops to spare\r\nfor the defence of Ireland then threatened with a French invasion; and\r\nthe principal nobility and gentry embodied themselves volunteers for the\r\ndefence of the country. The Duke of Leinster and Lord Charlemont were\r\nat the head of the \xe2\x80\x98corps which in perfect order and good discipline\r\nrendered their country respectable.\xe2\x80\x99 The friends of Ireland, profiting\r\nby England\xe2\x80\x99s growing consideration for the sister country, now obtained\r\nfor her great benefits for which they had long been striving, and\r\nMr. Grattan moved an address to the throne asserting the legislative\r\nindependence of Ireland. The address passed the House, and, as his\r\ndaughter tells us, Mr. Edgeworth immediately published a pamphlet.\r\nMiss Edgeworth continues as follows, describing his excellent course\r\nof action: \xe2\x80\x98My father honestly and unostentatiously used his utmost\r\nendeavours to obliterate all that could tend to perpetuate ill-will in\r\nthe country. Among the lower classes in his neighbourhood he endeavoured\r\nto discourage that spirit of recrimination and retaliation which the\r\nlower Irish are too prone to cherish. They are such acute observers that\r\nthere is no deceiving them as to the state of the real feeling of their\r\nsuperiors. They know the signs of what passes within with more certainty\r\nthan any physiognomist, and it was soon seen by all those who had\r\nany connection with him that my father was sincere in his disdain of\r\nvengeance.\xe2\x80\x99 Further on, describing his political feelings, she says that\r\non the subject of the Union in parliamentary phrase he had not then been\r\nable to make up his mind. She describes with some pride his first speech\r\nin the Irish House at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, when the wearied\r\nmembers were scarcely awake to hear it, and when some of the\r\noutstretched members were aroused by their neighbours to listen to\r\nhim! \xe2\x80\x98When people perceived that it was not a set speech,\xe2\x80\x99 says Miss\r\nEdgeworth, \xe2\x80\x98they became interested.\xe2\x80\x99 He stated his doubts just as they\r\nhad occurred as he threw them by turn into each scale. After giving many\r\nreasons in favour of what appeared to be the advantages of the Union,\r\nhe unexpectedly gave his vote against it, because he said he had been\r\nconvinced by what he had heard one night, that the Union was decidedly\r\nagainst the wishes of the majority of men of sense and property in\r\nthe nation. He added (and surely Mr. Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s opinion should go for\r\nsomething still) that if he should be convinced that the opinions of the\r\ncountry changed, his vote would be in its favour.\r\n\r\nHis biographer tells us that Mr. Edgeworth was much complimented on his\r\nspeech by BOTH sides, by those for whom he voted, and also by those who\r\nfound that the best arguments on the other side of the question had\r\nbeen undoubtedly made by him. It is a somewhat complicated statement\r\nand state of feeling to follow; to the faithful daughter nothing is\r\nimpossible where her father is concerned. This vote, I believe, cost Mr.\r\nEdgeworth his peerage. \xe2\x80\x98When it was known that he had voted against the\r\nUnion he became suddenly the idol of those who would previously have\r\nstoned him,\xe2\x80\x99 says his devoted biographer. It must not, however, be\r\nforgotten that Mr. Edgeworth had refused an offer of \xc2\xa33000 for his seat\r\nfor two or three weeks, during that momentous period when every vote was\r\nof importance. Mr. Pitt, they say, spent over \xc2\xa32,000,000 in carrying the\r\nmeasure which he deemed so necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAs a rule people\xe2\x80\x99s books appeal first to one\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, and then\r\nafter a time, if the books are good books and alive, not stuffed\r\ndummies and reproductions, one begins to divine the writers themselves,\r\nhidden away in their pages, and wrapped up in their hot-press sheets of\r\npaper; and so it happened by chance that a printed letter once written\r\nby Maria Edgeworth to Mrs. Barbauld set the present reader wondering\r\nabout these two familiar names, and trying to realise the human beings\r\nwhich they each represented. Since those days Miss Edgeworth has become\r\na personage more vivid and interesting than any of her characters, more\r\nfamiliar even than \xe2\x80\x98Simple Susan\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Rosamond of the Purple Jar.\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nhas seemed little by little to grow into a friend, as the writer has\r\nlearnt to know her more and more intimately, has visited the home of\r\nthat home-loving woman, has held in her hands the delightful Family\r\nMemoirs,{1}  has seen the horizons, so to speak, of Maria Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlong life. Several histories of Miss Edgeworth have been lately\r\npublished in England. Miss Zimmern and Miss Oliver in America have each\r\nwritten, and the present writer has written, and various memoirs and\r\nletters have appeared in different magazines and papers with allusions\r\nand descriptions all more or less interesting. One can but admire the\r\nspirit which animated that whole existence; the cheerful, kindly,\r\nmultiplied interest Maria Edgeworth took in the world outside, as well\r\nas in the wellbeing of all those around her. Generations, changes, new\r\nfamilies, new experiences, none of these overwhelmed her. She seemed to\r\nmove in a crowd, a cheerful, orderly crowd, keeping in tune and heart\r\nwith its thousand claims; with strength and calmness of mind to bear\r\nmultiplied sorrows and a variety of care with courage, and an\r\never-reviving gift of spirited interest. Her history is almost unique\r\nin its curious relationships; its changes of step-mothers, its warm\r\nfamily ties, its grasp of certain facts which belong to all time rather\r\nthan to the hour itself. Miss Edgeworth lived for over eighty years,\r\nbusy, beneficent, modest, and intelligent to the last. When she died\r\nshe was mourned as unmarried women of eighty are not often mourned.\r\n\r\n    {1} Now published and edited by Mr. Hare (Nov. 1894).\r\n\r\nThe present owner of Edgeworthstown told us that he could just remember\r\nher, lying dead upon her bed, and her face upon the pillow, and the\r\nsorrowful tears of the household; and how he and the other little\r\nchildren were carried off by a weeping aunt into the woods, to comfort\r\nand distract them on the funeral day. He also told us of an incident\r\nprior to this event which should not be overlooked. How he himself,\r\nbeing caught red-handed, at the age of four or thereabouts, with his\r\nhands in a box of sugar-plums, had immediately confessed the awful fact\r\nthat he had been about to eat them, and he was brought then and there\r\nbefore his Aunt Maria for sentence. She at once decided that he had\r\nbehaved Nobly in speaking the truth, and that he must be rewarded\r\nin kind for his praiseworthy conduct, and be allowed to keep the\r\nsugar-plums!\r\n\r\nThis little story after half a century certainly gives one pleasure\r\nstill to recall, and proves, I think, that cakes may be enjoyed long\r\nafter they have been eaten, and also that there is a great deal to be\r\nsaid for justice with lollipops in the scale. But what would Rosamond\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparents have thought of such a decision? One shudders to think of their\r\ndisapproval, or of that of dear impossible Mr. Thomas Day, with his\r\ntrials and experiments of melted sealing-wax upon little girls\xe2\x80\x99 bare\r\narms, and his glasses of tar-water so inflexibly administered. Miss\r\nEdgeworth, who suffered from her eyes, recalls how Mr. Day used to bring\r\nthe dose, the horrible tar-water, every morning with a \xe2\x80\x98Drink this,\r\nMiss Maria!\xe2\x80\x99 and how she dared not resist, though she thought she saw\r\nsomething of kindness and pity beneath all his apparent severity.\r\n\r\nSeverity was the order of those times. The reign of sugar-plums had\r\nscarcely begun. It was not, as now, only ignorance and fanaticism that\r\nencouraged the giving of pain, it was the universal custom. People\r\nwere still hanged for stealing, women were still burnt--so we have\r\nbeen assured--in St. Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s Green; though, it is true, they were\r\nconsiderately strangled first. Children were bullied and tortured with\r\nthe kindest intentions; even Maria Edgeworth at her fashionable school\r\nwas stretched in a sort of machine to make her grow; Mr. Day, as we\r\nknow, to please the lady of his affections, passed eight hours a day\r\nin the stocks in order to turn out his knock-knees. One feels that a\r\ngeneration of ladies and gentlemen who submitted to such inflictions\r\nsurely belonged to a race of heroes and heroines, and that, if the times\r\nwere difficult and trying, the people also were stronger to endure them,\r\nand must have been much better fitted with nerves than we are.\r\n\r\nMiss Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s life has been so often told that I will not attempt to\r\nrecapitulate the story at any length. She well deserved her reputation.\r\nHer thoughts were good, her English was good, her stories had the charm\r\nof sincerity, and her audience of children was a genuine audience, less\r\nlikely to be carried away by fashion than more advanced critics might\r\nbe. There is a curious matter-of-fact element in all she wrote, combined\r\nwith extraordinary quickness and cleverness; and it must be remembered,\r\nin trying to measure her place in literature, that in her day the whole\r\ngreat school of English philosophical romance was in its cradle; George\r\nEliot was not in existence; my father was born in the year in which THE\r\nABSENTEE was published. Sir Walter Scott has told us that it was Miss\r\nEdgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s writing which first suggested to him the idea of writing\r\nabout Scotland and its national life. Tourgenieff in the same way says\r\nthat it was after reading her books on Ireland that he began to write\r\nof his own country and of Russian peasants as he did. Miss Edgeworth was\r\nthe creator of her own special world of fiction, though the active Mr.\r\nEdgeworth crossed the t\xe2\x80\x99s and dotted the i\xe2\x80\x99s, interpolated, expurgated,\r\nto his own and Maria\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction. She was essentially a modest woman;\r\nshe gratefully accepted his criticism and emendations. Mr. Clark Russell\r\nquotes Sydney Smith, who declared that Mr. Edgeworth must have written\r\nor burst. \xe2\x80\x98A discharge of ink was an evacuation absolutely necessary\r\nto avoid fatal and plethoric congestion.\xe2\x80\x99 The only wonder is that,\r\nconsidering all they went through, his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s stories survived to\r\ntell their tale, and to tell it so well, with directness and conviction,\r\nthat best of salt in any literary work. A letter Maria wrote to her\r\ncousin will be remembered. \xe2\x80\x98I beg, dear Sophy,\xe2\x80\x99 she says, \xe2\x80\x98that you will\r\nnot call my stories by the sublime name of my works; I shall else be\r\nashamed when the little mouse comes forth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMaria\xe2\x80\x99s correspondence is delightful, and conveys us right away into\r\nthat bygone age. The figures rapidly move across her scene, talking and\r\nunconsciously describing themselves as they go; you see them all through\r\nthe eyes of the observant little lady. She did not go very deep; she\r\nseems to me to have made kindly acquaintance with some, to have admired\r\nothers with artless enthusiasm. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she troubled herself much\r\nabout complication of feeling; she liked people to make repartees, or\r\nto invent machines, to pay their bills, and to do their duty in a\r\ncommonplace and cheerfully stoical fashion. But then Maria Edgeworth\r\ncertainly did not belong to our modern schools, sipping the emetic\r\ngoblet to give flavour to daily events, nor to that still more alarming\r\nand spreading clique of DEGENERES who insist upon administering such\r\ndoses to others to relieve the tedium of the road of life.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we in our time scarcely do justice to Miss Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nextraordinary cleverness and brightness of apprehension. There is more\r\nfun than humour in her work, and those were the days of good rollicking\r\njokes and laughter. Details change so quickly that it is almost\r\nimpossible to grasp entirely the aims and intentions of a whole set of\r\npeople just a little different from ourselves in every single thing; who\r\nheld their heads differently, who pointed their toes differently, who\r\naddressed each other in a language just a little unlike our own. The\r\nvery meanings of the words shift from one generation to another, and\r\nwe are perhaps more really in harmony with our great-great-grandfathers\r\nthan with the more immediate generations.\r\n\r\nHer society was charming, so every one agrees; and her acquaintance with\r\nall the most remarkable men of her time must not be forgotten, nor the\r\ngenuine regard with which she inspired all who came across her path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In external appearance she is quite the fairy of our nursery tale, the\r\nWHIPPETY STOURIE, if you remember such a sprite, who came flying through\r\nthe window to work all sorts of marvels,\xe2\x80\x99 writes Sir Walter. \xe2\x80\x98I will\r\nnever believe but what she has a wand in her pocket, and pulls it out\r\nto conjure a little before she begins those very striking pictures of\r\nmanners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmong others Sir William Hamilton has left a pleasing description of\r\nMiss Edgeworth. \xe2\x80\x98If you would study and admire her as she deserves,\r\nyou must see her at home,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98and hear her talk. She knows an\r\ninfinite number of anecdotes about interesting places and persons, which\r\nshe tells extremely well, and never except when they arise naturally\r\nout of the subject. . . . To crown her merits, she seemed to take a\r\nprodigious fancy to me, and promised to be at home, and made me promise\r\nto be at Edgeworthstown for a fortnight some time next vacation.\xe2\x80\x99 We owe\r\nto him also an amusing sketch of some other collateral members of the\r\nfamily; the fine animated old lady, who immediately gets him to explain\r\nthe reason why a concave mirror inverts while a convex mirror leaves\r\nthem erect; the young ladies, one of whom was particularly anxious to\r\npersuade him that the roundness of the planets was produced by friction,\r\nperhaps by their being shaken together like marbles in a bag.\r\n\r\nThere is also an interesting letter from Sir W. Hamilton at\r\nEdgeworthstown on 23rd September 1829. Wordsworth is also staying there.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After some persuasion Francis and I succeed in engaging Mr. Wordsworth\r\nin many very interesting conversations. Miss Edgeworth has had for some\r\ntime a very serious illness, but she was able to join us for dinner\r\nthe day that I arrived, and she exhibited in her conversations with Mr.\r\nWordsworth a good deal of her usual brilliancy; she also engaged\r\nMr. Marshall in some long conversations upon Ireland, and even Mr.\r\nMarshall\xe2\x80\x99s son, whose talent for silence seems to be so very profound,\r\nwas thawed a little on Monday evening, and discussed after tea the\r\nformation of the solar system. Miss Edgeworth tells me that she is at\r\nlast employed in writing for the public after a long interval, but does\r\nnot expect to have her work soon ready for publication.\xe2\x80\x99{2}\r\n\r\n   {2} There is a curious criticism of Miss Edgeworth by Robert Hall,\r\n   the great preacher, which should not be passed over. \xe2\x80\x98As to her\r\n   style,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98she is simple and elegant, content to convey her\r\n   thoughts in their most plain and natural form, that is indeed the\r\n   perfection of style. . . . In point of tendency,\xe2\x80\x99 he continues, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\n   should class her books among the most irreligious I ever read. . . .\r\n   She does not attack religion nor inveigh against it, but makes it\r\n   appear unnecessary by exhibiting perfect virtue without it. . . . No\r\n   works ever produced so bad an effect on my own mind as hers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBesides Wordsworth and Sir William Hamilton and Mr. Marshall, we\r\npresently come to Sir John Herschell. \xe2\x80\x98I saw your admirable friend Miss\r\nEdgeworth lately in town,\xe2\x80\x99 he writes to Hamilton; \xe2\x80\x98she is a most warm\r\nadmirer of yours, and praise such as hers is what any man might be proud\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x99 Later on Miss Edgeworth, corresponding with Sir W. Hamilton, tells\r\nhim she is ill and forbidden to write, or even to think. This is what\r\nshe thinks of THINKING: \xe2\x80\x98I am glad to see that the severe sciences do\r\nnot destroy the energy and grace of the imagination, but only chasten it\r\nand impart their philosophical influence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nCertain events are remembered and mourned for generations, so there are\r\nothers, happy and interesting in themselves, which must continue to give\r\nsatisfaction long after they are over, and long after those concerned in\r\nthem have passed away. And certainly among things pleasant to remember\r\nis the story of Sir Walter Scott\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Ireland in July 1825, when\r\nhe received so warm a greeting from the country and spent those happy\r\nhours with Miss Edgeworth at Edgeworthstown. Fortunately for us,\r\nLockhart was one of the party. Anne Scott, and Walter the soldier, and\r\nJane Scott the bride, were also travelling in Sir Walter\xe2\x80\x99s train. The\r\nreception which Ireland gave Sir Walter was a warm-hearted ovation. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nwould be endless to enumerate the distinguished persons who, morning\r\nafter morning, crowded to his levee in St. Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s Green,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nLockhart, and he quotes an old saying of Sir Robert Peel\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x98that Sir\r\nWalter\xe2\x80\x99s reception in the High Street of Edinburgh in 1822 was the first\r\nthing that gave him (Peel) a notion of the electric shock of a nation\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngratitude.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I doubt if even that scene surpassed what I myself\r\nwitnessed,\xe2\x80\x99 continues the biographer, \xe2\x80\x98when Sir Walter returned down\r\nDame Street after inspecting the Castle of Dublin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFrom ovations to friendship it was Sir Walter\xe2\x80\x99s inclination to turn. On\r\nthe 1st August he came to Edgeworthstown, accompanied by his family. \xe2\x80\x98We\r\nremained there for several days, making excursions to Loch Oel, etc. Mr.\r\nLovell Edgeworth had his classical mansion filled every evening with\r\na succession of distinguished friends. Here, above all, we had\r\nthe opportunity of seeing in what universal respect and comfort a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s family may live in that country, provided only they live\r\nthere habitually and do their duty. . . . Here we found neither mud\r\nhovels nor naked peasantry, but snug cottages and smiling faces all\r\nabout. . . . Here too we pleased ourselves with recognising some of the\r\nsweetest features in Goldsmith\xe2\x80\x99s picture of \xe2\x80\x9cSweet Auburn! loveliest\r\nvillage of the plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 Oliver Goldsmith received his education at this\r\nvery school of Edgeworthstown, and Pallas More, the little hamlet where\r\nthe author of THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD first saw the light, is still, as\r\nit was then, the property of the Edgeworths.\r\n\r\nSo Scott came to visit his little friend, and the giant was cheered\r\nand made welcome by her charming hospitality. It was a last gleam of\r\nsunshine in that noble life. We instinctively feel how happy they all\r\nwere in each other\xe2\x80\x99s good company. We can almost overhear some of their\r\ntalk, as they walk together under the shade of the trees of the park.\r\nOne can imagine him laughing in his delightful hearty way, half joking,\r\nhalf caressing. Lockhart had used some phrase (it is Lockhart who tells\r\nus the story) which conveyed the impression that he suspects poets and\r\nnovelists of looking at life and at the world chiefly as materials for\r\nart. \xe2\x80\x98A soft and pensive shade came over Scott\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cI fear you have\r\nsome very young ideas in your head,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cGod help us, what a poor\r\nworld this would be if that were the true doctrine! I have read books\r\nenough, and observed and conversed with enough eminent minds in my time,\r\nbut I assure you I have heard higher sentiments from the lips of poor\r\nuneducated men and women, exerting the spirit of severe yet gentle\r\nheroism, or speaking their simple thoughts, than I ever met with out\r\nof the pages of the Bible. We shall never learn to feel and respect our\r\nreal calling unless we have taught ourselves to consider everything as\r\nmoonshine compared with the education of the heart,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 said the great\r\nteacher. \xe2\x80\x98Maria did not listen to this without some water in\r\nher eyes,--her tears are always ready when a generous string is\r\ntouched,--but she brushed them gaily aside, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see how it\r\nis: Dean Swift said he had written his books in order that people should\r\nlearn to treat him like a great lord; Sir Walter writes his in order\r\nthat he might be able to treat his people as a great lord ought to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYears and years afterwards Edward Fitzgerald stayed at Edgeworthstown,\r\nand he also carries us there in one of his letters. He had been at\r\ncollege with Mr. Frank Edgeworth, who had succeeded to the estate, and\r\nhad now in 1828 come to stay with him. The host had been called away,\r\nbut the guest describes his many hostesses: \xe2\x80\x98Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s mother, aged\r\nseventy-four; his sister, the great Maria, aged seventy-two; and another\r\ncousin or something. All these people were pleasant and kind, the house\r\npleasant, the grounds ditto, a good library, so here I am quite at home,\r\nbut surely must go to England soon.\xe2\x80\x99 One can imagine Fitzgerald sitting\r\nin the library with his back to the window and writing his letters\r\nand reading his thirty-two sets of novels, while the rain is steadily\r\npouring outside, and the Great Authoress (so he writes her down) as busy\r\nas a bee sitting by chattering and making a catalogue of her books. \xe2\x80\x98We\r\ntalk about Walter Scott, whom she adores, and are merry all day long,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe says. \xe2\x80\x98When I began this letter I thought I had something to say, but\r\nI believe the truth was I had nothing to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwo years later Mr. Fitzgerald is again there and writing to Frederick\r\nTennyson: \xe2\x80\x98I set sail from Dublin to-morrow night, bearing the heartfelt\r\nregrets of all the people of Ireland with me.\xe2\x80\x99 Then comes a flash of his\r\nkind searching lantern: \xe2\x80\x98I had a pleasant week with Edgeworth. He farms\r\nand is a justice, and goes to sleep on the sofa of evenings. At odd\r\nmoments he looks into Spinoza and Petrarch. People respect him very much\r\nin these parts.\xe2\x80\x99 Edward Fitzgerald seems to have had a great regard for\r\nhis host; the more he knows him the more he cares for him; he describes\r\nhim \xe2\x80\x98firing away about the odes of Pindar.\xe2\x80\x99 They fired noble broadsides\r\nthose men of the early Victorian times, and when we listen we still seem\r\nto hear their echoes rolling into the far distance. Mr. Fitzgerald\r\nends his letter with a foreboding too soon to be realised: \xe2\x80\x98Old Miss\r\nEdgeworth is wearing away. She has a capital bright soul, which even now\r\nshines quite youthfully through her faded carcase.\xe2\x80\x99 It was in May 1849\r\nthat Maria Edgeworth went to her rest. She died almost suddenly, with no\r\nlong suffering, in the arms of her faithful friend and step-mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON \xe2\x80\x98CASTLE RACKRENT\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn 1799, When Maria was in London, she and her father went to call upon\r\nMr. Johnson, the bookseller, who was then imprisoned in the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBench for a publication which was considered to be treasonable, and they\r\nprobably then and there arranged with him for the publication of CASTLE\r\nRACKRENT, for in January 1800, writing to her cousin, Miss Ruxton, Maria\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x98Will you tell me what means you have of getting parcels from\r\nLondon to Arundel, because I wish to send my aunt a few popular tales.\r\n. . . We have begged Johnson to send CASTLE RACKRENT, and hope it has\r\nreached you. DO NOT MENTION THAT IT IS OURS.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe second edition of CASTLE RACKRENT came out with Miss Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname to it in 1811. \xe2\x80\x98Its success was so triumphant,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Edgeworth\r\nwrites, \xe2\x80\x98that some one--I heard his name at the time, but do not now\r\nremember it--not only asserted that he was the author, but actually took\r\nthe trouble to copy out several chapters with corrections and erasions\r\nas if it was his original manuscript.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was when Miss Edgeworth first came to Ireland,--so she tells one of\r\nher correspondents,--that she met the original Thady of CASTLE RACKRENT.\r\nHis character struck her very much, and the story came into her mind.\r\nShe purposely added to the agent\xe2\x80\x99s age so as to give time for the events\r\nto happen.\r\n\r\nHonest Thady tells the story; you can almost hear his voice, and see him\r\nas he stands: \xe2\x80\x98I wear a long greatcoat winter and summer, which is very\r\nhandy, as I never put my arms into the sleeves; they are as good as new,\r\nthough come Holantide next I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it these seven years: it holds on by\r\na single button round my neck, cloak fashion. To look at me, you would\r\nhardly think \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Thady\xe2\x80\x9d was the father of Attorney Quirk; he is a high\r\ngentleman, and never minds what poor Thady says, and having better than\r\nfifteen hundred a year landed estate, looks down upon honest Thady; but\r\nI wash my hands of his doings, and as I have lived, so will I die, true\r\nand loyal to the family. The family of Rackrents is, I am proud to say,\r\none of the most ancient in the kingdom.\xe2\x80\x99 And then he gives the history\r\nof the Rackrents, beginning with Sir Patrick, who could sit out the best\r\nman in Ireland, let alone the three kingdoms itself, and who fitted\r\nup the chicken-house to accommodate his friends when they honoured him\r\nunexpectedly with their company. There was \xe2\x80\x98such a fine whillaluh at Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, you might have heard it to the farthest end of the\r\ncounty, and happy the man who could get but a sight of the hearse.\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\ncame Sir Murtagh, who used to boast that he had a law-suit for every\r\nletter in the alphabet. \xe2\x80\x98He dug up a fairy-mount against my advice,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays Thady, \xe2\x80\x98and had no luck afterwards. . . . Sir Murtagh in his\r\npassion broke a blood-vessel, and all the law in the land could do\r\nnothing in that case. . . . My lady had a fine jointure settled upon\r\nher, and took herself away, to the great joy of the tenantry. I never\r\nsaid anything one way or the other,\xe2\x80\x99 says Thady, \xe2\x80\x98whilst she was part\r\nof the family, but got up to see her go at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fine morning, honest Thady,\xe2\x80\x9d says she; \xe2\x80\x9cgood-bye to ye,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ninto the carriage she stepped, without a word more, good or bad, or even\r\nhalf-a-crown, but I made my bow, and stood to see her safe out of sight\r\nfor the sake of the family.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHow marvellously vivid it all is! every word tells as the generations\r\npass before us. The very spirit of romantic Irish fidelity is incarnate\r\nin Thady. Jason Quirk represents the feline element, which also belongs\r\nto our extraordinary Celtic race. The little volume contains the\r\nhistory of a nation. It is a masterpiece which Miss Edgeworth has never\r\nsurpassed. It is almost provoking to have so many details of other\r\nand less interesting stories, such as EARLY LESSONS, A KNAPSACK, THE\r\nPRUSSIAN VASE, etc., and to hear so little of these two books by which\r\nshe will be best remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR\xe2\x80\x99S PREFACE\r\n\r\nThe Prevailing taste of the public for anecdote has been censured and\r\nridiculed by critics who aspire to the character of superior wisdom;\r\nbut if we consider it in a proper point of view, this taste is an\r\nincontestable proof of the good sense and profoundly philosophic temper\r\nof the present times. Of the numbers who study, or at least who read\r\nhistory, how few derive any advantage from their labours! The heroes of\r\nhistory are so decked out by the fine fancy of the professed historian;\r\nthey talk in such measured prose, and act from such sublime or such\r\ndiabolical motives, that few have sufficient taste, wickedness, or\r\nheroism, to sympathise in their fate. Besides, there is much uncertainty\r\neven in the best authenticated ancient or modern histories; and that\r\nlove of truth, which in some minds is innate and immutable, necessarily\r\nleads to a love of secret memoirs and private anecdotes. We cannot\r\njudge either of the feelings or of the characters of men with perfect\r\naccuracy, from their actions or their appearance in public; it is from\r\ntheir careless conversations, their half-finished sentences, that we\r\nmay hope with the greatest probability of success to discover their real\r\ncharacters. The life of a great or of a little man written by himself,\r\nthe familiar letters, the diary of any individual published by his\r\nfriends or by his enemies, after his decease, are esteemed important\r\nliterary curiosities. We are surely justified, in this eager desire, to\r\ncollect the most minute facts relative to the domestic lives, not only\r\nof the great and good, but even of the worthless and insignificant,\r\nsince it is only by a comparison of their actual happiness or misery\r\nin the privacy of domestic life that we can form a just estimate of the\r\nreal reward of virtue, or the real punishment of vice. That the great\r\nare not as happy as they seem, that the external circumstances of\r\nfortune and rank do not constitute felicity, is asserted by every\r\nmoralist: the historian can seldom, consistently with his dignity, pause\r\nto illustrate this truth; it is therefore to the biographer we must have\r\nrecourse. After we have beheld splendid characters playing their parts\r\non the great theatre of the world, with all the advantages of stage\r\neffect and decoration, we anxiously beg to be admitted behind the\r\nscenes, that we may take a nearer view of the actors and actresses.\r\n\r\nSome may perhaps imagine that the value of biography depends upon the\r\njudgment and taste of the biographer; but on the contrary it may be\r\nmaintained, that the merits of a biographer are inversely as the\r\nextent of his intellectual powers and of his literary talents. A plain\r\nunvarnished tale is preferable to the most highly ornamented narrative.\r\nWhere we see that a man has the power, we may naturally suspect that\r\nhe has the will to deceive us; and those who are used to literary\r\nmanufacture know how much is often sacrificed to the rounding of a\r\nperiod, or the pointing of an antithesis.\r\n\r\nThat the ignorant may have their prejudices as well as the learned\r\ncannot be disputed; but we see and despise vulgar errors: we never\r\nbow to the authority of him who has no great name to sanction his\r\nabsurdities. The partiality which blinds a biographer to the defects of\r\nhis hero, in proportion as it is gross, ceases to be dangerous; but\r\nif it be concealed by the appearance of candour, which men of great\r\nabilities best know how to assume, it endangers our judgment sometimes,\r\nand sometimes our morals. If her Grace the Duchess of Newcastle, instead\r\nof penning her lord\xe2\x80\x99s elaborate eulogium, had undertaken to write the\r\nlife of Savage, we should not have been in any danger of mistaking an\r\nidle, ungrateful libertine for a man of genius and virtue. The talents\r\nof a biographer are often fatal to his reader. For these reasons the\r\npublic often judiciously countenance those who, without sagacity\r\nto discriminate character, without elegance of style to relieve the\r\ntediousness of narrative, without enlargement of mind to draw any\r\nconclusions from the facts they relate, simply pour forth anecdotes,\r\nand retail conversations, with all the minute prolixity of a gossip in a\r\ncountry town.\r\n\r\nThe author of the following Memoirs has upon these grounds fair claims\r\nto the public favour and attention; he was an illiterate old steward,\r\nwhose partiality to THE FAMILY, in which he was bred and born, must be\r\nobvious to the reader. He tells the history of the Rackrent family in\r\nhis vernacular idiom, and in the full confidence that Sir Patrick,\r\nSir Murtagh, Sir Kit, and Sir Condy Rackrent\xe2\x80\x99s affairs will be as\r\ninteresting to all the world as they were to himself. Those who were\r\nacquainted with the manners of a certain class of the gentry of Ireland\r\nsome years ago, will want no evidence of the truth of honest Thady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnarrative; to those who are totally unacquainted with Ireland, the\r\nfollowing Memoirs will perhaps be scarcely intelligible, or probably\r\nthey may appear perfectly incredible. For the information of the\r\nIGNORANT English reader, a few notes have been subjoined by the editor,\r\nand he had it once in contemplation to translate the language of Thady\r\ninto plain English; but Thady\xe2\x80\x99s idiom is incapable of translation, and,\r\nbesides, the authenticity of his story would have been more exposed\r\nto doubt if it were not told in his own characteristic manner. Several\r\nyears ago he related to the editor the history of the Rackrent family,\r\nand it was with some difficulty that he was persuaded to have it\r\ncommitted to writing; however, his feelings for \xe2\x80\x98THE HONOUR OF THE\r\nFAMILY,\xe2\x80\x99 as he expressed himself, prevailed over his habitual laziness,\r\nand he at length completed the narrative which is now laid before the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe editor hopes his readers will observe that these are \xe2\x80\x98tales of other\r\ntimes;\xe2\x80\x99 that the manners depicted in the following pages are not those\r\nof the present age; the race of the Rackrents has long since been\r\nextinct in Ireland; and the drunken Sir Patrick, the litigious\r\nSir Murtagh, the fighting Sir Kit, and the slovenly Sir Condy, are\r\ncharacters which could no more be met with at present in Ireland, than\r\nSquire Western or Parson Trulliber in England. There is a time\r\nwhen individuals can bear to be rallied for their past follies\r\nand absurdities, after they have acquired new habits and a new\r\nconsciousness. Nations, as well as individuals, gradually lose\r\nattachment to their identity, and the present generation is amused,\r\nrather than offended, by the ridicule that is thrown upon its ancestors.\r\n\r\nProbably we shall soon have it in our power, in a hundred instances, to\r\nverify the truth of these observations.\r\n\r\nWhen Ireland loses her identity by an union with Great Britain, she will\r\nlook back, with a smile of good-humoured complacency, on the Sir Kits\r\nand Sir Condys of her former existence.\r\n\r\n1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLE RACKRENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY MORNING[1].\r\n\r\nHaving, out of friendship for the family, upon whose estate, praised be\r\nHeaven! I and mine have lived rent-free time out of mind, voluntarily\r\nundertaken to publish the MEMOIRS OF THE RACKRENT FAMILY, I think it my\r\nduty to say a few words, in the first place, concerning myself. My real\r\nname is Thady Quirk, though in the family I have always been known by\r\nno other than \xe2\x80\x98Honest Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 afterward, in the time of Sir Murtagh,\r\ndeceased, I remember to hear them calling me \xe2\x80\x98Old Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 and now I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ncome to \xe2\x80\x98Poor Thady\xe2\x80\x99; for I wear a long greatcoat{3} winter and summer,\r\nwhich is very handy, as I never put my arms into the sleeves; they\r\nare as good as new, though come Holantide next I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it these seven\r\nyears: it holds on by a single button round my neck, cloak fashion.\r\n\r\n   {3} The cloak, or mantle, as described by Thady, is of high\r\n   antiquity. Spenser, in his VIEW OF THE STATE OF IRELAND, proves that\r\n   it is not, as some have imagined, peculiarly derived from the\r\n   Scythians, but that \xe2\x80\x98most nations of the world anciently used the\r\n   mantle; for the Jews used it, as you may read of Elias\xe2\x80\x99s mantle,\r\n   etc.; the Chaldees also used it, as you may read in Diodorus; the\r\n   Egyptians likewise used it, as you may read in Herodotus, and may be\r\n   gathered by the description of Berenice in the Greek Commentary upon\r\n   Callimachus; the Greeks also used it anciently, as appeared by\r\n   Venus\xe2\x80\x99s mantle lined with stars, though afterward they changed the\r\n   form thereof into their cloaks, called Pallai, as some of the Irish\r\n   also use; and the ancient Latins and Romans used it, as you may read\r\n   in Virgil, who was a great antiquary, that Evander, when \xc3\x86neas came\r\n   to him at his feast, did entertain and feast him sitting on the\r\n   ground, and lying on mantles: insomuch that he useth the very word\r\n   mantile for a mantle--\r\n\r\n             \xe2\x80\x9cHumi mantilia sternunt:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n   so that it seemeth that the mantle was a general habit to most\r\n   nations, and not proper to the Scythians only.\r\n\r\n   Spenser knew the convenience of the said mantle, as housing,\r\n   bedding, and clothing: \xe2\x80\x98IREN. Because the commodity doth not\r\n   countervail the discommodity; for the inconveniences which thereby\r\n   do arise are much more many; for it is a fit house for an outlaw, a\r\n   meet bed for a rebel, and an apt cloak for a thief. First, the\r\n   outlaw being, for his many crimes and villanies, banished from the\r\n   towns and houses of honest men, and wandering in waste places, far\r\n   from danger of law, maketh his mantle his house, and under it\r\n   covereth himself from the wrath of Heaven, from the offence of the\r\n   earth, and from the sight of men. When it raineth, it is his\r\n   penthouse; when it bloweth, it is his tent; when it freezeth, it is\r\n   his tabernacle. In summer he can wear it loose; in winter he can\r\n   wrap it close; at all times he can use it; never heavy, never\r\n   cumbersome. Likewise for a rebel it is as serviceable; for in this\r\n   war that he maketh (if at least it deserves the name of war), when\r\n   he still flieth from his foe, and lurketh in the THICK WOODS (this\r\n   should be BLACK BOGS) and straight passages, waiting for advantages,\r\n   it is his bed, yea, and almost his household stuff.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo look at me, you would hardly think \xe2\x80\x98Poor Thady\xe2\x80\x99 was the father of\r\nAttorney Quirk; he is a high gentleman, and never minds what poor Thady\r\nsays, and having better than fifteen hundred a year, landed estate,\r\nlooks down upon honest Thady; but I wash my hands of his doings, and as\r\nI have lived so will I die, true and loyal to the family. The family\r\nof the Rackrents is, I am proud to say, one of the most ancient in the\r\nkingdom. Everybody knows this is not the old family name, which was\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Shaughlin, related to the kings of Ireland--but that was before my\r\ntime. My grandfather was driver to the great Sir Patrick O\xe2\x80\x99Shaughlin,\r\nand I heard him, when I was a boy, telling how the Castle Rackrent\r\nestate came to Sir Patrick; Sir Tallyhoo Rackrent was cousin-german to\r\nhim, and had a fine estate of his own, only never a gate upon it, it\r\nbeing his maxim that a car was the best gate. Poor gentleman! he lost a\r\nfine hunter and his life, at last, by it, all in one day\xe2\x80\x99s hunt. But I\r\nought to bless that day, for the estate came straight into THE family,\r\nupon one condition, which Sir Patrick O\xe2\x80\x99Shaughlin at the time took sadly\r\nto heart, they say, but thought better of it afterwards, seeing how\r\nlarge a stake depended upon it: that he should, by Act of Parliament,\r\ntake and bear the surname and arms of Rackrent.\r\n\r\nNow it was that the world was to see what was IN Sir Patrick. On coming\r\ninto the estate he gave the finest entertainment ever was heard of in\r\nthe country; not a man could stand after supper but Sir Patrick himself\r\nwho could sit out the best man in Ireland, let alone the three kingdoms\r\nitself.[2] He had his house, from one year\xe2\x80\x99s end to\r\nanother, as full of company as ever it could hold, and fuller; for\r\nrather than be left out of the parties at Castle Rackrent, many\r\ngentlemen, and those men of the first consequence and landed estates in\r\nthe country--such as the O\xe2\x80\x99Neills of Ballynagrotty, and the Moneygawls\r\nof Mount Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town, and O\xe2\x80\x99Shannons of New Town Tullyhog--made it\r\ntheir choice, often and often, when there was no room to be had for love\r\nnor money, in long winter nights, to sleep in the chicken-house, which\r\nSir Patrick had fitted up for the purpose of accommodating his\r\nfriends and the public in general, who honoured him with their company\r\nunexpectedly at Castle Rackrent; and this went on I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how\r\nlong. The whole country rang with his praises!--long life to him! I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure I love to look upon his picture, now opposite to me; though I never\r\nsaw him, he must have been a portly gentleman--his neck something\r\nshort, and remarkable for the largest pimple on his nose, which, by his\r\nparticular desire, is still extant in his picture, said to be a striking\r\nlikeness, though taken when young. He is said also to be the inventor of\r\nraspberry whisky, which is very likely, as nobody has ever appeared to\r\ndispute it with him, and as there still exists a broken punch-bowl at\r\nCastle Rackrent, in the garret, with an inscription to that effect--a\r\ngreat curiosity. A few days before his death he was very merry; it being\r\nhis honour\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, he called my grandfather in--God bless him!--to\r\ndrink the company\xe2\x80\x99s health, and filled a bumper himself, but could not\r\ncarry it to his head, on account of the great shake in his hand; on this\r\nhe cast his joke, saying, \xe2\x80\x98What would my poor father say to me if he was\r\nto pop out of the grave, and see me now? I remember when I was a little\r\nboy, the first bumper of claret he gave me after dinner, how he praised\r\nme for carrying it so steady to my mouth. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my thanks to him--a\r\nbumper toast.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he fell to singing the favourite song he learned\r\nfrom his father--for the last time, poor gentleman--he sung it that\r\nnight as loud and as hearty as ever, with a chorus:\r\n\r\n    He that goes to bed, and goes to bed sober,\r\n    Falls as the leaves do, falls as the leaves do, and dies in October;\r\n    But he that goes to bed, and goes to bed mellow,\r\n    Lives as he ought to do, lives as he ought to do, and dies an honest fellow.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick died that night: just as the company rose to drink his\r\nhealth with three cheers, he fell down in a sort of fit, and was carried\r\noff; they sat it out, and were surprised, on inquiry in the morning, to\r\nfind that it was all over with poor Sir Patrick. Never did any gentleman\r\nlive and die more beloved in the country by rich and poor. His funeral\r\nwas such a one as was never known before or since in the county! All\r\nthe gentlemen in the three counties were at it; far and near, how they\r\nflocked! my great-grandfather said, that to see all the women, even in\r\ntheir red cloaks, you would have taken them for the army drawn out. Then\r\nsuch a fine whillaluh![3] you might have heard it to the\r\nfarthest end of the county, and happy the man who could get but a sight\r\nof the hearse! But who\xe2\x80\x99d have thought it? Just as all was going on\r\nright, through his own town they were passing, when the body was seized\r\nfor debt--a rescue was apprehended from the mob; but the heir, who\r\nattended the funeral, was against that, for fear of consequences, seeing\r\nthat those villains who came to serve acted under the disguise of the\r\nlaw: so, to be sure, the law must take its course, and little gain had\r\nthe creditors for their pains. First and foremost, they had the curses\r\nof the country: and Sir Murtagh Rackrent, the new heir, in the next\r\nplace, on account of this affront to the body, refused to pay a shilling\r\nof the debts, in which he was countenanced by all the best gentlemen of\r\nproperty, and others of his acquaintance; Sir Murtagh alleging in all\r\ncompanies that he all along meant to pay his father\xe2\x80\x99s debts of honour,\r\nbut the moment the law was taken of him, there was an end of honour\r\nto be sure. It was whispered (but none but the enemies of the family\r\nbelieve it) that this was all a sham seizure to get quit of the debts\r\nwhich he had bound himself to pay in honour.\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long time ago, there\xe2\x80\x99s no saying how it was, but this for\r\ncertain, the new man did not take at all after the old gentleman;\r\nthe cellars were never filled after his death, and no open house, or\r\nanything as it used to be; the tenants even were sent away without their\r\nwhisky.[4] I was ashamed myself, and knew not what to say\r\nfor the honour of the family; but I made the best of a bad case, and\r\nlaid it all at my lady\xe2\x80\x99s door, for I did not like her anyhow, nor\r\nanybody else; she was of the family of the Skinflints, and a widow; it\r\nwas a strange match for Sir Murtagh; the people in the country thought\r\nhe demeaned himself greatly,[5] but I said nothing; I\r\nknew how it was. Sir Murtagh was a great lawyer, and looked to the great\r\nSkinflint estate; there, however, he overshot himself; for though one of\r\nthe co-heiresses, he was never the better for her, for she outlived him\r\nmany\xe2\x80\x99s the long day--he could not see that to be sure when he married\r\nher. I must say for her, she made him the best of wives, being a very\r\nnotable, stirring woman, and looking close to everything. But I always\r\nsuspected she had Scotch blood in her veins; anything else I could\r\nhave looked over in her, from a regard to the family. She was a strict\r\nobserver, for self and servants, of Lent, and all fast-days, but not\r\nholidays. One of the maids having fainted three times the last day of\r\nLent, to keep soul and body together, we put a morsel of roast beef into\r\nher mouth, which came from Sir Murtagh\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, who never fasted, not\r\nhe; but somehow or other it unfortunately reached my lady\xe2\x80\x99s ears, and\r\nthe priest of the parish had a complaint made of it the next day, and\r\nthe poor girl was forced, as soon as she could walk, to do penance for\r\nit, before she could get any peace or absolution, in the house or out\r\nof it. However, my lady was very charitable in her own way. She had a\r\ncharity school for poor children, where they were taught to read and\r\nwrite gratis, and where they were kept well to spinning gratis for my\r\nlady in return; for she had always heaps of duty yarn from the tenants,\r\nand got all her household linen out of the estate from first to last;\r\nfor after the spinning, the weavers on the estate took it in hand for\r\nnothing, because of the looms my lady\xe2\x80\x99s interest could get from the\r\nLinen Board to distribute gratis. Then there was a bleach-yard near us,\r\nand the tenant dare refuse my lady nothing, for fear of a lawsuit Sir\r\nMurtagh kept hanging over him about the watercourse. With these ways\r\nof managing, \xe2\x80\x98tis surprising how cheap my lady got things done, and how\r\nproud she was of it. Her table the same way, kept for next to nothing;[6]\r\nduty fowls, and duty turkeys, and duty geese, came as\r\nfast as we could eat \xe2\x80\x98em, for my lady kept a sharp lookout, and knew\r\nto a tub of butter everything the tenants had, all round. They knew her\r\nway, and what with fear of driving for rent and Sir Murtagh\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuits,\r\nthey were kept in such good order, they never thought of coming near\r\nCastle Rackrent without a present of something or other--nothing too\r\nmuch or too little for my lady--eggs, honey, butter, meal, fish, game,\r\ngrouse, and herrings, fresh or salt, all went for something. As for\r\ntheir young pigs, we had them, and the best bacon and hams they could\r\nmake up, with all young chickens in spring; but they were a set of poor\r\nwretches, and we had nothing but misfortunes with them, always breaking\r\nand running away. This, Sir Murtagh and my lady said, was all their\r\nformer landlord Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s fault, who let \xe2\x80\x98em all get the half-year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrent into arrear; there was something in that to be sure. But Sir\r\nMurtagh was as much the contrary way; for let alone making English\r\ntenants[7] of them, every soul, he was always driving\r\nand driving, and pounding and pounding, and canting[8] and canting,\r\nand replevying and replevying, and he made a good living\r\nof trespassing cattle; there was always some tenant\xe2\x80\x99s pig, or horse, or\r\ncow, or calf, or goose, trespassing, which was so great a gain to Sir\r\nMurtagh, that he did not like to hear me talk of repairing fences. Then\r\nhis heriots and duty-work[9] brought him in something, his\r\nturf was cut, his potatoes set and dug, his hay brought home, and, in\r\nshort, all the work about his house done for nothing; for in all our\r\nleases there were strict clauses heavy with penalties, which Sir Murtagh\r\nknew well how to enforce; so many days\xe2\x80\x99 duty-work of man and horse, from\r\nevery tenant, he was to have, and had, every year; and when a man vexed\r\nhim, why, the finest day he could pitch on, when the cratur was getting\r\nin his own harvest, or thatching his cabin, Sir Murtagh made it a\r\nprinciple to call upon him and his horse; so he taught \xe2\x80\x98em all, as he\r\nsaid, to know the law of landlord and tenant. As for law, I believe no\r\nman, dead or alive, ever loved it so well as Sir Murtagh. He had once\r\nsixteen suits pending at a time, and I never saw him so much himself:\r\nroads, lanes, bogs, wells, ponds, eel-wires, orchards, trees, tithes,\r\nvagrants, gravelpits, sandpits, dunghills, and nuisances, everything\r\nupon the face of the earth furnished him good matter for a suit. He used\r\nto boast that he had a lawsuit for every letter in the alphabet. How\r\nI used to wonder to see Sir Murtagh in the midst of the papers in his\r\noffice! Why, he could hardly turn about for them. I made bold to shrug\r\nmy shoulders once in his presence, and thanked my stars I was not born a\r\ngentleman to so much toil and trouble; but Sir Murtagh took me up short\r\nwith his old proverb, \xe2\x80\x98learning is better than house or land.\xe2\x80\x99 Out of\r\nforty-nine suits which he had, he never lost one but seventeen;[10]\r\nthe rest he gained with costs, double costs, treble costs\r\nsometimes; but even that did not pay. He was a very learned man in the\r\nlaw, and had the character of it; but how it was I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell, these\r\nsuits that he carried cost him a power of money: in the end he sold some\r\nhundreds a year of the family estate; but he was a very learned man in\r\nthe law, and I know nothing of the matter, except having a great regard\r\nfor the family; and I could not help grieving when he sent me to post up\r\nnotices of the sale of the fee simple of the lands and appurtenances of\r\nTimoleague.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know, honest Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, to comfort me, \xe2\x80\x98what I\xe2\x80\x99m about better\r\nthan you do; I\xe2\x80\x99m only selling to get the ready money wanting to carry on\r\nmy suit with spirit with the Nugents of Carrickashaughlin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was very sanguine about that suit with the Nugents of\r\nCarrickashaughlin. He could have gained it, they say, for certain, had\r\nit pleased Heaven to have spared him to us, and it would have been at\r\nthe least a plump two thousand a year in his way; but things were\r\nordered otherwise--for the best to be sure. He dug up a fairy-mount{4}\r\nagainst my advice, and had no luck afterwards. Though a learned man in\r\nthe law, he was a little too incredulous in other matters. I warned him\r\nthat I heard the very Banshee{5} that my grandfather heard under Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s window a few days before his death. But Sir Murtagh thought\r\nnothing of the Banshee, nor of his cough, with a spitting of blood,\r\nbrought on, I understand, by catching cold in attending the courts, and\r\noverstraining his chest with making himself heard in one of his\r\nfavourite causes. He was a great speaker with a powerful voice; but his\r\nlast speech was not in the courts at all. He and my lady, though both\r\nof the same way of thinking in some things, and though she was as good\r\na wife and great economist as you could see, and he the best of\r\nhusbands, as to looking into his affairs, and making money for his\r\nfamily; yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it was, they had a great deal of sparring\r\nand jarring between them. My lady had her privy purse; and she had her\r\nweed ashes,[12] and her sealing money[13] upon the signing of all the\r\nleases, with something to buy gloves besides; and, besides, again often\r\ntook money from the tenants, if offered properly, to speak for them to\r\nSir Murtagh about abatements and renewals. Now the weed ashes and the\r\nglove money he allowed her clear perquisites; though once when he saw\r\nher in a new gown saved out of the weed ashes, he told her to my face\r\n(for he could say a sharp thing) that she should not put on her weeds\r\nbefore her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death. But in a dispute about an abatement my lady\r\nwould have the last word, and Sir Murtagh grew mad;[14] I was within\r\nhearing of the door, and now I wish I had made bold to step in. He\r\nspoke so loud, the whole kitchen was out on the stairs.[15] All on a\r\nsudden he stopped, and my lady too. Something has surely happened,\r\nthought I; and so it was, for Sir Murtagh in his passion broke a\r\nblood-vessel, and all the law in the land could do nothing in that\r\ncase. My lady sent for five physicians, but Sir Murtagh died, and was\r\nburied. She had a fine jointure settled upon her, and took herself\r\naway, to the great joy of the tenantry. I never said anything one way\r\nor the other whilst she was part of the family, but got up to see her\r\ngo at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n   {4} These fairy-mounts are called ant-hills in England. They are\r\n   held in high reverence by the common people in Ireland. A gentleman,\r\n   who in laying out his lawn had occasion to level one of these\r\n   hillocks, could not prevail upon any of his labourers to begin the\r\n   ominous work. He was obliged to take a LOY from one of their\r\n   reluctant hands, and began the attack himself. The labourers agreed\r\n   that the vengeance of the fairies would fall upon the head of the\r\n   presumptuous mortal who first disturbed them in their retreat.[11]\r\n\r\n   {5} The Banshee is a species of aristocratic fairy, who, in the\r\n   shape of a little hideous old woman, has been known to appear, and\r\n   heard to sing in a mournful supernatural voice under the windows of\r\n   great houses, to warn the family that some of them are soon to die.\r\n   In the last century every great family in Ireland had a Banshee, who\r\n   attended regularly; but latterly their visits and songs have been\r\n   discontinued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a fine morning, honest Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 says she; \xe2\x80\x98good-bye to ye.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\ninto the carriage she stepped, without a word more, good or bad, or even\r\nhalf-a-crown; but I made my bow, and stood to see her safe out of sight\r\nfor the sake of the family.\r\n\r\nThen we were all bustle in the house, which made me keep out of the\r\nway, for I walk slow and hate a bustle; but the house was all\r\nhurry-skurry, preparing for my new master. Sir Murtagh, I forgot to\r\nnotice, had no childer;{6} so the Rackrent estate went to his younger\r\nbrother, a young dashing officer, who came amongst us before I knew for\r\nthe life of me whereabouts I was, in a gig or some of them things, with\r\nanother spark along with him, and led horses, and servants, and dogs,\r\nand scarce a place to put any Christian of them into; for my late lady\r\nhad sent all the feather-beds off before her, and blankets and\r\nhousehold linen, down to the very knife-cloths, on the cars to Dublin,\r\nwhich were all her own, lawfully paid for out of her own money. So the\r\nhouse was quite bare, and my young master, the moment ever he set foot\r\nin it out of his gig, thought all those things must come of themselves,\r\nI believe, for he never looked after anything at all, but harum-scarum\r\ncalled for everything as if we were conjurors, or he in a public-house.\r\nFor my part, I could not bestir myself anyhow; I had been so much used\r\nto my late master and mistress, all was upside down with me, and the\r\nnew servants in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall were quite out of my way; I had\r\nnobody to talk to, and if it had not been for my pipe and tobacco,\r\nshould, I verily believe, have broke my heart for poor Sir Murtagh.\r\n\r\n   {6} CHILDER: this is the manner in which many of Thady\xe2\x80\x99s rank, and\r\n   others in Ireland, formerly pronounced the word CHILDREN\r\n\r\nBut one morning my new master caught a glimpse of me as I was looking at\r\nhis horse\xe2\x80\x99s heels, in hopes of a word from him. \xe2\x80\x98And is that old Thady?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays he, as he got into his gig: I loved him from that day to this,\r\nhis voice was so like the family; and he threw me a guinea out of his\r\nwaistcoat-pocket, as he drew up the reins with the other hand, his horse\r\nrearing too; I thought I never set my eyes on a finer figure of a man,\r\nquite another sort from Sir Murtagh, though withal, TO ME, a family\r\nlikeness. A fine life we should have led, had he stayed amongst us, God\r\nbless him! He valued a guinea as little as any man: money to him was no\r\nmore than dirt, and his gentleman and groom, and all belonging to him,\r\nthe same; but the sporting season over, he grew tired of the place, and\r\nhaving got down a great architect for the house, and an improver for\r\nthe grounds, and seen their plans and elevations, he fixed a day for\r\nsettling with the tenants, but went off in a whirlwind to town, just as\r\nsome of them came into the yard in the morning. A circular letter came\r\nnext post from the new agent, with news that the master was sailed for\r\nEngland, and he must remit \xc2\xa3500 to Bath for his use before a fortnight\r\nwas at an end; bad news still for the poor tenants, no change still for\r\nthe better with them. Sir Kit Rackrent, my young master, left all to the\r\nagent; and though he had the spirit of a prince, and lived away to the\r\nhonour of his country abroad, which I was proud to hear of, what were\r\nwe the better for that at home? The agent was one of your middlemen,{7} who\r\ngrind the face of the poor, and can never bear a man with a hat upon his\r\nhead: he ferreted the tenants out of their lives; not a week without a\r\ncall for money, drafts upon drafts from Sir Kit; but I laid it all to\r\nthe fault of the agent; for, says I, what can Sir Kit do with so much\r\ncash, and he a single man?\r\n\r\n   {7} MIDDLEMEN.--There was a class of men, termed middlemen, in\r\n   Ireland, who took large farms on long leases from gentlemen of\r\n   landed property, and let the land again in small portions to the\r\n   poor, as under-tenants, at exorbitant rents. The HEAD LANDLORD, as\r\n   he was called, seldom saw his UNDER-TENANTS; but if he could not get\r\n   the MIDDLEMAN to pay him his rent punctually, he WENT TO HIS LAND,\r\n   AND DROVE THE LAND FOR HIS RENT; that is to say, he sent his\r\n   steward, or bailiff, or driver, to the land to seize the cattle,\r\n   hay, corn, flax, oats, or potatoes, belonging to the under-tenants,\r\n   and proceeded to sell these for his rents. It sometimes happened\r\n   that these unfortunate tenants paid their rent twice over, once to\r\n   the MIDDLEMAN, and once to the HEAD LANDLORD.\r\n\r\n   The characteristics of a middleman were servility to his superiors\r\n   and tyranny towards his inferiors: the poor detested this race of\r\n   beings. In speaking to them, however, they always used the most\r\n   abject language, and the most humble tone and posture--\xe2\x80\x98PLEASE YOUR\r\n   HONOUR; AND PLEASE YOUR HONOUR\xe2\x80\x99S HONOUR,\xe2\x80\x99 they knew must be repeated\r\n   as a charm at the beginning and end of every equivocating,\r\n   exculpatory, or supplicatory sentence; and they were much more alert\r\n   in doffing their caps to those new men than to those of what they\r\n   call GOOD OLD FAMILIES. A witty carpenter once termed these\r\n   middlemen JOURNEYMEN GENTLEMEN.\r\n\r\nBut still it went. Rents must be all paid up to the day, and afore;\r\nno allowance for improving tenants, no consideration for those who had\r\nbuilt upon their farms: no sooner was a lease out, but the land was\r\nadvertised to the highest bidder; all the old tenants turned out, when\r\nthey spent their substance in the hope and trust of a renewal from\r\nthe landlord. All was now let at the highest penny to a parcel of poor\r\nwretches, who meant to run away, and did so, after taking two crops out\r\nof the ground. Then fining down the year\xe2\x80\x99s rent came into fashion[16]--anything for the ready penny; and with all this and\r\npresents to the agent and the driver,[17] there was no\r\nsuch thing as standing it. I said nothing, for I had a regard for the\r\nfamily; but I walked about thinking if his honour Sir Kit knew all\r\nthis, it would go hard with him but he\xe2\x80\x99d see us righted; not that I had\r\nanything for my own share to complain of, for the agent was always very\r\ncivil to me when he came down into the country, and took a great deal of\r\nnotice of my son Jason. Jason Quirk, though he be my son, I must say was\r\na good scholar from his birth, and a very \xe2\x80\x98cute lad: I thought to make\r\nhim a priest,[18] but he did better for himself; seeing\r\nhow he was as good a clerk as any in the county, the agent gave him his\r\nrent accounts to copy, which he did first of all for the pleasure of\r\nobliging the gentleman, and would take nothing at all for his trouble,\r\nbut was always proud to serve the family. By and by a good farm bounding\r\nus to the east fell into his honour\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and my son put in a\r\nproposal for it: why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he, as well as another? The proposals\r\nall went over to the master at the Bath, who knowing no more of the land\r\nthan the child unborn, only having once been out a-grousing on it before\r\nhe went to England; and the value of lands, as the agent informed him,\r\nfalling every year in Ireland, his honour wrote over in all haste a bit\r\nof a letter, saying he left it all to the agent, and that he must let it\r\nas well as he could--to the best bidder, to be sure--and send him over\r\n\xc2\xa3200 by return of post: with this the agent gave me a hint, and I spoke\r\na good word for my son, and gave out in the country that nobody need bid\r\nagainst us. So his proposal was just the thing, and he a good tenant;\r\nand he got a promise of an abatement in the rent after the first year,\r\nfor advancing the half-year\xe2\x80\x99s rent at signing the lease, which was\r\nwanting to complete the agent\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa3200 by the return of the post, with\r\nall which my master wrote back he was well satisfied. About this time\r\nwe learnt from the agent, as a great secret, how the money went so fast,\r\nand the reason of the thick coming of the master\xe2\x80\x99s drafts: he was a\r\nlittle too fond of play; and Bath, they say, was no place for no young\r\nman of his fortune, where there were so many of his own countrymen,\r\ntoo, hunting him up and down, day and night, who had nothing to lose.\r\nAt last, at Christmas, the agent wrote over to stop the drafts, for he\r\ncould raise no more money on bond or mortgage, or from the tenants, or\r\nanyhow, nor had he any more to lend himself, and desired at the same\r\ntime to decline the agency for the future, wishing Sir Kit his health\r\nand happiness, and the compliments of the season, for I saw the letter\r\nbefore ever it was sealed, when my son copied it. When the answer came\r\nthere was a new turn in affairs, and the agent was turned out; and my\r\nson Jason, who had corresponded privately with his honour occasionally\r\non business, was forthwith desired by his honour to take the accounts\r\ninto his own hands, and look them over, till further orders. It was\r\na very spirited letter to be sure: Sir Kit sent his service, and the\r\ncompliments of the season, in return to the agent, and he would fight\r\nhim with pleasure to-morrow, or any day, for sending him such a letter,\r\nif he was born a gentleman, which he was sorry (for both their sakes)\r\nto find (too late) he was not. Then, in a private postscript, he\r\ncondescended to tell us that all would be speedily settled to his\r\nsatisfaction, and we should turn over a new leaf, for he was going to be\r\nmarried in a fortnight to the grandest heiress in England, and had only\r\nimmediate occasion at present for \xc2\xa3200, as he would not choose to touch\r\nhis lady\xe2\x80\x99s fortune for travelling expenses home to Castle Rackrent,\r\nwhere he intended to be, wind and weather permitting, early in the\r\nnext month; and desired fires, and the house to be painted, and the new\r\nbuilding to go on as fast as possible, for the reception of him and his\r\nlady before that time; with several words besides in the letter, which\r\nwe could not make out because, God bless him! he wrote in such a flurry.\r\nMy heart warmed to my new lady when I read this: I was almost afraid it\r\nwas too good news to be true; but the girls fell to scouring, and it was\r\nwell they did, for we soon saw his marriage in the paper, to a lady with\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many tens of thousand pounds to her fortune: then I\r\nwatched the post-office for his landing; and the news came to my son\r\nof his and the bride being in Dublin, and on the way home to Castle\r\nRackrent. We had bonfires all over the country, expecting him down the\r\nnext day, and we had his coming of age still to celebrate, which he had\r\nnot time to do properly before he left the country; therefore, a great\r\nball was expected, and great doings upon his coming, as it were, fresh\r\nto take possession of his ancestors\xe2\x80\x99 estate. I never shall forget the\r\nday he came home; we had waited and waited all day long till eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, and I was thinking of sending the boy to lock the\r\ngates, and giving them up for that night, when there came the carriages\r\nthundering up to the great hall door. I got the first sight of the\r\nbride; for when the carriage door opened, just as she had her foot on\r\nthe steps, I held the flam full in her face[19] to light her,\r\nat which she shut her eyes, but I had a full view of the rest of\r\nher, and greatly shocked I was, for by that light she was little better\r\nthan a blackamoor, and seemed crippled; but that was only sitting so\r\nlong in the chariot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re kindly welcome to Castle Rackrent, my lady,\xe2\x80\x99 says I\r\n(recollecting who she was). \xe2\x80\x98Did your honour hear of the bonfires?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis honour spoke never a word, nor so much as handed her up the\r\nsteps--he looked to me no more like himself than nothing at all; I know\r\nI took him for the skeleton of his honour. I was not sure what to say\r\nnext to one or t\xe2\x80\x99other, but seeing she was a stranger in a foreign\r\ncountry, I thought it but right to speak cheerful to her; so I went back\r\nagain to the bonfires.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My lady,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, as she crossed the hall, \xe2\x80\x98there would have been\r\nfifty times as many; but for fear of the horses, and frightening your\r\nladyship, Jason and I forbid them, please your honour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith that she looked at me a little bewildered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will I have a fire lighted in the state-room to-night?\xe2\x80\x99 was the next\r\nquestion I put to her, but never a word she answered; so I concluded she\r\ncould not speak a word of English, and was from foreign parts. The short\r\nand the long of it was, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell what to make of her; so I left\r\nher to herself, and went straight down to the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall to learn\r\nsomething for certain about her. Sir Kit\xe2\x80\x99s own man was tired, but the\r\ngroom set him a-talking at last, and we had it all out before ever I\r\nclosed my eyes that night. The bride might well be a great fortune--she\r\nwas a JEWISH by all accounts, who are famous for their great riches. I\r\nhad never seen any of that tribe or nation before, and could only gather\r\nthat she spoke a strange kind of English of her own, that she could not\r\nabide pork or sausages, and went neither to church or mass. Mercy upon\r\nhis honour\xe2\x80\x99s poor soul, thought I; what will become of him and his,\r\nand all of us, with his heretic blackamoor at the head of the Castle\r\nRackrent estate? I never slept a wink all night for thinking of it;\r\nbut before the servants I put my pipe in my mouth, and kept my mind to\r\nmyself, for I had a great regard for the family; and after this, when\r\nstrange gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s servants came to the house, and would begin to talk\r\nabout the bride, I took care to put the best foot foremost, and passed\r\nher for a nabob in the kitchen, which accounted for her dark complexion\r\nand everything.\r\n\r\nThe very morning after they came home, however, I saw plain enough\r\nhow things were between Sir Kit and my lady, though they were walking\r\ntogether arm in arm after breakfast, looking at the new building and the\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 said my master, just as he used to do, \xe2\x80\x98how do you do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, I thank your honour\xe2\x80\x99s honour,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; but I saw he was not\r\nwell pleased, and my heart was in my mouth as I walked along after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is the large room damp, Thady?\xe2\x80\x99 said his honour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh damp, your honour! how should it be but as dry as a bone,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nI, \xe2\x80\x98after all the fires we have kept in it day and night? It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbarrack-room[20] your honour\xe2\x80\x99s talking on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what is a barrack-room, pray, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 were the first words I ever\r\nheard out of my lady\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No matter, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and went on talking to me, ashamed-like\r\nI should witness her ignorance. To be sure, to hear her talk one might\r\nhave taken her for an innocent,[21] for it was, \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthis, Sir Kit? and what\xe2\x80\x99s that, Sir Kit?\xe2\x80\x99 all the way we went. To be\r\nsure, Sir Kit had enough to do to answer her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what do you call that, Sir Kit?\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98that--that looks like\r\na pile of black bricks, pray, Sir Kit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My turf-stack, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said my master, and bit his lip.\r\n\r\nWhere have you lived, my lady, all your life, not to know a turf-stack\r\nwhen you see it? thought I; but I said nothing. Then by and by she takes\r\nout her glass, and begins spying over the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what\xe2\x80\x99s all that black swamp out yonder, Sir Kit?\xe2\x80\x99 says she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My bog, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, and went on whistling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a very ugly prospect, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 says she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t see it, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98for we\xe2\x80\x99ve planted it out; when\r\nthe trees grow up in summer-time--\xe2\x80\x99 says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are the trees,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 still looking through her\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are blind, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 says he; \xe2\x80\x98what are these under your eyes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98These shrubs?\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Trees,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Maybe they are what you call trees in Ireland, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nthey are not a yard high, are they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They were planted out but last year, my lady,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, to soften\r\nmatters between them, for I saw she was going the way to make his honour\r\nmad with her: \xe2\x80\x98they are very well grown for their age, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll not\r\nsee the bog of Allyballycarrick-o\xe2\x80\x99shaughlin at-all-at-all through\r\nthe skreen, when once the leaves come out. But, my lady, you must not\r\nquarrel with any part or parcel of Allyballycarricko\xe2\x80\x99shaughlin, for you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how many hundred years that same bit of bog has been in the\r\nfamily; we would not part with the bog of Allyballycarricko\xe2\x80\x99shaughlin\r\nupon no account at all; it cost the late Sir Murtagh two hundred good\r\npounds to defend his title to it and boundaries against the O\xe2\x80\x99Learys,\r\nwho cut a road through it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow one would have thought this would have been hint enough for my lady,\r\nbut she fell to laughing like one out of their right mind, and made me\r\nsay the name of the bog over, for her to get it by heart, a dozen times;\r\nthen she must ask me how to spell it, and what was the meaning of it in\r\nEnglish--Sir Kit standing by whistling all the while. I verily believed\r\nshe laid the corner-stone of all her future misfortunes at that very\r\ninstant; but I said no more, only looked at Sir Kit.\r\n\r\nThere were no balls, no dinners, no doings; the country was all\r\ndisappointed--Sir Kit\xe2\x80\x99s gentleman said in a whisper to me, it was all my\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s own fault, because she was so obstinate about the cross.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What cross?\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98is it about her being a heretic?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no such matter,\xe2\x80\x99 says he; \xe2\x80\x98my master does not mind her heresies,\r\nbut her diamond cross it\xe2\x80\x99s worth I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how much, and she has\r\nthousands of English pounds concealed in diamonds about her, which she\r\nas good as promised to give up to my master before he married; but now\r\nshe won\xe2\x80\x99t part with any of them, and she must take the consequences.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer honeymoon, at least her Irish honeymoon, was scarcely well over,\r\nwhen his honour one morning said to me, \xe2\x80\x98Thady, buy me a pig!\xe2\x80\x99 and then\r\nthe sausages were ordered, and here was the first open breaking-out of\r\nmy lady\xe2\x80\x99s troubles. My lady came down herself into the kitchen to speak\r\nto the cook about the sausages, and desired never to see them more at\r\nher table. Now my master had ordered them, and my lady knew that. The\r\ncook took my lady\xe2\x80\x99s part, because she never came down into the kitchen,\r\nand was young and innocent in housekeeping, which raised her pity;\r\nbesides, said she, at her own table, surely my lady should order and\r\ndisorder what she pleases. But the cook soon changed her note, for my\r\nmaster made it a principle to have the sausages, and swore at her for a\r\nJew herself, till he drove her fairly out of the kitchen; then, for fear\r\nof her place, and because he threatened that my lady should give her no\r\ndischarge without the sausages, she gave up, and from that day forward\r\nalways sausages, or bacon, or pig-meat in some shape or other, went up\r\nto table; upon which my lady shut herself up in her own room, and my\r\nmaster said she might stay there, with an oath: and to make sure of her,\r\nhe turned the key in the door, and kept it ever after in his pocket. We\r\nnone of us ever saw or heard her speak for seven years after that:{8}\r\nhe carried her dinner himself.\r\n\r\n   {8} This part of the history of the Rackrent family can scarcely be\r\n   thought credible; but in justice to honest Thady, it is hoped the\r\n   reader will recollect the history of the celebrated Lady Cathcart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n   conjugal imprisonment. The editor was acquainted with Colonel\r\n   M\xe2\x80\x99Guire, Lady Cathcart\xe2\x80\x99s husband; he has lately seen and questioned\r\n   the maid-servant who lived with Colonel M\xe2\x80\x99Guire during the time of\r\n   Lady Cathcart\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment. Her ladyship was locked up in her own\r\n   house for many years, during which period her husband was visited by\r\n   the neighbouring gentry, and it was his regular custom at dinner to\r\n   send his compliments to Lady Cathcart, informing her that the\r\n   company had the honour to drink her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s health, and begging\r\n   to know whether there was anything at table that she would like to\r\n   eat? The answer was always, \xe2\x80\x98Lady Cathcart\xe2\x80\x99s compliments, and she\r\n   has everything she wants.\xe2\x80\x99 An instance of honesty in a poor\r\n   Irishwoman deserves to be recorded. Lady Cathcart had some\r\n   remarkably fine diamonds, which she had concealed from her husband,\r\n   and which she was anxious to get out of the house, lest he should\r\n   discover them. She had neither servant nor friend to whom she could\r\n   entrust them, but she had observed a poor beggar woman, who used to\r\n   come to the house; she spoke to her from the window of the room in\r\n   which she was confined; the woman promised to do what she desired,\r\n   and Lady Cathcart threw a parcel containing the jewels to her. The\r\n   poor woman carried them to the person to whom they were directed,\r\n   and several years afterwards, when Lady Cathcart recovered her\r\n   liberty, she received her diamonds safely.\r\n\r\n   At Colonel M\xe2\x80\x99Guire\xe2\x80\x99s death her ladyship was released. The editor,\r\n   within this year, saw the gentleman who accompanied her to England\r\n   after her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death. When she first was told of his death she\r\n   imagined that the news was not true, and that it was told only with\r\n   an intention of deceiving her. At his death she had scarcely clothes\r\n   sufficient to cover her; she wore a red wig, looked scared, and her\r\n   understanding seemed stupefied; she said that she scarcely knew one\r\n   human creature from another; her imprisonment lasted above twenty\r\n   years. These circumstances may appear strange to an English reader;\r\n   but there is no danger in the present times that any individual\r\n   should exercise such tyranny as Colonel M\xe2\x80\x99Guire\xe2\x80\x99s with impunity, the\r\n   power being now all in the hands of Government, and there being no\r\n   possibility of obtaining from Parliament an Act of indemnity for any\r\n   cruelties.\r\n\r\nThen his honour had a great deal of company to dine with him, and balls\r\nin the house, and was as gay and gallant, and as much himself as before\r\nhe was married; and at dinner he always drank my Lady Rackrent\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nhealth and so did the company, and he sent out always a servant with\r\nhis compliments to my Lady Rackrent, and the company was drinking her\r\nladyship\xe2\x80\x99s health, and begged to know if there was anything at table he\r\nmight send her, and the man came back, after the sham errand, with\r\nmy Lady Rackrent\xe2\x80\x99s compliments, and she was very much obliged to Sir\r\nKit--she did not wish for anything, but drank the company\xe2\x80\x99s health. The\r\ncountry, to be sure, talked and wondered at my lady\xe2\x80\x99s being shut up,\r\nbut nobody chose to interfere or ask any impertinent questions, for they\r\nknew my master was a man very apt to give a short answer himself, and\r\nlikely to call a man out for it afterwards: he was a famous shot, had\r\nkilled his man before he came of age, and nobody scarce dared look at\r\nhim whilst at Bath. Sir Kit\xe2\x80\x99s character was so well known in the\r\ncountry that he lived in peace and quietness ever after, and was a great\r\nfavourite with the ladies, especially when in process of time, in\r\nthe fifth year of her confinement, my Lady Rackrent fell ill and took\r\nentirely to her bed, and he gave out that she was now skin and bone,\r\nand could not last through the winter. In this he had two physicians\xe2\x80\x99\r\nopinions to back him (for now he called in two physicians for her), and\r\ntried all his arts to get the diamond cross from her on her death-bed,\r\nand to get her to make a will in his favour of her separate possessions;\r\nbut there she was too tough for him. He used to swear at her behind her\r\nback after kneeling to her face, and call her in the presence of his\r\ngentleman his stiff-necked Israelite, though before he married her that\r\nsame gentleman told me he used to call her (how he could bring it out,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know) \xe2\x80\x98my pretty Jessica!\xe2\x80\x99 To be sure it must have been hard for\r\nher to guess what sort of a husband he reckoned to make her. When she\r\nwas lying, to all expectation, on her death-bed of a broken heart, I\r\ncould not but pity her, though she was a Jewish, and considering too it\r\nwas no fault of hers to be taken with my master, so young as she was at\r\nthe Bath, and so fine a gentleman as Sir Kit was when he courted her;\r\nand considering too, after all they had heard and seen of him as a\r\nhusband, there were now no less than three ladies in our county talked\r\nof for his second wife, all at daggers drawn with each other, as his\r\ngentleman swore, at the balls, for Sir Kit for their partner--I could\r\nnot but think them bewitched, but they all reasoned with themselves\r\nthat Sir Kit would make a good husband to any Christian but a Jewish,\r\nI suppose, and especially as he was now a reformed rake; and it was not\r\nknown how my lady\xe2\x80\x99s fortune was settled in her will, nor how the Castle\r\nRackrent estate was all mortgaged, and bonds out against him, for he was\r\nnever cured of his gaming tricks; but that was the only fault he had,\r\nGod bless him!\r\n\r\nMy lady had a sort of fit, and it was given out that she was dead, by\r\nmistake: this brought things to a sad crisis for my poor master. One\r\nof the three ladies showed his letters to her brother, and claimed his\r\npromises, whilst another did the same. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mention names. Sir Kit,\r\nin his defence, said he would meet any man who dared to question his\r\nconduct; and as to the ladies, they must settle it amongst them who was\r\nto be his second, and his third, and his fourth, whilst his first was\r\nstill alive, to his mortification and theirs. Upon this, as upon all\r\nformer occasions, he had the voice of the country with him, on account\r\nof the great spirit and propriety he acted with. He met and shot the\r\nfirst lady\xe2\x80\x99s brother: the next day he called out the second, who had\r\na wooden leg, and their place of meeting by appointment being in a\r\nnew-ploughed field, the wooden-leg man stuck fast in it. Sir Kit, seeing\r\nhis situation, with great candour fired his pistol over his head; upon\r\nwhich the seconds interposed, and convinced the parties there had been\r\na slight misunderstanding between them: thereupon they shook hands\r\ncordially, and went home to dinner together. This gentleman, to show the\r\nworld how they stood together, and by the advice of the friends of both\r\nparties, to re-establish his sister\xe2\x80\x99s injured reputation, went out with\r\nSir Kit as his second, and carried his message next day to the last of\r\nhis adversaries: I never saw him in such fine spirits as that day he\r\nwent out--sure enough he was within ames-ace of getting quit handsomely\r\nof all his enemies; but unluckily, after hitting the toothpick out of\r\nhis adversary\xe2\x80\x99s finger and thumb, he received a ball in a vital part,\r\nand was brought home, in little better than an hour after the affair,\r\nspeechless on a hand-barrow to my lady. We got the key out of his pocket\r\nthe first thing we did, and my son Jason ran to unlock the barrack-room,\r\nwhere my lady had been shut up for seven years, to acquaint her with the\r\nfatal accident. The surprise bereaved her of her senses at first, nor\r\nwould she believe but we were putting some new trick upon her, to entrap\r\nher out of her jewels, for a great while, till Jason bethought himself\r\nof taking her to the window, and showed her the men bringing Sir Kit\r\nup the avenue upon the hand-barrow, which had immediately the desired\r\neffect; for directly she burst into tears, and pulling her cross from\r\nher bosom, she kissed it with as great devotion as ever I witnessed,\r\nand lifting up her eyes to heaven, uttered some ejaculation, which none\r\npresent heard; but I take the sense of it to be, she returned thanks for\r\nthis unexpected interposition in her favour when she had least reason to\r\nexpect it. My master was greatly lamented: there was no life in him\r\nwhen we lifted him off the barrow, so he was laid out immediately, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98waked\xe2\x80\x99 the same night. The country was all in an uproar about him, and\r\nnot a soul but cried shame upon his murderer, who would have been hanged\r\nsurely, if he could have been brought to his trial, whilst the gentlemen\r\nin the country were up about it; but he very prudently withdrew himself\r\nto the Continent before the affair was made public. As for the young\r\nlady who was the immediate cause of the fatal accident, however\r\ninnocently, she could never show her head after at the balls in the\r\ncounty or any place; and by the advice of her friends and physicians,\r\nshe was ordered soon after to Bath, where it was expected, if anywhere\r\non this side of the grave, she would meet with the recovery of her\r\nhealth and lost peace of mind. As a proof of his great popularity, I\r\nneed only add that there was a song made upon my master\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death\r\nin the newspapers, which was in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, singing up and down\r\nthrough the country, even down to the mountains, only three days after\r\nhis unhappy exit. He was also greatly bemoaned at the Curragh,[22]\r\nwhere his cattle were well known; and all who had taken\r\nup his bets were particularly inconsolable for his loss to society. His\r\nstud sold at the cant[23] at the greatest price ever known in the\r\ncounty; his favourite horses were chiefly disposed of amongst\r\nhis particular friends, who would give any price for them for his sake;\r\nbut no ready money was required by the new heir, who wished not to\r\ndisplease any of the gentlemen of the neighbourhood just upon his coming\r\nto settle amongst them; so a long credit was given where requisite, and\r\nthe cash has never been gathered in from that day to this.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my lady. She got surprisingly well after my master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndecease. No sooner was it known for certain that he was dead, than all\r\nthe gentlemen within twenty miles of us came in a body, as it were, to\r\nset my lady at liberty, and to protest against her confinement, which\r\nthey now for the first time understood was against her own consent.\r\nThe ladies too were as attentive as possible, striving who should be\r\nforemost with their morning visits; and they that saw the diamonds spoke\r\nvery handsomely of them, but thought it a pity they were not bestowed,\r\nif it had so pleased God, upon a lady who would have become them better.\r\nAll these civilities wrought little with my lady, for she had taken an\r\nunaccountable prejudice against the country, and everything belonging to\r\nit, and was so partial to her native land, that after parting with the\r\ncook, which she did immediately upon my master\xe2\x80\x99s decease, I never knew\r\nher easy one instant, night or day, but when she was packing up to leave\r\nus. Had she meant to make any stay in Ireland, I stood a great chance\r\nof being a great favourite with her; for when she found I understood the\r\nweathercock, she was always finding some pretence to be talking to me,\r\nand asking me which way the wind blew, and was it likely, did I think,\r\nto continue fair for England. But when I saw she had made up her mind to\r\nspend the rest of her days upon her own income and jewels in England, I\r\nconsidered her quite as a foreigner, and not at all any longer as part\r\nof the family. She gave no vails to the servants at Castle Rackrent at\r\nparting, notwithstanding the old proverb of \xe2\x80\x98as rich as a Jew,\xe2\x80\x99 which\r\nshe, being a Jewish, they built upon with reason. But from first to last\r\nshe brought nothing but misfortunes amongst us; and if it had not been\r\nall along with her, his honour, Sir Kit, would have been now alive in\r\nall appearance. Her diamond cross was, they say, at the bottom of it\r\nall; and it was a shame for her, being his wife, not to show more duty,\r\nand to have given it up when he condescended to ask so often for such a\r\nbit of a trifle in his distresses, especially when he all along made it\r\nno secret he married for money. But we will not bestow another thought\r\nupon her. This much I thought it lay upon my conscience to say, in\r\njustice to my poor master\xe2\x80\x99s memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tis an ill wind that blows nobody no good: the same wind that took the\r\nJew Lady Rackrent over to England brought over the new heir to Castle\r\nRackrent.\r\n\r\nHere let me pause for breath in my story, for though I had a great\r\nregard for every member of the family, yet without compare Sir Conolly,\r\ncommonly called, for short, amongst his friends, Sir Condy Rackrent, was\r\never my great favourite, and, indeed, the most universally beloved man I\r\nhad ever seen or heard of, not excepting his great ancestor Sir Patrick,\r\nto whose memory he, amongst other instances of generosity, erected a\r\nhandsome marble stone in the church of Castle Rackrent, setting forth\r\nin large letters his age, birth, parentage, and many other virtues,\r\nconcluding with the compliment so justly due, that \xe2\x80\x98Sir Patrick Rackrent\r\nlived and died a monument of old Irish hospitality.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUATION OF THE MEMOIRS OF THE RACKRENT FAMILY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF SIR CONOLLY RACKRENT\r\n\r\nSir Condy Rackrent, by the grace of God heir-at-law to the Castle\r\nRackrent estate, was a remote branch of the family. Born to little or\r\nno fortune of his own, he was bred to the bar, at which, having many\r\nfriends to push him and no mean natural abilities of his own, he\r\ndoubtless would in process of time, if he could have borne the drudgery\r\nof that study, have been rapidly made King\xe2\x80\x99s Counsel at the least; but\r\nthings were disposed of otherwise, and he never went the circuit but\r\ntwice, and then made no figure for want of a fee, and being unable to\r\nspeak in public. He received his education chiefly in the college of\r\nDublin, but before he came to years of discretion lived in the country,\r\nin a small but slated house within view of the end of the avenue. I\r\nremember him, bare footed and headed, running through the street of\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Shaughlin\xe2\x80\x99s Town, and playing at pitch-and-toss, ball, marbles, and\r\nwhat not, with the boys of the town, amongst whom my son Jason was a\r\ngreat favourite with him. As for me, he was ever my white-headed boy:\r\noften\xe2\x80\x99s the time, when I would call in at his father\xe2\x80\x99s, where I was\r\nalways made welcome, he would slip down to me in the kitchen, and, love\r\nto sit on my knee whilst I told him stories of the family and the blood\r\nfrom which he was sprung, and how he might look forward, if the then\r\npresent man should die without childer, to being at the head of the\r\nCastle Rackrent estate. This was then spoke quite and clear at random\r\nto please the child, but it pleased Heaven to accomplish my prophecy\r\nafterwards, which gave him a great opinion of my judgment in business.\r\nHe went to a little grammar-school with many others, and my son amongst\r\nthe rest, who was in his class, and not a little useful to him in his\r\nbook-learning, which he acknowledged with gratitude ever after. These\r\nrudiments of his education thus completed, he got a-horseback, to which\r\nexercise he was ever addicted, and used to gallop over the country while\r\nyet but a slip of a boy, under the care of Sir Kit\xe2\x80\x99s huntsman, who\r\nwas very fond of him, and often lent him his gun, and took him out\r\na-shooting under his own eye. By these means he became well acquainted\r\nand popular amongst the poor in the neighbourhood early, for there was\r\nnot a cabin at which he had not stopped some morning or other, along\r\nwith the huntsman, to drink a glass of burnt whisky out of an eggshell,\r\nto do him good and warm his heart and drive the cold out of his stomach.\r\nThe old people always told him he was a great likeness of Sir Patrick,\r\nwhich made him first have an ambition to take after him, as far as his\r\nfortune should allow. He left us when of an age to enter the college,\r\nand there completed his education and nineteenth year, for as he was not\r\nborn to an estate, his friends thought it incumbent on them to give him\r\nthe best education which could be had for love or money, and a great\r\ndeal of money consequently was spent upon him at College and Temple.\r\nHe was a very little altered for the worse by what he saw there of the\r\ngreat world, for when he came down into the country to pay us a visit,\r\nwe thought him just the same man as ever--hand and glove with every one,\r\nand as far from high, though not without his own proper share of family\r\npride, as any man ever you see. Latterly, seeing how Sir Kit and the\r\nJewish lived together, and that there was no one between him and the\r\nCastle Rackrent estate, he neglected to apply to the law as much as was\r\nexpected of him, and secretly many of the tenants and others advanced\r\nhim cash upon his note of hand value received, promising bargains of\r\nleases and lawful interest, should he ever come into the estate. All\r\nthis was kept a great secret for fear the present man, hearing of it,\r\nshould take it into his head to take it ill of poor Condy, and so should\r\ncut him off for ever by levying a fine, and suffering a recovery to dock\r\nthe entail.[24] Sir Murtagh would have been the man for\r\nthat; but Sir Kit was too much taken up philandering to consider the law\r\nin this case, or any other. These practices I have mentioned to account\r\nfor the state of his affairs--I mean Sir Condy\xe2\x80\x99s upon his coming into\r\nthe Castle Rackrent estate. He could not command a penny of his first\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s income, which, and keeping no accounts, and the great sight of\r\ncompany he did, with many other causes too numerous to mention, was the\r\norigin of his distresses. My son Jason, who was now established agent,\r\nand knew everything, explained matters out of the face to Sir Conolly,\r\nand made him sensible of his embarrassed situation. With a great nominal\r\nrent-roll, it was almost all paid away in interest; which being for\r\nconvenience suffered to run on, soon doubled the principal, and\r\nSir Condy was obliged to pass new bonds for the interest, now grown\r\nprincipal, and so on. Whilst this was going on, my son requiring to be\r\npaid for his trouble and many years\xe2\x80\x99 service in the family gratis, and\r\nSir Condy not willing to take his affairs into his own hands, or to look\r\nthem even in the face, he gave my son a bargain of some acres which fell\r\nout of lease at a reasonable rent. Jason set the land, as soon as\r\nhis lease was sealed, to under-tenants, to make the rent, and got two\r\nhundred a year profit rent; which was little enough considering his\r\nlong agency. He bought the land at twelve years\xe2\x80\x99 purchase two years\r\nafterwards, when Sir Condy was pushed for money on an execution, and was\r\nat the same time allowed for his improvements thereon. There was a sort\r\nof hunting-lodge upon the estate, convenient to my son Jason\xe2\x80\x99s land,\r\nwhich he had his eye upon about this time; and he was a little jealous\r\nof Sir Condy, who talked of setting it to a stranger who was just come\r\ninto the country--Captain Moneygawl was the man. He was son and heir\r\nto the Moneygawls of Mount Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town, who had a great estate in\r\nthe next county to ours; and my master was loth to disoblige the young\r\ngentleman, whose heart was set upon the Lodge; so he wrote him back\r\nthat the Lodge was at his service, and if he would honour him with his\r\ncompany at Castle Rackrent, they could ride over together some morning\r\nand look at it before signing the lease. Accordingly, the captain came\r\nover to us, and he and Sir Condy grew the greatest friends ever you\r\nsee, and were for ever out a-shooting or hunting together, and were\r\nvery merry in the evenings; and Sir Condy was invited of course to Mount\r\nJuliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town; and the family intimacy that had been in Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime was now recollected, and nothing would serve Sir Condy but he must\r\nbe three times a week at the least with his new friends, which grieved\r\nme, who knew, by the captain\xe2\x80\x99s groom and gentleman, how they talked\r\nof him at Mount Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town, making him quite, as one may say, a\r\nlaughing-stock and a butt for the whole company; but they were soon\r\ncured of that by an accident that surprised \xe2\x80\x98em not a little, as it did\r\nme. There was a bit of a scrawl found upon the waiting-maid of old Mr.\r\nMoneygawl\xe2\x80\x99s youngest daughter, Miss Isabella, that laid open the whole;\r\nand her father, they say, was like one out of his right mind, and swore\r\nit was the last thing he ever should have thought of, when he invited my\r\nmaster to his house, that his daughter should think of such a match. But\r\ntheir talk signified not a straw, for as Miss Isabella\xe2\x80\x99s maid reported,\r\nher young mistress was fallen over head and ears in love with Sir Condy\r\nfrom the first time that ever her brother brought him into the house to\r\ndinner. The servant who waited that day behind my master\xe2\x80\x99s chair was the\r\nfirst who knew it, as he says; though it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe him, for he\r\ndid not tell it till a great while afterwards; but, however, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely\r\nenough, as the thing turned out, that he was not far out of the way,\r\nfor towards the middle of dinner, as he says, they were talking of\r\nstage-plays, having a playhouse, and being great play-actors at Mount\r\nJuliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town; and Miss Isabella turns short to my master, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you seen the play-bill, Sir Condy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I have not,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then more shame for you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the captain her brother, \xe2\x80\x98not to know\r\nthat my sister is to play Juliet to-night, who plays it better than any\r\nwoman on or off the stage in all Ireland.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very happy to hear it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Condy; and there the matter\r\ndropped for the present.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Condy all this time, and a great while afterwards, was at a\r\nterrible nonplus; for he had no liking, not he, to stage-plays, nor\r\nto Miss Isabella either--to his mind, as it came out over a bowl of\r\nwhisky-punch at home, his little Judy M\xe2\x80\x99Quirk, who was daughter to a\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s son of mine, was worth twenty of Miss Isabella. He had seen her\r\noften when he stopped at her father\xe2\x80\x99s cabin to drink whisky out of the\r\neggshell, out hunting, before he came to the estate, and, as she gave\r\nout, was under something like a promise of marriage to her. Anyhow, I\r\ncould not but pity my poor master, who was so bothered between them, and\r\nhe an easy-hearted man, that could not disoblige nobody--God bless him!\r\nTo be sure, it was not his place to behave ungenerous to Miss Isabella,\r\nwho had disobliged all her relations for his sake, as he remarked; and\r\nthen she was locked up in her chamber, and forbid to think of him any\r\nmore, which raised his spirit, because his family was, as he observed,\r\nas good as theirs at any rate, and the Rackrents a suitable match for\r\nthe Moneygawls any day in the year; all which was true enough. But it\r\ngrieved me to see that, upon the strength of all this, Sir Condy was\r\ngrowing more in the mind to carry off Miss Isabella to Scotland, in\r\nspite of her relations, as she desired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all over with our poor Judy!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, with a heavy sigh, making\r\nbold to speak to him one night when he was a little cheerful, and\r\nstanding in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall all alone with me as was often his\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98I never was fonder of Judy than at this present\r\nspeaking; and to prove it to you,\xe2\x80\x99 said he--and he took from my hand\r\na halfpenny change that I had just got along with my tobacco--\xe2\x80\x98and to\r\nprove it to you, Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a toss-up with me which I\r\nshould marry this minute, her or Mr. Moneygawl of Mount Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter--so it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOh-boo! boo!\xe2\x80\x99{9} says I, making light of it, to see what he would go on\r\nto next; \xe2\x80\x98your honour\xe2\x80\x99s joking, to be sure; there\xe2\x80\x99s no compare between\r\nour poor Judy and Miss Isabella, who has a great fortune, they say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   {9} Boo! Boo!--an exclamation equivalent to PSHAW or NONSENSE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not a man to mind a fortune, nor never was,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Condy,\r\nproudly, \xe2\x80\x98whatever her friends may say; and to make short of it,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m come to a determination upon the spot.\xe2\x80\x99 With that he swore\r\nsuch a terrible oath as made me cross myself. \xe2\x80\x98And by this book,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe, snatching up my ballad-book, mistaking it for my prayer-book, which\r\nlay in the window,--\xe2\x80\x98and by this book,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98and by all the books\r\nthat ever were shut and opened, it\xe2\x80\x99s come to a toss-up with me, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll stand or fall by the toss; and so Thady, hand me over that pin{10}\r\nout of the ink-horn;\xe2\x80\x99 and he makes a cross on the smooth side of the\r\nhalfpenny; \xe2\x80\x98Judy M\xe2\x80\x99Quirk,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98her mark.\xe2\x80\x99{11}\r\n\r\n   {10} PIN, read PEN.--It formerly was vulgarly pronounced PIN in\r\n   Ireland.\r\n\r\n   {11} HER MARK.--It was the custom in Ireland for those who could not\r\n   write to make a cross to stand for their signature, as was formerly\r\n   the practice of our English monarchs. The Editor inserts the\r\n   facsimile of an Irish mark, which may hereafter be valuable to a\r\n   judicious antiquary--\r\n\r\n          Her\r\n          Judy X M\xe2\x80\x99Quirk,\r\n          Mark.\r\n\r\n     In bonds or notes signed in this manner a witness is requisite, as\r\n     the name is frequently written by him or her.\r\n\r\nGod bless him! his hand was a little unsteadied by all the whisky-punch\r\nhe had taken, but it was plain to see his heart was for poor Judy. My\r\nheart was all as one as in my mouth when I saw the halfpenny up in the\r\nair, but I said nothing at all; and when it came down I was glad I had\r\nkept myself to myself, for to be sure now it was all over with poor\r\nJudy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Judy\xe2\x80\x99s out a luck,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, striving to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m out a luck,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; and I never saw a man look so cast down: he\r\ntook up the halfpenny off the flag, and walked away quite sober-like by\r\nthe shock. Now, though as easy a man, you would think, as any in the\r\nwide world, there was no such thing as making him unsay one of these\r\nsort of vows,{12} which he had learned to reverence when young, as I\r\nwell remember teaching him to toss up for bog-berries on my knee. So I\r\nsaw the affair was as good as settled between him and Miss Isabella,\r\nand I had no more to say but to wish her joy, which I did the week\r\nafterwards, upon her return from Scotland with my poor master.\r\n\r\n   {12} VOWS.--It has been maliciously and unjustly hinted that the\r\n   lower classes of the people of Ireland pay but little regard to\r\n   oaths; yet it is certain that some oaths or vows have great power\r\n   over their minds. Sometimes they swear they will be revenged on some\r\n   of their neighbours; this is an oath that they are never known to\r\n   break. But, what is infinitely more extraordinary and unaccountable,\r\n   they sometimes make and keep a vow against whisky; these vows are\r\n   usually limited to a short time. A woman who has a drunken husband\r\n   is most fortunate if she can prevail upon him to go to the priest,\r\n   and make a vow against whisky for a year, or a month, or a week, or\r\n   a day.\r\n\r\nMy new lady was young, as might be supposed of a lady that had been\r\ncarried off by her own consent to Scotland; but I could only see her\r\nat first through her veil, which, from bashfulness or fashion, she kept\r\nover her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And am I to walk through all this crowd of people, my dearest love?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid she to Sir Condy, meaning us servants and tenants, who had gathered\r\nat the back gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Condy, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing for it but to walk, or to\r\nlet me carry you as far as the house, for you see the back road is too\r\nnarrow for a carriage, and the great piers have tumbled down across the\r\nfront approach; so there\xe2\x80\x99s no driving the right way, by reason of the\r\nruins.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Plato, thou reasonest well!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, or words to that effect, which\r\nI could noways understand; and again, when her foot stumbled against a\r\nbroken bit of a car-wheel, she cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Angels and ministers of grace\r\ndefend us!\xe2\x80\x99 Well, thought I, to be sure, if she\xe2\x80\x99s no Jewish, like the\r\nlast, she is a mad woman for certain, which is as bad: it would have\r\nbeen as well for my poor master to have taken up with poor Judy, who is\r\nin her right mind anyhow.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed like a mad woman, moreover, more than like any one I\r\never saw afore or since, and I could not take my eyes off her, but still\r\nfollowed behind her; and her feathers on the top of her hat were broke\r\ngoing in at the low back door and she pulled out her little bottle out\r\nof her pocket to smell when she found herself in the kitchen, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall faint with the heat of this odious, odious place.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s only three steps across the kitchen, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a fine\r\nair if your veil was up,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Condy; and with that threw back her\r\nveil, so that I had then a full sight of her face. She had not at all\r\nthe colour of one going to faint, but a fine complexion of her own, as I\r\nthen took it to be, though her maid told me after it was all put on;\r\nbut even, complexion and all taken in, she was no way, in point of good\r\nlooks, to compare to poor Judy, and withal she had a quality toss with\r\nher; but maybe it was my over-partiality to Judy, into whose place I may\r\nsay she stepped, that made me notice all this.\r\n\r\nTo do her justice, however, she was, when we came to know her better,\r\nvery liberal in her housekeeping--nothing at all of the skinflint in\r\nher; she left everything to the housekeeper, and her own maid, Mrs.\r\nJane, who went with her to Scotland, gave her the best of characters\r\nfor generosity. She seldom or ever wore a thing twice the same way, Mrs.\r\nJane told us, and was always pulling her things to pieces and giving\r\nthem away, never being used, in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house, to think of expense\r\nin anything; and she reckoned to be sure to go on the same way at Castle\r\nRackrent; but when I came to inquire, I learned that her father was so\r\nmad with her for running off, after his locking her up and forbidding\r\nher to think any more of Sir Condy, that he would not give her a\r\nfarthing; and it was lucky for her she had a few thousands of her own,\r\nwhich had been left to her by a good grandmother, and these were very\r\nconvenient to begin with. My master and my lady set out in great style;\r\nthey had the finest coach and chariot, and horses and liveries, and cut\r\nthe greatest dash in the county, returning their wedding visits; and it\r\nwas immediately reported that her father had undertaken to pay all my\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s debts, and of course all his tradesmen gave him a new credit,\r\nand everything went on smack smooth, and I could not but admire my\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s spirit, and was proud to see Castle Rackrent again in all\r\nits glory. My lady had a fine taste for building, and furniture,\r\nand playhouses, and she turned everything topsy-turvy, and made the\r\nbarrack-room into a theatre, as she called it, and she went on as if\r\nshe had a mint of money at her elbow; and to be sure I thought she knew\r\nbest, especially as Sir Condy said nothing to it one way or the other.\r\nAll he asked--God bless him!--was to live in peace and quietness, and\r\nhave his bottle or his whisky-punch at night to himself. Now this was\r\nlittle enough, to be sure, for any gentleman; but my lady couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abide\r\nthe smell of the whisky-punch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98you liked it well enough before we were married,\r\nand why not now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98I never smelt it, or I assure you I should never\r\nhave prevailed upon myself to marry you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, I am sorry you did not smell it, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t help that now,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreturned my master, without putting himself in a passion, or going out\r\nof his way, but just fair and easy helped himself to another glass, and\r\ndrank it off to her good health.\r\n\r\nAll this the butler told me, who was going backwards and forwards\r\nunnoticed with the jug, and hot water, and sugar, and all he thought\r\nwanting. Upon my master\xe2\x80\x99s swallowing the last glass of whisky-punch\r\nmy lady burst into tears, calling him an ungrateful, base, barbarous\r\nwretch; and went off into a fit of hysterics, as I think Mrs. Jane\r\ncalled it, and my poor master was greatly frightened, this being the\r\nfirst thing of the kind he had seen; and he fell straight on his knees\r\nbefore her, and, like a good-hearted cratur as he was, ordered the\r\nwhisky-punch out of the room, and bid \xe2\x80\x98em throw open all the windows,\r\nand cursed himself: and then my lady came to herself again, and when\r\nshe saw him kneeling there, bid him get up, and not forswear himself any\r\nmore, for that she was sure he did not love her, and never had. This\r\nwe learned from Mrs. Jane, who was the only person left present at all\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returns my master, thinking, to be sure, of Judy, as well he\r\nmight, \xe2\x80\x98whoever told you so is an incendiary, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have \xe2\x80\x98em turned\r\nout of the house this minute, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only let me know which of them\r\nit was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Told me what?\xe2\x80\x99 said my lady, starting upright in her chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing at all, nothing at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said my master, seeing he had overshot\r\nhimself, and that my lady spoke at random; \xe2\x80\x98but what you said just now,\r\nthat I did not love you, Bella; who told you that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My own sense,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and she put her handkerchief to her face, and\r\nleant back upon Mrs. Jane, and fell to sobbing as if her heart would\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why now, Bella, this is very strange of you,\xe2\x80\x99 said my poor master; \xe2\x80\x98if\r\nnobody has told you nothing, what is it you are taking on for at this\r\nrate, and exposing yourself and me for this way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, say no more, say no more; every word you say kills me,\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nmy lady; and she ran on like one, as Mrs. Jane says, raving, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Sir\r\nCondy, Sir Condy! I that had hoped to find in you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why now, faith, this is a little too much; do, Bella, try to recollect\r\nyourself, my dear; am not I your husband, and of your own choosing, and\r\nis not that enough?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, too much! too much!\xe2\x80\x99 cried my lady, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, my dear, come to your right senses, for the love of heaven. See,\r\nis not the whisky-punch, jug and bowl and all, gone out of the room long\r\nago? What is it, in the wide world, you have to complain of?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut still my lady sobbed and sobbed, and called herself the most\r\nwretched of women; and among other out-of-the-way provoking things,\r\nasked my master, was he fit company for her, and he drinking all night?\r\nThis nettling him, which it was hard to do, he replied, that as to\r\ndrinking all night, he was then as sober as she was herself, and that\r\nit was no matter how much a man drank, provided it did noways affect or\r\nstagger him: that as to being fit company for her, he thought himself of\r\na family to be fit company for any lord or lady in the land; but that\r\nhe never prevented her from seeing and keeping what company she pleased,\r\nand that he had done his best to make Castle Rackrent pleasing to her\r\nsince her marriage, having always had the house full of visitors, and\r\nif her own relations were not amongst them, he said that was their\r\nown fault, and their pride\xe2\x80\x99s fault, of which he was sorry to find her\r\nladyship had so unbecoming a share. So concluding, he took his candle\r\nand walked off to his room, and my lady was in her tantarums for three\r\ndays after; and would have been so much longer, no doubt, but some of\r\nher friends, young ladies, and cousins, and second cousins, came to\r\nCastle Rackrent, by my poor master\xe2\x80\x99s express invitation, to see her, and\r\nshe was in a hurry to get up, as Mrs. Jane called it, a play for them,\r\nand so got well, and was as finely dressed, and as happy to look at, as\r\never; and all the young ladies, who used to be in her room dressing of\r\nher, said in Mrs. Jane\xe2\x80\x99s hearing that my lady was the happiest bride\r\never they had seen, and that to be sure a love-match was the only thing\r\nfor happiness, where the parties could any way afford it.\r\n\r\nAs to affording it, God knows it was little they knew of the matter;\r\nmy lady\xe2\x80\x99s few thousands could not last for ever, especially the way she\r\nwent on with them; and letters from tradesfolk came every post thick and\r\nthreefold, with bills as long as my arm, of years\xe2\x80\x99 and years\xe2\x80\x99 standing.\r\nMy son Jason had \xe2\x80\x98em all handed over to him, and the pressing letters\r\nwere all unread by Sir Condy, who hated trouble, and could never be\r\nbrought to hear talk of business, but still put it off and put it off,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98Settle it anyhow,\xe2\x80\x99 or, \xe2\x80\x98Bid \xe2\x80\x98em call again to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 or,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Speak to me about it some other time.\xe2\x80\x99 Now it was hard to find the\r\nright time to speak, for in the mornings he was a-bed, and in the\r\nevenings over his bottle, where no gentleman chooses to be disturbed.\r\nThings in a twelvemonth or so came to such a pass there was no making a\r\nshift to go on any longer, though we were all of us well enough used to\r\nlive from hand to mouth at Castle Rackrent. One day, I remember, when\r\nthere was a power of company, all sitting after dinner in the dusk, not\r\nto say dark, in the drawing-room, my lady having rung five times for\r\ncandles, and none to go up, the housekeeper sent up the footman, who\r\nwent to my mistress, and whispered behind her chair how it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My lady,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98there are no candles in the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless me,\xe2\x80\x99 says she; \xe2\x80\x98then take a horse and gallop off as fast as you\r\ncan to Carrick O\xe2\x80\x99Fungus, and get some.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And in the meantime tell them to step into the playhouse, and try if\r\nthere are not some bits left,\xe2\x80\x99 added Sir Condy, who happened, to be\r\nwithin hearing. The man was sent up again to my lady, to let her know\r\nthere was no horse to go, but one that wanted a shoe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go to Sir Condy then; I know nothing at all about the horses,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nmy lady; \xe2\x80\x98why do you plague me with these things?\xe2\x80\x99 How it was settled I\r\nreally forget, but to the best of my remembrance, the boy was sent down\r\nto my son Jason\xe2\x80\x99s to borrow candles for the night. Another time, in\r\nthe winter, and on a desperate cold day, there was no turf in for the\r\nparlour and above stairs, and scarce enough for the cook in the kitchen.\r\nThe little GOSSOON{13} was sent off to the neighbours, to see and beg or\r\nborrow some, but none could he bring back with him for love or money;\r\nso, as needs must,\r\nwe were forced to trouble Sir Condy--\xe2\x80\x98Well, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s no turf to be\r\nhad in the town or country, why, what signifies talking any more about\r\nit; can\xe2\x80\x99t ye go and cut down a tree?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   {13} GOSSOON: a little boy--from the French word _gar\xc3\xa7on_. In most\r\n   Irish families there used to be a barefooted gossoon, who was slave\r\n   to the cook and the butler, and who, in fact, without wages, did all\r\n   the hard work of the house. Gossoons were always employed as\r\n   messengers. The Editor has known a gossoon to go on foot, without\r\n   shoes or stockings, fifty-one English miles between sunrise and\r\n   sunset.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which tree, please your honour?\xe2\x80\x99 I made bold to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any tree at all that\xe2\x80\x99s good to burn,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Condy; \xe2\x80\x98send off smart\r\nand get one down, and the fires lighted, before my lady gets up to\r\nbreakfast, or the house will be too hot to hold us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was always very considerate in all things about my lady, and she\r\nwanted for nothing whilst he had it to give. Well, when things were\r\ntight with them about this time, my son Jason put in a word again about\r\nthe Lodge, and made a genteel offer to lay down the purchase-money,\r\nto relieve Sir Condy\xe2\x80\x99s distresses. Now Sir Condy had it from the best\r\nauthority that there were two writs come down to the sheriff against\r\nhis person, and the sheriff, as ill-luck would have it, was no friend of\r\nhis, and talked how he must do his duty, and how he would do it, if it\r\nwas against the first man in the country, or even his own brother, let\r\nalone one who had voted against him at the last election, as Sir Condy\r\nhad done. So Sir Condy was fain to take the purchase-money of the Lodge\r\nfrom my son Jason to settle matters; and sure enough it was a good\r\nbargain for both parties, for my son bought the fee-simple of a good\r\nhouse for him and his heirs for ever, for little or nothing, and by\r\nselling of it for that same my master saved himself from a gaol. Every\r\nway it turned out fortunate for Sir Condy, for before the money was all\r\ngone there came a general election, and he being so well beloved in the\r\ncounty, and one of the oldest families, no one had a better right to\r\nstand candidate for the vacancy; and he was called upon by all his\r\nfriends, and the whole county I may say, to declare himself against\r\nthe old member, who had little thought of a contest. My master did not\r\nrelish the thoughts of a troublesome canvass, and all the ill-will he\r\nmight bring upon himself by disturbing the peace of the county, besides\r\nthe expense, which was no trifle; but all his friends called upon one\r\nanother to subscribe, and they formed themselves into a committee, and\r\nwrote all his circular letters for him, and engaged all his agents, and\r\ndid all the business unknown to him; and he was well pleased that it\r\nshould be so at last, and my lady herself was very sanguine about\r\nthe election; and there was open house kept night and day at Castle\r\nRackrent, and I thought I never saw my lady look so well in her life as\r\nshe did at that time. There were grand dinners, and all the gentlemen\r\ndrinking success to Sir Condy till they were carried off; and then\r\ndances and balls, and the ladies all finishing with a raking pot of tea\r\nin the morning.[25] Indeed, it was well the company made\r\nit their choice to sit up all nights, for there were not half beds\r\nenough for the sights of people that were in it, though there were\r\nshake-downs in the drawing-room always made up before sunrise for those\r\nthat liked it. For my part, when I saw the doings that were going on,\r\nand the loads of claret that went down the throats of them that had no\r\nright to be asking for it, and the sights of meat that went up to table\r\nand never came down, besides what was carried off to one or t\xe2\x80\x99other\r\nbelow stair, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t but pity my poor master, who was to pay for\r\nall; but I said nothing, for fear of gaining myself ill-will. The day of\r\nelection will come some time or other, says I to myself, and all will\r\nbe over; and so it did, and a glorious day it was as any I ever had the\r\nhappiness to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Huzza! huzza! Sir Condy Rackrent for ever!\xe2\x80\x99 was the first thing I\r\nhears in the morning, and the same and nothing else all day, and not a\r\nsoul sober only just when polling, enough to give their votes as became\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em, and to stand the browbeating of the lawyers, who came tight enough\r\nupon us; and many of our freeholders were knocked off; having never a\r\nfreehold that they could safely swear to, and Sir Condy was not willing\r\nto have any man perjure himself for his sake, as was done on the other\r\nside, God knows; but no matter for that. Some of our friends were\r\ndumbfounded by the lawyers asking them: Had they ever been upon the\r\nground where their freeholds lay? Now, Sir Condy being tender of the\r\nconsciences of them that had not been on the ground, and so could not\r\nswear to a freehold when cross-examined by them lawyers, sent out for a\r\ncouple of cleavesful of the sods of his farm of Gulteeshinnagh;{14} and\r\nas soon as the sods came into town, he set each man upon his sod, and\r\nso then, ever after, you know, they could fairly swear they had been\r\nupon the ground.{15} We gained the day by this piece of honesty.[26] I\r\nthought I should have died in the streets for joy when I seed my poor\r\nmaster chaired, and he bareheaded, and it raining as hard as it could\r\npour; but all the crowds following him up and down, and he bowing and\r\nshaking hands with the whole town.\r\n\r\n   {14} At St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, London, March 1806, the Duke of\r\n   Sussex said he had the honour of bearing an Irish title, and, with\r\n   the permission of the company, he should tell them an anecdote of\r\n   what he had experienced on his travels. When he was at Rome he went\r\n   to visit an Irish seminary, and when they heard who it was, and that\r\n   he had an Irish title, some of them asked him, \xe2\x80\x98Please your Royal\r\n   Highness, since you are an Irish peer, will you tell us if you ever\r\n   trod upon Irish ground?\xe2\x80\x99 When he told them he had not, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, then,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n   said one of the Order, \xe2\x80\x98you shall soon do so.\xe2\x80\x99 They then spread some\r\n   earth, which had been brought from Ireland, on a marble slab, and\r\n   made him stand upon it.\r\n\r\n   {15} This was actually done at an election in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that Sir Condy Rackrent in the chair?\xe2\x80\x99 says a stranger man in the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The same,\xe2\x80\x99 says I. \xe2\x80\x98Who else should it be? God bless him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I take it, then, you belong to him?\xe2\x80\x99 says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98but I live under him, and have done so these two\r\nhundred years and upwards, me and mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s lucky for you, then,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoins he, \xe2\x80\x98that he is where he is; for\r\nwas he anywhere else but in the chair, this minute he\xe2\x80\x99d be in a worse\r\nplace; for I was sent down on purpose to put him up,{16} and here\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\norder for so doing in my pocket.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   {16} TO PUT HIM UP: to put him in gaol\r\n\r\nIt was a writ that villain the wine merchant had marked against my poor\r\nmaster for some hundreds of an old debt, which it was a shame to be\r\ntalking of at such a time as this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Put it in your pocket again, and think no more of it anyways for seven\r\nyears to come, my honest friend,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s a member of Parliament\r\nnow, praised be God, and such as you can\xe2\x80\x99t touch him: and if you\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\na fool\xe2\x80\x99s advice, I\xe2\x80\x99d have you keep out of the way this day, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nrun a good chance of getting your deserts amongst my master\xe2\x80\x99s friends,\r\nunless you choose to drink his health like everybody else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve no objection to that in life,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. So we went into one of the\r\npublic-houses kept open for my master; and we had a great deal of talk\r\nabout this thing and that. \xe2\x80\x98And how is it,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98your master keeps\r\non so well upon his legs? I heard say he was off Holantide twelvemonth\r\npast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never was better or heartier in his life,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not that I\xe2\x80\x99m after speaking of\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98but there was a great\r\nreport of his being ruined.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No matter,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98the sheriffs two years running were his particular\r\nfriends, and the sub-sheriffs were both of them gentlemen, and were\r\nproperly spoken to; and so the writs lay snug with them, and they, as\r\nI understand by my son Jason the custom in them cases is, returned the\r\nwrits as they came to them to those that sent \xe2\x80\x98em much good may it do\r\nthem!--with a word in Latin, that no such person as Sir Condy Rackrent,\r\nBart., was to be found in those parts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I understand all those ways better--no offence--than you,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nhe, laughing, and at the same time filling his glass to my master\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nhealth, which convinced me he was a warm friend in his heart after\r\nall, though appearances were a little suspicious or so at first. \xe2\x80\x98To\r\nbe sure,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, still cutting his joke, \xe2\x80\x98when a man\xe2\x80\x99s over head and\r\nshoulders in debt, he may live the faster for it, and the better if he\r\ngoes the right way about it; or else how is it so many live on so well,\r\nas we see every day, after they are ruined?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is it,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, being a little merry at the time--\xe2\x80\x98how is it but\r\njust as you see the ducks in the chicken-yard, just after their heads\r\nare cut off by the cook, running round and round faster than when\r\nalive?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt which conceit he fell a-laughing, and remarked he had never had the\r\nhappiness yet to see the chicken-yard at Castle Rackrent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It won\xe2\x80\x99t be long so, I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ll be kindly welcome\r\nthere, as everybody is made by my master: there is not a freer-spoken\r\ngentleman, or a better beloved, high or low, in all Ireland.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd of what passed after this I\xe2\x80\x99m not sensible, for we drank Sir\r\nCandy\xe2\x80\x99s good health and the downfall of his enemies till we could stand\r\nno longer ourselves. And little did I think at the time, or till long\r\nafter, how I was harbouring my poor master\xe2\x80\x99s greatest of enemies\r\nmyself. This fellow had the impudence, after coming to see the\r\nchicken-yard, to get me to introduce him to my son Jason; little more\r\nthan the man that never was born did I guess at his meaning by this\r\nvisit: he gets him a correct list fairly drawn out from my son Jason of\r\nall my master\xe2\x80\x99s debts, and goes straight round to the creditors and\r\nbuys them all up, which he did easy enough, seeing the half of them\r\nnever expected to see their money out of Sir Condy\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Then, when\r\nthis base-minded limb of the law, as I afterwards detected him in\r\nbeing, grew to be sole creditor over all, he takes him out a custodiam\r\non all the denominations and sub-denominations, and even carton and\r\nhalf-carton[27] upon the estate; and not content with that, must have\r\nan execution against the master\xe2\x80\x99s goods and down to the furniture,\r\nthough little worth, of Castle Rackrent itself. But this is a part of\r\nmy story I\xe2\x80\x99m not come to yet, and it\xe2\x80\x99s bad to be forestalling: ill news\r\nflies fast enough all the world over.\r\n\r\nTo go back to the day of the election, which I never think of but with\r\npleasure and tears of gratitude for those good times: after the\r\nelection was quite and clean over, there comes shoals of people from\r\nall parts, claiming to have obliged my master with their votes, and\r\nputting him in mind of promises which he could never remember himself\r\nto have made: one was to have a freehold for each of his four sons;\r\nanother was to have a renewal of a lease; another an abatement; one\r\ncame to be paid ten guineas for a pair of silver buckles sold my master\r\non the hustings, which turned out to be no better than copper gilt;\r\nanother had a long bill for oats, the half of which never went into the\r\ngranary to my certain knowledge, and the other half was not fit for the\r\ncattle to touch; but the bargain was made the week before the election,\r\nand the coach and saddle-horses were got into order for the day,\r\nbesides a vote fairly got by them oats; so no more reasoning on that\r\nhead. But then there was no end to them that were telling Sir Condy he\r\nhad engaged to make their sons excisemen, or high constables, or the\r\nlike; and as for them that had bills to give in for liquor, and beds,\r\nand straw, and ribands, and horses, and post-chaises for the gentlemen\r\nfreeholders that came from all parts and other counties to vote for my\r\nmaster, and were not, to be sure, to be at any charges, there was no\r\nstanding against all these; and, worse than all, the gentlemen of my\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s committee, who managed all for him, and talked how they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbring him in without costing him a penny, and subscribed by hundreds\r\nvery genteelly, forgot to pay their subscriptions, and had laid out in\r\nagents\xe2\x80\x99 and lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 fees and secret service money to the Lord knows\r\nhow much; and my master could never ask one of them for their\r\nsubscription you are sensible, nor for the price of a fine horse he had\r\nsold one of them; so it all was left at his door. He could never, God\r\nbless him again! I say, bring himself to ask a gentleman for money,\r\ndespising such sort of conversation himself; but others, who were not\r\ngentlemen born, behaved very uncivil in pressing him at this very time,\r\nand all he could do to content \xe2\x80\x98em all was to take himself out of the\r\nway as fast as possible to Dublin, where my lady had taken a house\r\nfitting for him as a member of Parliament, to attend his duty in there\r\nall the winter. I was very lonely when the whole family was gone, and\r\nall the things they had ordered to go, and forgot, sent after them by\r\nthe car. There was then a great silence in Castle Rackrent, and I went\r\nmoping from room to room, hearing the doors clap for want of right\r\nlocks, and the wind through the broken windows, that the glazier never\r\nwould come to mend, and the rain coming through the roof and best\r\nceilings all over the house for want of the slater, whose bill was not\r\npaid, besides our having no slates or shingles for that part of the old\r\nbuilding which was shingled and burnt when the chimney took fire, and\r\nhad been open to the weather ever since. I took myself to the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhall in the evening to smoke my pipe as usual, but missed the bit of\r\ntalk we used to have there sadly, and ever after was content to stay in\r\nthe kitchen and boil my little potatoes,{17} and put up my bed there,\r\nand every post-day I looked in the newspaper, but no news of my master\r\nin the House; he never spoke good or bad, but, as the butler wrote down\r\nword to my son Jason, was very ill-used by the Government about a place\r\nthat was promised him and never given, after his supporting them\r\nagainst his conscience very honourably, and being greatly abused for\r\nit, which hurt him greatly, he having the name of a great patriot in\r\nthe country before. The house and living in Dublin too were not to be\r\nhad for nothing, and my son Jason said, \xe2\x80\x98Sir Condy must soon be looking\r\nout for a new agent, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my part, and can do no more. If my\r\nlady had the bank of Ireland to spend, it would go all in one winter,\r\nand Sir Condy would never gainsay her, though he does not care the rind\r\nof a lemon for her all the while.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   {17} MY LITTLE POTATOES.--Thady does not mean by this expression\r\n   that his potatoes were less than other people\xe2\x80\x99s, or less than the\r\n   usual size. LITTLE is here used only as an Italian diminutive,\r\n   expressive of fondness.\r\n\r\nNow I could not bear to hear Jason giving out after this manner against\r\nthe family, and twenty people standing by in the street. Ever since he\r\nhad lived at the Lodge of his own he looked down, howsomever, upon poor\r\nold Thady, and was grown quite a great gentleman, and had none of his\r\nrelations near him; no wonder he was no kinder to poor Sir Condy than\r\nto his own kith or kin.{18} In the spring it was the villain that got\r\nthe list of the debts from him brought down the custodiam, Sir Condy\r\nstill attending his duty in Parliament and I could scarcely believe my\r\nown old eyes, or the spectacles with which I read it, when I was shown\r\nmy son Jason\xe2\x80\x99s name joined in the custodiam; but he told me it was only\r\nfor form\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and to make things easier than if all the land was\r\nunder the power of a total stranger. Well, I did not know what to\r\nthink; it was hard to be talking ill of my own, and I could not but\r\ngrieve for my poor master\xe2\x80\x99s fine estate, all torn by these vultures of\r\nthe law; so I said nothing, but just looked on to see how it would all\r\nend.\r\n\r\n   {18} KITH AND KIN: family or relations. KIN from KIND; KITH from we\r\n   know not what.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the month of June that he and my lady came down to\r\nthe country. My master was pleased to take me aside with him to the\r\nbrewhouse that same evening, to complain to me of my son and other\r\nmatters, in which he said he was confident I had neither art nor part;\r\nhe said a great deal more to me, to whom he had been fond to talk ever\r\nsince he was my white-headed boy before he came to the estate; and all\r\nthat he said about poor Judy I can never forget, but scorn to repeat. He\r\ndid not say an unkind word of my lady, but wondered, as well he might,\r\nher relations would do nothing for him or her, and they in all this\r\ngreat distress. He did not take anything long to heart, let it be as it\r\nwould, and had no more malice or thought of the like in him than a child\r\nthat can\xe2\x80\x99t speak; this night it was all out of his head before he went\r\nto his bed. He took his jug of whisky-punch--my lady was grown quite\r\neasy about the whisky-punch by this time, and so I did suppose all was\r\ngoing on right betwixt them till I learnt the truth through Mrs. Jane,\r\nwho talked over the affairs to the housekeeper, and I within hearing.\r\nThe night my master came home, thinking of nothing at all but just\r\nmaking merry, he drank his bumper toast \xe2\x80\x98to the deserts of that old\r\ncurmudgeon my father-in-law, and all enemies at Mount Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nNow my lady was no longer in the mind she formerly was, and did noways\r\nrelish hearing her own friends abused in her presence, she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why don\xe2\x80\x99t they show themselves your friends\xe2\x80\x99 said my master, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\noblige me with the loan of the money I condescended, by your advice, my\r\ndear, to ask? It\xe2\x80\x99s now three posts since I sent off my letter, desiring\r\nin the postscript a speedy answer by the return of the post, and no\r\naccount at all from them yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I expect they\xe2\x80\x99ll write to ME next post,\xe2\x80\x99 says my lady, and that was\r\nall that passed then; but it was easy from this to guess there was a\r\ncoolness betwixt them, and with good cause.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, being post-day, I sent off the gossoon early to\r\nthe post-office, to see was there any letter likely to set matters to\r\nrights, and he brought back one with the proper postmark upon it, sure\r\nenough, and I had no time to examine or make any conjecture more about\r\nit, for into the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall pops Mrs. Jane with a blue bandbox in\r\nher hand, quite entirely mad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Matter enough,\xe2\x80\x99 says she; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t you see my bandbox is wet through,\r\nand my best bonnet here spoiled, besides my lady\xe2\x80\x99s, and all by the rain\r\ncoming in through that gallery window that you might have got mended if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d had any sense, Thady, all the time we were in town in the winter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure, I could not get the glazier, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You might have stopped it up anyhow,\xe2\x80\x99 says she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I, did, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, to the best of my ability; one of the panes with\r\nthe old pillow-case, and the other with a piece of the old stage green\r\ncurtain. Sure I was as careful as possible all the time you were away,\r\nand not a drop of rain came in at that window of all the windows in the\r\nhouse, all winter, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, when under my care; and now the family\xe2\x80\x99s come\r\nhome, and it\xe2\x80\x99s summer-time, I never thought no more about it, to be\r\nsure; but dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity to think of your bonnet, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. But here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat will please you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am--a letter from Mount Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town for my\r\nlady.\r\n\r\nWith that she snatches it from me without a word more, and runs up\r\nthe back stairs to my mistress; I follows with a slate to make up the\r\nwindow. This window was in the long passage, or gallery, as my lady\r\ngave out orders to have it called, in the gallery leading to my master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedchamber and hers. And when I went up with the slate, the door having\r\nno lock, and the bolt spoilt, was ajar after Mrs. Jane, and, as I was\r\nbusy with the window, I heard all that was saying within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s in your letter, Bella, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 says he: \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a long\r\ntime spelling it over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you shave this morning, Sir Condy?\xe2\x80\x99 says she, and put the letter\r\ninto her pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shaved the day before yesterday,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98my dear, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of now; but anything to oblige you, and to have peace\r\nand quietness, my dear\xe2\x80\x99--and presently I had a glimpse of him at the\r\ncracked glass over the chimney-piece, standing up shaving himself to\r\nplease my lady. But she took no notice, but went on reading her book,\r\nand Mrs. Jane doing her hair behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it you\xe2\x80\x99re reading there, my dear?--phoo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve cut myself with\r\nthis razor; the man\xe2\x80\x99s a cheat that sold it me, but I have not paid him\r\nfor it yet. What is it you\xe2\x80\x99re reading there? Did you hear me asking you,\r\nmy dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98THE SORROWS OF WERTHER,\xe2\x80\x99 replies my lady, as well as I could hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think more of the sorrows of Sir Condy,\xe2\x80\x99 says my master, joking like.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What news from Mount Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No news,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98but the old story over again; my friends all\r\nreproaching me still for what I can\xe2\x80\x99t help now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it for marrying me?\xe2\x80\x99 said my master, still shaving. \xe2\x80\x98What signifies,\r\nas you say, talking of that, when it can\xe2\x80\x99t be help\xe2\x80\x99d now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith that she heaved a great sigh that I heard plain enough in the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And did not you use me basely, Sir Condy,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98not to tell me\r\nyou were ruined before I married you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell you, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98Did you ever ask me one word about it.\r\nAnd had not your friends enough of your own, that were telling you\r\nnothing else from morning to night, if you\xe2\x80\x99d have listened to them\r\nslanders?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No slanders, nor are my friends slanderers; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to hear\r\nthem treated with disrespect as I do,\xe2\x80\x99 says my lady, and took out her\r\npocket-handkerchief; \xe2\x80\x98they are the best of friends, and if I had taken\r\ntheir advice--But my father was wrong to lock me up, I own. That was the\r\nonly unkind thing I can charge him with; for if he had not locked me up,\r\nI should never have had a serious thought of running away as I did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said my master, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t cry and make yourself uneasy\r\nabout it now, when it\xe2\x80\x99s all over, and you have the man of your own\r\nchoice, in spite of \xe2\x80\x98em all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was too young, I know, to make a choice at the time you ran away with\r\nme, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x99 says my lady, and another sigh, which made my master,\r\nhalf-shaved as he was, turn round upon her in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Bell,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98you can\xe2\x80\x99t deny what you know as well as I do,\r\nthat it was at your own particular desire, and that twice under your\r\nown hand and seal expressed, that I should carry you off as I did to\r\nScotland, and marry you there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, say no more about it, Sir Condy,\xe2\x80\x99 said my lady, pettish-like; \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwas a child then, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And as far as I know, you\xe2\x80\x99re little better now, my dear Bella, to be\r\ntalking in this manner to your husband\xe2\x80\x99s face; but I won\xe2\x80\x99t take it\r\nill of you, for I know it\xe2\x80\x99s something in that letter you put into your\r\npocket just now that has set you against me all on a sudden, and imposed\r\nupon your understanding.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not so very easy as you think it, Sir Condy, to impose upon my\r\nunderstanding,\xe2\x80\x99 said my lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98I have, and with reason, the best opinion of your\r\nunderstanding of any man now breathing; and you know I have never set my\r\nown in competition with it till now, my dear Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, taking her\r\nhand from her book as kind as could be--\xe2\x80\x98till now, when I have the great\r\nadvantage of being quite cool, and you not; so don\xe2\x80\x99t believe one word\r\nyour friends say against your own Sir Condy, and lend me the letter out\r\nof your pocket, till I see what it is they can have to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take it then,\xe2\x80\x99 says she; \xe2\x80\x98and as you are quite cool, I hope it is a\r\nproper time to request you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me to comply with the wishes of all\r\nmy own friends, and return to live with my father and family, during the\r\nremainder of my wretched existence, at Mount Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this my poor master fell back a few paces, like one that had been\r\nshot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re not serious, Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 says he; \xe2\x80\x98and could you find it in your\r\nheart to leave me this way in the very middle of my distresses, all\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x99 But recollecting himself after his first surprise, and a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime for reflection, he said, with a great deal of consideration for my\r\nlady, \xe2\x80\x98Well, Bella, my dear, I believe you are right; for what could you\r\ndo at Castle Rackrent, and an execution against the goods coming down,\r\nand the furniture to be canted, and an auction in the house all next\r\nweek? So you have my full consent to go, since that is your desire; only\r\nyou must not think of my accompanying you, which I could not in honour\r\ndo upon the terms I always have been, since our marriage, with your\r\nfriends. Besides, I have business to transact at home; so in the\r\nmeantime, if we are to have any breakfast this morning, let us go down\r\nand have it for the last time in peace and comfort, Bella.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen as I heard my master coming to the passage door, I finished\r\nfastening up my slate against the broken pane; and when he came out I\r\nwiped down the window-seat with my wig,{19}  I and bade him a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98good-morrow\xe2\x80\x99 as kindly as I could, seeing he was in trouble, though he\r\nstrove and thought to hide it from me.\r\n\r\n   {19} Wigs were formerly used instead of brooms in Ireland for\r\n   sweeping or dusting tables, stairs, etc. The Editor doubted the fact\r\n   till he saw a labourer of the old school sweep down a flight of\r\n   stairs with his wig; he afterwards put it on his head again with the\r\n   utmost composure, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, please your honour, it\xe2\x80\x99s never a\r\n   bit the worse.\r\n\r\n   It must be acknowledged that these men are not in any danger of\r\n   catching cold by taking off their wigs occasionally, because they\r\n   usually have fine crops of hair growing under their wigs. The wigs\r\n   are often yellow, and the hair which appears from beneath them\r\n   black; the wigs are usually too small, and are raised up by the hair\r\n   beneath, or by the ears of the wearers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This window is all racked and tattered,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98and it\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nstriving to mend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It IS all racked and tattered, plain enough,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98and never mind\r\nmending it, honest old Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 says he; \xe2\x80\x98it will do well enough for you\r\nand I, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all the company we shall have left in the house by and\r\nby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to see your honour so low this morning,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98but you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe better after taking your breakfast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Step down to the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98and bring me up the pen\r\nand ink into the parlour, and get a sheet of paper from Mrs. Jane, for I\r\nhave business that can\xe2\x80\x99t brook to be delayed; and come into the parlour\r\nwith the pen and ink yourself, Thady, for I must have you to witness my\r\nsigning a paper I have to execute in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWell, while I was getting of the pen and ink-horn, and the sheet of\r\npaper, I ransacked my brains to think what could be the papers my poor\r\nmaster could have to execute in such a hurry, he that never thought of\r\nsuch a thing as doing business afore breakfast in the whole course of\r\nhis life, for any man living; but this was for my lady, as I afterwards\r\nfound, and the more genteel of him after all her treatment.\r\n\r\nI was just witnessing the paper that he had scrawled over, and was\r\nshaking the ink out of my pen upon the carpet, when my lady came in to\r\nbreakfast, and she started as if it had been a ghost; as well she might,\r\nwhen she saw Sir Condy writing at this unseasonable hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That will do very well, Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 says he to me, and took the paper I had\r\nsigned to, without knowing what upon the earth it might be, out of my\r\nhands, and walked, folding it up, to my lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are concerned in this, my Lady Rackrent,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, putting it into\r\nher hands; \xe2\x80\x98and I beg you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep this memorandum safe, and show it to\r\nyour friends the first thing you do when you get home; but put it in\r\nyour pocket now, my dear, and let us eat our breakfast, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is all this?\xe2\x80\x99 said my lady, opening the paper in great curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s only a bit of a memorandum of what I think becomes me to do\r\nwhenever I am able,\xe2\x80\x99 says my master; \xe2\x80\x98you know my situation, tied hand\r\nand foot at the present time being, but that can\xe2\x80\x99t last always, and when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m dead and gone the land will be to the good, Thady, you know; and\r\ntake notice it\xe2\x80\x99s my intention your lady should have a clear five hundred\r\na year jointure out the estate afore any of my debts are paid.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nplease your honour,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t expect to live to see that time,\r\nbeing now upwards of fourscore years of age, and you a young man, and\r\nlikely to continue so, by the help of God.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was vexed to see my lady so insensible too, for all she said was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is very genteel of you, Sir Condy. You need not wait any longer,\r\nThady.\xe2\x80\x99 So I just picked up the pen and ink that had tumbled on the\r\nfloor, and heard my master finish with saying, \xe2\x80\x98You behaved very genteel\r\nto me, my dear, when you threw all the little you had in your power\r\nalong with yourself into my hands; and as I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny but what you may\r\nhave had some things to complain of,\xe2\x80\x99--to be sure he was thinking then\r\nof Judy, or of the whisky-punch, one or t\xe2\x80\x99other, or both,--\xe2\x80\x98and as I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t deny but you may have had something to complain of, my dear, it is\r\nbut fair you should have something in the form of compensation to look\r\nforward to agreeably in future; besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s an act of justice to\r\nmyself, that none of your friends, my dear, may ever have it to say\r\nagainst me, I married for money, and not for love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is the last thing I should ever have thought of saying of you, Sir\r\nCondy,\xe2\x80\x99 said my lady, looking very gracious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Condy, \xe2\x80\x98we shall part as good friends as we\r\nmet; so all\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was greatly rejoiced to hear this, and went out of the parlour to\r\nreport it all to the kitchen. The next morning my lady and Mrs. Jane\r\nset out for Mount Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town in the jaunting-car. Many wondered at\r\nmy lady\xe2\x80\x99s choosing to go away, considering all things, upon the\r\njaunting-car, as if it was only a party of pleasure; but they did not\r\nknow till I told them that the coach was all broke in the journey down,\r\nand no other vehicle but the car to be had. Besides, my lady\xe2\x80\x99s friends\r\nwere to send their coach to meet her at the cross-roads; so it was all\r\ndone very proper.\r\n\r\nMy poor master was in great trouble after my lady left us. The execution\r\ncame down, and everything at Castle Rackrent was seized by the gripers,\r\nand my son Jason, to his shame be it spoken, amongst them. I wondered,\r\nfor the life of me, how he could harden himself to do it; but then he\r\nhad been studying the law, and had made himself Attorney Quirk; so he\r\nbrought down at once a heap of accounts upon my master\xe2\x80\x99s head. To cash\r\nlent, and to ditto, and to ditto, and to ditto and oats, and bills paid\r\nat the milliner\xe2\x80\x99s and linen-draper\xe2\x80\x99s, and many dresses for the fancy\r\nballs in Dublin for my lady, and all the bills to the workmen and\r\ntradesmen for the scenery of the theatre, and the chandler\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\ngrocer\xe2\x80\x99s bills, and tailor\xe2\x80\x99s, besides butcher\xe2\x80\x99s and baker\xe2\x80\x99s, and, worse\r\nthan all, the old one of that base wine merchant\xe2\x80\x99s, that wanted to\r\narrest my poor master for the amount on the election day, for which\r\namount Sir Condy afterwards passed his note of hand, bearing lawful\r\ninterest from the date thereof; and the interest and compound interest\r\nwas now mounted to a terrible deal on many other notes and bonds for\r\nmoney borrowed, and there was, besides, hush-money to the sub-sheriffs,\r\nand sheets upon sheets of old and new attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 bills, with heavy\r\nbalances, \xe2\x80\x98as per former account furnished,\xe2\x80\x99 brought forward with\r\ninterest thereon; then there was a powerful deal due to the Crown\r\nfor sixteen years\xe2\x80\x99 arrear of quit-rent of the town-lands of\r\nCarrickshaughlin, with driver\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and a compliment to the receiver\r\nevery year for letting the quit-rent run on to oblige Sir Condy, and\r\nSir Kit afore him. Then there were bills for spirits and ribands at the\r\nelection time, and the gentlemen of the committee\xe2\x80\x99s accounts unsettled,\r\nand their subscription never gathered; and there were cows to be paid\r\nfor, with the smith and farrier\xe2\x80\x99s bills to be set against the rent of\r\nthe demesne, with calf and hay money; then there was all the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwages, since I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when, coming due to them, and sums advanced\r\nfor them by my son Jason for clothes, and boots, and whips, and odd\r\nmoneys for sundries expended by them in journeys to town and elsewhere,\r\nand pocket-money for the master continually, and messengers and postage\r\nbefore his being a Parliament man. I can\xe2\x80\x99t myself tell you what besides;\r\nbut this I know, that when the evening came on the which Sir Condy had\r\nappointed to settle all with my son Jason, and when he comes into the\r\nparlour, and sees the sight of bills and load of papers all gathered on\r\nthe great dining-table for him, he puts his hands before both his eyes,\r\nand cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Merciful Jasus! what is it I see before me?\xe2\x80\x99 Then I sets\r\nan arm-chair at the table for him, and with a deal of difficulty he sits\r\nhim down, and my son Jason hands him over the pen and ink to sign to\r\nthis man\xe2\x80\x99s bill and t\xe2\x80\x99other man\xe2\x80\x99s bill, all which he did without making\r\nthe least objections. Indeed, to give him his due, I never seen a man\r\nmore fair and honest, and easy in all his dealings, from first to last,\r\nas Sir Condy, or more willing to pay every man his own as far as he was\r\nable, which is as much as any one can do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, joking like with Jason, \xe2\x80\x98I wish we could settle it\r\nall with a stroke of my grey goose quill. What signifies making me wade\r\nthrough all this ocean of papers here; can\xe2\x80\x99t you now, who understand\r\ndrawing out an account, debtor and creditor, just sit down here at the\r\ncorner of the table and get it done out for me, that I may have a clear\r\nview of the balance, which is all I need be talking about, you know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very true, Sir Condy; nobody understands business better than\r\nyourself,\xe2\x80\x99 says Jason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to do, being born and bred to the bar,\xe2\x80\x99 says Sir Condy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thady, do step out and see are they bringing in the things for the\r\npunch, for we\xe2\x80\x99ve just done all we have to do for this evening.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI goes out accordingly, and when I came back Jason was pointing to the\r\nbalance, which was a terrible sight to my poor master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh! pooh! pooh!\xe2\x80\x99 says he. \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s so many noughts they dazzle my\r\neyes, so they do, and put me in mind of all I suffered larning of my\r\nnumeration table, when I was a boy at the day-school along with you,\r\nJason--units, tens, hundreds, tens of hundreds. Is the punch ready,\r\nThady?\xe2\x80\x99 says he, seeing me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Immediately; the boy has the jug in his hand; it\xe2\x80\x99s coming upstairs,\r\nplease your honour, as fast as possible,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, for I saw his honour\r\nwas tired out of his life; but Jason, very short and cruel, cuts me off\r\nwith--\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be talking of punch yet awhile; it\xe2\x80\x99s no time for punch yet\r\na bit--units, tens, hundreds,\xe2\x80\x99 goes he on, counting over the master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder, units, tens, hundreds, thousands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A-a-ah! hold your hand,\xe2\x80\x99 cries my master. \xe2\x80\x98Where in this wide world am\r\nI to find hundreds, or units itself, let alone thousands?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The balance has been running on too long,\xe2\x80\x99 says Jason, sticking to\r\nhim as I could not have done at the time, if you\xe2\x80\x99d have given both the\r\nIndies and Cork to boot; \xe2\x80\x98the balance has been running on too long, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m distressed myself on your account, Sir Condy, for money, and the\r\nthing must be settled now on the spot, and the balance cleared off,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays Jason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll thank you if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only show me how,\xe2\x80\x99 says Sir Condy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s but one way,\xe2\x80\x99 says Jason, \xe2\x80\x98and that\xe2\x80\x99s ready enough. When\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no cash, what can a gentleman do but go to the land?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can you go to the land, and it under custodiam to yourself\r\nalready?\xe2\x80\x99 says Sir Condy; \xe2\x80\x98and another custodiam hanging over it? And no\r\none at all can touch it, you know, but the custodees.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure, can\xe2\x80\x99t you sell, though at a loss? Sure you can sell, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\npurchaser ready for you,\xe2\x80\x99 says Jason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you so?\xe2\x80\x99 says Sir Condy. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a great point gained. But there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na thing now beyond all, that perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet, barring Thady\r\nhas let you into the secret.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sarrah bit of a secret, or anything at all of the kind, has he learned\r\nfrom me these fifteen weeks come St. John\xe2\x80\x99s Eve,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98for we have\r\nscarce been upon speaking terms of late. But what is it your honour\r\nmeans of a secret?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, the secret of the little keepsake I gave my Lady Rackrent the\r\nmorning she left us, that she might not go back empty-handed to her\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Lady Rackrent, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, has baubles and keepsakes enough, as those\r\nbills on the table will show,\xe2\x80\x99 says Jason; \xe2\x80\x98but whatever it is,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nhe, taking up his pen, \xe2\x80\x98we must add it to the balance, for to be sure it\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be paid for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, nor can\xe2\x80\x99t till after my decease,\xe2\x80\x99 says Sir Condy; \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s one good\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x99 Then colouring up a good deal, he tells Jason of the memorandum\r\nof the five hundred a-year jointure he had settled upon my lady; at\r\nwhich Jason was indeed mad, and said a great deal in very high words,\r\nthat it was using a gentleman who had the management of his affairs, and\r\nwas, moreover, his principal creditor, extremely ill to do such a thing\r\nwithout consulting him, and against his knowledge and consent. To all\r\nwhich Sir Condy had nothing to reply, but that, upon his conscience, it\r\nwas in a hurry and without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought on his part, and he was\r\nvery sorry for it, but if it was to do over again he would do the same;\r\nand he appealed to me, and I was ready to give my evidence, if that\r\nwould do, to the truth of all he said.\r\n\r\nSo Jason with much ado was brought to agree to a compromise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The purchaser that I have ready,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98will be much displeased, to\r\nbe sure, at the encumbrance on the land, but I must see and manage him.\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a deed ready drawn up; we have nothing to do but to put in the\r\nconsideration money and our names to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how much am I going to sell!--the lands of O\xe2\x80\x99Shaughlin\xe2\x80\x99s Town, and\r\nthe lands of Gruneaghoolaghan, and the lands of Crookagnawaturgh,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nhe, just reading to himself. \xe2\x80\x98And--oh, murder, Jason! sure you won\xe2\x80\x99t put\r\nthis in--the castle, stable, and appurtenances of Castle Rackrent?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, murder!\xe2\x80\x99 says I, clapping my hands; \xe2\x80\x98this is too bad, Jason.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why so?\xe2\x80\x99 said Jason. \xe2\x80\x98When it\xe2\x80\x99s all, and a great deal more to the back\r\nof it, lawfully mine, was I to push for it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look at him,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, pointing to Sir Condy, who was just leaning back\r\nin his arm-chair, with his arms falling beside him like one stupefied;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98is it you, Jason, that can stand in his presence, and recollect all he\r\nhas been to us, and all we have been to him, and yet use him so at the\r\nlast?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who will you find to use him better, I ask you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Jason; \xe2\x80\x98if he can\r\nget a better purchaser, I\xe2\x80\x99m content; I only offer to purchase, to make\r\nthings easy, and oblige him; though I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what compliment I am\r\nunder, if you come to that. I have never had, asked, or charged more\r\nthan sixpence in the pound, receiver\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and where would he have got\r\nan agent for a penny less?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Jason! Jason! how will you stand to this in the face of the county,\r\nand all who know you?\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98and what will people think and say when\r\nthey see you living here in Castle Rackrent, and the lawful owner turned\r\nout of the seat of his ancestors, without a cabin to put his head into,\r\nor so much as a potato to eat?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJason, whilst I was saying this, and a great deal more, made me signs,\r\nand winks, and frowns; but I took no heed, for I was grieved and sick at\r\nheart for my poor master, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t but speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s the punch,\xe2\x80\x99 says Jason, for the door opened; \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s the punch!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHearing that, my master starts up in his chair, and recollects himself,\r\nand Jason uncorks the whisky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Set down the jug here,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, making room for it beside the papers\r\nopposite to Sir Condy, but still not stirring the deed that was to make\r\nover all.\r\n\r\nWell, I was in great hopes he had some touch of mercy about him when I\r\nsaw him making the punch, and my master took a glass; but Jason put it\r\nback as he was going to fill again, saying: \xe2\x80\x98No, Sir Condy, it shan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe said of me I got your signature to this deed when you were half-seas\r\nover: you know your name and handwriting in that condition would not, if\r\nbrought before the courts, benefit me a straw; wherefore, let us settle\r\nall before we go deeper into the punch-bowl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Settle all as you will,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Condy, clapping his hands to his\r\nears; \xe2\x80\x98but let me hear no more. I\xe2\x80\x99m bothered to death this night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve only to sign,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jason, putting the pen to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take all, and be content,\xe2\x80\x99 said my master. So he signed; and the man\r\nwho brought in the punch witnessed it, for I was not able, but crying\r\nlike a child; and besides, Jason said, which I was glad of, that I was\r\nno fit witness, being so old and doting. It was so bad with me, I could\r\nnot taste a drop of the punch itself, though my master himself, God\r\nbless him! in the midst of his trouble, poured out a glass for me, and\r\nbrought it up to my lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a drop; I thank your honour\xe2\x80\x99s honour as much as if I took it,\r\nthough.\xe2\x80\x99 And I just set down the glass as it was, and went out, and when\r\nI got to the street door the neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 childer, who were playing at\r\nmarbles there, seeing me in great trouble, left their play, and gathered\r\nabout me to know what ailed me; and I told them all, for it was a great\r\nrelief to me to speak to these poor childer, that seemed to have some\r\nnatural feeling left in them; and when they were made sensible that Sir\r\nCondy was going to leave Castle Rackrent for good and all, they set up\r\na whillaluh that could be heard to the farthest end of the street; and\r\none--fine boy he was--that my master had given an apple to that morning,\r\ncried the loudest; but they all were the same sorry, for Sir Condy was\r\ngreatly beloved amongst the childer, for letting them go a-nutting in\r\nthe demesne, without saying a word to them, though my lady objected\r\nto them. The people in the town, who were the most of them standing at\r\ntheir doors, hearing the childer cry, would know the reason of it; and\r\nwhen the report was made known, the people one and all gathered in great\r\nanger against my son Jason, and terror at the notion of his coming to be\r\nlandlord over them, and they cried, \xe2\x80\x98No Jason! no Jason! Sir Condy! Sir\r\nCondy! Sir Condy Rackrent for ever!\xe2\x80\x99 And the mob grew so great and so\r\nloud, I was frightened, and made my way back to the house to warn my son\r\nto make his escape, or hide himself for fear of the consequences. Jason\r\nwould not believe me till they came all round the house, and to the\r\nwindows with great shouts. Then he grew quite pale, and asked Sir Condy\r\nwhat had he best do?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what you had best do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Condy, who was laughing\r\nto see his fright; \xe2\x80\x98finish your glass first, then let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the window\r\nand show ourselves, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell \xe2\x80\x98em--or you shall, if you please--that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to the Lodge for change of air for my health, and by my own\r\ndesire, for the rest of my days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jason, who never meant it should have been so but could\r\nnot refuse him the Lodge at this unseasonable time: Accordingly, Sir\r\nCondy threw up the sash and explained matters, and thanked all his\r\nfriends, and bid them look in at the punchbowl, and observe that Jason\r\nand he had been sitting over it very good friends; so the mob was\r\ncontent, and he sent them out some whisky to drink his health, and that\r\nwas the last time his honour\xe2\x80\x99s health was ever drunk at Castle Rackrent.\r\n\r\nThe very next day, being too proud, as he said to me, to stay an hour\r\nlonger in a house that did not belong to him, he sets off to the Lodge,\r\nand I along with him not many hours after. And there was great bemoaning\r\nthrough all O\xe2\x80\x99Shaughlin\xe2\x80\x99s Town, which I stayed to witness, and gave my\r\npoor master a full account of when I got to the Lodge. He was very low,\r\nand in his bed, when I got there, and complained of a great pain about\r\nhis heart; but I guessed it was only trouble and all the business, let\r\nalone vexation, he had gone through of late; and knowing the nature of\r\nhim from a boy, I took my pipe, and whilst smoking it by the chimney\r\nbegan telling him how he was beloved and regretted in the county, and it\r\ndid him a deal of good to hear it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your honour has a great many friends yet that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know of, rich\r\nand poor, in the county,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98for as I was coming along the road I\r\nmet two gentlemen in their own carriages, who asked after you, knowing\r\nme, and wanted to know where you was and all about you, and even how old\r\nI was. Think of that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he wakened out of his doze, and began questioning me who the\r\ngentlemen were. And the next morning it came into my head to go,\r\nunknown to anybody, with my master\xe2\x80\x99s compliments, round to many of the\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s houses, where he and my lady used to visit, and people that\r\nI knew were his great friends, and would go to Cork to serve him any\r\nday in the year, and I made bold to try to borrow a trifle of cash from\r\nthem. They all treated me very civil for the most part, and asked a\r\ngreat many questions very kind about my lady and Sir Condy and all the\r\nfamily, and were greatly surprised to learn from me Castle Rackrent was\r\nsold, and my master at the Lodge for health; and they all pitied him\r\ngreatly, and he had their good wishes, if that would do; but money was\r\na thing they unfortunately had not any of them at this time to spare. I\r\nhad my journey for my pains, and I, not used to walking, nor supple\r\nas formerly, was greatly tired, but had the satisfaction of telling my\r\nmaster, when I got to the Lodge, all the civil things said by high and\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98all you\xe2\x80\x99ve been telling me brings a strange thought\r\ninto my head. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a notion I shall not be long for this world anyhow,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ve a great fancy to see my own funeral afore I die.\xe2\x80\x99 I was greatly\r\nshocked, at the first speaking, to hear him speak so light about his\r\nfuneral, and he to all appearance in good health; but recollecting\r\nmyself, answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure it would be as fine a sight as one could see, I dared to\r\nsay, and one I should be proud to witness, and I did not doubt his\r\nhonour\xe2\x80\x99s would be as great a funeral as ever Sir Patrick O\xe2\x80\x99Shaughlin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwas, and such a one as that had never been known in the county afore\r\nor since.\xe2\x80\x99 But I never thought he was in earnest about seeing his own\r\nfuneral himself till the next day he returns to it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98as far as the wake{20} goes, sure I might without\r\nany great trouble have the satisfaction of seeing a bit of my own\r\nfuneral.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   {20} A \xe2\x80\x98wake\xe2\x80\x99 in England is a meeting avowedly for merriment; in\r\n   Ireland it is a nocturnal meeting avowedly for the purpose of\r\n   watching and bewailing the dead, but in reality for gossiping and\r\n   debauchery.[28]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, since your honour\xe2\x80\x99s honour\xe2\x80\x99s SO bent upon it,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, not\r\nwilling to cross him, and he in trouble, \xe2\x80\x98we must see what we can do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he fell into a sort of sham disorder, which was easy done, as he kept\r\nhis bed, and no one to see him; and I got my shister, who was an old\r\nwoman very handy about the sick, and very skilful, to come up to the\r\nLodge to nurse him; and we gave out, she knowing no better, that he was\r\njust at his latter end, and it answered beyond anything; and there was\r\na great throng of people, men, women, and childer, and there being\r\nonly two rooms at the Lodge, except what was locked up full of Jason\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfurniture and things, the house was soon as full and fuller than it\r\ncould hold, and the heat, and smoke, and noise wonderful great; and\r\nstanding amongst them that were near the bed, but not thinking at all\r\nof the dead, I was startled by the sound of my master\xe2\x80\x99s voice from under\r\nthe greatcoats that had been thrown all at top, and I went close up, no\r\none noticing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of this; I\xe2\x80\x99m smothering, and can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear a word of all they\xe2\x80\x99re saying of the deceased.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98God bless you, and lie still and quiet,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98a bit longer, for my\r\nshister\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of ghosts, and would die on the spot with fright was\r\nshe to see you come to life all on a sudden this way without the least\r\npreparation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he lays him still, though well nigh stifled, and I made all haste to\r\ntell the secret of the joke, whispering to one and t\xe2\x80\x99other, and there\r\nwas a great surprise, but not so great as we had laid out it would.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And aren\xe2\x80\x99t we to have the pipes and tobacco, after coming so far\r\nto-night?\xe2\x80\x99 said some; but they were all well enough pleased when his\r\nhonour got up to drink with them, and sent for more spirits from a\r\nshebeen-house,{21} where they very civilly let him have it upon credit.\r\nSo the night passed off very merrily, but to my mind Sir Condy was\r\nrather upon the sad order in the midst of it all, not finding there had\r\nbeen such a great talk about himself after his death as he had always\r\nexpected to hear.\r\n\r\n   {21} \xe2\x80\x98Shebeen-house,\xe2\x80\x99 a hedge alehouse. Shebeen properly means weak,\r\n   small-beer, taplash.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when the house was cleared of them, and none but my\r\nshister and myself left in the kitchen with Sir Condy, one opens the\r\ndoor and walks in, and who should it be but Judy M\xe2\x80\x99Quirk herself! I\r\nforgot to notice that she had been married long since, whilst young\r\nCaptain Moneygawl lived at the Lodge, to the captain\xe2\x80\x99s huntsman, who\r\nafter a whilst \xe2\x80\x98listed and left her, and was killed in the wars. Poor\r\nJudy fell off greatly in her good looks after her being married a year\r\nor two; and being smoke-dried in the cabin, and neglecting herself like,\r\nit was hard for Sir Condy himself to know her again till she spoke;\r\nbut when she says, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s Judy M\xe2\x80\x99Quirk, please your honour; don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nremember her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Judy, is it you?\xe2\x80\x99 says his honour. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, sure, I remember you very\r\nwell; but you\xe2\x80\x99re greatly altered, Judy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure it\xe2\x80\x99s time for me,\xe2\x80\x99 says she. \xe2\x80\x98And I think your honour, since I\r\nseen you last--but that\xe2\x80\x99s a great while ago--is altered too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And with reason, Judy,\xe2\x80\x99 says Sir Condy, fetching a sort of a sigh. \xe2\x80\x98But\r\nhow\xe2\x80\x99s this, Judy?\xe2\x80\x99 he goes on. \xe2\x80\x98I take it a little amiss of you that you\r\nwere not at my wake last night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, don\xe2\x80\x99t be being jealous of that,\xe2\x80\x99 says she; \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a\r\nsentence of your honour\xe2\x80\x99s wake till it was all over, or it would have\r\ngone hard with me but I would have been at it, sure; but I was forced\r\nto go ten miles up the country three days ago to a wedding of a\r\nrelation of my own\xe2\x80\x99s, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t get home till after the wake was over.\r\nBut,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98it won\xe2\x80\x99t be so, I hope, the next time,{22} please your\r\nhonour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   {22} At the coronation of one of our monarchs the King complained of\r\n   the confusion which happened in the procession. \xe2\x80\x98The great officer\r\n   who presided told his Majesty that \xe2\x80\x98it should not be so next time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That we shall see, Judy,\xe2\x80\x99 says his honour, \xe2\x80\x98and maybe sooner than you\r\nthink for, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve been very unwell this while past, and don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon\r\nanyway I\xe2\x80\x99m long for this world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this Judy takes up the corner of her apron, and puts it first to one\r\neye and then to t\xe2\x80\x99other, being to all appearance in great trouble; and\r\nmy shister put in her word, and bid his honour have a good heart, for\r\nshe was sure it was only the gout that Sir Patrick used to have flying\r\nabout him, and he ought to drink a glass or a bottle extraordinary to\r\nkeep it out of his stomach; and he promised to take her advice, and sent\r\nout for more spirits immediately; and Judy made a sign to me, and I went\r\nover to the door to her, and she said, \xe2\x80\x98I wonder to see Sir Condy so\r\nlow: has he heard the news?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What news?\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t ye hear it, then?\xe2\x80\x99 says she; \xe2\x80\x98my Lady Rackrent that was is\r\nkilt[29] and lying for dead, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt but it\xe2\x80\x99s all over with\r\nher by this time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mercy on us all,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98how was it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The jaunting-car it was that ran away with her,\xe2\x80\x99 says Judy. \xe2\x80\x98I was\r\ncoming home that same time from Biddy M\xe2\x80\x99Guggin\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, and a great\r\ncrowd of people too upon the road, coming from the fair of\r\nCrookaghnawaturgh, and I sees a jaunting-car standing in the middle of\r\nthe road, and with the two wheels off and all tattered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays I. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t ye hear of it?\xe2\x80\x9d says they that were looking on; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy Lady Rackrent\xe2\x80\x99s car, that was running away from her husband, and the\r\nhorse took fright at a carrion that lay across the road, and so ran\r\naway with the jaunting-car, and my Lady Rackrent and her maid\r\nscreaming, and the horse ran with them against a car that was coming\r\nfrom the fair with the boy asleep on it, and the lady\xe2\x80\x99s petticoat\r\nhanging out of the jaunting-car caught, and she was dragged I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell you how far upon the road, and it all broken up with the stones\r\njust going to be pounded, and one of the road-makers, with his\r\nsledge-hammer in his hand, stops the horse at the last; but my Lady\r\nRackrent was all kilt and smashed,\xe2\x80\x9d{23} and they lifted her into a\r\ncabin hard by, and the maid was found after where she had been thrown\r\nin the gripe of a ditch, her cap and bonnet all full of bog water, and\r\nthey say my lady can\xe2\x80\x99t live anyway. Thady, pray now is it true what I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntold for sartain, that Sir Condy has made over all to your son Jason?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   {23} KILT AND SMASHED.--Our author is not here guilty of an\r\n   anti-climax.

Thus you may hear a man exclaim, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m kilt\r\n   and murdered!\xe2\x80\x99 but he frequently means only that he has received a\r\n   black eye or a slight contusion. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m kilt all over\xe2\x80\x99 means that he\r\n   is in a worse state than being simply \xe2\x80\x98kilt.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m kilt with\r\n   the cold,\xe2\x80\x99 is nothing to \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m kilt all over with the rheumatism.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All,\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All entirely?\xe2\x80\x99 says she again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All entirely\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s a great shame; but don\xe2\x80\x99t be telling Jason what\r\nI say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what is it you say?\xe2\x80\x99 cries Sir Condy, leaning over betwixt us,\r\nwhich made Judy start greatly. \xe2\x80\x98I know the time when Judy M\xe2\x80\x99Quirk would\r\nnever have stayed so long talking at the door and I in the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 says Judy, \xe2\x80\x98for shame, Sir Condy; times are altered since then,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s my Lady Rackrent you ought to be thinking of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And why should I be thinking of her, that\xe2\x80\x99s not thinking of me now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays Sir Condy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No matter for that,\xe2\x80\x99 says Judy, very properly; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s time you should\r\nbe thinking of her, if ever you mean to do it at all, for don\xe2\x80\x99t you know\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s lying for death?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Lady Rackrent!\xe2\x80\x99 says Sir Condy, in a surprise; \xe2\x80\x98why it\xe2\x80\x99s but two\r\ndays since we parted, as you very well know, Thady, in her full health\r\nand spirits, and she, and her maid along with her, going to Mount\r\nJuliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town on her jaunting-car.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99ll never ride no more on her jaunting-car,\xe2\x80\x99 said Judy, \xe2\x80\x98for it has\r\nbeen the death of her, sure enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd is she dead then?\xe2\x80\x99 says his honour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As good as dead, I hear,\xe2\x80\x99 says Judy; \xe2\x80\x98but there\xe2\x80\x99s Thady here as just\r\nlearnt the whole truth of the story as I had it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s fitter he or\r\nanybody else should be telling it you than I, Sir Condy: I must be going\r\nhome to the childer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut he stops her, but rather from civility in him, as I could see very\r\nplainly, than anything else, for Judy was, as his honour remarked at her\r\nfirst coming in, greatly changed, and little likely, as far as I could\r\nsee--though she did not seem to be clear of it herself--little likely\r\nto be my Lady Rackrent now, should there be a second toss-up to be made.\r\nBut I told him the whole story out of the face, just as Judy had told\r\nit to me, and he sent off a messenger with his compliments to Mount\r\nJuliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town that evening, to learn the truth of the report, and\r\nJudy bid the boy that was going call in at Tim M\xe2\x80\x99Enerney\xe2\x80\x99s shop in\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Shaughlin\xe2\x80\x99s Town and buy her a new shawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do so,\xe2\x80\x99 Said Sir Condy, \xe2\x80\x98and tell Tim to take no money from you, for I\r\nmust pay him for the shawl myself.\xe2\x80\x99 At this my shister throws me over\r\na look, and I says nothing, but turned the tobacco in my mouth, whilst\r\nJudy began making a many words about it, and saying how she could not be\r\nbeholden for shawls to any gentleman. I left her there to consult with\r\nmy shister, did she think there was anything in it, and my shister\r\nthought I was blind to be asking her the question, and I thought my\r\nshister must see more into it than I did, and recollecting all past\r\ntimes and everything, I changed my mind, and came over to her way\r\nof thinking, and we settled it that Judy was very like to be my Lady\r\nRackrent after all, if a vacancy should have happened.\r\n\r\nThe next day, before his honour was up, somebody comes with a double\r\nknock at the door, and I was greatly surprised to see it was my son\r\nJason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jason, is it you?\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98what brings you to the Lodge?\xe2\x80\x99 says I. \xe2\x80\x98Is\r\nit my Lady Rackrent? We know that already since yesterday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Maybe so,\xe2\x80\x99 says he; \xe2\x80\x98but I must see Sir Condy about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t see him yet,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98sure he is not awake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What then,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98can\xe2\x80\x99t he be wakened, and I standing at the door?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll not be disturbing his honour for you, Jason,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98many\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe hour you\xe2\x80\x99ve waited in your time, and been proud to do it, till his\r\nhonour was at leisure to speak to you. His honour,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, raising my\r\nvoice, at which his honour wakens of his own accord, and calls to me\r\nfrom the room to know who it was I was speaking to. Jason made no more\r\nceremony, but follows me into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How are you, Sir Condy?\xe2\x80\x99 says he; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to see you looking so\r\nwell; I came up to know how you did to-day, and to see did you want for\r\nanything at the Lodge?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing at all, Mr. Jason, I thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 says he; for his honour had\r\nhis own share of pride, and did not choose, after all that had passed,\r\nto be beholden, I suppose, to my son; \xe2\x80\x98but pray take a chair and be\r\nseated, Mr. Jason.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJason sat him down upon the chest, for chair there was none, and after\r\nhe had set there some time, and a silence on all sides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What news is there stirring in the country, Mr. Jason M\xe2\x80\x99Quirk?\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nSir Condy, very easy, yet high like.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None that\xe2\x80\x99s news to you, Sir Condy, I hear,\xe2\x80\x99 says Jason. \xe2\x80\x98I am sorry to\r\nhear of my Lady Rackrent\xe2\x80\x99s accident.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to you, and so is her ladyship, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x99 answered\r\nSir Condy, still stiff; and there was another sort of a silence, which\r\nseemed to lie the heaviest on my son Jason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Condy,\xe2\x80\x99 says he at last, seeing Sir Condy disposing himself to go\r\nto sleep again, \xe2\x80\x98Sir Condy, I daresay you recollect mentioning to me\r\nthe little memorandum you gave to Lady Rackrent about the \xc2\xa3500 a year\r\njointure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very true,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Condy; \xe2\x80\x98it is all in my recollection.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But if my\r\nLady Rackrent dies, there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of all jointure,\xe2\x80\x99 says Jason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 says Sir Condy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of certainty that my Lady Rackrent won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrecover,\xe2\x80\x99 says Jason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very true, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says my master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a fair speculation, then, for you to consider what the chance of\r\nthe jointure of those lands, when out of custodiam, will be to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just five hundred a year, I take it, without any speculation at all,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Sir Condy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s supposing the life dropt, and the custodiam off, you know;\r\nbegging your pardon, Sir Condy, who understands business, that is a\r\nwrong calculation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very likely so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Condy; \xe2\x80\x98but, Mr. Jason, if you have anything\r\nto say to me this morning about it, I\xe2\x80\x99d be obliged to you to say it, for\r\nI had an indifferent night\xe2\x80\x99s rest last night, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sorry to\r\nsleep a little this morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have only three words to say, and those more of consequence to you,\r\nSir Condy, than me. You are a little cool, I observe; but I hope you\r\nwill not be offended at what I have brought here in my pocket,\xe2\x80\x99 and he\r\npulls out two long rolls, and showers down golden guineas upon the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Condy; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s long since\xe2\x80\x99--but his pride stops\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All these are your lawful property this minute, Sir Condy, if you\r\nplease,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not for nothing, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Condy, and laughs a little.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing for nothing, or I\xe2\x80\x99m under a mistake with you, Jason.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Sir Condy, we\xe2\x80\x99ll not be indulging ourselves in any unpleasant\r\nretrospects,\xe2\x80\x99 says Jason; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s my present intention to behave, as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will, like a gentleman in this affair. Here\xe2\x80\x99s two hundred\r\nguineas, and a third I mean to add if you should think proper to make\r\nover to me all your right and title to those lands that you know of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll consider of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said my master; and a great deal more, that I was\r\ntired listening to, was said by Jason, and all that, and the sight of\r\nthe ready cash upon the bed, worked with his honour; and the short and\r\nthe long of it was, Sir Condy gathered up the golden guineas, and tied\r\nthem up in a handkerchief, and signed some paper Jason brought with him\r\nas usual, and there was an end of the business: Jason took himself away,\r\nand my master turned himself round and fell asleep again.\r\n\r\nI soon found what had put Jason in such a hurry to conclude this\r\nbusiness. The little gossoon we had sent off the day before with my\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s compliments to Mount Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town, and to know how my lady did\r\nafter her accident, was stopped early this morning, coming back with his\r\nanswer through O\xe2\x80\x99Shaughlin\xe2\x80\x99s Town, at Castle Rackrent, by my son Jason,\r\nand questioned of all he knew of my lady from the servant at Mount\r\nJuliet\xe2\x80\x99s Town; and the gossoon told him my Lady Rackrent was not\r\nexpected to live over night; so Jason thought it high time to be moving\r\nto the Lodge, to make his bargain with my master about the jointure\r\nafore it should be too late, and afore the little gossoon should reach\r\nus with the news. My master was greatly vexed--that is, I may say, as\r\nmuch as ever I seen him when he found how he had been taken in; but it\r\nwas some comfort to have the ready cash for immediate consumption in the\r\nhouse, anyway.\r\n\r\nAnd when Judy came up that evening, and brought the childer to see his\r\nhonour, he unties the handkerchief, and--God bless him! whether it was\r\nlittle or much he had, \xe2\x80\x98twas all the same with him--he gives \xe2\x80\x98em all\r\nround guineas apiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold up your head,\xe2\x80\x99 says my shister to Judy, as Sir Condy was busy\r\nfilling out a glass of punch for her eldest boy--\xe2\x80\x98Hold up your head,\r\nJudy; for who knows but we may live to see you yet at the head of the\r\nCastle Rackrent estate?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Maybe so,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98but not the way you are thinking of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI did not rightly understand which way Judy was looking when she made\r\nthis speech till a while after.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Thady, you were telling me yesterday that Sir Condy had sold\r\nall entirely to Jason, and where then does all them guineas in the\r\nhandkerchief come from?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are the purchase-money of my lady\xe2\x80\x99s jointure,\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\r\n\r\nJudy looks a little bit puzzled at this. \xe2\x80\x98A penny for your thoughts,\r\nJudy,\xe2\x80\x99 says my shister; \xe2\x80\x98hark, sure Sir Condy is drinking her health.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was at the table in the room,{24}  drinking with the excise-man and\r\nthe gauger, who came up to see his honour, and we were standing over\r\nthe fire in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n   {24} THE ROOM--the principal room in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t much care is he drinking my health or not,\xe2\x80\x99 says Judy; \xe2\x80\x98and it\r\nis not Sir Condy I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of, with all your jokes, whatever he is of\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t refuse to be my Lady Rackrent, Judy, if you had the\r\noffer?\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But if I could do better!\xe2\x80\x99 says she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How better?\xe2\x80\x99 says I and my shister both at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How better?\xe2\x80\x99 says she. \xe2\x80\x98Why, what signifies it to be my Lady Rackrent\r\nand no castle? Sure what good is the car, and no horse to draw it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And where will ye get the horse, Judy?\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind that,\xe2\x80\x99 says she; \xe2\x80\x98maybe it is your own son Jason might find\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jason!\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t be trusting to him, Judy. Sir Condy, as I\r\nhave good reason to know, spoke well of you when Jason spoke very\r\nindifferently of you, Judy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No matter,\xe2\x80\x99 says Judy; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s often men speak the contrary just to what\r\nthey think of us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you the same way of them, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 answered I. \xe2\x80\x98Nay, don\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\ndenying it, Judy, for I think the better of ye for it, and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nproud to call ye the daughter of a shister\xe2\x80\x99s son of mine, if I was to\r\nhear ye talk ungrateful, and anyway disrespectful of his honour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What disrespect,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98to say I\xe2\x80\x99d rather, if it was my luck, be\r\nthe wife of another man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll have no luck, mind my words, Judy,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; and all I remembered\r\nabout my poor master\xe2\x80\x99s goodness in tossing up for her afore he married\r\nat all came across me, and I had a choking in my throat that hindered me\r\nto say more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Better luck, anyhow, Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98than to be like some folk,\r\nfollowing the fortunes of them that have none left.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOh! King of Glory!\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98hear the pride and ungratitude of her, and\r\nhe giving his last guineas but a minute ago to her childer, and she with\r\nthe fine shawl on her he made her a present of but yesterday!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, troth, Judy, you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong now,\xe2\x80\x99 says my shister, looking at the\r\nshawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And was not he wrong yesterday, then,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98to be telling me I\r\nwas greatly altered, to affront me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, Judy,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98what is it brings you here then at all in the\r\nmind you are in; is it to make Jason think the better of you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you no more of my secrets, Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98nor would have\r\ntold you this much, had I taken you for such an unnatural fader as I\r\nfind you are, not to wish your own son prefarred to another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, troth, you are wrong now, Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 says my shister.\r\n\r\nWell, I was never so put to it in my life: between these womens, and\r\nmy son and my master, and all I felt and thought just now, I could not,\r\nupon my conscience, tell which was the wrong from the right. So I said\r\nnot a word more, but was only glad his honour had not the luck to hear\r\nall Judy had been saying of him, for I reckoned it would have gone nigh\r\nto break his heart; not that I was of opinion he cared for her as much\r\nas she and my shister fancied, but the ungratitude of the whole from\r\nJudy might not plase him; and he could never stand the notion of not\r\nbeing well spoken of or beloved like behind his back. Fortunately for\r\nall parties concerned, he was so much elevated at this time, there was\r\nno danger of his understanding anything, even if it had reached his\r\nears. There was a great horn at the Lodge, ever since my master and\r\nCaptain Moneygawl was in together, that used to belong originally to the\r\ncelebrated Sir Patrick, his ancestor; and his honour was fond often of\r\ntelling the story that he learned from me when a child, how Sir Patrick\r\ndrank the full of this horn without stopping, and this was what no\r\nother man afore or since could without drawing breath. Now Sir Condy\r\nchallenged the gauger, who seemed to think little of the horn, to\r\nswallow the contents, and had it filled to the brim with punch; and the\r\ngauger said it was what he could not do for nothing, but he\xe2\x80\x99d hold Sir\r\nCondy a hundred guineas he\xe2\x80\x99d do it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Done,\xe2\x80\x99 says my master; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay you a hundred golden guineas to a\r\ntester{25} you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   {25} TESTER: sixpence; from the French word _t\xc3\xaate_, a head--a piece\r\n   of silver stamped with a head, which in old French was called UN\r\n   TESTION, and which was about the value of an old English sixpence.\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98Tester\xe2\x80\x99 is used in Shakspeare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Done,\xe2\x80\x99 says the gauger; and done and done\xe2\x80\x99s enough between two\r\ngentlemen. The gauger was cast, and my master won the bet, and thought\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d won a hundred guineas, but by the wording it was adjudged to be\r\nonly a tester that was his due by the exciseman. It was all one to him;\r\nhe was as well pleased, and I was glad to see him in such spirits again.\r\n\r\nThe gauger--bad luck to him!--was the man that next proposed to my\r\nmaster to try himself, could he take at a draught the contents of the\r\ngreat horn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s horn!\xe2\x80\x99 said his honour; \xe2\x80\x98hand it to me: I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold you\r\nyour own bet over again I\xe2\x80\x99ll swallow it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Done,\xe2\x80\x99 says the gauger; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay ye anything at all you do no such\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A hundred guineas to sixpence I do,\xe2\x80\x99 says he; \xe2\x80\x98bring me the\r\nhandkerchief.\xe2\x80\x99 I was loth, knowing he meant the handkerchief with the\r\ngold in it, to bring it out in such company, and his honour not very\r\nable to reckon it. \xe2\x80\x98Bring me the handkerchief, then, Thady,\xe2\x80\x99 says he,\r\nand stamps with his foot; so with that I pulls it out of my greatcoat\r\npocket, where I had put it for safety. Oh, how it grieved me to see the\r\nguineas counting upon the table, and they the last my master had! Says\r\nSir Condy to me, \xe2\x80\x98Your hand is steadier than mine to-night, old Thady,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder; fill you the horn for me.\xe2\x80\x99 And so, wishing his\r\nhonour success, I did; but I filled it, little thinking of what would\r\nbefall him. He swallows it down, and drops like one shot. We lifts him\r\nup, and he was speechless, and quite black in the face. We put him to\r\nbed, and in a short time he wakened, raving with a fever on his brain.\r\nHe was shocking either to see or hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Judy! Judy! have you no touch of feeling? Won\xe2\x80\x99t you stay to help us\r\nnurse him?\xe2\x80\x99 says I to her, and she putting on her shawl to go out of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m frightened to see him,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t nor couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay\r\nin it; and what use? He can\xe2\x80\x99t last till the morning.\xe2\x80\x99 With that she ran\r\noff. There was none but my shister and myself left near him of all the\r\nmany friends he had.\r\n\r\nThe fever came and went, and came and went, and lasted five days, and\r\nthe sixth he was sensible for a few minutes, and said to me, knowing me\r\nvery well, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m in a burning pain all withinside of me, Thady.\xe2\x80\x99 I could\r\nnot speak, but my shister asked him would he have this thing or t\xe2\x80\x99other\r\nto do him good? \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98nothing will do me good no more,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nhe gave a terrible screech with the torture he was in; then again a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x99s ease--\xe2\x80\x98brought to this by drink,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. \xe2\x80\x98Where are all the\r\nfriends?--where\xe2\x80\x99s Judy? Gone, hey? Ay, Sir Condy has been a fool all his\r\ndays,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; and there was the last word he spoke, and died. He had\r\nbut a very poor funeral after all.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know any more, I\xe2\x80\x99m not very well able to tell you; but\r\nmy Lady Rackrent did not die, as was expected of her, but was only\r\ndisfigured in the face ever after by the fall and bruises she got; and\r\nshe and Jason, immediately after my poor master\xe2\x80\x99s death, set about going\r\nto law about that jointure; the memorandum not being on stamped paper,\r\nsome say it is worth nothing, others again it may do; others say Jason\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t have the lands at any rate; many wishes it so. For my part, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntired wishing for anything in this world, after all I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in it; but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll say nothing--it would be a folly to be getting myself ill-will\r\nin my old age. Jason did not marry, nor think of marrying Judy, as I\r\nprophesied, and I am not sorry for it: who is? As for all I have here\r\nset down from memory and hearsay of the family, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but\r\ntruth in it from beginning to end. That you may depend upon, for where\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe use of telling lies about the things which everybody knows as well\r\nas I do?\r\n\r\nThe Editor could have readily made the catastrophe of Sir Condy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhistory more dramatic and more pathetic, if he thought it allowable to\r\nvarnish the plain round tale of faithful Thady. He lays it before the\r\nEnglish reader as a specimen of manners and characters which are perhaps\r\nunknown in England. Indeed, the domestic habits of no nation in Europe\r\nwere less known to the English than those of their sister country, till\r\nwithin these few years.\r\n\r\nMr. Young\xe2\x80\x99s picture of Ireland, in his tour through that country, was\r\nthe first faithful portrait of its inhabitants. All the features in the\r\nforegoing sketch were taken from the life, and they are characteristic\r\nof that mixture of quickness, simplicity, cunning, carelessness,\r\ndissipation, disinterestedness, shrewdness, and blunder, which, in\r\ndifferent forms and with various success, has been brought upon the\r\nstage or delineated in novels.\r\n\r\nIt is a problem of difficult solution to determine whether a union will\r\nhasten or retard the amelioration of this country. The few gentlemen of\r\neducation who now reside in this country will resort to England. They\r\nare few, but they are in nothing inferior to men of the same rank in\r\nGreat Britain. The best that can happen will be the introduction of\r\nBritish manufacturers in their places.\r\n\r\nDid the Warwickshire militia, who were chiefly artisans, teach the Irish\r\nto drink beer? or did they learn from the Irish to drink whisky?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY\r\n\r\nSOME FRIENDS, WHO HAVE SEEN THADY\xe2\x80\x99S HISTORY SINCE IT HAS BEEN PRINTED\r\nHAVE SUGGESTED TO THE EDITOR, THAT MANY OF THE TERMS AND IDIOMATIC\r\nPHRASES, WITH WHICH IT ABOUNDS, COULD NOT BE INTELLIGIBLE TO THE ENGLISH\r\nREADER WITHOUT FURTHER EXPLANATION. THE EDITOR HAS THEREFORE FURNISHED\r\nTHE FOLLOWING GLOSSARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] MONDAY MORNING--Thady begins his memoirs of the Rackrent Family by\r\ndating MONDAY MORNING, because no great undertaking can be auspiciously\r\ncommenced in Ireland on any morning but MONDAY MORNING. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, please God\r\nwe live till Monday morning, we\xe2\x80\x99ll set the slater to mend the roof of\r\nthe house. On Monday morning we\xe2\x80\x99ll fall to, and cut the turf. On Monday\r\nmorning we\xe2\x80\x99ll see and begin mowing. On Monday morning, please your\r\nhonour, we\xe2\x80\x99ll begin and dig the potatoes,\xe2\x80\x99 etc.\r\n\r\nAll the intermediate days, between the making of such speeches and the\r\nensuing Monday, are wasted: and when Monday morning comes, it is ten to\r\none that the business is deferred to THE NEXT Monday morning. The Editor\r\nknew a gentleman, who, to counteract this prejudice, made his workmen\r\nand labourers begin all new pieces of work upon a Saturday.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] LET ALONE THE THREE KINGDOMS ITSELF.--LET ALONE, in this sentence,\r\nmeans put out of consideration. The phrase, let alone, which is now\r\nused as the imperative of a verb, may in time become a conjunction, and\r\nmay exercise the ingenuity of some future etymologist. The celebrated\r\nHorne Tooke has proved most satisfactorily, that the conjunction but\r\ncomes from the imperative of the Anglo-Saxon verb (BEOUTAN) TO BE OUT;\r\nalso, that IF comes from GIF, the imperative of the Anglo-Saxon verb\r\nwhich signifies TO GIVE, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3]. WHILLALUH.--Ullaloo, Gol, or lamentation over the dead--\r\n\r\nMagnoque ululante tumultu.--VIRGIL.\r\n\r\n     Ululatibus omne\r\n     Implevere nemus.--OVID.\r\n\r\nA full account of the Irish Gol, or Ullaloo, and of the Caoinan or Irish\r\nfuneral song, with its first semichorus, second semichorus, full chorus\r\nof sighs and groans, together with the Irish words and music, may\r\nbe found in the fourth volume of the TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL IRISH\r\nACADEMY. For the advantage of LAZY readers, who would rather read a page\r\nthan walk a yard, and from compassion, not to say sympathy, with their\r\ninfirmity, the Editor transcribes the following passages:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Irish have been always remarkable for their funeral lamentations;\r\nand this peculiarity has been noticed by almost every traveller who\r\nvisited them; and it seems derived from their Celtic ancestors, the\r\nprimaeval inhabitants of this isle. . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It has been affirmed of the Irish, that to cry was more natural to them\r\nthan to any other nation, and at length the Irish cry became proverbial.\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cambrensis in the twelfth century says, the Irish then musically\r\nexpressed their griefs; that is, they applied the musical art, in\r\nwhich they excelled all others, to the orderly celebration of funeral\r\nobsequies, by dividing the mourners into two bodies, each alternately\r\nsinging their part, and the whole at times joining in full chorus. . . .\r\nThe body of the deceased, dressed in grave clothes, and ornamented with\r\nflowers, was placed on a bier, or some elevated spot. The relations and\r\nkeepers (SINGING MOURNERS) ranged themselves in two divisions, one\r\nat the head, and the other at the feet of the corpse. The bards and\r\ncroteries had before prepared the funeral Caoinan. The chief bard of the\r\nhead chorus began by singing the first stanza, in a low, doleful tone,\r\nwhich was softly accompanied by the harp: at the conclusion, the foot\r\nsemichorus began the lamentation, or Ullaloo, from the final note of the\r\npreceding stanza, in which they were answered by the head semichorus;\r\nthen both united in one general chorus. The chorus of the first stanza\r\nbeing ended, the chief bard of the foot semichorus began the second Gol\r\nor lamentation, in which he was answered by that of the head; and then,\r\nas before, both united in the general full chorus. Thus alternately were\r\nthe song and choruses performed during the night. The genealogy, rank,\r\npossessions, the virtues and vices of the dead were rehearsed, and a\r\nnumber of interrogations were addressed to the deceased; as, Why did he\r\ndie? If married, whether his wife was faithful to him, his sons dutiful,\r\nor good hunters or warriors? If a woman, whether her daughters were fair\r\nor chaste? If a young man, whether he had been crossed in love; or if\r\nthe blue-eyed maids of Erin treated him with scorn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe are told, that formerly the feet (the metrical feet) of the Caoinan\r\nwere much attended to; but on the decline of the Irish bards these feet\r\nwere gradually neglected, and the Caoinan fell into a sort of slipshod\r\nmetre amongst women. Each province had different Caoinans, or at least\r\ndifferent imitations of the original. There was the Munster cry, the\r\nUlster cry, etc. It became an extempore performance, and every set of\r\nkeepers varied the melody according to their own fancy.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe how customs and ceremonies degenerate. The\r\npresent Irish cry, or howl, cannot boast of such melody, nor is the\r\nfuneral procession conducted with much dignity. The crowd of people who\r\nassemble at these funerals sometimes amounts to a thousand, often to\r\nfour or five hundred. They gather as the bearers of the hearse proceed\r\non their way, and when they pass through any village, or when they\r\ncome near any houses, they begin to cry--Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Agh! Agh!\r\nraising their notes from the first OH! to the last AGH! in a kind of\r\nmournful howl. This gives notice to the inhabitants of the village that\r\na FUNERAL IS PASSING and immediately they flock out to follow it. In\r\nthe province of Munster it is a common thing for the women to follow a\r\nfuneral, to join in the universal cry with all their might and main for\r\nsome time, and then to turn and ask--\xe2\x80\x98Arrah! who is it that\xe2\x80\x99s dead?--who\r\nis it we\xe2\x80\x99re crying for?\xe2\x80\x99 Even the poorest people have their own\r\nburying-places--that is, spots of ground in the churchyards where\r\nthey say that their ancestors have been buried ever since the wars of\r\nIreland; and if these burial-places are ten miles from the place where\r\na man dies, his friends and neighbours take care to carry his corpse\r\nthither. Always one priest, often five or six priests, attend these\r\nfunerals; each priest repeats a mass, for which he is paid, sometimes a\r\nshilling, sometimes half a crown, sometimes half a guinea, or a guinea,\r\naccording to their circumstances, or, as they say, according to the\r\nability of the deceased. After the burial of any very poor man, who has\r\nleft a widow or children, the priest makes what is called a COLLECTION\r\nfor the widow; he goes round to every person present, and each\r\ncontributes sixpence or a shilling, or what they please. The reader will\r\nfind in the note upon the word WAKE, more particulars respecting the\r\nconclusion of the Irish funerals.\r\n\r\nCertain old women, who cry particularly loud and well are in great\r\nrequest, and, as a man said to the Editor, \xe2\x80\x98Every one would wish and be\r\nproud to have such at his funeral, or at that of his friends.\xe2\x80\x99 The lower\r\nIrish are wonderfully eager to attend the funerals of their friends\r\nand relations, and they make their relationships branch out to a great\r\nextent. The proof that a poor man has been well beloved during his life\r\nis his having a crowded funeral. To attend a neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s funeral is a\r\ncheap proof of humanity, but it does not, as some imagine, cost nothing.\r\nThe time spent in attending funerals may be safely valued at half a\r\nmillion to the Irish nation; the Editor thinks that double that\r\nsum would not be too high an estimate. The habits of profligacy\r\nand drunkenness which are acquired at WAKES are here put out of the\r\nquestion. When a labourer, a carpenter, or a smith, is not at his work,\r\nwhich frequently happens, ask where he is gone, and ten to one the\r\nanswer is--\xe2\x80\x98Oh, faith, please your honour, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do a stroke\r\nto-day, for he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to THE funeral.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEven beggars, when they grow old, go about begging FOR THEIR OWN\r\nFUNERALS that is, begging for money to buy a coffin, candles, pipes, and\r\ntobacco. For the use of the candles, pipes, and tobacco, see WAKE.\r\n\r\nThose who value customs in proportion to their antiquity, and nations in\r\nproportion to their adherence to ancient customs, will doubtless admire\r\nthe Irish ULLALOO, and the Irish nation, for persevering in this usage\r\nfrom time immemorial. The Editor, however, has observed some alarming\r\nsymptoms, which seem to prognosticate the declining taste for the\r\nUllaloo in Ireland. In a comic theatrical entertainment, represented not\r\nlong since on the Dublin stage, a chorus of old women was introduced,\r\nwho set up the Irish howl round the relics of a physician, who is\r\nsupposed to have fallen under the wooden sword of Harlequin. After the\r\nold women have continued their Ullaloo for a decent time, with all the\r\nnecessary accompaniments of wringing their hands, wiping or rubbing\r\ntheir eyes with the corners of their gowns or aprons, etc., one of the\r\nmourners suddenly suspends her lamentable cries, and, turning to her\r\nneighbour, asks, \xe2\x80\x98Arrah now, honey, who is it we\xe2\x80\x99re crying for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] THE TENANTS WERE SENT AWAY WITHOUT THEIR WHISKY.--It is usual with\r\nsome landlords to give their inferior tenants a glass of whisky when\r\nthey pay their rents. Thady calls it THEIR whisky; not that the whisky\r\nis actually the property of the tenants, but that it becomes their\r\nRIGHT after it has been often given to them. In this general mode of\r\nreasoning respecting RIGHTS the lower Irish are not singular, but they\r\nare peculiarly quick and tenacious in claiming these rights. \xe2\x80\x98Last year\r\nyour honour gave me some straw for the roof of my house and I EXPECT\r\nyour honour will be after doing the same this year.\xe2\x80\x99 In this manner\r\ngifts are frequently turned into tributes. The high and low are not\r\nalways dissimilar in their habits. It is said, that the Sublime Ottoman\r\nPort is very apt to claim gifts as tributes: thus it is dangerous to\r\nsend the Grand Seignor a fine horse on his birthday one year, lest on\r\nhis next birthday he should expect a similar present, and should\r\nproceed to demonstrate the reasonableness of his expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] HE DEMEANED HIMSELF GREATLY--means, he lowered or disgraced himself\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] DUTY FOWLS, DUTY TURKEYS, AND DUTY GEESE.--In many leases in\r\nIreland, tenants were formerly bound to supply an inordinate quantity\r\nof poultry to their landlords. The Editor knew of thirty turkeys being\r\nreserved in one lease of a small farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] ENGLISH TENANTS.--An English tenant does not mean a tenant who is\r\nan Englishman, but a tenant who pays his rent the day that it is due.\r\nIt is a common prejudice in Ireland, amongst the poorer classes of\r\npeople, to believe that all tenants in England pay their rents on the\r\nvery day when they become due. An Irishman, when he goes to take a\r\nfarm, if he wants to prove to his landlord that he is a substantial\r\nman, offers to become an ENGLISH TENANT. If a tenant disobliges his\r\nlandlord by voting against him, or against his opinion, at an election,\r\nthe tenant is immediately informed by the agent that he must become an\r\nENGLISH TENANT. This threat does not imply that he is to change his\r\nlanguage or his country, but that he must pay all the arrear of rent\r\nwhich he owes, and that he must thenceforward pay his rent on that day\r\nwhen it becomes due.\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] CANTING--Does not mean talking or writing hypocritical nonsense,\r\nbut selling substantially by auction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] DUTY WORK.--It was formerly common in Ireland to insert clauses in leases, binding\r\ntenants to furnish their landlords with labourers and horses for several\r\ndays in the year. Much petty tyranny and oppression have resulted from\r\nthis feudal custom. Whenever a poor man disobliged his landlord, the\r\nagent sent to him for his duty work; and Thady does not exaggerate when\r\nhe says, that the tenants were often called from their own work to do\r\nthat of their landlord. Thus the very means of earning their rent were\r\ntaken from them: whilst they were getting home their landlord\xe2\x80\x99s harvest,\r\ntheir own was often ruined, and yet their rents were expected to be paid\r\nas punctually as if their time had been at their own disposal. This\r\nappears the height of absurd injustice.\r\n\r\nIn Esthonia, amongst the poor Sclavonian race of peasant slaves, they\r\npay tributes to their lords, not under the name of duty work, duty\r\ngeese, duty turkeys, etc., but under the name of RIGHTEOUSNESSES. The\r\nfollowing ballad is a curious specimen of Esthonian poetry:--\r\n\r\n     This is the cause that the country is ruined,\r\n     And the straw of the thatch is eaten away,\r\n     The gentry are come to live in the land--\r\n     Chimneys between the village,\r\n     And the proprietor upon the white floor!\r\n     The sheep brings forth a lamb with a white forehead,\r\n     This is paid to the lord for a RIGHTEOUSNESS SHEEP.\r\n     The sow farrows pigs,\r\n     They go to the spit of the lord.\r\n     The hen lays eggs,\r\n     They go into the lord\xe2\x80\x99s frying-pan.\r\n     The cow drops a male calf,\r\n     That goes into the lord\xe2\x80\x99s herd as a bull.\r\n     The mare foals a horse foal,\r\n     That must be for my lord\xe2\x80\x99s nag.\r\n     The boor\xe2\x80\x99s wife has sons,\r\n     They must go to look after my lord\xe2\x80\x99s poultry.\r\n\r\n\r\n[10] OUT OF FORTY-NINE SUITS WHICH HE HAD, HE NEVER LOST ONE BUT\r\nSEVENTEEN.--Thady\xe2\x80\x99s language in this instance is a specimen of a mode\r\nof rhetoric common in Ireland. An astonishing assertion is made in the\r\nbeginning of a sentence, which ceases to be in the least surprising,\r\nwhen you hear the qualifying explanation that follows. Thus a man who\r\nis in the last stage of staggering drunkenness will, if he can\r\narticulate, swear to you--\xe2\x80\x98Upon his conscience now, and may he never\r\nstir from the spot alive if he is telling a lie, upon his conscience he\r\nhas not tasted a drop of anything, good or bad, since morning\r\nat-all-at-all, but half a pint of whisky, please your honour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n[11]. FAIRY MOUNTS--Barrows. It is said that these high mounts were of great service to\r\nthe natives of Ireland when Ireland was invaded by the Danes. Watch was\r\nalways kept on them, and upon the approach of an enemy a fire was\r\nlighted to give notice to the next watch, and thus the intelligence was\r\nquickly communicated through the country. SOME YEARS AGO, the common\r\npeople believed that these barrows were inhabited by fairies, or, as\r\nthey called them, by the GOOD PEOPLE. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, troth, to the best of my\r\nbelief, and to the best of my judgment and opinion,\xe2\x80\x99 said an elderly man\r\nto the Editor, \xe2\x80\x98it was only the old people that had nothing to do, and\r\ngot together, and were telling stories about them fairies, but to the\r\nbest of my judgment there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in it. Only this I heard myself not\r\nvery many years back from a decent kind of a man, a grazier, that, as he\r\nwas coming just FAIR AND EASY (QUIETLY) from the fair, with some cattle\r\nand sheep, that he had not sold, just at the church of ---at an angle of\r\nthe road like, he was met by a good-looking man, who asked him where he\r\nwas going? And he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, far enough, I must be going all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cNo, that you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t nor won\xe2\x80\x99t (says the man), you\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep with me the\r\nnight, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll want for nothing, nor your cattle nor sheep neither,\r\nnor your BEAST (HORSE); so come along with me.\xe2\x80\x9d With that the grazier\r\nLIT (ALIGHTED) from his horse, and it was dark night; but presently he\r\nfinds himself, he does not know in the wide world how, in a fine house,\r\nand plenty of everything to eat and drink; nothing at all wanting that\r\nhe could wish for or think of. And he does not MIND (RECOLLECT or KNOW)\r\nhow at last he falls asleep; and in the morning he finds himself lying,\r\nnot in ever a bed or a house at all, but just in the angle of the road\r\nwhere first he met the strange man: there he finds himself lying on his\r\nback on the grass, and all his sheep feeding as quiet as ever all round\r\nabout him, and his horse the same way, and the bridle of the beast over\r\nhis wrist. And I asked him what he thought of it; and from first to last\r\nhe could think of nothing, but for certain sure it must have been the\r\nfairies that entertained him so well. For there was no house to see\r\nanywhere nigh hand, or any building, or barn, or place at all, but only\r\nthe church and the MOTE (BARROW). There\xe2\x80\x99s another odd thing enough that\r\nthey tell about this same church, that if any person\xe2\x80\x99s corpse, that had\r\nnot a right to be buried in that churchyard, went to be burying there in\r\nit, no, not all the men, women, or childer in all Ireland could get the\r\ncorpse anyway into the churchyard; but as they would be trying to go\r\ninto the churchyard, their feet would seem to be going backwards instead\r\nof forwards; ay, continually backwards the whole funeral would seem to\r\ngo; and they would never set foot with the corpse in the churchyard. Now\r\nthey say that it is the fairies do all this; but it is my opinion it is\r\nall idle talk, and people are after being wiser now.\r\n\r\nThe country people in Ireland certainly HAD great admiration mixed with\r\nreverence, if not dread, of fairies. They believed that beneath these\r\nfairy mounts were spacious subterraneous palaces, inhabited by THE GOOD\r\nPEOPLE, who must not on any account be disturbed. When the wind raises\r\na little eddy of dust upon the road, the poor people believe that it is\r\nraised by the fairies, that it is a sign that they are journeying from\r\none of the fairies\xe2\x80\x99 mounts to another, and they say to the fairies, or\r\nto the dust as it passes, \xe2\x80\x98God speed ye, gentlemen; God speed ye.\xe2\x80\x99 This\r\naverts any evil that THE GOOD PEOPLE might be inclined to do them. There\r\nare innumerable stories told of the friendly and unfriendly feats of\r\nthese busy fairies; some of these tales are ludicrous, and some romantic\r\nenough for poetry. It is a pity that poets should lose such convenient,\r\nthough diminutive machinery. By the bye, Parnell, who showed himself\r\nso deeply \xe2\x80\x98skilled in faerie lore,\xe2\x80\x99 was an Irishman; and though he\r\nhas presented his fairies to the world in the ancient English dress\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98Britain\xe2\x80\x99s isle, and Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s days,\xe2\x80\x99 it is probable that his first\r\nacquaintance with them began in his native country.\r\n\r\nSome remote origin for the most superstitious or romantic popular\r\nillusions or vulgar errors may often be discovered. In Ireland, the old\r\nchurches and churchyards have been usually fixed upon as the scenes of\r\nwonders. Now antiquaries tell us, that near the ancient churches in\r\nthat kingdom caves of various constructions have from time to time been\r\ndiscovered, which were formerly used as granaries or magazines by the\r\nancient inhabitants, and as places to which they retreated in time\r\nof danger. There is (p.84 of the R. I. A. TRANSACTIONS for 1789) a\r\nparticular account of a number of these artificial caves at the west\r\nend of the church of Killossy, in the county of Kildare. Under a rising\r\nground, in a dry sandy soil, these subterraneous dwellings were found:\r\nthey have pediment roofs, and they communicate with each other by small\r\napertures. In the Brehon laws these are mentioned, and there are fines\r\ninflicted by those laws upon persons who steal from the subterraneous\r\ngranaries. All these things show that there was a real foundation for\r\nthe stories which were told of the appearance of lights, and of the\r\nsounds of voices, near these places. The persons who had property\r\nconcealed there, very willingly countenanced every wonderful relation\r\nthat tended to make these places objects of sacred awe or superstitious\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n\r\n[12] WEED ASHES.--By ancient usage in Ireland, all the weeds on a farm\r\nbelonged to the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife, or to the wife of the squire who holds\r\nthe ground in his own hands. The great demand for alkaline salts in\r\nbleaching rendered these ashes no inconsiderable perquisite.\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] SEALING MONEY.--Formerly it was the custom in Ireland for tenants\r\nto give the squire\xe2\x80\x99s lady from two to fifty guineas as a perquisite\r\nupon the sealing of their leases. The Editor not very long since knew\r\nof a baronet\xe2\x80\x99s lady accepting fifty guineas as sealing money, upon\r\nclosing a bargain for a considerable farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[14] SIR MURTAGH GREW MAD--Sir Murtagh grew angry.\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] THE WHOLE KITCHEN WAS OUT ON THE STAIRS--means that all the\r\ninhabitants of the kitchen came out of the kitchen, and stood upon the\r\nstairs. These, and similar expressions, show how much the Irish are\r\ndisposed to metaphor and amplification.\r\n\r\n\r\n[16] FINING DOWN THE YEAR\xe2\x80\x99S RENT.--When an Irish gentleman, like Sir\r\nKit Rackrent, has lived beyond his income, and finds himself distressed\r\nfor ready money, tenants obligingly offer to take his land at a rent\r\nfar below the value, and to pay him a small sum of money in hand, which\r\nthey call fining down the yearly rent. The temptation of this ready\r\ncash often blinds the landlord to his future interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n[17] DRIVER.--A man who is employed to drive tenants for rent; that is,\r\nto drive the cattle belonging to tenants to pound. The office of driver\r\nis by no means a sinecure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[18] I THOUGHT TO MAKE HIM A PRIEST.--It was customary amongst those of Thady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrank in Ireland, whenever they could get a little money, to send their sons\r\nabroad to St. Omer\xe2\x80\x99s, or to Spain, to be educated as priests. Now they are\r\neducated at Maynooth. The Editor has lately known a young lad, who began by\r\nbeing a post-boy, afterwards turn into a carpenter, then quit his plane and\r\nwork-bench to study his HUMANITIES, as he said, at the college of Maynooth; but\r\nafter he had gone through his course of Humanities, he determined to be a\r\nsoldier instead of a priest.\r\n\r\n\r\n[19] FLAM.--Short for flambeau.\r\n\r\n\r\n[20] BARRACK-ROOM.--Formerly it was customary, in gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s houses in\r\nIreland, to fit up one large bedchamber with a number of beds for the\r\nreception of occasional visitors. These rooms were called\r\nBarrack-rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n[21] AN INNOCENT--in Ireland, means a simpleton, an idiot.\r\n\r\n\r\n[22] THE CURRAGH--is the Newmarket of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n[23] THE CANT--The auction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[24]AND SO SHOULD CUT HIM OFF FOR EVER BY LEVYING A FINE, AND SUFFERING\r\nA RECOVERY TO DOCK THE ENTAIL.--The English reader may perhaps be\r\nsurprised at the extent of Thady\xe2\x80\x99s legal knowledge, and at the fluency\r\nwith which he pours forth law-terms; but almost every poor man in\r\nIreland, be he farmer, weaver, shopkeeper, ox steward, is, besides his\r\nother occupations, occasionally a lawyer. The nature of processes,\r\nejectments, custodiams, injunctions, replevins, etc., is perfectly\r\nknown to them, and the terms as familiar to them as to any attorney.\r\nThey all love law. It is a kind of lottery, in which every man, staking\r\nhis own wit or cunning against his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s property, feels that he\r\nhas little to lose, and much to gain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the law of you, so I will!\xe2\x80\x99 is the saying of an Englishman\r\nwho expects justice. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you before his honour,\xe2\x80\x99 is the threat of\r\nan Irishman who hopes for partiality. Miserable is the life of a justice\r\nof the peace in Ireland the day after a fair, especially if he resides\r\nnear a small town. The multitude of the KILT (KILT does not mean KILLED,\r\nbut hurt) and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or\r\nbloody heads is astonishing: but more astonishing is the number of those\r\nwho, though they are scarcely able by daily labour to procure daily\r\nfood, will nevertheless, without the least reluctance, waste six or\r\nseven hours of the day lounging in the yard or court of a justice of the\r\npeace, waiting to make some complaint about--nothing. It is impossible\r\nto convince them that TIME IS MONEY. They do not set any value upon\r\ntheir own time, and they think that others estimate theirs at less than\r\nnothing. Hence they make no scruple of telling a justice of the peace\r\na story of an hour long about a tester (sixpence); and if he grows\r\nimpatient, they attribute it to some secret prejudice which he\r\nentertains against them.\r\n\r\nTheir method is to get a story completely by heart, and to tell it, as\r\nthey call it, OUT OF THE FACE, that is, from the beginning to the end,\r\nwithout interruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my good friend, I have seen you lounging about these three hours\r\nin the yard; what is your business?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please your honour, it is what I want to speak one word to your\r\nhonour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Speak then, but be quick. What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The matter, please your honour, is nothing at-all-at-all, only just\r\nabout the grazing of a horse, please your honour, that this man here\r\nsold me at the fair of Gurtishannon last Shrove fair, which lay down\r\nthree times with myself, please your honour, and KILT me; not to be\r\ntelling your honour of how, no later back than yesterday night, he lay\r\ndown in the house there within, and all the childer standing round, and\r\nit was God\xe2\x80\x99s mercy he did not fall a-top of them, or into the fire to\r\nburn himself. So please your honour, to-day I took him back to this man,\r\nwhich owned him, and after a great deal to do, I got the mare again I\r\nSWOPPED (EXCHANGED) him for; but he won\xe2\x80\x99t pay the grazing of the horse\r\nfor the time I had him, though he promised to pay the grazing in case\r\nthe horse didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer; and he never did a day\xe2\x80\x99s work, good or bad,\r\nplease your honour, all the time he was with me, and I had the doctor to\r\nhim five times anyhow. And so, please your honour, it is what I expect\r\nyour honour will stand my friend, for I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner come to your honour\r\nfor justice than to any other in all Ireland. And so I brought him here\r\nbefore your honour, and expect your honour will make him pay me the\r\ngrazing, or tell me, can I process him for it at the next assizes,\r\nplease your honour?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe defendant now turning a quid of tobacco with his tongue into some\r\nsecret cavern in his mouth, begins his defence with--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please your honour, under favour, and saving your honour\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s not a word of truth in all this man has been saying from\r\nbeginning to end, upon my conscience, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t for the value of\r\nthe horse itself, grazing and all, be after telling your honour a lie.\r\nFor, please your honour, I have a dependence upon your honour that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll do me justice, and not be listening to him or the like of him.\r\nPlease your honour, it\xe2\x80\x99s what he has brought me before your honour,\r\nbecause he had a spite against me about some oats I sold your honour,\r\nwhich he was jealous of, and a shawl his wife got at my shister\xe2\x80\x99s shop\r\nthere without, and never paid for; so I offered to set the shawl against\r\nthe grazing, and give him a receipt in full of all demands, but he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t out of spite, please your honour; so he brought me before your\r\nhonour, expecting your honour was mad with me for cutting down the\r\ntree in the horse park, which was none of my doing, please your\r\nhonour--ill-luck to them that went and belied me to your honour behind\r\nmy back! So if your honour is pleasing, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the whole truth\r\nabout the horse that he swopped against my mare out of the face. Last\r\nShrove fair I met this man, Jemmy Duffy, please your honour, just at the\r\ncorner of the road, where the bridge is broken down, that your honour is\r\nto have the presentment for this year--long life to you for it! And he\r\nwas at that time coming from the fair of Gurtishannon, and I the same\r\nway. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, Jemmy?\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I thank ye kindly,\r\nBryan,\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9cshall we turn back to Paddy Salmon\xe2\x80\x99s and take a naggin\r\nof whisky to our better acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care if I did, Jemmy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says I; \xe2\x80\x9conly it is what I can\xe2\x80\x99t take the whisky, because I\xe2\x80\x99m under an\r\noath against it for a month.\xe2\x80\x9d Ever since, please your honour, the day\r\nyour honour met me on the road, and observed to me I could hardly stand,\r\nI had taken so much; though upon my conscience your honour wronged me\r\ngreatly that same time--ill-luck to them that belied me behind my back\r\nto your honour! Well, please your honour, as I was telling you, as he\r\nwas taking the whisky, and we talking of one thing or t\xe2\x80\x99other, he\r\nmakes me an offer to swop his mare that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell at the fair of\r\nGurtishannon, because nobody would be troubled with the beast, please\r\nyour honour, against my horse, and to oblige him I took the mare--sorrow\r\ntake her! and him along with her! She kicked me a new car, that was\r\nworth three pounds ten, to tatters the first time I ever put her into\r\nit, and I expect your honour will make him pay me the price of the\r\ncar, anyhow, before I pay the grazing, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve no right to pay\r\nat-all-at-all, only to oblige him. But I leave it all to your honour;\r\nand the whole grazing he ought to be charging for the beast is but two\r\nand eightpence halfpenny, anyhow, please your honour. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll abide by\r\nwhat your honour says, good or bad. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it all to your honour.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave IT all to your honour--literally means, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave all the\r\ntrouble to your honour.\r\n\r\nThe Editor knew a justice of the peace in Ireland who had such a\r\ndread of HAVING IT ALL LEFT TO HIS HONOUR, that he frequently gave the\r\ncomplainants the sum about which they were disputing, to make peace\r\nbetween them, and to get rid of the trouble of hearing their stories\r\nOUT OF THE FACE. But he was soon cured of this method of buying off\r\ndisputes, by the increasing multitude of those who, out of pure regard\r\nto his honour, came \xe2\x80\x98to get justice from him, because they would sooner\r\ncome before him than before any man in all Ireland.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n[25] A RAKING POT OF TEA.--We should observe, this custom has long\r\nsince been banished from the higher orders of Irish gentry. The\r\nmysteries of a raking pot of tea, like those of the Bona Dea, are\r\nsupposed to be sacred to females; but now and then it has happened that\r\nsome of the male species, who were either more audacious, or more\r\nhighly favoured than the rest of their sex, have been admitted by\r\nstealth to these orgies. The time when the festive ceremony begins\r\nvaries according to circumstances, but it is never earlier than twelve\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock at night; the joys of a raking pot of tea depending on its\r\nbeing made in secret, and at an unseasonable hour. After a ball, when\r\nthe more discreet part of the company has departed to rest, a few\r\nchosen female spirits, who have footed it till they can foot it no\r\nlonger, and till the sleepy notes expire under the slurring hand of the\r\nmusician, retire to a bedchamber, call the favourite maid, who alone is\r\nadmitted, bid her PUT DOWN THE KETTLE, lock the door, and amidst as\r\nmuch giggling and scrambling as possible, they get round a tea-table,\r\non which all manner of things are huddled together. Then begin mutual\r\nrailleries and mutual confidences amongst the young ladies, and the\r\nfaint scream and the loud laugh is heard, and the romping for letters\r\nand pocket-books begins, and gentlemen are called by their surnames, or\r\nby the general name of fellows! pleasant fellows! charming fellows!\r\nodious fellows! abominable fellows! and then all prudish decorums are\r\nforgotten, and then we might be convinced how much the satirical poet\r\nwas mistaken when he said--\r\n\r\nThere is no woman where there\xe2\x80\x99s no reserve.\r\n\r\nThe merit of the original idea of a raking pot of tea evidently belongs\r\nto the washerwoman and the laundry-maid. But why should not we have LOW\r\nLIFE ABOVE STAIRS as well as HIGH LIFE BELOW STAIRS?\r\n\r\n\r\n[26] WE GAINED THE DAY BY THIS PIECE OF HONESTY.--In a dispute which\r\noccurred some years ago in Ireland, between Mr. E. and Mr. M., about\r\nthe boundaries of a farm, an old tenant of Mr. M.\xe2\x80\x99s cut a SOD from Mr.\r\nM.\xe2\x80\x99s land, and inserted it in a spot prepared for its reception in Mr.\r\nE.\xe2\x80\x99s land; so nicely was it inserted, that no eye could detect the\r\njunction of the grass. The old man, who was to give his evidence as to\r\nthe property, stood upon the inserted sod when the VIEWERS came, and\r\nswore that the ground he THEN STOOD UPON belonged to his landlord, Mr.\r\nM.\r\n\r\nThe Editor had flattered himself that the ingenious contrivance which\r\nThady records, and the similar subterfuge of this old Irishman, in the\r\ndispute concerning boundaries, were instances of \xe2\x80\x99CUTENESS unparalleled\r\nin all but Irish story: an English friend, however, has just mortified\r\nthe Editor\xe2\x80\x99s national vanity by an account of the following custom,\r\nwhich prevails in part of Shropshire. It is discreditable for women\r\nto appear abroad after the birth of their children till they have been\r\nCHURCHED. To avoid this reproach, and at the same time to enjoy the\r\npleasure of gadding, whenever a woman goes abroad before she has been\r\nto church, she takes a tile from the roof of her house, and puts it upon\r\nher head: wearing this panoply all the time she pays her visits, her\r\nconscience is perfectly at ease; for she can afterwards safely declare\r\nto the clergyman, that she \xe2\x80\x98has never been from under her own roof till\r\nshe came to be churched.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n[27] CARTON AND HALF-CARTON,--Thady means cartron, and half-cartron.\r\nAccording to the old record in the black book of Dublin, a CANTRED is\r\nsaid to contain 30 VILLATAS TERRAS, which are also called QUARTERS of\r\nland (quarterons, CARTRONS); every one of which quarters must contain\r\nso much ground as will pasture 400 cows, and 17 plough-lands. A\r\nknight\xe2\x80\x99s fee was composed of 8 hydes, which amount to 160 acres, and\r\nthat is generally deemed about a PLOUGH- LAND.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Editor was favoured by a learned friend with the above extract, from\r\na MS. of Lord Totness\xe2\x80\x99s in the Lambeth library.\r\n\r\n\r\n[28] WAKE.--A wake in England means a festival held upon the\r\nanniversary of the saint of the parish. At these wakes, rustic games,\r\nrustic conviviality, and rustic courtship, are pursued with all the\r\nardour and all the appetite which accompany such pleasures as occur but\r\nseldom. In Ireland a wake is a midnight meeting, held professedly for\r\nthe indulgence of holy sorrow, but usually it is converted into orgies\r\nof unholy joy. When an Irish man or woman of the lower order dies, the\r\nstraw which composed the bed, whether it has been contained in a bag to\r\nform a mattress, or simply spread upon the earthen floor, is\r\nimmediately taken out of the house, and burned before the cabin door,\r\nthe family at the same time setting up the death howl. The ears and\r\neyes of the neighbours being thus alarmed, they flock to the house of\r\nthe deceased, and by their vociferous sympathy excite and at the same\r\ntime soothe the sorrows of the family.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe how good and bad are mingled in human\r\ninstitutions. In countries which were thinly inhabited, this custom\r\nprevented private attempts against the lives of individuals, and formed\r\na kind of coroner\xe2\x80\x99s inquest upon the body which had recently expired,\r\nand burning the straw upon which the sick man lay became a simple\r\npreservative against infection. At night the dead body is waked, that is\r\nto say, all the friends and neighbours of the deceased collect in a barn\r\nor stable, where the corpse is laid upon some boards, or an unhinged\r\ndoor, supported upon stools, the face exposed, the rest of the\r\nbody covered with a white sheet. Round the body are stuck in brass\r\ncandlesticks, which have been borrowed perhaps at five miles\xe2\x80\x99 distance,\r\nas many candles as the poor person can beg or borrow, observing always\r\nto have an odd number. Pipes and tobacco are first distributed, and\r\nthen, according to the ABILITY of the deceased, cakes and ale, and\r\nsometimes whisky, are DEALT to the company--\r\n\r\n     Deal on, deal on, my merry men all,\r\n       Deal on your cakes and your wine,\r\n     For whatever is dealt at her funeral to-day\r\n       Shall be dealt to-morrow at mine.\r\n\r\nAfter a fit of universal sorrow, and the comfort of a universal dram,\r\nthe scandal of the neighbourhood, as in higher circles, occupies the\r\ncompany. The young lads and lasses romp with one another, and when the\r\nfathers and mothers are at last overcome with sleep and whisky (VINO\r\nET SOMNO), the youth become more enterprising, and are frequently\r\nsuccessful. It is said that more matches are made at wakes than at\r\nweddings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[29] KILT.--This word frequently occurs in the preceding pages, where\r\nit means not KILLED, but much HURT. In Ireland, not only cowards, but\r\nthe brave \xe2\x80\x98die many times before their death.\xe2\x80\x99--There KILLING IS NO\r\nMURDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CASTLE RACKRENT ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
