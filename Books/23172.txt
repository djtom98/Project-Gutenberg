From "In the Midst of Life," copyright, 1898,\r\nby G. P. Putnam\'s Sons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBy THE light of a tallow candle, which had been placed on one end of a\r\nrough table, a man was reading something written in a book. It was an\r\nold account book, greatly worn; and the writing was not, apparently,\r\nvery legible, for the man sometimes held the page close to the flame of\r\nthe candle to get a stronger light upon it. The shadow of the book would\r\nthen throw into obscurity a half of the room, darkening a number of\r\nfaces and figures; for besides the reader, eight other men were present.\r\nSeven of them sat against the rough log walls, silent and motionless,\r\nand, the room being small, not very far from the table. By extending an\r\narm any one of them could have touched the eighth man, who lay on the\r\ntable, face upward, partly covered by a sheet, his arms at his sides. He\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\nThe man with the book was not reading aloud, and no one spoke; all\r\nseemed to be waiting for something to occur; the dead man only was\r\nwithout expectation. From the blank darkness outside came in, through\r\nthe aperture that served for a window, all the ever unfamiliar noises\r\nof night in the wilderness--the long, nameless note of a distant coyote;\r\nthe stilly pulsing thrill of tireless insects in trees; strange cries of\r\nnight birds, so different from those of the birds of day; the drone of\r\ngreat blundering beetles, and all that mysterious chorus of small sounds\r\nthat seem always to have been but half heard when they have suddenly\r\nceased, as if conscious of an indiscretion. But nothing of all this was\r\nnoted in that company; its members were not overmuch addicted to idle\r\ninterest in matters of no practical importance; that was obvious in\r\nevery line of their rugged faces--obvious even in the dim light of the\r\nsingle candle. They were evidently men of the vicinity--farmers and\r\nwoodmen.\r\n\r\nThe person reading was a trifle different; one would have said of him\r\nthat he was of the world, worldly, albeit there was that in his\r\nattire which attested a certain fellowship with the organisms of his\r\nenvironment. His coat would hardly have passed muster in San Francisco:\r\nhis footgear was not of urban origin, and the hat that lay by him on\r\nthe floor (he was the only one uncovered) was such that if one had\r\nconsidered it as an article of mere personal adornment he would have\r\nmissed its meaning. In countenance the man was rather prepossessing,\r\nwith just a hint of sternness; though that he may have assumed or\r\ncultivated, as appropriate to one in authority. For he was a coroner. It\r\nwas by virtue of his office that he had possession of the book in which\r\nhe was reading; it had been found among the dead man\'s effects--in his\r\ncabin, where the inquest was now taking place.\r\n\r\nWhen the coroner had finished reading he put the book into his breast\r\npocket. At that moment the door was pushed open and a young man entered.\r\nHe, clearly, was not of mountain birth and breeding: he was clad as\r\nthose who dwell in cities. His clothing was dusty, however, as from\r\ntravel. He had, in fact, been riding hard to attend the inquest.\r\n\r\nThe coroner nodded; no one else greeted him.\r\n\r\n"We have waited for you," said the coroner. "It is necessary to have\r\ndone with this business to-night."\r\n\r\nThe young man smiled. "I am sorry to have kept you," he said. "I went\r\naway, not to evade your summons, but to post to my newspaper an account\r\nof what I suppose I am called back to relate."\r\n\r\nThe coroner smiled.\r\n\r\n"The account that you posted to your newspaper," he said, "differs\r\nprobably from that which you will give here under oath."\r\n\r\n"That," replied the other, rather hotly and with a visible flush, "is as\r\nyou choose. I used manifold paper and have a copy of what I sent. It was\r\nnot written as news, for it is incredible, but as fiction. It may go as\r\na part of my testimony under oath."\r\n\r\n"But you say it is incredible."\r\n\r\n"That is nothing to you, sir, if I also swear that it is true."\r\n\r\nThe coroner was apparently not greatly affected by the young man\'s\r\nmanifest resentment. He was silent for some moments, his eyes upon the\r\nfloor. The men about the sides of the cabin talked in whispers, but\r\nseldom withdrew their gaze from the face of the corpse. Presently the\r\ncoroner lifted his eyes and said: "We will resume the inquest."\r\n\r\nThe men removed their hats. The witness was sworn.\r\n\r\n"What is your name?" the coroner asked.\r\n\r\n"William Harker."\r\n\r\n"Age?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty-seven."\r\n\r\n"You knew the deceased, Hugh Morgan?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You were with him when he died?"\r\n\r\n"Near him."\r\n\r\n"How did that happen--your presence, I mean?"\r\n\r\n"I was visiting him at this place to shoot and fish. A part of my\r\npurpose, however, was to study him, and his odd, solitary way of life.\r\nHe seemed a good model for a character in fiction. I sometimes write\r\nstories."\r\n\r\n"I sometimes read them."\r\n\r\n"Thank you."\r\n\r\n"Stories in general--not yours."\r\n\r\nSome of the jurors laughed. Against a sombre background humor shows high\r\nlights. Soldiers in the intervals of battle laugh easily, and a jest in\r\nthe death chamber conquers by surprise.\r\n\r\n"Relate the circumstances of this man\'s death," said the coroner. "You\r\nmay use any notes or memoranda that you please."\r\n\r\nThe witness understood. Pulling a manuscript from his breast pocket\r\nhe held it near the candle, and turning the leaves until he found the\r\npassage that he wanted, began to read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n"...The sun had hardly risen when we left the house. We were looking for\r\nquail, each with a shotgun, but we had only one dog. Morgan said that\r\nour best ground was beyond a certain ridge that he pointed out, and we\r\ncrossed it by a trail through the _chaparral_. On the other side was\r\ncomparatively level ground, thickly covered with wild oats. As we\r\nemerged from the _chaparral_, Morgan was but a few yards in advance.\r\nSuddenly, we heard, at a little distance to our right, and partly in\r\nfront, a noise as of some animal thrashing about in the bushes, which we\r\ncould see were violently agitated.\r\n\r\n"\'We\'ve started a deer,\' said. \'I wish we had brought a rifle.\'\r\n\r\n"Morgan, who had stopped and was intently watching the agitated\r\nchaparral, said nothing, but had cocked both barrels of his gun, and was\r\nholding it in readiness to aim. I thought him a trifle excited, which\r\nsurprised me, for he had a reputation for exceptional coolness, even in\r\nmoments of sudden and imminent peril.\r\n\r\n"\'O, come!\' I said. \'You are not going to fill up a deer with\r\nquail-shot, are you?\'\r\n\r\n"Still he did not reply; but, catching a sight of his face as he\r\nturned it slightly toward me, I was struck by the pallor of it. Then I\r\nunderstood that we had serious business on hand, and my first conjecture\r\nwas that we had \'jumped\' a grizzly. I advanced to Morgan\'s side, cocking\r\nmy piece as I moved.\r\n\r\n"The bushes were now quiet, and the sounds had ceased, but Morgan was as\r\nattentive to the place as before.\r\n\r\n"\'What is it? What the devil is it?\' I asked.\r\n\r\n"\'That Damned Thing!\' he replied, without turning his head. His voice\r\nwas husky and unnatural. He trembled visibly.\r\n\r\n"I was about to speak further, when I observed the wild oats near the\r\nplace of the disturbance moving in the most inexplicable way. I can\r\nhardly describe it. It seemed as if stirred by a streak of wind, which\r\nnot only bent it, but pressed it down--crushed it so that it did not\r\nrise, and this movement was slowly prolonging itself directly toward us.\r\n\r\n"Nothing that I had ever seen had affected me so strangely as this\r\nunfamiliar and unaccountable phenomenon, yet I am unable to recall any\r\nsense of fear. I remember--and tell it here because, singularly enough,\r\nI recollected it then--that once, in looking carelessly out of an open\r\nwindow, I momentarily mistook a small tree close at hand for one of a\r\ngroup of larger trees at a little distance away. It looked the same size\r\nas the others, but, being more distinctly and sharply defined in mass\r\nand detail, seemed out of harmony with them. It was a mere falsification\r\nof the law of aerial perspective, but it startled, almost terrified me.\r\nWe so rely upon the orderly operation of familiar natural laws that any\r\nseeming suspension of them is noted as a menace to our safety, a warning\r\nof unthinkable calamity. So now the apparently causeless movement of the\r\nherbage, and the slow, undeviating approach of the line of disturbance\r\nwere distinctly disquieting. My companion appeared actually frightened,\r\nand I could hardly credit my senses when I saw him suddenly throw his\r\ngun to his shoulders and fire both barrels at the agitated grass! Before\r\nthe smoke of the discharge had cleared away I heard a loud savage\r\ncry--a scream like that of a wild animal--and, flinging his gun upon the\r\nground, Morgan sprang away and ran swiftly from the spot. At the same\r\ninstant I was thrown violently to the ground by the impact of something\r\nunseen in the smoke--some soft, heavy substance that seemed thrown\r\nagainst me with great force.\r\n\r\n"Before I could get upon my feet and recover my gun, which seemed to\r\nhave been struck from my hands, I heard Morgan crying out as if in\r\nmortal agony, and mingling with his cries were such hoarse savage sounds\r\nas one hears from fighting dogs. Inexpressibly terrified, I struggled to\r\nmy feet and looked in the direction of Morgan\'s retreat; and may heaven\r\nin mercy spare me from another sight like that! At a distance of less\r\nthan thirty yards was my friend, down upon one knee, his head thrown\r\nback at a frightful angle, hatless, his long hair in disorder and his\r\nwhole body in violent movement from side to side, backward and forward.\r\nHis right arm was lifted and seemed to lack the hand--at least, I\r\ncould see none. The other arm was invisible. At times, as my memory\r\nnow reports this extraordinary scene, I could discern but a part of his\r\nbody; it was as if he had been partly blotted out--I can not otherwise\r\nexpress it--then a shifting of his position would bring it all into view\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"All this must have occurred within a few seconds, yet in that time\r\nMorgan assumed all the postures of a determined wrestler vanquished by\r\nsuperior weight and strength. I saw nothing but him, and him not always\r\ndistinctly. During the entire incident his shouts and curses were heard,\r\nas if through an enveloping uproar of such sounds of rage and fury as I\r\nhad never heard from the throat of man or brute!\r\n\r\n"For a moment only I stood irresolute, then, throwing down my gun, I\r\nran forward to my friend\'s assistance. I had a vague belief that he was\r\nsuffering from a fit or some form of convulsion. Before I could reach\r\nhis side he was down and quiet. All sounds had ceased, but, with a\r\nfeeling of such terror as even these awful events had not inspired, I\r\nnow saw the same mysterious movement of the wild oats prolonging itself\r\nfrom the trampled area about the prostrate man toward the edge of\r\na wood. It was only when it had reached the wood that I was able to\r\nwithdraw my eyes and look at my companion. He was dead."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe coroner rose from his seat and stood beside the dead man. Lifting\r\nan edge of the sheet he pulled it away, exposing the entire body,\r\naltogether naked and showing in the candle light a clay-like yellow. It\r\nhad, however, broad maculations of bluish-black, obviously caused by\r\nextravasated blood from contusions. The chest and sides looked as if\r\nthey had been beaten with a bludgeon. There were dreadful lacerations;\r\nthe skin was torn in strips and shreds.\r\n\r\nThe coroner moved round to the end of the table and undid a silk\r\nhandkerchief, which had been passed under the chin and knotted on the\r\ntop of the head. When the handkerchief was drawn away it exposed what\r\nhad been the throat. Some of the jurors who had risen to get a better\r\nview repented their curiosity, and turned away their faces. Witness\r\nHarker went to the open window and leaned out across the sill, faint and\r\nsick. Dropping the handkerchief upon the dead man\'s neck, the coroner\r\nstepped to an angle of the room, and from a pile of clothing produced\r\none garment after another, each of which he held up a moment for\r\ninspection. All were torn, and stiff with blood. The jurors did not\r\nmake a closer inspection. They seemed rather uninterested. They had, in\r\ntruth, seen all this before; the only thing that was new to them being\r\nHarker\'s testimony.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," the coroner said, "we have no more evidence, I think. Your\r\nduty has been already explained to you; if there is nothing you wish to\r\nask you may go outside and consider your verdict."\r\n\r\nThe foreman rose--a tall, bearded man of sixty, coarsely clad.\r\n\r\n"I should like to ask one question, Mr. Coroner," he said. "What asylum\r\ndid this yer last witness escape from?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Harker," said the coroner, gravely and tranquilly, "from what\r\nasylum did you last escape?"\r\n\r\nHarker flushed crimson again, but said nothing, and the seven jurors\r\nrose and solemnly filed out of the cabin.\r\n\r\n"If you have done insulting me, sir," said Harker, as soon as he and the\r\nofficer were left alone with the dead man, "I suppose I am at liberty to\r\ngo?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nHarker started to leave, but paused, with his hand on the door latch.\r\nThe habit of his profession was strong in him--stronger than his sense\r\nof personal dignity. He turned about and said:\r\n\r\n"The book that you have there--I recognize it as Morgan\'s diary. You\r\nseemed greatly interested in it; you read in it while I was testifying.\r\nMay I see it? The public would like--"\r\n\r\n"The book will cut no figure in this matter," replied the official,\r\nslipping it into his coat pocket; "all the entries in it were made\r\nbefore the writer\'s death."\r\n\r\nAs Harker passed out of the house the jury reentered and stood about the\r\ntable on which the now covered corpse showed under the sheet with sharp\r\ndefinition. The foreman seated himself near the candle, produced\r\nfrom his breast pocket a pencil and scrap of paper, and wrote rather\r\nlaboriously the following verdict, which with various degrees of effort\r\nall signed:\r\n\r\n"We, the jury, do find that the remains come to their death at the hands\r\nof a mountain lion, but some of us thinks, all the same, they had fits."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn the diary of the late Hugh Morgan are certain interesting entries\r\nhaving, possibly, a scientific value as suggestions. At the inquest upon\r\nhis body the book was not put in evidence; possibly the coroner thought\r\nit not worth while to confuse the jury. The date of the first of the\r\nentries mentioned can not be ascertained; the upper part of the leaf is\r\ntorn away; the part of the entry remaining is as follows:\r\n\r\n"... would run in a half circle, keeping his head turned always toward\r\nthe centre and again he would stand still, barking furiously. At last he\r\nran away into the brush as fast as he could go. I thought at first that\r\nhe had gone mad, but on returning to the house found no other alteration\r\nin his manner than what was obviously due to fear of punishment.\r\n\r\n"Can a dog see with his nose? Do odors impress some olfactory centre\r\nwith images of the thing emitting them? . . .\r\n\r\n"Sept 2.--Looking at the stars last night as they rose above the\r\ncrest of the ridge east of the house, I observed them successively\r\ndisappear--from left to right. Each was eclipsed but an instant, and\r\nonly a few at the same time, but along the entire length of the ridge\r\nall that were within a degree or two of the crest were blotted out. It\r\nwas as if something had passed along between me and them; but I could\r\nnot see it, and the stars were not thick enough to define its outline.\r\nUgh! I don\'t like this. . . ."\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks\' entries are missing, three leaves being torn from the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n"Sept. 27.--It has been about here again--I find evidences of its\r\npresence every day. I watched again all of last night in the same cover,\r\ngun in hand, double-charged with buckshot. In the morning the fresh\r\nfootprints were there, as before. Yet I would have sworn that I did not\r\nsleep--indeed, I hardly sleep at all. It is terrible, insupportable! If\r\nthese amazing experiences are real I shall go mad; if they are fanciful\r\nI am mad already.\r\n\r\n"Oct. 3.--I shall not go--it shall not drive me away. No, this is _my_\r\nhouse, my land. God hates a coward....\r\n\r\n"Oct. 5.--I can stand it no longer; I have invited Harker to pass a few\r\nweeks with me--he has a level head. I can judge from his manner if he\r\nthinks me mad.\r\n\r\n"Oct. 7.--I have the solution of the problem; it came to me last\r\nnight--suddenly, as by revelation. How simple--how terribly simple!\r\n\r\n"There are sounds that we can not hear. At either end of the scale are\r\nnotes that stir no chord of that imperfect instrument, the human ear.\r\nThey are too high or too grave. I have observed a flock of blackbirds\r\noccupying an entire treetop--the tops of several trees--and all in full\r\nsong. Suddenly--in a moment--at absolutely the same instant--all\r\nspring into the air and fly away. How? They could not all see one\r\nanother--whole treetops intervened. At no point could a leader have been\r\nvisible to all. There must have been a signal of warning or command,\r\nhigh and shrill above the din, but by me unheard. I have observed,\r\ntoo, the same simultaneous flight when all were silent, among not only\r\nblackbirds, but other birds--quail, for example, widely separated by\r\nbushes--even on opposite sides of a hill.\r\n\r\n"It is known to seamen that a school of whales basking or sporting on\r\nthe surface of the ocean, miles apart, with the convexity of the earth\r\nbetween them, will sometimes dive at the same instant--all gone out of\r\nsight in a moment. The signal has been sounded--too grave for the ear\r\nof the sailor at the masthead and his comrades on the deck--who\r\nnevertheless feel its vibrations in the ship as the stones of a\r\ncathedral are stirred by the bass of the organ.\r\n\r\n"As with sounds, so with colors. At each end of the solar spectrum the\r\nchemist can detect the presence of what are known as \'actinic\'\r\nrays. They represent colors--integral colors in the composition of\r\nlight--which we are unable to discern. The human eye is an imperfect\r\ninstrument; its range is but a few octaves of the real \'chromatic scale\'\r\nI am not mad; there are colors that we can not see.\r\n\r\n"And, God help me! the Damned Thing is of such a color!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Damned Thing, by Ambrose Bierce\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DAMNED THING ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 23172.txt or 23172.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/1/7/23172/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
