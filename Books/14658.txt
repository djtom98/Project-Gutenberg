I don\'t want to apologize to her. Far be it from me.\r\nBut I do want to explain. Unfortunately, I do not know her name, much\r\nless her present address. If her eyes should chance upon these lines,\r\nI hope she will write to me.\r\n\r\nIt was in Reno, Nevada, in the summer of 1892. Also, it was fair-time,\r\nand the town was filled with petty crooks and tin-horns, to say\r\nnothing of a vast and hungry horde of hoboes. It was the hungry hoboes\r\nthat made the town a "hungry" town. They "battered" the back doors of\r\nthe homes of the citizens until the back doors became unresponsive.\r\n\r\nA hard town for "scoffings," was what the hoboes called it at that\r\ntime. I know that I missed many a meal, in spite of the fact that I\r\ncould "throw my feet" with the next one when it came to "slamming a\r\ngate" for a "poke-out" or a "set-down," or hitting for a "light piece"\r\non the street. Why, I was so hard put in that town, one day, that I\r\ngave the porter the slip and invaded the private car of some itinerant\r\nmillionnaire. The train started as I made the platform, and I headed\r\nfor the aforesaid millionnaire with the porter one jump behind and\r\nreaching for me. It was a dead heat, for I reached the millionnaire at\r\nthe same instant that the porter reached me. I had no time for\r\nformalities. "Gimme a quarter to eat on," I blurted out. And as I\r\nlive, that millionnaire dipped into his pocket and gave me ... just\r\n... precisely ... a quarter. It is my conviction that he was so\r\nflabbergasted that he obeyed automatically, and it has been a matter\r\nof keen regret ever since, on my part, that I didn\'t ask him for a\r\ndollar. I know that I\'d have got it. I swung off the platform of that\r\nprivate car with the porter manoeuvring to kick me in the face. He\r\nmissed me. One is at a terrible disadvantage when trying to swing off\r\nthe lowest step of a car and not break his neck on the right of way,\r\nwith, at the same time, an irate Ethiopian on the platform above\r\ntrying to land him in the face with a number eleven. But I got the\r\nquarter! I got it!\r\n\r\nBut to return to the woman to whom I so shamelessly lied. It was in\r\nthe evening of my last day in Reno. I had been out to the race-track\r\nwatching the ponies run, and had missed my dinner (_i.e._ the mid-day\r\nmeal). I was hungry, and, furthermore, a committee of public safety\r\nhad just been organized to rid the town of just such hungry mortals as\r\nI. Already a lot of my brother hoboes had been gathered in by John\r\nLaw, and I could hear the sunny valleys of California calling to me\r\nover the cold crests of the Sierras. Two acts remained for me to\r\nperform before I shook the dust of Reno from my feet. One was to catch\r\nthe blind baggage on the westbound overland that night. The other was\r\nfirst to get something to eat. Even youth will hesitate at an\r\nall-night ride, on an empty stomach, outside a train that is tearing\r\nthe atmosphere through the snow-sheds, tunnels, and eternal snows of\r\nheaven-aspiring mountains.\r\n\r\nBut that something to eat was a hard proposition. I was "turned down"\r\nat a dozen houses. Sometimes I received insulting remarks and was\r\ninformed of the barred domicile that should be mine if I had my just\r\ndeserts. The worst of it was that such assertions were only too true.\r\nThat was why I was pulling west that night. John Law was abroad in the\r\ntown, seeking eagerly for the hungry and homeless, for by such was his\r\nbarred domicile tenanted.\r\n\r\nAt other houses the doors were slammed in my face, cutting short my\r\npolitely and humbly couched request for something to eat. At one house\r\nthey did not open the door. I stood on the porch and knocked, and they\r\nlooked out at me through the window. They even held one sturdy little\r\nboy aloft so that he could see over the shoulders of his elders the\r\ntramp who wasn\'t going to get anything to eat at their house.\r\n\r\nIt began to look as if I should be compelled to go to the very poor\r\nfor my food. The very poor constitute the last sure recourse of the\r\nhungry tramp. The very poor can always be depended upon. They never\r\nturn away the hungry. Time and again, all over the United States, have\r\nI been refused food by the big house on the hill; and always have I\r\nreceived food from the little shack down by the creek or marsh, with\r\nits broken windows stuffed with rags and its tired-faced mother broken\r\nwith labor. Oh, you charity-mongers! Go to the poor and learn, for the\r\npoor alone are the charitable. They neither give nor withhold from\r\ntheir excess. They have no excess. They give, and they withhold never,\r\nfrom what they need for themselves, and very often from what they\r\ncruelly need for themselves. A bone to the dog is not charity. Charity\r\nis the bone shared with the dog when you are just as hungry as the\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nThere was one house in particular where I was turned down that\r\nevening. The porch windows opened on the dining room, and through them\r\nI saw a man eating pie--a big meat-pie. I stood in the open door, and\r\nwhile he talked with me, he went on eating. He was prosperous, and out\r\nof his prosperity had been bred resentment against his less fortunate\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nHe cut short my request for something to eat, snapping out, "I don\'t\r\nbelieve you want to work."\r\n\r\nNow this was irrelevant. I hadn\'t said anything about work. The topic\r\nof conversation I had introduced was "food." In fact, I didn\'t want to\r\nwork. I wanted to take the westbound overland that night.\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t work if you had a chance," he bullied.\r\n\r\nI glanced at his meek-faced wife, and knew that but for the presence\r\nof this Cerberus I\'d have a whack at that meat-pie myself. But\r\nCerberus sopped himself in the pie, and I saw that I must placate him\r\nif I were to get a share of it. So I sighed to myself and accepted his\r\nwork-morality.\r\n\r\n"Of course I want work," I bluffed.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t believe it," he snorted.\r\n\r\n"Try me," I answered, warming to the bluff.\r\n\r\n"All right," he said. "Come to the corner of blank and blank\r\nstreets"--(I have forgotten the address)--"to-morrow morning. You know\r\nwhere that burned building is, and I\'ll put you to work tossing\r\nbricks."\r\n\r\n"All right, sir; I\'ll be there."\r\n\r\nHe grunted and went on eating. I waited. After a couple of minutes he\r\nlooked up with an I-thought-you-were-gone expression on his face, and\r\ndemanded:--\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I ... I am waiting for something to eat," I said gently.\r\n\r\n"I knew you wouldn\'t work!" he roared.\r\n\r\nHe was right, of course; but his conclusion must have been reached by\r\nmind-reading, for his logic wouldn\'t bear it out. But the beggar at\r\nthe door must be humble, so I accepted his logic as I had accepted his\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\n"You see, I am now hungry," I said still gently. "To-morrow morning I\r\nshall be hungrier. Think how hungry I shall be when I have tossed\r\nbricks all day without anything to eat. Now if you will give me\r\nsomething to eat, I\'ll be in great shape for those bricks."\r\n\r\nHe gravely considered my plea, at the same time going on eating, while\r\nhis wife nearly trembled into propitiatory speech, but refrained.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do," he said between mouthfuls. "You come to\r\nwork to-morrow, and in the middle of the day I\'ll advance you enough\r\nfor your dinner. That will show whether you are in earnest or not."\r\n\r\n"In the meantime--" I began; but he interrupted.\r\n\r\n"If I gave you something to eat now, I\'d never see you again. Oh, I\r\nknow your kind. Look at me. I owe no man. I have never descended so\r\nlow as to ask any one for food. I have always earned my food. The\r\ntrouble with you is that you are idle and dissolute. I can see it in\r\nyour face. I have worked and been honest. I have made myself what I\r\nam. And you can do the same, if you work and are honest."\r\n\r\n"Like you?" I queried.\r\n\r\nAlas, no ray of humor had ever penetrated the sombre work-sodden soul\r\nof that man.\r\n\r\n"Yes, like me," he answered.\r\n\r\n"All of us?" I queried.\r\n\r\n"Yes, all of you," he answered, conviction vibrating in his voice.\r\n\r\n"But if we all became like you," I said, "allow me to point out that\r\nthere\'d be nobody to toss bricks for you."\r\n\r\nI swear there was a flicker of a smile in his wife\'s eye. As for him,\r\nhe was aghast--but whether at the awful possibility of a reformed\r\nhumanity that would not enable him to get anybody to toss bricks for\r\nhim, or at my impudence, I shall never know.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not waste words on you," he roared. "Get out of here, you\r\nungrateful whelp!"\r\n\r\nI scraped my feet to advertise my intention of going, and queried:--\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t get anything to eat?"\r\n\r\nHe arose suddenly to his feet. He was a large man. I was a stranger in\r\na strange land, and John Law was looking for me. I went away\r\nhurriedly. "But why ungrateful?" I asked myself as I slammed his gate.\r\n"What in the dickens did he give me to be ungrateful about?" I looked\r\nback. I could still see him through the window. He had returned to his\r\npie.\r\n\r\nBy this time I had lost heart. I passed many houses by without\r\nventuring up to them. All houses looked alike, and none looked "good."\r\nAfter walking half a dozen blocks I shook off my despondency and\r\ngathered my "nerve." This begging for food was all a game, and if I\r\ndidn\'t like the cards, I could always call for a new deal. I made up\r\nmy mind to tackle the next house. I approached it in the deepening\r\ntwilight, going around to the kitchen door.\r\n\r\nI knocked softly, and when I saw the kind face of the middle-aged\r\nwoman who answered, as by inspiration came to me the "story" I was to\r\ntell. For know that upon his ability to tell a good story depends the\r\nsuccess of the beggar. First of all, and on the instant, the beggar\r\nmust "size up" his victim. After that, he must tell a story that will\r\nappeal to the peculiar personality and temperament of that particular\r\nvictim. And right here arises the great difficulty: in the instant\r\nthat he is sizing up the victim he must begin his story. Not a minute\r\nis allowed for preparation. As in a lightning flash he must divine the\r\nnature of the victim and conceive a tale that will hit home. The\r\nsuccessful hobo must be an artist. He must create spontaneously and\r\ninstantaneously--and not upon a theme selected from the plenitude of\r\nhis own imagination, but upon the theme he reads in the face of the\r\nperson who opens the door, be it man, woman, or child, sweet or\r\ncrabbed, generous or miserly, good-natured or cantankerous, Jew or\r\nGentile, black or white, race-prejudiced or brotherly, provincial or\r\nuniversal, or whatever else it may be. I have often thought that to\r\nthis training of my tramp days is due much of my success as a\r\nstory-writer. In order to get the food whereby I lived, I was\r\ncompelled to tell tales that rang true. At the back door, out of\r\ninexorable necessity, is developed the convincingness and sincerity\r\nlaid down by all authorities on the art of the short-story. Also, I\r\nquite believe it was my tramp-apprenticeship that made a realist out\r\nof me. Realism constitutes the only goods one can exchange at the\r\nkitchen door for grub.\r\n\r\nAfter all, art is only consummate artfulness, and artfulness saves\r\nmany a "story." I remember lying in a police station at Winnipeg,\r\nManitoba. I was bound west over the Canadian Pacific. Of course, the\r\npolice wanted my story, and I gave it to them--on the spur of the\r\nmoment. They were landlubbers, in the heart of the continent, and what\r\nbetter story for them than a sea story? They could never trip me up on\r\nthat. And so I told a tearful tale of my life on the hell-ship\r\n_Glenmore_. (I had once seen the _Glenmore_ lying at anchor in San\r\nFrancisco Bay.)\r\n\r\nI was an English apprentice, I said. And they said that I didn\'t talk\r\nlike an English boy. It was up to me to create on the instant. I had\r\nbeen born and reared in the United States. On the death of my parents,\r\nI had been sent to England to my grandparents. It was they who had\r\napprenticed me on the _Glenmore_. I hope the captain of the _Glenmore_\r\nwill forgive me, for I gave him a character that night in the Winnipeg\r\npolice station. Such cruelty! Such brutality! Such diabolical\r\ningenuity of torture! It explained why I had deserted the _Glenmore_\r\nat Montreal.\r\n\r\nBut why was I in the middle of Canada going west, when my grandparents\r\nlived in England? Promptly I created a married sister who lived in\r\nCalifornia. She would take care of me. I developed at length her\r\nloving nature. But they were not done with me, those hard-hearted\r\npolicemen. I had joined the _Glenmore_ in England; in the two years\r\nthat had elapsed before my desertion at Montreal, what had the\r\n_Glenmore_ done and where had she been? And thereat I took those\r\nlandlubbers around the world with me. Buffeted by pounding seas and\r\nstung with flying spray, they fought a typhoon with me off the coast\r\nof Japan. They loaded and unloaded cargo with me in all the ports of\r\nthe Seven Seas. I took them to India, and Rangoon, and China, and had\r\nthem hammer ice with me around the Horn and at last come to moorings\r\nat Montreal.\r\n\r\nAnd then they said to wait a moment, and one policeman went forth into\r\nthe night while I warmed myself at the stove, all the while racking my\r\nbrains for the trap they were going to spring on me.\r\n\r\nI groaned to myself when I saw him come in the door at the heels of\r\nthe policeman. No gypsy prank had thrust those tiny hoops of gold\r\nthrough the ears; no prairie winds had beaten that skin into wrinkled\r\nleather; nor had snow-drift and mountain-slope put in his walk that\r\nreminiscent roll. And in those eyes, when they looked at me, I saw the\r\nunmistakable sun-wash of the sea. Here was a theme, alas! with half a\r\ndozen policemen to watch me read--I who had never sailed the China\r\nseas, nor been around the Horn, nor looked with my eyes upon India and\r\nRangoon.\r\n\r\nI was desperate. Disaster stalked before me incarnate in the form of\r\nthat gold-ear-ringed, weather-beaten son of the sea. Who was he? What\r\nwas he? I must solve him ere he solved me. I must take a new\r\norientation, or else those wicked policemen would orientate me to a\r\ncell, a police court, and more cells. If he questioned me first,\r\nbefore I knew how much he knew, I was lost.\r\n\r\nBut did I betray my desperate plight to those lynx-eyed guardians of\r\nthe public welfare of Winnipeg? Not I. I met that aged sailorman\r\nglad-eyed and beaming, with all the simulated relief at deliverance\r\nthat a drowning man would display on finding a life-preserver in his\r\nlast despairing clutch. Here was a man who understood and who would\r\nverify my true story to the faces of those sleuth-hounds who did not\r\nunderstand, or, at least, such was what I endeavored to play-act. I\r\nseized upon him; I volleyed him with questions about himself. Before\r\nmy judges I would prove the character of my savior before he saved me.\r\n\r\nHe was a kindly sailorman--an "easy mark." The policemen grew\r\nimpatient while I questioned him. At last one of them told me to shut\r\nup. I shut up; but while I remained shut up, I was busy creating, busy\r\nsketching the scenario of the next act. I had learned enough to go on\r\nwith. He was a Frenchman. He had sailed always on French merchant\r\nvessels, with the one exception of a voyage on a "lime-juicer." And\r\nlast of all--blessed fact!--he had not been on the sea for twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe policeman urged him on to examine me.\r\n\r\n"You called in at Rangoon?" he queried.\r\n\r\nI nodded. "We put our third mate ashore there. Fever."\r\n\r\nIf he had asked me what kind of fever, I should have answered,\r\n"Enteric," though for the life of me I didn\'t know what enteric was.\r\nBut he didn\'t ask me. Instead, his next question was:--\r\n\r\n"And how is Rangoon?"\r\n\r\n"All right. It rained a whole lot when we were there."\r\n\r\n"Did you get shore-leave?"\r\n\r\n"Sure," I answered. "Three of us apprentices went ashore together."\r\n\r\n"Do you remember the temple?"\r\n\r\n"Which temple?" I parried.\r\n\r\n"The big one, at the top of the stairway."\r\n\r\nIf I remembered that temple, I knew I\'d have to describe it. The gulf\r\nyawned for me.\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n"You can see it from all over the harbor," he informed me. "You don\'t\r\nneed shore-leave to see that temple."\r\n\r\nI never loathed a temple so in my life. But I fixed that particular\r\ntemple at Rangoon.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t see it from the harbor," I contradicted. "You can\'t see it\r\nfrom the town. You can\'t see it from the top of the stairway.\r\nBecause--" I paused for the effect. "Because there isn\'t any temple\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"But I saw it with my own eyes!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"That was in--?" I queried.\r\n\r\n"Seventy-one."\r\n\r\n"It was destroyed in the great earthquake of 1887," I explained. "It\r\nwas very old."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. He was busy reconstructing in his old eyes the\r\nyouthful vision of that fair temple by the sea.\r\n\r\n"The stairway is still there," I aided him. "You can see it from all\r\nover the harbor. And you remember that little island on the right-hand\r\nside coming into the harbor?" I guess there must have been one there\r\n(I was prepared to shift it over to the left-hand side), for he\r\nnodded. "Gone," I said. "Seven fathoms of water there now."\r\n\r\nI had gained a moment for breath. While he pondered on time\'s changes,\r\nI prepared the finishing touches of my story.\r\n\r\n"You remember the custom-house at Bombay?"\r\n\r\nHe remembered it.\r\n\r\n"Burned to the ground," I announced.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember Jim Wan?" he came back at me.\r\n\r\n"Dead," I said; but who the devil Jim Wan was I hadn\'t the slightest\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nI was on thin ice again.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember Billy Harper, at Shanghai?" I queried back at him\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nThat aged sailorman worked hard to recollect, but the Billy Harper of\r\nmy imagination was beyond his faded memory.\r\n\r\n"Of course you remember Billy Harper," I insisted. "Everybody knows\r\nhim. He\'s been there forty years. Well, he\'s still there, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nAnd then the miracle happened. The sailorman remembered Billy Harper.\r\nPerhaps there was a Billy Harper, and perhaps he had been in Shanghai\r\nfor forty years and was still there; but it was news to me.\r\n\r\nFor fully half an hour longer, the sailorman and I talked on in\r\nsimilar fashion. In the end he told the policemen that I was what I\r\nrepresented myself to be, and after a night\'s lodging and a breakfast\r\nI was released to wander on westward to my married sister in San\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the woman in Reno who opened her door to me in the\r\ndeepening twilight. At the first glimpse of her kindly face I took my\r\ncue. I became a sweet, innocent, unfortunate lad. I couldn\'t speak. I\r\nopened my mouth and closed it again. Never in my life before had I\r\nasked any one for food. My embarrassment was painful, extreme. I was\r\nashamed. I, who looked upon begging as a delightful whimsicality,\r\nthumbed myself over into a true son of Mrs. Grundy, burdened with all\r\nher bourgeois morality. Only the harsh pangs of the belly-need could\r\ncompel me to do so degraded and ignoble a thing as beg for food. And\r\ninto my face I strove to throw all the wan wistfulness of famished and\r\ningenuous youth unused to mendicancy.\r\n\r\n"You are hungry, my poor boy," she said.\r\n\r\nI had made her speak first.\r\n\r\nI nodded my head and gulped.\r\n\r\n"It is the first time I have ever ... asked," I faltered.\r\n\r\n"Come right in." The door swung open. "We have already finished\r\neating, but the fire is burning and I can get something up for you."\r\n\r\nShe looked at me closely when she got me into the light.\r\n\r\n"I wish my boy were as healthy and strong as you," she said. "But he\r\nis not strong. He sometimes falls down. He just fell down this\r\nafternoon and hurt himself badly, the poor dear."\r\n\r\nShe mothered him with her voice, with an ineffable tenderness in it\r\nthat I yearned to appropriate. I glanced at him. He sat across the\r\ntable, slender and pale, his head swathed in bandages. He did not\r\nmove, but his eyes, bright in the lamplight, were fixed upon me in a\r\nsteady and wondering stare.\r\n\r\n"Just like my poor father," I said. "He had the falling sickness. Some\r\nkind of vertigo. It puzzled the doctors. They never could make out\r\nwhat was the matter with him."\r\n\r\n"He is dead?" she queried gently, setting before me half a dozen\r\nsoft-boiled eggs.\r\n\r\n"Dead," I gulped. "Two weeks ago. I was with him when it happened. We\r\nwere crossing the street together. He fell right down. He was never\r\nconscious again. They carried him into a drug-store. He died there."\r\n\r\nAnd thereat I developed the pitiful tale of my father--how, after my\r\nmother\'s death, he and I had gone to San Francisco from the ranch; how\r\nhis pension (he was an old soldier), and the little other money he\r\nhad, was not enough; and how he had tried book-canvassing. Also, I\r\nnarrated my own woes during the few days after his death that I had\r\nspent alone and forlorn on the streets of San Francisco. While that\r\ngood woman warmed up biscuits, fried bacon, and cooked more eggs, and\r\nwhile I kept pace with her in taking care of all that she placed\r\nbefore me, I enlarged the picture of that poor orphan boy and filled\r\nin the details. I became that poor boy. I believed in him as I\r\nbelieved in the beautiful eggs I was devouring. I could have wept for\r\nmyself. I know the tears did get into my voice at times. It was very\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nIn fact, with every touch I added to the picture, that kind soul gave\r\nme something also. She made up a lunch for me to carry away. She put\r\nin many boiled eggs, pepper and salt, and other things, and a big\r\napple. She provided me with three pairs of thick red woollen socks.\r\nShe gave me clean handkerchiefs and other things which I have since\r\nforgotten. And all the time she cooked more and more and I ate more\r\nand more. I gorged like a savage; but then it was a far cry across the\r\nSierras on a blind baggage, and I knew not when nor where I should\r\nfind my next meal. And all the while, like a death\'s-head at the\r\nfeast, silent and motionless, her own unfortunate boy sat and stared\r\nat me across the table. I suppose I represented to him mystery, and\r\nromance, and adventure--all that was denied the feeble flicker of life\r\nthat was in him. And yet I could not forbear, once or twice, from\r\nwondering if he saw through me down to the bottom of my mendacious\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"But where are you going to?" she asked me.\r\n\r\n"Salt Lake City," said I. "I have a sister there--a married sister."\r\n(I debated if I should make a Mormon out of her, and decided against\r\nit.) "Her husband is a plumber--a contracting plumber."\r\n\r\nNow I knew that contracting plumbers were usually credited with making\r\nlots of money. But I had spoken. It was up to me to qualify.\r\n\r\n"They would have sent me the money for my fare if I had asked for it,"\r\nI explained, "but they have had sickness and business troubles. His\r\npartner cheated him. And so I wouldn\'t write for the money. I knew I\r\ncould make my way there somehow. I let them think I had enough to get\r\nme to Salt Lake City. She is lovely, and so kind. She was always kind\r\nto me. I guess I\'ll go into the shop and learn the trade. She has two\r\ndaughters. They are younger than I. One is only a baby."\r\n\r\nOf all my married sisters that I have distributed among the cities of\r\nthe United States, that Salt Lake sister is my favorite. She is quite\r\nreal, too. When I tell about her, I can see her, and her two little\r\ngirls, and her plumber husband. She is a large, motherly woman, just\r\nverging on beneficent stoutness--the kind, you know, that always cooks\r\nnice things and that never gets angry. She is a brunette. Her husband\r\nis a quiet, easy-going fellow. Sometimes I almost know him quite\r\nwell. And who knows but some day I may meet him? If that aged\r\nsailorman could remember Billy Harper, I see no reason why I should\r\nnot some day meet the husband of my sister who lives in Salt Lake\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I have a feeling of certitude within me that I\r\nshall never meet in the flesh my many parents and grandparents--you\r\nsee, I invariably killed them off. Heart disease was my favorite way\r\nof getting rid of my mother, though on occasion I did away with her by\r\nmeans of consumption, pneumonia, and typhoid fever. It is true, as the\r\nWinnipeg policemen will attest, that I have grandparents living in\r\nEngland; but that was a long time ago and it is a fair assumption that\r\nthey are dead by now. At any rate, they have never written to me.\r\n\r\nI hope that woman in Reno will read these lines and forgive me my\r\ngracelessness and unveracity. I do not apologize, for I am unashamed.\r\nIt was youth, delight in life, zest for experience, that brought me to\r\nher door. It did me good. It taught me the intrinsic kindliness of\r\nhuman nature. I hope it did her good. Anyway, she may get a good laugh\r\nout of it now that she learns the real inwardness of the situation.\r\n\r\nTo her my story was "true." She believed in me and all my family, and\r\nshe was filled with solicitude for the dangerous journey I must make\r\nere I won to Salt Lake City. This solicitude nearly brought me to\r\ngrief. Just as I was leaving, my arms full of lunch and my pockets\r\nbulging with fat woollen socks, she bethought herself of a nephew, or\r\nuncle, or relative of some sort, who was in the railway mail service,\r\nand who, moreover, would come through that night on the very train on\r\nwhich I was going to steal my ride. The very thing! She would take me\r\ndown to the depot, tell him my story, and get him to hide me in the\r\nmail car. Thus, without danger or hardship, I would be carried\r\nstraight through to Ogden. Salt Lake City was only a few miles farther\r\non. My heart sank. She grew excited as she developed the plan and with\r\nmy sinking heart I had to feign unbounded gladness and enthusiasm at\r\nthis solution of my difficulties.\r\n\r\nSolution! Why I was bound west that night, and here was I being\r\ntrapped into going east. It _was_ a trap, and I hadn\'t the heart to\r\ntell her that it was all a miserable lie. And while I made believe\r\nthat I was delighted, I was busy cudgelling my brains for some way to\r\nescape. But there was no way. She would see me into the mail-car--she\r\nsaid so herself--and then that mail-clerk relative of hers would carry\r\nme to Ogden. And then I would have to beat my way back over all those\r\nhundreds of miles of desert.\r\n\r\nBut luck was with me that night. Just about the time she was getting\r\nready to put on her bonnet and accompany me, she discovered that she\r\nhad made a mistake. Her mail-clerk relative was not scheduled to come\r\nthrough that night. His run had been changed. He would not come\r\nthrough until two nights afterward. I was saved, for of course my\r\nboundless youth would never permit me to wait those two days. I\r\noptimistically assured her that I\'d get to Salt Lake City quicker if I\r\nstarted immediately, and I departed with her blessings and best wishes\r\nringing in my ears.\r\n\r\nBut those woollen socks were great. I know. I wore a pair of them that\r\nnight on the blind baggage of the overland, and that overland went\r\nwest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLDING HER DOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nBarring accidents, a good hobo, with youth and agility, can hold a\r\ntrain down despite all the efforts of the train-crew to "ditch"\r\nhim--given, of course, night-time as an essential condition. When such\r\na hobo, under such conditions, makes up his mind that he is going to\r\nhold her down, either he does hold her down, or chance trips him up.\r\nThere is no legitimate way, short of murder, whereby the train-crew\r\ncan ditch him. That train-crews have not stopped short of murder is a\r\ncurrent belief in the tramp world. Not having had that particular\r\nexperience in my tramp days I cannot vouch for it personally.\r\n\r\nBut this I have heard of the "bad" roads. When a tramp has "gone\r\nunderneath," on the rods, and the train is in motion, there is\r\napparently no way of dislodging him until the train stops. The tramp,\r\nsnugly ensconced inside the truck, with the four wheels and all the\r\nframework around him, has the "cinch" on the crew--or so he thinks,\r\nuntil some day he rides the rods on a bad road. A bad road is usually\r\none on which a short time previously one or several trainmen have been\r\nkilled by tramps. Heaven pity the tramp who is caught "underneath" on\r\nsuch a road--for caught he is, though the train be going sixty miles\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nThe "shack" (brakeman) takes a coupling-pin and a length of bell-cord\r\nto the platform in front of the truck in which the tramp is riding.\r\nThe shack fastens the coupling-pin to the bell-cord, drops the former\r\ndown between the platforms, and pays out the latter. The coupling-pin\r\nstrikes the ties between the rails, rebounds against the bottom of the\r\ncar, and again strikes the ties. The shack plays it back and forth,\r\nnow to this side, now to the other, lets it out a bit and hauls it in\r\na bit, giving his weapon opportunity for every variety of impact and\r\nrebound. Every blow of that flying coupling-pin is freighted with\r\ndeath, and at sixty miles an hour it beats a veritable tattoo of\r\ndeath. The next day the remains of that tramp are gathered up along\r\nthe right of way, and a line in the local paper mentions the unknown\r\nman, undoubtedly a tramp, assumably drunk, who had probably fallen\r\nasleep on the track.\r\n\r\nAs a characteristic illustration of how a capable hobo can hold her\r\ndown, I am minded to give the following experience. I was in Ottawa,\r\nbound west over the Canadian Pacific. Three thousand miles of that\r\nroad stretched before me; it was the fall of the year, and I had to\r\ncross Manitoba and the Rocky Mountains. I could expect "crimpy"\r\nweather, and every moment of delay increased the frigid hardships of\r\nthe journey. Furthermore, I was disgusted. The distance between\r\nMontreal and Ottawa is one hundred and twenty miles. I ought to know,\r\nfor I had just come over it and it had taken me six days. By mistake I\r\nhad missed the main line and come over a small "jerk" with only two\r\nlocals a day on it. And during these six days I had lived on dry\r\ncrusts, and not enough of them, begged from the French peasants.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, my disgust had been heightened by the one day I had spent\r\nin Ottawa trying to get an outfit of clothing for my long journey. Let\r\nme put it on record right here that Ottawa, with one exception, is the\r\nhardest town in the United States and Canada to beg clothes in; the\r\none exception is Washington, D.C. The latter fair city is the limit. I\r\nspent two weeks there trying to beg a pair of shoes, and then had to\r\ngo on to Jersey City before I got them.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Ottawa. At eight sharp in the morning I started out\r\nafter clothes. I worked energetically all day. I swear I walked forty\r\nmiles. I interviewed the housewives of a thousand homes. I did not\r\neven knock off work for dinner. And at six in the afternoon, after ten\r\nhours of unremitting and depressing toil, I was still shy one shirt,\r\nwhile the pair of trousers I had managed to acquire was tight and,\r\nmoreover, was showing all the signs of an early disintegration.\r\n\r\nAt six I quit work and headed for the railroad yards, expecting to\r\npick up something to eat on the way. But my hard luck was still with\r\nme. I was refused food at house after house. Then I got a "hand-out."\r\nMy spirits soared, for it was the largest hand-out I had ever seen in\r\na long and varied experience. It was a parcel wrapped in newspapers\r\nand as big as a mature suit-case. I hurried to a vacant lot and opened\r\nit. First, I saw cake, then more cake, all kinds and makes of cake,\r\nand then some. It was all cake. No bread and butter with thick firm\r\nslices of meat between--nothing but cake; and I who of all things\r\nabhorred cake most! In another age and clime they sat down by the\r\nwaters of Babylon and wept. And in a vacant lot in Canada\'s proud\r\ncapital, I, too, sat down and wept ... over a mountain of cake. As one\r\nlooks upon the face of his dead son, so looked I upon that\r\nmultitudinous pastry. I suppose I was an ungrateful tramp, for I\r\nrefused to partake of the bounteousness of the house that had had a\r\nparty the night before. Evidently the guests hadn\'t liked cake either.\r\n\r\nThat cake marked the crisis in my fortunes. Than it nothing could be\r\nworse; therefore things must begin to mend. And they did. At the very\r\nnext house I was given a "set-down." Now a "set-down" is the height of\r\nbliss. One is taken inside, very often is given a chance to wash, and\r\nis then "set-down" at a table. Tramps love to throw their legs under a\r\ntable. The house was large and comfortable, in the midst of spacious\r\ngrounds and fine trees, and sat well back from the street. They had\r\njust finished eating, and I was taken right into the dining room--in\r\nitself a most unusual happening, for the tramp who is lucky enough to\r\nwin a set-down usually receives it in the kitchen. A grizzled and\r\ngracious Englishman, his matronly wife, and a beautiful young\r\nFrenchwoman talked with me while I ate.\r\n\r\nI wonder if that beautiful young Frenchwoman would remember, at this\r\nlate day, the laugh I gave her when I uttered the barbaric phrase,\r\n"two-bits." You see, I was trying delicately to hit them for a "light\r\npiece." That was how the sum of money came to be mentioned. "What?"\r\nshe said. "Two-bits," said I. Her mouth was twitching as she again\r\nsaid, "What?" "Two-bits," said I. Whereat she burst into laughter.\r\n"Won\'t you repeat it?" she said, when she had regained control of\r\nherself. "Two-bits," said I. And once more she rippled into\r\nuncontrollable silvery laughter. "I beg your pardon," said she; "but\r\nwhat ... what was it you said?" "Two-bits," said I; "is there anything\r\nwrong about it?" "Not that I know of," she gurgled between gasps; "but\r\nwhat does it mean?" I explained, but I do not remember now whether or\r\nnot I got that two-bits out of her; but I have often wondered since\r\nas to which of us was the provincial.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the depot, I found, much to my disgust, a bunch of\r\nat least twenty tramps that were waiting to ride out the blind\r\nbaggages of the overland. Now two or three tramps on the blind baggage\r\nare all right. They are inconspicuous. But a score! That meant\r\ntrouble. No train-crew would ever let all of us ride.\r\n\r\nI may as well explain here what a blind baggage is. Some mail-cars are\r\nbuilt without doors in the ends; hence, such a car is "blind." The\r\nmail-cars that possess end doors, have those doors always locked.\r\nSuppose, after the train has started, that a tramp gets on to the\r\nplatform of one of these blind cars. There is no door, or the door is\r\nlocked. No conductor or brakeman can get to him to collect fare or\r\nthrow him off. It is clear that the tramp is safe until the next time\r\nthe train stops. Then he must get off, run ahead in the darkness, and\r\nwhen the train pulls by, jump on to the blind again. But there are\r\nways and ways, as you shall see.\r\n\r\nWhen the train pulled out, those twenty tramps swarmed upon the three\r\nblinds. Some climbed on before the train had run a car-length. They\r\nwere awkward dubs, and I saw their speedy finish. Of course, the\r\ntrain-crew was "on," and at the first stop the trouble began. I jumped\r\noff and ran forward along the track. I noticed that I was accompanied\r\nby a number of the tramps. They evidently knew their business. When\r\none is beating an overland, he must always keep well ahead of the\r\ntrain at the stops. I ran ahead, and as I ran, one by one those that\r\naccompanied me dropped out. This dropping out was the measure of their\r\nskill and nerve in boarding a train.\r\n\r\nFor this is the way it works. When the train starts, the shack rides\r\nout the blind. There is no way for him to get back into the train\r\nproper except by jumping off the blind and catching a platform where\r\nthe car-ends are not "blind." When the train is going as fast as the\r\nshack cares to risk, he therefore jumps off the blind, lets several\r\ncars go by, and gets on to the train. So it is up to the tramp to run\r\nso far ahead that before the blind is opposite him the shack will have\r\nalready vacated it.\r\n\r\nI dropped the last tramp by about fifty feet, and waited. The train\r\nstarted. I saw the lantern of the shack on the first blind. He was\r\nriding her out. And I saw the dubs stand forlornly by the track as the\r\nblind went by. They made no attempt to get on. They were beaten by\r\ntheir own inefficiency at the very start. After them, in the line-up,\r\ncame the tramps that knew a little something about the game. They let\r\nthe first blind, occupied by the shack, go by, and jumped on the\r\nsecond and third blinds. Of course, the shack jumped off the first and\r\non to the second as it went by, and scrambled around there, throwing\r\noff the men who had boarded it. But the point is that I was so far\r\nahead that when the first blind came opposite me, the shack had\r\nalready left it and was tangled up with the tramps on the second\r\nblind. A half dozen of the more skilful tramps, who had run far enough\r\nahead, made the first blind, too.\r\n\r\nAt the next stop, as we ran forward along the track, I counted but\r\nfifteen of us. Five had been ditched. The weeding-out process had\r\nbegun nobly, and it continued station by station. Now we were\r\nfourteen, now twelve, now eleven, now nine, now eight. It reminded me\r\nof the ten little niggers of the nursery rhyme. I was resolved that I\r\nshould be the last little nigger of all. And why not? Was I not\r\nblessed with strength, agility, and youth? (I was eighteen, and in\r\nperfect condition.) And didn\'t I have my "nerve" with me? And\r\nfurthermore, was I not a tramp-royal? Were not these other tramps mere\r\ndubs and "gay-cats" and amateurs alongside of me? If I weren\'t the\r\nlast little nigger, I might as well quit the game and get a job on an\r\nalfalfa farm somewhere.\r\n\r\nBy the time our number had been reduced to four, the whole train-crew\r\nhad become interested. From then on it was a contest of skill and\r\nwits, with the odds in favor of the crew. One by one the three other\r\nsurvivors turned up missing, until I alone remained. My, but I was\r\nproud of myself! No Croesus was ever prouder of his first million. I\r\nwas holding her down in spite of two brakemen, a conductor, a fireman,\r\nand an engineer.\r\n\r\nAnd here are a few samples of the way I held her down. Out ahead, in\r\nthe darkness,--so far ahead that the shack riding out the blind must\r\nperforce get off before it reaches me,--I get on. Very well. I am\r\ngood for another station. When that station is reached, I dart ahead\r\nagain to repeat the manoeuvre. The train pulls out. I watch her\r\ncoming. There is no light of a lantern on the blind. Has the crew\r\nabandoned the fight? I do not know. One never knows, and one must be\r\nprepared every moment for anything. As the first blind comes opposite\r\nme, and I run to leap aboard, I strain my eyes to see if the shack is\r\non the platform. For all I know he may be there, with his lantern\r\ndoused, and even as I spring upon the steps that lantern may smash\r\ndown upon my head. I ought to know. I have been hit by lanterns two or\r\nthree times.\r\n\r\nBut no, the first blind is empty. The train is gathering speed. I am\r\nsafe for another station. But am I? I feel the train slacken speed. On\r\nthe instant I am alert. A manoeuvre is being executed against me, and\r\nI do not know what it is. I try to watch on both sides at once, not\r\nforgetting to keep track of the tender in front of me. From any one,\r\nor all, of these three directions, I may be assailed.\r\n\r\nAh, there it comes. The shack has ridden out the engine. My first\r\nwarning is when his feet strike the steps of the right-hand side of\r\nthe blind. Like a flash I am off the blind to the left and running\r\nahead past the engine. I lose myself in the darkness. The situation is\r\nwhere it has been ever since the train left Ottawa. I am ahead, and\r\nthe train must come past me if it is to proceed on its journey. I have\r\nas good a chance as ever for boarding her.\r\n\r\nI watch carefully. I see a lantern come forward to the engine, and I\r\ndo not see it go back from the engine. It must therefore be still on\r\nthe engine, and it is a fair assumption that attached to the handle of\r\nthat lantern is a shack. That shack was lazy, or else he would have\r\nput out his lantern instead of trying to shield it as he came forward.\r\nThe train pulls out. The first blind is empty, and I gain it. As\r\nbefore the train slackens, the shack from the engine boards the blind\r\nfrom one side, and I go off the other side and run forward.\r\n\r\nAs I wait in the darkness I am conscious of a big thrill of pride. The\r\noverland has stopped twice for me--for me, a poor hobo on the bum. I\r\nalone have twice stopped the overland with its many passengers and\r\ncoaches, its government mail, and its two thousand steam horses\r\nstraining in the engine. And I weigh only one hundred and sixty\r\npounds, and I haven\'t a five-cent piece in my pocket!\r\n\r\nAgain I see the lantern come forward to the engine. But this time it\r\ncomes conspicuously. A bit too conspicuously to suit me, and I wonder\r\nwhat is up. At any rate I have something else to be afraid of than the\r\nshack on the engine. The train pulls by. Just in time, before I make\r\nmy spring, I see the dark form of a shack, without a lantern, on the\r\nfirst blind. I let it go by, and prepare to board the second blind.\r\nBut the shack on the first blind has jumped off and is at my heels.\r\nAlso, I have a fleeting glimpse of the lantern of the shack who rode\r\nout the engine. He has jumped off, and now both shacks are on the\r\nground on the same side with me. The next moment the second blind\r\ncomes by and I am aboard it. But I do not linger. I have figured out\r\nmy countermove. As I dash across the platform I hear the impact of the\r\nshack\'s feet against the steps as he boards. I jump off the other side\r\nand run forward with the train. My plan is to run forward and get on\r\nthe first blind. It is nip and tuck, for the train is gathering speed.\r\nAlso, the shack is behind me and running after me. I guess I am the\r\nbetter sprinter, for I make the first blind. I stand on the steps and\r\nwatch my pursuer. He is only about ten feet back and running hard; but\r\nnow the train has approximated his own speed, and, relative to me, he\r\nis standing still. I encourage him, hold out my hand to him; but he\r\nexplodes in a mighty oath, gives up and makes the train several cars\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThe train is speeding along, and I am still chuckling to myself, when,\r\nwithout warning, a spray of water strikes me. The fireman is playing\r\nthe hose on me from the engine. I step forward from the car-platform\r\nto the rear of the tender, where I am sheltered under the overhang.\r\nThe water flies harmlessly over my head. My fingers itch to climb up\r\non the tender and lam that fireman with a chunk of coal; but I know if\r\nI do that, I\'ll be massacred by him and the engineer, and I refrain.\r\n\r\nAt the next stop I am off and ahead in the darkness. This time, when\r\nthe train pulls out, both shacks are on the first blind. I divine\r\ntheir game. They have blocked the repetition of my previous play. I\r\ncannot again take the second blind, cross over, and run forward to\r\nthe first. As soon as the first blind passes and I do not get on, they\r\nswing off, one on each side of the train. I board the second blind,\r\nand as I do so I know that a moment later, simultaneously, those two\r\nshacks will arrive on both sides of me. It is like a trap. Both ways\r\nare blocked. Yet there is another way out, and that way is up.\r\n\r\nSo I do not wait for my pursuers to arrive. I climb upon the upright\r\nironwork of the platform and stand upon the wheel of the hand-brake.\r\nThis has taken up the moment of grace and I hear the shacks strike the\r\nsteps on either side. I don\'t stop to look. I raise my arms overhead\r\nuntil my hands rest against the down-curving ends of the roofs of the\r\ntwo cars. One hand, of course, is on the curved roof of one car, the\r\nother hand on the curved roof of the other car. By this time both\r\nshacks are coming up the steps. I know it, though I am too busy to see\r\nthem. All this is happening in the space of only several seconds. I\r\nmake a spring with my legs and "muscle" myself up with my arms. As I\r\ndraw up my legs, both shacks reach for me and clutch empty air. I know\r\nthis, for I look down and see them. Also I hear them swear.\r\n\r\nI am now in a precarious position, riding the ends of the down-curving\r\nroofs of two cars at the same time. With a quick, tense movement, I\r\ntransfer both legs to the curve of one roof and both hands to the\r\ncurve of the other roof. Then, gripping the edge of that curving roof,\r\nI climb over the curve to the level roof above, where I sit down to\r\ncatch my breath, holding on the while to a ventilator that projects\r\nabove the surface. I am on top of the train--on the "decks," as the\r\ntramps call it, and this process I have described is by them called\r\n"decking her." And let me say right here that only a young and\r\nvigorous tramp is able to deck a passenger train, and also, that the\r\nyoung and vigorous tramp must have his nerve with him as well.\r\n\r\nThe train goes on gathering speed, and I know I am safe until the next\r\nstop--but only until the next stop. If I remain on the roof after the\r\ntrain stops, I know those shacks will fusillade me with rocks. A\r\nhealthy shack can "dewdrop" a pretty heavy chunk of stone on top of a\r\ncar--say anywhere from five to twenty pounds. On the other hand, the\r\nchances are large that at the next stop the shacks will be waiting for\r\nme to descend at the place I climbed up. It is up to me to climb down\r\nat some other platform.\r\n\r\nRegistering a fervent hope that there are no tunnels in the next half\r\nmile, I rise to my feet and walk down the train half a dozen cars. And\r\nlet me say that one must leave timidity behind him on such a\r\n_passear_. The roofs of passenger coaches are not made for midnight\r\npromenades. And if any one thinks they are, let me advise him to try\r\nit. Just let him walk along the roof of a jolting, lurching car, with\r\nnothing to hold on to but the black and empty air, and when he comes\r\nto the down-curving end of the roof, all wet and slippery with dew,\r\nlet him accelerate his speed so as to step across to the next roof,\r\ndown-curving and wet and slippery. Believe me, he will learn whether\r\nhis heart is weak or his head is giddy.\r\n\r\nAs the train slows down for a stop, half a dozen platforms from where\r\nI had decked her I come down. No one is on the platform. When the\r\ntrain comes to a standstill, I slip off to the ground. Ahead, and\r\nbetween me and the engine, are two moving lanterns. The shacks are\r\nlooking for me on the roofs of the cars. I note that the car beside\r\nwhich I am standing is a "four-wheeler"--by which is meant that it has\r\nonly four wheels to each truck. (When you go underneath on the rods,\r\nbe sure to avoid the "six-wheelers,"--they lead to disasters.)\r\n\r\nI duck under the train and make for the rods, and I can tell you I am\r\nmighty glad that the train is standing still. It is the first time I\r\nhave ever gone underneath on the Canadian Pacific, and the internal\r\narrangements are new to me. I try to crawl over the top of the truck,\r\nbetween the truck and the bottom of the car. But the space is not\r\nlarge enough for me to squeeze through. This is new to me. Down in the\r\nUnited States I am accustomed to going underneath on rapidly moving\r\ntrains, seizing a gunnel and swinging my feet under to the brake-beam,\r\nand from there crawling over the top of the truck and down inside the\r\ntruck to a seat on the cross-rod.\r\n\r\nFeeling with my hands in the darkness, I learn that there is room\r\nbetween the brake-beam and the ground. It is a tight squeeze. I have\r\nto lie flat and worm my way through. Once inside the truck, I take my\r\nseat on the rod and wonder what the shacks are thinking has become of\r\nme. The train gets under way. They have given me up at last.\r\n\r\nBut have they? At the very next stop, I see a lantern thrust under\r\nthe next truck to mine at the other end of the car. They are searching\r\nthe rods for me. I must make my get-away pretty lively. I crawl on my\r\nstomach under the brake-beam. They see me and run for me, but I crawl\r\non hands and knees across the rail on the opposite side and gain my\r\nfeet. Then away I go for the head of the train. I run past the engine\r\nand hide in the sheltering darkness. It is the same old situation. I\r\nam ahead of the train, and the train must go past me.\r\n\r\nThe train pulls out. There is a lantern on the first blind. I lie low,\r\nand see the peering shack go by. But there is also a lantern on the\r\nsecond blind. That shack spots me and calls to the shack who has gone\r\npast on the first blind. Both jump off. Never mind, I\'ll take the\r\nthird blind and deck her. But heavens, there is a lantern on the third\r\nblind, too. It is the conductor. I let it go by. At any rate I have\r\nnow the full train-crew in front of me. I turn and run back in the\r\nopposite direction to what the train is going. I look over my\r\nshoulder. All three lanterns are on the ground and wobbling along in\r\npursuit. I sprint. Half the train has gone by, and it is going quite\r\nfast, when I spring aboard. I know that the two shacks and the\r\nconductor will arrive like ravening wolves in about two seconds. I\r\nspring upon the wheel of the hand-brake, get my hands on the curved\r\nends of the roofs, and muscle myself up to the decks; while my\r\ndisappointed pursuers, clustering on the platform beneath like dogs\r\nthat have treed a cat, howl curses up at me and say unsocial things\r\nabout my ancestors.\r\n\r\nBut what does that matter? It is five to one, including the engineer\r\nand fireman, and the majesty of the law and the might of a great\r\ncorporation are behind them, and I am beating them out. I am too far\r\ndown the train, and I run ahead over the roofs of the coaches until I\r\nam over the fifth or sixth platform from the engine. I peer down\r\ncautiously. A shack is on that platform. That he has caught sight of\r\nme, I know from the way he makes a swift sneak inside the car; and I\r\nknow, also, that he is waiting inside the door, all ready to pounce\r\nout on me when I climb down. But I make believe that I don\'t know, and\r\nI remain there to encourage him in his error. I do not see him, yet I\r\nknow that he opens the door once and peeps up to assure himself that I\r\nam still there.\r\n\r\nThe train slows down for a station. I dangle my legs down in a\r\ntentative way. The train stops. My legs are still dangling. I hear the\r\ndoor unlatch softly. He is all ready for me. Suddenly I spring up and\r\nrun forward over the roof. This is right over his head, where he lurks\r\ninside the door. The train is standing still; the night is quiet, and\r\nI take care to make plenty of noise on the metal roof with my feet. I\r\ndon\'t know, but my assumption is that he is now running forward to\r\ncatch me as I descend at the next platform. But I don\'t descend there.\r\nHalfway along the roof of the coach, I turn, retrace my way softly and\r\nquickly to the platform both the shack and I have just abandoned. The\r\ncoast is clear. I descend to the ground on the off-side of the train\r\nand hide in the darkness. Not a soul has seen me.\r\n\r\nI go over to the fence, at the edge of the right of way, and watch.\r\nAh, ha! What\'s that? I see a lantern on top of the train, moving along\r\nfrom front to rear. They think I haven\'t come down, and they are\r\nsearching the roofs for me. And better than that--on the ground on\r\neach side of the train, moving abreast with the lantern on top, are\r\ntwo other lanterns. It is a rabbit-drive, and I am the rabbit. When\r\nthe shack on top flushes me, the ones on each side will nab me. I roll\r\na cigarette and watch the procession go by. Once past me, I am safe to\r\nproceed to the front of the train. She pulls out, and I make the front\r\nblind without opposition. But before she is fully under way and just\r\nas I am lighting my cigarette, I am aware that the fireman has climbed\r\nover the coal to the back of the tender and is looking down at me. I\r\nam filled with apprehension. From his position he can mash me to a\r\njelly with lumps of coal. Instead of which he addresses me, and I note\r\nwith relief the admiration in his voice.\r\n\r\n"You son-of-a-gun," is what he says.\r\n\r\nIt is a high compliment, and I thrill as a schoolboy thrills on\r\nreceiving a reward of merit.\r\n\r\n"Say," I call up to him, "don\'t you play the hose on me any more."\r\n\r\n"All right," he answers, and goes back to his work.\r\n\r\nI have made friends with the engine, but the shacks are still looking\r\nfor me. At the next stop, the shacks ride out all three blinds, and as\r\nbefore, I let them go by and deck in the middle of the train. The\r\ncrew is on its mettle by now, and the train stops. The shacks are\r\ngoing to ditch me or know the reason why. Three times the mighty\r\noverland stops for me at that station, and each time I elude the\r\nshacks and make the decks. But it is hopeless, for they have finally\r\ncome to an understanding of the situation. I have taught them that\r\nthey cannot guard the train from me. They must do something else.\r\n\r\nAnd they do it. When the train stops that last time, they take after\r\nme hot-footed. Ah, I see their game. They are trying to run me down.\r\nAt first they herd me back toward the rear of the train. I know my\r\nperil. Once to the rear of the train, it will pull out with me left\r\nbehind. I double, and twist, and turn, dodge through my pursuers, and\r\ngain the front of the train. One shack still hangs on after me. All\r\nright, I\'ll give him the run of his life, for my wind is good. I run\r\nstraight ahead along the track. It doesn\'t matter. If he chases me ten\r\nmiles, he\'ll nevertheless have to catch the train, and I can board her\r\nat any speed that he can.\r\n\r\nSo I run on, keeping just comfortably ahead of him and straining my\r\neyes in the gloom for cattle-guards and switches that may bring me to\r\ngrief. Alas! I strain my eyes too far ahead, and trip over something\r\njust under my feet, I know not what, some little thing, and go down to\r\nearth in a long, stumbling fall. The next moment I am on my feet, but\r\nthe shack has me by the collar. I do not struggle. I am busy with\r\nbreathing deeply and with sizing him up. He is narrow-shouldered, and\r\nI have at least thirty pounds the better of him in weight. Besides, he\r\nis just as tired as I am, and if he tries to slug me, I\'ll teach him a\r\nfew things.\r\n\r\nBut he doesn\'t try to slug me, and that problem is settled. Instead,\r\nhe starts to lead me back toward the train, and another possible\r\nproblem arises. I see the lanterns of the conductor and the other\r\nshack. We are approaching them. Not for nothing have I made the\r\nacquaintance of the New York police. Not for nothing, in box-cars, by\r\nwater-tanks, and in prison-cells, have I listened to bloody tales of\r\nman-handling. What if these three men are about to man-handle me?\r\nHeaven knows I have given them provocation enough. I think quickly. We\r\nare drawing nearer and nearer to the other two trainmen. I line up the\r\nstomach and the jaw of my captor, and plan the right and left I\'ll\r\ngive him at the first sign of trouble.\r\n\r\nPshaw! I know another trick I\'d like to work on him, and I almost\r\nregret that I did not do it at the moment I was captured. I could make\r\nhim sick, what of his clutch on my collar. His fingers,\r\ntight-gripping, are buried inside my collar. My coat is tightly\r\nbuttoned. Did you ever see a tourniquet? Well, this is one. All I have\r\nto do is to duck my head under his arm and begin to twist. I must\r\ntwist rapidly--very rapidly. I know how to do it; twisting in a\r\nviolent, jerky way, ducking my head under his arm with each\r\nrevolution. Before he knows it, those detaining fingers of his will be\r\ndetained. He will be unable to withdraw them. It is a powerful\r\nleverage. Twenty seconds after I have started revolving, the blood\r\nwill be bursting out of his finger-ends, the delicate tendons will be\r\nrupturing, and all the muscles and nerves will be mashing and crushing\r\ntogether in a shrieking mass. Try it sometime when somebody has you by\r\nthe collar. But be quick--quick as lightning. Also, be sure to hug\r\nyourself while you are revolving--hug your face with your left arm and\r\nyour abdomen with your right. You see, the other fellow might try to\r\nstop you with a punch from his free arm. It would be a good idea, too,\r\nto revolve away from that free arm rather than toward it. A punch\r\ngoing is never so bad as a punch coming.\r\n\r\nThat shack will never know how near he was to being made very, very\r\nsick. All that saves him is that it is not in their plan to man-handle\r\nme. When we draw near enough, he calls out that he has me, and they\r\nsignal the train to come on. The engine passes us, and the three\r\nblinds. After that, the conductor and the other shack swing aboard.\r\nBut still my captor holds on to me. I see the plan. He is going to\r\nhold me until the rear of the train goes by. Then he will hop on, and\r\nI shall be left behind--ditched.\r\n\r\nBut the train has pulled out fast, the engineer trying to make up for\r\nlost time. Also, it is a long train. It is going very lively, and I\r\nknow the shack is measuring its speed with apprehension.\r\n\r\n"Think you can make it?" I query innocently.\r\n\r\nHe releases my collar, makes a quick run, and swings aboard. A number\r\nof coaches are yet to pass by. He knows it, and remains on the steps,\r\nhis head poked out and watching me. In that moment my next move comes\r\nto me. I\'ll make the last platform. I know she\'s going fast and\r\nfaster, but I\'ll only get a roll in the dirt if I fail, and the\r\noptimism of youth is mine. I do not give myself away. I stand with a\r\ndejected droop of shoulder, advertising that I have abandoned hope.\r\nBut at the same time I am feeling with my feet the good gravel. It is\r\nperfect footing. Also I am watching the poked-out head of the shack. I\r\nsee it withdrawn. He is confident that the train is going too fast for\r\nme ever to make it.\r\n\r\nAnd the train _is_ going fast--faster than any train I have ever\r\ntackled. As the last coach comes by I sprint in the same direction\r\nwith it. It is a swift, short sprint. I cannot hope to equal the speed\r\nof the train, but I can reduce the difference of our speed to the\r\nminimum, and, hence, reduce the shock of impact, when I leap on board.\r\nIn the fleeting instant of darkness I do not see the iron hand-rail of\r\nthe last platform; nor is there time for me to locate it. I reach for\r\nwhere I think it ought to be, and at the same instant my feet leave\r\nthe ground. It is all in the toss. The next moment I may be rolling in\r\nthe gravel with broken ribs, or arms, or head. But my fingers grip the\r\nhand-hold, there is a jerk on my arms that slightly pivots my body,\r\nand my feet land on the steps with sharp violence.\r\n\r\nI sit down, feeling very proud of myself. In all my hoboing it is the\r\nbest bit of train-jumping I have done. I know that late at night one\r\nis always good for several stations on the last platform, but I do not\r\ncare to trust myself at the rear of the train. At the first stop I run\r\nforward on the off-side of the train, pass the Pullmans, and duck\r\nunder and take a rod under a day-coach. At the next stop I run forward\r\nagain and take another rod.\r\n\r\nI am now comparatively safe. The shacks think I am ditched. But the\r\nlong day and the strenuous night are beginning to tell on me. Also, it\r\nis not so windy nor cold underneath, and I begin to doze. This will\r\nnever do. Sleep on the rods spells death, so I crawl out at a station\r\nand go forward to the second blind. Here I can lie down and sleep; and\r\nhere I do sleep--how long I do not know--for I am awakened by a\r\nlantern thrust into my face. The two shacks are staring at me. I\r\nscramble up on the defensive, wondering as to which one is going to\r\nmake the first "pass" at me. But slugging is far from their minds.\r\n\r\n"I thought you was ditched," says the shack who had held me by the\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\n"If you hadn\'t let go of me when you did, you\'d have been ditched\r\nalong with me," I answer.\r\n\r\n"How\'s that?" he asks.\r\n\r\n"I\'d have gone into a clinch with you, that\'s all," is my reply.\r\n\r\nThey hold a consultation, and their verdict is summed up in:--\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess you can ride, Bo. There\'s no use trying to keep you\r\noff."\r\n\r\nAnd they go away and leave me in peace to the end of their division.\r\n\r\nI have given the foregoing as a sample of what "holding her down"\r\nmeans. Of course, I have selected a fortunate night out of my\r\nexperiences, and said nothing of the nights--and many of them--when I\r\nwas tripped up by accident and ditched.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I want to tell of what happened when I reached the end\r\nof the division. On single-track, transcontinental lines, the freight\r\ntrains wait at the divisions and follow out after the passenger\r\ntrains. When the division was reached, I left my train, and looked for\r\nthe freight that would pull out behind it. I found the freight, made\r\nup on a side-track and waiting. I climbed into a box-car half full of\r\ncoal and lay down. In no time I was asleep.\r\n\r\nI was awakened by the sliding open of the door. Day was just dawning,\r\ncold and gray, and the freight had not yet started. A "con"\r\n(conductor) was poking his head inside the door.\r\n\r\n"Get out of that, you blankety-blank-blank!" he roared at me.\r\n\r\nI got, and outside I watched him go down the line inspecting every car\r\nin the train. When he got out of sight I thought to myself that he\r\nwould never think I\'d have the nerve to climb back into the very car\r\nout of which he had fired me. So back I climbed and lay down again.\r\n\r\nNow that con\'s mental processes must have been paralleling mine, for\r\nhe reasoned that it was the very thing I would do. For back he came\r\nand fired me out.\r\n\r\nNow, surely, I reasoned, he will never dream that I\'d do it a third\r\ntime. Back I went, into the very same car. But I decided to make sure.\r\nOnly one side-door could be opened. The other side-door was nailed up.\r\nBeginning at the top of the coal, I dug a hole alongside of that door\r\nand lay down in it. I heard the other door open. The con climbed up\r\nand looked in over the top of the coal. He couldn\'t see me. He called\r\nto me to get out. I tried to fool him by remaining quiet. But when he\r\nbegan tossing chunks of coal into the hole on top of me, I gave up and\r\nfor the third time was fired out. Also, he informed me in warm terms\r\nof what would happen to me if he caught me in there again.\r\n\r\nI changed my tactics. When a man is paralleling your mental processes,\r\nditch him. Abruptly break off your line of reasoning, and go off on a\r\nnew line. This I did. I hid between some cars on an adjacent\r\nside-track, and watched. Sure enough, that con came back again to the\r\ncar. He opened the door, he climbed up, he called, he threw coal into\r\nthe hole I had made. He even crawled over the coal and looked into the\r\nhole. That satisfied him. Five minutes later the freight was pulling\r\nout, and he was not in sight. I ran alongside the car, pulled the door\r\nopen, and climbed in. He never looked for me again, and I rode that\r\ncoal-car precisely one thousand and twenty-two miles, sleeping most of\r\nthe time and getting out at divisions (where the freights always stop\r\nfor an hour or so) to beg my food. And at the end of the thousand and\r\ntwenty-two miles I lost that car through a happy incident. I got a\r\n"set-down," and the tramp doesn\'t live who won\'t miss a train for a\r\nset-down any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPICTURES\r\n\r\n    "What do it matter where or \'ow we die,\r\n    So long as we\'ve our \'ealth to watch it all?"\r\n\r\n                  --Sestina of the Tramp-Royal\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest charm of tramp-life is the absence of monotony.\r\nIn Hobo Land the face of life is protean--an ever changing\r\nphantasmagoria, where the impossible happens and the unexpected jumps\r\nout of the bushes at every turn of the road. The hobo never knows what\r\nis going to happen the next moment; hence, he lives only in the\r\npresent moment. He has learned the futility of telic endeavor, and\r\nknows the delight of drifting along with the whimsicalities of Chance.\r\n\r\nOften I think over my tramp days, and ever I marvel at the swift\r\nsuccession of pictures that flash up in my memory. It matters not\r\nwhere I begin to think; any day of all the days is a day apart, with a\r\nrecord of swift-moving pictures all its own. For instance, I remember\r\na sunny summer morning in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and immediately\r\ncomes to my mind the auspicious beginning of the day--a "set-down"\r\nwith two maiden ladies, and not in their kitchen, but in their dining\r\nroom, with them beside me at the table. We ate eggs, out of egg-cups!\r\nIt was the first time I had ever seen egg-cups, or heard of egg-cups!\r\nI was a bit awkward at first, I\'ll confess; but I was hungry and\r\nunabashed. I mastered the egg-cup, and I mastered the eggs in a way\r\nthat made those two maiden ladies sit up.\r\n\r\nWhy, they ate like a couple of canaries, dabbling with the one egg\r\neach they took, and nibbling at tiny wafers of toast. Life was low in\r\ntheir bodies; their blood ran thin; and they had slept warm all night.\r\nI had been out all night, consuming much fuel of my body to keep warm,\r\nbeating my way down from a place called Emporium, in the northern part\r\nof the state. Wafers of toast! Out of sight! But each wafer was no\r\nmore than a mouthful to me--nay, no more than a bite. It is tedious to\r\nhave to reach for another piece of toast each bite when one is\r\npotential with many bites.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a very little lad, I had a very little dog called Punch. I\r\nsaw to his feeding myself. Some one in the household had shot a lot of\r\nducks, and we had a fine meat dinner. When I had finished, I prepared\r\nPunch\'s dinner--a large plateful of bones and tidbits. I went outside\r\nto give it to him. Now it happened that a visitor had ridden over from\r\na neighboring ranch, and with him had come a Newfoundland dog as big\r\nas a calf. I set the plate on the ground. Punch wagged his tail and\r\nbegan. He had before him a blissful half-hour at least. There was a\r\nsudden rush. Punch was brushed aside like a straw in the path of a\r\ncyclone, and that Newfoundland swooped down upon the plate. In spite\r\nof his huge maw he must have been trained to quick lunches, for, in\r\nthe fleeting instant before he received the kick in the ribs I aimed\r\nat him, he completely engulfed the contents of the plate. He swept it\r\nclean. One last lingering lick of his tongue removed even the grease\r\nstains.\r\n\r\nAs that big Newfoundland behaved at the plate of my dog Punch, so\r\nbehaved I at the table of those two maiden ladies of Harrisburg. I\r\nswept it bare. I didn\'t break anything, but I cleaned out the eggs and\r\nthe toast and the coffee. The servant brought more, but I kept her\r\nbusy, and ever she brought more and more. The coffee was delicious,\r\nbut it needn\'t have been served in such tiny cups. What time had I to\r\neat when it took all my time to prepare the many cups of coffee for\r\ndrinking?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it gave my tongue time to wag. Those two maiden ladies,\r\nwith their pink-and-white complexions and gray curls, had never looked\r\nupon the bright face of adventure. As the "Tramp-Royal" would have it,\r\nthey had worked all their lives "on one same shift." Into the sweet\r\nscents and narrow confines of their uneventful existence I brought the\r\nlarge airs of the world, freighted with the lusty smells of sweat and\r\nstrife, and with the tangs and odors of strange lands and soils. And\r\nright well I scratched their soft palms with the callous on my own\r\npalms--the half-inch horn that comes of pull-and-haul of rope and long\r\nand arduous hours of caressing shovel-handles. This I did, not merely\r\nin the braggadocio of youth, but to prove, by toil performed, the\r\nclaim I had upon their charity.\r\n\r\nAh, I can see them now, those dear, sweet ladies, just as I sat at\r\ntheir breakfast table twelve years ago, discoursing upon the way of my\r\nfeet in the world, brushing aside their kindly counsel as a real\r\ndevilish fellow should, and thrilling them, not alone with my own\r\nadventures, but with the adventures of all the other fellows with whom\r\nI had rubbed shoulders and exchanged confidences. I appropriated them\r\nall, the adventures of the other fellows, I mean; and if those maiden\r\nladies had been less trustful and guileless, they could have tangled\r\nme up beautifully in my chronology. Well, well, and what of it? It was\r\nfair exchange. For their many cups of coffee, and eggs, and bites of\r\ntoast, I gave full value. Right royally I gave them entertainment. My\r\ncoming to sit at their table was their adventure, and adventure is\r\nbeyond price anyway.\r\n\r\nComing along the street, after parting from the maiden ladies, I\r\ngathered in a newspaper from the doorway of some late-riser, and in a\r\ngrassy park lay down to get in touch with the last twenty-four hours\r\nof the world. There, in the park, I met a fellow-hobo who told me his\r\nlife-story and who wrestled with me to join the United States Army. He\r\nhad given in to the recruiting officer and was just about to join, and\r\nhe couldn\'t see why I shouldn\'t join with him. He had been a member of\r\nCoxey\'s Army in the march to Washington several months before, and\r\nthat seemed to have given him a taste for army life. I, too, was a\r\nveteran, for had I not been a private in Company L of the Second\r\nDivision of Kelly\'s Industrial Army?--said Company L being commonly\r\nknown as the "Nevada push." But my army experience had had the\r\nopposite effect on me; so I left that hobo to go his way to the dogs\r\nof war, while I "threw my feet" for dinner.\r\n\r\nThis duty performed, I started to walk across the bridge over the\r\nSusquehanna to the west shore. I forget the name of the railroad that\r\nran down that side, but while lying in the grass in the morning the\r\nidea had come to me to go to Baltimore; so to Baltimore I was going on\r\nthat railroad, whatever its name was. It was a warm afternoon, and\r\npart way across the bridge I came to a lot of fellows who were in\r\nswimming off one of the piers. Off went my clothes and in went I. The\r\nwater was fine; but when I came out and dressed, I found I had been\r\nrobbed. Some one had gone through my clothes. Now I leave it to you if\r\nbeing robbed isn\'t in itself adventure enough for one day. I have\r\nknown men who have been robbed and who have talked all the rest of\r\ntheir lives about it. True, the thief that went through my clothes\r\ndidn\'t get much--some thirty or forty cents in nickels and pennies,\r\nand my tobacco and cigarette papers; but it was all I had, which is\r\nmore than most men can be robbed of, for they have something left at\r\nhome, while I had no home. It was a pretty tough gang in swimming\r\nthere. I sized up, and knew better than to squeal. So I begged "the\r\nmakings," and I could have sworn it was one of my own papers I rolled\r\nthe tobacco in.\r\n\r\nThen on across the bridge I hiked to the west shore. Here ran the\r\nrailroad I was after. No station was in sight. How to catch a freight\r\nwithout walking to a station was the problem. I noticed that the track\r\ncame up a steep grade, culminating at the point where I had tapped it,\r\nand I knew that a heavy freight couldn\'t pull up there any too lively.\r\nBut how lively? On the opposite side of the track rose a high bank. On\r\nthe edge, at the top, I saw a man\'s head sticking up from the grass.\r\nPerhaps he knew how fast the freights took the grade, and when the\r\nnext one went south. I called out my questions to him, and he motioned\r\nto me to come up.\r\n\r\nI obeyed, and when I reached the top, I found four other men lying in\r\nthe grass with him. I took in the scene and knew them for what they\r\nwere--American gypsies. In the open space that extended back among the\r\ntrees from the edge of the bank were several nondescript wagons.\r\nRagged, half-naked children swarmed over the camp, though I noticed\r\nthat they took care not to come near and bother the men-folk. Several\r\nlean, unbeautiful, and toil-degraded women were pottering about with\r\ncamp-chores, and one I noticed who sat by herself on the seat of one\r\nof the wagons, her head drooped forward, her knees drawn up to her\r\nchin and clasped limply by her arms. She did not look happy. She\r\nlooked as if she did not care for anything--in this I was wrong, for\r\nlater I was to learn that there was something for which she did care.\r\nThe full measure of human suffering was in her face, and, in\r\naddition, there was the tragic expression of incapacity for further\r\nsuffering. Nothing could hurt any more, was what her face seemed to\r\nportray; but in this, too, I was wrong.\r\n\r\nI lay in the grass on the edge of the steep and talked with the\r\nmen-folk. We were kin--brothers. I was the American hobo, and they\r\nwere the American gypsy. I knew enough of their argot for\r\nconversation, and they knew enough of mine. There were two more in\r\ntheir gang, who were across the river "mushing" in Harrisburg. A\r\n"musher" is an itinerant fakir. This word is not to be confounded with\r\nthe Klondike "musher," though the origin of both terms may be the\r\nsame; namely, the corruption of the French _marche ons_, to march, to\r\nwalk, to "mush." The particular graft of the two mushers who had\r\ncrossed the river was umbrella-mending; but what real graft lay behind\r\ntheir umbrella-mending, I was not told, nor would it have been polite\r\nto ask.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious day. Not a breath of wind was stirring, and we\r\nbasked in the shimmering warmth of the sun. From everywhere arose the\r\ndrowsy hum of insects, and the balmy air was filled with scents of the\r\nsweet earth and the green growing things. We were too lazy to do more\r\nthan mumble on in intermittent conversation. And then, all abruptly,\r\nthe peace and quietude was jarred awry by man.\r\n\r\nTwo bare-legged boys of eight or nine in some minor way broke some\r\nrule of the camp--what it was I did not know; and a man who lay beside\r\nme suddenly sat up and called to them. He was chief of the tribe, a\r\nman with narrow forehead and narrow-slitted eyes, whose thin lips and\r\ntwisted sardonic features explained why the two boys jumped and tensed\r\nlike startled deer at the sound of his voice. The alertness of fear\r\nwas in their faces, and they turned, in a panic, to run. He called to\r\nthem to come back, and one boy lagged behind reluctantly, his meagre\r\nlittle frame portraying in pantomime the struggle within him between\r\nfear and reason. He wanted to come back. His intelligence and past\r\nexperience told him that to come back was a lesser evil than to run\r\non; but lesser evil that it was, it was great enough to put wings to\r\nhis fear and urge his feet to flight.\r\n\r\nStill he lagged and struggled until he reached the shelter of the\r\ntrees, where he halted. The chief of the tribe did not pursue. He\r\nsauntered over to a wagon and picked up a heavy whip. Then he came\r\nback to the centre of the open space and stood still. He did not\r\nspeak. He made no gestures. He was the Law, pitiless and omnipotent.\r\nHe merely stood there and waited. And I knew, and all knew, and the\r\ntwo boys in the shelter of the trees knew, for what he waited.\r\n\r\nThe boy who had lagged slowly came back. His face was stamped with\r\nquivering resolution. He did not falter. He had made up his mind to\r\ntake his punishment. And mark you, the punishment was not for the\r\noriginal offence, but for the offence of running away. And in this,\r\nthat tribal chieftain but behaved as behaves the exalted society in\r\nwhich he lived. We punish our criminals, and when they escape and run\r\naway, we bring them back and add to their punishment.\r\n\r\nStraight up to the chief the boy came, halting at the proper distance\r\nfor the swing of the lash. The whip hissed through the air, and I\r\ncaught myself with a start of surprise at the weight of the blow. The\r\nthin little leg was so very thin and little. The flesh showed white\r\nwhere the lash had curled and bitten, and then, where the white had\r\nshown, sprang up the savage welt, with here and there along its length\r\nlittle scarlet oozings where the skin had broken. Again the whip\r\nswung, and the boy\'s whole body winced in anticipation of the blow,\r\nthough he did not move from the spot. His will held good. A second\r\nwelt sprang up, and a third. It was not until the fourth landed that\r\nthe boy screamed. Also, he could no longer stand still, and from then\r\non, blow after blow, he danced up and down in his anguish, screaming;\r\nbut he did not attempt to run away. If his involuntary dancing took\r\nhim beyond the reach of the whip, he danced back into range again. And\r\nwhen it was all over--a dozen blows--he went away, whimpering and\r\nsquealing, among the wagons.\r\n\r\nThe chief stood still and waited. The second boy came out from the\r\ntrees. But he did not come straight. He came like a cringing dog,\r\nobsessed by little panics that made him turn and dart away for half a\r\ndozen steps. But always he turned and came back, circling nearer and\r\nnearer to the man, whimpering, making inarticulate animal-noises in\r\nhis throat. I saw that he never looked at the man. His eyes always\r\nwere fixed upon the whip, and in his eyes was a terror that made me\r\nsick--the frantic terror of an inconceivably maltreated child. I have\r\nseen strong men dropping right and left out of battle and squirming in\r\ntheir death-throes, I have seen them by scores blown into the air by\r\nbursting shells and their bodies torn asunder; believe me, the\r\nwitnessing was as merrymaking and laughter and song to me in\r\ncomparison with the way the sight of that poor child affected me.\r\n\r\nThe whipping began. The whipping of the first boy was as play compared\r\nwith this one. In no time the blood was running down his thin little\r\nlegs. He danced and squirmed and doubled up till it seemed almost that\r\nhe was some grotesque marionette operated by strings. I say "seemed,"\r\nfor his screaming gave the lie to the seeming and stamped it with\r\nreality. His shrieks were shrill and piercing; within them no hoarse\r\nnotes, but only the thin sexlessness of the voice of a child. The time\r\ncame when the boy could stand it no more. Reason fled, and he tried to\r\nrun away. But now the man followed up, curbing his flight, herding him\r\nwith blows back always into the open space.\r\n\r\nThen came interruption. I heard a wild smothered cry. The woman who\r\nsat in the wagon seat had got out and was running to interfere. She\r\nsprang between the man and boy.\r\n\r\n"You want some, eh?" said he with the whip. "All right, then."\r\n\r\nHe swung the whip upon her. Her skirts were long, so he did not try\r\nfor her legs. He drove the lash for her face, which she shielded as\r\nbest she could with her hands and forearms, drooping her head forward\r\nbetween her lean shoulders, and on the lean shoulders and arms\r\nreceiving the blows. Heroic mother! She knew just what she was doing.\r\nThe boy, still shrieking, was making his get-away to the wagons.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while the four men lay beside me and watched and made no\r\nmove. Nor did I move, and without shame I say it; though my reason was\r\ncompelled to struggle hard against my natural impulse to rise up and\r\ninterfere. I knew life. Of what use to the woman, or to me, would be\r\nmy being beaten to death by five men there on the bank of the\r\nSusquehanna? I once saw a man hanged, and though my whole soul cried\r\nprotest, my mouth cried not. Had it cried, I should most likely have\r\nhad my skull crushed by the butt of a revolver, for it was the law\r\nthat the man should hang. And here, in this gypsy group, it was the\r\nlaw that the woman should be whipped.\r\n\r\nEven so, the reason in both cases that I did not interfere was not\r\nthat it was the law, but that the law was stronger than I. Had it not\r\nbeen for those four men beside me in the grass, right gladly would I\r\nhave waded into the man with the whip. And, barring the accident of\r\nthe landing on me with a knife or a club in the hands of some of the\r\nvarious women of the camp, I am confident that I should have beaten\r\nhim into a mess. But the four men _were_ beside me in the grass. They\r\nmade their law stronger than I.\r\n\r\nOh, believe me, I did my own suffering. I had seen women beaten\r\nbefore, often, but never had I seen such a beating as this. Her dress\r\nacross the shoulders was cut into shreds. One blow that had passed her\r\nguard, had raised a bloody welt from cheek to chin. Not one blow, nor\r\ntwo, not one dozen, nor two dozen, but endlessly, infinitely, that\r\nwhip-lash smote and curled about her. The sweat poured from me, and I\r\nbreathed hard, clutching at the grass with my hands until I strained\r\nit out by the roots. And all the time my reason kept whispering,\r\n"Fool! Fool!" That welt on the face nearly did for me. I started to\r\nrise to my feet; but the hand of the man next to me went out to my\r\nshoulder and pressed me down.\r\n\r\n"Easy, pardner, easy," he warned me in a low voice. I looked at him.\r\nHis eyes met mine unwaveringly. He was a large man, broad-shouldered\r\nand heavy-muscled; and his face was lazy, phlegmatic, slothful, withal\r\nkindly, yet without passion, and quite soulless--a dim soul,\r\nunmalicious, unmoral, bovine, and stubborn. Just an animal he was,\r\nwith no more than a faint flickering of intelligence, a good-natured\r\nbrute with the strength and mental caliber of a gorilla. His hand\r\npressed heavily upon me, and I knew the weight of the muscles behind.\r\nI looked at the other brutes, two of them unperturbed and incurious,\r\nand one of them that gloated over the spectacle; and my reason came\r\nback to me, my muscles relaxed, and I sank down in the grass.\r\n\r\nMy mind went back to the two maiden ladies with whom I had had\r\nbreakfast that morning. Less than two miles, as the crow flies,\r\nseparated them from this scene. Here, in the windless day, under a\r\nbeneficent sun, was a sister of theirs being beaten by a brother of\r\nmine. Here was a page of life they could never see--and better so,\r\nthough for lack of seeing they would never be able to understand their\r\nsisterhood, nor themselves, nor know the clay of which they were made.\r\nFor it is not given to woman to live in sweet-scented, narrow rooms\r\nand at the same time be a little sister to all the world.\r\n\r\nThe whipping was finished, and the woman, no longer screaming, went\r\nback to her seat in the wagon. Nor did the other women come to\r\nher--just then. They were afraid. But they came afterward, when a\r\ndecent interval had elapsed. The man put the whip away and rejoined\r\nus, flinging himself down on the other side of me. He was breathing\r\nhard from his exertions. He wiped the sweat from his eyes on his\r\ncoat-sleeve, and looked challengingly at me. I returned his look\r\ncarelessly; what he had done was no concern of mine. I did not go away\r\nabruptly. I lay there half an hour longer, which, under the\r\ncircumstances, was tact and etiquette. I rolled cigarettes from\r\ntobacco I borrowed from them, and when I slipped down the bank to the\r\nrailroad, I was equipped with the necessary information for catching\r\nthe next freight bound south.\r\n\r\nWell, and what of it? It was a page out of life, that\'s all; and there\r\nare many pages worse, far worse, that I have seen. I have sometimes\r\nheld forth (facetiously, so my listeners believed) that the chief\r\ndistinguishing trait between man and the other animals is that man is\r\nthe only animal that maltreats the females of his kind. It is\r\nsomething of which no wolf nor cowardly coyote is ever guilty. It is\r\nsomething that even the dog, degenerated by domestication, will not\r\ndo. The dog still retains the wild instinct in this matter, while man\r\nhas lost most of his wild instincts--at least, most of the good ones.\r\n\r\nWorse pages of life than what I have described? Read the reports on\r\nchild labor in the United States,--east, west, north, and south, it\r\ndoesn\'t matter where,--and know that all of us, profit-mongers that we\r\nare, are typesetters and printers of worse pages of life than that\r\nmere page of wife-beating on the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nI went down the grade a hundred yards to where the footing beside the\r\ntrack was good. Here I could catch my freight as it pulled slowly up\r\nthe hill, and here I found half a dozen hoboes waiting for the same\r\npurpose. Several were playing seven-up with an old pack of cards. I\r\ntook a hand. A coon began to shuffle the deck. He was fat, and young,\r\nand moon-faced. He beamed with good-nature. It fairly oozed from him.\r\nAs he dealt the first card to me, he paused and said:--\r\n\r\n"Say, Bo, ain\'t I done seen you befo\'?"\r\n\r\n"You sure have," I answered. "An\' you didn\'t have those same duds on,\r\neither."\r\n\r\nHe was puzzled.\r\n\r\n"D\'ye remember Buffalo?" I queried.\r\n\r\nThen he knew me, and with laughter and ejaculation hailed me as a\r\ncomrade; for at Buffalo his clothes had been striped while he did his\r\nbit of time in the Erie County Penitentiary. For that matter, my\r\nclothes had been likewise striped, for I had been doing my bit of\r\ntime, too.\r\n\r\nThe game proceeded, and I learned the stake for which we played. Down\r\nthe bank toward the river descended a steep and narrow path that led\r\nto a spring some twenty-five feet beneath. We played on the edge of\r\nthe bank. The man who was "stuck" had to take a small condensed-milk\r\ncan, and with it carry water to the winners.\r\n\r\nThe first game was played and the coon was stuck. He took the small\r\nmilk-tin and climbed down the bank, while we sat above and guyed him.\r\nWe drank like fish. Four round trips he had to make for me alone, and\r\nthe others were equally lavish with their thirst. The path was very\r\nsteep, and sometimes the coon slipped when part way up, spilled the\r\nwater, and had to go back for more. But he didn\'t get angry. He\r\nlaughed as heartily as any of us; that was why he slipped so often.\r\nAlso, he assured us of the prodigious quantities of water he would\r\ndrink when some one else got stuck.\r\n\r\nWhen our thirst was quenched, another game was started. Again the coon\r\nwas stuck, and again we drank our fill. A third game and a fourth\r\nended the same way, and each time that moon-faced darky nearly died\r\nwith delight at appreciation of the fate that Chance was dealing out\r\nto him. And we nearly died with him, what of our delight. We laughed\r\nlike careless children, or gods, there on the edge of the bank. I know\r\nthat I laughed till it seemed the top of my head would come off, and\r\nI drank from the milk-tin till I was nigh waterlogged. Serious\r\ndiscussion arose as to whether we could successfully board the freight\r\nwhen it pulled up the grade, what of the weight of water secreted on\r\nour persons. This particular phase of the situation just about\r\nfinished the coon. He had to break off from water-carrying for at\r\nleast five minutes while he lay down and rolled with laughter.\r\n\r\nThe lengthening shadows stretched farther and farther across the\r\nriver, and the soft, cool twilight came on, and ever we drank water,\r\nand ever our ebony cup-bearer brought more and more. Forgotten was the\r\nbeaten woman of the hour before. That was a page read and turned over;\r\nI was busy now with this new page, and when the engine whistled on the\r\ngrade, this page would be finished and another begun; and so the book\r\nof life goes on, page after page and pages without end--when one is\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nAnd then we played a game in which the coon failed to be stuck. The\r\nvictim was a lean and dyspeptic-looking hobo, the one who had laughed\r\nleast of all of us. We said we didn\'t want any water--which was the\r\ntruth. Not the wealth of Ormuz and of Ind, nor the pressure of a\r\npneumatic ram, could have forced another drop into my saturated\r\ncarcass. The coon looked disappointed, then rose to the occasion and\r\nguessed he\'d have some. He meant it, too. He had some, and then some,\r\nand then some. Ever the melancholy hobo climbed down and up the steep\r\nbank, and ever the coon called for more. He drank more water than all\r\nthe rest of us put together. The twilight deepened into night, the\r\nstars came out, and he still drank on. I do believe that if the\r\nwhistle of the freight hadn\'t sounded, he\'d be there yet, swilling\r\nwater and revenge while the melancholy hobo toiled down and up.\r\n\r\nBut the whistle sounded. The page was done. We sprang to our feet and\r\nstrung out alongside the track. There she came, coughing and\r\nspluttering up the grade, the headlight turning night into day and\r\nsilhouetting us in sharp relief. The engine passed us, and we were all\r\nrunning with the train, some boarding on the side-ladders, others\r\n"springing" the side-doors of empty box-cars and climbing in. I caught\r\na flat-car loaded with mixed lumber and crawled away into a\r\ncomfortable nook. I lay on my back with a newspaper under my head for\r\na pillow. Above me the stars were winking and wheeling in squadrons\r\nback and forth as the train rounded the curves, and watching them I\r\nfell asleep. The day was done--one day of all my days. To-morrow would\r\nbe another day, and I was young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"PINCHED"\r\n\r\n\r\nI rode into Niagara Falls in a "side-door Pullman," or, in common\r\nparlance, a box-car. A flat-car, by the way, is known amongst the\r\nfraternity as a "gondola," with the second syllable emphasized and\r\npronounced long. But to return. I arrived in the afternoon and headed\r\nstraight from the freight train to the falls. Once my eyes were filled\r\nwith that wonder-vision of down-rushing water, I was lost. I could not\r\ntear myself away long enough to "batter" the "privates" (domiciles)\r\nfor my supper. Even a "set-down" could not have lured me away. Night\r\ncame on, a beautiful night of moonlight, and I lingered by the falls\r\nuntil after eleven. Then it was up to me to hunt for a place to "kip."\r\n\r\n"Kip," "doss," "flop," "pound your ear," all mean the same thing;\r\nnamely, to sleep. Somehow, I had a "hunch" that Niagara Falls was a\r\n"bad" town for hoboes, and I headed out into the country. I climbed a\r\nfence and "flopped" in a field. John Law would never find me there, I\r\nflattered myself. I lay on my back in the grass and slept like a babe.\r\nIt was so balmy warm that I woke up not once all night. But with the\r\nfirst gray daylight my eyes opened, and I remembered the wonderful\r\nfalls. I climbed the fence and started down the road to have another\r\nlook at them. It was early--not more than five o\'clock--and not until\r\neight o\'clock could I begin to batter for my breakfast. I could spend\r\nat least three hours by the river. Alas! I was fated never to see the\r\nriver nor the falls again.\r\n\r\nThe town was asleep when I entered it. As I came along the quiet\r\nstreet, I saw three men coming toward me along the sidewalk. They were\r\nwalking abreast. Hoboes, I decided, like myself, who had got up early.\r\nIn this surmise I was not quite correct. I was only sixty-six and\r\ntwo-thirds per cent correct. The men on each side were hoboes all\r\nright, but the man in the middle wasn\'t. I directed my steps to the\r\nedge of the sidewalk in order to let the trio go by. But it didn\'t go\r\nby. At some word from the man in the centre, all three halted, and he\r\nof the centre addressed me.\r\n\r\nI piped the lay on the instant. He was a "fly-cop" and the two hoboes\r\nwere his prisoners. John Law was up and out after the early worm. I\r\nwas a worm. Had I been richer by the experiences that were to befall\r\nme in the next several months, I should have turned and run like the\r\nvery devil. He might have shot at me, but he\'d have had to hit me to\r\nget me. He\'d have never run after me, for two hoboes in the hand are\r\nworth more than one on the get-away. But like a dummy I stood still\r\nwhen he halted me. Our conversation was brief.\r\n\r\n"What hotel are you stopping at?" he queried.\r\n\r\nHe had me. I wasn\'t stopping at any hotel, and, since I did not know\r\nthe name of a hotel in the place, I could not claim residence in any\r\nof them. Also, I was up too early in the morning. Everything was\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\n"I just arrived," I said.\r\n\r\n"Well, you turn around and walk in front of me, and not too far in\r\nfront. There\'s somebody wants to see you."\r\n\r\nI was "pinched." I knew who wanted to see me. With that "fly-cop" and\r\nthe two hoboes at my heels, and under the direction of the former, I\r\nled the way to the city jail. There we were searched and our names\r\nregistered. I have forgotten, now, under which name I was registered.\r\nI gave the name of Jack Drake, but when they searched me, they found\r\nletters addressed to Jack London. This caused trouble and required\r\nexplanation, all of which has passed from my mind, and to this day I\r\ndo not know whether I was pinched as Jack Drake or Jack London. But\r\none or the other, it should be there to-day in the prison register of\r\nNiagara Falls. Reference can bring it to light. The time was somewhere\r\nin the latter part of June, 1894. It was only a few days after my\r\narrest that the great railroad strike began.\r\n\r\nFrom the office we were led to the "Hobo" and locked in. The "Hobo" is\r\nthat part of a prison where the minor offenders are confined together\r\nin a large iron cage. Since hoboes constitute the principal division\r\nof the minor offenders, the aforesaid iron cage is called the Hobo.\r\nHere we met several hoboes who had already been pinched that morning,\r\nand every little while the door was unlocked and two or three more\r\nwere thrust in on us. At last, when we totalled sixteen, we were led\r\nupstairs into the court-room. And now I shall faithfully describe\r\nwhat took place in that court-room, for know that my patriotic\r\nAmerican citizenship there received a shock from which it has never\r\nfully recovered.\r\n\r\nIn the court-room were the sixteen prisoners, the judge, and two\r\nbailiffs. The judge seemed to act as his own clerk. There were no\r\nwitnesses. There were no citizens of Niagara Falls present to look on\r\nand see how justice was administered in their community. The judge\r\nglanced at the list of cases before him and called out a name. A hobo\r\nstood up. The judge glanced at a bailiff. "Vagrancy, your Honor," said\r\nthe bailiff. "Thirty days," said his Honor. The hobo sat down, and the\r\njudge was calling another name and another hobo was rising to his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe trial of that hobo had taken just about fifteen seconds. The trial\r\nof the next hobo came off with equal celerity. The bailiff said,\r\n"Vagrancy, your Honor," and his Honor said, "Thirty days." Thus it\r\nwent like clockwork, fifteen seconds to a hobo--and thirty days.\r\n\r\nThey are poor dumb cattle, I thought to myself. But wait till my turn\r\ncomes; I\'ll give his Honor a "spiel." Part way along in the\r\nperformance, his Honor, moved by some whim, gave one of us an\r\nopportunity to speak. As chance would have it, this man was not a\r\ngenuine hobo. He bore none of the ear-marks of the professional\r\n"stiff." Had he approached the rest of us, while waiting at a\r\nwater-tank for a freight, we should have unhesitatingly classified him as\r\na "gay-cat." Gay-cat is the synonym for tenderfoot in Hobo Land. This\r\ngay-cat was well along in years--somewhere around forty-five, I should\r\njudge. His shoulders were humped a trifle, and his face was seamed by\r\nweather-beat.\r\n\r\nFor many years, according to his story, he had driven team for some\r\nfirm in (if I remember rightly) Lockport, New York. The firm had\r\nceased to prosper, and finally, in the hard times of 1893, had gone\r\nout of business. He had been kept on to the last, though toward the\r\nlast his work had been very irregular. He went on and explained at\r\nlength his difficulties in getting work (when so many were out of\r\nwork) during the succeeding months. In the end, deciding that he would\r\nfind better opportunities for work on the Lakes, he had started for\r\nBuffalo. Of course he was "broke," and there he was. That was all.\r\n\r\n"Thirty days," said his Honor, and called another hobo\'s name.\r\n\r\nSaid hobo got up. "Vagrancy, your Honor," said the bailiff, and his\r\nHonor said, "Thirty days."\r\n\r\nAnd so it went, fifteen seconds and thirty days to each hobo. The\r\nmachine of justice was grinding smoothly. Most likely, considering how\r\nearly it was in the morning, his Honor had not yet had his breakfast\r\nand was in a hurry.\r\n\r\nBut my American blood was up. Behind me were the many generations of\r\nmy American ancestry. One of the kinds of liberty those ancestors of\r\nmine had fought and died for was the right of trial by jury. This was\r\nmy heritage, stained sacred by their blood, and it devolved upon me to\r\nstand up for it. All right, I threatened to myself; just wait till he\r\ngets to me.\r\n\r\nHe got to me. My name, whatever it was, was called, and I stood up.\r\nThe bailiff said, "Vagrancy, your Honor," and I began to talk. But the\r\njudge began talking at the same time, and he said, "Thirty days." I\r\nstarted to protest, but at that moment his Honor was calling the name\r\nof the next hobo on the list. His Honor paused long enough to say to\r\nme, "Shut up!" The bailiff forced me to sit down. And the next moment\r\nthat next hobo had received thirty days and the succeeding hobo was\r\njust in process of getting his.\r\n\r\nWhen we had all been disposed of, thirty days to each stiff, his\r\nHonor, just as he was about to dismiss us, suddenly turned to the\r\nteamster from Lockport--the one man he had allowed to talk.\r\n\r\n"Why did you quit your job?" his Honor asked.\r\n\r\nNow the teamster had already explained how his job had quit him, and\r\nthe question took him aback.\r\n\r\n"Your Honor," he began confusedly, "isn\'t that a funny question to\r\nask?"\r\n\r\n"Thirty days more for quitting your job," said his Honor, and the\r\ncourt was closed. That was the outcome. The teamster got sixty days\r\nall together, while the rest of us got thirty days.\r\n\r\nWe were taken down below, locked up, and given breakfast. It was a\r\npretty good breakfast, as prison breakfasts go, and it was the best I\r\nwas to get for a month to come.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I was dazed. Here was I, under sentence, after a farce of a\r\ntrial wherein I was denied not only my right of trial by jury, but my\r\nright to plead guilty or not guilty. Another thing my fathers had\r\nfought for flashed through my brain--habeas corpus. I\'d show them. But\r\nwhen I asked for a lawyer, I was laughed at. Habeas corpus was all\r\nright, but of what good was it to me when I could communicate with no\r\none outside the jail? But I\'d show them. They couldn\'t keep me in jail\r\nforever. Just wait till I got out, that was all. I\'d make them sit up.\r\nI knew something about the law and my own rights, and I\'d expose their\r\nmaladministration of justice. Visions of damage suits and sensational\r\nnewspaper headlines were dancing before my eyes when the jailers came\r\nin and began hustling us out into the main office.\r\n\r\nA policeman snapped a handcuff on my right wrist. (Ah, ha, thought I,\r\na new indignity. Just wait till I get out.) On the left wrist of a\r\nnegro he snapped the other handcuff of that pair. He was a very tall\r\nnegro, well past six feet--so tall was he that when we stood side by\r\nside his hand lifted mine up a trifle in the manacles. Also, he was\r\nthe happiest and the raggedest negro I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nWe were all handcuffed similarly, in pairs. This accomplished, a\r\nbright nickel-steel chain was brought forth, run down through the\r\nlinks of all the handcuffs, and locked at front and rear of the\r\ndouble-line. We were now a chain-gang. The command to march was given,\r\nand out we went upon the street, guarded by two officers. The tall\r\nnegro and I had the place of honor. We led the procession.\r\n\r\nAfter the tomb-like gloom of the jail, the outside sunshine was\r\ndazzling. I had never known it to be so sweet as now, a prisoner with\r\nclanking chains, I knew that I was soon to see the last of it for\r\nthirty days. Down through the streets of Niagara Falls we marched to\r\nthe railroad station, stared at by curious passers-by, and especially\r\nby a group of tourists on the veranda of a hotel that we marched past.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of slack in the chain, and with much rattling and\r\nclanking we sat down, two and two, in the seats of the smoking-car.\r\nAfire with indignation as I was at the outrage that had been\r\nperpetrated on me and my forefathers, I was nevertheless too\r\nprosaically practical to lose my head over it. This was all new to me.\r\nThirty days of mystery were before me, and I looked about me to find\r\nsomebody who knew the ropes. For I had already learned that I was not\r\nbound for a petty jail with a hundred or so prisoners in it, but for a\r\nfull-grown penitentiary with a couple of thousand prisoners in it,\r\ndoing anywhere from ten days to ten years.\r\n\r\nIn the seat behind me, attached to the chain by his wrist, was a\r\nsquat, heavily-built, powerfully-muscled man. He was somewhere between\r\nthirty-five and forty years of age. I sized him up. In the corners of\r\nhis eyes I saw humor and laughter and kindliness. As for the rest of\r\nhim, he was a brute-beast, wholly unmoral, and with all the passion\r\nand turgid violence of the brute-beast. What saved him, what made him\r\npossible for me, were those corners of his eyes--the humor and\r\nlaughter and kindliness of the beast when unaroused.\r\n\r\nHe was my "meat." I "cottoned" to him. While my cuff-mate, the tall\r\nnegro, mourned with chucklings and laughter over some laundry he was\r\nsure to lose through his arrest, and while the train rolled on toward\r\nBuffalo, I talked with the man in the seat behind me. He had an empty\r\npipe. I filled it for him with my precious tobacco--enough in a single\r\nfilling to make a dozen cigarettes. Nay, the more we talked the surer\r\nI was that he was my meat, and I divided all my tobacco with him.\r\n\r\nNow it happens that I am a fluid sort of an organism, with sufficient\r\nkinship with life to fit myself in \'most anywhere. I laid myself out\r\nto fit in with that man, though little did I dream to what\r\nextraordinary good purpose I was succeeding. He had never been in the\r\nparticular penitentiary to which we were going, but he had done\r\n"one-," "two-," and "five-spots" in various other penitentiaries (a\r\n"spot" is a year), and he was filled with wisdom. We became pretty\r\nchummy, and my heart bounded when he cautioned me to follow his lead.\r\nHe called me "Jack," and I called him "Jack."\r\n\r\nThe train stopped at a station about five miles from Buffalo, and we,\r\nthe chain-gang, got off. I do not remember the name of this station,\r\nbut I am confident that it is some one of the following: Rocklyn,\r\nRockwood, Black Rock, Rockcastle, or Newcastle. But whatever the name\r\nof the place, we were walked a short distance and then put on a\r\nstreet-car. It was an old-fashioned car, with a seat, running the full\r\nlength, on each side. All the passengers who sat on one side were\r\nasked to move over to the other side, and we, with a great clanking of\r\nchain, took their places. We sat facing them, I remember, and I\r\nremember, too, the awed expression on the faces of the women, who took\r\nus, undoubtedly, for convicted murderers and bank-robbers. I tried to\r\nlook my fiercest, but that cuff-mate of mine, the too happy negro,\r\ninsisted on rolling his eyes, laughing, and reiterating, "O Lawdy!\r\nLawdy!"\r\n\r\nWe left the car, walked some more, and were led into the office of the\r\nErie County Penitentiary. Here we were to register, and on that\r\nregister one or the other of my names will be found. Also, we were\r\ninformed that we must leave in the office all our valuables: money,\r\ntobacco, matches, pocketknives, and so forth.\r\n\r\nMy new pal shook his head at me.\r\n\r\n"If you do not leave your things here, they will be confiscated\r\ninside," warned the official.\r\n\r\nStill my pal shook his head. He was busy with his hands, hiding his\r\nmovements behind the other fellows. (Our handcuffs had been removed.)\r\nI watched him, and followed suit, wrapping up in a bundle in my\r\nhandkerchief all the things I wanted to take in. These bundles the two\r\nof us thrust into our shirts. I noticed that our fellow-prisoners,\r\nwith the exception of one or two who had watches, did not turn over\r\ntheir belongings to the man in the office. They were determined to\r\nsmuggle them in somehow, trusting to luck; but they were not so wise\r\nas my pal, for they did not wrap their things in bundles.\r\n\r\nOur erstwhile guardians gathered up the handcuffs and chain and\r\ndeparted for Niagara Falls, while we, under new guardians, were led\r\naway into the prison. While we were in the office, our number had been\r\nadded to by other squads of newly arrived prisoners, so that we were\r\nnow a procession forty or fifty strong.\r\n\r\nKnow, ye unimprisoned, that traffic is as restricted inside a large\r\nprison as commerce was in the Middle Ages. Once inside a penitentiary,\r\none cannot move about at will. Every few steps are encountered great\r\nsteel doors or gates which are always kept locked. We were bound for\r\nthe barber-shop, but we encountered delays in the unlocking of doors\r\nfor us. We were thus delayed in the first "hall" we entered. A "hall"\r\nis not a corridor. Imagine an oblong cube, built out of bricks and\r\nrising six stories high, each story a row of cells, say fifty cells in\r\na row--in short, imagine a cube of colossal honeycomb. Place this cube\r\non the ground and enclose it in a building with a roof overhead and\r\nwalls all around. Such a cube and encompassing building constitute a\r\n"hall" in the Erie County Penitentiary. Also, to complete the picture,\r\nsee a narrow gallery, with steel railing, running the full length of\r\neach tier of cells and at the ends of the oblong cube see all these\r\ngalleries, from both sides, connected by a fire-escape system of\r\nnarrow steel stairways.\r\n\r\nWe were halted in the first hall, waiting for some guard to unlock a\r\ndoor. Here and there, moving about, were convicts, with close-cropped\r\nheads and shaven faces, and garbed in prison stripes. One such convict\r\nI noticed above us on the gallery of the third tier of cells. He was\r\nstanding on the gallery and leaning forward, his arms resting on the\r\nrailing, himself apparently oblivious of our presence. He seemed\r\nstaring into vacancy. My pal made a slight hissing noise. The convict\r\nglanced down. Motioned signals passed between them. Then through the\r\nair soared the handkerchief bundle of my pal. The convict caught it,\r\nand like a flash it was out of sight in his shirt and he was staring\r\ninto vacancy. My pal had told me to follow his lead. I watched my\r\nchance when the guard\'s back was turned, and my bundle followed the\r\nother one into the shirt of the convict.\r\n\r\nA minute later the door was unlocked, and we filed into the\r\nbarber-shop. Here were more men in convict stripes. They were the\r\nprison barbers. Also, there were bath-tubs, hot water, soap, and\r\nscrubbing-brushes. We were ordered to strip and bathe, each man to\r\nscrub his neighbor\'s back--a needless precaution, this compulsory\r\nbath, for the prison swarmed with vermin. After the bath, we were each\r\ngiven a canvas clothes-bag.\r\n\r\n"Put all your clothes in the bags," said the guard. "It\'s no good\r\ntrying to smuggle anything in. You\'ve got to line up naked for\r\ninspection. Men for thirty days or less keep their shoes and\r\nsuspenders. Men for more than thirty days keep nothing."\r\n\r\nThis announcement was received with consternation. How could naked men\r\nsmuggle anything past an inspection? Only my pal and I were safe. But\r\nit was right here that the convict barbers got in their work. They\r\npassed among the poor newcomers, kindly volunteering to take charge of\r\ntheir precious little belongings, and promising to return them later\r\nin the day. Those barbers were philanthropists--to hear them talk. As\r\nin the case of Fra Lippo Lippi, never was there such prompt\r\ndisemburdening. Matches, tobacco, rice-paper, pipes, knives, money,\r\neverything, flowed into the capacious shirts of the barbers. They\r\nfairly bulged with the spoil, and the guards made believe not to see.\r\nTo cut the story short, nothing was ever returned. The barbers never\r\nhad any intention of returning what they had taken. They considered it\r\nlegitimately theirs. It was the barber-shop graft. There were many\r\ngrafts in that prison, as I was to learn; and I, too, was destined to\r\nbecome a grafter--thanks to my new pal.\r\n\r\nThere were several chairs, and the barbers worked rapidly. The\r\nquickest shaves and hair-cuts I have ever seen were given in that\r\nshop. The men lathered themselves, and the barbers shaved them at the\r\nrate of a minute to a man. A hair-cut took a trifle longer. In three\r\nminutes the down of eighteen was scraped from my face, and my head was\r\nas smooth as a billiard-ball just sprouting a crop of bristles.\r\nBeards, mustaches, like our clothes and everything, came off. Take my\r\nword for it, we were a villainous-looking gang when they got through\r\nwith us. I had not realized before how really altogether bad we were.\r\n\r\nThen came the line-up, forty or fifty of us, naked as Kipling\'s heroes\r\nwho stormed Lungtungpen. To search us was easy. There were only our\r\nshoes and ourselves. Two or three rash spirits, who had doubted the\r\nbarbers, had the goods found on them--which goods, namely, tobacco,\r\npipes, matches, and small change, were quickly confiscated. This over,\r\nour new clothes were brought to us--stout prison shirts, and coats and\r\ntrousers conspicuously striped. I had always lingered under the\r\nimpression that the convict stripes were put on a man only after he\r\nhad been convicted of a felony. I lingered no longer, but put on the\r\ninsignia of shame and got my first taste of marching the lock-step.\r\n\r\nIn single file, close together, each man\'s hands on the shoulders of\r\nthe man in front, we marched on into another large hall. Here we were\r\nranged up against the wall in a long line and ordered to strip our\r\nleft arms. A youth, a medical student who was getting in his practice\r\non cattle such as we, came down the line. He vaccinated just about\r\nfour times as rapidly as the barbers shaved. With a final caution to\r\navoid rubbing our arms against anything, and to let the blood dry so\r\nas to form the scab, we were led away to our cells. Here my pal and I\r\nparted, but not before he had time to whisper to me, "Suck it out."\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was locked in, I sucked my arm clean. And afterward I saw\r\nmen who had not sucked and who had horrible holes in their arms into\r\nwhich I could have thrust my fist. It was their own fault. They could\r\nhave sucked.\r\n\r\nIn my cell was another man. We were to be cell-mates. He was a young,\r\nmanly fellow, not talkative, but very capable, indeed as splendid a\r\nfellow as one could meet with in a day\'s ride, and this in spite of\r\nthe fact that he had just recently finished a two-year term in some\r\nOhio penitentiary.\r\n\r\nHardly had we been in our cell half an hour, when a convict sauntered\r\ndown the gallery and looked in. It was my pal. He had the freedom of\r\nthe hall, he explained. He was unlocked at six in the morning and not\r\nlocked up again till nine at night. He was in with the "push" in that\r\nhall, and had been promptly appointed a trusty of the kind technically\r\nknown as "hall-man." The man who had appointed him was also a prisoner\r\nand a trusty, and was known as "First Hall-man." There were thirteen\r\nhall-men in that hall. Ten of them had charge each of a gallery of\r\ncells, and over them were the First, Second, and Third Hall-men.\r\n\r\nWe newcomers were to stay in our cells for the rest of the day, my pal\r\ninformed me, so that the vaccine would have a chance to take. Then\r\nnext morning we would be put to hard labor in the prison-yard.\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll get you out of the work as soon as I can," he promised.\r\n"I\'ll get one of the hall-men fired and have you put in his place."\r\n\r\nHe put his hand into his shirt, drew out the handkerchief containing\r\nmy precious belongings, passed it in to me through the bars, and went\r\non down the gallery.\r\n\r\nI opened the bundle. Everything was there. Not even a match was\r\nmissing. I shared the makings of a cigarette with my cell-mate. When I\r\nstarted to strike a match for a light, he stopped me. A flimsy, dirty\r\ncomforter lay in each of our bunks for bedding. He tore off a narrow\r\nstrip of the thin cloth and rolled it tightly and telescopically into\r\na long and slender cylinder. This he lighted with a precious match.\r\nThe cylinder of tight-rolled cotton cloth did not flame. On the end a\r\ncoal of fire slowly smouldered. It would last for hours, and my\r\ncell-mate called it a "punk." And when it burned short, all that was\r\nnecessary was to make a new punk, put the end of it against the old,\r\nblow on them, and so transfer the glowing coal. Why, we could have\r\ngiven Prometheus pointers on the conserving of fire.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\'clock dinner was served. At the bottom of our cage door\r\nwas a small opening like the entrance of a runway in a chicken-yard.\r\nThrough this were thrust two hunks of dry bread and two pannikins of\r\n"soup." A portion of soup consisted of about a quart of hot water with\r\nfloating on its surface a lonely drop of grease. Also, there was some\r\nsalt in that water.\r\n\r\nWe drank the soup, but we did not eat the bread. Not that we were not\r\nhungry, and not that the bread was uneatable. It was fairly good\r\nbread. But we had reasons. My cell-mate had discovered that our cell\r\nwas alive with bed-bugs. In all the cracks and interstices between the\r\nbricks where the mortar had fallen out flourished great colonies. The\r\nnatives even ventured out in the broad daylight and swarmed over the\r\nwalls and ceiling by hundreds. My cell-mate was wise in the ways of\r\nthe beasts. Like Childe Roland, dauntless the slug-horn to his lips he\r\nbore. Never was there such a battle. It lasted for hours. It was\r\nshambles. And when the last survivors fled to their brick-and-mortar\r\nfastnesses, our work was only half done. We chewed mouthfuls of our\r\nbread until it was reduced to the consistency of putty. When a fleeing\r\nbelligerent escaped into a crevice between the bricks, we promptly\r\nwalled him in with a daub of the chewed bread. We toiled on until the\r\nlight grew dim and until every hole, nook, and cranny was closed. I\r\nshudder to think of the tragedies of starvation and cannibalism that\r\nmust have ensued behind those bread-plastered ramparts.\r\n\r\nWe threw ourselves on our bunks, tired out and hungry, to wait for\r\nsupper. It was a good day\'s work well done. In the weeks to come we at\r\nleast should not suffer from the hosts of vermin. We had foregone our\r\ndinner, saved our hides at the expense of our stomachs; but we were\r\ncontent. Alas for the futility of human effort! Scarcely was our long\r\ntask completed when a guard unlocked our door. A redistribution of\r\nprisoners was being made, and we were taken to another cell and locked\r\nin two galleries higher up.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning our cells were unlocked, and down in the hall the\r\nseveral hundred prisoners of us formed the lock-step and marched out\r\ninto the prison-yard to go to work. The Erie Canal runs right by the\r\nback yard of the Erie County Penitentiary. Our task was to unload\r\ncanal-boats, carrying huge stay-bolts on our shoulders, like railroad\r\nties, into the prison. As I worked I sized up the situation and\r\nstudied the chances for a get-away. There wasn\'t the ghost of a show.\r\nAlong the tops of the walls marched guards armed with repeating\r\nrifles, and I was told, furthermore, that there were machine-guns in\r\nthe sentry-towers.\r\n\r\nI did not worry. Thirty days were not so long. I\'d stay those thirty\r\ndays, and add to the store of material I intended to use, when I got\r\nout, against the harpies of justice. I\'d show what an American boy\r\ncould do when his rights and privileges had been trampled on the way\r\nmine had. I had been denied my right of trial by jury; I had been\r\ndenied my right to plead guilty or not guilty; I had been denied a\r\ntrial even (for I couldn\'t consider that what I had received at\r\nNiagara Falls was a trial); I had not been allowed to communicate with\r\na lawyer nor any one, and hence had been denied my right of suing for\r\na writ of habeas corpus; my face had been shaved, my hair cropped\r\nclose, convict stripes had been put upon my body; I was forced to toil\r\nhard on a diet of bread and water and to march the shameful lock-step\r\nwith armed guards over me--and all for what? What had I done? What\r\ncrime had I committed against the good citizens of Niagara Falls that\r\nall this vengeance should be wreaked upon me? I had not even violated\r\ntheir "sleeping-out" ordinance. I had slept outside their\r\njurisdiction, in the country, that night. I had not even begged for a\r\nmeal, or battered for a "light piece" on their streets. All that I had\r\ndone was to walk along their sidewalk and gaze at their picayune\r\nwaterfall. And what crime was there in that? Technically I was guilty\r\nof no misdemeanor. All right, I\'d show them when I got out.\r\n\r\nThe next day I talked with a guard. I wanted to send for a lawyer. The\r\nguard laughed at me. So did the other guards. I really was\r\n_incommunicado_ so far as the outside world was concerned. I tried to\r\nwrite a letter out, but I learned that all letters were read, and\r\ncensured or confiscated, by the prison authorities, and that\r\n"short-timers" were not allowed to write letters anyway. A little\r\nlater I tried smuggling letters out by men who were released, but I\r\nlearned that they were searched and the letters found and destroyed.\r\nNever mind. It all helped to make it a blacker case when I did get\r\nout.\r\n\r\nBut as the prison days went by (which I shall describe in the next\r\nchapter), I "learned a few." I heard tales of the police, and\r\npolice-courts, and lawyers, that were unbelievable and monstrous. Men,\r\nprisoners, told me of personal experiences with the police of great\r\ncities that were awful. And more awful were the hearsay tales they\r\ntold me concerning men who had died at the hands of the police and who\r\ntherefore could not testify for themselves. Years afterward, in the\r\nreport of the Lexow Committee, I was to read tales true and more awful\r\nthan those told to me. But in the meantime, during the first days of\r\nmy imprisonment, I scoffed at what I heard.\r\n\r\nAs the days went by, however, I began to grow convinced. I saw with my\r\nown eyes, there in that prison, things unbelievable and monstrous. And\r\nthe more convinced I became, the profounder grew the respect in me for\r\nthe sleuth-hounds of the law and for the whole institution of criminal\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nMy indignation ebbed away, and into my being rushed the tides of fear.\r\nI saw at last, clear-eyed, what I was up against. I grew meek and\r\nlowly. Each day I resolved more emphatically to make no rumpus when I\r\ngot out. All I asked, when I got out, was a chance to fade away from\r\nthe landscape. And that was just what I did do when I was released. I\r\nkept my tongue between my teeth, walked softly, and sneaked for\r\nPennsylvania, a wiser and a humbler man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEN\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two days I toiled in the prison-yard. It was heavy work, and, in\r\nspite of the fact that I malingered at every opportunity, I was played\r\nout. This was because of the food. No man could work hard on such\r\nfood. Bread and water, that was all that was given us. Once a week we\r\nwere supposed to get meat; but this meat did not always go around, and\r\nsince all nutriment had first been boiled out of it in the making of\r\nsoup, it didn\'t matter whether one got a taste of it once a week or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there was one vital defect in the bread-and-water diet.\r\nWhile we got plenty of water, we did not get enough of the bread. A\r\nration of bread was about the size of one\'s two fists, and three\r\nrations a day were given to each prisoner. There was one good thing, I\r\nmust say, about the water--it was hot. In the morning it was called\r\n"coffee," at noon it was dignified as "soup," and at night it\r\nmasqueraded as "tea." But it was the same old water all the time. The\r\nprisoners called it "water bewitched." In the morning it was black\r\nwater, the color being due to boiling it with burnt bread-crusts. At\r\nnoon it was served minus the color, with salt and a drop of grease\r\nadded. At night it was served with a purplish-auburn hue that defied\r\nall speculation; it was darn poor tea, but it was dandy hot water.\r\n\r\nWe were a hungry lot in the Erie County Pen. Only the "long-timers"\r\nknew what it was to have enough to eat. The reason for this was that\r\nthey would have died after a time on the fare we "short-timers"\r\nreceived. I know that the long-timers got more substantial grub,\r\nbecause there was a whole row of them on the ground floor in our hall,\r\nand when I was a trusty, I used to steal from their grub while serving\r\nthem. Man cannot live on bread alone and not enough of it.\r\n\r\nMy pal delivered the goods. After two days of work in the yard I was\r\ntaken out of my cell and made a trusty, a "hall-man." At morning and\r\nnight we served the bread to the prisoners in their cells; but at\r\ntwelve o\'clock a different method was used. The convicts marched in\r\nfrom work in a long line. As they entered the door of our hall, they\r\nbroke the lock-step and took their hands down from the shoulders of\r\ntheir line-mates. Just inside the door were piled trays of bread, and\r\nhere also stood the First Hall-man and two ordinary hall-men. I was\r\none of the two. Our task was to hold the trays of bread as the line of\r\nconvicts filed past. As soon as the tray, say, that I was holding was\r\nemptied, the other hall-man took my place with a full tray. And when\r\nhis was emptied, I took his place with a full tray. Thus the line\r\ntramped steadily by, each man reaching with his right hand and taking\r\none ration of bread from the extended tray.\r\n\r\nThe task of the First Hall-man was different. He used a club. He stood\r\nbeside the tray and watched. The hungry wretches could never get over\r\nthe delusion that sometime they could manage to get two rations of\r\nbread out of the tray. But in my experience that sometime never came.\r\nThe club of the First Hall-man had a way of flashing out--quick as the\r\nstroke of a tiger\'s claw--to the hand that dared ambitiously. The\r\nFirst Hall-man was a good judge of distance, and he had smashed so\r\nmany hands with that club that he had become infallible. He never\r\nmissed, and he usually punished the offending convict by taking his\r\none ration away from him and sending him to his cell to make his meal\r\noff of hot water.\r\n\r\nAnd at times, while all these men lay hungry in their cells, I have\r\nseen a hundred or so extra rations of bread hidden away in the cells\r\nof the hall-men. It would seem absurd, our retaining this bread. But\r\nit was one of our grafts. We were economic masters inside our hall,\r\nturning the trick in ways quite similar to the economic masters of\r\ncivilization. We controlled the food-supply of the population, and,\r\njust like our brother bandits outside, we made the people pay through\r\nthe nose for it. We peddled the bread. Once a week, the men who worked\r\nin the yard received a five-cent plug of chewing tobacco. This chewing\r\ntobacco was the coin of the realm. Two or three rations of bread for a\r\nplug was the way we exchanged, and they traded, not because they loved\r\ntobacco less, but because they loved bread more. Oh, I know, it was\r\nlike taking candy from a baby, but what would you? We had to live. And\r\ncertainly there should be some reward for initiative and enterprise.\r\nBesides, we but patterned ourselves after our betters outside the\r\nwalls, who, on a larger scale, and under the respectable disguise of\r\nmerchants, bankers, and captains of industry, did precisely what we\r\nwere doing. What awful things would have happened to those poor\r\nwretches if it hadn\'t been for us, I can\'t imagine. Heaven knows we\r\nput bread into circulation in the Erie County Pen. Ay, and we\r\nencouraged frugality and thrift ... in the poor devils who forewent\r\ntheir tobacco. And then there was our example. In the breast of every\r\nconvict there we implanted the ambition to become even as we and run a\r\ngraft. Saviours of society--I guess yes.\r\n\r\nHere was a hungry man without any tobacco. Maybe he was a profligate\r\nand had used it all up on himself. Very good; he had a pair of\r\nsuspenders. I exchanged half a dozen rations of bread for it--or a\r\ndozen rations if the suspenders were very good. Now I never wore\r\nsuspenders, but that didn\'t matter. Around the corner lodged a\r\nlong-timer, doing ten years for manslaughter. He wore suspenders, and\r\nhe wanted a pair. I could trade them to him for some of his meat. Meat\r\nwas what I wanted. Or perhaps he had a tattered, paper-covered novel.\r\nThat was treasure-trove. I could read it and then trade it off to the\r\nbakers for cake, or to the cooks for meat and vegetables, or to the\r\nfiremen for decent coffee, or to some one or other for the newspaper\r\nthat occasionally filtered in, heaven alone knows how. The cooks,\r\nbakers, and firemen were prisoners like myself, and they lodged in our\r\nhall in the first row of cells over us.\r\n\r\nIn short, a full-grown system of barter obtained in the Erie County\r\nPen. There was even money in circulation. This money was sometimes\r\nsmuggled in by the short-timers, more frequently came from the\r\nbarber-shop graft, where the newcomers were mulcted, but most of all\r\nflowed from the cells of the long-timers--though how they got it I\r\ndon\'t know.\r\n\r\nWhat of his preeminent position, the First Hall-man was reputed to be\r\nquite wealthy. In addition to his miscellaneous grafts, he grafted on\r\nus. We farmed the general wretchedness, and the First Hall-man was\r\nFarmer-General over all of us. We held our particular grafts by his\r\npermission, and we had to pay for that permission. As I say, he was\r\nreputed to be wealthy; but we never saw his money, and he lived in a\r\ncell all to himself in solitary grandeur.\r\n\r\nBut that money was made in the Pen I had direct evidence, for I was\r\ncell-mate quite a time with the Third Hall-man. He had over sixteen\r\ndollars. He used to count his money every night after nine o\'clock,\r\nwhen we were locked in. Also, he used to tell me each night what he\r\nwould do to me if I gave away on him to the other hall-men. You see,\r\nhe was afraid of being robbed, and danger threatened him from three\r\ndifferent directions. There were the guards. A couple of them might\r\njump upon him, give him a good beating for alleged insubordination,\r\nand throw him into the "solitaire" (the dungeon); and in the mix-up\r\nthat sixteen dollars of his would take wings. Then again, the First\r\nHall-man could have taken it all away from him by threatening to\r\ndismiss him and fire him back to hard labor in the prison-yard. And\r\nyet again, there were the ten of us who were ordinary hall-men. If we\r\ngot an inkling of his wealth, there was a large liability, some quiet\r\nday, of the whole bunch of us getting him into a corner and dragging\r\nhim down. Oh, we were wolves, believe me--just like the fellows who do\r\nbusiness in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nHe had good reason to be afraid of us, and so had I to be afraid of\r\nhim. He was a huge, illiterate brute, an ex-Chesapeake-Bay-oyster-pirate,\r\nan "ex-con" who had done five years in Sing Sing, and a general\r\nall-around stupidly carnivorous beast. He used to trap sparrows that\r\nflew into our hall through the open bars. When he made a capture, he\r\nhurried away with it into his cell, where I have seen him crunching\r\nbones and spitting out feathers as he bolted it raw. Oh, no, I never\r\ngave away on him to the other hall-men. This is the first time I have\r\nmentioned his sixteen dollars.\r\n\r\nBut I grafted on him just the same. He was in love with a woman\r\nprisoner who was confined in the "female department." He could neither\r\nread nor write, and I used to read her letters to him and write his\r\nreplies. And I made him pay for it, too. But they were good letters. I\r\nlaid myself out on them, put in my best licks, and furthermore, I won\r\nher for him; though I shrewdly guess that she was in love, not with\r\nhim, but with the humble scribe. I repeat, those letters were great.\r\n\r\nAnother one of our grafts was "passing the punk." We were the\r\ncelestial messengers, the fire-bringers, in that iron world of bolt\r\nand bar. When the men came in from work at night and were locked in\r\ntheir cells, they wanted to smoke. Then it was that we restored the\r\ndivine spark, running the galleries, from cell to cell, with our\r\nsmouldering punks. Those who were wise, or with whom we did business,\r\nhad their punks all ready to light. Not every one got divine sparks,\r\nhowever. The guy who refused to dig up, went sparkless and smokeless\r\nto bed. But what did we care? We had the immortal cinch on him, and if\r\nhe got fresh, two or three of us would pitch on him and give him\r\n"what-for."\r\n\r\nYou see, this was the working-theory of the hall-men. There were\r\nthirteen of us. We had something like half a thousand prisoners in our\r\nhall. We were supposed to do the work, and to keep order. The latter\r\nwas the function of the guards, which they turned over to us. It was\r\nup to us to keep order; if we didn\'t, we\'d be fired back to hard\r\nlabor, most probably with a taste of the dungeon thrown in. But so\r\nlong as we maintained order, that long could we work our own\r\nparticular grafts.\r\n\r\nBear with me a moment and look at the problem. Here were thirteen\r\nbeasts of us over half a thousand other beasts. It was a living hell,\r\nthat prison, and it was up to us thirteen there to rule. It was\r\nimpossible, considering the nature of the beasts, for us to rule by\r\nkindness. We ruled by fear. Of course, behind us, backing us up, were\r\nthe guards. In extremity we called upon them for help; but it would\r\nbother them if we called upon them too often, in which event we could\r\ndepend upon it that they would get more efficient trusties to take our\r\nplaces. But we did not call upon them often, except in a quiet sort of\r\nway, when we wanted a cell unlocked in order to get at a refractory\r\nprisoner inside. In such cases all the guard did was to unlock the\r\ndoor and walk away so as not to be a witness of what happened when\r\nhalf a dozen hall-men went inside and did a bit of man-handling.\r\n\r\nAs regards the details of this man-handling I shall say nothing. And\r\nafter all, man-handling was merely one of the very minor unprintable\r\nhorrors of the Erie County Pen. I say "unprintable"; and in justice I\r\nmust also say "unthinkable." They were unthinkable to me until I saw\r\nthem, and I was no spring chicken in the ways of the world and the\r\nawful abysses of human degradation. It would take a deep plummet to\r\nreach bottom in the Erie County Pen, and I do but skim lightly and\r\nfacetiously the surface of things as I there saw them.\r\n\r\nAt times, say in the morning when the prisoners came down to wash, the\r\nthirteen of us would be practically alone in the midst of them, and\r\nevery last one of them had it in for us. Thirteen against five\r\nhundred, and we ruled by fear. We could not permit the slightest\r\ninfraction of rules, the slightest insolence. If we did, we were lost.\r\nOur own rule was to hit a man as soon as he opened his mouth--hit him\r\nhard, hit him with anything. A broom-handle, end-on, in the face, had\r\na very sobering effect. But that was not all. Such a man must be made\r\nan example of; so the next rule was to wade right in and follow him\r\nup. Of course, one was sure that every hall-man in sight would come on\r\nthe run to join in the chastisement; for this also was a rule.\r\nWhenever any hall-man was in trouble with a prisoner, the duty of any\r\nother hall-man who happened to be around was to lend a fist. Never\r\nmind the merits of the case--wade in and hit, and hit with anything;\r\nin short, lay the man out.\r\n\r\nI remember a handsome young mulatto of about twenty who got the insane\r\nidea into his head that he should stand for his rights. And he did\r\nhave the right of it, too; but that didn\'t help him any. He lived on\r\nthe topmost gallery. Eight hall-men took the conceit out of him in\r\njust about a minute and a half--for that was the length of time\r\nrequired to travel along his gallery to the end and down five flights\r\nof steel stairs. He travelled the whole distance on every portion of\r\nhis anatomy except his feet, and the eight hall-men were not idle. The\r\nmulatto struck the pavement where I was standing watching it all. He\r\nregained his feet and stood upright for a moment. In that moment he\r\nthrew his arms wide apart and omitted an awful scream of terror and\r\npain and heartbreak. At the same instant, as in a transformation\r\nscene, the shreds of his stout prison clothes fell from him, leaving\r\nhim wholly naked and streaming blood from every portion of the surface\r\nof his body. Then he collapsed in a heap, unconscious. He had learned\r\nhis lesson, and every convict within those walls who heard him scream\r\nhad learned a lesson. So had I learned mine. It is not a nice thing to\r\nsee a man\'s heart broken in a minute and a half.\r\n\r\nThe following will illustrate how we drummed up business in the graft\r\nof passing the punk. A row of newcomers is installed in your cells.\r\nYou pass along before the bars with your punk. "Hey, Bo, give us a\r\nlight," some one calls to you. Now this is an advertisement that that\r\nparticular man has tobacco on him. You pass in the punk and go your\r\nway. A little later you come back and lean up casually against the\r\nbars. "Say, Bo, can you let us have a little tobacco?" is what you\r\nsay. If he is not wise to the game, the chances are that he solemnly\r\navers that he hasn\'t any more tobacco. All very well. You condole with\r\nhim and go your way. But you know that his punk will last him only the\r\nrest of that day. Next day you come by, and he says again, "Hey, Bo,\r\ngive us a light." And you say, "You haven\'t any tobacco and you don\'t\r\nneed a light." And you don\'t give him any, either. Half an hour after,\r\nor an hour or two or three hours, you will be passing by and the man\r\nwill call out to you in mild tones, "Come here, Bo." And you come. You\r\nthrust your hand between the bars and have it filled with precious\r\ntobacco. Then you give him a light.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, a newcomer arrives, upon whom no grafts are to be\r\nworked. The mysterious word is passed along that he is to be treated\r\ndecently. Where this word originated I could never learn. The one\r\nthing patent is that the man has a "pull." It may be with one of the\r\nsuperior hall-men; it may be with one of the guards in some other part\r\nof the prison; it may be that good treatment has been purchased from\r\ngrafters higher up; but be it as it may, we know that it is up to us\r\nto treat him decently if we want to avoid trouble.\r\n\r\nWe hall-men were middle-men and common carriers. We arranged trades\r\nbetween convicts confined in different parts of the prison, and we put\r\nthrough the exchange. Also, we took our commissions coming and going.\r\nSometimes the objects traded had to go through the hands of half a\r\ndozen middle-men, each of whom took his whack, or in some way or\r\nanother was paid for his service.\r\n\r\nSometimes one was in debt for services, and sometimes one had others\r\nin his debt. Thus, I entered the prison in debt to the convict who\r\nsmuggled in my things for me. A week or so afterward, one of the\r\nfiremen passed a letter into my hand. It had been given to him by a\r\nbarber. The barber had received it from the convict who had smuggled\r\nin my things. Because of my debt to him I was to carry the letter on.\r\nBut he had not written the letter. The original sender was a\r\nlong-timer in his hall. The letter was for a woman prisoner in the\r\nfemale department. But whether it was intended for her, or whether\r\nshe, in turn, was one of the chain of go-betweens, I did not know. All\r\nthat I knew was her description, and that it was up to me to get it\r\ninto her hands.\r\n\r\nTwo days passed, during which time I kept the letter in my possession;\r\nthen the opportunity came. The women did the mending of all the\r\nclothes worn by the convicts. A number of our hall-men had to go to\r\nthe female department to bring back huge bundles of clothes. I fixed\r\nit with the First Hall-man that I was to go along. Door after door was\r\nunlocked for us as we threaded our way across the prison to the\r\nwomen\'s quarters. We entered a large room where the women sat working\r\nat their mending. My eyes were peeled for the woman who had been\r\ndescribed to me. I located her and worked near to her. Two eagle-eyed\r\nmatrons were on watch. I held the letter in my palm, and I looked my\r\nintention at the woman. She knew I had something for her; she must\r\nhave been expecting it, and had set herself to divining, at the moment\r\nwe entered, which of us was the messenger. But one of the matrons\r\nstood within two feet of her. Already the hall-men were picking up the\r\nbundles they were to carry away. The moment was passing. I delayed\r\nwith my bundle, making believe that it was not tied securely. Would\r\nthat matron ever look away? Or was I to fail? And just then another\r\nwoman cut up playfully with one of the hall-men--stuck out her foot\r\nand tripped him, or pinched him, or did something or other. The matron\r\nlooked that way and reprimanded the woman sharply. Now I do not know\r\nwhether or not this was all planned to distract the matron\'s\r\nattention, but I did know that it was my opportunity. My particular\r\nwoman\'s hand dropped from her lap down by her side. I stooped to pick\r\nup my bundle. From my stooping position I slipped the letter into her\r\nhand, and received another in exchange. The next moment the bundle\r\nwas on my shoulder, the matron\'s gaze had returned to me because I was\r\nthe last hall-man, and I was hastening to catch up with my companions.\r\nThe letter I had received from the woman I turned over to the fireman,\r\nand thence it passed through the hands of the barber, of the convict\r\nwho had smuggled in my things, and on to the long-timer at the other\r\nend.\r\n\r\nOften we conveyed letters, the chain of communication of which was so\r\ncomplex that we knew neither sender nor sendee. We were but links in\r\nthe chain. Somewhere, somehow, a convict would thrust a letter into my\r\nhand with the instruction to pass it on to the next link. All such\r\nacts were favors to be reciprocated later on, when I should be acting\r\ndirectly with a principal in transmitting letters, and from whom I\r\nshould be receiving my pay. The whole prison was covered by a network\r\nof lines of communication. And we who were in control of the system of\r\ncommunication, naturally, since we were modelled after capitalistic\r\nsociety, exacted heavy tolls from our customers. It was service for\r\nprofit with a vengeance, though we were at times not above giving\r\nservice for love.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time I was in the Pen I was making myself solid with my\r\npal. He had done much for me, and in return he expected me to do as\r\nmuch for him. When we got out, we were to travel together, and, it\r\ngoes without saying, pull off "jobs" together. For my pal was a\r\ncriminal--oh, not a jewel of the first water, merely a petty criminal\r\nwho would steal and rob, commit burglary, and, if cornered, not stop\r\nshort of murder. Many a quiet hour we sat and talked together. He had\r\ntwo or three jobs in view for the immediate future, in which my work\r\nwas cut out for me, and in which I joined in planning the details. I\r\nhad been with and seen much of criminals, and my pal never dreamed\r\nthat I was only fooling him, giving him a string thirty days long. He\r\nthought I was the real goods, liked me because I was not stupid, and\r\nliked me a bit, too, I think, for myself. Of course I had not the\r\nslightest intention of joining him in a life of sordid, petty crime;\r\nbut I\'d have been an idiot to throw away all the good things his\r\nfriendship made possible. When one is on the hot lava of hell, he\r\ncannot pick and choose his path, and so it was with me in the Erie\r\nCounty Pen. I had to stay in with the "push," or do hard labor on\r\nbread and water; and to stay in with the push I had to make good with\r\nmy pal.\r\n\r\nLife was not monotonous in the Pen. Every day something was happening:\r\nmen were having fits, going crazy, fighting, or the hall-men were\r\ngetting drunk. Rover Jack, one of the ordinary hall-men, was our star\r\n"oryide." He was a true "profesh," a "blowed-in-the-glass" stiff, and\r\nas such received all kinds of latitude from the hall-men in authority.\r\nPittsburg Joe, who was Second Hall-man, used to join Rover Jack in his\r\njags; and it was a saying of the pair that the Erie County Pen was the\r\nonly place where a man could get "slopped" and not be arrested. I\r\nnever knew, but I was told that bromide of potassium, gained in\r\ndevious ways from the dispensary, was the dope they used. But I do\r\nknow, whatever their dope was, that they got good and drunk on\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nOur hall was a common stews, filled with the ruck and the filth, the\r\nscum and dregs, of society--hereditary inefficients, degenerates,\r\nwrecks, lunatics, addled intelligences, epileptics, monsters,\r\nweaklings, in short, a very nightmare of humanity. Hence, fits\r\nflourished with us. These fits seemed contagious. When one man began\r\nthrowing a fit, others followed his lead. I have seen seven men down\r\nwith fits at the same time, making the air hideous with their cries,\r\nwhile as many more lunatics would be raging and gibbering up and down.\r\nNothing was ever done for the men with fits except to throw cold water\r\non them. It was useless to send for the medical student or the doctor.\r\nThey were not to be bothered with such trivial and frequent\r\noccurrences.\r\n\r\nThere was a young Dutch boy, about eighteen years of age, who had fits\r\nmost frequently of all. He usually threw one every day. It was for\r\nthat reason that we kept him on the ground floor farther down in the\r\nrow of cells in which we lodged. After he had had a few fits in the\r\nprison-yard, the guards refused to be bothered with him any more, and\r\nso he remained locked up in his cell all day with a Cockney cell-mate,\r\nto keep him company. Not that the Cockney was of any use. Whenever the\r\nDutch boy had a fit, the Cockney became paralyzed with terror.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch boy could not speak a word of English. He was a farmer\'s\r\nboy, serving ninety days as punishment for having got into a scrap\r\nwith some one. He prefaced his fits with howling. He howled like a\r\nwolf. Also, he took his fits standing up, which was very inconvenient\r\nfor him, for his fits always culminated in a headlong pitch to the\r\nfloor. Whenever I heard the long wolf-howl rising, I used to grab a\r\nbroom and run to his cell. Now the trusties were not allowed keys to\r\nthe cells, so I could not get in to him. He would stand up in the\r\nmiddle of his narrow cell, shivering convulsively, his eyes rolled\r\nbackward till only the whites were visible, and howling like a lost\r\nsoul. Try as I would, I could never get the Cockney to lend him a\r\nhand. While he stood and howled, the Cockney crouched and trembled in\r\nthe upper bunk, his terror-stricken gaze fixed on that awful figure,\r\nwith eyes rolled back, that howled and howled. It was hard on him,\r\ntoo, the poor devil of a Cockney. His own reason was not any too\r\nfirmly seated, and the wonder is that he did not go mad.\r\n\r\nAll that I could do was my best with the broom. I would thrust it\r\nthrough the bars, train it on Dutchy\'s chest, and wait. As the crisis\r\napproached he would begin swaying back and forth. I followed this\r\nswaying with the broom, for there was no telling when he would take\r\nthat dreadful forward pitch. But when he did, I was there with the\r\nbroom, catching him and easing him down. Contrive as I would, he never\r\ncame down quite gently, and his face was usually bruised by the stone\r\nfloor. Once down and writhing in convulsions, I\'d throw a bucket of\r\nwater over him. I don\'t know whether cold water was the right thing or\r\nnot, but it was the custom in the Erie County Pen. Nothing more than\r\nthat was ever done for him. He would lie there, wet, for an hour or\r\nso, and then crawl into his bunk. I knew better than to run to a guard\r\nfor assistance. What was a man with a fit, anyway?\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining cell lived a strange character--a man who was doing\r\nsixty days for eating swill out of Barnum\'s swill-barrel, or at least\r\nthat was the way he put it. He was a badly addled creature, and, at\r\nfirst, very mild and gentle. The facts of his case were as he had\r\nstated them. He had strayed out to the circus ground, and, being\r\nhungry, had made his way to the barrel that contained the refuse from\r\nthe table of the circus people. "And it was good bread," he often\r\nassured me; "and the meat was out of sight." A policeman had seen him\r\nand arrested him, and there he was.\r\n\r\nOnce I passed his cell with a piece of stiff thin wire in my hand. He\r\nasked me for it so earnestly that I passed it through the bars to him.\r\nPromptly, and with no tool but his fingers, he broke it into short\r\nlengths and twisted them into half a dozen very creditable safety\r\npins. He sharpened the points on the stone floor. Thereafter I did\r\nquite a trade in safety pins. I furnished the raw material and peddled\r\nthe finished product, and he did the work. As wages, I paid him extra\r\nrations of bread, and once in a while a chunk of meat or a piece of\r\nsoup-bone with some marrow inside.\r\n\r\nBut his imprisonment told on him, and he grew violent day by day. The\r\nhall-men took delight in teasing him. They filled his weak brain with\r\nstories of a great fortune that had been left him. It was in order to\r\nrob him of it that he had been arrested and sent to jail. Of course,\r\nas he himself knew, there was no law against eating out of a barrel.\r\nTherefore he was wrongly imprisoned. It was a plot to deprive him of\r\nhis fortune.\r\n\r\nThe first I knew of it, I heard the hall-men laughing about the string\r\nthey had given him. Next he held a serious conference with me, in\r\nwhich he told me of his millions and the plot to deprive him of them,\r\nand in which he appointed me his detective. I did my best to let him\r\ndown gently, speaking vaguely of a mistake, and that it was another\r\nman with a similar name who was the rightful heir. I left him quite\r\ncooled down; but I couldn\'t keep the hall-men away from him, and they\r\ncontinued to string him worse than ever. In the end, after a most\r\nviolent scene, he threw me down, revoked my private detectiveship, and\r\nwent on strike. My trade in safety pins ceased. He refused to make any\r\nmore safety pins, and he peppered me with raw material through the\r\nbars of his cell when I passed by.\r\n\r\nI could never make it up with him. The other hall-men told him that I\r\nwas a detective in the employ of the conspirators. And in the meantime\r\nthe hall-men drove him mad with their stringing. His fictitious wrongs\r\npreyed upon his mind, and at last he became a dangerous and homicidal\r\nlunatic. The guards refused to listen to his tale of stolen millions,\r\nand he accused them of being in the plot. One day he threw a pannikin\r\nof hot tea over one of them, and then his case was investigated. The\r\nwarden talked with him a few minutes through the bars of his cell.\r\nThen he was taken away for examination before the doctors. He never\r\ncame back, and I often wonder if he is dead, or if he still gibbers\r\nabout his millions in some asylum for the insane.\r\n\r\nAt last came the day of days, my release. It was the day of release\r\nfor the Third Hall-man as well, and the short-timer girl I had won for\r\nhim was waiting for him outside the wall. They went away blissfully\r\ntogether. My pal and I went out together, and together we walked down\r\ninto Buffalo. Were we not to be together always? We begged together on\r\nthe "main-drag" that day for pennies, and what we received was spent\r\nfor "shupers" of beer--I don\'t know how they are spelled, but they are\r\npronounced the way I have spelled them, and they cost three cents. I\r\nwas watching my chance all the time for a get-away. From some bo on\r\nthe drag I managed to learn what time a certain freight pulled out. I\r\ncalculated my time accordingly. When the moment came, my pal and I\r\nwere in a saloon. Two foaming shupers were before us. I\'d have liked\r\nto say good-by. He had been good to me. But I did not dare. I went out\r\nthrough the rear of the saloon and jumped the fence. It was a swift\r\nsneak, and a few minutes later I was on board a freight and heading\r\nsouth on the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOBOES THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of my tramping I encountered hundreds of hoboes, whom I\r\nhailed or who hailed me, and with whom I waited at water-tanks,\r\n"boiled-up," cooked "mulligans," "battered" the "drag" or "privates,"\r\nand beat trains, and who passed and were seen never again. On the\r\nother hand, there were hoboes who passed and repassed with amazing\r\nfrequency, and others, still, who passed like ghosts, close at hand,\r\nunseen, and never seen.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the latter that I chased clear across Canada over three\r\nthousand miles of railroad, and never once did I lay eyes on him. His\r\n"monica" was Skysail Jack. I first ran into it at Montreal. Carved\r\nwith a jack-knife was the skysail-yard of a ship. It was perfectly\r\nexecuted. Under it was "Skysail Jack." Above was "B.W. 9-15-94." This\r\nlatter conveyed the information that he had passed through Montreal\r\nbound west, on October 15, 1894. He had one day the start of me.\r\n"Sailor Jack" was my monica at that particular time, and promptly I\r\ncarved it alongside of his, along with the date and the information\r\nthat I, too, was bound west.\r\n\r\nI had misfortune in getting over the next hundred miles, and eight\r\ndays later I picked up Skysail Jack\'s trail three hundred miles west\r\nof Ottawa. There it was, carved on a water-tank, and by the date I saw\r\nthat he likewise had met with delay. He was only two days ahead of me.\r\nI was a "comet" and "tramp-royal," so was Skysail Jack; and it was up\r\nto my pride and reputation to catch up with him. I "railroaded" day\r\nand night, and I passed him; then turn about he passed me. Sometimes\r\nhe was a day or so ahead, and sometimes I was. From hoboes, bound\r\neast, I got word of him occasionally, when he happened to be ahead;\r\nand from them I learned that he had become interested in Sailor Jack\r\nand was making inquiries about me.\r\n\r\nWe\'d have made a precious pair, I am sure, if we\'d ever got together;\r\nbut get together we couldn\'t. I kept ahead of him clear across\r\nManitoba, but he led the way across Alberta, and early one bitter gray\r\nmorning, at the end of a division just east of Kicking Horse Pass, I\r\nlearned that he had been seen the night before between Kicking Horse\r\nPass and Rogers\' Pass. It was rather curious the way the information\r\ncame to me. I had been riding all night in a "side-door Pullman"\r\n(box-car), and nearly dead with cold had crawled out at the division\r\nto beg for food. A freezing fog was drifting past, and I "hit" some\r\nfiremen I found in the round-house. They fixed me up with the leavings\r\nfrom their lunch-pails, and in addition I got out of them nearly a\r\nquart of heavenly "Java" (coffee). I heated the latter, and, as I sat\r\ndown to eat, a freight pulled in from the west. I saw a side-door open\r\nand a road-kid climb out. Through the drifting fog he limped over to\r\nme. He was stiff with cold, his lips blue. I shared my Java and grub\r\nwith him, learned about Skysail Jack, and then learned about him.\r\nBehold, he was from my own town, Oakland, California, and he was a\r\nmember of the celebrated Boo Gang--a gang with which I had affiliated\r\nat rare intervals. We talked fast and bolted the grub in the half-hour\r\nthat followed. Then my freight pulled out, and I was on it, bound west\r\non the trail of Skysail Jack.\r\n\r\nI was delayed between the passes, went two days without food, and\r\nwalked eleven miles on the third day before I got any, and yet I\r\nsucceeded in passing Skysail Jack along the Fraser River in British\r\nColumbia. I was riding "passengers" then and making time; but he must\r\nhave been riding passengers, too, and with more luck or skill than I,\r\nfor he got into Mission ahead of me.\r\n\r\nNow Mission was a junction, forty miles east of Vancouver. From the\r\njunction one could proceed south through Washington and Oregon over\r\nthe Northern Pacific. I wondered which way Skysail Jack would go, for\r\nI thought I was ahead of him. As for myself I was still bound west to\r\nVancouver. I proceeded to the water-tank to leave that information,\r\nand there, freshly carved, with that day\'s date upon it, was Skysail\r\nJack\'s monica. I hurried on into Vancouver. But he was gone. He had\r\ntaken ship immediately and was still flying west on his\r\nworld-adventure. Truly, Skysail Jack, you were a tramp-royal, and your\r\nmate was the "wind that tramps the world." I take off my hat to you.\r\nYou were "blowed-in-the-glass" all right. A week later I, too, got my\r\nship, and on board the steamship Umatilla, in the forecastle, was\r\nworking my way down the coast to San Francisco. Skysail Jack and\r\nSailor Jack--gee! if we\'d ever got together.\r\n\r\nWater-tanks are tramp directories. Not all in idle wantonness do\r\ntramps carve their monicas, dates, and courses. Often and often have I\r\nmet hoboes earnestly inquiring if I had seen anywhere such and such a\r\n"stiff" or his monica. And more than once I have been able to give the\r\nmonica of recent date, the water-tank, and the direction in which he\r\nwas then bound. And promptly the hobo to whom I gave the information\r\nlit out after his pal. I have met hoboes who, in trying to catch a\r\npal, had pursued clear across the continent and back again, and were\r\nstill going.\r\n\r\n"Monicas" are the nom-de-rails that hoboes assume or accept when\r\nthrust upon them by their fellows. Leary Joe, for instance, was timid,\r\nand was so named by his fellows. No self-respecting hobo would select\r\nStew Bum for himself. Very few tramps care to remember their pasts\r\nduring which they ignobly worked, so monicas based upon trades are\r\nvery rare, though I remember having met the following: Moulder\r\nBlackey, Painter Red, Chi Plumber, Boiler-Maker, Sailor Boy, and\r\nPrinter Bo. "Chi" (pronounced shy), by the way, is the argot for\r\n"Chicago."\r\n\r\nA favorite device of hoboes is to base their monicas on the localities\r\nfrom which they hail, as: New York Tommy, Pacific Slim, Buffalo\r\nSmithy, Canton Tim, Pittsburg Jack, Syracuse Shine, Troy Mickey, K.L.\r\nBill, and Connecticut Jimmy. Then there was "Slim Jim from Vinegar\r\nHill, who never worked and never will." A "shine" is always a negro,\r\nso called, possibly, from the high lights on his countenance. Texas\r\nShine or Toledo Shine convey both race and nativity.\r\n\r\nAmong those that incorporated their race, I recollect the following:\r\nFrisco Sheeny, New York Irish, Michigan French, English Jack, Cockney\r\nKid, and Milwaukee Dutch. Others seem to take their monicas in part\r\nfrom the color-schemes stamped upon them at birth, such as: Chi\r\nWhitey, New Jersey Red, Boston Blackey, Seattle Browney, and Yellow\r\nDick and Yellow Belly--the last a Creole from Mississippi, who, I\r\nsuspect, had his monica thrust upon him.\r\n\r\nTexas Royal, Happy Joe, Bust Connors, Burley Bo, Tornado Blackey, and\r\nTouch McCall used more imagination in rechristening themselves.\r\nOthers, with less fancy, carry the names of their physical\r\npeculiarities, such as: Vancouver Slim, Detroit Shorty, Ohio Fatty,\r\nLong Jack, Big Jim, Little Joe, New York Blink, Chi Nosey, and\r\nBroken-backed Ben.\r\n\r\nBy themselves come the road-kids, sporting an infinite variety of\r\nmonicas. For example, the following, whom here and there I have\r\nencountered: Buck Kid, Blind Kid, Midget Kid, Holy Kid, Bat Kid, Swift\r\nKid, Cookey Kid, Monkey Kid, Iowa Kid, Corduroy Kid, Orator Kid (who\r\ncould tell how it happened), and Lippy Kid (who was insolent, depend\r\nupon it).\r\n\r\nOn the water-tank at San Marcial, New Mexico, a dozen years ago, was\r\nthe following hobo bill of fare:--\r\n\r\n  (1) Main-drag fair.\r\n  (2) Bulls not hostile.\r\n  (3) Round-house good for kipping.\r\n  (4) North-bound trains no good.\r\n  (5) Privates no good.\r\n  (6) Restaurants good for cooks only.\r\n  (7) Railroad House good for night-work only.\r\n\r\nNumber one conveys the information that begging for money on the main\r\nstreet is fair; number two, that the police will not bother hoboes;\r\nnumber three, that one can sleep in the round-house. Number four,\r\nhowever, is ambiguous. The north-bound trains may be no good to beat,\r\nand they may be no good to beg. Number five means that the residences\r\nare not good to beggars, and number six means that only hoboes that\r\nhave been cooks can get grub from the restaurants. Number seven\r\nbothers me. I cannot make out whether the Railroad House is a good\r\nplace for any hobo to beg at night, or whether it is good only for\r\nhobo-cooks to beg at night, or whether any hobo, cook or non-cook, can\r\nlend a hand at night, helping the cooks of the Railroad House with\r\ntheir dirty work and getting something to eat in payment.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the hoboes that pass in the night. I remember one I\r\nmet in California. He was a Swede, but he had lived so long in the\r\nUnited States that one couldn\'t guess his nationality. He had to tell\r\nit on himself. In fact, he had come to the United States when no more\r\nthan a baby. I ran into him first at the mountain town of Truckee.\r\n"Which way, Bo?" was our greeting, and "Bound east" was the answer\r\neach of us gave. Quite a bunch of "stiffs" tried to ride out the\r\noverland that night, and I lost the Swede in the shuffle. Also, I lost\r\nthe overland.\r\n\r\nI arrived in Reno, Nevada, in a box-car that was promptly\r\nside-tracked. It was a Sunday morning, and after I threw my feet for\r\nbreakfast, I wandered over to the Piute camp to watch the Indians\r\ngambling. And there stood the Swede, hugely interested. Of course we\r\ngot together. He was the only acquaintance I had in that region, and I\r\nwas his only acquaintance. We rushed together like a couple of\r\ndissatisfied hermits, and together we spent the day, threw our feet\r\nfor dinner, and late in the afternoon tried to "nail" the same\r\nfreight. But he was ditched, and I rode her out alone, to be ditched\r\nmyself in the desert twenty miles beyond.\r\n\r\nOf all desolate places, the one at which I was ditched was the limit.\r\nIt was called a flag-station, and it consisted of a shanty dumped\r\ninconsequentially into the sand and sagebrush. A chill wind was\r\nblowing, night was coming on, and the solitary telegraph operator who\r\nlived in the shanty was afraid of me. I knew that neither grub nor bed\r\ncould I get out of him. It was because of his manifest fear of me that\r\nI did not believe him when he told me that east-bound trains never\r\nstopped there. Besides, hadn\'t I been thrown off of an east-bound\r\ntrain right at that very spot not five minutes before? He assured me\r\nthat it had stopped under orders, and that a year might go by before\r\nanother was stopped under orders. He advised me that it was only a\r\ndozen or fifteen miles on to Wadsworth and that I\'d better hike. I\r\nelected to wait, however, and I had the pleasure of seeing two\r\nwest-bound freights go by without stopping, and one east-bound\r\nfreight. I wondered if the Swede was on the latter. It was up to me to\r\nhit the ties to Wadsworth, and hit them I did, much to the telegraph\r\noperator\'s relief, for I neglected to burn his shanty and murder him.\r\nTelegraph operators have much to be thankful for. At the end of half a\r\ndozen miles, I had to get off the ties and let the east-bound overland\r\ngo by. She was going fast, but I caught sight of a dim form on the\r\nfirst "blind" that looked like the Swede.\r\n\r\nThat was the last I saw of him for weary days. I hit the high places\r\nacross those hundreds of miles of Nevada desert, riding the overlands\r\nat night, for speed, and in the day-time riding in box-cars and\r\ngetting my sleep. It was early in the year, and it was cold in those\r\nupland pastures. Snow lay here and there on the level, all the\r\nmountains were shrouded in white, and at night the most miserable wind\r\nimaginable blew off from them. It was not a land in which to linger.\r\nAnd remember, gentle reader, the hobo goes through such a land,\r\nwithout shelter, without money, begging his way and sleeping at night\r\nwithout blankets. This last is something that can be realized only by\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nIn the early evening I came down to the depot at Ogden. The overland\r\nof the Union Pacific was pulling east, and I was bent on making\r\nconnections. Out in the tangle of tracks ahead of the engine I\r\nencountered a figure slouching through the gloom. It was the Swede. We\r\nshook hands like long-lost brothers, and discovered that our hands\r\nwere gloved. "Where\'d ye glahm \'em?" I asked. "Out of an engine-cab,"\r\nhe answered; "and where did you?" "They belonged to a fireman," said\r\nI; "he was careless."\r\n\r\nWe caught the blind as the overland pulled out, and mighty cold we\r\nfound it. The way led up a narrow gorge between snow-covered\r\nmountains, and we shivered and shook and exchanged confidences about\r\nhow we had covered the ground between Reno and Ogden. I had closed my\r\neyes for only an hour or so the previous night, and the blind was not\r\ncomfortable enough to suit me for a snooze. At a stop, I went forward\r\nto the engine. We had on a "double-header" (two engines) to take us\r\nover the grade.\r\n\r\nThe pilot of the head engine, because it "punched the wind," I knew\r\nwould be too cold; so I selected the pilot of the second engine, which\r\nwas sheltered by the first engine. I stepped on the cowcatcher and\r\nfound the pilot occupied. In the darkness I felt out the form of a\r\nyoung boy. He was sound asleep. By squeezing, there was room for two\r\non the pilot, and I made the boy budge over and crawled up beside him.\r\nIt was a "good" night; the "shacks" (brakemen) didn\'t bother us, and\r\nin no time we were asleep. Once in a while hot cinders or heavy jolts\r\naroused me, when I snuggled closer to the boy and dozed off to the\r\ncoughing of the engines and the screeching of the wheels.\r\n\r\nThe overland made Evanston, Wyoming, and went no farther. A wreck\r\nahead blocked the line. The dead engineer had been brought in, and his\r\nbody attested the peril of the way. A tramp, also, had been killed,\r\nbut his body had not been brought in. I talked with the boy. He was\r\nthirteen years old. He had run away from his folks in some place in\r\nOregon, and was heading east to his grandmother. He had a tale of\r\ncruel treatment in the home he had left that rang true; besides, there\r\nwas no need for him to lie to me, a nameless hobo on the track.\r\n\r\nAnd that boy was going some, too. He couldn\'t cover the ground fast\r\nenough. When the division superintendents decided to send the overland\r\nback over the way it had come, then up on a cross "jerk" to the Oregon\r\nShort Line, and back along that road to tap the Union Pacific the\r\nother side of the wreck, that boy climbed upon the pilot and said he\r\nwas going to stay with it. This was too much for the Swede and me. It\r\nmeant travelling the rest of that frigid night in order to gain no\r\nmore than a dozen miles or so. We said we\'d wait till the wreck was\r\ncleared away, and in the meantime get a good sleep.\r\n\r\nNow it is no snap to strike a strange town, broke, at midnight, in\r\ncold weather, and find a place to sleep. The Swede hadn\'t a penny. My\r\ntotal assets consisted of two dimes and a nickel. From some of the\r\ntown boys we learned that beer was five cents, and that the saloons\r\nkept open all night. There was our meat. Two glasses of beer would\r\ncost ten cents, there would be a stove and chairs, and we could sleep\r\nit out till morning. We headed for the lights of a saloon, walking\r\nbriskly, the snow crunching under our feet, a chill little wind\r\nblowing through us.\r\n\r\nAlas, I had misunderstood the town boys. Beer was five cents in one\r\nsaloon only in the whole burg, and we didn\'t strike that saloon. But\r\nthe one we entered was all right. A blessed stove was roaring\r\nwhite-hot; there were cosey, cane-bottomed arm-chairs, and a\r\nnone-too-pleasant-looking barkeeper who glared suspiciously at us as\r\nwe came in. A man cannot spend continuous days and nights in his\r\nclothes, beating trains, fighting soot and cinders, and sleeping\r\nanywhere, and maintain a good "front." Our fronts were decidedly\r\nagainst us; but what did we care? I had the price in my jeans.\r\n\r\n"Two beers," said I nonchalantly to the barkeeper, and while he drew\r\nthem, the Swede and I leaned against the bar and yearned secretly for\r\nthe arm-chairs by the stove.\r\n\r\nThe barkeeper set the two foaming glasses before us, and with pride I\r\ndeposited the ten cents. Now I was dead game. As soon as I learned my\r\nerror in the price I\'d have dug up another ten cents. Never mind if it\r\ndid leave me only a nickel to my name, a stranger in a strange land.\r\nI\'d have paid it all right. But that barkeeper never gave me a chance.\r\nAs soon as his eyes spotted the dime I had laid down, he seized the\r\ntwo glasses, one in each hand, and dumped the beer into the sink\r\nbehind the bar. At the same time, glaring at us malevolently, he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got scabs on your nose. You\'ve got scabs on your nose. You\'ve\r\ngot scabs on your nose. See!"\r\n\r\nI hadn\'t either, and neither had the Swede. Our noses were all right.\r\nThe direct bearing of his words was beyond our comprehension, but the\r\nindirect bearing was clear as print: he didn\'t like our looks, and\r\nbeer was evidently ten cents a glass.\r\n\r\nI dug down and laid another dime on the bar, remarking carelessly,\r\n"Oh, I thought this was a five-cent joint."\r\n\r\n"Your money\'s no good here," he answered, shoving the two dimes across\r\nthe bar to me.\r\n\r\nSadly I dropped them back into my pocket, sadly we yearned toward the\r\nblessed stove and the arm-chairs, and sadly we went out the door into\r\nthe frosty night.\r\n\r\nBut as we went out the door, the barkeeper, still glaring, called\r\nafter us, "You\'ve got scabs on your nose, see!"\r\n\r\nI have seen much of the world since then, journeyed among strange\r\nlands and peoples, opened many books, sat in many lecture-halls; but\r\nto this day, though I have pondered long and deep, I have been unable\r\nto divine the meaning in the cryptic utterance of that barkeeper in\r\nEvanston, Wyoming. Our noses _were_ all right.\r\n\r\nWe slept that night over the boilers in an electric-lighting plant.\r\nHow we discovered that "kipping" place I can\'t remember. We must have\r\njust headed for it, instinctively, as horses head for water or\r\ncarrier-pigeons head for the home-cote. But it was a night not\r\npleasant to remember. A dozen hoboes were ahead of us on top the\r\nboilers, and it was too hot for all of us. To complete our misery, the\r\nengineer would not let us stand around down below. He gave us our\r\nchoice of the boilers or the outside snow.\r\n\r\n"You said you wanted to sleep, and so, damn you, sleep," said he to\r\nme, when, frantic and beaten out by the heat, I came down into the\r\nfire-room.\r\n\r\n"Water," I gasped, wiping the sweat from my eyes, "water."\r\n\r\nHe pointed out of doors and assured me that down there somewhere in\r\nthe blackness I\'d find the river. I started for the river, got lost in\r\nthe dark, fell into two or three drifts, gave it up, and returned\r\nhalf-frozen to the top of the boilers. When I had thawed out, I was\r\nthirstier than ever. Around me the hoboes were moaning, groaning,\r\nsobbing, sighing, gasping, panting, rolling and tossing and\r\nfloundering heavily in their torment. We were so many lost souls\r\ntoasting on a griddle in hell, and the engineer, Satan Incarnate, gave\r\nus the sole alternative of freezing in the outer cold. The Swede sat\r\nup and anathematized passionately the wanderlust in man that sent him\r\ntramping and suffering hardships such as that.\r\n\r\n"When I get back to Chicago," he perorated, "I\'m going to get a job\r\nand stick to it till hell freezes over. Then I\'ll go tramping again."\r\n\r\nAnd, such is the irony of fate, next day, when the wreck ahead was\r\ncleared, the Swede and I pulled out of Evanston in the ice-boxes of an\r\n"orange special," a fast freight laden with fruit from sunny\r\nCalifornia. Of course, the ice-boxes were empty on account of the cold\r\nweather, but that didn\'t make them any warmer for us. We entered them\r\nthrough hatchways in the top of the car; the boxes were constructed of\r\ngalvanized iron, and in that biting weather were not pleasant to the\r\ntouch. We lay there, shivered and shook, and with chattering teeth\r\nheld a council wherein we decided that we\'d stay by the ice-boxes day\r\nand night till we got out of the inhospitable plateau region and down\r\ninto the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nBut we must eat, and we decided that at the next division we would\r\nthrow our feet for grub and make a rush back to our ice-boxes. We\r\narrived in the town of Green River late in the afternoon, but too\r\nearly for supper. Before meal-time is the worst time for "battering"\r\nback-doors; but we put on our nerve, swung off the side-ladders as the\r\nfreight pulled into the yards, and made a run for the houses. We were\r\nquickly separated; but we had agreed to meet in the ice-boxes. I had\r\nbad luck at first; but in the end, with a couple of "hand-outs" poked\r\ninto my shirt, I chased for the train. It was pulling out and going\r\nfast. The particular refrigerator-car in which we were to meet had\r\nalready gone by, and half a dozen cars down the train from it I swung\r\non to the side-ladders, went up on top hurriedly, and dropped down\r\ninto an ice-box.\r\n\r\nBut a shack had seen me from the caboose, and at the next stop a few\r\nmiles farther on, Rock Springs, the shack stuck his head into my box\r\nand said: "Hit the grit, you son of a toad! Hit the grit!" Also he\r\ngrabbed me by the heels and dragged me out. I hit the grit all right,\r\nand the orange special and the Swede rolled on without me.\r\n\r\nSnow was beginning to fall. A cold night was coming on. After dark I\r\nhunted around in the railroad yards until I found an empty\r\nrefrigerator car. In I climbed--not into the ice-boxes, but into the\r\ncar itself. I swung the heavy doors shut, and their edges, covered\r\nwith strips of rubber, sealed the car air-tight. The walls were thick.\r\nThere was no way for the outside cold to get in. But the inside was\r\njust as cold as the outside. How to raise the temperature was the\r\nproblem. But trust a "profesh" for that. Out of my pockets I dug up\r\nthree or four newspapers. These I burned, one at a time, on the floor\r\nof the car. The smoke rose to the top. Not a bit of the heat could\r\nescape, and, comfortable and warm, I passed a beautiful night. I\r\ndidn\'t wake up once.\r\n\r\nIn the morning it was still snowing. While throwing my feet for\r\nbreakfast, I missed an east-bound freight. Later in the day I nailed\r\ntwo other freights and was ditched from both of them. All afternoon no\r\neast-bound trains went by. The snow was falling thicker than ever, but\r\nat twilight I rode out on the first blind of the overland. As I swung\r\naboard the blind from one side, somebody swung aboard from the other.\r\nIt was the boy who had run away from Oregon.\r\n\r\nNow the first blind of a fast train in a driving snow-storm is no\r\nsummer picnic. The wind goes right through one, strikes the front of\r\nthe car, and comes back again. At the first stop, darkness having come\r\non, I went forward and interviewed the fireman. I offered to "shove"\r\ncoal to the end of his run, which was Rawlins, and my offer was\r\naccepted. My work was out on the tender, in the snow, breaking the\r\nlumps of coal with a sledge and shovelling it forward to him in the\r\ncab. But as I did not have to work all the time, I could come into the\r\ncab and warm up now and again.\r\n\r\n"Say," I said to the fireman, at my first breathing spell, "there\'s a\r\nlittle kid back there on the first blind. He\'s pretty cold."\r\n\r\nThe cabs on the Union Pacific engines are quite spacious, and we\r\nfitted the kid into a warm nook in front of the high seat of the\r\nfireman, where the kid promptly fell asleep. We arrived at Rawlins at\r\nmidnight. The snow was thicker than ever. Here the engine was to go\r\ninto the round-house, being replaced by a fresh engine. As the train\r\ncame to a stop, I dropped off the engine steps plump into the arms of\r\na large man in a large overcoat. He began asking me questions, and I\r\npromptly demanded who he was. Just as promptly he informed me that he\r\nwas the sheriff. I drew in my horns and listened and answered.\r\n\r\nHe began describing the kid who was still asleep in the cab. I did\r\nsome quick thinking. Evidently the family was on the trail of the kid,\r\nand the sheriff had received telegraphed instructions from Oregon.\r\nYes, I had seen the kid. I had met him first in Ogden. The date\r\ntallied with the sheriff\'s information. But the kid was still behind\r\nsomewhere, I explained, for he had been ditched from that very\r\noverland that night when it pulled out of Rock Springs. And all the\r\ntime I was praying that the kid wouldn\'t wake up, come down out of the\r\ncab, and put the "kibosh" on me.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff left me in order to interview the shacks, but before he\r\nleft he said:--\r\n\r\n"Bo, this town is no place for you. Understand? You ride this train\r\nout, and make no mistake about it. If I catch you after it\'s gone ..."\r\n\r\nI assured him that it was not through desire that I was in his town;\r\nthat the only reason I was there was that the train had stopped there;\r\nand that he wouldn\'t see me for smoke the way I\'d get out of his darn\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nWhile he went to interview the shacks, I jumped back into the cab. The\r\nkid was awake and rubbing his eyes. I told him the news and advised\r\nhim to ride the engine into the round-house. To cut the story short,\r\nthe kid made the same overland out, riding the pilot, with\r\ninstructions to make an appeal to the fireman at the first stop for\r\npermission to ride in the engine. As for myself, I got ditched. The\r\nnew fireman was young and not yet lax enough to break the rules of the\r\nCompany against having tramps in the engine; so he turned down my\r\noffer to shove coal. I hope the kid succeeded with him, for all night\r\non the pilot in that blizzard would have meant death.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, I do not at this late day remember a detail of how I\r\nwas ditched at Rawlins. I remember watching the train as it was\r\nimmediately swallowed up in the snow-storm, and of heading for a\r\nsaloon to warm up. Here was light and warmth. Everything was in full\r\nblast and wide open. Faro, roulette, craps, and poker tables were\r\nrunning, and some mad cow-punchers were making the night merry. I had\r\njust succeeded in fraternizing with them and was downing my first\r\ndrink at their expense, when a heavy hand descended on my shoulder. I\r\nlooked around and sighed. It was the sheriff.\r\n\r\nWithout a word he led me out into the snow.\r\n\r\n"There\'s an orange special down there in the yards," said he.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a damn cold night," said I.\r\n\r\n"It pulls out in ten minutes," said he.\r\n\r\nThat was all. There was no discussion. And when that orange special\r\npulled out, I was in the ice-boxes. I thought my feet would freeze\r\nbefore morning, and the last twenty miles into Laramie I stood upright\r\nin the hatchway and danced up and down. The snow was too thick for the\r\nshacks to see me, and I didn\'t care if they did.\r\n\r\nMy quarter of a dollar bought me a hot breakfast at Laramie, and\r\nimmediately afterward I was on board the blind baggage of an overland\r\nthat was climbing to the pass through the backbone of the Rockies. One\r\ndoes not ride blind baggages in the daytime; but in this blizzard at\r\nthe top of the Rocky Mountains I doubted if the shacks would have the\r\nheart to put me off. And they didn\'t. They made a practice of coming\r\nforward at every stop to see if I was frozen yet.\r\n\r\nAt Ames\' Monument, at the summit of the Rockies,--I forget the\r\naltitude,--the shack came forward for the last time.\r\n\r\n"Say, Bo," he said, "you see that freight side-tracked over there to\r\nlet us go by?"\r\n\r\nI saw. It was on the next track, six feet away. A few feet more in\r\nthat storm and I could not have seen it.\r\n\r\n"Well, the \'after-push\' of Kelly\'s Army is in one of them cars.\r\nThey\'ve got two feet of straw under them, and there\'s so many of them\r\nthat they keep the car warm."\r\n\r\nHis advice was good, and I followed it, prepared, however, if it was a\r\n"con game" the shack had given me, to take the blind as the overland\r\npulled out. But it was straight goods. I found the car--a big\r\nrefrigerator car with the leeward door wide open for ventilation. Up I\r\nclimbed and in. I stepped on a man\'s leg, next on some other man\'s\r\narm. The light was dim, and all I could make out was arms and legs and\r\nbodies inextricably confused. Never was there such a tangle of\r\nhumanity. They were all lying in the straw, and over, and under, and\r\naround one another. Eighty-four husky hoboes take up a lot of room\r\nwhen they are stretched out. The men I stepped on were resentful.\r\nTheir bodies heaved under me like the waves of the sea, and imparted\r\nan involuntary forward movement to me. I could not find any straw to\r\nstep upon, so I stepped upon more men. The resentment increased, so\r\ndid my forward movement. I lost my footing and sat down with sharp\r\nabruptness. Unfortunately, it was on a man\'s head. The next moment he\r\nhad risen on his hands and knees in wrath, and I was flying through\r\nthe air. What goes up must come down, and I came down on another man\'s\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nWhat happened after that is very vague in my memory. It was like going\r\nthrough a threshing-machine. I was bandied about from one end of the\r\ncar to the other. Those eighty-four hoboes winnowed me out till what\r\nlittle was left of me, by some miracle, found a bit of straw to rest\r\nupon. I was initiated, and into a jolly crowd. All the rest of that\r\nday we rode through the blizzard, and to while the time away it was\r\ndecided that each man was to tell a story. It was stipulated that\r\neach story must be a good one, and, furthermore, that it must be a\r\nstory no one had ever heard before. The penalty for failure was the\r\nthreshing-machine. Nobody failed. And I want to say right here that\r\nnever in my life have I sat at so marvellous a story-telling debauch.\r\nHere were eighty-four men from all the world--I made eighty-five; and\r\neach man told a masterpiece. It had to be, for it was either\r\nmasterpiece or threshing-machine.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we arrived in Cheyenne. The blizzard was at its\r\nheight, and though the last meal of all of us had been breakfast, no\r\nman cared to throw his feet for supper. All night we rolled on through\r\nthe storm, and next day found us down on the sweet plains of Nebraska\r\nand still rolling. We were out of the storm and the mountains. The\r\nblessed sun was shining over a smiling land, and we had eaten nothing\r\nfor twenty-four hours. We found out that the freight would arrive\r\nabout noon at a town, if I remember right, that was called Grand\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nWe took up a collection and sent a telegram to the authorities of that\r\ntown. The text of the message was that eighty-five healthy, hungry\r\nhoboes would arrive about noon and that it would be a good idea to\r\nhave dinner ready for them. The authorities of Grand Island had two\r\ncourses open to them. They could feed us, or they could throw us in\r\njail. In the latter event they\'d have to feed us anyway, and they\r\ndecided wisely that one meal would be the cheaper way.\r\n\r\nWhen the freight rolled into Grand Island at noon, we were sitting on\r\nthe tops of the cars and dangling our legs in the sunshine. All the\r\npolice in the burg were on the reception committee. They marched us in\r\nsquads to the various hotels and restaurants, where dinners were\r\nspread for us. We had been thirty-six hours without food, and we\r\ndidn\'t have to be taught what to do. After that we were marched back\r\nto the railroad station. The police had thoughtfully compelled the\r\nfreight to wait for us. She pulled out slowly, and the eighty-five of\r\nus, strung out along the track, swarmed up the side-ladders. We\r\n"captured" the train.\r\n\r\nWe had no supper that evening--at least the "push" didn\'t, but I did.\r\nJust at supper time, as the freight was pulling out of a small town,\r\na man climbed into the car where I was playing pedro with three other\r\nstiffs. The man\'s shirt was bulging suspiciously. In his hand he\r\ncarried a battered quart-measure from which arose steam. I smelled\r\n"Java." I turned my cards over to one of the stiffs who was looking\r\non, and excused myself. Then, in the other end of the car, pursued by\r\nenvious glances, I sat down with the man who had climbed aboard and\r\nshared his "Java" and the hand-outs that had bulged his shirt. It was\r\nthe Swede.\r\n\r\nAt about ten o\'clock in the evening, we arrived at Omaha.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s shake the push," said the Swede to me.\r\n\r\n"Sure," said I.\r\n\r\nAs the freight pulled into Omaha, we made ready to do so. But the\r\npeople of Omaha were also ready. The Swede and I hung upon the\r\nside-ladders, ready to drop off. But the freight did not stop.\r\nFurthermore, long rows of policemen, their brass buttons and stars\r\nglittering in the electric lights, were lined up on each side of the\r\ntrack. The Swede and I knew what would happen to us if we ever dropped\r\noff into their arms. We stuck by the side-ladders, and the train\r\nrolled on across the Missouri River to Council Bluffs.\r\n\r\n"General" Kelly, with an army of two thousand hoboes, lay in camp at\r\nChautauqua Park, several miles away. The after-push we were with was\r\nGeneral Kelly\'s rear-guard, and, detraining at Council Bluffs, it\r\nstarted to march to camp. The night had turned cold, and heavy\r\nwind-squalls, accompanied by rain, were chilling and wetting us. Many\r\npolice were guarding us and herding us to the camp. The Swede and I\r\nwatched our chance and made a successful get-away.\r\n\r\nThe rain began coming down in torrents, and in the darkness, unable to\r\nsee our hands in front of our faces, like a pair of blind men we\r\nfumbled about for shelter. Our instinct served us, for in no time we\r\nstumbled upon a saloon--not a saloon that was open and doing business,\r\nnot merely a saloon that was closed for the night, and not even a\r\nsaloon with a permanent address, but a saloon propped up on big\r\ntimbers, with rollers underneath, that was being moved from somewhere\r\nto somewhere. The doors were locked. A squall of wind and rain drove\r\ndown upon us. We did not hesitate. Smash went the door, and in we\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nI have made some tough camps in my time, "carried the banner" in\r\ninfernal metropolises, bedded in pools of water, slept in the snow\r\nunder two blankets when the spirit thermometer registered seventy-four\r\ndegrees below zero (which is a mere trifle of one hundred and six\r\ndegrees of frost); but I want to say right here that never did I make\r\na tougher camp, pass a more miserable night, than that night I passed\r\nwith the Swede in the itinerant saloon at Council Bluffs. In the first\r\nplace, the building, perched up as it was in the air, had exposed a\r\nmultitude of openings in the floor through which the wind whistled. In\r\nthe second place, the bar was empty; there was no bottled fire-water\r\nwith which we could warm ourselves and forget our misery. We had no\r\nblankets, and in our wet clothes, wet to the skin, we tried to sleep.\r\nI rolled under the bar, and the Swede rolled under the table. The\r\nholes and crevices in the floor made it impossible, and at the end of\r\nhalf an hour I crawled up on top the bar. A little later the Swede\r\ncrawled up on top his table.\r\n\r\nAnd there we shivered and prayed for daylight. I know, for one, that I\r\nshivered until I could shiver no more, till the shivering muscles\r\nexhausted themselves and merely ached horribly. The Swede moaned and\r\ngroaned, and every little while, through chattering teeth, he\r\nmuttered, "Never again; never again." He muttered this phrase\r\nrepeatedly, ceaselessly, a thousand times; and when he dozed, he went\r\non muttering it in his sleep.\r\n\r\nAt the first gray of dawn we left our house of pain, and outside,\r\nfound ourselves in a mist, dense and chill. We stumbled on till we\r\ncame to the railroad track. I was going back to Omaha to throw my feet\r\nfor breakfast; my companion was going on to Chicago. The moment for\r\nparting had come. Our palsied hands went out to each other. We were\r\nboth shivering. When we tried to speak, our teeth chattered us back\r\ninto silence. We stood alone, shut off from the world; all that we\r\ncould see was a short length of railroad track, both ends of which\r\nwere lost in the driving mist. We stared dumbly at each other, our\r\nclasped hands shaking sympathetically. The Swede\'s face was blue with\r\nthe cold, and I know mine must have been.\r\n\r\n"Never again what?" I managed to articulate.\r\n\r\nSpeech strove for utterance in the Swede\'s throat; then faint and\r\ndistant, in a thin whisper from the very bottom of his frozen soul,\r\ncame the words:--\r\n\r\n"Never again a hobo."\r\n\r\nHe paused, and, as he went on again, his voice gathered strength and\r\nhuskiness as it affirmed his will.\r\n\r\n"Never again a hobo. I\'m going to get a job. You\'d better do the same.\r\nNights like this make rheumatism."\r\n\r\nHe wrung my hand.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, Bo," said he.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, Bo," said I.\r\n\r\nThe next we were swallowed up from each other by the mist. It was our\r\nfinal passing. But here\'s to you, Mr. Swede, wherever you are. I hope\r\nyou got that job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROAD-KIDS AND GAY-CATS\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while, in newspapers, magazines, and biographical\r\ndictionaries, I run upon sketches of my life, wherein, delicately\r\nphrased, I learn that it was in order to study sociology that I became\r\na tramp. This is very nice and thoughtful of the biographers, but it\r\nis inaccurate. I became a tramp--well, because of the life that was in\r\nme, of the wanderlust in my blood that would not let me rest.\r\nSociology was merely incidental; it came afterward, in the same manner\r\nthat a wet skin follows a ducking. I went on "The Road" because I\r\ncouldn\'t keep away from it; because I hadn\'t the price of the railroad\r\nfare in my jeans; because I was so made that I couldn\'t work all my\r\nlife on "one same shift"; because--well, just because it was easier to\r\nthan not to.\r\n\r\nIt happened in my own town, in Oakland, when I was sixteen. At that\r\ntime I had attained a dizzy reputation in my chosen circle of\r\nadventurers, by whom I was known as the Prince of the Oyster Pirates.\r\nIt is true, those immediately outside my circle, such as honest\r\nbay-sailors, longshoremen, yachtsmen, and the legal owners of the\r\noysters, called me "tough," "hoodlum," "smoudge," "thief," "robber,"\r\nand various other not nice things--all of which was complimentary and\r\nbut served to increase the dizziness of the high place in which I sat.\r\nAt that time I had not read "Paradise Lost," and later, when I read\r\nMilton\'s "Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven," I was fully\r\nconvinced that great minds run in the same channels.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the fortuitous concatenation of events sent\r\nme upon my first adventure on The Road. It happened that there was\r\nnothing doing in oysters just then; that at Benicia, forty miles away,\r\nI had some blankets I wanted to get; and that at Port Costa, several\r\nmiles from Benicia, a stolen boat lay at anchor in charge of the\r\nconstable. Now this boat was owned by a friend of mine, by name Dinny\r\nMcCrea. It had been stolen and left at Port Costa by Whiskey Bob,\r\nanother friend of mine. (Poor Whiskey Bob! Only last winter his body\r\nwas picked up on the beach shot full of holes by nobody knows whom.)\r\nI had come down from "up river" some time before, and reported to\r\nDinny McCrea the whereabouts of his boat; and Dinny McCrea had\r\npromptly offered ten dollars to me if I should bring it down to\r\nOakland to him.\r\n\r\nTime was heavy on my hands. I sat on the dock and talked it over with\r\nNickey the Greek, another idle oyster pirate. "Let\'s go," said I, and\r\nNickey was willing. He was "broke." I possessed fifty cents and a\r\nsmall skiff. The former I invested and loaded into the latter in the\r\nform of crackers, canned corned beef, and a ten-cent bottle of French\r\nmustard. (We were keen on French mustard in those days.) Then, late in\r\nthe afternoon, we hoisted our small spritsail and started. We sailed\r\nall night, and next morning, on the first of a glorious flood-tide, a\r\nfair wind behind us, we came booming up the Carquinez Straits to Port\r\nCosta. There lay the stolen boat, not twenty-five feet from the wharf.\r\nWe ran alongside and doused our little spritsail. I sent Nickey\r\nforward to lift the anchor, while I began casting off the gaskets.\r\n\r\nA man ran out on the wharf and hailed us. It was the constable. It\r\nsuddenly came to me that I had neglected to get a written\r\nauthorization from Dinny McCrea to take possession of his boat. Also,\r\nI knew that constable wanted to charge at least twenty-five dollars in\r\nfees for capturing the boat from Whiskey Bob and subsequently taking\r\ncare of it. And my last fifty cents had been blown in for corned beef\r\nand French mustard, and the reward was only ten dollars anyway. I shot\r\na glance forward to Nickey. He had the anchor up-and-down and was\r\nstraining at it. "Break her out," I whispered to him, and turned and\r\nshouted back to the constable. The result was that he and I were\r\ntalking at the same time, our spoken thoughts colliding in mid-air and\r\nmaking gibberish.\r\n\r\nThe constable grew more imperative, and perforce I had to listen.\r\nNickey was heaving on the anchor till I thought he\'d burst a\r\nblood-vessel. When the constable got done with his threats and\r\nwarnings, I asked him who he was. The time he lost in telling me\r\nenabled Nickey to break out the anchor. I was doing some quick\r\ncalculating. At the feet of the constable a ladder ran down the dock\r\nto the water, and to the ladder was moored a skiff. The oars were in\r\nit. But it was padlocked. I gambled everything on that padlock. I\r\nfelt the breeze on my cheek, saw the surge of the tide, looked at the\r\nremaining gaskets that confined the sail, ran my eyes up the halyards\r\nto the blocks and knew that all was clear, and then threw off all\r\ndissimulation.\r\n\r\n"In with her!" I shouted to Nickey, and sprang to the gaskets, casting\r\nthem loose and thanking my stars that Whiskey Bob had tied them in\r\nsquare-knots instead of "grannies."\r\n\r\nThe constable had slid down the ladder and was fumbling with a key at\r\nthe padlock. The anchor came aboard and the last gasket was loosed at\r\nthe same instant that the constable freed the skiff and jumped to the\r\noars.\r\n\r\n"Peak-halyards!" I commanded my crew, at the same time swinging on to\r\nthe throat-halyards. Up came the sail on the run. I belayed and ran\r\naft to the tiller.\r\n\r\n"Stretch her!" I shouted to Nickey at the peak. The constable was just\r\nreaching for our stern. A puff of wind caught us, and we shot away. It\r\nwas great. If I\'d had a black flag, I know I\'d have run it up in\r\ntriumph. The constable stood up in the skiff, and paled the glory of\r\nthe day with the vividness of his language. Also, he wailed for a gun.\r\nYou see, that was another gamble we had taken.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we weren\'t stealing the boat. It wasn\'t the constable\'s. We\r\nwere merely stealing his fees, which was his particular form of graft.\r\nAnd we weren\'t stealing the fees for ourselves, either; we were\r\nstealing them for my friend, Dinny McCrea.\r\n\r\nBenicia was made in a few minutes, and a few minutes later my blankets\r\nwere aboard. I shifted the boat down to the far end of Steamboat\r\nWharf, from which point of vantage we could see anybody coming after\r\nus. There was no telling. Maybe the Port Costa constable would\r\ntelephone to the Benicia constable. Nickey and I held a council of\r\nwar. We lay on deck in the warm sun, the fresh breeze on our cheeks,\r\nthe flood-tide rippling and swirling past. It was impossible to start\r\nback to Oakland till afternoon, when the ebb would begin to run. But\r\nwe figured that the constable would have an eye out on the Carquinez\r\nStraits when the ebb started, and that nothing remained for us but to\r\nwait for the following ebb, at two o\'clock next morning, when we\r\ncould slip by Cerberus in the darkness.\r\n\r\nSo we lay on deck, smoked cigarettes, and were glad that we were\r\nalive. I spat over the side and gauged the speed of the current.\r\n\r\n"With this wind, we could run this flood clear to Rio Vista," I said.\r\n\r\n"And it\'s fruit-time on the river," said Nickey.\r\n\r\n"And low water on the river," said I. "It\'s the best time of the year\r\nto make Sacramento."\r\n\r\nWe sat up and looked at each other. The glorious west wind was pouring\r\nover us like wine. We both spat over the side and gauged the current.\r\nNow I contend that it was all the fault of that flood-tide and fair\r\nwind. They appealed to our sailor instinct. If it had not been for\r\nthem, the whole chain of events that was to put me upon The Road would\r\nhave broken down.\r\n\r\nWe said no word, but cast off our moorings and hoisted sail. Our\r\nadventures up the Sacramento River are no part of this narrative. We\r\nsubsequently made the city of Sacramento and tied up at a wharf. The\r\nwater was fine, and we spent most of our time in swimming. On the\r\nsand-bar above the railroad bridge we fell in with a bunch of boys\r\nlikewise in swimming. Between swims we lay on the bank and talked.\r\nThey talked differently from the fellows I had been used to herding\r\nwith. It was a new vernacular. They were road-kids, and with every\r\nword they uttered the lure of The Road laid hold of me more\r\nimperiously.\r\n\r\n"When I was down in Alabama," one kid would begin; or, another,\r\n"Coming up on the C. & A. from K.C."; whereat, a third kid, "On the C.\r\n& A. there ain\'t no steps to the \'blinds.\'" And I would lie silently\r\nin the sand and listen. "It was at a little town in Ohio on the Lake\r\nShore and Michigan Southern," a kid would start; and another, "Ever\r\nride the Cannonball on the Wabash?"; and yet another, "Nope, but I\'ve\r\nbeen on the White Mail out of Chicago." "Talk about railroadin\'--wait\r\ntill you hit the Pennsylvania, four tracks, no water tanks, take water\r\non the fly, that\'s goin\' some." "The Northern Pacific\'s a bad road\r\nnow." "Salinas is on the \'hog,\' the \'bulls\' is \'horstile.\'" "I got\r\n\'pinched\' at El Paso, along with Moke Kid." "Talkin\' of \'poke-outs,\'\r\nwait till you hit the French country out of Montreal--not a word of\r\nEnglish--you say, \'Mongee, Madame, mongee, no spika da French,\' an\'\r\nrub your stomach an\' look hungry, an\' she gives you a slice of\r\nsow-belly an\' a chunk of dry \'punk.\'"\r\n\r\nAnd I continued to lie in the sand and listen. These wanderers made my\r\noyster-piracy look like thirty cents. A new world was calling to me in\r\nevery word that was spoken--a world of rods and gunnels, blind\r\nbaggages and "side-door Pullmans," "bulls" and "shacks," "floppings"\r\nand "chewin\'s," "pinches" and "get-aways," "strong arms" and\r\n"bindle-stiffs," "punks" and "profesh." And it all spelled Adventure.\r\nVery well; I would tackle this new world. I "lined" myself up\r\nalongside those road-kids. I was just as strong as any of them, just\r\nas quick, just as nervy, and my brain was just as good.\r\n\r\nAfter the swim, as evening came on, they dressed and went up town. I\r\nwent along. The kids began "battering" the "main-stem" for "light\r\npieces," or, in other words, begging for money on the main street. I\r\nhad never begged in my life, and this was the hardest thing for me to\r\nstomach when I first went on The Road. I had absurd notions about\r\nbegging. My philosophy, up to that time, was that it was finer to\r\nsteal than to beg; and that robbery was finer still because the risk\r\nand the penalty were proportionately greater. As an oyster pirate I\r\nhad already earned convictions at the hands of justice, which, if I\r\nhad tried to serve them, would have required a thousand years in\r\nstate\'s prison. To rob was manly; to beg was sordid and despicable.\r\nBut I developed in the days to come all right, all right, till I came\r\nto look upon begging as a joyous prank, a game of wits, a\r\nnerve-exerciser.\r\n\r\nThat first night, however, I couldn\'t rise to it; and the result was\r\nthat when the kids were ready to go to a restaurant and eat, I wasn\'t.\r\nI was broke. Meeny Kid, I think it was, gave me the price, and we all\r\nate together. But while I ate, I meditated. The receiver, it was said,\r\nwas as bad as the thief; Meeny Kid had done the begging, and I was\r\nprofiting by it. I decided that the receiver was a whole lot worse\r\nthan the thief, and that it shouldn\'t happen again. And it didn\'t. I\r\nturned out next day and threw my feet as well as the next one.\r\n\r\nNickey the Greek\'s ambition didn\'t run to The Road. He was not a\r\nsuccess at throwing his feet, and he stowed away one night on a barge\r\nand went down river to San Francisco. I met him, only a week ago, at a\r\npugilistic carnival. He has progressed. He sat in a place of honor at\r\nthe ring-side. He is now a manager of prize-fighters and proud of it.\r\nIn fact, in a small way, in local sportdom, he is quite a shining\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n"No kid is a road-kid until he has gone over \'the hill\'"--such was the\r\nlaw of The Road I heard expounded in Sacramento. All right, I\'d go\r\nover the hill and matriculate. "The hill," by the way, was the Sierra\r\nNevadas. The whole gang was going over the hill on a jaunt, and of\r\ncourse I\'d go along. It was French Kid\'s first adventure on The Road.\r\nHe had just run away from his people in San Francisco. It was up to\r\nhim and me to deliver the goods. In passing, I may remark that my old\r\ntitle of "Prince" had vanished. I had received my "monica." I was now\r\n"Sailor Kid," later to be known as "\'Frisco Kid," when I had put the\r\nRockies between me and my native state.\r\n\r\nAt 10.20 P.M. the Central Pacific overland pulled out of the depot at\r\nSacramento for the East--that particular item of time-table is\r\nindelibly engraved on my memory. There were about a dozen in our gang,\r\nand we strung out in the darkness ahead of the train ready to take her\r\nout. All the local road-kids that we knew came down to see us\r\noff--also, to "ditch" us if they could. That was their idea of a joke,\r\nand there were only about forty of them to carry it out. Their\r\nring-leader was a crackerjack road-kid named Bob. Sacramento was his\r\nhome town, but he\'d hit The Road pretty well everywhere over the whole\r\ncountry. He took French Kid and me aside and gave us advice something\r\nlike this: "We\'re goin\' to try an\' ditch your bunch, see? Youse two\r\nare weak. The rest of the push can take care of itself. So, as soon as\r\nyouse two nail a blind, deck her. An\' stay on the decks till youse\r\npass Roseville Junction, at which burg the constables are horstile,\r\nsloughin\' in everybody on sight."\r\n\r\nThe engine whistled and the overland pulled out. There were three\r\nblinds on her--room for all of us. The dozen of us who were trying to\r\nmake her out would have preferred to slip aboard quietly; but our\r\nforty friends crowded on with the most amazing and shameless\r\npublicity and advertisement. Following Bob\'s advice, I immediately\r\n"decked her," that is, climbed up on top of the roof of one of the\r\nmail-cars. There I lay down, my heart jumping a few extra beats, and\r\nlistened to the fun. The whole train crew was forward, and the\r\nditching went on fast and furious. After the train had run half a\r\nmile, it stopped, and the crew came forward again and ditched the\r\nsurvivors. I, alone, had made the train out.\r\n\r\nBack at the depot, about him two or three of the push that had\r\nwitnessed the accident, lay French Kid with both legs off. French Kid\r\nhad slipped or stumbled--that was all, and the wheels had done the\r\nrest. Such was my initiation to The Road. It was two years afterward\r\nwhen I next saw French Kid and examined his "stumps." This was an act\r\nof courtesy. "Cripples" always like to have their stumps examined. One\r\nof the entertaining sights on The Road is to witness the meeting of\r\ntwo cripples. Their common disability is a fruitful source of\r\nconversation; and they tell how it happened, describe what they know\r\nof the amputation, pass critical judgment on their own and each\r\nother\'s surgeons, and wind up by withdrawing to one side, taking off\r\nbandages and wrappings, and comparing stumps.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until several days later, over in Nevada, when the push\r\ncaught up with me, that I learned of French Kid\'s accident. The push\r\nitself arrived in bad condition. It had gone through a train-wreck in\r\nthe snow-sheds; Happy Joe was on crutches with two mashed legs, and\r\nthe rest were nursing skins and bruises.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I lay on the roof of the mail-car, trying to remember\r\nwhether Roseville Junction, against which burg Bob had warned me, was\r\nthe first stop or the second stop. To make sure, I delayed descending\r\nto the platform of the blind until after the second stop. And then I\r\ndidn\'t descend. I was new to the game, and I felt safer where I was.\r\nBut I never told the push that I held down the decks the whole night,\r\nclear across the Sierras, through snow-sheds and tunnels, and down to\r\nTruckee on the other side, where I arrived at seven in the morning.\r\nSuch a thing was disgraceful, and I\'d have been a common\r\nlaughing-stock. This is the first time I have confessed the truth\r\nabout that first ride over the hill. As for the push, it decided that\r\nI was all right, and when I came back over the hill to Sacramento, I\r\nwas a full-fledged road-kid.\r\n\r\nYet I had much to learn. Bob was my mentor, and he was all right. I\r\nremember one evening (it was fair-time in Sacramento, and we were\r\nknocking about and having a good time) when I lost my hat in a fight.\r\nThere was I bare-headed in the street, and it was Bob to the rescue.\r\nHe took me to one side from the push and told me what to do. I was a\r\nbit timid of his advice. I had just come out of jail, where I had been\r\nthree days, and I knew that if the police "pinched" me again, I\'d get\r\ngood and "soaked." On the other hand, I couldn\'t show the white\r\nfeather. I\'d been over the hill, I was running full-fledged with the\r\npush, and it was up to me to deliver the goods. So I accepted Bob\'s\r\nadvice, and he came along with me to see that I did it up brown.\r\n\r\nWe took our position on K Street, on the corner, I think, of Fifth. It\r\nwas early in the evening and the street was crowded. Bob studied the\r\nhead-gear of every Chinaman that passed. I used to wonder how the\r\nroad-kids all managed to wear "five-dollar Stetson stiff-rims," and\r\nnow I knew. They got them, the way I was going to get mine, from the\r\nChinese. I was nervous--there were so many people about; but Bob was\r\ncool as an iceberg. Several times, when I started forward toward a\r\nChinaman, all nerved and keyed up, Bob dragged me back. He wanted me\r\nto get a good hat, and one that fitted. Now a hat came by that was the\r\nright size but not new; and, after a dozen impossible hats, along\r\nwould come one that was new but not the right size. And when one did\r\ncome by that was new and the right size, the rim was too large or not\r\nlarge enough. My, Bob was finicky. I was so wrought up that I\'d have\r\nsnatched any kind of a head-covering.\r\n\r\nAt last came the hat, the one hat in Sacramento for me. I knew it was\r\na winner as soon as I looked at it. I glanced at Bob. He sent a\r\nsweeping look-about for police, then nodded his head. I lifted the hat\r\nfrom the Chinaman\'s head and pulled it down on my own. It was a\r\nperfect fit. Then I started. I heard Bob crying out, and I caught a\r\nglimpse of him blocking the irate Mongolian and tripping him up. I ran\r\non. I turned up the next corner, and around the next. This street was\r\nnot so crowded as K, and I walked along in quietude, catching my\r\nbreath and congratulating myself upon my hat and my get-away.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, around the corner at my back, came the bare-headed\r\nChinaman. With him were a couple more Chinamen, and at their heels\r\nwere half a dozen men and boys. I sprinted to the next corner, crossed\r\nthe street, and rounded the following corner. I decided that I had\r\nsurely played him out, and I dropped into a walk again. But around the\r\ncorner at my heels came that persistent Mongolian. It was the old\r\nstory of the hare and the tortoise. He could not run so fast as I, but\r\nhe stayed with it, plodding along at a shambling and deceptive trot,\r\nand wasting much good breath in noisy imprecations. He called all\r\nSacramento to witness the dishonor that had been done him, and a\r\ngoodly portion of Sacramento heard and flocked at his heels. And I ran\r\non like the hare, and ever that persistent Mongolian, with the\r\nincreasing rabble, overhauled me. But finally, when a policeman had\r\njoined his following, I let out all my links. I twisted and turned,\r\nand I swear I ran at least twenty blocks on the straight away. And I\r\nnever saw that Chinaman again. The hat was a dandy, a brand-new\r\nStetson, just out of the shop, and it was the envy of the whole push.\r\nFurthermore, it was the symbol that I had delivered the goods. I wore\r\nit for over a year.\r\n\r\nRoad-kids are nice little chaps--when you get them alone and they are\r\ntelling you "how it happened"; but take my word for it, watch out for\r\nthem when they run in pack. Then they are wolves, and like wolves they\r\nare capable of dragging down the strongest man. At such times they are\r\nnot cowardly. They will fling themselves upon a man and hold on with\r\nevery ounce of strength in their wiry bodies, till he is thrown and\r\nhelpless. More than once have I seen them do it, and I know whereof I\r\nspeak. Their motive is usually robbery. And watch out for the "strong\r\narm." Every kid in the push I travelled with was expert at it. Even\r\nFrench Kid mastered it before he lost his legs.\r\n\r\nI have strong upon me now a vision of what I once saw in "The\r\nWillows." The Willows was a clump of trees in a waste piece of land\r\nnear the railway depot and not more than five minutes walk from the\r\nheart of Sacramento. It is night-time and the scene is illumined by\r\nthe thin light of stars. I see a husky laborer in the midst of a pack\r\nof road-kids. He is infuriated and cursing them, not a bit afraid,\r\nconfident of his own strength. He weighs about one hundred and eighty\r\npounds, and his muscles are hard; but he doesn\'t know what he is up\r\nagainst. The kids are snarling. It is not pretty. They make a rush\r\nfrom all sides, and he lashes out and whirls. Barber Kid is standing\r\nbeside me. As the man whirls, Barber Kid leaps forward and does the\r\ntrick. Into the man\'s back goes his knee; around the man\'s neck, from\r\nbehind, passes his right hand, the bone of the wrist pressing against\r\nthe jugular vein. Barber Kid throws his whole weight backward. It is a\r\npowerful leverage. Besides, the man\'s wind has been shut off. It is\r\nthe strong arm.\r\n\r\nThe man resists, but he is already practically helpless. The road-kids\r\nare upon him from every side, clinging to arms and legs and body, and\r\nlike a wolf at the throat of a moose Barber Kid hangs on and drags\r\nbackward. Over the man goes, and down under the heap. Barber Kid\r\nchanges the position of his own body, but never lets go. While some of\r\nthe kids are "going through" the victim, others are holding his legs\r\nso that he cannot kick and thresh about. They improve the opportunity\r\nby taking off the man\'s shoes. As for him, he has given in. He is\r\nbeaten. Also, what of the strong arm at his throat, he is short of\r\nwind. He is making ugly choking noises, and the kids hurry. They\r\nreally don\'t want to kill him. All is done. At a word all holds are\r\nreleased at once, and the kids scatter, one of them lugging the\r\nshoes--he knows where he can get half a dollar for them. The man sits\r\nup and looks about him, dazed and helpless. Even if he wanted to,\r\nbarefooted pursuit in the darkness would be hopeless. I linger a\r\nmoment and watch him. He is feeling at his throat, making dry, hawking\r\nnoises, and jerking his head in a quaint way as though to assure\r\nhimself that the neck is not dislocated. Then I slip away to join the\r\npush, and see that man no more--though I shall always see him, sitting\r\nthere in the starlight, somewhat dazed, a bit frightened, greatly\r\ndishevelled, and making quaint jerking movements of head and neck.\r\n\r\nDrunken men are the especial prey of the road-kids. Robbing a drunken\r\nman they call "rolling a stiff"; and wherever they are, they are on\r\nthe constant lookout for drunks. The drunk is their particular meat,\r\nas the fly is the particular meat of the spider. The rolling of a\r\nstiff is ofttimes an amusing sight, especially when the stiff is\r\nhelpless and when interference is unlikely. At the first swoop the\r\nstiff\'s money and jewellery go. Then the kids sit around their victim\r\nin a sort of pow-wow. A kid generates a fancy for the stiff\'s necktie.\r\nOff it comes. Another kid is after underclothes. Off they come, and a\r\nknife quickly abbreviates arms and legs. Friendly hoboes may be called\r\nin to take the coat and trousers, which are too large for the kids.\r\nAnd in the end they depart, leaving beside the stiff the heap of their\r\ndiscarded rags.\r\n\r\nAnother vision comes to me. It is a dark night. My push is coming\r\nalong the sidewalk in the suburbs. Ahead of us, under an electric\r\nlight, a man crosses the street diagonally. There is something\r\ntentative and desultory in his walk. The kids scent the game on the\r\ninstant. The man is drunk. He blunders across the opposite sidewalk\r\nand is lost in the darkness as he takes a short-cut through a vacant\r\nlot. No hunting cry is raised, but the pack flings itself forward in\r\nquick pursuit. In the middle of the vacant lot it comes upon him. But\r\nwhat is this?--snarling and strange forms, small and dim and menacing,\r\nare between the pack and its prey. It is another pack of road-kids,\r\nand in the hostile pause we learn that it is their meat, that they\r\nhave been trailing it a dozen blocks and more and that we are butting\r\nin. But it is the world primeval. These wolves are baby wolves. (As a\r\nmatter of fact, I don\'t think one of them was over twelve or thirteen\r\nyears of age. I met some of them afterward, and learned that they had\r\njust arrived that day over the hill, and that they hailed from Denver\r\nand Salt Lake City.) Our pack flings forward. The baby wolves squeal\r\nand screech and fight like little demons. All about the drunken man\r\nrages the struggle for the possession of him. Down he goes in the\r\nthick of it, and the combat rages over his body after the fashion of\r\nthe Greeks and Trojans over the body and armor of a fallen hero. Amid\r\ncries and tears and wailings the baby wolves are dispossessed, and my\r\npack rolls the stiff. But always I remember the poor stiff and his\r\nbefuddled amazement at the abrupt eruption of battle in the vacant\r\nlot. I see him now, dim in the darkness, titubating in stupid wonder,\r\ngood-naturedly essaying the role of peacemaker in that multitudinous\r\nscrap the significance of which he did not understand, and the really\r\nhurt expression on his face when he, unoffending he, was clutched at\r\nby many hands and dragged down in the thick of the press.\r\n\r\n"Bindle-stiffs" are favorite prey of the road-kids. A bindle-stiff is\r\na working tramp. He takes his name from the roll of blankets he\r\ncarries, which is known as a "bindle." Because he does work, a\r\nbindle-stiff is expected usually to have some small change about him,\r\nand it is after that small change that the road-kids go. The best\r\nhunting-ground for bindle-stiffs is in the sheds, barns, lumber-yards,\r\nrailroad-yards, etc., on the edges of a city, and the time for hunting\r\nis the night, when the bindle-stiff seeks these places to roll up in\r\nhis blankets and sleep.\r\n\r\n"Gay-cats" also come to grief at the hands of the road-kid. In more\r\nfamiliar parlance, gay-cats are short-horns, _chechaquos_, new chums,\r\nor tenderfeet. A gay-cat is a newcomer on The Road who is man-grown,\r\nor, at least, youth-grown. A boy on The Road, on the other hand, no\r\nmatter how green he is, is never a gay-cat; he is a road-kid or a\r\n"punk," and if he travels with a "profesh," he is known possessively\r\nas a "prushun." I was never a prushun, for I did not take kindly to\r\npossession. I was first a road-kid and then a profesh. Because I\r\nstarted in young, I practically skipped my gay-cat apprenticeship. For\r\na short period, during the time I was exchanging my \'Frisco Kid monica\r\nfor that of Sailor Jack, I labored under the suspicion of being a\r\ngay-cat. But closer acquaintance on the part of those that suspected\r\nme quickly disabused their minds, and in a short time I acquired the\r\nunmistakable airs and ear-marks of the blowed-in-the-glass profesh.\r\nAnd be it known, here and now, that the profesh are the aristocracy of\r\nThe Road. They are the lords and masters, the aggressive men, the\r\nprimordial noblemen, the _blond beasts_ so beloved of Nietzsche.\r\n\r\nWhen I came back over the hill from Nevada, I found that some river\r\npirate had stolen Dinny McCrea\'s boat. (A funny thing at this day is\r\nthat I cannot remember what became of the skiff in which Nickey the\r\nGreek and I sailed from Oakland to Port Costa. I know that the\r\nconstable didn\'t get it, and I know that it didn\'t go with us up the\r\nSacramento River, and that is all I do know.) With the loss of Dinny\r\nMcCrea\'s boat, I was pledged to The Road; and when I grew tired of\r\nSacramento, I said good-by to the push (which, in its friendly way,\r\ntried to ditch me from a freight as I left town) and started on a\r\n_passear_ down the valley of the San Joaquin. The Road had gripped me\r\nand would not let me go; and later, when I had voyaged to sea and done\r\none thing and another, I returned to The Road to make longer flights,\r\nto be a "comet" and a profesh, and to plump into the bath of sociology\r\nthat wet me to the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO THOUSAND STIFFS\r\n\r\n\r\nA "stiff" is a tramp. It was once my fortune to travel a few weeks\r\nwith a "push" that numbered two thousand. This was known as "Kelly\'s\r\nArmy." Across the wild and woolly West, clear from California, General\r\nKelly and his heroes had captured trains; but they fell down when they\r\ncrossed the Missouri and went up against the effete East. The East\r\nhadn\'t the slightest intention of giving free transportation to two\r\nthousand hoboes. Kelly\'s Army lay helplessly for some time at Council\r\nBluffs. The day I joined it, made desperate by delay, it marched out\r\nto capture a train.\r\n\r\nIt was quite an imposing sight. General Kelly sat a magnificent black\r\ncharger, and with waving banners, to the martial music of fife and\r\ndrum corps, company by company, in two divisions, his two thousand\r\nstiffs countermarched before him and hit the wagon-road to the little\r\nburg of Weston, seven miles away. Being the latest recruit, I was in\r\nthe last company, of the last regiment, of the Second Division, and,\r\nfurthermore, in the last rank of the rear-guard. The army went into\r\ncamp at Weston beside the railroad track--beside the tracks, rather,\r\nfor two roads went through: the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul, and\r\nthe Rock Island.\r\n\r\nOur intention was to take the first train out, but the railroad\r\nofficials "coppered" our play--and won. There was no first train. They\r\ntied up the two lines and stopped running trains. In the meantime,\r\nwhile we lay by the dead tracks, the good people of Omaha and Council\r\nBluffs were bestirring themselves. Preparations were making to form a\r\nmob, capture a train in Council Bluffs, run it down to us, and make us\r\na present of it. The railroad officials coppered that play, too. They\r\ndidn\'t wait for the mob. Early in the morning of the second day, an\r\nengine, with a single private car attached, arrived at the station and\r\nside-tracked. At this sign that life had renewed in the dead roads,\r\nthe whole army lined up beside the track.\r\n\r\nBut never did life renew so monstrously on a dead railroad as it did\r\non those two roads. From the west came the whistle of a locomotive.\r\nIt was coming in our direction, bound east. We were bound east. A stir\r\nof preparation ran down our ranks. The whistle tooted fast and\r\nfuriously, and the train thundered at top speed. The hobo didn\'t live\r\nthat could have boarded it. Another locomotive whistled, and another\r\ntrain came through at top speed, and another, and another, train after\r\ntrain, train after train, till toward the last the trains were\r\ncomposed of passenger coaches, box-cars, flat-cars, dead engines,\r\ncabooses, mail-cars, wrecking appliances, and all the riff-raff of\r\nworn-out and abandoned rolling-stock that collects in the yards of\r\ngreat railways. When the yards at Council Bluffs had been completely\r\ncleaned, the private car and engine went east, and the tracks died for\r\nkeeps.\r\n\r\nThat day went by, and the next, and nothing moved, and in the\r\nmeantime, pelted by sleet, and rain, and hail, the two thousand hoboes\r\nlay beside the track. But that night the good people of Council Bluffs\r\nwent the railroad officials one better. A mob formed in Council\r\nBluffs, crossed the river to Omaha, and there joined with another mob\r\nin a raid on the Union Pacific yards. First they captured an engine,\r\nnext they knocked a train together, and then the united mobs piled\r\naboard, crossed the Missouri, and ran down the Rock Island right of\r\nway to turn the train over to us. The railway officials tried to\r\ncopper this play, but fell down, to the mortal terror of the section\r\nboss and one member of the section gang at Weston. This pair, under\r\nsecret telegraphic orders, tried to wreck our train-load of\r\nsympathizers by tearing up the track. It happened that we were\r\nsuspicious and had our patrols out. Caught red-handed at\r\ntrain-wrecking, and surrounded by twenty hundred infuriated hoboes,\r\nthat section-gang boss and assistant prepared to meet death. I don\'t\r\nremember what saved them, unless it was the arrival of the train.\r\n\r\nIt was our turn to fall down, and we did, hard. In their haste, the\r\ntwo mobs had neglected to make up a sufficiently long train. There\r\nwasn\'t room for two thousand hoboes to ride. So the mobs and the\r\nhoboes had a talkfest, fraternized, sang songs, and parted, the mobs\r\ngoing back on their captured train to Omaha, the hoboes pulling out\r\nnext morning on a hundred-and-forty-mile march to Des Moines. It was\r\nnot until Kelly\'s Army crossed the Missouri that it began to walk,\r\nand after that it never rode again. It cost the railroads slathers of\r\nmoney, but they were acting on principle, and they won.\r\n\r\nUnderwood, Leola, Menden, Avoca, Walnut, Marno, Atlantic, Wyoto,\r\nAnita, Adair, Adam, Casey, Stuart, Dexter, Carlham, De Soto, Van\r\nMeter, Booneville, Commerce, Valley Junction--how the names of the\r\ntowns come back to me as I con the map and trace our route through the\r\nfat Iowa country! And the hospitable Iowa farmer-folk! They turned out\r\nwith their wagons and carried our baggage; gave us hot lunches at noon\r\nby the wayside; mayors of comfortable little towns made speeches of\r\nwelcome and hastened us on our way; deputations of little girls and\r\nmaidens came out to meet us, and the good citizens turned out by\r\nhundreds, locked arms, and marched with us down their main streets. It\r\nwas circus day when we came to town, and every day was circus day, for\r\nthere were many towns.\r\n\r\nIn the evenings our camps were invaded by whole populations. Every\r\ncompany had its campfire, and around each fire something was doing.\r\nThe cooks in my company, Company L, were song-and-dance artists and\r\ncontributed most of our entertainment. In another part of the\r\nencampment the glee club would be singing--one of its star voices was\r\nthe "Dentist," drawn from Company L, and we were mighty proud of him.\r\nAlso, he pulled teeth for the whole army, and, since the extractions\r\nusually occurred at meal-time, our digestions were stimulated by\r\nvariety of incident. The Dentist had no anaesthetics, but two or three\r\nof us were always on tap to volunteer to hold down the patient. In\r\naddition to the stunts of the companies and the glee club, church\r\nservices were usually held, local preachers officiating, and always\r\nthere was a great making of political speeches. All these things ran\r\nneck and neck; it was a full-blown Midway. A lot of talent can be dug\r\nout of two thousand hoboes. I remember we had a picked baseball nine,\r\nand on Sundays we made a practice of putting it all over the local\r\nnines. Sometimes we did it twice on Sundays.\r\n\r\nLast year, while on a lecturing trip, I rode into Des Moines in a\r\nPullman--I don\'t mean a "side-door Pullman," but the real thing. On\r\nthe outskirts of the city I saw the old stove-works, and my heart\r\nleaped. It was there, at the stove-works, a dozen years before, that\r\nthe Army lay down and swore a mighty oath that its feet were sore and\r\nthat it would walk no more. We took possession of the stove-works and\r\ntold Des Moines that we had come to stay--that we\'d walked in, but\r\nwe\'d be blessed if we\'d walk out. Des Moines was hospitable, but this\r\nwas too much of a good thing. Do a little mental arithmetic, gentle\r\nreader. Two thousand hoboes, eating three square meals, make six\r\nthousand meals per day, forty-two thousand meals per week, or one\r\nhundred and sixty-eight thousand meals per shortest month in the\r\ncalendar. That\'s going some. We had no money. It was up to Des Moines.\r\n\r\nDes Moines was desperate. We lay in camp, made political speeches,\r\nheld sacred concerts, pulled teeth, played baseball and seven-up, and\r\nate our six thousand meals per day, and Des Moines paid for it. Des\r\nMoines pleaded with the railroads, but they were obdurate; they had\r\nsaid we shouldn\'t ride, and that settled it. To permit us to ride\r\nwould be to establish a precedent, and there weren\'t going to be any\r\nprecedents. And still we went on eating. That was the terrifying\r\nfactor in the situation. We were bound for Washington, and Des Moines\r\nwould have had to float municipal bonds to pay all our railroad fares,\r\neven at special rates, and if we remained much longer, she\'d have to\r\nfloat bonds anyway to feed us.\r\n\r\nThen some local genius solved the problem. We wouldn\'t walk. Very\r\ngood. We should ride. From Des Moines to Keokuk on the Mississippi\r\nflowed the Des Moines River. This particular stretch of river was\r\nthree hundred miles long. We could ride on it, said the local genius;\r\nand, once equipped with floating stock, we could ride on down the\r\nMississippi to the Ohio, and thence up the Ohio, winding up with a\r\nshort portage over the mountains to Washington.\r\n\r\nDes Moines took up a subscription. Public-spirited citizens\r\ncontributed several thousand dollars. Lumber, rope, nails, and cotton\r\nfor calking were bought in large quantities, and on the banks of the\r\nDes Moines was inaugurated a tremendous era of shipbuilding. Now the\r\nDes Moines is a picayune stream, unduly dignified by the appellation\r\nof "river." In our spacious western land it would be called a "creek."\r\nThe oldest inhabitants shook their heads and said we couldn\'t make it,\r\nthat there wasn\'t enough water to float us. Des Moines didn\'t care,\r\nso long as it got rid of us, and we were such well-fed optimists that\r\nwe didn\'t care either.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, May 9, 1894, we got under way and started on our\r\ncolossal picnic. Des Moines had got off pretty easily, and she\r\ncertainly owes a statue in bronze to the local genius who got her out\r\nof her difficulty. True, Des Moines had to pay for our boats; we had\r\neaten sixty-six thousand meals at the stove-works; and we took twelve\r\nthousand additional meals along with us in our commissary--as a\r\nprecaution against famine in the wilds; but then, think what it would\r\nhave meant if we had remained at Des Moines eleven months instead of\r\neleven days. Also, when we departed, we promised Des Moines we\'d come\r\nback if the river failed to float us.\r\n\r\nIt was all very well having twelve thousand meals in the commissary,\r\nand no doubt the commissary "ducks" enjoyed them; for the commissary\r\npromptly got lost, and my boat, for one, never saw it again. The\r\ncompany formation was hopelessly broken up during the river-trip. In\r\nany camp of men there will always be found a certain percentage of\r\nshirks, of helpless, of just ordinary, and of hustlers. There were ten\r\nmen in my boat, and they were the cream of Company L. Every man was a\r\nhustler. For two reasons I was included in the ten. First, I was as\r\ngood a hustler as ever "threw his feet," and next, I was "Sailor\r\nJack." I understood boats and boating. The ten of us forgot the\r\nremaining forty men of Company L, and by the time we had missed one\r\nmeal we promptly forgot the commissary. We were independent. We went\r\ndown the river "on our own," hustling our "chewin\'s," beating every\r\nboat in the fleet, and, alas that I must say it, sometimes taking\r\npossession of the stores the farmer-folk had collected for the Army.\r\n\r\nFor a good part of the three hundred miles we were from half a day to\r\na day or so in advance of the Army. We had managed to get hold of\r\nseveral American flags. When we approached a small town, or when we\r\nsaw a group of farmers gathered on the bank, we ran up our flags,\r\ncalled ourselves the "advance boat," and demanded to know what\r\nprovisions had been collected for the Army. We represented the Army,\r\nof course, and the provisions were turned over to us. But there\r\nwasn\'t anything small about us. We never took more than we could get\r\naway with. But we did take the cream of everything. For instance, if\r\nsome philanthropic farmer had donated several dollars\' worth of\r\ntobacco, we took it. So, also, we took butter and sugar, coffee and\r\ncanned goods; but when the stores consisted of sacks of beans and\r\nflour, or two or three slaughtered steers, we resolutely refrained and\r\nwent our way, leaving orders to turn such provisions over to the\r\ncommissary boats whose business was to follow behind us.\r\n\r\nMy, but the ten of us did live on the fat of the land! For a long time\r\nGeneral Kelly vainly tried to head us off. He sent two rowers, in a\r\nlight, round-bottomed boat, to overtake us and put a stop to our\r\npiratical careers. They overtook us all right, but they were two and\r\nwe were ten. They were empowered by General Kelly to make us\r\nprisoners, and they told us so. When we expressed disinclination to\r\nbecome prisoners, they hurried ahead to the next town to invoke the\r\naid of the authorities. We went ashore immediately and cooked an early\r\nsupper; and under the cloak of darkness we ran by the town and its\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nI kept a diary on part of the trip, and as I read it over now I note\r\none persistently recurring phrase, namely, "Living fine." We did live\r\nfine. We even disdained to use coffee boiled in water. We made our\r\ncoffee out of milk, calling the wonderful beverage, if I remember\r\nrightly, "pale Vienna."\r\n\r\nWhile we were ahead, skimming the cream, and while the commissary was\r\nlost far behind, the main Army, coming along in the middle, starved.\r\nThis was hard on the Army, I\'ll allow; but then, the ten of us were\r\nindividualists. We had initiative and enterprise. We ardently believed\r\nthat the grub was to the man who got there first, the pale Vienna to\r\nthe strong. On one stretch the Army went forty-eight hours without\r\ngrub; and then it arrived at a small village of some three hundred\r\ninhabitants, the name of which I do not remember, though I think it\r\nwas Red Rock. This town, following the practice of all towns through\r\nwhich the Army passed, had appointed a committee of safety. Counting\r\nfive to a family, Red Rock consisted of sixty households. Her\r\ncommittee of safety was scared stiff by the eruption of two thousand\r\nhungry hoboes who lined their boats two and three deep along the\r\nriver bank. General Kelly was a fair man. He had no intention of\r\nworking a hardship on the village. He did not expect sixty households\r\nto furnish two thousand meals. Besides, the Army had its\r\ntreasure-chest.\r\n\r\nBut the committee of safety lost its head. "No encouragement to the\r\ninvader" was its programme, and when General Kelly wanted to buy food,\r\nthe committee turned him down. It had nothing to sell; General Kelly\'s\r\nmoney was "no good" in their burg. And then General Kelly went into\r\naction. The bugles blew. The Army left the boats and on top of the\r\nbank formed in battle array. The committee was there to see. General\r\nKelly\'s speech was brief.\r\n\r\n"Boys," he said, "when did you eat last?"\r\n\r\n"Day before yesterday," they shouted.\r\n\r\n"Are you hungry?"\r\n\r\nA mighty affirmation from two thousand throats shook the atmosphere.\r\nThen General Kelly turned to the committee of safety:--\r\n\r\n"You see, gentlemen, the situation. My men have eaten nothing in\r\nforty-eight hours. If I turn them loose upon your town, I\'ll not be\r\nresponsible for what happens. They are desperate. I offered to buy\r\nfood for them, but you refused to sell. I now withdraw my offer.\r\nInstead, I shall demand. I give you five minutes to decide. Either\r\nkill me six steers and give me four thousand rations, or I turn the\r\nmen loose. Five minutes, gentlemen."\r\n\r\nThe terrified committee of safety looked at the two thousand hungry\r\nhoboes and collapsed. It didn\'t wait the five minutes. It wasn\'t going\r\nto take any chances. The killing of the steers and the collecting of\r\nthe requisition began forthwith, and the Army dined.\r\n\r\nAnd still the ten graceless individualists soared along ahead and\r\ngathered in everything in sight. But General Kelly fixed us. He sent\r\nhorsemen down each bank, warning farmers and townspeople against us.\r\nThey did their work thoroughly, all right. The erstwhile hospitable\r\nfarmers met us with the icy mit. Also, they summoned the constables\r\nwhen we tied up to the bank, and loosed the dogs. I know. Two of the\r\nlatter caught me with a barbed-wire fence between me and the river. I\r\nwas carrying two buckets of milk for the pale Vienna. I didn\'t damage\r\nthe fence any; but we drank plebian coffee boiled with vulgar water,\r\nand it was up to me to throw my feet for another pair of trousers. I\r\nwonder, gentle reader, if you ever essayed hastily to climb a\r\nbarbed-wire fence with a bucket of milk in each hand. Ever since that\r\nday I have had a prejudice against barbed wire, and I have gathered\r\nstatistics on the subject.\r\n\r\nUnable to make an honest living so long as General Kelly kept his two\r\nhorsemen ahead of us, we returned to the Army and raised a revolution.\r\nIt was a small affair, but it devastated Company L of the Second\r\nDivision. The captain of Company L refused to recognize us; said we\r\nwere deserters, and traitors, and scalawags; and when he drew rations\r\nfor Company L from the commissary, he wouldn\'t give us any. That\r\ncaptain didn\'t appreciate us, or he wouldn\'t have refused us grub.\r\nPromptly we intrigued with the first lieutenant. He joined us with the\r\nten men in his boat, and in return we elected him captain of Company\r\nM. The captain of Company L raised a roar. Down upon us came General\r\nKelly, Colonel Speed, and Colonel Baker. The twenty of us stood firm,\r\nand our revolution was ratified.\r\n\r\nBut we never bothered with the commissary. Our hustlers drew better\r\nrations from the farmers. Our new captain, however, doubted us. He\r\nnever knew when he\'d see the ten of us again, once we got under way in\r\nthe morning, so he called in a blacksmith to clinch his captaincy. In\r\nthe stern of our boat, one on each side, were driven two heavy\r\neye-bolts of iron. Correspondingly, on the bow of his boat, were\r\nfastened two huge iron hooks. The boats were brought together, end on,\r\nthe hooks dropped into the eye-bolts, and there we were, hard and\r\nfast. We couldn\'t lose that captain. But we were irrepressible. Out of\r\nour very manacles we wrought an invincible device that enabled us to\r\nput it all over every other boat in the fleet.\r\n\r\nLike all great inventions, this one of ours was accidental. We\r\ndiscovered it the first time we ran on a snag in a bit of a rapid. The\r\nhead-boat hung up and anchored, and the tail-boat swung around in the\r\ncurrent, pivoting the head-boat on the snag. I was at the stern of the\r\ntail-boat, steering. In vain we tried to shove off. Then I ordered the\r\nmen from the head-boat into the tail-boat. Immediately the head-boat\r\nfloated clear, and its men returned into it. After that, snags, reefs,\r\nshoals, and bars had no terrors for us. The instant the head-boat\r\nstruck, the men in it leaped into the tail-boat. Of course, the\r\nhead-boat floated over the obstruction and the tail-boat then struck.\r\nLike automatons, the twenty men now in the tail-boat leaped into the\r\nhead-boat, and the tail-boat floated past.\r\n\r\nThe boats used by the Army were all alike, made by the mile and sawed\r\noff. They were flat-boats, and their lines were rectangles. Each boat\r\nwas six feet wide, ten feet long, and a foot and a half deep. Thus,\r\nwhen our two boats were hooked together, I sat at the stern steering a\r\ncraft twenty feet long, containing twenty husky hoboes who "spelled"\r\neach other at the oars and paddles, and loaded with blankets, cooking\r\noutfit, and our own private commissary.\r\n\r\nStill we caused General Kelly trouble. He had called in his horsemen,\r\nand substituted three police-boats that travelled in the van and\r\nallowed no boats to pass them. The craft containing Company M crowded\r\nthe police-boats hard. We could have passed them easily, but it was\r\nagainst the rules. So we kept a respectful distance astern and waited.\r\nAhead we knew was virgin farming country, unbegged and generous; but\r\nwe waited. White water was all we needed, and when we rounded a bend\r\nand a rapid showed up we knew what would happen. Smash! Police-boat\r\nnumber one goes on a boulder and hangs up. Bang! Police-boat number\r\ntwo follows suit. Whop! Police-boat number three encounters the common\r\nfate of all. Of course our boat does the same things; but one, two,\r\nthe men are out of the head-boat and into the tail-boat; one, two,\r\nthey are out of the tail-boat and into the head-boat; and one, two,\r\nthe men who belong in the tail-boat are back in it and we are dashing\r\non. "Stop! you blankety-blank-blanks!" shriek the police-boats. "How\r\ncan we?--blank the blankety-blank river, anyway!" we wail plaintively\r\nas we surge past, caught in that remorseless current that sweeps us on\r\nout of sight and into the hospitable farmer-country that replenishes\r\nour private commissary with the cream of its contributions. Again we\r\ndrink pale Vienna and realize that the grub is to the man who gets\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nPoor General Kelly! He devised another scheme. The whole fleet\r\nstarted ahead of us. Company M of the Second Division started in its\r\nproper place in the line, which was last. And it took us only one day\r\nto put the "kibosh" on that particular scheme. Twenty-five miles of\r\nbad water lay before us--all rapids, shoals, bars, and boulders. It\r\nwas over that stretch of water that the oldest inhabitants of Des\r\nMoines had shaken their heads. Nearly two hundred boats entered the\r\nbad water ahead of us, and they piled up in the most astounding\r\nmanner. We went through that stranded fleet like hemlock through the\r\nfire. There was no avoiding the boulders, bars, and snags except by\r\ngetting out on the bank. We didn\'t avoid them. We went right over\r\nthem, one, two, one, two, head-boat, tail-boat, head-boat, tail-boat,\r\nall hands back and forth and back again. We camped that night alone,\r\nand loafed in camp all of next day while the Army patched and repaired\r\nits wrecked boats and straggled up to us.\r\n\r\nThere was no stopping our cussedness. We rigged up a mast, piled on\r\nthe canvas (blankets), and travelled short hours while the Army worked\r\nover-time to keep us in sight. Then General Kelly had recourse to\r\ndiplomacy. No boat could touch us in the straight-away. Without\r\ndiscussion, we were the hottest bunch that ever came down the Des\r\nMoines. The ban of the police-boats was lifted. Colonel Speed was put\r\naboard, and with this distinguished officer we had the honor of\r\narriving first at Keokuk on the Mississippi. And right here I want to\r\nsay to General Kelly and Colonel Speed that here\'s my hand. You were\r\nheroes, both of you, and you were men. And I\'m sorry for at least ten\r\nper cent of the trouble that was given you by the head-boat of Company\r\nM.\r\n\r\nAt Keokuk the whole fleet was lashed together in a huge raft, and,\r\nafter being wind-bound a day, a steamboat took us in tow down the\r\nMississippi to Quincy, Illinois, where we camped across the river on\r\nGoose Island. Here the raft idea was abandoned, the boats being joined\r\ntogether in groups of four and decked over. Somebody told me that\r\nQuincy was the richest town of its size in the United States. When I\r\nheard this, I was immediately overcome by an irresistible impulse to\r\nthrow my feet. No "blowed-in-the-glass profesh" could possibly pass up\r\nsuch a promising burg. I crossed the river to Quincy in a small\r\ndug-out; but I came back in a large riverboat, down to the gunwales\r\nwith the results of my thrown feet. Of course I kept all the money I\r\nhad collected, though I paid the boat-hire; also I took my pick of the\r\nunderwear, socks, cast-off clothes, shirts, "kicks," and "sky-pieces";\r\nand when Company M had taken all it wanted there was still a\r\nrespectable heap that was turned over to Company L. Alas, I was young\r\nand prodigal in those days! I told a thousand "stories" to the good\r\npeople of Quincy, and every story was "good"; but since I have come to\r\nwrite for the magazines I have often regretted the wealth of story,\r\nthe fecundity of fiction, I lavished that day in Quincy, Illinois.\r\n\r\nIt was at Hannibal, Missouri, that the ten invincibles went to pieces.\r\nIt was not planned. We just naturally flew apart. The Boiler-Maker and\r\nI deserted secretly. On the same day Scotty and Davy made a swift\r\nsneak for the Illinois shore; also McAvoy and Fish achieved their\r\nget-away. This accounts for six of the ten; what became of the\r\nremaining four I do not know. As a sample of life on The Road, I make\r\nthe following quotation from my diary of the several days following my\r\ndesertion.\r\n\r\n"Friday, May 25th. Boiler-Maker and I left the camp on the island. We\r\nwent ashore on the Illinois side in a skiff and walked six miles on\r\nthe C.B. & Q. to Fell Creek. We had gone six miles out of our way, but\r\nwe got on a hand-car and rode six miles to Hull\'s, on the Wabash.\r\nWhile there, we met McAvoy, Fish, Scotty, and Davy, who had also\r\npulled out from the Army.\r\n\r\n"Saturday, May 26th. At 2.11 A.M. we caught the Cannonball as she\r\nslowed up at the crossing. Scotty and Davy were ditched. The four of\r\nus were ditched at the Bluffs, forty miles farther on. In the\r\nafternoon Fish and McAvoy caught a freight while Boiler-Maker and I\r\nwere away getting something to eat.\r\n\r\n"Sunday, May 27th. At 3.21 A.M. we caught the Cannonball and found\r\nScotty and Davy on the blind. We were all ditched at daylight at\r\nJacksonville. The C. & A. runs through here, and we\'re going to take\r\nthat. Boiler-Maker went off, but didn\'t return. Guess he caught a\r\nfreight.\r\n\r\n"Monday, May 28th. Boiler-Maker didn\'t show up. Scotty and Davy went\r\noff to sleep somewhere, and didn\'t get back in time to catch the K.C.\r\npassenger at 3.30 A.M. I caught her and rode her till after sunrise to\r\nMasson City, 25,000 inhabitants. Caught a cattle train and rode all\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n"Tuesday, May 29th. Arrived in Chicago at 7 A.M...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd years afterward, in China, I had the grief of learning that the\r\ndevice we employed to navigate the rapids of the Des Moines--the\r\none-two-one-two, head-boat-tail-boat proposition--was not originated\r\nby us. I learned that the Chinese river-boatmen had for thousands of\r\nyears used a similar device to negotiate "bad water." It is a good\r\nstunt all right, even if we don\'t get the credit. It answers Dr.\r\nJordan\'s test of truth: "Will it work? Will you trust your life to\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBULLS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the tramp were suddenly to pass away from the United States,\r\nwidespread misery for many families would follow. The tramp enables\r\nthousands of men to earn honest livings, educate their children, and\r\nbring them up God-fearing and industrious. I know. At one time my\r\nfather was a constable and hunted tramps for a living. The community\r\npaid him so much per head for all the tramps he could catch, and also,\r\nI believe, he got mileage fees. Ways and means was always a pressing\r\nproblem in our household, and the amount of meat on the table, the new\r\npair of shoes, the day\'s outing, or the text-book for school, were\r\ndependent upon my father\'s luck in the chase. Well I remember the\r\nsuppressed eagerness and the suspense with which I waited to learn\r\neach morning what the results of his past night\'s toil had been--how\r\nmany tramps he had gathered in and what the chances were for\r\nconvicting them. And so it was, when later, as a tramp, I succeeded in\r\neluding some predatory constable, I could not but feel sorry for the\r\nlittle boys and girls at home in that constable\'s house; it seemed to\r\nme in a way that I was defrauding those little boys and girls of some\r\nof the good things of life.\r\n\r\nBut it\'s all in the game. The hobo defies society, and society\'s\r\nwatch-dogs make a living out of him. Some hoboes like to be caught by\r\nthe watch-dogs--especially in winter-time. Of course, such hoboes\r\nselect communities where the jails are "good," wherein no work is\r\nperformed and the food is substantial. Also, there have been, and most\r\nprobably still are, constables who divide their fees with the hoboes\r\nthey arrest. Such a constable does not have to hunt. He whistles, and\r\nthe game comes right up to his hand. It is surprising, the money that\r\nis made out of stone-broke tramps. All through the South--at least\r\nwhen I was hoboing--are convict camps and plantations, where the time\r\nof convicted hoboes is bought by the farmers, and where the hoboes\r\nsimply have to work. Then there are places like the quarries at\r\nRutland, Vermont, where the hobo is exploited, the unearned energy in\r\nhis body, which he has accumulated by "battering on the drag" or\r\n"slamming gates," being extracted for the benefit of that particular\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nNow I don\'t know anything about the quarries at Rutland, Vermont. I\'m\r\nvery glad that I don\'t, when I remember how near I was to getting into\r\nthem. Tramps pass the word along, and I first heard of those quarries\r\nwhen I was in Indiana. But when I got into New England, I heard of\r\nthem continually, and always with danger-signals flying. "They want\r\nmen in the quarries," the passing hoboes said; "and they never give a\r\n\'stiff\' less than ninety days." By the time I got into New Hampshire I\r\nwas pretty well keyed up over those quarries, and I fought shy of\r\nrailroad cops, "bulls," and constables as I never had before.\r\n\r\nOne evening I went down to the railroad yards at Concord and found a\r\nfreight train made up and ready to start. I located an empty box-car,\r\nslid open the side-door, and climbed in. It was my hope to win across\r\nto White River by morning; that would bring me into Vermont and not\r\nmore than a thousand miles from Rutland. But after that, as I worked\r\nnorth, the distance between me and the point of danger would begin to\r\nincrease. In the car I found a "gay-cat," who displayed unusual\r\ntrepidation at my entrance. He took me for a "shack" (brakeman), and\r\nwhen he learned I was only a stiff, he began talking about the\r\nquarries at Rutland as the cause of the fright I had given him. He was\r\na young country fellow, and had beaten his way only over local\r\nstretches of road.\r\n\r\nThe freight got under way, and we lay down in one end of the box-car\r\nand went to sleep. Two or three hours afterward, at a stop, I was\r\nawakened by the noise of the right-hand door being softly slid open.\r\nThe gay-cat slept on. I made no movement, though I veiled my eyes with\r\nmy lashes to a little slit through which I could see out. A lantern\r\nwas thrust in through the doorway, followed by the head of a shack. He\r\ndiscovered us, and looked at us for a moment. I was prepared for a\r\nviolent expression on his part, or the customary "Hit the grit, you\r\nson of a toad!" Instead of this he cautiously withdrew the lantern and\r\nvery, very softly slid the door to. This struck me as eminently\r\nunusual and suspicious. I listened, and softly I heard the hasp drop\r\ninto place. The door was latched on the outside. We could not open it\r\nfrom the inside. One way of sudden exit from that car was blocked. It\r\nwould never do. I waited a few seconds, then crept to the left-hand\r\ndoor and tried it. It was not yet latched. I opened it, dropped to the\r\nground, and closed it behind me. Then I passed across the bumpers to\r\nthe other side of the train. I opened the door the shack had latched,\r\nclimbed in, and closed it behind me. Both exits were available again.\r\nThe gay-cat was still asleep.\r\n\r\nThe train got under way. It came to the next stop. I heard footsteps\r\nin the gravel. Then the left-hand door was thrown open noisily. The\r\ngay-cat awoke, I made believe to awake; and we sat up and stared at\r\nthe shack and his lantern. He didn\'t waste any time getting down to\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n"I want three dollars," he said.\r\n\r\nWe got on our feet and came nearer to him to confer. We expressed an\r\nabsolute and devoted willingness to give him three dollars, but\r\nexplained our wretched luck that compelled our desire to remain\r\nunsatisfied. The shack was incredulous. He dickered with us. He would\r\ncompromise for two dollars. We regretted our condition of poverty. He\r\nsaid uncomplimentary things, called us sons of toads, and damned us\r\nfrom hell to breakfast. Then he threatened. He explained that if we\r\ndidn\'t dig up, he\'d lock us in and carry us on to White River and turn\r\nus over to the authorities. He also explained all about the quarries\r\nat Rutland.\r\n\r\nNow that shack thought he had us dead to rights. Was not he guarding\r\nthe one door, and had he not himself latched the opposite door but a\r\nfew minutes before? When he began talking about quarries, the\r\nfrightened gay-cat started to sidle across to the other door. The\r\nshack laughed loud and long. "Don\'t be in a hurry," he said; "I locked\r\nthat door on the outside at the last stop." So implicitly did he\r\nbelieve the door to be locked that his words carried conviction. The\r\ngay-cat believed and was in despair.\r\n\r\nThe shack delivered his ultimatum. Either we should dig up two\r\ndollars, or he would lock us in and turn us over to the constable at\r\nWhite River--and that meant ninety days and the quarries. Now, gentle\r\nreader, just suppose that the other door had been locked. Behold the\r\nprecariousness of human life. For lack of a dollar, I\'d have gone to\r\nthe quarries and served three months as a convict slave. So would the\r\ngay-cat. Count me out, for I was hopeless; but consider the gay-cat.\r\nHe might have come out, after those ninety days, pledged to a life of\r\ncrime. And later he might have broken your skull, even your skull,\r\nwith a blackjack in an endeavor to take possession of the money on\r\nyour person--and if not your skull, then some other poor and\r\nunoffending creature\'s skull.\r\n\r\nBut the door was unlocked, and I alone knew it. The gay-cat and I\r\nbegged for mercy. I joined in the pleading and wailing out of sheer\r\ncussedness, I suppose. But I did my best. I told a "story" that would\r\nhave melted the heart of any mug; but it didn\'t melt the heart of that\r\nsordid money-grasper of a shack. When he became convinced that we\r\ndidn\'t have any money, he slid the door shut and latched it, then\r\nlingered a moment on the chance that we had fooled him and that we\r\nwould now offer him the two dollars.\r\n\r\nThen it was that I let out a few links. I called him a son of a toad.\r\nI called him all the other things he had called me. And then I called\r\nhim a few additional things. I came from the West, where men knew how\r\nto swear, and I wasn\'t going to let any mangy shack on a measly New\r\nEngland "jerk" put it over me in vividness and vigor of language. At\r\nfirst the shack tried to laugh it down. Then he made the mistake of\r\nattempting to reply. I let out a few more links, and I cut him to the\r\nraw and therein rubbed winged and flaming epithets. Nor was my fine\r\nfrenzy all whim and literary; I was indignant at this vile creature,\r\nwho, in default of a dollar, would consign me to three months of\r\nslavery. Furthermore, I had a sneaking idea that he got a "drag" out\r\nof the constable fees.\r\n\r\nBut I fixed him. I lacerated his feelings and pride several dollars\'\r\nworth. He tried to scare me by threatening to come in after me and\r\nkick the stuffing out of me. In return, I promised to kick him in the\r\nface while he was climbing in. The advantage of position was with me,\r\nand he saw it. So he kept the door shut and called for help from the\r\nrest of the train-crew. I could hear them answering and crunching\r\nthrough the gravel to him. And all the time the other door was\r\nunlatched, and they didn\'t know it; and in the meantime the gay-cat\r\nwas ready to die with fear.\r\n\r\nOh, I was a hero--with my line of retreat straight behind me. I\r\nslanged the shack and his mates till they threw the door open and I\r\ncould see their infuriated faces in the shine of the lanterns. It was\r\nall very simple to them. They had us cornered in the car, and they\r\nwere going to come in and man-handle us. They started. I didn\'t kick\r\nanybody in the face. I jerked the opposite door open, and the gay-cat\r\nand I went out. The train-crew took after us.\r\n\r\nWe went over--if I remember correctly--a stone fence. But I have no\r\ndoubts of recollection about where we found ourselves. In the darkness\r\nI promptly fell over a grave-stone. The gay-cat sprawled over another.\r\nAnd then we got the chase of our lives through that graveyard. The\r\nghosts must have thought we were going some. So did the train-crew,\r\nfor when we emerged from the graveyard and plunged across a road into\r\na dark wood, the shacks gave up the pursuit and went back to their\r\ntrain. A little later that night the gay-cat and I found ourselves at\r\nthe well of a farmhouse. We were after a drink of water, but we\r\nnoticed a small rope that ran down one side of the well. We hauled it\r\nup and found on the end of it a gallon-can of cream. And that is as\r\nnear as I got to the quarries of Rutland, Vermont.\r\n\r\nWhen hoboes pass the word along, concerning a town, that "the bulls is\r\nhorstile," avoid that town, or, if you must, go through softly. There\r\nare some towns that one must always go through softly. Such a town was\r\nCheyenne, on the Union Pacific. It had a national reputation for being\r\n"horstile,"--and it was all due to the efforts of one Jeff Carr (if I\r\nremember his name aright). Jeff Carr could size up the "front" of a\r\nhobo on the instant. He never entered into discussion. In the one\r\nmoment he sized up the hobo, and in the next he struck out with both\r\nfists, a club, or anything else he had handy. After he had man-handled\r\nthe hobo, he started him out of town with a promise of worse if he\r\never saw him again. Jeff Carr knew the game. North, south, east, and\r\nwest to the uttermost confines of the United States (Canada and Mexico\r\nincluded), the man-handled hoboes carried the word that Cheyenne was\r\n"horstile." Fortunately, I never encountered Jeff Carr. I passed\r\nthrough Cheyenne in a blizzard. There were eighty-four hoboes with me\r\nat the time. The strength of numbers made us pretty nonchalant on\r\nmost things, but not on Jeff Carr. The connotation of "Jeff Carr"\r\nstunned our imagination, numbed our virility, and the whole gang was\r\nmortally scared of meeting him.\r\n\r\nIt rarely pays to stop and enter into explanations with bulls when\r\nthey look "horstile." A swift get-away is the thing to do. It took me\r\nsome time to learn this; but the finishing touch was put upon me by a\r\nbull in New York City. Ever since that time it has been an automatic\r\nprocess with me to make a run for it when I see a bull reaching for\r\nme. This automatic process has become a mainspring of conduct in me,\r\nwound up and ready for instant release. I shall never get over it.\r\nShould I be eighty years old, hobbling along the street on crutches,\r\nand should a policeman suddenly reach out for me, I know I\'d drop the\r\ncrutches and run like a deer.\r\n\r\nThe finishing touch to my education in bulls was received on a hot\r\nsummer afternoon in New York City. It was during a week of scorching\r\nweather. I had got into the habit of throwing my feet in the morning,\r\nand of spending the afternoon in the little park that is hard by\r\nNewspaper Row and the City Hall. It was near there that I could buy\r\nfrom pushcart men current books (that had been injured in the making\r\nor binding) for a few cents each. Then, right in the park itself, were\r\nlittle booths where one could buy glorious, ice-cold, sterilized milk\r\nand buttermilk at a penny a glass. Every afternoon I sat on a bench\r\nand read, and went on a milk debauch. I got away with from five to ten\r\nglasses each afternoon. It was dreadfully hot weather.\r\n\r\nSo here I was, a meek and studious milk-drinking hobo, and behold what\r\nI got for it. One afternoon I arrived at the park, a fresh\r\nbook-purchase under my arm and a tremendous buttermilk thirst under my\r\nshirt. In the middle of the street, in front of the City Hall, I\r\nnoticed, as I came along heading for the buttermilk booth, that a\r\ncrowd had formed. It was right where I was crossing the street, so I\r\nstopped to see the cause of the collection of curious men. At first I\r\ncould see nothing. Then, from the sounds I heard and from a glimpse I\r\ncaught, I knew that it was a bunch of gamins playing pee-wee. Now\r\npee-wee is not permitted in the streets of New York. I didn\'t know\r\nthat, but I learned pretty lively. I had paused possibly thirty\r\nseconds, in which time I had learned the cause of the crowd, when I\r\nheard a gamin yell "Bull!" The gamins knew their business. They ran. I\r\ndidn\'t.\r\n\r\nThe crowd broke up immediately and started for the sidewalk on both\r\nsides of the street. I started for the sidewalk on the park-side.\r\nThere must have been fifty men, who had been in the original crowd,\r\nwho were heading in the same direction. We were loosely strung out. I\r\nnoticed the bull, a strapping policeman in a gray suit. He was coming\r\nalong the middle of the street, without haste, merely sauntering. I\r\nnoticed casually that he changed his course, and was heading obliquely\r\nfor the same sidewalk that I was heading for directly. He sauntered\r\nalong, threading the strung-out crowd, and I noticed that his course\r\nand mine would cross each other. I was so innocent of wrong-doing\r\nthat, in spite of my education in bulls and their ways, I apprehended\r\nnothing. I never dreamed that bull was after me. Out of my respect for\r\nthe law I was actually all ready to pause the next moment and let him\r\ncross in front of me. The pause came all right, but it was not of my\r\nvolition; also it was a backward pause. Without warning, that bull had\r\nsuddenly launched out at me on the chest with both hands. At the same\r\nmoment, verbally, he cast the bar sinister on my genealogy.\r\n\r\nAll my free American blood boiled. All my liberty-loving ancestors\r\nclamored in me. "What do you mean?" I demanded. You see, I wanted an\r\nexplanation. And I got it. Bang! His club came down on top of my head,\r\nand I was reeling backward like a drunken man, the curious faces of\r\nthe onlookers billowing up and down like the waves of the sea, my\r\nprecious book falling from under my arm into the dirt, the bull\r\nadvancing with the club ready for another blow. And in that dizzy\r\nmoment I had a vision. I saw that club descending many times upon my\r\nhead; I saw myself, bloody and battered and hard-looking, in a\r\npolice-court; I heard a charge of disorderly conduct, profane\r\nlanguage, resisting an officer, and a few other things, read by a\r\nclerk; and I saw myself across in Blackwell\'s Island. Oh, I knew the\r\ngame. I lost all interest in explanations. I didn\'t stop to pick up my\r\nprecious, unread book. I turned and ran. I was pretty sick, but I\r\nran. And run I shall, to my dying day, whenever a bull begins to\r\nexplain with a club.\r\n\r\nWhy, years after my tramping days, when I was a student in the\r\nUniversity of California, one night I went to the circus. After the\r\nshow and the concert I lingered on to watch the working of the\r\ntransportation machinery of a great circus. The circus was leaving\r\nthat night. By a bonfire I came upon a bunch of small boys. There were\r\nabout twenty of them, and as they talked with one another I learned\r\nthat they were going to run away with the circus. Now the circus-men\r\ndidn\'t want to be bothered with this mess of urchins, and a telephone\r\nto police headquarters had "coppered" the play. A squad of ten\r\npolicemen had been despatched to the scene to arrest the small boys\r\nfor violating the nine o\'clock curfew ordinance. The policemen\r\nsurrounded the bonfire, and crept up close to it in the darkness. At\r\nthe signal, they made a rush, each policeman grabbing at the\r\nyoungsters as he would grab into a basket of squirming eels.\r\n\r\nNow I didn\'t know anything about the coming of the police; and when I\r\nsaw the sudden eruption of brass-buttoned, helmeted bulls, each of\r\nthem reaching with both hands, all the forces and stability of my\r\nbeing were overthrown. Remained only the automatic process to run. And\r\nI ran. I didn\'t know I was running. I didn\'t know anything. It was, as\r\nI have said, automatic. There was no reason for me to run. I was not a\r\nhobo. I was a citizen of that community. It was my home town. I was\r\nguilty of no wrong-doing. I was a college man. I had even got my name\r\nin the papers, and I wore good clothes that had never been slept in.\r\nAnd yet I ran--blindly, madly, like a startled deer, for over a block.\r\nAnd when I came to myself, I noted that I was still running. It\r\nrequired a positive effort of will to stop those legs of mine.\r\n\r\nNo, I\'ll never get over it. I can\'t help it. When a bull reaches, I\r\nrun. Besides, I have an unhappy faculty for getting into jail. I have\r\nbeen in jail more times since I was a hobo than when I was one. I\r\nstart out on a Sunday morning with a young lady on a bicycle ride.\r\nBefore we can get outside the city limits we are arrested for passing\r\na pedestrian on the sidewalk. I resolve to be more careful. The next\r\ntime I am on a bicycle it is night-time and my acetylene-gas-lamp is\r\nmisbehaving. I cherish the sickly flame carefully, because of the\r\nordinance. I am in a hurry, but I ride at a snail\'s pace so as not to\r\njar out the flickering flame. I reach the city limits; I am beyond the\r\njurisdiction of the ordinance; and I proceed to scorch to make up for\r\nlost time. And half a mile farther on I am "pinched" by a bull, and\r\nthe next morning I forfeit my bail in the police court. The city had\r\ntreacherously extended its limits into a mile of the country, and I\r\ndidn\'t know, that was all. I remember my inalienable right of free\r\nspeech and peaceable assemblage, and I get up on a soap-box to trot\r\nout the particular economic bees that buzz in my bonnet, and a bull\r\ntakes me off that box and leads me to the city prison, and after that\r\nI get out on bail. It\'s no use. In Korea I used to be arrested about\r\nevery other day. It was the same thing in Manchuria. The last time I\r\nwas in Japan I broke into jail under the pretext of being a Russian\r\nspy. It wasn\'t my pretext, but it got me into jail just the same.\r\nThere is no hope for me. I am fated to do the Prisoner-of-Chillon\r\nstunt yet. This is prophecy.\r\n\r\nI once hypnotized a bull on Boston Common. It was past midnight and he\r\nhad me dead to rights; but before I got done with him he had ponied up\r\na silver quarter and given me the address of an all-night restaurant.\r\nThen there was a bull in Bristol, New Jersey, who caught me and let me\r\ngo, and heaven knows he had provocation enough to put me in jail. I\r\nhit him the hardest I\'ll wager he was ever hit in his life. It\r\nhappened this way. About midnight I nailed a freight out of\r\nPhiladelphia. The shacks ditched me. She was pulling out slowly\r\nthrough the maze of tracks and switches of the freight-yards. I nailed\r\nher again, and again I was ditched. You see, I had to nail her\r\n"outside," for she was a through freight with every door locked and\r\nsealed.\r\n\r\nThe second time I was ditched the shack gave me a lecture. He told me\r\nI was risking my life, that it was a fast freight and that she went\r\nsome. I told him I was used to going some myself, but it was no go. He\r\nsaid he wouldn\'t permit me to commit suicide, and I hit the grit. But\r\nI nailed her a third time, getting in between on the bumpers. They\r\nwere the most meagre bumpers I had ever seen--I do not refer to the\r\nreal bumpers, the iron bumpers that are connected by the\r\ncoupling-link and that pound and grind on each other; what I refer to\r\nare the beams, like huge cleats, that cross the ends of freight cars\r\njust above the bumpers. When one rides the bumpers, he stands on these\r\ncleats, one foot on each, the bumpers between his feet and just\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nBut the beams or cleats I found myself on were not the broad, generous\r\nones that at that time were usually on box-cars. On the contrary, they\r\nwere very narrow--not more than an inch and a half in breadth. I\r\ncouldn\'t get half of the width of my sole on them. Then there was\r\nnothing to which to hold with my hands. True, there were the ends of\r\nthe two box-cars; but those ends were flat, perpendicular surfaces.\r\nThere were no grips. I could only press the flats of my palms against\r\nthe car-ends for support. But that would have been all right if the\r\ncleats for my feet had been decently wide.\r\n\r\nAs the freight got out of Philadelphia she began to hit up speed. Then\r\nI understood what the shack had meant by suicide. The freight went\r\nfaster and faster. She was a through freight, and there was nothing to\r\nstop her. On that section of the Pennsylvania four tracks run side by\r\nside, and my east-bound freight didn\'t need to worry about passing\r\nwest-bound freights, nor about being overtaken by east-bound\r\nexpresses. She had the track to herself, and she used it. I was in a\r\nprecarious situation. I stood with the mere edges of my feet on the\r\nnarrow projections, the palms of my hands pressing desperately against\r\nthe flat, perpendicular ends of each car. And those cars moved, and\r\nmoved individually, up and down and back and forth. Did you ever see a\r\ncircus rider, standing on two running horses, with one foot on the\r\nback of each horse? Well, that was what I was doing, with several\r\ndifferences. The circus rider had the reins to hold on to, while I had\r\nnothing; he stood on the broad soles of his feet, while I stood on the\r\nedges of mine; he bent his legs and body, gaining the strength of the\r\narch in his posture and achieving the stability of a low centre of\r\ngravity, while I was compelled to stand upright and keep my legs\r\nstraight; he rode face forward, while I was riding sidewise; and also,\r\nif he fell off, he\'d get only a roll in the sawdust, while I\'d have\r\nbeen ground to pieces beneath the wheels.\r\n\r\nAnd that freight was certainly going some, roaring and shrieking,\r\nswinging madly around curves, thundering over trestles, one car-end\r\nbumping up when the other was jarring down, or jerking to the right at\r\nthe same moment the other was lurching to the left, and with me all\r\nthe while praying and hoping for the train to stop. But she didn\'t\r\nstop. She didn\'t have to. For the first, last, and only time on The\r\nRoad, I got all I wanted. I abandoned the bumpers and managed to get\r\nout on a side-ladder; it was ticklish work, for I had never\r\nencountered car-ends that were so parsimonious of hand-holds and\r\nfoot-holds as those car-ends were.\r\n\r\nI heard the engine whistling, and I felt the speed easing down. I knew\r\nthe train wasn\'t going to stop, but my mind was made up to chance it\r\nif she slowed down sufficiently. The right of way at this point took a\r\ncurve, crossed a bridge over a canal, and cut through the town of\r\nBristol. This combination compelled slow speed. I clung on to the\r\nside-ladder and waited. I didn\'t know it was the town of Bristol we\r\nwere approaching. I did not know what necessitated slackening in\r\nspeed. All I knew was that I wanted to get off. I strained my eyes in\r\nthe darkness for a street-crossing on which to land. I was pretty well\r\ndown the train, and before my car was in the town the engine was past\r\nthe station and I could feel her making speed again.\r\n\r\nThen came the street. It was too dark to see how wide it was or what\r\nwas on the other side. I knew I needed all of that street if I was to\r\nremain on my feet after I struck. I dropped off on the near side. It\r\nsounds easy. By "dropped off" I mean just this: I first of all, on the\r\nside-ladder, thrust my body forward as far as I could in the direction\r\nthe train was going--this to give as much space as possible in which\r\nto gain backward momentum when I swung off. Then I swung, swung out\r\nand backward, backward with all my might, and let go--at the same time\r\nthrowing myself backward as if I intended to strike the ground on the\r\nback of my head. The whole effort was to overcome as much as possible\r\nthe primary forward momentum the train had imparted to my body. When\r\nmy feet hit the grit, my body was lying backward on the air at an\r\nangle of forty-five degrees. I had reduced the forward momentum some,\r\nfor when my feet struck, I did not immediately pitch forward on my\r\nface. Instead, my body rose to the perpendicular and began to incline\r\nforward. In point of fact, my body proper still retained much\r\nmomentum, while my feet, through contact with the earth, had lost all\r\ntheir momentum. This momentum the feet had lost I had to supply anew\r\nby lifting them as rapidly as I could and running them forward in\r\norder to keep them under my forward-moving body. The result was that\r\nmy feet beat a rapid and explosive tattoo clear across the street. I\r\ndidn\'t dare stop them. If I had, I\'d have pitched forward. It was up\r\nto me to keep on going.\r\n\r\nI was an involuntary projectile, worrying about what was on the other\r\nside of the street and hoping that it wouldn\'t be a stone wall or a\r\ntelegraph pole. And just then I hit something. Horrors! I saw it just\r\nthe instant before the disaster--of all things, a bull, standing there\r\nin the darkness. We went down together, rolling over and over; and the\r\nautomatic process was such in that miserable creature that in the\r\nmoment of impact he reached out and clutched me and never let go. We\r\nwere both knocked out, and he held on to a very lamb-like hobo while\r\nhe recovered.\r\n\r\nIf that bull had any imagination, he must have thought me a traveller\r\nfrom other worlds, the man from Mars just arriving; for in the\r\ndarkness he hadn\'t seen me swing from the train. In fact, his first\r\nwords were: "Where did you come from?" His next words, and before I\r\nhad time to answer, were: "I\'ve a good mind to run you in." This\r\nlatter, I am convinced, was likewise automatic. He was a really good\r\nbull at heart, for after I had told him a "story" and helped brush off\r\nhis clothes, he gave me until the next freight to get out of town. I\r\nstipulated two things: first, that the freight be east-bound, and\r\nsecond, that it should not be a through freight with all doors sealed\r\nand locked. To this he agreed, and thus, by the terms of the Treaty of\r\nBristol, I escaped being pinched.\r\n\r\nI remember another night, in that part of the country, when I just\r\nmissed another bull. If I had hit him, I\'d have telescoped him, for I\r\nwas coming down from above, all holds free, with several other bulls\r\none jump behind and reaching for me. This is how it happened. I had\r\nbeen lodging in a livery stable in Washington. I had a box-stall and\r\nunnumbered horse-blankets all to myself. In return for such sumptuous\r\naccommodation I took care of a string of horses each morning. I might\r\nhave been there yet, if it hadn\'t been for the bulls.\r\n\r\nOne evening, about nine o\'clock, I returned to the stable to go to\r\nbed, and found a crap game in full blast. It had been a market day,\r\nand all the negroes had money. It would be well to explain the lay of\r\nthe land. The livery stable faced on two streets. I entered the front,\r\npassed through the office, and came to the alley between two rows of\r\nstalls that ran the length of the building and opened out on the other\r\nstreet. Midway along this alley, beneath a gas-jet and between the\r\nrows of horses, were about forty negroes. I joined them as an\r\nonlooker. I was broke and couldn\'t play. A coon was making passes and\r\nnot dragging down. He was riding his luck, and with each pass the\r\ntotal stake doubled. All kinds of money lay on the floor. It was\r\nfascinating. With each pass, the chances increased tremendously\r\nagainst the coon making another pass. The excitement was intense. And\r\njust then there came a thundering smash on the big doors that opened\r\non the back street.\r\n\r\nA few of the negroes bolted in the opposite direction. I paused from\r\nmy flight a moment to grab at the all kinds of money on the floor.\r\nThis wasn\'t theft: it was merely custom. Every man who hadn\'t run was\r\ngrabbing. The doors crashed open and swung in, and through them surged\r\na squad of bulls. We surged the other way. It was dark in the office,\r\nand the narrow door would not permit all of us to pass out to the\r\nstreet at the same time. Things became congested. A coon took a dive\r\nthrough the window, taking the sash along with him and followed by\r\nother coons. At our rear, the bulls were nailing prisoners. A big coon\r\nand myself made a dash at the door at the same time. He was bigger\r\nthan I, and he pivoted me and got through first. The next instant a\r\nclub swatted him on the head and he went down like a steer. Another\r\nsquad of bulls was waiting outside for us. They knew they couldn\'t\r\nstop the rush with their hands, and so they were swinging their clubs.\r\nI stumbled over the fallen coon who had pivoted me, ducked a swat from\r\na club, dived between a bull\'s legs, and was free. And then how I ran!\r\nThere was a lean mulatto just in front of me, and I took his pace. He\r\nknew the town better than I did, and I knew that in the way he ran lay\r\nsafety. But he, on the other hand, took me for a pursuing bull. He\r\nnever looked around. He just ran. My wind was good, and I hung on to\r\nhis pace and nearly killed him. In the end he stumbled weakly, went\r\ndown on his knees, and surrendered to me. And when he discovered I\r\nwasn\'t a bull, all that saved me was that he didn\'t have any wind left\r\nin him.\r\n\r\nThat was why I left Washington--not on account of the mulatto, but on\r\naccount of the bulls. I went down to the depot and caught the first\r\nblind out on a Pennsylvania Railroad express. After the train got good\r\nand under way and I noted the speed she was making, a misgiving smote\r\nme. This was a four-track railroad, and the engines took water on the\r\nfly. Hoboes had long since warned me never to ride the first blind on\r\ntrains where the engines took water on the fly. And now let me\r\nexplain. Between the tracks are shallow metal troughs. As the engine,\r\nat full speed, passes above, a sort of chute drops down into the\r\ntrough. The result is that all the water in the trough rushes up the\r\nchute and fills the tender.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along between Washington and Baltimore, as I sat on the\r\nplatform of the blind, a fine spray began to fill the air. It did no\r\nharm. Ah, ha, thought I; it\'s all a bluff, this taking water on the\r\nfly being bad for the bo on the first blind. What does this little\r\nspray amount to? Then I began to marvel at the device. This was\r\nrailroading! Talk about your primitive Western railroading--and just\r\nthen the tender filled up, and it hadn\'t reached the end of the\r\ntrough. A tidal wave of water poured over the back of the tender and\r\ndown upon me. I was soaked to the skin, as wet as if I had fallen\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\nThe train pulled into Baltimore. As is the custom in the great Eastern\r\ncities, the railroad ran beneath the level of the streets on the\r\nbottom of a big "cut." As the train pulled into the lighted depot, I\r\nmade myself as small as possible on the blind. But a railroad bull saw\r\nme, and gave chase. Two more joined him. I was past the depot, and I\r\nran straight on down the track. I was in a sort of trap. On each side\r\nof me rose the steep walls of the cut, and if I ever essayed them and\r\nfailed, I knew that I\'d slide back into the clutches of the bulls. I\r\nran on and on, studying the walls of the cut for a favorable place to\r\nclimb up. At last I saw such a place. It came just after I had passed\r\nunder a bridge that carried a level street across the cut. Up the\r\nsteep slope I went, clawing hand and foot. The three railroad bulls\r\nwere clawing up right after me.\r\n\r\nAt the top, I found myself in a vacant lot. On one side was a low wall\r\nthat separated it from the street. There was no time for minute\r\ninvestigation. They were at my heels. I headed for the wall and\r\nvaulted it. And right there was where I got the surprise of my life.\r\nOne is used to thinking that one side of a wall is just as high as the\r\nother side. But that wall was different. You see, the vacant lot was\r\nmuch higher than the level of the street. On my side the wall was low,\r\nbut on the other side--well, as I came soaring over the top, all holds\r\nfree, it seemed to me that I was falling feet-first, plump into an\r\nabyss. There beneath me, on the sidewalk, under the light of a\r\nstreet-lamp was a bull. I guess it was nine or ten feet down to the\r\nsidewalk; but in the shock of surprise in mid-air it seemed twice that\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nI straightened out in the air and came down. At first I thought I was\r\ngoing to land on the bull. My clothes did brush him as my feet struck\r\nthe sidewalk with explosive impact. It was a wonder he didn\'t drop\r\ndead, for he hadn\'t heard me coming. It was the man-from-Mars stunt\r\nover again. The bull did jump. He shied away from me like a horse from\r\nan auto; and then he reached for me. I didn\'t stop to explain. I left\r\nthat to my pursuers, who were dropping over the wall rather gingerly.\r\nBut I got a chase all right. I ran up one street and down another,\r\ndodged around corners, and at last got away.\r\n\r\nAfter spending some of the coin I\'d got from the crap game and killing\r\noff an hour of time, I came back to the railroad cut, just outside the\r\nlights of the depot, and waited for a train. My blood had cooled down,\r\nand I shivered miserably, what of my wet clothes. At last a train\r\npulled into the station. I lay low in the darkness, and successfully\r\nboarded her when she pulled out, taking good care this time to make\r\nthe second blind. No more water on the fly in mine. The train ran\r\nforty miles to the first stop. I got off in a lighted depot that was\r\nstrangely familiar. I was back in Washington. In some way, during the\r\nexcitement of the get-away in Baltimore, running through strange\r\nstreets, dodging and turning and retracing, I had got turned around. I\r\nhad taken the train out the wrong way. I had lost a night\'s sleep, I\r\nhad been soaked to the skin, I had been chased for my life; and for\r\nall my pains I was back where I had started. Oh, no, life on The Road\r\nis not all beer and skittles. But I didn\'t go back to the livery\r\nstable. I had done some pretty successful grabbing, and I didn\'t want\r\nto reckon up with the coons. So I caught the next train out, and ate\r\nmy breakfast in Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ROAD***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 14658.txt or 14658.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/4/6/5/14658\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
