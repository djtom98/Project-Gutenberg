M. BARRIE\r\n\r\nNEW YORK\r\nGEORGE H. DORAN COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Copyright_, 1919,\r\n_By George H. Doran Company_\r\n\r\n_Printed in the United States of America_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg v]\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe "owner of the copyright" guarantees that "The Young Visiters" is\r\nthe unaided effort in fiction of an authoress of nine years. "Effort,"\r\nhowever, is an absurd word to use, as you may see by studying the\r\ntriumphant countenance of the child herself, which is here reproduced\r\nas frontispiece to her sublime work. This is no portrait of a writer\r\nwho had to burn the oil at midnight (indeed there is documentary\r\nevidence that she was hauled off to bed every evening at six): it has\r\nan air of careless power; there is a complacency about it that by the\r\nsevere might perhaps be called smugness. It needed no effort for that\r\nface to knock off a masterpiece. It probably represents precisely how\r\nshe looked when she finished a chapter. When she was actually at work\r\nI think the expression [Pg vi] was more solemn, with the tongue firmly\r\nclenched between the teeth; an unholy rapture showing as she drew near\r\nher love chapter. Fellow-craftsmen will see that she is looking\r\nforward to this chapter all the time.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript is in pencil in a stout little note book (twopence),\r\nand there it has lain for years, for though the authoress was nine\r\nwhen she wrote it she is now a grown woman. It has lain, in lavender\r\nas it were, in the dumpy note book, waiting for a publisher to ride\r\nthat way and rescue it; and here he is at last, not a bit afraid that\r\nto this age it may appear "Victorian." Indeed if its pictures of High\r\nLife are accurate (as we cannot doubt, the authoress seems always so\r\nsure of her facts) they had a way of going on in those times which is\r\nreally surprising. Even the grand historical figures were free and\r\neasy, such as King Edward, of whom we have perhaps the most human\r\npicture ever penned, as he appears at a lev\xe9e "rather sumshiously," in\r\na "small [Pg vii] but costly crown," and afterwards slips away to tuck\r\ninto ices. It would seem in particular that we are oddly wrong in our\r\nidea of the young Victorian lady as a person more shy and shrinking than\r\nthe girl of to-day. The Ethel of this story is a fascinating creature\r\nwho would have a good time wherever there were a few males, but no\r\nlonger could she voyage through life quite so jollily without\r\nattracting the attention of the censorious. Chaperon seems to be one\r\nof the very few good words of which our authoress had never heard.\r\n\r\nThe lady she had grown into, the "owner of the copyright" already\r\nreferred to, gives me a few particulars of this child she used to be,\r\nand is evidently a little scared by her. We should probably all be a\r\nlittle scared (though proud) if that portrait was dumped down in front\r\nof us as ours, and we were asked to explain why we once thought so\r\nmuch of ourselves as that.\r\n\r\nExcept for the smirk on her face, all I can learn of her now is that\r\nshe was one of [Pg viii] a small family who lived in the country, invented\r\ntheir own games, dodged the governess and let the rest of the world go\r\nhang. She read everything that came her way, including, as the context\r\namply proves, the grown-up novels of the period. "I adored writing and\r\nused to pray for bad weather, so that I need not go out but could stay\r\nin and write." Her mother used to have early tea in bed; sometimes\r\nvisitors came to the house, when there was talk of events in high\r\nsociety: there was mention of places called Hampton Court, the Gaiety\r\nTheatre and the "Crystale" Palace. This is almost all that is now\r\nremembered, but it was enough for the blazing child. She sucked her\r\nthumb for a moment (this is guesswork), and sat down to her amazing\r\ntale.\r\n\r\n"Her mother used to have early tea in bed." Many authors must have had\r\na similar experience, but they all missed the possibilities of it\r\nuntil this young woman came along. It thrilled her; and tea in [Pg ix]\r\nbed at last takes its proper place in fiction. "Mr Salteena woke\r\nup rarther early next day and was delighted to find Horace the footman\r\nentering with a cup of tea. Oh thank you my man said Mr Salteena\r\nrolling over in the costly bed. Mr Clark is nearly out of the bath sir\r\nannounced Horace I will have great pleasure in turning it on for you\r\nif such is your desire. Well yes you might said Mr Salteena seeing it\r\nwas the idear." Mr Salteena cleverly conceals his emotion, but as soon\r\nas he is alone he rushes to Ethel\'s door, "I say said Mr Salteena\r\nexcitedly I have had some tea in bed."\r\n\r\n"Sometimes visitors came to the house." Nothing much in that to us,\r\nbut how consummately this child must have studied them; if you\r\nconsider what she knew of them before the "viacle" arrived to take\r\nthem back to the station you will never dare to spend another week-end\r\nin a house where there may be a novelist of nine years. I am sure that\r\nwhen you left your bedroom this child stole in, examined everything\r\n[Pg x] and summed you up. She was particularly curious about the articles\r\non your dressing-table, including the little box containing a reddish\r\npowder, and she never desisted from watching you till she caught you\r\ndabbing it on your cheeks. This powder, which she spells "ruge," went\r\na little to her head, and it accompanies Ethel on her travels with\r\nsuperb effect. For instance, she is careful to put it on to be\r\nproposed to; and again its first appearance is excused in words that\r\nshould henceforth be serviceable in every boudoir. "I shall put some\r\nred ruge on my face said Ethel becouse I am very pale owing to the\r\ndrains in this house."\r\n\r\nThose who read will see how the rooms in Hampton Court became the\r\n"compartments" in the "Crystale" Palace, and how the "Gaierty" Hotel\r\ngrew out of the Gaiety Theatre, with many other agreeable changes. The\r\nnovelist will find the tale a model for his future work. How\r\nincomparably, for instance, the authoress dives [Pg xi] into her story\r\nat once. How cunningly throughout she keeps us on the hooks of suspense,\r\njumping to Mr Salteena when we are in a quiver about Ethel, and\r\nturning to Ethel when we are quite uneasy about Mr Salteena. This\r\nauthoress of nine is flirting with her readers all the time. Her mind\r\nis such a rich pocket that as she digs in it (her head to the side and\r\nher tongue well out) she sends up showers of nuggets. There seldom\r\nprobably was a novelist with such an uncanny knowledge of his\r\ncharacters as she has of Mr Salteena. The first line of the tale\r\netches him for all time: "Mr Salteena was an elderly man of 42 and\r\nfond of asking people to stay with him." On the next page Salteena\r\ndraws a touching picture of himself in a letter accepting an\r\ninvitation: "I do hope I shall enjoy myself with you. I am fond of\r\ndigging in the garden and I am parshal to ladies if they are nice I\r\nsuppose it is my nature. I am not quite a gentleman but you would\r\nhardly notice it but can\'t be helped anyhow." [Pg xii] "When the great\r\nmorning arrived Mr Salteena did not have an egg for his breakfast in\r\ncase he should be sick on the journey." For my part I love Mr Salteena,\r\nwho has a touch of Hamlet, and I wished up to the end that Ethel would\r\nmake him happy, though I never had much hope after I read the\r\ndescription of Bernard Clark\'s legs.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that Mr Salteena soon grew "rarther\r\njellous" of Bernard, who showed off from the first. "My own room is\r\nnext the bathroom said Bernard it is decerated dark red as I have\r\nsomber tastes. The bathroom has got a tip up basin." Thus was Mr\r\nSalteena put in his place, and there the cruel authoress (with her\r\ntongue farther out than ever) doggedly keeps him. "After dinner Ethel\r\nplayed some merry tunes on the piano and Bernard responded with a\r\nrarther loud song in a base voice and Ethel clapped him a good deal.\r\nThen Mr Salteena asked a few riddles as he was not musicle." No wonder\r\nMr Salteena went gloomily to bed, not to [Pg xiii] sleep, but to think\r\nout the greater riddle of how to become a gentleman, with which\r\ntriumphant adventure the book is largely concerned.\r\n\r\nTo many the most instructive part of the story will be the chapter\r\nentitled "Bernard\'s Idear." Bernard\'s "idear" (warmly acclaimed by\r\nEthel) is that she and he should go up to London "for a few weeks\r\ngaierty." Something of the kind has often been done in fiction and in\r\nguide-books, but never probably in such a hearty way as here. Arrived\r\nat the "Gaierty" Hotel Bernard pokes his head into the "window of the\r\npay desk. Have you a couple of bedrooms for self and young lady he\r\nenquired in a lordly way." He is told that they have two beauties.\r\n"Thank you said Bernard we will go up if you have no objection. None\r\nwhatever sir said the genial lady the beds are well aired and the view\r\nquite pleasant. Come along Ethel cried Bernard this sounds alright eh.\r\nOh quite said Ethel with a beaming smile." He decides gallantly [Pg xiv]\r\nthat the larger room shall be hers. "I shall be quite lost in that\r\nlarge bed," Ethel says. "Yes I expect you will said Bernard and now\r\nwhat about a little table d\'ote followed by a theatre?"\r\n\r\nBernard\'s proposal should be carried in the pocket of all future\r\nswains. He decides "whilst imbibing his morning tea beneath the pink\r\nsilken quilt," that to propose in London would not be the "correct\r\nidear." He springs out of bed and knocks at Ethel\'s door. "Are you up\r\nmy dear? he called. Well not quite said Ethel hastily jumping from her\r\ndowny nest." He explains his "idear." "Oh hurrah shouted Ethel I shall\r\nsoon be ready as I had my bath last night so won\'t wash very much\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nThey go up the river in a boat, and after they had eaten and "drunk\r\ndeeply of the charming viands ending up with merangs and chocklates,"\r\nBernard says "in a passionate voice Let us now bask under the\r\nspreading trees. Oh yes lets said Ethel." "Ethel he murmered in a\r\ntrembly voice. [Pg xv] Oh what is it said Ethel." What it was (as well\r\nshe knew) was love eternal. Ethel accepts him, faints and is brought back\r\nto life by a clever "idear" of Bernard\'s, who pours water on her. "She\r\nsoon came to and looked up with a sickly smile. Take me back to the\r\n\'Gaierty\' Hotel she whispered faintly. With pleasure my darling said\r\nBernard I will just pack up our viands ere I unloose the boat. Ethel\r\nfelt better after a few drops of champaigne and began to tidy her hair\r\nwhile Bernard packed the remains of the food. Then arm in arm they\r\ntottered to the boat, I trust you have not got an illness my darling\r\nmurmured Bernard as he helped her in, Oh no I am very strong said\r\nEthel I fainted from joy she added to explain matters. Oh I see said\r\nBernard handing her a cushion well some people do he added kindly."\r\n\r\n"So I will end my chapter," the authoress says; and we can picture her\r\ndoing it complacently, and slowly pulling in her tongue.\r\n\r\nEthel was married in the Abbey. Her [Pg xvi] wedding dress was "a rich\r\nsatin with a humped pattern of gold on the pure white and it had a long\r\ntrain edged with Airum lillies." "You will indeed be a charming\r\nspectacle my darling gasped Bernard as they left the shop," and I have\r\nno doubt she was. She got many delightful presents, the nicest of all\r\nbeing from her father, who "provided a cheque for \xa32 and promised to\r\nsend her a darling little baby calf when ready." This is perhaps the\r\nprettiest touch in the story and should make us all take off our hats\r\nto the innocent wondering mind that thought of it.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr Salteena. He was at the wedding, dressed in black and crying\r\ninto his handkerchief. However he recovered to an extent and married\r\nAnother and had ten children, "five of each," none of them of course\r\nequal to Ethel\'s children, of whom in a remarkably short time there\r\nwere seven, which the authoress evidently considers to be the right\r\n"idear."\r\n\r\nIt seems to me to be a remarkable work [Pg xviii] for a child, remarkable\r\neven in its length and completeness, for when children turn author they\r\nusually stop in the middle, like the kitten when it jumps. The\r\npencilled MS. has been accurately reproduced, not a word added or cut\r\nout. Each chapter being in one long paragraph, however, this has been\r\nsubdivided for the reader\'s comfort.\r\n                                              J. M.

He had quite a young girl staying with him of 17 named\r\nEthel Monticue. Mr Salteena had dark short hair and mustache and\r\nwiskers which were very black and twisty. He was middle sized and he\r\nhad very pale blue eyes. He had a pale brown suit but on Sundays he\r\nhad a black one and he had a topper every day as he thorght it more\r\nbecoming. Ethel Monticue had fair hair done on the top and blue eyes.\r\nShe had a blue velvit frock which had grown rarther short in the\r\nsleeves. She had a black straw hat and kid gloves.\r\n\r\n[Pg 24]\r\nOne morning Mr Salteena came down to brekfast and found Ethel had come\r\ndown first which was strange. Is the tea made Ethel he said rubbing\r\nhis hands. Yes said Ethel and such a quear shaped parcel has come for\r\nyou Yes indeed it was a quear shape parcel it was a hat box tied down\r\nvery tight and a letter stuffed between the string. Well well said Mr\r\nSalteena parcels do turn quear I will read the letter first and so\r\nsaying he tore open the letter and this is what it said\r\n\r\n     My dear Alfred.\r\n\r\n     I want you to come for a stop with me so I have sent you a top hat\r\n     wraped up in tishu paper inside the box. Will you wear it staying\r\n     with me because it is very uncommon. Please bring one of your young\r\n     ladies whichever is the prettiest in the face.\r\n\r\n                                 I remain Yours truely\r\n                                        Bernard Clark.\r\n\r\n[Pg 25]\r\nWell said Mr Salteena I shall take you to stay Ethel and fancy him\r\nsending me a top hat. Then Mr S. opened the box and there lay the most\r\nsplendid top hat of a lovly rich tone rarther like grapes with a\r\nribbon round compleat.\r\n\r\nWell said Mr Salteena peevishly I dont know if I shall like it the bow\r\nof the ribbon is too flighty for my age. Then he sat down and eat the\r\negg which Ethel had so kindly laid for him. After he had finished his\r\nmeal he got down and began to write to Bernard Clark he ran up stairs\r\non his fat legs and took out his blotter with a loud sniff and this is\r\nwhat he wrote\r\n\r\n     My dear Bernard\r\n\r\n     Certinly I shall come and stay with you next Monday I will bring\r\n     Ethel Monticue commonly called Miss M. She is very active and\r\n     pretty. I do hope I shall enjoy myself with you. I am fond of\r\n     digging in the garden and I am parshial to ladies if [Pg 26] they\r\n     are nice I suppose it is my nature. I am not quite a gentleman but\r\n     you would hardly notice it but cant be helped anyhow. We will come\r\n     by the 3-15.\r\n\r\n                              Your old and valud friend\r\n                                        Alfred Salteena.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my readers will be wondering why Bernard Clark had asked Mr\r\nSalteena to stay with him. He was a lonely man in a remote spot and he\r\nliked peaple and partys but he did not know many. What rot muttered\r\nBernard Clark as he read Mr Salteenas letter. He was rarther a\r\npresumshious man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST PAGE OF THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg 27]\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\nSTARTING GAILY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the great morning came Mr Salteena did not have an egg for his\r\nbrekfast in case he should be sick on the jorney.\r\n\r\nWhat top hat will you wear asked Ethel.\r\n\r\nI shall wear my best black and my white alpacka coat to keep off the\r\ndust and flies replied Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nI shall put some red ruge on my face said Ethel because I am very pale\r\nowing to the drains in this house.\r\n\r\nYou will look very silly said Mr Salteena with a dry laugh.\r\n\r\nWell so will you said Ethel in a snappy tone and she ran out of the\r\nroom with a very superier run throwing out her legs behind and her\r\narms swinging in rithum.\r\n\r\n[Pg 28]\r\nWell said the owner of the house she has a most idiotick run.\r\n\r\nPresently Ethel came back in her best hat and a lovly velvit coat of\r\nroyal blue. Do I look nice in my get up she asked.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena survayed her. You look rarther rash my dear your colors\r\ndont quite match your face but never mind I am just going up to say\r\ngoodbye to Rosalind the housemaid.\r\n\r\nWell dont be long said Ethel. Mr S. skipped upstairs to Rosalinds\r\nroom. Goodbye Rosalind he said I shall be back soon and I hope I shall\r\nenjoy myself.\r\n\r\nI make no doubt of that sir said Rosalind with a blush as Mr Salteena\r\nsilently put 2/6 on the dirty toilet cover.\r\n\r\nTake care of your bronkitis said Mr S. rarther bashfully and he\r\nhastilly left the room waving his hand carelessly to the housemaid.\r\n\r\nCome along cried Ethel powdering her nose in the hall let us get into\r\nthe cab. Mr [Pg 29] Salteena did not care for powder but he was an\r\nunselfish man so he dashed into the cab. Sit down said Ethel as the\r\ncabman waved his whip you are standing on my luggage. Well I am paying\r\nfor the cab said Mr S. so I might be allowed to put my feet were I like.\r\n\r\nThey traveled 2nd class in the train and Ethel was longing to go first\r\nbut thought perhaps least said soonest mended. Mr Salteena got very\r\nexcited in the train about his visit. Ethel was calm but she felt\r\nexcited inside. Bernard has a big house said Mr. S. gazing at Ethel he\r\nis inclined to be rich.\r\n\r\nOh indeed said Ethel looking at some cows flashing past the window.\r\nMr. S. felt rarther disheartened so he read the paper till the train\r\nstopped and the porters shouted Rickamere station. We had better\r\ncollect our traps said Mr Salteena and just then a very exalted\r\nfootman in a cocked hat and olive green uniform put his head in [Pg 30]\r\nat the window. Are you for Rickamere Hall he said in impressive tones.\r\n\r\nWell yes I am said Mr Salteena and so is this lady.\r\n\r\nVery good sir said the noble footman if you will alight I will see to\r\nyour luggage there is a convayance awaiting you.\r\n\r\nOh thankyou thankyou said Mr. S. and he and Ethel stepped along the\r\nplatform. Outside they found a lovely cariage lined with olive green\r\ncushons to match the footman and the horses had green bridles and bows\r\non their manes and tails. They got gingerly in. Will he bring our\r\nluggage asked Ethel nervously.\r\n\r\nI expect so said Mr Salteena lighting a very long cigar.\r\n\r\nDo we tip him asked Ethel quietly.\r\n\r\nWell no I dont think so not yet we had better just thank him\r\nperlitely.\r\n\r\nJust then the footman staggered out with the bagage. Ethel bowed\r\ngracefully over the door of the cariage and Mr S. waved his [Pg 31] hand\r\nas each bit of luggage was hoisted up to make sure it was all there.\r\nThen he said thankyou my good fellow very politely. Not at all sir said\r\nthe footman and touching his cocked hat he jumped actively to the box.\r\n\r\nI was right not to tip him whispered Mr Salteena the thing to do is to\r\nleave 2/6 on your dressing table when your stay is over.\r\n\r\nDoes he find it asked Ethel who did not really know at all how to go\r\non at a visit. I beleeve so replied Mr Salteena anyhow it is quite the\r\ncustom and we cant help it if he does not. Now my dear what do you\r\nthink of the sceenery\r\n\r\nVery nice said Ethel gazing at the rich fur rug on her knees. Just\r\nthen the cariage rolled into a beautifull drive with tall trees and\r\nbig red flowers growing amid shiny dark leaves. Presently the haughty\r\ncoachman pulled up with a great clatter at a huge front door with tall\r\npillers each side a big iron bell and two very clean scrapers. The\r\ndoors flung open as if by majic causing [Pg 32] Ethel to jump and a portly\r\nbutler appeared on the scene with a very shiny shirt front and a huge\r\npale face. Welcome sir he exclaimed good naturedly as Mr Salteena\r\nalighted rarther quickly from the viacle and please to step inside.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena stepped in as bid followed by Ethel. The footman again\r\nstruggled with the luggage and the butler Francis Minnit by name\r\nkindly lent a hand. The hall was very big and hung round with guns and\r\nmate and ancesters giving it a gloomy but a grand air. The butler then\r\nshowed them down a winding corridoor till he came to a door which he\r\nflung open shouting Mr Salteena and a lady sir.\r\n\r\nA tall man of 29 rose from the sofa. He was rarther bent in the middle\r\nwith very nice long legs fairish hair and blue eyes. Hullo Alf old boy\r\nhe cried so you have got here all safe and no limbs broken.\r\n\r\nNone thankyou Bernard replied Mr Salteena shaking hands and let me\r\nintroduce [Pg 33] Miss Monticue she is very pleased to come for this\r\nvisit. Oh yes gasped Ethel blushing through her red ruge. Bernard looked\r\nat her keenly and turned a dark red. I am glad to see you he said I hope\r\nyou will enjoy it but I have not arranged any partys yet as I dont\r\nknow anybody.\r\n\r\nDont worry murmered Ethel I dont mix much in Socierty and she gave him\r\na dainty smile.\r\n\r\nI expect you would like some tea said Bernard I will ring.\r\n\r\nYes indeed we should said Mr Salteena egerly. Bernard pealed on the\r\nbell and the butler came in with a stately walk.\r\n\r\nTea please Minnit crid Bernard Clark. With pleshure sir replied Minnit\r\nwith a deep bow. A glorious tea then came in on a gold tray two kinds\r\nof bread and butter a lovly jam role and lots of sugar cakes. Ethels\r\neyes began to sparkle and she made several remarks during the meal. I\r\nexpect [Pg 34] you would now like to unpack said Bernard when it was over.\r\n\r\nWell yes that is rarther an idear said Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nI have given the best spare room to Miss Monticue said Bernard with a\r\ngallant bow and yours turning to Mr Salteena opens out of it so you\r\nwill be nice and friendly both the rooms have big windows and a\r\nhandsome view.\r\n\r\nHow charming said Ethel. Yes well let us go up replied Bernard and he\r\nled the way up many a winding stairway till they came to an oak door\r\nwith some lovly swans and bull rushes painted on it. Here we are he\r\ncried gaily. Ethels room was indeed a handsome compartment with purple\r\nsilk curtains and a 4 post bed draped with the same shade. The toilit\r\nset was white and mouve and there were some violets in a costly varse.\r\nOh I say cried Ethel in supprise. I am glad you like it said Bernard\r\nand here we have yours Alf. He opened [Pg 35] the dividing doors and\r\nportrayed a smaller but dainty room all in pale yellow and wild\r\nprimroses. My own room is next the bath room said Bernard it is\r\ndecerated dark red as I have somber tastes. The bath room has got a\r\ntip up bason and a hose thing for washing your head.\r\n\r\nA good notion said Mr Salteena who was secretly getting jellus.\r\n\r\nHere we will leave our friends to unpack and end this Chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg 36]\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST EVENING\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they had unpacked Mr Salteena and Ethel went downstairs to\r\ndinner. Mr Salteena had put on a compleat evening suit as he thought\r\nit was the correct idear and some ruby studs he had got at a sale.\r\nEthel had on a dress of yellaw silk covered with tulle which was quite\r\nin the fashion and she had on a necklace which Mr Salteena gave her\r\nfor a birthday present. She looked very becomeing and pretty and\r\nBernard heaved a sigh as he gave her his arm to go into dinner. The\r\nbutler Minnit was quite ready for the fray standing up very stiff and\r\nsurrounded by two footmen in green plush and curly white wigs who were\r\ncalled Charles and Horace.\r\n\r\nWell said Mr Salteena lapping up his [Pg 37] turtle soup you have a\r\nvery sumpshous house Bernard.\r\n\r\nHis friend gave a weary smile and swollowed a few drops of sherry\r\nwine. It is fairly decent he replied with a bashful glance at Ethel\r\nafter our repast I will show you over the premisis.\r\n\r\nMany thanks said Mr Salteena getting rarther flustered with his forks.\r\n\r\nYou ourght to give a ball remarked Ethel you have such large\r\ncompartments.\r\n\r\nYes there is room enough sighed Bernard we might try a few steps and\r\nmeanwhile I might get to know a few peaple.\r\n\r\nSo you might responded Ethel giving him a speaking look.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena was growing a little peevish but he cheered up when the\r\nPort wine came on the table and the butler put round some costly\r\nfinger bowls. He did not have any in his own house and he followed\r\nBernard Clarks advice as to what to do with them. After dinner Ethel\r\nplayed some [Pg 38] merry tunes on the piano and Bernard responded with\r\na rarther loud song in a base voice and Ethel clapped him a good deal.\r\nThen Mr Salteena asked a few riddles as he was not musicle. Then\r\nBernard said shall I show you over my domain and they strolled into\r\nthe gloomy hall.\r\n\r\nI see you have a lot of ancesters said Mr Salteena in a jelous tone,\r\nwho are they.\r\n\r\nWell said Bernard they are all quite correct. This is my aunt Caroline\r\nshe was rarther exentrick and quite old.\r\n\r\nSo I see said Mr Salteena and he passed on to a lady with a very tight\r\nwaist and quearly shaped. That is Mary Ann Fudge my grandmother I\r\nthink said Bernard she was very well known in her day.\r\n\r\nWhy asked Ethel who was rarther curious by nature.\r\n\r\nWell I dont quite know said Bernard but she was and he moved away to\r\nthe next picture. It was of a man with a fat smiley face and a red\r\nribbon round him and a lot [Pg 39] of medals. My great uncle Ambrose\r\nFudge said Bernard carelessly.\r\n\r\nHe looks a thourough ancester said Ethel kindly.\r\n\r\nWell he was said Bernard in a proud tone he was really the Sinister\r\nson of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nNot really cried Ethel in excited tones but what does that mean.\r\n\r\nWell I dont quite know said Bernard Clark it puzzles me very much but\r\nancesters do turn quear at times.\r\n\r\nPeraps it means god son said Mr Salteena in an inteligent voice.\r\n\r\nWell I dont think so said Bernard but I mean to find out.\r\n\r\nIt is very grand anyhow said Ethel.\r\n\r\nIt is that replied her host geniully.\r\n\r\nWho is this said Mr Salteena halting at a picture of a lady holding up\r\nsome grapes and smiling a good deal.\r\n\r\nHer name was called Minnie Pilato responded Bernard she was rarther\r\nfar back [Pg 40] but a real relation and she was engaged to the earl of\r\nTullyvarden only it did not quite come off.\r\n\r\nWhat a pity crid Ethel.\r\n\r\nYes it was rarther replied Bernard but she marrid a Captain in the\r\nNavy and had seven children so she was quite alright.\r\n\r\nHere Mr Salteena thourght he had better go to bed as he had had a long\r\njornney. Bernard always had a few prayers in the hall and some whiskey\r\nafterwards as he was rarther pious but Mr Salteena was not very\r\nadicted to prayers so he marched up to bed. Ethel stayed as she\r\nthourght it would be a good thing. The butler came in as he was a very\r\nholy man and Bernard piously said the Our Father and a very good hymm\r\ncalled I will keep my anger down and a Decad of the Rosary. Ethel\r\nchimed in quiutly and Francis Minnit was most devout and Ethel\r\nthourght what a good holy family she was stopping with. So I will end\r\nmy chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg 41]\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n\r\nMR SALTEENAS PLAN\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Salteena woke up rarther early next day and was supprised and\r\ndelighted to find Horace the footman entering with a cup of tea.\r\n\r\nOh thankyou my man said Mr Salteena rolling over in the costly bed. Mr\r\nClark is nearly out of the bath sir anounced Horace I will have great\r\nplesure in turning it on for you if such is your desire. Well yes you\r\nmight said Mr Salteena seeing it was the idear and Horace gave a\r\nprofound bow.\r\n\r\nEthel are you getting up shouted Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nVery nearly replied Ethel faintly from the next room.\r\n\r\nI say said Mr Salteena excitedly I have had some tea in bed.\r\n\r\n[Pg 42]\r\nSo have I replied Ethel.\r\n\r\nThen Mr Salteena got into a mouve dressing goun with yellaw tassles\r\nand siezing his soap he wandered off to the bath room which was most\r\nsumpshous. It had a lovly white shiny bath and sparkling taps and\r\nseveral towels arrayed in readiness by thourghtful Horace. It also had\r\na step for climbing up the bath and other good dodges of a rich\r\nnature. Mr Salteena washed himself well and felt very much better.\r\nAfter brekfast Mr Salteena asked Bernard if he could have some privite\r\nconversation with him. Well yes replied Bernard if you will come into\r\nmy study we can have a few words.\r\n\r\nCant I come too muttered Ethel sulkily.\r\n\r\nNo my dear said Mr Salteena this is privite.\r\n\r\nPerhaps later I might have a privite chat with you Miss Monticue said\r\nBernard kindly.\r\n\r\nOh do lets said Ethel.\r\n\r\n[Pg 43]\r\nThen Bernard and Mr S. strolled to the study and sat upon two arm\r\nchairs. Fire away said Bernard lighting his pipe. Well I cant exactly\r\ndo that said Mr Salteena in slow tones it is a searious matter and you\r\ncan advise me as you are a thorugh gentleman I am sure.\r\n\r\nWell yes said Bernard what can I do for you eh Alf?\r\n\r\nYou can help me perhaps to be more like a gentleman said Mr Salteena\r\ngetting rarther hot I am quite alright as they say but I would like to\r\nbe the real thing can it be done he added slapping his knees.\r\n\r\nI dont quite know said Bernard it might take a good time.\r\n\r\nMight it said Mr S. but I would slave for years if need be. Bernard\r\nscratched his head. Why dont you try the Crystal Pallace he asked\r\nseveral peaple Earls and even dukes have privite compartments there.\r\n\r\nBut I am not an Earl said Mr Salteena in a purplexed tone.\r\n\r\n[Pg 44]\r\nTrue replied Bernard but I understand there are sort of students there\r\nwho want to get into the War Office and notable banks.\r\n\r\nWould that be a help asked Mr Salteena egerly.\r\n\r\nWell it might said Bernard I can give you a letter to my old pal the\r\nEarl of Clincham who lives there he might rub you up and by mixing\r\nwith him you would probably grow more seemly.\r\n\r\nOh ten thousand thanks said Mr Salteena I will go there as soon as it\r\ncan be arranged if you would be so kind as to keep an eye on Ethel\r\nwhile I am away.\r\n\r\nOh yes said Bernard I may be running up to town for a few days and she\r\ncould come too.\r\n\r\nYou are too kind said Mr Salteena and I dont think you will find her\r\nany trouble.\r\n\r\nNo I dont think I shall said Bernard she is a pretty girl cheerful and\r\nactive. And he blushed rarther red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg 45]\r\nCHAPTER 5\r\n\r\nTHE CRYSTAL PALACE\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 9 oclock next morning Mr Salteena stood bag in hand in the\r\nancestle hall waiting for the viacle to convay him to the station.\r\nBernard Clark and Ethel were seated side by side on a costly sofa\r\ngazing abstractly at the parting guest. Horace had dashed off to put\r\non his cocked hat as he was going in the baroushe but Francis Minnit\r\nwas roaming about the hall well prepared for any deed.\r\n\r\nWell said Bernard puffing at his meershum pipe I hope you will get on\r\nAlf I am sure you have that little letter to old Clincham eh\r\n\r\nIn deed I have said Mr Salteena many thanks for the same and I do hope\r\nEthel will behave properly.\r\n\r\n[Pg 46]\r\nOh yes I expect she will said Bernard with a sigh.\r\n\r\nI always do said Ethel in a snappy tone.\r\n\r\nJust then there was a great clatter outside and the sound of hoofs and\r\na loud neigh. The barouche I take it said Bernard rising slowly.\r\n\r\nQuite correct sir said Minnit flinging wide the portles.\r\n\r\nWell goodbye Alf old man said Bernard Clark good luck and God bless\r\nyou he added in a pius tone.\r\n\r\nNot at all said Mr Salteena I have enjoyed my stop which has been\r\nshort and sweet well goodbye Ethel my child he said as bag in hand he\r\nproceeded to the door. Francis Minnit bowed low and handed a small\r\nparcel to Mr Salteena a few sandwighs for the jorney sir he remarked.\r\n\r\nOh this is most kind said Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nMinnit closed his eyes with a tired smile. Not kind sir he muttered\r\nquite usual.\r\n\r\nOh really said Mr Salteena feeling rather [Pg 47] flabergasted well\r\ngoodbye my good fellow and he slipped 2/6 into the butlers open palm.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena had to travel first class as active Horace ran on to buy\r\nthe ticket which he presented with a low bow the _Times_ and\r\n_Tit-Bits_. Oh many thanks my man said Mr Salteena in a most airy\r\nvoice now will you find me a corner seat in the train eh.\r\n\r\nIf there is one sir replied Horace.\r\n\r\nIn got Mr Salteena to his first class carrage surrounded by his\r\nluggage carefully piled up by kindly Horace. The other pasengers\r\nlooked full of envy at the curly white wig and green plush uniform of\r\nHorace. Mr Salteena crossed his legs in a lordly way and flung a fur\r\nrug over his knees though he was hot enough in all consciunce. He\r\nbegan to feel this was the thin end of the partition and he smiled as\r\nhe gently tapped the letter in his coat tail pocket. When Mr Salteena\r\narrived in [Pg 48] London he began to strolle up the principle streets\r\nthinking how gay all was. Presently he beheld a resterant with a big\r\nMenu outside and he went boldly in.\r\n\r\nIt was a sumpshous spot all done up in gold with plenty of looking\r\nglasses. Many hansome ladies and gentlemen were already partaking of\r\nchoice food and rich wines and whiskey and the scene was most lively.\r\nMr Salteena had a little whiskey to make him feel more at home. Then\r\nhe eat some curry to the tune of a merry valse on the band. He beat\r\ntime to the music and smiled kindly at the waiters and he felt very\r\nexcited inside. I am seeing life with a vengance he muttered to\r\nhimself as he paid his bill at the desk. Outside Mr Salteena found a\r\ntall policeman. Could you direct me to the Crystale Pallace if you\r\nplease said Mr Salteena nervously.\r\n\r\nWell said the geniul policeman my advice would be to take a cab sir.\r\n\r\n[Pg 49]\r\nOh would it said Mr Salteena then I will do so.\r\n\r\nHe hailed a Hansome and got speedily in to the Crystal Palace he cried\r\ngaily and holding his bag on his knees he prepared to enjoy the sights\r\nof the Metropilis. It was a merry drive and all too soon the Palace\r\nheaved in view. Mr Salteena sprang out and paid the man and then he\r\nentered the wondrous edifice. His heart beat very fast as two huge men\r\nin gold braid flung open the doors. Inside was a lovely fountain in\r\nthe middle and all round were little stalls where you could buy sweets\r\nand lemonade also scent handkerchiefs and many dainty articles. There\r\nwere a lot of peaple but nobody very noteable.\r\n\r\nAt last after buying two bottles of scent and some rarther nice sweets\r\nwhich stuck to his teeth Mr Salteena beheld a wooden door on which was\r\nnailed a notice saying To the Privite Compartments.\r\n\r\nAh ha said Mr Salteena to himself this is [Pg 50] evidently my next move,\r\nand he gently pushed open the door straitening his top hat as he did so.\r\nInside he found himself in a dimly lit passage with a thick and\r\nhandsom carpet. Mr Salteena gazed round and beheld in the gloom a very\r\nsuperier gentleman in full evening dress who was reading a newspaper\r\nand warming his hands on the hot water pipes. Mr Salteena advanced on\r\ntiptoe and coughed gently as so far the gentleman had paid no\r\nattention. However at the second cough he raised his eyes in a weary\r\nfashion. do you want anything he asked in a most noble voice.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena got very flustered. Well I am seeking the Earl of Clincham\r\nhe began in a trembly voice are you by any chance him he added most\r\nrespectfully.\r\n\r\nNo not exacktly replied the other my name happens to be Edward\r\nProcurio. I am half italian and I am the Groom of the Chambers.\r\n\r\n[Pg 51]\r\nWhat chambers asked Mr Salteena blinking his eyes.\r\n\r\nThese said Edward Procurio waving a thin arm.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena then noticed several red doors with names of people on\r\neach one. Oh I see he said then perhaps you can tell me where the Earl\r\nof Clincham is to be found.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the passage fourth door down said Procurio tritely of\r\ncourse he may be out one never knows what they are up to.\r\n\r\nI suppose not said Mr Salteena in an interested tone.\r\n\r\nOne can not gamble on anything really said Procurio returning to the\r\nhot water pipes though of course I know a lot more than most peaple\r\nabout the inmates here.\r\n\r\nWhat are the habbits of the Earl of Clincham said Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nProcurio gave a smile many and varius he replied I cant say much in my\r\nposition [Pg 52] but one lives and learns. He heaved a sigh and shruged\r\nhis shoulders.\r\n\r\nWell good day said Mr Salteena feeling better for the chat.\r\n\r\nProcurio nodded in silence as Mr Salteena trotted off down the\r\npassage. At last he came to a door labelled Clincham Earl of in big\r\nletters. With a beating heart Mr Salteena pulled the bell and the door\r\nswung open of its own accord. At the same moment a cheery voice rang\r\nout from the distance. Come in please I am in the study first door on\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nWith a nervous bound Mr Salteena obeyd these directions and found\r\nhimself in a small but handsome compartment done in dark green lether\r\nwith crests on the chairs. Over the mantlepiece was hung the painting\r\nof a lady in a low neck looking quite the thing. By the desk was\r\nseated a tall man of 35 with very nice eyes of a twinkly nature and\r\ncurly hair he wore a quite plain suit of palest grey but well [Pg 53]\r\nmade and on the table reposed a grey top hat which had evidently been\r\non his head recently. He had a rose in his button hole also a signet\r\nring.\r\n\r\nHullo said this pleasant fellow as Mr. Salteena was spell bound on\r\nmat.\r\n\r\nHullo your Lord Ship responded our hero bowing low and dropping his\r\ntop hat do I adress the Earl of Clincham.\r\n\r\nYou do said the Earl with a homely smile and who do I adress eh.\r\n\r\nOur hero bowed again Alfred Salteena he said in deep tones.\r\n\r\nOh I see said the kindly earl well come in my man and tell me who you\r\nare.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena seated himself gingerly on the edge of a crested chair.\r\n\r\nTo tell you the truth my Lord I am not anyone of import and I am not a\r\ngentleman as they say he ended getting very red and hot.\r\n\r\nHave some whiskey said lord Clincham and he poured the liquid into a\r\nglass at his [Pg 54] elbow. Mr. Salteena lapped it up thankfully.\r\n\r\nWell my man said the good natured earl what I say is what dose it\r\nmatter we cant all be of the Blood royal can we.\r\n\r\nNo said Mr Salteena but I suppose you are.\r\n\r\nLord Clincham waved a careless hand. A small portion flows in my viens\r\nhe said but it dose not worry me at all and after all he added piously\r\nat the Day of Judgement what will be the odds.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena heaved a sigh. I was thinking of this world he said.\r\n\r\nOh I see said the Earl but my own idear is that these things are as\r\npiffle before the wind.\r\n\r\nNot being an earl I cant say answered our hero but may I beg you to\r\nread this letter my Lord. He produced Bernards note from his coat\r\ntails. The Earl of Clincham took it in his long fingers. This is what\r\nhe read.\r\n\r\n[Pg 55]\r\n     My dear Clincham\r\n\r\n     The bearer of this letter is an old friend of mine not quite the\r\n     right side of the blanket as they say in fact he is the son of a\r\n     first rate butcher but his mother was a decent family called\r\n     Hyssopps of the Glen so you see he is not so bad and is desireus of\r\n     being the correct article. Could you rub him up a bit in Socierty\r\n     ways. I dont know much details about him but no doubt he will\r\n     supply all you need. I am keeping well and hope you are. I must run\r\n     up to the Compartments one day and look you up.\r\n\r\n                              Yours as ever your faithfull friend\r\n                                        Bernard Clark.\r\n\r\nThe Earl gave a slight cough and gazed at Mr Salteena thourghtfully.\r\n\r\nHave you much money he asked and are you prepared to spend a good\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\nOh yes quite gasped Mr Salteena I have plenty in the bank and \xa310 in\r\nready gold in my purse.\r\n\r\n[Pg 56]\r\nYou see these compartments are the haunts of the Aristockracy said the\r\nearl and they are kept going by peaple who have got something funny in\r\ntheir family and who want to be less mere if you can comprehend.\r\n\r\nIndeed I can said Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nPersonally I am a bit parshial to mere people said his Lordship but\r\nthe point is that we charge a goodly sum for our training here but\r\nhowever if you cant pay you need not join.\r\n\r\nI can and will proclaimed Mr Salteena and he placed a \xa310 note on the\r\ndesk. His Lordship slipped it in his trouser pocket. It will be \xa342\r\nbefore I have done with you he said but you can pay me here and there\r\nas convenient.\r\n\r\nOh thankyou cried Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nNot at all said the Earl and now to bissness. While here you will live\r\nin compartments in the basement known as Lower Range. You will get\r\nmany hints from the Groom of the Chambers as to clothes and [Pg 57]\r\nettiquett to menials. You will mix with me for grammer and I might take\r\nyou out hunting or shooting sometimes to give you a few tips. Also I\r\nhave lots of ladies partys which you will attend occasionally.\r\n\r\nMr Salteenas eyes flashed with excitement. I shall enjoy that he\r\ncried.\r\n\r\nHis Lordship coughed loudly. You may not marry while under instruction\r\nhe said firmly.\r\n\r\nOh I shall not need to thankyou said Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nYou must also decide on a profeshion said his Lordship as your\r\ninstruction will vary according.\r\n\r\nCould I be anything at Buckingham Pallace said Mr Salteena with\r\nflashing eyes.\r\n\r\nOh well I dont quite know said the noble earl but you might perhaps\r\ngallopp beside the royal baroushe if you care to try.\r\n\r\nOh indeed I should cried Mr Salteena I am very fond of fresh air and\r\nroyalties.\r\n\r\nWell said the earl with a knowing smile [Pg 58] I might arrange it with\r\nthe prince of Wales who I am rarther intimate with.\r\n\r\nNot really gasped Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nDear me yes remarked the earl carelessly and if we decide for you to\r\ngallopp by the royal viacle you must be mesured for some plush\r\nknickerbockers at once.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena glanced at his rarther fat legs and sighed.\r\n\r\nWell I must go out now and call on a few Dowigers said his Lordship\r\npicking up his elegent top hat. Well au revoir he added with a good\r\nfrench accent.\r\n\r\nAdieu my Lord cried Mr Salteena not to be out done we meet anon I take\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNot till tomorrow answered the earl you will now proceed to the lower\r\nregions where you will no doubt find tea. He nodded kindly and glided\r\nout in silence.\r\n\r\nHere I will end my chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg 59]\r\nCHAPTER 6\r\n\r\nHIGH LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Salteena awoke next morning in his small but pleasant room. It was\r\ndone in green and white with Monagrams on the toilit set. He had a\r\ntiny white bed with a green quilt and a picture of the Nativaty and\r\none of Windsor Castle on the walls. The sun was shining over all these\r\nthings as Mr Salteena opened his sleepy eyes. Just then there was rat\r\ntat on the door. Come in called Mr Salteena and in came Edward\r\nProcurio ballancing a tray very cleverly. He looked most elegant with\r\nhis shiny black hair and pale yellow face and half shut eyes. He\r\nsmiled in a very mystearious and superier way as he placed the tray on\r\nMr Salteenas pointed knees.\r\n\r\nYour early beverage he announced and [Pg 60] began to pull up the blinds\r\nstill smiling to himself.\r\n\r\nOh thankyou cried Mr Salteena feeling very towzld compared to this\r\ngrand fellow. Then to his great supprise Procurio began to open the\r\nwardrobe and look at Mr Salteenas suits making italian exclamations\r\nunder his breath. Mr Salteena dare not say a word so he swollowed his\r\ntea and eat a Marie biscuit hastilly. Presently Procurio advanced to\r\nthe bed with a bright blue serge suit. Will you wear this today sir he\r\nasked quietly.\r\n\r\nOh certainly said Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nAnd a clean shirt would not come amiss said Procurio what about this\r\npale blue and white stripe.\r\n\r\nWith pleashure replied Mr Salteena. So Procurio laid them out in neat\r\narray also a razer and brush for shaving. Then he opened a door saying\r\nThis is the bath room shall I turn on hot or cold.\r\n\r\n[Pg 61]\r\nI dont mind said Mr Salteena feeling very hot and ignorant.\r\n\r\nIt is best for you to decide sir said Procurio firmly.\r\n\r\nWell I will try cold said Mr Salteena feeling it was more manly to say\r\nthat. Procurio bowed and beat a retreat to the bath room. Then he\r\nreturned and told Mr. Salteena that when he was washed he would find\r\nhis breakfast in the sitting room. When Mr Salteena was dressed in his\r\nbest blue suit and clean shirt he stroled into the sitting room where\r\na gay canary was singing fit to burst in the window and a copple of\r\ndoves cooing in a whicker cage. A cheery smell greeted him as Procurio\r\nglided in with some steaming coffie. Mr Salteena felt more at home and\r\npassed a few remarks about the weather. Procurio smiled and uncovered\r\nsome lovely kidnys on toast and as he did so bent and whispered in Mr\r\nSalteenas ear you could have come in in your dressing gown.\r\n\r\n[Pg 62]\r\nMr Salteena gave a start. Oh can I he said ten thousand thanks.\r\n\r\nThen Procurio passed out and Mr Salteena finnished his kidneys and\r\nchiruped to the birds and had a cigarette from a handsome purple box\r\nwhich he found on the desk. Then Procurio entered once more and with a\r\nbow said. His lordship is going to a levie this morning and thinks it\r\nmight amuse you to go too. Could you be ready by 11 oclock.\r\n\r\nOh yes what fun said Mr Salteena have you any notion what a levie is\r\nmy man.\r\n\r\nProcurio gave a superier smile. It is a party given by the Queen to\r\nvery superier peaple but this one is given by the Prince of Wales as\r\nthe Queen is not quite her usual self today. It will be at Buckingham\r\npalace so you will drive with his lordship.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena was fearfully excited. What shall I weare he gasped.\r\n\r\nWell of course you ought to have black satin knickerbockers and a hat\r\nwith white [Pg 63] feathers also garters and a star or two.\r\n\r\nYou supprise me said Mr Salteena I have none of those articles.\r\n\r\nWell said Procurio kindly his lordship will lend you his second best\r\ncocked hat as you are obliged to wear one and I think with a little\r\nthourght I might rig you up so as to pass muster.\r\n\r\nThen they rumaged among Mr Salteenas things and Procurio got very\r\nintelligent and advised Mr Salteena to were his black evening suit and\r\nrole up his trousers. He also lent him a pair of white silk stockings\r\nwhich he fastened tightly round his knees with red rosettes. Then he\r\nquickly cut out a star in silver paper and pinned it to his chest and\r\nalso added a strip of red ribbon across his shirt front. Then Mr\r\nSalteena survayed himself in the glass. Is it a fancy dress party he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nNo they always were that kind of thing but wait till you see his\r\nLordship--if you are ready sir I will conduct you in.\r\n\r\n[Pg 64]\r\nMr Salteena followed Procurio up countless stairs till they came to\r\nthe Earls compartments and tapped on the bedroom door.\r\n\r\nCome in cried a merry voice and in they strode.\r\n\r\nI have done my best with Mr Salteena my lord I trust he will do the\r\nhat of course will make a deal of diffrence.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena bowed nervously wishing he had got correct knickerbockers\r\nas his trousers did not feel too firm in spite of the garters.\r\n\r\nNot half bad cried the earl try on the hat Salteena it is on my bed.\r\nMr Salteena placed it on his head and the feathers and gold braid\r\nbecame him very well but he felt very jellous of the earl who looked a\r\nsight for the gods. He had proper satin knickerbockers with diamond\r\nclasps and buckled shoes and black silk stockings which showed up his\r\nlong fine legs. He had a floppy shirt of softist muslin with real lace\r\ncollar and cuffs. A sword hung at [Pg 65] his side and a crimson sash\r\nwas round his waist and a splendid cocked hat on his head. His blue\r\neyes twinkled as he pulled on a pair of white kid gloves.\r\n\r\nWell come on Salteena he cried and dont be nervus I will get you a\r\npair of knickers tomorrow. Will you get a hansome Procurio.\r\n\r\nPresently the earl and Mr Salteena were clattering away to Buckingham\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nYou wont mind if I introduce you as Lord Hyssops do you said the earl\r\nas he lit his pipe. You see you are sort of mixed up with the family\r\nso it wont matter and will look better.\r\n\r\nSo it would said Mr Salteena what do we do at the levie.\r\n\r\nOh we strole round and eat ices and champaigne and that kind of thing\r\nand sometimes there is a little music.\r\n\r\nIs there any dancing asked Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nWell not always said the Earl.\r\n\r\nI am glad of that said Mr Salteena I am [Pg 66] not so nimble as I was\r\nand my garters are a trifle tight.\r\n\r\nSometimes we talk about the laws and politics said the earl if Her\r\nMajesty is in that kind of a mood.\r\n\r\nJust then the splendid edifice appeared in view and Mr Salteena licked\r\nhis dry lips at sight of the vast crowd. All round were carrages full\r\nof costly peaple and outside the railings stood tall Life Guards\r\nkeeping off the mere peaple who had gathered to watch the nobility\r\nclatter up. Lord Clincham began to bow right and left raising his\r\ncocked hat to his friends. There was a lot of laughter and friendly\r\nwords as the cab finally drew up at the front door. Two tall life\r\nguards whisked open the doors and one of them kindly tipped the\r\ncabman. Mr Salteena followed his lordship up the grand steps trying to\r\nfeel as homely as he could. Then a splendid looking fellow in a red\r\ntunick and a sort of black velvit tam a [Pg 67] shanter stepped forward\r\nfrom the throng shouting what name please.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Clincham and Lord Hyssops calmly replied the earl gently\r\nnudging Mr Salteena to act up. Mr Salteena nodded and blinked at the\r\nmenial as much as to say all is well and then he and the earl hung up\r\ntheir cocked hats on two pegs. This way cried a deep voice and another\r\nmenial apeared wearing stiff white britches top boots and a green\r\nvelvit coat with a leather belt also a very shiny top hat. They\r\nfollowed this fellow down countless corridoors and finally came to big\r\nfolding doors. The earl twiddled his mustache and slapped his leg with\r\nhis white glove as calmly as could be. Mr Salteena purspired rarther\r\nhard and gave a hitch to his garters to make sure.\r\n\r\nThen the portles divided and their names were shouted in chorus by\r\ncountless domesticks. The sumshious room was packed with men of a\r\nnoble nature dressed like the earl in satin knickerboccers etc and\r\nwith [Pg 68] ladies of every hue with long trains and jewels by the\r\ndozen. You could hardly moove in the gay throng. Dukes were as nought\r\nas there were a good lot of princes and Arch Dukes as it was a very\r\nsuperier levie indeed. The earl and Mr Salteena struggled through the\r\ncrowd till they came to a platform draped with white velvit. Here on a\r\ngolden chair was seated the prince of Wales in a lovely ermine cloak\r\nand a small but costly crown. He was chatting quite genially with some\r\nof the crowd.\r\n\r\nUp clambered the earl followed at top speed by Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nHullo Clincham cried the Prince quite homely and not at all grand so\r\nglad you turned up--quite a squash eh.\r\n\r\nA bit over powering your Highness said the earl who was quite used to\r\nall this may I introduce my friend Lord Hyssops he is staying with me\r\nso I thought I would bring him along if you dont mind Prince.\r\n\r\nNot at all cried the genial prince looking [Pg 69] rarther supprised.\r\nMr Salteena bowed so low he nearly fell off the platform and as the\r\nprince put out a hand Mr Salteena thought he had better kiss it. The\r\nPrince smiled kindly I am pleased to see you Lord Hyssops he said in a\r\nregal voice.\r\n\r\nThen the Earl chipped in and how is the dear Queen he said reveruntly.\r\n\r\nNot up to much said his Highness she feels the heat poor soul and he\r\nwaved to a placard which said in large letters The Queen is\r\nindisposed.\r\n\r\nPresently his Highness rose I think I will have a quiet glass of\r\nchampaigne he said you come too Clincham and bring your friend the\r\nDiplomats are arriving and I am not much in the mood for deep talk I\r\nhave already signed a dozen documents so I have done my duty.\r\n\r\nThey all went out by a private door and found themselves in a smaller\r\nbut gorgous room. The Prince tapped on the table and instantly two\r\nmenials in red tunics appeared. [Pg 70] Bring three glasses of champaigne\r\ncommanded the prince and some ices he added majestikally. The goods\r\nappeared as if by majic and the prince drew out a cigar case and\r\npassed it round.\r\n\r\nOne grows weary of Court Life he remarked.\r\n\r\nAh yes agreed the earl.\r\n\r\nIt upsets me said the prince lapping up his strawberry ice all I want\r\nis peace and quiut and a little fun and here I am tied down to this\r\nlife he said taking off his crown being royal has many painfull\r\ndrawbacks.\r\n\r\nTrue mused the Earl.\r\n\r\nSilence fell and the strains of the band could be heard from the next\r\nroom. Suddenly the prince gazed at Mr Salteena. Who did you say you\r\nwere he asked in a puzzled tone.\r\n\r\nLord Hyssops responded our hero growing purple at the lie.\r\n\r\nWell you are not a bit like the Lord [Pg 71] Hyssops I know replied the\r\nPrince could you explain matters.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena gazed helplessly at the earl who had grown very pale and\r\nseemed lost for the moment. However he quickly recovered.\r\n\r\nHe is quite alright really Prince he said His mother was called Miss\r\nHyssops of the Glen.\r\n\r\nIndeed said his royal Highness that sounds correct but who was your\r\nfather eh.\r\n\r\nThen Mr Salteena thourght he would not tell a lie so in trembly tones\r\nhe muttered My poor father was but a butcher your Highness a very\r\nhonest one I may add and passing rich he was called Domonic Salteena\r\nand my name is Alfred Salteena.\r\n\r\nThe Prince stroked his yellow beard and rarther admired Mr Salteena\r\nfor his truthful utterance--Oh I see he said well why did you palm off\r\non my menials as Lord Hyssops eh\r\n\r\nMr Salteena wiped his swetting brow but [Pg 72] the earl came to the\r\nrescue nobly. My fault entirely Prince he chimed in, as I was bringing\r\nhim to this very supearier levie I thought it would be better to say he\r\nwas of noble birth have I offended your Royal dignity.\r\n\r\nNot much said the prince it was a laudible notion and perhaps I will\r\nask Mr Salteena to one of my big balls some day.\r\n\r\nOh your Highness gasped our hero falling on one knee that would indeed\r\nbe a treat.\r\n\r\nI suppose Prince you have not got a job going at this palace for my\r\nfriend asked the earl you see I am rubbing him up in socierty ways and\r\nhe fancies court life as a professhon.\r\n\r\nOh dose he said the prince blinking his eyes well I might see.\r\n\r\nI suggested if there was a vacency going he might try cantering after\r\nthe royal barouche said the earl.\r\n\r\nSo he might said the prince I will speak [Pg 73] to the prime Minister\r\nabout it and let you know.\r\n\r\nTen thousand thanks cried Mr Salteena bowing low.\r\n\r\nWell now I must get along back to the levie announced the prince\r\nputting on his crown I have booked a valse with the Arch duchess of\r\nGreenwich and this is her favorite tune. So saying they issued back to\r\nthe big room where the nobility were whirling gaily roand the more\r\nsearious peaple such as the prime minister and the admirals etc were\r\neating ices and talking passionately about the laws in a low\r\nundertone.\r\n\r\nThe earl was soon mingling gaily in a set of lancers but Mr Salteena\r\ndare not because of his trousers. However he sat on a velvit chair and\r\nquite enjoyed over hearing the intelligent conversation of the prime\r\nminister. And now we will leave our hero enjoying his glimpse of high\r\nlife and return to Ethel Monticue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg 74]\r\nCHAPTER 7\r\n\r\nBERNARDS IDEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Mr Salteena had departed Bernard Clark thourght he would show\r\nEthel over his house so they spent a merry morning so doing. Ethel\r\npassed bright remarks on all the rooms and Bernard thourght she was\r\nmost pretty and Ethel began to be a bit excited. After a lovly lunch\r\nthey sat in the gloomy hall and Ethel began to feel very glad Mr\r\nSalteena was not there. Suddenly Bernard lit his pipe I was thinking\r\nhe said passionately what about going up to London for a weeks\r\nGaierty.\r\n\r\nWho inquired Ethel in a low tone.\r\n\r\nYou and me said Bernard I know of several splendid hotels and we could\r\ngo to theaters and parties and enjoy ourselves to the full.\r\n\r\n[Pg 75]\r\nSo we could what an idear cried Ethel.\r\n\r\nSo the merry plan was all arranged and they spent the afternoon in\r\npacking there trunks. Next day they were all ready in the hall when\r\nthe handsome viacle once more clattered up. Ethel had on her blue\r\nvelvit get up and a sweet new hat and plenty of ruge on her face and\r\nlooked quite a seemly counterpart for Bernard who was arrayed in a\r\nwhite and shiny mackintosh top boots and a well brushed top hat tied\r\non to him with a bit of black elastick.\r\n\r\nWell goodbye Minnit he cried to the somber butler take care of your\r\ngout and the silver and I will pay your wages when I come back.\r\n\r\nThankyou kindly sir murmured Minnit when may I expect your return.\r\n\r\nOh well I will wire he said and dashed doun the steps.\r\n\r\nEthel followed with small lady like steps having bowed perlitely to\r\nMinnit who closed his eyes in acknowlegment of her kindness.\r\n\r\n[Pg 76]\r\nThe sun was shining and Ethel had the feeling of going to a very jolly\r\nparty and felt so sorry for all the passers by who were not going to\r\nLondon with Bernard.\r\n\r\nArrived in the gay city Bernard hailed a eab to the manner born and\r\ngot in followed by Ethel. Kindly drive us to the Gaierty Hotel he\r\ncried in a firm tone. The cabman waved his whip and off they dashed.\r\n\r\nWe shall be highly comfortable and select at the Gaierty said Bernard\r\nand he thourght to himself how lovly it would be if he was married to\r\nEthel. He blushed a deep shade at his own thourghts and gave a side\r\nlong glance at Ethel who was gazing out of the window. Well one never\r\nknows he murmerd to himself and as one of the poets says great events\r\nfrom trivil causes springs.\r\n\r\nJust then they stopped at the gay hotel and Ethel was spellbound at\r\nthe size of the big hall--Bernard poked his head into the window of\r\nthe pay desk. Have you a coupple [Pg 77] of bedrooms for self and young\r\nlady he enquired in a lordly way.\r\n\r\nA very handsome lady with golden hair and a lace apron glanced at a\r\nbook and hastilly replied Oh yes sir two beauties on the 1st floor\r\nnumber 9 and 10.\r\n\r\nThankyou said Bernard we will go up if you have no objection.\r\n\r\nNone whatever sir said the genial lady the beds are well aired and the\r\nview is quite pleasant.\r\n\r\nCome along Ethel cried Bernard this sounds alright eh.\r\n\r\nOh quite said Ethel with a beaming smile.\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs and entered number 9 a very fine compartment with a\r\nlarge douny bed and white doors with glass handles leading into number\r\n10 an equally dainty room but a trifle smaller.\r\n\r\nWhich will you have Ethel asked Bernard.\r\n\r\nOh well I would rarther you settled it [Pg 78] said Ethel. I am willing\r\nto abide by your choice.\r\n\r\nThe best shall be yours then said Bernard bowing gallantly and\r\npointing to the biggest room.\r\n\r\nEthel blushed at his speaking look. I shall be quite lost in that huge\r\nbed she added to hide her embarassment.\r\n\r\nYes I expect you will said Bernard and now what about a little table\r\nd\'ote followed by a theater.\r\n\r\nOh yes cried Ethel and downstairs they went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg 79]\r\nCHAPTER 8\r\n\r\nA GAY CALL\r\n\r\n\r\nI tell you what Ethel said Bernard Clark about a week later we might\r\ngo and pay a call on my pal the Earl of Clincham.\r\n\r\nOh do lets cried Ethel who was game for any new adventure I would\r\ndearly love to meet his lordship.\r\n\r\nBernard gave a frown of jellousy at her rarther mere words.\r\n\r\nWell dress in your best he muttered.\r\n\r\nEthel skipped into her bedroom and arrayd herself in a grass green\r\nmuslin of decent cut a lace scarf long faun colored kid gloves and a\r\nmuslin hat to correspond. She carried a parasole in one hand also a\r\ngreen silk bag containing a few stray hair pins a clean handkerchief\r\nfive shillings and a pot of ruge in case. She looked a dainty vishen\r\n[Pg 80] with her fair hair waving in the breeze and Bernard bit his lips\r\nrarther hard for he could hardly contain himself and felt he must\r\nmarry Ethel soon. He looked a handsome sight himself in some exquisite\r\nwhite trousers with a silk shirt and a pale blue blazer belt and cap.\r\nHe wore this in honour of the earl who had been to Cambridge in his\r\nyouth and so had Bernard Clark.\r\n\r\nAt last they found themselves in the entrance hall of the Crystale\r\npalace and speedily made their way to the privite compartments. Edward\r\nProcurio was walking up and down the passage looking dark and\r\nmystearious as usual.\r\n\r\nIs His Lordship at home cried Bernard Clark cheerily.\r\n\r\nWhich one asked Procurio many lords live here he said scornfully.\r\n\r\nWell I mean the Earl of Clincham said Bernard.\r\n\r\nOh yes he is in responded Procurio and to the best of my belief giving\r\na party.\r\n\r\n[Pg 81]\r\nIndeed ejaculated Bernard we have come in the nick of time Ethel he\r\nadded. Yes said Ethel in an excited tone.\r\n\r\nThen they pealed on the bell and the door flew open. Sounds of\r\nlaughter and comic songs issued from the abode and in a second they\r\nwere in the crowded drawing room. It was packed with all the Elite and\r\na stout duchess with a good natured face was singing a lively song and\r\ncausing much merriment. The earl strode forward at sight of two new\r\ncomers. Hullo Bernard old boy he cried this is a pleasure and who have\r\nyou got with you he added glancing at Ethel.\r\n\r\nOh this is Miss Monticue said Bernard shall I introduce you----\r\n\r\nIf you will be so good said the Earl in an affable tone and Bernard\r\nhastily performed the right. Ethel began a bright conversatiun while\r\nBernard stroled off to see if he could find any friends amid the\r\nthrong.\r\n\r\n[Pg 82]\r\nWhat pleasant compartments you have cried Ethel in rarther a socierty\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nFairly so so responded the Earl do you lire in London he added in a\r\nloud tone as someone was playing a very difficult peice on the piano.\r\n\r\nWell no I dont said Ethel my home is really in Northumberland but I am\r\nat present stopping with Mr Clark at the Gaierty Hotel she continud in\r\na somewhat showing off tone.\r\n\r\nOh I see said the earl well shall I introduce you to a few of my\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nOf please do said Ethel with a dainty blow at her nose.\r\n\r\nThe earl disserppeard into the madding crowd and presently came back\r\nwith a middle aged gentleman. This is Lord Hyssops he said my friend\r\nMiss Monticue he added genially.\r\n\r\nEthel turned a dull yellaw. Lord Hyssops she said in a faint voice why\r\nit is Mr Salteena I know him well.\r\n\r\n[Pg 83]\r\nHush cried the Earl it is a title bestowd recently by my friend the\r\nPrince of Wales.\r\n\r\nYes indeed murmered Mr Salteena deeply flabbergasted by the ready wit\r\nof the earl.\r\n\r\nOh indeed said Ethel in a peevish tone well how do you come to be\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nI am stopping with his Lordship said Mr Salteena and have a set of\r\ncompartments in the basement so there.\r\n\r\nI dont care said huffy Ethel I am in handsome rooms at the Gaierty.\r\n\r\nNothing could be nicer I am sure struck in the earl what do you say\r\nHyssops eh.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it is charming said Mr Salteena who was wanting peace tell\r\nme Ethel how did you leave Bernard.\r\n\r\nI have not left him said Ethel in an annoying voice I am stopping with\r\nhim at the gaierty and we have been to lots of theaters and dances.\r\n\r\nWell I am glad you are enjoying yourself said Mr Salteena kindly you\r\nhad been looking pale of late.\r\n\r\n[Pg 84]\r\nNo wonder in your stuffy domain cried Ethel well have you got any more\r\nfriends she added turning to the earl.\r\n\r\nWell I will see said the obliging earl and he once more disapeared.\r\n\r\nI dont know why you should turn against me Ethel said Mr Salteena in a\r\nlow tone.\r\n\r\nEthel patted her hair and looked very sneery. Well I call it very\r\nmystearious you going off and getting a title said Ethel and I think\r\nour friendship had better stop as no doubt you will soon be marrying a\r\nduchess or something.\r\n\r\nNot at all said Mr Salteena you must know Ethel he said blushing a\r\ndeep red I always wished to marry you some fine day.\r\n\r\nThis is news to me cried Ethel still peevish.\r\n\r\nBut not to me murmered Mr Salteena and his voice trembled in his\r\nchest. I may add that I have always loved you and now I seem to do so\r\nmadly he added passionately.\r\n\r\n[Pg 85]\r\nBut I dont love you responded Ethel.\r\n\r\nBut if you married me you might get to said Mr Salteena.\r\n\r\nI think not replied Ethel and all the same it is very kind of you to\r\nask me and she smiled more nicely at him.\r\n\r\nThis is agony cried Mr Salteena clutching hold of a table my life will\r\nbe sour grapes and ashes without you.\r\n\r\nBe a man said Ethel in a gentle whisper and I shall always think of\r\nyou in a warm manner.\r\n\r\nWell half a loaf is better than no bread responded Mr Salteena in a\r\ngloomy voice and just then the earl reappeard with a very brisk lady\r\nin a tight silk dress whose name was called Lady Gay Finchling and her\r\nhusband was a General but had been dead a few years. So this is Miss\r\nMonticue she began in a rarther high voice. Oh yes said Ethel and Mr\r\nSalteena wiped the foaming dew from his forehead. Little did Lady [Pg 86]\r\nGay Finchling guess she had just disturbed a proposal of marrage.\r\n\r\nThe Earl chimed into the conversation now and again and Lady Gay\r\nFinchling told several rarther witty stories to enliven the party.\r\nThen Bernard Clark came up and said they had better be going.\r\n\r\nWell goodbye Clincham he said I must say I have enjoyed this party\r\nmost rechauffie I call it dont you Ethel.\r\n\r\nMost cried Ethel I suppose you often come she added in a tone of envy\r\nto Lady Gay Finchling.\r\n\r\nPretty often said Lady G. F. well goodbye as I see you are in a hurry\r\nto be off and she dashed off towards the refreshment place.\r\n\r\nGoodbye Ethel said poor Mr Salteena in a spasam and he seized hold of\r\nher hand you will one day rue your wicked words farewell he repeated\r\nemphatically.\r\n\r\nOh well goodbye said Ethel in a vage tone and then turning to the earl\r\nshe said [Pg 87] I have enjoyed myself very much thankyou.\r\n\r\nPlease dont mention it cried the earl well goodbye Bernard he added I\r\nshall look you up some day at your hotel.\r\n\r\nYes do muttered Bernard always welcome Clincham old boy he added\r\nplacing his blue crickit cap on his head and so saying he and Ethel\r\nleft the gay scene and once more oozed fourth into the streets of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg 88]\r\nCHAPTER 9\r\n\r\nA PROPOSALE\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning while imbibing his morning tea beneath his pink silken\r\nquilt Bernard decided he must marry Ethel with no more delay. I love\r\nthe girl he said to himself and she must be mine but I somehow feel I\r\ncan not propose in London it would not be seemly in the city of\r\nLondon. We must go for a day in the country and when surrounded by the\r\ngay twittering of the birds and the smell of the cows I will lay my\r\nsuit at her feet and he waved his arm wildly at the gay thought. Then\r\nhe sprang from bed and gave a rat tat at Ethels door.\r\n\r\nAre you up my dear he called.\r\n\r\nWell not quite said Ethel hastilly jumping from her downy nest.\r\n\r\nBe quick cried Bernard I have a plan to [Pg 89] spend a day near Windsor\r\nCastle and we will take our lunch and spend a happy day.\r\n\r\nOh Hurrah shouted Ethel I shall soon be ready as I had my bath last\r\nnight so wont wash very much now.\r\n\r\nNo dont said Bernard and added in a rarther fervent tone through the\r\nchink of the door you are fresher than the rose my dear no soap could\r\nmake you fairer.\r\n\r\nThen he dashed off very embarrased to dress. Ethel blushed and felt a\r\nbit excited as she heard the words and she put on a new white muslin\r\ndress in a fit of high spirits. She looked very beautifull with some\r\nred roses in her hat and the dainty red ruge in her cheeks looked\r\nquite the thing. Bernard heaved a sigh and his eyes flashed as he\r\nbeheld her and Ethel thorght to herself what a fine type of manhood he\r\nreprisented with his nice thin legs in pale broun trousers and well\r\nfitting spats and a red rose in his button hole and rarther a sporting\r\ncap which gave him a great air [Pg 90] with its quaint check and little\r\nflaps to pull down if necesarry. Off they started the envy of all the\r\nwaiters.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Windsor very hot from the jorney and Bernard at once\r\nhired a boat to row his beloved up the river. Ethel could not row but\r\nshe much enjoyed seeing the tough sunburnt arms of Bernard tugging at\r\nthe oars as she lay among the rich cushons of the dainty boat. She had\r\na rarther lazy nature but Bernard did not know of this. However he\r\nsoon got dog tired and sugested lunch by the mossy bank.\r\n\r\nOh yes said Ethel quickly opening the sparkling champaigne.\r\n\r\nDont spill any cried Bernard as he carved some chicken.\r\n\r\nThey eat and drank deeply of the charming viands ending up with\r\nmerangs and choclates.\r\n\r\nLet us now bask under the spreading trees said Bernard in a passiunate\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nOh yes lets said Ethel and she opened her [Pg 91] dainty parasole and\r\nsank down upon the long green grass. She closed her eyes but she was far\r\nfrom asleep. Bernard sat beside her in profound silence gazing at her\r\npink face and long wavy eye lashes. He puffed at his pipe for some\r\nmoments while the larks gaily caroled in the blue sky. Then he edged a\r\ntrifle closer to Ethels form.\r\n\r\nEthel he murmured in a trembly voice.\r\n\r\nOh what is it said Ethel hastily sitting up.\r\n\r\nWords fail me ejaculated Bernard horsly my passion for you is intense\r\nhe added fervently. It has grown day and night since I first beheld\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nOh said Ethel in supprise I am not prepared for this and she lent back\r\nagainst the trunk of the tree.\r\n\r\nBernard placed one arm tightly round her. When will you marry me Ethel\r\nhe uttered you must be my wife it has come to that I love you so\r\nintensly that if you say no I shall perforce dash my body to the\r\n[Pg 92] brink of yon muddy river he panted wildly.\r\n\r\nOh dont do that implored Ethel breathing rarther hard.\r\n\r\nThen say you love me he cried.\r\n\r\nOh Bernard she sighed fervently I certinly love you madly you are to\r\nme like a Heathen god she cried looking at his manly form and handsome\r\nflashing face I will indeed marry you.\r\n\r\nHow soon gasped Bernard gazing at her intensly.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible said Ethel gently closing her eyes.\r\n\r\nMy Darling whispered Bernard and he seiezed her in his arms we will be\r\nmarrid next week.\r\n\r\nOh Bernard muttered Ethel this is so sudden.\r\n\r\nNo no cried Bernard and taking the bull by both horns he kissed her\r\nviolently on her dainty face. My bride to be he murmered several\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[Pg 93]\r\nEthel trembled with joy as she heard the mistick words.\r\n\r\nOh Bernard she said little did I ever dream of such as this and she\r\nsuddenly fainted into his out stretched arms.\r\n\r\nOh I say gasped Bernard and laying the dainty burden on the grass he\r\ndashed to the waters edge and got a cup full of the fragrant river to\r\npour on his true loves pallid brow.\r\n\r\nShe soon came to and looked up with a sickly smile Take me back to the\r\nGaierty hotel she whispered faintly.\r\n\r\nWith plesure my darling said Bernard I will just pack up our viands\r\nere I unloose the boat.\r\n\r\nEthel felt better after a few drops of champagne and began to tidy her\r\nhair while Bernard packed the remains of the food. Then arm in arm\r\nthey tottered to the boat.\r\n\r\nI trust you have not got an illness my darling murmured Bernard as he\r\nhelped her in.\r\n\r\n[Pg 94]\r\nOh no I am very strong said Ethel I fainted from joy she added to\r\nexplain matters.\r\n\r\nOh I see said Bernard handing her a cushon well some people do he\r\nadded kindly and so saying they rowed down the dark stream now flowing\r\nsilently beneath a golden moon. All was silent as the lovers glided\r\nhome with joy in their hearts and radiunce on their faces only the\r\nsound of the mystearious water lapping against the frail vessel broke\r\nthe monotony of the night.\r\n\r\nSo I will end my chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg 95]\r\nCHAPTER 10\r\n\r\nPREPARING FOR THE FRAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next few days were indeed bussy for Ethel and Bernard. First of\r\nall Ethel got some dainty pink note paper with silver crest on it and\r\nsent out invitations in the following terms to all their frends.\r\n\r\n  Miss Ethel Monticue will be married to\r\n  Mr Bernard Clark at Westminster Abbey\r\n  on June 10th. Your company is requested\r\n  there at 2-30 sharp and afterwards\r\n  for refreshment at the Gaierty Hotel.\r\n  R.S.V.P.\r\n\r\nHaving posted heaps of these and got several replies Ethel began to\r\norder her wedding dress which cost a good bit. She chose a rich satin\r\nwith a humped pattern of gold on the pure white and it had a long\r\ntrain [Pg 96] edged with Airum lilies. Her veil was of pure lace with a\r\ncrown of orange blossum. Her bouquett she ordered to be of white dog\r\ndaisies St. Joseph lilies and orange blossums tied up with pale blue\r\nsatin ribbon.\r\n\r\nYou will indeed be a charming spectacle my darling gasped Bernard as\r\nthey left the shop. Then they drove to the tailor where Bernard\r\nordered an elligant black suit with coat tails lined with crimson\r\nsatin and a pale lavender tie and an opera hat of the same hue and he\r\nintended to wear violets in his buttonholes also his best white spats\r\ndiamond studs and a few extras of costly air. They both ordered a lot\r\nof new clothes besides and Bernard gave Ethel a very huge tara made of\r\nrubies and diamonds also two rich bracelets and Ethel gave him a bran\r\nnew trunk of shiny green leather. The earl of Clincham sent a charming\r\ngift of some hem stitched sheets edged with real lace and a photo of\r\nhimself in a striking attitude. [Pg 97] Mr Salteena sent Ethel a bible\r\nwith a few pious words of advice and regret and he sent Bernard a very\r\nhandy little camp stool. Ethels parents were too poor to come so far but\r\nher Mother sent her a gold watch which did not go but had been some years\r\nin the family and her father provided a cheque for \xa32 and promised to\r\nsend her a darling little baby calf when ready. Then they ordered the\r\nmost splendid refreshments they had tea and coffie and sparkling wines\r\nto drink also a lovly wedding cake of great height with a sugar angel\r\nat the top holding a sword made of almond paste. They had countless\r\ncakes besides also ices jelly merangs jam tarts with plenty of jam on\r\neach some cold tongue some ham with salid and a pig\'s head done up in\r\na wondrous manner. Ethel could hardly contain herself as she gazed at\r\nthe sumpshious repast and Bernard gave her a glass of rich wine while\r\nhe imbibed some whiskey before going to bed. Ethel got speedilly into\r\nher [Pg 98] bed for the last time at the dear old Gaierty and shed a few\r\nsalt tears thinking of her past life but she quickly cheerd up and began\r\nto plan about how many children she would have. I hope I shall have a\r\ngood lot she thourght to herself and so saying fell into repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg 99]\r\nCHAPTER 11\r\n\r\nTHE WEDDING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Abbey was indeed thronged next day when Ethel and Bernard cantered\r\nup in a very fine carrage drawn by two prancing steeds who foamed a\r\ngood deal. In the porch stood several clean altar boys who conducted\r\nthe lucky pair up the aile while the organ pealed a merry blast The\r\nmighty edifice was packed and seated in the front row was the Earl of\r\nClincham looking very brisk as he was going to give Ethel away at the\r\ncorrect moment. Beside him sat Mr Salteena all in black and looking\r\nbitterly sad and he ground his teeth as Ethel came marching up. There\r\nwere some merry hymns and as soon as Ethel and Bernard were one the\r\nclergyman began a sermon about Adam and Eve and the serpent and [Pg 100]\r\nMr Salteena cried into his large handkerchief and the earl kept on\r\nnudging him as his sniffs were rarther loud. Then the wedding march\r\npealed fourth and doun the church stepped Ethel and Bernard as husband\r\nand wife. Into the cab they got and speedelly dashed off to the\r\nGaierty. The wedding refreshments were indeed a treat to all and even\r\nMr Salteena cheered up when he beheld the wedding cake and sparkling\r\nwines. Then the earl got up and made a very fine speech about marrage\r\nvows and bliss and he quoted several good bits from the bible which\r\ngot a lot of applause. Bernard replied in good round terms. I thank\r\nyour lordship for those kind remarks he said in clear tones I expect\r\nwe shall be as happy as a lark and I hope you will all be ditto some\r\nday. Here Here muttered a stray lady in the crowd and down sat Bernard\r\nwhile Ethel went up to change her wedding garment for a choice pink\r\nvelvit dress with a golden gurdle and a very chick tocque. Bernard\r\n[Pg 101] also put on a new suit of blue stripe and some silk socks and\r\nclean under clothing. Hurah hurah shouted the guests as the pair\r\nreappeard in the aforesaid get ups. Then everybody got a bag of rice and\r\nsprinkled on the pair and Mr Salteena sadly threw a white tennis shoe\r\nat them wiping his eyes the while. Off drove the happy pair and the\r\nguests finished up the food. The happy pair went to Egypt for there\r\nHonymoon as they thought it would be a nice warm spot and they had\r\nnever seen the wondrous land. Ethel was a bit sick on the boat but\r\nBernard braved the storm in manly style. However Ethel had recovered\r\nby the time they got to Egypt and here we will leave them for a merry\r\nsix weeks of bliss while we return to England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg 102]\r\nCHAPTER 12\r\n\r\nHOW IT ENDED\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Salteena by the aid of the earl and the kindness of the Prince of\r\nWales managed to get the job his soul craved and any day might be seen\r\nin Hyde park or Pickadilly galloping madly after the Royal Carrage in\r\na smart suit of green velvit with knickerbockers compleat. At first he\r\nwas rarther terrified as he was not used to riding and he found his\r\nhorse bumped him a good deal and he had to cling on desperatly to its\r\nflowing main. At other times the horse would stop dead and Mr Salteena\r\nwould use his spurs and bad languige with no avail. But he soon got\r\nmore used to his fresh and sultry steed and His Royal Highness seemed\r\nsatisfide.\r\n\r\nThe Earl continued his merry life at the [Pg 103] Compartments till\r\nfinally he fell in love with one of the noble ladies who haunted them.\r\nShe was not so pretty as Ethel as she had rarther a bulgy figure and\r\nbrown eyes but she had lovely raven tresses a pointed nose and a rose\r\nlike complexion of a dainty hue. She had very nice feet and plenty of\r\nmoney. Her name was called Lady Helena Herring and her age was 25 and\r\nshe mated well with the earl.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena grew very lonely after the earl was marrid and he could\r\nnot bear a single life any more so failing Ethel he marrid one of the\r\nmaids in waiting at Buckingham palace by name Bessie Topp a plesant\r\ngirl of 18 with a round red face and rarther stary eyes.\r\n\r\nSo now that all our friends are marrid I will add a few words about\r\ntheir familys. Ethel and Bernard returned from their Honymoon with a\r\nson and hair a nice fat baby called Ignatius Bernard. They soon [Pg 104]\r\nhad six more children four boys and three girls and some of them were\r\ntwins which was very exciting.\r\n\r\nThe Earl only got two rarther sickly girls called Helen and Marie\r\nbecause the last one looked slightly french.\r\n\r\nMr Salteena had a large family of 10 five of each but he grew very\r\nmorose as the years rolled by and his little cottage was very noisy\r\nand his wife was a bit annoying at times especially when he took to\r\ndreaming of Ethel and wishing he could have marrid her. Still he was a\r\npius man in his way and found relief in prayer.\r\n\r\nBernard Clark was the happiest of our friends as he loved Ethel to the\r\nbitter end and so did she him and they had a nice house too.\r\n\r\nThe Earl soon got tired of his sickly daughters and his wife had a\r\nsavage temper so he thourght he would divorce her and try again but he\r\ngave up the idear after [Pg 105] several attempts and decided to offer\r\nit up as a Mortification.\r\n\r\nSo now my readers we will say farewell to the characters in this book.\r\n\r\n                                 The End\r\n\r\n                             by Daisy Ashford\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Young Visiters or, Mr. Salteena\'s\r\nPlan, by Daisy Ashford\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK YOUNG VISITERS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 21415-8.txt or 21415-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/4/1/21415/\r\n\r\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, David T.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
