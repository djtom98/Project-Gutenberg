It is not for such these crude narrations\r\nappear. Deserted by kindred, disabled by failing health, I am forced to\r\nsome experiment which shall aid me in maintaining myself and child\r\nwithout extinguishing this feeble life. I would not from these motives\r\neven palliate slavery at the South, by disclosures of its appurtenances\r\nNorth. My mistress was wholly imbued with SOUTHERN principles. I do not\r\npretend to divulge every transaction in my own life, which the\r\nunprejudiced would declare unfavorable in comparison with treatment of\r\nlegal bondmen; I have purposely omitted what would most provoke shame in\r\nour good anti-slavery friends at home.\r\n\r\nMy humble position and frank confession of errors will, I hope, shield\r\nme from severe criticism. Indeed, defects are so apparent it requires no\r\nskilful hand to expose them.\r\n\r\nI sincerely appeal to my colored brethren universally for patronage,\r\nhoping they will not condemn this attempt of their sister to be erudite,\r\nbut rally around me a faithful band of supporters and defenders.\r\n\r\nH. E. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR NIG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMAG SMITH, MY MOTHER.\r\n\r\n    Oh, Grief beyond all other griefs, when fate\r\n    First leaves the young heart lone and desolate\r\n    In the wide world, without that only tie\r\n    For which it loved to live or feared to die;\r\n    Lorn as the hung-up lute, that ne\'er hath spoken\r\n    Since the sad day its master-chord was broken!\r\n\r\n    MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONELY MAG SMITH! See her as she walks with downcast eyes and heavy\r\nheart. It was not always thus. She HAD a loving, trusting heart. Early\r\ndeprived of parental guardianship, far removed from relatives, she was\r\nleft to guide her tiny boat over life\'s surges alone and inexperienced.\r\nAs she merged into womanhood, unprotected, uncherished, uncared for,\r\nthere fell on her ear the music of love, awakening an intensity of\r\nemotion long dormant. It whispered of an elevation before unaspired to;\r\nof ease and plenty her simple heart had never dreamed of as hers. She\r\nknew the voice of her charmer, so ravishing, sounded far above her. It\r\nseemed like an angel\'s, alluring her upward and onward. She thought she\r\ncould ascend to him and become an equal. She surrendered to him a\r\npriceless gem, which he proudly garnered as a trophy, with those of\r\nother victims, and left her to her fate. The world seemed full of\r\nhateful deceivers and crushing arrogance. Conscious that the great bond\r\nof union to her former companions was severed, that the disdain of\r\nothers would be insupportable, she determined to leave the few friends\r\nshe possessed, and seek an asylum among strangers. Her offspring came\r\nunwelcomed, and before its nativity numbered weeks, it passed from\r\nearth, ascending to a purer and better life.\r\n\r\n"God be thanked," ejaculated Mag, as she saw its breathing cease; "no\r\none can taunt HER with my ruin."\r\n\r\nBlessed release! may we all respond. How many pure, innocent children\r\nnot only inherit a wicked heart of their own, claiming life-long\r\nscrutiny and restraint, but are heirs also of parental disgrace and\r\ncalumny, from which only long years of patient endurance in paths of\r\nrectitude can disencumber them.\r\n\r\nMag\'s new home was soon contaminated by the publicity of her fall; she\r\nhad a feeling of degradation oppressing her; but she resolved to be\r\ncircumspect, and try to regain in a measure what she had lost. Then some\r\nfoul tongue would jest of her shame, and averted looks and cold\r\ngreetings disheartened her. She saw she could not bury in forgetfulness\r\nher misdeed, so she resolved to leave her home and seek another in the\r\nplace she at first fled from.\r\n\r\nAlas, how fearful are we to be first in extending a helping hand to\r\nthose who stagger in the mires of infamy; to speak the first words of\r\nhope and warning to those emerging into the sunlight of morality! Who\r\ncan tell what numbers, advancing just far enough to hear a cold welcome\r\nand join in the reserved converse of professed reformers, disappointed,\r\ndisheartened, have chosen to dwell in unclean places, rather than\r\nencounter these "holier-than-thou" of the great brotherhood of man!\r\n\r\nSuch was Mag\'s experience; and disdaining to ask favor or friendship\r\nfrom a sneering world, she resolved to shut herself up in a hovel she\r\nhad often passed in better days, and which she knew to be untenanted.\r\nShe vowed to ask no favors of familiar faces; to die neglected and\r\nforgotten before she would be dependent on any. Removed from the\r\nvillage, she was seldom seen except as upon your introduction, gentle\r\nreader, with downcast visage, returning her work to her employer, and\r\nthus providing herself with the means of subsistence. In two years many\r\nhands craved the same avocation; foreigners who cheapened toil and\r\nclamored for a livelihood, competed with her, and she could not thus\r\nsustain herself. She was now above no drudgery. Occasionally old\r\nacquaintances called to be favored with help of some kind, which she was\r\nglad to bestow for the sake of the money it would bring her; but the\r\nassociation with them was such a painful reminder of by-gones, she\r\nreturned to her hut morose and revengeful, refusing all offers of a\r\nbetter home than she possessed. Thus she lived for years, hugging her\r\nwrongs, but making no effort to escape. She had never known plenty,\r\nscarcely competency; but the present was beyond comparison with those\r\ninnocent years when the coronet of virtue was hers.\r\n\r\nEvery year her melancholy increased, her means diminished. At last no\r\none seemed to notice her, save a kind-hearted African, who often called\r\nto inquire after her health and to see if she needed any fuel, he having\r\nthe responsibility of furnishing that article, and she in return mending\r\nor making garments.\r\n\r\n"How much you earn dis week, Mag?" asked he one Saturday evening.\r\n\r\n"Little enough, Jim. Two or three days without any dinner. I washed for\r\nthe Reeds, and did a small job for Mrs. Bellmont; that\'s all. I shall\r\nstarve soon, unless I can get more to do. Folks seem as afraid to come\r\nhere as if they expected to get some awful disease. I don\'t believe\r\nthere is a person in the world but would be glad to have me dead and out\r\nof the way."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Mag! don\'t talk so. You shan\'t starve so long as I have barrels\r\nto hoop. Peter Greene boards me cheap. I\'ll help you, if nobody else\r\nwill."\r\n\r\nA tear stood in Mag\'s faded eye. "I\'m glad," she said, with a softer\r\ntone than before, "if there is ONE who isn\'t glad to see me suffer. I\r\nb\'lieve all Singleton wants to see me punished, and feel as if they\r\ncould tell when I\'ve been punished long enough. It\'s a long day ahead\r\nthey\'ll set it, I reckon."\r\n\r\nAfter the usual supply of fuel was prepared, Jim returned home. Full of\r\npity for Mag, he set about devising measures for her relief. "By golly!"\r\nsaid he to himself one day--for he had become so absorbed in Mag\'s\r\ninterest that he had fallen into a habit of musing aloud--"By golly! I\r\nwish she\'d MARRY me."\r\n\r\n"Who?" shouted Pete Greene, suddenly starting from an unobserved corner\r\nof the rude shop.\r\n\r\n"Where you come from, you sly nigger!" exclaimed Jim.\r\n\r\n"Come, tell me, who is\'t?" said Pete; "Mag Smith, you want to marry?"\r\n\r\n"Git out, Pete! and when you come in dis shop again, let a nigger know\r\nit. Don\'t steal in like a thief."\r\n\r\nPity and love know little severance. One attends the other. Jim\r\nacknowledged the presence of the former, and his efforts in Mag\'s behalf\r\ntold also of a finer principle.\r\n\r\nThis sudden expedient which he had unintentionally disclosed, roused his\r\nthinking and inventive powers to study upon the best method of\r\nintroducing the subject to Mag.\r\n\r\nHe belted his barrels, with many a scheme revolving in his mind, none of\r\nwhich quite satisfied him, or seemed, on the whole, expedient. He\r\nthought of the pleasing contrast between her fair face and his own dark\r\nskin; the smooth, straight hair, which he had once, in expression of\r\npity, kindly stroked on her now wrinkled but once fair brow. There was a\r\ntempest gathering in his heart, and at last, to ease his pent-up\r\npassion, he exclaimed aloud, "By golly!" Recollecting his former\r\nexposure, he glanced around to see if Pete was in hearing again.\r\nSatisfied on this point, he continued: "She\'d be as much of a prize to\r\nme as she\'d fall short of coming up to the mark with white folks. I\r\ndon\'t care for past things. I\'ve done things \'fore now I\'s \'shamed of.\r\nShe\'s good enough for me, any how."\r\n\r\nOne more glance about the premises to be sure Pete was away.\r\n\r\nThe next Saturday night brought Jim to the hovel again. The cold was\r\nfast coming to tarry its apportioned time. Mag was nearly despairing of\r\nmeeting its rigor.\r\n\r\n"How\'s the wood, Mag?" asked Jim.\r\n\r\n"All gone; and no more to cut, any how," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"Too bad!" Jim said. His truthful reply would have been, I\'m glad.\r\n\r\n"Anything to eat in the house?" continued he.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Mag.\r\n\r\n"Too bad!" again, orally, with the same INWARD gratulation as before.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mag," said Jim, after a short pause, "you\'s down low enough. I\r\ndon\'t see but I\'ve got to take care of ye. \'Sposin\' we marry!"\r\n\r\nMag raised her eyes, full of amazement, and uttered a sonorous "What?"\r\n\r\nJim felt abashed for a moment. He knew well what were her objections.\r\n\r\n"You\'s had trial of white folks any how. They run off and left ye, and\r\nnow none of \'em come near ye to see if you\'s dead or alive. I\'s black\r\noutside, I know, but I\'s got a white heart inside. Which you rather\r\nhave, a black heart in a white skin, or a white heart in a black one?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear!" sighed Mag; "Nobody on earth cares for ME--"\r\n\r\n"I do," interrupted Jim.\r\n\r\n"I can do but two things," said she, "beg my living, or get it from\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Take me, Mag. I can give you a better home than this, and not let you\r\nsuffer so."\r\n\r\nHe prevailed; they married. You can philosophize, gentle reader, upon\r\nthe impropriety of such unions, and preach dozens of sermons on the\r\nevils of amalgamation. Want is a more powerful philosopher and preacher.\r\nPoor Mag. She has sundered another bond which held her to her fellows.\r\nShe has descended another step down the ladder of infamy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMY FATHER\'S DEATH.\r\n\r\n    Misery! we have known each other,\r\n    Like a sister and a brother,\r\n    Living in the same lone home\r\n    Many years--we must live some\r\n    Hours or ages yet to come.\r\n\r\n    SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJIM, proud of his treasure,--a white wife,--tried hard to fulfil his\r\npromises; and furnished her with a more comfortable dwelling, diet, and\r\napparel. It was comparatively a comfortable winter she passed after her\r\nmarriage. When Jim could work, all went on well. Industrious, and fond\r\nof Mag, he was determined she should not regret her union to him. Time\r\nlevied an additional charge upon him, in the form of two pretty\r\nmulattos, whose infantile pranks amply repaid the additional toil. A few\r\nyears, and a severe cough and pain in his side compelled him to be an\r\nidler for weeks together, and Mag had thus a reminder of by-gones. She\r\ncared for him only as a means to subserve her own comfort; yet she\r\nnursed him faithfully and true to marriage vows till death released her.\r\nHe became the victim of consumption. He loved Mag to the last. So long\r\nas life continued, he stifled his sensibility to pain, and toiled for\r\nher sustenance long after he was able to do so.\r\n\r\nA few expressive wishes for her welfare; a hope of better days for her;\r\nan anxiety lest they should not all go to the "good place;" brief advice\r\nabout their children; a hope expressed that Mag would not be neglected\r\nas she used to be; the manifestation of Christian patience; these were\r\nALL the legacy of miserable Mag. A feeling of cold desolation came over\r\nher, as she turned from the grave of one who had been truly faithful to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe was now expelled from companionship with white people; this last\r\nstep--her union with a black--was the climax of repulsion.\r\n\r\nSeth Shipley, a partner in Jim\'s business, wished her to remain in her\r\npresent home; but she declined, and returned to her hovel again, with\r\nobstacles threefold more insurmountable than before. Seth accompanied\r\nher, giving her a weekly allowance which furnished most of the food\r\nnecessary for the four inmates. After a time, work failed; their means\r\nwere reduced.\r\n\r\nHow Mag toiled and suffered, yielding to fits of desperation, bursts of\r\nanger, and uttering curses too fearful to repeat. When both were\r\nsupplied with work, they prospered; if idle, they were hungry together.\r\nIn this way their interests became united; they planned for the future\r\ntogether. Mag had lived an outcast for years. She had ceased to feel the\r\ngushings of penitence; she had crushed the sharp agonies of an awakened\r\nconscience. She had no longings for a purer heart, a better life. Far\r\neasier to descend lower. She entered the darkness of perpetual infamy.\r\nShe asked not the rite of civilization or Christianity. Her will made\r\nher the wife of Seth. Soon followed scenes familiar and trying.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no use," said Seth one day; "we must give the children away, and\r\ntry to get work in some other place."\r\n\r\n"Who\'ll take the black devils?" snarled Mag.\r\n\r\n"They\'re none of mine," said Seth; "what you growling about?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody will want any thing of mine, or yours either," she replied.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll make \'em, p\'r\'aps," he said. "There\'s Frado\'s six years old, and\r\npretty, if she is yours, and white folks\'ll say so. She\'d be a prize\r\nsomewhere," he continued, tipping his chair back against the wall, and\r\nplacing his feet upon the rounds, as if he had much more to say when in\r\nthe right position.\r\n\r\nFrado, as they called one of Mag\'s children, was a beautiful mulatto,\r\nwith long, curly black hair, and handsome, roguish eyes, sparkling with\r\nan exuberance of spirit almost beyond restraint.\r\n\r\nHearing her name mentioned, she looked up from her play, to see what\r\nSeth had to say of her.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t the Bellmonts take her?" asked Seth.\r\n\r\n"Bellmonts?" shouted Mag. "His wife is a right she-devil! and if--"\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t they better be all together?" interrupted Seth, reminding her of\r\na like epithet used in reference to her little ones.\r\n\r\nWithout seeming to notice him, she continued, "She can\'t keep a girl in\r\nthe house over a week; and Mr. Bellmont wants to hire a boy to work for\r\nhim, but he can\'t find one that will live in the house with her; she\'s\r\nso ugly, they can\'t."\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ve got to make a move soon," answered Seth; "if you go with\r\nme, we shall go right off. Had you rather spare the other one?" asked\r\nSeth, after a short pause.\r\n\r\n"One\'s as bad as t\'other," replied Mag. "Frado is such a wild, frolicky\r\nthing, and means to do jest as she\'s a mind to; she won\'t go if she\r\ndon\'t want to. I don\'t want to tell her she is to be given away."\r\n\r\n"I will," said Seth. "Come here, Frado?"\r\n\r\nThe child seemed to have some dim foreshadowing of evil, and declined.\r\n\r\n"Come here," he continued; "I want to tell you something."\r\n\r\nShe came reluctantly. He took her hand and said: "We\'re going to move,\r\nby-\'m-bye; will you go?"\r\n\r\n"No!" screamed she; and giving a sudden jerk which destroyed Seth\'s\r\nequilibrium, left him sprawling on the floor, while she escaped through\r\nthe open door.\r\n\r\n"She\'s a hard one," said Seth, brushing his patched coat sleeve. "I\'d\r\nrisk her at Bellmont\'s."\r\n\r\nThey discussed the expediency of a speedy departure. Seth would first\r\nseek employment, and then return for Mag. They would take with them what\r\nthey could carry, and leave the rest with Pete Greene, and come for them\r\nwhen they were wanted. They were long in arranging affairs\r\nsatisfactorily, and were not a little startled at the close of their\r\nconference to find Frado missing. They thought approaching night would\r\nbring her. Twilight passed into darkness, and she did not come. They\r\nthought she had understood their plans, and had, perhaps, permanently\r\nwithdrawn. They could not rest without making some effort to ascertain\r\nher retreat. Seth went in pursuit, and returned without her. They\r\nrallied others when they discovered that another little colored girl was\r\nmissing, a favorite playmate of Frado\'s. All effort proved unavailing.\r\nMag felt sure her fears were realized, and that she might never see her\r\nagain. Before her anxieties became realities, both were safely returned,\r\nand from them and their attendant they learned that they went to walk,\r\nand not minding the direction soon found themselves lost. They had\r\nclimbed fences and walls, passed through thickets and marshes, and when\r\nnight approached selected a thick cluster of shrubbery as a covert for\r\nthe night. They were discovered by the person who now restored them,\r\nchatting of their prospects, Frado attempting to banish the childish\r\nfears of her companion. As they were some miles from home, they were\r\nkindly cared for until morning. Mag was relieved to know her child was\r\nnot driven to desperation by their intentions to relieve themselves of\r\nher, and she was inclined to think severe restraint would be healthful.\r\n\r\nThe removal was all arranged; the few days necessary for such migrations\r\npassed quickly, and one bright summer morning they bade farewell to\r\ntheir Singleton hovel, and with budgets and bundles commenced their\r\nweary march. As they neared the village, they heard the merry shouts of\r\nchildren gathered around the school-room, awaiting the coming of their\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\n"Halloo!" screamed one, "Black, white and yeller!" "Black, white and\r\nyeller," echoed a dozen voices.\r\n\r\nIt did not grate so harshly on poor Mag as once it would. She did not\r\neven turn her head to look at them. She had passed into an insensibility\r\nno childish taunt could penetrate, else she would have reproached\r\nherself as she passed familiar scenes, for extending the separation once\r\nso easily annihilated by steadfast integrity. Two miles beyond lived the\r\nBellmonts, in a large, old fashioned, two-story white house, environed\r\nby fruitful acres, and embellished by shrubbery and shade trees. Years\r\nago a youthful couple consecrated it as home; and after many little feet\r\nhad worn paths to favorite fruit trees, and over its green hills, and\r\nmingled at last with brother man in the race which belongs neither to\r\nthe swift or strong, the sire became grey-haired and decrepit, and went\r\nto his last repose. His aged consort soon followed him. The old\r\nhomestead thus passed into the hands of a son, to whose wife Mag had\r\napplied the epithet "she-devil," as may be remembered. John, the son,\r\nhad not in his family arrangements departed from the example of the\r\nfather. The pastimes of his boyhood were ever freshly revived by\r\nwitnessing the games of his own sons as they rallied about the same goal\r\nhis youthful feet had often won; as well as by the amusements of his\r\ndaughters in their imitations of maternal duties.\r\n\r\nAt the time we introduce them, however, John is wearing the badge of\r\nage. Most of his children were from home; some seeking employment; some\r\nwere already settled in homes of their own. A maiden sister shared with\r\nhim the estate on which he resided, and occupied a portion of the house.\r\n\r\nWithin sight of the house, Seth seated himself with his bundles and the\r\nchild he had been leading, while Mag walked onward to the house leading\r\nFrado. A knock at the door brought Mrs. Bellmont, and Mag asked if she\r\nwould be willing to let that child stop there while she went to the\r\nReed\'s house to wash, and when she came back she would call and get her.\r\nIt seemed a novel request, but she consented. Why the impetuous child\r\nentered the house, we cannot tell; the door closed, and Mag hastily\r\ndeparted. Frado waited for the close of day, which was to bring back her\r\nmother. Alas! it never came. It was the last time she ever saw or heard\r\nof her mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA NEW HOME FOR ME.\r\n\r\n    Oh! did we but know of the shadows so nigh,\r\n    The world would indeed be a prison of gloom;\r\n    All light would be quenched in youth\'s eloquent eye,\r\n    And the prayer-lisping infant would ask for the tomb.\r\n\r\n    For if Hope be a star that may lead us astray,\r\n    And "deceiveth the heart," as the aged ones preach;\r\n    Yet \'twas Mercy that gave it, to beacon our way,\r\n    Though its halo illumes where it never can reach.\r\n\r\n    ELIZA COOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the day closed and Mag did not appear, surmises were expressed by the\r\nfamily that she never intended to return. Mr. Bellmont was a kind,\r\nhumane man, who would not grudge hospitality to the poorest wanderer,\r\nnor fail to sympathize with any sufferer, however humble. The child\'s\r\ndesertion by her mother appealed to his sympathy, and he felt inclined\r\nto succor her. To do this in opposition to Mrs. Bellmont\'s wishes, would\r\nbe like encountering a whirlwind charged with fire, daggers and spikes.\r\nShe was not as susceptible of fine emotions as her spouse. Mag\'s opinion\r\nof her was not without foundation. She was self-willed, haughty,\r\nundisciplined, arbitrary and severe. In common parlance, she was a\r\nSCOLD, a thorough one. Mr. B. remained silent during the consultation\r\nwhich follows, engaged in by mother, Mary and John, or Jack, as he was\r\nfamiliarly called.\r\n\r\n"Send her to the County House," said Mary, in reply to the query what\r\nshould be done with her, in a tone which indicated self-importance in\r\nthe speaker. She was indeed the idol of her mother, and more nearly\r\nresembled her in disposition and manners than the others.\r\n\r\nJane, an invalid daughter, the eldest of those at home, was reclining on\r\na sofa apparently uninterested.\r\n\r\n"Keep her," said Jack. "She\'s real handsome and bright, and not very\r\nblack, either."\r\n\r\n"Yes," rejoined Mary; "that\'s just like you, Jack. She\'ll be of no use\r\nat all these three years, right under foot all the time."\r\n\r\n"Poh! Miss Mary; if she should stay, it wouldn\'t be two days before you\r\nwould be telling the girls about OUR nig, OUR nig!" retorted Jack.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want a nigger \'round ME, do you, mother?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind the nigger in the child. I should like a dozen better than\r\none," replied her mother. "If I could make her do my work in a few\r\nyears, I would keep her. I have so much trouble with girls I hire, I am\r\nalmost persuaded if I have one to train up in my way from a child, I\r\nshall be able to keep them awhile. I am tired of changing every few\r\nmonths."\r\n\r\n"Where could she sleep?" asked Mary. "I don\'t want her near me."\r\n\r\n"In the L chamber," answered the mother.\r\n\r\n"How\'ll she get there?" asked Jack. "She\'ll be afraid to go through that\r\ndark passage, and she can\'t climb the ladder safely."\r\n\r\n"She\'ll have to go there; it\'s good enough for a nigger," was the reply.\r\n\r\nJack was sent on horseback to ascertain if Mag was at her home. He\r\nreturned with the testimony of Pete Greene that they were fairly\r\ndeparted, and that the child was intentionally thrust upon their family.\r\n\r\nThe imposition was not at all relished by Mrs. B., or the pert, haughty\r\nMary, who had just glided into her teens.\r\n\r\n"Show the child to bed, Jack," said his mother. "You seem most pleased\r\nwith the little nigger, so you may introduce her to her room."\r\n\r\nHe went to the kitchen, and, taking Frado gently by the hand, told her\r\nhe would put her in bed now; perhaps her mother would come the next\r\nnight after her.\r\n\r\nIt was not yet quite dark, so they ascended the stairs without any\r\nlight, passing through nicely furnished rooms, which were a source of\r\ngreat amazement to the child. He opened the door which connected with\r\nher room by a dark, unfinished passage-way. "Don\'t bump your head," said\r\nJack, and stepped before to open the door leading into her\r\napartment,--an unfinished chamber over the kitchen, the roof slanting\r\nnearly to the floor, so that the bed could stand only in the middle of\r\nthe room. A small half window furnished light and air. Jack returned to\r\nthe sitting room with the remark that the child would soon outgrow those\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n"When she DOES, she\'ll outgrow the house," remarked the mother.\r\n\r\n"What can she do to help you?" asked Mary. "She came just in the right\r\ntime, didn\'t she? Just the very day after Bridget left," continued she.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see what she can do in the morning," was the answer.\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation was passing below, Frado lay, revolving in her\r\nlittle mind whether she would remain or not until her mother\'s return.\r\nShe was of wilful, determined nature, a stranger to fear, and would not\r\nhesitate to wander away should she decide to. She remembered the\r\nconversation of her mother with Seth, the words "given away" which she\r\nheard used in reference to herself; and though she did not know their\r\nfull import, she thought she should, by remaining, be in some relation\r\nto white people she was never favored with before. So she resolved to\r\ntarry, with the hope that mother would come and get her some time. The\r\nhot sun had penetrated her room, and it was long before a cooling breeze\r\nreduced the temperature so that she could sleep.\r\n\r\nFrado was called early in the morning by her new mistress. Her first\r\nwork was to feed the hens. She was shown how it was ALWAYS to be done,\r\nand in no other way; any departure from this rule to be punished by a\r\nwhipping. She was then accompanied by Jack to drive the cows to pasture,\r\nso she might learn the way. Upon her return she was allowed to eat her\r\nbreakfast, consisting of a bowl of skimmed milk, with brown bread\r\ncrusts, which she was told to eat, standing, by the kitchen table, and\r\nmust not be over ten minutes about it. Meanwhile the family were taking\r\ntheir morning meal in the dining-room. This over, she was placed on a\r\ncricket to wash the common dishes; she was to be in waiting always to\r\nbring wood and chips, to run hither and thither from room to room.\r\n\r\nA large amount of dish-washing for small hands followed dinner. Then the\r\nsame after tea and going after the cows finished her first day\'s work.\r\nIt was a new discipline to the child. She found some attractions about\r\nthe place, and she retired to rest at night more willing to remain. The\r\nsame routine followed day after day, with slight variation; adding a\r\nlittle more work, and spicing the toil with "words that burn," and\r\nfrequent blows on her head. These were great annoyances to Frado, and\r\nhad she known where her mother was, she would have gone at once to her.\r\nShe was often greatly wearied, and silently wept over her sad fate. At\r\nfirst she wept aloud, which Mrs. Bellmont noticed by applying a\r\nraw-hide, always at hand in the kitchen. It was a symptom of discontent\r\nand complaining which must be "nipped in the bud," she said.\r\n\r\nThus passed a year. No intelligence of Mag. It was now certain Frado was\r\nto become a permanent member of the family. Her labors were multiplied;\r\nshe was quite indispensable, although but seven years old. She had never\r\nlearned to read, never heard of a school until her residence in the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bellmont was in doubt about the utility of attempting to educate\r\npeople of color, who were incapable of elevation. This subject\r\noccasioned a lengthy discussion in the family. Mr. Bellmont, Jane and\r\nJack arguing for Frado\'s education; Mary and her mother objecting. At\r\nlast Mr. Bellmont declared decisively that she SHOULD go to school. He\r\nwas a man who seldom decided controversies at home. The word once spoken\r\nadmitted of no appeal; so, notwithstanding Mary\'s objection that she\r\nwould have to attend the same school she did, the word became law.\r\n\r\nIt was to be a new scene to Frado, and Jack had many queries and\r\nconjectures to answer. He was himself too far advanced to attend the\r\nsummer school, which Frado regretted, having had too many opportunities\r\nof witnessing Miss Mary\'s temper to feel safe in her company alone.\r\n\r\nThe opening day of school came. Frado sauntered on far in the rear of\r\nMary, who was ashamed to be seen "walking with a nigger." As soon as she\r\nappeared, with scanty clothing and bared feet, the children assembled,\r\nnoisily published her approach: "See that nigger," shouted one. "Look!\r\nlook!" cried another. "I won\'t play with her," said one little girl.\r\n"Nor I neither," replied another.\r\n\r\nMary evidently relished these sharp attacks, and saw a fair prospect of\r\nlowering Nig where, according to her views, she belonged. Poor Frado,\r\nchagrined and grieved, felt that her anticipations of pleasure at such a\r\nplace were far from being realized. She was just deciding to return\r\nhome, and never come there again, when the teacher appeared, and\r\nobserving the downcast looks of the child, took her by the hand, and led\r\nher into the school-room. All followed, and, after the bustle of\r\nsecuring seats was over, Miss Marsh inquired if the children knew "any\r\ncause for the sorrow of that little girl?" pointing to Frado. It was\r\nsoon all told. She then reminded them of their duties to the poor and\r\nfriendless; their cowardice in attacking a young innocent child;\r\nreferred them to one who looks not on outward appearances, but on the\r\nheart. "She looks like a good girl; I think _I_ shall love her, so lay\r\naside all prejudice, and vie with each other in shewing kindness and\r\ngood-will to one who seems different from you," were the closing remarks\r\nof the kind lady. Those kind words! The most agreeable sound which ever\r\nmeets the ear of sorrowing, grieving childhood.\r\n\r\nExample rendered her words efficacious. Day by day there was a manifest\r\nchange of deportment towards "Nig." Her speeches often drew merriment\r\nfrom the children; no one could do more to enliven their favorite\r\npastimes than Frado. Mary could not endure to see her thus noticed, yet\r\nknew not how to prevent it. She could not influence her schoolmates as\r\nshe wished. She had not gained their affections by winning ways and\r\nyielding points of controversy. On the contrary, she was self-willed,\r\ndomineering; every day reported "mad" by some of her companions. She\r\navailed herself of the only alternative, abuse and taunts, as they\r\nreturned from school. This was not satisfactory; she wanted to use\r\nphysical force "to subdue her," to "keep her down."\r\n\r\nThere was, on their way home, a field intersected by a stream over which\r\na single plank was placed for a crossing. It occurred to Mary that it\r\nwould be a punishment to Nig to compel her to cross over; so she dragged\r\nher to the edge, and told her authoritatively to go over. Nig hesitated,\r\nresisted. Mary placed herself behind the child, and, in the struggle to\r\nforce her over, lost her footing and plunged into the stream. Some of\r\nthe larger scholars being in sight, ran, and thus prevented Mary from\r\ndrowning and Frado from falling. Nig scampered home fast as possible,\r\nand Mary went to the nearest house, dripping, to procure a change of\r\ngarments. She came loitering home, half crying, exclaiming, "Nig pushed\r\nme into the stream!" She then related the particulars. Nig was called\r\nfrom the kitchen. Mary stood with anger flashing in her eyes. Mr.\r\nBellmont sat quietly reading his paper. He had witnessed too many of\r\nMiss Mary\'s outbreaks to be startled. Mrs. Bellmont interrogated Nig.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t do it! I didn\'t do it!" answered Nig, passionately, and then\r\nrelated the occurrence truthfully.\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy greatly enraged Mrs. Bellmont. With loud accusations and\r\nangry gestures she approached the child. Turning to her husband, she\r\nasked,\r\n\r\n"Will you sit still, there, and hear that black nigger call Mary a\r\nliar?"\r\n\r\n"How do we know but she has told the truth? I shall not punish her," he\r\nreplied, and left the house, as he usually did when a tempest threatened\r\nto envelop him. No sooner was he out of sight than Mrs. B. and Mary\r\ncommenced beating her inhumanly; then propping her mouth open with a\r\npiece of wood, shut her up in a dark room, without any supper. For\r\nemployment, while the tempest raged within, Mr. Bellmont went for the\r\ncows, a task belonging to Frado, and thus unintentionally prolonged her\r\npain. At dark Jack came in, and seeing Mary, accosted her with, "So you\r\nthought you\'d vent your spite on Nig, did you? Why can\'t you let her\r\nalone? It was good enough for you to get a ducking, only you did not\r\nstay in half long enough."\r\n\r\n"Stop!" said his mother. "You shall never talk so before me. You would\r\nhave that little nigger trample on Mary, would you? She came home with a\r\nlie; it made Mary\'s story false."\r\n\r\n"What was Mary\'s story?" asked Jack.\r\n\r\nIt was related.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Jack, sallying into a chair, "the school-children happened\r\nto see it all, and they tell the same story Nig does. Which is most\r\nlikely to be true, what a dozen agree they saw, or the contrary?"\r\n\r\n"It is very strange you will believe what others say against your\r\nsister," retorted his mother, with flashing eye. "I think it is time\r\nyour father subdued you."\r\n\r\n"Father is a sensible man," argued Jack. "He would not wrong a dog.\r\nWhere IS Frado?" he continued.\r\n\r\n"Mother gave her a good whipping and shut her up," replied Mary.\r\n\r\nJust then Mr. Bellmont entered, and asked if Frado was "shut up yet."\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of her innocence, the perfidy of his sister, worked\r\nfearfully on Jack. He bounded from his chair, searched every room till\r\nhe found the child; her mouth wedged apart, her face swollen, and full\r\nof pain.\r\n\r\nHow Jack pitied her! He relieved her jaws, brought her some supper, took\r\nher to her room, comforted her as well as he knew how, sat by her till\r\nshe fell asleep, and then left for the sitting room. As he passed his\r\nmother, he remarked, "If that was the way Frado was to be treated, he\r\nhoped she would never wake again!" He then imparted her situation to his\r\nfather, who seemed untouched, till a glance at Jack exposed a tearful\r\neye. Jack went early to her next morning. She awoke sad, but refreshed.\r\nAfter breakfast Jack took her with him to the field, and kept her\r\nthrough the day. But it could not be so generally. She must return to\r\nschool, to her household duties. He resolved to do what he could to\r\nprotect her from Mary and his mother. He bought her a dog, which became\r\na great favorite with both. The invalid, Jane, would gladly befriend\r\nher; but she had not the strength to brave the iron will of her mother.\r\nKind words and affectionate glances were the only expressions of\r\nsympathy she could safely indulge in. The men employed on the farm were\r\nalways glad to hear her prattle; she was a great favorite with them.\r\nMrs. Bellmont allowed them the privilege of talking with her in the\r\nkitchen. She did not fear but she should have ample opportunity of\r\nsubduing her when they were away. Three months of schooling, summer and\r\nwinter, she enjoyed for three years. Her winter over-dress was a\r\ncast-off overcoat, once worn by Jack, and a sun-bonnet. It was a source\r\nof great merriment to the scholars, but Nig\'s retorts were so mirthful,\r\nand their satisfaction so evident in attributing the selection to "Old\r\nGranny Bellmont," that it was not painful to Nig or pleasurable to Mary.\r\nHer jollity was not to be quenched by whipping or scolding. In Mrs.\r\nBellmont\'s presence she was under restraint; but in the kitchen, and\r\namong her schoolmates, the pent up fires burst forth. She was ever at\r\nsome sly prank when unseen by her teacher, in school hours; not\r\nunfrequently some outburst of merriment, of which she was the original,\r\nwas charged upon some innocent mate, and punishment inflicted which she\r\nmerited. They enjoyed her antics so fully that any of them would suffer\r\nwrongfully to keep open the avenues of mirth. She would venture far\r\nbeyond propriety, thus shielded and countenanced.\r\n\r\nThe teacher\'s desk was supplied with drawers, in which were stored his\r\nbooks and other et ceteras of the profession. The children observed Nig\r\nvery busy there one morning before school, as they flitted in\r\noccasionally from their play outside. The master came; called the\r\nchildren to order; opened a drawer to take the book the occasion\r\nrequired; when out poured a volume of smoke. "Fire! fire!" screamed he,\r\nat the top of his voice. By this time he had become sufficiently\r\nacquainted with the peculiar odor, to know he was imposed upon. The\r\nscholars shouted with laughter to see the terror of the dupe, who,\r\nfeeling abashed at the needless fright, made no very strict\r\ninvestigation, and Nig once more escaped punishment. She had provided\r\nherself with cigars, and puffing, puffing away at the crack of the\r\ndrawer, had filled it with smoke, and then closed it tightly to deceive\r\nthe teacher, and amuse the scholars. The interim of terms was filled up\r\nwith a variety of duties new and peculiar. At home, no matter how\r\npowerful the heat when sent to rake hay or guard the grazing herd, she\r\nwas never permitted to shield her skin from the sun. She was not many\r\nshades darker than Mary now; what a calamity it would be ever to hear\r\nthe contrast spoken of. Mrs. Bellmont was determined the sun should have\r\nfull power to darken the shade which nature had first bestowed upon her\r\nas best befitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA FRIEND FOR NIG.\r\n\r\n    "Hours of my youth! when nurtured in my breast,\r\n    To love a stranger, friendship made me blest:--\r\n    Friendship, the dear peculiar bond of youth,\r\n    When every artless bosom throbs with truth;\r\n    Untaught by worldly wisdom how to feign;\r\n    And check each impulse with prudential reign;\r\n    When all we feel our honest souls disclose--\r\n    In love to friends, in open hate to foes;\r\n    No varnished tales the lips of youth repeat,\r\n    No dear-bought knowledge purchased by deceit."\r\n\r\n    BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH what differing emotions have the denizens of earth awaited the\r\napproach of to-day. Some sufferer has counted the vibrations of the\r\npendulum impatient for its dawn, who, now that it has arrived, is\r\nanxious for its close. The votary of pleasure, conscious of yesterday\'s\r\nvoid, wishes for power to arrest time\'s haste till a few more hours of\r\nmirth shall be enjoyed. The unfortunate are yet gazing in vain for\r\ngoldenedged clouds they fancied would appear in their horizon. The good\r\nman feels that he has accomplished too little for the Master, and sighs\r\nthat another day must so soon close. Innocent childhood, weary of its\r\nstay, longs for another morrow; busy manhood cries, hold! hold! and\r\npursues it to another\'s dawn. All are dissatisfied. All crave some good\r\nnot yet possessed, which time is expected to bring with all its morrows.\r\n\r\nWas it strange that, to a disconsolate child, three years should seem a\r\nlong, long time? During school time she had rest from Mrs. Bellmont\'s\r\ntyranny. She was now nine years old; time, her mistress said, such\r\nprivileges should cease.\r\n\r\nShe could now read and spell, and knew the elementary steps in grammar,\r\narithmetic, and writing. Her education completed, as SHE said, Mrs.\r\nBellmont felt that her time and person belonged solely to her. She was\r\nunder her in every sense of the word. What an opportunity to indulge her\r\nvixen nature! No matter what occurred to ruffle her, or from what source\r\nprovocation came, real or fancied, a few blows on Nig seemed to relieve\r\nher of a portion of ill-will.\r\n\r\nThese were days when Fido was the entire confidant of Frado. She told\r\nhim her griefs as though he were human; and he sat so still, and\r\nlistened so attentively, she really believed he knew her sorrows. All\r\nthe leisure moments she could gain were used in teaching him some feat\r\nof dog-agility, so that Jack pronounced him very knowing, and was truly\r\ngratified to know he had furnished her with a gift answering his\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\nFido was the constant attendant of Frado, when sent from the house on\r\nerrands, going and returning with the cows, out in the fields, to the\r\nvillage. If ever she forgot her hardships it was in his company.\r\n\r\nSpring was now retiring. James, one of the absent sons, was expected\r\nhome on a visit. He had never seen the last acquisition to the family.\r\nJack had written faithfully of all the merits of his colored protege,\r\nand hinted plainly that mother did not always treat her just right. Many\r\nwere the preparations to make the visit pleasant, and as the day\r\napproached when he was to arrive, great exertions were made to cook the\r\nfavorite viands, to prepare the choicest table-fare.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the arrival day was a busy one. Frado knew not who would\r\nbe of so much importance; her feet were speeding hither and thither so\r\nunsparingly. Mrs. Bellmont seemed a trifle fatigued, and her shoes which\r\nhad, early in the morning, a methodic squeak, altered to an irregular,\r\npeevish snap.\r\n\r\n"Get some little wood to make the fire burn," said Mrs. Bellmont, in a\r\nsharp tone. Frado obeyed, bringing the smallest she could find.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bellmont approached her, and, giving her a box on her ear,\r\nreiterated the command.\r\n\r\nThe first the child brought was the smallest to be found; of course, the\r\nsecond must be a trifle larger. She well knew it was, as she threw it\r\ninto a box on the hearth. To Mrs. Bellmont it was a greater affront, as\r\nwell as larger wood, so she "taught her" with the raw-hide, and sent her\r\nthe third time for "little wood."\r\n\r\nNig, weeping, knew not what to do. She had carried the smallest; none\r\nleft would suit her mistress; of course further punishment awaited her;\r\nso she gathered up whatever came first, and threw it down on the hearth.\r\nAs she expected, Mrs. Bellmont, enraged, approached her, and kicked her\r\nso forcibly as to throw her upon the floor. Before she could rise,\r\nanother foiled the attempt, and then followed kick after kick in quick\r\nsuccession and power, till she reached the door. Mr. Bellmont and Aunt\r\nAbby, hearing the noise, rushed in, just in time to see the last of the\r\nperformance. Nig jumped up, and rushed from the house, out of sight.\r\n\r\nAunt Abby returned to her apartment, followed by John, who was muttering\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\n"What were you saying?" asked Aunt Abby.\r\n\r\n"I said I hoped the child never would come into the house again."\r\n\r\n"What would become of her? You cannot mean THAT," continued his sister.\r\n\r\n"I do mean it. The child does as much work as a woman ought to; and just\r\nsee how she is kicked about!"\r\n\r\n"Why do you have it so, John?" asked his sister.\r\n\r\n"How am I to help it? Women rule the earth, and all in it."\r\n\r\n"I think I should rule my own house, John,"--\r\n\r\n"And live in hell meantime," added Mr. Bellmont.\r\n\r\nJohn now sauntered out to the barn to await the quieting of the storm.\r\n\r\nAunt Abby had a glimpse of Nig as she passed out of the yard; but to\r\narrest her, or shew her that SHE would shelter her, in Mrs. Bellmont\'s\r\npresence, would only bring reserved wrath on her defenceless head. Her\r\nsister-inlaw had great prejudices against her. One cause of the\r\nalienation was that she did not give her right in the homestead to John,\r\nand leave it forever; another was that she was a professor of religion,\r\n(so was Mrs. Bellmont;) but Nab, as she called her, did not live\r\naccording to her profession; another, that she WOULD sometimes give Nig\r\ncake and pie, which she was never allowed to have at home. Mary had\r\noften noticed and spoken of her inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nThe dinner hour passed. Frado had not appeared. Mrs. B. made no inquiry\r\nor search. Aunt Abby looked long, and found her concealed in an\r\noutbuilding. "Come into the house with me," implored Aunt Abby.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t going in any more," sobbed the child.\r\n\r\n"What will you do?" asked Aunt Abby.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to stay out here and die. I ha\'n\'t got no mother, no home. I\r\nwish I was dead."\r\n\r\n"Poor thing," muttered Aunt Abby; and slyly providing her with some\r\ndinner, left her to her grief.\r\n\r\nJane went to confer with her Aunt about the affair; and learned from her\r\nthe retreat. She would gladly have concealed her in her own chamber, and\r\nministered to her wants; but she was dependent on Mary and her mother\r\nfor care, and any displeasure caused by attention to Nig, was seriously\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nToward night the coach brought James. A time of general greeting,\r\ninquiries for absent members of the family, a visit to Aunt Abby\'s room,\r\nundoing a few delicacies for Jane, brought them to the tea hour.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Frado?" asked Mr. Bellmont, observing she was not in her usual\r\nplace, behind her mistress\' chair.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, and I don\'t care. If she makes her appearance again, I\'ll\r\ntake the skin from her body," replied his wife.\r\n\r\nJames, a fine looking young man, with a pleasant countenance, placid,\r\nand yet decidedly serious, yet not stern, looked up confounded. He was\r\nno stranger to his mother\'s nature; but years of absence had erased the\r\noccurrences once so familiar, and he asked, "Is this that pretty little\r\nNig, Jack writes to me about, that you are so severe upon, mother?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not leave much of her beauty to be seen, if she comes in sight;\r\nand now, John," said Mrs. B., turning to her husband, "you need not\r\nthink you are going to learn her to treat me in this way; just see how\r\nsaucy she was this morning. She shall learn her place."\r\n\r\nMr. Bellmont raised his calm, determined eye full upon her, and said, in\r\na decisive manner: "You shall not strike, or scald, or skin her, as you\r\ncall it, if she comes back again. Remember!" and he brought his hand\r\ndown upon the table. "I have searched an hour for her now, and she is\r\nnot to be found on the premises. Do YOU know where she is? Is she YOUR\r\nprisoner?"\r\n\r\n"No! I have just told you I did not know where she was. Nab has her hid\r\nsomewhere, I suppose. Oh, dear! I did not think it would come to this;\r\nthat my own husband would treat me so." Then came fast flowing tears,\r\nwhich no one but Mary seemed to notice. Jane crept into Aunt Abby\'s\r\nroom; Mr. Bellmont and James went out of doors, and Mary remained to\r\ncondole with her parent.\r\n\r\n"Do you know where Frado is?" asked Jane of her aunt.\r\n\r\n"No," she replied. "I have hunted everywhere. She has left her first\r\nhiding-place. I cannot think what has become of her. There comes Jack\r\nand Fido; perhaps he knows;" and she walked to a window near, where\r\nJames and his father were conversing together.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers exchanged a hearty greeting, and then Mr. Bellmont told\r\nJack to eat his supper; afterward he wished to send him away. He\r\nimmediately went in. Accustomed to all the phases of indoor storms, from\r\na whine to thunder and lightning, he saw at a glance marks of\r\ndisturbance. He had been absent through the day, with the hired men.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the fuss?" asked he, rushing into Aunt Abby\'s.\r\n\r\n"Eat your supper," said Jane; "go home, Jack."\r\n\r\nBack again through the dining-room, and out to his father.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the fuss?" again inquired he of his father.\r\n\r\n"Eat your supper, Jack, and see if you can find Frado. She\'s not been\r\nseen since morning, and then she was kicked out of the house."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t eat my supper till I find her," said Jack, indignantly. "Come,\r\nJames, and see the little creature mother treats so."\r\n\r\nThey started, calling, searching, coaxing, all their way along. No\r\nFrado. They returned to the house to consult. James and Jack declared\r\nthey would not sleep till she was found.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bellmont attempted to dissuade them from the search. "It was a\r\nshame a little NIGGER should make so much trouble."\r\n\r\nJust then Fido came running up, and Jack exclaimed, "Fido knows where\r\nshe is, I\'ll bet."\r\n\r\n"So I believe," said his father; "but we shall not be wiser unless we\r\ncan outwit him. He will not do what his mistress forbids him."\r\n\r\n"I know how to fix him," said Jack. Taking a plate from the table, which\r\nwas still waiting, he called, "Fido! Fido! Frado wants some supper.\r\nCome!" Jack started, the dog followed, and soon capered on before, far,\r\nfar into the fields, over walls and through fences, into a piece of\r\nswampy land. Jack followed close, and soon appeared to James, who was\r\nquite in the rear, coaxing and forcing Frado along with him.\r\n\r\nA frail child, driven from shelter by the cruelty of his mother, was an\r\nobject of interest to James. They persuaded her to go home with them,\r\nwarmed her by the kitchen fire, gave her a good supper, and took her\r\nwith them into the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n"Take that nigger out of my sight," was Mrs. Bellmont\'s command, before\r\nthey could be seated.\r\n\r\nJames led her into Aunt Abby\'s, where he knew they were welcome. They\r\nchatted awhile until Frado seemed cheerful; then James led her to her\r\nroom, and waited until she retired.\r\n\r\n"Are you glad I\'ve come home?" asked James.\r\n\r\n"Yes; if you won\'t let me be whipped tomorrow."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t be whipped. You must try to be a good girl," counselled\r\nJames.\r\n\r\n"If I do, I get whipped," sobbed the child. "They won\'t believe what I\r\nsay. Oh, I wish I had my mother back; then I should not be kicked and\r\nwhipped so. Who made me so?"\r\n\r\n"God," answered James.\r\n\r\n"Did God make you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Who made Aunt Abby?"\r\n\r\n"God."\r\n\r\n"Who made your mother?"\r\n\r\n"God."\r\n\r\n"Did the same God that made her make me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I don\'t like him."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because he made her white, and me black. Why didn\'t he make us BOTH\r\nwhite?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; try to go to sleep, and you will feel better in the\r\nmorning," was all the reply he could make to her knotty queries. It was\r\na long time before she fell asleep; and a number of days before James\r\nfelt in a mood to visit and entertain old associates and friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. DEPARTURES.\r\n\r\n    Life is a strange avenue of various trees and flowers;\r\n    Lightsome at commencement, but darkening to its end in a distant,\r\n    massy portal.\r\n\r\n    It beginneth as a little path, edged with the violet and primrose,\r\n    A little path of lawny grass and soft to tiny feet.\r\n    Soon, spring thistles in the way.\r\n\r\n    TUPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES\' visit concluded. Frado had become greatly attached to him, and\r\nwith sorrow she listened and joined in the farewells which preceded his\r\nexit. The remembrance of his kindness cheered her through many a weary\r\nmonth, and an occasional word to her in letters to Jack, were like "cold\r\nwaters to a thirsty soul." Intelligence came that James would soon\r\nmarry; Frado hoped he would, and remove her from such severe treatment\r\nas she was subject to. There had been additional burdens laid on her\r\nsince his return. She must now MILK the cows, she had then only to\r\ndrive. Flocks of sheep had been added to the farm, which daily claimed a\r\nportion of her time. In the absence of the men, she must harness the\r\nhorse for Mary and her mother to ride, go to mill, in short, do the work\r\nof a boy, could one be procured to endure the tirades of Mrs. Bellmont.\r\nShe was first up in the morning, doing what she could towards breakfast.\r\nOccasionally, she would utter some funny thing for Jack\'s benefit, while\r\nshe was waiting on the table, provoking a sharp look from his mother, or\r\nexpulsion from the room.\r\n\r\nOn one such occasion, they found her on the roof of the barn. Some\r\nrepairs having been necessary, a staging had been erected, and was not\r\nwholly removed. Availing herself of ladders, she was mounted in high\r\nglee on the topmost board. Mr. Bellmont called sternly for her to come\r\ndown; poor Jane nearly fainted from fear. Mrs. B. and Mary did not care\r\nif she "broke her neck," while Jack and the men laughed at her\r\nfearlessness. Strange, one spark of playfulness could remain amid such\r\nconstant toil; but her natural temperament was in a high degree\r\nmirthful, and the encouragement she received from Jack and the hired\r\nmen, constantly nurtured the inclination. When she had none of the\r\nfamily around to be merry with, she would amuse herself with the\r\nanimals. Among the sheep was a willful leader, who always persisted in\r\nbeing first served, and many times in his fury he had thrown down Nig,\r\ntill, provoked, she resolved to punish him. The pasture in which the\r\nsheep grazed was founded on three sides by a wide stream, which flowed\r\non one side at the base of precipitous banks. The first spare moments at\r\nher command, she ran to the pasture with a dish in her hand, and\r\nmounting the highest point of land nearest the stream, called the flock\r\nto their mock repast. Mr. Bellmont, with his laborers, were in sight,\r\nthough unseen by Frado. They paused to see what she was about to do.\r\nShould she by any mishap lose her footing, she must roll into the\r\nstream, and, without aid, must drown. They thought of shouting; but they\r\nfeared an unexpected salute might startle her, and thus ensure what they\r\nwere anxious to prevent. They watched in breathless silence. The willful\r\nsheep came furiously leaping and bounding far in advance of the flock.\r\nJust as he leaped for the dish, she suddenly jumped to one side, when\r\ndown he rolled into the river, and swimming across, remained alone till\r\nnight. The men lay down, convulsed with laughter at the trick, and\r\nguessed at once its object. Mr. Bellmont talked seriously to the child\r\nfor exposing herself to such danger; but she hopped about on her toes,\r\nand with laughable grimaces replied, she knew she was quick enough to\r\n"give him a slide."\r\n\r\nBut to return. James married a Baltimorean lady of wealthy parentage, an\r\nindispensable requisite, his mother had always taught him. He did not\r\nmarry her wealth, though; he loved HER, sincerely. She was not unlike\r\nhis sister Jane, who had a social, gentle, loving nature, rather TOO\r\nyielding, her brother thought. His Susan had a firmness which Jane\r\nneeded to complete her character, but which her ill health may in a\r\nmeasure have failed to produce. Although an invalid, she was not\r\nexcluded from society. Was it strange SHE should seem a desirable\r\ncompanion, a treasure as a wife?\r\n\r\nTwo young men seemed desirous of possessing her. One was a neighbor,\r\nHenry Reed, a tall, spare young man, with sandy hair, and blue, sinister\r\neyes. He seemed to appreciate her wants, and watch with interest her\r\nimprovement or decay. His kindness she received, and by it was almost\r\nwon. Her mother wished her to encourage his attentions. She had counted\r\nthe acres which were to be transmitted to an only son; she knew there\r\nwas silver in the purse; she would not have Jane too sentimental.\r\n\r\nThe eagerness with which he amassed wealth, was repulsive to Jane; he\r\ndid not spare his person or beasts in its pursuit. She felt that to such\r\na man she should be considered an incumbrance; she doubted if he would\r\ndesire her, if he did not know she would bring a handsome patrimony. Her\r\nmother, full in favor with the parents of Henry, commanded her to accept\r\nhim. She engaged herself, yielding to her mother\'s wishes, because she\r\nhad not strength to oppose them; and sometimes, when witness of her\r\nmother\'s and Mary\'s tyranny, she felt any change would be preferable,\r\neven such a one as this. She knew her husband should be the man of her\r\nown selecting, one she was conscious of preferring before all others.\r\nShe could not say this of Henry.\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma, a visitor came to Aunt Abby\'s; one of her\r\nboy-favorites, George Means, from an adjoining State. Sensible, plain\r\nlooking, agreeable, talented, he could not long be a stranger to any one\r\nwho wished to know him. Jane was accustomed to sit much with Aunt Abby\r\nalways; her presence now seemed necessary to assist in entertaining this\r\nyouthful friend. Jane was more pleased with him each day, and silently\r\nwished Henry possessed more refinement, and the polished manners of\r\nGeorge. She felt dissatisfied with her relation to him. His calls while\r\nGeorge was there, brought their opposing qualities vividly before her,\r\nand she found it disagreeable to force herself into those attentions\r\nbelonging to him. She received him apparently only as a neighbor.\r\n\r\nGeorge returned home, and Jane endeavored to stifle the risings of\r\ndissatisfaction, and had nearly succeeded, when a letter came which\r\nneeded but one glance to assure her of its birthplace; and she retired\r\nfor its perusal. Well was it for her that her mother\'s suspicion was not\r\naroused, or her curiosity startled to inquire who it came from. After\r\nreading it, she glided into Aunt Abby\'s, and placed it in her hands, who\r\nwas no stranger to Jane\'s trials.\r\n\r\nGeorge could not rest after his return, he wrote, until he had\r\ncommunicated to Jane the emotions her presence awakened, and his desire\r\nto love and possess her as his own. He begged to know if his affections\r\nwere reciprocated, or could be; if she would permit him to write to her;\r\nif she was free from all obligation to another.\r\n\r\n"What would mother say?" queried Jane, as she received the letter from\r\nher aunt.\r\n\r\n"Not much to comfort you."\r\n\r\n"Now, aunt, George is just such a man as I could really love, I think,\r\nfrom all I have seen of him; you know I never could say that of Henry"--\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t marry him," interrupted Aunt Abby.\r\n\r\n"Mother will make me."\r\n\r\n"Your father won\'t."\r\n\r\n"Well, aunt, what can I do? Would you answer the letter, or not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, answer it. Tell him your situation."\r\n\r\n"I shall not tell him all my feelings."\r\n\r\nJane answered that she had enjoyed his company much; she had seen\r\nnothing offensive in his manner or appearance; that she was under no\r\nobligations which forbade her receiving letters from him as a friend and\r\nacquaintance. George was puzzled by the reply. He wrote to Aunt Abby,\r\nand from her learned all. He could not see Jane thus sacrificed, without\r\nmaking an effort to rescue her. Another visit followed. George heard\r\nJane say she preferred HIM. He then conferred with Henry at his home. It\r\nwas not a pleasant subject to talk upon. To be thus supplanted, was not\r\nto be thought of. He would sacrifice everything but his inheritance to\r\nsecure his betrothed.\r\n\r\n"And so you are the cause of her late coldness towards me. Leave! I will\r\ntalk no more about it; the business is settled between us; there it will\r\nremain," said Henry.\r\n\r\n"Have you no wish to know the real state of Jane\'s affections towards\r\nyou?" asked George.\r\n\r\n"No! Go, I say! go!" and Henry opened the door for him to pass out.\r\n\r\nHe retired to Aunt Abby\'s. Henry soon followed, and presented his cause\r\nto Mrs. Bellmont.\r\n\r\nProvoked, surprised, indignant, she summoned Jane to her presence, and\r\nafter a lengthy tirade upon Nab, and her satanic influence, told her she\r\ncould not break the bonds which held her to Henry; she should not.\r\nGeorge Means was rightly named; he was, truly, mean enough; she knew his\r\nfamily of old; his father had four wives, and five times as many\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n"Go to your room, Miss Jane," she continued. "Don\'t let me know of your\r\nbeing in Nab\'s for one while."\r\n\r\nThe storm was now visible to all beholders. Mr. Bellmont sought Jane.\r\nShe told him her objections to Henry; showed him George\'s letter; told\r\nher answer, the occasion of his visit. He bade her not make herself\r\nsick; he would see that she was not compelled to violate her free choice\r\nin so important a transaction. He then sought the two young men; told\r\nthem he could not as a father see his child compelled to an uncongenial\r\nunion; a free, voluntary choice was of such importance to one of her\r\nhealth. She must be left free to her own choice.\r\n\r\nJane sent Henry a letter of dismission; he her one of a legal bearing,\r\nin which he balanced his disappointment by a few hundreds.\r\n\r\nTo brave her mother\'s fury, nearly overcame her, but the consolation of\r\na kind father and aunt cheered her on. After a suitable interval she was\r\nmarried to George, and removed to his home in Vermont. Thus another\r\nlight disappeared from Nig\'s horizon. Another was soon to follow. Jack\r\nwas anxious to try his skill in providing for his own support; so a\r\nsituation as clerk in a store was procured in a Western city, and six\r\nmonths after Jane\'s departure, was Nig abandoned to the tender mercies\r\nof Mary and her mother. As if to remove the last vestige of earthly joy,\r\nMrs. Bellmont sold the companion and pet of Frado, the dog Fido.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nVARIETIES.\r\n\r\n"Hard are life\'s early steps; and but that youth is buoyant, confident,\r\nand strong in hope, men would behold its threshold and despair."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE sorrow of Frado was very great for her pet, and Mr. Bellmont by\r\ngreat exertion obtained it again, much to the relief of the child. To be\r\nthus deprived of all her sources of pleasure was a sure way to exalt\r\ntheir worth, and Fido became, in her estimation, a more valuable\r\npresence than the human beings who surrounded her.\r\n\r\nJames had now been married a number of years, and frequent requests for\r\na visit from the family were at last accepted, and Mrs. Bellmont made\r\ngreat preparations for a fall sojourn in Baltimore. Mary was installed\r\nhousekeeper--in name merely, for Nig was the only moving power in the\r\nhouse. Although suffering from their joint severity, she felt safer than\r\nto be thrown wholly upon an ardent, passionate, unrestrained young lady,\r\nwhom she always hated and felt it hard to be obliged to obey. The trial\r\nshe must meet. Were Jack or Jane at home she would have some refuge; one\r\nonly remained; good Aunt Abby was still in the house.\r\n\r\nShe saw the fast receding coach which conveyed her master and mistress\r\nwith regret, and begged for one favor only, that James would send for\r\nher when they returned, a hope she had confidently cherished all these\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\nShe was now able to do all the washing, ironing, baking, and the common\r\net cetera of household duties, though but fourteen. Mary left all for\r\nher to do, though she affected great responsibility. She would show\r\nherself in the kitchen long enough to relieve herself of some command,\r\nbetter withheld; or insist upon some compliance to her wishes in some\r\ndepartment which she was very imperfectly acquainted with, very much\r\nless than the person she was addressing; and so impetuous till her\r\norders were obeyed, that to escape the turmoil, Nig would often go\r\ncontrary to her own knowledge to gain a respite.\r\n\r\nNig was taken sick! What could be done The WORK, certainly, but not by\r\nMiss Mary. So Nig would work while she could remain erect, then sink\r\ndown upon the floor, or a chair, till she could rally for a fresh\r\neffort. Mary would look in upon her, chide her for her laziness,\r\nthreaten to tell mother when she came home, and so forth.\r\n\r\n"Nig!" screamed Mary, one of her sickest days, "come here, and sweep\r\nthese threads from the carpet." She attempted to drag her weary limbs\r\nalong, using the broom as support. Impatient of delay, she called again,\r\nbut with a different request. "Bring me some wood, you lazy jade,\r\nquick." Nig rested the broom against the wall, and started on the fresh\r\nbehest.\r\n\r\nToo long gone. Flushed with anger, she rose and greeted her with, "What\r\nare you gone so long for? Bring it in quick, I say."\r\n\r\n"I am coming as quick as I can," she replied, entering the door.\r\n\r\n"Saucy, impudent nigger, you! is this the way you answer me?" and taking\r\na large carving knife from the table, she hurled it, in her rage, at the\r\ndefenceless girl.\r\n\r\nDodging quickly, it fastened in the ceiling a few inches from where she\r\nstood. There rushed on Mary\'s mental vision a picture of bloodshed, in\r\nwhich she was the perpetrator, and the sad consequences of what was so\r\nnearly an actual occurrence.\r\n\r\n"Tell anybody of this, if you dare. If you tell Aunt Abby, I\'ll\r\ncertainly kill you," said she, terrified. She returned to her room,\r\nbrushed her threads herself; was for a day or two more guarded, and so\r\nescaped deserved and merited penalty.\r\n\r\nOh, how long the weeks seemed which held Nig in subjection to Mary; but\r\nthey passed like all earth\'s sorrows and joys. Mr. and Mrs. B. returned\r\ndelighted with their visit, and laden with rich presents for Mary. No\r\nword of hope for Nig. James was quite unwell, and would come home the\r\nnext spring for a visit.\r\n\r\nThis, thought Nig, will be my time of release. I shall go back with him.\r\n\r\nFrom early dawn until after all were retired, was she toiling,\r\noverworked, disheartened, longing for relief.\r\n\r\nExposure from heat to cold, or the reverse, often destroyed her health\r\nfor short intervals. She wore no shoes until after frost, and snow even,\r\nappeared; and bared her feet again before the last vestige of winter\r\ndisappeared. These sudden changes she was so illy guarded against,\r\nnearly conquered her physical system. Any word of complaint was severely\r\nrepulsed or cruelly punished.\r\n\r\nShe was told she had much more than she deserved. So that manual labor\r\nwas not in reality her only burden; but such an incessant torrent of\r\nscolding and boxing and threatening, was enough to deter one of maturer\r\nyears from remaining within sound of the strife.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give an impression of the manifest enjoyment of Mrs.\r\nB. in these kitchen scenes. It was her favorite exercise to enter the\r\napartment noisily, vociferate orders, give a few sudden blows to quicken\r\nNig\'s pace, then return to the sitting room with SUCH a satisfied\r\nexpression, congratulating herself upon her thorough house-keeping\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nShe usually rose in the morning at the ringing of the bell for\r\nbreakfast; if she were heard stirring before that time, Nig knew well\r\nthere was an extra amount of scolding to be borne.\r\n\r\nNo one now stood between herself and Frado, but Aunt Abby. And if SHE\r\ndared to interfere in the least, she was ordered back to her "own\r\nquarters." Nig would creep slyly into her room, learn what she could of\r\nher regarding the absent, and thus gain some light in the thick gloom of\r\ncare and toil and sorrow in which she was immersed.\r\n\r\nThe first of spring a letter came from James, announcing declining\r\nhealth. He must try northern air as a restorative; so Frado joyfully\r\nprepared for this agreeable increase of the family, this addition to her\r\ncares.\r\n\r\nHe arrived feeble, lame, from his disease, so changed Frado wept at his\r\nappearance, fearing he would be removed from her forever. He kindly\r\ngreeted her, took her to the parlor to see his wife and child, and said\r\nmany things to kindle smiles on her sad face.\r\n\r\nFrado felt so happy in his presence, so safe from maltreatment! He was\r\nto her a shelter. He observed, silently, the ways of the house a few\r\ndays; Nig still took her meals in the same manner as formerly, having\r\nthe same allowance of food. He, one day, bade her not remove the food,\r\nbut sit down to the table and eat.\r\n\r\n"She WILL, mother," said he, calmly, but imperatively; I\'m determined;\r\nshe works hard; I\'ve watched her. Now, while I stay, she is going to sit\r\ndown HERE, and eat such food as we eat."\r\n\r\nA few sparks from the mother\'s black eyes were the only reply; she\r\nfeared to oppose where she knew she could not prevail. So Nig\'s standing\r\nattitude, and selected diet vanished.\r\n\r\nHer clothing was yet poor and scanty; she was not blessed with a Sunday\r\nattire; for she was never permitted to attend church with her mistress.\r\n"Religion was not meant for niggers," SHE said; when the husband and\r\nbrothers were absent, she would drive Mrs. B. and Mary there, then\r\nreturn, and go for them at the close of the service, but never remain.\r\nAunt Abby would take her to evening meetings, held in the neighborhood,\r\nwhich Mrs. B. never attended; and impart to her lessons of truth and\r\ngrace as they walked to the place of prayer.\r\n\r\nMany of less piety would scorn to present so doleful a figure; Mrs. B.\r\nhad shaved her glossy ringlets; and, in her coarse cloth gown and\r\nancient bonnet, she was anything but an enticing object. But Aunt Abby\r\nlooked within. She saw a soul to save, an immortality of happiness to\r\nsecure.\r\n\r\nThese evenings were eagerly anticipated by Nig; it was such a pleasant\r\nrelease from labor.\r\n\r\nSuch perfect contrast in the melody and prayers of these good people to\r\nthe harsh tones which fell on her ears during the day.\r\n\r\nSoon she had all their sacred songs at command, and enlivened her toil\r\nby accompanying it with this melody.\r\n\r\nJames encouraged his aunt in her efforts. He had found the SAVIOUR, he\r\nwished to have Frado\'s desolate heart gladdened, quieted, sustained, by\r\nHIS presence. He felt sure there were elements in her heart which,\r\ntransformed and purified by the gospel, would make her worthy the esteem\r\nand friendship of the world. A kind, affectionate heart, native wit, and\r\ncommon sense, and the pertness she sometimes exhibited, he felt if\r\nrestrained properly, might become useful in originating a self-reliance\r\nwhich would be of service to her in after years.\r\n\r\nYet it was not possible to compass all this, while she remained where\r\nshe was. He wished to be cautious about pressing too closely her claims\r\non his mother, as it would increase the burdened one he so anxiously\r\nwished to relieve. He cheered her on with the hope of returning with his\r\nfamily, when he recovered sufficiently.\r\n\r\nNig seemed awakened to new hopes and aspirations, and realized a longing\r\nfor the future, hitherto unknown.\r\n\r\nTo complete Nig\'s enjoyment, Jack arrived unexpectedly. His greeting was\r\nas hearty to herself as to any of the family.\r\n\r\n"Where are your curls, Fra?" asked Jack, after the usual salutation.\r\n\r\n"Your mother cut them off."\r\n\r\n"Thought you were getting handsome, did she? Same old story, is it;\r\nknocks and bumps? Better times coming; never fear, Nig."\r\n\r\nHow different this appellative sounded from him; he said it in such a\r\ntone, with such a rogueish look!\r\n\r\nShe laughed, and replied that he had better take her West for a\r\nhousekeeper.\r\n\r\nJack was pleased with James\'s innovations of table discipline, and would\r\noften tarry in the dining-room, to see Nig in her new place at the\r\nfamily table. As he was thus sitting one day, after the family had\r\nfinished dinner, Frado seated herself in her mistress\' chair, and was\r\njust reaching for a clean dessert plate which was on the table, when her\r\nmistress entered.\r\n\r\n"Put that plate down; you shall not have a clean one; eat from mine,"\r\ncontinued she. Nig hesitated. To eat after James, his wife or Jack,\r\nwould have been pleasant; but to be commanded to do what was\r\ndisagreeable by her mistress, BECAUSE it was disagreeable, was trying.\r\nQuickly looking about, she took the plate, called Fido to wash it, which\r\nhe did to the best of his ability; then, wiping her knife and fork on\r\nthe cloth, she proceeded to eat her dinner.\r\n\r\nNig never looked toward her mistress during the process. She had Jack\r\nnear; she did not fear her now.\r\n\r\nInsulted, full of rage, Mrs. Bellmont rushed to her husband, and\r\ncommanded him to notice this insult; to whip that child; if he would not\r\ndo it, James ought.\r\n\r\nJames came to hear the kitchen version of the affair. Jack was boiling\r\nover with laughter. He related all the circumstances to James, and\r\npulling a bright, silver half-dollar from his pocket, he threw it at\r\nNig, saying, "There, take that; \'twas worth paying for."\r\n\r\nJames sought his mother; told her he "would not excuse or palliate Nig\'s\r\nimpudence; but she should not be whipped or be punished at all. You have\r\nnot treated her, mother, so as to gain her love; she is only exhibiting\r\nyour remissness in this matter."\r\n\r\nShe only smothered her resentment until a convenient opportunity\r\noffered. The first time she was left alone with Nig, she gave her a\r\nthorough beating, to bring up arrearages; and threatened, if she ever\r\nexposed her to James, she would "cut her tongue out."\r\n\r\nJames found her, upon his return, sobbing; but fearful of revenge, she\r\ndared not answer his queries. He guessed their cause, and longed for\r\nreturning health to take her under his protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSPIRITUAL CONDITION OF NIG.\r\n\r\n    "What are our joys but dreams? and what our hopes\r\n    But goodly shadows in the summer cloud?"\r\n\r\n    H. K. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES did not improve as was hoped. Month after month passed away, and\r\nbrought no prospect of returning health. He could not walk far from the\r\nhouse for want of strength; but he loved to sit with Aunt Abby in her\r\nquiet room, talking of unseen glories, and heart-experiences, while\r\nplanning for the spiritual benefit of those around them. In these\r\nconfidential interviews, Frado was never omitted. They would discuss the\r\nprevalent opinion of the public, that people of color are really\r\ninferior; incapable of cultivation and refinement. They would glance at\r\nthe qualities of Nig, which promised so much if rightly directed. "I\r\nwish you would take her, James, when you are well, home with YOU," said\r\nAunt Abby, in one of these seasons.\r\n\r\n"Just what I am longing to do, Aunt Abby. Susan is just of my mind, and\r\nwe intend to take her; I have been wishing to do so for years."\r\n\r\n"She seems much affected by what she hears at the evening meetings, and\r\nasks me many questions on serious things; seems to love to read the\r\nBible; I feel hopes of her."\r\n\r\n"I hope she IS thoughtful; no one has a kinder heart, one capable of\r\nloving more devotedly. But to think how prejudiced the world are towards\r\nher people; that she must be reared in such ignorance as to drown all\r\nthe finer feelings. When I think of what she might be, of what she will\r\nbe, I feel like grasping time till opinions change, and thousands like\r\nher rise into a noble freedom. I have seen Frado\'s grief, because she is\r\nblack, amount to agony. It makes me sick to recall these scenes. Mother\r\npretends to think she don\'t know enough to sorrow for anything; but if\r\nshe could see her as I have, when she supposed herself entirely alone,\r\nexcept her little dog Fido, lamenting her loneliness and complexion, I\r\nthink, if she is not past feeling, she would retract. In the summer I\r\nwas walking near the barn, and as I stood I heard sobs. \'Oh! oh!\' I\r\nheard, \'why was I made? why can\'t I die? Oh, what have I to live for? No\r\none cares for me only to get my work. And I feel sick; who cares for\r\nthat? Work as long as I can stand, and then fall down and lay there till\r\nI can get up. No mother, father, brother or sister to care for me, and\r\nthen it is, You lazy nigger, lazy nigger--all because I am black! Oh, if\r\nI could die!\'\r\n\r\n"I stepped into the barn, where I could see her. She was crouched down\r\nby the hay with her faithful friend Fido, and as she ceased speaking,\r\nburied her face in her hands, and cried bitterly; then, patting Fido,\r\nshe kissed him, saying, \'You love me, Fido, don\'t you? but we must go\r\nwork in the field.\' She started on her mission; I called her to me, and\r\ntold her she need not go, the hay was doing well.\r\n\r\n"She has such confidence in me that she will do just as I tell her; so\r\nwe found a seat under a shady tree, and there I took the opportunity to\r\ncombat the notions she seemed to entertain respecting the loneliness of\r\nher condition and want of sympathizing friends. I assured her that\r\nmother\'s views were by no means general; that in our part of the country\r\nthere were thousands upon thousands who favored the elevation of her\r\nrace, disapproving of oppression in all its forms; that she was not\r\nunpitied, friendless, and utterly despised; that she might hope for\r\nbetter things in the future. Having spoken these words of comfort, I\r\nrose with the resolution that if I recovered my health I would take her\r\nhome with me, whether mother was willing or not."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what your mother would do without her; still, I wish she\r\nwas away."\r\n\r\nSusan now came for her long absent husband, and they returned home to\r\ntheir room.\r\n\r\nThe month of November was one of great anxiety on James\'s account. He\r\nwas rapidly wasting away.\r\n\r\nA celebrated physician was called, and performed a surgical operation,\r\nas a last means. Should this fail, there was no hope. Of course he was\r\nconfined wholly to his room, mostly to his bed. With all his bodily\r\nsuffering, all his anxiety for his family, whom he might not live to\r\nprotect, he did not forget Frado. He shielded her from many beatings,\r\nand every day imparted religious instructions. No one, but his wife,\r\ncould move him so easily as Frado; so that in addition to her daily toil\r\nshe was often deprived of her rest at night.\r\n\r\nYet she insisted on being called; she wished to show her love for one\r\nwho had been such a friend to her. Her anxiety and grief increased as\r\nthe probabilities of his recovery became doubtful.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bellmont found her weeping on his account, shut her up, and whipped\r\nher with the raw-hide, adding an injunction never to be seen snivelling\r\nagain because she had a little work to do. She was very careful never to\r\nshed tears on his account, in her presence, afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nVISITOR AND DEPARTURE.\r\n\r\n--"Other cares engross me, and my tired soul with emulative haste, Looks\r\nto its God."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE brother associated with James in business, in Baltimore, was sent\r\nfor to confer with one who might never be able to see him there.\r\n\r\nJames began to speak of life as closing; of heaven, as of a place in\r\nimmediate prospect; of aspirations, which waited for fruition in glory.\r\nHis brother, Lewis by name, was an especial favorite of sister Mary;\r\nmore like her, in disposition and preferences than James or Jack.\r\n\r\nHe arrived as soon as possible after the request, and saw with regret\r\nthe sure indications of fatality in his sick brother, and listened to\r\nhis admonitions--admonitions to a Christian life--with tears, and\r\nuttered some promises of attention to the subject so dear to the heart\r\nof James.\r\n\r\nHow gladly he would have extended healing aid. But, alas! it was not in\r\nhis power; so, after listening to his wishes and arrangements for his\r\nfamily and business, he decided to return home.\r\n\r\nAnxious for company home, he persuaded his father and mother to permit\r\nMary to attend him. She was not at all needed in the sick room; she did\r\nnot choose to be useful in the kitchen, and then she was fully\r\ndetermined to go.\r\n\r\nSo all the trunks were assembled and crammed with the best selections\r\nfrom the wardrobe of herself and mother, where the last-mentioned\r\narticles could be appropriated.\r\n\r\n"Nig was never so helpful before," Mary remarked, and wondered what had\r\ninduced such a change in place of former sullenness.\r\n\r\nNig was looking further than the present, and congratulating herself\r\nupon some days of peace, for Mary never lost opportunity of informing\r\nher mother of Nig\'s delinquencies, were she otherwise ignorant.\r\n\r\nWas it strange if she were officious, with such relief in prospect?\r\n\r\nThe parting from the sick brother was tearful and sad. James prayed in\r\ntheir presence for their renewal in holiness; and urged their immediate\r\nattention to eternal realities, and gained a promise that Susan and\r\nCharlie should share their kindest regards.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were they on their way, than Nig slyly crept round to Aunt\r\nAbby\'s room, and tiptoeing and twisting herself into all shapes, she\r\nexclaimed,--\r\n\r\n"She\'s gone, Aunt Abby, she\'s gone, fairly gone;" and jumped up and\r\ndown, till Aunt Abby feared she would attract the notice of her mistress\r\nby such demonstrations.\r\n\r\n"Well, she\'s gone, gone, Aunt Abby. I hope she\'ll never come back\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"No! no! Frado, that\'s wrong! you would be wishing her dead; that won\'t\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll bet she\'ll never come back again; somehow, I feel as though\r\nshe wouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"She is James\'s sister," remonstrated Aunt Abby.\r\n\r\n"So is our cross sheep just as much, that I ducked in the river; I\'d\r\nlike to try my hand at curing HER too."\r\n\r\n"But you forget what our good minister told us last week, about doing\r\ngood to those that hate us."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I do good, Aunt Abby, when I washed and ironed and packed her\r\nold duds to get rid of her, and helped her pack her trunks, and run here\r\nand there for her?"\r\n\r\n"Well, well, Frado; you must go finish your work, or your mistress will\r\nbe after you, and remind you severely of Miss Mary, and some others\r\nbeside."\r\n\r\nNig went as she was told, and her clear voice was heard as she went,\r\nsinging in joyous notes the relief she felt at the removal of one of her\r\ntormentors.\r\n\r\nDay by day the quiet of the sick man\'s room was increased. He was\r\nhelpless and nervous; and often wished change of position, thereby\r\nhoping to gain momentary relief. The calls upon Frado were consequently\r\nmore frequent, her nights less tranquil. Her health was impaired by\r\nlifting the sick man, and by drudgery in the kitchen. Her ill health she\r\nendeavored to conceal from James, fearing he might have less repose if\r\nthere should be a change of attendants; and Mrs. Bellmont, she well\r\nknew, would have no sympathy for her. She was at last so much reduced as\r\nto be unable to stand erect for any great length of time. She would SIT\r\nat the table to wash her dishes; if she heard the well-known step of her\r\nmistress, she would rise till she returned to her room, and then sink\r\ndown for further rest. Of course she was longer than usual in completing\r\nthe services assigned her. This was a subject of complaint to Mrs.\r\nBellmont; and Frado endeavored to throw off all appearance of sickness\r\nin her presence.\r\n\r\nBut it was increasing upon her, and she could no longer hide her\r\nindisposition. Her mistress entered one day, and finding her seated,\r\ncommanded her to go to work. "I am sick," replied Frado, rising and\r\nwalking slowly to her unfinished task, "and cannot stand long, I feel so\r\nbad."\r\n\r\nAngry that she should venture a reply to her command, she suddenly\r\ninflicted a blow which lay the tottering girl prostrate on the floor.\r\nExcited by so much indulgence of a dangerous passion, she seemed left to\r\nunrestrained malice; and snatching a towel, stuffed the mouth of the\r\nsufferer, and beat her cruelly.\r\n\r\nFrado hoped she would end her misery by whipping her to death. She bore\r\nit with the hope of a martyr, that her misery would soon close. Though\r\nher mouth was muffled, and the sounds much stifled, there was a sensible\r\ncommotion, which James\' quick ear detected.\r\n\r\n"Call Frado to come here," he said faintly, "I have not seen her\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\nSusan retired with the request to the kitchen, where it was evident some\r\nbrutal scene had just been enacted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bellmont replied that she had "some work to do just now; when that\r\nwas done, she might come."\r\n\r\nSusan\'s appearance confirmed her husband\'s fears, and he requested his\r\nfather, who sat by the bedside, to go for her. This was a messenger, as\r\nJames well knew, who could not be denied; and the girl entered the room,\r\nsobbing and faint with anguish.\r\n\r\nJames called her to him, and inquired the cause of her sorrow. She was\r\nafraid to expose the cruel author of her misery, lest she should provoke\r\nnew attacks. But after much entreaty, she told him all, much which had\r\nescaped his watchful ear. Poor James shut his eyes in silence, as if\r\npained to forgetfulness by the recital. Then turning to Susan, he asked\r\nher to take Charlie, and walk out; "she needed the fresh air," he said.\r\n"And say to mother I wish Frado to sit by me till you return. I think\r\nyou are fading, from staying so long in this sick room." Mr. B. also\r\nleft, and Frado was thus left alone with her friend. Aunt Abby came in\r\nto make her daily visit, and seeing the sick countenance of the\r\nattendant, took her home with her to administer some cordial. She soon\r\nreturned, however, and James kept her with him the rest of the day; and\r\na comfortable night\'s repose following, she was enabled to continue, as\r\nusual, her labors. James insisted on her attending religious meetings in\r\nthe vicinity with Aunt Abby.\r\n\r\nFrado, under the instructions of Aunt Abby and the minister, became a\r\nbeliever in a future existence--one of happiness or misery. Her doubt\r\nwas, IS there a heaven for the black? She knew there was one for James,\r\nand Aunt Abby, and all good white people; but was there any for blacks?\r\nShe had listened attentively to all the minister said, and all Aunt Abby\r\nhad told her; but then it was all for white people.\r\n\r\nAs James approached that blessed world, she felt a strong desire to\r\nfollow, and be with one who was such a dear, kind friend to her.\r\n\r\nWhile she was exercised with these desires and aspirations, she attended\r\nan evening meeting with Aunt Abby, and the good man urged all, young or\r\nold, to accept the offers of mercy, to receive a compassionate Jesus as\r\ntheir Saviour. "Come to Christ," he urged, "all, young or old, white or\r\nblack, bond or free, come all to Christ for pardon; repent, believe."\r\n\r\nThis was the message she longed to hear; it seemed to be spoken for her.\r\nBut he had told them to repent; "what was that?" she asked. She knew she\r\nwas unfit for any heaven, made for whites or blacks. She would gladly\r\nrepent, or do anything which would admit her to share the abode of\r\nJames.\r\n\r\nHer anxiety increased; her countenance bore marks of solicitude unseen\r\nbefore; and though she said nothing of her inward contest, they all\r\nobserved a change.\r\n\r\nJames and Aunt Abby hoped it was the springing of good seed sown by the\r\nSpirit of God. Her tearful attention at the last meeting encouraged his\r\naunt to hope that her mind was awakened, her conscience aroused. Aunt\r\nAbby noticed that she was particularly engaged in reading the Bible; and\r\nthis strengthened her conviction that a heavenly Messenger was striving\r\nwith her. The neighbors dropped in to inquire after the sick, and also\r\nif Frado was "SERIOUS?" They noticed she seemed very thoughtful and\r\ntearful at the meetings. Mrs. Reed was very inquisitive; but Mrs.\r\nBellmont saw no appearance of change for the better. She did not feel\r\nresponsible for her spiritual culture, and hardly believed she had a\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nNig was in truth suffering much; her feelings were very intense on any\r\nsubject, when once aroused. She read her Bible carefully, and as often\r\nas an opportunity presented, which was when entirely secluded in her own\r\napartment, or by Aunt Abby\'s side, who kindly directed her to Christ,\r\nand instructed her in the way of salvation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bellmont found her one day quietly reading her Bible. Amazed and\r\nhalf crediting the reports of officious neighbors, she felt it was time\r\nto interfere. Here she was, reading and shedding tears over the Bible.\r\nShe ordered her to put up the book, and go to work, and not be\r\nsnivelling about the house, or stop to read again.\r\n\r\nBut there was one little spot seldom penetrated by her mistress\'\r\nwatchful eye: this was her room, uninviting and comfortless; but to\r\nherself a safe retreat. Here she would listen to the pleadings of a\r\nSaviour, and try to penetrate the veil of doubt and sin which clouded\r\nher soul, and long to cast off the fetters of sin, and rise to the\r\ncommunion of saints.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bellmont, as we before said, did not trouble herself about the\r\nfuture destiny of her servant. If she did what she desired for HER\r\nbenefit, it was all the responsibility she acknowledged. But she seemed\r\nto have great aversion to the notice Nig would attract should she become\r\npious. How could she meet this case? She resolved to make her complaint\r\nto John. Strange, when she was always foiled in this direction, she\r\nshould resort to him. It was time something was done; she had begun to\r\nread the Bible openly.\r\n\r\nThe night of this discovery, as they were retiring, Mrs. Bellmont\r\nintroduced the conversation, by saying:\r\n\r\n"I want your attention to what I am going to say. I have let Nig go out\r\nto evening meetings a few times, and, if you will believe it, I found\r\nher reading the Bible to-day, just as though she expected to turn pious\r\nnigger, and preach to white folks. So now you see what good comes of\r\nsending her to school. If she should get converted she would have to go\r\nto meeting: at least, as long as James lives. I wish he had not such\r\nqueer notions about her. It seems to trouble him to know he must die and\r\nleave her. He says if he should get well he would take her home with\r\nhim, or educate her here. Oh, how awful! What can the child mean? So\r\ncareful, too, of her! He says we shall ruin her health making her work\r\nso hard, and sleep in such a place. O, John! do you think he is in his\r\nright mind?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; she is slender."\r\n\r\n"Yes, YES!" she repeated sarcastically, "you know these niggers are just\r\nlike black snakes; you CAN\'T kill them. If she wasn\'t tough she would\r\nhave been killed long ago. There was never one of my girls could do half\r\nthe work."\r\n\r\n"Did they ever try?" interposed her husband. "I think she can do more\r\nthan all of them together."\r\n\r\n"What a man!" said she, peevishly. "But I want to know what is going to\r\nbe done with her about getting pious?"\r\n\r\n"Let her do just as she has a mind to. If it is a comfort to her, let\r\nher enjoy the privilege of being good. I see no objection."\r\n\r\n"I should think YOU were crazy, sure. Don\'t you know that every night\r\nshe will want to go toting off to meeting? and Sundays, too? and you\r\nknow we have a great deal of company Sundays, and she can\'t be spared."\r\n\r\n"I thought you Christians held to going to church," remarked Mr. B.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but who ever thought of having a nigger go, except to drive others\r\nthere? Why, according to you and James, we should very soon have her in\r\nthe parlor, as smart as our own girls. It\'s of no use talking to you or\r\nJames. If you should go on as you would like, it would not be six months\r\nbefore she would be leaving me; and that won\'t do. Just think how much\r\nprofit she was to us last summer. We had no work hired out; she did the\r\nwork of two girls--"\r\n\r\n"And got the whippings for two with it!" remarked Mr. Bellmont.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll beat the money out of her, if I can\'t get her worth any other\r\nway," retorted Mrs. B. sharply. While this scene was passing, Frado was\r\ntrying to utter the prayer of the publican, "God be merciful to me a\r\nsinner."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nDEATH.\r\n\r\n    We have now\r\n    But a small portion of what men call time,\r\n    To hold communion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING opened, and James, instead of rallying, as was hoped, grew worse\r\ndaily. Aunt Abby and Frado were the constant allies of Susan. Mrs.\r\nBellmont dared not lift him. She was not "strong enough," she said.\r\n\r\nIt was very offensive to Mrs. B. to have Nab about James so much. She\r\nhad thrown out many a hint to detain her from so often visiting the\r\nsick-room; but Aunt Abby was too well accustomed to her ways to mind\r\nthem. After various unsuccessful efforts, she resorted to the following\r\nexpedient. As she heard her cross the entry below, to ascend the stairs,\r\nshe slipped out and held the latch of the door which led into the upper\r\nentry.\r\n\r\n"James does not want to see you, or any one else," she said.\r\n\r\nAunt Abby hesitated, and returned slowly to her own room; wondering if\r\nit were really James\' wish not to see her. She did not venture again\r\nthat day, but still felt disturbed and anxious about him. She inquired\r\nof Frado, and learned that he was no worse. She asked her if James did\r\nnot wish her to come and see him; what could it mean?\r\n\r\nQuite late next morning, Susan came to see what had become of her aunt.\r\n\r\n"Your mother said James did not wish to see me, and I was afraid I tired\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Why, aunt, that is a mistake, I KNOW. What could mother mean?" asked\r\nSusan.\r\n\r\nThe next time she went to the sitting-room she asked her mother,--\r\n\r\n"Why does not Aunt Abby visit James as she has done? Where is she?"\r\n\r\n"At home. I hope that she will stay there," was the answer.\r\n\r\n"I should think she would come in and see James," continued Susan.\r\n\r\n"I told her he did not want to see her, and to stay out. You need make\r\nno stir about it; remember:" she added, with one of her fiery glances.\r\n\r\nSusan kept silence. It was a day or two before James spoke of her\r\nabsence. The family were at dinner, and Frado was watching beside him.\r\nHe inquired the cause of her absence, and SHE told him all. After the\r\nfamily returned he sent his wife for her. When she entered, he took her\r\nhand, and said, "Come to me often, Aunt. Come any time,--I am always\r\nglad to see you. I have but a little longer to be with you,--come often,\r\nAunt. Now please help lift me up, and see if I can rest a little."\r\n\r\nFrado was called in, and Susan and Mrs. B. all attempted; Mrs. B. was\r\ntoo weak; she did not feel able to lift so much. So the three succeeded\r\nin relieving the sufferer.\r\n\r\nFrado returned to her work. Mrs. B. followed. Seizing Frado, she said\r\nshe would "cure her of tale-bearing," and, placing the wedge of wood\r\nbetween her teeth, she beat her cruelly with the raw-hide. Aunt Abby\r\nheard the blows, and came to see if she could hinder them.\r\n\r\nSurprised at her sudden appearance, Mrs. B. suddenly stopped, but\r\nforbade her removing the wood till she gave her permission, and\r\ncommanded Nab to go home.\r\n\r\nShe was thus tortured when Mr. Bellmont came in, and, making inquiries\r\nwhich she did not, because she could not, answer, approached her; and\r\nseeing her situation, quickly removed the instrument of torture, and\r\nsought his wife. Their conversation we will omit; suffice it to say, a\r\nstorm raged which required many days to exhaust its strength.\r\n\r\nFrado was becoming seriously ill. She had no relish for food, and was\r\nconstantly overworked, and then she had such solicitude about the\r\nfuture. She wished to pray for pardon. She did try to pray. Her mistress\r\nhad told her it would "do no good for her to attempt prayer; prayer was\r\nfor whites, not for blacks. If she minded her mistress, and did what she\r\ncommanded, it was all that was required of her."\r\n\r\nThis did not satisfy her, or appease her longings. She knew her\r\ninstructions did not harmonize with those of the man of God or Aunt\r\nAbby\'s. She resolved to persevere. She said nothing on the subject,\r\nunless asked. It was evident to all her mind was deeply exercised. James\r\nlonged to speak with her alone on the subject. An opportunity presented\r\nsoon, while the family were at tea. It was usual to summon Aunt Abby to\r\nkeep company with her, as his death was expected hourly.\r\n\r\nAs she took her accustomed seat, he asked, "Are you afraid to stay with\r\nme alone, Frado?"\r\n\r\n"No," she replied, and stepped to the window to conceal her emotion.\r\n\r\n"Come here, and sit by me; I wish to talk with you."\r\n\r\nShe approached him, and, taking her hand, he remarked:\r\n\r\n"How poor you are, Frado! I want to tell you that I fear I shall never\r\nbe able to talk with you again. It is the last time, perhaps, I shall\r\nEVER talk with you. You are old enough to remember my dying words and\r\nprofit by them. I have been sick a long time; I shall die pretty soon.\r\nMy Heavenly Father is calling me home. Had it been his will to let me\r\nlive I should take you to live with me; but, as it is, I shall go and\r\nleave you. But, Frado, if you will be a good girl, and love and serve\r\nGod, it will be but a short time before we are in a HEAVENLY home\r\ntogether. There will never be any sickness or sorrow there."\r\n\r\nFrado, overcome with grief, sobbed, and buried her face in his pillow.\r\nShe expected he would die; but to hear him speak of his departure\r\nhimself was unexpected.\r\n\r\n"Bid me good bye, Frado."\r\n\r\nShe kissed him, and sank on her knees by his bedside; his hand rested on\r\nher head; his eyes were closed; his lips moved in prayer for this\r\ndisconsolate child.\r\n\r\nHis wife entered, and interpreting the scene, gave him some\r\nrestoratives, and withdrew for a short time.\r\n\r\nIt was a great effort for Frado to cease sobbing; but she dared not be\r\nseen below in tears; so she choked her grief, and descended to her usual\r\ntoil. Susan perceived a change in her husband. She felt that death was\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nHe tenderly looked on her, and said, "Susan, my wife, our farewells are\r\nall spoken. I feel prepared to go. I shall meet you in heaven. Death is\r\nindeed creeping fast upon me. Let me see them all once more. Teach\r\nCharlie the way to heaven; lead him up as you come."\r\n\r\nThe family all assembled. He could not talk as he wished to them. He\r\nseemed to sink into unconsciousness. They watched him for hours. He had\r\nlabored hard for breath some time, when he seemed to awake suddenly, and\r\nexclaimed, "Hark! do you hear it?"\r\n\r\n"Hear what, my son?" asked the father.\r\n\r\n"Their call. Look, look, at the shining ones! Oh, let me go and be at\r\nrest!"\r\n\r\nAs if waiting for this petition, the Angel of Death severed the golden\r\nthread, and he was in heaven. At midnight the messenger came.\r\n\r\nThey called Frado to see his last struggle. Sinking on her knees at the\r\nfoot of his bed, she buried her face in the clothes, and wept like one\r\ninconsolable. They led her from the room. She seemed to be too much\r\nabsorbed to know it was necessary for her to leave. Next day she would\r\nsteal into the chamber as often as she could, to weep over his remains,\r\nand ponder his last words to her. She moved about the house like an\r\nautomaton. Every duty performed--but an abstraction from all, which\r\nshewed her thoughts were busied elsewhere. Susan wished her to attend\r\nhis burial as one of the family. Lewis and Mary and Jack it was not\r\nthought best to send for, as the season would not allow them time for\r\nthe journey. Susan provided her with a dress for the occasion, which was\r\nher first intimation that she would be allowed to mingle her grief with\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe day of the burial she was attired in her mourning dress; but Susan,\r\nin her grief, had forgotten a bonnet.\r\n\r\nShe hastily ransacked the closets, and found one of Mary\'s, trimmed with\r\nbright pink ribbon.\r\n\r\nIt was too late to change the ribbon, and she was unwilling to leave\r\nFrado at home; she knew it would be the wish of James she should go with\r\nher. So tying it on, she said, "Never mind, Frado, you shall see where\r\nour dear James is buried." As she passed out, she heard the whispers of\r\nthe by-standers, "Look there! see there! how that looks,--a black dress\r\nand a pink ribbon!"\r\n\r\nAnother time, such remarks would have wounded Frado. She had now a\r\nsorrow with which such were small in comparison.\r\n\r\nAs she saw his body lowered in the grave she wished to share it; but she\r\nwas not fit to die. She could not go where he was if she did. She did\r\nnot love God; she did not serve him or know how to.\r\n\r\nShe retired at night to mourn over her unfitness for heaven, and gaze\r\nout upon the stars, which, she felt, studded the entrance of heaven,\r\nabove which James reposed in the bosom of Jesus, to which her desires\r\nwere hastening. She wished she could see God, and ask him for eternal\r\nlife. Aunt Abby had taught her that He was ever looking upon her. Oh, if\r\nshe could see him, or hear him speak words of forgiveness. Her anxiety\r\nincreased; her health seemed impaired, and she felt constrained to go to\r\nAunt Abby and tell her all about her conflicts.\r\n\r\nShe received her like a returning wanderer; seriously urged her to\r\naccept of Christ; explained the way; read to her from the Bible, and\r\nremarked upon such passages as applied to her state. She warned her\r\nagainst stifling that voice which was calling her to heaven; echoed the\r\nfarewell words of James, and told her to come to her with her\r\ndifficulties, and not to delay a duty so important as attention to the\r\ntruths of religion, and her soul\'s interests.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bellmont would occasionally give instruction, though far different.\r\nShe would tell her she could not go where James was; she need not try.\r\nIf she should get to heaven at all, she would never be as high up as he.\r\n\r\nHE was the attraction. Should she "want to go there if she could not see\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\nMrs. B. seldom mentioned her bereavement, unless in such allusion to\r\nFrado. She donned her weeds from custom; kept close her crape veil for\r\nso many Sabbaths, and abated nothing of her characteristic harshness.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman called to minister consolation to the afflicted widow and\r\nmother. Aunt Abby seeing him approach the dwelling, knew at once the\r\nobject of his visit, and followed him to the parlor, unasked by Mrs. B!\r\nWhat a daring affront! The good man dispensed the consolations, of which\r\nhe was steward, to the apparently grief-smitten mother, who talked like\r\none schooled in a heavenly atmosphere. Such resignation expressed, as\r\nmight have graced the trial of the holiest. Susan, like a mute sufferer,\r\nbared her soul to his sympathy and godly counsel, but only replied to\r\nhis questions in short syllables. When he offered prayer, Frado stole to\r\nthe door that she might hear of the heavenly bliss of one who was her\r\nfriend on earth. The prayer caused profuse weeping, as any tender\r\nreminder of the heaven-born was sure to. When the good man\'s voice\r\nceased, she returned to her toil, carefully removing all trace of\r\nsorrow. Her mistress soon followed, irritated by Nab\'s impudence in\r\npresenting herself unasked in the parlor, and upbraided her with\r\nindolence, and bade her apply herself more diligently. Stung by\r\nunmerited rebuke, weak from sorrow and anxiety, the tears rolled down\r\nher dark face, soon followed by sobs, and then losing all control of\r\nherself, she wept aloud. This was an act of disobedience. Her mistress\r\ngrasping her raw-hide, caused a longer flow of tears, and wounded a\r\nspirit that was craving healing mercies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPERPLEXITIES.--ANOTHER DEATH.\r\n\r\n    Neath the billows of the ocean,\r\n    Hidden treasures wait the hand,\r\n    That again to light shall raise them\r\n    With the diver\'s magic wand.\r\n\r\n    G. W. COOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE family, gathered by James\' decease, returned to their homes. Susan\r\nand Charles returned to Baltimore. Letters were received from the\r\nabsent, expressing their sympathy and grief. The father bowed like a\r\n"bruised reed," under the loss of his beloved son. He felt desirous to\r\ndie the death of the righteous; also, conscious that he was unprepared,\r\nhe resolved to start on the narrow way, and some time solicit entrance\r\nthrough the gate which leads to the celestial city. He acknowledged his\r\ntoo ready acquiescence with Mrs. B., in permitting Frado to be deprived\r\nof her only religious privileges for weeks together. He accordingly\r\nasked his sister to take her to meeting once more, which she was ready\r\nat once to do.\r\n\r\nThe first opportunity they once more attended meeting together. The\r\nminister conversed faithfully with every person present. He was\r\nsurprised to find the little colored girl so solicitous, and kindly\r\ndirected her to the flowing fountain where she might wash and be clean.\r\nHe inquired of the origin of her anxiety, of her progress up to this\r\ntime, and endeavored to make Christ, instead of James, the attraction of\r\nHeaven. He invited her to come to his house, to speak freely her mind to\r\nhim, to pray much, to read her Bible often.\r\n\r\nThe neighbors, who were at meeting,--among them Mrs. Reed,--discussed\r\nthe opinions Mrs. Bellmont would express on the subject. Mrs. Reed\r\ncalled and informed Mrs. B. that her colored girl "related her\r\nexperience the other night at the meeting."\r\n\r\n"What experience?" asked she, quickly, as if she expected to hear the\r\nnumber of times she had whipped Frado, and the number of lashes set\r\nforth in plain Arabic numbers.\r\n\r\n"Why, you know she is serious, don\'t you? She told the minister about\r\nit."\r\n\r\nMrs. B. made no reply, but changed the subject adroitly. Next morning\r\nshe told Frado she "should not go out of the house for one while, except\r\non errands; and if she did not stop trying to be religious, she would\r\nwhip her to death."\r\n\r\nFrado pondered; her mistress was a professor of religion; was SHE going\r\nto heaven? then she did not wish to go. If she should be near James,\r\neven, she could not be happy with those fiery eyes watching her\r\nascending path. She resolved to give over all thought of the future\r\nworld, and strove daily to put her anxiety far from her.\r\n\r\nMr. Bellmont found himself unable to do what James or Jack could\r\naccomplish for her. He talked with her seriously, told her he had seen\r\nher many times punished undeservedly; he did not wish to have her saucy\r\nor disrespectful, but when she was SURE she did not deserve a whipping,\r\nto avoid it if she could. "You are looking sick," he added, "you cannot\r\nendure beating as you once could."\r\n\r\nIt was not long before an opportunity offered of profiting by his\r\nadvice. She was sent for wood, and not returning as soon as Mrs. B.\r\ncalculated, she followed her, and, snatching from the pile a stick,\r\nraised it over her.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" shouted Frado, "strike me, and I\'ll never work a mite more for\r\nyou;" and throwing down what she had gathered, stood like one who feels\r\nthe stirring of free and independent thoughts.\r\n\r\nBy this unexpected demonstration, her mistress, in amazement, dropped\r\nher weapon, desisting from her purpose of chastisement. Frado walked\r\ntowards the house, her mistress following with the wood she herself was\r\nsent after. She did not know, before, that she had a power to ward off\r\nassaults. Her triumph in seeing her enter the door with HER burden,\r\nrepaid her for much of her former suffering.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Mrs. B. never to rise in her majesty, unless\r\nshe was sure she should be victorious.\r\n\r\nThis affair never met with an "after clap," like many others.\r\n\r\nThus passed a year. The usual amount of scolding, but fewer whippings.\r\nMrs. B. longed once more for Mary\'s return, who had been absent over a\r\nyear; and she wrote imperatively for her to come quickly to her. A\r\nletter came in reply, announcing that she would comply as soon as she\r\nwas sufficiently recovered from an illness which detained her.\r\n\r\nNo serious apprehensions were cherished by either parent, who constantly\r\nlooked for notice of her arrival, by mail. Another letter brought\r\ntidings that Mary was seriously ill; her mother\'s presence was\r\nsolicited.\r\n\r\nShe started without delay. Before she reached her destination, a letter\r\ncame to the parents announcing her death.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the astounding news received, than Frado rushed into Aunt\r\nAbby\'s, exclaiming:--\r\n\r\n"She\'s dead, Aunt Abby!"\r\n\r\n"Who?" she asked, terrified by the unprefaced announcement.\r\n\r\n"Mary; they\'ve just had a letter."\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. B. was away, the brother and sister could freely sympathize, and\r\nshe sought him in this fresh sorrow, to communicate such solace as she\r\ncould, and to learn particulars of Mary\'s untimely death, and assist him\r\nin his journey thither.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a thanksgiving to Frado. Every hour or two she would pop in\r\ninto Aunt Abby\'s room with some strange query:\r\n\r\n"She got into the RIVER again, Aunt Abby, didn\'t she; the Jordan is a\r\nbig one to tumble into, any how. S\'posen she goes to hell, she\'ll be as\r\nblack as I am. Wouldn\'t mistress be mad to see her a nigger!" and others\r\nof a similar stamp, not at all acceptable to the pious, sympathetic\r\ndame; but she could not evade them.\r\n\r\nThe family returned from their sorrowful journey, leaving the dead\r\nbehind. Nig looked for a change in her tyrant; what could subdue her, if\r\nthe loss of her idol could not?\r\n\r\nNever was Mrs. B. known to shed tears so profusely, as when she\r\nreiterated to one and another the sad particulars of her darling\'s\r\nsickness and death. There was, indeed, a season of quiet grief; it was\r\nthe lull of the fiery elements. A few weeks revived the former tempests,\r\nand so at variance did they seem with chastisement sanctified, that\r\nFrado felt them to be unbearable. She determined to flee. But where? Who\r\nwould take her? Mrs. B. had always represented her ugly. Perhaps every\r\none thought her so. Then no one would take her. She was black, no one\r\nwould love her. She might have to return, and then she would be more in\r\nher mistress\' power than ever.\r\n\r\nShe remembered her victory at the wood-pile. She decided to remain to do\r\nas well as she could; to assert her rights when they were trampled on;\r\nto return once more to her meeting in the evening, which had been\r\nprohibited. She had learned how to conquer; she would not abuse the\r\npower while Mr. Bellmont was at home.\r\n\r\nBut had she not better run away? Where? She had never been from the\r\nplace far enough to decide what course to take. She resolved to speak to\r\nAunt Abby. SHE mapped the dangers of her course, her liability to fail\r\nin finding so good friends as John and herself. Frado\'s mind was busy\r\nfor days and nights. She contemplated administering poison to her\r\nmistress, to rid herself and the house of so detestable a plague.\r\n\r\nBut she was restrained by an overruling Providence; and finally decided\r\nto stay contentedly through her period of service, which would expire\r\nwhen she was eighteen years of age.\r\n\r\nIn a few months Jane returned home with her family, to relieve her\r\nparents, upon whom years and affliction had left the marks of age. The\r\nyears intervening since she had left her home, had, in some degree,\r\nsoftened the opposition to her unsanctioned marriage with George. The\r\nmore Mrs. B. had about her, the more energetic seemed her directing\r\ncapabilities, and her fault-finding propensities. Her own, she had full\r\npower over; and Jane after vain endeavors, became disgusted, weary, and\r\nperplexed, and decided that, though her mother might suffer, she could\r\nnot endure her home. They followed Jack to the West. Thus vanished all\r\nhopes of sympathy or relief from this source to Frado. There seemed no\r\none capable of enduring the oppressions of the house but her. She turned\r\nto the darkness of the future with the determination previously formed,\r\nto remain until she should be eighteen. Jane begged her to follow her so\r\nsoon as she should be released; but so wearied out was she by her\r\nmistress, she felt disposed to flee from any and every one having her\r\nsimilitude of name or feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE AGAIN.\r\n\r\n    Crucified the hopes that cheered me,\r\n    All that to the earth endeared me;\r\n    Love of wealth and fame and power,\r\n    Love,--all have been crucified.\r\n\r\n    C. E.\r\n\r\n\r\nDARKNESS before day. Jane left, but Jack was now to come again. After\r\nMary\'s death he visited home, leaving a wife behind. An orphan whose\r\nhome was with a relative, gentle, loving, the true mate of kind,\r\ngenerous Jack. His mother was a stranger to her, of course, and had\r\nperfect right to interrogate:\r\n\r\n"Is she good looking, Jack?" asked his mother.\r\n\r\n"Looks well to me," was the laconic reply.\r\n\r\n"Was her FATHER rich?"\r\n\r\n"Not worth a copper, as I know of; I never asked him," answered Jack.\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t she any property? What did you marry her for," asked his mother.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s WORTH A MILLION dollars, mother, though not a cent of it is\r\nin money."\r\n\r\n"Jack! what do you want to bring such a poor being into the family, for?\r\nYou\'d better stay here, at home, and let your wife go. Why couldn\'t you\r\ntry to do better, and not disgrace your parents?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t judge, till you see her," was Jack\'s reply, and immediately\r\nchanged the subject. It was no recommendation to his mother, and she did\r\nnot feel prepared to welcome her cordially now he was to come with his\r\nwife. He was indignant at his mother\'s advice to desert her. It rankled\r\nbitterly in his soul, the bare suggestion. He had more to bring. He now\r\ncame with a child also. He decided to leave the West, but not his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nUpon their arrival, Mrs. B. extended a cold welcome to her new daughter,\r\neyeing her dress with closest scrutiny. Poverty was to her a disgrace,\r\nand she could not associate with any thus dishonored. This coldness was\r\nfelt by Jack\'s worthy wife, who only strove the harder to recommend\r\nherself by her obliging, winning ways.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. could never let Jack be with her alone without complaining of\r\nthis or that deficiency in his wife.\r\n\r\nHe cared not so long as the complaints were piercing his own ears. He\r\nwould not have Jenny disquieted. He passed his time in seeking\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nA letter came from his brother Lewis, then at the South, soliciting his\r\nservices. Leaving his wife, he repaired thither.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. felt that great restraint was removed, that Jenny was more in\r\nher own power. She wished to make her feel her inferiority; to relieve\r\nJack of his burden if he would not do it himself. She watched her\r\nincessantly, to catch at some act of Jenny\'s which might be construed\r\ninto conjugal unfaithfulness.\r\n\r\nNear by were a family of cousins, one a young man of Jack\'s age, who,\r\nfrom love to his cousin, proffered all needful courtesy to his stranger\r\nrelative. Soon news reached Jack that Jenny was deserting her covenant\r\nvows, and had formed an illegal intimacy with his cousin. Meantime Jenny\r\nwas told by her mother-inlaw that Jack did not marry her untrammelled.\r\nHe had another love whom he would be glad, even now, if he could, to\r\nmarry. It was very doubtful if he ever came for her.\r\n\r\nJenny would feel pained by her unwelcome gossip, and, glancing at her\r\nchild, she decided, however true it might be, she had a pledge which\r\nwould enchain him yet. Ere long, the mother\'s inveterate hate crept out\r\ninto some neighbor\'s enclosure, and, caught up hastily, they passed the\r\nsecret round till it became none, and Lewis was sent for, the brother by\r\nwhom Jack was employed. The neighbors saw her fade in health and\r\nspirits; they found letters never reached their destination when sent by\r\neither. Lewis arrived with the joyful news that he had come to take\r\nJenny home with him.\r\n\r\nWhat a relief to her to be freed from the gnawing taunts of her\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nJenny retired to prepare for the journey, and Mrs. B. and Henry had a\r\nlong interview. Next morning he informed Jenny that new clothes would be\r\nnecessary, in order to make her presentable to Baltimore society, and he\r\nshould return without her, and she must stay till she was suitably\r\nattired.\r\n\r\nDisheartened, she rushed to her room, and, after relief from weeping,\r\nwrote to Jack to come; to have pity on her, and take her to him. No\r\nanswer came. Mrs. Smith, a neighbor, watchful and friendly, suggested\r\nthat she write away from home, and employ some one to carry it to the\r\noffice who would elude Mrs. B., who, they very well knew, had\r\nintercepted Jenny\'s letter, and influenced Lewis to leave her behind.\r\nShe accepted the offer, and Frado succeeded in managing the affair so\r\nthat Jack soon came to the rescue, angry, wounded, and forever after\r\nalienated from his early home and his mother. Many times would Frado\r\nsteal up into Jenny\'s room, when she knew she was tortured by her\r\nmistress\' malignity, and tell some of her own encounters with her, and\r\ntell her she might "be sure it wouldn\'t kill her, for she should have\r\ndied long before at the same treatment."\r\n\r\nSusan and her child succeeded Jenny as visitors. Frado had merged into\r\nwomanhood, and, retaining what she had learned, in spite of the few\r\nprivileges enjoyed formerly, was striving to enrich her mind. Her\r\nschool-books were her constant companions, and every leisure moment was\r\napplied to them. Susan was delighted to witness her progress, and some\r\nlittle book from her was a reward sufficient for any task imposed,\r\nhowever difficult. She had her book always fastened open near her, where\r\nshe could glance from toil to soul refreshment. The approaching spring\r\nwould close the term of years which Mrs. B. claimed as the period of her\r\nservitude. Often as she passed the waymarks of former years did she\r\npause to ponder on her situation, and wonder if she COULD succeed in\r\nproviding for her own wants. Her health was delicate, yet she resolved\r\nto try.\r\n\r\nSoon she counted the time by days which should release her. Mrs. B. felt\r\nthat she could not well spare one who could so well adapt herself to all\r\ndepartments--man, boy, housekeeper, domestic, etc. She begged Mrs. Smith\r\nto talk with her, to show her how ungrateful it would appear to leave a\r\nhome of such comfort--how wicked it was to be ungrateful! But Frado\r\nreplied that she had had enough of such comforts; she wanted some new\r\nones; and as it was so wicked to be ungrateful, she would go from\r\ntemptation; Aunt Abby said "we mustn\'t put ourselves in the way of\r\ntemptation."\r\n\r\nPoor little Fido! She shed more tears over him than over all beside.\r\n\r\nThe morning for departure dawned. Frado engaged to work for a family a\r\nmile distant. Mrs. Bellmont dismissed her with the assurance that she\r\nwould soon wish herself back again, and a present of a silver\r\nhalf-dollar.\r\n\r\nHer wardrobe consisted of one decent dress, without any superfluous\r\naccompaniments. A Bible from Susan she felt was her greatest treasure.\r\n\r\nNow was she alone in the world. The past year had been one of suffering\r\nresulting from a fall, which had left her lame.\r\n\r\nThe first summer passed pleasantly, and the wages earned were expended\r\nin garments necessary for health and cleanliness. Though feeble, she was\r\nwell satisfied with her progress. Shut up in her room, after her toil\r\nwas finished, she studied what poor samples of apparel she had, and, for\r\nthe first time, prepared her own garments.\r\n\r\nMrs. Moore, who employed her, was a kind friend to her, and attempted to\r\nheal her wounded spirit by sympathy and advice, burying the past in the\r\nprospects of the future. But her failing health was a cloud no kindly\r\nhuman hand could dissipate. A little light work was all she could\r\naccomplish. A clergyman, whose family was small, sought her, and she was\r\nremoved there. Her engagement with Mrs. Moore finished in the fall.\r\nFrado was anxious to keep up her reputation for efficiency, and often\r\npressed far beyond prudence. In the winter she entirely gave up work,\r\nand confessed herself thoroughly sick. Mrs. Hale, soon overcome by\r\nadditional cares, was taken sick also, and now it became necessary to\r\nadopt some measures for Frado\'s comfort, as well as to relieve Mrs.\r\nHale. Such dark forebodings as visited her as she lay, solitary and sad,\r\nno moans or sighs could relieve.\r\n\r\nThe family physician pronounced her case one of doubtful issue. Frado\r\nhoped it was final. She could not feel relentings that her former home\r\nwas abandoned, and yet, should she be in need of succor could she obtain\r\nit from one who would now so grudgingly bestow it? The family were\r\napplied to, and it was decided to take her there. She was removed to a\r\nroom built out from the main building, used formerly as a workshop,\r\nwhere cold and rain found unobstructed access, and here she fought with\r\nbitter reminiscences and future prospects till she became reckless of\r\nher faith and hopes and person, and half wished to end what nature\r\nseemed so tardily to take.\r\n\r\nAunt Abby made her frequent visits, and at last had her removed to her\r\nown apartment, where she might supply her wants, and minister to her\r\nonce more in heavenly things.\r\n\r\nThen came the family consultation.\r\n\r\n"What is to be done with her," asked Mrs. B., "after she is moved there\r\nwith Nab?"\r\n\r\n"Send for the Dr., your brother," Mr. B. replied.\r\n\r\n"When?"\r\n\r\n"To-night."\r\n\r\n"To-night! and for her! Wait till morning," she continued.\r\n\r\n"She has waited too long now; I think something should be done soon."\r\n\r\n"I doubt if she is much sick," sharply interrupted Mrs. B.\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ll see what our brother thinks."\r\n\r\nHis coming was longed for by Frado, who had known him well during her\r\nlong sojourn in the family; and his praise of her nice butter and\r\ncheese, from which his table was supplied, she knew he felt as well as\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n"You\'re sick, very sick," he said, quickly, after a moment\'s pause.\r\n"Take good care of her, Abby, or she\'ll never get well. All broken\r\ndown."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was at Mrs. Moore\'s," said Mrs. B., "all this was done. She did\r\nbut little the latter part of the time she was here."\r\n\r\n"It was commenced longer ago than last summer. Take good care of her;\r\nshe may never get well," remarked the Dr.\r\n\r\n"We sha\'n\'t pay you for doctoring her; you may look to the town for\r\nthat, sir," said Mrs. B., and abruptly left the room.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear! oh dear!" exclaimed Frado, and buried her face in the pillow.\r\n\r\nA few kind words of consolation, and she was once more alone in the\r\ndarkness which enveloped her previous days. Yet she felt sure they owed\r\nher a shelter and attention, when disabled, and she resolved to feel\r\npatient, and remain till she could help herself. Mrs. B. would not\r\nattend her, nor permit her domestic to stay with her at all. Aunt Abby\r\nwas her sole comforter. Aunt Abby\'s nursing had the desired effect, and\r\nshe slowly improved. As soon as she was able to be moved, the kind Mrs.\r\nMoore took her to her home again, and completed what Aunt Abby had so\r\nwell commenced. Not that she was well, or ever would be; but she had\r\nrecovered so far as rendered it hopeful she might provide for her own\r\nwants. The clergyman at whose house she was taken sick, was now seeking\r\nsome one to watch his sick children, and as soon as he heard of her\r\nrecovery, again asked for her services.\r\n\r\nWhat seemed so light and easy to others, was too much for Frado; and it\r\nbecame necessary to ask once more where the sick should find an asylum.\r\n\r\nAll felt that the place where her declining health began, should be the\r\nplace of relief; so they applied once more for a shelter.\r\n\r\n"No," exclaimed the indignant Mrs. B., "she shall never come under this\r\nroof again; never! never!" she repeated, as if each repetition were a\r\nbolt to prevent admission.\r\n\r\nOne only resource; the public must pay the expense. So she was removed\r\nto the home of two maidens, (old,) who had principle enough to be\r\nwilling to earn the money a charitable public disburses.\r\n\r\nThree years of weary sickness wasted her, without extinguishing a life\r\napparently so feeble. Two years had these maidens watched and cared for\r\nher, and they began to weary, and finally to request the authorities to\r\nremove her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hoggs was a lover of gold and silver, and she asked the favor of\r\nfilling her coffers by caring for the sick. The removal caused severe\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nBy being bolstered in the bed, after a time she could use her hands, and\r\noften would ask for sewing to beguile the tedium. She had become very\r\nexpert with her needle the first year of her release from Mrs. B., and\r\nshe had forgotten none of her skill. Mrs. H. praised her, and as she\r\nimproved in health, was anxious to employ her. She told her she could in\r\nthis way replace her clothes, and as her board would be paid for, she\r\nwould thus gain something.\r\n\r\nMany times her hands wrought when her body was in pain; but the hope\r\nthat she might yet help herself, impelled her on.\r\n\r\nThus she reckoned her store of means by a few dollars, and was hoping\r\nsoon to come in possession, when she was startled by the announcement\r\nthat Mrs. Hoggs had reported her to the physician and town officers as\r\nan impostor. That she was, in truth, able to get up and go to work.\r\n\r\nThis brought on a severe sickness of two weeks, when Mrs. Moore again\r\nsought her, and took her to her home. She had formerly had wealth at her\r\ncommand, but misfortune had deprived her of it, and unlocked her heart\r\nto sympathies and favors she had never known while it lasted. Her\r\nhusband, defrauded of his last means by a branch of the Bellmont family,\r\nhad supported them by manual labor, gone to the West, and left his wife\r\nand four young children. But she felt humanity required her to give a\r\nshelter to one she knew to be worthy of a hospitable reception. Mrs.\r\nMoore\'s physician was called, and pronounced her a very sick girl, and\r\nencouraged Mrs. M. to keep her and care for her, and he would see that\r\nthe authorities were informed of Frado\'s helplessness, and pledged\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nHere she remained till sufficiently restored to sew again. Then came the\r\nold resolution to take care of herself, to cast off the unpleasant\r\ncharities of the public.\r\n\r\nShe learned that in some towns in Massachusetts, girls make straw\r\nbonnets--that it was easy and profitable. But how should SHE, black,\r\nfeeble and poor, find any one to teach her. But God prepares the way,\r\nwhen human agencies see no path. Here was found a plain, poor, simple\r\nwoman, who could see merit beneath a dark skin; and when the invalid\r\nmulatto told her sorrows, she opened her door and her heart, and took\r\nthe stranger in. Expert with the needle, Frado soon equalled her\r\ninstructress; and she sought also to teach her the value of useful\r\nbooks; and while one read aloud to the other of deeds historic and names\r\nrenowned, Frado experienced a new impulse. She felt herself capable of\r\nelevation; she felt that this book information supplied an undefined\r\ndissatisfaction she had long felt, but could not express. Every leisure\r\nmoment was carefully applied to self-improvement, and a devout and\r\nChristian exterior invited confidence from the villagers. Thus she\r\npassed months of quiet, growing in the confidence of her neighbors and\r\nnew found friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE WINDING UP OF THE MATTER.\r\n\r\n    Nothing new under the sun.\r\n\r\n    SOLOMON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW years ago, within the compass of my narrative, there appeared\r\noften in some of our New England villages, professed fugitives from\r\nslavery, who recounted their personal experience in homely phrase, and\r\nawakened the indignation of non-slaveholders against brother Pro. Such a\r\none appeared in the new home of Frado; and as people of color were rare\r\nthere, was it strange she should attract her dark brother; that he\r\nshould inquire her out; succeed in seeing her; feel a strange sensation\r\nin his heart towards her; that he should toy with her shining curls,\r\nfeel proud to provoke her to smile and expose the ivory concealed by\r\nthin, ruby lips; that her sparkling eyes should fascinate; that he\r\nshould propose; that they should marry? A short acquaintance was indeed\r\nan objection, but she saw him often, and thought she knew him. He never\r\nspoke of his enslavement to her when alone, but she felt that, like her\r\nown oppression, it was painful to disturb oftener than was needful.\r\n\r\nHe was a fine, straight negro, whose back showed no marks of the lash,\r\nerect as if it never crouched beneath a burden. There was a silent\r\nsympathy which Frado felt attracted her, and she opened her heart to the\r\npresence of love--that arbitrary and inexorable tyrant.\r\n\r\nShe removed to Singleton, her former residence, and there was married.\r\nHere were Frado\'s first feelings of trust and repose on human arm. She\r\nrealized, for the first time, the relief of looking to another for\r\ncomfortable support. Occasionally he would leave her to "lecture."\r\n\r\nThose tours were prolonged often to weeks. Of course he had little spare\r\nmoney. Frado was again feeling her self-dependence, and was at last\r\ncompelled to resort alone to that. Samuel was kind to her when at home,\r\nbut made no provision for his absence, which was at last unprecedented.\r\n\r\nHe left her to her fate--embarked at sea, with the disclosure that he\r\nhad never seen the South, and that his illiterate harangues were humbugs\r\nfor hungry abolitionists. Once more alone! Yet not alone. A still newer\r\ncompanionship would soon force itself upon her. No one wanted her with\r\nsuch prospects. Herself was burden enough; who would have an additional\r\none?\r\n\r\nThe horrors of her condition nearly prostrated her, and she was again\r\nthrown upon the public for sustenance. Then followed the birth of her\r\nchild. The long absent Samuel unexpectedly returned, and rescued her\r\nfrom charity. Recovering from her expected illness, she once more\r\ncommenced toil for herself and child, in a room obtained of a poor\r\nwoman, but with better fortune. One so well known would not be wholly\r\nneglected. Kind friends watched her when Samuel was from home, prevented\r\nher from suffering, and when the cold weather pinched the warmly clad, a\r\nkind friend took them in, and thus preserved them. At last Samuel\'s\r\nbusiness became very engrossing, and after long desertion, news reached\r\nhis family that he had become a victim of yellow fever, in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nSo much toil as was necessary to sustain Frado, was more than she could\r\nendure. As soon as her babe could be nourished without his mother, she\r\nleft him in charge of a Mrs. Capon, and procured an agency, hoping to\r\nrecruit her health, and gain an easier livelihood for herself and child.\r\nThis afforded her better maintenance than she had yet found. She passed\r\ninto the various towns of the State she lived in, then into\r\nMassachusetts. Strange were some of her adventures. Watched by\r\nkidnappers, maltreated by professed abolitionists, who didn\'t want\r\nslaves at the South, nor niggers in their own houses, North. Faugh! to\r\nlodge one; to eat with one; to admit one through the front door; to sit\r\nnext one; awful!\r\n\r\nTraps slyly laid by the vicious to ensnare her, she resolutely avoided.\r\nIn one of her tours, Providence favored her with a friend who, pitying\r\nher cheerless lot, kindly provided her with a valuable recipe, from\r\nwhich she might herself manufacture a useful article for her\r\nmaintenance. This proved a more agreeable, and an easier way of\r\nsustenance.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, to the present time, may you see her busily employed in\r\npreparing her merchandise; then sallying forth to encounter many frowns,\r\nbut some kind friends and purchasers. Nothing turns her from her\r\nsteadfast purpose of elevating herself. Reposing on God, she has thus\r\nfar journeyed securely. Still an invalid, she asks your sympathy, gentle\r\nreader. Refuse not, because some part of her history is unknown, save by\r\nthe Omniscient God. Enough has been unrolled to demand your sympathy and\r\naid.\r\n\r\nDo you ask the destiny of those connected with her EARLY history? A few\r\nyears only have elapsed since Mr. and Mrs. B. passed into another world.\r\nAs age increased, Mrs. B. became more irritable, so that no one, even\r\nher own children, could remain with her; and she was accompanied by her\r\nhusband to the home of Lewis, where, after an agony in death\r\nunspeakable, she passed away. Only a few months since, Aunt Abby entered\r\nheaven. Jack and his wife rest in heaven, disturbed by no intruders; and\r\nSusan and her child are yet with the living. Jane has silver locks in\r\nplace of auburn tresses, but she has the early love of Henry still, and\r\nhas never regretted her exchange of lovers. Frado has passed from their\r\nmemories, as Joseph from the butler\'s, but she will never cease to track\r\nthem till beyond mortal vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n"TRUTH is stranger than fiction;" and whoever reads the narrative of\r\nAlfrado, will find the assertion verified.\r\n\r\nAbout eight years ago I became acquainted with the author of this book,\r\nand I feel it a privilege to speak a few words in her behalf. Through\r\nthe instrumentality of an itinerant colored lecturer, she was brought to\r\nW-----, Mass. This is an ancient town, where the mothers and daughters\r\nseek, not "wool and flax," but STRAW,--working willingly with their\r\nhands! Here she was introduced to the family of Mrs. Walker, who kindly\r\nconsented to receive her as an inmate of her household, and immediately\r\nsucceeded in procuring work for her as a "straw sewer." Being very\r\ningenious, she soon acquired the art of making hats; but on account of\r\nformer hard treatment, her constitution was greatly impaired, and she\r\nwas subject to seasons of sickness. On this account Mrs. W. gave her a\r\nroom joining her own chamber, where she could hear her faintest call.\r\nNever shall I forget the expression of her "black, but comely" face, as\r\nshe came to me one day, exclaiming, "O, aunt J-----, I have at last\r\nfound a HOME,--and not only a home, but a MOTHER. My cup runneth over.\r\nWhat shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?"\r\n\r\nMonths passed on, and she was HAPPY--truly happy. Her health began to\r\nimprove under the genial sunshine in which she lived, and she even\r\nlooked forward with HOPE--joyful hope to the future. But, alas, "it is\r\nnot in man that walketh to direct his steps." One beautiful morning in\r\nthe early spring of 1842, as she was taking her usual walk, she chanced\r\nto meet her old friend, the "lecturer," who brought her to W-----, and\r\nwith him was a fugitive slave. Young, well-formed and very handsome, he\r\nsaid he had been a HOUSE-servant, which seemed to account in some measure\r\nfor his gentlemanly manners and pleasing address. The meeting was\r\nentirely accidental; but it was a sad occurrence for poor Alfrado, as\r\nher own sequel tells. Suffice it to say, an acquaintance and attachment\r\nwas formed, which, in due time, resulted in marriage. In a few days she\r\nleft W-----, and ALL her home comforts, and took up her abode in New\r\nHampshire. For a while everything went on well, and she dreamed not of\r\ndanger; but in an evil hour he left his young and trusting wife, and\r\nembarked for sea. She knew nothing of all this, and waited for his\r\nreturn. But she waited in vain. Days passed, weeks passed, and he came\r\nnot; then her heart failed her. She felt herself deserted at a time,\r\nwhen, of all others, she most needed the care and soothing attentions of\r\na devoted husband. For a time she tried to sustain HERSELF, but this was\r\nimpossible. She had friends, but they were mostly of that class who are\r\npoor in the things of earth, but "rich in faith." The charity on which\r\nshe depended failed at last, and there was nothing to save her from the\r\n"County House;" GO SHE MUST. But her feelings on her way thither, and\r\nafter her arrival, can be given better in her own language; and I trust\r\nit will be no breach of confidence if I here insert part of a letter she\r\nwrote her mother Walker, concerning the matter.\r\n\r\n* * * "The evening before I left for my dreaded journey to the \'house\'\r\nwhich was to be my abode, I packed my trunk, carefully placing in it\r\nevery little memento of affection received from YOU and my friends in\r\nW-----, among which was the portable inkstand, pens and paper. My\r\nbeautiful little Bible was laid aside, as a place nearer my heart was\r\nreserved for that. I need not tell you I slept not a moment that night.\r\nMy home, my peaceful, quiet home with you, was before me. I could see my\r\ndear little room, with its pleasant eastern window opening to the\r\nmorning; but more than all, I beheld YOU, my mother, gliding softly in\r\nand kneeling by my bed to read, as no one but you CAN read, \'The Lord is\r\nmy shepherd,--I shall not want.\' But I cannot go on, for tears blind me.\r\nFor a description of the morning, and of the scant breakfast, I must\r\nwait until another time.\r\n\r\n"We started. The man who came for me was kind as he could be,--helped me\r\ncarefully into the wagon, (for I had no strength,) and drove on. For\r\nmiles I spoke not a word. Then the silence would be broken by the driver\r\nuttering some sort of word the horse seemed to understand; for he\r\ninvariably quickened his pace. And so, just before nightfall, we halted\r\nat the institution, prepared for the HOMELESS. With cold civility the\r\nmatron received me, and bade one of the inmates shew me my room. She did\r\nso; and I followed up two flights of stairs. I crept as I was able; and\r\nwhen she said, \'Go in there,\' I obeyed, asking for my trunk, which was\r\nsoon placed by me. My room was furnished some like the \'prophet\'s\r\nchamber,\' except there was no \'candlestick;\' so when I could creep down\r\nI begged for a light, and it was granted. Then I flung myself on the bed\r\nand cried, until I could cry no longer. I rose up and tried to pray; the\r\nSaviour seemed near. I opened my precious little Bible, and the first\r\nverse that caught my eye was--\'I am poor and needy, yet the Lord\r\nthinketh upon me.\' O, my mother, could I tell you the comfort this was\r\nto me. I sat down, calm, almost happy, took my pen and wrote on the\r\ninspiration of the moment--\r\n\r\n    "O, holy Father, by thy power,\r\n    Thus far in life I\'m brought;\r\n    And now in this dark, trying hour,\r\n    O God, forsake me not.\r\n\r\n    "Dids\'t thou not nourish and sustain\r\n    My infancy and youth?\r\n    Have I not testimonials plain,\r\n    Of thy unchanging truth?\r\n\r\n    "Though I\'ve no home to call my own,\r\n    My heart shall not repine;\r\n    The saint may live on earth unknown,\r\n    And yet in glory shine.\r\n\r\n    "When my Redeemer dwelt below,\r\n    He chose a lowly lot;\r\n    He came unto his own, but lo!\r\n    His own received him not.\r\n\r\n    "Oft was the mountain his abode,\r\n    The cold, cold earth his bed;\r\n    The midnight moon shone softly down\r\n    On his unsheltered head.\r\n\r\n\r\n"But MY head WAS SHELTERED, and I tried to feel thankful."\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTwo or three letters were received after this by her friends in W-----,\r\nand then all was silent. No one of us knew whether she still lived or\r\nhad gone to her home on high. But it seems she remained in this house\r\nuntil after the birth of her babe; then her faithless husband returned,\r\nand took her to some town in New Hampshire, where, for a time, he\r\nsupported her and his little son decently well. But again he left her as\r\nbefore--suddenly and unexpectedly, and she saw him no more. Her efforts\r\nwere again successful in a measure in securing a meagre maintenance for\r\na time; but her struggles with poverty and sickness were severe. At\r\nlength, a door of hope was opened. A kind gentleman and lady took her\r\nlittle boy into their own family, and provided everything necessary for\r\nhis good; and all this without the hope of remuneration. But let them\r\nknow, they shall be "recompensed at the resurrection of the just." God\r\nis not unmindful of this work,--this labor of love. As for the afflicted\r\nmother, she too has been remembered. The heart of a stranger was moved\r\nwith compassion, and bestowed a recipe upon her for restoring gray hair\r\nto its former color. She availed herself of this great help, and has\r\nbeen quite successful; but her health is again falling, and she has felt\r\nherself obliged to resort to another method of procuring her bread--that\r\nof writing an Autobiography.\r\n\r\nI trust she will find a ready sale for her interesting work; and let all\r\nthe friends who purchase a volume, remember they are doing good to one\r\nof the most worthy, and I had almost said most unfortunate, of the human\r\nfamily. I will only add in conclusion, a few lines, calculated to\r\ncomfort and strengthen this sorrowful, homeless one. "I will help thee,\r\nsaith the Lord."\r\n\r\n    "I will help thee," promise kind\r\n    Made by our High Priest above;\r\n    Soothing to the troubled mind,\r\n    Full of tenderness and love.\r\n\r\n    "I will help thee" when the storm\r\n    Gathers dark on every side;\r\n    Safely from impending harm,\r\n    In my sheltering bosom hide.\r\n\r\n    "I will help thee," weary saint,\r\n    Cast thy burdens ALL ON ME;\r\n    Oh, how cans\'t thou tire or faint,\r\n    While my arm encircles thee.\r\n\r\n    I have pitied every tear,\r\n    Heard and COUNTED every sigh;\r\n    Ever lend a gracious ear\r\n    To thy supplicating cry.\r\n    What though thy wounded bosom bleed,\r\n    Pierced by affliction\'s dart;\r\n    Do I not all thy sorrows heed,\r\n    And bear thee on my heart?\r\n    Soon will the lowly grave become\r\n    Thy quiet resting place;\r\n    Thy spirit find a peaceful home\r\n    In mansions NEAR MY FACE.\r\n\r\n    There are thy robes and glittering crown,\r\n    Outshining yonder sun;\r\n    Soon shalt thou lay the body down,\r\n    And put those glories on.\r\n\r\n    Long has thy golden lyre been strung,\r\n    Which angels cannot move;\r\n    No song to this is ever sung,\r\n    But bleeding, dying Love.\r\n\r\n    ALLIDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving known the writer of this book for a number of years, and knowing\r\nthe many privations and mortifications she has had to pass through, I\r\nthe more willingly add my testimony to the truth of her assertions. She\r\nis one of that class, who by some are considered not only as little\r\nlower than the angels, but far beneath them; but I have long since\r\nlearned that we are not to look at the color of the hair, the eyes, or\r\nthe skin, for the man or woman; their life is the criterion we are to\r\njudge by. The writer of this book has seemed to be a child of\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nEarly in life she was deprived of her parents, and all those endearing\r\nassociations to which childhood clings. Indeed, she may be said not to\r\nhave had that happy period; for, being taken from home so young, and\r\nplaced where she had nothing to love or cling to, I often wonder she had\r\nnot grown up a MONSTER; and those very people calling themselves\r\nChristians, (the good Lord deliver me from such,) and they likewise\r\nruined her health by hard work, both in the field and house. She was\r\nindeed a slave, in every sense of the word; and a lonely one, too.\r\n\r\nBut she has found some friends in this degraded world, that were willing\r\nto do by others as they would have others do by them; that were willing\r\nshe should live, and have an existence on the earth with them. She has\r\nnever enjoyed any degree of comfortable health since she was eighteen\r\nyears of age, and a great deal of the time has been confined to her room\r\nand bed. She is now trying to write a book; and I hope the public will\r\nlook favorably on it, and patronize the same, for she is a worthy woman.\r\n\r\nHer own health being poor, and having a child to care for, (for, by the\r\nway, she has been married,) and she wishes to educate him; in her\r\nsickness he has been taken from her, and sent to the county farm,\r\nbecause she could not pay his board every week; but as soon as she was\r\nable, she took him from that PLACE, and now he has a home where he is\r\ncontented and happy, and where he is considered as good as those he is\r\nwith. He is an intelligent, smart boy, and no doubt will make a smart\r\nman, if he is rightly managed. He is beloved by his playmates, and by\r\nall the friends of the family; for the family do not recognize those as\r\nfriends who do not include him in their family, or as one of them, and\r\nhis mother as a daughter--for they treat her as such; and she certainly\r\ndeserves all the affection and kindness that is bestowed upon her, and\r\nthey are always happy to have her visit them whenever she will. They are\r\nnot wealthy, but the latch-string is always out when suffering humanity\r\nneeds a shelter; the last loaf they are willing to divide with those\r\nmore needy than themselves, remembering these words, Do good as we have\r\nopportunity; and we can always find opportunity, if we have the\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nAnd now I would say, I hope those who call themselves friends of our\r\ndark-skinned brethren, will lend a helping hand, and assist our sister,\r\nnot in giving, but in buying a book; the expense is trifling, and the\r\nreward of doing good is great. Our duty is to our fellow-beings, and\r\nwhen we let an opportunity pass, we know not what we lose. Therefore we\r\nshould do with all our might what our hands find to do; and remember the\r\nwords of Him who went about doing good, that inasmuch as ye have done a\r\ngood deed to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to\r\nme; and even a cup of water is not forgotten. Therefore, let us work\r\nwhile the day lasts, and we shall in no wise lose our reward.\r\n\r\nMARGARETTA THORN.\r\n\r\nMILFORD, JULY 20th, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeling a deep interest in the welfare of the writer of this book, and\r\nhoping that its circulation will be extensive, I wish to say a few words\r\nin her behalf. I have been acquainted with her for several years, and\r\nhave always found her worthy the esteem of all friends of humanity; one\r\nwhose soul is alive to the work to which she puts her hand.. Although\r\nher complexion is a little darker than my own, I esteem it a privilege\r\nto associate with her, and assist her whenever an opportunity presents\r\nitself. It is with this motive that I write these few lines, knowing\r\nthis book must be interesting to all who have any knowledge of the\r\nwriter\'s character, or wish to have. I hope no one will refuse to aid\r\nher in her work, as she is worthy the sympathy of all Christians, and\r\nthose who have a spark of humanity in their breasts.\r\n\r\nThinking it unnecessary for me to write a long epistle, I will close by\r\nbidding her God speed.\r\n\r\nC.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
