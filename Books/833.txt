In such communities the distinction between\r\nclasses is very rigorously observed; and the feature of most striking\r\neconomic significance in these class differences is the distinction\r\nmaintained between the employments proper to the several classes.\r\nThe upper classes are by custom exempt or excluded from industrial\r\noccupations, and are reserved for certain employments to which a degree\r\nof honour attaches. Chief among the honourable employments in any\r\nfeudal community is warfare; and priestly service is commonly second to\r\nwarfare. If the barbarian community is not notably warlike, the priestly\r\noffice may take the precedence, with that of the warrior second. But the\r\nrule holds with but slight exceptions that, whether warriors or priests,\r\nthe upper classes are exempt from industrial employments, and this\r\nexemption is the economic expression of their superior rank. Brahmin\r\nIndia affords a fair illustration of the industrial exemption of both\r\nthese classes. In the communities belonging to the higher barbarian\r\nculture there is a considerable differentiation of sub-classes within\r\nwhat may be comprehensively called the leisure class; and there is a\r\ncorresponding differentiation of employments between these sub-classes.\r\nThe leisure class as a whole comprises the noble and the priestly\r\nclasses, together with much of their retinue. The occupations of the\r\nclass are correspondingly diversified; but they have the common economic\r\ncharacteristic of being non-industrial. These non-industrial upper-class\r\noccupations may be roughly comprised under government, warfare,\r\nreligious observances, and sports.\r\n\r\nAt an earlier, but not the earliest, stage of barbarism, the leisure\r\nclass is found in a less differentiated form. Neither the class\r\ndistinctions nor the distinctions between leisure-class occupations are\r\nso minute and intricate. The Polynesian islanders generally show this\r\nstage of the development in good form, with the exception that, owing\r\nto the absence of large game, hunting does not hold the usual place of\r\nhonour in their scheme of life. The Icelandic community in the time of\r\nthe Sagas also affords a fair instance. In such a community there is\r\na rigorous distinction between classes and between the occupations\r\npeculiar to each class. Manual labour, industry, whatever has to\r\ndo directly with the everyday work of getting a livelihood, is the\r\nexclusive occupation of the inferior class. This inferior class includes\r\nslaves and other dependents, and ordinarily also all the women. If there\r\nare several grades of aristocracy, the women of high rank are commonly\r\nexempt from industrial employment, or at least from the more vulgar\r\nkinds of manual labour. The men of the upper classes are not only\r\nexempt, but by prescriptive custom they are debarred, from all\r\nindustrial occupations. The range of employments open to them is rigidly\r\ndefined. As on the higher plane already spoken of, these employments are\r\ngovernment, warfare, religious observances, and sports. These four lines\r\nof activity govern the scheme of life of the upper classes, and for\r\nthe highest rank--the kings or chieftains--these are the only kinds of\r\nactivity that custom or the common sense of the community will allow.\r\nIndeed, where the scheme is well developed even sports are accounted\r\ndoubtfully legitimate for the members of the highest rank. To the lower\r\ngrades of the leisure class certain other employments are open, but they\r\nare employments that are subsidiary to one or another of these typical\r\nleisure-class occupations. Such are, for instance, the manufacture\r\nand care of arms and accoutrements and of war canoes, the dressing\r\nand handling of horses, dogs, and hawks, the preparation of sacred\r\napparatus, etc. The lower classes are excluded from these secondary\r\nhonourable employments, except from such as are plainly of an industrial\r\ncharacter and are only remotely related to the typical leisure-class\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nIf we go a step back of this exemplary barbarian culture, into the\r\nlower stages of barbarism, we no longer find the leisure class in fully\r\ndeveloped form. But this lower barbarism shows the usages, motives,\r\nand circumstances out of which the institution of a leisure class has\r\narisen, and indicates the steps of its early growth. Nomadic hunting\r\ntribes in various parts of the world illustrate these more primitive\r\nphases of the differentiation. Any one of the North American hunting\r\ntribes may be taken as a convenient illustration. These tribes\r\ncan scarcely be said to have a defined leisure class. There is a\r\ndifferentiation of function, and there is a distinction between classes\r\non the basis of this difference of function, but the exemption of the\r\nsuperior class from work has not gone far enough to make the designation\r\n"leisure class" altogether applicable. The tribes belonging on this\r\neconomic level have carried the economic differentiation to the point\r\nat which a marked distinction is made between the occupations of men and\r\nwomen, and this distinction is of an invidious character. In nearly\r\nall these tribes the women are, by prescriptive custom, held to those\r\nemployments out of which the industrial occupations proper develop at\r\nthe next advance. The men are exempt from these vulgar employments and\r\nare reserved for war, hunting, sports, and devout observances. A very\r\nnice discrimination is ordinarily shown in this matter.\r\n\r\nThis division of labour coincides with the distinction between the\r\nworking and the leisure class as it appears in the higher barbarian\r\nculture. As the diversification and specialisation of employments\r\nproceed, the line of demarcation so drawn comes to divide the industrial\r\nfrom the non-industrial employments. The man\'s occupation as it stands\r\nat the earlier barbarian stage is not the original out of which any\r\nappreciable portion of later industry has developed. In the later\r\ndevelopment it survives only in employments that are not classed as\r\nindustrial,--war, politics, sports, learning, and the priestly office.\r\nThe only notable exceptions are a portion of the fishery industry\r\nand certain slight employments that are doubtfully to be classed as\r\nindustry; such as the manufacture of arms, toys, and sporting goods.\r\nVirtually the whole range of industrial employments is an outgrowth of\r\nwhat is classed as woman\'s work in the primitive barbarian community.\r\n\r\nThe work of the men in the lower barbarian culture is no less\r\nindispensable to the life of the group than the work done by the women.\r\nIt may even be that the men\'s work contributes as much to the food\r\nsupply and the other necessary consumption of the group. Indeed, so\r\nobvious is this "productive" character of the men\'s work that in the\r\nconventional economic writings the hunter\'s work is taken as the type of\r\nprimitive industry. But such is not the barbarian\'s sense of the matter.\r\nIn his own eyes he is not a labourer, and he is not to be classed with\r\nthe women in this respect; nor is his effort to be classed with the\r\nwomen\'s drudgery, as labour or industry, in such a sense as to admit\r\nof its being confounded with the latter. There is in all barbarian\r\ncommunities a profound sense of the disparity between man\'s and woman\'s\r\nwork. His work may conduce to the maintenance of the group, but it is\r\nfelt that it does so through an excellence and an efficacy of a kind\r\nthat cannot without derogation be compared with the uneventful diligence\r\nof the women.\r\n\r\nAt a farther step backward in the cultural scale--among savage\r\ngroups--the differentiation of employments is still less elaborate\r\nand the invidious distinction between classes and employments is less\r\nconsistent and less rigorous. Unequivocal instances of a primitive\r\nsavage culture are hard to find. Few of these groups or communities\r\nthat are classed as "savage" show no traces of regression from a more\r\nadvanced cultural stage. But there are groups--some of them apparently\r\nnot the result of retrogression--which show the traits of primitive\r\nsavagery with some fidelity. Their culture differs from that of the\r\nbarbarian communities in the absence of a leisure class and the absence,\r\nin great measure, of the animus or spiritual attitude on which the\r\ninstitution of a leisure class rests. These communities of primitive\r\nsavages in which there is no hierarchy of economic classes make up but a\r\nsmall and inconspicuous fraction of the human race. As good an instance\r\nof this phase of culture as may be had is afforded by the tribes of the\r\nAndamans, or by the Todas of the Nilgiri Hills. The scheme of life of\r\nthese groups at the time of their earliest contact with Europeans seems\r\nto have been nearly typical, so far as regards the absence of a leisure\r\nclass. As a further instance might be cited the Ainu of Yezo, and, more\r\ndoubtfully, also some Bushman and Eskimo groups. Some Pueblo communities\r\nare less confidently to be included in the same class. Most, if not all,\r\nof the communities here cited may well be cases of degeneration from a\r\nhigher barbarism, rather than bearers of a culture that has never risen\r\nabove its present level. If so, they are for the present purpose to be\r\ntaken with the allowance, but they may serve none the less as evidence\r\nto the same effect as if they were really "primitive" populations.\r\n\r\nThese communities that are without a defined leisure class resemble one\r\nanother also in certain other features of their social structure\r\nand manner of life. They are small groups and of a simple (archaic)\r\nstructure; they are commonly peaceable and sedentary; they are poor; and\r\nindividual ownership is not a dominant feature of their economic system.\r\nAt the same time it does not follow that these are the smallest of\r\nexisting communities, or that their social structure is in all respects\r\nthe least differentiated; nor does the class necessarily include\r\nall primitive communities which have no defined system of individual\r\nownership. But it is to be noted that the class seems to include the\r\nmost peaceable--perhaps all the characteristically peaceable--primitive\r\ngroups of men. Indeed, the most notable trait common to members of such\r\ncommunities is a certain amiable inefficiency when confronted with force\r\nor fraud.\r\n\r\nThe evidence afforded by the usages and cultural traits of communities\r\nat a low stage of development indicates that the institution of a\r\nleisure class has emerged gradually during the transition from primitive\r\nsavagery to barbarism; or more precisely, during the transition from\r\na peaceable to a consistently warlike habit of life. The conditions\r\napparently necessary to its emergence in a consistent form are: (1) the\r\ncommunity must be of a predatory habit of life (war or the hunting\r\nof large game or both); that is to say, the men, who constitute the\r\ninchoate leisure class in these cases, must be habituated to the\r\ninfliction of injury by force and stratagem; (2) subsistence must be\r\nobtainable on sufficiently easy terms to admit of the exemption of\r\na considerable portion of the community from steady application to a\r\nroutine of labour. The institution of leisure class is the outgrowth\r\nof an early discrimination between employments, according to which\r\nsome employments are worthy and others unworthy. Under this ancient\r\ndistinction the worthy employments are those which may be classed as\r\nexploit; unworthy are those necessary everyday employments into which no\r\nappreciable element of exploit enters.\r\n\r\nThis distinction has but little obvious significance in a modern\r\nindustrial community, and it has, therefore, received but slight\r\nattention at the hands of economic writers. When viewed in the light of\r\nthat modern common sense which has guided economic discussion, it seems\r\nformal and insubstantial. But it persists with great tenacity as\r\na commonplace preconception even in modern life, as is shown, for\r\ninstance, by our habitual aversion to menial employments. It is a\r\ndistinction of a personal kind--of superiority and inferiority. In the\r\nearlier stages of culture, when the personal force of the individual\r\ncounted more immediately and obviously in shaping the course of events,\r\nthe element of exploit counted for more in the everyday scheme of life.\r\nInterest centred about this fact to a greater degree. Consequently a\r\ndistinction proceeding on this ground seemed more imperative and more\r\ndefinitive then than is the case to-day. As a fact in the sequence of\r\ndevelopment, therefore, the distinction is a substantial one and rests\r\non sufficiently valid and cogent grounds.\r\n\r\nThe ground on which a discrimination between facts is habitually made\r\nchanges as the interest from which the facts are habitually viewed\r\nchanges. Those features of the facts at hand are salient and substantial\r\nupon which the dominant interest of the time throws its light. Any given\r\nground of distinction will seem insubstantial to any one who habitually\r\napprehends the facts in question from a different point of view and\r\nvalues them for a different purpose. The habit of distinguishing and\r\nclassifying the various purposes and directions of activity prevails of\r\nnecessity always and everywhere; for it is indispensable in reaching a\r\nworking theory or scheme of life. The particular point of view, or the\r\nparticular characteristic that is pitched upon as definitive in the\r\nclassification of the facts of life depends upon the interest from which\r\na discrimination of the facts is sought. The grounds of discrimination,\r\nand the norm of procedure in classifying the facts, therefore,\r\nprogressively change as the growth of culture proceeds; for the end for\r\nwhich the facts of life are apprehended changes, and the point of view\r\nconsequently changes also. So that what are recognised as the salient\r\nand decisive features of a class of activities or of a social class at\r\none stage of culture will not retain the same relative importance for\r\nthe purposes of classification at any subsequent stage.\r\n\r\nBut the change of standards and points of view is gradual only, and it\r\nseldom results in the subversion or entire suppression of a standpoint\r\nonce accepted. A distinction is still habitually made between industrial\r\nand non-industrial occupations; and this modern distinction is a\r\ntransmuted form of the barbarian distinction between exploit and\r\ndrudgery. Such employments as warfare, politics, public worship, and\r\npublic merrymaking, are felt, in the popular apprehension, to differ\r\nintrinsically from the labour that has to do with elaborating the\r\nmaterial means of life. The precise line of demarcation is not the same\r\nas it was in the early barbarian scheme, but the broad distinction has\r\nnot fallen into disuse.\r\n\r\nThe tacit, common-sense distinction to-day is, in effect, that any\r\neffort is to be accounted industrial only so far as its ultimate purpose\r\nis the utilisation of non-human things. The coercive utilisation of man\r\nby man is not felt to be an industrial function; but all effort directed\r\nto enhance human life by taking advantage of the non-human environment\r\nis classed together as industrial activity. By the economists who have\r\nbest retained and adapted the classical tradition, man\'s "power over\r\nnature" is currently postulated as the characteristic fact of industrial\r\nproductivity. This industrial power over nature is taken to include\r\nman\'s power over the life of the beasts and over all the elemental\r\nforces. A line is in this way drawn between mankind and brute creation.\r\n\r\nIn other times and among men imbued with a different body of\r\npreconceptions this line is not drawn precisely as we draw it to-day.\r\nIn the savage or the barbarian scheme of life it is drawn in a different\r\nplace and in another way. In all communities under the barbarian\r\nculture there is an alert and pervading sense of antithesis between\r\ntwo comprehensive groups of phenomena, in one of which barbarian\r\nman includes himself, and in the other, his victual. There is a felt\r\nantithesis between economic and non-economic phenomena, but it is not\r\nconceived in the modern fashion; it lies not between man and brute\r\ncreation, but between animate and inert things.\r\n\r\nIt may be an excess of caution at this day to explain that the barbarian\r\nnotion which it is here intended to convey by the term "animate" is not\r\nthe same as would be conveyed by the word "living". The term does not\r\ncover all living things, and it does cover a great many others. Such\r\na striking natural phenomenon as a storm, a disease, a waterfall, are\r\nrecognised as "animate"; while fruits and herbs, and even inconspicuous\r\nanimals, such as house-flies, maggots, lemmings, sheep, are not\r\nordinarily apprehended as "animate" except when taken collectively.\r\nAs here used the term does not necessarily imply an indwelling soul or\r\nspirit. The concept includes such things as in the apprehension of the\r\nanimistic savage or barbarian are formidable by virtue of a real or\r\nimputed habit of initiating action. This category comprises a large\r\nnumber and range of natural objects and phenomena. Such a distinction\r\nbetween the inert and the active is still present in the habits of\r\nthought of unreflecting persons, and it still profoundly affects the\r\nprevalent theory of human life and of natural processes; but it does not\r\npervade our daily life to the extent or with the far-reaching practical\r\nconsequences that are apparent at earlier stages of culture and belief.\r\n\r\nTo the mind of the barbarian, the elaboration and utilisation of what is\r\nafforded by inert nature is activity on quite a different plane from his\r\ndealings with "animate" things and forces. The line of demarcation may\r\nbe vague and shifting, but the broad distinction is sufficiently real\r\nand cogent to influence the barbarian scheme of life. To the class of\r\nthings apprehended as animate, the barbarian fancy imputes an unfolding\r\nof activity directed to some end. It is this teleological unfolding of\r\nactivity that constitutes any object or phenomenon an "animate" fact.\r\nWherever the unsophisticated savage or barbarian meets with activity\r\nthat is at all obtrusive, he construes it in the only terms that are\r\nready to hand--the terms immediately given in his consciousness of his\r\nown actions. Activity is, therefore, assimilated to human action, and\r\nactive objects are in so far assimilated to the human agent. Phenomena\r\nof this character--especially those whose behaviour is notably\r\nformidable or baffling--have to be met in a different spirit and with\r\nproficiency of a different kind from what is required in dealing with\r\ninert things. To deal successfully with such phenomena is a work of\r\nexploit rather than of industry. It is an assertion of prowess, not of\r\ndiligence.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of this naive discrimination between the inert and\r\nthe animate, the activities of the primitive social group tend to fall\r\ninto two classes, which would in modern phrase be called exploit and\r\nindustry. Industry is effort that goes to create a new thing, with a\r\nnew purpose given it by the fashioning hand of its maker out of passive\r\n("brute") material; while exploit, so far as it results in an outcome\r\nuseful to the agent, is the conversion to his own ends of energies\r\npreviously directed to some other end by an other agent. We still speak\r\nof "brute matter" with something of the barbarian\'s realisation of a\r\nprofound significance in the term.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between exploit and drudgery coincides with a difference\r\nbetween the sexes. The sexes differ, not only in stature and muscular\r\nforce, but perhaps even more decisively in temperament, and this must\r\nearly have given rise to a corresponding division of labour. The general\r\nrange of activities that come under the head of exploit falls to the\r\nmales as being the stouter, more massive, better capable of a sudden\r\nand violent strain, and more readily inclined to self assertion, active\r\nemulation, and aggression. The difference in mass, in physiological\r\ncharacter, and in temperament may be slight among the members of the\r\nprimitive group; it appears, in fact, to be relatively slight and\r\ninconsequential in some of the more archaic communities with which we\r\nare acquainted--as for instance the tribes of the Andamans. But so soon\r\nas a differentiation of function has well begun on the lines marked\r\nout by this difference in physique and animus, the original difference\r\nbetween the sexes will itself widen. A cumulative process of selective\r\nadaptation to the new distribution of employments will set in,\r\nespecially if the habitat or the fauna with which the group is in\r\ncontact is such as to call for a considerable exercise of the sturdier\r\nvirtues. The habitual pursuit of large game requires more of the manly\r\nqualities of massiveness, agility, and ferocity, and it can therefore\r\nscarcely fail to hasten and widen the differentiation of functions\r\nbetween the sexes. And so soon as the group comes into hostile contact\r\nwith other groups, the divergence of function will take on the developed\r\nform of a distinction between exploit and industry.\r\n\r\nIn such a predatory group of hunters it comes to be the able-bodied\r\nmen\'s office to fight and hunt. The women do what other work there is\r\nto do--other members who are unfit for man\'s work being for this purpose\r\nclassed with women. But the men\'s hunting and fighting are both of the\r\nsame general character. Both are of a predatory nature; the warrior\r\nand the hunter alike reap where they have not strewn. Their aggressive\r\nassertion of force and sagacity differs obviously from the women\'s\r\nassiduous and uneventful shaping of materials; it is not to be accounted\r\nproductive labour but rather an acquisition of substance by seizure.\r\nSuch being the barbarian man\'s work, in its best development and widest\r\ndivergence from women\'s work, any effort that does not involve an\r\nassertion of prowess comes to be unworthy of the man. As the tradition\r\ngains consistency, the common sense of the community erects it into a\r\ncanon of conduct; so that no employment and no acquisition is morally\r\npossible to the self respecting man at this cultural stage, except such\r\nas proceeds on the basis of prowess--force or fraud. When the predatory\r\nhabit of life has been settled upon the group by long habituation, it\r\nbecomes the able-bodied man\'s accredited office in the social economy\r\nto kill, to destroy such competitors in the struggle for existence as\r\nattempt to resist or elude him, to overcome and reduce to subservience\r\nthose alien forces that assert themselves refractorily in the\r\nenvironment. So tenaciously and with such nicety is this theoretical\r\ndistinction between exploit and drudgery adhered to that in many hunting\r\ntribes the man must not bring home the game which he has killed, but\r\nmust send his woman to perform that baser office.\r\n\r\nAs has already been indicated, the distinction between exploit and\r\ndrudgery is an invidious distinction between employments. Those\r\nemployments which are to be classed as exploit are worthy, honourable,\r\nnoble; other employments, which do not contain this element of exploit,\r\nand especially those which imply subservience or submission, are\r\nunworthy, debasing, ignoble. The concept of dignity, worth, or honour,\r\nas applied either to persons or conduct, is of first-rate consequence\r\nin the development of classes and of class distinctions, and it is\r\ntherefore necessary to say something of its derivation and meaning. Its\r\npsychological ground may be indicated in outline as follows.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of selective necessity, man is an agent. He is, in his own\r\napprehension, a centre of unfolding impulsive activity--"teleological"\r\nactivity. He is an agent seeking in every act the accomplishment of some\r\nconcrete, objective, impersonal end. By force of his being such an agent\r\nhe is possessed of a taste for effective work, and a distaste for futile\r\neffort. He has a sense of the merit of serviceability or efficiency\r\nand of the demerit of futility, waste, or incapacity. This aptitude\r\nor propensity may be called the instinct of workmanship. Wherever the\r\ncircumstances or traditions of life lead to an habitual comparison\r\nof one person with another in point of efficiency, the instinct of\r\nworkmanship works out in an emulative or invidious comparison of\r\npersons. The extent to which this result follows depends in some\r\nconsiderable degree on the temperament of the population. In any\r\ncommunity where such an invidious comparison of persons is habitually\r\nmade, visible success becomes an end sought for its own utility as a\r\nbasis of esteem. Esteem is gained and dispraise is avoided by putting\r\none\'s efficiency in evidence. The result is that the instinct of\r\nworkmanship works out in an emulative demonstration of force.\r\n\r\nDuring that primitive phase of social development, when the community is\r\nstill habitually peaceable, perhaps sedentary, and without a developed\r\nsystem of individual ownership, the efficiency of the individual can\r\nbe shown chiefly and most consistently in some employment that goes to\r\nfurther the life of the group. What emulation of an economic kind there\r\nis between the members of such a group will be chiefly emulation in\r\nindustrial serviceability. At the same time the incentive to emulation\r\nis not strong, nor is the scope for emulation large.\r\n\r\nWhen the community passes from peaceable savagery to a predatory phase\r\nof life, the conditions of emulation change. The opportunity and the\r\nincentive to emulate increase greatly in scope and urgency. The activity\r\nof the men more and more takes on the character of exploit; and an\r\ninvidious comparison of one hunter or warrior with another grows\r\ncontinually easier and more habitual. Tangible evidences of\r\nprowess--trophies--find a place in men\'s habits of thought as an\r\nessential feature of the paraphernalia of life. Booty, trophies of\r\nthe chase or of the raid, come to be prized as evidence of pre-eminent\r\nforce. Aggression becomes the accredited form of action, and booty\r\nserves as prima facie evidence of successful aggression. As accepted at\r\nthis cultural stage, the accredited, worthy form of self-assertion\r\nis contest; and useful articles or services obtained by seizure or\r\ncompulsion, serve as a conventional evidence of successful contest.\r\nTherefore, by contrast, the obtaining of goods by other methods than\r\nseizure comes to be accounted unworthy of man in his best estate. The\r\nperformance of productive work, or employment in personal service, falls\r\nunder the same odium for the same reason. An invidious distinction\r\nin this way arises between exploit and acquisition on the other hand.\r\nLabour acquires a character of irksomeness by virtue of the indignity\r\nimputed to it.\r\n\r\nWith the primitive barbarian, before the simple content of the notion\r\nhas been obscured by its own ramifications and by a secondary growth of\r\ncognate ideas, "honourable" seems to connote nothing else than\r\nassertion of superior force. "Honourable" is "formidable"; "worthy" is\r\n"prepotent". A honorific act is in the last analysis little if\r\nanything else than a recognised successful act of aggression; and where\r\naggression means conflict with men and beasts, the activity which comes\r\nto be especially and primarily honourable is the assertion of the strong\r\nhand. The naive, archaic habit of construing all manifestations of\r\nforce in terms of personality or "will power" greatly fortifies this\r\nconventional exaltation of the strong hand. Honorific epithets, in\r\nvogue among barbarian tribes as well as among peoples of a more advance\r\nculture, commonly bear the stamp of this unsophisticated sense of\r\nhonour. Epithets and titles used in addressing chieftains, and in the\r\npropitiation of kings and gods, very commonly impute a propensity for\r\noverbearing violence and an irresistible devastating force to the person\r\nwho is to be propitiated. This holds true to an extent also in the more\r\ncivilised communities of the present day. The predilection shown in\r\nheraldic devices for the more rapacious beasts and birds of prey goes to\r\nenforce the same view.\r\n\r\nUnder this common-sense barbarian appreciation of worth or honour, the\r\ntaking of life--the killing of formidable competitors, whether brute\r\nor human--is honourable in the highest degree. And this high office of\r\nslaughter, as an expression of the slayer\'s prepotence, casts a\r\nglamour of worth over every act of slaughter and over all the tools and\r\naccessories of the act. Arms are honourable, and the use of them, even\r\nin seeking the life of the meanest creatures of the fields, becomes a\r\nhonorific employment. At the same time, employment in industry becomes\r\ncorrespondingly odious, and, in the common-sense apprehension, the\r\nhandling of the tools and implements of industry falls beneath the\r\ndignity of able-bodied men. Labour becomes irksome.\r\n\r\nIt is here assumed that in the sequence of cultural evolution primitive\r\ngroups of men have passed from an initial peaceable stage to a\r\nsubsequent stage at which fighting is the avowed and characteristic\r\nemployment of the group. But it is not implied that there has been an\r\nabrupt transition from unbroken peace and good-will to a later or higher\r\nphase of life in which the fact of combat occurs for the first time.\r\nNeither is it implied that all peaceful industry disappears on the\r\ntransition to the predatory phase of culture. Some fighting, it is safe\r\nto say, would be met with at any early stage of social development.\r\nFights would occur with more or less frequency through sexual\r\ncompetition. The known habits of primitive groups, as well as the habits\r\nof the anthropoid apes, argue to that effect, and the evidence from the\r\nwell-known promptings of human nature enforces the same view.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be objected that there can have been no such initial\r\nstage of peaceable life as is here assumed. There is no point in\r\ncultural evolution prior to which fighting does not occur. But the\r\npoint in question is not as to the occurrence of combat, occasional or\r\nsporadic, or even more or less frequent and habitual; it is a question\r\nas to the occurrence of an habitual; it is a question as to the\r\noccurrence of an habitual bellicose frame of mind--a prevalent habit\r\nof judging facts and events from the point of view of the fight. The\r\npredatory phase of culture is attained only when the predatory attitude\r\nhas become the habitual and accredited spiritual attitude for the\r\nmembers of the group; when the fight has become the dominant note in the\r\ncurrent theory of life; when the common-sense appreciation of men and\r\nthings has come to be an appreciation with a view to combat.\r\n\r\nThe substantial difference between the peaceable and the predatory phase\r\nof culture, therefore, is a spiritual difference, not a mechanical one.\r\nThe change in spiritual attitude is the outgrowth of a change in the\r\nmaterial facts of the life of the group, and it comes on gradually as\r\nthe material circumstances favourable to a predatory attitude supervene.\r\nThe inferior limit of the predatory culture is an industrial limit.\r\nPredation can not become the habitual, conventional resource of any\r\ngroup or any class until industrial methods have been developed to such\r\na degree of efficiency as to leave a margin worth fighting for, above\r\nthe subsistence of those engaged in getting a living. The transition\r\nfrom peace to predation therefore depends on the growth of technical\r\nknowledge and the use of tools. A predatory culture is similarly\r\nimpracticable in early times, until weapons have been developed to such\r\na point as to make man a formidable animal. The early development of\r\ntools and of weapons is of course the same fact seen from two different\r\npoints of view.\r\n\r\nThe life of a given group would be characterised as peaceable so long\r\nas habitual recourse to combat has not brought the fight into the\r\nforeground in men\'s every day thoughts, as a dominant feature of the\r\nlife of man. A group may evidently attain such a predatory attitude with\r\na greater or less degree of completeness, so that its scheme of life and\r\ncanons of conduct may be controlled to a greater or less extent by the\r\npredatory animus. The predatory phase of culture is therefore conceived\r\nto come on gradually, through a cumulative growth of predatory aptitudes\r\nhabits, and traditions this growth being due to a change in the\r\ncircumstances of the group\'s life, of such a kind as to develop and\r\nconserve those traits of human nature and those traditions and norms of\r\nconduct that make for a predatory rather than a peaceable life.\r\n\r\nThe evidence for the hypothesis that there has been such a peaceable\r\nstage of primitive culture is in great part drawn from psychology rather\r\nthan from ethnology, and cannot be detailed here. It will be recited in\r\npart in a later chapter, in discussing the survival of archaic traits of\r\nhuman nature under the modern culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Two ~~ Pecuniary Emulation\r\n\r\nIn the sequence of cultural evolution the emergence of a leisure class\r\ncoincides with the beginning of ownership. This is necessarily the case,\r\nfor these two institutions result from the same set of economic forces.\r\nIn the inchoate phase of their development they are but different\r\naspects of the same general facts of social structure.\r\n\r\nIt is as elements of social structure--conventional facts--that leisure\r\nand ownership are matters of interest for the purpose in hand. An\r\nhabitual neglect of work does not constitute a leisure class; neither\r\ndoes the mechanical fact of use and consumption constitute ownership.\r\nThe present inquiry, therefore, is not concerned with the beginning\r\nof indolence, nor with the beginning of the appropriation of useful\r\narticles to individual consumption. The point in question is the origin\r\nand nature of a conventional leisure class on the one hand and the\r\nbeginnings of individual ownership as a conventional right or equitable\r\nclaim on the other hand.\r\n\r\nThe early differentiation out of which the distinction between a leisure\r\nand a working class arises is a division maintained between men\'s and\r\nwomen\'s work in the lower stages of barbarism. Likewise the earliest\r\nform of ownership is an ownership of the women by the able bodied men\r\nof the community. The facts may be expressed in more general terms, and\r\ntruer to the import of the barbarian theory of life, by saying that it\r\nis an ownership of the woman by the man.\r\n\r\nThere was undoubtedly some appropriation of useful articles before the\r\ncustom of appropriating women arose. The usages of existing archaic\r\ncommunities in which there is no ownership of women is warrant for such\r\na view. In all communities the members, both male and female, habitually\r\nappropriate to their individual use a variety of useful things; but\r\nthese useful things are not thought of as owned by the person who\r\nappropriates and consumes them. The habitual appropriation and\r\nconsumption of certain slight personal effects goes on without\r\nraising the question of ownership; that is to say, the question of a\r\nconventional, equitable claim to extraneous things.\r\n\r\nThe ownership of women begins in the lower barbarian stages of culture,\r\napparently with the seizure of female captives. The original reason\r\nfor the seizure and appropriation of women seems to have been their\r\nusefulness as trophies. The practice of seizing women from the enemy\r\nas trophies, gave rise to a form of ownership-marriage, resulting in a\r\nhousehold with a male head. This was followed by an extension of slavery\r\nto other captives and inferiors, besides women, and by an extension of\r\nownership-marriage to other women than those seized from the enemy.\r\nThe outcome of emulation under the circumstances of a predatory life,\r\ntherefore, has been on the one hand a form of marriage resting on\r\ncoercion, and on the other hand the custom of ownership. The two\r\ninstitutions are not distinguishable in the initial phase of their\r\ndevelopment; both arise from the desire of the successful men to put\r\ntheir prowess in evidence by exhibiting some durable result of their\r\nexploits. Both also minister to that propensity for mastery which\r\npervades all predatory communities. From the ownership of women the\r\nconcept of ownership extends itself to include the products of their\r\nindustry, and so there arises the ownership of things as well as of\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nIn this way a consistent system of property in goods is gradually\r\ninstalled. And although in the latest stages of the development,\r\nthe serviceability of goods for consumption has come to be the most\r\nobtrusive element of their value, still, wealth has by no means yet lost\r\nits utility as a honorific evidence of the owner\'s prepotence.\r\n\r\nWherever the institution of private property is found, even in a\r\nslightly developed form, the economic process bears the character of a\r\nstruggle between men for the possession of goods. It has been customary\r\nin economic theory, and especially among those economists who adhere\r\nwith least faltering to the body of modernised classical doctrines, to\r\nconstrue this struggle for wealth as being substantially a struggle for\r\nsubsistence. Such is, no doubt, its character in large part during\r\nthe earlier and less efficient phases of industry. Such is also its\r\ncharacter in all cases where the "niggardliness of nature" is so strict\r\nas to afford but a scanty livelihood to the community in return for\r\nstrenuous and unremitting application to the business of getting the\r\nmeans of subsistence. But in all progressing communities an advance is\r\npresently made beyond this early stage of technological development.\r\nIndustrial efficiency is presently carried to such a pitch as to afford\r\nsomething appreciably more than a bare livelihood to those engaged in\r\nthe industrial process. It has not been unusual for economic theory to\r\nspeak of the further struggle for wealth on this new industrial basis as\r\na competition for an increase of the comforts of life,--primarily for\r\nan increase of the physical comforts which the consumption of goods\r\naffords.\r\n\r\nThe end of acquisition and accumulation is conventionally held to be the\r\nconsumption of the goods accumulated--whether it is consumption directly\r\nby the owner of the goods or by the household attached to him and for\r\nthis purpose identified with him in theory. This is at least felt to\r\nbe the economically legitimate end of acquisition, which alone it is\r\nincumbent on the theory to take account of. Such consumption may of\r\ncourse be conceived to serve the consumer\'s physical wants--his\r\nphysical comfort--or his so-called higher wants--spiritual, aesthetic,\r\nintellectual, or what not; the latter class of wants being served\r\nindirectly by an expenditure of goods, after the fashion familiar to all\r\neconomic readers.\r\n\r\nBut it is only when taken in a sense far removed from its naive meaning\r\nthat consumption of goods can be said to afford the incentive from which\r\naccumulation invariably proceeds. The motive that lies at the root\r\nof ownership is emulation; and the same motive of emulation continues\r\nactive in the further development of the institution to which it has\r\ngiven rise and in the development of all those features of the social\r\nstructure which this institution of ownership touches. The possession of\r\nwealth confers honour; it is an invidious distinction. Nothing equally\r\ncogent can be said for the consumption of goods, nor for any other\r\nconceivable incentive to acquisition, and especially not for any\r\nincentive to accumulation of wealth.\r\n\r\nIt is of course not to be overlooked that in a community where nearly\r\nall goods are private property the necessity of earning a livelihood\r\nis a powerful and ever present incentive for the poorer members of\r\nthe community. The need of subsistence and of an increase of physical\r\ncomfort may for a time be the dominant motive of acquisition for those\r\nclasses who are habitually employed at manual labour, whose subsistence\r\nis on a precarious footing, who possess little and ordinarily accumulate\r\nlittle; but it will appear in the course of the discussion that even in\r\nthe case of these impecunious classes the predominance of the motive of\r\nphysical want is not so decided as has sometimes been assumed. On the\r\nother hand, so far as regards those members and classes of the community\r\nwho are chiefly concerned in the accumulation of wealth, the incentive\r\nof subsistence or of physical comfort never plays a considerable part.\r\nOwnership began and grew into a human institution on grounds unrelated\r\nto the subsistence minimum. The dominant incentive was from the outset\r\nthe invidious distinction attaching to wealth, and, save temporarily and\r\nby exception, no other motive has usurped the primacy at any later stage\r\nof the development.\r\n\r\nProperty set out with being booty held as trophies of the successful\r\nraid. So long as the group had departed and so long as it still stood\r\nin close contact with other hostile groups, the utility of things or\r\npersons owned lay chiefly in an invidious comparison between their\r\npossessor and the enemy from whom they were taken. The habit of\r\ndistinguishing between the interests of the individual and those of\r\nthe group to which he belongs is apparently a later growth. Invidious\r\ncomparison between the possessor of the honorific booty and his less\r\nsuccessful neighbours within the group was no doubt present early as an\r\nelement of the utility of the things possessed, though this was not at\r\nthe outset the chief element of their value. The man\'s prowess was\r\nstill primarily the group\'s prowess, and the possessor of the booty\r\nfelt himself to be primarily the keeper of the honour of his group. This\r\nappreciation of exploit from the communal point of view is met with also\r\nat later stages of social growth, especially as regards the laurels of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the custom of individual ownership begins to gain\r\nconsistency, the point of view taken in making the invidious comparison\r\non which private property rests will begin to change. Indeed, the one\r\nchange is but the reflex of the other. The initial phase of ownership,\r\nthe phase of acquisition by naive seizure and conversion, begins to pass\r\ninto the subsequent stage of an incipient organization of industry on\r\nthe basis of private property (in slaves); the horde develops into a\r\nmore or less self-sufficing industrial community; possessions then come\r\nto be valued not so much as evidence of successful foray, but rather as\r\nevidence of the prepotence of the possessor of these goods over other\r\nindividuals within the community. The invidious comparison now becomes\r\nprimarily a comparison of the owner with the other members of the\r\ngroup. Property is still of the nature of trophy, but, with the cultural\r\nadvance, it becomes more and more a trophy of successes scored in the\r\ngame of ownership carried on between the members of the group under the\r\nquasi-peaceable methods of nomadic life.\r\n\r\nGradually, as industrial activity further displaced predatory activity\r\nin the community\'s everyday life and in men\'s habits of thought,\r\naccumulated property more and more replaces trophies of predatory\r\nexploit as the conventional exponent of prepotence and success. With the\r\ngrowth of settled industry, therefore, the possession of wealth gains in\r\nrelative importance and effectiveness as a customary basis of repute and\r\nesteem. Not that esteem ceases to be awarded on the basis of other, more\r\ndirect evidence of prowess; not that successful predatory aggression or\r\nwarlike exploit ceases to call out the approval and admiration of the\r\ncrowd, or to stir the envy of the less successful competitors; but\r\nthe opportunities for gaining distinction by means of this direct\r\nmanifestation of superior force grow less available both in scope and\r\nfrequency. At the same time opportunities for industrial aggression, and\r\nfor the accumulation of property, increase in scope and availability.\r\nAnd it is even more to the point that property now becomes the\r\nmost easily recognised evidence of a reputable degree of success as\r\ndistinguished from heroic or signal achievement. It therefore becomes\r\nthe conventional basis of esteem. Its possession in some amount becomes\r\nnecessary in order to any reputable standing in the community. It\r\nbecomes indispensable to accumulate, to acquire property, in order to\r\nretain one\'s good name. When accumulated goods have in this way once\r\nbecome the accepted badge of efficiency, the possession of wealth\r\npresently assumes the character of an independent and definitive basis\r\nof esteem. The possession of goods, whether acquired aggressively by\r\none\'s own exertion or passively by transmission through inheritance from\r\nothers, becomes a conventional basis of reputability. The possession\r\nof wealth, which was at the outset valued simply as an evidence of\r\nefficiency, becomes, in popular apprehension, itself a meritorious act.\r\nWealth is now itself intrinsically honourable and confers honour on\r\nits possessor. By a further refinement, wealth acquired passively by\r\ntransmission from ancestors or other antecedents presently becomes even\r\nmore honorific than wealth acquired by the possessor\'s own effort;\r\nbut this distinction belongs at a later stage in the evolution of the\r\npecuniary culture and will be spoken of in its place.\r\n\r\nProwess and exploit may still remain the basis of award of the highest\r\npopular esteem, although the possession of wealth has become the basis\r\nof common place reputability and of a blameless social standing.\r\nThe predatory instinct and the consequent approbation of predatory\r\nefficiency are deeply ingrained in the habits of thought of those\r\npeoples who have passed under the discipline of a protracted predatory\r\nculture. According to popular award, the highest honours within human\r\nreach may, even yet, be those gained by an unfolding of extraordinary\r\npredatory efficiency in war, or by a quasi-predatory efficiency in\r\nstatecraft; but for the purposes of a commonplace decent standing in the\r\ncommunity these means of repute have been replaced by the acquisition\r\nand accumulation of goods. In order to stand well in the eyes of the\r\ncommunity, it is necessary to come up to a certain, somewhat indefinite,\r\nconventional standard of wealth; just as in the earlier predatory stage\r\nit is necessary for the barbarian man to come up to the tribe\'s standard\r\nof physical endurance, cunning, and skill at arms. A certain standard\r\nof wealth in the one case, and of prowess in the other, is a necessary\r\ncondition of reputability, and anything in excess of this normal amount\r\nis meritorious.\r\n\r\nThose members of the community who fall short of this, somewhat\r\nindefinite, normal degree of prowess or of property suffer in the esteem\r\nof their fellow-men; and consequently they suffer also in their own\r\nesteem, since the usual basis of self-respect is the respect accorded by\r\none\'s neighbours. Only individuals with an aberrant temperament can in\r\nthe long run retain their self-esteem in the face of the disesteem of\r\ntheir fellows. Apparent exceptions to the rule are met with, especially\r\namong people with strong religious convictions. But these apparent\r\nexceptions are scarcely real exceptions, since such persons commonly\r\nfall back on the putative approbation of some supernatural witness of\r\ntheir deeds.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the possession of property becomes the basis of popular\r\nesteem, therefore, it becomes also a requisite to the complacency which\r\nwe call self-respect. In any community where goods are held in severalty\r\nit is necessary, in order to his own peace of mind, that an individual\r\nshould possess as large a portion of goods as others with whom he is\r\naccustomed to class himself; and it is extremely gratifying to\r\npossess something more than others. But as fast as a person makes new\r\nacquisitions, and becomes accustomed to the resulting new standard of\r\nwealth, the new standard forthwith ceases to afford appreciably greater\r\nsatisfaction than the earlier standard did. The tendency in any case is\r\nconstantly to make the present pecuniary standard the point of departure\r\nfor a fresh increase of wealth; and this in turn gives rise to a new\r\nstandard of sufficiency and a new pecuniary classification of one\'s\r\nself as compared with one\'s neighbours. So far as concerns the present\r\nquestion, the end sought by accumulation is to rank high in comparison\r\nwith the rest of the community in point of pecuniary strength. So long\r\nas the comparison is distinctly unfavourable to himself, the normal,\r\naverage individual will live in chronic dissatisfaction with his present\r\nlot; and when he has reached what may be called the normal pecuniary\r\nstandard of the community, or of his class in the community, this\r\nchronic dissatisfaction will give place to a restless straining to place\r\na wider and ever-widening pecuniary interval between himself and\r\nthis average standard. The invidious comparison can never become so\r\nfavourable to the individual making it that he would not gladly rate\r\nhimself still higher relatively to his competitors in the struggle for\r\npecuniary reputability.\r\n\r\nIn the nature of the case, the desire for wealth can scarcely be\r\nsatiated in any individual instance, and evidently a satiation of the\r\naverage or general desire for wealth is out of the question. However\r\nwidely, or equally, or "fairly", it may be distributed, no general\r\nincrease of the community\'s wealth can make any approach to satiating\r\nthis need, the ground of which is the desire of every one to excel every\r\none else in the accumulation of goods. If, as is sometimes assumed, the\r\nincentive to accumulation were the want of subsistence or of physical\r\ncomfort, then the aggregate economic wants of a community might\r\nconceivably be satisfied at some point in the advance of industrial\r\nefficiency; but since the struggle is substantially a race for\r\nreputability on the basis of an invidious comparison, no approach to\r\na definitive attainment is possible.\r\n\r\nWhat has just been said must not be taken to mean that there are no\r\nother incentives to acquisition and accumulation than this desire to\r\nexcel in pecuniary standing and so gain the esteem and envy of one\'s\r\nfellow-men. The desire for added comfort and security from want is\r\npresent as a motive at every stage of the process of accumulation in\r\na modern industrial community; although the standard of sufficiency in\r\nthese respects is in turn greatly affected by the habit of pecuniary\r\nemulation. To a great extent this emulation shapes the methods and\r\nselects the objects of expenditure for personal comfort and decent\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the power conferred by wealth also affords a motive\r\nto accumulation. That propensity for purposeful activity and that\r\nrepugnance to all futility of effort which belong to man by virtue of\r\nhis character as an agent do not desert him when he emerges from the\r\nnaive communal culture where the dominant note of life is the unanalysed\r\nand undifferentiated solidarity of the individual with the group with\r\nwhich his life is bound up. When he enters upon the predatory stage,\r\nwhere self-seeking in the narrower sense becomes the dominant note, this\r\npropensity goes with him still, as the pervasive trait that shapes his\r\nscheme of life. The propensity for achievement and the repugnance to\r\nfutility remain the underlying economic motive. The propensity changes\r\nonly in the form of its expression and in the proximate objects to which\r\nit directs the man\'s activity. Under the regime of individual ownership\r\nthe most available means of visibly achieving a purpose is that afforded\r\nby the acquisition and accumulation of goods; and as the self-regarding\r\nantithesis between man and man reaches fuller consciousness, the\r\npropensity for achievement--the instinct of workmanship--tends more\r\nand more to shape itself into a straining to excel others in pecuniary\r\nachievement. Relative success, tested by an invidious pecuniary\r\ncomparison with other men, becomes the conventional end of action. The\r\ncurrently accepted legitimate end of effort becomes the achievement of\r\na favourable comparison with other men; and therefore the repugnance to\r\nfutility to a good extent coalesces with the incentive of emulation. It\r\nacts to accentuate the struggle for pecuniary reputability by visiting\r\nwith a sharper disapproval all shortcoming and all evidence of\r\nshortcoming in point of pecuniary success. Purposeful effort comes to\r\nmean, primarily, effort directed to or resulting in a more creditable\r\nshowing of accumulated wealth. Among the motives which lead men to\r\naccumulate wealth, the primacy, both in scope and intensity, therefore,\r\ncontinues to belong to this motive of pecuniary emulation.\r\n\r\nIn making use of the term "invidious", it may perhaps be unnecessary to\r\nremark, there is no intention to extol or depreciate, or to commend or\r\ndeplore any of the phenomena which the word is used to characterise. The\r\nterm is used in a technical sense as describing a comparison of persons\r\nwith a view to rating and grading them in respect of relative worth or\r\nvalue--in an aesthetic or moral sense--and so awarding and defining\r\nthe relative degrees of complacency with which they may legitimately be\r\ncontemplated by themselves and by others. An invidious comparison is a\r\nprocess of valuation of persons in respect of worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Three ~~ Conspicuous Leisure\r\n\r\nIf its working were not disturbed by other economic forces or other\r\nfeatures of the emulative process, the immediate effect of such a\r\npecuniary struggle as has just been described in outline would be to\r\nmake men industrious and frugal. This result actually follows, in some\r\nmeasure, so far as regards the lower classes, whose ordinary means of\r\nacquiring goods is productive labour. This is more especially true\r\nof the labouring classes in a sedentary community which is at an\r\nagricultural stage of industry, in which there is a considerable\r\nsubdivision of industry, and whose laws and customs secure to these\r\nclasses a more or less definite share of the product of their industry.\r\nThese lower classes can in any case not avoid labour, and the imputation\r\nof labour is therefore not greatly derogatory to them, at least not\r\nwithin their class. Rather, since labour is their recognised and\r\naccepted mode of life, they take some emulative pride in a reputation\r\nfor efficiency in their work, this being often the only line of\r\nemulation that is open to them. For those for whom acquisition and\r\nemulation is possible only within the field of productive efficiency\r\nand thrift, the struggle for pecuniary reputability will in some\r\nmeasure work out in an increase of diligence and parsimony. But certain\r\nsecondary features of the emulative process, yet to be spoken of,\r\ncome in to very materially circumscribe and modify emulation in these\r\ndirections among the pecuniary inferior classes as well as among the\r\nsuperior class.\r\n\r\nBut it is otherwise with the superior pecuniary class, with which we\r\nare here immediately concerned. For this class also the incentive\r\nto diligence and thrift is not absent; but its action is so greatly\r\nqualified by the secondary demands of pecuniary emulation, that any\r\ninclination in this direction is practically overborne and any incentive\r\nto diligence tends to be of no effect. The most imperative of these\r\nsecondary demands of emulation, as well as the one of widest scope, is\r\nthe requirement of abstention from productive work. This is true in an\r\nespecial degree for the barbarian stage of culture. During the predatory\r\nculture labour comes to be associated in men\'s habits of thought\r\nwith weakness and subjection to a master. It is therefore a mark of\r\ninferiority, and therefore comes to be accounted unworthy of man in his\r\nbest estate. By virtue of this tradition labour is felt to be debasing,\r\nand this tradition has never died out. On the contrary, with the advance\r\nof social differentiation it has acquired the axiomatic force due to\r\nancient and unquestioned prescription.\r\n\r\nIn order to gain and to hold the esteem of men it is not sufficient\r\nmerely to possess wealth or power. The wealth or power must be put in\r\nevidence, for esteem is awarded only on evidence. And not only does the\r\nevidence of wealth serve to impress one\'s importance on others and\r\nto keep their sense of his importance alive and alert, but it is of\r\nscarcely less use in building up and preserving one\'s self-complacency.\r\nIn all but the lowest stages of culture the normally constituted man is\r\ncomforted and upheld in his self-respect by "decent surroundings" and\r\nby exemption from "menial offices". Enforced departure from his habitual\r\nstandard of decency, either in the paraphernalia of life or in the kind\r\nand amount of his everyday activity, is felt to be a slight upon his\r\nhuman dignity, even apart from all conscious consideration of the\r\napproval or disapproval of his fellows.\r\n\r\nThe archaic theoretical distinction between the base and the honourable\r\nin the manner of a man\'s life retains very much of its ancient force\r\neven today. So much so that there are few of the better class who are not\r\npossessed of an instinctive repugnance for the vulgar forms of labour.\r\nWe have a realising sense of ceremonial uncleanness attaching in an\r\nespecial degree to the occupations which are associated in our habits of\r\nthought with menial service. It is felt by all persons of refined taste\r\nthat a spiritual contamination is inseparable from certain offices that\r\nare conventionally required of servants. Vulgar surroundings, mean (that\r\nis to say, inexpensive) habitations, and vulgarly productive occupations\r\nare unhesitatingly condemned and avoided. They are incompatible with\r\nlife on a satisfactory spiritual plane __ with "high thinking". From the\r\ndays of the Greek philosophers to the present, a degree of leisure and\r\nof exemption from contact with such industrial processes as serve the\r\nimmediate everyday purposes of human life has ever been recognised by\r\nthoughtful men as a prerequisite to a worthy or beautiful, or even a\r\nblameless, human life. In itself and in its consequences the life of\r\nleisure is beautiful and ennobling in all civilised men\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nThis direct, subjective value of leisure and of other evidences of\r\nwealth is no doubt in great part secondary and derivative. It is in part\r\na reflex of the utility of leisure as a means of gaining the respect\r\nof others, and in part it is the result of a mental substitution. The\r\nperformance of labour has been accepted as a conventional evidence of\r\ninferior force; therefore it comes itself, by a mental short-cut, to be\r\nregarded as intrinsically base.\r\n\r\nDuring the predatory stage proper, and especially during the earlier\r\nstages of the quasi-peaceable development of industry that follows the\r\npredatory stage, a life of leisure is the readiest and most conclusive\r\nevidence of pecuniary strength, and therefore of superior force;\r\nprovided always that the gentleman of leisure can live in manifest ease\r\nand comfort. At this stage wealth consists chiefly of slaves, and the\r\nbenefits accruing from the possession of riches and power take the\r\nform chiefly of personal service and the immediate products of personal\r\nservice. Conspicuous abstention from labour therefore becomes the\r\nconventional mark of superior pecuniary achievement and the conventional\r\nindex of reputability; and conversely, since application to productive\r\nlabour is a mark of poverty and subjection, it becomes inconsistent with\r\na reputable standing in the community. Habits of industry and thrift,\r\ntherefore, are not uniformly furthered by a prevailing pecuniary\r\nemulation. On the contrary, this kind of emulation indirectly\r\ndiscountenances participation in productive labour. Labour would\r\nunavoidably become dishonourable, as being an evidence indecorous under\r\nthe ancient tradition handed down from an earlier cultural stage. The\r\nancient tradition of the predatory culture is that productive effort is\r\nto be shunned as being unworthy of able-bodied men, and this tradition\r\nis reinforced rather than set aside in the passage from the predatory to\r\nthe quasi-peaceable manner of life.\r\n\r\nEven if the institution of a leisure class had not come in with the\r\nfirst emergence of individual ownership, by force of the dishonour\r\nattaching to productive employment, it would in any case have come in\r\nas one of the early consequences of ownership. And it is to be remarked\r\nthat while the leisure class existed in theory from the beginning of\r\npredatory culture, the institution takes on a new and fuller meaning\r\nwith the transition from the predatory to the next succeeding pecuniary\r\nstage of culture. It is from this time forth a "leisure class" in fact\r\nas well as in theory. From this point dates the institution of the\r\nleisure class in its consummate form.\r\n\r\nDuring the predatory stage proper the distinction between the leisure\r\nand the labouring class is in some degree a ceremonial distinction only.\r\nThe able bodied men jealously stand aloof from whatever is in their\r\napprehension, menial drudgery; but their activity in fact contributes\r\nappreciably to the sustenance of the group. The subsequent stage of\r\nquasi-peaceable industry is usually characterised by an established\r\nchattel slavery, herds of cattle, and a servile class of herdsmen and\r\nshepherds; industry has advanced so far that the community is no longer\r\ndependent for its livelihood on the chase or on any other form of\r\nactivity that can fairly be classed as exploit. From this point on, the\r\ncharacteristic feature of leisure class life is a conspicuous exemption\r\nfrom all useful employment.\r\n\r\nThe normal and characteristic occupations of the class in this mature\r\nphase of its life history are in form very much the same as in its\r\nearlier days. These occupations are government, war, sports, and devout\r\nobservances. Persons unduly given to difficult theoretical niceties\r\nmay hold that these occupations are still incidentally and indirectly\r\n"productive"; but it is to be noted as decisive of the question in hand\r\nthat the ordinary and ostensible motive of the leisure class in\r\nengaging in these occupations is assuredly not an increase of wealth by\r\nproductive effort. At this as at any other cultural stage, government\r\nand war are, at least in part, carried on for the pecuniary gain of\r\nthose who engage in them; but it is gain obtained by the honourable\r\nmethod of seizure and conversion. These occupations are of the nature of\r\npredatory, not of productive, employment. Something similar may be said\r\nof the chase, but with a difference. As the community passes out of the\r\nhunting stage proper, hunting gradually becomes differentiated into two\r\ndistinct employments. On the one hand it is a trade, carried on chiefly\r\nfor gain; and from this the element of exploit is virtually absent,\r\nor it is at any rate not present in a sufficient degree to clear the\r\npursuit of the imputation of gainful industry. On the other hand, the\r\nchase is also a sport--an exercise of the predatory impulse simply.\r\nAs such it does not afford any appreciable pecuniary incentive, but it\r\ncontains a more or less obvious element of exploit. It is this latter\r\ndevelopment of the chase--purged of all imputation of handicraft--that\r\nalone is meritorious and fairly belongs in the scheme of life of the\r\ndeveloped leisure class.\r\n\r\nAbstention from labour is not only a honorific or meritorious act,\r\nbut it presently comes to be a requisite of decency. The insistence on\r\nproperty as the basis of reputability is very naive and very imperious\r\nduring the early stages of the accumulation of wealth. Abstention\r\nfrom labour is the convenient evidence of wealth and is therefore\r\nthe conventional mark of social standing; and this insistence on the\r\nmeritoriousness of wealth leads to a more strenuous insistence on\r\nleisure. Nota notae est nota rei ipsius. According to well established\r\nlaws of human nature, prescription presently seizes upon this\r\nconventional evidence of wealth and fixes it in men\'s habits of thought\r\nas something that is in itself substantially meritorious and ennobling;\r\nwhile productive labour at the same time and by a like process becomes\r\nin a double sense intrinsically unworthy. Prescription ends by making\r\nlabour not only disreputable in the eyes of the community, but morally\r\nimpossible to the noble, freeborn man, and incompatible with a worthy\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThis tabu on labour has a further consequence in the industrial\r\ndifferentiation of classes. As the population increases in density\r\nand the predatory group grows into a settled industrial community, the\r\nconstituted authorities and the customs governing ownership gain in\r\nscope and consistency. It then presently becomes impracticable to\r\naccumulate wealth by simple seizure, and, in logical consistency,\r\nacquisition by industry is equally impossible for high minded and\r\nimpecunious men. The alternative open to them is beggary or privation.\r\nWherever the canon of conspicuous leisure has a chance undisturbed to\r\nwork out its tendency, there will therefore emerge a secondary, and in a\r\nsense spurious, leisure class--abjectly poor and living in a precarious\r\nlife of want and discomfort, but morally unable to stoop to gainful\r\npursuits. The decayed gentleman and the lady who has seen better days\r\nare by no means unfamiliar phenomena even now. This pervading sense\r\nof the indignity of the slightest manual labour is familiar to all\r\ncivilized peoples, as well as to peoples of a less advanced pecuniary\r\nculture. In persons of a delicate sensibility who have long been\r\nhabituated to gentle manners, the sense of the shamefulness of manual\r\nlabour may become so strong that, at a critical juncture, it will even\r\nset aside the instinct of self-preservation. So, for instance, we are\r\ntold of certain Polynesian chiefs, who, under the stress of good form,\r\npreferred to starve rather than carry their food to their mouths with\r\ntheir own hands. It is true, this conduct may have been due, at least in\r\npart, to an excessive sanctity or tabu attaching to the chief\'s person.\r\nThe tabu would have been communicated by the contact of his hands, and\r\nso would have made anything touched by him unfit for human food. But the\r\ntabu is itself a derivative of the unworthiness or moral incompatibility\r\nof labour; so that even when construed in this sense the conduct of the\r\nPolynesian chiefs is truer to the canon of honorific leisure than would\r\nat first appear. A better illustration, or at least a more unmistakable\r\none, is afforded by a certain king of France, who is said to have lost\r\nhis life through an excess of moral stamina in the observance of good\r\nform. In the absence of the functionary whose office it was to shift his\r\nmaster\'s seat, the king sat uncomplaining before the fire and suffered\r\nhis royal person to be toasted beyond recovery. But in so doing he saved\r\nhis Most Christian Majesty from menial contamination. Summum crede nefas\r\nanimam praeferre pudori, Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked that the term "leisure", as here used, does\r\nnot connote indolence or quiescence. What it connotes is non-productive\r\nconsumption of time. Time is consumed non-productively (1) from a\r\nsense of the unworthiness of productive work, and (2) as an evidence\r\nof pecuniary ability to afford a life of idleness. But the whole of the\r\nlife of the gentleman of leisure is not spent before the eyes of the\r\nspectators who are to be impressed with that spectacle of honorific\r\nleisure which in the ideal scheme makes up his life. For some part of\r\nthe time his life is perforce withdrawn from the public eye, and of this\r\nportion which is spent in private the gentleman of leisure should, for\r\nthe sake of his good name, be able to give a convincing account. He\r\nshould find some means of putting in evidence the leisure that is not\r\nspent in the sight of the spectators. This can be done only indirectly,\r\nthrough the exhibition of some tangible, lasting results of the leisure\r\nso spent--in a manner analogous to the familiar exhibition of tangible,\r\nlasting products of the labour performed for the gentleman of leisure by\r\nhandicraftsmen and servants in his employ.\r\n\r\nThe lasting evidence of productive labour is its material\r\nproduct--commonly some article of consumption. In the case of exploit it\r\nis similarly possible and usual to procure some tangible result that may\r\nserve for exhibition in the way of trophy or booty. At a later phase\r\nof the development it is customary to assume some badge of insignia of\r\nhonour that will serve as a conventionally accepted mark of exploit, and\r\nwhich at the same time indicates the quantity or degree of exploit of\r\nwhich it is the symbol. As the population increases in density, and as\r\nhuman relations grow more complex and numerous, all the details of life\r\nundergo a process of elaboration and selection; and in this process of\r\nelaboration the use of trophies develops into a system of rank, titles,\r\ndegrees and insignia, typical examples of which are heraldic devices,\r\nmedals, and honorary decorations.\r\n\r\nAs seen from the economic point of view, leisure, considered as an\r\nemployment, is closely allied in kind with the life of exploit; and the\r\nachievements which characterise a life of leisure, and which remain as\r\nits decorous criteria, have much in common with the trophies of exploit.\r\nBut leisure in the narrower sense, as distinct from exploit and from any\r\nostensibly productive employment of effort on objects which are of no\r\nintrinsic use, does not commonly leave a material product. The criteria\r\nof a past performance of leisure therefore commonly take the form\r\nof "immaterial" goods. Such immaterial evidences of past leisure are\r\nquasi-scholarly or quasi-artistic accomplishments and a knowledge of\r\nprocesses and incidents which do not conduce directly to the furtherance\r\nof human life. So, for instance, in our time there is the knowledge\r\nof the dead languages and the occult sciences; of correct spelling; of\r\nsyntax and prosody; of the various forms of domestic music and other\r\nhousehold art; of the latest properties of dress, furniture, and\r\nequipage; of games, sports, and fancy-bred animals, such as dogs and\r\nrace-horses. In all these branches of knowledge the initial motive from\r\nwhich their acquisition proceeded at the outset, and through which they\r\nfirst came into vogue, may have been something quite different from\r\nthe wish to show that one\'s time had not been spent in industrial\r\nemployment; but unless these accomplishments had approved themselves as\r\nserviceable evidence of an unproductive expenditure of time, they would\r\nnot have survived and held their place as conventional accomplishments\r\nof the leisure class.\r\n\r\nThese accomplishments may, in some sense, be classed as branches of\r\nlearning. Beside and beyond these there is a further range of social\r\nfacts which shade off from the region of learning into that of physical\r\nhabit and dexterity. Such are what is known as manners and breeding,\r\npolite usage, decorum, and formal and ceremonial observances generally.\r\nThis class of facts are even more immediately and obtrusively presented\r\nto the observation, and they therefore more widely and more imperatively\r\ninsisted on as required evidences of a reputable degree of leisure. It\r\nis worth while to remark that all that class of ceremonial observances\r\nwhich are classed under the general head of manners hold a more\r\nimportant place in the esteem of men during the stage of culture\r\nat which conspicuous leisure has the greatest vogue as a mark of\r\nreputability, than at later stages of the cultural development. The\r\nbarbarian of the quasi-peaceable stage of industry is notoriously a more\r\nhigh-bred gentleman, in all that concerns decorum, than any but the very\r\nexquisite among the men of a later age. Indeed, it is well known, or\r\nat least it is currently believed, that manners have progressively\r\ndeteriorated as society has receded from the patriarchal stage. Many a\r\ngentleman of the old school has been provoked to remark regretfully upon\r\nthe under-bred manners and bearing of even the better classes in the\r\nmodern industrial communities; and the decay of the ceremonial code--or\r\nas it is otherwise called, the vulgarisation of life--among the\r\nindustrial classes proper has become one of the chief enormities\r\nof latter-day civilisation in the eyes of all persons of delicate\r\nsensibilities. The decay which the code has suffered at the hands of a\r\nbusy people testifies--all depreciation apart--to the fact that decorum\r\nis a product and an exponent of leisure class life and thrives in full\r\nmeasure only under a regime of status.\r\n\r\nThe origin, or better the derivation, of manners is no doubt, to\r\nbe sought elsewhere than in a conscious effort on the part of the\r\nwell-mannered to show that much time has been spent in acquiring them.\r\nThe proximate end of innovation and elaboration has been the\r\nhigher effectiveness of the new departure in point of beauty or of\r\nexpressiveness. In great part the ceremonial code of decorous usages\r\nowes its beginning and its growth to the desire to conciliate or to\r\nshow good-will, as anthropologists and sociologists are in the habit\r\nof assuming, and this initial motive is rarely if ever absent from the\r\nconduct of well-mannered persons at any stage of the later development.\r\nManners, we are told, are in part an elaboration of gesture, and in part\r\nthey are symbolical and conventionalised survivals representing former\r\nacts of dominance or of personal service or of personal contact. In\r\nlarge part they are an expression of the relation of status,--a symbolic\r\npantomime of mastery on the one hand and of subservience on the other.\r\nWherever at the present time the predatory habit of mind, and the\r\nconsequent attitude of mastery and of subservience, gives its character\r\nto the accredited scheme of life, there the importance of all punctilios\r\nof conduct is extreme, and the assiduity with which the ceremonial\r\nobservance of rank and titles is attended to approaches closely to the\r\nideal set by the barbarian of the quasi-peaceable nomadic culture. Some\r\nof the Continental countries afford good illustrations of this spiritual\r\nsurvival. In these communities the archaic ideal is similarly approached\r\nas regards the esteem accorded to manners as a fact of intrinsic worth.\r\n\r\nDecorum set out with being symbol and pantomime and with having utility\r\nonly as an exponent of the facts and qualities symbolised; but it\r\npresently suffered the transmutation which commonly passes over\r\nsymbolical facts in human intercourse. Manners presently came, in\r\npopular apprehension, to be possessed of a substantial utility in\r\nthemselves; they acquired a sacramental character, in great measure\r\nindependent of the facts which they originally prefigured. Deviations\r\nfrom the code of decorum have become intrinsically odious to all\r\nmen, and good breeding is, in everyday apprehension, not simply an\r\nadventitious mark of human excellence, but an integral feature of\r\nthe worthy human soul. There are few things that so touch us with\r\ninstinctive revulsion as a breach of decorum; and so far have we\r\nprogressed in the direction of imputing intrinsic utility to the\r\nceremonial observances of etiquette that few of us, if any, can\r\ndissociate an offence against etiquette from a sense of the substantial\r\nunworthiness of the offender. A breach of faith may be condoned, but a\r\nbreach of decorum can not. "Manners maketh man."\r\n\r\nNone the less, while manners have this intrinsic utility, in the\r\napprehension of the performer and the beholder alike, this sense of the\r\nintrinsic rightness of decorum is only the proximate ground of the vogue\r\nof manners and breeding. Their ulterior, economic ground is to be sought\r\nin the honorific character of that leisure or non-productive employment\r\nof time and effort without which good manners are not acquired. The\r\nknowledge and habit of good form come only by long-continued use.\r\nRefined tastes, manners, habits of life are a useful evidence of\r\ngentility, because good breeding requires time, application and expense,\r\nand can therefore not be compassed by those whose time and energy are\r\ntaken up with work. A knowledge of good form is prima facie evidence\r\nthat that portion of the well-bred person\'s life which is not spent\r\nunder the observation of the spectator has been worthily spent in\r\nacquiring accomplishments that are of no lucrative effect. In the last\r\nanalysis the value of manners lies in the fact that they are the voucher\r\nof a life of leisure. Therefore, conversely, since leisure is the\r\nconventional means of pecuniary repute, the acquisition of some\r\nproficiency in decorum is incumbent on all who aspire to a modicum of\r\npecuniary decency.\r\n\r\nSo much of the honourable life of leisure as is not spent in the sight\r\nof spectators can serve the purposes of reputability only in so far as\r\nit leaves a tangible, visible result that can be put in evidence and can\r\nbe measured and compared with products of the same class exhibited\r\nby competing aspirants for repute. Some such effect, in the way of\r\nleisurely manners and carriage, etc., follows from simple persistent\r\nabstention from work, even where the subject does not take thought\r\nof the matter and studiously acquire an air of leisurely opulence and\r\nmastery. Especially does it seem to be true that a life of leisure\r\nin this way persisted in through several generations will leave a\r\npersistent, ascertainable effect in the conformation of the person,\r\nand still more in his habitual bearing and demeanour. But all the\r\nsuggestions of a cumulative life of leisure, and all the proficiency\r\nin decorum that comes by the way of passive habituation, may be further\r\nimproved upon by taking thought and assiduously acquiring the marks\r\nof honourable leisure, and then carrying the exhibition of these\r\nadventitious marks of exemption from employment out in a strenuous and\r\nsystematic discipline. Plainly, this is a point at which a diligent\r\napplication of effort and expenditure may materially further the\r\nattainment of a decent proficiency in the leisure-class properties.\r\nConversely, the greater the degree of proficiency and the more patent\r\nthe evidence of a high degree of habituation to observances which\r\nserve no lucrative or other directly useful purpose, the greater\r\nthe consumption of time and substance impliedly involved in their\r\nacquisition, and the greater the resultant good repute. Hence under the\r\ncompetitive struggle for proficiency in good manners, it comes about\r\nthat much pains in taken with the cultivation of habits of decorum; and\r\nhence the details of decorum develop into a comprehensive discipline,\r\nconformity to which is required of all who would be held blameless in\r\npoint of repute. And hence, on the other hand, this conspicuous leisure\r\nof which decorum is a ramification grows gradually into a laborious\r\ndrill in deportment and an education in taste and discrimination as\r\nto what articles of consumption are decorous and what are the decorous\r\nmethods of consuming them.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is worthy of notice that the possibility of\r\nproducing pathological and other idiosyncrasies of person and manner by\r\nshrewd mimicry and a systematic drill have been turned to account in\r\nthe deliberate production of a cultured class--often with a very happy\r\neffect. In this way, by the process vulgarly known as snobbery, a\r\nsyncopated evolution of gentle birth and breeding is achieved in\r\nthe case of a goodly number of families and lines of descent. This\r\nsyncopated gentle birth gives results which, in point of serviceability\r\nas a leisure-class factor in the population, are in no wise\r\nsubstantially inferior to others who may have had a longer but less\r\narduous training in the pecuniary properties.\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, measureable degrees of conformity to the latest\r\naccredited code of the punctilios as regards decorous means and methods\r\nof consumption. Differences between one person and another in the\r\ndegree of conformity to the ideal in these respects can be compared,\r\nand persons may be graded and scheduled with some accuracy and effect\r\naccording to a progressive scale of manners and breeding. The award\r\nof reputability in this regard is commonly made in good faith, on\r\nthe ground of conformity to accepted canons of taste in the matters\r\nconcerned, and without conscious regard to the pecuniary standing or the\r\ndegree of leisure practised by any given candidate for reputability; but\r\nthe canons of taste according to which the award is made are constantly\r\nunder the surveillance of the law of conspicuous leisure, and are indeed\r\nconstantly undergoing change and revision to bring them into closer\r\nconformity with its requirements. So that while the proximate ground of\r\ndiscrimination may be of another kind, still the pervading principle and\r\nabiding test of good breeding is the requirement of a substantial and\r\npatent waste of time. There may be some considerable range of variation\r\nin detail within the scope of this principle, but they are variations of\r\nform and expression, not of substance.\r\n\r\nMuch of the courtesy of everyday intercourse is of course a direct\r\nexpression of consideration and kindly good-will, and this element\r\nof conduct has for the most part no need of being traced back to any\r\nunderlying ground of reputability to explain either its presence or the\r\napproval with which it is regarded; but the same is not true of the code\r\nof properties. These latter are expressions of status. It is of course\r\nsufficiently plain, to any one who cares to see, that our bearing\r\ntowards menials and other pecuniary dependent inferiors is the bearing\r\nof the superior member in a relation of status, though its manifestation\r\nis often greatly modified and softened from the original expression of\r\ncrude dominance. Similarly, our bearing towards superiors, and in\r\ngreat measure towards equals, expresses a more or less conventionalised\r\nattitude of subservience. Witness the masterful presence of the\r\nhigh-minded gentleman or lady, which testifies to so much of dominance\r\nand independence of economic circumstances, and which at the same time\r\nappeals with such convincing force to our sense of what is right and\r\ngracious. It is among this highest leisure class, who have no superiors\r\nand few peers, that decorum finds its fullest and maturest expression;\r\nand it is this highest class also that gives decorum that definite\r\nformulation which serves as a canon of conduct for the classes beneath.\r\nAnd there also the code is most obviously a code of status and shows\r\nmost plainly its incompatibility with all vulgarly productive work. A\r\ndivine assurance and an imperious complaisance, as of one habituated\r\nto require subservience and to take no thought for the morrow, is the\r\nbirthright and the criterion of the gentleman at his best; and it is in\r\npopular apprehension even more than that, for this demeanour is accepted\r\nas an intrinsic attribute of superior worth, before which the base-born\r\ncommoner delights to stoop and yield.\r\n\r\nAs has been indicated in an earlier chapter, there is reason to believe\r\nthat the institution of ownership has begun with the ownership of\r\npersons, primarily women. The incentives to acquiring such property have\r\napparently been: (1) a propensity for dominance and coercion; (2) the\r\nutility of these persons as evidence of the prowess of the owner; (3)\r\nthe utility of their services.\r\n\r\nPersonal service holds a peculiar place in the economic development.\r\nDuring the stage of quasi-peaceable industry, and especially during the\r\nearlier development of industry within the limits of this general stage,\r\nthe utility of their services seems commonly to be the dominant motive\r\nto the acquisition of property in persons. Servants are valued for their\r\nservices. But the dominance of this motive is not due to a decline\r\nin the absolute importance of the other two utilities possessed by\r\nservants. It is rather that the altered circumstance of life accentuate\r\nthe utility of servants for this last-named purpose. Women and other\r\nslaves are highly valued, both as an evidence of wealth and as a means\r\nof accumulating wealth. Together with cattle, if the tribe is a pastoral\r\none, they are the usual form of investment for a profit. To such an\r\nextent may female slavery give its character to the economic life under\r\nthe quasi-peaceable culture that the women even comes to serve as a unit\r\nof value among peoples occupying this cultural stage--as for instance in\r\nHomeric times. Where this is the case there need be little question but\r\nthat the basis of the industrial system is chattel slavery and that the\r\nwomen are commonly slaves. The great, pervading human relation in such a\r\nsystem is that of master and servant. The accepted evidence of wealth is\r\nthe possession of many women, and presently also of other slaves engaged\r\nin attendance on their master\'s person and in producing goods for him.\r\n\r\nA division of labour presently sets in, whereby personal service and\r\nattendance on the master becomes the special office of a portion of the\r\nservants, while those who are wholly employed in industrial occupations\r\nproper are removed more and more from all immediate relation to the\r\nperson of their owner. At the same time those servants whose office\r\nis personal service, including domestic duties, come gradually to be\r\nexempted from productive industry carried on for gain.\r\n\r\nThis process of progressive exemption from the common run of industrial\r\nemployment will commonly begin with the exemption of the wife, or the\r\nchief wife. After the community has advanced to settled habits of life,\r\nwife-capture from hostile tribes becomes impracticable as a customary\r\nsource of supply. Where this cultural advance has been achieved, the\r\nchief wife is ordinarily of gentle blood, and the fact of her being so\r\nwill hasten her exemption from vulgar employment. The manner in which\r\nthe concept of gentle blood originates, as well as the place which it\r\noccupies in the development of marriage, cannot be discussed in this\r\nplace. For the purpose in hand it will be sufficient to say that gentle\r\nblood is blood which has been ennobled by protracted contact with\r\naccumulated wealth or unbroken prerogative. The women with these\r\nantecedents is preferred in marriage, both for the sake of a resulting\r\nalliance with her powerful relatives and because a superior worth is\r\nfelt to inhere in blood which has been associated with many goods and\r\ngreat power. She will still be her husband\'s chattel, as she was her\r\nfather\'s chattel before her purchase, but she is at the same time of\r\nher father\'s gentle blood; and hence there is a moral incongruity in her\r\noccupying herself with the debasing employments of her fellow-servants.\r\nHowever completely she may be subject to her master, and however\r\ninferior to the male members of the social stratum in which her birth\r\nhas placed her, the principle that gentility is transmissible will act\r\nto place her above the common slave; and so soon as this principle has\r\nacquired a prescriptive authority it will act to invest her in some\r\nmeasure with that prerogative of leisure which is the chief mark of\r\ngentility. Furthered by this principle of transmissible gentility the\r\nwife\'s exemption gains in scope, if the wealth of her owner permits it,\r\nuntil it includes exemption from debasing menial service as well as from\r\nhandicraft. As the industrial development goes on and property becomes\r\nmassed in relatively fewer hands, the conventional standard of wealth of\r\nthe upper class rises. The same tendency to exemption from handicraft,\r\nand in the course of time from menial domestic employments, will then\r\nassert itself as regards the other wives, if such there are, and also as\r\nregards other servants in immediate attendance upon the person of their\r\nmaster. The exemption comes more tardily the remoter the relation in\r\nwhich the servant stands to the person of the master.\r\n\r\nIf the pecuniary situation of the master permits it, the development of\r\na special class of personal or body servants is also furthered by the\r\nvery grave importance which comes to attach to this personal service.\r\nThe master\'s person, being the embodiment of worth and honour, is of\r\nthe most serious consequence. Both for his reputable standing in the\r\ncommunity and for his self-respect, it is a matter of moment that he\r\nshould have at his call efficient specialised servants, whose attendance\r\nupon his person is not diverted from this their chief office by any\r\nby-occupation. These specialised servants are useful more for show\r\nthan for service actually performed. In so far as they are not kept for\r\nexhibition simply, they afford gratification to their master chiefly in\r\nallowing scope to his propensity for dominance. It is true, the care of\r\nthe continually increasing household apparatus may require added labour;\r\nbut since the apparatus is commonly increased in order to serve as\r\na means of good repute rather than as a means of comfort, this\r\nqualification is not of great weight. All these lines of utility are\r\nbetter served by a larger number of more highly specialised servants.\r\nThere results, therefore, a constantly increasing differentiation and\r\nmultiplication of domestic and body servants, along with a concomitant\r\nprogressive exemption of such servants from productive labour. By virtue\r\nof their serving as evidence of ability to pay, the office of such\r\ndomestics regularly tends to include continually fewer duties, and their\r\nservice tends in the end to become nominal only. This is especially true\r\nof those servants who are in most immediate and obvious attendance upon\r\ntheir master. So that the utility of these comes to consist, in great\r\npart, in their conspicuous exemption from productive labour and in\r\nthe evidence which this exemption affords of their master\'s wealth and\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAfter some considerable advance has been made in the practice of\r\nemploying a special corps of servants for the performance of a\r\nconspicuous leisure in this manner, men begin to be preferred above\r\nwomen for services that bring them obtrusively into view. Men,\r\nespecially lusty, personable fellows, such as footmen and other menials\r\nshould be, are obviously more powerful and more expensive than women.\r\nThey are better fitted for this work, as showing a larger waste of time\r\nand of human energy. Hence it comes about that in the economy of the\r\nleisure class the busy housewife of the early patriarchal days, with her\r\nretinue of hard-working handmaidens, presently gives place to the lady\r\nand the lackey.\r\n\r\nIn all grades and walks of life, and at any stage of the economic\r\ndevelopment, the leisure of the lady and of the lackey differs from the\r\nleisure of the gentleman in his own right in that it is an occupation of\r\nan ostensibly laborious kind. It takes the form, in large measure, of\r\na painstaking attention to the service of the master, or to the\r\nmaintenance and elaboration of the household paraphernalia; so that\r\nit is leisure only in the sense that little or no productive work is\r\nperformed by this class, not in the sense that all appearance of\r\nlabour is avoided by them. The duties performed by the lady, or by the\r\nhousehold or domestic servants, are frequently arduous enough, and they\r\nare also frequently directed to ends which are considered extremely\r\nnecessary to the comfort of the entire household. So far as these\r\nservices conduce to the physical efficiency or comfort of the master\r\nor the rest of the household, they are to be accounted productive work.\r\nOnly the residue of employment left after deduction of this effective\r\nwork is to be classed as a performance of leisure.\r\n\r\nBut much of the services classed as household cares in modern everyday\r\nlife, and many of the "utilities" required for a comfortable existence\r\nby civilised man, are of a ceremonial character. They are, therefore,\r\nproperly to be classed as a performance of leisure in the sense in which\r\nthe term is here used. They may be none the less imperatively necessary\r\nfrom the point of view of decent existence: they may be none the less\r\nrequisite for personal comfort even, although they may be chiefly or\r\nwholly of a ceremonial character. But in so far as they partake of this\r\ncharacter they are imperative and requisite because we have been taught\r\nto require them under pain of ceremonial uncleanness or unworthiness. We\r\nfeel discomfort in their absence, but not because their absence results\r\ndirectly in physical discomfort; nor would a taste not trained to\r\ndiscriminate between the conventionally good and the conventionally bad\r\ntake offence at their omission. In so far as this is true the labour\r\nspent in these services is to be classed as leisure; and when performed\r\nby others than the economically free and self-directed head of the\r\nestablishment, they are to be classed as vicarious leisure.\r\n\r\nThe vicarious leisure performed by housewives and menials, under\r\nthe head of household cares, may frequently develop into drudgery,\r\nespecially where the competition for reputability is close and\r\nstrenuous. This is frequently the case in modern life. Where this\r\nhappens, the domestic service which comprises the duties of this\r\nservant class might aptly be designated as wasted effort, rather than as\r\nvicarious leisure. But the latter term has the advantage of indicating\r\nthe line of derivation of these domestic offices, as well as of neatly\r\nsuggesting the substantial economic ground of their utility; for\r\nthese occupations are chiefly useful as a method of imputing pecuniary\r\nreputability to the master or to the household on the ground that a\r\ngiven amount of time and effort is conspicuously wasted in that behalf.\r\n\r\nIn this way, then, there arises a subsidiary or derivative leisure\r\nclass, whose office is the performance of a vicarious leisure for the\r\nbehoof of the reputability of the primary or legitimate leisure class.\r\nThis vicarious leisure class is distinguished from the leisure class\r\nproper by a characteristic feature of its habitual mode of life. The\r\nleisure of the master class is, at least ostensibly, an indulgence of\r\na proclivity for the avoidance of labour and is presumed to enhance\r\nthe master\'s own well-being and fulness of life; but the leisure of\r\nthe servant class exempt from productive labour is in some sort a\r\nperformance exacted from them, and is not normally or primarily directed\r\nto their own comfort. The leisure of the servant is not his own leisure.\r\nSo far as he is a servant in the full sense, and not at the same time\r\na member of a lower order of the leisure class proper, his leisure\r\nnormally passes under the guise of specialised service directed to the\r\nfurtherance of his master\'s fulness of life. Evidence of this relation\r\nof subservience is obviously present in the servant\'s carriage and\r\nmanner of life. The like is often true of the wife throughout the\r\nprotracted economic stage during which she is still primarily a\r\nservant--that is to say, so long as the household with a male head\r\nremains in force. In order to satisfy the requirements of the leisure\r\nclass scheme of life, the servant should show not only an attitude of\r\nsubservience, but also the effects of special training and practice\r\nin subservience. The servant or wife should not only perform certain\r\noffices and show a servile disposition, but it is quite as imperative\r\nthat they should show an acquired facility in the tactics of\r\nsubservience--a trained conformity to the canons of effectual and\r\nconspicuous subservience. Even today it is this aptitude and acquired\r\nskill in the formal manifestation of the servile relation that\r\nconstitutes the chief element of utility in our highly paid servants, as\r\nwell as one of the chief ornaments of the well-bred housewife.\r\n\r\nThe first requisite of a good servant is that he should conspicuously\r\nknow his place. It is not enough that he knows how to effect certain\r\ndesired mechanical results; he must above all, know how to effect these\r\nresults in due form. Domestic service might be said to be a spiritual\r\nrather than a mechanical function. Gradually there grows up an elaborate\r\nsystem of good form, specifically regulating the manner in which this\r\nvicarious leisure of the servant class is to be performed. Any departure\r\nfrom these canons of form is to be depreciated, not so much because it\r\nevinces a shortcoming in mechanical efficiency, or even that it shows\r\nan absence of the servile attitude and temperament, but because, in\r\nthe last analysis, it shows the absence of special training. Special\r\ntraining in personal service costs time and effort, and where it is\r\nobviously present in a high degree, it argues that the servant who\r\npossesses it, neither is nor has been habitually engaged in any\r\nproductive occupation. It is prima facie evidence of a vicarious leisure\r\nextending far back in the past. So that trained service has utility, not\r\nonly as gratifying the master\'s instinctive liking for good and skilful\r\nworkmanship and his propensity for conspicuous dominance over those\r\nwhose lives are subservient to his own, but it has utility also as\r\nputting in evidence a much larger consumption of human service than\r\nwould be shown by the mere present conspicuous leisure performed by an\r\nuntrained person. It is a serious grievance if a gentleman\'s butler or\r\nfootman performs his duties about his master\'s table or carriage in\r\nsuch unformed style as to suggest that his habitual occupation may be\r\nploughing or sheepherding. Such bungling work would imply inability on\r\nthe master\'s part to procure the service of specially trained servants;\r\nthat is to say, it would imply inability to pay for the consumption\r\nof time, effort, and instruction required to fit a trained servant for\r\nspecial service under the exacting code of forms. If the performance of\r\nthe servant argues lack of means on the part of his master, it defeats\r\nits chief substantial end; for the chief use of servants is the evidence\r\nthey afford of the master\'s ability to pay.\r\n\r\nWhat has just been said might be taken to imply that the offence of an\r\nunder-trained servant lies in a direct suggestion of inexpensiveness or\r\nof usefulness. Such, of course, is not the case. The connection is much\r\nless immediate. What happens here is what happens generally. Whatever\r\napproves itself to us on any ground at the outset, presently comes to\r\nappeal to us as a gratifying thing in itself; it comes to rest in our\r\nhabits of though as substantially right. But in order that any specific\r\ncanon of deportment shall maintain itself in favour, it must continue to\r\nhave the support of, or at least not be incompatible with, the habit\r\nor aptitude which constitutes the norm of its development. The need of\r\nvicarious leisure, or conspicuous consumption of service, is a dominant\r\nincentive to the keeping of servants. So long as this remains true it\r\nmay be set down without much discussion that any such departure from\r\naccepted usage as would suggest an abridged apprenticeship in service\r\nwould presently be found insufferable. The requirement of an expensive\r\nvicarious leisure acts indirectly, selectively, by guiding the formation\r\nof our taste,--of our sense of what is right in these matters,--and so\r\nweeds out unconformable departures by withholding approval of them.\r\n\r\nAs the standard of wealth recognized by common consent advances,\r\nthe possession and exploitation of servants as a means of showing\r\nsuperfluity undergoes a refinement. The possession and maintenance of\r\nslaves employed in the production of goods argues wealth and prowess,\r\nbut the maintenance of servants who produce nothing argues still higher\r\nwealth and position. Under this principle there arises a class of\r\nservants, the more numerous the better, whose sole office is fatuously\r\nto wait upon the person of their owner, and so to put in evidence his\r\nability unproductively to consume a large amount of service. There\r\nsupervenes a division of labour among the servants or dependents whose\r\nlife is spent in maintaining the honour of the gentleman of leisure.\r\nSo that, while one group produces goods for him, another group, usually\r\nheaded by the wife, or chief, consumes for him in conspicuous leisure;\r\nthereby putting in evidence his ability to sustain large pecuniary\r\ndamage without impairing his superior opulence.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat idealized and diagrammatic outline of the development and\r\nnature of domestic service comes nearest being true for that cultural\r\nstage which was here been named the "quasi-peaceable" stage of industry.\r\nAt this stage personal service first rises to the position of an\r\neconomic institution, and it is at this stage that it occupies the\r\nlargest place in the community\'s scheme of life. In the cultural\r\nsequence, the quasi-peaceable stage follows the predatory stage proper,\r\nthe two being successive phases of barbarian life. Its characteristic\r\nfeature is a formal observance of peace and order, at the same time that\r\nlife at this stage still has too much of coercion and class antagonism\r\nto be called peaceable in the full sense of the word. For many purposes,\r\nand from another point of view than the economic one, it might as well\r\nbe named the stage of status. The method of human relation during this\r\nstage, and the spiritual attitude of men at this level of culture, is\r\nwell summed up under the term. But as a descriptive term to characterise\r\nthe prevailing methods of industry, as well as to indicate the trend\r\nof industrial development at this point in economic evolution, the term\r\n"quasi-peaceable" seems preferable. So far as concerns the communities\r\nof the Western culture, this phase of economic development probably\r\nlies in the past; except for a numerically small though very conspicuous\r\nfraction of the community in whom the habits of thought peculiar to the\r\nbarbarian culture have suffered but a relatively slight disintegration.\r\n\r\nPersonal service is still an element of great economic importance,\r\nespecially as regards the distribution and consumption of goods; but its\r\nrelative importance even in this direction is no doubt less than it once\r\nwas. The best development of this vicarious leisure lies in the past\r\nrather than in the present; and its best expression in the present is to\r\nbe found in the scheme of life of the upper leisure class. To this\r\nclass the modern culture owes much in the way of the conservation of\r\ntraditions, usages, and habits of thought which belong on a more archaic\r\ncultural plane, so far as regards their widest acceptance and their most\r\neffective development.\r\n\r\nIn the modern industrial communities the mechanical contrivances\r\navailable for the comfort and convenience of everyday life are highly\r\ndeveloped. So much so that body servants, or, indeed, domestic servants\r\nof any kind, would now scarcely be employed by anybody except on the\r\nground of a canon of reputability carried over by tradition from earlier\r\nusage. The only exception would be servants employed to attend on the\r\npersons of the infirm and the feeble-minded. But such servants properly\r\ncome under the head of trained nurses rather than under that of domestic\r\nservants, and they are, therefore, an apparent rather than a real\r\nexception to the rule.\r\n\r\nThe proximate reason for keeping domestic servants, for instance, in\r\nthe moderately well-to-do household of to-day, is (ostensibly) that the\r\nmembers of the household are unable without discomfort to compass the\r\nwork required by such a modern establishment. And the reason for their\r\nbeing unable to accomplish it is (1) that they have too many "social\r\nduties", and (2) that the work to be done is too severe and that there\r\nis too much of it. These two reasons may be restated as follows: (1)\r\nUnder the mandatory code of decency, the time and effort of the members\r\nof such a household are required to be ostensibly all spent in a\r\nperformance of conspicuous leisure, in the way of calls, drives, clubs,\r\nsewing-circles, sports, charity organisations, and other like social\r\nfunctions. Those persons whose time and energy are employed in these\r\nmatters privately avow that all these observances, as well as the\r\nincidental attention to dress and other conspicuous consumption, are\r\nvery irksome but altogether unavoidable. (2) Under the requirement of\r\nconspicuous consumption of goods, the apparatus of living has grown so\r\nelaborate and cumbrous, in the way of dwellings, furniture, bric-a-brac,\r\nwardrobe and meals, that the consumers of these things cannot make way\r\nwith them in the required manner without help. Personal contact with the\r\nhired persons whose aid is called in to fulfil the routine of decency is\r\ncommonly distasteful to the occupants of the house, but their presence\r\nis endured and paid for, in order to delegate to them a share in\r\nthis onerous consumption of household goods. The presence of domestic\r\nservants, and of the special class of body servants in an eminent\r\ndegree, is a concession of physical comfort to the moral need of\r\npecuniary decency.\r\n\r\nThe largest manifestation of vicarious leisure in modern life is made\r\nup of what are called domestic duties. These duties are fast becoming a\r\nspecies of services performed, not so much for the individual behoof of\r\nthe head of the household as for the reputability of the household taken\r\nas a corporate unit--a group of which the housewife is a member on a\r\nfooting of ostensible equality. As fast as the household for which they\r\nare performed departs from its archaic basis of ownership-marriage,\r\nthese household duties of course tend to fall out of the category of\r\nvicarious leisure in the original sense; except so far as they are\r\nperformed by hired servants. That is to say, since vicarious leisure\r\nis possible only on a basis of status or of hired service, the\r\ndisappearance of the relation of status from human intercourse at any\r\npoint carries with it the disappearance of vicarious leisure so far as\r\nregards that much of life. But it is to be added, in qualification of\r\nthis qualification, that so long as the household subsists, even with a\r\ndivided head, this class of non-productive labour performed for the\r\nsake of the household reputability must still be classed as vicarious\r\nleisure, although in a slightly altered sense. It is now leisure\r\nperformed for the quasi-personal corporate household, instead of, as\r\nformerly, for the proprietary head of the household.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Four ~~ Conspicuous Consumption\r\n\r\nIn what has been said of the evolution of the vicarious leisure class\r\nand its differentiation from the general body of the working classes,\r\nreference has been made to a further division of labour,--that between\r\nthe different servant classes. One portion of the servant class, chiefly\r\nthose persons whose occupation is vicarious leisure, come to undertake a\r\nnew, subsidiary range of duties--the vicarious consumption of goods.\r\nThe most obvious form in which this consumption occurs is seen in the\r\nwearing of liveries and the occupation of spacious servants\' quarters.\r\nAnother, scarcely less obtrusive or less effective form of vicarious\r\nconsumption, and a much more widely prevalent one, is the consumption of\r\nfood, clothing, dwelling, and furniture by the lady and the rest of the\r\ndomestic establishment.\r\n\r\nBut already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the\r\nemergence of the lady, specialised consumption of goods as an evidence\r\nof pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate\r\nsystem. The beginning of a differentiation in consumption even antedates\r\nthe appearance of anything that can fairly be called pecuniary strength.\r\nIt is traceable back to the initial phase of predatory culture, and\r\nthere is even a suggestion that an incipient differentiation in this\r\nrespect lies back of the beginnings of the predatory life. This most\r\nprimitive differentiation in the consumption of goods is like the later\r\ndifferentiation with which we are all so intimately familiar, in that it\r\nis largely of a ceremonial character, but unlike the latter it does not\r\nrest on a difference in accumulated wealth. The utility of consumption\r\nas an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth. It\r\nis an adaption to a new end, by a selective process, of a distinction\r\npreviously existing and well established in men\'s habits of thought.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier phases of the predatory culture the only economic\r\ndifferentiation is a broad distinction between an honourable superior\r\nclass made up of the able-bodied men on the one side, and a base\r\ninferior class of labouring women on the other. According to the ideal\r\nscheme of life in force at the time it is the office of the men to\r\nconsume what the women produce. Such consumption as falls to the women\r\nis merely incidental to their work; it is a means to their continued\r\nlabour, and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness\r\nof life. Unproductive consumption of goods is honourable, primarily as\r\na mark of prowess and a perquisite of human dignity; secondarily it\r\nbecomes substantially honourable to itself, especially the consumption\r\nof the more desirable things. The consumption of choice articles of\r\nfood, and frequently also of rare articles of adornment, becomes tabu to\r\nthe women and children; and if there is a base (servile) class of men,\r\nthe tabu holds also for them. With a further advance in culture this\r\ntabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character;\r\nbut whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is\r\nmaintained, whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality, the\r\nfeatures of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change\r\neasily. When the quasi-peaceable stage of industry is reached, with its\r\nfundamental institution of chattel slavery, the general principle, more\r\nor less rigorously applied, is that the base, industrious class should\r\nconsume only what may be necessary to their subsistence. In the nature\r\nof things, luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure\r\nclass. Under the tabu, certain victuals, and more particularly certain\r\nbeverages, are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial differentiation of the dietary is best seen in the use of\r\nintoxicating beverages and narcotics. If these articles of consumption\r\nare costly, they are felt to be noble and honorific. Therefore the\r\nbase classes, primarily the women, practice an enforced continence\r\nwith respect to these stimulants, except in countries where they are\r\nobtainable at a very low cost. From archaic times down through all the\r\nlength of the patriarchal regime it has been the office of the women to\r\nprepare and administer these luxuries, and it has been the perquisite\r\nof the men of gentle birth and breeding to consume them. Drunkenness\r\nand the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants\r\ntherefore tend in their turn to become honorific, as being a mark,\r\nat the second remove, of the superior status of those who are able to\r\nafford the indulgence. Infirmities induced by over-indulgence are among\r\nsome peoples freely recognised as manly attributes. It has even happened\r\nthat the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from\r\nsuch an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for "noble"\r\nor "gentle". It is only at a relatively early stage of culture that the\r\nsymptoms of expensive vice are conventionally accepted as marks of a\r\nsuperior status, and so tend to become virtues and command the deference\r\nof the community; but the reputability that attaches to certain\r\nexpensive vices long retains so much of its force as to appreciably\r\nlesson the disapprobation visited upon the men of the wealthy or noble\r\nclass for any excessive indulgence. The same invidious distinction adds\r\nforce to the current disapproval of any indulgence of this kind on\r\nthe part of women, minors, and inferiors. This invidious traditional\r\ndistinction has not lost its force even among the more advanced peoples\r\nof today. Where the example set by the leisure class retains its\r\nimperative force in the regulation of the conventionalities, it is\r\nobservable that the women still in great measure practise the same\r\ntraditional continence with regard to stimulants.\r\n\r\nThis characterisation of the greater continence in the use of stimulants\r\npractised by the women of the reputable classes may seem an excessive\r\nrefinement of logic at the expense of common sense. But facts within\r\neasy reach of any one who cares to know them go to say that the\r\ngreater abstinence of women is in some part due to an imperative\r\nconventionality; and this conventionality is, in a general way,\r\nstrongest where the patriarchal tradition--the tradition that the woman\r\nis a chattel--has retained its hold in greatest vigour. In a sense which\r\nhas been greatly qualified in scope and rigour, but which has by no\r\nmeans lost its meaning even yet, this tradition says that the\r\nwoman, being a chattel, should consume only what is necessary to her\r\nsustenance,--except so far as her further consumption contributes to the\r\ncomfort or the good repute of her master. The consumption of luxuries,\r\nin the true sense, is a consumption directed to the comfort of the\r\nconsumer himself, and is, therefore, a mark of the master. Any such\r\nconsumption by others can take place only on a basis of sufferance. In\r\ncommunities where the popular habits of thought have been profoundly\r\nshaped by the patriarchal tradition we may accordingly look for\r\nsurvivals of the tabu on luxuries at least to the extent of a\r\nconventional deprecation of their use by the unfree and dependent class.\r\nThis is more particularly true as regards certain luxuries, the use of\r\nwhich by the dependent class would detract sensibly from the comfort\r\nor pleasure of their masters, or which are held to be of doubtful\r\nlegitimacy on other grounds. In the apprehension of the great\r\nconservative middle class of Western civilisation the use of these\r\nvarious stimulants is obnoxious to at least one, if not both, of these\r\nobjections; and it is a fact too significant to be passed over that it\r\nis precisely among these middle classes of the Germanic culture, with\r\ntheir strong surviving sense of the patriarchal proprieties, that\r\nthe women are to the greatest extent subject to a qualified tabu on\r\nnarcotics and alcoholic beverages. With many qualifications--with more\r\nqualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened--the\r\ngeneral rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume\r\nonly for the benefit of their masters. The objection of course presents\r\nitself that expenditure on women\'s dress and household paraphernalia is\r\nan obvious exception to this rule; but it will appear in the sequel that\r\nthis exception is much more obvious than substantial. During the earlier\r\nstages of economic development, consumption of goods without stint,\r\nespecially consumption of the better grades of goods,--ideally all\r\nconsumption in excess of the subsistence minimum,--pertains normally\r\nto the leisure class. This restriction tends to disappear, at least\r\nformally, after the later peaceable stage has been reached, with private\r\nownership of goods and an industrial system based on wage labour or\r\non the petty household economy. But during the earlier quasi-peaceable\r\nstage, when so many of the traditions through which the institution of a\r\nleisure class has affected the economic life of later times were taking\r\nform and consistency, this principle has had the force of a conventional\r\nlaw. It has served as the norm to which consumption has tended to\r\nconform, and any appreciable departure from it is to be regarded as\r\nan aberrant form, sure to be eliminated sooner or later in the further\r\ncourse of development.\r\n\r\nThe quasi-peaceable gentleman of leisure, then, not only consumes of the\r\nstaff of life beyond the minimum required for subsistence and physical\r\nefficiency, but his consumption also undergoes a specialisation as\r\nregards the quality of the goods consumed. He consumes freely and of the\r\nbest, in food, drink, narcotics, shelter, services, ornaments, apparel,\r\nweapons and accoutrements, amusements, amulets, and idols or divinities.\r\nIn the process of gradual amelioration which takes place in the articles\r\nof his consumption, the motive principle and proximate aim of innovation\r\nis no doubt the higher efficiency of the improved and more elaborate\r\nproducts for personal comfort and well-being. But that does not remain\r\nthe sole purpose of their consumption. The canon of reputability is at\r\nhand and seizes upon such innovations as are, according to its standard,\r\nfit to survive. Since the consumption of these more excellent goods is\r\nan evidence of wealth, it becomes honorific; and conversely, the failure\r\nto consume in due quantity and quality becomes a mark of inferiority and\r\ndemerit.\r\n\r\nThis growth of punctilious discrimination as to qualitative excellence\r\nin eating, drinking, etc. presently affects not only the manner of life,\r\nbut also the training and intellectual activity of the gentleman of\r\nleisure. He is no longer simply the successful, aggressive male,--the\r\nman of strength, resource, and intrepidity. In order to avoid\r\nstultification he must also cultivate his tastes, for it now becomes\r\nincumbent on him to discriminate with some nicety between the noble and\r\nthe ignoble in consumable goods. He becomes a connoisseur in creditable\r\nviands of various degrees of merit, in manly beverages and trinkets,\r\nin seemly apparel and architecture, in weapons, games, dancers, and\r\nthe narcotics. This cultivation of aesthetic faculty requires time and\r\napplication, and the demands made upon the gentleman in this direction\r\ntherefore tend to change his life of leisure into a more or less arduous\r\napplication to the business of learning how to live a life of ostensible\r\nleisure in a becoming way. Closely related to the requirement that the\r\ngentleman must consume freely and of the right kind of goods, there\r\nis the requirement that he must know how to consume them in a seemly\r\nmanner. His life of leisure must be conducted in due form. Hence arise\r\ngood manners in the way pointed out in an earlier chapter. High-bred\r\nmanners and ways of living are items of conformity to the norm of\r\nconspicuous leisure and conspicuous consumption.\r\n\r\nConspicuous consumption of valuable goods is a means of reputability to\r\nthe gentleman of leisure. As wealth accumulates on his hands, his\r\nown unaided effort will not avail to sufficiently put his opulence in\r\nevidence by this method. The aid of friends and competitors is therefore\r\nbrought in by resorting to the giving of valuable presents and expensive\r\nfeasts and entertainments. Presents and feasts had probably another\r\norigin than that of naive ostentation, but they required their utility\r\nfor this purpose very early, and they have retained that character to\r\nthe present; so that their utility in this respect has now long been the\r\nsubstantial ground on which these usages rest. Costly entertainments,\r\nsuch as the potlatch or the ball, are peculiarly adapted to serve this\r\nend. The competitor with whom the entertainer wishes to institute a\r\ncomparison is, by this method, made to serve as a means to the end. He\r\nconsumes vicariously for his host at the same time that he is witness to\r\nthe consumption of that excess of good things which his host is unable\r\nto dispose of single-handed, and he is also made to witness his host\'s\r\nfacility in etiquette.\r\n\r\nIn the giving of costly entertainments other motives, of more genial\r\nkind, are of course also present. The custom of festive gatherings\r\nprobably originated in motives of conviviality and religion; these\r\nmotives are also present in the later development, but they do\r\nnot continue to be the sole motives. The latter-day leisure-class\r\nfestivities and entertainments may continue in some slight degree to\r\nserve the religious need and in a higher degree the needs of recreation\r\nand conviviality, but they also serve an invidious purpose; and they\r\nserve it none the less effectually for having a colorable non-invidious\r\nground in these more avowable motives. But the economic effect of these\r\nsocial amenities is not therefore lessened, either in the vicarious\r\nconsumption of goods or in the exhibition of difficult and costly\r\nachievements in etiquette.\r\n\r\nAs wealth accumulates, the leisure class develops further in function\r\nand structure, and there arises a differentiation within the class.\r\nThere is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades. This\r\ndifferentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the\r\nconsequent inheritance of gentility. With the inheritance of gentility\r\ngoes the inheritance of obligatory leisure; and gentility of a\r\nsufficient potency to entail a life of leisure may be inherited without\r\nthe complement of wealth required to maintain a dignified leisure.\r\nGentle blood may be transmitted without goods enough to afford a\r\nreputably free consumption at one\'s ease. Hence results a class of\r\nimpecunious gentlemen of leisure, incidentally referred to already.\r\nThese half-caste gentlemen of leisure fall into a system of hierarchical\r\ngradations. Those who stand near the higher and the highest grades of\r\nthe wealthy leisure class, in point of birth, or in point of wealth, or\r\nboth, outrank the remoter-born and the pecuniarily weaker. These lower\r\ngrades, especially the impecunious, or marginal, gentlemen of leisure,\r\naffiliate themselves by a system of dependence or fealty to the great\r\nones; by so doing they gain an increment of repute, or of the means\r\nwith which to lead a life of leisure, from their patron. They become\r\nhis courtiers or retainers, servants; and being fed and countenanced by\r\ntheir patron they are indices of his rank and vicarious consumer of his\r\nsuperfluous wealth. Many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at\r\nthe same time lesser men of substance in their own right; so that some\r\nof them are scarcely at all, others only partially, to be rated as\r\nvicarious consumers. So many of them, however, as make up the retainer\r\nand hangers-on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer\r\nwithout qualification. Many of these again, and also many of the other\r\naristocracy of less degree, have in turn attached to their persons a\r\nmore or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of\r\ntheir wives and children, their servants, retainers, etc.\r\n\r\nThroughout this graduated scheme of vicarious leisure and vicarious\r\nconsumption the rule holds that these offices must be performed in some\r\nsuch manner, or under some such circumstance or insignia, as shall point\r\nplainly to the master to whom this leisure or consumption pertains,\r\nand to whom therefore the resulting increment of good repute of right\r\ninures. The consumption and leisure executed by these persons for their\r\nmaster or patron represents an investment on his part with a view to an\r\nincrease of good fame. As regards feasts and largesses this is obvious\r\nenough, and the imputation of repute to the host or patron here takes\r\nplace immediately, on the ground of common notoriety. Where leisure\r\nand consumption is performed vicariously by henchmen and retainers,\r\nimputation of the resulting repute to the patron is effected by their\r\nresiding near his person so that it may be plain to all men from what\r\nsource they draw. As the group whose good esteem is to be secured in\r\nthis way grows larger, more patent means are required to indicate the\r\nimputation of merit for the leisure performed, and to this end uniforms,\r\nbadges, and liveries come into vogue. The wearing of uniforms or\r\nliveries implies a considerable degree of dependence, and may even\r\nbe said to be a mark of servitude, real or ostensible. The wearers of\r\nuniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes-the free\r\nand the servile, or the noble and the ignoble. The services performed\r\nby them are likewise divisible into noble and ignoble. Of course the\r\ndistinction is not observed with strict consistency in practice; the\r\nless debasing of the base services and the less honorific of the noble\r\nfunctions are not infrequently merged in the same person. But the\r\ngeneral distinction is not on that account to be overlooked. What\r\nmay add some perplexity is the fact that this fundamental distinction\r\nbetween noble and ignoble, which rests on the nature of the ostensible\r\nservice performed, is traversed by a secondary distinction into\r\nhonorific and humiliating, resting on the rank of the person for whom\r\nthe service is performed or whose livery is worn. So, those offices\r\nwhich are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are\r\nnoble; such as government, fighting, hunting, the care of arms and\r\naccoutrements, and the like--in short, those which may be classed as\r\nostensibly predatory employments. On the other hand, those employments\r\nwhich properly fall to the industrious class are ignoble; such as\r\nhandicraft or other productive labor, menial services and the like. But\r\na base service performed for a person of very high degree may become a\r\nvery honorific office; as for instance the office of a Maid of Honor or\r\nof a Lady in Waiting to the Queen, or the King\'s Master of the Horse or\r\nhis Keeper of the Hounds. The two offices last named suggest a principle\r\nof some general bearing. Whenever, as in these cases, the menial service\r\nin question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments\r\nof fighting and hunting, it easily acquires a reflected honorific\r\ncharacter. In this way great honor may come to attach to an employment\r\nwhich in its own nature belongs to the baser sort. In the later\r\ndevelopment of peaceable industry, the usage of employing an idle corps\r\nof uniformed men-at-arms gradually lapses. Vicarious consumption by\r\ndependents bearing the insignia of their patron or master narrows down\r\nto a corps of liveried menials. In a heightened degree, therefore, the\r\nlivery comes to be a badge of servitude, or rather servility. Something\r\nof a honorific character always attached to the livery of the armed\r\nretainer, but this honorific character disappears when the livery\r\nbecomes the exclusive badge of the menial. The livery becomes obnoxious\r\nto nearly all who are required to wear it. We are yet so little removed\r\nfrom a state of effective slavery as still to be fully sensitive to the\r\nsting of any imputation of servility. This antipathy asserts itself\r\neven in the case of the liveries or uniforms which some corporations\r\nprescribe as the distinctive dress of their employees. In this country\r\nthe aversion even goes the length of discrediting--in a mild and\r\nuncertain way--those government employments, military and civil, which\r\nrequire the wearing of a livery or uniform.\r\n\r\nWith the disappearance of servitude, the number of vicarious consumers\r\nattached to any one gentleman tends, on the whole, to decrease. The like\r\nis of course true, and perhaps in a still higher degree, of the number\r\nof dependents who perform vicarious leisure for him. In a general way,\r\nthough not wholly nor consistently, these two groups coincide. The\r\ndependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife, or the\r\nchief wife; and, as would be expected, in the later development of\r\nthe institution, when the number of persons by whom these duties are\r\ncustomarily performed gradually narrows, the wife remains the last.\r\nIn the higher grades of society a large volume of both these kinds of\r\nservice is required; and here the wife is of course still assisted in\r\nthe work by a more or less numerous corps of menials. But as we descend\r\nthe social scale, the point is presently reached where the duties of\r\nvicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone. In the\r\ncommunities of the Western culture, this point is at present found among\r\nthe lower middle class.\r\n\r\nAnd here occurs a curious inversion. It is a fact of common observance\r\nthat in this lower middle class there is no pretense of leisure on the\r\npart of the head of the household. Through force of circumstances it\r\nhas fallen into disuse. But the middle-class wife still carries on the\r\nbusiness of vicarious leisure, for the good name of the household and\r\nits master. In descending the social scale in any modern industrial\r\ncommunity, the primary fact-the conspicuous leisure of the master of\r\nthe household-disappears at a relatively high point. The head of the\r\nmiddle-class household has been reduced by economic circumstances to\r\nturn his hand to gaining a livelihood by occupations which often partake\r\nlargely of the character of industry, as in the case of the ordinary\r\nbusiness man of today. But the derivative fact-the vicarious leisure\r\nand consumption rendered by the wife, and the auxiliary vicarious\r\nperformance of leisure by menials-remains in vogue as a conventionality\r\nwhich the demands of reputability will not suffer to be slighted. It is\r\nby no means an uncommon spectacle to find a man applying himself to work\r\nwith the utmost assiduity, in order that his wife may in due form render\r\nfor him that degree of vicarious leisure which the common sense of the\r\ntime demands.\r\n\r\nThe leisure rendered by the wife in such cases is, of course, not a\r\nsimple manifestation of idleness or indolence. It almost invariably\r\noccurs disguised under some form of work or household duties or social\r\namenities, which prove on analysis to serve little or no ulterior end\r\nbeyond showing that she does not occupy herself with anything that is\r\ngainful or that is of substantial use. As has already been noticed under\r\nthe head of manners, the greater part of the customary round of domestic\r\ncares to which the middle-class housewife gives her time and effort is\r\nof this character. Not that the results of her attention to household\r\nmatters, of a decorative and mundificatory character, are not pleasing\r\nto the sense of men trained in middle-class proprieties; but the taste\r\nto which these effects of household adornment and tidiness appeal is a\r\ntaste which has been formed under the selective guidance of a canon\r\nof propriety that demands just these evidences of wasted effort. The\r\neffects are pleasing to us chiefly because we have been taught to find\r\nthem pleasing. There goes into these domestic duties much solicitude for\r\na proper combination of form and color, and for other ends that are to\r\nbe classed as aesthetic in the proper sense of the term; and it is\r\nnot denied that effects having some substantial aesthetic value are\r\nsometimes attained. Pretty much all that is here insisted on is that, as\r\nregards these amenities of life, the housewife\'s efforts are under the\r\nguidance of traditions that have been shaped by the law of conspicuously\r\nwasteful expenditure of time and substance. If beauty or comfort is\r\nachieved-and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they\r\nare-they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves\r\nto the great economic law of wasted effort. The more reputable,\r\n"presentable" portion of middle-class household paraphernalia are, on\r\nthe one hand, items of conspicuous consumption, and on the other hand,\r\napparatus for putting in evidence the vicarious leisure rendered by the\r\nhousewife.\r\n\r\nThe requirement of vicarious consumption at the hands of the wife\r\ncontinues in force even at a lower point in the pecuniary scale than the\r\nrequirement of vicarious leisure. At a point below which little if any\r\npretense of wasted effort, in ceremonial cleanness and the like,\r\nis observable, and where there is assuredly no conscious attempt at\r\nostensible leisure, decency still requires the wife to consume some\r\ngoods conspicuously for the reputability of the household and its head.\r\nSo that, as the latter-day outcome of this evolution of an archaic\r\ninstitution, the wife, who was at the outset the drudge and chattel of\r\nthe man, both in fact and in theory--the producer of goods for him to\r\nconsume--has become the ceremonial consumer of goods which he produces.\r\nBut she still quite unmistakably remains his chattel in theory; for the\r\nhabitual rendering of vicarious leisure and consumption is the abiding\r\nmark of the unfree servant.\r\n\r\nThis vicarious consumption practiced by the household of the middle\r\nand lower classes can not be counted as a direct expression of the\r\nleisure-class scheme of life, since the household of this pecuniary\r\ngrade does not belong within the leisure class. It is rather that the\r\nleisure-class scheme of life here comes to an expression at the second\r\nremove. The leisure class stands at the head of the social structure in\r\npoint of reputability; and its manner of life and its standards of\r\nworth therefore afford the norm of reputability for the community. The\r\nobservance of these standards, in some degree of approximation, becomes\r\nincumbent upon all classes lower in the scale. In modern civilized\r\ncommunities the lines of demarcation between social classes have grown\r\nvague and transient, and wherever this happens the norm of reputability\r\nimposed by the upper class extends its coercive influence with but\r\nslight hindrance down through the social structure to the lowest strata.\r\nThe result is that the members of each stratum accept as their ideal of\r\ndecency the scheme of life in vogue in the next higher stratum, and bend\r\ntheir energies to live up to that ideal. On pain of forfeiting their\r\ngood name and their self-respect in case of failure, they must conform\r\nto the accepted code, at least in appearance. The basis on which good\r\nrepute in any highly organized industrial community ultimately rests is\r\npecuniary strength; and the means of showing pecuniary strength, and\r\nso of gaining or retaining a good name, are leisure and a conspicuous\r\nconsumption of goods. Accordingly, both of these methods are in vogue\r\nas far down the scale as it remains possible; and in the lower strata\r\nin which the two methods are employed, both offices are in great part\r\ndelegated to the wife and children of the household. Lower still, where\r\nany degree of leisure, even ostensible, has become impracticable for the\r\nwife, the conspicuous consumption of goods remains and is carried on by\r\nthe wife and children. The man of the household also can do something\r\nin this direction, and indeed, he commonly does; but with a still lower\r\ndescent into the levels of indigence--along the margin of the slums--the\r\nman, and presently also the children, virtually cease to consume\r\nvaluable goods for appearances, and the woman remains virtually the sole\r\nexponent of the household\'s pecuniary decency. No class of society,\r\nnot even the most abjectly poor, forgoes all customary conspicuous\r\nconsumption. The last items of this category of consumption are not\r\ngiven up except under stress of the direst necessity. Very much of\r\nsqualor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the\r\nlast pretense of pecuniary decency is put away. There is no class and\r\nno country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical\r\nwant as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing survey of the growth of conspicuous leisure and\r\nconsumption, it appears that the utility of both alike for the purposes\r\nof reputability lies in the element of waste that is common to both.\r\nIn the one case it is a waste of time and effort, in the other it is\r\na waste of goods. Both are methods of demonstrating the possession of\r\nwealth, and the two are conventionally accepted as equivalents. The\r\nchoice between them is a question of advertising expediency simply,\r\nexcept so far as it may be affected by other standards of propriety,\r\nspringing from a different source. On grounds of expediency the\r\npreference may be given to the one or the other at different stages of\r\nthe economic development. The question is, which of the two methods will\r\nmost effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired\r\nto affect. Usage has answered this question in different ways under\r\ndifferent circumstances.\r\n\r\nSo long as the community or social group is small enough and compact\r\nenough to be effectually reached by common notoriety alone that is\r\nto say, so long as the human environment to which the individual is\r\nrequired to adapt himself in respect of reputability is comprised within\r\nhis sphere of personal acquaintance and neighborhood gossip--so long the\r\none method is about as effective as the other. Each will therefore serve\r\nabout equally well during the earlier stages of social growth. But when\r\nthe differentiation has gone farther and it becomes necessary to reach\r\na wider human environment, consumption begins to hold over leisure as\r\nan ordinary means of decency. This is especially true during the later,\r\npeaceable economic stage. The means of communication and the mobility\r\nof the population now expose the individual to the observation of many\r\npersons who have no other means of judging of his reputability than\r\nthe display of goods (and perhaps of breeding) which he is able to make\r\nwhile he is under their direct observation.\r\n\r\nThe modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by\r\nanother line. The exigencies of the modern industrial system frequently\r\nplace individuals and households in juxtaposition between whom there\r\nis little contact in any other sense than that of juxtaposition.\r\nOne\'s neighbors, mechanically speaking, often are socially not one\'s\r\nneighbors, or even acquaintances; and still their transient good opinion\r\nhas a high degree of utility. The only practicable means of impressing\r\none\'s pecuniary ability on these unsympathetic observers of one\'s\r\neveryday life is an unremitting demonstration of ability to pay. In\r\nthe modern community there is also a more frequent attendance at large\r\ngatherings of people to whom one\'s everyday life is unknown; in such\r\nplaces as churches, theaters, ballrooms, hotels, parks, shops, and the\r\nlike. In order to impress these transient observers, and to retain\r\none\'s self-complacency under their observation, the signature of one\'s\r\npecuniary strength should be written in characters which he who runs\r\nmay read. It is evident, therefore, that the present trend of\r\nthe development is in the direction of heightening the utility of\r\nconspicuous consumption as compared with leisure.\r\n\r\nIt is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means\r\nof repute, as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency, is\r\nat its best in those portions of the community where the human contact\r\nof the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is\r\ngreatest. Conspicuous consumption claims a relatively larger portion of\r\nthe income of the urban than of the rural population, and the claim is\r\nalso more imperative. The result is that, in order to keep up a decent\r\nappearance, the former habitually live hand-to-mouth to a greater extent\r\nthan the latter. So it comes, for instance, that the American farmer and\r\nhis wife and daughters are notoriously less modish in their dress, as\r\nwell as less urbane in their manners, than the city artisan\'s family\r\nwith an equal income. It is not that the city population is by nature\r\nmuch more eager for the peculiar complacency that comes of a conspicuous\r\nconsumption, nor has the rural population less regard for pecuniary\r\ndecency. But the provocation to this line of evidence, as well as its\r\ntransient effectiveness, is more decided in the city. This method is\r\ntherefore more readily resorted to, and in the struggle to outdo one\r\nanother the city population push their normal standard of conspicuous\r\nconsumption to a higher point, with the result that a relatively greater\r\nexpenditure in this direction is required to indicate a given degree\r\nof pecuniary decency in the city. The requirement of conformity to this\r\nhigher conventional standard becomes mandatory. The standard of decency\r\nis higher, class for class, and this requirement of decent appearance\r\nmust be lived up to on pain of losing caste.\r\n\r\nConsumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the\r\ncity than in the country. Among the country population its place is to\r\nsome extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium\r\nof neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of\r\nPecuniary repute. These home comforts and the leisure indulged in--where\r\nthe indulgence is found--are of course also in great part to be classed\r\nas items of conspicuous consumption; and much the same is to be said of\r\nthe savings. The smaller amount of the savings laid by by the artisan\r\nclass is no doubt due, in some measure, to the fact that in the case\r\nof the artisan the savings are a less effective means of advertisement,\r\nrelative to the environment in which he is placed, than are the savings\r\nof the people living on farms and in the small villages. Among the\r\nlatter, everybody\'s affairs, especially everybody\'s pecuniary status,\r\nare known to everybody else. Considered by itself simply--taken in the\r\nfirst degree--this added provocation to which the artisan and the urban\r\nlaboring classes are exposed may not very seriously decrease the amount\r\nof savings; but in its cumulative action, through raising the standard\r\nof decent expenditure, its deterrent effect on the tendency to save\r\ncannot but be very great.\r\n\r\nA felicitous illustration of the manner in which this canon of\r\nreputability works out its results is seen in the practice of\r\ndram-drinking, "treating," and smoking in public places, which is\r\ncustomary among the laborers and handicraftsmen of the towns, and among\r\nthe lower middle class of the urban population generally Journeymen\r\nprinters may be named as a class among whom this form of conspicuous\r\nconsumption has a great vogue, and among whom it carries with it certain\r\nwell-marked consequences that are often deprecated. The peculiar habits\r\nof the class in this respect are commonly set down to some kind of an\r\nill-defined moral deficiency with which this class is credited, or to\r\na morally deleterious influence which their occupation is supposed to\r\nexert, in some unascertainable way, upon the men employed in it. The\r\nstate of the case for the men who work in the composition and press\r\nrooms of the common run of printing-houses may be summed up as follows.\r\nSkill acquired in any printing-house or any city is easily turned to\r\naccount in almost any other house or city; that is to say, the inertia\r\ndue to special training is slight. Also, this occupation requires more\r\nthan the average of intelligence and general information, and the men\r\nemployed in it are therefore ordinarily more ready than many others to\r\ntake advantage of any slight variation in the demand for their labor\r\nfrom one place to another. The inertia due to the home feeling is\r\nconsequently also slight. At the same time the wages in the trade are\r\nhigh enough to make movement from place to place relatively easy. The\r\nresult is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing; perhaps\r\ngreater than in any other equally well-defined and considerable body of\r\nworkmen. These men are constantly thrown in contact with new groups\r\nof acquaintances, with whom the relations established are transient or\r\nephemeral, but whose good opinion is valued none the less for the time\r\nbeing. The human proclivity to ostentation, reenforced by sentiments of\r\ngood-fellowship, leads them to spend freely in those directions which\r\nwill best serve these needs. Here as elsewhere prescription seizes\r\nupon the custom as soon as it gains a vogue, and incorporates it in the\r\naccredited standard of decency. The next step is to make this standard\r\nof decency the point of departure for a new move in advance in the same\r\ndirection--for there is no merit in simple spiritless conformity to a\r\nstandard of dissipation that is lived up to as a matter of course by\r\neveryone in the trade.\r\n\r\nThe greater prevalence of dissipation among printers than among the\r\naverage of workmen is accordingly attributable, at least in some\r\nmeasure, to the greater ease of movement and the more transient\r\ncharacter of acquaintance and human contact in this trade. But the\r\nsubstantial ground of this high requirement in dissipation is in the\r\nlast analysis no other than that same propensity for a manifestation\r\nof dominance and pecuniary decency which makes the French\r\npeasant-proprietor parsimonious and frugal, and induces the American\r\nmillionaire to found colleges, hospitals and museums. If the canon of\r\nconspicuous consumption were not offset to a considerable extent by\r\nother features of human nature, alien to it, any saving should logically\r\nbe impossible for a population situated as the artisan and laboring\r\nclasses of the cities are at present, however high their wages or their\r\nincome might be.\r\n\r\nBut there are other standards of repute and other, more or less\r\nimperative, canons of conduct, besides wealth and its manifestation, and\r\nsome of these come in to accentuate or to qualify the broad, fundamental\r\ncanon of conspicuous waste. Under the simple test of effectiveness\r\nfor advertising, we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous\r\nconsumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty\r\nevenly between them at the outset. Leisure might then be expected\r\ngradually to yield ground and tend to obsolescence as the economic\r\ndevelopment goes forward, and the community increases in size; while the\r\nconspicuous consumption of goods should gradually gain in importance,\r\nboth absolutely and relatively, until it had absorbed all the available\r\nproduct, leaving nothing over beyond a bare livelihood. But the actual\r\ncourse of development has been somewhat different from this ideal\r\nscheme. Leisure held the first place at the start, and came to hold a\r\nrank very much above wasteful consumption of goods, both as a direct\r\nexponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency, during\r\nthe quasi-peaceable culture. From that point onward, consumption has\r\ngained ground, until, at present, it unquestionably holds the primacy,\r\nthough it is still far from absorbing the entire margin of production\r\nabove the subsistence minimum.\r\n\r\nThe early ascendency of leisure as a means of reputability is traceable\r\nto the archaic distinction between noble and ignoble employments.\r\nLeisure is honorable and becomes imperative partly because it shows\r\nexemption from ignoble labor. The archaic differentiation into noble and\r\nignoble classes is based on an invidious distinction between employments\r\nas honorific or debasing; and this traditional distinction grows into an\r\nimperative canon of decency during the early quasi-peaceable stage.\r\nIts ascendency is furthered by the fact that leisure is still fully as\r\neffective an evidence of wealth as consumption. Indeed, so effective\r\nis it in the relatively small and stable human environment to which the\r\nindividual is exposed at that cultural stage, that, with the aid of the\r\narchaic tradition which deprecates all productive labor, it gives rise\r\nto a large impecunious leisure class, and it even tends to limit the\r\nproduction of the community\'s industry to the subsistence minimum. This\r\nextreme inhibition of industry is avoided because slave labor, working\r\nunder a compulsion more vigorous than that of reputability, is forced to\r\nturn out a product in excess of the subsistence minimum of the working\r\nclass. The subsequent relative decline in the use of conspicuous\r\nleisure as a basis of repute is due partly to an increasing relative\r\neffectiveness of consumption as an evidence of wealth; but in part it is\r\ntraceable to another force, alien, and in some degree antagonistic, to\r\nthe usage of conspicuous waste.\r\n\r\nThis alien factor is the instinct of workmanship. Other circumstances\r\npermitting, that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon\r\nproductive efficiency and on whatever is of human use. It disposes them\r\nto deprecate waste of substance or effort. The instinct of workmanship\r\nis present in all men, and asserts itself even under very adverse\r\ncircumstances. So that however wasteful a given expenditure may be in\r\nreality, it must at least have some colorable excuse in the way of an\r\nostensible purpose. The manner in which, under special circumstances,\r\nthe instinct eventuates in a taste for exploit and an invidious\r\ndiscrimination between noble and ignoble classes has been indicated in\r\nan earlier chapter. In so far as it comes into conflict with the law of\r\nconspicuous waste, the instinct of workmanship expresses itself not so\r\nmuch in insistence on substantial usefulness as in an abiding sense of\r\nthe odiousness and aesthetic impossibility of what is obviously futile.\r\nBeing of the nature of an instinctive affection, its guidance touches\r\nchiefly and immediately the obvious and apparent violations of its\r\nrequirements. It is only less promptly and with less constraining force\r\nthat it reaches such substantial violations of its requirements as are\r\nappreciated only upon reflection.\r\n\r\nSo long as all labor continues to be performed exclusively or usually\r\nby slaves, the baseness of all productive effort is too constantly\r\nand deterrently present in the mind of men to allow the instinct of\r\nworkmanship seriously to take effect in the direction of industrial\r\nusefulness; but when the quasi-peaceable stage (with slavery and status)\r\npasses into the peaceable stage of industry (with wage labor and cash\r\npayment) the instinct comes more effectively into play. It then begins\r\naggressively to shape men\'s views of what is meritorious, and asserts\r\nitself at least as an auxiliary canon of self-complacency. All\r\nextraneous considerations apart, those persons (adult) are but a\r\nvanishing minority today who harbor no inclination to the accomplishment\r\nof some end, or who are not impelled of their own motion to shape some\r\nobject or fact or relation for human use. The propensity may in large\r\nmeasure be overborne by the more immediately constraining incentive to a\r\nreputable leisure and an avoidance of indecorous usefulness, and it\r\nmay therefore work itself out in make-believe only; as for instance\r\nin "social duties," and in quasi-artistic or quasi-scholarly\r\naccomplishments, in the care and decoration of the house, in\r\nsewing-circle activity or dress reform, in proficiency at dress, cards,\r\nyachting, golf, and various sports. But the fact that it may under\r\nstress of circumstances eventuate in inanities no more disproves the\r\npresence of the instinct than the reality of the brooding instinct is\r\ndisproved by inducing a hen to sit on a nestful of china eggs.\r\n\r\nThis latter-day uneasy reaching-out for some form of purposeful activity\r\nthat shall at the same time not be indecorously productive of either\r\nindividual or collective gain marks a difference of attitude between\r\nthe modern leisure class and that of the quasi-peaceable stage. At the\r\nearlier stage, as was said above, the all-dominating institution\r\nof slavery and status acted resistlessly to discountenance exertion\r\ndirected to other than naively predatory ends. It was still possible to\r\nfind some habitual employment for the inclination to action in the way\r\nof forcible aggression or repression directed against hostile groups or\r\nagainst the subject classes within the group; and this served to relieve\r\nthe pressure and draw off the energy of the leisure class without a\r\nresort to actually useful, or even ostensibly useful employments. The\r\npractice of hunting also served the same purpose in some degree. When the\r\ncommunity developed into a peaceful industrial organization, and when\r\nfuller occupation of the land had reduced the opportunities for the hunt\r\nto an inconsiderable residue, the pressure of energy seeking purposeful\r\nemployment was left to find an outlet in some other direction. The\r\nignominy which attaches to useful effort also entered upon a less acute\r\nphase with the disappearance of compulsory labor; and the instinct\r\nof workmanship then came to assert itself with more persistence and\r\nconsistency.\r\n\r\nThe line of least resistance has changed in some measure, and the energy\r\nwhich formerly found a vent in predatory activity, now in part takes the\r\ndirection of some ostensibly useful end. Ostensibly purposeless leisure\r\nhas come to be deprecated, especially among that large portion of the\r\nleisure class whose plebeian origin acts to set them at variance with\r\nthe tradition of the otium cum dignitate. But that canon of reputability\r\nwhich discountenances all employment that is of the nature of productive\r\neffort is still at hand, and will permit nothing beyond the most\r\ntransient vogue to any employment that is substantially useful or\r\nproductive. The consequence is that a change has been wrought in the\r\nconspicuous leisure practiced by the leisure class; not so much in\r\nsubstance as in form. A reconciliation between the two conflicting\r\nrequirements is effected by a resort to make-believe. Many and intricate\r\npolite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are\r\ndeveloped; many organizations are founded, with some specious object of\r\namelioration embodied in their official style and title; there is much\r\ncoming and going, and a deal of talk, to the end that the talkers may\r\nnot have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of\r\ntheir traffic. And along with the make-believe of purposeful employment,\r\nand woven inextricably into its texture, there is commonly, if not\r\ninvariably, a more or less appreciable element of purposeful effort\r\ndirected to some serious end.\r\n\r\nIn the narrower sphere of vicarious leisure a similar change has gone\r\nforward. Instead of simply passing her time in visible idleness, as in\r\nthe best days of the patriarchal regime, the housewife of the advanced\r\npeaceable stage applies herself assiduously to household cares. The\r\nsalient features of this development of domestic service have already\r\nbeen indicated. Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous\r\nexpenditure, whether of goods or of services or human life, runs the\r\nobvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer\'s\r\ngood fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities. In order to\r\nbe reputable it must be wasteful. No merit would accrue from the\r\nconsumption of the bare necessaries of life, except by comparison with\r\nthe abjectly poor who fall short even of the subsistence minimum; and no\r\nstandard of expenditure could result from such a comparison, except the\r\nmost prosaic and unattractive level of decency. A standard of life would\r\nstill be possible which should admit of invidious comparison in other\r\nrespects than that of opulence; as, for instance, a comparison\r\nin various directions in the manifestation of moral, physical,\r\nintellectual, or aesthetic force. Comparison in all these directions is\r\nin vogue today; and the comparison made in these respects is commonly\r\nso inextricably bound up with the pecuniary comparison as to be scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from the latter. This is especially true as regards the\r\ncurrent rating of expressions of intellectual and aesthetic force\r\nor proficiency\' so that we frequently interpret as aesthetic or\r\nintellectual a difference which in substance is pecuniary only.\r\n\r\nThe use of the term "waste" is in one respect an unfortunate one. As\r\nused in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone\r\nof deprecation. It is here used for want of a better term that will\r\nadequately describe the same range of motives and of phenomena, and\r\nit is not to be taken in an odious sense, as implying an illegitimate\r\nexpenditure of human products or of human life. In the view of economic\r\ntheory the expenditure in question is no more and no less legitimate\r\nthan any other expenditure. It is here called "waste" because this\r\nexpenditure does not serve human life or human well-being on the whole,\r\nnot because it is waste or misdirection of effort or expenditure as\r\nviewed from the standpoint of the individual consumer who chooses it. If\r\nhe chooses it, that disposes of the question of its relative utility\r\nto him, as compared with other forms of consumption that would not\r\nbe deprecated on account of their wastefulness. Whatever form of\r\nexpenditure the consumer chooses, or whatever end he seeks in making his\r\nchoice, has utility to him by virtue of his preference. As seen from the\r\npoint of view of the individual consumer, the question of wastefulness\r\ndoes not arise within the scope of economic theory proper. The use of\r\nthe word "waste" as a technical term, therefore, implies no deprecation\r\nof the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of\r\nconspicuous waste.\r\n\r\nBut it is, on other grounds, worth noting that the term "waste" in the\r\nlanguage of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized\r\nas wasteful. This common-sense implication is itself an outcropping of\r\nthe instinct of workmanship. The popular reprobation of waste goes to\r\nsay that in order to be at peace with himself the common man must\r\nbe able to see in any and all human effort and human enjoyment an\r\nenhancement of life and well-being on the whole. In order to meet with\r\nunqualified approval, any economic fact must approve itself under the\r\ntest of impersonal usefulness--usefulness as seen from the point of\r\nview of the generically human. Relative or competitive advantage of\r\none individual in comparison with another does not satisfy the economic\r\nconscience, and therefore competitive expenditure has not the approval\r\nof this conscience.\r\n\r\nIn strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of\r\nconspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of\r\nan invidious pecuniary comparison. But in order to bring any given item\r\nor element in under this head it is not necessary that it should\r\nbe recognized as waste in this sense by the person incurring the\r\nexpenditure. It frequently happens that an element of the standard of\r\nliving which set out with being primarily wasteful, ends with becoming,\r\nin the apprehension of the consumer, a necessary of life; and it may\r\nin this way become as indispensable as any other item of the consumer\'s\r\nhabitual expenditure. As items which sometimes fall under this head,\r\nand are therefore available as illustrations of the manner in which this\r\nprinciple applies, may be cited carpets and tapestries, silver table\r\nservice, waiter\'s services, silk hats, starched linen, many articles\r\nof jewelry and of dress. The indispensability of these things after the\r\nhabit and the convention have been formed, however, has little to say\r\nin the classification of expenditures as waste or not waste in the\r\ntechnical meaning of the word. The test to which all expenditure must\r\nbe brought in an attempt to decide that point is the question whether it\r\nserves directly to enhance human life on the whole-whether it furthers\r\nthe life process taken impersonally. For this is the basis of award of\r\nthe instinct of workmanship, and that instinct is the court of final\r\nappeal in any question of economic truth or adequacy. It is a question\r\nas to the award rendered by a dispassionate common sense. The question\r\nis, therefore, not whether, under the existing circumstances of\r\nindividual habit and social custom, a given expenditure conduces to the\r\nparticular consumer\'s gratification or peace of mind; but whether,\r\naside from acquired tastes and from the canons of usage and conventional\r\ndecency, its result is a net gain in comfort or in the fullness of life.\r\nCustomary expenditure must be classed under the head of waste in so far\r\nas the custom on which it rests is traceable to the habit of making\r\nan invidious pecuniary comparison-in so far as it is conceived that it\r\ncould not have become customary and prescriptive without the backing of\r\nthis principle of pecuniary reputability or relative economic success.\r\nIt is obviously not necessary that a given object of expenditure should\r\nbe exclusively wasteful in order to come in under the category of\r\nconspicuous waste. An article may be useful and wasteful both, and its\r\nutility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most\r\nvarying proportions. Consumable goods, and even productive goods,\r\ngenerally show the two elements in combination, as constituents of\r\ntheir utility; although, in a general way, the element of waste tends\r\nto predominate in articles of consumption, while the contrary is true of\r\narticles designed for productive use. Even in articles which appear at\r\nfirst glance to serve for pure ostentation only, it is always possible\r\nto detect the presence of some, at least ostensible, useful purpose;\r\nand on the other hand, even in special machinery and tools contrived for\r\nsome particular industrial process, as well as in the rudest appliances\r\nof human industry, the traces of conspicuous waste, or at least of the\r\nhabit of ostentation, usually become evident on a close scrutiny. It\r\nwould be hazardous to assert that a useful purpose is ever absent from\r\nthe utility of any article or of any service, however obviously its\r\nprime purpose and chief element is conspicuous waste; and it would be\r\nonly less hazardous to assert of any primarily useful product that the\r\nelement of waste is in no way concerned in its value, immediately or\r\nremotely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Five ~~ The Pecuniary Standard of Living\r\n\r\nFor the great body of the people in any modern community, the proximate\r\nground of expenditure in excess of what is required for physical comfort\r\nis not a conscious effort to excel in the expensiveness of their visible\r\nconsumption, so much as it is a desire to live up to the conventional\r\nstandard of decency in the amount and grade of goods consumed. This\r\ndesire is not guided by a rigidly invariable standard, which must be\r\nlived up to, and beyond which there is no incentive to go. The standard\r\nis flexible; and especially it is indefinitely extensible, if only time\r\nis allowed for habituation to any increase in pecuniary ability and\r\nfor acquiring facility in the new and larger scale of expenditure that\r\nfollows such an increase. It is much more difficult to recede from a\r\nscale of expenditure once adopted than it is to extend the accustomed\r\nscale in response to an accession of wealth. Many items of customary\r\nexpenditure prove on analysis to be almost purely wasteful, and they\r\nare therefore honorific only, but after they have once been incorporated\r\ninto the scale of decent consumption, and so have become an integral\r\npart of one\'s scheme of life, it is quite as hard to give up these as\r\nit is to give up many items that conduce directly to one\'s physical\r\ncomfort, or even that may be necessary to life and health. That is\r\nto say, the conspicuously wasteful honorific expenditure that confers\r\nspiritual well-being may become more indispensable than much of that\r\nexpenditure which ministers to the "lower" wants of physical well-being\r\nor sustenance only. It is notoriously just as difficult to recede from a\r\n"high" standard of living as it is to lower a standard which is already\r\nrelatively low; although in the former case the difficulty is a moral\r\none, while in the latter it may involve a material deduction from the\r\nphysical comforts of life.\r\n\r\nBut while retrogression is difficult, a fresh advance in conspicuous\r\nexpenditure is relatively easy; indeed, it takes place almost as a\r\nmatter of course. In the rare cases where it occurs, a failure to\r\nincrease one\'s visible consumption when the means for an increase are\r\nat hand is felt in popular apprehension to call for explanation, and\r\nunworthy motives of miserliness are imputed to those who fall short in\r\nthis respect. A prompt response to the stimulus, on the other hand,\r\nis accepted as the normal effect. This suggests that the standard\r\nof expenditure which commonly guides our efforts is not the average,\r\nordinary expenditure already achieved; it is an ideal of consumption\r\nthat lies just beyond our reach, or to reach which requires some strain.\r\nThe motive is emulation--the stimulus of an invidious comparison which\r\nprompts us to outdo those with whom we are in the habit of classing\r\nourselves. Substantially the same proposition is expressed in the\r\ncommonplace remark that each class envies and emulates the class next\r\nabove it in the social scale, while it rarely compares itself with those\r\nbelow or with those who are considerably in advance. That is to say, in\r\nother words, our standard of decency in expenditure, as in other ends of\r\nemulation, is set by the usage of those next above us in reputability;\r\nuntil, in this way, especially in any community where class distinctions\r\nare somewhat vague, all canons of reputability and decency, and all\r\nstandards of consumption, are traced back by insensible gradations to\r\nthe usages and habits of thought of the highest social and pecuniary\r\nclass--the wealthy leisure class.\r\n\r\nIt is for this class to determine, in general outline, what scheme of\r\nLife the community shall accept as decent or honorific; and it is\r\ntheir office by precept and example to set forth this scheme of social\r\nsalvation in its highest, ideal form. But the higher leisure class\r\ncan exercise this quasi-sacerdotal office only under certain material\r\nlimitations. The class cannot at discretion effect a sudden revolution\r\nor reversal of the popular habits of thought with respect to any of\r\nthese ceremonial requirements. It takes time for any change to permeate\r\nthe mass and change the habitual attitude of the people; and especially\r\nit takes time to change the habits of those classes that are socially\r\nmore remote from the radiant body. The process is slower where the\r\nmobility of the population is less or where the intervals between the\r\nseveral classes are wider and more abrupt. But if time be allowed, the\r\nscope of the discretion of the leisure class as regards questions of\r\nform and detail in the community\'s scheme of life is large; while as\r\nregards the substantial principles of reputability, the changes which\r\nit can effect lie within a narrow margin of tolerance. Its example and\r\nprecept carries the force of prescription for all classes below it; but\r\nin working out the precepts which are handed down as governing the form\r\nand method of reputability--in shaping the usages and the spiritual\r\nattitude of the lower classes--this authoritative prescription\r\nconstantly works under the selective guidance of the canon of\r\nconspicuous waste, tempered in varying degree by the instinct of\r\nworkmanship. To those norms is to be added another broad principle of\r\nhuman nature--the predatory animus--which in point of generality and of\r\npsychological content lies between the two just named. The effect of the\r\nlatter in shaping the accepted scheme of life is yet to be discussed.\r\nThe canon of reputability, then, must adapt itself to the economic\r\ncircumstances, the traditions, and the degree of spiritual maturity\r\nof the particular class whose scheme of life it is to regulate. It is\r\nespecially to be noted that however high its authority and however true\r\nto the fundamental requirements of reputability it may have been at\r\nits inception, a specific formal observance can under no circumstances\r\nmaintain itself in force if with the lapse of time or on its\r\ntransmission to a lower pecuniary class it is found to run counter\r\nto the ultimate ground of decency among civilized peoples, namely,\r\nserviceability for the purpose of an invidious comparison in pecuniary\r\nsuccess. It is evident that these canons of expenditure have much to\r\nsay in determining the standard of living for any community and for any\r\nclass. It is no less evident that the standard of living which prevails\r\nat any time or at any given social altitude will in its turn have much\r\nto say as to the forms which honorific expenditure will take, and as\r\nto the degree to which this "higher" need will dominate a people\'s\r\nconsumption. In this respect the control exerted by the accepted\r\nstandard of living is chiefly of a negative character; it acts almost\r\nsolely to prevent recession from a scale of conspicuous expenditure that\r\nhas once become habitual.\r\n\r\nA standard of living is of the nature of habit. It is an habitual scale\r\nand method of responding to given stimuli. The difficulty in the way\r\nof receding from an accustomed standard is the difficulty of breaking\r\na habit that has once been formed. The relative facility with which an\r\nadvance in the standard is made means that the life process is a process\r\nof unfolding activity and that it will readily unfold in a new direction\r\nwhenever and wherever the resistance to self-expression decreases. But\r\nwhen the habit of expression along such a given line of low resistance\r\nhas once been formed, the discharge will seek the accustomed outlet even\r\nafter a change has taken place in the environment whereby the external\r\nresistance has appreciably risen. That heightened facility of expression\r\nin a given direction which is called habit may offset a considerable\r\nincrease in the resistance offered by external circumstances to the\r\nunfolding of life in the given direction. As between the various habits,\r\nor habitual modes and directions of expression, which go to make up an\r\nindividual\'s standard of living, there is an appreciable difference in\r\npoint of persistence under counteracting circumstances and in point\r\nof the degree of imperativeness with which the discharge seeks a given\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, in the language of current economic theory, while men\r\nare reluctant to retrench their expenditures in any direction, they are\r\nmore reluctant to retrench in some directions than in others; so that\r\nwhile any accustomed consumption is reluctantly given up, there are\r\ncertain lines of consumption which are given up with relatively extreme\r\nreluctance. The articles or forms of consumption to which the consumer\r\nclings with the greatest tenacity are commonly the so-called necessaries\r\nof life, or the subsistence minimum. The subsistence minimum is of\r\ncourse not a rigidly determined allowance of goods, definite and\r\ninvariable in kind and quantity; but for the purpose in hand it may\r\nbe taken to comprise a certain, more or less definite, aggregate of\r\nconsumption required for the maintenance of life. This minimum, it\r\nmay be assumed, is ordinarily given up last in case of a progressive\r\nretrenchment of expenditure. That is to say, in a general way, the\r\nmost ancient and ingrained of the habits which govern the individual\'s\r\nlife--those habits that touch his existence as an organism--are the\r\nmost persistent and imperative. Beyond these come the higher\r\nwants--later-formed habits of the individual or the race--in a somewhat\r\nirregular and by no means invariable gradation. Some of these higher\r\nwants, as for instance the habitual use of certain stimulants, or the\r\nneed of salvation (in the eschatological sense), or of good repute, may\r\nin some cases take precedence of the lower or more elementary wants. In\r\ngeneral, the longer the habituation, the more unbroken the habit, and\r\nthe more nearly it coincides with previous habitual forms of the life\r\nprocess, the more persistently will the given habit assert itself. The\r\nhabit will be stronger if the particular traits of human nature which\r\nits action involves, or the particular aptitudes that find exercise\r\nin it, are traits or aptitudes that are already largely and profoundly\r\nconcerned in the life process or that are intimately bound up with the\r\nlife history of the particular racial stock. The varying degrees of ease\r\nwith which different habits are formed by different persons, as well as\r\nthe varying degrees of reluctance with which different habits are given\r\nup, goes to say that the formation of specific habits is not a matter\r\nof length of habituation simply. Inherited aptitudes and traits of\r\ntemperament count for quite as much as length of habituation in deciding\r\nwhat range of habits will come to dominate any individual\'s scheme of\r\nlife. And the prevalent type of transmitted aptitudes, or in other words\r\nthe type of temperament belonging to the dominant ethnic element in\r\nany community, will go far to decide what will be the scope and form\r\nof expression of the community\'s habitual life process. How greatly the\r\ntransmitted idiosyncrasies of aptitude may count in the way of a rapid\r\nand definitive formation of habit in individuals is illustrated by the\r\nextreme facility with which an all-dominating habit of alcoholism\r\nis sometimes formed; or in the similar facility and the similarly\r\ninevitable formation of a habit of devout observances in the case of\r\npersons gifted with a special aptitude in that direction. Much the same\r\nmeaning attaches to that peculiar facility of habituation to a specific\r\nhuman environment that is called romantic love.\r\n\r\nMen differ in respect of transmitted aptitudes, or in respect of\r\nthe relative facility with which they unfold their life activity in\r\nparticular directions; and the habits which coincide with or proceed\r\nupon a relatively strong specific aptitude or a relatively great\r\nspecific facility of expression become of great consequence to the man\'s\r\nwell-being. The part played by this element of aptitude in determining\r\nthe relative tenacity of the several habits which constitute the\r\nstandard of living goes to explain the extreme reluctance with which men\r\ngive up any habitual expenditure in the way of conspicuous consumption.\r\nThe aptitudes or propensities to which a habit of this kind is to be\r\nreferred as its ground are those aptitudes whose exercise is comprised\r\nin emulation; and the propensity for emulation--for invidious\r\ncomparison--is of ancient growth and is a pervading trait of human\r\nnature. It is easily called into vigorous activity in any new form, and\r\nit asserts itself with great insistence under any form under which it\r\nhas once found habitual expression. When the individual has once\r\nformed the habit of seeking expression in a given line of honorific\r\nexpenditure--when a given set of stimuli have come to be habitually\r\nresponded to in activity of a given kind and direction under the\r\nguidance of these alert and deep-reaching propensities of emulation--it\r\nis with extreme reluctance that such an habitual expenditure is given\r\nup. And on the other hand, whenever an accession of pecuniary strength\r\nputs the individual in a position to unfold his life process in larger\r\nscope and with additional reach, the ancient propensities of the race\r\nwill assert themselves in determining the direction which the new\r\nunfolding of life is to take. And those propensities which are already\r\nactively in the field under some related form of expression, which are\r\naided by the pointed suggestions afforded by a current accredited\r\nscheme of life, and for the exercise of which the material means and\r\nopportunities are readily available--these will especially have much to\r\nsay in shaping the form and direction in which the new accession to\r\nthe individual\'s aggregate force will assert itself. That is to say,\r\nin concrete terms, in any community where conspicuous consumption is an\r\nelement of the scheme of life, an increase in an individual\'s ability\r\nto pay is likely to take the form of an expenditure for some accredited\r\nline of conspicuous consumption.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the instinct of self-preservation, the propensity\r\nfor emulation is probably the strongest and most alert and persistent of\r\nthe economic motives proper. In an industrial community this propensity\r\nfor emulation expresses itself in pecuniary emulation; and this, so\r\nfar as regards the Western civilized communities of the present, is\r\nvirtually equivalent to saying that it expresses itself in some form\r\nof conspicuous waste. The need of conspicuous waste, therefore, stands\r\nready to absorb any increase in the community\'s industrial efficiency\r\nor output of goods, after the most elementary physical wants have\r\nbeen provided for. Where this result does not follow, under modern\r\nconditions, the reason for the discrepancy is commonly to be sought in\r\na rate of increase in the individual\'s wealth too rapid for the habit of\r\nexpenditure to keep abreast of it; or it may be that the individual in\r\nquestion defers the conspicuous consumption of the increment to a later\r\ndate--ordinarily with a view to heightening the spectacular effect\r\nof the aggregate expenditure contemplated. As increased industrial\r\nefficiency makes it possible to procure the means of livelihood with\r\nless labor, the energies of the industrious members of the community are\r\nbent to the compassing of a higher result in conspicuous expenditure,\r\nrather than slackened to a more comfortable pace. The strain is not\r\nlightened as industrial efficiency increases and makes a lighter strain\r\npossible, but the increment of output is turned to use to meet this\r\nwant, which is indefinitely expansible, after the manner commonly\r\nimputed in economic theory to higher or spiritual wants. It is owing\r\nchiefly to the presence of this element in the standard of living that\r\nJ. S. Mill was able to say that "hitherto it is questionable if all\r\nthe mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day\'s toil of any\r\nhuman being." The accepted standard of expenditure in the community\r\nor in the class to which a person belongs largely determines what his\r\nstandard of living will be. It does this directly by commending\r\nitself to his common sense as right and good, through his habitually\r\ncontemplating it and assimilating the scheme of life in which it\r\nbelongs; but it does so also indirectly through popular insistence\r\non conformity to the accepted scale of expenditure as a matter of\r\npropriety, under pain of disesteem and ostracism. To accept and\r\npractice the standard of living which is in vogue is both agreeable\r\nand expedient, commonly to the point of being indispensable to personal\r\ncomfort and to success in life. The standard of living of any class, so\r\nfar as concerns the element of conspicuous waste, is commonly as high as\r\nthe earning capacity of the class will permit--with a constant tendency\r\nto go higher. The effect upon the serious activities of men is therefore\r\nto direct them with great singleness of purpose to the largest possible\r\nacquisition of wealth, and to discountenance work that brings no\r\npecuniary gain. At the same time the effect on consumption is to\r\nconcentrate it upon the lines which are most patent to the observers\r\nwhose good opinion is sought; while the inclinations and aptitudes whose\r\nexercise does not involve a honorific expenditure of time or substance\r\ntend to fall into abeyance through disuse.\r\n\r\nThrough this discrimination in favor of visible consumption it has come\r\nabout that the domestic life of most classes is relatively shabby, as\r\ncompared with the \xe9clat of that overt portion of their life that is\r\ncarried on before the eyes of observers. As a secondary consequence of\r\nthe same discrimination, people habitually screen their private life\r\nfrom observation. So far as concerns that portion of their consumption\r\nthat may without blame be carried on in secret, they withdraw from all\r\ncontact with their neighbors, hence the exclusiveness of people, as\r\nregards their domestic life, in most of the industrially developed\r\ncommunities; and hence, by remoter derivation, the habit of privacy and\r\nreserve that is so large a feature in the code of proprieties of the\r\nbetter class in all communities. The low birthrate of the classes upon\r\nwhom the requirements of reputable expenditure fall with great urgency\r\nis likewise traceable to the exigencies of a standard of living based\r\non conspicuous waste. The conspicuous consumption, and the consequent\r\nincreased expense, required in the reputable maintenance of a child is\r\nvery considerable and acts as a powerful deterrent. It is probably the\r\nmost effectual of the Malthusian prudential checks.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this factor of the standard of living, both in the way of\r\nretrenchment in the obscurer elements of consumption that go to physical\r\ncomfort and maintenance, and also in the paucity or absence of children,\r\nis perhaps seen at its best among the classes given to scholarly\r\npursuits. Because of a presumed superiority and scarcity of the gifts\r\nand attainments that characterize their life, these classes are by\r\nconvention subsumed under a higher social grade than their pecuniary\r\ngrade should warrant. The scale of decent expenditure in their case\r\nis pitched correspondingly high, and it consequently leaves an\r\nexceptionally narrow margin disposable for the other ends of life. By\r\nforce of circumstances, their habitual sense of what is good and right\r\nin these matters, as well as the expectations of the community in the\r\nway of pecuniary decency among the learned, are excessively high--as\r\nmeasured by the prevalent degree of opulence and earning capacity of the\r\nclass, relatively to the non-scholarly classes whose social equals\r\nthey nominally are. In any modern community where there is no priestly\r\nmonopoly of these occupations, the people of scholarly pursuits are\r\nunavoidably thrown into contact with classes that are pecuniarily their\r\nsuperiors. The high standard of pecuniary decency in force among these\r\nsuperior classes is transfused among the scholarly classes with but\r\nlittle mitigation of its rigor; and as a consequence there is no class\r\nof the community that spends a larger proportion of its substance in\r\nconspicuous waste than these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Six ~~ Pecuniary Canons of Taste\r\n\r\nThe caution has already been repeated more than once, that while the\r\nregulating norm of consumption is in large part the requirement of\r\nconspicuous waste, it must not be understood that the motive on which\r\nthe consumer acts in any given case is this principle in its bald,\r\nunsophisticated form. Ordinarily his motive is a wish to conform to\r\nestablished usage, to avoid unfavorable notice and comment, to live\r\nup to the accepted canons of decency in the kind, amount, and grade of\r\ngoods consumed, as well as in the decorous employment of his time and\r\neffort. In the common run of cases this sense of prescriptive usage is\r\npresent in the motives of the consumer and exerts a direct constraining\r\nforce, especially as regards consumption carried on under the eyes of\r\nobservers. But a considerable element of prescriptive expensiveness is\r\nobservable also in consumption that does not in any appreciable degree\r\nbecome known to outsiders--as, for instance, articles of underclothing,\r\nsome articles of food, kitchen utensils, and other household apparatus\r\ndesigned for service rather than for evidence. In all such useful\r\narticles a close scrutiny will discover certain features which add to\r\nthe cost and enhance the commercial value of the goods in question, but\r\ndo not proportionately increase the serviceability of these articles for\r\nthe material purposes which alone they ostensibly are designed to serve.\r\n\r\nUnder the selective surveillance of the law of conspicuous waste there\r\ngrows up a code of accredited canons of consumption, the effect of\r\nwhich is to hold the consumer up to a standard of expensiveness and\r\nwastefulness in his consumption of goods and in his employment of time\r\nand effort. This growth of prescriptive usage has an immediate effect\r\nupon economic life, but it has also an indirect and remoter effect upon\r\nconduct in other respects as well. Habits of thought with respect to\r\nthe expression of life in any given direction unavoidably affect the\r\nhabitual view of what is good and right in life in other directions\r\nalso. In the organic complex of habits of thought which make up the\r\nsubstance of an individual\'s conscious life the economic interest does\r\nnot lie isolated and distinct from all other interests. Something,\r\nfor instance, has already been said of its relation to the canons of\r\nreputability.\r\n\r\nThe principle of conspicuous waste guides the formation of habits of\r\nthought as to what is honest and reputable in life and in commodities.\r\nIn so doing, this principle will traverse other norms of conduct which\r\ndo not primarily have to do with the code of pecuniary honor, but\r\nwhich have, directly or incidentally, an economic significance of some\r\nmagnitude. So the canon of honorific waste may, immediately or remotely,\r\ninfluence the sense of duty, the sense of beauty, the sense of utility,\r\nthe sense of devotional or ritualistic fitness, and the scientific sense\r\nof truth.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to go into a discussion here of the particular\r\npoints at which, or the particular manner in which, the canon of\r\nhonorific expenditure habitually traverses the canons of moral conduct.\r\nThe matter is one which has received large attention and illustration at\r\nthe hands of those whose office it is to watch and admonish with\r\nrespect to any departures from the accepted code of morals. In modern\r\ncommunities, where the dominant economic and legal feature of the\r\ncommunity\'s life is the institution of private property, one of the\r\nsalient features of the code of morals is the sacredness of property.\r\nThere needs no insistence or illustration to gain assent to the\r\nproposition that the habit of holding private property inviolate is\r\ntraversed by the other habit of seeking wealth for the sake of the good\r\nrepute to be gained through its conspicuous consumption. Most offenses\r\nagainst property, especially offenses of an appreciable magnitude, come\r\nunder this head. It is also a matter of common notoriety and byword\r\nthat in offenses which result in a large accession of property to the\r\noffender he does not ordinarily incur the extreme penalty or the extreme\r\nobloquy with which his offenses would be visited on the ground of the\r\nnaive moral code alone. The thief or swindler who has gained great\r\nwealth by his delinquency has a better chance than the small thief of\r\nescaping the rigorous penalty of the law and some good repute accrues\r\nto him from his increased wealth and from his spending the irregularly\r\nacquired possessions in a seemly manner. A well-bred expenditure of his\r\nbooty especially appeals with great effect to persons of a cultivated\r\nsense of the proprieties, and goes far to mitigate the sense of moral\r\nturpitude with which his dereliction is viewed by them. It may be noted\r\nalso--and it is more immediately to the point--that we are all inclined\r\nto condone an offense against property in the case of a man whose motive\r\nis the worthy one of providing the means of a "decent" manner of\r\nlife for his wife and children. If it is added that the wife has been\r\n"nurtured in the lap of luxury," that is accepted as an additional\r\nextenuating circumstance. That is to say, we are prone to condone such\r\nan offense where its aim is the honorific one of enabling the offender\'s\r\nwife to perform for him such an amount of vicarious consumption of time\r\nand substance as is demanded by the standard of pecuniary decency. In\r\nsuch a case the habit of approving the accustomed degree of conspicuous\r\nwaste traverses the habit of deprecating violations of ownership, to the\r\nextent even of sometimes leaving the award of praise or blame uncertain.\r\nThis is peculiarly true where the dereliction involves an appreciable\r\npredatory or piratical element.\r\n\r\nThis topic need scarcely be pursued further here; but the remark may not\r\nbe out of place that all that considerable body of morals that clusters\r\nabout the concept of an inviolable ownership is itself a psychological\r\nprecipitate of the traditional meritoriousness of wealth. And it should\r\nbe added that this wealth which is held sacred is valued primarily\r\nfor the sake of the good repute to be got through its conspicuous\r\nconsumption. The bearing of pecuniary decency upon the scientific spirit\r\nor the quest of knowledge will be taken up in some detail in a separate\r\nchapter. Also as regards the sense of devout or ritual merit and\r\nadequacy in this connection, little need be said in this place. That\r\ntopic will also come up incidentally in a later chapter. Still, this\r\nusage of honorific expenditure has much to say in shaping popular tastes\r\nas to what is right and meritorious in sacred matters, and the bearing\r\nof the principle of conspicuous waste upon some of the commonplace\r\ndevout observances and conceits may therefore be pointed out.\r\n\r\nObviously, the canon of conspicuous waste is accountable for a great\r\nportion of what may be called devout consumption; as, e.g., the\r\nconsumption of sacred edifices, vestments, and other goods of the same\r\nclass. Even in those modern cults to whose divinities is imputed a\r\npredilection for temples not built with hands, the sacred buildings and\r\nthe other properties of the cult are constructed and decorated with some\r\nview to a reputable degree of wasteful expenditure. And it needs but\r\nlittle either of observation or introspection--and either will serve the\r\nturn--to assure us that the expensive splendor of the house of worship\r\nhas an appreciable uplifting and mellowing effect upon the worshipper\'s\r\nframe of mind. It will serve to enforce the same fact if we reflect upon\r\nthe sense of abject shamefulness with which any evidence of indigence or\r\nsqualor about the sacred place affects all beholders. The accessories\r\nof any devout observance should be pecuniarily above reproach. This\r\nrequirement is imperative, whatever latitude may be allowed with regard\r\nto these accessories in point of aesthetic or other serviceability. It\r\nmay also be in place to notice that in all communities, especially in\r\nneighborhoods where the standard of pecuniary decency for dwellings\r\nis not high, the local sanctuary is more ornate, more conspicuously\r\nwasteful in its architecture and decoration, than the dwelling houses\r\nof the congregation. This is true of nearly all denominations and cults,\r\nwhether Christian or Pagan, but it is true in a peculiar degree of\r\nthe older and maturer cults. At the same time the sanctuary commonly\r\ncontributes little if anything to the physical comfort of the members.\r\nIndeed, the sacred structure not only serves the physical well-being\r\nof the members to but a slight extent, as compared with their humbler\r\ndwelling-houses; but it is felt by all men that a right and enlightened\r\nsense of the true, the beautiful, and the good demands that in all\r\nexpenditure on the sanctuary anything that might serve the comfort of\r\nthe worshipper should be conspicuously absent. If any element of comfort\r\nis admitted in the fittings of the sanctuary, it should be at least\r\nscrupulously screened and masked under an ostensible austerity. In the\r\nmost reputable latter-day houses of worship, where no expense is spared,\r\nthe principle of austerity is carried to the length of making the\r\nfittings of the place a means of mortifying the flesh, especially in\r\nappearance. There are few persons of delicate tastes, in the matter of\r\ndevout consumption to whom this austerely wasteful discomfort does not\r\nappeal as intrinsically right and good. Devout consumption is of the\r\nnature of vicarious consumption. This canon of devout austerity is based\r\non the pecuniary reputability of conspicuously wasteful consumption,\r\nbacked by the principle that vicarious consumption should conspicuously\r\nnot conduce to the comfort of the vicarious consumer.\r\n\r\nThe sanctuary and its fittings have something of this austerity in all\r\nthe cults in which the saint or divinity to whom the sanctuary pertains\r\nis not conceived to be present and make personal use of the property for\r\nthe gratification of luxurious tastes imputed to him. The character of\r\nthe sacred paraphernalia is somewhat different in this respect in those\r\ncults where the habits of life imputed to the divinity more nearly\r\napproach those of an earthly patriarchal potentate--where he is\r\nconceived to make use of these consumable goods in person. In the latter\r\ncase the sanctuary and its fittings take on more of the fashion given to\r\ngoods destined for the conspicuous consumption of a temporal master or\r\nowner. On the other hand, where the sacred apparatus is simply employed\r\nin the divinity\'s service, that is to say, where it is consumed\r\nvicariously on his account by his servants, there the sacred properties\r\ntake the character suited to goods that are destined for vicarious\r\nconsumption only.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case the sanctuary and the sacred apparatus are so\r\ncontrived as not to enhance the comfort or fullness of life of the\r\nvicarious consumer, or at any rate not to convey the impression that\r\nthe end of their consumption is the consumer\'s comfort. For the end of\r\nvicarious consumption is to enhance, not the fullness of life of the\r\nconsumer, but the pecuniary repute of the master for whose behoof the\r\nconsumption takes place. Therefore priestly vestments are notoriously\r\nexpensive, ornate, and inconvenient; and in the cults where the priestly\r\nservitor of the divinity is not conceived to serve him in the capacity\r\nof consort, they are of an austere, comfortless fashion. And such it is\r\nfelt that they should be.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in establishing a devout standard of decent expensiveness\r\nthat the principle of waste invades the domain of the canons of ritual\r\nserviceability. It touches the ways as well as the means, and draws on\r\nvicarious leisure as well as on vicarious consumption. Priestly demeanor\r\nat its best is aloof, leisurely, perfunctory, and uncontaminated with\r\nsuggestions of sensuous pleasure. This holds true, in different degrees\r\nof course, for the different cults and denominations; but in the\r\npriestly life of all anthropomorphic cults the marks of a vicarious\r\nconsumption of time are visible.\r\n\r\nThe same pervading canon of vicarious leisure is also visibly present in\r\nthe exterior details of devout observances and need only be pointed out\r\nin order to become obvious to all beholders. All ritual has a notable\r\ntendency to reduce itself to a rehearsal of formulas. This development\r\nof formula is most noticeable in the maturer cults, which have at the\r\nsame time a more austere, ornate, and severe priestly life and garb; but\r\nit is perceptible also in the forms and methods of worship of the newer\r\nand fresher sects, whose tastes in respect of priests, vestments, and\r\nsanctuaries are less exacting. The rehearsal of the service (the term\r\n"service" carries a suggestion significant for the point in question)\r\ngrows more perfunctory as the cult gains in age and consistency, and\r\nthis perfunctoriness of the rehearsal is very pleasing to the correct\r\ndevout taste. And with a good reason, for the fact of its being\r\nperfunctory goes to say pointedly that the master for whom it is\r\nperformed is exalted above the vulgar need of actually proficuous\r\nservice on the part of his servants. They are unprofitable servants, and\r\nthere is an honorific implication for their master in their remaining\r\nunprofitable. It is needless to point out the close analogy at this\r\npoint between the priestly office and the office of the footman. It is\r\npleasing to our sense of what is fitting in these matters, in either\r\ncase, to recognize in the obvious perfunctoriness of the service that it\r\nis a pro forma execution only. There should be no show of agility or of\r\ndexterous manipulation in the execution of the priestly office, such as\r\nmight suggest a capacity for turning off the work.\r\n\r\nIn all this there is of course an obvious implication as to the\r\ntemperament, tastes, propensities, and habits of life imputed to the\r\ndivinity by worshippers who live under the tradition of these pecuniary\r\ncanons of reputability. Through its pervading men\'s habits of thought,\r\nthe principle of conspicuous waste has colored the worshippers\' notions\r\nof the divinity and of the relation in which the human subject stands\r\nto him. It is of course in the more naive cults that this suffusion\r\nof pecuniary beauty is most patent, but it is visible throughout. All\r\npeoples, at whatever stage of culture or degree of enlightenment, are\r\nfain to eke out a sensibly scant degree of authentic formation regarding\r\nthe personality and habitual surroundings of their divinities. In so\r\ncalling in the aid of fancy to enrich and fill in their picture of the\r\ndivinity\'s presence and manner of life they habitually impute to him\r\nsuch traits as go to make up their ideal of a worthy man. And in\r\nseeking communion with the divinity the ways and means of approach are\r\nassimilated as nearly as may be to the divine ideal that is in men\'s\r\nminds at the time. It is felt that the divine presence is entered with\r\nthe best grace, and with the best effect, according to certain accepted\r\nmethods and with the accompaniment of certain material circumstances\r\nwhich in popular apprehension are peculiarly consonant with the divine\r\nnature. This popularly accepted ideal of the bearing and paraphernalia\r\nadequate to such occasions of communion is, of course, to a good extent\r\nshaped by the popular apprehension of what is intrinsically worthy\r\nand beautiful in human carriage and surroundings on all occasions of\r\ndignified intercourse. It would on this account be misleading to\r\nattempt an analysis of devout demeanor by referring all evidences of\r\nthe presence of a pecuniary standard of reputability back directly and\r\nbaldly to the underlying norm of pecuniary emulation. So it would also\r\nbe misleading to ascribe to the divinity, as popularly conceived, a\r\njealous regard for his pecuniary standing and a habit of avoiding and\r\ncondemning squalid situations and surroundings simply because they are\r\nunder grade in the pecuniary respect.\r\n\r\nAnd still, after all allowance has been made, it appears that the canons\r\nof pecuniary reputability do, directly or indirectly, materially affect\r\nour notions of the attributes of divinity, as well as our notions\r\nof what are the fit and adequate manner and circumstances of divine\r\ncommunion. It is felt that the divinity must be of a peculiarly serene\r\nand leisurely habit of life. And whenever his local habitation is\r\npictured in poetic imagery, for edification or in appeal to the devout\r\nfancy, the devout word-painter, as a matter of course, brings out before\r\nhis auditors\' imagination a throne with a profusion of the insignia of\r\nopulence and power, and surrounded by a great number of servitors. In\r\nthe common run of such presentations of the celestial abodes, the office\r\nof this corps of servants is a vicarious leisure, their time and efforts\r\nbeing in great measure taken up with an industrially unproductive\r\nrehearsal of the meritorious characteristics and exploits of the\r\ndivinity; while the background of the presentation is filled with the\r\nshimmer of the precious metals and of the more expensive varieties of\r\nprecious stones. It is only in the crasser expressions of devout fancy\r\nthat this intrusion of pecuniary canons into the devout ideals reaches\r\nsuch an extreme. An extreme case occurs in the devout imagery of the\r\nNegro population of the South. Their word-painters are unable to descend\r\nto anything cheaper than gold; so that in this case the insistence on\r\npecuniary beauty gives a startling effect in yellow--such as would be\r\nunbearable to a soberer taste. Still, there is probably no cult in which\r\nideals of pecuniary merit have not been called in to supplement the\r\nideals of ceremonial adequacy that guide men\'s conception of what is\r\nright in the matter of sacred apparatus.\r\n\r\nSimilarly it is felt--and the sentiment is acted upon--that the priestly\r\nservitors of the divinity should not engage in industrially productive\r\nwork; that work of any kind--any employment which is of tangible human\r\nuse--must not be carried on in the divine presence, or within the\r\nprecincts of the sanctuary; that whoever comes into the presence should\r\ncome cleansed of all profane industrial features in his apparel\r\nor person, and should come clad in garments of more than everyday\r\nexpensiveness; that on holidays set apart in honor of or for communion\r\nwith the divinity no work that is of human use should be performed by\r\nany one. Even the remoter, lay dependents should render a vicarious\r\nleisure to the extent of one day in seven. In all these deliverances of\r\nmen\'s uninstructed sense of what is fit and proper in devout observance\r\nand in the relations of the divinity, the effectual presence of the\r\ncanons of pecuniary reputability is obvious enough, whether these canons\r\nhave had their effect on the devout judgment in this respect immediately\r\nor at the second remove.\r\n\r\nThese canons of reputability have had a similar, but more far-reaching\r\nand more specifically determinable, effect upon the popular sense\r\nof beauty or serviceability in consumable goods. The requirements of\r\npecuniary decency have, to a very appreciable extent, influenced the\r\nsense of beauty and of utility in articles of use or beauty.\r\nArticles are to an extent preferred for use on account of their being\r\nconspicuously wasteful; they are felt to be serviceable somewhat in\r\nproportion as they are wasteful and ill adapted to their ostensible use.\r\n\r\nThe utility of articles valued for their beauty depends closely upon the\r\nexpensiveness of the articles. A homely illustration will bring out this\r\ndependence. A hand-wrought silver spoon, of a commercial value of some\r\nten to twenty dollars, is not ordinarily more serviceable--in the first\r\nsense of the word--than a machine-made spoon of the same material.\r\nIt may not even be more serviceable than a machine-made spoon of some\r\n"base" metal, such as aluminum, the value of which may be no more than\r\nsome ten to twenty cents. The former of the two utensils is, in fact,\r\ncommonly a less effective contrivance for its ostensible purpose than\r\nthe latter. The objection is of course ready to hand that, in taking\r\nthis view of the matter, one of the chief uses, if not the chief use,\r\nof the costlier spoon is ignored; the hand-wrought spoon gratifies our\r\ntaste, our sense of the beautiful, while that made by machinery out of\r\nthe base metal has no useful office beyond a brute efficiency. The facts\r\nare no doubt as the objection states them, but it will be evident\r\non rejection that the objection is after all more plausible than\r\nconclusive. It appears (1) that while the different materials of which\r\nthe two spoons are made each possesses beauty and serviceability for the\r\npurpose for which it is used, the material of the hand-wrought spoon is\r\nsome one hundred times more valuable than the baser metal, without very\r\ngreatly excelling the latter in intrinsic beauty of grain or color, and\r\nwithout being in any appreciable degree superior in point of mechanical\r\nserviceability; (2) if a close inspection should show that the supposed\r\nhand-wrought spoon were in reality only a very clever citation of\r\nhand-wrought goods, but an imitation so cleverly wrought as to give the\r\nsame impression of line and surface to any but a minute examination by\r\na trained eye, the utility of the article, including the gratification\r\nwhich the user derives from its contemplation as an object of beauty,\r\nwould immediately decline by some eighty or ninety per cent, or even\r\nmore; (3) if the two spoons are, to a fairly close observer, so nearly\r\nidentical in appearance that the lighter weight of the spurious article\r\nalone betrays it, this identity of form and color will scarcely add\r\nto the value of the machine-made spoon, nor appreciably enhance the\r\ngratification of the user\'s "sense of beauty" in contemplating it, so\r\nlong as the cheaper spoon is not a novelty, ad so long as it can be\r\nprocured at a nominal cost. The case of the spoons is typical. The\r\nsuperior gratification derived from the use and contemplation of costly\r\nand supposedly beautiful products is, commonly, in great measure a\r\ngratification of our sense of costliness masquerading under the name\r\nof beauty. Our higher appreciation of the superior article is an\r\nappreciation of its superior honorific character, much more frequently\r\nthan it is an unsophisticated appreciation of its beauty. The\r\nrequirement of conspicuous wastefulness is not commonly present,\r\nconsciously, in our canons of taste, but it is none the less present as\r\na constraining norm selectively shaping and sustaining our sense of what\r\nis beautiful, and guiding our discrimination with respect to what may\r\nlegitimately be approved as beautiful and what may not.\r\n\r\nIt is at this point, where the beautiful and the honorific meet and\r\nblend, that a discrimination between serviceability and wastefulness\r\nis most difficult in any concrete case. It frequently happens that an\r\narticle which serves the honorific purpose of conspicuous waste is at\r\nthe same time a beautiful object; and the same application of labor to\r\nwhich it owes its utility for the former purpose may, and often does,\r\ngive beauty of form and color to the article. The question is further\r\ncomplicated by the fact that many objects, as, for instance, the\r\nprecious stones and the metals and some other materials used for\r\nadornment and decoration, owe their utility as items of conspicuous\r\nwaste to an antecedent utility as objects of beauty. Gold, for instance,\r\nhas a high degree of sensuous beauty very many if not most of the highly\r\nprized works of art are intrinsically beautiful, though often with\r\nmaterial qualification; the like is true of some stuffs used for\r\nclothing, of some landscapes, and of many other things in less degree.\r\nExcept for this intrinsic beauty which they possess, these objects\r\nwould scarcely have been coveted as they are, or have become monopolized\r\nobjects of pride to their possessors and users. But the utility of these\r\nthings to the possessor is commonly due less to their intrinsic beauty\r\nthan to the honor which their possession and consumption confers, or to\r\nthe obloquy which it wards off.\r\n\r\nApart from their serviceability in other respects, these objects are\r\nbeautiful and have a utility as such; they are valuable on this account\r\nif they can be appropriated or monopolized; they are, therefore, coveted\r\nas valuable possessions, and their exclusive enjoyment gratifies the\r\npossessor\'s sense of pecuniary superiority at the same time that their\r\ncontemplation gratifies his sense of beauty. But their beauty, in the\r\nnaive sense of the word, is the occasion rather than the ground of their\r\nmonopolization or of their commercial value. "Great as is the sensuous\r\nbeauty of gems, their rarity and price adds an expression of distinction\r\nto them, which they would never have if they were cheap." There is,\r\nindeed, in the common run of cases under this head, relatively little\r\nincentive to the exclusive possession and use of these beautiful\r\nthings, except on the ground of their honorific character as items of\r\nconspicuous waste. Most objects of this general class, with the partial\r\nexception of articles of personal adornment, would serve all other\r\npurposes than the honorific one equally well, whether owned by the\r\nperson viewing them or not; and even as regards personal ornaments it is\r\nto be added that their chief purpose is to lend \xe9clat to the person\r\nof their wearer (or owner) by comparison with other persons who are\r\ncompelled to do without. The aesthetic serviceability of objects of\r\nbeauty is not greatly nor universally heightened by possession.\r\n\r\nThe generalization for which the discussion so far affords ground is\r\nthat any valuable object in order to appeal to our sense of beauty must\r\nconform to the requirements of beauty and of expensiveness both. But\r\nthis is not all. Beyond this the canon of expensiveness also affects\r\nour tastes in such a way as to inextricably blend the marks of\r\nexpensiveness, in our appreciation, with the beautiful features of\r\nthe object, and to subsume the resultant effect under the head of an\r\nappreciation of beauty simply. The marks of expensiveness come to be\r\naccepted as beautiful features of the expensive articles. They are\r\npleasing as being marks of honorific costliness, and the pleasure which\r\nthey afford on this score blends with that afforded by the beautiful\r\nform and color of the object; so that we often declare that an article\r\nof apparel, for instance, is "perfectly lovely," when pretty much all\r\nthat an analysis of the aesthetic value of the article would leave\r\nground for is the declaration that it is pecuniarily honorific.\r\n\r\nThis blending and confusion of the elements of expensiveness and\r\nof beauty is, perhaps, best exemplified in articles of dress and of\r\nhousehold furniture. The code of reputability in matters of dress\r\ndecides what shapes, colors, materials, and general effects in human\r\napparel are for the time to be accepted as suitable; and departures from\r\nthe code are offensive to our taste, supposedly as being departures from\r\naesthetic truth. The approval with which we look upon fashionable attire\r\nis by no means to be accounted pure make-believe. We readily, and for\r\nthe most part with utter sincerity, find those things pleasing that\r\nare in vogue. Shaggy dress-stuffs and pronounced color effects, for\r\ninstance, offend us at times when the vogue is goods of a high,\r\nglossy finish and neutral colors. A fancy bonnet of this year\'s model\r\nunquestionably appeals to our sensibilities today much more forcibly\r\nthan an equally fancy bonnet of the model of last year; although\r\nwhen viewed in the perspective of a quarter of a century, it would, I\r\napprehend, be a matter of the utmost difficulty to award the palm\r\nfor intrinsic beauty to the one rather than to the other of these\r\nstructures. So, again, it may be remarked that, considered simply in\r\ntheir physical juxtaposition with the human form, the high gloss of a\r\ngentleman\'s hat or of a patent-leather shoe has no more of intrinsic\r\nbeauty than a similarly high gloss on a threadbare sleeve; and yet\r\nthere is no question but that all well-bred people (in the Occidental\r\ncivilized communities) instinctively and unaffectedly cleave to the one\r\nas a phenomenon of great beauty, and eschew the other as offensive to\r\nevery sense to which it can appeal. It is extremely doubtful if any one\r\ncould be induced to wear such a contrivance as the high hat of civilized\r\nsociety, except for some urgent reason based on other than aesthetic\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nBy further habituation to an appreciative perception of the marks\r\nof expensiveness in goods, and by habitually identifying beauty with\r\nreputability, it comes about that a beautiful article which is not\r\nexpensive is accounted not beautiful. In this way it has happened, for\r\ninstance, that some beautiful flowers pass conventionally for offensive\r\nweeds; others that can be cultivated with relative ease are accepted\r\nand admired by the lower middle class, who can afford no more expensive\r\nluxuries of this kind; but these varieties are rejected as vulgar by\r\nthose people who are better able to pay for expensive flowers and who\r\nare educated to a higher schedule of pecuniary beauty in the florist\'s\r\nproducts; while still other flowers, of no greater intrinsic beauty than\r\nthese, are cultivated at great cost and call out much admiration from\r\nflower-lovers whose tastes have been matured under the critical guidance\r\nof a polite environment.\r\n\r\nThe same variation in matters of taste, from one class of society to\r\nanother, is visible also as regards many other kinds of consumable\r\ngoods, as, for example, is the case with furniture, houses, parks,\r\nand gardens. This diversity of views as to what is beautiful in these\r\nvarious classes of goods is not a diversity of the norm according to\r\nwhich the unsophisticated sense of the beautiful works. It is not a\r\nconstitutional difference of endowments in the aesthetic respect, but\r\nrather a difference in the code of reputability which specifies what\r\nobjects properly lie within the scope of honorific consumption for the\r\nclass to which the critic belongs. It is a difference in the traditions\r\nof propriety with respect to the kinds of things which may, without\r\nderogation to the consumer, be consumed under the head of objects of\r\ntaste and art. With a certain allowance for variations to be accounted\r\nfor on other grounds, these traditions are determined, more or less\r\nrigidly, by the pecuniary plane of life of the class.\r\n\r\nEveryday life affords many curious illustrations of the way in which the\r\ncode of pecuniary beauty in articles of use varies from class to class,\r\nas well as of the way in which the conventional sense of beauty departs\r\nin its deliverances from the sense untutored by the requirements of\r\npecuniary repute. Such a fact is the lawn, or the close-cropped yard or\r\npark, which appeals so unaffectedly to the taste of the Western peoples.\r\nIt appears especially to appeal to the tastes of the well-to-do classes\r\nin those communities in which the dolicho-blond element predominates\r\nin an appreciable degree. The lawn unquestionably has an element of\r\nsensuous beauty, simply as an object of apperception, and as such no\r\ndoubt it appeals pretty directly to the eye of nearly all races and all\r\nclasses; but it is, perhaps, more unquestionably beautiful to the eye\r\nof the dolicho-blond than to most other varieties of men. This higher\r\nappreciation of a stretch of greensward in this ethnic element than\r\nin the other elements of the population, goes along with certain other\r\nfeatures of the dolicho-blond temperament that indicate that this racial\r\nelement had once been for a long time a pastoral people inhabiting a\r\nregion with a humid climate. The close-cropped lawn is beautiful in the\r\neyes of a people whose inherited bent it is to readily find pleasure in\r\ncontemplating a well-preserved pasture or grazing land.\r\n\r\nFor the aesthetic purpose the lawn is a cow pasture; and in some cases\r\ntoday--where the expensiveness of the attendant circumstances bars out\r\nany imputation of thrift--the idyl of the dolicho-blond is rehabilitated\r\nin the introduction of a cow into a lawn or private ground. In such\r\ncases the cow made use of is commonly of an expensive breed. The vulgar\r\nsuggestion of thrift, which is nearly inseparable from the cow, is a\r\nstanding objection to the decorative use of this animal. So that in all\r\ncases, except where luxurious surroundings negate this suggestion,\r\nthe use of the cow as an object of taste must be avoided. Where the\r\npredilection for some grazing animal to fill out the suggestion of the\r\npasture is too strong to be suppressed, the cow\'s place is often given\r\nto some more or less inadequate substitute, such as deer, antelopes, or\r\nsome such exotic beast. These substitutes, although less beautiful\r\nto the pastoral eye of Western man than the cow, are in such cases\r\npreferred because of their superior expensiveness or futility, and their\r\nconsequent repute. They are not vulgarly lucrative either in fact or in\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nPublic parks of course fall in the same category with the lawn; they\r\ntoo, at their best, are imitations of the pasture. Such a park is of\r\ncourse best kept by grazing, and the cattle on the grass are themselves\r\nno mean addition to the beauty of the thing, as need scarcely be\r\ninsisted on with anyone who has once seen a well-kept pasture. But it\r\nis worth noting, as an expression of the pecuniary element in popular\r\ntaste, that such a method of keeping public grounds is seldom resorted\r\nto. The best that is done by skilled workmen under the supervision of a\r\ntrained keeper is a more or less close imitation of a pasture, but\r\nthe result invariably falls somewhat short of the artistic effect of\r\ngrazing. But to the average popular apprehension a herd of cattle so\r\npointedly suggests thrift and usefulness that their presence in the\r\npublic pleasure ground would be intolerably cheap. This method\r\nof keeping grounds is comparatively inexpensive, therefore it is\r\nindecorous.\r\n\r\nOf the same general bearing is another feature of public grounds. There\r\nis a studious exhibition of expensiveness coupled with a make-believe of\r\nsimplicity and crude serviceability. Private grounds also show the same\r\nphysiognomy wherever they are in the management or ownership of persons\r\nwhose tastes have been formed under middle-class habits of life or under\r\nthe upper-class traditions of no later a date than the childhood of the\r\ngeneration that is now passing. Grounds which conform to the instructed\r\ntastes of the latter-day upper class do not show these features in so\r\nmarked a degree. The reason for this difference in tastes between the\r\npast and the incoming generation of the well-bred lies in the changing\r\neconomic situation. A similar difference is perceptible in other\r\nrespects, as well as in the accepted ideals of pleasure grounds. In this\r\ncountry as in most others, until the last half century but a very small\r\nproportion of the population were possessed of such wealth as would\r\nexempt them from thrift. Owing to imperfect means of communication,\r\nthis small fraction were scattered and out of effective touch with one\r\nanother. There was therefore no basis for a growth of taste in disregard\r\nof expensiveness. The revolt of the well-bred taste against vulgar\r\nthrift was unchecked. Wherever the unsophisticated sense of beauty\r\nmight show itself sporadically in an approval of inexpensive or thrifty\r\nsurroundings, it would lack the "social confirmation" which nothing\r\nbut a considerable body of like-minded people can give. There was,\r\ntherefore, no effective upper-class opinion that would overlook\r\nevidences of possible inexpensiveness in the management of grounds;\r\nand there was consequently no appreciable divergence between the\r\nleisure-class and the lower middle-class ideal in the physiognomy of\r\npleasure grounds. Both classes equally constructed their ideals with the\r\nfear of pecuniary disrepute before their eyes.\r\n\r\nToday a divergence in ideals is beginning to be apparent. The portion of\r\nthe leisure class that has been consistently exempt from work and from\r\npecuniary cares for a generation or more is now large enough to form and\r\nsustain opinion in matters of taste. Increased mobility of the members\r\nhas also added to the facility with which a "social confirmation" can be\r\nattained within the class. Within this select class the exemption from\r\nthrift is a matter so commonplace as to have lost much of its utility\r\nas a basis of pecuniary decency. Therefore the latter-day upper-class\r\ncanons of taste do not so consistently insist on an unremitting\r\ndemonstration of expensiveness and a strict exclusion of the appearance\r\nof thrift. So, a predilection for the rustic and the "natural" in parks\r\nand grounds makes its appearance on these higher social and intellectual\r\nlevels. This predilection is in large part an outcropping of the\r\ninstinct of workmanship; and it works out its results with varying\r\ndegrees of consistency. It is seldom altogether unaffected, and at times\r\nit shades off into something not widely different from that make-believe\r\nof rusticity which has been referred to above.\r\n\r\nA weakness for crudely serviceable contrivances that pointedly suggest\r\nimmediate and wasteless use is present even in the middle-class tastes;\r\nbut it is there kept well in hand under the unbroken dominance of the\r\ncanon of reputable futility. Consequently it works out in a variety\r\nof ways and means for shamming serviceability--in such contrivances\r\nas rustic fences, bridges, bowers, pavilions, and the like decorative\r\nfeatures. An expression of this affectation of serviceability, at what\r\nis perhaps its widest divergence from the first promptings of the\r\nsense of economic beauty, is afforded by the cast-iron rustic fence and\r\ntrellis or by a circuitous drive laid across level ground.\r\n\r\nThe select leisure class has outgrown the use of these\r\npseudo-serviceable variants of pecuniary beauty, at least at some\r\npoints. But the taste of the more recent accessions to the leisure class\r\nproper and of the middle and lower classes still requires a pecuniary\r\nbeauty to supplement the aesthetic beauty, even in those objects which\r\nare primarily admired for the beauty that belongs to them as natural\r\ngrowths.\r\n\r\nThe popular taste in these matters is to be seen in the prevalent high\r\nappreciation of topiary work and of the conventional flower-beds of\r\npublic grounds. Perhaps as happy an illustration as may be had of this\r\ndominance of pecuniary beauty over aesthetic beauty in middle-class\r\ntastes is seen in the reconstruction of the grounds lately occupied by\r\nthe Columbian Exposition. The evidence goes to show that the requirement\r\nof reputable expensiveness is still present in good vigor even where\r\nall ostensibly lavish display is avoided. The artistic effects actually\r\nwrought in this work of reconstruction diverge somewhat widely from\r\nthe effect to which the same ground would have lent itself in hands not\r\nguided by pecuniary canons of taste. And even the better class of the\r\ncity\'s population view the progress of the work with an unreserved\r\napproval which suggests that there is in this case little if any\r\ndiscrepancy between the tastes of the upper and the lower or middle\r\nclasses of the city. The sense of beauty in the population of this\r\nrepresentative city of the advanced pecuniary culture is very chary of\r\nany departure from its great cultural principle of conspicuous waste.\r\n\r\nThe love of nature, perhaps itself borrowed from a higher-class code of\r\ntaste, sometimes expresses itself in unexpected ways under the guidance\r\nof this canon of pecuniary beauty, and leads to results that may seem\r\nincongruous to an unreflecting beholder. The well-accepted practice of\r\nplanting trees in the treeless areas of this country, for instance, has\r\nbeen carried over as an item of honorific expenditure into the heavily\r\nwooded areas; so that it is by no means unusual for a village or a\r\nfarmer in the wooded country to clear the land of its native trees and\r\nimmediately replant saplings of certain introduced varieties about the\r\nfarmyard or along the streets. In this way a forest growth of oak, elm,\r\nbeech, butternut, hemlock, basswood, and birch is cleared off to give\r\nroom for saplings of soft maple, cottonwood, and brittle willow. It is\r\nfelt that the inexpensiveness of leaving the forest trees standing\r\nwould derogate from the dignity that should invest an article which is\r\nintended to serve a decorative and honorific end.\r\n\r\nThe like pervading guidance of taste by pecuniary repute is traceable\r\nin the prevalent standards of beauty in animals. The part played by this\r\ncanon of taste in assigning her place in the popular aesthetic scale to\r\nthe cow has already been spokes of. Something to the same effect is\r\ntrue of the other domestic animals, so far as they are in an appreciable\r\ndegree industrially useful to the community--as, for instance, barnyard\r\nfowl, hogs, cattle, sheep, goats, draught-horses. They are of the\r\nnature of productive goods, and serve a useful, often a lucrative end;\r\ntherefore beauty is not readily imputed to them. The case is different\r\nwith those domestic animals which ordinarily serve no industrial end;\r\nsuch as pigeons, parrots and other cage-birds, cats, dogs, and fast\r\nhorses. These commonly are items of conspicuous consumption, and are\r\ntherefore honorific in their nature and may legitimately be accounted\r\nbeautiful. This class of animals are conventionally admired by the body\r\nof the upper classes, while the pecuniarily lower classes--and that\r\nselect minority of the leisure class among whom the rigorous canon that\r\nabjures thrift is in a measure obsolescent--find beauty in one class of\r\nanimals as in another, without drawing a hard and fast line of pecuniary\r\ndemarcation between the beautiful and the ugly. In the case of those\r\ndomestic animals which are honorific and are reputed beautiful, there\r\nis a subsidiary basis of merit that should be spokes of. Apart from the\r\nbirds which belong in the honorific class of domestic animals, and which\r\nowe their place in this class to their non-lucrative character alone,\r\nthe animals which merit particular attention are cats, dogs, and fast\r\nhorses. The cat is less reputable than the other two just named, because\r\nshe is less wasteful; she may even serve a useful end. At the same time\r\nthe cat\'s temperament does not fit her for the honorific purpose. She\r\nlives with man on terms of equality, knows nothing of that relation of\r\nstatus which is the ancient basis of all distinctions of worth, honor,\r\nand repute, and she does not lend herself with facility to an invidious\r\ncomparison between her owner and his neighbors. The exception to this\r\nlast rule occurs in the case of such scarce and fanciful products as\r\nthe Angora cat, which have some slight honorific value on the ground\r\nof expensiveness, and have, therefore, some special claim to beauty on\r\npecuniary grounds.\r\n\r\nThe dog has advantages in the way of uselessness as well as in special\r\ngifts of temperament. He is often spoken of, in an eminent sense, as\r\nthe friend of man, and his intelligence and fidelity are praised. The\r\nmeaning of this is that the dog is man\'s servant and that he has\r\nthe gift of an unquestioning subservience and a slave\'s quickness in\r\nguessing his master\'s mood. Coupled with these traits, which fit him\r\nwell for the relation of status--and which must for the present purpose\r\nbe set down as serviceable traits--the dog has some characteristics\r\nwhich are of a more equivocal aesthetic value. He is the filthiest of\r\nthe domestic animals in his person and the nastiest in his habits. For\r\nthis he makes up is a servile, fawning attitude towards his master, and\r\na readiness to inflict damage and discomfort on all else. The dog, then,\r\ncommends himself to our favor by affording play to our propensity for\r\nmastery, and as he is also an item of expense, and commonly serves no\r\nindustrial purpose, he holds a well-assured place in men\'s regard as\r\na thing of good repute. The dog is at the same time associated in our\r\nimagination with the chase--a meritorious employment and an expression\r\nof the honorable predatory impulse. Standing on this vantage ground,\r\nwhatever beauty of form and motion and whatever commendable mental\r\ntraits he may possess are conventionally acknowledged and magnified.\r\nAnd even those varieties of the dog which have been bred into grotesque\r\ndeformity by the dog-fancier are in good faith accounted beautiful by\r\nmany. These varieties of dogs--and the like is true of other fancy-bred\r\nanimals--are rated and graded in aesthetic value somewhat in proportion\r\nto the degree of grotesqueness and instability of the particular fashion\r\nwhich the deformity takes in the given case. For the purpose in hand,\r\nthis differential utility on the ground of grotesqueness and instability\r\nof structure is reducible to terms of a greater scarcity and consequent\r\nexpense. The commercial value of canine monstrosities, such as the\r\nprevailing styles of pet dogs both for men\'s and women\'s use, rests\r\non their high cost of production, and their value to their owners\r\nlies chiefly in their utility as items of conspicuous consumption.\r\nIndirectly, through reflection upon their honorific expensiveness,\r\na social worth is imputed to them; and so, by an easy substitution of\r\nwords and ideas, they come to be admired and reputed beautiful. Since\r\nany attention bestowed upon these animals is in no sense gainful\r\nor useful, it is also reputable; and since the habit of giving them\r\nattention is consequently not deprecated, it may grow into an habitual\r\nattachment of great tenacity and of a most benevolent character. So that\r\nin the affection bestowed on pet animals the canon of expensiveness\r\nis present more or less remotely as a norm which guides and shapes the\r\nsentiment and the selection of its object. The like is true, as will be\r\nnoticed presently, with respect to affection for persons also; although\r\nthe manner in which the norm acts in that case is somewhat different.\r\n\r\nThe case of the fast horse is much like that of the dog. He is on the\r\nwhole expensive, or wasteful and useless--for the industrial purpose.\r\nWhat productive use he may possess, in the way of enhancing the\r\nwell-being of the community or making the way of life easier for men,\r\ntakes the form of exhibitions of force and facility of motion that\r\ngratify the popular aesthetic sense. This is of course a substantial\r\nserviceability. The horse is not endowed with the spiritual aptitude\r\nfor servile dependence in the same measure as the dog; but he ministers\r\neffectually to his master\'s impulse to convert the "animate" forces of\r\nthe environment to his own use and discretion and so express his own\r\ndominating individuality through them. The fast horse is at least\r\npotentially a race-horse, of high or low degree; and it is as such that\r\nhe is peculiarly serviceable to his owner. The utility of the fast horse\r\nlies largely in his efficiency as a means of emulation; it gratifies the\r\nowner\'s sense of aggression and dominance to have his own horse outstrip\r\nhis neighbor\'s. This use being not lucrative, but on the whole pretty\r\nconsistently wasteful, and quite conspicuously so, it is honorific,\r\nand therefore gives the fast horse a strong presumptive position of\r\nreputability. Beyond this, the race-horse proper has also a similarly\r\nnon-industrial but honorific use as a gambling instrument.\r\n\r\nThe fast horse, then, is aesthetically fortunate, in that the canon of\r\npecuniary good repute legitimates a free appreciation of whatever beauty\r\nor serviceability he may possess. His pretensions have the countenance\r\nof the principle of conspicuous waste and the backing of the predatory\r\naptitude for dominance and emulation. The horse is, moreover, a\r\nbeautiful animal, although the race-horse is so in no peculiar degree to\r\nthe uninstructed taste of those persons who belong neither in the class\r\nof race-horse fanciers nor in the class whose sense of beauty is held in\r\nabeyance by the moral constraint of the horse fancier\'s award. To this\r\nuntutored taste the most beautiful horse seems to be a form which has\r\nsuffered less radical alteration than the race-horse under the\r\nbreeder\'s selective development of the animal. Still, when a writer\r\nor speaker--especially of those whose eloquence is most consistently\r\ncommonplace wants an illustration of animal grace and serviceability,\r\nfor rhetorical use, he habitually turns to the horse; and he commonly\r\nmakes it plain before he is done that what he has in mind is the\r\nrace-horse.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that in the graduated appreciation of varieties\r\nof horses and of dogs, such as one meets with among people of even\r\nmoderately cultivated tastes in these matters, there is also discernible\r\nanother and more direct line of influence of the leisure-class canons of\r\nreputability. In this country, for instance, leisure-class tastes are\r\nto some extent shaped on usages and habits which prevail, or which are\r\napprehended to prevail, among the leisure class of Great Britain. In\r\ndogs this is true to a less extent than in horses. In horses, more\r\nparticularly in saddle horses--which at their best serve the purpose of\r\nwasteful display simply--it will hold true in a general way that a\r\nhorse is more beautiful in proportion as he is more English; the English\r\nleisure class being, for purposes of reputable usage, the upper leisure\r\nclass of this country, and so the exemplar for the lower grades. This\r\nmimicry in the methods of the apperception of beauty and in the forming\r\nof judgments of taste need not result in a spurious, or at any rate not\r\na hypocritical or affected, predilection. The predilection is as serious\r\nand as substantial an award of taste when it rests on this basis as\r\nwhen it rests on any other, the difference is that this taste is and\r\nas substantial an award of taste when it rests on this basis as when it\r\nrests on any other; the difference is that this taste is a taste for the\r\nreputably correct, not for the aesthetically true.\r\n\r\nThe mimicry, it should be said, extends further than to the sense of\r\nbeauty in horseflesh simply. It includes trappings and horsemanship as\r\nwell, so that the correct or reputably beautiful seat or posture is also\r\ndecided by English usage, as well as the equestrian gait. To show how\r\nfortuitous may sometimes be the circumstances which decide what shall\r\nbe becoming and what not under the pecuniary canon of beauty, it may be\r\nnoted that this English seat, and the peculiarly distressing gait which\r\nhas made an awkward seat necessary, are a survival from the time when\r\nthe English roads were so bad with mire and mud as to be virtually\r\nimpassable for a horse travelling at a more comfortable gait; so that\r\na person of decorous tastes in horsemanship today rides a punch with\r\ndocked tail, in an uncomfortable posture and at a distressing gait,\r\nbecause the English roads during a great part of the last century were\r\nimpassable for a horse travelling at a more horse-like gait, or for\r\nan animal built for moving with ease over the firm and open country to\r\nwhich the horse is indigenous. It is not only with respect to consumable\r\ngoods--including domestic animals--that the canons of taste have been\r\ncolored by the canons of pecuniary reputability. Something to the like\r\neffect is to be said for beauty in persons. In order to avoid whatever\r\nmay be matter of controversy, no weight will be given in this connection\r\nto such popular predilection as there may be for the dignified\r\n(leisurely) bearing and poly presence that are by vulgar tradition\r\nassociated with opulence in mature men. These traits are in some measure\r\naccepted as elements of personal beauty. But there are certain elements\r\nof feminine beauty, on the other hand, which come in under this head,\r\nand which are of so concrete and specific a character as to admit of\r\nitemized appreciation. It is more or less a rule that in communities\r\nwhich are at the stage of economic development at which women are valued\r\nby the upper class for their service, the ideal of female beauty is a\r\nrobust, large-limbed woman. The ground of appreciation is the physique,\r\nwhile the conformation of the face is of secondary weight only. A\r\nwell-known instance of this ideal of the early predatory culture is that\r\nof the maidens of the Homeric poems.\r\n\r\nThis ideal suffers a change in the succeeding development, when, in the\r\nconventional scheme, the office of the high-class wife comes to be a\r\nvicarious leisure simply. The ideal then includes the characteristics\r\nwhich are supposed to result from or to go with a life of leisure\r\nconsistently enforced. The ideal accepted under these circumstances may\r\nbe gathered from descriptions of beautiful women by poets and writers of\r\nthe chivalric times. In the conventional scheme of those days ladies\r\nof high degree were conceived to be in perpetual tutelage, and to be\r\nscrupulously exempt from all useful work. The resulting chivalric or\r\nromantic ideal of beauty takes cognizance chiefly of the face, and\r\ndwells on its delicacy, and on the delicacy of the hands and feet,\r\nthe slender figure, and especially the slender waist. In the pictured\r\nrepresentations of the women of that time, and in modern romantic\r\nimitators of the chivalric thought and feeling, the waist is attenuated\r\nto a degree that implies extreme debility. The same ideal is still\r\nextant among a considerable portion of the population of modern\r\nindustrial communities; but it is to be said that it has retained\r\nits hold most tenaciously in those modern communities which are least\r\nadvanced in point of economic and civil development, and which show the\r\nmost considerable survivals of status and of predatory institutions.\r\nThat is to say, the chivalric ideal is best preserved in those existing\r\ncommunities which are substantially least modern. Survivals of this\r\nlackadaisical or romantic ideal occur freely in the tastes of the\r\nwell-to-do classes of Continental countries. In modern communities which\r\nhave reached the higher levels of industrial development, the upper\r\nleisure class has accumulated so great a mass of wealth as to place its\r\nwomen above all imputation of vulgarly productive labor. Here the status\r\nof women as vicarious consumers is beginning to lose its place in the\r\nsections of the body of the people; and as a consequence the ideal of\r\nfeminine beauty is beginning to change back again from the infirmly\r\ndelicate, translucent, and hazardously slender, to a woman of the\r\narchaic type that does not disown her hands and feet, nor, indeed, the\r\nother gross material facts of her person. In the course of economic\r\ndevelopment the ideal of beauty among the peoples of the Western culture\r\nhas shifted from the woman of physical presence to the lady, and it is\r\nbeginning to shift back again to the woman; and all in obedience to the\r\nchanging conditions of pecuniary emulation. The exigencies of emulation\r\nat one time required lusty slaves; at another time they required a\r\nconspicuous performance of vicarious leisure and consequently an obvious\r\ndisability; but the situation is now beginning to outgrow this last\r\nrequirement, since, under the higher efficiency of modern industry,\r\nleisure in women is possible so far down the scale of reputability that\r\nit will no longer serve as a definitive mark of the highest pecuniary\r\ngrade.\r\n\r\nApart from this general control exercised by the norm of conspicuous\r\nwaste over the ideal of feminine beauty, there are one or two details\r\nwhich merit specific mention as showing how it may exercise an extreme\r\nconstraint in detail over men\'s sense of beauty in women. It has\r\nalready been noticed that at the stages of economic evolution at which\r\nconspicuous leisure is much regarded as a means of good repute, the\r\nideal requires delicate and diminutive hands and feet and a slender\r\nwaist. These features, together with the other, related faults of\r\nstructure that commonly go with them, go to show that the person so\r\naffected is incapable of useful effort and must therefore be supported\r\nin idleness by her owner. She is useless and expensive, and she is\r\nconsequently valuable as evidence of pecuniary strength. It results that\r\nat this cultural stage women take thought to alter their persons, so as\r\nto conform more nearly to the requirements of the instructed taste of\r\nthe time; and under the guidance of the canon of pecuniary decency,\r\nthe men find the resulting artificially induced pathological features\r\nattractive. So, for instance, the constricted waist which has had so\r\nwide and persistent a vogue in the communities of the Western culture,\r\nand so also the deformed foot of the Chinese. Both of these are\r\nmutilations of unquestioned repulsiveness to the untrained sense. It\r\nrequires habituation to become reconciled to them. Yet there is no room\r\nto question their attractiveness to men into whose scheme of life they\r\nfit as honorific items sanctioned by the requirements of pecuniary\r\nreputability. They are items of pecuniary and cultural beauty which have\r\ncome to do duty as elements of the ideal of womanliness.\r\n\r\nThe connection here indicated between the aesthetic value and the\r\ninvidious pecuniary value of things is of course not present in the\r\nconsciousness of the valuer. So far as a person, in forming a judgment\r\nof taste, takes thought and reflects that the object of beauty under\r\nconsideration is wasteful and reputable, and therefore may legitimately\r\nbe accounted beautiful; so far the judgment is not a bona fide judgment\r\nof taste and does not come up for consideration in this connection. The\r\nconnection which is here insisted on between the reputability and the\r\napprehended beauty of objects lies through the effect which the fact of\r\nreputability has upon the valuer\'s habits of thought. He is in the\r\nhabit of forming judgments of value of various kinds-economic, moral,\r\naesthetic, or reputable concerning the objects with which he has to do,\r\nand his attitude of commendation towards a given object on any other\r\nground will affect the degree of his appreciation of the object when he\r\ncomes to value it for the aesthetic purpose. This is more particularly\r\ntrue as regards valuation on grounds so closely related to the aesthetic\r\nground as that of reputability. The valuation for the aesthetic purpose\r\nand for the purpose of repute are not held apart as distinctly as might\r\nbe. Confusion is especially apt to arise between these two kinds of\r\nvaluation, because the value of objects for repute is not habitually\r\ndistinguished in speech by the use of a special descriptive term. The\r\nresult is that the terms in familiar use to designate categories\r\nor elements of beauty are applied to cover this unnamed element of\r\npecuniary merit, and the corresponding confusion of ideas follows by\r\neasy consequence. The demands of reputability in this way coalesce in\r\nthe popular apprehension with the demands of the sense of beauty, and\r\nbeauty which is not accompanied by the accredited marks of good repute\r\nis not accepted. But the requirements of pecuniary reputability and\r\nthose of beauty in the naive sense do not in any appreciable degree\r\ncoincide. The elimination from our surroundings of the pecuniarily\r\nunfit, therefore, results in a more or less thorough elimination of that\r\nconsiderable range of elements of beauty which do not happen to conform\r\nto the pecuniary requirement. The underlying norms of taste are of very\r\nancient growth, probably far antedating the advent of the pecuniary\r\ninstitutions that are here under discussion. Consequently, by force of\r\nthe past selective adaptation of men\'s habits of thought, it happens\r\nthat the requirements of beauty, simply, are for the most part best\r\nsatisfied by inexpensive contrivances and structures which in a\r\nstraightforward manner suggest both the office which they are to perform\r\nand the method of serving their end. It may be in place to recall the\r\nmodern psychological position. Beauty of form seems to be a question of\r\nfacility of apperception. The proposition could perhaps safely be made\r\nbroader than this. If abstraction is made from association, suggestion,\r\nand "expression," classed as elements of beauty, then beauty in any\r\nperceived object means that the mind readily unfolds its apperceptive\r\nactivity in the directions which the object in question affords. But the\r\ndirections in which activity readily unfolds or expresses itself are the\r\ndirections to which long and close habituation has made the mind prone.\r\nSo far as concerns the essential elements of beauty, this habituation\r\nis an habituation so close and long as to have induced not only a\r\nproclivity to the apperceptive form in question, but an adaptation of\r\nphysiological structure and function as well. So far as the economic\r\ninterest enters into the constitution of beauty, it enters as a\r\nsuggestion or expression of adequacy to a purpose, a manifest and\r\nreadily inferable subservience to the life process. This expression of\r\neconomic facility or economic serviceability in any object--what may\r\nbe called the economic beauty of the object-is best served by neat and\r\nunambiguous suggestion of its office and its efficiency for the material\r\nends of life.\r\n\r\nOn this ground, among objects of use the simple and unadorned article\r\nis aesthetically the best. But since the pecuniary canon of reputability\r\nrejects the inexpensive in articles appropriated to individual\r\nconsumption, the satisfaction of our craving for beautiful things\r\nmust be sought by way of compromise. The canons of beauty must be\r\ncircumvented by some contrivance which will give evidence of a reputably\r\nwasteful expenditure, at the same time that it meets the demands of our\r\ncritical sense of the useful and the beautiful, or at least meets the\r\ndemand of some habit which has come to do duty in place of that sense.\r\nSuch an auxiliary sense of taste is the sense of novelty; and this\r\nlatter is helped out in its surrogateship by the curiosity with which\r\nmen view ingenious and puzzling contrivances. Hence it comes that\r\nmost objects alleged to be beautiful, and doing duty as such, show\r\nconsiderable ingenuity of design and are calculated to puzzle the\r\nbeholder--to bewilder him with irrelevant suggestions and hints of the\r\nimprobable--at the same time that they give evidence of an expenditure\r\nof labor in excess of what would give them their fullest efficency for\r\ntheir ostensible economic end.\r\n\r\nThis may be shown by an illustration taken from outside the range of our\r\neveryday habits and everyday contact, and so outside the range of\r\nour bias. Such are the remarkable feather mantles of Hawaii, or the\r\nwell-known cawed handles of the ceremonial adzes of several Polynesian\r\nislands. These are undeniably beautiful, both in the sense that they\r\noffer a pleasing composition of form, lines, and color, and in the sense\r\nthat they evince great skill and ingenuity in design and construction.\r\nAt the same time the articles are manifestly ill fitted to serve any\r\nother economic purpose. But it is not always that the evolution of\r\ningenious and puzzling contrivances under the guidance of the canon of\r\nwasted effort works out so happy a result. The result is quite as\r\noften a virtually complete suppression of all elements that would\r\nbear scrutiny as expressions of beauty, or of serviceability, and the\r\nsubstitution of evidences of misspent ingenuity and labor, backed by a\r\nconspicuous ineptitude; until many of the objects with which we surround\r\nourselves in everyday life, and even many articles of everyday dress and\r\nornament, are such as would not be tolerated except under the stress of\r\nprescriptive tradition. Illustrations of this substitution of ingenuity\r\nand expense in place of beauty and serviceability are to be seen, for\r\ninstance, in domestic architecture, in domestic art or fancy work,\r\nin various articles of apparel, especially of feminine and priestly\r\napparel.\r\n\r\nThe canon of beauty requires expression of the generic. The "novelty"\r\ndue to the demands of conspicuous waste traverses this canon of beauty,\r\nin that it results in making the physiognomy of our objects of taste a\r\ncongeries of idiosyncrasies; and the idiosyncrasies are, moreover, under\r\nthe selective surveillance of the canon of expensiveness.\r\n\r\nThis process of selective adaptation of designs to the end of\r\nconspicuous waste, and the substitution of pecuniary beauty for\r\naesthetic beauty, has been especially effective in the development of\r\narchitecture. It would be extremely difficult to find a modern civilized\r\nresidence or public building which can claim anything better than\r\nrelative inoffensiveness in the eyes of anyone who will dissociate the\r\nelements of beauty from those of honorific waste. The endless variety of\r\nfronts presented by the better class of tenements and apartment houses\r\nin our cities is an endless variety of architectural distress and of\r\nsuggestions of expensive discomfort. Considered as objects of beauty,\r\nthe dead walls of the sides and back of these structures, left untouched\r\nby the hands of the artist, are commonly the best feature of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of the influence of the law of conspicuous waste upon\r\nthe canons of taste will hold true, with but a slight change of terms,\r\nof its influence upon our notions of the serviceability of goods for\r\nother ends than the aesthetic one. Goods are produced and consumed as a\r\nmeans to the fuller unfolding of human life; and their utility consists,\r\nin the first instance, in their efficiency as means to this end. The end\r\nis, in the first instance, the fullness of life of the individual, taken\r\nin absolute terms. But the human proclivity to emulation has seized upon\r\nthe consumption of goods as a means to an invidious comparison, and has\r\nthereby invested consumable goods with a secondary utility as evidence\r\nof relative ability to pay. This indirect or secondary use of consumable\r\ngoods lends an honorific character to consumption and presently also\r\nto the goods which best serve the emulative end of consumption. The\r\nconsumption of expensive goods is meritorious, and the goods which\r\ncontain an appreciable element of cost in excess of what goes to\r\ngive them serviceability for their ostensible mechanical purpose\r\nare honorific. The marks of superfluous costliness in the goods are\r\ntherefore marks of worth--of high efficency for the indirect, invidious\r\nend to be served by their consumption; and conversely, goods are\r\nhumilific, and therefore unattractive, if they show too thrifty an\r\nadaptation to the mechanical end sought and do not include a margin of\r\nexpensiveness on which to rest a complacent invidious comparison. This\r\nindirect utility gives much of their value to the "better" grades of\r\ngoods. In order to appeal to the cultivated sense of utility, an article\r\nmust contain a modicum of this indirect utility.\r\n\r\nWhile men may have set out with disapproving an inexpensive manner of\r\nliving because it indicated inability to spend much, and so indicated\r\na lack of pecuniary success, they end by falling into the habit of\r\ndisapproving cheap things as being intrinsically dishonorable or\r\nunworthy because they are cheap. As time has gone on, each succeeding\r\ngeneration has received this tradition of meritorious expenditure from\r\nthe generation before it, and has in its turn further elaborated and\r\nfortified the traditional canon of pecuniary reputability in goods\r\nconsumed; until we have finally reached such a degree of conviction as\r\nto the unworthiness of all inexpensive things, that we have no\r\nlonger any misgivings in formulating the maxim, "Cheap and nasty." So\r\nthoroughly has the habit of approving the expensive and disapproving\r\nthe inexpensive been ingrained into our thinking that we instinctively\r\ninsist upon at least some measure of wasteful expensiveness in all our\r\nconsumption, even in the case of goods which are consumed in strict\r\nprivacy and without the slightest thought of display. We all feel,\r\nsincerely and without misgiving, that we are the more lifted up in\r\nspirit for having, even in the privacy of our own household, eaten\r\nour daily meal by the help of hand-wrought silver utensils, from\r\nhand-painted china (often of dubious artistic value) laid on high-priced\r\ntable linen. Any retrogression from the standard of living which we are\r\naccustomed to regard as worthy in this respect is felt to be a grievous\r\nviolation of our human dignity. So, also, for the last dozen years\r\ncandles have been a more pleasing source of light at dinner than any\r\nother. Candlelight is now softer, less distressing to well-bred eyes,\r\nthan oil, gas, or electric light. The same could not have been said\r\nthirty years ago, when candles were, or recently had been, the cheapest\r\navailable light for domestic use. Nor are candles even now found to\r\ngive an acceptable or effective light for any other than a ceremonial\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\nA political sage still living has summed up the conclusion of this whole\r\nmatter in the dictum: "A cheap coat makes a cheap man," and there is\r\nprobably no one who does not feel the convincing force of the maxim.\r\n\r\nThe habit of looking for the marks of superfluous expensiveness in\r\ngoods, and of requiring that all goods should afford some utility of the\r\nindirect or invidious sort, leads to a change in the standards by which\r\nthe utility of goods is gauged. The honorific element and the element\r\nof brute efficiency are not held apart in the consumer\'s appreciation of\r\ncommodities, and the two together go to make up the unanalyzed\r\naggregate serviceability of the goods. Under the resulting standard of\r\nserviceability, no article will pass muster on the strength of material\r\nsufficiency alone. In order to completeness and full acceptability to\r\nthe consumer it must also show the honorific element. It results that\r\nthe producers of articles of consumption direct their efforts to the\r\nproduction of goods that shall meet this demand for the honorific\r\nelement. They will do this with all the more alacrity and effect, since\r\nthey are themselves under the dominance of the same standard of worth in\r\ngoods, and would be sincerely grieved at the sight of goods which lack\r\nthe proper honorific finish. Hence it has come about that there are\r\ntoday no goods supplied in any trade which do not contain the\r\nhonorific element in greater or less degree. Any consumer who might,\r\nDiogenes-like, insist on the elimination of all honorific or wasteful\r\nelements from his consumption, would be unable to supply his most\r\ntrivial wants in the modern market. Indeed, even if he resorted to\r\nsupplying his wants directly by his own efforts, he would find it\r\ndifficult if not impossible to divest himself of the current habits of\r\nthought on this head; so that he could scarcely compass a supply of the\r\nnecessaries of life for a day\'s consumption without instinctively and\r\nby oversight incorporating in his home-made product something of this\r\nhonorific, quasi-decorative element of wasted labor.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that in their selection of serviceable goods in the\r\nretail market purchasers are guided more by the finish and workmanship\r\nof the goods than by any marks of substantial serviceability. Goods,\r\nin order to sell, must have some appreciable amount of labor spent in\r\ngiving them the marks of decent expensiveness, in addition to what goes\r\nto give them efficiency for the material use which they are to serve.\r\nThis habit of making obvious costliness a canon of serviceability of\r\ncourse acts to enhance the aggregate cost of articles of consumption.\r\nIt puts us on our guard against cheapness by identifying merit in some\r\ndegree with cost. There is ordinarily a consistent effort on the part\r\nof the consumer to obtain goods of the required serviceability at as\r\nadvantageous a bargain as may be; but the conventional requirement of\r\nobvious costliness, as a voucher and a constituent of the serviceability\r\nof the goods, leads him to reject as under grade such goods as do not\r\ncontain a large element of conspicuous waste.\r\n\r\nIt is to be added that a large share of those features of consumable\r\ngoods which figure in popular apprehension as marks of serviceability,\r\nand to which reference is here had as elements of conspicuous waste,\r\ncommend themselves to the consumer also on other grounds than that of\r\nexpensiveness alone. They usually give evidence of skill and effective\r\nworkmanship, even if they do not contribute to the substantial\r\nserviceability of the goods; and it is no doubt largely on some such\r\nground that any particular mark of honorific serviceability first comes\r\ninto vogue and afterward maintains its footing as a normal constituent\r\nelement of the worth of an article. A display of efficient workmanship\r\nis pleasing simply as such, even where its remoter, for the time\r\nunconsidered, outcome is futile. There is a gratification of the\r\nartistic sense in the contemplation of skillful work. But it is also to\r\nbe added that no such evidence of skillful workmanship, or of ingenious\r\nand effective adaptation of means to an end, will, in the long run,\r\nenjoy the approbation of the modern civilized consumer unless it has the\r\nsanction of the Canon of conspicuous waste.\r\n\r\nThe position here taken is enforced in a felicitous manner by the place\r\nassigned in the economy of consumption to machine products. The point\r\nof material difference between machine-made goods and the hand-wrought\r\ngoods which serve the same purposes is, ordinarily, that the former\r\nserve their primary purpose more adequately. They are a more perfect\r\nproduct--show a more perfect adaptation of means to end. This does not\r\nsave them from disesteem and deprecation, for they fall short under\r\nthe test of honorific waste. Hand labor is a more wasteful method\r\nof production; hence the goods turned out by this method are more\r\nserviceable for the purpose of pecuniary reputability; hence the marks\r\nof hand labor come to be honorific, and the goods which exhibit these\r\nmarks take rank as of higher grade than the corresponding machine\r\nproduct. Commonly, if not invariably, the honorific marks of hand\r\nlabor are certain imperfections and irregularities in the lines of the\r\nhand-wrought article, showing where the workman has fallen short in the\r\nexecution of the design. The ground of the superiority of hand-wrought\r\ngoods, therefore, is a certain margin of crudeness. This margin must\r\nnever be so wide as to show bungling workmanship, since that would be\r\nevidence of low cost, nor so narrow as to suggest the ideal precision\r\nattained only by the machine, for that would be evidence of low cost.\r\n\r\nThe appreciation of those evidences of honorific crudeness to which\r\nhand-wrought goods owe their superior worth and charm in the eyes\r\nof well-bred people is a matter of nice discrimination. It requires\r\ntraining and the formation of right habits of thought with respect to\r\nwhat may be called the physiognomy of goods. Machine-made goods of\r\ndaily use are often admired and preferred precisely on account of their\r\nexcessive perfection by the vulgar and the underbred who have not given\r\ndue thought to the punctilios of elegant consumption. The ceremonial\r\ninferiority of machine products goes to show that the perfection of\r\nskill and workmanship embodied in any costly innovations in the finish\r\nof goods is not sufficient of itself to secure them acceptance and\r\npermanent favor. The innovation must have the support of the canon of\r\nconspicuous waste. Any feature in the physiognomy of goods, however\r\npleasing in itself, and however well it may approve itself to the taste\r\nfor effective work, will not be tolerated if it proves obnoxious to this\r\nnorm of pecuniary reputability.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial inferiority or uncleanness in consumable goods due to\r\n"commonness," or in other words to their slight cost of production,\r\nhas been taken very seriously by many persons. The objection to machine\r\nproducts is often formulated as an objection to the commonness of such\r\ngoods. What is common is within the (pecuniary) reach of many people.\r\nIts consumption is therefore not honorific, since it does not serve the\r\npurpose of a favorable invidious comparison with other consumers. Hence\r\nthe consumption, or even the sight of such goods, is inseparable from an\r\nodious suggestion of the lower levels of human life, and one comes away\r\nfrom their contemplation with a pervading sense of meanness that is\r\nextremely distasteful and depressing to a person of sensibility. In\r\npersons whose tastes assert themselves imperiously, and who have not the\r\ngift, habit, or incentive to discriminate between the grounds of\r\ntheir various judgments of taste, the deliverances of the sense of the\r\nhonorific coalesce with those of the sense of beauty and of the sense of\r\nserviceability--in the manner already spoken of; the resulting\r\ncomposite valuation serves as a judgment of the object\'s beauty or its\r\nserviceability, according as the valuer\'s bias or interest inclines him\r\nto apprehend the object in the one or the other of these aspects. It\r\nfollows not infrequently that the marks of cheapness or commonness\r\nare accepted as definitive marks of artistic unfitness, and a code or\r\nschedule of aesthetic proprieties on the one hand, and of aesthetic\r\nabominations on the other, is constructed on this basis for guidance in\r\nquestions of taste.\r\n\r\nAs has already been pointed out, the cheap, and therefore indecorous,\r\narticles of daily consumption in modern industrial communities are\r\ncommonly machine products; and the generic feature of the physiognomy\r\nof machine-made goods as compared with the hand-wrought article is their\r\ngreater perfection in workmanship and greater accuracy in the detail\r\nexecution of the design. Hence it comes about that the visible\r\nimperfections of the hand-wrought goods, being honorific, are accounted\r\nmarks of superiority in point of beauty, or serviceability, or both.\r\nHence has arisen that exaltation of the defective, of which John Ruskin\r\nand William Morris were such eager spokesmen in their time; and on this\r\nground their propaganda of crudity and wasted effort has been taken up\r\nand carried forward since their time. And hence also the propaganda for\r\na return to handicraft and household industry. So much of the work\r\nand speculations of this group of men as fairly comes under the\r\ncharacterization here given would have been impossible at a time when\r\nthe visibly more perfect goods were not the cheaper.\r\n\r\nIt is of course only as to the economic value of this school of\r\naesthetic teaching that anything is intended to be said or can be said\r\nhere. What is said is not to be taken in the sense of depreciation, but\r\nchiefly as a characterization of the tendency of this teaching in its\r\neffect on consumption and on the production of consumable goods.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the bias of this growth of taste has worked itself\r\nout in production is perhaps most cogently exemplified in the book\r\nmanufacture with which Morris busied himself during the later years of\r\nhis life; but what holds true of the work of the Kelmscott Press in an\r\neminent degree, holds true with but slightly abated force when applied\r\nto latter-day artistic book-making generally--as to type, paper,\r\nillustration, binding materials, and binder\'s work. The claims to\r\nexcellence put forward by the later products of the bookmaker\'s industry\r\nrest in some measure on the degree of its approximation to the crudities\r\nof the time when the work of book-making was a doubtful struggle with\r\nrefractory materials carried on by means of insufficient appliances.\r\nThese products, since they require hand labor, are more expensive; they\r\nare also less convenient for use than the books turned out with a view\r\nto serviceability alone; they therefore argue ability on the part of\r\nthe purchaser to consume freely, as well as ability to waste time and\r\neffort. It is on this basis that the printers of today are returning to\r\n"old-style," and other more or less obsolete styles of type which are\r\nless legible and give a cruder appearance to the page than the "modern."\r\nEven a scientific periodical, with ostensibly no purpose but the most\r\neffective presentation of matter with which its science is concerned,\r\nwill concede so much to the demands of this pecuniary beauty as to\r\npublish its scientific discussions in oldstyle type, on laid paper, and\r\nwith uncut edges. But books which are not ostensibly concerned with the\r\neffective presentation of their contents alone, of course go farther\r\nin this direction. Here we have a somewhat cruder type, printed on\r\nhand-laid, deckel-edged paper, with excessive margins and uncut leaves,\r\nwith bindings of a painstaking crudeness and elaborate ineptitude. The\r\nKelmscott Press reduced the matter to an absurdity--as seen from the\r\npoint of view of brute serviceability alone--by issuing books for modern\r\nuse, edited with the obsolete spelling, printed in black-letter, and\r\nbound in limp vellum fitted with thongs. As a further characteristic\r\nfeature which fixes the economic place of artistic book-making, there\r\nis the fact that these more elegant books are, at their best, printed in\r\nlimited editions. A limited edition is in effect a guarantee--somewhat\r\ncrude, it is true--that this book is scarce and that it therefore is\r\ncostly and lends pecuniary distinction to its consumer.\r\n\r\nThe special attractiveness of these book-products to the book-buyer of\r\ncultivated taste lies, of course, not in a conscious, naive recognition\r\nof their costliness and superior clumsiness. Here, as in the parallel\r\ncase of the superiority of hand-wrought articles over machine products,\r\nthe conscious ground of preference is an intrinsic excellence imputed to\r\nthe costlier and more awkward article. The superior excellence imputed\r\nto the book which imitates the products of antique and obsolete\r\nprocesses is conceived to be chiefly a superior utility in the aesthetic\r\nrespect; but it is not unusual to find a well-bred book-lover insisting\r\nthat the clumsier product is also more serviceable as a vehicle of\r\nprinted speech. So far as regards the superior aesthetic value of the\r\ndecadent book, the chances are that the book-lover\'s contention has some\r\nground. The book is designed with an eye single to its beauty, and the\r\nresult is commonly some measure of success on the part of the designer.\r\nWhat is insisted on here, however, is that the canon of taste under\r\nwhich the designer works is a canon formed under the surveillance of\r\nthe law of conspicuous waste, and that this law acts selectively to\r\neliminate any canon of taste that does not conform to its demands. That\r\nis to say, while the decadent book may be beautiful, the limits within\r\nwhich the designer may work are fixed by requirements of a non-aesthetic\r\nkind. The product, if it is beautiful, must also at the same time be\r\ncostly and ill adapted to its ostensible use. This mandatory canon of\r\ntaste in the case of the book-designer, however, is not shaped entirely\r\nby the law of waste in its first form; the canon is to some extent\r\nshaped in conformity to that secondary expression of the predatory\r\ntemperament, veneration for the archaic or obsolete, which in one of its\r\nspecial developments is called classicism. In aesthetic theory it might\r\nbe extremely difficult, if not quite impracticable, to draw a line\r\nbetween the canon of classicism, or regard for the archaic, and the\r\ncanon of beauty. For the aesthetic purpose such a distinction need\r\nscarcely be drawn, and indeed it need not exist. For a theory of taste\r\nthe expression of an accepted ideal of archaism, on whatever basis it\r\nmay have been accepted, is perhaps best rated as an element of beauty;\r\nthere need be no question of its legitimation. But for the present\r\npurpose--for the purpose of determining what economic grounds are\r\npresent in the accepted canons of taste and what is their significance\r\nfor the distribution and consumption of goods--the distinction is not\r\nsimilarly beside the point. The position of machine products in the\r\ncivilized scheme of consumption serves to point out the nature of the\r\nrelation which subsists between the canon of conspicuous waste and the\r\ncode of proprieties in consumption. Neither in matters of art and taste\r\nproper, nor as regards the current sense of the serviceability of goods,\r\ndoes this canon act as a principle of innovation or initiative. It does\r\nnot go into the future as a creative principle which makes innovations\r\nand adds new items of consumption and new elements of cost. The\r\nprinciple in question is, in a certain sense, a negative rather than a\r\npositive law. It is a regulative rather than a creative principle. It\r\nvery rarely initiates or originates any usage or custom directly. Its\r\naction is selective only. Conspicuous wastefulness does not directly\r\nafford ground for variation and growth, but conformity to its\r\nrequirements is a condition to the survival of such innovations as may\r\nbe made on other grounds. In whatever way usages and customs and methods\r\nof expenditure arise, they are all subject to the selective action of\r\nthis norm of reputability; and the degree in which they conform to its\r\nrequirements is a test of their fitness to survive in the competition\r\nwith other similar usages and customs. Other thing being equal, the more\r\nobviously wasteful usage or method stands the better chance of survival\r\nunder this law. The law of conspicuous waste does not account for the\r\norigin of variations, but only for the persistence of such forms as are\r\nfit to survive under its dominance. It acts to conserve the fit, not to\r\noriginate the acceptable. Its office is to prove all things and to hold\r\nfast that which is good for its purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Seven ~~ Dress as an Expression of the Pecuniary Culture\r\n\r\nIt will in place, by way of illustration, to show in some detail how the\r\neconomic principles so far set forth apply to everyday facts in some one\r\ndirection of the life process. For this purpose no line of consumption\r\naffords a more apt illustration than expenditure on dress. It is\r\nespecially the rule of the conspicuous waste of goods that finds\r\nexpression in dress, although the other, related principles of pecuniary\r\nrepute are also exemplified in the same contrivances. Other methods\r\nof putting one\'s pecuniary standing in evidence serve their end\r\neffectually, and other methods are in vogue always and everywhere; but\r\nexpenditure on dress has this advantage over most other methods, that\r\nour apparel is always in evidence and affords an indication of our\r\npecuniary standing to all observers at the first glance. It is also true\r\nthat admitted expenditure for display is more obviously present, and is,\r\nperhaps, more universally practiced in the matter of dress than in any\r\nother line of consumption. No one finds difficulty in assenting to the\r\ncommonplace that the greater part of the expenditure incurred by all\r\nclasses for apparel is incurred for the sake of a respectable appearance\r\nrather than for the protection of the person. And probably at no other\r\npoint is the sense of shabbiness so keenly felt as it is if we fall\r\nshort of the standard set by social usage in this matter of dress. It\r\nis true of dress in even a higher degree than of most other items of\r\nconsumption, that people will undergo a very considerable degree of\r\nprivation in the comforts or the necessaries of life in order to afford\r\nwhat is considered a decent amount of wasteful consumption; so that\r\nit is by no means an uncommon occurrence, in an inclement climate,\r\nfor people to go ill clad in order to appear well dressed. And the\r\ncommercial value of the goods used for clotting in any modern community\r\nis made up to a much larger extent of the fashionableness, the\r\nreputability of the goods than of the mechanical service which they\r\nrender in clothing the person of the wearer. The need of dress is\r\neminently a "higher" or spiritual need.\r\n\r\nThis spiritual need of dress is not wholly, nor even chiefly, a naive\r\npropensity for display of expenditure. The law of conspicuous waste\r\nguides consumption in apparel, as in other things, chiefly at the second\r\nremove, by shaping the canons of taste and decency. In the common run of\r\ncases the conscious motive of the wearer or purchaser of conspicuously\r\nwasteful apparel is the need of conforming to established usage, and of\r\nliving up to the accredited standard of taste and reputability. It is\r\nnot only that one must be guided by the code of proprieties in dress in\r\norder to avoid the mortification that comes of unfavorable notice and\r\ncomment, though that motive in itself counts for a great deal; but\r\nbesides that, the requirement of expensiveness is so ingrained into\r\nour habits of thought in matters of dress that any other than expensive\r\napparel is instinctively odious to us. Without reflection or analysis,\r\nwe feel that what is inexpensive is unworthy. "A cheap coat makes a\r\ncheap man." "Cheap and nasty" is recognized to hold true in dress with\r\neven less mitigation than in other lines of consumption. On the ground\r\nboth of taste and of serviceability, an inexpensive article of apparel\r\nis held to be inferior, under the maxim "cheap and nasty." We find\r\nthings beautiful, as well as serviceable, somewhat in proportion as\r\nthey are costly. With few and inconsequential exceptions, we all find\r\na costly hand-wrought article of apparel much preferable, in point\r\nof beauty and of serviceability, to a less expensive imitation of it,\r\nhowever cleverly the spurious article may imitate the costly original;\r\nand what offends our sensibilities in the spurious article is not that\r\nit falls short in form or color, or, indeed, in visual effect in any\r\nway. The offensive object may be so close an imitation as to defy\r\nany but the closest scrutiny; and yet so soon as the counterfeit\r\nis detected, its aesthetic value, and its commercial value as well,\r\ndeclines precipitately. Not only that, but it may be asserted with\r\nbut small risk of contradiction that the aesthetic value of a detected\r\ncounterfeit in dress declines somewhat in the same proportion as the\r\ncounterfeit is cheaper than its original. It loses caste aesthetically\r\nbecause it falls to a lower pecuniary grade.\r\n\r\nBut the function of dress as an evidence of ability to pay does not end\r\nwith simply showing that the wearer consumes valuable goods in excess of\r\nwhat is required for physical comfort. Simple conspicuous waste of goods\r\nis effective and gratifying as far as it goes; it is good prima facie\r\nevidence of pecuniary success, and consequently prima facie evidence of\r\nsocial worth. But dress has subtler and more far-reaching possibilities\r\nthan this crude, first-hand evidence of wasteful consumption only. If,\r\nin addition to showing that the wearer can afford to consume freely and\r\nuneconomically, it can also be shown in the same stroke that he or she\r\nis not under the necessity of earning a livelihood, the evidence of\r\nsocial worth is enhanced in a very considerable degree. Our dress,\r\ntherefore, in order to serve its purpose effectually, should not only\r\nhe expensive, but it should also make plain to all observers that\r\nthe wearer is not engaged in any kind of productive labor. In the\r\nevolutionary process by which our system of dress has been elaborated\r\ninto its present admirably perfect adaptation to its purpose, this\r\nsubsidiary line of evidence has received due attention. A detailed\r\nexamination of what passes in popular apprehension for elegant apparel\r\nwill show that it is contrived at every point to convey the impression\r\nthat the wearer does not habitually put forth any useful effort. It\r\ngoes without saying that no apparel can be considered elegant, or\r\neven decent, if it shows the effect of manual labor on the part of the\r\nwearer, in the way of soil or wear. The pleasing effect of neat and\r\nspotless garments is chiefly, if not altogether, due to their carrying\r\nthe suggestion of leisure-exemption from personal contact with\r\nindustrial processes of any kind. Much of the charm that invests the\r\npatent-leather shoe, the stainless linen, the lustrous cylindrical hat,\r\nand the walking-stick, which so greatly enhance the native dignity of\r\na gentleman, comes of their pointedly suggesting that the wearer cannot\r\nwhen so attired bear a hand in any employment that is directly and\r\nimmediately of any human use. Elegant dress serves its purpose of\r\nelegance not only in that it is expensive, but also because it is\r\nthe insignia of leisure. It not only shows that the wearer is able to\r\nconsume a relatively large value, but it argues at the same time that he\r\nconsumes without producing.\r\n\r\nThe dress of women goes even farther than that of men in the way of\r\ndemonstrating the wearer\'s abstinence from productive employment. It\r\nneeds no argument to enforce the generalization that the more elegant\r\nstyles of feminine bonnets go even farther towards making work\r\nimpossible than does the man\'s high hat. The woman\'s shoe adds the\r\nso-called French heel to the evidence of enforced leisure afforded\r\nby its polish; because this high heel obviously makes any, even the\r\nsimplest and most necessary manual work extremely difficult. The like\r\nis true even in a higher degree of the skirt and the rest of the drapery\r\nwhich characterizes woman\'s dress. The substantial reason for our\r\ntenacious attachment to the skirt is just this; it is expensive and it\r\nhampers the wearer at every turn and incapacitates her for all useful\r\nexertion. The like is true of the feminine custom of wearing the hair\r\nexcessively long.\r\n\r\nBut the woman\'s apparel not only goes beyond that of the modern man\r\nin the degree in which it argues exemption from labor; it also adds a\r\npeculiar and highly characteristic feature which differs in kind from\r\nanything habitually practiced by the men. This feature is the class of\r\ncontrivances of which the corset is the typical example. The corset\r\nis, in economic theory, substantially a mutilation, undergone for the\r\npurpose of lowering the subject\'s vitality and rendering her permanently\r\nand obviously unfit for work. It is true, the corset impairs the\r\npersonal attractions of the wearer, but the loss suffered on that\r\nscore is offset by the gain in reputability which comes of her visibly\r\nincreased expensiveness and infirmity. It may broadly be set down\r\nthat the womanliness of woman\'s apparel resolves itself, in point of\r\nsubstantial fact, into the more effective hindrance to useful exertion\r\noffered by the garments peculiar to women. This difference between\r\nmasculine and feminine apparel is here simply pointed out as a\r\ncharacteristic feature. The ground of its occurrence will be discussed\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, we have, as the great and dominant norm of dress, the\r\nbroad principle of conspicuous waste. Subsidiary to this principle,\r\nand as a corollary under it, we get as a second norm the principle of\r\nconspicuous leisure. In dress construction this norm works out in the\r\nshape of divers contrivances going to show that the wearer does not and,\r\nas far as it may conveniently be shown, can not engage in productive\r\nlabor. Beyond these two principles there is a third of scarcely less\r\nconstraining force, which will occur to any one who reflects at all\r\non the subject. Dress must not only be conspicuously expensive and\r\ninconvenient, it must at the same time be up to date. No explanation at\r\nall satisfactory has hitherto been offered of the phenomenon of\r\nchanging fashions. The imperative requirement of dressing in the latest\r\naccredited manner, as well as the fact that this accredited fashion\r\nconstantly changes from season to season, is sufficiently familiar to\r\nevery one, but the theory of this flux and change has not been worked\r\nout. We may of course say, with perfect consistency and truthfulness,\r\nthat this principle of novelty is another corollary under the law of\r\nconspicuous waste. Obviously, if each garment is permitted to serve for\r\nbut a brief term, and if none of last season\'s apparel is carried\r\nover and made further use of during the present season, the wasteful\r\nexpenditure on dress is greatly increased. This is good as far as it\r\ngoes, but it is negative only. Pretty much all that this consideration\r\nwarrants us in saying is that the norm of conspicuous waste exercises a\r\ncontrolling surveillance in all matters of dress, so that any change in\r\nthe fashions must conspicuous waste exercises a controlling surveillance\r\nin all matters of dress, so that any change in the fashions must conform\r\nto the requirement of wastefulness; it leaves unanswered the question\r\nas to the motive for making and accepting a change in the prevailing\r\nstyles, and it also fails to explain why conformity to a given style at\r\na given time is so imperatively necessary as we know it to be.\r\n\r\nFor a creative principle, capable of serving as motive to invention\r\nand innovation in fashions, we shall have to go back to the primitive,\r\nnon-economic motive with which apparel originated--the motive of\r\nadornment. Without going into an extended discussion of how and why this\r\nmotive asserts itself under the guidance of the law of expensiveness, it\r\nmay be stated broadly that each successive innovation in the fashions is\r\nan effort to reach some form of display which shall be more acceptable\r\nto our sense of form and color or of effectiveness, than that which it\r\ndisplaces. The changing styles are the expression of a restless search\r\nfor something which shall commend itself to our aesthetic sense; but\r\nas each innovation is subject to the selective action of the norm of\r\nconspicuous waste, the range within which innovation can take place is\r\nsomewhat restricted. The innovation must not only be more beautiful,\r\nor perhaps oftener less offensive, than that which it displaces, but it\r\nmust also come up to the accepted standard of expensiveness.\r\n\r\nIt would seem at first sight that the result of such an unremitting\r\nstruggle to attain the beautiful in dress should be a gradual approach\r\nto artistic perfection. We might naturally expect that the fashions\r\nshould show a well-marked trend in the direction of some one or more\r\ntypes of apparel eminently becoming to the human form; and we might even\r\nfeel that we have substantial ground for the hope that today, after\r\nall the ingenuity and effort which have been spent on dress these many\r\nyears, the fashions should have achieved a relative perfection and\r\na relative stability, closely approximating to a permanently tenable\r\nartistic ideal. But such is not the case. It would be very hazardous\r\nindeed to assert that the styles of today are intrinsically more\r\nbecoming than those of ten years ago, or than those of twenty, or fifty,\r\nor one hundred years ago. On the other hand, the assertion freely goes\r\nuncontradicted that styles in vogue two thousand years ago are more\r\nbecoming than the most elaborate and painstaking constructions of today.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the fashions just offered, then, does not fully\r\nexplain, and we shall have to look farther. It is well known that\r\ncertain relatively stable styles and types of costume have been worked\r\nout in various parts of the world; as, for instance, among the Japanese,\r\nChinese, and other Oriental nations; likewise among the Greeks, Romans,\r\nand other Eastern peoples of antiquity so also, in later times, among\r\nthe peasants of nearly every country of Europe. These national or\r\npopular costumes are in most cases adjudged by competent critics to\r\nbe more becoming, more artistic, than the fluctuating styles of modern\r\ncivilized apparel. At the same time they are also, at least usually,\r\nless obviously wasteful; that is to say, other elements than that of a\r\ndisplay of expense are more readily detected in their structure.\r\n\r\nThese relatively stable costumes are, commonly, pretty strictly and\r\nnarrowly localized, and they vary by slight and systematic gradations\r\nfrom place to place. They have in every case been worked out by peoples\r\nor classes which are poorer than we, and especially they belong in\r\ncountries and localities and times where the population, or at least\r\nthe class to which the costume in question belongs, is relatively\r\nhomogeneous, stable, and immobile. That is to say, stable costumes\r\nwhich will bear the test of time and perspective are worked out under\r\ncircumstances where the norm of conspicuous waste asserts itself less\r\nimperatively than it does in the large modern civilized cities, whose\r\nrelatively mobile wealthy population today sets the pace in matters of\r\nfashion. The countries and classes which have in this way worked out\r\nstable and artistic costumes have been so placed that the pecuniary\r\nemulation among them has taken the direction of a competition in\r\nconspicuous leisure rather than in conspicuous consumption of goods. So\r\nthat it will hold true in a general way that fashions are least stable\r\nand least becoming in those communities where the principle of a\r\nconspicuous waste of goods asserts itself most imperatively, as among\r\nourselves. All this points to an antagonism between expensiveness and\r\nartistic apparel. In point of practical fact, the norm of conspicuous\r\nwaste is incompatible with the requirement that dress should be\r\nbeautiful or becoming. And this antagonism offers an explanation of that\r\nrestless change in fashion which neither the canon of expensiveness nor\r\nthat of beauty alone can account for.\r\n\r\nThe standard of reputability requires that dress should show wasteful\r\nexpenditure; but all wastefulness is offensive to native taste. The\r\npsychological law has already been pointed out that all men--and women\r\nperhaps even in a higher degree abhor futility, whether of effort or\r\nof expenditure--much as Nature was once said to abhor a vacuum. But the\r\nprinciple of conspicuous waste requires an obviously futile expenditure;\r\nand the resulting conspicuous expensiveness of dress is therefore\r\nintrinsically ugly. Hence we find that in all innovations in dress, each\r\nadded or altered detail strives to avoid condemnation by showing some\r\nostensible purpose, at the same time that the requirement of conspicuous\r\nwaste prevents the purposefulness of these innovations from becoming\r\nanything more than a somewhat transparent pretense. Even in its freest\r\nflights, fashion rarely if ever gets away from a simulation of some\r\nostensible use. The ostensible usefulness of the fashionable details\r\nof dress, however, is always so transparent a make-believe, and\r\ntheir substantial futility presently forces itself so baldly upon our\r\nattention as to become unbearable, and then we take refuge in a new\r\nstyle. But the new style must conform to the requirement of reputable\r\nwastefulness and futility. Its futility presently becomes as odious\r\nas that of its predecessor; and the only remedy which the law of waste\r\nallows us is to seek relief in some new construction, equally futile and\r\nequally untenable. Hence the essential ugliness and the unceasing change\r\nof fashionable attire.\r\n\r\nHaving so explained the phenomenon of shifting fashions, the next\r\nthing is to make the explanation tally with everyday facts. Among these\r\neveryday facts is the well-known liking which all men have for the\r\nstyles that are in vogue at any given time. A new style comes into vogue\r\nand remains in favor for a season, and, at least so long as it is\r\na novelty, people very generally find the new style attractive. The\r\nprevailing fashion is felt to be beautiful. This is due partly to the\r\nrelief it affords in being different from what went before it, partly\r\nto its being reputable. As indicated in the last chapter, the canon\r\nof reputability to some extent shapes our tastes, so that under its\r\nguidance anything will be accepted as becoming until its novelty wears\r\noff, or until the warrant of reputability is transferred to a new and\r\nnovel structure serving the same general purpose. That the alleged\r\nbeauty, or "loveliness," of the styles in vogue at any given time is\r\ntransient and spurious only is attested by the fact that none of the\r\nmany shifting fashions will bear the test of time. When seen in the\r\nperspective of half-a-dozen years or more, the best of our fashions\r\nstrike us as grotesque, if not unsightly. Our transient attachment to\r\nwhatever happens to be the latest rests on other than aesthetic grounds,\r\nand lasts only until our abiding aesthetic sense has had time to assert\r\nitself and reject this latest indigestible contrivance.\r\n\r\nThe process of developing an aesthetic nausea takes more or less time;\r\nthe length of time required in any given case being inversely as the\r\ndegree of intrinsic odiousness of the style in question. This time\r\nrelation between odiousness and instability in fashions affords ground\r\nfor the inference that the more rapidly the styles succeed and\r\ndisplace one another, the more offensive they are to sound taste. The\r\npresumption, therefore, is that the farther the community, especially\r\nthe wealthy classes of the community, develop in wealth and mobility and\r\nin the range of their human contact, the more imperatively will the law\r\nof conspicuous waste assert itself in matters of dress, the more will\r\nthe sense of beauty tend to fall into abeyance or be overborne by the\r\ncanon of pecuniary reputability, the more rapidly will fashions shift\r\nand change, and the more grotesque and intolerable will be the varying\r\nstyles that successively come into vogue.\r\n\r\nThere remains at least one point in this theory of dress yet to be\r\ndiscussed. Most of what has been said applies to men\'s attire as well\r\nas to that of women; although in modern times it applies at nearly all\r\npoints with greater force to that of women. But at one point the dress\r\nof women differs substantially from that of men. In woman\'s dress there\r\nis obviously greater insistence on such features as testify to the\r\nwearer\'s exemption from or incapacity for all vulgarly productive\r\nemployment. This characteristic of woman\'s apparel is of interest, not\r\nonly as completing the theory of dress, but also as confirming what has\r\nalready been said of the economic status of women, both in the past and\r\nin the present.\r\n\r\nAs has been seen in the discussion of woman\'s status under the heads\r\nof Vicarious Leisure and Vicarious Consumption, it has in the course\r\nof economic development become the office of the woman to consume\r\nvicariously for the head of the household; and her apparel is contrived\r\nwith this object in view. It has come about that obviously productive\r\nlabor is in a peculiar degree derogatory to respectable women, and\r\ntherefore special pains should be taken in the construction of women\'s\r\ndress, to impress upon the beholder the fact (often indeed a fiction)\r\nthat the wearer does not and can not habitually engage in useful work.\r\nPropriety requires respectable women to abstain more consistently from\r\nuseful effort and to make more of a show of leisure than the men of the\r\nsame social classes. It grates painfully on our nerves to contemplate\r\nthe necessity of any well-bred woman\'s earning a livelihood by useful\r\nwork. It is not "woman\'s sphere." Her sphere is within the household,\r\nwhich she should "beautify," and of which she should be the "chief\r\nornament." The male head of the household is not currently spoken of as\r\nits ornament. This feature taken in conjunction with the other fact that\r\npropriety requires more unremitting attention to expensive display in\r\nthe dress and other paraphernalia of women, goes to enforce the view\r\nalready implied in what has gone before. By virtue of its descent from a\r\npatriarchal past, our social system makes it the woman\'s function in\r\nan especial degree to put in evidence her household\'s ability to pay.\r\nAccording to the modern civilized scheme of life, the good name of the\r\nhousehold to which she belongs should be the special care of the woman;\r\nand the system of honorific expenditure and conspicuous leisure by which\r\nthis good name is chiefly sustained is therefore the woman\'s sphere.\r\nIn the ideal scheme, as it tends to realize itself in the life of\r\nthe higher pecuniary classes, this attention to conspicuous waste of\r\nsubstance and effort should normally be the sole economic function of\r\nthe woman.\r\n\r\nAt the stage of economic development at which the women were still in\r\nthe full sense the property of the men, the performance of conspicuous\r\nleisure and consumption came to be part of the services required of\r\nthem. The women being not their own masters, obvious expenditure and\r\nleisure on their part would redound to the credit of their master rather\r\nthan to their own credit; and therefore the more expensive and the\r\nmore obviously unproductive the women of the household are, the more\r\ncreditable and more effective for the purpose of reputability of the\r\nhousehold or its head will their life be. So much so that the women have\r\nbeen required not only to afford evidence of a life of leisure, but even\r\nto disable themselves for useful activity.\r\n\r\nIt is at this point that the dress of men falls short of that of women,\r\nand for sufficient reason. Conspicuous waste and conspicuous leisure\r\nare reputable because they are evidence of pecuniary strength; pecuniary\r\nstrength is reputable or honorific because, in the last analysis, it\r\nargues success and superior force; therefore the evidence of waste\r\nand leisure put forth by any individual in his own behalf cannot\r\nconsistently take such a form or be carried to such a pitch as to argue\r\nincapacity or marked discomfort on his part; as the exhibition would in\r\nthat case show not superior force, but inferiority, and so defeat its\r\nown purpose. So, then, wherever wasteful expenditure and the show of\r\nabstention from effort is normally, or on an average, carried to the\r\nextent of showing obvious discomfort or voluntarily induced physical\r\ndisability. There the immediate inference is that the individual in\r\nquestion does not perform this wasteful expenditure and undergo this\r\ndisability for her own personal gain in pecuniary repute, but in\r\nbehalf of some one else to whom she stands in a relation of economic\r\ndependence; a relation which in the last analysis must, in economic\r\ntheory, reduce itself to a relation of servitude.\r\n\r\nTo apply this generalization to women\'s dress, and put the matter in\r\nconcrete terms: the high heel, the skirt, the impracticable bonnet, the\r\ncorset, and the general disregard of the wearer\'s comfort which is an\r\nobvious feature of all civilized women\'s apparel, are so many items of\r\nevidence to the effect that in the modern civilized scheme of life the\r\nwoman is still, in theory, the economic dependent of the man--that,\r\nperhaps in a highly idealized sense, she still is the man\'s chattel. The\r\nhomely reason for all this conspicuous leisure and attire on the part\r\nof women lies in the fact that they are servants to whom, in the\r\ndifferentiation of economic functions, has been delegated the office\r\nof putting in evidence their master\'s ability to pay. There is a marked\r\nsimilarity in these respects between the apparel of women and that of\r\ndomestic servants, especially liveried servants. In both there is a very\r\nelaborate show of unnecessary expensiveness, and in both cases there is\r\nalso a notable disregard of the physical comfort of the wearer. But\r\nthe attire of the lady goes farther in its elaborate insistence on the\r\nidleness, if not on the physical infirmity of the wearer, than does that\r\nof the domestic. And this is as it should be; for in theory, according\r\nto the ideal scheme of the pecuniary culture, the lady of the house is\r\nthe chief menial of the household.\r\n\r\nBesides servants, currently recognized as such, there is at least one\r\nother class of persons whose garb assimilates them to the class\r\nof servants and shows many of the features that go to make up the\r\nwomanliness of woman\'s dress. This is the priestly class. Priestly\r\nvestments show, in accentuated form, all the features that have been\r\nshown to be evidence of a servile status and a vicarious life. Even\r\nmore strikingly than the everyday habit of the priest, the vestments,\r\nproperly so called, are ornate, grotesque, inconvenient, and, at least\r\nostensibly, comfortless to the point of distress. The priest is at the\r\nsame time expected to refrain from useful effort and, when before the\r\npublic eye, to present an impassively disconsolate countenance, very\r\nmuch after the manner of a well-trained domestic servant. The\r\nshaven face of the priest is a further item to the same effect. This\r\nassimilation of the priestly class to the class of body servants, in\r\ndemeanor and apparel, is due to the similarity of the two classes as\r\nregards economic function. In economic theory, the priest is a body\r\nservant, constructively in attendance upon the person of the divinity\r\nwhose livery he wears. His livery is of a very expensive character, as\r\nit should be in order to set forth in a beseeming manner the dignity of\r\nhis exalted master; but it is contrived to show that the wearing of it\r\ncontributes little or nothing to the physical comfort of the wearer,\r\nfor it is an item of vicarious consumption, and the repute which accrues\r\nfrom its consumption is to be imputed to the absent master, not to the\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nThe line of demarcation between the dress of women, priests, and\r\nservants, on the one hand, and of men, on the other hand, is not always\r\nconsistently observed in practice, but it will scarcely be disputed\r\nthat it is always present in a more or less definite way in the popular\r\nhabits of thought. There are of course also free men, and not a few\r\nof them, who, in their blind zeal for faultless reputable attire,\r\ntransgress the theoretical line between man\'s and woman\'s dress, to the\r\nextent of arraying themselves in apparel that is obviously designed to\r\nvex the mortal frame; but everyone recognizes without hesitation that\r\nsuch apparel for men is a departure from the normal. We are in the habit\r\nof saying that such dress is "effeminate"; and one sometimes hears the\r\nremark that such or such an exquisitely attired gentleman is as well\r\ndressed as a footman.\r\n\r\nCertain apparent discrepancies under this theory of dress merit a more\r\ndetailed examination, especially as they mark a more or less evident\r\ntrend in the later and maturer development of dress. The vogue of the\r\ncorset offers an apparent exception from the rule of which it has here\r\nbeen cited as an illustration. A closer examination, however, will show\r\nthat this apparent exception is really a verification of the rule that\r\nthe vogue of any given element or feature in dress rests on its utility\r\nas an evidence of pecuniary standing. It is well known that in the\r\nindustrially more advanced communities the corset is employed only\r\nwithin certain fairly well defined social strata. The women of the\r\npoorer classes, especially of the rural population, do not habitually\r\nuse it, except as a holiday luxury. Among these classes the women have\r\nto work hard, and it avails them little in the way of a pretense of\r\nleisure to so crucify the flesh in everyday life. The holiday use of\r\nthe contrivance is due to imitation of a higher-class canon of decency.\r\nUpwards from this low level of indigence and manual labor, the corset\r\nwas until within a generation or two nearly indispensable to a socially\r\nblameless standing for all women, including the wealthiest and most\r\nreputable. This rule held so long as there still was no large class of\r\npeople wealthy enough to be above the imputation of any necessity\r\nfor manual labor and at the same time large enough to form a\r\nself-sufficient, isolated social body whose mass would afford a\r\nfoundation for special rules of conduct within the class, enforced by\r\nthe current opinion of the class alone. But now there has grown up a\r\nlarge enough leisure class possessed of such wealth that any aspersion\r\non the score of enforced manual employment would be idle and harmless\r\ncalumny; and the corset has therefore in large measure fallen into\r\ndisuse within this class. The exceptions under this rule of exemption\r\nfrom the corset are more apparent than real. They are the wealthy\r\nclasses of countries with a lower industrial structure--nearer the\r\narchaic, quasi-industrial type--together with the later accessions of\r\nthe wealthy classes in the more advanced industrial communities. The\r\nlatter have not yet had time to divest themselves of the plebeian canons\r\nof taste and of reputability carried over from their former, lower\r\npecuniary grade. Such survival of the corset is not infrequent among the\r\nhigher social classes of those American cities, for instance, which\r\nhave recently and rapidly risen into opulence. If the word be used as a\r\ntechnical term, without any odious implication, it may be said that the\r\ncorset persists in great measure through the period of snobbery--the\r\ninterval of uncertainty and of transition from a lower to the upper\r\nlevels of pecuniary culture. That is to say, in all countries which\r\nhave inherited the corset it continues in use wherever and so long as\r\nit serves its purpose as an evidence of honorific leisure by arguing\r\nphysical disability in the wearer. The same rule of course applies to\r\nother mutilations and contrivances for decreasing the visible efficiency\r\nof the individual.\r\n\r\nSomething similar should hold true with respect to divers items of\r\nconspicuous consumption, and indeed something of the kind does seem to\r\nhold to a slight degree of sundry features of dress, especially if such\r\nfeatures involve a marked discomfort or appearance of discomfort to\r\nthe wearer. During the past one hundred years there is a tendency\r\nperceptible, in the development of men\'s dress especially, to\r\ndiscontinue methods of expenditure and the use of symbols of leisure\r\nwhich must have been irksome, which may have served a good purpose in\r\ntheir time, but the continuation of which among the upper classes today\r\nwould be a work of supererogation; as, for instance, the use of powdered\r\nwigs and of gold lace, and the practice of constantly shaving the face.\r\nThere has of late years been some slight recrudescence of the shaven\r\nface in polite society, but this is probably a transient and unadvised\r\nmimicry of the fashion imposed upon body servants, and it may fairly be\r\nexpected to go the way of the powdered wig of our grandfathers.\r\n\r\nThese indices and others which resemble them in point of the boldness\r\nwith which they point out to all observers the habitual uselessness\r\nof those persons who employ them, have been replaced by other, more\r\ndedicate methods of expressing the same fact; methods which are no less\r\nevident to the trained eyes of that smaller, select circle whose\r\ngood opinion is chiefly sought. The earlier and cruder method of\r\nadvertisement held its ground so long as the public to which the\r\nexhibitor had to appeal comprised large portions of the community who\r\nwere not trained to detect delicate variations in the evidences of\r\nwealth and leisure. The method of advertisement undergoes a refinement\r\nwhen a sufficiently large wealthy class has developed, who have the\r\nleisure for acquiring skill in interpreting the subtler signs of\r\nexpenditure. "Loud" dress becomes offensive to people of taste,\r\nas evincing an undue desire to reach and impress the untrained\r\nsensibilities of the vulgar. To the individual of high breeding, it is\r\nonly the more honorific esteem accorded by the cultivated sense of the\r\nmembers of his own high class that is of material consequence. Since\r\nthe wealthy leisure class has grown so large, or the contact of the\r\nleisure-class individual with members of his own class has grown so\r\nwide, as to constitute a human environment sufficient for the honorific\r\npurpose, there arises a tendency to exclude the baser elements of\r\nthe population from the scheme even as spectators whose applause or\r\nmortification should be sought. The result of all this is a refinement\r\nof methods, a resort to subtler contrivances, and a spiritualization of\r\nthe scheme of symbolism in dress. And as this upper leisure class sets\r\nthe pace in all matters of decency, the result for the rest of society\r\nalso is a gradual amelioration of the scheme of dress. As the community\r\nadvances in wealth and culture, the ability to pay is put in evidence\r\nby means which require a progressively nicer discrimination in the\r\nbeholder. This nicer discrimination between advertising media is in fact\r\na very large element of the higher pecuniary culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Eight ~~ Industrial Exemption and Conservatism\r\n\r\nThe life of man in society, just like the life of other species, is\r\na struggle for existence, and therefore it is a process of selective\r\nadaptation. The evolution of social structure has been a process of\r\nnatural selection of institutions. The progress which has been and is\r\nbeing made in human institutions and in human character may be set down,\r\nbroadly, to a natural selection of the fittest habits of thought and to\r\na process of enforced adaptation of individuals to an environment which\r\nhas progressively changed with the growth of the community and with the\r\nchanging institutions under which men have lived. Institutions are not\r\nonly themselves the result of a selective and adaptive process which\r\nshapes the prevailing or dominant types of spiritual attitude and\r\naptitudes; they are at the same time special methods of life and of\r\nhuman relations, and are therefore in their turn efficient factors of\r\nselection. So that the changing institutions in their turn make for a\r\nfurther selection of individuals endowed with the fittest temperament,\r\nand a further adaptation of individual temperament and habits to the\r\nchanging environment through the formation of new institutions.\r\n\r\nThe forces which have shaped the development of human life and of social\r\nstructure are no doubt ultimately reducible to terms of living tissue\r\nand material environment; but proximately for the purpose in hand, these\r\nforces may best be stated in terms of an environment, partly human,\r\npartly non-human, and a human subject with a more or less definite\r\nphysical and intellectual constitution. Taken in the aggregate or\r\naverage, this human subject is more or less variable; chiefly, no doubt,\r\nunder a rule of selective conservation of favorable variations.\r\nThe selection of favorable variations is perhaps in great measure a\r\nselective conservation of ethnic types. In the life history of any\r\ncommunity whose population is made up of a mixture of divers ethnic\r\nelements, one or another of several persistent and relatively stable\r\ntypes of body and of temperament rises into dominance at any given\r\npoint. The situation, including the institutions in force at any given\r\ntime, will favor the survival and dominance of one type of character in\r\npreference to another; and the type of man so selected to continue and\r\nto further elaborate the institutions handed down from the past will in\r\nsome considerable measure shape these institutions in his own likeness.\r\nBut apart from selection as between relatively stable types of character\r\nand habits of mind, there is no doubt simultaneously going on a process\r\nof selective adaptation of habits of thought within the general range of\r\naptitudes which is characteristic of the dominant ethnic type or types.\r\nThere may be a variation in the fundamental character of any population\r\nby selection between relatively stable types; but there is also a\r\nvariation due to adaptation in detail within the range of the type, and\r\nto selection between specific habitual views regarding any given social\r\nrelation or group of relations.\r\n\r\nFor the present purpose, however, the question as to the nature of the\r\nadaptive process--whether it is chiefly a selection between stable types\r\nof temperament and character, or chiefly an adaptation of men\'s habits\r\nof thought to changing circumstances--is of less importance than the\r\nfact that, by one method or another, institutions change and develop.\r\nInstitutions must change with changing circumstances, since they are\r\nof the nature of an habitual method of responding to the stimuli\r\nwhich these changing circumstances afford. The development of these\r\ninstitutions is the development of society. The institutions are,\r\nin substance, prevalent habits of thought with respect to particular\r\nrelations and particular functions of the individual and of the\r\ncommunity; and the scheme of life, which is made up of the aggregate\r\nof institutions in force at a given time or at a given point in the\r\ndevelopment of any society, may, on the psychological side, be broadly\r\ncharacterized as a prevalent spiritual attitude or a prevalent theory of\r\nlife. As regards its generic features, this spiritual attitude or theory\r\nof life is in the last analysis reducible to terms of a prevalent type\r\nof character.\r\n\r\nThe situation of today shapes the institutions of tomorrow through\r\na selective, coercive process, by acting upon men\'s habitual view\r\nof things, and so altering or fortifying a point of view or a mental\r\nattitude handed down from the past. The institutions--that is to say the\r\nhabits of thought--under the guidance of which men live are in this way\r\nreceived from an earlier time; more or less remotely earlier, but in\r\nany event they have been elaborated in and received from the past.\r\nInstitutions are products of the past process, are adapted to past\r\ncircumstances, and are therefore never in full accord with the\r\nrequirements of the present. In the nature of the case, this process of\r\nselective adaptation can never catch up with the progressively changing\r\nsituation in which the community finds itself at any given time; for\r\nthe environment, the situation, the exigencies of life which enforce the\r\nadaptation and exercise the selection, change from day to day; and each\r\nsuccessive situation of the community in its turn tends to obsolescence\r\nas soon as it has been established. When a step in the development has\r\nbeen taken, this step itself constitutes a change of situation which\r\nrequires a new adaptation; it becomes the point of departure for a new\r\nstep in the adjustment, and so on interminably.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted then, although it may be a tedious truism, that the\r\ninstitutions of today--the present accepted scheme of life--do not\r\nentirely fit the situation of today. At the same time, men\'s present\r\nhabits of thought tend to persist indefinitely, except as circumstances\r\nenforce a change. These institutions which have thus been handed down,\r\nthese habits of thought, points of view, mental attitudes and aptitudes,\r\nor what not, are therefore themselves a conservative factor. This is the\r\nfactor of social inertia, psychological inertia, conservatism. Social\r\nstructure changes, develops, adapts itself to an altered situation, only\r\nthrough a change in the habits of thought of the several classes of the\r\ncommunity, or in the last analysis, through a change in the habits of\r\nthought of the individuals which make up the community. The evolution of\r\nsociety is substantially a process of mental adaptation on the part\r\nof individuals under the stress of circumstances which will no longer\r\ntolerate habits of thought formed under and conforming to a different\r\nset of circumstances in the past. For the immediate purpose it need not\r\nbe a question of serious importance whether this adaptive process is\r\na process of selection and survival of persistent ethnic types or a\r\nprocess of individual adaptation and an inheritance of acquired traits.\r\n\r\nSocial advance, especially as seen from the point of view of economic\r\ntheory, consists in a continued progressive approach to an approximately\r\nexact "adjustment of inner relations to outer relations", but this\r\nadjustment is never definitively established, since the "outer\r\nrelations" are subject to constant change as a consequence of the\r\nprogressive change going on in the "inner relations." But the degree\r\nof approximation may be greater or less, depending on the facility with\r\nwhich an adjustment is made. A readjustment of men\'s habits of thought\r\nto conform with the exigencies of an altered situation is in any case\r\nmade only tardily and reluctantly, and only under the coercion exercised\r\nby a stipulation which has made the accredited views untenable.\r\nThe readjustment of institutions and habitual views to an altered\r\nenvironment is made in response to pressure from without; it is of the\r\nnature of a response to stimulus. Freedom and facility of readjustment,\r\nthat is to say capacity for growth in social structure, therefore\r\ndepends in great measure on the degree of freedom with which the\r\nsituation at any given time acts on the individual members of the\r\ncommunity-the degree of exposure of the individual members to the\r\nconstraining forces of the environment. If any portion or class of\r\nsociety is sheltered from the action of the environment in any essential\r\nrespect, that portion of the community, or that class, will adapt\r\nits views and its scheme of life more tardily to the altered general\r\nsituation; it will in so far tend to retard the process of social\r\ntransformation. The wealthy leisure class is in such a sheltered\r\nposition with respect to the economic forces that make for change\r\nand readjustment. And it may be said that the forces which make for\r\na readjustment of institutions, especially in the case of a modern\r\nindustrial community, are, in the last analysis, almost entirely of an\r\neconomic nature.\r\n\r\nAny community may be viewed as an industrial or economic mechanism,\r\nthe structure of which is made up of what is called its economic\r\ninstitutions. These institutions are habitual methods of carrying on the\r\nlife process of the community in contact with the material environment\r\nin which it lives. When given methods of unfolding human activity in\r\nthis given environment have been elaborated in this way, the life of\r\nthe community will express itself with some facility in these habitual\r\ndirections. The community will make use of the forces of the environment\r\nfor the purposes of its life according to methods learned in the past\r\nand embodied in these institutions. But as population increases, and as\r\nmen\'s knowledge and skill in directing the forces of nature widen, the\r\nhabitual methods of relation between the members of the group, and the\r\nhabitual method of carrying on the life process of the group as a\r\nwhole, no longer give the same result as before; nor are the resulting\r\nconditions of life distributed and apportioned in the same manner or\r\nwith the same effect among the various members as before. If the scheme\r\naccording to which the life process of the group was carried on under\r\nthe earlier conditions gave approximately the highest attainable\r\nresult--under the circumstances--in the way of efficiency or facility\r\nof the life process of the group; then the same scheme of life unaltered\r\nwill not yield the highest result attainable in this respect under the\r\naltered conditions. Under the altered conditions of population, skill,\r\nand knowledge, the facility of life as carried on according to the\r\ntraditional scheme may not be lower than under the earlier conditions;\r\nbut the chances are always that it is less than might be if the scheme\r\nwere altered to suit the altered conditions.\r\n\r\nThe group is made up of individuals, and the group\'s life is the life\r\nof individuals carried on in at least ostensible severalty. The group\'s\r\naccepted scheme of life is the consensus of views held by the body of\r\nthese individuals as to what is right, good, expedient, and beautiful in\r\nthe way of human life. In the redistribution of the conditions of life\r\nthat comes of the altered method of dealing with the environment, the\r\noutcome is not an equable change in the facility of life throughout the\r\ngroup. The altered conditions may increase the facility of life for\r\nthe group as a whole, but the redistribution will usually result in a\r\ndecrease of facility or fullness of life for some members of the\r\ngroup. An advance in technical methods, in population, or in industrial\r\norganization will require at least some of the members of the community\r\nto change their habits of life, if they are to enter with facility and\r\neffect into the altered industrial methods; and in doing so they will be\r\nunable to live up to the received notions as to what are the right and\r\nbeautiful habits of life.\r\n\r\nAny one who is required to change his habits of life and his habitual\r\nrelations to his fellow men will feel the discrepancy between the\r\nmethod of life required of him by the newly arisen exigencies, and\r\nthe traditional scheme of life to which he is accustomed. It is the\r\nindividuals placed in this position who have the liveliest incentive to\r\nreconstruct the received scheme of life and are most readily persuaded\r\nto accept new standards; and it is through the need of the means of\r\nlivelihood that men are placed in such a position. The pressure exerted\r\nby the environment upon the group, and making for a readjustment of the\r\ngroup\'s scheme of life, impinges upon the members of the group in\r\nthe form of pecuniary exigencies; and it is owing to this fact--that\r\nexternal forces are in great part translated into the form of pecuniary\r\nor economic exigencies--it is owing to this fact that we can say that\r\nthe forces which count toward a readjustment of institutions in any\r\nmodern industrial community are chiefly economic forces; or more\r\nspecifically, these forces take the form of pecuniary pressure. Such a\r\nreadjustment as is here contemplated is substantially a change in men\'s\r\nviews as to what is good and right, and the means through which a change\r\nis wrought in men\'s apprehension of what is good and right is in large\r\npart the pressure of pecuniary exigencies.\r\n\r\nAny change in men\'s views as to what is good and right in human life\r\nmake its way but tardily at the best. Especially is this true of any\r\nchange in the direction of what is called progress; that is to say, in\r\nthe direction of divergence from the archaic position--from the position\r\nwhich may be accounted the point of departure at any step in the social\r\nevolution of the community. Retrogression, reapproach to a standpoint to\r\nwhich the race has been long habituated in the past, is easier. This is\r\nespecially true in case the development away from this past standpoint\r\nhas not been due chiefly to a substitution of an ethnic type whose\r\ntemperament is alien to the earlier standpoint. The cultural stage which\r\nlies immediately back of the present in the life history of Western\r\ncivilization is what has here been called the quasi-peaceable stage. At\r\nthis quasi-peaceable stage the law of status is the dominant feature in\r\nthe scheme of life. There is no need of pointing out how prone the\r\nmen of today are to revert to the spiritual attitude of mastery and of\r\npersonal subservience which characterizes that stage. It may rather be\r\nsaid to be held in an uncertain abeyance by the economic exigencies of\r\ntoday, than to have been definitely supplanted by a habit of mind that\r\nis in full accord with these later-developed exigencies. The predatory\r\nand quasi-peaceable stages of economic evolution seem to have been of\r\nlong duration in life history of all the chief ethnic elements which go\r\nto make up the populations of the Western culture. The temperament\r\nand the propensities proper to those cultural stages have, therefore,\r\nattained such a persistence as to make a speedy reversion to the broad\r\nfeatures of the corresponding psychological constitution inevitable in\r\nthe case of any class or community which is removed from the action of\r\nthose forces that make for a maintenance of the later-developed habits\r\nof thought.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common notoriety that when individuals, or even\r\nconsiderable groups of men, are segregated from a higher industrial\r\nculture and exposed to a lower cultural environment, or to an economic\r\nsituation of a more primitive character, they quickly show evidence of\r\nreversion toward the spiritual features which characterize the predatory\r\ntype; and it seems probable that the dolicho-blond type of European man\r\nis possessed of a greater facility for such reversion to barbarism than\r\nthe other ethnic elements with which that type is associated in the\r\nWestern culture. Examples of such a reversion on a small scale abound in\r\nthe later history of migration and colonization. Except for the fear\r\nof offending that chauvinistic patriotism which is so characteristic\r\na feature of the predatory culture, and the presence of which is\r\nfrequently the most striking mark of reversion in modern communities,\r\nthe case of the American colonies might be cited as an example of such a\r\nreversion on an unusually large scale, though it was not a reversion of\r\nvery large scope.\r\n\r\nThe leisure class is in great measure sheltered from the stress of\r\nthose economic exigencies which prevail in any modern, highly organized\r\nindustrial community. The exigencies of the struggle for the means\r\nof life are less exacting for this class than for any other; and as a\r\nconsequence of this privileged position we should expect to find it one\r\nof the least responsive of the classes of society to the demands\r\nwhich the situation makes for a further growth of institutions and a\r\nreadjustment to an altered industrial situation. The leisure class is\r\nthe conservative class. The exigencies of the general economic situation\r\nof the community do not freely or directly impinge upon the members of\r\nthis class. They are not required under penalty of forfeiture to change\r\ntheir habits of life and their theoretical views of the external world\r\nto suit the demands of an altered industrial technique, since they\r\nare not in the full sense an organic part of the industrial community.\r\nTherefore these exigencies do not readily produce, in the members of\r\nthis class, that degree of uneasiness with the existing order which\r\nalone can lead any body of men to give up views and methods of life that\r\nhave become habitual to them. The office of the leisure class in social\r\nevolution is to retard the movement and to conserve what is obsolescent.\r\nThis proposition is by no means novel; it has long been one of the\r\ncommonplaces of popular opinion.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent conviction that the wealthy class is by nature\r\nconservative has been popularly accepted without much aid from any\r\ntheoretical view as to the place and relation of that class in the\r\ncultural development. When an explanation of this class conservatism is\r\noffered, it is commonly the invidious one that the wealthy class opposes\r\ninnovation because it has a vested interest, of an unworthy sort, in\r\nmaintaining the present conditions. The explanation here put forward\r\nimputes no unworthy motive. The opposition of the class to changes in\r\nthe cultural scheme is instinctive, and does not rest primarily on an\r\ninterested calculation of material advantages; it is an instinctive\r\nrevulsion at any departure from the accepted way of doing and of looking\r\nat things--a revulsion common to all men and only to be overcome by\r\nstress of circumstances. All change in habits of life and of thought\r\nis irksome. The difference in this respect between the wealthy and the\r\ncommon run of mankind lies not so much in the motive which prompts to\r\nconservatism as in the degree of exposure to the economic forces that\r\nurge a change. The members of the wealthy class do not yield to the\r\ndemand for innovation as readily as other men because they are not\r\nconstrained to do so.\r\n\r\nThis conservatism of the wealthy class is so obvious a feature that\r\nit has even come to be recognized as a mark of respectability. Since\r\nconservatism is a characteristic of the wealthier and therefore more\r\nreputable portion of the community, it has acquired a certain honorific\r\nor decorative value. It has become prescriptive to such an extent that\r\nan adherence to conservative views is comprised as a matter of course in\r\nour notions of respectability; and it is imperatively incumbent on all\r\nwho would lead a blameless life in point of social repute. Conservatism,\r\nbeing an upper-class characteristic, is decorous; and conversely,\r\ninnovation, being a lower-class phenomenon, is vulgar. The first and\r\nmost unreflected element in that instinctive revulsion and reprobation\r\nwith which we turn from all social innovators is this sense of the\r\nessential vulgarity of the thing. So that even in cases where one\r\nrecognizes the substantial merits of the case for which the innovator\r\nis spokesman--as may easily happen if the evils which he seeks to\r\nremedy are sufficiently remote in point of time or space or personal\r\ncontact--still one cannot but be sensible of the fact that the innovator\r\nis a person with whom it is at least distasteful to be associated, and\r\nfrom whose social contact one must shrink. Innovation is bad form.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the usages, actions, and views of the well-to-do leisure\r\nclass acquire the character of a prescriptive canon of conduct for\r\nthe rest of society, gives added weight and reach to the conservative\r\ninfluence of that class. It makes it incumbent upon all reputable people\r\nto follow their lead. So that, by virtue of its high position as the\r\navatar of good form, the wealthier class comes to exert a retarding\r\ninfluence upon social development far in excess of that which the\r\nsimple numerical strength of the class would assign it. Its prescriptive\r\nexample acts to greatly stiffen the resistance of all other classes\r\nagainst any innovation, and to fix men\'s affections upon the good\r\ninstitutions handed down from an earlier generation. There is a second\r\nway in which the influence of the leisure class acts in the same\r\ndirection, so far as concerns hindrance to the adoption of a\r\nconventional scheme of life more in accord with the exigencies of\r\nthe time. This second method of upper-class guidance is not in strict\r\nconsistency to be brought under the same category as the instinctive\r\nconservatism and aversion to new modes of thought just spoken of; but\r\nit may as well be dealt with here, since it has at least this much\r\nin common with the conservative habit of mind that it acts to retard\r\ninnovation and the growth of social structure. The code of proprieties,\r\nconventionalities, and usages in vogue at any given time and among any\r\ngiven people has more or less of the character of an organic whole;\r\nso that any appreciable change in one point of the scheme involves\r\nsomething of a change or readjustment at other points also, if not\r\na reorganization all along the line. When a change is made which\r\nimmediately touches only a minor point in the scheme, the consequent\r\nderangement of the structure of conventionalities may be inconspicuous;\r\nbut even in such a case it is safe to say that some derangement of the\r\ngeneral scheme, more or less far-reaching, will follow. On the\r\nother hand, when an attempted reform involves the suppression or\r\nthorough-going remodelling of an institution of first-rate importance\r\nin the conventional scheme, it is immediately felt that a serious\r\nderangement of the entire scheme would result; it is felt that a\r\nreadjustment of the structure to the new form taken on by one of\r\nits chief elements would be a painful and tedious, if not a doubtful\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nIn order to realize the difficulty which such a radical change in any\r\none feature of the conventional scheme of life would involve, it is only\r\nnecessary to suggest the suppression of the monogamic family, or of\r\nthe agnatic system of consanguinity, or of private property, or of the\r\ntheistic faith, in any country of the Western civilization; or suppose\r\nthe suppression of ancestor worship in China, or of the caste system in\r\nindia, or of slavery in Africa, or the establishment of equality of the\r\nsexes in Mohammedan countries. It needs no argument to show that the\r\nderangement of the general structure of conventionalities in any of\r\nthese cases would be very considerable. In order to effect such an\r\ninnovation a very far-reaching alteration of men\'s habits of thought\r\nwould be involved also at other points of the scheme than the one\r\nimmediately in question. The aversion to any such innovation amounts to\r\na shrinking from an essentially alien scheme of life.\r\n\r\nThe revulsion felt by good people at any proposed departure from the\r\naccepted methods of life is a familiar fact of everyday experience. It\r\nis not unusual to hear those persons who dispense salutary advice\r\nand admonition to the community express themselves forcibly upon the\r\nfar-reaching pernicious effects which the community would suffer from\r\nsuch relatively slight changes as the disestablishment of the Anglican\r\nChurch, an increased facility of divorce, adoption of female suffrage,\r\nprohibition of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating beverages,\r\nabolition or restriction of inheritances, etc. Any one of these\r\ninnovations would, we are told, "shake the social structure to its\r\nbase," "reduce society to chaos," "subvert the foundations of morality,"\r\n"make life intolerable," "confound the order of nature," etc. These\r\nvarious locutions are, no doubt, of the nature of hyperbole; but, at the\r\nsame time, like all overstatement, they are evidence of a lively sense\r\nof the gravity of the consequences which they are intended to describe.\r\nThe effect of these and like innovations in deranging the accepted\r\nscheme of life is felt to be of much graver consequence than the simple\r\nalteration of an isolated item in a series of contrivances for the\r\nconvenience of men in society. What is true in so obvious a degree of\r\ninnovations of first-rate importance is true in a less degree of changes\r\nof a smaller immediate importance. The aversion to change is in large\r\npart an aversion to the bother of making the readjustment which any\r\ngiven change will necessitate; and this solidarity of the system of\r\ninstitutions of any given culture or of any given people strengthens the\r\ninstinctive resistance offered to any change in men\'s habits of thought,\r\neven in matters which, taken by themselves, are of minor importance. A\r\nconsequence of this increased reluctance, due to the solidarity of human\r\ninstitutions, is that any innovation calls for a greater expenditure of\r\nnervous energy in making the necessary readjustment than would otherwise\r\nbe the case. It is not only that a change in established habits of\r\nthought is distasteful. The process of readjustment of the accepted\r\ntheory of life involves a degree of mental effort--a more or less\r\nprotracted and laborious effort to find and to keep one\'s bearings under\r\nthe altered circumstances. This process requires a certain expenditure\r\nof energy, and so presumes, for its successful accomplishment, some\r\nsurplus of energy beyond that absorbed in the daily struggle for\r\nsubsistence. Consequently it follows that progress is hindered by\r\nunderfeeding and excessive physical hardship, no less effectually than\r\nby such a luxurious life as will shut out discontent by cutting off the\r\noccasion for it. The abjectly poor, and all those persons whose\r\nenergies are entirely absorbed by the struggle for daily sustenance, are\r\nconservative because they cannot afford the effort of taking thought for\r\nthe day after tomorrow; just as the highly prosperous are conservative\r\nbecause they have small occasion to be discontented with the situation\r\nas it stands today.\r\n\r\nFrom this proposition it follows that the institution of a leisure class\r\nacts to make the lower classes conservative by withdrawing from them\r\nas much as it may of the means of sustenance, and so reducing their\r\nconsumption, and consequently their available energy, to such a point\r\nas to make them incapable of the effort required for the learning and\r\nadoption of new habits of thought. The accumulation of wealth at the\r\nupper end of the pecuniary scale implies privation at the lower end of\r\nthe scale. It is a commonplace that, wherever it occurs, a considerable\r\ndegree of privation among the body of the people is a serious obstacle\r\nto any innovation.\r\n\r\nThis direct inhibitory effect of the unequal distribution of wealth\r\nis seconded by an indirect effect tending to the same result. As has\r\nalready been seen, the imperative example set by the upper class in\r\nfixing the canons of reputability fosters the practice of conspicuous\r\nconsumption. The prevalence of conspicuous consumption as one of the\r\nmain elements in the standard of decency among all classes is of course\r\nnot traceable wholly to the example of the wealthy leisure class, but\r\nthe practice and the insistence on it are no doubt strengthened by the\r\nexample of the leisure class. The requirements of decency in this matter\r\nare very considerable and very imperative; so that even among classes\r\nwhose pecuniary position is sufficiently strong to admit a consumption\r\nof goods considerably in excess of the subsistence minimum, the\r\ndisposable surplus left over after the more imperative physical\r\nneeds are satisfied is not infrequently diverted to the purpose of a\r\nconspicuous decency, rather than to added physical comfort and fullness\r\nof life. Moreover, such surplus energy as is available is also likely to\r\nbe expended in the acquisition of goods for conspicuous consumption or\r\nconspicuous boarding. The result is that the requirements of pecuniary\r\nreputability tend (1) to leave but a scanty subsistence minimum\r\navailable for other than conspicuous consumption, and (2) to absorb\r\nany surplus energy which may be available after the bare physical\r\nnecessities of life have been provided for. The outcome of the whole is\r\na strengthening of the general conservative attitude of the community.\r\nThe institution of a leisure class hinders cultural development\r\nimmediately (1) by the inertia proper to the class itself, (2) through\r\nits prescriptive example of conspicuous waste and of conservatism, and\r\n(3) indirectly through that system of unequal distribution of wealth and\r\nsustenance on which the institution itself rests. To this is to be added\r\nthat the leisure class has also a material interest in leaving things\r\nas they are. Under the circumstances prevailing at any given time this\r\nclass is in a privileged position, and any departure from the existing\r\norder may be expected to work to the detriment of the class rather than\r\nthe reverse. The attitude of the class, simply as influenced by its\r\nclass interest, should therefore be to let well-enough alone. This\r\ninterested motive comes in to supplement the strong instinctive bias of\r\nthe class, and so to render it even more consistently conservative than\r\nit otherwise would be.\r\n\r\nAll this, of course, has nothing to say in the way of eulogy or\r\ndeprecation of the office of the leisure class as an exponent and\r\nvehicle of conservatism or reversion in social structure. The inhibition\r\nwhich it exercises may be salutary or the reverse. Wether it is the one\r\nor the other in any given case is a question of casuistry rather than of\r\ngeneral theory. There may be truth in the view (as a question of policy)\r\nso often expressed by the spokesmen of the conservative element, that\r\nwithout some such substantial and consistent resistance to innovation as\r\nis offered by the conservative well-to-do classes, social innovation\r\nand experiment would hurry the community into untenable and intolerable\r\nsituations; the only possible result of which would be discontent and\r\ndisastrous reaction. All this, however, is beside the present argument.\r\n\r\nBut apart from all deprecation, and aside from all question as to the\r\nindispensability of some such check on headlong innovation, the leisure\r\nclass, in the nature of things, consistently acts to retard that\r\nadjustment to the environment which is called social advance or\r\ndevelopment. The characteristic attitude of the class may be summed\r\nup in the maxim: "Whatever is, is right" whereas the law of natural\r\nselection, as applied to human institutions, gives the axiom: "Whatever\r\nis, is wrong." Not that the institutions of today are wholly wrong\r\nfor the purposes of the life of today, but they are, always and in the\r\nnature of things, wrong to some extent. They are the result of a more or\r\nless inadequate adjustment of the methods of living to a situation which\r\nprevailed at some point in the past development; and they are therefore\r\nwrong by something more than the interval which separates the present\r\nsituation from that of the past. "Right" and "wrong" are of course here\r\nused without conveying any rejection as to what ought or ought not to\r\nbe. They are applied simply from the (morally colorless) evolutionary\r\nstandpoint, and are intended to designate compatibility or\r\nincompatibility with the effective evolutionary process. The institution\r\nof a leisure class, by force or class interest and instinct, and by\r\nprecept and prescriptive example, makes for the perpetuation of the\r\nexisting maladjustment of institutions, and even favors a reversion to\r\na somewhat more archaic scheme of life; a scheme which would be still\r\nfarther out of adjustment with the exigencies of life under the existing\r\nsituation even than the accredited, obsolescent scheme that has come\r\ndown from the immediate past.\r\n\r\nBut after all has been said on the head of conservation of the good old\r\nways, it remains true that institutions change and develop. There is\r\na cumulative growth of customs and habits of thought; a selective\r\nadaptation of conventions and methods of life. Something is to be said\r\nof the office of the leisure class in guiding this growth as well as\r\nin retarding it; but little can be said here of its relation to\r\ninstitutional growth except as it touches the institutions that\r\nare primarily and immediately of an economic character. These\r\ninstitutions--the economic structure--may be roughly distinguished into\r\ntwo classes or categories, according as they serve one or the other of\r\ntwo divergent purposes of economic life.\r\n\r\nTo adapt the classical terminology, they are institutions of acquisition\r\nor of production; or to revert to terms already employed in a different\r\nconnection in earlier chapters, they are pecuniary or industrial\r\ninstitutions; or in still other terms, they are institutions serving\r\neither the invidious or the non-invidious economic interest. The former\r\ncategory have to do with "business," the latter with industry, taking\r\nthe latter word in the mechanical sense. The latter class are not\r\noften recognized as institutions, in great part because they do not\r\nimmediately concern the ruling class, and are, therefore, seldom the\r\nsubject of legislation or of deliberate convention. When they do receive\r\nattention they are commonly approached from the pecuniary or business\r\nside; that being the side or phase of economic life that chiefly\r\noccupies men\'s deliberations in our time, especially the deliberations\r\nof the upper classes. These classes have little else than a business\r\ninterest in things economic, and on them at the same time it is chiefly\r\nincumbent to deliberate upon the community\'s affairs.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the leisure (that is, propertied non-industrial)\r\nclass to the economic process is a pecuniary relation--a relation of\r\nacquisition, not of production; of exploitation, not of serviceability.\r\nIndirectly their economic office may, of course, be of the utmost\r\nimportance to the economic life process; and it is by no means here\r\nintended to depreciate the economic function of the propertied class or\r\nof the captains of industry. The purpose is simply to point out what is\r\nthe nature of the relation of these classes to the industrial process\r\nand to economic institutions. Their office is of a parasitic character,\r\nand their interest is to divert what substance they may to their own\r\nuse, and to retain whatever is under their hand. The conventions of the\r\nbusiness world have grown up under the selective surveillance of this\r\nprinciple of predation or parasitism. They are conventions of ownership;\r\nderivatives, more or less remote, of the ancient predatory culture. But\r\nthese pecuniary institutions do not entirely fit the situation of today,\r\nfor they have grown up under a past situation differing somewhat from\r\nthe present. Even for effectiveness in the pecuniary way, therefore,\r\nthey are not as apt as might be. The changed industrial life requires\r\nchanged methods of acquisition; and the pecuniary classes have some\r\ninterest in so adapting the pecuniary institutions as to give them the\r\nbest effect for acquisition of private gain that is compatible with the\r\ncontinuance of the industrial process out of which this gain arises.\r\nHence there is a more or less consistent trend in the leisure-class\r\nguidance of institutional growth, answering to the pecuniary ends which\r\nshape leisure-class economic life.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the pecuniary interest and the pecuniary habit of\r\nmind upon the growth of institutions is seen in those enactments\r\nand conventions that make for security of property, enforcement of\r\ncontracts, facility of pecuniary transactions, vested interests. Of\r\nsuch bearing are changes affecting bankruptcy and receiverships, limited\r\nliability, banking and currency, coalitions of laborers or employers,\r\ntrusts and pools. The community\'s institutional furniture of this kind\r\nis of immediate consequence only to the propertied classes, and in\r\nproportion as they are propertied; that is to say, in proportion as\r\nthey are to be ranked with the leisure class. But indirectly these\r\nconventions of business life are of the gravest consequence for the\r\nindustrial process and for the life of the community. And in guiding the\r\ninstitutional growth in this respect, the pecuniary classes, therefore,\r\nserve a purpose of the most serious importance to the community, not\r\nonly in the conservation of the accepted social scheme, but also\r\nin shaping the industrial process proper. The immediate end of this\r\npecuniary institutional structure and of its amelioration is the greater\r\nfacility of peaceable and orderly exploitation; but its remoter effects\r\nfar outrun this immediate object. Not only does the more facile conduct\r\nof business permit industry and extra-industrial life to go on with\r\nless perturbation; but the resulting elimination of disturbances and\r\ncomplications calling for an exercise of astute discrimination in\r\neveryday affairs acts to make the pecuniary class itself superfluous.\r\nAs fast as pecuniary transactions are reduced to routine, the captain\r\nof industry can be dispensed with. This consummation, it is needless\r\nto say, lies yet in the indefinite future. The ameliorations wrought in\r\nfavor of the pecuniary interest in modern institutions tend, in another\r\nfield, to substitute the "soulless" joint-stock corporation for the\r\ncaptain, and so they make also for the dispensability, of the great\r\nleisure-class function of ownership. Indirectly, therefore, the bent\r\ngiven to the growth of economic institutions by the leisure-class\r\ninfluence is of very considerable industrial consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Nine ~~ The Conservation of Archaic Traits\r\n\r\nThe institution of a leisure class has an effect not only upon social\r\nstructure but also upon the individual character of the members of\r\nsociety. So soon as a given proclivity or a given point of view has won\r\nacceptance as an authoritative standard or norm of life it will react\r\nupon the character of the members of the society which has accepted it\r\nas a norm. It will to some extent shape their habits of thought and\r\nwill exercise a selective surveillance over the development of men\'s\r\naptitudes and inclinations. This effect is wrought partly by a coercive,\r\neducational adaptation of the habits of all individuals, partly by a\r\nselective elimination of the unfit individuals and lines of descent.\r\nSuch human material as does not lend itself to the methods of life\r\nimposed by the accepted scheme suffers more or less elimination as well\r\nas repression. The principles of pecuniary emulation and of industrial\r\nexemption have in this way been erected into canons of life, and have\r\nbecome coercive factors of some importance in the situation to which men\r\nhave to adapt themselves.\r\n\r\nThese two broad principles of conspicuous waste and industrial exemption\r\naffect the cultural development both by guiding men\'s habits of thought,\r\nand so controlling the growth of institutions, and by selectively\r\nconserving certain traits of human nature that conduce to facility of\r\nlife under the leisure-class scheme, and so controlling the effective\r\ntemper of the community. The proximate tendency of the institution of\r\na leisure class in shaping human character runs in the direction of\r\nspiritual survival and reversion. Its effect upon the temper of a\r\ncommunity is of the nature of an arrested spiritual development. In\r\nthe later culture especially, the institution has, on the whole, a\r\nconservative trend. This proposition is familiar enough in substance,\r\nbut it may to many have the appearance of novelty in its present\r\napplication. Therefore a summary review of its logical grounds may\r\nnot be uncalled for, even at the risk of some tedious repetition and\r\nformulation of commonplaces.\r\n\r\nSocial evolution is a process of selective adaptation of temperament and\r\nhabits of thought under the stress of the circumstances of associated\r\nlife. The adaptation of habits of thought is the growth of institutions.\r\nBut along with the growth of institutions has gone a change of a more\r\nsubstantial character. Not only have the habits of men changed with the\r\nchanging exigencies of the situation, but these changing exigencies\r\nhave also brought about a correlative change in human nature. The human\r\nmaterial of society itself varies with the changing conditions of life.\r\nThis variation of human nature is held by the later ethnologists to be\r\na process of selection between several relatively stable and persistent\r\nethnic types or ethnic elements. Men tend to revert or to breed true,\r\nmore or less closely, to one or another of certain types of human nature\r\nthat have in their main features been fixed in approximate conformity\r\nto a situation in the past which differed from the situation of today.\r\nThere are several of these relatively stable ethnic types of mankind\r\ncomprised in the populations of the Western culture. These ethnic types\r\nsurvive in the race inheritance today, not as rigid and invariable\r\nmoulds, each of a single precise and specific pattern, but in the form\r\nof a greater or smaller number of variants. Some variation of the ethnic\r\ntypes has resulted under the protracted selective process to which\r\nthe several types and their hybrids have been subjected during the\r\nprehistoric and historic growth of culture.\r\n\r\nThis necessary variation of the types themselves, due to a selective\r\nprocess of considerable duration and of a consistent trend, has not been\r\nsufficiently noticed by the writers who have discussed ethnic survival.\r\nThe argument is here concerned with two main divergent variants of human\r\nnature resulting from this, relatively late, selective adaptation of\r\nthe ethnic types comprised in the Western culture; the point of interest\r\nbeing the probable effect of the situation of today in furthering\r\nvariation along one or the other of these two divergent lines.\r\n\r\nThe ethnological position may be briefly summed up; and in order to\r\navoid any but the most indispensable detail the schedule of types and\r\nvariants and the scheme of reversion and survival in which they\r\nare concerned are here presented with a diagrammatic meagerness and\r\nsimplicity which would not be admissible for any other purpose. The man\r\nof our industrial communities tends to breed true to one or the other\r\nof three main ethic types; the dolichocephalic-blond, the\r\nbrachycephalic-brunette, and the Mediterranean--disregarding minor and\r\noutlying elements of our culture. But within each of these main ethnic\r\ntypes the reversion tends to one or the other of at least two main\r\ndirections of variation; the peaceable or antepredatory variant and the\r\npredatory variant. The former of these two characteristic variants\r\nis nearer to the generic type in each case, being the reversional\r\nrepresentative of its type as it stood at the earliest stage\r\nof associated life of which there is available evidence, either\r\narchaeological or psychological. This variant is taken to represent the\r\nancestors of existing civilized man at the peaceable, savage phase of\r\nlife which preceded the predatory culture, the regime of status, and the\r\ngrowth of pecuniary emulation. The second or predatory variant of the\r\ntypes is taken to be a survival of a more recent modification of\r\nthe main ethnic types and their hybrids--of these types as they were\r\nmodified, mainly by a selective adaptation, under the discipline of\r\nthe predatory culture and the latter emulative culture of the\r\nquasi-peaceable stage, or the pecuniary culture proper.\r\n\r\nUnder the recognized laws of heredity there may be a survival from a\r\nmore or less remote past phase. In the ordinary, average, or normal\r\ncase, if the type has varied, the traits of the type are transmitted\r\napproximately as they have stood in the recent past--which may be called\r\nthe hereditary present. For the purpose in hand this hereditary present\r\nis represented by the later predatory and the quasi-peaceable culture.\r\n\r\nIt is to the variant of human nature which is characteristic of this\r\nrecent--hereditarily still existing--predatory or quasi-predatory\r\nculture that the modern civilized man tends to breed true in the common\r\nrun of cases. This proposition requires some qualification so far\r\nas concerns the descendants of the servile or repressed classes of\r\nbarbarian times, but the qualification necessary is probably not so\r\ngreat as might at first thought appear. Taking the population as a\r\nwhole, this predatory, emulative variant does not seem to have attained\r\na high degree of consistency or stability. That is to say, the human\r\nnature inherited by modern Occidental man is not nearly uniform in\r\nrespect of the range or the relative strength of the various aptitudes\r\nand propensities which go to make it up. The man of the hereditary\r\npresent is slightly archaic as judged for the purposes of the latest\r\nexigencies of associated life. And the type to which the modern man\r\nchiefly tends to revert under the law of variation is a somewhat more\r\narchaic human nature. On the other hand, to judge by the reversional\r\ntraits which show themselves in individuals that vary from the\r\nprevailing predatory style of temperament, the ante-predatory\r\nvariant seems to have a greater stability and greater symmetry in the\r\ndistribution or relative force of its temperamental elements.\r\n\r\nThis divergence of inherited human nature, as between an earlier and a\r\nlater variant of the ethnic type to which the individual tends to breed\r\ntrue, is traversed and obscured by a similar divergence between the\r\ntwo or three main ethnic types that go to make up the Occidental\r\npopulations. The individuals in these communities are conceived to be,\r\nin virtually every instance, hybrids of the prevailing ethnic elements\r\ncombined in the most varied proportions; with the result that they tend\r\nto take back to one or the other of the component ethnic types. These\r\nethnic types differ in temperament in a way somewhat similar to the\r\ndifference between the predatory and the antepredatory variants of the\r\ntypes; the dolicho-blond type showing more of the characteristics of the\r\npredatory temperament--or at least more of the violent disposition--than\r\nthe brachycephalic-brunette type, and especially more than the\r\nMediterranean. When the growth of institutions or of the effective\r\nsentiment of a given community shows a divergence from the predatory\r\nhuman nature, therefore, it is impossible to say with certainty that\r\nsuch a divergence indicates a reversion to the ante-predatory variant.\r\nIt may be due to an increasing dominance of the one or the other of the\r\n"lower" ethnic elements in the population. Still, although the evidence\r\nis not as conclusive as might be desired, there are indications that\r\nthe variations in the effective temperament of modern communities is not\r\naltogether due to a selection between stable ethnic types. It seems to\r\nbe to some appreciable extent a selection between the predatory and the\r\npeaceable variants of the several types. This conception of contemporary\r\nhuman evolution is not indispensable to the discussion. The general\r\nconclusions reached by the use of these concepts of selective\r\nadaptation would remain substantially true if the earlier, Darwinian\r\nand Spencerian, terms and concepts were substituted. Under the\r\ncircumstances, some latitude may be admissible in the use of terms. The\r\nword "type" is used loosely, to denote variations of temperament which\r\nthe ethnologists would perhaps recognize only as trivial variants of\r\nthe type rather than as distinct ethnic types. Wherever a closer\r\ndiscrimination seems essential to the argument, the effort to make such\r\na closer discrimination will be evident from the context.\r\n\r\nThe ethnic types of today, then, are variants of the primitive racial\r\ntypes. They have suffered some alteration, and have attained some degree\r\nof fixity in their altered form, under the discipline of the barbarian\r\nculture. The man of the hereditary present is the barbarian variant,\r\nservile or aristocratic, of the ethnic elements that constitute him.\r\nBut this barbarian variant has not attained the highest degree of\r\nhomogeneity or of stability. The barbarian culture--the predatory and\r\nquasi-peaceable cultural stages--though of great absolute duration, has\r\nbeen neither protracted enough nor invariable enough in character to\r\ngive an extreme fixity of type. Variations from the barbarian human\r\nnature occur with some frequency, and these cases of variation are\r\nbecoming more noticeable today, because the conditions of modern life no\r\nlonger act consistently to repress departures from the barbarian normal.\r\nThe predatory temperament does not lead itself to all the purposes of\r\nmodern life, and more especially not to modern industry.\r\n\r\nDepartures from the human nature of the hereditary present are most\r\nfrequently of the nature of reversions to an earlier variant of the\r\ntype. This earlier variant is represented by the temperament\r\nwhich characterizes the primitive phase of peaceable savagery. The\r\ncircumstances of life and the ends of effort that prevailed before the\r\nadvent of the barbarian culture, shaped human nature and fixed it as\r\nregards certain fundamental traits. And it is to these ancient, generic\r\nfeatures that modern men are prone to take back in case of variation\r\nfrom the human nature of the hereditary present. The conditions under\r\nwhich men lived in the most primitive stages of associated life that can\r\nproperly be called human, seem to have been of a peaceful kind; and the\r\ncharacter--the temperament and spiritual attitude of men under these\r\nearly conditions or environment and institutions seems to have been of\r\na peaceful and unaggressive, not to say an indolent, cast. For the\r\nimmediate purpose this peaceable cultural stage may be taken to mark\r\nthe initial phase of social development. So far as concerns the present\r\nargument, the dominant spiritual feature of this presumptive initial\r\nphase of culture seems to have been an unreflecting, unformulated sense\r\nof group solidarity, largely expressing itself in a complacent, but by\r\nno means strenuous, sympathy with all facility of human life, and an\r\nuneasy revulsion against apprehended inhibition or futility of life.\r\nThrough its ubiquitous presence in the habits of thought of the\r\nante-predatory savage man, this pervading but uneager sense of the\r\ngenerically useful seems to have exercised an appreciable constraining\r\nforce upon his life and upon the manner of his habitual contact with\r\nother members of the group.\r\n\r\nThe traces of this initial, undifferentiated peaceable phase of culture\r\nseem faint and doubtful if we look merely to such categorical evidence\r\nof its existence as is afforded by usages and views in vogue within the\r\nhistorical present, whether in civilized or in rude communities; but\r\nless dubious evidence of its existence is to be found in psychological\r\nsurvivals, in the way of persistent and pervading traits of human\r\ncharacter. These traits survive perhaps in an especial degree among\r\nthose ethic elements which were crowded into the background during the\r\npredatory culture. Traits that were suited to the earlier habits of life\r\nthen became relatively useless in the individual struggle for existence.\r\nAnd those elements of the population, or those ethnic groups, which\r\nwere by temperament less fitted to the predatory life were repressed and\r\npushed into the background. On the transition to the predatory culture\r\nthe character of the struggle for existence changed in some degree from\r\na struggle of the group against a non-human environment to a struggle\r\nagainst a human environment. This change was accompanied by an\r\nincreasing antagonism and consciousness of antagonism between the\r\nindividual members of the group. The conditions of success within the\r\ngroup, as well as the conditions of the survival of the group, changed\r\nin some measure; and the dominant spiritual attitude for the group\r\ngradually changed, and brought a different range of aptitudes and\r\npropensities into the position of legitimate dominance in the accepted\r\nscheme of life. Among these archaic traits that are to be regarded as\r\nsurvivals from the peaceable cultural phase, are that instinct of race\r\nsolidarity which we call conscience, including the sense of truthfulness\r\nand equity, and the instinct of workmanship, in its naive, non-invidious\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of the later biological and psychological science,\r\nhuman nature will have to be restated in terms of habit; and in the\r\nrestatement, this, in outline, appears to be the only assignable place\r\nand ground of these traits. These habits of life are of too pervading a\r\ncharacter to be ascribed to the influence of a late or brief discipline.\r\nThe ease with which they are temporarily overborne by the special\r\nexigencies of recent and modern life argues that these habits are the\r\nsurviving effects of a discipline of extremely ancient date, from the\r\nteachings of which men have frequently been constrained to depart in\r\ndetail under the altered circumstances of a later time; and the almost\r\nubiquitous fashion in which they assert themselves whenever the pressure\r\nof special exigencies is relieved, argues that the process by which the\r\ntraits were fixed and incorporated into the spiritual make-up of the\r\ntype must have lasted for a relatively very long time and without\r\nserious intermission. The point is not seriously affected by any\r\nquestion as to whether it was a process of habituation in the\r\nold-fashioned sense of the word or a process of selective adaptation of\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\nThe character and exigencies of life, under that regime of status and\r\nof individual and class antithesis which covers the entire interval from\r\nthe beginning of predatory culture to the present, argue that the traits\r\nof temperament here under discussion could scarcely have arisen and\r\nacquired fixity during that interval. It is entirely probable that these\r\ntraits have come down from an earlier method of life, and have survived\r\nthrough the interval of predatory and quasi-peaceable culture in a\r\ncondition of incipient, or at least imminent, desuetude, rather than\r\nthat they have been brought out and fixed by this later culture.\r\nThey appear to be hereditary characteristics of the race, and to have\r\npersisted in spite of the altered requirements of success under the\r\npredatory and the later pecuniary stages of culture. They seem to have\r\npersisted by force of the tenacity of transmission that belongs to an\r\nhereditary trait that is present in some degree in every member of the\r\nspecies, and which therefore rests on a broad basis of race continuity.\r\n\r\nSuch a generic feature is not readily eliminated, even under a process\r\nof selection so severe and protracted as that to which the traits here\r\nunder discussion were subjected during the predatory and quasi-peaceable\r\nstages. These peaceable traits are in great part alien to the methods\r\nand the animus of barbarian life. The salient characteristic of the\r\nbarbarian culture is an unremitting emulation and antagonism between\r\nclasses and between individuals. This emulative discipline favors those\r\nindividuals and lines of descent which possess the peaceable savage\r\ntraits in a relatively slight degree. It therefore tends to eliminate\r\nthese traits, and it has apparently weakened them, in an appreciable\r\ndegree, in the populations that have been subject to it. Even where the\r\nextreme penalty for non-conformity to the barbarian type of temperament\r\nis not paid, there results at least a more or less consistent repression\r\nof the non-conforming individuals and lines of descent. Where life is\r\nlargely a struggle between individuals within the group, the possession\r\nof the ancient peaceable traits in a marked degree would hamper an\r\nindividual in the struggle for life.\r\n\r\nUnder any known phase of culture, other or later than the presumptive\r\ninitial phase here spoken of, the gifts of good-nature, equity, and\r\nindiscriminate sympathy do not appreciably further the life of the\r\nindividual. Their possession may serve to protect the individual from\r\nhard usage at the hands of a majority that insists on a modicum of\r\nthese ingredients in their ideal of a normal man; but apart from their\r\nindirect and negative effect in this way, the individual fares better\r\nunder the regime of competition in proportion as he has less of these\r\ngifts. Freedom from scruple, from sympathy, honesty and regard for life,\r\nmay, within fairly wide limits, be said to further the success of the\r\nindividual in the pecuniary culture. The highly successful men of all\r\ntimes have commonly been of this type; except those whose success has\r\nnot been scored in terms of either wealth or power. It is only within\r\nnarrow limits, and then only in a Pickwickian sense, that honesty is the\r\nbest policy.\r\n\r\nAs seen from the point of view of life under modern civilized conditions\r\nin an enlightened community of the Western culture, the primitive,\r\nante-predatory savage, whose character it has been attempted to trace\r\nin outline above, was not a great success. Even for the purposes of\r\nthat hypothetical culture to which his type of human nature owes what\r\nstability it has--even for the ends of the peaceable savage group--this\r\nprimitive man has quite as many and as conspicuous economic failings as\r\nhe has economic virtues--as should be plain to any one whose sense of\r\nthe case is not biased by leniency born of a fellow-feeling. At his\r\nbest he is "a clever, good-for-nothing fellow." The shortcomings of this\r\npresumptively primitive type of character are weakness, inefficiency,\r\nlack of initiative and ingenuity, and a yielding and indolent\r\namiability, together with a lively but inconsequential animistic sense.\r\nAlong with these traits go certain others which have some value for the\r\ncollective life process, in the sense that they further the facility\r\nof life in the group. These traits are truthfulness, peaceableness,\r\ngood-will, and a non-emulative, non-invidious interest in men and\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the predatory stage of life there comes a change in\r\nthe requirements of the successful human character. Men\'s habits of life\r\nare required to adapt themselves to new exigencies under a new scheme\r\nof human relations. The same unfolding of energy, which had previously\r\nfound expression in the traits of savage life recited above, is now\r\nrequired to find expression along a new line of action, in a new group\r\nof habitual responses to altered stimuli. The methods which, as counted\r\nin terms of facility of life, answered measurably under the earlier\r\nconditions, are no longer adequate under the new conditions. The earlier\r\nsituation was characterized by a relative absence of antagonism or\r\ndifferentiation of interests, the later situation by an emulation\r\nconstantly increasing in relative absence of antagonism or\r\ndifferentiation of interests, the later situation by an emulation\r\nconstantly increasing in intensity and narrowing in scope. The traits\r\nwhich characterize the predatory and subsequent stages of culture, and\r\nwhich indicate the types of man best fitted to survive under the regime\r\nof status, are (in their primary expression) ferocity, self-seeking,\r\nclannishness, and disingenuousness--a free resort to force and fraud.\r\n\r\nUnder the severe and protracted discipline of the regime of competition,\r\nthe selection of ethnic types has acted to give a somewhat pronounced\r\ndominance to these traits of character, by favoring the survival of\r\nthose ethnic elements which are most richly endowed in these respects.\r\nAt the same time the earlier--acquired, more generic habits of the race\r\nhave never ceased to have some usefulness for the purpose of the life of\r\nthe collectivity and have never fallen into definitive abeyance. It may\r\nbe worth while to point out that the dolicho-blond type of European man\r\nseems to owe much of its dominating influence and its masterful position\r\nin the recent culture to its possessing the characteristics of predatory\r\nman in an exceptional degree. These spiritual traits, together with\r\na large endowment of physical energy--itself probably a result of\r\nselection between groups and between lines of descent--chiefly go to\r\nplace any ethnic element in the position of a leisure or master\r\nclass, especially during the earlier phases of the development of the\r\ninstitution of a leisure class. This need not mean that precisely the\r\nsame complement of aptitudes in any individual would insure him an\r\neminent personal success. Under the competitive regime, the conditions\r\nof success for the individual are not necessarily the same as those for\r\na class. The success of a class or party presumes a strong element of\r\nclannishness, or loyalty to a chief, or adherence to a tenet; whereas\r\nthe competitive individual can best achieve his ends if he combines the\r\nbarbarian\'s energy, initiative, self-seeking and disingenuousness with\r\nthe savage\'s lack of loyalty or clannishness. It may be remarked by the\r\nway, that the men who have scored a brilliant (Napoleonic) success on\r\nthe basis of an impartial self-seeking and absence of scruple, have\r\nnot uncommonly shown more of the physical characteristics of the\r\nbrachycephalic-brunette than of the dolicho-blond. The greater\r\nproportion of moderately successful individuals, in a self-seeking way,\r\nhowever, seem, in physique, to belong to the last-named ethnic element.\r\n\r\nThe temperament induced by the predatory habit of life makes for the\r\nsurvival and fullness of life of the individual under a regime of\r\nemulation; at the same time it makes for the survival and success of the\r\ngroup if the group\'s life as a collectivity is also predominantly a life\r\nof hostile competition with other groups. But the evolution of economic\r\nlife in the industrially more mature communities has now begun to take\r\nsuch a turn that the interest of the community no longer coincides with\r\nthe emulative interests of the individual. In their corporate capacity,\r\nthese advanced industrial communities are ceasing to be competitors\r\nfor the means of life or for the right to live--except in so far as the\r\npredatory propensities of their ruling classes keep up the tradition of\r\nwar and rapine. These communities are no longer hostile to one another\r\nby force of circumstances, other than the circumstances of tradition\r\nand temperament. Their material interests--apart, possibly, from\r\nthe interests of the collective good fame--are not only no longer\r\nincompatible, but the success of any one of the communities\r\nunquestionably furthers the fullness of life of any other community in\r\nthe group, for the present and for an incalculable time to come. No one\r\nof them any longer has any material interest in getting the better\r\nof any other. The same is not true in the same degree as regards\r\nindividuals and their relations to one another.\r\n\r\nThe collective interests of any modern community center in industrial\r\nefficiency. The individual is serviceable for the ends of the community\r\nsomewhat in proportion to his efficiency in the productive employments\r\nvulgarly so called. This collective interest is best served by honesty,\r\ndiligence, peacefulness, good-will, an absence of self-seeking, and\r\nan habitual recognition and apprehension of causal sequence, without\r\nadmixture of animistic belief and without a sense of dependence on any\r\npreternatural intervention in the course of events. Not much is to\r\nbe said for the beauty, moral excellence, or general worthiness and\r\nreputability of such a prosy human nature as these traits imply; and\r\nthere is little ground of enthusiasm for the manner of collective life\r\nthat would result from the prevalence of these traits in unmitigated\r\ndominance. But that is beside the point. The successful working of a\r\nmodern industrial community is best secured where these traits concur,\r\nand it is attained in the degree in which the human material is\r\ncharacterized by their possession. Their presence in some measure is\r\nrequired in order to have a tolerable adjustment to the circumstances of\r\nthe modern industrial situation. The complex, comprehensive, essentially\r\npeaceable, and highly organized mechanism of the modern industrial\r\ncommunity works to the best advantage when these traits, or most of\r\nthem, are present in the highest practicable degree. These traits are\r\npresent in a markedly less degree in the man of the predatory type than\r\nis useful for the purposes of the modern collective life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the immediate interest of the individual under the\r\ncompetitive regime is best served by shrewd trading and unscrupulous\r\nmanagement. The characteristics named above as serving the interests\r\nof the community are disserviceable to the individual, rather than\r\notherwise. The presence of these aptitudes in his make-up diverts his\r\nenergies to other ends than those of pecuniary gain; and also in\r\nhis pursuit of gain they lead him to seek gain by the indirect and\r\nineffectual channels of industry, rather than by a free and unfaltering\r\ncareer of sharp practice. The industrial aptitudes are pretty\r\nconsistently a hindrance to the individual. Under the regime of\r\nemulation the members of a modern industrial community are rivals, each\r\nof whom will best attain his individual and immediate advantage if,\r\nthrough an exceptional exemption from scruple, he is able serenely to\r\noverreach and injure his fellows when the chance offers.\r\n\r\nIt has already been noticed that modern economic institutions fall into\r\ntwo roughly distinct categories--the pecuniary and the industrial. The\r\nlike is true of employments. Under the former head are employments that\r\nhave to do with ownership or acquisition; under the latter head, those\r\nthat have to do with workmanship or production. As was found in speaking\r\nof the growth of institutions, so with regard to employments.\r\nThe economic interests of the leisure class lie in the pecuniary\r\nemployments; those of the working classes lie in both classes of\r\nemployments, but chiefly in the industrial. Entrance to the leisure\r\nclass lies through the pecuniary employments.\r\n\r\nThese two classes of employment differ materially in respect of the\r\naptitudes required for each; and the training which they give similarly\r\nfollows two divergent lines. The discipline of the pecuniary employments\r\nacts to conserve and to cultivate certain of the predatory aptitudes and\r\nthe predatory animus. It does this both by educating those individuals\r\nand classes who are occupied with these employments and by selectively\r\nrepressing and eliminating those individuals and lines of descent that\r\nare unfit in this respect. So far as men\'s habits of thought are shaped\r\nby the competitive process of acquisition and tenure; so far as their\r\neconomic functions are comprised within the range of ownership of\r\nwealth as conceived in terms of exchange value, and its management and\r\nfinanciering through a permutation of values; so far their experience\r\nin economic life favors the survival and accentuation of the predatory\r\ntemperament and habits of thought. Under the modern, peaceable system,\r\nit is of course the peaceable range of predatory habits and aptitudes\r\nthat is chiefly fostered by a life of acquisition. That is to say, the\r\npecuniary employments give proficiency in the general line of practices\r\ncomprised under fraud, rather than in those that belong under the more\r\narchaic method of forcible seizure.\r\n\r\nThese pecuniary employments, tending to conserve the predatory\r\ntemperament, are the employments which have to do with ownership--the\r\nimmediate function of the leisure class proper--and the subsidiary\r\nfunctions concerned with acquisition and accumulation. These cover the\r\nclass of persons and that range of duties in the economic process which\r\nhave to do with the ownership of enterprises engaged in competitive\r\nindustry; especially those fundamental lines of economic management\r\nwhich are classed as financiering operations. To these may be added\r\nthe greater part of mercantile occupations. In their best and clearest\r\ndevelopment these duties make up the economic office of the "captain\r\nof industry." The captain of industry is an astute man rather than\r\nan ingenious one, and his captaincy is a pecuniary rather than an\r\nindustrial captaincy. Such administration of industry as he exercises\r\nis commonly of a permissive kind. The mechanically effective details of\r\nproduction and of industrial organization are delegated to subordinates\r\nof a less "practical" turn of mind--men who are possessed of a gift for\r\nworkmanship rather than administrative ability. So far as regards their\r\ntendency in shaping human nature by education and selection, the common\r\nrun of non-economic employments are to be classed with the pecuniary\r\nemployments. Such are politics and ecclesiastical and military\r\nemployments.\r\n\r\nThe pecuniary employments have also the sanction of reputability in\r\na much higher degree than the industrial employments. In this way the\r\nleisure-class standards of good repute come in to sustain the\r\nprestige of those aptitudes that serve the invidious purpose; and the\r\nleisure-class scheme of decorous living, therefore, also furthers the\r\nsurvival and culture of the predatory traits. Employments fall into\r\na hierarchical gradation of reputability. Those which have to do\r\nimmediately with ownership on a large scale are the most reputable of\r\neconomic employments proper. Next to these in good repute come\r\nthose employments that are immediately subservient to ownership and\r\nfinanciering--such as banking and the law. Banking employments also\r\ncarry a suggestion of large ownership, and this fact is doubtless\r\naccountable for a share of the prestige that attaches to the business.\r\nThe profession of the law does not imply large ownership; but since no\r\ntaint of usefulness, for other than the competitive purpose, attaches\r\nto the lawyer\'s trade, it grades high in the conventional scheme. The\r\nlawyer is exclusively occupied with the details of predatory fraud,\r\neither in achieving or in checkmating chicanery, and success in the\r\nprofession is therefore accepted as marking a large endowment of that\r\nbarbarian astuteness which has always commanded men\'s respect and fear.\r\nMercantile pursuits are only half-way reputable, unless they involve a\r\nlarge element of ownership and a small element of usefulness. They grade\r\nhigh or low somewhat in proportion as they serve the higher or the lower\r\nneeds; so that the business of retailing the vulgar necessaries of\r\nlife descends to the level of the handicrafts and factory labor. Manual\r\nlabor, or even the work of directing mechanical processes, is of course\r\non a precarious footing as regards respectability. A qualification is\r\nnecessary as regards the discipline given by the pecuniary employments.\r\nAs the scale of industrial enterprise grows larger, pecuniary management\r\ncomes to bear less of the character of chicanery and shrewd competition\r\nin detail. That is to say, for an ever-increasing proportion of the\r\npersons who come in contact with this phase of economic life, business\r\nreduces itself to a routine in which there is less immediate suggestion\r\nof overreaching or exploiting a competitor. The consequent exemption\r\nfrom predatory habits extends chiefly to subordinates employed in\r\nbusiness. The duties of ownership and administration are virtually\r\nuntouched by this qualification. The case is different as regards those\r\nindividuals or classes who are immediately occupied with the technique\r\nand manual operations of production. Their daily life is not in the same\r\ndegree a course of habituation to the emulative and invidious motives\r\nand maneuvers of the pecuniary side of industry. They are consistently\r\nheld to the apprehension and coordination of mechanical facts and\r\nsequences, and to their appreciation and utilization for the purposes\r\nof human life. So far as concerns this portion of the population, the\r\neducative and selective action of the industrial process with which they\r\nare immediately in contact acts to adapt their habits of thought to the\r\nnon-invidious purposes of the collective life. For them, therefore, it\r\nhastens the obsolescence of the distinctively predatory aptitudes and\r\npropensities carried over by heredity and tradition from the barbarian\r\npast of the race.\r\n\r\nThe educative action of the economic life of the community, therefore,\r\nis not of a uniform kind throughout all its manifestations. That range\r\nof economic activities which is concerned immediately with pecuniary\r\ncompetition has a tendency to conserve certain predatory traits; while\r\nthose industrial occupations which have to do immediately with the\r\nproduction of goods have in the main the contrary tendency. But with\r\nregard to the latter class of employments it is to be noticed in\r\nqualification that the persons engaged in them are nearly all to some\r\nextent also concerned with matters of pecuniary competition (as, for\r\ninstance, in the competitive fixing of wages and salaries, in the\r\npurchase of goods for consumption, etc.). Therefore the distinction\r\nhere made between classes of employments is by no means a hard and fast\r\ndistinction between classes of persons.\r\n\r\nThe employments of the leisure classes in modern industry are such as to\r\nkeep alive certain of the predatory habits and aptitudes. So far as\r\nthe members of those classes take part in the industrial process, their\r\ntraining tends to conserve in them the barbarian temperament. But there\r\nis something to be said on the other side. Individuals so placed as to\r\nbe exempt from strain may survive and transmit their characteristics\r\neven if they differ widely from the average of the species both in\r\nphysique and in spiritual make-up. The chances for a survival and\r\ntransmission of atavistic traits are greatest in those classes that are\r\nmost sheltered from the stress of circumstances. The leisure class is in\r\nsome degree sheltered from the stress of the industrial situation,\r\nand should, therefore, afford an exceptionally great proportion of\r\nreversions to the peaceable or savage temperament. It should be possible\r\nfor such aberrant or atavistic individuals to unfold their life activity\r\non ante-predatory lines without suffering as prompt a repression or\r\nelimination as in the lower walks of life.\r\n\r\nSomething of the sort seems to be true in fact. There is, for instance,\r\nan appreciable proportion of the upper classes whose inclinations\r\nlead them into philanthropic work, and there is a considerable body\r\nof sentiment in the class going to support efforts of reform and\r\namelioration. And much of this philanthropic and reformatory effort,\r\nmoreover, bears the marks of that amiable "cleverness" and incoherence\r\nthat is characteristic of the primitive savage. But it may still be\r\ndoubtful whether these facts are evidence of a larger proportion of\r\nreversions in the higher than in the lower strata, even if the same\r\ninclinations were present in the impecunious classes, it would not as\r\neasily find expression there; since those classes lack the means and the\r\ntime and energy to give effect to their inclinations in this respect.\r\nThe prima facie evidence of the facts can scarcely go unquestioned.\r\n\r\nIn further qualification it is to be noted that the leisure class of\r\ntoday is recruited from those who have been successful in a pecuniary\r\nway, and who, therefore, are presumably endowed with more than an even\r\ncomplement of the predatory traits. Entrance into the leisure class lies\r\nthrough the pecuniary employments, and these employments, by selection\r\nand adaptation, act to admit to the upper levels only those lines of\r\ndescent that are pecuniarily fit to survive under the predatory test.\r\nAnd so soon as a case of reversion to non-predatory human nature shows\r\nitself on these upper levels, it is commonly weeded out and thrown back\r\nto the lower pecuniary levels. In order to hold its place in the class,\r\na stock must have the pecuniary temperament; otherwise its fortune would\r\nbe dissipated and it would presently lose caste. Instances of this kind\r\nare sufficiently frequent. The constituency of the leisure class is kept\r\nup by a continual selective process, whereby the individuals and\r\nlines of descent that are eminently fitted for an aggressive pecuniary\r\ncompetition are withdrawn from the lower classes. In order to reach the\r\nupper levels the aspirant must have, not only a fair average complement\r\nof the pecuniary aptitudes, but he must have these gifts in such an\r\neminent degree as to overcome very material difficulties that stand in\r\nthe way of his ascent. Barring accidents, the nouveaux arriv\xe9s are a\r\npicked body.\r\n\r\nThis process of selective admission has, of course, always been going\r\non; ever since the fashion of pecuniary emulation set in--which is much\r\nthe same as saying, ever since the institution of a leisure class was\r\nfirst installed. But the precise ground of selection has not always been\r\nthe same, and the selective process has therefore not always given the\r\nsame results. In the early barbarian, or predatory stage proper, the\r\ntest of fitness was prowess, in the naive sense of the word. To gain\r\nentrance to the class, the candidate had to be gifted with clannishness,\r\nmassiveness, ferocity, unscrupulousness, and tenacity of purpose. These\r\nwere the qualities that counted toward the accumulation and continued\r\ntenure of wealth. The economic basis of the leisure class, then as\r\nlater, was the possession of wealth; but the methods of accumulating\r\nwealth, and the gifts required for holding it, have changed in some\r\ndegree since the early days of the predatory culture. In consequence of\r\nthe selective process the dominant traits of the early barbarian leisure\r\nclass were bold aggression, an alert sense of status, and a free\r\nresort to fraud. The members of the class held their place by tenure of\r\nprowess. In the later barbarian culture society attained settled methods\r\nof acquisition and possession under the quasi-peaceable regime of\r\nstatus. Simple aggression and unrestrained violence in great measure\r\ngave place to shrewd practice and chicanery, as the best approved method\r\nof accumulating wealth. A different range of aptitudes and propensities\r\nwould then be conserved in the leisure class. Masterful aggression, and\r\nthe correlative massiveness, together with a ruthlessly consistent\r\nsense of status, would still count among the most splendid traits of\r\nthe class. These have remained in our traditions as the typical\r\n"aristocratic virtues." But with these were associated an increasing\r\ncomplement of the less obtrusive pecuniary virtues; such as providence,\r\nprudence, and chicanery. As time has gone on, and the modern peaceable\r\nstage of pecuniary culture has been approached, the last-named range of\r\naptitudes and habits has gained in relative effectiveness for pecuniary\r\nends, and they have counted for relatively more in the selective process\r\nunder which admission is gained and place is held in the leisure class.\r\n\r\nThe ground of selection has changed, until the aptitudes which now\r\nqualify for admission to the class are the pecuniary aptitudes only.\r\nWhat remains of the predatory barbarian traits is the tenacity of\r\npurpose or consistency of aim which distinguished the successful\r\npredatory barbarian from the peaceable savage whom he supplanted.\r\nBut this trait can not be said characteristically to distinguish the\r\npecuniarily successful upper-class man from the rank and file of the\r\nindustrial classes. The training and the selection to which the latter\r\nare exposed in modern industrial life give a similarly decisive weight\r\nto this trait. Tenacity of purpose may rather be said to distinguish\r\nboth these classes from two others; the shiftless ne\'er do-well and the\r\nlower-class delinquent. In point of natural endowment the pecuniary man\r\ncompares with the delinquent in much the same way as the industrial man\r\ncompares with the good-natured shiftless dependent. The ideal pecuniary\r\nman is like the ideal delinquent in his unscrupulous conversion of goods\r\nand persons to his own ends, and in a callous disregard of the feelings\r\nand wishes of others and of the remoter effects of his actions; but he\r\nis unlike him in possessing a keener sense of status, and in working\r\nmore consistently and farsightedly to a remoter end. The kinship of the\r\ntwo types of temperament is further shown in a proclivity to "sport"\r\nand gambling, and a relish of aimless emulation. The ideal pecuniary\r\nman also shows a curious kinship with the delinquent in one of the\r\nconcomitant variations of the predatory human nature. The delinquent is\r\nvery commonly of a superstitious habit of mind; he is a great believer\r\nin luck, spells, divination and destiny, and in omens and shamanistic\r\nceremony. Where circumstances are favorable, this proclivity is apt to\r\nexpress itself in a certain servile devotional fervor and a punctilious\r\nattention to devout observances; it may perhaps be better characterized\r\nas devoutness than as religion. At this point the temperament of the\r\ndelinquent has more in common with the pecuniary and leisure classes\r\nthan with the industrial man or with the class of shiftless dependents.\r\n\r\nLife in a modern industrial community, or in other words life under\r\nthe pecuniary culture, acts by a process of selection to develop and\r\nconserve a certain range of aptitudes and propensities. The present\r\ntendency of this selective process is not simply a reversion to a given,\r\nimmutable ethnic type. It tends rather to a modification of human nature\r\ndiffering in some respects from any of the types or variants transmitted\r\nout of the past. The objective point of the evolution is not a single\r\none. The temperament which the evolution acts to establish as normal\r\ndiffers from any one of the archaic variants of human nature in its\r\ngreater stability of aim--greater singleness of purpose and greater\r\npersistence in effort. So far as concerns economic theory, the objective\r\npoint of the selective process is on the whole single to this extent;\r\nalthough there are minor tendencies of considerable importance diverging\r\nfrom this line of development. But apart from this general trend the\r\nline of development is not single. As concerns economic theory, the\r\ndevelopment in other respects runs on two divergent lines. So far\r\nas regards the selective conservation of capacities or aptitudes\r\nin individuals, these two lines may be called the pecuniary and the\r\nindustrial. As regards the conservation of propensities, spiritual\r\nattitude, or animus, the two may be called the invidious or\r\nself-regarding and the non-invidious or economical. As regards the\r\nintellectual or cognitive bent of the two directions of growth, the\r\nformer may be characterized as the personal standpoint, of conation,\r\nqualitative relation, status, or worth; the latter as the impersonal\r\nstandpoint, of sequence, quantitative relation, mechanical efficiency,\r\nor use.\r\n\r\nThe pecuniary employments call into action chiefly the former of\r\nthese two ranges of aptitudes and propensities, and act selectively\r\nto conserve them in the population. The industrial employments, on the\r\nother hand, chiefly exercise the latter range, and act to conserve them.\r\nAn exhaustive psychological analysis will show that each of these two\r\nranges of aptitudes and propensities is but the multiform expression of\r\na given temperamental bent. By force of the unity or singleness of\r\nthe individual, the aptitudes, animus, and interests comprised in the\r\nfirst-named range belong together as expressions of a given variant\r\nof human nature. The like is true of the latter range. The two may be\r\nconceived as alternative directions of human life, in such a way that\r\na given individual inclines more or less consistently to the one or\r\nthe other. The tendency of the pecuniary life is, in a general way, to\r\nconserve the barbarian temperament, but with the substitution of fraud\r\nand prudence, or administrative ability, in place of that predilection\r\nfor physical damage that characterizes the early barbarian. This\r\nsubstitution of chicanery in place of devastation takes place only in an\r\nuncertain degree. Within the pecuniary employments the selective action\r\nruns pretty consistently in this direction, but the discipline of\r\npecuniary life, outside the competition for gain, does not work\r\nconsistently to the same effect. The discipline of modern life in the\r\nconsumption of time and goods does not act unequivocally to eliminate\r\nthe aristocratic virtues or to foster the bourgeois virtues. The\r\nconventional scheme of decent living calls for a considerable exercise\r\nof the earlier barbarian traits. Some details of this traditional scheme\r\nof life, bearing on this point, have been noticed in earlier chapters\r\nunder the head of leisure, and further details will be shown in later\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it appears that the leisure-class life and\r\nthe leisure-class scheme of life should further the conservation of the\r\nbarbarian temperament; chiefly of the quasi-peaceable, or bourgeois,\r\nvariant, but also in some measure of the predatory variant. In the\r\nabsence of disturbing factors, therefore, it should be possible to\r\ntrace a difference of temperament between the classes of society. The\r\naristocratic and the bourgeois virtues--that is to say the destructive\r\nand pecuniary traits--should be found chiefly among the upper classes,\r\nand the industrial virtues--that is to say the peaceable traits--chiefly\r\namong the classes given to mechanical industry.\r\n\r\nIn a general and uncertain way this holds true, but the test is not so\r\nreadily applied nor so conclusive as might be wished. There are several\r\nassignable reasons for its partial failure. All classes are in a measure\r\nengaged in the pecuniary struggle, and in all classes the possession\r\nof the pecuniary traits counts towards the success and survival of\r\nthe individual. Wherever the pecuniary culture prevails, the selective\r\nprocess by which men\'s habits of thought are shaped, and by which the\r\nsurvival of rival lines of descent is decided, proceeds proximately on\r\nthe basis of fitness for acquisition. Consequently, if it were not for\r\nthe fact that pecuniary efficiency is on the whole incompatible with\r\nindustrial efficiency, the selective action of all occupations would\r\ntend to the unmitigated dominance of the pecuniary temperament. The\r\nresult would be the installation of what has been known as the "economic\r\nman," as the normal and definitive type of human nature. But the\r\n"economic man," whose only interest is the self-regarding one and whose\r\nonly human trait is prudence is useless for the purposes of modern\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe modern industry requires an impersonal, non-invidious interest in\r\nthe work in hand. Without this the elaborate processes of industry\r\nwould be impossible, and would, indeed, never have been conceived. This\r\ninterest in work differentiates the workman from the criminal on the one\r\nhand, and from the captain of industry on the other. Since work must be\r\ndone in order to the continued life of the community, there results a\r\nqualified selection favoring the spiritual aptitude for work, within\r\na certain range of occupations. This much, however, is to be conceded,\r\nthat even within the industrial occupations the selective elimination\r\nof the pecuniary traits is an uncertain process, and that there is\r\nconsequently an appreciable survival of the barbarian temperament even\r\nwithin these occupations. On this account there is at present no broad\r\ndistinction in this respect between the leisure-class character and the\r\ncharacter of the common run of the population.\r\n\r\nThe whole question as to a class distinction in respect to spiritual\r\nmake-up is also obscured by the presence, in all classes of society, of\r\nacquired habits of life that closely simulate inherited traits and at\r\nthe same time act to develop in the entire body of the population the\r\ntraits which they simulate. These acquired habits, or assumed traits of\r\ncharacter, are most commonly of an aristocratic cast. The prescriptive\r\nposition of the leisure class as the exemplar of reputability has\r\nimposed many features of the leisure-class theory of life upon the\r\nlower classes; with the result that there goes on, always and throughout\r\nsociety, a more or less persistent cultivation of these aristocratic\r\ntraits. On this ground also these traits have a better chance of\r\nsurvival among the body of the people than would be the case if it were\r\nnot for the precept and example of the leisure class. As one channel,\r\nand an important one, through which this transfusion of aristocratic\r\nviews of life, and consequently more or less archaic traits of character\r\ngoes on, may be mentioned the class of domestic servants. These have\r\ntheir notions of what is good and beautiful shaped by contact with the\r\nmaster class and carry the preconceptions so acquired back among their\r\nlow-born equals, and so disseminate the higher ideals abroad through\r\nthe community without the loss of time which this dissemination might\r\notherwise suffer. The saying "Like master, like man," has a greater\r\nsignificance than is commonly appreciated for the rapid popular\r\nacceptance of many elements of upper-class culture.\r\n\r\nThere is also a further range of facts that go to lessen class\r\ndifferences as regards the survival of the pecuniary virtues. The\r\npecuniary struggle produces an underfed class, of large proportions.\r\nThis underfeeding consists in a deficiency of the necessaries of life or\r\nof the necessaries of a decent expenditure. In either case the result is\r\na closely enforced struggle for the means with which to meet the daily\r\nneeds; whether it be the physical or the higher needs. The strain of\r\nself-assertion against odds takes up the whole energy of the individual;\r\nhe bends his efforts to compass his own invidious ends alone, and\r\nbecomes continually more narrowly self-seeking. The industrial traits in\r\nthis way tend to obsolescence through disuse. Indirectly, therefore, by\r\nimposing a scheme of pecuniary decency and by withdrawing as much as\r\nmay be of the means of life from the lower classes, the institution of\r\na leisure class acts to conserve the pecuniary traits in the body of the\r\npopulation. The result is an assimilation of the lower classes to the\r\ntype of human nature that belongs primarily to the upper classes only.\r\nIt appears, therefore, that there is no wide difference in temperament\r\nbetween the upper and the lower classes; but it appears also that the\r\nabsence of such a difference is in good part due to the prescriptive\r\nexample of the leisure class and to the popular acceptance of those\r\nbroad principles of conspicuous waste and pecuniary emulation on which\r\nthe institution of a leisure class rests. The institution acts to lower\r\nthe industrial efficiency of the community and retard the adaptation of\r\nhuman nature to the exigencies of modern industrial life. It affects the\r\nprevalent or effective human nature in a conservative direction, (1) by\r\ndirect transmission of archaic traits, through inheritance within the\r\nclass and wherever the leisure-class blood is transfused outside the\r\nclass, and (2) by conserving and fortifying the traditions of the\r\narchaic regime, and so making the chances of survival of barbarian\r\ntraits greater also outside the range of transfusion of leisure-class\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nBut little if anything has been done towards collecting or digesting\r\ndata that are of special significance for the question of survival or\r\nelimination of traits in the modern populations. Little of a tangible\r\ncharacter can therefore be offered in support of the view here taken,\r\nbeyond a discursive review of such everyday facts as lie ready to hand.\r\nSuch a recital can scarcely avoid being commonplace and tedious, but for\r\nall that it seems necessary to the completeness of the argument, even in\r\nthe meager outline in which it is here attempted. A degree of indulgence\r\nmay therefore fairly be bespoken for the succeeding chapters, which\r\noffer a fragmentary recital of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Ten ~~ Modern Survivals of Prowess\r\n\r\nThe leisure class lives by the industrial community rather than in it.\r\nIts relations to industry are of a pecuniary rather than an industrial\r\nkind. Admission to the class is gained by exercise of the pecuniary\r\naptitudes--aptitudes for acquisition rather than for serviceability.\r\nThere is, therefore, a continued selective sifting of the human material\r\nthat makes up the leisure class, and this selection proceeds on the\r\nground of fitness for pecuniary pursuits. But the scheme of life of the\r\nclass is in large part a heritage from the past, and embodies much of\r\nthe habits and ideals of the earlier barbarian period. This archaic,\r\nbarbarian scheme of life imposes itself also on the lower orders, with\r\nmore or less mitigation. In its turn the scheme of life, of conventions,\r\nacts selectively and by education to shape the human material, and its\r\naction runs chiefly in the direction of conserving traits, habits, and\r\nideals that belong to the early barbarian age--the age of prowess and\r\npredatory life.\r\n\r\nThe most immediate and unequivocal expression of that archaic human\r\nnature which characterizes man in the predatory stage is the fighting\r\npropensity proper. In cases where the predatory activity is a collective\r\none, this propensity is frequently called the martial spirit, or,\r\nlatterly, patriotism. It needs no insistence to find assent to the\r\nproposition that in the countries of civilized Europe the hereditary\r\nleisure class is endowed with this martial spirit in a higher\r\ndegree than the middle classes. Indeed, the leisure class claims the\r\ndistinction as a matter of pride, and no doubt with some grounds. War is\r\nhonorable, and warlike prowess is eminently honorific in the eyes of the\r\ngenerality of men; and this admiration of warlike prowess is itself\r\nthe best voucher of a predatory temperament in the admirer of war. The\r\nenthusiasm for war, and the predatory temper of which it is the index,\r\nprevail in the largest measure among the upper classes, especially\r\namong the hereditary leisure class. Moreover, the ostensible serious\r\noccupation of the upper class is that of government, which, in point of\r\norigin and developmental content, is also a predatory occupation.\r\n\r\nThe only class which could at all dispute with the hereditary leisure\r\nclass the honor of an habitual bellicose frame of mind is that of\r\nthe lower-class delinquents. In ordinary times, the large body of the\r\nindustrial classes is relatively apathetic touching warlike interests.\r\nWhen unexcited, this body of the common people, which makes up the\r\neffective force of the industrial community, is rather averse to any\r\nother than a defensive fight; indeed, it responds a little tardily even\r\nto a provocation which makes for an attitude of defense. In the more\r\ncivilized communities, or rather in the communities which have reached\r\nan advanced industrial development, the spirit of warlike aggression\r\nmay be said to be obsolescent among the common people. This does not\r\nsay that there is not an appreciable number of individuals among\r\nthe industrial classes in whom the martial spirit asserts itself\r\nobtrusively. Nor does it say that the body of the people may not be\r\nfired with martial ardor for a time under the stimulus of some special\r\nprovocation, such as is seen in operation today in more than one of the\r\ncountries of Europe, and for the time in America. But except for such\r\nseasons of temporary exaltation, and except for those individuals who\r\nare endowed with an archaic temperament of the predatory type, together\r\nwith the similarly endowed body of individuals among the higher and\r\nthe lowest classes, the inertness of the mass of any modern civilized\r\ncommunity in this respect is probably so great as would make war\r\nimpracticable, except against actual invasion. The habits and aptitudes\r\nof the common run of men make for an unfolding of activity in other,\r\nless picturesque directions than that of war.\r\n\r\nThis class difference in temperament may be due in part to a difference\r\nin the inheritance of acquired traits in the several classes, but it\r\nseems also, in some measure, to correspond with a difference in ethnic\r\nderivation. The class difference is in this respect visibly less in\r\nthose countries whose population is relatively homogeneous, ethnically,\r\nthan in the countries where there is a broader divergence between the\r\nethnic elements that make up the several classes of the community. In\r\nthe same connection it may be noted that the later accessions to the\r\nleisure class in the latter countries, in a general way, show less of\r\nthe martial spirit than contemporary representatives of the aristocracy\r\nof the ancient line. These nouveaux arriv\xe9s have recently emerged from\r\nthe commonplace body of the population and owe their emergence into the\r\nleisure class to the exercise of traits and propensities which are not\r\nto be classed as prowess in the ancient sense.\r\n\r\nApart from warlike activity proper, the institution of the duel is also\r\nan expression of the same superior readiness for combat; and the duel\r\nis a leisure-class institution. The duel is in substance a more or less\r\ndeliberate resort to a fight as a final settlement of a difference of\r\nopinion. In civilized communities it prevails as a normal phenomenon\r\nonly where there is an hereditary leisure class, and almost exclusively\r\namong that class. The exceptions are (1) military and naval officers\r\nwho are ordinarily members of the leisure class, and who are at the\r\nsame time specially trained to predatory habits of mind and (2) the\r\nlower-class delinquents--who are by inheritance, or training, or both,\r\nof a similarly predatory disposition and habit. It is only the high-bred\r\ngentleman and the rowdy that normally resort to blows as the universal\r\nsolvent of differences of opinion. The plain man will ordinarily fight\r\nonly when excessive momentary irritation or alcoholic exaltation act to\r\ninhibit the more complex habits of response to the stimuli that make\r\nfor provocation. He is then thrown back upon the simpler, less\r\ndifferentiated forms of the instinct of self-assertion; that is to say,\r\nhe reverts temporarily and without reflection to an archaic habit of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThis institution of the duel as a mode of finally settling disputes\r\nand serious questions of precedence shades off into the obligatory,\r\nunprovoked private fight, as a social obligation due to one\'s good\r\nrepute. As a leisure-class usage of this kind we have, particularly,\r\nthat bizarre survival of bellicose chivalry, the German student duel. In\r\nthe lower or spurious leisure class of the delinquents there is in all\r\ncountries a similar, though less formal, social obligation incumbent on\r\nthe rowdy to assert his manhood in unprovoked combat with his fellows.\r\nAnd spreading through all grades of society, a similar usage prevails\r\namong the boys of the community. The boy usually knows to nicety, from\r\nday to day, how he and his associates grade in respect of relative\r\nfighting capacity; and in the community of boys there is ordinarily no\r\nsecure basis of reputability for any one who, by exception, will not or\r\ncan not fight on invitation.\r\n\r\nAll this applies especially to boys above a certain somewhat vague limit\r\nof maturity. The child\'s temperament does not commonly answer to this\r\ndescription during infancy and the years of close tutelage, when the\r\nchild still habitually seeks contact with its mother at every turn of\r\nits daily life. During this earlier period there is little aggression\r\nand little propensity for antagonism. The transition from this\r\npeaceable temper to the predaceous, and in extreme cases malignant,\r\nmischievousness of the boy is a gradual one, and it is accomplished\r\nwith more completeness, covering a larger range of the individual\'s\r\naptitudes, in some cases than in others. In the earlier stage of his\r\ngrowth, the child, whether boy or girl, shows less of initiative and\r\naggressive self-assertion and less of an inclination to isolate himself\r\nand his interests from the domestic group in which he lives, and he\r\nshows more of sensitiveness to rebuke, bashfulness, timidity, and the\r\nneed of friendly human contact. In the common run of cases this early\r\ntemperament passes, by a gradual but somewhat rapid obsolescence of the\r\ninfantile features, into the temperament of the boy proper; though there\r\nare also cases where the predaceous futures of boy life do not emerge at\r\nall, or at the most emerge in but a slight and obscure degree.\r\n\r\nIn girls the transition to the predaceous stage is seldom accomplished\r\nwith the same degree of completeness as in boys; and in a relatively\r\nlarge proportion of cases it is scarcely undergone at all. In such cases\r\nthe transition from infancy to adolescence and maturity is a gradual and\r\nunbroken process of the shifting of interest from infantile purposes and\r\naptitudes to the purposes, functions, and relations of adult life. In\r\nthe girls there is a less general prevalence of a predaceous interval\r\nin the development; and in the cases where it occurs, the predaceous and\r\nisolating attitude during the interval is commonly less accentuated.\r\n\r\nIn the male child the predaceous interval is ordinarily fairly well\r\nmarked and lasts for some time, but it is commonly terminated (if at\r\nall) with the attainment of maturity. This last statement may need very\r\nmaterial qualification. The cases are by no means rare in which the\r\ntransition from the boyish to the adult temperament is not made, or\r\nis made only partially--understanding by the "adult" temperament the\r\naverage temperament of those adult individuals in modern industrial life\r\nwho have some serviceability for the purposes of the collective life\r\nprocess, and who may therefore be said to make up the effective average\r\nof the industrial community.\r\n\r\nThe ethnic composition of the European populations varies. In some\r\ncases even the lower classes are in large measure made up of the\r\npeace-disturbing dolicho-blond; while in others this ethnic element is\r\nfound chiefly among the hereditary leisure class. The fighting habit\r\nseems to prevail to a less extent among the working-class boys in the\r\nlatter class of populations than among the boys of the upper classes or\r\namong those of the populations first named.\r\n\r\nIf this generalization as to the temperament of the boy among the\r\nworking classes should be found true on a fuller and closer scrutiny of\r\nthe field, it would add force to the view that the bellicose temperament\r\nis in some appreciable degree a race characteristic; it appears to\r\nenter more largely into the make-up of the dominant, upper-class\r\nethnic type--the dolicho-blond--of the European countries than into the\r\nsubservient, lower-class types of man which are conceived to constitute\r\nthe body of the population of the same communities.\r\n\r\nThe case of the boy may seem not to bear seriously on the question of\r\nthe relative endowment of prowess with which the several classes of\r\nsociety are gifted; but it is at least of some value as going to show\r\nthat this fighting impulse belongs to a more archaic temperament than\r\nthat possessed by the average adult man of the industrious classes. In\r\nthis, as in many other features of child life, the child reproduces,\r\ntemporarily and in miniature, some of the earlier phases of the\r\ndevelopment of adult man. Under this interpretation, the boy\'s\r\npredilection for exploit and for isolation of his own interest is to be\r\ntaken as a transient reversion to the human nature that is normal to the\r\nearly barbarian culture--the predatory culture proper. In this respect,\r\nas in much else, the leisure-class and the delinquent-class character\r\nshows a persistence into adult life of traits that are normal to\r\nchildhood and youth, and that are likewise normal or habitual to the\r\nearlier stages of culture. Unless the difference is traceable entirely\r\nto a fundamental difference between persistent ethnic types, the traits\r\nthat distinguish the swaggering delinquent and the punctilious gentleman\r\nof leisure from the common crowd are, in some measure, marks of an\r\narrested spiritual development. They mark an immature phase, as compared\r\nwith the stage of development attained by the average of the adults in\r\nthe modern industrial community. And it will appear presently that the\r\npuerile spiritual make-up of these representatives of the upper and the\r\nlowest social strata shows itself also in the presence of other archaic\r\ntraits than this proclivity to ferocious exploit and isolation.\r\n\r\nAs if to leave no doubt about the essential immaturity of the fighting\r\ntemperament, we have, bridging the interval between legitimate boyhood\r\nand adult manhood, the aimless and playful, but more or less systematic\r\nand elaborate, disturbances of the peace in vogue among schoolboys of a\r\nslightly higher age. In the common run of cases, these disturbances\r\nare confined to the period of adolescence. They recur with decreasing\r\nfrequency and acuteness as youth merges into adult life, and so they\r\nreproduce, in a general way, in the life of the individual, the sequence\r\nby which the group has passed from the predatory to a more settled habit\r\nof life. In an appreciable number of cases the spiritual growth of the\r\nindividual comes to a close before he emerges from this puerile\r\nphase; in these cases the fighting temper persists through life. Those\r\nindividuals who in spiritual development eventually reach man\'s\r\nestate, therefore, ordinarily pass through a temporary archaic phase\r\ncorresponding to the permanent spiritual level of the fighting and\r\nsporting men. Different individuals will, of course, achieve spiritual\r\nmaturity and sobriety in this respect in different degrees; and those\r\nwho fail of the average remain as an undissolved residue of crude\r\nhumanity in the modern industrial community and as a foil for that\r\nselective process of adaptation which makes for a heightened industrial\r\nefficiency and the fullness of life of the collectivity. This\r\narrested spiritual development may express itself not only in a direct\r\nparticipation by adults in youthful exploits of ferocity, but also\r\nindirectly in aiding and abetting disturbances of this kind on the\r\npart of younger persons. It thereby furthers the formation of habits of\r\nferocity which may persist in the later life of the growing generation,\r\nand so retard any movement in the direction of a more peaceable\r\neffective temperament on the part of the community. If a person so\r\nendowed with a proclivity for exploits is in a position to guide the\r\ndevelopment of habits in the adolescent members of the community, the\r\ninfluence which he exerts in the direction of conservation and reversion\r\nto prowess may be very considerable. This is the significance, for\r\ninstance, of the fostering care latterly bestowed by many clergymen\r\nand other pillars of society upon "boys\' brigades" and similar\r\npseudo-military organizations. The same is true of the encouragement\r\ngiven to the growth of "college spirit," college athletics, and the\r\nlike, in the higher institutions of learning.\r\n\r\nThese manifestations of the predatory temperament are all to be classed\r\nunder the head of exploit. They are partly simple and unreflected\r\nexpressions of an attitude of emulative ferocity, partly activities\r\ndeliberately entered upon with a view to gaining repute for prowess.\r\nSports of all kinds are of the same general character, including\r\nprize-fights, bull-fights, athletics, shooting, angling, yachting,\r\nand games of skill, even where the element of destructive physical\r\nefficiency is not an obtrusive feature. Sports shade off from the basis\r\nof hostile combat, through skill, to cunning and chicanery, without its\r\nbeing possible to draw a line at any point. The ground of an addiction\r\nto sports is an archaic spiritual constitution--the possession of the\r\npredatory emulative propensity in a relatively high potency, a strong\r\nproclivity to adventuresome exploit and to the infliction of damage is\r\nespecially pronounced in those employments which are in colloquial usage\r\nspecifically called sportsmanship.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps truer, or at least more evident, as regards sports than as\r\nregards the other expressions of predatory emulation already spoken of,\r\nthat the temperament which inclines men to them is essentially a boyish\r\ntemperament. The addiction to sports, therefore, in a peculiar degree\r\nmarks an arrested development of the man\'s moral nature. This peculiar\r\nboyishness of temperament in sporting men immediately becomes apparent\r\nwhen attention is directed to the large element of make-believe that\r\nis present in all sporting activity. Sports share this character of\r\nmake-believe with the games and exploits to which children, especially\r\nboys, are habitually inclined. Make-believe does not enter in the same\r\nproportion into all sports, but it is present in a very appreciable\r\ndegree in all. It is apparently present in a larger measure in\r\nsportsmanship proper and in athletic contests than in set games of skill\r\nof a more sedentary character; although this rule may not be found to\r\napply with any great uniformity. It is noticeable, for instance, that\r\neven very mild-mannered and matter-of-fact men who go out shooting are\r\napt to carry an excess of arms and accoutrements in order to impress\r\nupon their own imagination the seriousness of their undertaking.\r\nThese huntsmen are also prone to a histrionic, prancing gait and to\r\nan elaborate exaggeration of the motions, whether of stealth or of\r\nonslaught, involved in their deeds of exploit. Similarly in athletic\r\nsports there is almost invariably present a good share of rant and\r\nswagger and ostensible mystification--features which mark the histrionic\r\nnature of these employments. In all this, of course, the reminder of\r\nboyish make-believe is plain enough. The slang of athletics, by the way,\r\nis in great part made up of extremely sanguinary locutions borrowed from\r\nthe terminology of warfare. Except where it is adopted as a necessary\r\nmeans of secret communication, the use of a special slang in any\r\nemployment is probably to be accepted as evidence that the occupation in\r\nquestion is substantially make-believe.\r\n\r\nA further feature in which sports differ from the duel and similar\r\ndisturbances of the peace is the peculiarity that they admit of other\r\nmotives being assigned for them besides the impulses of exploit and\r\nferocity. There is probably little if any other motive present in any\r\ngiven case, but the fact that other reasons for indulging in sports are\r\nfrequently assigned goes to say that other grounds are sometimes present\r\nin a subsidiary way. Sportsmen--hunters and anglers--are more or less in\r\nthe habit of assigning a love of nature, the need of recreation, and the\r\nlike, as the incentives to their favorite pastime. These motives are no\r\ndoubt frequently present and make up a part of the attractiveness of\r\nthe sportsman\'s life; but these can not be the chief incentives. These\r\nostensible needs could be more readily and fully satisfied without the\r\naccompaniment of a systematic effort to take the life of those creatures\r\nthat make up an essential feature of that "nature" that is beloved\r\nby the sportsman. It is, indeed, the most noticeable effect of the\r\nsportsman\'s activity to keep nature in a state of chronic desolation by\r\nkilling off all living thing whose destruction he can compass.\r\n\r\nStill, there is ground for the sportsman\'s claim that under the existing\r\nconventionalities his need of recreation and of contact with nature can\r\nbest be satisfied by the course which he takes. Certain canons of good\r\nbreeding have been imposed by the prescriptive example of a predatory\r\nleisure class in the past and have been somewhat painstakingly conserved\r\nby the usage of the latter-day representatives of that class; and these\r\ncanons will not permit him, without blame, to seek contact with nature\r\non other terms. From being an honorable employment handed down from the\r\npredatory culture as the highest form of everyday leisure, sports have\r\ncome to be the only form of outdoor activity that has the full sanction\r\nof decorum. Among the proximate incentives to shooting and angling,\r\nthen, may be the need of recreation and outdoor life. The remoter cause\r\nwhich imposes the necessity of seeking these objects under the cover of\r\nsystematic slaughter is a prescription that can not be violated except\r\nat the risk of disrepute and consequent lesion to one\'s self-respect.\r\n\r\nThe case of other kinds of sport is somewhat similar. Of these, athletic\r\ngames are the best example. Prescriptive usage with respect to what\r\nforms of activity, exercise, and recreation are permissible under the\r\ncode of reputable living is of course present here also. Those who are\r\naddicted to athletic sports, or who admire them, set up the claim that\r\nthese afford the best available means of recreation and of "physical\r\nculture." And prescriptive usage gives countenance to the claim. The\r\ncanons of reputable living exclude from the scheme of life of the\r\nleisure class all activity that can not be classed as conspicuous\r\nleisure. And consequently they tend by prescription to exclude it also\r\nfrom the scheme of life of the community generally. At the same\r\ntime purposeless physical exertion is tedious and distasteful beyond\r\ntolerance. As has been noticed in another connection, recourse is in\r\nsuch a case had to some form of activity which shall at least afford\r\na colorable pretense of purpose, even if the object assigned be only a\r\nmake-believe. Sports satisfy these requirements of substantial futility\r\ntogether with a colorable make-believe of purpose. In addition to\r\nthis they afford scope for emulation, and are attractive also on that\r\naccount. In order to be decorous, an employment must conform to the\r\nleisure-class canon of reputable waste; at the same time all activity,\r\nin order to be persisted in as an habitual, even if only partial,\r\nexpression of life, must conform to the generically human canon of\r\nefficiency for some serviceable objective end. The leisure-class canon\r\ndemands strict and comprehensive futility, the instinct of workmanship\r\ndemands purposeful action. The leisure-class canon of decorum acts\r\nslowly and pervasively, by a selective elimination of all substantially\r\nuseful or purposeful modes of action from the accredited scheme of\r\nlife; the instinct of workmanship acts impulsively and may be satisfied,\r\nprovisionally, with a proximate purpose. It is only as the apprehended\r\nulterior futility of a given line of action enters the reflective\r\ncomplex of consciousness as an element essentially alien to the normally\r\npurposeful trend of the life process that its disquieting and deterrent\r\neffect on the consciousness of the agent is wrought.\r\n\r\nThe individual\'s habits of thought make an organic complex, the trend\r\nof which is necessarily in the direction of serviceability to the\r\nlife process. When it is attempted to assimilate systematic waste or\r\nfutility, as an end in life, into this organic complex, there presently\r\nsupervenes a revulsion. But this revulsion of the organism may be\r\navoided if the attention can be confined to the proximate, unreflected\r\npurpose of dexterous or emulative exertion. Sports--hunting, angling,\r\nathletic games, and the like--afford an exercise for dexterity and for\r\nthe emulative ferocity and astuteness characteristic of predatory life.\r\nSo long as the individual is but slightly gifted with reflection or\r\nwith a sense of the ulterior trend of his actions so long as his life\r\nis substantially a life of naive impulsive action--so long the immediate\r\nand unreflected purposefulness of sports, in the way of an expression of\r\ndominance, will measurably satisfy his instinct of workmanship. This is\r\nespecially true if his dominant impulses are the unreflecting emulative\r\npropensities of the predaceous temperament. At the same time the canons\r\nof decorum will commend sports to him as expressions of a pecuniarily\r\nblameless life. It is by meeting these two requirements, of ulterior\r\nwastefulness and proximate purposefulness, that any given employment\r\nholds its place as a traditional and habitual mode of decorous\r\nrecreation. In the sense that other forms of recreation and exercise\r\nare morally impossible to persons of good breeding and delicate\r\nsensibilities, then, sports are the best available means of recreation\r\nunder existing circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut those members of respectable society who advocate athletic games\r\ncommonly justify their attitude on this head to themselves and to their\r\nneighbors on the ground that these games serve as an invaluable means of\r\ndevelopment. They not only improve the contestant\'s physique, but it\r\nis commonly added that they also foster a manly spirit, both in the\r\nparticipants and in the spectators. Football is the particular game\r\nwhich will probably first occur to any one in this community when the\r\nquestion of the serviceability of athletic games is raised, as this form\r\nof athletic contest is at present uppermost in the mind of those who\r\nplead for or against games as a means of physical or moral salvation.\r\nThis typical athletic sport may, therefore, serve to illustrate the\r\nbearing of athletics upon the development of the contestant\'s character\r\nand physique. It has been said, not inaptly, that the relation of\r\nfootball to physical culture is much the same as that of the bull-fight\r\nto agriculture. Serviceability for these lusory institutions requires\r\nsedulous training or breeding. The material used, whether brute or\r\nhuman, is subjected to careful selection and discipline, in order to\r\nsecure and accentuate certain aptitudes and propensities which are\r\ncharacteristic of the ferine state, and which tend to obsolescence under\r\ndomestication. This does not mean that the result in either case is\r\nan all around and consistent rehabilitation of the ferine or barbarian\r\nhabit of mind and body. The result is rather a one-sided return to\r\nbarbarism or to the feroe natura--a rehabilitation and accentuation\r\nof those ferine traits which make for damage and desolation, without\r\na corresponding development of the traits which would serve the\r\nindividual\'s self-preservation and fullness of life in a ferine\r\nenvironment. The culture bestowed in football gives a product of exotic\r\nferocity and cunning. It is a rehabilitation of the early barbarian\r\ntemperament, together with a suppression of those details of\r\ntemperament, which, as seen from the standpoint of the social and\r\neconomic exigencies, are the redeeming features of the savage character.\r\n\r\nThe physical vigor acquired in the training for athletic games--so far\r\nas the training may be said to have this effect--is of advantage both\r\nto the individual and to the collectivity, in that, other things being\r\nequal, it conduces to economic serviceability. The spiritual traits\r\nwhich go with athletic sports are likewise economically advantageous\r\nto the individual, as contradistinguished from the interests of the\r\ncollectivity. This holds true in any community where these traits are\r\npresent in some degree in the population. Modern competition is in\r\nlarge part a process of self-assertion on the basis of these traits of\r\npredatory human nature. In the sophisticated form in which they enter\r\ninto the modern, peaceable emulation, the possession of these traits\r\nin some measure is almost a necessary of life to the civilized man. But\r\nwhile they are indispensable to the competitive individual, they are\r\nnot directly serviceable to the community. So far as regards the\r\nserviceability of the individual for the purposes of the collective\r\nlife, emulative efficiency is of use only indirectly if at all. Ferocity\r\nand cunning are of no use to the community except in its hostile\r\ndealings with other communities; and they are useful to the individual\r\nonly because there is so large a proportion of the same traits actively\r\npresent in the human environment to which he is exposed. Any individual\r\nwho enters the competitive struggle without the due endowment of these\r\ntraits is at a disadvantage, somewhat as a hornless steer would find\r\nhimself at a disadvantage in a drove of horned cattle.\r\n\r\nThe possession and the cultivation of the predatory traits of character\r\nmay, of course, be desirable on other than economic grounds. There is a\r\nprevalent aesthetic or ethical predilection for the barbarian aptitudes,\r\nand the traits in question minister so effectively to this predilection\r\nthat their serviceability in the aesthetic or ethical respect probably\r\noffsets any economic unserviceability which they may give. But for the\r\npresent purpose that is beside the point. Therefore nothing is said here\r\nas to the desirability or advisability of sports on the whole, or as to\r\ntheir value on other than economic grounds.\r\n\r\nIn popular apprehension there is much that is admirable in the type\r\nof manhood which the life of sport fosters. There is self-reliance and\r\ngood-fellowship, so termed in the somewhat loose colloquial use of\r\nthe words. From a different point of view the qualities currently so\r\ncharacterized might be described as truculence and clannishness. The\r\nreason for the current approval and admiration of these manly qualities,\r\nas well as for their being called manly, is the same as the reason for\r\ntheir usefulness to the individual. The members of the community, and\r\nespecially that class of the community which sets the pace in canons of\r\ntaste, are endowed with this range of propensities in sufficient measure\r\nto make their absence in others felt as a shortcoming, and to make\r\ntheir possession in an exceptional degree appreciated as an attribute of\r\nsuperior merit. The traits of predatory man are by no means obsolete in\r\nthe common run of modern populations. They are present and can be called\r\nout in bold relief at any time by any appeal to the sentiments in\r\nwhich they express themselves--unless this appeal should clash with the\r\nspecific activities that make up our habitual occupations and comprise\r\nthe general range of our everyday interests. The common run of the\r\npopulation of any industrial community is emancipated from these,\r\neconomically considered, untoward propensities only in the sense\r\nthat, through partial and temporary disuse, they have lapsed into the\r\nbackground of sub-conscious motives. With varying degrees of potency in\r\ndifferent individuals, they remain available for the aggressive shaping\r\nof men\'s actions and sentiments whenever a stimulus of more than\r\neveryday intensity comes in to call them forth. And they assert\r\nthemselves forcibly in any case where no occupation alien to the\r\npredatory culture has usurped the individual\'s everyday range of\r\ninterest and sentiment. This is the case among the leisure class and\r\namong certain portions of the population which are ancillary to that\r\nclass. Hence the facility with which any new accessions to the leisure\r\nclass take to sports; and hence the rapid growth of sports and of\r\nthe sporting sentient in any industrial community where wealth has\r\naccumulated sufficiently to exempt a considerable part of the population\r\nfrom work.\r\n\r\nA homely and familiar fact may serve to show that the predaceous impulse\r\ndoes not prevail in the same degree in all classes. Taken simply as a\r\nfeature of modern life, the habit of carrying a walking-stick may seem\r\nat best a trivial detail; but the usage has a significance for the point\r\nin question. The classes among whom the habit most prevails--the classes\r\nwith whom the walking-stick is associated in popular apprehension--are\r\nthe men of the leisure class proper, sporting men, and the lower-class\r\ndelinquents. To these might perhaps be added the men engaged in the\r\npecuniary employments. The same is not true of the common run of men\r\nengaged in industry and it may be noted by the way that women do not\r\ncarry a stick except in case of infirmity, where it has a use of a\r\ndifferent kind. The practice is of course in great measure a matter\r\nof polite usage; but the basis of polite usage is, in turn, the\r\nproclivities of the class which sets the pace in polite usage. The\r\nwalking-stick serves the purpose of an advertisement that the bearer\'s\r\nhands are employed otherwise than in useful effort, and it therefore has\r\nutility as an evidence of leisure. But it is also a weapon, and it meets\r\na felt need of barbarian man on that ground. The handling of so tangible\r\nand primitive a means of offense is very comforting to any one who is\r\ngifted with even a moderate share of ferocity. The exigencies of\r\nthe language make it impossible to avoid an apparent implication of\r\ndisapproval of the aptitudes, propensities, and expressions of life here\r\nunder discussion. It is, however, not intended to imply anything in the\r\nway of deprecation or commendation of any one of these phases of human\r\ncharacter or of the life process. The various elements of the prevalent\r\nhuman nature are taken up from the point of view of economic theory,\r\nand the traits discussed are gauged and graded with regard to their\r\nimmediate economic bearing on the facility of the collective life\r\nprocess. That is to say, these phenomena are here apprehended from\r\nthe economic point of view and are valued with respect to their direct\r\naction in furtherance or hindrance of a more perfect adjustment of the\r\nhuman collectivity to the environment and to the institutional structure\r\nrequired by the economic situation of the collectivity for the present\r\nand for the immediate future. For these purposes the traits handed down\r\nfrom the predatory culture are less serviceable than might be. Although\r\neven in this connection it is not to be overlooked that the energetic\r\naggressiveness and pertinacity of predatory man is a heritage of no mean\r\nvalue. The economic value--with some regard also to the social value in\r\nthe narrower sense--of these aptitudes and propensities is attempted to\r\nbe passed upon without reflecting on their value as seen from another\r\npoint of view. When contrasted with the prosy mediocrity of the\r\nlatter-day industrial scheme of life, and judged by the accredited\r\nstandards of morality, and more especially by the standards of\r\naesthetics and of poetry, these survivals from a more primitive type of\r\nmanhood may have a very different value from that here assigned them.\r\nBut all this being foreign to the purpose in hand, no expression\r\nof opinion on this latter head would be in place here. All that is\r\nadmissible is to enter the caution that these standards of excellence,\r\nwhich are alien to the present purpose, must not be allowed to influence\r\nour economic appreciation of these traits of human character or of the\r\nactivities which foster their growth. This applies both as regards those\r\npersons who actively participate in sports and those whose sporting\r\nexperience consists in contemplation only. What is here said of\r\nthe sporting propensity is likewise pertinent to sundry reflections\r\npresently to be made in this connection on what would colloquially be\r\nknown as the religious life.\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph incidentally touches upon the fact that everyday\r\nspeech can scarcely be employed in discussing this class of aptitudes\r\nand activities without implying deprecation or apology. The fact is\r\nsignificant as showing the habitual attitude of the dispassionate common\r\nman toward the propensities which express themselves in sports and in\r\nexploit generally. And this is perhaps as convenient a place as any\r\nto discuss that undertone of deprecation which runs through all the\r\nvoluminous discourse in defense or in laudation of athletic sports, as\r\nwell as of other activities of a predominantly predatory character. The\r\nsame apologetic frame of mind is at least beginning to be observable in\r\nthe spokesmen of most other institutions handed down from the barbarian\r\nphase of life. Among these archaic institutions which are felt to need\r\napology are comprised, with others, the entire existing system of the\r\ndistribution of wealth, together with the resulting class distinction of\r\nstatus; all or nearly all forms of consumption that come under the head\r\nof conspicuous waste; the status of women under the patriarchal system;\r\nand many features of the traditional creeds and devout observances,\r\nespecially the exoteric expressions of the creed and the naive\r\napprehension of received observances. What is to be said in this\r\nconnection of the apologetic attitude taken in commending sports and\r\nthe sporting character will therefore apply, with a suitable change in\r\nphraseology, to the apologies offered in behalf of these other, related\r\nelements of our social heritage.\r\n\r\nThere is a feeling--usually vague and not commonly avowed in so many\r\nwords by the apologist himself, but ordinarily perceptible in the manner\r\nof his discourse--that these sports, as well as the general range of\r\npredaceous impulses and habits of thought which underlie the sporting\r\ncharacter, do not altogether commend themselves to common sense. "As\r\nto the majority of murderers, they are very incorrect characters." This\r\naphorism offers a valuation of the predaceous temperament, and of the\r\ndisciplinary effects of its overt expression and exercise, as seen from\r\nthe moralist\'s point of view. As such it affords an indication of what\r\nis the deliverance of the sober sense of mature men as to the degree\r\nof availability of the predatory habit of mind for the purposes of the\r\ncollective life. It is felt that the presumption is against any activity\r\nwhich involves habituation to the predatory attitude, and that the\r\nburden of proof lies with those who speak for the rehabilitation of the\r\npredaceous temper and for the practices which strengthen it. There is a\r\nstrong body of popular sentiment in favor of diversions and enterprises\r\nof the kind in question; but there is at the same time present in\r\nthe community a pervading sense that this ground of sentiment wants\r\nlegitimation. The required legitimation is ordinarily sought by\r\nshowing that although sports are substantially of a predatory, socially\r\ndisintegrating effect; although their proximate effect runs in\r\nthe direction of reversion to propensities that are industrially\r\ndisserviceable; yet indirectly and remotely--by some not readily\r\ncomprehensible process of polar induction, or counter-irritation\r\nperhaps--sports are conceived to foster a habit of mind that is\r\nserviceable for the social or industrial purpose. That is to say,\r\nalthough sports are essentially of the nature of invidious exploit, it\r\nis presumed that by some remote and obscure effect they result in the\r\ngrowth of a temperament conducive to non-invidious work. It is commonly\r\nattempted to show all this empirically or it is rather assumed that this\r\nis the empirical generalization which must be obvious to any one who\r\ncares to see it. In conducting the proof of this thesis the treacherous\r\nground of inference from cause to effect is somewhat shrewdly avoided,\r\nexcept so far as to show that the "manly virtues" spoken of above\r\nare fostered by sports. But since it is these manly virtues that are\r\n(economically) in need of legitimation, the chain of proof breaks\r\noff where it should begin. In the most general economic terms, these\r\napologies are an effort to show that, in spite of the logic of the\r\nthing, sports do in fact further what may broadly be called workmanship.\r\nSo long as he has not succeeded in persuading himself or others that\r\nthis is their effect the thoughtful apologist for sports will not rest\r\ncontent, and commonly, it is to be admitted, he does not rest content.\r\nHis discontent with his own vindication of the practice in question is\r\nordinarily shown by his truculent tone and by the eagerness with which\r\nhe heaps up asseverations in support of his position. But why are\r\napologies needed? If there prevails a body of popular sentient in\r\nfavor of sports, why is not that fact a sufficient legitimation? The\r\nprotracted discipline of prowess to which the race has been subjected\r\nunder the predatory and quasi-peaceable culture has transmitted to the\r\nmen of today a temperament that finds gratification in these expressions\r\nof ferocity and cunning. So, why not accept these sports as legitimate\r\nexpressions of a normal and wholesome human nature? What other norm is\r\nthere that is to be lived up to than that given in the aggregate range\r\nof propensities that express themselves in the sentiments of this\r\ngeneration, including the hereditary strain of prowess? The ulterior\r\nnorm to which appeal is taken is the instinct of workmanship, which is\r\nan instinct more fundamental, of more ancient prescription, than\r\nthe propensity to predatory emulation. The latter is but a special\r\ndevelopment of the instinct of workmanship, a variant, relatively late\r\nand ephemeral in spite of its great absolute antiquity. The emulative\r\npredatory impulse--or the instinct of sportsmanship, as it might well\r\nbe called--is essentially unstable in comparison with the primordial\r\ninstinct of workmanship out of which it has been developed and\r\ndifferentiated. Tested by this ulterior norm of life, predatory\r\nemulation, and therefore the life of sports, falls short.\r\n\r\nThe manner and the measure in which the institution of a leisure class\r\nconduces to the conservation of sports and invidious exploit can of\r\ncourse not be succinctly stated. From the evidence already recited it\r\nappears that, in sentient and inclinations, the leisure class is more\r\nfavorable to a warlike attitude and animus than the industrial classes.\r\nSomething similar seems to be true as regards sports. But it is chiefly\r\nin its indirect effects, though the canons of decorous living, that the\r\ninstitution has its influence on the prevalent sentiment with respect to\r\nthe sporting life. This indirect effect goes almost unequivocally in\r\nthe direction of furthering a survival of the predatory temperament\r\nand habits; and this is true even with respect to those variants of\r\nthe sporting life which the higher leisure-class code of proprieties\r\nproscribes; as, e.g., prize-fighting, cock-fighting, and other\r\nlike vulgar expressions of the sporting temper. Whatever the latest\r\nauthenticated schedule of detail proprieties may say, the accredited\r\ncanons of decency sanctioned by the institution say without equivocation\r\nthat emulation and waste are good and their opposites are disreputable.\r\nIn the crepuscular light of the social nether spaces the details of the\r\ncode are not apprehended with all the facility that might be desired,\r\nand these broad underlying canons of decency are therefore applied\r\nsomewhat unreflectingly, with little question as to the scope of their\r\ncompetence or the exceptions that have been sanctioned in detail.\r\n\r\nAddiction to athletic sports, not only in the way of direct\r\nparticipation, but also in the way of sentiment and moral support, is,\r\nin a more or less pronounced degree, a characteristic of the leisure\r\nclass; and it is a trait which that class shares with the lower-class\r\ndelinquents, and with such atavistic elements throughout the body of\r\nthe community as are endowed with a dominant predaceous trend. Few\r\nindividuals among the populations of Western civilized countries are\r\nso far devoid of the predaceous instinct as to find no diversion in\r\ncontemplating athletic sports and games, but with the common run of\r\nindividuals among the industrial classes the inclination to sports\r\ndoes not assert itself to the extent of constituting what may fairly\r\nbe called a sporting habit. With these classes sports are an occasional\r\ndiversion rather than a serious feature of life. This common body of the\r\npeople can therefore not be said to cultivate the sporting propensity.\r\nAlthough it is not obsolete in the average of them, or even in any\r\nappreciable number of individuals, yet the predilection for sports in\r\nthe commonplace industrial classes is of the nature of a reminiscence,\r\nmore or less diverting as an occasional interest, rather than a vital\r\nand permanent interest that counts as a dominant factor in shaping\r\nthe organic complex of habits of thought into which it enters. As it\r\nmanifests itself in the sporting life of today, this propensity may not\r\nappear to be an economic factor of grave consequence. Taken simply by\r\nitself it does not count for a great deal in its direct effects on the\r\nindustrial efficiency or the consumption of any given individual; but\r\nthe prevalence and the growth of the type of human nature of which this\r\npropensity is a characteristic feature is a matter of some consequence.\r\nIt affects the economic life of the collectivity both as regards the\r\nrate of economic development and as regards the character of the results\r\nattained by the development. For better or worse, the fact that the\r\npopular habits of thought are in any degree dominated by this type of\r\ncharacter can not but greatly affect the scope, direction, standards,\r\nand ideals of the collective economic life, as well as the degree of\r\nadjustment of the collective life to the environment.\r\n\r\nSomething to a like effect is to be said of other traits that go to make\r\nup the barbarian character. For the purposes of economic theory, these\r\nfurther barbarian traits may be taken as concomitant variations of that\r\npredaceous temper of which prowess is an expression. In great measure\r\nthey are not primarily of an economic character, nor do they have much\r\ndirect economic bearing. They serve to indicate the stage of economic\r\nevolution to which the individual possessed of them is adapted. They\r\nare of importance, therefore, as extraneous tests of the degree of\r\nadaptation of the character in which they are comprised to the economic\r\nexigencies of today, but they are also to some extent important as\r\nbeing aptitudes which themselves go to increase or diminish the economic\r\nserviceability of the individual.\r\n\r\nAs it finds expression in the life of the barbarian, prowess manifests\r\nitself in two main directions--force and fraud. In varying degrees these\r\ntwo forms of expression are similarly present in modern warfare, in the\r\npecuniary occupations, and in sports and games. Both lines of aptitudes\r\nare cultivated and strengthened by the life of sport as well as by the\r\nmore serious forms of emulative life. Strategy or cunning is an element\r\ninvariably present in games, as also in warlike pursuits and in the\r\nchase. In all of these employments strategy tends to develop into\r\nfinesse and chicanery. Chicanery, falsehood, browbeating, hold a\r\nwell-secured place in the method of procedure of any athletic contest\r\nand in games generally. The habitual employment of an umpire, and\r\nthe minute technical regulations governing the limits and details of\r\npermissible fraud and strategic advantage, sufficiently attest the fact\r\nthat fraudulent practices and attempts to overreach one\'s opponents\r\nare not adventitious features of the game. In the nature of the case\r\nhabituation to sports should conduce to a fuller development of\r\nthe aptitude for fraud; and the prevalence in the community of that\r\npredatory temperament which inclines men to sports connotes a prevalence\r\nof sharp practice and callous disregard of the interests of others,\r\nindividually and collectively. Resort to fraud, in any guise and under\r\nany legitimation of law or custom, is an expression of a narrowly\r\nself-regarding habit of mind. It is needless to dwell at any length on\r\nthe economic value of this feature of the sporting character.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is to be noted that the most obvious\r\ncharacteristic of the physiognomy affected by athletic and other\r\nsporting men is that of an extreme astuteness. The gifts and exploits\r\nof Ulysses are scarcely second to those of Achilles, either in their\r\nsubstantial furtherance of the game or in the \xe9clat which they give the\r\nastute sporting man among his associates. The pantomime of astuteness\r\nis commonly the first step in that assimilation to the professional\r\nsporting man which a youth undergoes after matriculation in any\r\nreputable school, of the secondary or the higher education, as the case\r\nmay be. And the physiognomy of astuteness, as a decorative feature,\r\nnever ceases to receive the thoughtful attention of men whose serious\r\ninterest lies in athletic games, races, or other contests of a similar\r\nemulative nature. As a further indication of their spiritual kinship,\r\nit may be pointed out that the members of the lower delinquent class\r\nusually show this physiognomy of astuteness in a marked degree, and that\r\nthey very commonly show the same histrionic exaggeration of it that is\r\noften seen in the young candidate for athletic honors. This, by the\r\nway, is the most legible mark of what is vulgarly called "toughness" in\r\nyouthful aspirants for a bad name.\r\n\r\nThe astute man, it may be remarked, is of no economic value to the\r\ncommunity--unless it be for the purpose of sharp practice in dealings\r\nwith other communities. His functioning is not a furtherance of the\r\ngeneric life process. At its best, in its direct economic bearing, it is\r\na conversion of the economic substance of the collectivity to a growth\r\nalien to the collective life process--very much after the analogy of\r\nwhat in medicine would be called a benign tumor, with some tendency to\r\ntransgress the uncertain line that divides the benign from the malign\r\ngrowths. The two barbarian traits, ferocity and astuteness, go to make\r\nup the predaceous temper or spiritual attitude. They are the expressions\r\nof a narrowly self-regarding habit of mind. Both are highly serviceable\r\nfor individual expediency in a life looking to invidious success. Both\r\nalso have a high aesthetic value. Both are fostered by the pecuniary\r\nculture. But both alike are of no use for the purposes of the collective\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Eleven ~~ The Belief in Luck\r\n\r\nThe gambling propensity is another subsidiary trait of the barbarian\r\ntemperament. It is a concomitant variation of character of almost\r\nuniversal prevalence among sporting men and among men given to warlike\r\nand emulative activities generally. This trait also has a direct\r\neconomic value. It is recognized to be a hindrance to the highest\r\nindustrial efficiency of the aggregate in any community where it\r\nprevails in an appreciable degree. The gambling proclivity is doubtfully\r\nto be classed as a feature belonging exclusively to the predatory type\r\nof human nature. The chief factor in the gambling habit is the belief in\r\nluck; and this belief is apparently traceable, at least in its elements,\r\nto a stage in human evolution antedating the predatory culture. It may\r\nwell have been under the predatory culture that the belief in luck was\r\ndeveloped into the form in which it is present, as the chief element of\r\nthe gambling proclivity, in the sporting temperament. It probably owes\r\nthe specific form under which it occurs in the modern culture to the\r\npredatory discipline. But the belief in luck is in substance a habit\r\nof more ancient date than the predatory culture. It is one form of the\r\nartistic apprehension of things. The belief seems to be a trait carried\r\nover in substance from an earlier phase into the barbarian culture,\r\nand transmuted and transmitted through that culture to a later stage\r\nof human development under a specific form imposed by the predatory\r\ndiscipline. But in any case, it is to be taken as an archaic trait,\r\ninherited from a more or less remote past, more or less incompatible\r\nwith the requirements of the modern industrial process, and more or less\r\nof a hindrance to the fullest efficiency of the collective economic life\r\nof the present.\r\n\r\nWhile the belief in luck is the basis of the gambling habit, it is not\r\nthe only element that enters into the habit of betting. Betting on the\r\nissue of contests of strength and skill proceeds on a further motive,\r\nwithout which the belief in luck would scarcely come in as a prominent\r\nfeature of sporting life. This further motive is the desire of the\r\nanticipated winner, or the partisan of the anticipated winning side, to\r\nheighten his side\'s ascendency at the cost of the loser. Not only does\r\nthe stronger side score a more signal victory, and the losing side\r\nsuffer a more painful and humiliating defeat, in proportion as the\r\npecuniary gain and loss in the wager is large; although this alone is\r\na consideration of material weight. But the wager is commonly laid also\r\nwith a view, not avowed in words nor even recognized in set terms in\r\npetto, to enhancing the chances of success for the contestant on which\r\nit is laid. It is felt that substance and solicitude expended to\r\nthis end can not go for naught in the issue. There is here a special\r\nmanifestation of the instinct of workmanship, backed by an even more\r\nmanifest sense that the animistic congruity of things must decide for a\r\nvictorious outcome for the side in whose behalf the propensity inherent\r\nin events has been propitiated and fortified by so much of conative\r\nand kinetic urging. This incentive to the wager expresses itself freely\r\nunder the form of backing one\'s favorite in any contest, and it is\r\nunmistakably a predatory feature. It is as ancillary to the predaceous\r\nimpulse proper that the belief in luck expresses itself in a wager. So\r\nthat it may be set down that in so far as the belief in luck comes\r\nto expression in the form of laying a wager, it is to be accounted an\r\nintegral element of the predatory type of character. The belief is, in\r\nits elements, an archaic habit which belongs substantially to early,\r\nundifferentiated human nature; but when this belief is helped out by the\r\npredatory emulative impulse, and so is differentiated into the specific\r\nform of the gambling habit, it is, in this higher-developed and specific\r\nform, to be classed as a trait of the barbarian character.\r\n\r\nThe belief in luck is a sense of fortuitous necessity in the sequence\r\nof phenomena. In its various mutations and expressions, it is of very\r\nserious importance for the economic efficiency of any community in which\r\nit prevails to an appreciable extent. So much so as to warrant a more\r\ndetailed discussion of its origin and content and of the bearing of its\r\nvarious ramifications upon economic structure and function, as well as\r\na discussion of the relation of the leisure class to its growth,\r\ndifferentiation, and persistence. In the developed, integrated form\r\nin which it is most readily observed in the barbarian of the predatory\r\nculture or in the sporting man of modern communities, the belief\r\ncomprises at least two distinguishable elements--which are to be taken\r\nas two different phases of the same fundamental habit of thought, or as\r\nthe same psychological factor in two successive phases of its evolution.\r\nThe fact that these two elements are successive phases of the same\r\ngeneral line of growth of belief does not hinder their coexisting in the\r\nhabits of thought of any given individual. The more primitive form\r\n(or the more archaic phase) is an incipient animistic belief, or an\r\nanimistic sense of relations and things, that imputes a quasi-personal\r\ncharacter to facts. To the archaic man all the obtrusive and obviously\r\nconsequential objects and facts in his environment have a quasi-personal\r\nindividuality. They are conceived to be possessed of volition, or rather\r\nof propensities, which enter into the complex of causes and affect\r\nevents in an inscrutable manner. The sporting man\'s sense of luck and\r\nchance, or of fortuitous necessity, is an inarticulate or inchoate\r\nanimism. It applies to objects and situations, often in a very vague\r\nway; but it is usually so far defined as to imply the possibility of\r\npropitiating, or of deceiving and cajoling, or otherwise disturbing the\r\nholding of propensities resident in the objects which constitute the\r\napparatus and accessories of any game of skill or chance. There are few\r\nsporting men who are not in the habit of wearing charms or talismans to\r\nwhich more or less of efficacy is felt to belong. And the proportion is\r\nnot much less of those who instinctively dread the "hoodooing" of the\r\ncontestants or the apparatus engaged in any contest on which they lay a\r\nwager; or who feel that the fact of their backing a given contestant or\r\nside in the game does and ought to strengthen that side; or to whom the\r\n"mascot" which they cultivate means something more than a jest.\r\n\r\nIn its simple form the belief in luck is this instinctive sense of an\r\ninscrutable teleological propensity in objects or situations. Objects or\r\nevents have a propensity to eventuate in a given end, whether this end\r\nor objective point of the sequence is conceived to be fortuitously given\r\nor deliberately sought. From this simple animism the belief shades off\r\nby insensible gradations into the second, derivative form or phase above\r\nreferred to, which is a more or less articulate belief in an inscrutable\r\npreternatural agency. The preternatural agency works through the visible\r\nobjects with which it is associated, but is not identified with these\r\nobjects in point of individuality. The use of the term "preternatural\r\nagency" here carries no further implication as to the nature of the\r\nagency spoken of as preternatural. This is only a farther development of\r\nanimistic belief. The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived\r\nto be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which\r\npartakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat\r\narbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially\r\nof any contest. The pervading belief in the hamingia or gipta\r\n(gaefa, authna) which lends so much of color to the Icelandic sagas\r\nspecifically, and to early Germanic folk-legends, is an illustration of\r\nthis sense of an extra-physical propensity in the course of events.\r\n\r\nIn this expression or form of the belief the propensity is scarcely\r\npersonified although to a varying extent an individuality is imputed to\r\nit; and this individuated propensity is sometimes conceived to yield to\r\ncircumstances, commonly to circumstances of a spiritual or preternatural\r\ncharacter. A well-known and striking exemplification of the belief--in\r\na fairly advanced stage of differentiation and involving an\r\nanthropomorphic personification of the preternatural agent appealed\r\nto--is afforded by the wager of battle. Here the preternatural agent was\r\nconceived to act on request as umpire, and to shape the outcome of the\r\ncontest in accordance with some stipulated ground of decision, such as\r\nthe equity or legality of the respective contestants\' claims. The like\r\nsense of an inscrutable but spiritually necessary tendency in events\r\nis still traceable as an obscure element in current popular belief, as\r\nshown, for instance, by the well-accredited maxim, "Thrice is he\r\narmed who knows his quarrel just,"--a maxim which retains much of its\r\nsignificance for the average unreflecting person even in the civilized\r\ncommunities of today. The modern reminiscence of the belief in the\r\nhamingia, or in the guidance of an unseen hand, which is traceable in\r\nthe acceptance of this maxim is faint and perhaps uncertain; and it\r\nseems in any case to be blended with other psychological moments that\r\nare not clearly of an animistic character.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose in hand it is unnecessary to look more closely into the\r\npsychological process or the ethnological line of descent by which the\r\nlater of these two animistic apprehensions of propensity is derived\r\nfrom the earlier. This question may be of the gravest importance to\r\nfolk-psychology or to the theory of the evolution of creeds and cults.\r\nThe same is true of the more fundamental question whether the two\r\nare related at all as successive phases in a sequence of development.\r\nReference is here made to the existence of these questions only to\r\nremark that the interest of the present discussion does not lie in that\r\ndirection. So far as concerns economic theory, these two elements or\r\nphases of the belief in luck, or in an extra-causal trend or propensity\r\nin things, are of substantially the same character. They have an\r\neconomic significance as habits of thought which affect the individual\'s\r\nhabitual view of the facts and sequences with which he comes in contact,\r\nand which thereby affect the individual\'s serviceability for the\r\nindustrial purpose. Therefore, apart from all question of the beauty,\r\nworth, or beneficence of any animistic belief, there is place for\r\na discussion of their economic bearing on the serviceability of the\r\nindividual as an economic factor, and especially as an industrial agent.\r\n\r\nIt has already been noted in an earlier connection, that in order to\r\nhave the highest serviceability in the complex industrial processes of\r\ntoday, the individual must be endowed with the aptitude and the habit\r\nof readily apprehending and relating facts in terms of causal sequence.\r\nBoth as a whole and in its details, the industrial process is a process\r\nof quantitative causation. The "intelligence" demanded of the workman,\r\nas well as of the director of an industrial process, is little else\r\nthan a degree of facility in the apprehension of and adaptation to a\r\nquantitatively determined causal sequence. This facility of apprehension\r\nand adaptation is what is lacking in stupid workmen, and the growth\r\nof this facility is the end sought in their education--so far as their\r\neducation aims to enhance their industrial efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn so far as the individual\'s inherited aptitudes or his training\r\nincline him to account for facts and sequences in other terms than those\r\nof causation or matter-of-fact, they lower his productive efficiency or\r\nindustrial usefulness. This lowering of efficiency through a penchant\r\nfor animistic methods of apprehending facts is especially apparent when\r\ntaken in the mass-when a given population with an animistic turn is\r\nviewed as a whole. The economic drawbacks of animism are more patent and\r\nits consequences are more far-reaching under the modern system of large\r\nindustry than under any other. In the modern industrial communities,\r\nindustry is, to a constantly increasing extent, being organized in a\r\ncomprehensive system of organs and functions mutually conditioning one\r\nanother; and therefore freedom from all bias in the causal apprehension\r\nof phenomena grows constantly more requisite to efficiency on the\r\npart of the men concerned in industry. Under a system of handicraft an\r\nadvantage in dexterity, diligence, muscular force, or endurance may, in\r\na very large measure, offset such a bias in the habits of thought of the\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in agricultural industry of the traditional kind, which\r\nclosely resembles handicraft in the nature of the demands made upon\r\nthe workman. In both, the workman is himself the prime mover chiefly\r\ndepended upon, and the natural forces engaged are in large part\r\napprehended as inscrutable and fortuitous agencies, whose working lies\r\nbeyond the workman\'s control or discretion. In popular apprehension\r\nthere is in these forms of industry relatively little of the industrial\r\nprocess left to the fateful swing of a comprehensive mechanical sequence\r\nwhich must be comprehended in terms of causation and to which the\r\noperations of industry and the movements of the workmen must be adapted.\r\nAs industrial methods develop, the virtues of the handicraftsman count\r\nfor less and less as an offset to scanty intelligence or a halting\r\nacceptance of the sequence of cause and effect. The industrial\r\norganization assumes more and more of the character of a mechanism, in\r\nwhich it is man\'s office to discriminate and select what natural forces\r\nshall work out their effects in his service. The workman\'s part in\r\nindustry changes from that of a prime mover to that of discrimination\r\nand valuation of quantitative sequences and mechanical facts. The\r\nfaculty of a ready apprehension and unbiased appreciation of causes in\r\nhis environment grows in relative economic importance and any element in\r\nthe complex of his habits of thought which intrudes a bias at\r\nvariance with this ready appreciation of matter-of-fact sequence gains\r\nproportionately in importance as a disturbing element acting to lower\r\nhis industrial usefulness. Through its cumulative effect upon the\r\nhabitual attitude of the population, even a slight or inconspicuous bias\r\ntowards accounting for everyday facts by recourse to other ground than\r\nthat of quantitative causation may work an appreciable lowering of the\r\ncollective industrial efficiency of a community.\r\n\r\nThe animistic habit of mind may occur in the early, undifferentiated\r\nform of an inchoate animistic belief, or in the later and more highly\r\nintegrated phase in which there is an anthropomorphic personification of\r\nthe propensity imputed to facts. The industrial value of such a lively\r\nanimistic sense, or of such recourse to a preternatural agency or the\r\nguidance of an unseen hand, is of course very much the same in either\r\ncase. As affects the industrial serviceability of the individual, the\r\neffect is of the same kind in either case; but the extent to which\r\nthis habit of thought dominates or shapes the complex of his habits of\r\nthought varies with the degree of immediacy, urgency, or exclusiveness\r\nwith which the individual habitually applies the animistic or\r\nanthropomorphic formula in dealing with the facts of his environment.\r\nThe animistic habit acts in all cases to blur the appreciation of causal\r\nsequence; but the earlier, less reflected, less defined animistic sense\r\nof propensity may be expected to affect the intellectual processes\r\nof the individual in a more pervasive way than the higher forms of\r\nanthropomorphism. Where the animistic habit is present in the naive\r\nform, its scope and range of application are not defined or limited.\r\nIt will therefore palpably affect his thinking at every turn of the\r\nperson\'s life--wherever he has to do with the material means of life.\r\nIn the later, maturer development of animism, after it has been defined\r\nthrough the process of anthropomorphic elaboration, when its application\r\nhas been limited in a somewhat consistent fashion to the remote and the\r\ninvisible, it comes about that an increasing range of everyday facts are\r\nprovisionally accounted for without recourse to the preternatural agency\r\nin which a cultivated animism expresses itself. A highly integrated,\r\npersonified preternatural agency is not a convenient means of handling\r\nthe trivial occurrences of life, and a habit is therefore easily fallen\r\ninto of accounting for many trivial or vulgar phenomena in terms of\r\nsequence. The provisional explanation so arrived at is by neglect\r\nallowed to stand as definitive, for trivial purposes, until special\r\nprovocation or perplexity recalls the individual to his allegiance. But\r\nwhen special exigencies arise, that is to say, when there is peculiar\r\nneed of a full and free recourse to the law of cause and effect, then\r\nthe individual commonly has recourse to the preternatural agency as a\r\nuniversal solvent, if he is possessed of an anthropomorphic belief.\r\n\r\nThe extra-causal propensity or agent has a very high utility as a\r\nrecourse in perplexity, but its utility is altogether of a non-economic\r\nkind. It is especially a refuge and a fund of comfort where it has\r\nattained the degree of consistency and specialization that belongs to\r\nan anthropomorphic divinity. It has much to commend it even on other\r\ngrounds than that of affording the perplexed individual a means of\r\nescape from the difficulty of accounting for phenomena in terms of\r\ncausal sequence. It would scarcely be in place here to dwell on the\r\nobvious and well-accepted merits of an anthropomorphic divinity, as seen\r\nfrom the point of view of the aesthetic, moral, or spiritual interest,\r\nor even as seen from the less remote standpoint of political, military,\r\nor social policy. The question here concerns the less picturesque and\r\nless urgent economic value of the belief in such a preternatural agency,\r\ntaken as a habit of thought which affects the industrial serviceability\r\nof the believer. And even within this narrow, economic range, the\r\ninquiry is perforce confined to the immediate bearing of this habit\r\nof thought upon the believer\'s workmanlike serviceability, rather than\r\nextended to include its remoter economic effects. These remoter effects\r\nare very difficult to trace. The inquiry into them is so encumbered with\r\ncurrent preconceptions as to the degree in which life is enhanced by\r\nspiritual contact with such a divinity, that any attempt to inquire into\r\ntheir economic value must for the present be fruitless.\r\n\r\nThe immediate, direct effect of the animistic habit of thought upon the\r\ngeneral frame of mind of the believer goes in the direction of lowering\r\nhis effective intelligence in the respect in which intelligence is of\r\nespecial consequence for modern industry. The effect follows, in varying\r\ndegree, whether the preternatural agent or propensity believed in is\r\nof a higher or a lower cast. This holds true of the barbarian\'s and\r\nthe sporting man\'s sense of luck and propensity, and likewise of the\r\nsomewhat higher developed belief in an anthropomorphic divinity, such as\r\nis commonly possessed by the same class. It must be taken to hold true\r\nalso--though with what relative degree of cogency is not easy to say--of\r\nthe more adequately developed anthropomorphic cults, such as appeal\r\nto the devout civilized man. The industrial disability entailed by a\r\npopular adherence to one of the higher anthropomorphic cults may be\r\nrelatively slight, but it is not to be overlooked. And even these\r\nhigh-class cults of the Western culture do not represent the last\r\ndissolving phase of this human sense of extra-causal propensity. Beyond\r\nthese the same animistic sense shows itself also in such attenuations of\r\nanthropomorphism as the eighteenth-century appeal to an order of nature\r\nand natural rights, and in their modern representative, the ostensibly\r\npost-Darwinian concept of a meliorative trend in the process of\r\nevolution. This animistic explanation of phenomena is a form of the\r\nfallacy which the logicians knew by the name of ignava ratio. For\r\nthe purposes of industry or of science it counts as a blunder in the\r\napprehension and valuation of facts. Apart from its direct industrial\r\nconsequences, the animistic habit has a certain significance for\r\neconomic theory on other grounds. (1) It is a fairly reliable indication\r\nof the presence, and to some extent even of the degree of potency,\r\nof certain other archaic traits that accompany it and that are of\r\nsubstantial economic consequence; and (2) the material consequences of\r\nthat code of devout proprieties to which the animistic habit gives rise\r\nin the development of an anthropomorphic cult are of importance both\r\n(a) as affecting the community\'s consumption of goods and the prevalent\r\ncanons of taste, as already suggested in an earlier chapter, and (b) by\r\ninducing and conserving a certain habitual recognition of the relation\r\nto a superior, and so stiffening the current sense of status and\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\nAs regards the point last named (b), that body of habits of thought\r\nwhich makes up the character of any individual is in some sense an\r\norganic whole. A marked variation in a given direction at any one point\r\ncarries with it, as its correlative, a concomitant variation in the\r\nhabitual expression of life in other directions or other groups of\r\nactivities. These various habits of thought, or habitual expressions\r\nof life, are all phases of the single life sequence of the individual;\r\ntherefore a habit formed in response to a given stimulus will\r\nnecessarily affect the character of the response made to other stimuli.\r\nA modification of human nature at any one point is a modification of\r\nhuman nature as a whole. On this ground, and perhaps to a still greater\r\nextent on obscurer grounds that can not be discussed here, there are\r\nthese concomitant variations as between the different traits of human\r\nnature. So, for instance, barbarian peoples with a well-developed\r\npredatory scheme of life are commonly also possessed of a strong\r\nprevailing animistic habit, a well-formed anthropomorphic cult, and\r\na lively sense of status. On the other hand, anthropomorphism and\r\nthe realizing sense of an animistic propensity in material are less\r\nobtrusively present in the life of the peoples at the cultural stages\r\nwhich precede and which follow the barbarian culture. The sense of\r\nstatus is also feebler; on the whole, in peaceable communities. It is to\r\nbe remarked that a lively, but slightly specialized, animistic belief\r\nis to be found in most if not all peoples living in the ante-predatory,\r\nsavage stage of culture. The primitive savage takes his animism less\r\nseriously than the barbarian or the degenerate savage. With him\r\nit eventuates in fantastic myth-making, rather than in coercive\r\nsuperstition. The barbarian culture shows sportsmanship, status, and\r\nanthropomorphism. There is commonly observable a like concomitance of\r\nvariations in the same respects in the individual temperament of men in\r\nthe civilized communities of today. Those modern representatives of\r\nthe predaceous barbarian temper that make up the sporting element are\r\ncommonly believers in luck; at least they have a strong sense of an\r\nanimistic propensity in things, by force of which they are given to\r\ngambling. So also as regards anthropomorphism in this class. Such of\r\nthem as give in their adhesion to some creed commonly attach themselves\r\nto one of the naively and consistently anthropomorphic creeds; there\r\nare relatively few sporting men who seek spiritual comfort in the less\r\nanthropomorphic cults, such as the Unitarian or the Universalist.\r\n\r\nClosely bound up with this correlation of anthropomorphism and prowess\r\nis the fact that anthropomorphic cults act to conserve, if not to\r\ninitiate, habits of mind favorable to a regime of status. As regards\r\nthis point, it is quite impossible to say where the disciplinary effect\r\nof the cult ends and where the evidence of a concomitance of variations\r\nin inherited traits begins. In their finest development, the predatory\r\ntemperament, the sense of status, and the anthropomorphic cult all\r\ntogether belong to the barbarian culture; and something of a mutual\r\ncausal relation subsists between the three phenomena as they come into\r\nsight in communities on that cultural level. The way in which they recur\r\nin correlation in the habits and attitudes of individuals and classes\r\ntoday goes far to imply a like causal or organic relation between the\r\nsame psychological phenomena considered as traits or habits of the\r\nindividual. It has appeared at an earlier point in the discussion\r\nthat the relation of status, as a feature of social structure, is a\r\nconsequence of the predatory habit of life. As regards its line\r\nof derivation, it is substantially an elaborated expression of the\r\npredatory attitude. On the other hand, an anthropomorphic cult is a\r\ncode of detailed relations of status superimposed upon the concept of\r\na preternatural, inscrutable propensity in material things. So that, as\r\nregards the external facts of its derivation, the cult may be taken as\r\nan outgrowth of archaic man\'s pervading animistic sense, defined and in\r\nsome degree transformed by the predatory habit of life, the result being\r\na personified preternatural agency, which is by imputation endowed with\r\na full complement of the habits of thought that characterize the man of\r\nthe predatory culture.\r\n\r\nThe grosser psychological features in the case, which have an immediate\r\nbearing on economic theory and are consequently to be taken account\r\nof here, are therefore: (a) as has appeared in an earlier chapter,\r\nthe predatory, emulative habit of mind here called prowess is but the\r\nbarbarian variant of the generically human instinct of workmanship,\r\nwhich has fallen into this specific form under the guidance of a habit\r\nof invidious comparison of persons; (b) the relation of status is a\r\nformal expression of such an invidious comparison duly gauged and graded\r\naccording to a sanctioned schedule; (c) an anthropomorphic cult, in the\r\ndays of its early vigor at least, is an institution the characteristic\r\nelement of which is a relation of status between the human subject as\r\ninferior and the personified preternatural agency as superior. With\r\nthis in mind, there should be no difficulty in recognizing the intimate\r\nrelation which subsists between these three phenomena of human nature\r\nand of human life; the relation amounts to an identity in some of their\r\nsubstantial elements. On the one hand, the system of status and the\r\npredatory habit of life are an expression of the instinct of workmanship\r\nas it takes form under a custom of invidious comparison; on the other\r\nhand, the anthropomorphic cult and the habit of devout observances\r\nare an expression of men\'s animistic sense of a propensity in material\r\nthings, elaborated under the guidance of substantially the same general\r\nhabit of invidious comparison. The two categories--the emulative habit\r\nof life and the habit of devout observances--are therefore to be taken\r\nas complementary elements of the barbarian type of human nature and of\r\nits modern barbarian variants. They are expressions of much the same\r\nrange of aptitudes, made in response to different sets of stimuli.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Twelve ~~ Devout Observances\r\n\r\nA discoursive rehearsal of certain incidents of modern life will show\r\nthe organic relation of the anthropomorphic cults to the barbarian\r\nculture and temperament. It will likewise serve to show how the survival\r\nand efficacy of the cults and he prevalence of their schedule of devout\r\nobservances are related to the institution of a leisure class and to the\r\nsprings of action underlying that institution. Without any intention to\r\ncommend or to deprecate the practices to be spoken of under the head of\r\ndevout observances, or the spiritual and intellectual traits of which\r\nthese observances are the expression, the everyday phenomena of current\r\nanthropomorphic cults may be taken up from the point of view of the\r\ninterest which they have for economic theory. What can properly\r\nbe spoken of here are the tangible, external features of devout\r\nobservances. The moral, as well as the devotional value of the life of\r\nfaith lies outside of the scope of the present inquiry. Of course no\r\nquestion is here entertained as to the truth or beauty of the creeds on\r\nwhich the cults proceed. And even their remoter economic bearing can not\r\nbe taken up here; the subject is too recondite and of too grave import\r\nto find a place in so slight a sketch.\r\n\r\nSomething has been said in an earlier chapter as to the influence which\r\npecuniary standards of value exert upon the processes of valuation\r\ncarried out on other bases, not related to the pecuniary interest. The\r\nrelation is not altogether one-sided. The economic standards or canons\r\nof valuation are in their turn influenced by extra-economic standards of\r\nvalue. Our judgments of the economic bearing of facts are to some extent\r\nshaped by the dominant presence of these weightier interests. There is\r\na point of view, indeed, from which the economic interest is of weight\r\nonly as being ancillary to these higher, non-economic interests. For the\r\npresent purpose, therefore, some thought must be taken to isolate\r\nthe economic interest or the economic hearing of these phenomena of\r\nanthropomorphic cults. It takes some effort to divest oneself of the\r\nmore serious point of view, and to reach an economic appreciation\r\nof these facts, with as little as may be of the bias due to higher\r\ninterests extraneous to economic theory. In the discussion of the\r\nsporting temperament, it has appeared that the sense of an animistic\r\npropensity in material things and events is what affords the spiritual\r\nbasis of the sporting man\'s gambling habit. For the economic purpose,\r\nthis sense of propensity is substantially the same psychological element\r\nas expresses itself, under a variety of forms, in animistic beliefs and\r\nanthropomorphic creeds. So far as concerns those tangible psychological\r\nfeatures with which economic theory has to deal, the gambling spirit\r\nwhich pervades the sporting element shades off by insensible gradations\r\ninto that frame of mind which finds gratification in devout observances.\r\nAs seen from the point of view of economic theory, the sporting\r\ncharacter shades off into the character of a religious devotee. Where\r\nthe betting man\'s animistic sense is helped out by a somewhat consistent\r\ntradition, it has developed into a more or less articulate belief in\r\na preternatural or hyperphysical agency, with something of an\r\nanthropomorphic content. And where this is the case, there is commonly\r\na perceptible inclination to make terms with the preternatural agency\r\nby some approved method of approach and conciliation. This element of\r\npropitiation and cajoling has much in common with the crasser forms\r\nof worship--if not in historical derivation, at least in actual\r\npsychological content. It obviously shades off in unbroken continuity\r\ninto what is recognized as superstitious practice and belief, and so\r\nasserts its claim to kinship with the grosser anthropomorphic cults.\r\n\r\nThe sporting or gambling temperament, then, comprises some of the\r\nsubstantial psychological elements that go to make a believer in creeds\r\nand an observer of devout forms, the chief point of coincidence being\r\nthe belief in an inscrutable propensity or a preternatural interposition\r\nin the sequence of events. For the purpose of the gambling practice the\r\nbelief in preternatural agency may be, and ordinarily is, less closely\r\nformulated, especially as regards the habits of thought and the scheme\r\nof life imputed to the preternatural agent; or, in other words, as\r\nregards his moral character and his purposes in interfering in events.\r\nWith respect to the individuality or personality of the agency whose\r\npresence as luck, or chance, or hoodoo, or mascot, etc., he feels and\r\nsometimes dreads and endeavors to evade, the sporting man\'s views are\r\nalso less specific, less integrated and differentiated. The basis of his\r\ngambling activity is, in great measure, simply an instinctive sense\r\nof the presence of a pervasive extraphysical and arbitrary force or\r\npropensity in things or situations, which is scarcely recognized as a\r\npersonal agent. The betting man is not infrequently both a believer\r\nin luck, in this naive sense, and at the same time a pretty staunch\r\nadherent of some form of accepted creed. He is especially prone to\r\naccept so much of the creed as concerts the inscrutable power and the\r\narbitrary habits of the divinity which has won his confidence. In such a\r\ncase he is possessed of two, or sometimes more than two, distinguishable\r\nphases of animism. Indeed, the complete series of successive phases of\r\nanimistic belief is to be found unbroken in the spiritual furniture\r\nof any sporting community. Such a chain of animistic conceptions will\r\ncomprise the most elementary form of an instinctive sense of luck and\r\nchance and fortuitous necessity at one end of the series, together with\r\nthe perfectly developed anthropomorphic divinity at the other end, with\r\nall intervening stages of integration. Coupled with these beliefs in\r\npreternatural agency goes an instinctive shaping of conduct to conform\r\nwith the surmised requirements of the lucky chance on the one hand,\r\nand a more or less devout submission to the inscrutable decrees of the\r\ndivinity on the other hand.\r\n\r\nThere is a relationship in this respect between the sporting temperament\r\nand the temperament of the delinquent classes; and the two are related\r\nto the temperament which inclines to an anthropomorphic cult. Both\r\nthe delinquent and the sporting man are on the average more apt to be\r\nadherents of some accredited creed, and are also rather more inclined\r\nto devout observances, than the general average of the community. It is\r\nalso noticeable that unbelieving members of these classes show more of\r\na proclivity to become proselytes to some accredited faith than the\r\naverage of unbelievers. This fact of observation is avowed by the\r\nspokesmen of sports, especially in apologizing for the more naively\r\npredatory athletic sports. Indeed, it is somewhat insistently claimed as\r\na meritorious feature of sporting life that the habitual participants in\r\nathletic games are in some degree peculiarly given to devout practices.\r\nAnd it is observable that the cult to which sporting men and the\r\npredaceous delinquent classes adhere, or to which proselytes from\r\nthese classes commonly attach themselves, is ordinarily not one of the\r\nso-called higher faiths, but a cult which has to do with a thoroughly\r\nanthropomorphic divinity. Archaic, predatory human nature is not\r\nsatisfied with abstruse conceptions of a dissolving personality that\r\nshades off into the concept of quantitative causal sequence, such as the\r\nspeculative, esoteric creeds of Christendom impute to the First Cause,\r\nUniversal Intelligence, World Soul, or Spiritual Aspect. As an instance\r\nof a cult of the character which the habits of mind of the athlete and\r\nthe delinquent require, may be cited that branch of the church militant\r\nknown as the Salvation Army. This is to some extent recruited from the\r\nlower-class delinquents, and it appears to comprise also, among its\r\nofficers especially, a larger proportion of men with a sporting record\r\nthan the proportion of such men in the aggregate population of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nCollege athletics afford a case in point. It is contended by exponents\r\nof the devout element in college life--and there seems to be no ground\r\nfor disputing the claim--that the desirable athletic material afforded\r\nby any student body in this country is at the same time predominantly\r\nreligious; or that it is at least given to devout observances to a\r\ngreater degree than the average of those students whose interest in\r\nathletics and other college sports is less. This is what might be\r\nexpected on theoretical grounds. It may be remarked, by the way, that\r\nfrom one point of view this is felt to reflect credit on the college\r\nsporting life, on athletic games, and on those persons who occupy\r\nthemselves with these matters. It happens not frequently that college\r\nsporting men devote themselves to religious propaganda, either as a\r\nvocation or as a by-occupation; and it is observable that when this\r\nhappens they are likely to become propagandists of some one of the more\r\nanthropomorphic cults. In their teaching they are apt to insist\r\nchiefly on the personal relation of status which subsists between an\r\nanthropomorphic divinity and the human subject.\r\n\r\nThis intimate relation between athletics and devout observance among\r\ncollege men is a fact of sufficient notoriety; but it has a special\r\nfeature to which attention has not been called, although it is obvious\r\nenough. The religious zeal which pervades much of the college sporting\r\nelement is especially prone to express itself in an unquestioning\r\ndevoutness and a naive and complacent submission to an inscrutable\r\nProvidence. It therefore by preference seeks affiliation with some one\r\nof those lay religious organizations which occupy themselves with\r\nthe spread of the exoteric forms of faith--as, e.g., the Young Men\'s\r\nChristian Association or the Young People\'s Society for Christian\r\nEndeavor. These lay bodies are organized to further "practical"\r\nreligion; and as if to enforce the argument and firmly establish the\r\nclose relationship between the sporting temperament and the archaic\r\ndevoutness, these lay religious bodies commonly devote some appreciable\r\nportion of their energies to the furtherance of athletic contests and\r\nsimilar games of chance and skill. It might even be said that sports\r\nof this kind are apprehended to have some efficacy as a means of grace.\r\nThey are apparently useful as a means of proselyting, and as a means of\r\nsustaining the devout attitude in converts once made. That is to\r\nsay, the games which give exercise to the animistic sense and to the\r\nemulative propensity help to form and to conserve that habit of mind to\r\nwhich the more exoteric cults are congenial. Hence, in the hands of\r\nthe lay organizations, these sporting activities come to do duty as a\r\nnovitiate or a means of induction into that fuller unfolding of the\r\nlife of spiritual status which is the privilege of the full communicant\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nThat the exercise of the emulative and lower animistic proclivities are\r\nsubstantially useful for the devout purpose seems to be placed beyond\r\nquestion by the fact that the priesthood of many denominations is\r\nfollowing the lead of the lay organizations in this respect. Those\r\necclesiastical organizations especially which stand nearest the lay\r\norganizations in their insistence on practical religion have gone some\r\nway towards adopting these or analogous practices in connection with the\r\ntraditional devout observances. So there are "boys\' brigades," and other\r\norganizations, under clerical sanction, acting to develop the emulative\r\nproclivity and the sense of status in the youthful members of the\r\ncongregation. These pseudo-military organizations tend to elaborate and\r\naccentuate the proclivity to emulation and invidious comparison, and so\r\nstrengthen the native facility for discerning and approving the relation\r\nof personal mastery and subservience. And a believer is eminently a\r\nperson who knows how to obey and accept chastisement with good grace.\r\nBut the habits of thought which these practices foster and conserve\r\nmake up but one half of the substance of the anthropomorphic cults.\r\nThe other, complementary element of devout life--the animistic habit\r\nof mind--is recruited and conserved by a second range of practices\r\norganized under clerical sanction. These are the class of gambling\r\npractices of which the church bazaar or raffle may be taken as the type.\r\nAs indicating the degree of legitimacy of these practices in connection\r\nwith devout observances proper, it is to be remarked that these raffles,\r\nand the like trivial opportunities for gambling, seem to appeal with\r\nmore effect to the common run of the members of religious organizations\r\nthan they do to persons of a less devout habit of mind.\r\n\r\nAll this seems to argue, on the one hand, that the same temperament\r\ninclines people to sports as inclines them to the anthropomorphic cults,\r\nand on the other hand that the habituation to sports, perhaps especially\r\nto athletic sports, acts to develop the propensities which find\r\nsatisfaction in devout observances. Conversely; it also appears that\r\nhabituation to these observances favors the growth of a proclivity\r\nfor athletic sports and for all games that give play to the habit of\r\ninvidious comparison and of the appeal to luck. Substantially the same\r\nrange of propensities finds expression in both these directions of\r\nthe spiritual life. That barbarian human nature in which the predatory\r\ninstinct and the animistic standpoint predominate is normally prone\r\nto both. The predatory habit of mind involves an accentuated sense of\r\npersonal dignity and of the relative standing of individuals. The social\r\nstructure in which the predatory habit has been the dominant factor\r\nin the shaping of institutions is a structure based on status. The\r\npervading norm in the predatory community\'s scheme of life is the\r\nrelation of superior and inferior, noble and base, dominant and\r\nsubservient persons and classes, master and slave. The anthropomorphic\r\ncults have come down from that stage of industrial development and\r\nhave been shaped by the same scheme of economic differentiation--a\r\ndifferentiation into consumer and producer--and they are pervaded by the\r\nsame dominant principle of mastery and subservience. The cults impute to\r\ntheir divinity the habits of thought answering to the stage of economic\r\ndifferentiation at which the cults took shape. The anthropomorphic\r\ndivinity is conceived to be punctilious in all questions of precedence\r\nand is prone to an assertion of mastery and an arbitrary exercise of\r\npower--an habitual resort to force as the final arbiter.\r\n\r\nIn the later and maturer formulations of the anthropomorphic creed this\r\nimputed habit of dominance on the part of a divinity of awful presence\r\nand inscrutable power is chastened into "the fatherhood of God." The\r\nspiritual attitude and the aptitudes imputed to the preternatural agent\r\nare still such as belong under the regime of status, but they now assume\r\nthe patriarchal cast characteristic of the quasi-peaceable stage of\r\nculture. Still it is to be noted that even in this advanced phase of the\r\ncult the observances in which devoutness finds expression consistently\r\naim to propitiate the divinity by extolling his greatness and glory and\r\nby professing subservience and fealty. The act of propitiation or\r\nof worship is designed to appeal to a sense of status imputed to the\r\ninscrutable power that is thus approached. The propitiatory formulas\r\nmost in vogue are still such as carry or imply an invidious comparison.\r\nA loyal attachment to the person of an anthropomorphic divinity endowed\r\nwith such an archaic human nature implies the like archaic propensities\r\nin the devotee. For the purposes of economic theory, the relation of\r\nfealty, whether to a physical or to an extraphysical person, is to be\r\ntaken as a variant of that personal subservience which makes up so large\r\na share of the predatory and the quasi-peaceable scheme of life.\r\n\r\nThe barbarian conception of the divinity, as a warlike chieftain\r\ninclined to an overbearing manner of government, has been greatly\r\nsoftened through the milder manners and the soberer habits of life that\r\ncharacterize those cultural phases which lie between the early predatory\r\nstage and the present. But even after this chastening of the devout\r\nfancy, and the consequent mitigation of the harsher traits of conduct\r\nand character that are currently imputed to the divinity, there still\r\nremains in the popular apprehension of the divine nature and temperament\r\na very substantial residue of the barbarian conception. So it comes\r\nabout, for instance, that in characterizing the divinity and his\r\nrelations to the process of human life, speakers and writers are still\r\nable to make effective use of similes borrowed from the vocabulary of\r\nwar and of the predatory manner of life, as well as of locutions which\r\ninvolve an invidious comparison. Figures of speech of this import\r\nare used with good effect even in addressing the less warlike modern\r\naudiences, made up of adherents of the blander variants of the creed.\r\nThis effective use of barbarian epithets and terms of comparison by\r\npopular speakers argues that the modern generation has retained a lively\r\nappreciation of the dignity and merit of the barbarian virtues; and\r\nit argues also that there is a degree of congruity between the devout\r\nattitude and the predatory habit of mind. It is only on second thought,\r\nif at all, that the devout fancy of modern worshippers revolts at the\r\nimputation of ferocious and vengeful emotions and actions to the object\r\nof their adoration. It is a matter of common observation that sanguinary\r\nepithets applied to the divinity have a high aesthetic and honorific\r\nvalue in the popular apprehension. That is to say, suggestions\r\nwhich these epithets carry are very acceptable to our unreflecting\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\n  Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord:\r\n  He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;\r\n  He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword;\r\n  His truth is marching on.\r\n\r\nThe guiding habits of thought of a devout person move on the plane of an\r\narchaic scheme of life which has outlived much of its usefulness for the\r\neconomic exigencies of the collective life of today. In so far as the\r\neconomic organization fits the exigencies of the collective life of\r\ntoday, it has outlived the regime of status, and has no use and no place\r\nfor a relation of personal subserviency. So far as concerns the economic\r\nefficiency of the community, the sentiment of personal fealty, and the\r\ngeneral habit of mind of which that sentiment is an expression, are\r\nsurvivals which cumber the ground and hinder an adequate adjustment of\r\nhuman institutions to the existing situation. The habit of mind which\r\nbest lends itself to the purposes of a peaceable, industrial community,\r\nis that matter-of-fact temper which recognizes the value of material\r\nfacts simply as opaque items in the mechanical sequence. It is\r\nthat frame of mind which does not instinctively impute an animistic\r\npropensity to things, nor resort to preternatural intervention as an\r\nexplanation of perplexing phenomena, nor depend on an unseen hand to\r\nshape the course of events to human use. To meet the requirements of the\r\nhighest economic efficiency under modern conditions, the world process\r\nmust habitually be apprehended in terms of quantitative, dispassionate\r\nforce and sequence.\r\n\r\nAs seen from the point of view of the later economic exigencies,\r\ndevoutness is, perhaps in all cases, to be looked upon as a survival\r\nfrom an earlier phase of associated life--a mark of arrested spiritual\r\ndevelopment. Of course it remains true that in a community where the\r\neconomic structure is still substantially a system of status; where\r\nthe attitude of the average of persons in the community is consequently\r\nshaped by and adapted to the relation of personal dominance and\r\npersonal subservience; or where for any other reason--of tradition or\r\nof inherited aptitude--the population as a whole is strongly inclined to\r\ndevout observances; there a devout habit of mind in any individual, not\r\nin excess of the average of the community, must be taken simply as\r\na detail of the prevalent habit of life. In this light, a devout\r\nindividual in a devout community can not be called a case of reversion,\r\nsince he is abreast of the average of the community. But as seen from\r\nthe point of view of the modern industrial situation, exceptional\r\ndevoutness--devotional zeal that rises appreciably above the average\r\npitch of devoutness in the community--may safely be set down as in all\r\ncases an atavistic trait.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, equally legitimate to consider these phenomena from\r\na different point of view. They may be appreciated for a different\r\npurpose, and the characterization here offered may be turned about.\r\nIn speaking from the point of view of the devotional interest, or the\r\ninterest of devout taste, it may, with equal cogency, be said that\r\nthe spiritual attitude bred in men by the modern industrial life is\r\nunfavorable to a free development of the life of faith. It might fairly\r\nbe objected to the later development of the industrial process that its\r\ndiscipline tends to "materialism," to the elimination of filial piety.\r\nFrom the aesthetic point of view, again, something to a similar purport\r\nmight be said. But, however legitimate and valuable these and the like\r\nreflections may be for their purpose, they would not be in place in the\r\npresent inquiry, which is exclusively concerned with the valuation of\r\nthese phenomena from the economic point of view.\r\n\r\nThe grave economic significance of the anthropomorphic habit of mind\r\nand of the addiction to devout observances must serve as apology for\r\nspeaking further on a topic which it can not but be distasteful to\r\ndiscuss at all as an economic phenomenon in a community so devout as\r\nours. Devout observances are of economic importance as an index of a\r\nconcomitant variation of temperament, accompanying the predatory habit\r\nof mind and so indicating the presence of industrially disserviceable\r\ntraits. They indicate the presence of a mental attitude which has a\r\ncertain economic value of its own by virtue of its influence upon\r\nthe industrial serviceability of the individual. But they are also of\r\nimportance more directly, in modifying the economic activities of the\r\ncommunity, especially as regards the distribution and consumption of\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious economic bearing of these observances is seen in the\r\ndevout consumption of goods and services. The consumption of ceremonial\r\nparaphernalia required by any cult, in the way of shrines, temples,\r\nchurches, vestments, sacrifices, sacraments, holiday attire, etc.,\r\nserves no immediate material end. All this material apparatus may,\r\ntherefore, without implying deprecation, be broadly characterized as\r\nitems of conspicuous waste. The like is true in a general way of the\r\npersonal service consumed under this head; such as priestly education,\r\npriestly service, pilgrimages, fasts, holidays, household devotions,\r\nand the like. At the same time the observances in the execution of which\r\nthis consumption takes place serve to extend and protract the vogue of\r\nthose habits of thought on which an anthropomorphic cult rests. That is\r\nto say, they further the habits of thought characteristic of the regime\r\nof status. They are in so far an obstruction to the most effective\r\norganization of industry under modern circumstances; and are, in the\r\nfirst instance, antagonistic to the development of economic institutions\r\nin the direction required by the situation of today. For the present\r\npurpose, the indirect as well as the direct effects of this consumption\r\nare of the nature of a curtailment of the community\'s economic\r\nefficiency. In economic theory, then, and considered in its proximate\r\nconsequences, the consumption of goods and effort in the service of\r\nan anthropomorphic divinity means a lowering of the vitality of the\r\ncommunity. What may be the remoter, indirect, moral effects of this\r\nclass of consumption does not admit of a succinct answer, and it is a\r\nquestion which can not be taken up here.\r\n\r\nIt will be to the point, however, to note the general economic character\r\nof devout consumption, in comparison with consumption for other\r\npurposes. An indication of the range of motives and purposes from which\r\ndevout consumption of goods proceeds will help toward an appreciation\r\nof the value both of this consumption itself and of the general habit of\r\nmind to which it is congenial. There is a striking parallelism, if not\r\nrather a substantial identity of motive, between the consumption which\r\ngoes to the service of an anthropomorphic divinity and that which goes\r\nto the service of a gentleman of leisure chieftain or patriarch--in the\r\nupper class of society during the barbarian culture. Both in the case of\r\nthe chieftain and in that of the divinity there are expensive edifices\r\nset apart for the behoof of the person served. These edifices, as well\r\nas the properties which supplement them in the service, must not be\r\ncommon in kind or grade; they always show a large element of conspicuous\r\nwaste. It may also be noted that the devout edifices are invariably of\r\nan archaic cast in their structure and fittings. So also the servants,\r\nboth of the chieftain and of the divinity, must appear in the presence\r\nclothed in garments of a special, ornate character. The characteristic\r\neconomic feature of this apparel is a more than ordinarily accentuated\r\nconspicuous waste, together with the secondary feature--more accentuated\r\nin the case of the priestly servants than in that of the servants or\r\ncourtiers of the barbarian potentate--that this court dress must always\r\nbe in some degree of an archaic fashion. Also the garments worn by the\r\nlay members of the community when they come into the presence, should be\r\nof a more expensive kind than their everyday apparel. Here, again, the\r\nparallelism between the usage of the chieftain\'s audience hall and\r\nthat of the sanctuary is fairly well marked. In this respect there\r\nis required a certain ceremonial "cleanness" of attire, the essential\r\nfeature of which, in the economic respect, is that the garments worn\r\non these occasions should carry as little suggestion as may be of any\r\nindustrial occupation or of any habitual addiction to such employments\r\nas are of material use.\r\n\r\nThis requirement of conspicuous waste and of ceremonial cleanness from\r\nthe traces of industry extends also to the apparel, and in a less degree\r\nto the food, which is consumed on sacred holidays; that is to say, on\r\ndays set apart--tabu--for the divinity or for some member of the lower\r\nranks of the preternatural leisure class. In economic theory, sacred\r\nholidays are obviously to be construed as a season of vicarious leisure\r\nperformed for the divinity or saint in whose name the tabu is imposed\r\nand to whose good repute the abstention from useful effort on these days\r\nis conceived to inure. The characteristic feature of all such seasons\r\nof devout vicarious leisure is a more or less rigid tabu on all\r\nactivity that is of human use. In the case of fast-days the conspicuous\r\nabstention from gainful occupations and from all pursuits that\r\n(materially) further human life is further accentuated by compulsory\r\nabstinence from such consumption as would conduce to the comfort or the\r\nfullness of life of the consumer.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, parenthetically, that secular holidays are of the\r\nsame origin, by slightly remoter derivation. They shade off by degrees\r\nfrom the genuinely sacred days, through an intermediate class of\r\nsemi-sacred birthdays of kings and great men who have been in some\r\nmeasure canonized, to the deliberately invented holiday set apart to\r\nfurther the good repute of some notable event or some striking fact, to\r\nwhich it is intended to do honor, or the good fame of which is felt\r\nto be in need of repair. The remoter refinement in the employment\r\nof vicarious leisure as a means of augmenting the good repute of a\r\nphenomenon or datum is seen at its best in its very latest application.\r\nA day of vicarious leisure has in some communities been set apart as\r\nLabor Day. This observance is designed to augment the prestige of\r\nthe fact of labor, by the archaic, predatory method of a compulsory\r\nabstention from useful effort. To this datum of labor-in-general is\r\nimputed the good repute attributable to the pecuniary strength put\r\nin evidence by abstaining from labor. Sacred holidays, and holidays\r\ngenerally, are of the nature of a tribute levied on the body of the\r\npeople. The tribute is paid in vicarious leisure, and the honorific\r\neffect which emerges is imputed to the person or the fact for whose\r\ngood repute the holiday has been instituted. Such a tithe of vicarious\r\nleisure is a perquisite of all members of the preternatural leisure\r\nclass and is indispensable to their good fame. Un saint qu\'on ne ch\xf4me\r\npas is indeed a saint fallen on evil days.\r\n\r\nBesides this tithe of vicarious leisure levied on the laity, there\r\nare also special classes of persons--the various grades of priests and\r\nhierodules--whose time is wholly set apart for a similar service. It is\r\nnot only incumbent on the priestly class to abstain from vulgar labor,\r\nespecially so far as it is lucrative or is apprehended to contribute to\r\nthe temporal well-being of mankind. The tabu in the case of the priestly\r\nclass goes farther and adds a refinement in the form of an injunction\r\nagainst their seeking worldly gain even where it may be had without\r\ndebasing application to industry. It is felt to be unworthy of the\r\nservant of the divinity, or rather unworthy the dignity of the divinity\r\nwhose servant he is, that he should seek material gain or take thought\r\nfor temporal matters. "Of all contemptible things a man who pretends to\r\nbe a priest of God and is a priest to his own comforts and ambitions\r\nis the most contemptible." There is a line of discrimination, which a\r\ncultivated taste in matters of devout observance finds little difficulty\r\nin drawing, between such actions and conduct as conduce to the\r\nfullness of human life and such as conduce to the good fame of the\r\nanthropomorphic divinity; and the activity of the priestly class, in the\r\nideal barbarian scheme, falls wholly on the hither side of this line.\r\nWhat falls within the range of economics falls below the proper level\r\nof solicitude of the priesthood in its best estate. Such apparent\r\nexceptions to this rule as are afforded, for instance, by some of the\r\nmedieval orders of monks (the members of which actually labored to some\r\nuseful end), scarcely impugn the rule. These outlying orders of the\r\npriestly class are not a sacerdotal element in the full sense of the\r\nterm. And it is noticeable also that these doubtfully sacerdotal\r\norders, which countenanced their members in earning a living, fell into\r\ndisrepute through offending the sense of propriety in the communities\r\nwhere they existed.\r\n\r\nThe priest should not put his hand to mechanically productive work; but\r\nhe should consume in large measure. But even as regards his consumption\r\nit is to be noted that it should take such forms as do not obviously\r\nconduce to his own comfort or fullness of life; it should conform to the\r\nrules governing vicarious consumption, as explained under that head in\r\nan earlier chapter. It is not ordinarily in good form for the priestly\r\nclass to appear well fed or in hilarious spirits. Indeed, in many of\r\nthe more elaborate cults the injunction against other than vicarious\r\nconsumption by this class frequently goes so far as to enjoin\r\nmortification of the flesh. And even in those modern denominations which\r\nhave been organized under the latest formulations of the creed, in a\r\nmodern industrial community, it is felt that all levity and avowed zest\r\nin the enjoyment of the good things of this world is alien to the true\r\nclerical decorum. Whatever suggests that these servants of an invisible\r\nmaster are living a life, not of devotion to their master\'s good fame,\r\nbut of application to their own ends, jars harshly on our sensibilities\r\nas something fundamentally and eternally wrong. They are a servant\r\nclass, although, being servants of a very exalted master, they rank high\r\nin the social scale by virtue of this borrowed light. Their consumption\r\nis vicarious consumption; and since, in the advanced cults, their master\r\nhas no need of material gain, their occupation is vicarious leisure in\r\nthe full sense. "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye\r\ndo, do all to the glory of God." It may be added that so far as the\r\nlaity is assimilated to the priesthood in the respect that they are\r\nconceived to be servants of the divinity. So far this imputed vicarious\r\ncharacter attaches also to the layman\'s life. The range of application\r\nof this corollary is somewhat wide. It applies especially to such\r\nmovements for the reform or rehabilitation of the religious life as\r\nare of an austere, pietistic, ascetic cast--where the human subject is\r\nconceived to hold his life by a direct servile tenure from his spiritual\r\nsovereign. That is to say, where the institution of the priesthood\r\nlapses, or where there is an exceptionally lively sense of the immediate\r\nand masterful presence of the divinity in the affairs of life, there\r\nthe layman is conceived to stand in an immediate servile relation to\r\nthe divinity, and his life is construed to be a performance of vicarious\r\nleisure directed to the enhancement of his master\'s repute. In such\r\ncases of reversion there is a return to the unmediated relation of\r\nsubservience, as the dominant fact of the devout attitude. The emphasis\r\nis thereby thrown on an austere and discomforting vicarious leisure, to\r\nthe neglect of conspicuous consumption as a means of grace.\r\n\r\nA doubt will present itself as to the full legitimacy of this\r\ncharacterization of the sacerdotal scheme of life, on the ground that a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the modern priesthood departs from the scheme\r\nin many details. The scheme does not hold good for the clergy of\r\nthose denominations which have in some measure diverged from the old\r\nestablished schedule of beliefs or observances. These take thought, at\r\nleast ostensibly or permissively, for the temporal welfare of the laity,\r\nas well as for their own. Their manner of life, not only in the privacy\r\nof their own household, but often even before the public, does not\r\ndiffer in an extreme degree from that of secular-minded persons, either\r\nin its ostensible austerity or in the archaism of its apparatus. This is\r\ntruest for those denominations that have wandered the farthest. To\r\nthis objection it is to be said that we have here to do not with a\r\ndiscrepancy in the theory of sacerdotal life, but with an imperfect\r\nconformity to the scheme on the part of this body of clergy. They are\r\nbut a partial and imperfect representative of the priesthood, and must\r\nnot be taken as exhibiting the sacerdotal scheme of life in an authentic\r\nand competent manner. The clergy of the sects and denominations might be\r\ncharacterized as a half-caste priesthood, or a priesthood in process of\r\nbecoming or of reconstitution. Such a priesthood may be expected to\r\nshow the characteristics of the sacerdotal office only as blended\r\nand obscured with alien motives and traditions, due to the disturbing\r\npresence of other factors than those of animism and status in the\r\npurposes of the organizations to which this non-conforming fraction of\r\nthe priesthood belongs.\r\n\r\nAppeal may be taken direct to the taste of any person with a\r\ndiscriminating and cultivated sense of the sacerdotal proprieties, or\r\nto the prevalent sense of what constitutes clerical decorum in any\r\ncommunity at all accustomed to think or to pass criticism on what a\r\nclergyman may or may not do without blame. Even in the most extremely\r\nsecularized denominations, there is some sense of a distinction that\r\nshould be observed between the sacerdotal and the lay scheme of life.\r\nThere is no person of sensibility but feels that where the members of\r\nthis denominational or sectarian clergy depart from traditional usage,\r\nin the direction of a less austere or less archaic demeanor and apparel,\r\nthey are departing from the ideal of priestly decorum. There is probably\r\nno community and no sect within the range of the Western culture in\r\nwhich the bounds of permissible indulgence are not drawn appreciably\r\ncloser for the incumbent of the priestly office than for the common\r\nlayman. If the priest\'s own sense of sacerdotal propriety does not\r\neffectually impose a limit, the prevalent sense of the proprieties on\r\nthe part of the community will commonly assert itself so obtrusively as\r\nto lead to his conformity or his retirement from office.\r\n\r\nFew if any members of any body of clergy, it may be added, would\r\navowedly seek an increase of salary for gain\'s sake; and if such avowal\r\nwere openly made by a clergyman, it would be found obnoxious to the\r\nsense of propriety among his congregation. It may also be noted in this\r\nconnection that no one but the scoffers and the very obtuse are not\r\ninstinctively grieved inwardly at a jest from the pulpit; and that there\r\nare none whose respect for their pastor does not suffer through any mark\r\nof levity on his part in any conjuncture of life, except it be levity\r\nof a palpably histrionic kind--a constrained unbending of dignity. The\r\ndiction proper to the sanctuary and to the priestly office should also\r\ncarry little if any suggestion of effective everyday life, and should\r\nnot draw upon the vocabulary of modern trade or industry. Likewise,\r\none\'s sense of the proprieties is readily offended by too detailed and\r\nintimate a handling of industrial and other purely human questions at\r\nthe hands of the clergy. There is a certain level of generality below\r\nwhich a cultivated sense of the proprieties in homiletical discourse\r\nwill not permit a well-bred clergyman to decline in his discussion\r\nof temporal interests. These matters that are of human and secular\r\nconsequence simply, should properly be handled with such a degree of\r\ngenerality and aloofness as may imply that the speaker represents\r\na master whose interest in secular affairs goes only so far as to\r\npermissively countenance them.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be noticed that the non-conforming sects and variants\r\nwhose priesthood is here under discussion, vary among themselves in the\r\ndegree of their conformity to the ideal scheme of sacerdotal life. In\r\na general way it will be found that the divergence in this respect is\r\nwidest in the case of the relatively young denominations, and especially\r\nin the case of such of the newer denominations as have chiefly a lower\r\nmiddle-class constituency. They commonly show a large admixture of\r\nhumanitarian, philanthropic, or other motives which can not be classed\r\nas expressions of the devotional attitude; such as the desire of\r\nlearning or of conviviality, which enter largely into the effective\r\ninterest shown by members of these organizations. The non-conforming or\r\nsectarian movements have commonly proceeded from a mixture of motives,\r\nsome of which are at variance with that sense of status on which the\r\npriestly office rests. Sometimes, indeed, the motive has been in good\r\npart a revulsion against a system of status. Where this is the case\r\nthe institution of the priesthood has broken down in the transition, at\r\nleast partially. The spokesman of such an organization is at the outset\r\na servant and representative of the organization, rather than a member\r\nof a special priestly class and the spokesman of a divine master. And\r\nit is only by a process of gradual specialization that, in succeeding\r\ngenerations, this spokesman regains the position of priest, with a full\r\ninvestiture of sacerdotal authority, and with its accompanying austere,\r\narchaic and vicarious manner of life. The like is true of the breakdown\r\nand redintegration of devout ritual after such a revulsion. The priestly\r\noffice, the scheme of sacerdotal life, and the schedule of devout\r\nobservances are rehabilitated only gradually, insensibly, and with more\r\nor less variation in details, as a persistent human sense of devout\r\npropriety reasserts its primacy in questions touching the interest in\r\nthe preternatural--and it may be added, as the organization increases\r\nin wealth, and so acquires more of the point of view and the habits of\r\nthought of a leisure class.\r\n\r\nBeyond the priestly class, and ranged in an ascending hierarchy,\r\nordinarily comes a superhuman vicarious leisure class of saints, angels,\r\netc.--or their equivalents in the ethnic cults. These rise in grade, one\r\nabove another, according to elaborate system of status. The principle of\r\nstatus runs through the entire hierarchical system, both visible and\r\ninvisible. The good fame of these several orders of the supernatural\r\nhierarchy also commonly requires a certain tribute of vicarious\r\nconsumption and vicarious leisure. In many cases they accordingly have\r\ndevoted to their service sub-orders of attendants or dependents who\r\nperform a vicarious leisure for them, after much the same fashion as was\r\nfound in an earlier chapter to be true of the dependent leisure class\r\nunder the patriarchal system.\r\n\r\nIt may not appear without reflection how these devout observances and\r\nthe peculiarity of temperament which they imply, or the consumption of\r\ngoods and services which is comprised in the cult, stand related to the\r\nleisure class of a modern community, or to the economic motives of which\r\nthat class is the exponent in the modern scheme of life to this end a\r\nsummary review of certain facts bearing on this relation will be useful.\r\nIt appears from an earlier passage in this discussion that for the\r\npurpose of the collective life of today, especially so far as concerns\r\nthe industrial efficiency of the modern community, the characteristic\r\ntraits of the devout temperament are a hindrance rather than a help.\r\nIt should accordingly be found that the modern industrial life tends\r\nselectively to eliminate these traits of human nature from the spiritual\r\nconstitution of the classes that are immediately engaged in the\r\nindustrial process. It should hold true, approximately, that devoutness\r\nis declining or tending to obsolescence among the members of what may\r\nbe called the effective industrial community. At the same time it should\r\nappear that this aptitude or habit survives in appreciably greater vigor\r\namong those classes which do not immediately or primarily enter into the\r\ncommunity\'s life process as an industrial factor.\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that these latter classes, which live\r\nby, rather than in, the industrial process, are roughly comprised under\r\ntwo categories (1) the leisure class proper, which is shielded from\r\nthe stress of the economic situation; and (2) the indigent classes,\r\nincluding the lower-class delinquents, which are unduly exposed to\r\nthe stress. In the case of the former class an archaic habit of mind\r\npersists because no effectual economic pressure constrains this class to\r\nan adaptation of its habits of thought to the changing situation; while\r\nin the latter the reason for a failure to adjust their habits of thought\r\nto the altered requirements of industrial efficiency is innutrition,\r\nabsence of such surplus of energy as is needed in order to make the\r\nadjustment with facility, together with a lack of opportunity to acquire\r\nand become habituated to the modern point of view. The trend of the\r\nselective process runs in much the same direction in both cases.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view which the modern industrial life inculcates,\r\nphenomena are habitually subsumed under the quantitative relation of\r\nmechanical sequence. The indigent classes not only fall short of the\r\nmodicum of leisure necessary in order to appropriate and assimilate\r\nthe more recent generalizations of science which this point of view\r\ninvolves, but they also ordinarily stand in such a relation of personal\r\ndependence or subservience to their pecuniary superiors as materially to\r\nretard their emancipation from habits of thought proper to the regime\r\nof status. The result is that these classes in some measure retain that\r\ngeneral habit of mind the chief expression of which is a strong sense of\r\npersonal status, and of which devoutness is one feature.\r\n\r\nIn the older communities of the European culture, the hereditary leisure\r\nclass, together with the mass of the indigent population, are given to\r\ndevout observances in an appreciably higher degree than the average\r\nof the industrious middle class, wherever a considerable class of\r\nthe latter character exists. But in some of these countries, the two\r\ncategories of conservative humanity named above comprise virtually the\r\nwhole population. Where these two classes greatly preponderate, their\r\nbent shapes popular sentiment to such an extent as to bear down any\r\npossible divergent tendency in the inconsiderable middle class, and\r\nimposes a devout attitude upon the whole community.\r\n\r\nThis must, of course, not be construed to say that such communities or\r\nsuch classes as are exceptionally prone to devout observances tend to\r\nconform in any exceptional degree to the specifications of any code\r\nof morals that we may be accustomed to associate with this or that\r\nconfession of faith. A large measure of the devout habit of mind\r\nneed not carry with it a strict observance of the injunctions of the\r\nDecalogue or of the common law. Indeed, it is becoming somewhat of a\r\ncommonplace with observers of criminal life in European communities that\r\nthe criminal and dissolute classes are, if anything, rather more devout,\r\nand more naively so, than the average of the population. It is among\r\nthose who constitute the pecuniary middle class and the body of\r\nlaw-abiding citizens that a relative exemption from the devotional\r\nattitude is to be looked for. Those who best appreciate the merits of\r\nthe higher creeds and observances would object to all this and say that\r\nthe devoutness of the low-class delinquents is a spurious, or at the\r\nbest a superstitious devoutness; and the point is no doubt well taken\r\nand goes directly and cogently to the purpose intended. But for the\r\npurpose of the present inquiry these extra-economic, extra-psychological\r\ndistinctions must perforce be neglected, however valid and however\r\ndecisive they may be for the purpose for which they are made.\r\n\r\nWhat has actually taken place with regard to class emancipation from the\r\nhabit of devout observance is shown by the latter-day complaint of\r\nthe clergy--that the churches are losing the sympathy of the artisan\r\nclasses, and are losing their hold upon them. At the same time it is\r\ncurrently believed that the middle class, commonly so called, is also\r\nfalling away in the cordiality of its support of the church, especially\r\nso far as regards the adult male portion of that class. These are\r\ncurrently recognized phenomena, and it might seem that a simple\r\nreference to these facts should sufficiently substantiate the general\r\nposition outlined. Such an appeal to the general phenomena of popular\r\nchurch attendance and church membership may be sufficiently convincing\r\nfor the proposition here advanced. But it will still be to the purpose\r\nto trace in some detail the course of events and the particular forces\r\nwhich have wrought this change in the spiritual attitude of the more\r\nadvanced industrial communities of today. It will serve to illustrate\r\nthe manner in which economic causes work towards a secularization of\r\nmen\'s habits of thought. In this respect the American community should\r\nafford an exceptionally convincing illustration, since this community\r\nhas been the least trammelled by external circumstances of any equally\r\nimportant industrial aggregate.\r\n\r\nAfter making due allowance for exceptions and sporadic departures from\r\nthe normal, the situation here at the present time may be summarized\r\nquite briefly. As a general rule the classes that are low in economic\r\nefficiency, or in intelligence, or both, are peculiarly devout--as, for\r\ninstance, the Negro population of the South, much of the lower-class\r\nforeign population, much of the rural population, especially in those\r\nsections which are backward in education, in the stage of development of\r\ntheir industry, or in respect of their industrial contact with the rest\r\nof the community. So also such fragments as we possess of a specialized\r\nor hereditary indigent class, or of a segregated criminal or dissolute\r\nclass; although among these latter the devout habit of mind is apt to\r\ntake the form of a naive animistic belief in luck and in the efficacy of\r\nshamanistic practices perhaps more frequently than it takes the form of\r\na formal adherence to any accredited creed. The artisan class, on\r\nthe other hand, is notoriously falling away from the accredited\r\nanthropomorphic creeds and from all devout observances. This class is\r\nin an especial degree exposed to the characteristic intellectual and\r\nspiritual stress of modern organized industry, which requires a constant\r\nrecognition of the undisguised phenomena of impersonal, matter-of-fact\r\nsequence and an unreserved conformity to the law of cause and effect.\r\nThis class is at the same time not underfed nor over-worked to such an\r\nextent as to leave no margin of energy for the work of adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe case of the lower or doubtful leisure class in America--the middle\r\nclass commonly so called--is somewhat peculiar. It differs in respect\r\nof its devotional life from its European counterpart, but it differs in\r\ndegree and method rather than in substance. The churches still have the\r\npecuniary support of this class; although the creeds to which the\r\nclass adheres with the greatest facility are relatively poor in\r\nanthropomorphic content. At the same time the effective middle-class\r\ncongregation tends, in many cases, more or less remotely perhaps, to\r\nbecome a congregation of women and minors. There is an appreciable lack\r\nof devotional fervor among the adult males of the middle class, although\r\nto a considerable extent there survives among them a certain complacent,\r\nreputable assent to the outlines of the accredited creed under which\r\nthey were born. Their everyday life is carried on in a more or less\r\nclose contact with the industrial process.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar sexual differentiation, which tends to delegate devout\r\nobservances to the women and their children, is due, at least in\r\npart, to the fact that the middle-class women are in great measure a\r\n(vicarious) leisure class. The same is true in a less degree of the\r\nwomen of the lower, artisan classes. They live under a regime of status\r\nhanded down from an earlier stage of industrial development, and thereby\r\nthey preserve a frame of mind and habits of thought which incline them\r\nto an archaic view of things generally. At the same time they stand in\r\nno such direct organic relation to the industrial process at large as\r\nwould tend strongly to break down those habits of thought which, for the\r\nmodern industrial purpose, are obsolete. That is to say, the peculiar\r\ndevoutness of women is a particular expression of that conservatism\r\nwhich the women of civilized communities owe, in great measure, to their\r\neconomic position. For the modern man the patriarchal relation of status\r\nis by no means the dominant feature of life; but for the women on the\r\nother hand, and for the upper middle-class women especially, confined\r\nas they are by prescription and by economic circumstances to their\r\n"domestic sphere," this relation is the most real and most formative\r\nfactor of life. Hence a habit of mind favorable to devout observances\r\nand to the interpretation of the facts of life generally in terms of\r\npersonal status. The logic, and the logical processes, of her everyday\r\ndomestic life are carried over into the realm of the supernatural, and\r\nthe woman finds herself at home and content in a range of ideas which to\r\nthe man are in great measure alien and imbecile.\r\n\r\nStill the men of this class are also not devoid of piety, although it\r\nis commonly not piety of an aggressive or exuberant kind. The men of\r\nthe upper middle class commonly take a more complacent attitude towards\r\ndevout observances than the men of the artisan class. This may perhaps\r\nbe explained in part by saying that what is true of the women of\r\nthe class is true to a less extent also of the men. They are to an\r\nappreciable extent a sheltered class; and the patriarchal relation of\r\nstatus which still persists in their conjugal life and in their habitual\r\nuse of servants, may also act to conserve an archaic habit of mind and\r\nmay exercise a retarding influence upon the process of secularization\r\nwhich their habits of thought are undergoing. The relations of the\r\nAmerican middle-class man to the economic community, however, are\r\nusually pretty close and exacting; although it may be remarked, by the\r\nway and in qualification, that their economic activity frequently also\r\npartakes in some degree of the patriarchal or quasi-predatory character.\r\nThe occupations which are in good repute among this class and which have\r\nmost to do with shaping the class habits of thought, are the pecuniary\r\noccupations which have been spoken of in a similar connection in an\r\nearlier chapter. There is a good deal of the relation of arbitrary\r\ncommand and submission, and not a little of shrewd practice, remotely\r\nakin to predatory fraud. All this belongs on the plane of life of the\r\npredatory barbarian, to whom a devotional attitude is habitual. And in\r\naddition to this, the devout observances also commend themselves to this\r\nclass on the ground of reputability. But this latter incentive to piety\r\ndeserves treatment by itself and will be spoken of presently. There\r\nis no hereditary leisure class of any consequence in the American\r\ncommunity, except in the South. This Southern leisure class is somewhat\r\ngiven to devout observances; more so than any class of corresponding\r\npecuniary standing in other parts of the country. It is also well known\r\nthat the creeds of the South are of a more old-fashioned cast than their\r\ncounterparts in the North. Corresponding to this more archaic devotional\r\nlife of the South is the lower industrial development of that section.\r\nThe industrial organization of the South is at present, and especially\r\nit has been until quite recently, of a more primitive character than\r\nthat of the American community taken as a whole. It approaches nearer\r\nto handicraft, in the paucity and rudeness of its mechanical appliances,\r\nand there is more of the element of mastery and subservience. It may\r\nalso be noted that, owing to the peculiar economic circumstances of this\r\nsection, the greater devoutness of the Southern population, both white\r\nand black, is correlated with a scheme of life which in many ways\r\nrecalls the barbarian stages of industrial development. Among this\r\npopulation offenses of an archaic character also are and have been\r\nrelatively more prevalent and are less deprecated than they are\r\nelsewhere; as, for example, duels, brawls, feuds, drunkenness,\r\nhorse-racing, cock-fighting, gambling, male sexual incontinence\r\n(evidenced by the considerable number of mulattoes). There is also a\r\nlivelier sense of honor--an expression of sportsmanship and a derivative\r\nof predatory life.\r\n\r\nAs regards the wealthier class of the North, the American leisure class\r\nin the best sense of the term, it is, to begin with, scarcely possible\r\nto speak of an hereditary devotional attitude. This class is of too\r\nrecent growth to be possessed of a well-formed transmitted habit in this\r\nrespect, or even of a special home-grown tradition. Still, it may be\r\nnoted in passing that there is a perceptible tendency among this class\r\nto give in at least a nominal, and apparently something of a real,\r\nadherence to some one of the accredited creeds. Also, weddings,\r\nfunerals, and the like honorific events among this class are\r\npretty uniformly solemnized with some especial degree of religious\r\ncircumstance. It is impossible to say how far this adherence to a creed\r\nis a bona fide reversion to a devout habit of mind, and how far it is to\r\nbe classed as a case of protective mimicry assumed for the purpose of\r\nan outward assimilation to canons of reputability borrowed from foreign\r\nideals. Something of a substantial devotional propensity seems to\r\nbe present, to judge especially by the somewhat peculiar degree of\r\nritualistic observance which is in process of development in the\r\nupper-class cults. There is a tendency perceptible among the upper-class\r\nworshippers to affiliate themselves with those cults which lay\r\nrelatively great stress on ceremonial and on the spectacular accessories\r\nof worship; and in the churches in which an upper-class membership\r\npredominates, there is at the same time a tendency to accentuate the\r\nritualistic, at the cost of the intellectual features in the service and\r\nin the apparatus of the devout observances. This holds true even where\r\nthe church in question belongs to a denomination with a relatively\r\nslight general development of ritual and paraphernalia. This peculiar\r\ndevelopment of the ritualistic element is no doubt due in part to a\r\npredilection for conspicuously wasteful spectacles, but it probably\r\nalso in part indicates something of the devotional attitude of the\r\nworshippers. So far as the latter is true, it indicates a relatively\r\narchaic form of the devotional habit. The predominance of spectacular\r\neffects in devout observances is noticeable in all devout communities at\r\na relatively primitive stage of culture and with a slight intellectual\r\ndevelopment. It is especially characteristic of the barbarian culture.\r\nHere there is pretty uniformly present in the devout observances a\r\ndirect appeal to the emotions through all the avenues of sense. And\r\na tendency to return to this naive, sensational method of appeal is\r\nunmistakable in the upper-class churches of today. It is perceptible\r\nin a less degree in the cults which claim the allegiance of the lower\r\nleisure class and of the middle classes. There is a reversion to the\r\nuse of colored lights and brilliant spectacles, a freer use of symbols,\r\norchestral music and incense, and one may even detect in "processionals"\r\nand "recessionals" and in richly varied genuflexional evolutions, an\r\nincipient reversion to so antique an accessory of worship as the sacred\r\ndance. This reversion to spectacular observances is not confined to the\r\nupper-class cults, although it finds its best exemplification and its\r\nhighest accentuation in the higher pecuniary and social altitudes. The\r\ncults of the lower-class devout portion of the community, such as the\r\nSouthern Negroes and the backward foreign elements of the population,\r\nof course also show a strong inclination to ritual, symbolism, and\r\nspectacular effects; as might be expected from the antecedents and the\r\ncultural level of those classes. With these classes the prevalence of\r\nritual and anthropomorphism are not so much a matter of reversion as of\r\ncontinued development out of the past. But the use of ritual and related\r\nfeatures of devotion are also spreading in other directions. In the\r\nearly days of the American community the prevailing denominations\r\nstarted out with a ritual and paraphernalia of an austere simplicity;\r\nbut it is a matter familiar to every one that in the course of time\r\nthese denominations have, in a varying degree, adopted much of the\r\nspectacular elements which they once renounced. In a general way, this\r\ndevelopment has gone hand in hand with the growth of the wealth and the\r\nease of life of the worshippers and has reached its fullest expression\r\namong those classes which grade highest in wealth and repute.\r\n\r\nThe causes to which this pecuniary stratification of devoutness is\r\ndue have already been indicated in a general way in speaking of\r\nclass differences in habits of thought. Class differences as regards\r\ndevoutness are but a special expression of a generic fact. The lax\r\nallegiance of the lower middle class, or what may broadly be called the\r\nfailure of filial piety among this class, is chiefly perceptible among\r\nthe town populations engaged in the mechanical industries. In a general\r\nway, one does not, at the present time, look for a blameless filial\r\npiety among those classes whose employment approaches that of the\r\nengineer and the mechanician. These mechanical employments are in a\r\ndegree a modern fact. The handicraftsmen of earlier times, who served\r\nan industrial end of a character similar to that now served by the\r\nmechanician, were not similarly refractory under the discipline of\r\ndevoutness. The habitual activity of the men engaged in these branches\r\nof industry has greatly changed, as regards its intellectual discipline,\r\nsince the modern industrial processes have come into vogue; and the\r\ndiscipline to which the mechanician is exposed in his daily employment\r\naffects the methods and standards of his thinking also on topics which\r\nlie outside his everyday work. Familiarity with the highly organized and\r\nhighly impersonal industrial processes of the present acts to derange\r\nthe animistic habits of thought. The workman\'s office is becoming more\r\nand more exclusively that of discretion and supervision in a process of\r\nmechanical, dispassionate sequences. So long as the individual is the\r\nchief and typical prime mover in the process; so long as the obtrusive\r\nfeature of the industrial process is the dexterity and force of the\r\nindividual handicraftsman; so long the habit of interpreting phenomena\r\nin terms of personal motive and propensity suffers no such considerable\r\nand consistent derangement through facts as to lead to its elimination.\r\nBut under the later developed industrial processes, when the prime\r\nmovers and the contrivances through which they work are of an\r\nimpersonal, non-individual character, the grounds of generalization\r\nhabitually present in the workman\'s mind and the point of view from\r\nwhich he habitually apprehends phenomena is an enforced cognizance of\r\nmatter-of-fact sequence. The result, so far as concerts the workman\'s\r\nlife of faith, is a proclivity to undevout scepticism.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the devout habit of mind attains its best\r\ndevelopment under a relatively archaic culture; the term "devout" being\r\nof course here used in its anthropological sense simply, and not\r\nas implying anything with respect to the spiritual attitude so\r\ncharacterized, beyond the fact of a proneness to devout observances.\r\nIt appears also that this devout attitude marks a type of human nature\r\nwhich is more in consonance with the predatory mode of life than with\r\nthe later-developed, more consistently and organically industrial life\r\nprocess of the community. It is in large measure an expression of the\r\narchaic habitual sense of personal status--the relation of mastery and\r\nsubservience--and it therefore fits into the industrial scheme of the\r\npredatory and the quasi-peaceable culture, but does not fit into the\r\nindustrial scheme of the present. It also appears that this habit\r\npersists with greatest tenacity among those classes in the modern\r\ncommunities whose everyday life is most remote from the mechanical\r\nprocesses of industry and which are the most conservative also in other\r\nrespects; while for those classes that are habitually in immediate\r\ncontact with modern industrial processes, and whose habits of thought\r\nare therefore exposed to the constraining force of technological\r\nnecessities, that animistic interpretation of phenomena and that\r\nrespect of persons on which devout observance proceeds are in process\r\nof obsolescence. And also--as bearing especially on the present\r\ndiscussion--it appears that the devout habit to some extent\r\nprogressively gains in scope and elaboration among those classes in\r\nthe modern communities to whom wealth and leisure accrue in the most\r\npronounced degree. In this as in other relations, the institution of a\r\nleisure class acts to conserve, and even to rehabilitate, that archaic\r\ntype of human nature and those elements of the archaic culture which the\r\nindustrial evolution of society in its later stages acts to eliminate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Thirteen ~~ Survivals of the Non-Invidious Interests\r\n\r\nIn an increasing proportion as time goes on, the anthropomorphic\r\ncult, with its code of devout observations, suffers a progressive\r\ndisintegration through the stress of economic exigencies and the decay\r\nof the system of status. As this disintegration proceeds, there come to\r\nbe associated and blended with the devout attitude certain other motives\r\nand impulses that are not always of an anthropomorphic origin, nor\r\ntraceable to the habit of personal subservience. Not all of these\r\nsubsidiary impulses that blend with the habit of devoutness in the later\r\ndevotional life are altogether congruous with the devout attitude or\r\nwith the anthropomorphic apprehension of the sequence of phenomena. The\r\norigin being not the same, their action upon the scheme of devout\r\nlife is also not in the same direction. In many ways they traverse the\r\nunderlying norm of subservience or vicarious life to which the code of\r\ndevout observations and the ecclesiastical and sacerdotal institutions\r\nare to be traced as their substantial basis. Through the presence of\r\nthese alien motives the social and industrial regime of status gradually\r\ndisintegrates, and the canon of personal subservience loses the support\r\nderived from an unbroken tradition. Extraneous habits and proclivities\r\nencroach upon the field of action occupied by this canon, and it\r\npresently comes about that the ecclesiastical and sacerdotal structures\r\nare partially converted to other uses, in some measure alien to the\r\npurposes of the scheme of devout life as it stood in the days of the\r\nmost vigorous and characteristic development of the priesthood.\r\n\r\nAmong these alien motives which affect the devout scheme in its\r\nlater growth, may be mentioned the motives of charity and of social\r\ngood-fellowship, or conviviality; or, in more general terms, the various\r\nexpressions of the sense of human solidarity and sympathy. It may\r\nbe added that these extraneous uses of the ecclesiastical structure\r\ncontribute materially to its survival in name and form even among\r\npeople who may be ready to give up the substance of it. A still more\r\ncharacteristic and more pervasive alien element in the motives\r\nwhich have gone to formally uphold the scheme of devout life is that\r\nnon-reverent sense of aesthetic congruity with the environment, which is\r\nleft as a residue of the latter-day act of worship after elimination\r\nof its anthropomorphic content. This has done good service for the\r\nmaintenance of the sacerdotal institution through blending with the\r\nmotive of subservience. This sense of impulse of aesthetic congruity\r\nis not primarily of an economic character, but it has a considerable\r\nindirect effect in shaping the habit of mind of the individual for\r\neconomic purposes in the later stages of industrial development;\r\nits most perceptible effect in this regard goes in the direction of\r\nmitigating the somewhat pronounced self-regarding bias that has been\r\ntransmitted by tradition from the earlier, more competent phases of the\r\nregime of status. The economic bearing of this impulse is therefore seen\r\nto transverse that of the devout attitude; the former goes to qualify,\r\nif not eliminate, the self-regarding bias, through sublation of the\r\nantithesis or antagonism of self and not-self; while the latter, being\r\nand expression of the sense of personal subservience and mastery, goes\r\nto accentuate this antithesis and to insist upon the divergence between\r\nthe self-regarding interest and the interests of the generically human\r\nlife process.\r\n\r\nThis non-invidious residue of the religious life--the sense of communion\r\nwith the environment, or with the generic life process--as well as the\r\nimpulse of charity or of sociability, act in a pervasive way to shape\r\nmen\'s habits of thought for the economic purpose. But the action of\r\nall this class of proclivities is somewhat vague, and their effects are\r\ndifficult to trace in detail. So much seems clear, however, as that the\r\naction of this entire class of motives or aptitudes tends in a direction\r\ncontrary to the underlying principles of the institution of the leisure\r\nclass as already formulated. The basis of that institution, as well\r\nas of the anthropomorphic cults associated with it in the cultural\r\ndevelopment, is the habit of invidious comparison; and this habit is\r\nincongruous with the exercise of the aptitudes now in question. The\r\nsubstantial canons of the leisure-class scheme of life are a conspicuous\r\nwaste of time and substance and a withdrawal from the industrial\r\nprocess; while the particular aptitudes here in question assert\r\nthemselves, on the economic side, in a deprecation of waste and of\r\na futile manner of life, and in an impulse to participation in or\r\nidentification with the life process, whether it be on the economic side\r\nor in any other of its phases or aspects.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that these aptitudes and habits of life to which they give\r\nrise where circumstances favor their expression, or where they assert\r\nthemselves in a dominant way, run counter to the leisure-class scheme of\r\nlife; but it is not clear that life under the leisure-class scheme, as\r\nseen in the later stages of its development, tends consistently to the\r\nrepression of these aptitudes or to exemption from the habits of\r\nthought in which they express themselves. The positive discipline of the\r\nleisure-class scheme of life goes pretty much all the other way. In its\r\npositive discipline, by prescription and by selective elimination, the\r\nleisure-class scheme favors the all-pervading and all-dominating primacy\r\nof the canons of waste and invidious comparison at every conjuncture\r\nof life. But in its negative effects the tendency of the leisure-class\r\ndiscipline is not so unequivocally true to the fundamental canons of the\r\nscheme. In its regulation of human activity for the purpose of\r\npecuniary decency the leisure-class canon insists on withdrawal from\r\nthe industrial process. That is to say, it inhibits activity in the\r\ndirections in which the impecunious members of the community habitually\r\nput forth their efforts. Especially in the case of women, and more\r\nparticularly as regards the upper-class and upper-middle-class women\r\nof advanced industrial communities, this inhibition goes so far as to\r\ninsist on withdrawal even from the emulative process of accumulation by\r\nthe quasi-predator methods of the pecuniary occupations.\r\n\r\nThe pecuniary or the leisure-class culture, which set out as an\r\nemulative variant of the impulse of workmanship, is in its latest\r\ndevelopment beginning to neutralize its own ground, by eliminating\r\nthe habit of invidious comparison in respect of efficiency, or even\r\nof pecuniary standing. On the other hand, the fact that members of the\r\nleisure class, both men and women, are to some extent exempt from the\r\nnecessity of finding a livelihood in a competitive struggle with\r\ntheir fellows, makes it possible for members of this class not only to\r\nsurvive, but even, within bounds, to follow their bent in case they are\r\nnot gifted with the aptitudes which make for success in the competitive\r\nstruggle. That is to say, in the latest and fullest development of the\r\ninstitution, the livelihood of members of this class does not depend\r\non the possession and the unremitting exercise of those aptitudes are\r\ntherefore greater in the higher grades of the leisure class than in the\r\ngeneral average of a population living under the competitive system.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter, in discussing the conditions of survival of\r\narchaic traits, it has appeared that the peculiar position of the\r\nleisure class affords exceptionally favorable chances for the survival\r\nof traits which characterize the type of human nature proper to an\r\nearlier and obsolete cultural stage. The class is sheltered from the\r\nstress of economic exigencies, and is in this sense withdrawn from\r\nthe rude impact of forces which make for adaptation to the economic\r\nsituation. The survival in the leisure class, and under the\r\nleisure-class scheme of life, of traits and types that are reminiscent\r\nof the predatory culture has already been discussed. These aptitudes\r\nand habits have an exceptionally favorable chance of survival under the\r\nleisure-class regime. Not only does the sheltered pecuniary position of\r\nthe leisure class afford a situation favorable to the survival of such\r\nindividuals as are not gifted with the complement of aptitudes\r\nrequired for serviceability in the modern industrial process; but\r\nthe leisure-class canons of reputability at the same time enjoin the\r\nconspicuous exercise of certain predatory aptitudes. The employments\r\nin which the predatory aptitudes find exercise serve as an evidence of\r\nwealth, birth, and withdrawal from the industrial process. The survival\r\nof the predatory traits under the leisure-class culture is furthered\r\nboth negatively, through the industrial exemption of the class, and\r\npositively, through the sanction of the leisure-class canons of decency.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the survival of traits characteristic of the\r\nante-predatory savage culture the case is in some degree different.\r\nThe sheltered position of the leisure class favors the survival also of\r\nthese traits; but the exercise of the aptitudes for peace and good-will\r\ndoes not have the affirmative sanction of the code of proprieties.\r\nIndividuals gifted with a temperament that is reminiscent of the\r\nante-predatory culture are placed at something of an advantage within\r\nthe leisure class, as compared with similarly gifted individuals outside\r\nthe class, in that they are not under a pecuniary necessity to\r\nthwart these aptitudes that make for a non-competitive life; but such\r\nindividuals are still exposed to something of a moral constraint\r\nwhich urges them to disregard these inclinations, in that the code of\r\nproprieties enjoins upon them habits of life based on the predatory\r\naptitudes. So long as the system of status remains intact, and so long\r\nas the leisure class has other lines of non-industrial activity to take\r\nto than obvious killing of time in aimless and wasteful fatigation,\r\nso long no considerable departure from the leisure-class scheme of\r\nreputable life is to be looked for. The occurrence of non-predatory\r\ntemperament with the class at that stage is to be looked upon as a case\r\nof sporadic reversion. But the reputable non-industrial outlets for\r\nthe human propensity to action presently fail, through the advance of\r\neconomic development, the disappearance of large game, the decline of\r\nwar, the obsolescence of proprietary government, and the decay of the\r\npriestly office. When this happens, the situation begins to change.\r\nHuman life must seek expression in one direction if it may not in\r\nanother; and if the predatory outlet fails, relief is sought elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs indicated above, the exemption from pecuniary stress has been\r\ncarried farther in the case of the leisure-class women of the advanced\r\nindustrial communities than in that of any other considerable group of\r\npersons. The women may therefore be expected to show a more pronounced\r\nreversion to a non-invidious temperament than the men. But there is also\r\namong men of the leisure class a perceptible increase in the range and\r\nscope of activities that proceed from aptitudes which are not to be\r\nclassed as self-regarding, and the end of which is not an invidious\r\ndistinction. So, for instance, the greater number of men who have to do\r\nwith industry in the way of pecuniarily managing an enterprise take\r\nsome interest and some pride in seeing that the work is well done and\r\nis industrially effective, and this even apart from the profit which\r\nmay result from any improvement of this kind. The efforts of\r\ncommercial clubs and manufacturers\' organizations in this direction of\r\nnon-invidious advancement of industrial efficiency are also well know.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to some other than an invidious purpose in life has worked\r\nout in a multitude of organizations, the purpose of which is some work\r\nof charity or of social amelioration. These organizations are often of\r\na quasi-religious or pseudo-religious character, and are participated in\r\nby both men and women. Examples will present themselves in abundance\r\non reflection, but for the purpose of indicating the range of the\r\npropensities in question and of characterizing them, some of the\r\nmore obvious concrete cases may be cited. Such, for instance, are the\r\nagitation for temperance and similar social reforms, for prison reform,\r\nfor the spread of education, for the suppression of vice, and for the\r\navoidance of war by arbitration, disarmament, or other means; such\r\nare, in some measure, university settlements, neighborhood guilds, the\r\nvarious organizations typified by the Young Men\'s Christian Association\r\nand Young People\'s Society for Christian Endeavor, sewing-clubs, art\r\nclubs, and even commercial clubs; such are also, in some slight measure,\r\nthe pecuniary foundations of semi-public establishments for charity,\r\neducation, or amusement, whether they are endowed by wealthy individuals\r\nor by contributions collected from persons of smaller means--in so far\r\nas these establishments are not of a religious character.\r\n\r\nIt is of course not intended to say that these efforts proceed entirely\r\nfrom other motives than those of a self-regarding kind. What can be\r\nclaimed is that other motives are present in the common run of cases,\r\nand that the perceptibly greater prevalence of effort of this kind under\r\nthe circumstances of the modern industrial life than under the unbroken\r\nregime of the principle of status, indicates the presence in modern life\r\nof an effective scepticism with respect to the full legitimacy of an\r\nemulative scheme of life. It is a matter of sufficient notoriety to have\r\nbecome a commonplace jest that extraneous motives are commonly present\r\namong the incentives to this class of work--motives of a self-regarding\r\nkind, and especially the motive of an invidious distinction. To such an\r\nextent is this true, that many ostensible works of disinterested public\r\nspirit are no doubt initiated and carried on with a view primarily to\r\nthe enhance repute or even to the pecuniary gain, of their promoters. In\r\nthe case of some considerable groups of organizations or establishments\r\nof this kind the invidious motive is apparently the dominant motive both\r\nwith the initiators of the work and with their supporters. This last\r\nremark would hold true especially with respect to such works as lend\r\ndistinction to their doer through large and conspicuous expenditure; as,\r\nfor example, the foundation of a university or of a public library\r\nor museum; but it is also, and perhaps equally, true of the more\r\ncommonplace work of participation in such organizations. These serve\r\nto authenticate the pecuniary reputability of their members, as well as\r\ngratefully to keep them in mind of their superior status by pointing\r\nthe contrast between themselves and the lower-lying humanity in whom the\r\nwork of amelioration is to be wrought; as, for example, the university\r\nsettlement, which now has some vogue. But after all allowances and\r\ndeductions have been made, there is left some remainder of motives of\r\na non-emulative kind. The fact itself that distinction or a decent good\r\nfame is sought by this method is evidence of a prevalent sense of\r\nthe legitimacy, and of the presumptive effectual presence, of a\r\nnon-emulative, non-invidious interest, as a consistent factor in the\r\nhabits of thought of modern communities.\r\n\r\nIn all this latter-day range of leisure-class activities that proceed\r\non the basis of a non-invidious and non-religious interest, it is to\r\nbe noted that the women participate more actively and more persistently\r\nthan the men--except, of course, in the case of such works as require\r\na large expenditure of means. The dependent pecuniary position of the\r\nwomen disables them for work requiring large expenditure. As regards\r\nthe general range of ameliorative work, the members of the priesthood\r\nor clergy of the less naively devout sects, or the secularized\r\ndenominations, are associated with the class of women. This is as the\r\ntheory would have it. In other economic relations, also, this clergy\r\nstands in a somewhat equivocal position between the class of women and\r\nthat of the men engaged in economic pursuits. By tradition and by the\r\nprevalent sense of the proprieties, both the clergy and the women of\r\nthe well-to-do classes are placed in the position of a vicarious leisure\r\nclass; with both classes the characteristic relation which goes to form\r\nthe habits of thought of the class is a relation of subservience--that\r\nis to say, an economic relation conceived in personal terms; in both\r\nclasses there is consequently perceptible a special proneness to\r\nconstrue phenomena in terms of personal relation rather than of causal\r\nsequence; both classes are so inhibited by the canons of decency from\r\nthe ceremonially unclean processes of the lucrative or productive\r\noccupations as to make participation in the industrial life process\r\nof today a moral impossibility for them. The result of this ceremonial\r\nexclusion from productive effort of the vulgar sort is to draft a\r\nrelatively large share of the energies of the modern feminine\r\nand priestly classes into the service of other interests than the\r\nself-regarding one. The code leaves no alternative direction in which\r\nthe impulse to purposeful action may find expression. The effect of a\r\nconsistent inhibition on industrially useful activity in the case of the\r\nleisure-class women shows itself in a restless assertion of the impulse\r\nto workmanship in other directions than that of business activity. As\r\nhas been noticed already, the everyday life of the well-to-do women and\r\nthe clergy contains a larger element of status than that of the average\r\nof the men, especially than that of the men engaged in the modern\r\nindustrial occupations proper. Hence the devout attitude survives in a\r\nbetter state of preservation among these classes than among the common\r\nrun of men in the modern communities. Hence an appreciable share of the\r\nenergy which seeks expression in a non-lucrative employment among these\r\nmembers of the vicarious leisure classes may be expected to eventuate in\r\ndevout observances and works of piety. Hence, in part, the excess of\r\nthe devout proclivity in women, spoken of in the last chapter. But it\r\nis more to the present point to note the effect of this proclivity\r\nin shaping the action and coloring the purposes of the non-lucrative\r\nmovements and organizations here under discussion. Where this\r\ndevout coloring is present it lowers the immediate efficiency of\r\nthe organizations for any economic end to which their efforts may be\r\ndirected. Many organizations, charitable and ameliorative, divide their\r\nattention between the devotional and the secular well-being of the\r\npeople whose interests they aim to further. It can scarcely be doubted\r\nthat if they were to give an equally serious attention and effort\r\nundividedly to the secular interests of these people, the immediate\r\neconomic value of their work should be appreciably higher than it is.\r\nIt might of course similarly be said, if this were the place to say it,\r\nthat the immediate efficiency of these works of amelioration for the\r\ndevout might be greater if it were not hampered with the secular motives\r\nand aims which are usually present.\r\n\r\nSome deduction is to be made from the economic value of this class of\r\nnon-invidious enterprise, on account of the intrusion of the devotional\r\ninterest. But there are also deductions to be made on account of the\r\npresence of other alien motives which more or less broadly traverse\r\nthe economic trend of this non-emulative expression of the instinct\r\nof workmanship. To such an extent is this seen to be true on a closer\r\nscrutiny, that, when all is told, it may even appear that this general\r\nclass of enterprises is of an altogether dubious economic value--as\r\nmeasured in terms of the fullness or facility of life of the individuals\r\nor classes to whose amelioration the enterprise is directed.\r\nFor instance, many of the efforts now in reputable vogue for the\r\namelioration of the indigent population of large cities are of the\r\nnature, in great part, of a mission of culture. It is by this means\r\nsought to accelerate the rate of speed at which given elements of the\r\nupper-class culture find acceptance in the everyday scheme of life of\r\nthe lower classes. The solicitude of "settlements," for example, is in\r\npart directed to enhance the industrial efficiency of the poor and to\r\nteach them the more adequate utilization of the means at hand; but it\r\nis also no less consistently directed to the inculcation, by precept and\r\nexample, of certain punctilios of upper-class propriety in manners and\r\ncustoms. The economic substance of these proprieties will commonly be\r\nfound on scrutiny to be a conspicuous waste of time and goods. Those\r\ngood people who go out to humanize the poor are commonly, and advisedly,\r\nextremely scrupulous and silently insistent in matters of decorum and\r\nthe decencies of life. They are commonly persons of an exemplary life\r\nand gifted with a tenacious insistence on ceremonial cleanness in the\r\nvarious items of their daily consumption. The cultural or civilizing\r\nefficacy of this inculcation of correct habits of thought with respect\r\nto the consumption of time and commodities is scarcely to be overrated;\r\nnor is its economic value to the individual who acquires these higher\r\nand more reputable ideals inconsiderable. Under the circumstances of\r\nthe existing pecuniary culture, the reputability, and consequently\r\nthe success, of the individual is in great measure dependent on his\r\nproficiency in demeanor and methods of consumption that argue habitual\r\nwaste of time and goods. But as regards the ulterior economic bearing\r\nof this training in worthier methods of life, it is to be said that\r\nthe effect wrought is in large part a substitution of costlier or\r\nless efficient methods of accomplishing the same material results, in\r\nrelations where the material result is the fact of substantial economic\r\nvalue. The propaganda of culture is in great part an inculcation of\r\nnew tastes, or rather of a new schedule of proprieties, which have been\r\nadapted to the upper-class scheme of life under the guidance of the\r\nleisure-class formulation of the principles of status and pecuniary\r\ndecency. This new schedule of proprieties is intruded into the\r\nlower-class scheme of life from the code elaborated by an element of\r\nthe population whose life lies outside the industrial process; and this\r\nintrusive schedule can scarcely be expected to fit the exigencies of\r\nlife for these lower classes more adequately than the schedule already\r\nin vogue among them, and especially not more adequately than the\r\nschedule which they are themselves working out under the stress of\r\nmodern industrial life.\r\n\r\nAll this of course does not question the fact that the proprieties\r\nof the substituted schedule are more decorous than those which they\r\ndisplace. The doubt which presents itself is simply a doubt as to the\r\neconomic expediency of this work of regeneration--that is to say, the\r\neconomic expediency in that immediate and material bearing in which the\r\neffects of the change can be ascertained with some degree of confidence,\r\nand as viewed from the standpoint not of the individual but of the\r\nfacility of life of the collectivity. For an appreciation of the\r\neconomic expediency of these enterprises of amelioration, therefore,\r\ntheir effective work is scarcely to be taken at its face value, even\r\nwhere the aim of the enterprise is primarily an economic one and where\r\nthe interest on which it proceeds is in no sense self-regarding or\r\ninvidious. The economic reform wrought is largely of the nature of a\r\npermutation in the methods of conspicuous waste.\r\n\r\nBut something further is to be said with respect to the character of the\r\ndisinterested motives and canons of procedure in all work of this\r\nclass that is affected by the habits of thought characteristic of the\r\npecuniary culture; and this further consideration may lead to a further\r\nqualification of the conclusions already reached. As has been seen in\r\nan earlier chapter, the canons of reputability or decency under the\r\npecuniary culture insist on habitual futility of effort as the mark of a\r\npecuniarily blameless life. There results not only a habit of disesteem\r\nof useful occupations, but there results also what is of more decisive\r\nconsequence in guiding the action of any organized body of people that\r\nlays claim to social good repute. There is a tradition which requires\r\nthat one should not be vulgarly familiar with any of the processes or\r\ndetails that have to do with the material necessities of life. One may\r\nmeritoriously show a quantitative interest in the well-being of the\r\nvulgar, through subscriptions or through work on managing committees and\r\nthe like. One may, perhaps even more meritoriously, show solicitude in\r\ngeneral and in detail for the cultural welfare of the vulgar, in the\r\nway of contrivances for elevating their tastes and affording them\r\nopportunities for spiritual amelioration. But one should not betray an\r\nintimate knowledge of the material circumstances of vulgar life, or of\r\nthe habits of thought of the vulgar classes, such as would effectually\r\ndirect the efforts of these organizations to a materially useful end.\r\nThis reluctance to avow an unduly intimate knowledge of the lower-class\r\nconditions of life in detail of course prevails in very different\r\ndegrees in different individuals; but there is commonly enough of\r\nit present collectively in any organization of the kind in question\r\nprofoundly to influence its course of action. By its cumulative action\r\nin shaping the usage and precedents of any such body, this shrinking\r\nfrom an imputation of unseemly familiarity with vulgar life tends\r\ngradually to set aside the initial motives of the enterprise, in favor\r\nof certain guiding principles of good repute, ultimately reducible to\r\nterms of pecuniary merit. So that in an organization of long standing\r\nthe initial motive of furthering the facility of life in these classes\r\ncomes gradually to be an ostensible motive only, and the vulgarly\r\neffective work of the organization tends to obsolescence.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the efficiency of organizations for non-invidious\r\nwork in this respect is true also as regards the work of individuals\r\nproceeding on the same motives; though it perhaps holds true with more\r\nqualification for individuals than for organized enterprises. The habit\r\nof gauging merit by the leisure-class canons of wasteful expenditure and\r\nunfamiliarity with vulgar life, whether on the side of production or of\r\nconsumption, is necessarily strong in the individuals who aspire to do\r\nsome work of public utility. And if the individual should forget his\r\nstation and turn his efforts to vulgar effectiveness, the common sense\r\nof the community-the sense of pecuniary decency--would presently\r\nreject his work and set him right. An example of this is seen in the\r\nadministration of bequests made by public-spirited men for the single\r\npurpose (at least ostensibly) of furthering the facility of human life\r\nin some particular respect. The objects for which bequests of this class\r\nare most frequently made at present are\r\nare schools, libraries, hospitals, and asylums for the infirm or\r\nunfortunate. The avowed purpose of the donor in these cases is the\r\namelioration of human life in the particular respect which is named\r\nin the bequest; but it will be found an invariable rule that in\r\nthe execution of the work not a little of other motives, frequency\r\nincompatible with the initial motive, is present and determines the\r\nparticular disposition eventually made of a good share of the means\r\nwhich have been set apart by the bequest. Certain funds, for instance,\r\nmay have been set apart as a foundation for a foundling asylum or a\r\nretreat for invalids. The diversion of expenditure to honorific waste in\r\nsuch cases is not uncommon enough to cause surprise or even to raise a\r\nsmile. An appreciable share of the funds is spent in the construction\r\nof an edifice faced with some aesthetically objectionable but expensive\r\nstone, covered with grotesque and incongruous details, and designed, in\r\nits battlemented walls and turrets and its massive portals and strategic\r\napproaches, to suggest certain barbaric methods of warfare. The interior\r\nof the structure shows the same pervasive guidance of the canons of\r\nconspicuous waste and predatory exploit. The windows, for instance,\r\nto go no farther into detail, are placed with a view to impress their\r\npecuniary excellence upon the chance beholder from the outside, rather\r\nthan with a view to effectiveness for their ostensible end in the\r\nconvenience or comfort of the beneficiaries within; and the detail of\r\ninterior arrangement is required to conform itself as best it may to\r\nthis alien but imperious requirement of pecuniary beauty.\r\n\r\nIn all this, of course, it is not to be presumed that the donor would\r\nhave found fault, or that he would have done otherwise if he had taken\r\ncontrol in person; it appears that in those cases where such a personal\r\ndirection is exercised--where the enterprise is conducted by direct\r\nexpenditure and superintendence instead of by bequest--the aims and\r\nmethods of management are not different in this respect. Nor would the\r\nbeneficiaries, or the outside observers whose ease or vanity are not\r\nimmediately touched, be pleased with a different disposition of the\r\nfunds. It would suit no one to have the enterprise conducted with a view\r\ndirectly to the most economical and effective use of the means at hand\r\nfor the initial, material end of the foundation. All concerned, whether\r\ntheir interest is immediate and self-regarding, or contemplative only,\r\nagree that some considerable share of the expenditure should go to\r\nthe higher or spiritual needs derived from the habit of an invidious\r\ncomparison in predatory exploit and pecuniary waste. But this only goes\r\nto say that the canons of emulative and pecuniary reputability so far\r\npervade the common sense of the community as to permit no escape or\r\nevasion, even in the case of an enterprise which ostensibly proceeds\r\nentirely on the basis of a non-invidious interest.\r\n\r\nIt may even be that the enterprise owes its honorific virtue, as a means\r\nof enhancing the donor\'s good repute, to the imputed presence of this\r\nnon-invidious motive; but that does not hinder the invidious interest\r\nfrom guiding the expenditure. The effectual presence of motives of an\r\nemulative or invidious origin in non-emulative works of this kind\r\nmight be shown at length and with detail, in any one of the classes of\r\nenterprise spoken of above. Where these honorific details occur, in such\r\ncases, they commonly masquerade under designations that belong in the\r\nfield of the aesthetic, ethical or economic interest. These special\r\nmotives, derived from the standards and canons of the pecuniary culture,\r\nact surreptitiously to divert effort of a non-invidious kind from\r\neffective service, without disturbing the agent\'s sense of good\r\nintention or obtruding upon his consciousness the substantial futility\r\nof his work. Their effect might be traced through the entire range\r\nof that schedule of non-invidious, meliorative enterprise that is so\r\nconsiderable a feature, and especially so conspicuous a feature, in the\r\novert scheme of life of the well-to-do. But the theoretical bearing is\r\nperhaps clear enough and may require no further illustration; especially\r\nas some detailed attention will be given to one of these lines of\r\nenterprise--the establishments for the higher learning--in another\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances of the sheltered situation in which the leisure\r\nclass is placed there seems, therefore, to be something of a reversion\r\nto the range of non-invidious impulses that characterizes the\r\nante-predatory savage culture. The reversion comprises both the sense of\r\nworkmanship and the proclivity to indolence and good-fellowship. But\r\nin the modern scheme of life canons of conduct based on pecuniary or\r\ninvidious merit stand in the way of a free exercise of these impulses;\r\nand the dominant presence of these canons of conduct goes far to divert\r\nsuch efforts as are made on the basis of the non-invidious interest to\r\nthe service of that invidious interest on which the pecuniary culture\r\nrests. The canons of pecuniary decency are reducible for the present\r\npurpose to the principles of waste, futility, and ferocity. The\r\nrequirements of decency are imperiously present in meliorative\r\nenterprise as in other lines of conduct, and exercise a selective\r\nsurveillance over the details of conduct and management in any\r\nenterprise. By guiding and adapting the method in detail, these canons\r\nof decency go far to make all non-invidious aspiration or effort\r\nnugatory. The pervasive, impersonal, un-eager principle of futility is\r\nat hand from day to day and works obstructively to hinder the effectual\r\nexpression of so much of the surviving ante-predatory aptitudes as is to\r\nbe classed under the instinct of workmanship; but its presence does not\r\npreclude the transmission of those aptitudes or the continued recurrence\r\nof an impulse to find expression for them.\r\n\r\nIn the later and farther development of the pecuniary culture, the\r\nrequirement of withdrawal from the industrial process in order to\r\navoid social odium is carried so far as to comprise abstention from\r\nthe emulative employments. At this advanced stage the pecuniary culture\r\nnegatively favors the assertion of the non-invidious propensities\r\nby relaxing the stress laid on the merit of emulative, predatory,\r\nor pecuniary occupations, as compared with those of an industrial\r\nor productive kind. As was noticed above, the requirement of such\r\nwithdrawal from all employment that is of human use applies more\r\nrigorously to the upper-class women than to any other class, unless the\r\npriesthood of certain cults might be cited as an exception, perhaps\r\nmore apparent than real, to this rule. The reason for the more extreme\r\ninsistence on a futile life for this class of women than for the men\r\nof the same pecuniary and social grade lies in their being not only an\r\nupper-grade leisure class but also at the same time a vicarious\r\nleisure class. There is in their case a double ground for a consistent\r\nwithdrawal from useful effort.\r\n\r\nIt has been well and repeatedly said by popular writers and speakers who\r\nreflect the common sense of intelligent people on questions of social\r\nstructure and function that the position of woman in any community\r\nis the most striking index of the level of culture attained by the\r\ncommunity, and it might be added, by any given class in the community.\r\nThis remark is perhaps truer as regards the stage of economic\r\ndevelopment than as regards development in any other respect. At the\r\nsame time the position assigned to the woman in the accepted scheme of\r\nlife, in any community or under any culture, is in a very great degree\r\nan expression of traditions which have been shaped by the circumstances\r\nof an earlier phase of development, and which have been but partially\r\nadapted to the existing economic circumstances, or to the existing\r\nexigencies of temperament and habits of mind by which the women living\r\nunder this modern economic situation are actuated.\r\n\r\nThe fact has already been remarked upon incidentally in the course of\r\nthe discussion of the growth of economic institutions generally, and\r\nin particular in speaking of vicarious leisure and of dress, that the\r\nposition of women in the modern economic scheme is more widely and\r\nmore consistently at variance with the promptings of the instinct of\r\nworkmanship than is the position of the men of the same classes. It\r\nis also apparently true that the woman\'s temperament includes a larger\r\nshare of this instinct that approves peace and disapproves futility.\r\nIt is therefore not a fortuitous circumstance that the women of modern\r\nindustrial communities show a livelier sense of the discrepancy\r\nbetween the accepted scheme of life and the exigencies of the economic\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe several phases of the "woman question" have brought out in\r\nintelligible form the extent to which the life of women in modern\r\nsociety, and in the polite circles especially, is regulated by a body of\r\ncommon sense formulated under the economic circumstances of an earlier\r\nphase of development. It is still felt that woman\'s life, in its civil,\r\neconomic, and social bearing, is essentially and normally a vicarious\r\nlife, the merit or demerit of which is, in the nature of things, to\r\nbe imputed to some other individual who stands in some relation of\r\nownership or tutelage to the woman. So, for instance, any action on the\r\npart of a woman which traverses an injunction of the accepted schedule\r\nof proprieties is felt to reflect immediately upon the honor of the man\r\nwhose woman she is. There may of course be some sense of incongruity\r\nin the mind of any one passing an opinion of this kind on the woman\'s\r\nfrailty or perversity; but the common-sense judgment of the community in\r\nsuch matters is, after all, delivered without much hesitation, and few\r\nmen would question the legitimacy of their sense of an outraged tutelage\r\nin any case that might arise. On the other hand, relatively little\r\ndiscredit attaches to a woman through the evil deeds of the man with\r\nwhom her life is associated.\r\n\r\nThe good and beautiful scheme of life, then--that is to say the scheme\r\nto which we are habituated--assigns to the woman a "sphere" ancillary\r\nto the activity of the man; and it is felt that any departure from the\r\ntraditions of her assigned round of duties is unwomanly. If the\r\nquestion is as to civil rights or the suffrage, our common sense in the\r\nmatter--that is to say the logical deliverance of our general scheme\r\nof life upon the point in question--says that the woman should be\r\nrepresented in the body politic and before the law, not immediately in\r\nher own person, but through the mediation of the head of the\r\nhousehold to which she belongs. It is unfeminine in her to aspire to a\r\nself-directing, self-centered life; and our common sense tells us that\r\nher direct participation in the affairs of the community, civil or\r\nindustrial, is a menace to that social order which expresses our habits\r\nof thought as they have been formed under the guidance of the traditions\r\nof the pecuniary culture. "All this fume and froth of \'emancipating\r\nwoman from the slavery of man\' and so on, is, to use the chaste and\r\nexpressive language of Elizabeth Cady Stanton inversely, \'utter rot.\'\r\nThe social relations of the sexes are fixed by nature. Our entire\r\ncivilization--that is whatever is good in it--is based on the home."\r\nThe "home" is the household with a male head. This view, but commonly\r\nexpressed even more chastely, is the prevailing view of the woman\'s\r\nstatus, not only among the common run of the men of civilized\r\ncommunities, but among the women as well. Women have a very alert sense\r\nof what the scheme of proprieties requires, and while it is true that\r\nmany of them are ill at ease under the details which the code imposes,\r\nthere are few who do not recognize that the existing moral order, of\r\nnecessity and by the divine right of prescription, places the woman in\r\na position ancillary to the man. In the last analysis, according to her\r\nown sense of what is good and beautiful, the woman\'s life is, and in\r\ntheory must be, an expression of the man\'s life at the second remove.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this pervading sense of what is the good and natural\r\nplace for the woman, there is also perceptible an incipient development\r\nof sentiment to the effect that this whole arrangement of tutelage and\r\nvicarious life and imputation of merit and demerit is somehow a mistake.\r\nOr, at least, that even if it may be a natural growth and a good\r\narrangement in its time and place, and in spite of its patent aesthetic\r\nvalue, still it does not adequately serve the more everyday ends of life\r\nin a modern industrial community. Even that large and substantial body\r\nof well-bred, upper and middle-class women to whose dispassionate,\r\nmatronly sense of the traditional proprieties this relation of status\r\ncommends itself as fundamentally and eternally right-even these, whose\r\nattitude is conservative, commonly find some slight discrepancy in\r\ndetail between things as they are and things as they should be in this\r\nrespect. But that less manageable body of modern women who, by force of\r\nyouth, education, or temperament, are in some degree out of touch with\r\nthe traditions of status received from the barbarian culture, and\r\nin whom there is, perhaps, an undue reversion to the impulse of\r\nself-expression and workmanship--these are touched with a sense of\r\ngrievance too vivid to leave them at rest.\r\n\r\nIn this "New-Woman" movement--as these blind and incoherent efforts to\r\nrehabilitate the woman\'s pre-glacial standing have been named--there\r\nare at least two elements discernible, both of which are of an economic\r\ncharacter. These two elements or motives are expressed by the double\r\nwatchword, "Emancipation" and "Work." Each of these words is recognized\r\nto stand for something in the way of a wide-spread sense of grievance.\r\nThe prevalence of the sentiment is recognized even by people who do not\r\nsee that there is any real ground for a grievance in the situation as\r\nit stands today. It is among the women of the well-to-do classes, in the\r\ncommunities which are farthest advanced in industrial development, that\r\nthis sense of a grievance to be redressed is most alive and finds most\r\nfrequent expression. That is to say, in other words, there is a demand,\r\nmore or less serious, for emancipation from all relation of status,\r\ntutelage, or vicarious life; and the revulsion asserts itself especially\r\namong the class of women upon whom the scheme of life handed down from\r\nthe regime of status imposes with least litigation a vicarious life, and\r\nin those communities whose economic development has departed farthest\r\nfrom the circumstances to which this traditional scheme is adapted. The\r\ndemand comes from that portion of womankind which is excluded by the\r\ncanons of good repute from all effectual work, and which is closely\r\nreserved for a life of leisure and conspicuous consumption.\r\n\r\nMore than one critic of this new-woman movement has misapprehended its\r\nmotive. The case of the American "new woman" has lately been summed\r\nup with some warmth by a popular observer of social phenomena: "She is\r\npetted by her husband, the most devoted and hard-working of husbands in\r\nthe world.... She is the superior of her husband in education, and\r\nin almost every respect. She is surrounded by the most numerous and\r\ndelicate attentions. Yet she is not satisfied.... The Anglo-Saxon \'new\r\nwoman\' is the most ridiculous production of modern times, and destined\r\nto be the most ghastly failure of the century." Apart from the\r\ndeprecation--perhaps well placed--which is contained in this\r\npresentment, it adds nothing but obscurity to the woman question. The\r\ngrievance of the new woman is made up of those things which this typical\r\ncharacterization of the movement urges as reasons why she should be\r\ncontent. She is petted, and is permitted, or even required, to consume\r\nlargely and conspicuously--vicariously for her husband or other\r\nnatural guardian. She is exempted, or debarred, from vulgarly useful\r\nemployment--in order to perform leisure vicariously for the good repute\r\nof her natural (pecuniary) guardian. These offices are the conventional\r\nmarks of the un-free, at the same time that they are incompatible with\r\nthe human impulse to purposeful activity. But the woman is endowed\r\nwith her share-which there is reason to believe is more than an even\r\nshare--of the instinct of workmanship, to which futility of life or of\r\nexpenditure is obnoxious. She must unfold her life activity in response\r\nto the direct, unmediated stimuli of the economic environment with which\r\nshe is in contact. The impulse is perhaps stronger upon the woman\r\nthan upon the man to live her own life in her own way and to enter the\r\nindustrial process of the community at something nearer than the second\r\nremove.\r\n\r\nSo long as the woman\'s place is consistently that of a drudge, she is,\r\nin the average of cases, fairly contented with her lot. She not only\r\nhas something tangible and purposeful to do, but she has also no time or\r\nthought to spare for a rebellious assertion of such human propensity to\r\nself-direction as she has inherited. And after the stage of universal\r\nfemale drudgery is passed, and a vicarious leisure without strenuous\r\napplication becomes the accredited employment of the women of the\r\nwell-to-do classes, the prescriptive force of the canon of pecuniary\r\ndecency, which requires the observance of ceremonial futility on their\r\npart, will long preserve high-minded women from any sentimental leaning\r\nto self-direction and a "sphere of usefulness." This is especially true\r\nduring the earlier phases of the pecuniary culture, while the leisure\r\nof the leisure class is still in great measure a predatory activity, an\r\nactive assertion of mastery in which there is enough of tangible\r\npurpose of an invidious kind to admit of its being taken seriously as an\r\nemployment to which one may without shame put one\'s hand. This condition\r\nof things has obviously lasted well down into the present in some\r\ncommunities. It continues to hold to a different extent for different\r\nindividuals, varying with the vividness of the sense of status and with\r\nthe feebleness of the impulse to workmanship with which the individual\r\nis endowed. But where the economic structure of the community has so\r\nfar outgrown the scheme of life based on status that the relation of\r\npersonal subservience is no longer felt to be the sole "natural" human\r\nrelation; there the ancient habit of purposeful activity will begin\r\nto assert itself in the less conformable individuals against the more\r\nrecent, relatively superficial, relatively ephemeral habits and views\r\nwhich the predatory and the pecuniary culture have contributed to our\r\nscheme of life. These habits and views begin to lose their coercive\r\nforce for the community or the class in question so soon as the habit of\r\nmind and the views of life due to the predatory and the quasi-peaceable\r\ndiscipline cease to be in fairly close accord with the later-developed\r\neconomic situation. This is evident in the case of the industrious\r\nclasses of modern communities; for them the leisure-class scheme of life\r\nhas lost much of its binding force, especially as regards the element of\r\nstatus. But it is also visibly being verified in the case of the upper\r\nclasses, though not in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe habits derived from the predatory and quasi-peaceable culture are\r\nrelatively ephemeral variants of certain underlying propensities and\r\nmental characteristics of the race; which it owes to the protracted\r\ndiscipline of the earlier, proto-anthropoid cultural stage of peaceable,\r\nrelatively undifferentiated economic life carried on in contact with a\r\nrelatively simple and invariable material environment. When the habits\r\nsuperinduced by the emulative method of life have ceased to enjoy the\r\nsection of existing economic exigencies, a process of disintegration\r\nsets in whereby the habits of thought of more recent growth and of a\r\nless generic character to some extent yield the ground before the more\r\nancient and more pervading spiritual characteristics of the race.\r\n\r\nIn a sense, then, the new-woman movement marks a reversion to a more\r\ngeneric type of human character, or to a less differentiated\r\nexpression of human nature. It is a type of human nature which is to be\r\ncharacterized as proto-anthropoid, and, as regards the substance if not\r\nthe form of its dominant traits, it belongs to a cultural stage that may\r\nbe classed as possibly sub-human. The particular movement or evolutional\r\nfeature in question of course shares this characterization with the rest\r\nof the later social development, in so far as this social development\r\nshows evidence of a reversion to the spiritual attitude that\r\ncharacterizes the earlier, undifferentiated stage of economic\r\nrevolution. Such evidence of a general tendency to reversion from the\r\ndominance of the invidious interest is not entirely wanting, although it\r\nis neither plentiful nor unquestionably convincing. The general decay\r\nof the sense of status in modern industrial communities goes some way as\r\nevidence in this direction; and the perceptible return to a disapproval\r\nof futility in human life, and a disapproval of such activities as serve\r\nonly the individual gain at the cost of the collectivity or at the\r\ncost of other social groups, is evidence to a like effect. There is a\r\nperceptible tendency to deprecate the infliction of pain, as well as to\r\ndiscredit all marauding enterprises, even where these expressions of the\r\ninvidious interest do not tangibly work to the material detriment of\r\nthe community or of the individual who passes an opinion on them. It\r\nmay even be said that in the modern industrial communities the average,\r\ndispassionate sense of men says that the ideal character is a character\r\nwhich makes for peace, good-will, and economic efficiency, rather than\r\nfor a life of self-seeking, force, fraud, and mastery.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the leisure class is not consistently for or against\r\nthe rehabilitation of this proto-anthropoid human nature. So far\r\nas concerns the chance of survival of individuals endowed with an\r\nexceptionally large share of the primitive traits, the sheltered\r\nposition of the class favors its members directly by withdrawing them\r\nfrom the pecuniary struggle; but indirectly, through the leisure-class\r\ncanons of conspicuous waste of goods and effort, the institution of a\r\nleisure class lessens the chance of survival of such individuals in the\r\nentire body of the population. The decent requirements of waste absorb\r\nthe surplus energy of the population in an invidious struggle and leave\r\nno margin for the non-invidious expression of life. The remoter, less\r\ntangible, spiritual effects of the discipline of decency go in the same\r\ndirection and work perhaps more effectually to the same end. The\r\ncanons of decent life are an elaboration of the principle of invidious\r\ncomparison, and they accordingly act consistently to inhibit all\r\nnon-invidious effort and to inculcate the self-regarding attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Fourteen ~~ The Higher Learning as an Expression of\r\nthe Pecuniary Culture\r\n\r\nTo the end that suitable habits of thought on certain heads may be\r\nconserved in the incoming generation, a scholastic discipline is\r\nsanctioned by the common sense of the community and incorporated into\r\nthe accredited scheme of life. The habits of thought which are so\r\nformed under the guidance of teachers and scholastic traditions have\r\nan economic value--a value as affecting the serviceability of the\r\nindividual--no less real than the similar economic value of the habits\r\nof thought formed without such guidance under the discipline of everyday\r\nlife. Whatever characteristics of the accredited scholastic scheme and\r\ndiscipline are traceable to the predilections of the leisure class or to\r\nthe guidance of the canons of pecuniary merit are to be set down to the\r\naccount of that institution, and whatever economic value these features\r\nof the educational scheme possess are the expression in detail of the\r\nvalue of that institution. It will be in place, therefore, to point out\r\nany peculiar features of the educational system which are traceable to\r\nthe leisure-class scheme of life, whether as regards the aim and method\r\nof the discipline, or as regards the compass and character of the body\r\nof knowledge inculcated. It is in learning proper, and more particularly\r\nin the higher learning, that the influence of leisure-class ideals is\r\nmost patent; and since the purpose here is not to make an exhaustive\r\ncollation of data showing the effect of the pecuniary culture upon\r\neducation, but rather to illustrate the method and trend of the\r\nleisure-class influence in education, a survey of certain salient\r\nfeatures of the higher learning, such as may serve this purpose, is all\r\nthat will be attempted.\r\n\r\nIn point of derivation and early development, learning is somewhat\r\nclosely related to the devotional function of the community,\r\nparticularly to the body of observances in which the service rendered\r\nthe supernatural leisure class expresses itself. The service by which it\r\nis sought to conciliate supernatural agencies in the primitive cults is\r\nnot an industrially profitable employment of the community\'s time and\r\neffort. It is, therefore, in great part, to be classed as a vicarious\r\nleisure performed for the supernatural powers with whom negotiations\r\nare carried on and whose good-will the service and the professions of\r\nsubservience are conceived to procure. In great part, the early learning\r\nconsisted in an acquisition of knowledge and facility in the service of\r\na supernatural agent. It was therefore closely analogous in character to\r\nthe training required for the domestic service of a temporal master. To\r\na great extent, the knowledge acquired under the priestly teachers of\r\nthe primitive community was knowledge of ritual and ceremonial; that\r\nis to say, a knowledge of the most proper, most effective, or most\r\nacceptable manner of approaching and of serving the preternatural\r\nagents. What was learned was how to make oneself indispensable to these\r\npowers, and so to put oneself in a position to ask, or even to require,\r\ntheir intercession in the course of events or their abstention from\r\ninterference in any given enterprise. Propitiation was the end, and this\r\nend was sought, in great part, by acquiring facility in subservience.\r\nIt appears to have been only gradually that other elements than those\r\nof efficient service of the master found their way into the stock of\r\npriestly or shamanistic instruction.\r\n\r\nThe priestly servitor of the inscrutable powers that move in the\r\nexternal world came to stand in the position of a mediator between these\r\npowers and the common run of unrestricted humanity; for he was possessed\r\nof a knowledge of the supernatural etiquette which would admit him into\r\nthe presence. And as commonly happens with mediators between the vulgar\r\nand their masters, whether the masters be natural or preternatural, he\r\nfound it expedient to have the means at hand tangibly to impress upon\r\nthe vulgar the fact that these inscrutable powers would do what he might\r\nask of them. Hence, presently, a knowledge of certain natural processes\r\nwhich could be turned to account for spectacular effect, together with\r\nsome sleight of hand, came to be an integral part of priestly lore.\r\nKnowledge of this kind passes for knowledge of the "unknowable", and\r\nit owes its serviceability for the sacerdotal purpose to its recondite\r\ncharacter. It appears to have been from this source that learning, as an\r\ninstitution, arose, and its differentiation from this its parent stock\r\nof magic ritual and shamanistic fraud has been slow and tedious, and is\r\nscarcely yet complete even in the most advanced of the higher seminaries\r\nof learning.\r\n\r\nThe recondite element in learning is still, as it has been in all ages,\r\na very attractive and effective element for the purpose of impressing,\r\nor even imposing upon, the unlearned; and the standing of the savant in\r\nthe mind of the altogether unlettered is in great measure rated in terms\r\nof intimacy with the occult forces. So, for instance, as a typical case,\r\neven so late as the middle of this century, the Norwegian peasants have\r\ninstinctively formulated their sense of the superior erudition of such\r\ndoctors of divinity as Luther, Malanchthon, Peder Dass, and even so late\r\na scholar in divinity as Grundtvig, in terms of the Black Art. These,\r\ntogether with a very comprehensive list of minor celebrities, both\r\nliving and dead, have been reputed masters in all magical arts; and a\r\nhigh position in the ecclesiastical personnel has carried with it,\r\nin the apprehension of these good people, an implication of profound\r\nfamiliarity with magical practice and the occult sciences. There is\r\na parallel fact nearer home, similarly going to show the close\r\nrelationship, in popular apprehension, between erudition and the\r\nunknowable; and it will at the same time serve to illustrate, in\r\nsomewhat coarse outline, the bent which leisure-class life gives to\r\nthe cognitive interest. While the belief is by no means confined to the\r\nleisure class, that class today comprises a disproportionately large\r\nnumber of believers in occult sciences of all kinds and shades. By those\r\nwhose habits of thought are not shaped by contact with modern industry,\r\nthe knowledge of the unknowable is still felt to the ultimate if not the\r\nonly true knowledge.\r\n\r\nLearning, then, set out by being in some sense a by-product of the\r\npriestly vicarious leisure class; and, at least until a recent date,\r\nthe higher learning has since remained in some sense a by-product or\r\nby-occupation of the priestly classes. As the body of systematized\r\nknowledge increased, there presently arose a distinction, traceable\r\nvery far back in the history of education, between esoteric and exoteric\r\nknowledge, the former--so far as there is a substantial difference\r\nbetween the two--comprising such knowledge as is primarily of no\r\neconomic or industrial effect, and the latter comprising chiefly\r\nknowledge of industrial processes and of natural phenomena which were\r\nhabitually turned to account for the material purposes of life.\r\nThis line of demarcation has in time become, at least in popular\r\napprehension, the normal line between the higher learning and the lower.\r\n\r\nIt is significant, not only as an evidence of their close affiliation\r\nwith the priestly craft, but also as indicating that their activity to\r\na good extent falls under that category of conspicuous leisure known\r\nas manners and breeding, that the learned class in all primitive\r\ncommunities are great sticklers for form, precedent, gradations of rank,\r\nritual, ceremonial vestments, and learned paraphernalia generally.\r\nThis is of course to be expected, and it goes to say that the higher\r\nlearning, in its incipient phase, is a leisure-class occupation--more\r\nspecifically an occupation of the vicarious leisure class employed in\r\nthe service of the supernatural leisure class. But this predilection for\r\nthe paraphernalia of learning goes also to indicate a further point of\r\ncontact or of continuity between the priestly office and the office of\r\nthe savant. In point of derivation, learning, as well as the priestly\r\noffice, is largely an outgrowth of sympathetic magic; and this magical\r\napparatus of form and ritual therefore finds its place with the learned\r\nclass of the primitive community as a matter of course. The ritual and\r\nparaphernalia have an occult efficacy for the magical purpose; so\r\nthat their presence as an integral factor in the earlier phases of the\r\ndevelopment of magic and science is a matter of expediency, quite as\r\nmuch as of affectionate regard for symbolism simply.\r\n\r\nThis sense of the efficacy of symbolic ritual, and of sympathetic effect\r\nto be wrought through dexterous rehearsal of the traditional accessories\r\nof the act or end to be compassed, is of course present more obviously\r\nand in larger measure in magical practice than in the discipline of the\r\nsciences, even of the occult sciences. But there are, I apprehend,\r\nfew persons with a cultivated sense of scholastic merit to whom the\r\nritualistic accessories of science are altogether an idle matter. The\r\nvery great tenacity with which these ritualistic paraphernalia persist\r\nthrough the later course of the development is evident to any one\r\nwho will reflect on what has been the history of learning in our\r\ncivilization. Even today there are such things in the usage of the\r\nlearned community as the cap and gown, matriculation, initiation,\r\nand graduation ceremonies, and the conferring of scholastic degrees,\r\ndignities, and prerogatives in a way which suggests some sort of a\r\nscholarly apostolic succession. The usage of the priestly orders is\r\nno doubt the proximate source of all these features of learned ritual,\r\nvestments, sacramental initiation, the transmission of peculiar\r\ndignities and virtues by the imposition of hands, and the like; but\r\ntheir derivation is traceable back of this point, to the source from\r\nwhich the specialized priestly class proper came to be distinguished\r\nfrom the sorcerer on the one hand and from the menial servant of\r\na temporal master on the other hand. So far as regards both their\r\nderivation and their psychological content, these usages and the\r\nconceptions on which they rest belong to a stage in cultural development\r\nno later than that of the angekok and the rain-maker. Their place in the\r\nlater phases of devout observance, as well as in the higher educational\r\nsystem, is that of a survival from a very early animistic phase of the\r\ndevelopment of human nature.\r\n\r\nThese ritualistic features of the educational system of the present and\r\nof the recent past, it is quite safe to say, have their place primarily\r\nin the higher, liberal, and classic institutions and grades of learning,\r\nrather than in the lower, technological, or practical grades, and\r\nbranches of the system. So far as they possess them, the lower and less\r\nreputable branches of the educational scheme have evidently borrowed\r\nthese things from the higher grades; and their continued persistence\r\namong the practical schools, without the sanction of the continued\r\nexample of the higher and classic grades, would be highly improbable,\r\nto say the least. With the lower and practical schools and scholars, the\r\nadoption and cultivation of these usages is a case of mimicry--due to\r\na desire to conform as far as may be to the standards of scholastic\r\nreputability maintained by the upper grades and classes, who have\r\ncome by these accessory features legitimately, by the right of lineal\r\ndevolution.\r\n\r\nThe analysis may even be safely carried a step farther. Ritualistic\r\nsurvivals and reversions come out in fullest vigor and with the freest\r\nair of spontaneity among those seminaries of learning which have to\r\ndo primarily with the education of the priestly and leisure classes.\r\nAccordingly it should appear, and it does pretty plainly appear, on\r\na survey of recent developments in college and university life, that\r\nwherever schools founded for the instruction of the lower classes in the\r\nimmediately useful branches of knowledge grow into institutions of the\r\nhigher learning, the growth of ritualistic ceremonial and paraphernalia\r\nand of elaborate scholastic "functions" goes hand in hand with\r\nthe transition of the schools in question from the field of homely\r\npracticality into the higher, classical sphere. The initial purpose of\r\nthese schools, and the work with which they have chiefly had to do at\r\nthe earlier of these two stages of their evolution, has been that of\r\nfitting the young of the industrious classes for work. On the higher,\r\nclassical plane of learning to which they commonly tend, their dominant\r\naim becomes the preparation of the youth of the priestly and the leisure\r\nclasses--or of an incipient leisure class--for the consumption of\r\ngoods, material and immaterial, according to a conventionally accepted,\r\nreputable scope and method. This happy issue has commonly been the fate\r\nof schools founded by "friends of the people" for the aid of struggling\r\nyoung men, and where this transition is made in good form there is\r\ncommonly, if not invariably, a coincident change to a more ritualistic\r\nlife in the schools.\r\n\r\nIn the school life of today, learned ritual is in a general way best at\r\nhome in schools whose chief end is the cultivation of the "humanities".\r\nThis correlation is shown, perhaps more neatly than anywhere else, in\r\nthe life-history of the American colleges and universities of recent\r\ngrowth. There may be many exceptions from the rule, especially among\r\nthose schools which have been founded by the typically reputable and\r\nritualistic churches, and which, therefore, started on the conservative\r\nand classical plane or reached the classical position by a short-cut;\r\nbut the general rule as regards the colleges founded in the newer\r\nAmerican communities during the present century has been that so long\r\nas the constituency from which the colleges have drawn their pupils\r\nhas been dominated by habits of industry and thrift, so long the\r\nreminiscences of the medicine-man have found but a scant and precarious\r\nacceptance in the scheme of college life. But so soon as wealth begins\r\nappreciably to accumulate in the community, and so soon as a given\r\nschool begins to lean on a leisure-class constituency, there comes\r\nalso a perceptibly increased insistence on scholastic ritual and on\r\nconformity to the ancient forms as regards vestments and social and\r\nscholastic solemnities. So, for instance, there has been an approximate\r\ncoincidence between the growth of wealth among the constituency\r\nwhich supports any given college of the Middle West and the date of\r\nacceptance--first into tolerance and then into imperative vogue--of\r\nevening dress for men and of the d\xe9collet\xe9 for women, as the scholarly\r\nvestments proper to occasions of learned solemnity or to the seasons\r\nof social amenity within the college circle. Apart from the mechanical\r\ndifficulty of so large a task, it would scarcely be a difficult matter\r\nto trace this correlation. The like is true of the vogue of the cap and\r\ngown.\r\n\r\nCap and gown have been adopted as learned insignia by many colleges of\r\nthis section within the last few years; and it is safe to say that this\r\ncould scarcely have occurred at a much earlier date, or until there had\r\ngrown up a leisure-class sentiment of sufficient volume in the community\r\nto support a strong movement of reversion towards an archaic view as to\r\nthe legitimate end of education. This particular item of learned ritual,\r\nit may be noted, would not only commend itself to the leisure-class\r\nsense of the fitness of things, as appealing to the archaic propensity\r\nfor spectacular effect and the predilection for antique symbolism;\r\nbut it at the same time fits into the leisure-class scheme of life as\r\ninvolving a notable element of conspicuous waste. The precise date at\r\nwhich the reversion to cap and gown took place, as well as the fact that\r\nit affected so large a number of schools at about the same time,\r\nseems to have been due in some measure to a wave of atavistic sense\r\nof conformity and reputability that passed over the community at that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIt may not be entirely beside the point to note that in point of time\r\nthis curious reversion seems to coincide with the culmination of a\r\ncertain vogue of atavistic sentiment and tradition in other directions\r\nalso. The wave of reversion seems to have received its initial impulse\r\nin the psychologically disintegrating effects of the Civil War.\r\nHabituation to war entails a body of predatory habits of thought,\r\nwhereby clannishness in some measure replaces the sense of solidarity,\r\nand a sense of invidious distinction supplants the impulse to equitable,\r\neveryday serviceability. As an outcome of the cumulative action of these\r\nfactors, the generation which follows a season of war is apt to witness\r\na rehabilitation of the element of status, both in its social life and\r\nin its scheme of devout observances and other symbolic or ceremonial\r\nforms. Throughout the eighties, and less plainly traceable through the\r\nseventies also, there was perceptible a gradually advancing wave of\r\nsentiment favoring quasi-predatory business habits, insistence on\r\nstatus, anthropomorphism, and conservatism generally. The more direct\r\nand unmediated of these expressions of the barbarian temperament, such\r\nas the recrudescence of outlawry and the spectacular quasi-predatory\r\ncareers of fraud run by certain "captains of industry", came to a\r\nhead earlier and were appreciably on the decline by the close of the\r\nseventies. The recrudescence of anthropomorphic sentiment also seems to\r\nhave passed its most acute stage before the close of the eighties. But\r\nthe learned ritual and paraphernalia here spoken of are a still remoter\r\nand more recondite expression of the barbarian animistic sense; and\r\nthese, therefore, gained vogue and elaboration more slowly and reached\r\ntheir most effective development at a still later date. There is reason\r\nto believe that the culmination is now already past. Except for the new\r\nimpetus given by a new war experience, and except for the support which\r\nthe growth of a wealthy class affords to all ritual, and especially to\r\nwhatever ceremonial is wasteful and pointedly suggests gradations of\r\nstatus, it is probable that the late improvements and augmentation of\r\nscholastic insignia and ceremonial would gradually decline. But while it\r\nmay be true that the cap and gown, and the more strenuous observance\r\nof scholastic proprieties which came with them, were floated in on this\r\npost-bellum tidal wave of reversion to barbarism, it is also no doubt\r\ntrue that such a ritualistic reversion could not have been effected in\r\nthe college scheme of life until the accumulation of wealth in the\r\nhands of a propertied class had gone far enough to afford the requisite\r\npecuniary ground for a movement which should bring the colleges of the\r\ncountry up to the leisure-class requirements in the higher learning. The\r\nadoption of the cap and gown is one of the striking atavistic features\r\nof modern college life, and at the same time it marks the fact that\r\nthese colleges have definitely become leisure-class establishments,\r\neither in actual achievement or in aspiration.\r\n\r\nAs further evidence of the close relation between the educational system\r\nand the cultural standards of the community, it may be remarked that\r\nthere is some tendency latterly to substitute the captain of industry in\r\nplace of the priest, as the head of seminaries of the higher learning.\r\nThe substitution is by no means complete or unequivocal. Those heads of\r\ninstitutions are best accepted who combine the sacerdotal office with\r\na high degree of pecuniary efficiency. There is a similar but less\r\npronounced tendency to intrust the work of instruction in the higher\r\nlearning to men of some pecuniary qualification. Administrative ability\r\nand skill in advertising the enterprise count for rather more than\r\nthey once did, as qualifications for the work of teaching. This applies\r\nespecially in those sciences that have most to do with the everyday\r\nfacts of life, and it is particularly true of schools in the\r\neconomically single-minded communities. This partial substitution of\r\npecuniary for sacerdotal efficiency is a concomitant of the modern\r\ntransition from conspicuous leisure to conspicuous consumption, as\r\nthe chief means of reputability. The correlation of the two facts is\r\nprobably clear without further elaboration.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the schools and of the learned class towards the\r\neducation of women serves to show in what manner and to what extent\r\nlearning has departed from its ancient station of priestly and\r\nleisure-class prerogatives, and it indicates also what approach has\r\nbeen made by the truly learned to the modern, economic or industrial,\r\nmatter-of-fact standpoint. The higher schools and the learned\r\nprofessions were until recently tabu to the women. These establishments\r\nwere from the outset, and have in great measure continued to be, devoted\r\nto the education of the priestly and leisure classes.\r\n\r\nThe women, as has been shown elsewhere, were the original subservient\r\nclass, and to some extent, especially so far as regards their nominal\r\nor ceremonial position, they have remained in that relation down to the\r\npresent. There has prevailed a strong sense that the admission of\r\nwomen to the privileges of the higher learning (as to the Eleusianin\r\nmysteries) would be derogatory to the dignity of the learned craft. It\r\nis therefore only very recently, and almost solely in the industrially\r\nmost advanced communities, that the higher grades of schools have\r\nbeen freely opened to women. And even under the urgent circumstances\r\nprevailing in the modern industrial communities, the highest and most\r\nreputable universities show an extreme reluctance in making the move.\r\nThe sense of class worthiness, that is to say of status, of a honorific\r\ndifferentiation of the sexes according to a distinction between superior\r\nand inferior intellectual dignity, survives in a vigorous form in these\r\ncorporations of the aristocracy of learning. It is felt that the woman\r\nshould, in all propriety, acquire only such knowledge as may be classed\r\nunder one or the other of two heads: (1) such knowledge as conduces\r\nimmediately to a better performance of domestic service--the domestic\r\nsphere; (2) such accomplishments and dexterity, quasi-scholarly and\r\nquasi-artistic, as plainly come in under the head of a performance of\r\nvicarious leisure. Knowledge is felt to be unfeminine if it is knowledge\r\nwhich expresses the unfolding of the learner\'s own life, the acquisition\r\nof which proceeds on the learner\'s own cognitive interest, without\r\nprompting from the canons of propriety, and without reference back to a\r\nmaster whose comfort or good repute is to be enhanced by the employment\r\nor the exhibition of it. So, also, all knowledge which is useful as\r\nevidence of leisure, other than vicarious leisure, is scarcely feminine.\r\n\r\nFor an appreciation of the relation which these higher seminaries of\r\nlearning bear to the economic life of the community, the phenomena which\r\nhave been reviewed are of importance rather as indications of a general\r\nattitude than as being in themselves facts of first-rate economic\r\nconsequence. They go to show what is the instinctive attitude and\r\nanimus of the learned class towards the life process of an industrial\r\ncommunity. They serve as an exponent of the stage of development, for\r\nthe industrial purpose, attained by the higher learning and by the\r\nlearned class, and so they afford an indication as to what may fairly be\r\nlooked for from this class at points where the learning and the life of\r\nthe class bear more immediately upon the economic life and efficiency\r\nof the community, and upon the adjustment of its scheme of life to\r\nthe requirements of the time. What these ritualistic survivals go\r\nto indicate is a prevalence of conservatism, if not of reactionary\r\nsentiment, especially among the higher schools where the conventional\r\nlearning is cultivated.\r\n\r\nTo these indications of a conservative attitude is to be added another\r\ncharacteristic which goes in the same direction, but which is a symptom\r\nof graver consequence that this playful inclination to trivialities\r\nof form and ritual. By far the greater number of American colleges\r\nand universities, for instance, are affiliated to some religious\r\ndenomination and are somewhat given to devout observances. Their\r\nputative familiarity with scientific methods and the scientific point\r\nof view should presumably exempt the faculties of these schools\r\nfrom animistic habits of thought; but there is still a considerable\r\nproportion of them who profess an attachment to the anthropomorphic\r\nbeliefs and observances of an earlier culture. These professions\r\nof devotional zeal are, no doubt, to a good extent expedient and\r\nperfunctory, both on the part of the schools in their corporate\r\ncapacity, and on the part of the individual members of the corps of\r\ninstructors; but it can not be doubted that there is after all a very\r\nappreciable element of anthropomorphic sentiment present in the\r\nhigher schools. So far as this is the case it must be set down as the\r\nexpression of an archaic, animistic habit of mind. This habit of\r\nmind must necessarily assert itself to some extent in the instruction\r\noffered, and to this extent its influence in shaping the habits of\r\nthought of the student makes for conservatism and reversion; it acts\r\nto hinder his development in the direction of matter-of-fact knowledge,\r\nsuch as best serves the ends of industry.\r\n\r\nThe college sports, which have so great a vogue in the reputable\r\nseminaries of learning today, tend in a similar direction; and, indeed,\r\nsports have much in common with the devout attitude of the colleges,\r\nboth as regards their psychological basis and as regards their\r\ndisciplinary effect. But this expression of the barbarian temperament\r\nis to be credited primarily to the body of students, rather than to the\r\ntemper of the schools as such; except in so far as the colleges or the\r\ncollege officials--as sometimes happens--actively countenance and foster\r\nthe growth of sports. The like is true of college fraternities as\r\nof college sports, but with a difference. The latter are chiefly\r\nan expression of the predatory impulse simply; the former are more\r\nspecifically an expression of that heritage of clannishness which is\r\nso large a feature in the temperament of the predatory barbarian. It is\r\nalso noticeable that a close relation subsists between the fraternities\r\nand the sporting activity of the schools. After what has already been\r\nsaid in an earlier chapter on the sporting and gambling habit, it\r\nis scarcely necessary further to discuss the economic value of this\r\ntraining in sports and in factional organization and activity.\r\n\r\nBut all these features of the scheme of life of the learned class,\r\nand of the establishments dedicated to the conservation of the higher\r\nlearning, are in a great measure incidental only. They are scarcely\r\nto be accounted organic elements of the professed work of research and\r\ninstruction for the ostensible pursuit of which the schools exists. But\r\nthese symptomatic indications go to establish a presumption as to the\r\ncharacter of the work performed--as seen from the economic point of\r\nview--and as to the bent which the serious work carried on under their\r\nauspices gives to the youth who resort to the schools. The presumption\r\nraised by the considerations already offered is that in their work also,\r\nas well as in their ceremonial, the higher schools may be expected to\r\ntake a conservative position; but this presumption must be checked by a\r\ncomparison of the economic character of the work actually performed, and\r\nby something of a survey of the learning whose conservation is\r\nintrusted to the higher schools. On this head, it is well known that\r\nthe accredited seminaries of learning have, until a recent date, held\r\na conservative position. They have taken an attitude of depreciation\r\ntowards all innovations. As a general rule a new point of view or a new\r\nformulation of knowledge have been countenanced and taken up within the\r\nschools only after these new things have made their way outside of\r\nthe schools. As exceptions from this rule are chiefly to be mentioned\r\ninnovations of an inconspicuous kind and departures which do not bear\r\nin any tangible way upon the conventional point of view or upon the\r\nconventional scheme of life; as, for instance, details of fact in the\r\nmathematico-physical sciences, and new readings and interpretations of\r\nthe classics, especially such as have a philological or literary bearing\r\nonly. Except within the domain of the "humanities", in the narrow sense,\r\nand except so far as the traditional point of view of the humanities has\r\nbeen left intact by the innovators, it has generally held true that the\r\naccredited learned class and the seminaries of the higher learning\r\nhave looked askance at all innovation. New views, new departures in\r\nscientific theory, especially in new departures which touch the theory\r\nof human relations at any point, have found a place in the scheme of\r\nthe university tardily and by a reluctant tolerance, rather than by\r\na cordial welcome; and the men who have occupied themselves with such\r\nefforts to widen the scope of human knowledge have not commonly been\r\nwell received by their learned contemporaries. The higher schools have\r\nnot commonly given their countenance to a serious advance in the methods\r\nor the content of knowledge until the innovations have outlived their\r\nyouth and much of their usefulness--after they have become commonplaces\r\nof the intellectual furniture of a new generation which has grown\r\nup under, and has had its habits of thought shaped by, the new,\r\nextra-scholastic body of knowledge and the new standpoint. This is true\r\nof the recent past. How far it may be true of the immediate present it\r\nwould be hazardous to say, for it is impossible to see present-day\r\nfacts in such perspective as to get a fair conception of their relative\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nSo far, nothing has been said of the Maecenas function of the\r\nwell-to-do, which is habitually dwelt on at some length by writers\r\nand speakers who treat of the development of culture and of social\r\nstructure. This leisure-class function is not without an important\r\nbearing on the higher and on the spread of knowledge and culture. The\r\nmanner and the degree in which the class furthers learning through\r\npatronage of this kind is sufficiently familiar. It has been frequently\r\npresented in affectionate and effective terms by spokesmen whose\r\nfamiliarity with the topic fits them to bring home to their hearers the\r\nprofound significance of this cultural factor. These spokesmen, however,\r\nhave presented the matter from the point of view of the cultural\r\ninterest, or of the interest of reputability, rather than from that of\r\nthe economic interest. As apprehended from the economic point of view,\r\nand valued for the purpose of industrial serviceability, this function\r\nof the well-to-do, as well as the intellectual attitude of members of\r\nthe well-to-do class, merits some attention and will bear illustration.\r\n\r\nBy way of characterization of the Maecenas relation, it is to be noted\r\nthat, considered externally, as an economic or industrial relation\r\nsimply, it is a relation of status. The scholar under the patronage\r\nperforms the duties of a learned life vicariously for his patron, to\r\nwhom a certain repute inures after the manner of the good repute imputed\r\nto a master for whom any form of vicarious leisure is performed. It is\r\nalso to be noted that, in point of historical fact, the furtherance of\r\nlearning or the maintenance of scholarly activity through the Maecenas\r\nrelation has most commonly been a furtherance of proficiency in\r\nclassical lore or in the humanities. The knowledge tends to lower rather\r\nthan to heighten the industrial efficiency of the community.\r\n\r\nFurther, as regards the direct participation of the members of the\r\nleisure class in the furtherance of knowledge, the canons of reputable\r\nliving act to throw such intellectual interest as seeks expression among\r\nthe class on the side of classical and formal erudition, rather than\r\non the side of the sciences that bear some relation to the community\'s\r\nindustrial life. The most frequent excursions into other than classical\r\nfields of knowledge on the part of members of the leisure class are made\r\ninto the discipline of law and the political, and more especially the\r\nadministrative, sciences. These so-called sciences are substantially\r\nbodies of maxims of expediency for guidance in the leisure-class office\r\nof government, as conducted on a proprietary basis. The interest with\r\nwhich this discipline is approached is therefore not commonly the\r\nintellectual or cognitive interest simply. It is largely the practical\r\ninterest of the exigencies of that relation of mastery in which the\r\nmembers of the class are placed. In point of derivation, the office of\r\ngovernment is a predatory function, pertaining integrally to the archaic\r\nleisure-class scheme of life. It is an exercise of control and coercion\r\nover the population from which the class draws its sustenance. This\r\ndiscipline, as well as the incidents of practice which give it its\r\ncontent, therefore has some attraction for the class apart from all\r\nquestions of cognition. All this holds true wherever and so long as\r\nthe governmental office continues, in form or in substance, to be a\r\nproprietary office; and it holds true beyond that limit, in so far as\r\nthe tradition of the more archaic phase of governmental evolution has\r\nlasted on into the later life of those modern communities for whom\r\nproprietary government by a leisure class is now beginning to pass away.\r\n\r\nFor that field of learning within which the cognitive or intellectual\r\ninterest is dominant--the sciences properly so called--the case is\r\nsomewhat different, not only as regards the attitude of the leisure\r\nclass, but as regards the whole drift of the pecuniary culture.\r\nKnowledge for its own sake, the exercise of the faculty of comprehensive\r\nwithout ulterior purpose, should, it might be expected, be sought by\r\nmen whom no urgent material interest diverts from such a quest. The\r\nsheltered industrial position of the leisure class should give free\r\nplay to the cognitive interest in members of this class, and we should\r\nconsequently have, as many writers confidently find that we do have, a\r\nvery large proportion of scholars, scientists, savants derived from\r\nthis class and deriving their incentive to scientific investigation and\r\nspeculation from the discipline of a life of leisure. Some such result\r\nis to be looked for, but there are features of the leisure-class\r\nscheme of life, already sufficiently dwelt upon, which go to divert the\r\nintellectual interest of this class to other subjects than that causal\r\nsequence in phenomena which makes the content of the sciences. The\r\nhabits of thought which characterize the life of the class run on\r\nthe personal relation of dominance, and on the derivative, invidious\r\nconcepts of honor, worth, merit, character, and the like. The casual\r\nsequence which makes up the subject matter of science is not visible\r\nfrom this point of view. Neither does good repute attach to knowledge of\r\nfacts that are vulgarly useful. Hence it should appear probable that the\r\ninterest of the invidious comparison with respect to pecuniary or other\r\nhonorific merit should occupy the attention of the leisure class, to the\r\nneglect of the cognitive interest. Where this latter interest asserts\r\nitself it should commonly be diverted to fields of speculation or\r\ninvestigation which are reputable and futile, rather than to the quest\r\nof scientific knowledge. Such indeed has been the history of priestly\r\nand leisure-class learning so long as no considerable body of\r\nsystematized knowledge had been intruded into the scholastic discipline\r\nfrom an extra-scholastic source. But since the relation of mastery and\r\nsubservience is ceasing to be the dominant and formative factor in the\r\ncommunity\'s life process, other features of the life process and other\r\npoints of view are forcing themselves upon the scholars. The true-bred\r\ngentleman of leisure should, and does, see the world from the point of\r\nview of the personal relation; and the cognitive interest, so far as\r\nit asserts itself in him, should seek to systematize phenomena on this\r\nbasis. Such indeed is the case with the gentleman of the old school, in\r\nwhom the leisure-class ideals have suffered no disintegration; and such\r\nis the attitude of his latter-day descendant, in so far as he has fallen\r\nheir to the full complement of upper-class virtues. But the ways of\r\nheredity are devious, and not every gentleman\'s son is to the manor\r\nborn. Especially is the transmission of the habits of thought which\r\ncharacterize the predatory master somewhat precarious in the case of a\r\nline of descent in which but one or two of the latest steps have lain\r\nwithin the leisure-class discipline. The chances of occurrence of a\r\nstrong congenital or acquired bent towards the exercise of the cognitive\r\naptitudes are apparently best in those members of the leisure class who\r\nare of lower class or middle class antecedents--that is to say, those\r\nwho have inherited the complement of aptitudes proper to the industrious\r\nclasses, and who owe their place in the leisure class to the possession\r\nof qualities which count for more today than they did in the times when\r\nthe leisure-class scheme of life took shape. But even outside the range\r\nof these later accessions to the leisure class there are an appreciable\r\nnumber of individuals in whom the invidious interest is not sufficiently\r\ndominant to shape their theoretical views, and in whom the proclivity to\r\ntheory is sufficiently strong to lead them into the scientific quest.\r\n\r\nThe higher learning owes the intrusion of the sciences in part to these\r\naberrant scions of the leisure class, who have come under the dominant\r\ninfluence of the latter-day tradition of impersonal relation and who\r\nhave inherited a complement of human aptitudes differing in certain\r\nsalient features from the temperament which is characteristic of\r\nthe regime of status. But it owes the presence of this alien body of\r\nscientific knowledge also in part, and in a higher degree, to members of\r\nthe industrious classes who have been in sufficiently easy circumstances\r\nto turn their attention to other interests than that of finding daily\r\nsustenance, and whose inherited aptitudes and anthropomorphic point of\r\nview does not dominate their intellectual processes. As between\r\nthese two groups, which approximately comprise the effective force of\r\nscientific progress, it is the latter that has contributed the most. And\r\nwith respect to both it seems to be true that they are not so much\r\nthe source as the vehicle, or at the most they are the instrument of\r\ncommutation, by which the habits of thought enforced upon the community,\r\nthrough contact with its environment under the exigencies of modern\r\nassociated life and the mechanical industries, are turned to account for\r\ntheoretical knowledge.\r\n\r\nScience, in the sense of an articulate recognition of causal sequence in\r\nphenomena, whether physical or social, has been a feature of the Western\r\nculture only since the industrial process in the Western communities has\r\ncome to be substantially a process of mechanical contrivances in which\r\nman\'s office is that of discrimination and valuation of material forces.\r\nScience has flourished somewhat in the same degree as the industrial\r\nlife of the community has conformed to this pattern, and somewhat in\r\nthe same degree as the industrial interest has dominated the community\'s\r\nlife. And science, and scientific theory especially, has made headway\r\nin the several departments of human life and knowledge in proportion\r\nas each of these several departments has successively come into closer\r\ncontact with the industrial process and the economic interest;\r\nor perhaps it is truer to say, in proportion as each of them has\r\nsuccessively escaped from the dominance of the conceptions of personal\r\nrelation or status, and of the derivative canons of anthropomorphic\r\nfitness and honorific worth.\r\n\r\nIt is only as the exigencies of modern industrial life have enforced the\r\nrecognition of causal sequence in the practical contact of mankind with\r\ntheir environment, that men have come to systematize the phenomena of\r\nthis environment and the facts of their own contact with it in terms\r\nof causal sequence. So that while the higher learning in its best\r\ndevelopment, as the perfect flower of scholasticism and classicism, was\r\na by-product of the priestly office and the life of leisure, so modern\r\nscience may be said to be a by-product of the industrial process.\r\nThrough these groups of men, then--investigators, savants, scientists,\r\ninventors, speculators--most of whom have done their most telling work\r\noutside the shelter of the schools, the habits of thought enforced\r\nby the modern industrial life have found coherent expression and\r\nelaboration as a body of theoretical science having to do with the\r\ncausal sequence of phenomena. And from this extra-scholastic field of\r\nscientific speculation, changes of method and purpose have from time to\r\ntime been intruded into the scholastic discipline.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is to be remarked that there is a very perceptible\r\ndifference of substance and purpose between the instruction offered in\r\nthe primary and secondary schools, on the one hand, and in the higher\r\nseminaries of learning, on the other hand. The difference in point\r\nof immediate practicality of the information imparted and of the\r\nproficiency acquired may be of some consequence and may merit the\r\nattention which it has from time to time received; but there is more\r\nsubstantial difference in the mental and spiritual bent which is favored\r\nby the one and the other discipline. This divergent trend in discipline\r\nbetween the higher and the lower learning is especially noticeable as\r\nregards the primary education in its latest development in the advanced\r\nindustrial communities. Here the instruction is directed chiefly to\r\nproficiency or dexterity, intellectual and manual, in the apprehension\r\nand employment of impersonal facts, in their casual rather than in their\r\nhonorific incidence. It is true, under the traditions of the earlier\r\ndays, when the primary education was also predominantly a leisure-class\r\ncommodity, a free use is still made of emulation as a spur to diligence\r\nin the common run of primary schools; but even this use of emulation as\r\nan expedient is visibly declining in the primary grades of instruction\r\nin communities where the lower education is not under the guidance\r\nof the ecclesiastical or military tradition. All this holds true in\r\na peculiar degree, and more especially on the spiritual side, of such\r\nportions of the educational system as have been immediately affected by\r\nkindergarten methods and ideals.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarly non-invidious trend of the kindergarten discipline, and\r\nthe similar character of the kindergarten influence in primary education\r\nbeyond the limits of the kindergarten proper, should be taken in\r\nconnection with what has already been said of the peculiar spiritual\r\nattitude of leisure-class womankind under the circumstances of the\r\nmodern economic situation. The kindergarten discipline is at its\r\nbest--or at its farthest remove from ancient patriarchal and pedagogical\r\nideals--in the advanced industrial communities, where there is a\r\nconsiderable body of intelligent and idle women, and where the system of\r\nstatus has somewhat abated in rigor under the disintegrating influence\r\nof industrial life and in the absence of a consistent body of\r\nmilitary and ecclesiastical traditions. It is from these women in easy\r\ncircumstances that it gets its moral support. The aims and methods of\r\nthe kindergarten commend themselves with especial effect to this class\r\nof women who are ill at ease under the pecuniary code of reputable life.\r\nThe kindergarten, and whatever the kindergarten spirit counts for\r\nin modern education, therefore, is to be set down, along with the\r\n"new-woman movement," to the account of that revulsion against futility\r\nand invidious comparison which the leisure-class life under modern\r\ncircumstances induces in the women most immediately exposed to its\r\ndiscipline. In this way it appears that, by indirection, the institution\r\nof a leisure class here again favors the growth of a non-invidious\r\nattitude, which may, in the long run, prove a menace to the stability\r\nof the institution itself, and even to the institution of individual\r\nownership on which it rests.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent past some tangible changes have taken place in the\r\nscope of college and university teaching. These changes have in the main\r\nconsisted in a partial displacement of the humanities--those branches\r\nof learning which are conceived to make for the traditional "culture",\r\ncharacter, tastes, and ideals--by those more matter-of-fact branches\r\nwhich make for civic and industrial efficiency. To put the same thing\r\nin other words, those branches of knowledge which make for efficiency\r\n(ultimately productive efficiency) have gradually been gaining ground\r\nagainst those branches which make for a heightened consumption or a\r\nlowered industrial efficiency and for a type of character suited to the\r\nregime of status. In this adaptation of the scheme of instruction the\r\nhigher schools have commonly been found on the conservative side; each\r\nstep which they have taken in advance has been to some extent of\r\nthe nature of a concession. The sciences have been intruded into\r\nthe scholar\'s discipline from without, not to say from below. It is\r\nnoticeable that the humanities which have so reluctantly yielded ground\r\nto the sciences are pretty uniformly adapted to shape the character\r\nof the student in accordance with a traditional self-centred scheme of\r\nconsumption; a scheme of contemplation and enjoyment of the true,\r\nthe beautiful, and the good, according to a conventional standard of\r\npropriety and excellence, the salient feature of which is leisure--otium\r\ncum dignitate. In language veiled by their own habituation to the\r\narchaic, decorous point of view, the spokesmen of the humanities have\r\ninsisted upon the ideal embodied in the maxim, fruges consumere nati.\r\nThis attitude should occasion no surprise in the case of schools which\r\nare shaped by and rest upon a leisure-class culture.\r\n\r\nThe professed grounds on which it has been sought, as far as might be,\r\nto maintain the received standards and methods of culture intact\r\nare likewise characteristic of the archaic temperament and of the\r\nleisure-class theory of life. The enjoyment and the bent derived from\r\nhabitual contemplation of the life, ideals, speculations, and methods of\r\nconsuming time and goods, in vogue among the leisure class of classical\r\nantiquity, for instance, is felt to be "higher", "nobler", "worthier",\r\nthan what results in these respects from a like familiarity with the\r\neveryday life and the knowledge and aspirations of commonplace humanity\r\nin a modern community, that learning the content of which is an\r\nunmitigated knowledge of latter-day men and things is by comparison\r\n"lower", "base", "ignoble"--one even hears the epithet "sub-human"\r\napplied to this matter-of-fact knowledge of mankind and of everyday\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThis contention of the leisure-class spokesmen of the humanities\r\nseems to be substantially sound. In point of substantial fact, the\r\ngratification and the culture, or the spiritual attitude or habit of\r\nmind, resulting from an habitual contemplation of the anthropomorphism,\r\nclannishness, and leisurely self-complacency of the gentleman of an\r\nearly day, or from a familiarity with the animistic superstitions\r\nand the exuberant truculence of the Homeric heroes, for instance, is,\r\naesthetically considered, more legitimate than the corresponding results\r\nderived from a matter-of-fact knowledge of things and a contemplation\r\nof latter-day civic or workmanlike efficiency. There can be but little\r\nquestion that the first-named habits have the advantage in respect of\r\naesthetic or honorific value, and therefore in respect of the "worth"\r\nwhich is made the basis of award in the comparison. The content of the\r\ncanons of taste, and more particularly of the canons of honor, is in the\r\nnature of things a resultant of the past life and circumstances of\r\nthe race, transmitted to the later generation by inheritance or by\r\ntradition; and the fact that the protracted dominance of a predatory,\r\nleisure-class scheme of life has profoundly shaped the habit of mind and\r\nthe point of view of the race in the past, is a sufficient basis for an\r\naesthetically legitimate dominance of such a scheme of life in very much\r\nof what concerns matters of taste in the present. For the purpose in\r\nhand, canons of taste are race habits, acquired through a more or less\r\nprotracted habituation to the approval or disapproval of the kind\r\nof things upon which a favorable or unfavorable judgment of taste is\r\npassed. Other things being equal, the longer and more unbroken the\r\nhabituation, the more legitimate is the canon of taste in question. All\r\nthis seems to be even truer of judgments regarding worth or honor than\r\nof judgments of taste generally.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be the aesthetic legitimacy of the derogatory judgment\r\npassed on the newer learning by the spokesmen of the humanities, and\r\nhowever substantial may be the merits of the contention that the\r\nclassic lore is worthier and results in a more truly human culture and\r\ncharacter, it does not concern the question in hand. The question in\r\nhand is as to how far these branches of learning, and the point of\r\nview for which they stand in the educational system, help or hinder an\r\nefficient collective life under modern industrial circumstances--how\r\nfar they further a more facile adaptation to the economic situation\r\nof today. The question is an economic, not an aesthetic one; and\r\nthe leisure-class standards of learning which find expression in the\r\ndeprecatory attitude of the higher schools towards matter-of-fact\r\nknowledge are, for the present purpose, to be valued from this point of\r\nview only. For this purpose the use of such epithets as "noble", "base",\r\n"higher", "lower", etc., is significant only as showing the animus\r\nand the point of view of the disputants; whether they contend for the\r\nworthiness of the new or of the old. All these epithets are honorific or\r\nhumilific terms; that is to say, they are terms of invidious comparison,\r\nwhich in the last analysis fall under the category of the reputable or\r\nthe disreputable; that is, they belong within the range of ideas that\r\ncharacterizes the scheme of life of the regime of status; that is, they\r\nare in substance an expression of sportsmanship--of the predatory and\r\nanimistic habit of mind; that is, they indicate an archaic point of view\r\nand theory of life, which may fit the predatory stage of culture and of\r\neconomic organization from which they have sprung, but which are,\r\nfrom the point of view of economic efficiency in the broader sense,\r\ndisserviceable anachronisms.\r\n\r\nThe classics, and their position of prerogative in the scheme of\r\neducation to which the higher seminaries of learning cling with such a\r\nfond predilection, serve to shape the intellectual attitude and lower\r\nthe economic efficiency of the new learned generation. They do this\r\nnot only by holding up an archaic ideal of manhood, but also by the\r\ndiscrimination which they inculcate with respect to the reputable and\r\nthe disreputable in knowledge. This result is accomplished in two ways:\r\n(1) by inspiring an habitual aversion to what is merely useful, as\r\ncontrasted with what is merely honorific in learning, and so shaping the\r\ntastes of the novice that he comes in good faith to find gratification\r\nof his tastes solely, or almost solely, in such exercise of the\r\nintellect as normally results in no industrial or social gain; and (2)\r\nby consuming the learner\'s time and effort in acquiring knowledge which\r\nis of no use except in so far as this learning has by convention become\r\nincorporated into the sum of learning required of the scholar, and has\r\nthereby affected the terminology and diction employed in the useful\r\nbranches of knowledge. Except for this terminological difficulty--which\r\nis itself a consequence of the vogue of the classics of the past--a\r\nknowledge of the ancient languages, for instance, would have no\r\npractical bearing for any scientist or any scholar not engaged on work\r\nprimarily of a linguistic character. Of course, all this has nothing to\r\nsay as to the cultural value of the classics, nor is there any intention\r\nto disparage the discipline of the classics or the bent which their\r\nstudy gives to the student. That bent seems to be of an economically\r\ndisserviceable kind, but this fact--somewhat notorious indeed--need\r\ndisturb no one who has the good fortune to find comfort and strength in\r\nthe classical lore. The fact that classical learning acts to derange\r\nthe learner\'s workmanlike attitudes should fall lightly upon the\r\napprehension of those who hold workmanship of small account in\r\ncomparison with the cultivation of decorous ideals: Iam fides et pax et\r\nhonos pudorque Priscus et neglecta redire virtus Audet.\r\n\r\nOwing to the circumstance that this knowledge has become part of the\r\nelementary requirements in our system of education, the ability to use\r\nand to understand certain of the dead languages of southern Europe\r\nis not only gratifying to the person who finds occasion to parade his\r\naccomplishments in this respect, but the evidence of such knowledge\r\nserves at the same time to recommend any savant to his audience, both\r\nlay and learned. It is currently expected that a certain number of\r\nyears shall have been spent in acquiring this substantially useless\r\ninformation, and its absence creates a presumption of hasty and\r\nprecarious learning, as well as of a vulgar practicality that is\r\nequally obnoxious to the conventional standards of sound scholarship and\r\nintellectual force.\r\n\r\nThe case is analogous to what happens in the purchase of any article of\r\nconsumption by a purchaser who is not an expert judge of materials or\r\nof workmanship. He makes his estimate of value of the article chiefly\r\non the ground of the apparent expensiveness of the finish of those\r\ndecorative parts and features which have no immediate relation to the\r\nintrinsic usefulness of the article; the presumption being that some\r\nsort of ill-defined proportion subsists between the substantial value of\r\nan article and the expense of adornment added in order to sell it. The\r\npresumption that there can ordinarily be no sound scholarship where\r\na knowledge of the classics and humanities is wanting leads to a\r\nconspicuous waste of time and labor on the part of the general body of\r\nstudents in acquiring such knowledge. The conventional insistence on a\r\nmodicum of conspicuous waste as an incident of all reputable scholarship\r\nhas affected our canons of taste and of serviceability in matters of\r\nscholarship in much the same way as the same principle has influenced\r\nour judgment of the serviceability of manufactured goods.\r\n\r\nIt is true, since conspicuous consumption has gained more and more on\r\nconspicuous leisure as a means of repute, the acquisition of the dead\r\nlanguages is no longer so imperative a requirement as it once was,\r\nand its talismanic virtue as a voucher of scholarship has suffered a\r\nconcomitant impairment. But while this is true, it is also true that the\r\nclassics have scarcely lost in absolute value as a voucher of scholastic\r\nrespectability, since for this purpose it is only necessary that\r\nthe scholar should be able to put in evidence some learning which is\r\nconventionally recognized as evidence of wasted time; and the classics\r\nlend themselves with great facility to this use. Indeed, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that it is their utility as evidence of wasted time and\r\neffort, and hence of the pecuniary strength necessary in order to\r\nafford this waste, that has secured to the classics their position of\r\nprerogative in the scheme of higher learning, and has led to their being\r\nesteemed the most honorific of all learning. They serve the decorative\r\nends of leisure-class learning better than any other body of knowledge,\r\nand hence they are an effective means of reputability.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the classics have until lately had scarcely a rival.\r\nThey still have no dangerous rival on the continent of Europe, but\r\nlately, since college athletics have won their way into a recognized\r\nstanding as an accredited field of scholarly accomplishment, this latter\r\nbranch of learning--if athletics may be freely classed as learning--has\r\nbecome a rival of the classics for the primacy in leisure-class\r\neducation in American and English schools. Athletics have an obvious\r\nadvantage over the classics for the purpose of leisure-class learning,\r\nsince success as an athlete presumes, not only waste of time, but also\r\nwaste of money, as well as the possession of certain highly unindustrial\r\narchaic traits of character and temperament. In the German universities\r\nthe place of athletics and Greek-letter fraternities, as a leisure-class\r\nscholarly occupation, has in some measure been supplied by a skilled and\r\ngraded inebriety and a perfunctory duelling.\r\n\r\nThe leisure class and its standard of virtue--archaism and waste--can\r\nscarcely have been concerned in the introduction of the classics into\r\nthe scheme of the higher learning; but the tenacious retention of the\r\nclassics by the higher schools, and the high degree of reputability\r\nwhich still attaches to them, are no doubt due to their conforming so\r\nclosely to the requirements of archaism and waste.\r\n\r\n"Classic" always carries this connotation of wasteful and archaic,\r\nwhether it is used to denote the dead languages or the obsolete or\r\nobsolescent forms of thought and diction in the living language, or to\r\ndenote other items of scholarly activity or apparatus to which it is\r\napplied with less aptness. So the archaic idiom of the English language\r\nis spoken of as "classic" English. Its use is imperative in all speaking\r\nand writing upon serious topics, and a facile use of it lends dignity to\r\neven the most commonplace and trivial string of talk. The newest form\r\nof English diction is of course never written; the sense of that\r\nleisure-class propriety which requires archaism in speech is present\r\neven in the most illiterate or sensational writers in sufficient\r\nforce to prevent such a lapse. On the other hand, the highest and\r\nmost conventionalized style of archaic diction is--quite\r\ncharacteristically--properly employed only in communications between an\r\nanthropomorphic divinity and his subjects. Midway between these extremes\r\nlies the everyday speech of leisure-class conversation and literature.\r\n\r\nElegant diction, whether in writing or speaking, is an effective means\r\nof reputability. It is of moment to know with some precision what is\r\nthe degree of archaism conventionally required in speaking on any given\r\ntopic. Usage differs appreciably from the pulpit to the market-place;\r\nthe latter, as might be expected, admits the use of relatively new and\r\neffective words and turns of expression, even by fastidious persons. A\r\ndiscriminative avoidance of neologisms is honorific, not only because it\r\nargues that time has been wasted in acquiring the obsolescent habit of\r\nspeech, but also as showing that the speaker has from infancy habitually\r\nassociated with persons who have been familiar with the obsolescent\r\nidiom. It thereby goes to show his leisure-class antecedents. Great\r\npurity of speech is presumptive evidence of several lives spent in other\r\nthan vulgarly useful occupations; although its evidence is by no means\r\nentirely conclusive to this point.\r\n\r\nAs felicitous an instance of futile classicism as can well be found,\r\noutside of the Far East, is the conventional spelling of the English\r\nlanguage. A breach of the proprieties in spelling is extremely annoying\r\nand will discredit any writer in the eyes of all persons who are\r\npossessed of a developed sense of the true and beautiful. English\r\northography satisfies all the requirements of the canons of reputability\r\nunder the law of conspicuous waste. It is archaic, cumbrous, and\r\nineffective; its acquisition consumes much time and effort; failure to\r\nacquire it is easy of detection. Therefore it is the first and readiest\r\ntest of reputability in learning, and conformity to its ritual is\r\nindispensable to a blameless scholastic life.\r\n\r\nOn this head of purity of speech, as at other points where a\r\nconventional usage rests on the canons of archaism and waste, the\r\nspokesmen for the usage instinctively take an apologetic attitude. It\r\nis contended, in substance, that a punctilious use of ancient and\r\naccredited locutions will serve to convey thought more adequately and\r\nmore precisely than would be the straightforward use of the latest form\r\nof spoken English; whereas it is notorious that the ideas of today are\r\neffectively expressed in the slang of today. Classic speech has the\r\nhonorific virtue of dignity; it commands attention and respect as being\r\nthe accredited method of communication under the leisure-class scheme\r\nof life, because it carries a pointed suggestion of the industrial\r\nexemption of the speaker. The advantage of the accredited locutions lies\r\nin their reputability; they are reputable because they are cumbrous and\r\nout of date, and therefore argue waste of time and exemption from the\r\nuse and the need of direct and forcible speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Theory of the Leisure Class, by\r\nThorstein Veblen\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE THEORY OF THE LEISURE CLASS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 833-8.txt or 833-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/8/3/833/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Reed\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
