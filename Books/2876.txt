We oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have it,\r\nyou know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeat me, and lock you up in your bedroom,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick answered, without\r\nhesitation. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got the cartridges?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; they\xe2\x80\x99re in my pocket, but they are joggling horribly. Do pin-fire\r\ncartridges go off of their own accord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know. Take the revolver, if you are afraid, and let me carry\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m _not_ afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d Maisie strode forward swiftly, a hand in her pocket\r\nand her chin in the air. Dick followed with a small pin-fire revolver.\r\n\r\nThe children had discovered that their lives would be unendurable\r\nwithout pistol-practice. After much forethought and self-denial, Dick\r\nhad saved seven shillings and sixpence, the price of a badly\r\nconstructed Belgian revolver. Maisie could only contribute half a crown\r\nto the syndicate for the purchase of a hundred cartridges. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\r\nsave better than I can, Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained; \xe2\x80\x9cI like nice things to\r\neat, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to you. Besides, boys ought to do these\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick grumbled a little at the arrangement, but went out and made the\r\npurchase, which the children were then on their way to test. Revolvers\r\ndid not lie in the scheme of their daily life as decreed for them by\r\nthe guardian who was incorrectly supposed to stand in the place of a\r\nmother to these two orphans. Dick had been under her care for six\r\nyears, during which time she had made her profit of the allowances\r\nsupposed to be expended on his clothes, and, partly through\r\nthoughtlessness, partly through a natural desire to pain,\xe2\x80\x94she was a\r\nwidow of some years anxious to marry again,\xe2\x80\x94had made his days\r\nburdensome on his young shoulders.\r\n\r\nWhere he had looked for love, she gave him first aversion and then\r\nhate.\r\n\r\nWhere he growing older had sought a little sympathy, she gave him\r\nridicule. The many hours that she could spare from the ordering of her\r\nsmall house she devoted to what she called the home-training of Dick\r\nHeldar. Her religion, manufactured in the main by her own intelligence\r\nand a keen study of the Scriptures, was an aid to her in this matter.\r\nAt such times as she herself was not personally displeased with Dick,\r\nshe left him to understand that he had a heavy account to settle with\r\nhis Creator; wherefore Dick learned to loathe his God as intensely as\r\nhe loathed Mrs. Jennett; and this is not a wholesome frame of mind for\r\nthe young. Since she chose to regard him as a hopeless liar, when dread\r\nof pain drove him to his first untruth, he naturally developed into a\r\nliar, but an economical and self-contained one, never throwing away the\r\nleast unnecessary fib, and never hesitating at the blackest, were it\r\nonly plausible, that might make his life a little easier. The treatment\r\ntaught him at least the power of living alone,\xe2\x80\x94a power that was of\r\nservice to him when he went to a public school and the boys laughed at\r\nhis clothes, which were poor in quality and much mended. In the\r\nholidays he returned to the teachings of Mrs. Jennett, and, that the\r\nchain of discipline might not be weakened by association with the\r\nworld, was generally beaten, on one account or another, before he had\r\nbeen twelve hours under her roof.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of one year brought him a companion in bondage, a\r\nlong-haired, gray-eyed little atom, as self-contained as himself, who\r\nmoved about the house silently and for the first few weeks spoke only\r\nto the goat that was her chiefest friend on earth and lived in the\r\nback-garden. Mrs. Jennett objected to the goat on the grounds that he\r\nwas un-Christian,\xe2\x80\x94which he certainly was. \xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the atom,\r\nchoosing her words very deliberately, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall write to my\r\nlawyer-peoples and tell them that you are a very bad woman. Amomma is\r\nmine, mine, mine!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Jennett made a movement to the hall, where\r\ncertain umbrellas and canes stood in a rack. The atom understood as\r\nclearly as Dick what this meant. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been beaten before,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nstill in the same passionless voice; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been beaten worse than you\r\ncan ever beat me. If you beat me I shall write to my lawyer-peoples and\r\ntell them that you do not give me enough to eat. I am not afraid of\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Jennett did not go into the hall, and the atom, after a\r\npause to assure herself that all danger of war was past, went out, to\r\nweep bitterly on Amomma\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\nDick learned to know her as Maisie, and at first mistrusted her\r\nprofoundly, for he feared that she might interfere with the small\r\nliberty of action left to him. She did not, however; and she\r\nvolunteered no friendliness until Dick had taken the first steps. Long\r\nbefore the holidays were over, the stress of punishment shared in\r\ncommon drove the children together, if it were only to play into each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s hands as they prepared lies for Mrs. Jennett\xe2\x80\x99s use. When Dick\r\nreturned to school, Maisie whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I shall be all alone to take\r\ncare of myself; but,\xe2\x80\x9d and she nodded her head bravely, \xe2\x80\x9cI can do it.\r\nYou promised to send Amomma a grass collar. Send it soon.\xe2\x80\x9d A week later\r\nshe asked for that collar by return of post, and was not pleased when\r\nshe learned that it took time to make. When at last Dick forwarded the\r\ngift, she forgot to thank him for it.\r\n\r\nMany holidays had come and gone since that day, and Dick had grown into\r\na lanky hobbledehoy more than ever conscious of his bad clothes. Not\r\nfor a moment had Mrs. Jennett relaxed her tender care of him, but the\r\naverage canings of a public school\xe2\x80\x94Dick fell under punishment about\r\nthree times a month\xe2\x80\x94filled him with contempt for her powers. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained to Maisie, who urged him to rebellion, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nshe is kinder to you after she has whacked me.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick shambled through\r\nthe days unkempt in body and savage in soul, as the smaller boys of the\r\nschool learned to know, for when the spirit moved him he would hit\r\nthem, cunningly and with science. The same spirit made him more than\r\nonce try to tease Maisie, but the girl refused to be made unhappy. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nare both miserable as it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the use of trying to\r\nmake things worse? Let\xe2\x80\x99s find things to do, and forget things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pistol was the outcome of that search. It could only be used on the\r\nmuddiest foreshore of the beach, far away from the bathing-machines and\r\npierheads, below the grassy slopes of Fort Keeling. The tide ran out\r\nnearly two miles on that coast, and the many-coloured mud-banks,\r\ntouched by the sun, sent up a lamentable smell of dead weed. It was\r\nlate in the afternoon when Dick and Maisie arrived on their ground,\r\nAmomma trotting patiently behind them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMf!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, sniffing the air. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what makes the sea so\r\nsmelly? I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never like anything that isn\xe2\x80\x99t made just for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick\r\nbluntly. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me the cartridges, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try first shot. How far does\r\none of these little revolvers carry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, half a mile,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least it makes an awful\r\nnoise. Be careful with the cartridges; I don\xe2\x80\x99t like those jagged\r\nstick-up things on the rim. Dick, do be careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I know how to load. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fire at the breakwater out there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fired, and Amomma ran away bleating. The bullet threw up a spurt of\r\nmud to the right of the wood-wreathed piles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrows high and to the right. You try, Maisie. Mind, it\xe2\x80\x99s loaded all\r\nround.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie took the pistol and stepped delicately to the verge of the mud,\r\nher hand firmly closed on the butt, her mouth and left eye screwed up.\r\n\r\nDick sat down on a tuft of bank and laughed. Amomma returned very\r\ncautiously. He was accustomed to strange experiences in his afternoon\r\nwalks, and, finding the cartridge-box unguarded, made investigations\r\nwith his nose. Maisie fired, but could not see where the bullet went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it hit the post,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shading her eyes and looking out\r\nacross the sailless sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it has gone out to the Marazion Bell-buoy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, with a\r\nchuckle. \xe2\x80\x9cFire low and to the left; then perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll get it. Oh,\r\nlook at Amomma!\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s eating the cartridges!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie turned, the revolver in her hand, just in time to see Amomma\r\nscampering away from the pebbles Dick threw after him. Nothing is\r\nsacred to a billy-goat. Being well fed and the adored of his mistress,\r\nAmomma had naturally swallowed two loaded pin-fire cartridges. Maisie\r\nhurried up to assure herself that Dick had not miscounted the tale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s eaten two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrid little beast! Then they\xe2\x80\x99ll joggle about inside him and blow up,\r\nand serve him right.... Oh, Dick! have I killed you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRevolvers are tricky things for young hands to deal with. Maisie could\r\nnot explain how it had happened, but a veil of reeking smoke separated\r\nher from Dick, and she was quite certain that the pistol had gone off\r\nin his face. Then she heard him sputter, and dropped on her knees\r\nbeside him, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cDick, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t hurt, are you? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you didn\xe2\x80\x99t, said Dick, coming out of the smoke and wiping\r\nhis cheek. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you nearly blinded me. That powder stuff stings\r\nawfully.\xe2\x80\x9d A neat little splash of gray lead on a stone showed where the\r\nbullet had gone. Maisie began to whimper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, jumping to his feet and shaking himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a\r\nbit hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I might have killed you,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Maisie, the corners of her\r\nmouth drooping. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat should I have done then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone home and told Mrs. Jennett.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick grinned at the thought; then,\r\nsoftening, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. Besides, we are wasting time.\r\n\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get back to tea. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the revolver for a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie would have wept on the least encouragement, but Dick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindifference, albeit his hand was shaking as he picked up the pistol,\r\nrestrained her. She lay panting on the beach while Dick methodically\r\nbombarded the breakwater. \xe2\x80\x9cGot it at last!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, as a lock of\r\nweed flew from the wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me try,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, imperiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey fired in turns till the rickety little revolver nearly shook\r\nitself to pieces, and Amomma the outcast\xe2\x80\x94because he might blow up at\r\nany moment\xe2\x80\x94browsed in the background and wondered why stones were\r\nthrown at him. Then they found a balk of timber floating in a pool\r\nwhich was commanded by the seaward slope of Fort Keeling, and they sat\r\ndown together before this new target.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext holidays,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, as the now thoroughly fouled revolver\r\nkicked wildly in his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll get another pistol,\xe2\x80\x94central\r\nfire,\xe2\x80\x94that will carry farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere won\xe2\x80\x99t be any next holidays for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. My lawyers have written to Mrs. Jennett, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nbe educated somewhere,\xe2\x80\x94in France, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where; but I\r\nshall be glad to go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t like it a bit. I suppose I shall be left. Look here, Maisie,\r\nis it really true you\xe2\x80\x99re going? Then these holidays will be the last I\r\nshall see anything of you; and I go back to school next week. I wish\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young blood turned his cheeks scarlet. Maisie was picking\r\ngrass-tufts and throwing them down the slope at a yellow sea-poppy\r\nnodding all by itself to the illimitable levels of the mud-flats and\r\nthe milk-white sea beyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I could see you again\r\nsometime.\r\n\r\nYou wish that, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it would have been better if\xe2\x80\x94if\xe2\x80\x94you had\xe2\x80\x94shot straight over\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94down by the breakwater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie looked with large eyes for a moment. And this was the boy who\r\nonly ten days before had decorated Amomma\xe2\x80\x99s horns with cut-paper\r\nham-frills and turned him out, a bearded derision, among the public\r\nways! Then she dropped her eyes: this was not the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be stupid,\xe2\x80\x9d she said reprovingly, and with swift instinct\r\nattacked the side-issue. \xe2\x80\x9cHow selfish you are! Just think what I should\r\nhave felt if that horrid thing had killed you! I\xe2\x80\x99m quite miserable\r\nenough already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Because you\xe2\x80\x99re going away from Mrs. Jennett?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom me, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo answer for a long time. Dick dared not look at her. He felt, though\r\nhe did not know, all that the past four years had been to him, and this\r\nthe more acutely since he had no knowledge to put his feelings in\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaisie, you must know. _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ not supposing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, weakly.\r\n\r\nBut Dick was not minded to retreat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say things,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry for teasing\r\nyou about Amomma the other day. It\xe2\x80\x99s all different now, Maisie, can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see? And you might have told me that you were going, instead of\r\nleaving me to find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I did tell. Oh, Dick, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of worrying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t any; but we\xe2\x80\x99ve been together years and years, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how much I cared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you ever did care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t; but I do,\xe2\x80\x94I care awfully now, Maisie,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ngulped,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMaisie, darling, say you care too, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, indeed I do; but it won\xe2\x80\x99t be any use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am going away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but if you promise before you go. Only say\xe2\x80\x94will you?\xe2\x80\x9d A second\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdarling\xe2\x80\x99 came to his lips more easily than the first. There were few\r\nendearments in Dick\xe2\x80\x99s home or school life; he had to find them by\r\ninstinct. Dick caught the little hand blackened with the escaped gas of\r\nthe revolver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise,\xe2\x80\x9d she said solemnly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if I care there is no need for\r\npromising.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you care?\xe2\x80\x9d For the first time in the past few minutes their\r\neyes met and spoke for them who had no skill in speech....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dick, don\xe2\x80\x99t! Please don\xe2\x80\x99t! It was all right when we said\r\ngood-morning; but now it\xe2\x80\x99s all different!\xe2\x80\x9d Amomma looked on from afar.\r\n\r\nHe had seen his property quarrel frequently, but he had never seen\r\nkisses exchanged before. The yellow sea-poppy was wiser, and nodded its\r\nhead approvingly. Considered as a kiss, that was a failure, but since\r\nit was the first, other than those demanded by duty, in all the world\r\nthat either had ever given or taken, it opened to them new worlds, and\r\nevery one of them glorious, so that they were lifted above the\r\nconsideration of any worlds at all, especially those in which tea is\r\nnecessary, and sat still, holding each other\xe2\x80\x99s hands and saying not a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t forget now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, at last. There was that on his cheek\r\nthat stung more than gunpowder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have forgotten anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, and they looked at\r\neach other and saw that each was changed from the companion of an hour\r\nago to a wonder and a mystery they could not understand. The sun began\r\nto set, and a night-wind thrashed along the bents of the foreshore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be awfully late for tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s use the rest of the cartridges first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick; and he helped\r\nMaisie down the slope of the fort to the sea,\xe2\x80\x94a descent that she was\r\nquite capable of covering at full speed. Equally gravely Maisie took\r\nthe grimy hand. Dick bent forward clumsily; Maisie drew the hand away,\r\nand Dick blushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, with a little laugh of gratified vanity. She stood\r\nclose to Dick as he loaded the revolver for the last time and fired\r\nover the sea with a vague notion at the back of his head that he was\r\nprotecting Maisie from all the evils in the world. A puddle far across\r\nthe mud caught the last rays of the sun and turned into a wrathful red\r\ndisc. The light held Dick\xe2\x80\x99s attention for a moment, and as he raised\r\nhis revolver there fell upon him a renewed sense of the miraculous, in\r\nthat he was standing by Maisie who had promised to care for him for an\r\nindefinite length of time till such date as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 A gust of the growing\r\nwind drove the girl\xe2\x80\x99s long black hair across his face as she stood with\r\nher hand on his shoulder calling Amomma \xe2\x80\x9ca little beast,\xe2\x80\x9d and for a\r\nmoment he was in the dark,\xe2\x80\x94a darkness that stung. The bullet went\r\nsinging out to the empty sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpoilt my aim,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThere aren\xe2\x80\x99t any more\r\ncartridges; we shall have to run home.\xe2\x80\x9d But they did not run. They\r\nwalked very slowly, arm in arm. And it was a matter of indifference to\r\nthem whether the neglected Amomma with two pin-fire cartridges in his\r\ninside blew up or trotted beside them; for they had come into a golden\r\nheritage and were disposing of it with all the wisdom of all their\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Dick, valiantly. Then he checked himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what I shall be. I don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be able to pass any exams,\r\nbut I can make awful caricatures of the masters. Ho! Ho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe an artist, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always laughing at my trying\r\nto draw; and it will do you good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never laugh at anything you do,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be an artist,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll do things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArtists always want money, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a hundred and twenty pounds a year of my own. My guardians\r\ntell me I\xe2\x80\x99m to have it when I come of age. That will be enough to begin\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I\xe2\x80\x99m rich,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got three hundred a year all my own\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m twenty-one. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Mrs. Jennett is kinder to me than she\r\nis to you. I wish, though, that I had somebody that belonged to\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x94just a father or a mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou belong to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, \xe2\x80\x9cfor ever and ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we belong\xe2\x80\x94for ever. It\xe2\x80\x99s very nice.\xe2\x80\x9d She squeezed his arm. The\r\nkindly darkness hid them both, and, emboldened because he could only\r\njust see the profile of Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s cheek with the long lashes veiling the\r\ngray eyes, Dick at the front door delivered himself of the words he had\r\nbeen boggling over for the last two hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x94love you, Maisie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a whisper that seemed to him to\r\nring across the world,\xe2\x80\x94the world that he would to-morrow or the next\r\nday set out to conquer.\r\n\r\nThere was a scene, not, for the sake of discipline, to be reported,\r\nwhen Mrs. Jennett would have fallen upon him, first for disgraceful\r\nunpunctuality, and secondly for nearly killing himself with a forbidden\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was playing with it, and it went off by itself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, when the\r\npowder-pocked cheek could no longer be hidden, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you think you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngoing to lick me you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. You are never going to touch me again.\r\n\r\nSit down and give me my tea. You can\xe2\x80\x99t cheat us out of that, anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jennett gasped and became livid. Maisie said nothing, but\r\nencouraged Dick with her eyes, and he behaved abominably all that\r\nevening. Mrs. Jennett prophesied an immediate judgment of Providence\r\nand a descent into Tophet later, but Dick walked in Paradise and would\r\nnot hear. Only when he was going to bed Mrs. Jennett recovered and\r\nasserted herself. He had bidden Maisie good-night with down-dropped\r\neyes and from a distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a gentleman you might try to behave like one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\n\r\nJennett, spitefully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been quarrelling with Maisie again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis meant that the usual good-night kiss had been omitted. Maisie,\r\nwhite to the lips, thrust her cheek forward with a fine air of\r\nindifference, and was duly pecked by Dick, who tramped out of the room\r\nred as fire. That night he dreamed a wild dream. He had won all the\r\nworld and brought it to Maisie in a cartridge-box, but she turned it\r\nover with her foot, and, instead of saying \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is\r\nthe grass collar you promised for Amomma? Oh, how selfish you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThen we brought the lances down, then the bugles blew,\r\nWhen we went to Kandahar, ridin\xe2\x80\x99 two an\xe2\x80\x99 two,\r\n    Ridin\xe2\x80\x99, ridin\xe2\x80\x99, ridin\xe2\x80\x99, two an\xe2\x80\x99 two,\r\n        Ta-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra,\r\nAll the way to Kandahar, ridin\xe2\x80\x99 two an\xe2\x80\x99 two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Barrack-Room Ballad_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not angry with the British public, but I wish we had a few\r\nthousand of them scattered among these rooks. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in such\r\na hurry to get at their morning papers then. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you imagine the\r\nregulation householder\xe2\x80\x94Lover of Justice, Constant Reader,\r\nPaterfamilias, and all that lot\xe2\x80\x94frizzling on hot gravel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a blue veil over his head, and his clothes in strips. Has any man\r\nhere a needle? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a piece of sugar-sack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll lend you a packing-needle for six square inches of it then. Both\r\nmy knees are worn through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not six square acres, while you\xe2\x80\x99re about it? But lend me the\r\nneedle, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see what I can do with the selvage. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s enough to protect my royal body from the cold blast as it is.\r\nWhat are you doing with that everlasting sketch-book of yours, Dick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStudy of our Special Correspondent repairing his wardrobe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick,\r\ngravely, as the other man kicked off a pair of sorely worn\r\nriding-breeches and began to fit a square of coarse canvas over the\r\nmost obvious open space. He grunted disconsolately as the vastness of\r\nthe void developed itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSugar-bags, indeed! Hi! you pilot man there! lend me all the sails for\r\nthat whale-boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fez-crowned head bobbed up in the stern-sheets, divided itself into\r\nexact halves with one flashing grin, and bobbed down again. The man of\r\nthe tattered breeches, clad only in a Norfolk jacket and a gray flannel\r\nshirt, went on with his clumsy sewing, while Dick chuckled over the\r\nsketch.\r\n\r\nSome twenty whale-boats were nuzzling a sand-bank which was dotted with\r\nEnglish soldiery of half a dozen corps, bathing or washing their\r\nclothes. A heap of boat-rollers, commissariat-boxes, sugar-bags, and\r\nflour- and small-arm-ammunition-cases showed where one of the\r\nwhale-boats had been compelled to unload hastily; and a regimental\r\ncarpenter was swearing aloud as he tried, on a wholly insufficient\r\nallowance of white lead, to plaster up the sun-parched gaping seams of\r\nthe boat herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst the bloomin\xe2\x80\x99 rudder snaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the world in general;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthen the mast goes; an\xe2\x80\x99 then, s\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9chelp me, when she can\xe2\x80\x99t do nothin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nelse, she opens \xe2\x80\x99erself out like a cock-eyes Chinese lotus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly the case with my breeches, whoever you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tailor,\r\nwithout looking up. \xe2\x80\x9cDick, I wonder when I shall see a decent shop\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, save the incessant angry murmur of the Nile as it\r\nraced round a basalt-walled bend and foamed across a rock-ridge half a\r\nmile upstream. It was as though the brown weight of the river would\r\ndrive the white men back to their own country. The indescribable scent\r\nof Nile mud in the air told that the stream was falling and the next\r\nfew miles would be no light thing for the whale-boats to overpass. The\r\ndesert ran down almost to the banks, where, among gray, red, and black\r\nhillocks, a camel-corps was encamped. No man dared even for a day lose\r\ntouch of the slow-moving boats; there had been no fighting for weeks\r\npast, and throughout all that time the Nile had never spared them.\r\nRapid had followed rapid, rock rock, and island-group island-group,\r\ntill the rank and file had long since lost all count of direction and\r\nvery nearly of time. They were moving somewhere, they did not know why,\r\nto do something, they did not know what. Before them lay the Nile, and\r\nat the other end of it was one Gordon, fighting for the dear life, in a\r\ntown called Khartoum. There were columns of British troops in the\r\ndesert, or in one of the many deserts; there were yet more columns\r\nwaiting to embark on the river; there were fresh drafts waiting at\r\nAssioot and Assuan; there were lies and rumours running over the face\r\nof the hopeless land from Suakin to the Sixth Cataract, and men\r\nsupposed generally that there must be some one in authority to direct\r\nthe general scheme of the many movements. The duty of that particular\r\nriver-column was to keep the whale-boats afloat in the water, to avoid\r\ntrampling on the villagers\xe2\x80\x99 crops when the gangs \xe2\x80\x9ctracked\xe2\x80\x99 the boats\r\nwith lines thrown from midstream, to get as much sleep and food as was\r\npossible, and, above all, to press on without delay in the teeth of the\r\nchurning Nile.\r\n\r\nWith the soldiers sweated and toiled the correspondents of the\r\nnewspapers, and they were almost as ignorant as their companions. But\r\nit was above all things necessary that England at breakfast should be\r\namused and thrilled and interested, whether Gordon lived or died, or\r\nhalf the British army went to pieces in the sands. The Soudan campaign\r\nwas a picturesque one, and lent itself to vivid word-painting. Now and\r\nagain a \xe2\x80\x9cSpecial\xe2\x80\x99 managed to get slain,\xe2\x80\x94which was not altogether a\r\ndisadvantage to the paper that employed him,\xe2\x80\x94and more often the\r\nhand-to-hand nature of the fighting allowed of miraculous escapes which\r\nwere worth telegraphing home at eighteenpence the word. There were many\r\ncorrespondents with many corps and columns,\xe2\x80\x94from the veterans who had\r\nfollowed on the heels of the cavalry that occupied Cairo in \xe2\x80\x9982, what\r\ntime Arabi Pasha called himself king, who had seen the first miserable\r\nwork round Suakin when the sentries were cut up nightly and the scrub\r\nswarmed with spears, to youngsters jerked into the business at the end\r\nof a telegraph-wire to take the places of their betters killed or\r\ninvalided.\r\n\r\nAmong the seniors\xe2\x80\x94those who knew every shift and change in the\r\nperplexing postal arrangements, the value of the seediest, weediest\r\nEgyptian garron offered for sale in Cairo or Alexandria, who could talk\r\na telegraph-clerk into amiability and soothe the ruffled vanity of a\r\nnewly appointed staff-officer when press regulations became\r\nburdensome\xe2\x80\x94was the man in the flannel shirt, the black-browed\r\nTorpenhow. He represented the Central Southern Syndicate in the\r\ncampaign, as he had represented it in the Egyptian war, and elsewhere.\r\nThe syndicate did not concern itself greatly with criticisms of attack\r\nand the like. It supplied the masses, and all it demanded was\r\npicturesqueness and abundance of detail; for there is more joy in\r\nEngland over a soldier who insubordinately steps out of square to\r\nrescue a comrade than over twenty generals slaving even to baldness at\r\nthe gross details of transport and commissariat.\r\n\r\nHe had met at Suakin a young man, sitting on the edge of a recently\r\nabandoned redoubt about the size of a hat-box, sketching a clump of\r\nshell-torn bodies on the gravel plain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. The greeting of the correspondent\r\nis that of the commercial traveller on the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, without looking up. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any\r\ntobacco?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow waited till the sketch was finished, and when he had looked\r\nat it said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your business here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing; there was a row, so I came. I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to be doing\r\nsomething down at the painting-slips among the boats, or else I\xe2\x80\x99m in\r\ncharge of the condenser on one of the water-ships. I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten\r\nwhich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve cheek enough to build a redoubt with,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, and took\r\nstock of the new acquaintance. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you always draw like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man produced more sketches. \xe2\x80\x9cRow on a Chinese pig-boat,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, sententiously, showing them one after another.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cChief mate dirked\r\nby a comprador.\xe2\x80\x94Junk ashore off Hakodate.\xe2\x80\x94Somali muleteer being\r\nflogged.\xe2\x80\x94Star-shelled bursting over camp at Berbera.\xe2\x80\x94Slave-dhow being\r\nchased round Tajurrah Bah.\xe2\x80\x94Soldier lying dead in the moonlight outside\r\nSuakin.\xe2\x80\x94throat cut by Fuzzies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t say I care for Verestchagin-and-water\r\nmyself, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no accounting for tastes. Doing anything now, are\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I\xe2\x80\x99m amusing myself here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow looked at the aching desolation of the place. \xe2\x80\x9cFaith, you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nqueer notions of amusement. Got any money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough to go on with. Look here: do you want me to do war-work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t. My syndicate may, though. You can draw more than a little,\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you care much what you get, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot this time. I want my chance first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow looked at the sketches again, and nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\xe2\x80\x99re right\r\nto take your first chance when you can get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rode away swiftly through the Gate of the Two War-Ships, rattled\r\nacross the causeway into the town, and wired to his syndicate, \xe2\x80\x9cGot man\r\nhere, picture-work. Good and cheap. Shall I arrange? Will do\r\nletterpress with sketches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man on the redoubt sat swinging his legs and murmuring, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew the\r\nchance would come, sooner or later. By Gad, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to sweat for\r\nit if I come through this business alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the evening Torpenhow was able to announce to his friend that the\r\nCentral Southern Agency was willing to take him on trial, paying\r\nexpenses for three months. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, by the way, what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTorpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeldar. Do they give me a free hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve taken you on chance. You must justify the choice. You\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\nstick to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m going up-country with a column, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do what I can\r\nfor you. Give me some of your sketches taken here, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nalong.\xe2\x80\x9d To himself he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the best bargain the Central\r\nsouthern has ever made; and they got me cheaply enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass that, after some purchase of horse-flesh and\r\narrangements financial and political, Dick was made free of the New and\r\nHonourable Fraternity of war correspondents, who all possess the\r\ninalienable right of doing as much work as they can and getting as much\r\nfor it as Providence and their owners shall please. To these things are\r\nadded in time, if the brother be worthy, the power of glib speech that\r\nneither man nor woman can resist when a meal or a bed is in question,\r\nthe eye of a horse-cope, the skill of a cook, the constitution of a\r\nbullock, the digestion of an ostrich, and an infinite adaptability to\r\nall circumstances. But many die before they attain to this degree, and\r\nthe past-masters in the craft appear for the most part in dress-clothes\r\nwhen they are in England, and thus their glory is hidden from the\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\nDick followed Torpenhow wherever the latter\xe2\x80\x99s fancy chose to lead him,\r\nand between the two they managed to accomplish some work that almost\r\nsatisfied themselves. It was not an easy life in any way, and under its\r\ninfluence the two were drawn very closely together, for they ate from\r\nthe same dish, they shared the same water-bottle, and, most binding tie\r\nof all, their mails went off together. It was Dick who managed to make\r\ngloriously drunk a telegraph-clerk in a palm hut far beyond the Second\r\nCataract, and, while the man lay in bliss on the floor, possessed\r\nhimself of some laboriously acquired exclusive information, forwarded\r\nby a confiding correspondent of an opposition syndicate, made a careful\r\nduplicate of the matter, and brought the result to Torpenhow, who said\r\nthat all was fair in love or war correspondence, and built an excellent\r\ndescriptive article from his rival\xe2\x80\x99s riotous waste of words. It was\r\nTorpenhow who\xe2\x80\x94but the tale of their adventures, together and apart,\r\nfrom Philae to the waste wilderness of Herawi and Muella, would fill\r\nmany books. They had been penned into a square side by side, in deadly\r\nfear of being shot by over-excited soldiers; they had fought with\r\nbaggage-camels in the chill dawn; they had jogged along in silence\r\nunder blinding sun on indefatigable little Egyptian horses; and they\r\nhad floundered on the shallows of the Nile when the whale-boat in which\r\nthey had found a berth chose to hit a hidden rock and rip out half her\r\nbottom-planks.\r\n\r\nNow they were sitting on the sand-bank, and the whale-boats were\r\nbringing up the remainder of the column.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, as he put the last rude stitches into his\r\nover-long-neglected gear, \xe2\x80\x9cit has been a beautiful business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe patch or the campaign?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think much of either,\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want the _Euryalus_ brought up above the Third Cataract, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou? and eighty-one-ton guns at Jakdul? Now, _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ quite satisfied with\r\nmy breeches.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned round gravely to exhibit himself, after the\r\nmanner of a clown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very pretty. Specially the lettering on the sack. G.B.T.\r\nGovernment Bullock Train. That\xe2\x80\x99s a sack from India.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my initials,\xe2\x80\x94Gilbert Belling Torpenhow. I stole the cloth on\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWhat the mischief are the camel-corps doing yonder?\xe2\x80\x9d Torpenhow shaded\r\nhis eyes and looked across the scrub-strewn gravel.\r\n\r\nA bugle blew furiously, and the men on the bank hurried to their arms\r\nand accoutrements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cPisan soldiery surprised while bathing,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Dick, calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you remember the picture? It\xe2\x80\x99s by Michael Angelo; all beginners copy\r\nit. That scrub\xe2\x80\x99s alive with enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel-corps on the bank yelled to the infantry to come to them, and\r\na hoarse shouting down the river showed that the remainder of the\r\ncolumn had wind of the trouble and was hastening to take share in it.\r\nAs swiftly as a reach of still water is crisped by the wind, the\r\nrock-strewn ridges and scrub-topped hills were troubled and alive with\r\narmed men.\r\n\r\nMercifully, it occurred to these to stand far off for a time, to shout\r\nand gesticulate joyously. One man even delivered himself of a long\r\nstory. The camel-corps did not fire. They were only too glad of a\r\nlittle breathing-space, until some sort of square could be formed. The\r\nmen on the sand-bank ran to their side; and the whale-boats, as they\r\ntoiled up within shouting distance, were thrust into the nearest bank\r\nand emptied of all save the sick and a few men to guard them. The Arab\r\norator ceased his outcries, and his friends howled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey look like the Mahdi\xe2\x80\x99s men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, elbowing himself into\r\nthe crush of the square; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what thousands of \xe2\x80\x99em there are! The\r\ntribes hereabout aren\xe2\x80\x99t against us, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the Mahdi\xe2\x80\x99s taken another town,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, \xe2\x80\x9cand set all these\r\nyelping devils free to show us up. Lend us your glass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur scouts should have told us of this. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been trapped,\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\nsubaltern. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t the camel guns ever going to begin? Hurry up, you\r\nmen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no need of any order. The men flung themselves panting\r\nagainst the sides of the square, for they had good reason to know that\r\nwhoso was left outside when the fighting began would very probably die\r\nin an extremely unpleasant fashion. The little hundred-and-fifty-pound\r\ncamel-guns posted at one corner of the square opened the ball as the\r\nsquare moved forward by its right to get possession of a knoll of\r\nrising ground. All had fought in this manner many times before, and\r\nthere was no novelty in the entertainment; always the same hot and\r\nstifling formation, the smell of dust and leather, the same boltlike\r\nrush of the enemy, the same pressure on the weakest side, the few\r\nminutes of hand-to-hand scuffle, and then the silence of the desert,\r\nbroken only by the yells of those whom their handful of cavalry\r\nattempted to pursue. They had become careless. The camel-guns spoke at\r\nintervals, and the square slouched forward amid the protesting of the\r\ncamels. Then came the attack of three thousand men who had not learned\r\nfrom books that it is impossible for troops in close order to attack\r\nagainst breech-loading fire.\r\n\r\nA few dropping shots heralded their approach, and a few horsemen led,\r\nbut the bulk of the force was naked humanity, mad with rage, and armed\r\nwith the spear and the sword. The instinct of the desert, where there\r\nis always much war, told them that the right flank of the square was\r\nthe weakest, for they swung clear of the front. The camel-guns shelled\r\nthem as they passed and opened for an instant lanes through their\r\nmidst, most like those quick-closing vistas in a Kentish hop-garden\r\nseen when the train races by at full speed; and the infantry fire, held\r\ntill the opportune moment, dropped them in close-packing hundreds. No\r\ncivilised troops in the world could have endured the hell through which\r\nthey came, the living leaping high to avoid the dying who clutched at\r\ntheir heels, the wounded cursing and staggering forward, till they\r\nfell\xe2\x80\x94a torrent black as the sliding water above a mill-dam\xe2\x80\x94full on the\r\nright flank of the square.\r\n\r\nThen the line of the dusty troops and the faint blue desert sky\r\noverhead went out in rolling smoke, and the little stones on the heated\r\nground and the tinder-dry clumps of scrub became matters of surpassing\r\ninterest, for men measured their agonised retreat and recovery by these\r\nthings, counting mechanically and hewing their way back to chosen\r\npebble and branch. There was no semblance of any concerted fighting.\r\nFor aught the men knew, the enemy might be attempting all four sides of\r\nthe square at once. Their business was to destroy what lay in front of\r\nthem, to bayonet in the back those who passed over them, and, dying, to\r\ndrag down the slayer till he could be knocked on the head by some\r\navenging gun-butt.\r\n\r\nDick waited with Torpenhow and a young doctor till the stress grew\r\nunendurable. It was hopeless to attend to the wounded till the attack\r\nwas repulsed, so the three moved forward gingerly towards the weakest\r\nside of the square. There was a rush from without, the short\r\n_hough-hough_ of the stabbing spears, and a man on a horse, followed by\r\nthirty or forty others, dashed through, yelling and hacking. The right\r\nflank of the square sucked in after them, and the other sides sent\r\nhelp. The wounded, who knew that they had but a few hours more to live,\r\ncaught at the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s feet and brought them down, or, staggering into a\r\ndiscarded rifle, fired blindly into the scuffle that raged in the\r\ncentre of the square.\r\n\r\nDick was conscious that somebody had cut him violently across his\r\nhelmet, that he had fired his revolver into a black, foam-flecked face\r\nwhich forthwith ceased to bear any resemblance to a face, and that\r\nTorpenhow had gone down under an Arab whom he had tried to \xe2\x80\x9ccollar\r\nlow,\xe2\x80\x9d and was turning over and over with his captive, feeling for the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. The doctor jabbed at a venture with a bayonet, and a\r\nhelmetless soldier fired over Dick\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder: the flying grains of\r\npowder stung his cheek. It was to Torpenhow that Dick turned by\r\ninstinct. The representative of the Central Southern Syndicate had\r\nshaken himself clear of his enemy, and rose, wiping his thumb on his\r\ntrousers. The Arab, both hands to his forehead, screamed aloud, then\r\nsnatched up his spear and rushed at Torpenhow, who was panting under\r\nshelter of Dick\xe2\x80\x99s revolver. Dick fired twice, and the man dropped\r\nlimply. His upturned face lacked one eye. The musketry-fire redoubled,\r\nbut cheers mingled with it. The rush had failed and the enemy were\r\nflying. If the heart of the square were shambles, the ground beyond was\r\na butcher\xe2\x80\x99s shop. Dick thrust his way forward between the maddened men.\r\nThe remnant of the enemy were retiring, as the few\xe2\x80\x94the very few\xe2\x80\x94English\r\ncavalry rode down the laggards.\r\n\r\nBeyond the lines of the dead, a broad blood-stained Arab spear cast\r\naside in the retreat lay across a stump of scrub, and beyond this again\r\nthe illimitable dark levels of the desert. The sun caught the steel and\r\nturned it into a red disc. Some one behind him was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, get\r\naway, you brute!\xe2\x80\x9d Dick raised his revolver and pointed towards the\r\ndesert. His eye was held by the red splash in the distance, and the\r\nclamour about him seemed to die down to a very far-away whisper, like\r\nthe whisper of a level sea. There was the revolver and the red\r\nlight.... and the voice of some one scaring something away, exactly as\r\nhad fallen somewhere before,\xe2\x80\x94a darkness that stung. He fired at random,\r\nand the bullet went out across the desert as he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cSpoilt my\r\naim. There aren\xe2\x80\x99t any more cartridges. We shall have to run home.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nput his hand to his head and brought it away covered with blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld man, you\xe2\x80\x99re cut rather badly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cI owe you\r\nsomething for this business. Thanks. Stand up! I say, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be ill\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThroughout the night, when the troops were encamped by the whale-boats,\r\na black figure danced in the strong moonlight on the sand-bar and\r\nshouted that Khartoum the accursed one was dead,\xe2\x80\x94was dead,\xe2\x80\x94was\r\ndead,\xe2\x80\x94that two steamers were rock-staked on the Nile outside the city,\r\nand that of all their crews there remained not one; and Khartoum was\r\ndead,\xe2\x80\x94was dead,\xe2\x80\x94was dead!\r\n\r\nBut Torpenhow took no heed. He was watching Dick, who called aloud to\r\nthe restless Nile for Maisie,\xe2\x80\x94and again Maisie!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold a phenomenon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, rearranging the blanket. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\r\nis a man, presumably human, who mentions the name of one woman only.\r\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a good deal of delirium, too.\xe2\x80\x94Dick, here\xe2\x80\x99s some fizzy\r\ndrink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Maisie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nSo he thinks he shall take to the sea again\r\n    For one more cruise with his buccaneers,\r\nTo singe the beard of the King of Spain,\r\nAnd capture another Dean of Jaen\r\n    And sell him in Algiers.\xe2\x80\x94_A Dutch Picture_.\xe2\x80\x94Longfellow\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Soudan campaign and Dick\xe2\x80\x99s broken head had been some months ended\r\nand mended, and the Central Southern Syndicate had paid Dick a certain\r\nsum on account for work done, which work they were careful to assure\r\nhim was not altogether up to their standard. Dick heaved the letter\r\ninto the Nile at Cairo, cashed the draft in the same town, and bade a\r\nwarm farewell to Torpenhow at the station.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to lie up for a while and rest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow where I shall live in London, but if God brings us to meet, we\r\nshall meet. Are you staying here on the off-chance of another row?\r\nThere will be none till the Southern Soudan is reoccupied by our\r\ntroops. Mark that. Good-bye; bless you; come back when your money\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspent; and give me your address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick loitered in Cairo, Alexandria, Ismailia, and Port Said,\xe2\x80\x94especially\r\nPort Said. There is iniquity in many parts of the world, and vice in\r\nall, but the concentrated essence of all the iniquities and all the\r\nvices in all the continents finds itself at Port Said. And through the\r\nheart of that sand-bordered hell, where the mirage flickers day long\r\nabove the Bitter Lake, move, if you will only wait, most of the men and\r\nwomen you have known in this life. Dick established himself in quarters\r\nmore riotous than respectable. He spent his evenings on the quay, and\r\nboarded many ships, and saw very many friends,\xe2\x80\x94gracious Englishwomen\r\nwith whom he had talked not too wisely in the veranda of Shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHotel, hurrying war correspondents, skippers of the contract\r\ntroop-ships employed in the campaign, army officers by the score, and\r\nothers of less reputable trades.\r\n\r\nHe had choice of all the races of the East and West for studies, and\r\nthe advantage of seeing his subjects under the influence of strong\r\nexcitement, at the gaming-tables, saloons, dancing-hells, and\r\nelsewhere. For recreation there was the straight vista of the Canal,\r\nthe blazing sands, the procession of shipping, and the white hospitals\r\nwhere the English soldiers lay. He strove to set down in black and\r\nwhite and colour all that Providence sent him, and when that supply was\r\nended sought about for fresh material. It was a fascinating employment,\r\nbut it ran away with his money, and he had drawn in advance the hundred\r\nand twenty pounds to which he was entitled yearly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I shall have to\r\nwork and starve!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, and was addressing himself to this new\r\nfate when a mysterious telegram arrived from Torpenhow in England,\r\nwhich said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome back, quick; you have caught on. Come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA large smile overspread his face. \xe2\x80\x9cSo soon! that\xe2\x80\x99s a good hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be an orgy to-night. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand or fall\r\nby my luck. Faith, it\xe2\x80\x99s time it came!\xe2\x80\x9d He deposited half of his funds\r\nin the hands of his well-known friends Monsieur and Madame Binat, and\r\nordered himself a Zanzibar dance of the finest. Monsieur Binat was\r\nshaking with drink, but Madame smiles sympathetically\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur needs a\r\nchair, of course, and of course Monsieur will sketch; Monsieur amuses\r\nhimself strangely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBinat raised a blue-white face from a cot in the inner room. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand,\xe2\x80\x9d he quavered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all know Monsieur. Monsieur is an artist,\r\nas I have been.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the end,\xe2\x80\x9d said Binat, with gravity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur will descend alive into hell, as I have descended.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must come to the dance, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my face? I knew it would be so. For my face? My God! and for my\r\ndegradation so tremendous! I will not. Take him away. He is a devil. Or\r\nat least do thou, Celeste, demand of him more.\xe2\x80\x9d The excellent Binat\r\nbegan to kick and scream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll things are for sale in Port Said,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame. \xe2\x80\x9cIf my husband\r\ncomes it will be so much more. Eh, \xe2\x80\x9chow you call\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99alf a sovereign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe money was paid, and the mad dance was held at night in a walled\r\ncourtyard at the back of Madame Binat\xe2\x80\x99s house. The lady herself, in\r\nfaded mauve silk always about to slide from her yellow shoulders,\r\nplayed the piano, and to the tin-pot music of a Western waltz the naked\r\nZanzibari girls danced furiously by the light of kerosene lamps. Binat\r\nsat upon a chair and stared with eyes that saw nothing, till the whirl\r\nof the dance and the clang of the rattling piano stole into the drink\r\nthat took the place of blood in his veins, and his face glistened. Dick\r\ntook him by the chin brutally and turned that face to the light. Madame\r\nBinat looked over her shoulder and smiled with many teeth. Dick leaned\r\nagainst the wall and sketched for an hour, till the kerosene lamps\r\nbegan to smell, and the girls threw themselves panting on the\r\nhard-beaten ground. Then he shut his book with a snap and moved away,\r\nBinat plucking feebly at his elbow. \xe2\x80\x9cShow me,\xe2\x80\x9d he whimpered. \xe2\x80\x9cI too was\r\nonce an artist, even I!\xe2\x80\x9d Dick showed him the rough sketch. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe screamed. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you take that away with you and show all the world\r\nthat it is I,\xe2\x80\x94Binat?\xe2\x80\x9d He moaned and wept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur has paid for all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame. \xe2\x80\x9cTo the pleasure of seeing\r\nMonsieur again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe courtyard gate shut, and Dick hurried up the sandy street to the\r\nnearest gambling-hell, where he was well known. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the luck holds,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s an omen; if I lose, I must stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d He placed his money\r\npicturesquely about the board, hardly daring to look at what he did.\r\nThe luck held.\r\n\r\nThree turns of the wheel left him richer by twenty pounds, and he went\r\ndown to the shipping to make friends with the captain of a decayed\r\ncargo-steamer, who landed him in London with fewer pounds in his pocket\r\nthan he cared to think about.\r\n\r\nA thin gray fog hung over the city, and the streets were very cold; for\r\nsummer was in England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a cheerful wilderness, and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the knack of altering much,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nDick thought, as he tramped from the Docks westward. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, what must I\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe packed houses gave no answer. Dick looked down the long lightless\r\nstreets and at the appalling rush of traffic. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you rabbit-hutches!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, addressing a row of highly respectable semi-detached\r\nresidences. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do later on? You have to\r\nsupply me with men-servants and maid-servants,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here he smacked his\r\nlips,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand the peculiar treasure of kings. Meantime I\xe2\x80\x99ll find clothes\r\nand boots, and presently I will return and trample on you.\xe2\x80\x9d He stepped\r\nforward energetically; he saw that one of his shoes was burst at the\r\nside. As he stooped to make investigations, a man jostled him into the\r\ngutter. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s another nick in the score. I\xe2\x80\x99ll jostle you later on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGood clothes and boots are not cheap, and Dick left his last shop with\r\nthe certainty that he would be respectably arrayed for a time, but with\r\nonly fifty shillings in his pocket. He returned to streets by the\r\nDocks, and lodged himself in one room, where the sheets on the bed were\r\nalmost audibly marked in case of theft, and where nobody seemed to go\r\nto bed at all. When his clothes arrived he sought the Central Southern\r\nSyndicate for Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s address, and got it, with the intimation that\r\nthere was still some money waiting for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, as one who habitually dealt in millions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween thirty and forty pounds. If it would be any convenience to\r\nyou, of course we could let you have it at once; but we usually settle\r\naccounts monthly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I show that I want anything now, I\xe2\x80\x99m lost,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I need I\xe2\x80\x99ll take later on.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hardly worth while;\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the country for a month, too. Wait till I come back,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll see about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we trust, Mr. Heldar, that you do not intend to sever your\r\nconnection with us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s business in life was the study of faces, and he watched the\r\nspeaker keenly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat man means something,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do no\r\nbusiness till I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Torpenhow. There\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal coming.\xe2\x80\x9d So he\r\ndeparted, making no promises, to his one little room by the Docks. And\r\nthat day was the seventh of the month, and that month, he reckoned with\r\nawful distinctness, had thirty-one days in it!\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for a man of catholic tastes and healthy appetites to\r\nexist for twenty-four days on fifty shillings. Nor is it cheering to\r\nbegin the experiment alone in all the loneliness of London. Dick paid\r\nseven shillings a week for his lodging, which left him rather less than\r\na shilling a day for food and drink. Naturally, his first purchase was\r\nof the materials of his craft; he had been without them too long. Half\r\na day\xe2\x80\x99s investigations and comparison brought him to the conclusion\r\nthat sausages and mashed potatoes, twopence a plate, were the best\r\nfood. Now, sausages once or twice a week for breakfast are not\r\nunpleasant. As lunch, even, with mashed potatoes, they become\r\nmonotonous. At dinner they are impertinent. At the end of three days\r\nDick loathed sausages, and, going forth, pawned his watch to revel on\r\nsheep\xe2\x80\x99s head, which is not as cheap as it looks, owing to the bones and\r\nthe gravy. Then he returned to sausages and mashed potatoes. Then he\r\nconfined himself entirely to mashed potatoes for a day, and was unhappy\r\nbecause of pain in his inside. Then he pawned his waistcoat and his\r\ntie, and thought regretfully of money thrown away in times past. There\r\nare few things more edifying unto Art than the actual belly-pinch of\r\nhunger, and Dick in his few walks abroad,\xe2\x80\x94he did not care for exercise;\r\nit raised desires that could not be satisfied\xe2\x80\x94found himself dividing\r\nmankind into two classes,\xe2\x80\x94those who looked as if they might give him\r\nsomething to eat, and those who looked otherwise. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew what I\r\nhad to learn about the human face before,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; and, as a reward\r\nfor his humility, Providence caused a cab-driver at a sausage-shop\r\nwhere Dick fed that night to leave half eaten a great chunk of bread.\r\nDick took it,\xe2\x80\x94would have fought all the world for its possession,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nit cheered him.\r\n\r\nThe month dragged through at last, and, nearly prancing with\r\nimpatience, he went to draw his money. Then he hastened to Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naddress and smelt the smell of cooking meats all along the corridors of\r\nthe chambers. Torpenhow was on the top floor, and Dick burst into his\r\nroom, to be received with a hug which nearly cracked his ribs, as\r\nTorpenhow dragged him to the light and spoke of twenty different things\r\nin the same breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re looking tucked up,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot anything to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, his eye roaming round the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be having breakfast in a minute. What do you say to sausages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, anything but sausages! Torp, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been starving on that accursed\r\nhorse-flesh for thirty days and thirty nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, what lunacy has been your latest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick spoke of the last few weeks with unbridled speech. Then he opened\r\nhis coat; there was no waistcoat below. \xe2\x80\x9cI ran it fine, awfully fine,\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve just scraped through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t much sense, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a backbone, anyhow. Eat, and\r\ntalk afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick fell upon eggs and bacon and gorged till he\r\ncould gorge no more. Torpenhow handed him a filled pipe, and he smoked\r\nas men smoke who for three weeks have been deprived of good tobacco.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOuf!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s heavenly! Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy in the world didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; I owe you too much already, old man. Besides I had a sort of\r\nsuperstition that this temporary starvation\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it was, and it\r\nhurt\xe2\x80\x94would bring me luck later. It\xe2\x80\x99s over and done with now, and none\r\nof the syndicate know how hard up I was. Fire away. What\xe2\x80\x99s the exact\r\nstate of affairs as regards myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had my wire? You\xe2\x80\x99ve caught on here. People like your work\r\nimmensely. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but they do. They say you have a fresh\r\ntouch and a new way of drawing things. And, because they\xe2\x80\x99re chiefly\r\nhome-bred English, they say you have insight. You\xe2\x80\x99re wanted by half a\r\ndozen papers; you\xe2\x80\x99re wanted to illustrate books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick grunted scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wanted to work up your smaller sketches and sell them to the\r\ndealers. They seem to think the money sunk in you is a good investment.\r\n\r\nGood Lord! who can account for the fathomless folly of the public?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re a remarkably sensible people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are subject to fits, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean; and you happen to\r\nbe the object of the latest fit among those who are interested in what\r\nthey call Art. Just now you\xe2\x80\x99re a fashion, a phenomenon, or whatever you\r\nplease. I appeared to be the only person who knew anything about you\r\nhere, and I have been showing the most useful men a few of the sketches\r\nyou gave me from time to time. Those coming after your work on the\r\nCentral Southern Syndicate appear to have done your business. You\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\nluck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh! call it luck! Do call it luck, when a man has been kicking about\r\nthe world like a dog, waiting for it to come! I\xe2\x80\x99ll luck \xe2\x80\x99em later on. I\r\nwant a place to work first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, crossing the landing. \xe2\x80\x9cThis place is a big\r\nbox room really, but it will do for you. There\xe2\x80\x99s your skylight, or your\r\nnorth light, or whatever window you call it, and plenty of room to\r\nthrash about in, and a bedroom beyond. What more do you need?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, looking round the large room that took up a\r\nthird of a top story in the rickety chambers overlooking the Thames. A\r\npale yellow sun shone through the skylight and showed the much dirt of\r\nthe place. Three steps led from the door to the landing, and three more\r\nto Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s room. The well of the staircase disappeared into\r\ndarkness, pricked by tiny gas-jets, and there were sounds of men\r\ntalking and doors slamming seven flights below, in the warm gloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they give you a free hand here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, cautiously. He was\r\nIshmael enough to know the value of liberty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything you like; latch-keys and license unlimited. We are permanent\r\ntenants for the most part here. \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t a place I would recommend for a\r\nYoung Men\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Association, but it will serve. I took these\r\nrooms for you when I wired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a great deal too kind, old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you were going away from me, did you?\xe2\x80\x9d Torpenhow\r\nput his hand on Dick\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and the two walked up and down the\r\nroom, henceforward to be called the studio, in sweet and silent\r\ncommunion. They heard rapping at Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s door. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s some ruffian\r\ncome up for a drink,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow; and he raised his voice cheerily.\r\nThere entered no one more ruffianly than a portly middle-aged gentleman\r\nin a satin-faced frockcoat. His lips were parted and pale, and there\r\nwere deep pouches under the eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeak heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick to himself, and, as he shook hands, \xe2\x80\x9cvery weak\r\nheart. His pulse is shaking his fingers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man introduced himself as the head of the Central Southern\r\nSyndicate and \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most ardent admirers of your work, Mr.\r\nHeldar. I assure you, in the name of the syndicate, that we are\r\nimmensely indebted to you; and I trust, Mr. Heldar, you won\xe2\x80\x99t forget\r\nthat we were largely instrumental in bringing you before the public.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe panted because of the seven flights of stairs.\r\n\r\nDick glanced at Torpenhow, whose left eyelid lay for a moment dead on\r\nhis cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t forget,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, every instinct of defence roused in him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve paid me so well that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, you know. By the way, when I\r\nam settled in this place I should like to send and get my sketches.\r\nThere must be nearly a hundred and fifty of them with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is er\xe2\x80\x94is what I came to speak about. I fear we can\xe2\x80\x99t allow it\r\nexactly, Mr. Heldar. In the absence of any specified agreement, the\r\nsketches are our property, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that you are going to keep them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and we hope to have your help, on your own terms, Mr. Heldar, to\r\nassist us in arranging a little exhibition, which, backed by our name\r\nand the influence we naturally command among the press, should be of\r\nmaterial service to you. Sketches such as yours\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelong to me. You engaged me by wire, you paid me the lowest rates you\r\ndared. You can\xe2\x80\x99t mean to keep them! Good God alive, man, they\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow watched Dick\xe2\x80\x99s face and whistled.\r\n\r\nDick walked up and down, thinking. He saw the whole of his little stock\r\nin trade, the first weapon of his equipment, annexed at the outset of\r\nhis campaign by an elderly gentleman whose name Dick had not caught\r\naright, who said that he represented a syndicate, which was a thing for\r\nwhich Dick had not the least reverence. The injustice of the\r\nproceedings did not much move him; he had seen the strong hand prevail\r\ntoo often in other places to be squeamish over the moral aspects of\r\nright and wrong.\r\n\r\nBut he ardently desired the blood of the gentleman in the frockcoat,\r\nand when he spoke again, and when he spoke again it was with a strained\r\nsweetness that Torpenhow knew well for the beginning of strife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, sir, but you have no\xe2\x80\x94no younger man who can arrange this\r\nbusiness with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak for the syndicate. I see no reason for a third party to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will in a minute. Be good enough to give back my sketches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man stared blankly at Dick, and then at Torpenhow, who was leaning\r\nagainst the wall. He was not used to ex-employees who ordered him to be\r\ngood enough to do things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is rather a cold-blooded steal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, critically;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, I am very much afraid, you\xe2\x80\x99ve struck the wrong man. Be\r\ncareful, Dick; remember, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the Soudan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsidering what services the syndicate have done you in putting your\r\nname before the world\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was not a fortunate remark; it reminded Dick of certain vagrant\r\nyears lived out in loneliness and strife and unsatisfied desires. The\r\nmemory did not contrast well with the prosperous gentleman who proposed\r\nto enjoy the fruit of those years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know quite what to do with you,\xe2\x80\x9d began Dick, meditatively. \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse you\xe2\x80\x99re a thief, and you ought to be half killed, but in your\r\ncase you\xe2\x80\x99d probably die. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you dead on this floor, and,\r\nbesides, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlucky just as one\xe2\x80\x99s moving in. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hit, sir; you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nonly excite yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put one hand on the man\xe2\x80\x99s forearm and ran the other down the plump\r\nbody beneath the coat. \xe2\x80\x9cMy goodness!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Torpenhow, \xe2\x80\x9cand this\r\ngray oaf dares to be a thief! I have seen an Esneh camel-driver have\r\nthe black hide taken off his body in strips for stealing half a pound\r\nof wet dates, and _he_ was as tough as whipcord. This things\xe2\x80\x99 soft all\r\nover\xe2\x80\x94like a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere are few things more poignantly humiliating than being handled by\r\na man who does not intend to strike. The head of the syndicate began to\r\nbreathe heavily. Dick walked round him, pawing him, as a cat paws a\r\nsoft hearth-rug. Then he traced with his forefinger the leaden pouches\r\nunderneath the eyes, and shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were going to steal my\r\nthings,\xe2\x80\x94mine, mine, mine!\xe2\x80\x94you, who don\xe2\x80\x99t know when you may die. Write a\r\nnote to your office,\xe2\x80\x94you say you\xe2\x80\x99re the head of it,\xe2\x80\x94and order them to\r\ngive Torpenhow my sketches,\xe2\x80\x94every one of them. Wait a minute: your\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x99s shaking. Now!\xe2\x80\x9d He thrust a pocket-book before him. The note was\r\nwritten. Torpenhow took it and departed without a word, while Dick\r\nwalked round and round the spellbound captive, giving him such advice\r\nas he conceived best for the welfare of his soul. When Torpenhow\r\nreturned with a gigantic portfolio, he heard Dick say, almost\r\nsoothingly, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I hope this will be a lesson to you; and if you worry\r\nme when I have settled down to work with any nonsense about actions for\r\nassault, believe me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch you and manhandle you, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll die.\r\nYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t very long to live, anyhow. Go! _Imshi, Vootsak_,\xe2\x80\x94get out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe man departed, staggering and dazed. Dick drew a long breath: \xe2\x80\x9cPhew!\r\nwhat a lawless lot these people are! The first thing a poor orphan\r\nmeets is gang robbery, organised burglary! Think of the hideous\r\nblackness of that man\xe2\x80\x99s mind! Are my sketches all right, Torp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; one hundred and forty-seven of them. Well, I _must_ say, Dick,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve begun well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was interfering with me. It only meant a few pounds to him, but it\r\nwas everything to me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99ll bring an action. I gave him\r\nsome medical advice gratis about the state of his body. It was cheap at\r\nthe little flurry it cost him. Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at my things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later Dick had thrown himself down on the floor and was\r\ndeep in the portfolio, chuckling lovingly as he turned the drawings\r\nover and thought of the price at which they had been bought.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was well advanced when Torpenhow came to the door and saw\r\nDick dancing a wild saraband under the skylight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI builded better than I knew, Torp,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without stopping the\r\ndance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re good! They\xe2\x80\x99re damned good! They\xe2\x80\x99ll go like flame! I shall have\r\nan exhibition of them on my own brazen hook. And that man would have\r\ncheated me out of it! Do you know that I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry now that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nactually hit him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cgo out and pray to be delivered from the sin\r\nof arrogance, which you never will be. Bring your things up from\r\nwhatever place you\xe2\x80\x99re staying in, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to make this barn a\r\nlittle more shipshape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then\xe2\x80\x94oh, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, still capering, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will spoil the\r\nEgyptians!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wolf-cub at even lay hid in the corn,\r\n    When the smoke of the cooking hung gray:\r\nHe knew where the doe made a couch for her fawn,\r\n    And he looked to his strength for his prey.\r\n    But the moon swept the smoke-wreaths away.\r\nAnd he turned from his meal in the villager\xe2\x80\x99s close,\r\nAnd he bayed to the moon as she rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_In Seonee_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and how does success taste?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, some three months\r\nlater. He had just returned to chambers after a holiday in the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, as he sat licking his lips before the easel in the\r\nstudio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want more,\xe2\x80\x94heaps more. The lean years have passed, and I approve of\r\nthese fat ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful, old man. That way lies bad work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow was sprawling in a long chair with a small fox-terrier asleep\r\non his chest, while Dick was preparing a canvas. A dais, a background,\r\nand a lay-figure were the only fixed objects in the place. They rose\r\nfrom a wreck of oddments that began with felt-covered water-bottles,\r\nbelts, and regimental badges, and ended with a small bale of\r\nsecond-hand uniforms and a stand of mixed arms. The mark of muddy feet\r\non the dais showed that a military model had just gone away. The watery\r\nautumn sunlight was falling, and shadows sat in the corners of the\r\nstudio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, deliberately, \xe2\x80\x9cI like the power; I like the fun; I\r\nlike the fuss; and above all I like the money. I almost like the people\r\nwho make the fuss and pay the money. Almost. But they\xe2\x80\x99re a queer\r\ngang,\xe2\x80\x94an amazingly queer gang!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have been good enough to you, at any rate. That tin-pot\r\nexhibition of your sketches must have paid. Did you see that the papers\r\ncalled it the \xe2\x80\x98Wild Work Show\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. I sold every shred of canvas I wanted to; and, on my word,\r\nI believe it was because they believed I was a self-taught flagstone\r\nartist.\r\n\r\nI should have got better prices if I worked my things on wool or\r\nscratched them on camel-bone instead of using mere black and white and\r\ncolour. Verily, they are a queer gang, these people. Limited isn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nword to describe \xe2\x80\x99em. I met a fellow the other day who told me that it\r\nwas impossible that shadows on white sand should be\r\nblue,\xe2\x80\x94ultramarine,\xe2\x80\x94as they are. I found out, later, that the man had\r\nbeen as far as Brighton beach; but he knew all about Art, confound him.\r\nHe gave me a lecture on it, and recommended me to go to school to learn\r\ntechnique. I wonder what old Kami would have said to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen were you under Kami, man of extraordinary beginnings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI studied with him for two years in Paris. He taught by personal\r\nmagnetism. All he ever said was, \xe2\x80\x98_Continuez, mes enfants_,\xe2\x80\x99 and you\r\nhad to make the best you could of that. He had a divine touch, and he\r\nknew something about colour. Kami used to dream colour; I swear he\r\ncould never have seen the genuine article; but he evolved it; and it\r\nwas good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecollect some of those views in the Soudan?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, with a\r\nprovoking drawl.\r\n\r\nDick squirmed in his place. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t! It makes me want to get out there\r\nagain. What colour that was! Opal and umber and amber and claret and\r\nbrick-red and sulphur\xe2\x80\x94cockatoo-crest\xe2\x80\x94sulphur\xe2\x80\x94against brown, with a\r\nnigger-black rock sticking up in the middle of it all, and a decorative\r\nfrieze of camels festooning in front of a pure pale turquoise sky.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nbegan to walk up and down. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, you know, if you try to give these\r\npeople the thing as God gave it, keyed down to their comprehension and\r\naccording to the powers He has given you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cModest man! Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf a dozen epicene young pagans who haven\xe2\x80\x99t even been to Algiers\r\nwill tell you, first, that your notion is borrowed, and, secondly, that\r\nit isn\xe2\x80\x99t Art.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99This comes of my leaving town for a month. Dickie, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\npromenading among the toy-shops and hearing people talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, penitently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou weren\xe2\x80\x99t here, and it\r\nwas lonely these long evenings. A man can\xe2\x80\x99t work for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man might have gone to a pub, and got decently drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had; but I forgathered with some men of sorts. They said they\r\nwere artists, and I knew some of them could draw,\xe2\x80\x94but they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndraw. They gave me tea,\xe2\x80\x94tea at five in the afternoon!\xe2\x80\x94and talked about\r\nArt and the state of their souls. As if their souls mattered. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheard more about Art and seen less of her in the last six months than\r\nin the whole of my life. Do you remember Cassavetti, who worked for\r\nsome continental syndicate, out with the desert column? He was a\r\nregular Christmas-tree of contraptions when he took the field in full\r\nfig, with his water-bottle, lanyard, revolver, writing-case, housewife,\r\ngig-lamps, and the Lord knows what all. He used to fiddle about with\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em and show us how they worked; but he never seemed to do much except\r\nfudge his reports from the Nilghai. See?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear old Nilghai! He\xe2\x80\x99s in town, fatter than ever. He ought to be up\r\nhere this evening. I see the comparison perfectly. You should have kept\r\nclear of all that man-millinery. Serves you right; and I hope it will\r\nunsettle your mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t. It has taught me what Art\xe2\x80\x94holy sacred Art\xe2\x80\x94means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt something while I\xe2\x80\x99ve been away. What is Art?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive \xe2\x80\x99em what they know, and when you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it once do it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick dragged forward a canvas laid face to the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a sample\r\nof real Art. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a facsimile reproduction for a weekly. I\r\ncalled it \xe2\x80\x9cHis Last Shot.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s worked up from the little water-colour\r\nI made outside El Maghrib. Well, I lured my model, a beautiful\r\nrifleman, up here with drink; I drored him, and I redrored him, and I\r\nredrored him, and I made him a flushed, dishevelled, bedevilled\r\nscallawag, with his helmet at the back of his head, and the living fear\r\nof death in his eye, and the blood oozing out of a cut over his\r\nankle-bone. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pretty, but he was all soldier and very much\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more, modest child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s only to you I\xe2\x80\x99m talking. I did him just as\r\nwell as I knew how, making allowance for the slickness of oils. Then\r\nthe art-manager of that abandoned paper said that his subscribers\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it. It was brutal and coarse and violent,\xe2\x80\x94man being\r\nnaturally gentle when he\xe2\x80\x99s fighting for his life. They wanted something\r\nmore restful, with a little more colour. I could have said a good deal,\r\nbut you might as well talk to a sheep as an art-manager. I took my\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast Shot\xe2\x80\x9d back. Behold the result! I put him into a lovely red coat\r\nwithout a speck on it. That is Art. I polished his boots,\xe2\x80\x94observe the\r\nhigh light on the toe. That is Art. I cleaned his rifle,\xe2\x80\x94rifles are\r\nalways clean on service,\xe2\x80\x94because that is Art.\r\n\r\nI pipeclayed his helmet,\xe2\x80\x94pipeclay is always used on active service, and\r\nis indispensable to Art. I shaved his chin, I washed his hands, and\r\ngave him an air of fatted peace. Result, military tailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npattern-plate. Price, thank Heaven, twice as much as for the first\r\nsketch, which was moderately decent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re going to give that thing out as your work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? I did it. Alone I did it, in the interests of sacred,\r\nhome-bred Art and _Dickenson\xe2\x80\x99s Weekly_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow smoked in silence for a while. Then came the verdict,\r\ndelivered from rolling clouds: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were only a mass of blathering\r\nvanity, Dick, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d let you go to the deuce on your own\r\nmahl-stick; but when I consider what you are to me, and when I find\r\nthat to vanity you add the twopenny-halfpenny pique of a\r\ntwelve-year-old girl, then I bestir myself in your behalf. Thus!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe canvas ripped as Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s booted foot shot through it, and the\r\nterrier jumped down, thinking rats were about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have any bad language to use, use it. You have not. I continue.\r\n\r\nYou are an idiot, because no man born of woman is strong enough to take\r\nliberties with his public, even though they be\xe2\x80\x94which they ain\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94all you\r\nsay they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they don\xe2\x80\x99t know any better. What can you expect from creatures\r\nborn and bred in this light?\xe2\x80\x9d Dick pointed to the yellow fog. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they\r\nwant furniture-polish, let them have furniture-polish, so long as they\r\npay for it.\r\n\r\nThey are only men and women. You talk as if they were gods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds very fine, but it has nothing to do with the case. They\r\nare the people you have to do work for, whether you like it or not.\r\nThey are your masters. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be deceived, Dickie, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t strong\r\nenough to trifle with them,\xe2\x80\x94or with yourself, which is more important.\r\n\r\nMoreover,\xe2\x80\x94Come back, Binkie: that red daub isn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere,\xe2\x80\x94unless\r\nyou take precious good care, you will fall under the damnation of the\r\ncheck-book, and that\xe2\x80\x99s worse than death. You will get drunk\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re half\r\ndrunk already\xe2\x80\x94on easily acquired money. For that money and your own\r\ninfernal vanity you are willing to deliberately turn out bad work.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll do quite enough bad work without knowing it. And, Dickie, as I\r\nlove you and as I know you love me, I am not going to let you cut off\r\nyour nose to spite your face for all the gold in England. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsettled. Now swear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know, said Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to make myself angry, but I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t, you\xe2\x80\x99re so abominably reasonable. There will be a row on\r\n_Dickenson\xe2\x80\x99s Weekly_, I fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the Dickenson do you want to work on a weekly paper? It\xe2\x80\x99s slow\r\nbleeding of power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt brings in the very desirable dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, his hands in his\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow watched him with large contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I thought it was a\r\nman!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, wheeling quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve no notion what the\r\ncertainty of cash means to a man who has always wanted it badly.\r\n\r\nNothing will pay me for some of my life\xe2\x80\x99s joys; on that Chinese\r\npig-boat, for instance, when we ate bread and jam for every meal,\r\nbecause Ho-Wang wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow us anything better, and it all tasted of\r\npig,\xe2\x80\x94Chinese pig. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked for this, I\xe2\x80\x99ve sweated and I\xe2\x80\x99ve starved\r\nfor this, line on line and month after month. And now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it I am\r\ngoing to make the most of it while it lasts. Let them pay\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nknowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does Your Majesty please to want? You can\xe2\x80\x99t smoke more than you\r\ndo; you won\xe2\x80\x99t drink; you\xe2\x80\x99re a gross feeder; and you dress in the dark,\r\nby the look of you. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep a horse the other day when I\r\nsuggested, because, you said, it might fall lame, and whenever you\r\ncross the street you take a hansom. Even you are not foolish enough to\r\nsuppose that theatres and all the live things you can buy thereabouts\r\nmean Life.\r\n\r\nWhat earthly need have you for money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s there, bless its golden heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s there all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nProvidence has sent me nuts while I have teeth to crack \xe2\x80\x99em with. I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t yet found the nut I wish to crack, but I\xe2\x80\x99m keeping my teeth\r\nfiled.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some day you and I will go for a walk round the wide earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith no work to do, nobody to worry us, and nobody to compete with?\r\nYou would be unfit to speak to in a week. Besides, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care to profit by the price of a man\xe2\x80\x99s soul,\xe2\x80\x94for that\xe2\x80\x99s what it\r\nwould mean.\r\n\r\nDick, it\xe2\x80\x99s no use arguing. You\xe2\x80\x99re a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t see it. When I was on that Chinese pig-boat, our captain got\r\ncredit for saving about twenty-five thousand very seasick little pigs,\r\nwhen our old tramp of a steamer fell foul of a timber-junk. Now, taking\r\nthose pigs as a parallel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, confound your parallels! Whenever I try to improve your soul, you\r\nalways drag in some anecdote from your very shady past. Pigs aren\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nBritish public; and self-respect is self-respect the world over. Go out\r\nfor a walk and try to catch some self-respect. And, I say, if the\r\nNilghai comes up this evening can I show him your diggings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be asking whether you must knock at my door, next.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nDick departed, to take counsel with himself in the rapidly gathering\r\nLondon fog.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after he had left, the Nilghai laboured up the staircase.\r\nHe was the chiefest, as he was the youngest, of the war correspondents,\r\nand his experiences dated from the birth of the needle-gun. Saving only\r\nhis ally, Keneu the Great War Eagle, there was no man higher in the\r\ncraft than he, and he always opened his conversation with the news that\r\nthere would be trouble in the Balkans in the spring. Torpenhow laughed\r\nas he entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the trouble in the Balkans. Those little states are always\r\nscreeching. You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about Dick\xe2\x80\x99s luck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; he has been called up to notoriety, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he? I hope you keep\r\nhim properly humble. He wants suppressing from time to time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does. He\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to take liberties with what he thinks is his\r\nreputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlready! By Jove, he _has_ cheek! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about his reputation,\r\nbut he\xe2\x80\x99ll come a cropper if he tries that sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I told him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he believes it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey never do when they first start off. What\xe2\x80\x99s that wreck on the\r\nground there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpecimen of his latest impertinence.\xe2\x80\x9d Torpenhow thrust the torn edges\r\nof the canvas together and showed the well-groomed picture to the\r\nNilghai, who looked at it for a moment and whistled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a chromo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca chromo-litholeomargarine fake! What\r\npossessed him to do it? And yet how thoroughly he has caught the note\r\nthat catches a public who think with their boots and read with their\r\nelbows! The cold-blooded insolence of the work almost saves it; but he\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t go on with this. Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he been praised and cockered up too\r\nmuch? You know these people here have no sense of proportion. They\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncall him a second Detaille and a third-hand Meissonier while his\r\nfashion lasts. It\xe2\x80\x99s windy diet for a colt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it affects Dick much. You might as well call a young\r\nwolf a lion and expect him to take the compliment in exchange for a\r\nshin-bone.\r\n\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s soul is in the bank. He\xe2\x80\x99s working for cash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow he has thrown up war work, I suppose he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see that the\r\nobligations of the service are just the same, only the proprietors are\r\nchanged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should he know? He thinks he is his own master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he? I could undeceive him for his good, if there\xe2\x80\x99s any virtue in\r\nprint. He wants the whiplash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLay it on with science, then. I\xe2\x80\x99d flay him myself, but I like him too\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no scruples. He had the audacity to try to cut me out with a\r\nwoman at Cairo once. I forgot that, but I remember now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Did_ he cut you out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see when I have dealt with him. But, after all, what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ngood? Leave him alone and he\xe2\x80\x99ll come home, if he has any stuff in him,\r\ndragging or wagging his tail behind him. There\xe2\x80\x99s more in a week of life\r\nthan in a lively weekly. None the less I\xe2\x80\x99ll slate him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll slate him\r\nponderously in the _Cataclysm_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood luck to you; but I fancy nothing short of a crowbar would make\r\nDick wince. His soul seems to have been fired before we came across\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s intensely suspicious and utterly lawless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatter of temper,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same with horses. Some\r\nyou wallop and they work, some you wallop and they jib, and some you\r\nwallop and they go out for a walk with their hands in their pockets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Dick has done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till he\r\ncomes back. In the meantime, you can begin your slating here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show\r\nyou some of his last and worst work in his studio.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick had instinctively sought running water for a comfort to his mood\r\nof mind. He was leaning over the Embankment wall, watching the rush of\r\nthe Thames through the arches of Westminster Bridge. He began by\r\nthinking of Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s advice, but, as of custom, lost himself in the\r\nstudy of the faces flocking past. Some had death written on their\r\nfeatures, and Dick marvelled that they could laugh. Others, clumsy and\r\ncoarse-built for the most part, were alight with love; others were\r\nmerely drawn and lined with work; but there was something, Dick knew,\r\nto be made out of them all. The poor at least should suffer that he\r\nmight learn, and the rich should pay for the output of his learning.\r\nThus his credit in the world and his cash balance at the bank would be\r\nincreased. So much the better for him. He had suffered. Now he would\r\ntake toll of the ills of others.\r\n\r\nThe fog was driven apart for a moment, and the sun shone, a blood-red\r\nwafer, on the water. Dick watched the spot till he heard the voice of\r\nthe tide between the piers die down like the wash of the sea at low\r\ntide. A girl hard pressed by her lover shouted shamelessly, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, get\r\naway, you beast!\xe2\x80\x9d and a shift of the same wind that had opened the fog\r\ndrove across Dick\xe2\x80\x99s face the black smoke of a river-steamer at her\r\nberth below the wall. He was blinded for the moment, then spun round\r\nand found himself face to face with\xe2\x80\x94Maisie.\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking. The years had turned the child to a woman, but\r\nthey had not altered the dark-gray eyes, the thin scarlet lips, or the\r\nfirmly modelled mouth and chin; and, that all should be as it was of\r\nold, she wore a closely fitting gray dress.\r\n\r\nSince the human soul is finite and not in the least under its own\r\ncommand, Dick, advancing, said \xe2\x80\x9cHalloo!\xe2\x80\x9d after the manner of\r\nschoolboys, and Maisie answered, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dick, is that you?\xe2\x80\x9d Then, against\r\nhis will, and before the brain newly released from considerations of\r\nthe cash balance had time to dictate to the nerves, every pulse of\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s body throbbed furiously and his palate dried in his mouth. The\r\nfog shut down again, and Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s face was pearl-white through it. No\r\nword was spoken, but Dick fell into step at her side, and the two paced\r\nthe Embankment together, keeping the step as perfectly as in their\r\nafternoon excursions to the mud-flats. Then Dick, a little\r\nhoarsely\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened to Amomma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe died, Dick. Not cartridges; over-eating. He was always greedy.\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it funny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. No. Do you mean Amomma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x94es. No. This. Where have you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver there,\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed eastward through the fog. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m in the north,\xe2\x80\x94the black north, across all the Park. I am very\r\nbusy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI paint a great deal. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I have to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s happened? You had three hundred a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have that still. I am painting; that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you alone, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a girl living with me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t walk so fast, Dick; you\xe2\x80\x99re out of\r\nstep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you noticed it too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I did. You\xe2\x80\x99re always out of step.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I am. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. You went on with the painting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. I said I should. I was at the Slade, then at Merton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin_St. John\xe2\x80\x99s Wood_, the big studio, then I pepper-potted,\xe2\x80\x94I mean I\r\nwent to the National,\xe2\x80\x94and now I\xe2\x80\x99m working under Kami.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Kami is in Paris surely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he has his teaching studio in Vitry-sur-Marne. I work with him in\r\nthe summer, and I live in London in the winter. I\xe2\x80\x99m a householder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you sell much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow and again, but not often. There is my \xe2\x80\x9cbus. I must take it or lose\r\nhalf an hour. Good-bye, Dick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Maisie. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me where you live? I must see you\r\nagain; and perhaps I could help you. I\xe2\x80\x94I paint a little myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may be in the Park to-morrow, if there is no working light. I walk\r\nfrom the Marble Arch down and back again; that is my little excursion.\r\nBut of course I shall see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d She stepped into the omnibus and\r\nwas swallowed up by the fog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94am\xe2\x80\x94damned!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Dick, and returned to the chambers.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow and the Nilghai found him sitting on the steps to the studio\r\ndoor, repeating the phrase with an awful gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be more damned when I\xe2\x80\x99m done with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai,\r\nupheaving his bulk from behind Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and waving a sheaf\r\nof half-dry manuscript. \xe2\x80\x9cDick, it is of common report that you are\r\nsuffering from swelled head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloo, Nilghai. Back again? How are the Balkans and all the little\r\nBalkans? One side of your face is out of drawing, as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that. I am commissioned to smite you in print. Torpenhow\r\nrefuses from false delicacy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been overhauling the pot-boilers in\r\nyour studio. They are simply disgraceful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho! that\xe2\x80\x99s it, is it? If you think you can slate me, you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong.\r\nYou can only describe, and you need as much room to turn in, on paper,\r\nas a P. and O. cargo-boat. But continue, and be swift. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\nbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m! h\xe2\x80\x99m! h\xe2\x80\x99m! The first part only deals with your pictures. Here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe peroration: \xe2\x80\x9cFor work done without conviction, for power wasted on\r\ntrivialities, for labour expended with levity for the deliberate\r\npurpose of winning the easy applause of a fashion-driven public\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHis Last Shot,\xe2\x80\x9d second edition. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpublic, there remains but one end,\xe2\x80\x94the oblivion that is preceded by\r\ntoleration and cenotaphed with contempt. From that fate Mr. Heldar has\r\nyet to prove himself out of danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Wow\xe2\x80\x94wow\xe2\x80\x94wow\xe2\x80\x94wow\xe2\x80\x94wow!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, profanely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a clumsy ending\r\nand vile journalese, but it\xe2\x80\x99s quite true. And yet,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he sprang to his\r\nfeet and snatched at the manuscript,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou scarred, deboshed, battered\r\nold gladiator! you\xe2\x80\x99re sent out when a war begins, to minister to the\r\nblind, brutal, British public\xe2\x80\x99s bestial thirst for blood. They have no\r\narenas now, but they must have special correspondents. You\xe2\x80\x99re a fat\r\ngladiator who comes up through a trap-door and talks of what he\xe2\x80\x99s seen.\r\nYou stand on precisely the same level as an energetic bishop, an\r\naffable actress, a devastating cyclone, or\xe2\x80\x94mine own sweet self. And you\r\npresume to lecture me about my work! Nilghai, if it were worth while\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d caricature you in four papers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Nilghai winced. He had not thought of this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs it is, I shall take this stuff and tear it small\xe2\x80\x94so!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nmanuscript fluttered in slips down the dark well of the staircase. \xe2\x80\x9cGo\r\nhome, Nilghai,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick; \xe2\x80\x9cgo home to your lonely little bed, and\r\nleave me in peace. I am about to turn in till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t seven yet!\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, with amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be two in the morning, if I choose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, backing to\r\nthe studio door. \xe2\x80\x9cI go to grapple with a serious crisis, and I shan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant any dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door shut and was locked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do with a man like that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave him alone. He\xe2\x80\x99s as mad as a hatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt eleven there was a kicking on the studio door. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the Nilghai with\r\nyou still?\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice from within. \xe2\x80\x9cThen tell him he might have\r\ncondensed the whole of his lumbering nonsense into an epigram: \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\r\nthe free are bond, and only the bond are free.\xe2\x80\x9d Tell him he\xe2\x80\x99s an idiot,\r\nTorp, and tell him I\xe2\x80\x99m another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Come out and have supper. You\xe2\x80\x99re smoking on an empty\r\nstomach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a thousand men,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cTo wait upon my will,\r\nAnd towers nine upon the Tyne,\r\n    And three upon the Till.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what care I for you men,\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOr towers from Tyne to Till,\r\nSith you must go with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cTo wait upon my will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_Sir Hoggie and the Fairies_\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Torpenhow found Dick sunk in deepest repose of tobacco.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, madman, how d\xe2\x80\x99you feel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had much better do some work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe; but I\xe2\x80\x99m in no hurry. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a discovery. Torp, there\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nmuch Ego in my Cosmos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot really! Is this revelation due to my lectures, or the Nilghai\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came to me suddenly, all on my own account. Much too much Ego; and\r\nnow I\xe2\x80\x99m going to work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned over a few half-finished sketches, drummed on a new canvas,\r\ncleaned three brushes, set Binkie to bite the toes of the lay figure,\r\nrattled through his collection of arms and accoutrements, and then went\r\nout abruptly, declaring that he had done enough for the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is positively indecent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, \xe2\x80\x9cand the first time that\r\nDick has ever broken up a light morning. Perhaps he has found out that\r\nhe has a soul, or an artistic temperament, or something equally\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nThat comes of leaving him alone for a month. Perhaps he has been going\r\nout of evenings. I must look to this.\xe2\x80\x9d He rang for the bald-headed old\r\nhousekeeper, whom nothing could astonish or annoy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeeton, did Mr. Heldar dine out at all while I was out of town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever laid \xe2\x80\x99is dress-clothes out once, sir, all the time. Mostly \xe2\x80\x99e\r\ndined in; but \xe2\x80\x99e brought some most remarkable young gentlemen up \xe2\x80\x99ere\r\nafter theatres once or twice. Remarkable fancy they was. You gentlemen\r\non the top floor does very much as you likes, but it do seem to me,\r\nsir, droppin\xe2\x80\x99 a walkin\xe2\x80\x99-stick down five flights o\xe2\x80\x99 stairs an\xe2\x80\x99 then\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99 down four abreast to pick it up again at half-past two in the\r\nmornin\xe2\x80\x99, singin\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Bring back the whiskey, Willie darlin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94not once or\r\ntwice, but scores o\xe2\x80\x99 times,\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t charity to the other tenants. What I\r\nsay is, \xe2\x80\x98Do as you would be done by.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s my motto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course! of course! I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid the top floor isn\xe2\x80\x99t the quietest in\r\nthe house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make no complaints, sir. I have spoke to Mr. Heldar friendly, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nlaughed, an\xe2\x80\x99 did me a picture of the missis that is as good as a\r\ncoloured print. It \xe2\x80\x99asn\xe2\x80\x99t the \xe2\x80\x99igh shine of a photograph, but what I\r\nsay is, \xe2\x80\x98Never look a gift-horse in the mouth.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Heldar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndress-clothes \xe2\x80\x99aven\xe2\x80\x99t been on him for weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cOrgies are healthy,\r\nand Dick has a head of his own, but when it comes to women making eyes\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not so certain,\xe2\x80\x94Binkie, never you be a man, little dorglums.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re contrary brutes, and they do things without any reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick had turned northward across the Park, but he was walking in the\r\nspirit on the mud-flats with Maisie. He laughed aloud as he remembered\r\nthe day when he had decked Amomma\xe2\x80\x99s horns with the ham-frills, and\r\nMaisie, white with rage, had cuffed him. How long those four years\r\nseemed in review, and how closely Maisie was connected with every hour\r\nof them! Storm across the sea, and Maisie in a gray dress on the beach,\r\nsweeping her drenched hair out of her eyes and laughing at the homeward\r\nrace of the fishing-smacks; hot sunshine on the mud-flats, and Maisie\r\nsniffing scornfully, with her chin in the air; Maisie flying before the\r\nwind that threshed the foreshore and drove the sand like small shot\r\nabout her ears; Maisie, very composed and independent, telling lies to\r\nMrs. Jennett while Dick supported her with coarser perjuries; Maisie\r\npicking her way delicately from stone to stone, a pistol in her hand\r\nand her teeth firm-set; and Maisie in a gray dress sitting on the grass\r\nbetween the mouth of a cannon and a nodding yellow sea-poppy. The\r\npictures passed before him one by one, and the last stayed the longest.\r\n\r\nDick was perfectly happy with a quiet peace that was as new to his mind\r\nas it was foreign to his experiences. It never occurred to him that\r\nthere might be other calls upon his time than loafing across the Park\r\nin the forenoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a good working light now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, watching his shadow\r\nplacidly. \xe2\x80\x9cSome poor devil ought to be grateful for this. And there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMaisie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was walking towards him from the Marble Arch, and he saw that no\r\nmannerism of her gait had been changed. It was good to find her still\r\nMaisie, and, so to speak, his next-door neighbour. No greeting passed\r\nbetween them, because there had been none in the old days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing out of your studio at this hour?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, as one\r\nwho was entitled to ask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIdling. Just idling. I got angry with a chin and scraped it out. Then\r\nI left it in a little heap of paint-chips and came away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what palette-knifing means. What was the piccy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fancy head that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come right,\xe2\x80\x94horrid thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like working over scraped paint when I\xe2\x80\x99m doing flesh. The\r\ngrain comes up woolly as the paint dries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if you scrape properly.\xe2\x80\x9d Maisie waved her hand to illustrate her\r\nmethods. There was a dab of paint on the white cuff. Dick laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re as untidy as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat comes well from you. Look at your own cuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, yes! It\xe2\x80\x99s worse than yours. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve much altered\r\nin anything. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see, though.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at Maisie critically. The\r\npale blue haze of an autumn day crept between the tree-trunks of the\r\nPark and made a background for the gray dress, the black velvet toque\r\nabove the black hair, and the resolute profile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing changed. How good it is! D\xe2\x80\x99you remember when I\r\nfastened your hair into the snap of a hand-bag?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie nodded, with a twinkle in her eyes, and turned her full face to\r\nDick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThat mouth is down at the corners a little.\r\n\r\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s been worrying you, Maisie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one but myself. I never seem to get on with my work, and yet I try\r\nhard enough, and Kami says\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_Continuez, mesdemoiselles. Continuez toujours, mes enfants_.\xe2\x80\x99 Kami\r\nis depressing. I beg your pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he says. He told me last summer that I was doing\r\nbetter and he\xe2\x80\x99d let me exhibit this year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in this place, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not. The Salon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fly high.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been beating my wings long enough. Where do you exhibit, Dick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t exhibit. I sell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your line, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you heard?\xe2\x80\x9d Dick\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened. Was this thing possible? He\r\ncast about for some means of conviction. They were not far from the\r\nMarble Arch. \xe2\x80\x9cCome up Oxford Street a little and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA small knot of people stood round a print-shop that Dick knew well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome reproduction of my work inside,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with suppressed\r\ntriumph. Never before had success tasted so sweet upon the tongue. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsee the sort of things I paint. D\xe2\x80\x99you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie looked at the wild whirling rush of a field-battery going into\r\naction under fire. Two artillery-men stood behind her in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve chucked the off lead-\xe2\x80\x99orse\xe2\x80\x99 said one to the other. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99E\xe2\x80\x99s tore\r\nup awful, but they\xe2\x80\x99re makin\xe2\x80\x99 good time with the others. That\r\nlead-driver drives better nor you, Tom. See \xe2\x80\x99ow cunnin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99e\xe2\x80\x99s nursin\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x99is \xe2\x80\x99orse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNumber Three\xe2\x80\x99ll be off the limber, next jolt,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, \xe2\x80\x99e won\xe2\x80\x99t. See \xe2\x80\x99ow \xe2\x80\x99is foot\xe2\x80\x99s braced against the iron? \xe2\x80\x99E\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick watched Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s face and swelled with joy\xe2\x80\x94fine, rank, vulgar\r\ntriumph. She was more interested in the little crowd than in the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nThat was something that she could understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wanted it so! Oh, I did want it so!\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, under her\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe,\xe2\x80\x94all me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, placidly. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at their faces. It hits \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nThey don\xe2\x80\x99t know what makes their eyes and mouths open; but I know. And\r\nI know my work\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I see. Oh, what a thing to have come to one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to one, indeed! I had to go out and look for it. What do you\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call it success. Tell me how you got it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey returned to the Park, and Dick delivered himself of the saga of\r\nhis own doings, with all the arrogance of a young man speaking to a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning he told the tale, the I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99s flashing through the\r\nrecords as telegraph-poles fly past the traveller. Maisie listened and\r\nnodded her head. The histories of strife and privation did not move her\r\na hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth. At the end of each canto he would conclude, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\r\ngave me some notion of handling colour,\xe2\x80\x9d or light, or whatever it might\r\nbe that he had set out to pursue and understand. He led her breathless\r\nacross half the world, speaking as he had never spoken in his life\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAnd in the flood-tide of his exaltation there came upon him a great\r\ndesire to pick up this maiden who nodded her head and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand. Go on,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to pick her up and carry her away with him, because\r\nshe was Maisie, and because she understood, and because she was his\r\nright, and a woman to be desired above all women.\r\n\r\nThen he checked himself abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I took all I wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cand I had to fight for it. Now you tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie\xe2\x80\x99s tale was almost as gray as her dress. It covered years of\r\npatient toil backed by savage pride that would not be broken though\r\ndealers laughed, and fogs delayed work, and Kami was unkind and even\r\nsarcastic, and girls in other studios were painfully polite. It had a\r\nfew bright spots, in pictures accepted at provincial exhibitions, but\r\nit wound up with the oft repeated wail, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you see, Dick, I had no\r\nsuccess, though I worked so hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen pity filled Dick. Even thus had Maisie spoken when she could not\r\nhit the breakwater, half an hour before she had kissed him. And that\r\nhad happened yesterday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe words were shaping themselves of their own accord. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole\r\nthing, lock, stock, and barrel, isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth one big yellow sea-poppy\r\nbelow Fort Keeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie flushed a little. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for you to talk, but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve had the success and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me talk, then. I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll understand. Maisie, dear, it sounds a\r\nbit absurd, but those ten years never existed, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come back\r\nagain. It really is just the same. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see? You\xe2\x80\x99re alone now and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m alone.\r\n\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of worrying? Come to me instead, darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie poked the gravel with her parasol. They were sitting on a bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my work to do, and I\r\nmust do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo it with me, then, dear. I won\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s my work,\xe2\x80\x94mine,\xe2\x80\x94mine,\xe2\x80\x94mine! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been alone all my\r\nlife in myself, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to belong to anybody except myself. I\r\nremember things as well as you do, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count. We were\r\nbabies then, and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was before us. Dick, don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nselfish. I think I see my way to a little success next year. Don\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nit away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, darling. It\xe2\x80\x99s my fault for speaking stupidly. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t expect you to throw up all your life just because I\xe2\x80\x99m back. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo to my own place and wait a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Dick, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to\xe2\x80\x94go\xe2\x80\x94out of\xe2\x80\x94my life, now you\xe2\x80\x99ve just come\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m at your orders; forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick devoured the troubled little\r\nface with his eyes. There was triumph in them, because he could not\r\nconceive that Maisie should refuse sooner or later to love him, since\r\nhe loved her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wrong of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, more slowly than before; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s wrong\r\nand selfish; but, oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so lonely! No, you misunderstand. Now\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you again,\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd, but I want to keep you in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally. We belong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t; but you always understood me, and there is so much in my\r\nwork that you could help me in. You know things and the ways of doing\r\nthings. You must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, I fancy, or else I don\xe2\x80\x99t know myself. Then you won\xe2\x80\x99t care to\r\nlose sight of me altogether, and\xe2\x80\x94you want me to help you in your work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but remember, Dick, nothing will ever come of it. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\r\nfeel so selfish. Can\xe2\x80\x99t things stay as they are? I do want your help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have it. But let\xe2\x80\x99s consider. I must see your pics first, and\r\noverhaul your sketches, and find out about your tendencies. You should\r\nsee what the papers say about my tendencies! Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you good\r\nadvice, and you shall paint according. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that it, Maisie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain there was triumph in Dick\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too good of you,\xe2\x80\x94much too good. Because you are consoling\r\nyourself with what will never happen, and I know that, and yet I want\r\nto keep you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame me later, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going into the matter with my eyes open. Moreover the Queen can do\r\nno wrong. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t your selfishness that impresses me. It\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\naudacity in proposing to make use of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! You\xe2\x80\x99re only Dick,\xe2\x80\x94and a print-shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good: that\xe2\x80\x99s all I am. But, Maisie, you believe, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, that\r\nI love you? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to have any false notions about brothers\r\nand sisters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie looked up for a moment and dropped her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s absurd, but\xe2\x80\x94I believe. I wish I could send you away before you\r\nget angry with me. But\xe2\x80\x94but the girl that lives with me is red-haired,\r\nand an impressionist, and all our notions clash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do ours, I think. Never mind. Three months from to-day we shall be\r\nlaughing at this together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie shook her head mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, and\r\nit will only hurt you more when you find out. Look at my face, Dick,\r\nand tell me what you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stood up and faced each other for a moment. The fog was gathering,\r\nand it stifled the roar of the traffic of London beyond the railings.\r\nDick brought all his painfully acquired knowledge of faces to bear on\r\nthe eyes, mouth, and chin underneath the black velvet toque.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same Maisie, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the same me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve both nice\r\nlittle wills of our own, and one or other of us has to be broken. Now\r\nabout the future. I must come and see your pictures some day,\xe2\x80\x94I suppose\r\nwhen the red-haired girl is on the premises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSundays are my best times. You must come on Sundays. There are such\r\nheaps of things I want to talk about and ask your advice about. Now I\r\nmust get back to work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to find out before next Sunday what I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nmy word for anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you. Good-bye, darling, and bless you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie stole away like a little gray mouse. Dick watched her till she\r\nwas out of sight, but he did not hear her say to herself, very soberly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a wretch,\xe2\x80\x94a horrid, selfish wretch. But it\xe2\x80\x99s Dick, and Dick will\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one has yet explained what actually happens when an irresistible\r\nforce meets the immovable post, though many have thought deeply, even\r\nas Dick thought. He tried to assure himself that Maisie would be led in\r\na few weeks by his mere presence and discourse to a better way of\r\nthinking. Then he remembered much too distinctly her face and all that\r\nwas written on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I know anything of heads,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s everything in that\r\nface but love. I shall have to put that in myself; and that chin and\r\nmouth won\xe2\x80\x99t be won for nothing. But she\xe2\x80\x99s right. She knows what she\r\nwants, and she\xe2\x80\x99s going to get it. What insolence! Me! Of all the people\r\nin the wide world, to use me! But then she\xe2\x80\x99s Maisie. There\xe2\x80\x99s no getting\r\nover that fact; and it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see her again. This business must have\r\nbeen simmering at the back of my head for years.... She\xe2\x80\x99ll use me as I\r\nused Binat at Port Said.\r\n\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s quite right. It will hurt a little. I shall have to see her every\r\nSunday,\xe2\x80\x94like a young man courting a housemaid. She\xe2\x80\x99s sure to come\r\naround; and yet\xe2\x80\x94that mouth isn\xe2\x80\x99t a yielding mouth. I shall be wanting\r\nto kiss her all the time, and I shall have to look at her pictures,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t even know what sort of work she does yet,\xe2\x80\x94and I shall have to\r\ntalk about Art,\xe2\x80\x94Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Art! Therefore, particularly and perpetually,\r\ndamn all varieties of Art. It did me a good turn once, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nmy way. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go home and do some Art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf-way to the studio, Dick was smitten with a terrible thought. The\r\nfigure of a solitary woman in the fog suggested it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s all alone in London, with a red-haired impressionist girl, who\r\nprobably has the digestion of an ostrich. Most red-haired people have.\r\n\r\nMaisie\xe2\x80\x99s a bilious little body. They\xe2\x80\x99ll eat like lone women,\xe2\x80\x94meals at\r\nall hours, and tea with all meals. I remember how the students in Paris\r\nused to pig along. She may fall ill at any minute, and I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be able\r\nto help.\r\n\r\nWhew! this is ten times worse than owning a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow entered the studio at dusk, and looked at Dick with eyes full\r\nof the austere love that springs up between men who have tugged at the\r\nsame oar together and are yoked by custom and use and the intimacies of\r\ntoil. This is a good love, and, since it allows, and even encourages,\r\nstrife, recrimination, and brutal sincerity, does not die, but grows,\r\nand is proof against any absence and evil conduct.\r\n\r\nDick was silent after he handed Torpenhow the filled pipe of council.\r\nHe thought of Maisie and her possible needs. It was a new thing to\r\nthink of anybody but Torpenhow, who could think for himself. Here at\r\nlast was an outlet for that cash balance. He could adorn Maisie\r\nbarbarically with jewelry,\xe2\x80\x94a thick gold necklace round that little\r\nneck, bracelets upon the rounded arms, and rings of price upon her\r\nhands,\xe2\x80\x94the cool, temperate, ringless hands that he had taken between\r\nhis own. It was an absurd thought, for Maisie would not even allow him\r\nto put one ring on one finger, and she would laugh at golden trappings.\r\nIt would be better to sit with her quietly in the dusk, his arm around\r\nher neck and her face on his shoulder, as befitted husband and wife.\r\nTorpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s boots creaked that night, and his strong voice jarred.\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s brows contracted and he murmured an evil word because he had\r\ntaken all his success as a right and part payment for past discomfort,\r\nand now he was checked in his stride by a woman who admitted all the\r\nsuccess and did not instantly care for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, who had made one or two vain attempts\r\nat conversation, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t put your back up by anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve said\r\nlately, have I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! No. How could you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiver out of order?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truly healthy man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know he has a liver. I\xe2\x80\x99m only a bit\r\nworried about things in general. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truly healthy man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know he has a soul. What business have\r\nyou with luxuries of that kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came of itself. Who\xe2\x80\x99s the man that says that we\xe2\x80\x99re all islands\r\nshouting lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s right, whoever he is,\xe2\x80\x94except about the misunderstanding. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink we could misunderstand each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blue smoke curled back from the ceiling in clouds. Then Torpenhow,\r\ninsinuatingly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDick, is it a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe hanged if it\xe2\x80\x99s anything remotely resembling a woman; and if you\r\nbegin to talk like that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hire a red-brick studio with white paint\r\ntrimmings, and begonias and petunias and blue Hungarias to play among\r\nthree-and-sixpenny pot-palms, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll mount all my pics in aniline-dye\r\nplush plasters, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll invite every woman who maunders over what her\r\nguide-books tell her is Art, and you shall receive \xe2\x80\x99em, Torp,\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\nsnuff-brown velvet coat with yellow trousers and an orange tie. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlike that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo thin, Dick. A better man than you once denied with cursing and\r\nswearing. You\xe2\x80\x99ve overdone it, just as he did. It\xe2\x80\x99s no business of mine,\r\nof course, but it\xe2\x80\x99s comforting to think that somewhere under the stars\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s saving up for you a tremendous thrashing. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nfrom heaven or earth, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but it\xe2\x80\x99s bound to come and break\r\nyou up a little. You want hammering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick shivered. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen this island is\r\ndisintegrated, it will call for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall come round the corner and help to disintegrate it some more.\r\n\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re talking nonsense. Come along to a theatre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you may lead a thousand men,\r\n    Nor ever draw the rein,\r\nBut ere ye lead the Faery Queen\r\n    \xe2\x80\x99Twill burst your heart in twain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe has slipped his foot from the stirrup-bar,\r\n    The bridle from his hand,\r\nAnd he is bound by hand and foot\r\n    To the Queen o\xe2\x80\x99 Faery-land.\r\n\r\n_Sir Hoggie and the Fairies_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome weeks later, on a very foggy Sunday, Dick was returning across the\r\nPark to his studio. \xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis evidently the thrashing that\r\nTorp meant. It hurts more than I expected; but the Queen can do no\r\nwrong; and she certainly has some notion of drawing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had just finished a Sunday visit to Maisie,\xe2\x80\x94always under the green\r\neyes of the red-haired impressionist girl, whom he learned to hate at\r\nsight,\xe2\x80\x94and was tingling with a keen sense of shame. Sunday after\r\nSunday, putting on his best clothes, he had walked over to the untidy\r\nhouse north of the Park, first to see Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s pictures, and then to\r\ncriticise and advise upon them as he realised that they were\r\nproductions on which advice would not be wasted. Sunday after Sunday,\r\nand his love grew with each visit, he had been compelled to cram his\r\nheart back from between his lips when it prompted him to kiss Maisie\r\nseveral times and very much indeed. Sunday after Sunday, the head above\r\nthe heart had warned him that Maisie was not yet attainable, and that\r\nit would be better to talk as connectedly as possible upon the\r\nmysteries of the craft that was all in all to her. Therefore it was his\r\nfate to endure weekly torture in the studio built out over the clammy\r\nback garden of a frail stuffy little villa where nothing was ever in\r\nits right place and nobody every called,\xe2\x80\x94to endure and to watch Maisie\r\nmoving to and fro with the teacups. He abhorred tea, but, since it gave\r\nhim a little longer time in her presence, he drank it devoutly, and the\r\nred-haired girl sat in an untidy heap and eyed him without speaking.\r\nShe was always watching him.\r\n\r\nOnce, and only once, when she had left the studio, Maisie showed him an\r\nalbum that held a few poor cuttings from provincial papers,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nbriefest of hurried notes on some of her pictures sent to outlying\r\nexhibitions. Dick stooped and kissed the paint-smudged thumb on the\r\nopen page. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my love, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you value these\r\nthings? Chuck \xe2\x80\x99em into the waste-paper basket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot till I get something better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, shutting the book.\r\n\r\nThen Dick, moved by no respect for his public and a very deep regard\r\nfor the maiden, did deliberately propose, in order to secure more of\r\nthese coveted cuttings, that he should paint a picture which Maisie\r\nshould sign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s childish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, \xe2\x80\x9cand I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it of you. It must\r\nbe my work. Mine,\xe2\x80\x94mine,\xe2\x80\x94mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and design decorative medallions for rich brewers\xe2\x80\x99 houses. You are\r\nthoroughly good at that.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick was sick and savage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter things than medallions, Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, in tones that\r\nrecalled a gray-eyed atom\xe2\x80\x99s fearless speech to Mrs. Jennett. Dick would\r\nhave abased himself utterly, but that other girl trailed in.\r\n\r\nNext Sunday he laid at Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s feet small gifts of pencils that could\r\nalmost draw of themselves and colours in whose permanence he believed,\r\nand he was ostentatiously attentive to the work in hand. It demanded,\r\namong other things, an exposition of the faith that was in him.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s hair would have stood on end had he heard the fluency with\r\nwhich Dick preached his own gospel of Art.\r\n\r\nA month before, Dick would have been equally astonished; but it was\r\nMaisie\xe2\x80\x99s will and pleasure, and he dragged his words together to make\r\nplain to her comprehension all that had been hidden to himself of the\r\nwhys and wherefores of work. There is not the least difficulty in doing\r\na thing if you only know how to do it; the trouble is to explain your\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could put this right if I had a brush in my hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick,\r\ndespairingly, over the modelling of a chin that Maisie complained would\r\nnot \xe2\x80\x9clook flesh,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it was the same chin that she had scraped out with\r\nthe palette knife,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut I find it almost impossible to teach you.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a queer grim, Dutch touch about your painting that I like; but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve a notion that you\xe2\x80\x99re weak in drawing. You foreshorten as though\r\nyou never used the model, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve caught Kami\xe2\x80\x99s pasty way of dealing\r\nwith flesh in shadow. Then, again, though you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it yourself,\r\nyou shirk hard work. Suppose you spend some of your time on line alone.\r\nLine doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow of shirking. Oils do, and three square inches of\r\nflashy, tricky stuff in the corner of a pic sometimes carry a bad thing\r\noff,\xe2\x80\x94as I know. That\xe2\x80\x99s immoral. Do line-work for a little while, and\r\nthen I can tell more about your powers, as old Kami used to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie protested; she did not care for the pure line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to do your fancy heads with a bunch of\r\nflowers at the base of the neck to hide bad modelling.\xe2\x80\x9d The red-haired\r\ngirl laughed a little. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to do landscapes with cattle knee-deep\r\nin grass to hide bad drawing. You want to do a great deal more than you\r\ncan do. You have sense of colour, but you want form. Colour\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngift,\xe2\x80\x94put it aside and think no more about it,\xe2\x80\x94but form you can be\r\ndrilled into.\r\n\r\nNow, all your fancy heads\xe2\x80\x94and some of them are very good\xe2\x80\x94will keep you\r\nexactly where you are. With line you must go forward or backward, and\r\nit will show up all your weaknesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut other people\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Maisie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t mind what other people do. If their souls were your soul,\r\nit would be different. You stand and fall by your own work, remember,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s waste of time to think of any one else in this battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick paused, and the longing that had been so resolutely put away came\r\nback into his eyes. He looked at Maisie, and the look asked as plainly\r\nas words, Was it not time to leave all this barren wilderness of canvas\r\nand counsel and join hands with Life and Love?\r\n\r\nMaisie assented to the new programme of schooling so adorably that Dick\r\ncould hardly restrain himself from picking her up then and there and\r\ncarrying her off to the nearest registrar\xe2\x80\x99s office. It was the implicit\r\nobedience to the spoken word and the blank indifference to the unspoken\r\ndesire that baffled and buffeted his soul. He held authority in that\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x94authority limited, indeed, to one-half of one afternoon in\r\nseven, but very real while it lasted. Maisie had learned to appeal to\r\nhim on many subjects, from the proper packing of pictures to the\r\ncondition of a smoky chimney. The red-haired girl never consulted him\r\nabout anything.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, she accepted his appearances without protest, and\r\nwatched him always. He discovered that the meals of the establishment\r\nwere irregular and fragmentary. They depended chiefly on tea, pickles,\r\nand biscuit, as he had suspected from the beginning. The girls were\r\nsupposed to market week and week about, but they lived, with the help\r\nof a charwoman, as casually as the young ravens. Maisie spent most of\r\nher income on models, and the other girl revelled in apparatus as\r\nrefined as her work was rough. Armed with knowledge, dear-bought from\r\nthe Docks, Dick warned Maisie that the end of semi-starvation meant the\r\ncrippling of power to work, which was considerably worse than death.\r\n\r\nMaisie took the warning, and gave more thought to what she ate and\r\ndrank. When his trouble returned upon him, as it generally did in the\r\nlong winter twilights, the remembrance of that little act of domestic\r\nauthority and his coercion with a hearth-brush of the smoky\r\ndrawing-room chimney stung Dick like a whip-lash.\r\n\r\nHe conceived that this memory would be the extreme of his sufferings,\r\ntill one Sunday, the red-haired girl announced that she would make a\r\nstudy of Dick\xe2\x80\x99s head, and that he would be good enough to sit still,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94quite as an afterthought\xe2\x80\x94look at Maisie. He sat, because he could\r\nnot well refuse, and for the space of half an hour he reflected on all\r\nthe people in the past whom he had laid open for the purposes of his\r\nown craft. He remembered Binat most distinctly,\xe2\x80\x94that Binat who had once\r\nbeen an artist and talked about degradation.\r\n\r\nIt was the merest monochrome roughing in of a head, but it presented\r\nthe dumb waiting, the longing, and, above all, the hopeless enslavement\r\nof the man, in a spirit of bitter mockery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll buy it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, promptly, \xe2\x80\x9cat your own price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy price is too high, but I dare say you\xe2\x80\x99ll be as grateful if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nwet sketch, fluttered from the girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand and fell into the ashes of\r\nthe studio stove. When she picked it up it was hopelessly smudged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all spoiled!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I never saw it. Was it like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick under his breath to the red-haired girl, and he\r\nremoved himself swiftly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow that man hates me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how he loves you, Maisie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense? I knew Dick\xe2\x80\x99s very fond of me, but he had his work to\r\ndo, and I have mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is fond of you, and I think he knows there is something in\r\nimpressionism, after all. Maisie, can\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee? See what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing; only, I know that if I could get any man to look at me as\r\nthat man looks at you, I\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99d do. But he hates me.\r\nOh, how he hates me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was not altogether correct. Dick\xe2\x80\x99s hatred was tempered with\r\ngratitude for a few moments, and then he forgot the girl entirely. Only\r\nthe sense of shame remained, and he was nursing it across the Park in\r\nthe fog. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be an explosion one of these days,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nwrathfully. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s fault; she\xe2\x80\x99s right, quite right, as\r\nfar as she knows, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t blame her. This business has been going\r\non for three months nearly.\r\n\r\nThree months!\xe2\x80\x94and it cost me ten years\xe2\x80\x99 knocking about to get at the\r\nnotion, the merest raw notion, of my work. That\xe2\x80\x99s true; but then I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t have pins, drawing-pins, and palette-knives, stuck into me every\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\nOh, my little darling, if ever I break you, somebody will have a very\r\nbad time of it. No, she won\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99d be as big a fool about her as I am\r\nnow. I\xe2\x80\x99ll poison that red-haired girl on my wedding-day,\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunwholesome,\xe2\x80\x94and now I\xe2\x80\x99ll pass on these present bad times to Torp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow had been moved to lecture Dick more than once lately on the\r\nsin of levity, and Dick had listened and replied not a word. In the\r\nweeks between the first few Sundays of his discipline he had flung\r\nhimself savagely into his work, resolved that Maisie should at least\r\nknow the full stretch of his powers. Then he had taught Maisie that she\r\nmust not pay the least attention to any work outside her own, and\r\nMaisie had obeyed him all too well. She took his counsels, but was not\r\ninterested in his pictures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour things smell of tobacco and blood,\xe2\x80\x9d she said once. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you do\r\nanything except soldiers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could do a head of you that would startle you,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Dick,\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nwas before the red-haired girl had brought him under the\r\nguillotine,\xe2\x80\x94but he only said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d and harrowed\r\nTorpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s soul that evening with blasphemies against Art. Later,\r\ninsensibly and to a large extent against his own will, he ceased to\r\ninterest himself in his own work.\r\n\r\nFor Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and to soothe the self-respect that it seemed to him\r\nhe lost each Sunday, he would not consciously turn out bad stuff, but,\r\nsince Maisie did not care even for his best, it were better not to do\r\nanything at all save wait and mark time between Sunday and Sunday.\r\nTorpenhow was disgusted as the weeks went by fruitless, and then\r\nattacked him one Sunday evening when Dick felt utterly exhausted after\r\nthree hours\xe2\x80\x99 biting self-restraint in Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s presence. There was\r\nLanguage, and Torpenhow withdrew to consult the Nilghai, who had come\r\nin to talk continental politics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBone-idle, is he? Careless, and touched in the temper?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nNilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth worrying over. Dick is probably playing the fool with a\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that bad enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. She may throw him out of gear and knock his work to pieces for a\r\nwhile. She may even turn up here some day and make a scene on the\r\nstaircase: one never knows. But until Dick speaks of his own accord you\r\nhad better not touch him. He is no easy-tempered man to handle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I wish he were. He is such an aggressive, cocksure, you-be-damned\r\nfellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll get that knocked out of him in time. He must learn that he can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstorm up and down the world with a box of moist tubes and a slick\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re fond of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d take any punishment that\xe2\x80\x99s in store for him if I could; but the\r\nworst of it is, no man can save his brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, and the worser of it is, there is no discharge in this war. Dick\r\nmust learn his lesson like the rest of us. Talking of war, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\ntrouble in the Balkans in the spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat trouble is long coming. I wonder if we could drag Dick out there\r\nwhen it comes off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick entered the room soon afterwards, and the question was put to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot good enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m too comf\xe2\x80\x99y where I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you aren\xe2\x80\x99t taking all the stuff in the papers seriously?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Nilghai. \xe2\x80\x9cYour vogue will be ended in less than six months,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npublic will know your touch and go on to something new,\xe2\x80\x94and where will\r\nyou be then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you might be doing decent work among us out there? Nonsense! I\r\nshall go, the Keneu will be there, Torp will be there, Cassavetti will\r\nbe there, and the whole lot of us will be there, and we shall have as\r\nmuch as ever we can do, with unlimited fighting and the chance for you\r\nof seeing things that would make the reputation of three\r\nVerestchagins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, pulling at his pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at\r\nyour pictures? Just think how full an average man\xe2\x80\x99s life is of his own\r\npursuits and pleasures. When twenty thousand of him find time to look\r\nup between mouthfuls and grunt something about something they aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe least interested in, the net result is called fame, reputation, or\r\nnotoriety, according to the taste and fancy of the speller my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that as well as you do. Give me credit for a little gumption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe hanged if I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Be_ hanged, then; you probably will be,\xe2\x80\x94for a spy, by excited Turks.\r\nHeigh-ho! I\xe2\x80\x99m weary, dead weary, and virtue has gone out of me.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick\r\ndropped into a chair, and was fast asleep in a minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a bad sign,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai, in an undertone.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow picked the pipe from the waistcoat where it was beginning to\r\nburn, and put a pillow behind the head. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t help; we can\xe2\x80\x99t help,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good ugly sort of old cocoanut, and I\xe2\x80\x99m fond of it.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s the scar of the wipe he got when he was cut over in the\r\nsquare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if that has made him a trifle mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should. He\xe2\x80\x99s a most businesslike madman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Dick began to snore furiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, here, no affection can stand this sort of thing. Wake up, Dick,\r\nand go and sleep somewhere else, if you intend to make a noise about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a cat has been out on the tiles all night,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai, in\r\nhis beard, \xe2\x80\x9cI notice that she usually sleeps all day. This is natural\r\nhistory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick staggered away rubbing his eyes and yawning. In the night-watches\r\nhe was overtaken with an idea, so simple and so luminous that he\r\nwondered he had never conceived it before. It was full of craft. He\r\nwould seek Maisie on a week-day,\xe2\x80\x94would suggest an excursion, and would\r\ntake her by train to Fort Keeling, over the very ground that they two\r\nhad trodden together ten years ago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a general rule,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained to his chin-lathered reflection in\r\nthe morning, \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\xe2\x80\x99t safe to cross an old trail twice. Things remind\r\none of things, and a cold wind gets up, and you feel sad; but this is\r\nan exception to every rule that ever was. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Maisie at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFortunately, the red-haired girl was out shopping when he arrived, and\r\nMaisie in a paint-spattered blouse was warring with her canvas. She was\r\nnot pleased to see him; for week-day visits were a stretch of the bond;\r\nand it needed all his courage to explain his errand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working too hard,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, with an air of\r\nauthority. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do that, you\xe2\x80\x99ll break down. You had much better\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, wearily. She had been standing before her easel\r\ntoo long, and was very tired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere you please. We\xe2\x80\x99ll take a train to-morrow and see where it\r\nstops. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have lunch somewhere, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you back in the\r\nevening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s a good working light to-morrow, I lose a day.\xe2\x80\x9d Maisie\r\nbalanced the heavy white chestnut palette irresolutely.\r\n\r\nDick bit back an oath that was hurrying to his lips. He had not yet\r\nlearned patience with the maiden to whom her work was all in all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll lose ever so many more, dear, if you use every hour of working\r\nlight. Overwork\xe2\x80\x99s only murderous idleness. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be unreasonable. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncall for you to-morrow after breakfast early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you are going to ask\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not. I want you and nobody else. Besides, she hates me as\r\nmuch as I hate her. She won\xe2\x80\x99t care to come. To-morrow, then; and pray\r\nthat we get sunshine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick went away delighted, and by consequence did no work whatever.\r\n\r\nHe strangled a wild desire to order a special train, but bought a great\r\ngray kangaroo cloak lined with glossy black marten, and then retired\r\ninto himself to consider things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going out for the day to-morrow with Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie to the\r\nred-haired girl when the latter returned, tired, from marketing in the\r\nEdgware road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe deserves it. I shall have the studio floor thoroughly scrubbed\r\nwhile you\xe2\x80\x99re away. It\xe2\x80\x99s very dirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie had enjoyed no sort of holiday for months and looked forward to\r\nthe little excitement, but not without misgivings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody nicer than Dick when he talks sensibly, she thought,\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll be silly and worry me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell him\r\nanything he\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear. If he\xe2\x80\x99d only be sensible, I should like him\r\nso much better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were full of joy when he made his appearance next morning\r\nand saw Maisie, gray-ulstered and black-velvet-hatted, standing in the\r\nhallway. Palaces of marble, and not sordid imitation of grained wood,\r\nwere surely the fittest background for such a divinity. The red-haired\r\ngirl drew her into the studio for a moment and kissed her hurriedly.\r\n\r\nMaisie\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows climbed to the top of her forehead; she was\r\naltogether unused to these demonstrations. \xe2\x80\x9cMind my hat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nhurrying away, and ran down the steps to Dick waiting by the hansom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite warm enough! Are you sure you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like some more\r\nbreakfast? Put the cloak over you knees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite comf\xe2\x80\x99y, thanks. Where are we going, Dick? Oh, do stop\r\nsinging like that. People will think we\xe2\x80\x99re mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet \xe2\x80\x99em think,\xe2\x80\x94if the exertion doesn\xe2\x80\x99t kill them. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know who\r\nwe are, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who they are. My faith, Maisie,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re looking lovely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie stared directly in front of her and did not reply. The wind of a\r\nkeen clear winter morning had put colour into her cheeks. Overhead, the\r\ncreamy-yellow smoke-clouds were thinning away one by one against a\r\npale-blue sky, and the improvident sparrows broke off from water-spout\r\ncommittees and cab-rank cabals to clamour of the coming of spring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be lovely weather in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where are we going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stopped at Victoria, and Dick sought tickets. For less than half\r\nthe fraction of an instant it occurred to Maisie, comfortably settled\r\nby the waiting-room fire, that it was much more pleasant to send a man\r\nto the booking-office than to elbow one\xe2\x80\x99s own way through the crowd.\r\nDick put her into a Pullman,\xe2\x80\x94solely on account of the warmth there; and\r\nshe regarded the extravagance with grave scandalised eyes as the train\r\nmoved out into the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I knew where we are going,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated for the twentieth\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe name of a well-remembered station flashed by, towards the end of\r\nthe run, and Maisie was delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dick, you villain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I thought you might like to see the place again. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen here since the old times, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I never cared to see Mrs. Jennett again; and she was all that was\r\never there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite. Look out a minute. There\xe2\x80\x99s the windmill above the\r\npotato-fields; they haven\xe2\x80\x99t built villas there yet; d\xe2\x80\x99you remember when\r\nI shut you up in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. How she beat you for it! I never told it was you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe guessed. I jammed a stick under the door and told you that I was\r\nburying Amomma alive in the potatoes, and you believed me. You had a\r\ntrusting nature in those days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laughed and leaned to look out, identifying ancient landmarks with\r\nmany reminiscences. Dick fixed his weather eye on the curve of Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheek, very near his own, and watched the blood rise under the clear\r\nskin. He congratulated himself upon his cunning, and looked that the\r\nevening would bring him a great reward.\r\n\r\nWhen the train stopped they went out to look at an old town with new\r\neyes. First, but from a distance, they regarded the house of Mrs.\r\nJennett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose she should come out now, what would you do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, with\r\nmock terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should make a face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, dropping into the speech of childhood.\r\n\r\nMaisie made that face in the direction of the mean little villa, and\r\nDick laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cThis is disgraceful,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 said Maisie, mimicking Mrs. Jennett\xe2\x80\x99s tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cMaisie, you run in at once, and learn the collect, gospel, and\r\nepistle for the next three Sundays. After all I\xe2\x80\x99ve taught you, too, and\r\nthree helps every Sunday at dinner! Dick\xe2\x80\x99s always leading you into\r\nmischief. If you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a gentleman, Dick, you might at least\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe sentence ended abruptly. Maisie remembered when it had last been\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cTry to behave like one,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 said Dick, promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite right. Now\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll get some lunch and go on to Fort Keeling,\xe2\x80\x94unless you\xe2\x80\x99d rather\r\ndrive there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must walk, out of respect to the place. How little changed it all\r\nis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey turned in the direction of the sea through unaltered streets, and\r\nthe influence of old things lay upon them. Presently they passed a\r\nconfectioner\xe2\x80\x99s shop much considered in the days when their joint\r\npocket-money amounted to a shilling a week.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick, have you any pennies?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, half to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly three; and if you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have two of \xe2\x80\x99em to buy\r\npeppermints with, you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. She says peppermints aren\xe2\x80\x99t ladylike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain they laughed, and again the colour came into Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks as\r\nthe blood boiled through Dick\xe2\x80\x99s heart. After a large lunch they went\r\ndown to the beach and to Fort Keeling across the waste, wind-bitten\r\nland that no builder had thought it worth his while to defile. The\r\nwinter breeze came in from the sea and sang about their ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaisie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, \xe2\x80\x9cyour nose is getting a crude Prussian blue at the\r\ntip.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll race you as far as you please for as much as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked round cautiously, and with a laugh set off, swiftly as the\r\nulster allowed, till she was out of breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe used to run miles,\xe2\x80\x9d she panted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s absurd that we can\xe2\x80\x99t run\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld age, dear. This it is to get fat and sleek in town. When I wished\r\nto pull your hair you generally ran for three miles, shrieking at the\r\ntop of your voice. I ought to know, because those shrieks of yours were\r\nmeant to call up Mrs. Jennett with a cane and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick, I never got you a beating on purpose in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, of course you never did. Good heavens! look at the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same as ever!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow had gathered from Mr. Beeton that Dick, properly dressed and\r\nshaved, had left the house at half-past eight in the morning with a\r\ntravelling-rug over his arm. The Nilghai rolled in at mid-day for chess\r\nand polite conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s worse than anything I imagined,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the everlasting Dick, I suppose! You fuss over him like a hen with\r\none chick. Let him run riot if he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99ll amuse him. You can whip\r\na young pup off feather, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t whip a young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a woman. It\xe2\x80\x99s one woman; and it\xe2\x80\x99s a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your proof?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe got up and went out at eight this morning,\xe2\x80\x94got up in the middle of\r\nthe night, by Jove! a thing he never does except when he\xe2\x80\x99s on service.\r\n\r\nEven then, remember, we had to kick him out of his blankets before the\r\nfight began at El-Maghrib. It\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks odd; but maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s decided to buy a horse at last. He might\r\nget up for that, mightn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuy a blazing wheelbarrow! He\xe2\x80\x99d have told us if there was a horse in\r\nthe wind. It\xe2\x80\x99s a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be certain. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s only a married woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick has some sense of humour, if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t. Who gets up in the gray\r\ndawn to call on another man\xe2\x80\x99s wife? It\xe2\x80\x99s a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it be a girl, then. She may teach him that there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody else\r\nin the world besides himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll spoil his hand. She\xe2\x80\x99ll waste his time, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll marry him,\r\nand ruin his work for ever. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be a respectable married man before\r\nwe can stop him, and\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ll never go on the long trail again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll quite possible, but the earth won\xe2\x80\x99t spin the other way when that\r\nhappens.... No! ho! I\xe2\x80\x99d give something to see Dick \xe2\x80\x9cgo wooing with the\r\nboys.\xe2\x80\x9d Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. These things be with Allah, and we can\r\nonly look on. Get the chessmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe red-haired girl was lying down in her own room, staring at the\r\nceiling. The footsteps of people on the pavement sounded, as they grew\r\nindistinct in the distance, like a many-times-repeated kiss that was\r\nall one long kiss. Her hands were by her side, and they opened and shut\r\nsavagely from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe charwoman in charge of the scrubbing of the studio knocked at her\r\ndoor: \xe2\x80\x9cBeg y\xe2\x80\x99 pardon, miss, but in cleanin\xe2\x80\x99 of a floor there\xe2\x80\x99s two, not\r\nto say three, kind of soap, which is yaller, an\xe2\x80\x99 mottled, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndisinfectink.\r\n\r\nNow, jist before I took my pail into the passage I though it would be\r\npre\xe2\x80\x99aps jest as well if I was to come up \xe2\x80\x99ere an\xe2\x80\x99 ask you what sort of\r\nsoap you was wishful that I should use on them boards. The yaller soap,\r\nmiss\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the speech to have caused the paroxysm of fury\r\nthat drove the red-haired girl into the middle of the room, almost\r\nshouting\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose _I_ care what you use? Any kind will do!\xe2\x80\x94_any_ kind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman fled, and the red-haired girl looked at her own reflection in\r\nthe glass for an instant and covered her face with her hands. It was as\r\nthough she had shouted some shameless secret aloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nRoses red and roses white\r\nPlucked I for my love\xe2\x80\x99s delight.\r\nShe would none of all my posies,\xe2\x80\x94\r\nBade me gather her blue roses.\r\n\r\nHalf the world I wandered through,\r\nSeeking where such flowers grew;\r\nHalf the world unto my quest\r\nAnswered but with laugh and jest.\r\n\r\nIt may be beyond the grave\r\nShe shall find what she would have.\r\nMine was but an idle quest,\xe2\x80\x94\r\nRoses white and red are best!\xe2\x80\x94_Blue Roses_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea had not changed. Its waters were low on the mud-banks, and the\r\nMarazion Bell-buoy clanked and swung in the tide-way. On the white\r\nbeach-sand dried stumps of sea-poppy shivered and chattered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see the old breakwater,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, under her breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s be thankful that we have as much as we have. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve mounted a single new gun on the fort since we were here. Come\r\nand look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey came to the glacis of Fort Keeling, and sat down in a nook\r\nsheltered from the wind under the tarred throat of a forty-pounder\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, if Ammoma were only here!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie.\r\n\r\nFor a long time both were silent. Then Dick took Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s hand and\r\ncalled her by her name.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and looked out to sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaisie, darling, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it make any difference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d between clenched teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d tell you if it did; but it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t, Oh, Dick, please be sensible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think that it ever will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie rested her chin on her hand, and, still regarding the sea, spoke\r\nhurriedly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you want perfectly well, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t give it to\r\nyou, Dick. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault; indeed, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. If I felt that I could\r\ncare for any one\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94But I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that I care. I simply don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand what the feeling means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that true, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been very good to me, Dickie; and the only way I can pay you\r\nback is by speaking the truth. I daren\xe2\x80\x99t tell a fib. I despise myself\r\nquite enough as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause\xe2\x80\x94because I take everything that you give me and I give you\r\nnothing in return. It\xe2\x80\x99s mean and selfish of me, and whenever I think of\r\nit it worries me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand once for all, then, that I can manage my own affairs, and\r\nif I choose to do anything you aren\xe2\x80\x99t to blame. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t a single\r\nthing to reproach yourself with, darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have, and talking only makes it worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I help myself? If you find me alone for a minute you are\r\nalways talking about it; and when you aren\xe2\x80\x99t you look it. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how I despise myself sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat goodness!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, nearly jumping to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak the\r\ntruth now, Maisie, if you never speak it again! Do I\xe2\x80\x94does this worrying\r\nbore you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It does not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d tell me if it did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should let you know, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. The other thing is fatal. But you must learn to forgive a\r\nman when he\xe2\x80\x99s in love. He\xe2\x80\x99s always a nuisance. You must have known\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie did not consider the last question worth answering, and Dick was\r\nforced to repeat it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were other men, of course. They always worried just when I was\r\nin the middle of my work, and wanted me to listen to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you listen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first; and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care. And they\r\nused to praise my pictures; and I thought they meant it. I used to be\r\nproud of the praise, and tell Kami, and\xe2\x80\x94I shall never forget\xe2\x80\x94once Kami\r\nlaughed at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t like being laughed at, Maisie, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate it. I never laugh at other people unless\xe2\x80\x94unless they do bad\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nDick, tell me honestly what you think of my pictures generally,\xe2\x80\x94of\r\neverything of mine that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cHonest, honest, and honest over!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 quoted Dick from a catchword of\r\nlong ago. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me what Kami always says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x94he says that there is feeling in them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you tell me a fib like that? Remember, I was under Kami for\r\ntwo years. I know exactly what he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a fib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s worse; it\xe2\x80\x99s a half-truth. Kami says, when he puts his head on one\r\nside,\xe2\x80\x94so,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98_Il y a du sentiment, mais il n\xe2\x80\x99y a pas de parti pris_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nrolled the _r_ threateningly, as Kami used to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is what he says; and I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to think that he is\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly he is.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick admitted that two people in the world could do\r\nand say no wrong. Kami was the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you say the same thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s so disheartening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but you asked me to speak the truth. Besides, I love you\r\ntoo much to pretend about your work. It\xe2\x80\x99s strong, it\xe2\x80\x99s patient\r\nsometimes,\xe2\x80\x94not always,\xe2\x80\x94and sometimes there\xe2\x80\x99s power in it, but there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno special reason why it should be done at all. At least, that\xe2\x80\x99s how it\r\nstrikes me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no special reason why anything in the world should ever be\r\ndone. You know that as well as I do. I only want success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going the wrong way to get it, then. Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Kami ever told you\r\nso?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t quote Kami to me. I want to know what you think. My work\xe2\x80\x99s bad,\r\nto begin with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s amateurish, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it most certainly is not. You\xe2\x80\x99re a work-woman, darling, to your\r\nboot-heels, and I respect you for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at me behind my back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear. You see, you are more to me than any one else. Put this\r\ncloak thing round you, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll get chilled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie wrapped herself in the soft marten skins, turning the gray\r\nkangaroo fur to the outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is delicious,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rubbing her chin thoughtfully along the\r\nfur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? Why am I wrong in trying to get a little success?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust because you try. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand, darling? Good work has\r\nnothing to do with\xe2\x80\x94doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to\xe2\x80\x94the person who does it. It\xe2\x80\x99s put\r\ninto him or her from outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how does that affect\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute. All we can do is to learn how to do our work, to be\r\nmasters of our materials instead of servants, and never to be afraid of\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything else comes from outside ourselves. Very good. If we sit\r\ndown quietly to work out notions that are sent to us, we may or we may\r\nnot do something that isn\xe2\x80\x99t bad. A great deal depends on being master\r\nof the bricks and mortar of the trade. But the instant we begin to\r\nthink about success and the effect of our work\xe2\x80\x94to play with one eye on\r\nthe gallery\xe2\x80\x94we lose power and touch and everything else. At least\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s how I have found it. Instead of being quiet and giving every\r\npower you possess to your work, you\xe2\x80\x99re fretting over something which\r\nyou can neither help no hinder by a minute. See?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so easy for you to talk in that way. People like what you do.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you ever think about the gallery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch too often; but I\xe2\x80\x99m always punished for it by loss of power. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nas simple as the Rule of Three. If we make light of our work by using\r\nit for our own ends, our work will make light of us, and, as we\xe2\x80\x99re the\r\nweaker, we shall suffer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t treat my work lightly. You know that it\xe2\x80\x99s everything to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; but, whether you realise it or not, you give two strokes\r\nfor yourself to one for your work. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t your fault, darling. I do\r\nexactly the same thing, and know that I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it. Most of the French\r\nschools, and all the schools here, drive the students to work for their\r\nown credit, and for the sake of their pride. I was told that all the\r\nworld was interested in my work, and everybody at Kami\xe2\x80\x99s talked\r\nturpentine, and I honestly believed that the world needed elevating and\r\ninfluencing, and all manner of impertinences, by my brushes. By Jove, I\r\nactually believed that! When my little head was bursting with a notion\r\nthat I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle because I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t sufficient knowledge of my\r\ncraft, I used to run about wondering at my own magnificence and getting\r\nready to astonish the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely one can do that sometimes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery seldom with malice aforethought, darling. And when it\xe2\x80\x99s done it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuch a tiny thing, and the world\xe2\x80\x99s so big, and all but a millionth part\r\nof it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care. Maisie, come with me and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you something of\r\nthe size of the world. One can no more avoid working than eating,\xe2\x80\x94that\r\ngoes on by itself,\xe2\x80\x94but try to see what you are working for. I know such\r\nlittle heavens that I could take you to,\xe2\x80\x94islands tucked away under the\r\nLine.\r\n\r\nYou sight them after weeks of crashing through water as black as black\r\nmarble because it\xe2\x80\x99s so deep, and you sit in the fore-chains day after\r\nday and see the sun rise almost afraid because the sea\xe2\x80\x99s so lonely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is afraid?\xe2\x80\x94you, or the sun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sun, of course. And there are noises under the sea, and sounds\r\noverhead in a clear sky. Then you find your island alive with hot moist\r\norchids that make mouths at you and can do everything except talk.\r\n\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a waterfall in it three hundred feet high, just like a sliver\r\nof green jade laced with silver; and millions of wild bees live up in\r\nthe rocks; and you can hear the fat cocoanuts falling from the palms;\r\nand you order an ivory-white servant to sling you a long yellow hammock\r\nwith tassels on it like ripe maize, and you put up your feet and hear\r\nthe bees hum and the water fall till you go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan one work there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. One must do something always. You hang your canvas up in a\r\npalm tree and let the parrots criticise. When they scuffle you heave a\r\nripe custard-apple at them, and it bursts in a lather of cream. There\r\nare hundreds of places. Come and see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite like that place. It sounds lazy. Tell me another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of a big, red, dead city built of red sandstone,\r\nwith raw green aloes growing between the stones, lying out neglected on\r\nhoney-coloured sands? There are forty dead kings there, Maisie, each in\r\na gorgeous tomb finer than all the others. You look at the palaces and\r\nstreets and shops and tanks, and think that men must live there, till\r\nyou find a wee gray squirrel rubbing its nose all alone in the\r\nmarket-place, and a jewelled peacock struts out of a carved doorway and\r\nspreads its tail against a marble screen as fine pierced as point-lace.\r\nThen a monkey\xe2\x80\x94a little black monkey\xe2\x80\x94walks through the main square to\r\nget a drink from a tank forty feet deep. He slides down the creepers to\r\nthe water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, and a friend holds him by the tail, in case he should\r\nfall in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been there and seen. Then evening comes, and the lights change\r\ntill it\xe2\x80\x99s just as though you stood in the heart of a king-opal. A\r\nlittle before sundown, as punctually as clockwork, a big bristly wild\r\nboar, with all his family following, trots through the city gate,\r\nchurning the foam on his tusks. You climb on the shoulder of a blind\r\nblack stone god and watch that pig choose himself a palace for the\r\nnight and stump in wagging his tail. Then the night-wind gets up, and\r\nthe sands move, and you hear the desert outside the city singing, \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nI lay me down to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d and everything is dark till the moon rises.\r\nMaisie, darling, come with me and see what the world is really like.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s very lovely, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very horrible,\xe2\x80\x94but I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you see\r\nanything horrid,\xe2\x80\x94and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care your life or mine for pictures or\r\nanything else except doing its own work and making love. Come, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nshow you how to brew sangaree, and sling a hammock, and\xe2\x80\x94oh, thousands\r\nof things, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see for yourself what colour means, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind out together what love means, and then, maybe, we shall be allowed\r\nto do some good work. Come away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you do anything until you have seen everything, or as much as\r\nyou can? And besides, darling, I love you. Come along with me. You have\r\nno business here; you don\xe2\x80\x99t belong to this place; you\xe2\x80\x99re half a\r\ngipsy,\xe2\x80\x94your face tells that; and I\xe2\x80\x94even the smell of open water makes\r\nme restless. Come across the sea and be happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had risen to his feet, and stood in the shadow of the gun, looking\r\ndown at the girl. The very short winter afternoon had worn away, and,\r\nbefore they knew, the winter moon was walking the untroubled sea. Long\r\nruled lines of silver showed where a ripple of the rising tide was\r\nturning over the mud-banks. The wind had dropped, and in the intense\r\nstillness they could hear a donkey cropping the frosty grass many yards\r\naway. A faint beating, like that of a muffled drum, came out of the\r\nmoon-haze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds like a heart beating.\r\nWhere is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick was so angry at this sudden wrench to his pleadings that he could\r\nnot trust himself to speak, and in this silence caught the sound.\r\nMaisie from her seat under the gun watched him with a certain amount of\r\nfear. She wished so much that he would be sensible and cease to worry\r\nher with over-sea emotion that she both could and could not understand.\r\nShe was not prepared, however, for the change in his face as he\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a steamer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca twin-screw steamer, by the beat. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake her out, but she must be standing very close in-shore. Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d as the\r\nred of a rocket streaked the haze, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s standing in to signal before\r\nshe clears the Channel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a wreck?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, to whom these words were as Greek.\r\n\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were turned to the sea. \xe2\x80\x9cWreck! What nonsense! She\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nreporting herself. Red rocket forward\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a green light aft now,\r\nand two red rockets from the bridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the signal of the Cross Keys Line running to Australia. I wonder\r\nwhich steamer it is.\xe2\x80\x9d The note of his voice had changed; he seemed to\r\nbe talking to himself, and Maisie did not approve of it. The moonlight\r\nbroke the haze for a moment, touching the black sides of a long steamer\r\nworking down Channel. \xe2\x80\x9cFour masts and three funnels\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s in deep\r\ndraught, too. That must be the _Barralong_, or the _Bhutia_. No, the\r\n_Bhutia_ has a clopper bow. It\xe2\x80\x99s the _Barralong_, to Australia. She\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlift the Southern Cross in a week,\xe2\x80\x94lucky old tub!\xe2\x80\x94oh, lucky old tub!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared intently, and moved up the slope of the fort to get a better\r\nview, but the mist on the sea thickened again, and the beating of the\r\nscrews grew fainter. Maisie called to him a little angrily, and he\r\nreturned, still keeping his eyes to seaward. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever seen the\r\nSouthern Cross blazing right over your head?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s superb!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said shortly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to. If you think it\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nlovely, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go and see it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her face from the soft blackness of the marten skins about\r\nher throat, and her eyes shone like diamonds. The moonlight on the gray\r\nkangaroo fur turned it to frosted silver of the coldest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, Maisie, you look like a little heathen idol tucked up there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe eyes showed that they did not appreciate the compliment. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Southern Cross isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth looking at unless\r\nsomeone helps you to see. That steamer\xe2\x80\x99s out of hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose I were to come to you now,\xe2\x80\x94be quiet\r\na minute,\xe2\x80\x94just as I am, and caring for you just as much as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as a brother, though? You said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94in the Park.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never had a brother. Suppose I said, \xe2\x80\x9cTake me to those places, and\r\nin time, perhaps, I might really care for you,\xe2\x80\x9d what would you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend you straight back to where you came from, in a cab. No, I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; I\xe2\x80\x99d let you walk. But you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, dear. And I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t run the risk. You\xe2\x80\x99re worth waiting for till you can come\r\nwithout reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you honestly believe that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a hazy sort of idea that I do. Has it never struck you in that\r\nlight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x94es. I feel so wicked about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWickeder than usual?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know all I think. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost too awful to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. You promised to tell me the truth\xe2\x80\x94at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so ungrateful of me, but\xe2\x80\x94but, though I know you care for me, and\r\nI like to have you with me, I\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d even sacrifice you, if that would\r\nbring me what I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor little darling! I know that state of mind. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lead to\r\ngood work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou aren\xe2\x80\x99t angry? Remember, I do despise myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not exactly flattered,\xe2\x80\x94I had guessed as much before,\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nangry. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you. Surely you ought to have left a littleness\r\nlike that behind you, years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve no right to patronise me! I only want what I have worked for so\r\nlong. It came to you without any trouble, and\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do? I\xe2\x80\x99d give ten years of my life to get you what you want.\r\n\r\nBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t help you; even I can\xe2\x80\x99t help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA murmur of dissent from Maisie. He went on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I know by what you\r\nhave just said that you\xe2\x80\x99re on the wrong road to success. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nat by sacrificing other people,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve had that much knocked into me; you\r\nmust sacrifice yourself, and live under orders, and never think for\r\nyourself, and never have real satisfaction in your work except just at\r\nthe beginning, when you\xe2\x80\x99re reaching out after a notion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you believe all that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no question of belief or disbelief. That\xe2\x80\x99s the law, and you\r\ntake it or refuse it as you please. I try to obey, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t, and\r\nthen my work turns bad on my hands. Under any circumstances, remember,\r\nfour-fifths of everybody\xe2\x80\x99s work must be bad. But the remnant is worth\r\nthe trouble for it\xe2\x80\x99s own sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it nice to get credit even for bad work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s much too nice. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 May I tell you something? It isn\xe2\x80\x99t a pretty\r\ntale, but you\xe2\x80\x99re so like a man that I forget when I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce when I was out in the Soudan I went over some ground that we had\r\nbeen fighting on for three days. There were twelve hundred dead; and we\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t time to bury them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow ghastly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had been at work on a big double-sheet sketch, and I was wondering\r\nwhat people would think of it at home. The sight of that field taught\r\nme a good deal. It looked just like a bed of horrible toadstools in all\r\ncolours, and\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d never seen men in bulk go back to their beginnings\r\nbefore. So I began to understand that men and women were only material\r\nto work with, and that what they said or did was of no consequence.\r\nSee? Strictly speaking, you might just as well put your ear down to the\r\npalette to catch what your colours are saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick, that\xe2\x80\x99s disgraceful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute. I said, strictly speaking. Unfortunately, everybody\r\nmust be either a man or a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you allow that much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn your case I don\xe2\x80\x99t. You aren\xe2\x80\x99t a woman. But ordinary people, Maisie,\r\nmust behave and work as such. That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes me so savage.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nhurled a pebble towards the sea as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that it is outside\r\nmy business to care what people say; I can see that it spoils my output\r\nif I listen to \xe2\x80\x99em; and yet, confound it all,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94another pebble flew\r\nseaward,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help purring when I\xe2\x80\x99m rubbed the right way. Even when\r\nI can see on a man\xe2\x80\x99s forehead that he is lying his way through a clump\r\nof pretty speeches, those lies make me happy and play the mischief with\r\nmy hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say pretty things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, belovedest,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Dick grinned,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI forget that I am the steward of\r\nthese gifts, and I want to make that man love and appreciate my work\r\nwith a thick stick. It\xe2\x80\x99s too humiliating altogether; but I suppose even\r\nif one were an angel and painted humans altogether from outside, one\r\nwould lose in touch what one gained in grip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie laughed at the idea of Dick as an angel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you seem to think,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat everything nice spoils your\r\nhand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think. It\xe2\x80\x99s the law,\xe2\x80\x94just the same as it was at Mrs.\r\nJennett\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nEverything that is nice does spoil your hand. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you see so\r\nclearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I. But\xe2\x80\x94have got orders: what can do? Are you strong enough to face\r\nit alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me help, darling. We can hold each other very tight and try to\r\nwalk straight. We shall blunder horribly, but it will be better than\r\nstumbling apart. Maisie, can\xe2\x80\x99t you see reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should get on together. We should be two of a trade,\r\nso we should never agree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I should like to meet the man who made that proverb! He lived in a\r\ncave and ate raw bear, I fancy. I\xe2\x80\x99d make him chew his own arrow-heads.\r\n\r\nWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be only half married to you. I should worry and fuss about my\r\nwork, as I do now. Four days out of the seven I\xe2\x80\x99m not fit to speak to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk as if no one else in the world had ever used a brush. D\xe2\x80\x99you\r\nsuppose that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the feeling of worry and bother and\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t-get-at-ness? You\xe2\x80\x99re lucky if you only have it four days out of\r\nthe seven. What difference would that make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great deal\xe2\x80\x94if you had it too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I could respect it. Another man might not. He might laugh at\r\nyou. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no use talking about it. If you can think in that way\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t care for me\xe2\x80\x94yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tide had nearly covered the mud-banks and twenty little ripples\r\nbroke on the beach before Maisie chose to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe very much that you are better than\r\nI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to bear on the argument\xe2\x80\x94but in what way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know, but in what you said about work and things; and\r\nthen you\xe2\x80\x99re so patient. Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re better than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick considered rapidly the murkiness of an average man\xe2\x80\x99s life. There\r\nwas nothing in the review to fill him with a sense of virtue. He lifted\r\nthe hem of the cloak to his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, making as though she had not noticed, \xe2\x80\x9ccan you see\r\nthings that I can\xe2\x80\x99t? I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe what you believe; but you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nright, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen anything, God knows I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have seen it but for you,\r\nand I know that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said it except to you. You seemed to\r\nmake everything clear for a minute; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t practice what I preach.\r\nYou would help me.... There are only us two in the world for all\r\npurposes, and\xe2\x80\x94and you like to have me with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do. I wonder if you can realise how utterly lonely I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarling, I think I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo years ago, when I first took the little house, I used to walk up\r\nand down the back-garden trying to cry. I never can cry. Can you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s some time since I tried. What was the trouble? Overwork?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but I used to dream that I had broken down, and had no\r\nmoney, and was starving in London. I thought about it all day, and it\r\nfrightened me\xe2\x80\x94oh, how it frightened me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that fear. It\xe2\x80\x99s the most terrible of all. It wakes me up in the\r\nnight sometimes. You oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to know anything about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do _you_ know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. Is your three hundred a year safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in Consols.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. If any one comes to you and recommends a better\r\ninvestment,\xe2\x80\x94even if I should come to you,\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you listen. Never shift\r\nthe money for a minute, and never lend a penny of it,\xe2\x80\x94even to the\r\nred-haired girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t scold me so! I\xe2\x80\x99m not likely to be foolish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe earth is full of men who\xe2\x80\x99d sell their souls for three hundred a\r\nyear; and women come and talk, and borrow a five-pound note here and a\r\nten-pound note there; and a woman has no conscience in a money debt.\r\nStick to your money, Maisie, for there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more ghastly in the\r\nworld than poverty in London. It\xe2\x80\x99s scared me. By Jove, it put the fear\r\ninto _me!_ And one oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be afraid of anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo each man is appointed his particular dread,\xe2\x80\x94the terror that, if he\r\ndoes not fight against it, must cow him even to the loss of his\r\nmanhood. Dick\xe2\x80\x99s experience of the sordid misery of want had entered\r\ninto the deeps of him, and, lest he might find virtue too easy, that\r\nmemory stood behind him, tempting to shame, when dealers came to buy\r\nhis wares. As the Nilghai quaked against his will at the still green\r\nwater of a lake or a mill-dam, as Torpenhow flinched before any white\r\narm that could cut or stab and loathed himself for flinching, Dick\r\nfeared the poverty he had once tasted half in jest. His burden was\r\nheavier than the burdens of his companions.\r\n\r\nMaisie watched the face working in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve plenty of pennies now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said soothingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never have enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, with vicious emphasis. Then,\r\nlaughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall always be three-pence short in my accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy threepence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI carried a man\xe2\x80\x99s bag once from Liverpool Street Station to\r\nBlackfriar\xe2\x80\x99s Bridge. It was a sixpenny job,\xe2\x80\x94you needn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh; indeed\r\nit was,\xe2\x80\x94and I wanted the money desperately. He only gave me threepence;\r\nand he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even the decency to pay in silver. Whatever money I make,\r\nI shall never get that odd threepence out of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was not language befitting the man who had preached of the\r\nsanctity of work. It jarred on Maisie, who preferred her payment in\r\napplause, which, since all men desire it, must be of her right. She\r\nhunted for her little purse and gravely took out a threepenny bit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you, Dickie; and don\xe2\x80\x99t worry any\r\nmore; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth while. Are you paid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the very human apostle of fair craft, taking the coin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m paid a thousand times, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll close that account. It shall live\r\non my watch-chain; and you\xe2\x80\x99re an angel, Maisie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very cramped, and I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling a little cold. Good gracious! the\r\ncloak is all white, and so is your moustache! I never knew it was so\r\nchilly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA light frost lay white on the shoulder of Dick\xe2\x80\x99s ulster. He, too, had\r\nforgotten the state of the weather. They laughed together, and with\r\nthat laugh ended all serious discourse.\r\n\r\nThey ran inland across the waste to warm themselves, then turned to\r\nlook at the glory of the full tide under the moonlight and the intense\r\nblack shadows of the furze bushes. It was an additional joy to Dick\r\nthat Maisie could see colour even as he saw it,\xe2\x80\x94could see the blue in\r\nthe white of the mist, the violet that is in gray palings, and all\r\nthings else as they are,\xe2\x80\x94not of one hue, but a thousand. And the\r\nmoonlight came into Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s soul, so that she, usually reserved,\r\nchattered of herself and of the things she took interest in,\xe2\x80\x94of Kami,\r\nwisest of teachers, and of the girls in the studio,\xe2\x80\x94of the Poles, who\r\nwill kill themselves with overwork if they are not checked; of the\r\nFrench, who talk at great length of much more than they will ever\r\naccomplish; of the slovenly English, who toil hopelessly and cannot\r\nunderstand that inclination does not imply power; of the Americans,\r\nwhose rasping voices in the hush of a hot afternoon strain tense-drawn\r\nnerves to breaking-point, and whose suppers lead to indigestion; of\r\ntempestuous Russians, neither to hold nor to bind, who tell the girls\r\nghost-stories till the girls shriek; of stolid Germans, who come to\r\nlearn one thing, and, having mastered that much, stolidly go away and\r\ncopy pictures for evermore. Dick listened enraptured because it was\r\nMaisie who spoke. He knew the old life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo they still steal colours at\r\nlunch-time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot steal. Attract is the word. Of course they do. I\xe2\x80\x99m good\xe2\x80\x94I only\r\nattract ultramarine; but there are students who\xe2\x80\x99d attract flake-white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it myself. You can\xe2\x80\x99t help it when the palettes are hung up.\r\n\r\nEvery colour is common property once it runs down,\xe2\x80\x94even though you do\r\nstart it with a drop of oil. It teaches people not to waste their\r\ntubes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to attract some of your colours, Dick. Perhaps I might\r\ncatch your success with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t say a bad word, but I should like to. What in the world,\r\nwhich you\xe2\x80\x99ve just missed a lovely chance of seeing, does success or\r\nwant of success, or a three-storied success, matter compared with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 No,\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t open that question again. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to go back to town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Dick, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re much more interested in that than you are in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you give me if I tell you a sure short-cut to everything you\r\nwant,\xe2\x80\x94the trouble and the fuss and the tangle and all the rest? Will\r\nyou promise to obey me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, you must never forget a meal because you happen to\r\nbe at work. You forgot your lunch twice last week,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, at a\r\nventure, for he knew with whom he was dealing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x94only once, really.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough. And you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t take a cup of tea and a biscuit in\r\nplace of a regular dinner, because dinner happens to be a trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re making fun of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never was more in earnest in my life. Oh, my love, my love, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit dawned on you yet what you are to me? Here\xe2\x80\x99s the whole earth in a\r\nconspiracy to give you a chill, or run over you, or drench you to the\r\nskin, or cheat you out of your money, or let you die of overwork and\r\nunderfeeding, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the mere right to look after you. Why, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t even know if you have sense enough to put on warm things when the\r\nweather\xe2\x80\x99s cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick, you\xe2\x80\x99re the most awful boy to talk to\xe2\x80\x94really! How do you suppose\r\nI managed when you were away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. But now I\xe2\x80\x99m back I\xe2\x80\x99d give everything\r\nI have for the right of telling you to come in out of the rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour success too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time it cost Dick a severe struggle to refrain from bad words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs Mrs. Jennett used to say, you\xe2\x80\x99re a trial, Maisie! You\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ncooped up in the schools too long, and you think every one is looking\r\nat you.\r\n\r\nThere aren\xe2\x80\x99t twelve hundred people in the world who understand\r\npictures. The others pretend and don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Remember, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen twelve\r\nhundred men dead in toadstool-beds. It\xe2\x80\x99s only the voice of the tiniest\r\nlittle fraction of people that makes success. The real world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare a tinker\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care a bit. For aught you or I know, every man\r\nin the world may be arguing with a Maisie of his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Maisie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Dick, I think. Do you believe while he\xe2\x80\x99s fighting for what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndearer than his life he wants to look at a picture? And even if he did,\r\nand if all the world did, and a thousand million people rose up and\r\nshouted hymns to my honour and glory, would that make up to me for the\r\nknowledge that you were out shopping in the Edgware Road on a rainy day\r\nwithout an umbrella? Now we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said on the beach\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Maisie, with a certain fear.\r\n\r\nDick groaned aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know what I said. My work is everything I\r\nhave, or am, or hope to be, to me, and I believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt the law\r\nthat governs it; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve some lingering sense of fun left,\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve nearly knocked it out of me. I can just see that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neverything to all the world. Do what I say, and not what I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie was careful not to reopen debatable matters, and they returned\r\nto London joyously. The terminus stopped Dick in the midst of an\r\neloquent harangue on the beauties of exercise. He would buy Maisie a\r\nhorse,\xe2\x80\x94such a horse as never yet bowed head to bit,\xe2\x80\x94would stable it,\r\nwith a companion, some twenty miles from London, and Maisie, solely for\r\nher health\xe2\x80\x99s sake should ride with him twice or thrice a week.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s absurd,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be proper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, who in all London to-night would have sufficient interest or\r\naudacity to call us two to account for anything we chose to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie looked at the lamps, the fog, and the hideous turmoil. Dick was\r\nright; but horseflesh did not make for Art as she understood it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very nice sometimes, but you\xe2\x80\x99re very foolish more times. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot going to let you give me horses, or take you out of your way\r\nto-night. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go home by myself. Only I want you to promise me\r\nsomething. You won\xe2\x80\x99t think any more about that extra threepence, will\r\nyou? Remember, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been paid; and I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow you to be spiteful\r\nand do bad work for a little thing like that. You can be so big that\r\nyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be tiny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was turning the tables with a vengeance. There remained only to\r\nput Maisie into her hansom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d she said simply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come on Sunday. It has been a\r\nbeautiful day, Dick. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t it be like this always?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause love\xe2\x80\x99s like line-work: you must go forward or backward; you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stand still. By the way, go on with your line-work. Good-night,\r\nand, for my\xe2\x80\x94for my sake, take care of yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to walk home, meditating. The day had brought him nothing\r\nthat he hoped for, but\xe2\x80\x94surely this was worth many days\xe2\x80\x94it had brought\r\nhim nearer to Maisie. The end was only a question of time now, and the\r\nprize well worth the waiting. By instinct, once more, he turned to the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she understood at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking at the water. \xe2\x80\x9cShe found\r\nout my pet besetting sin on the spot, and paid it off. My God, how she\r\nunderstood! And she said I was better than she was! Better than she\r\nwas!\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed at the absurdity of the notion. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if girls\r\nguess at one-half a man\xe2\x80\x99s life. They can\xe2\x80\x99t, or\xe2\x80\x94they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe took her gift out of his pocket, and considered it in the light of a\r\nmiracle and a pledge of the comprehension that, one day, would lead to\r\nperfect happiness. Meantime, Maisie was alone in London, with none to\r\nsave her from danger. And the packed wilderness was very full of\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nDick made his prayer to Fate disjointedly after the manner of the\r\nheathen as he threw the piece of silver into the river. If any evil\r\nwere to befal, let him bear the burden and let Maisie go unscathed,\r\nsince the threepenny piece was dearest to him of all his possessions.\r\nIt was a small coin in itself, but Maisie had given it, and the Thames\r\nheld it, and surely the Fates would be bribed for this once.\r\n\r\nThe drowning of the coin seemed to cut him free from thought of Maisie\r\nfor the moment. He took himself off the bridge and went whistling to\r\nhis chambers with a strong yearning for some man-talk and tobacco after\r\nhis first experience of an entire day spent in the society of a woman.\r\nThere was a stronger desire at his heart when there rose before him an\r\nunsolicited vision of the _Barralong_ dipping deep and sailing free for\r\nthe Southern Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd these two, as I have told you,\r\nWere the friends of Hiawatha,\r\nChibiabos, the musician,\r\nAnd the very strong man, Kwasind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Hiawatha_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTorpenhow was paging the last sheets of some manuscript, while the\r\nNilghai, who had come for chess and remained to talk tactics, was\r\nreading through the first part, commenting scornfully the while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s picturesque enough and it\xe2\x80\x99s sketchy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as a serious\r\nconsideration of affairs in Eastern Europe, it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s off my hands at any rate.... Thirty-seven, thirty-eight,\r\nthirty-nine slips altogether, aren\xe2\x80\x99t there? That should make between\r\neleven and twelve pages of valuable misinformation. Heigho!\xe2\x80\x9d Torpenhow\r\nshuffled the writing together and hummed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nYoung lambs to sell, young lambs to sell,\r\nIf I\xe2\x80\x99d as much money as I could tell,\r\nI never would cry, Young lambs to sell!\r\n\r\n\r\nDick entered, self-conscious and a little defiant, but in the best of\r\ntempers with all the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack at last?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore or less. What have you been doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWork. Dickie, you behave as though the Bank of England were behind\r\nyou. Here\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday gone and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t done a\r\nline. It\xe2\x80\x99s scandalous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe notions come and go, my children\xe2\x80\x94they come and go like our\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbaccy,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, filling his pipe. \xe2\x80\x9cMoreover,\xe2\x80\x9d he stooped to\r\nthrust a spill into the grate, \xe2\x80\x9cApollo does not always stretch his\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\nOh, confound your clumsy jests, Nilghai!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the place to preach the theory of direct inspiration,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Nilghai, returning Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s large and workmanlike bellows\r\nto their nail on the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe in cobblers\xe2\x80\x99 wax. _La!_\xe2\x80\x94where\r\nyou sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you weren\xe2\x80\x99t so big and fat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, looking round for a weapon,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo skylarking in my rooms. You two smashed half my furniture last time\r\nyou threw the cushions about. You might have the decency to say How\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99you do? to Binkie. Look at him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBinkie had jumped down from the sofa and was fawning round Dick\xe2\x80\x99s knee,\r\nand scratching at his boots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, snatching him up, and kissing him on the black\r\npatch above his right eye. \xe2\x80\x9cDid ums was, Binks? Did that ugly Nilghai\r\nturn you off the sofa? Bite him, Mr. Binkie.\xe2\x80\x9d He pitched him on the\r\nNilghai\xe2\x80\x99s stomach, as the big man lay at ease, and Binkie pretended to\r\ndestroy the Nilghai inch by inch, till a sofa cushion extinguished him,\r\nand panting he stuck out his tongue at the company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Binkie-boy went for a walk this morning before you were up, Torp.\r\n\r\nI saw him making love to the butcher at the corner when the shutters\r\nwere being taken down\xe2\x80\x94just as if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to eat in his own\r\nproper house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBinks, is that a true bill?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, severely. The little dog\r\nretreated under the sofa cushion, and showed by the fat white back of\r\nhim that he really had no further interest in the discussion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrikes me that another disreputable dog went for a walk, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Nilghai. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you get up so early? Torp said you might be\r\nbuying a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows it would need three of us for a serious business like that.\r\nNo, I felt lonesome and unhappy, so I went out to look at the sea, and\r\nwatch the pretty ships go by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomewhere on the Channel. Progly or Snigly, or some watering-place was\r\nits name; I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten; but it was only two hours\xe2\x80\x99 run from London\r\nand the ships went by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see anything you knew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the _Barralong_ outwards to Australia, and an Odessa grain-boat\r\nloaded down by the head. It was a thick day, but the sea smelt good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWherefore put on one\xe2\x80\x99s best trousers to see the _Barralong?_\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTorpenhow, pointing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing except these things and my painting duds.\r\nBesides, I wanted to do honour to the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid She make you feel restless?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Nilghai, keenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrazy. Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I went.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow and the Nilghai exchanged a look as Dick, stooping, busied\r\nhimself among the former\xe2\x80\x99s boots and trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese will do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I think much of your\r\ntaste in slippers, but the fit\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xe2\x80\x9d He slipped his feet into a\r\npair of sock-like sambhur-skin foot coverings, found a long chair, and\r\nlay at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re my own pet pair,\xe2\x80\x9d Torpenhow said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to put\r\nthem on myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll your reprehensible selfishness. Just because you see me happy for\r\na minute, you want to worry me and stir me up. Find another pair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood for you that Dick can\xe2\x80\x99t wear your clothes, Torp. You two live\r\ncommunistically,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick never has anything that I can wear. He\xe2\x80\x99s only useful to sponge\r\nupon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound you, have you been rummaging round among my clothes, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cI put a sovereign in the tobacco-jar yesterday. How do you\r\nexpect a man to keep his accounts properly if you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the Nilghai began to laugh, and Torpenhow joined him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHid a sovereign yesterday! You\xe2\x80\x99re no sort of financier. You lent me a\r\nfiver about a month back. Do you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d Torpenhow said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that I paid it you ten days later, and you put it at\r\nthe bottom of the tobacco?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, did I? I thought it was in one of my colour-boxes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thought! About a week ago I went into your studio to get some\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbaccy and found it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTook the Nilghai to a theatre and fed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feed the Nilghai under twice the money\xe2\x80\x94not though you\r\ngave him Army beef. Well, I suppose I should have found it out sooner\r\nor later. What is there to laugh at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a most amazing cuckoo in many directions,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai,\r\nstill chuckling over the thought of the dinner. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. We had\r\nboth been working very hard, and it was your unearned increment we\r\nspent, and as you\xe2\x80\x99re only a loafer it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant\xe2\x80\x94from the man who is bursting with my meat, too. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget that dinner back one of these days. Suppose we go to a theatre\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut our boots on,\xe2\x80\x94and dress,\xe2\x80\x94_and_ wash?\xe2\x80\x9d The Nilghai spoke very\r\nlazily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI withdraw the motion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose, just for a change\xe2\x80\x94as a startling variety, you know\xe2\x80\x94we, that\r\nis to say _we_, get our charcoal and our canvas and go on with our\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow spoke pointedly, but Dick only wriggled his toes inside the\r\nsoft leather moccasins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a one-ideaed clucker that is! If I had any unfinished figures on\r\nhand, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any model; if I had my model, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any spray, and\r\nI never leave charcoal unfixed overnight; and if I had my spray and\r\ntwenty photographs of backgrounds, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to-night. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t feel that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBinkie-dog, he\xe2\x80\x99s a lazy hog, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, I _will_ do some work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, rising swiftly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfetch the Nungapunga Book, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll add another picture to the Nilghai\r\nSaga.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you worrying him a little too much?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Nilghai, when\r\nDick had left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, but I know what he can turn out if he likes. It makes me\r\nsavage to hear him praised for past work when I know what he ought to\r\ndo. You and I are arranged for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Kismet and our own powers, more\xe2\x80\x99s the pity. I have dreamed of a\r\ngood deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo have I, but we know our limitations now. I\xe2\x80\x99m dashed if I know what\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s may be when he gives himself to his work. That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes me\r\nso keen about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when all\xe2\x80\x99s said and done, you will be put aside\xe2\x80\x94quite rightly\xe2\x80\x94for\r\na female girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder... Where do you think he has been to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the sea. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you see the look in his eyes when he talked about\r\nher? He\xe2\x80\x99s as restless as a swallow in autumn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but did he go alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, but he has the beginnings of the\r\ngo-fever upon him. He wants to up-stakes and move out. There\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nmistaking the signs. Whatever he may have said before, he has the call\r\nupon him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be his salvation,\xe2\x80\x9d Torpenhow said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\xe2\x80\x94if you care to take the responsibility of being a saviour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick returned with the big clasped sketch-book that the Nilghai knew\r\nwell and did not love too much. In it Dick had drawn all manner of\r\nmoving incidents, experienced by himself or related to him by the\r\nothers, of all the four corners of the earth. But the wider range of\r\nthe Nilghai\xe2\x80\x99s body and life attracted him most. When truth failed he\r\nfell back on fiction of the wildest, and represented incidents in the\r\nNilghai\xe2\x80\x99s career that were unseemly,\xe2\x80\x94his marriages with many African\r\nprincesses, his shameless betrayal, for Arab wives, of an army corps to\r\nthe Mahdi, his tattooment by skilled operators in Burmah, his interview\r\n(and his fears) with the yellow headsman in the blood-stained\r\nexecution-ground of Canton, and finally, the passings of his spirit\r\ninto the bodies of whales, elephants, and toucans. Torpenhow from time\r\nto time had added rhymed descriptions, and the whole was a curious\r\npiece of art, because Dick decided, having regard to the name of the\r\nbook which being interpreted means \xe2\x80\x9cnaked,\xe2\x80\x9d that it would be wrong to\r\ndraw the Nilghai with any clothes on, under any circumstances.\r\nConsequently the last sketch, representing that much-enduring man\r\ncalling on the War Office to press his claims to the Egyptian medal,\r\nwas hardly delicate. He settled himself comfortably on Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntable and turned over the pages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fortune you would have been to Blake, Nilghai!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a succulent pinkness about some of these sketches that\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\nthan life-like. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Nilghai surrounded while bathing by the\r\nMahdieh\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that was founded on fact, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very nearly my last bath, you irreverent dauber. Has Binkie\r\ncome into the Saga yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; the Binkie-boy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done anything except eat and kill cats.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s see. Here you are as a stained-glass saint in a church. Deuced\r\ndecorative lines about your anatomy; you ought to be grateful for being\r\nhanded down to posterity in this way. Fifty years hence you\xe2\x80\x99ll exist in\r\nrare and curious facsimiles at ten guineas each. What shall I try this\r\ntime? The domestic life of the Nilghai?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t got any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe undomestic life of the Nilghai, then. Of course. Mass-meeting of\r\nhis wives in Trafalgar Square. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. They came from the ends of\r\nthe earth to attend Nilghai\xe2\x80\x99s wedding to an English bride. This shall\r\nbe an epic. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sweet material to work with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a scandalous waste of time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry; it keeps one\xe2\x80\x99s hand in\xe2\x80\x94specially when you begin without\r\nthe pencil.\xe2\x80\x9d He set to work rapidly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s Column. Presently\r\nthe Nilghai will appear shinning up it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him some clothes this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\xe2\x80\x94a veil and an orange-wreath, because he\xe2\x80\x99s been married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGad, that\xe2\x80\x99s clever enough!\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow over his shoulder, as Dick\r\nbrought out of the paper with three twirls of the brush a very fat back\r\nand labouring shoulder pressed against stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick continued, \xe2\x80\x9cif we could publish a few of these\r\ndear little things every time the Nilghai subsidises a man who can\r\nwrite, to give the public an honest opinion of my pictures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll admit I always tell you when I have done anything of that\r\nkind. I know I can\xe2\x80\x99t hammer you as you ought to be hammered, so I give\r\nthe job to another. Young Maclagan, for instance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo-o\xe2\x80\x94one half-minute, old man; stick your hand out against the dark of\r\nthe wall-paper\xe2\x80\x94you only burble and call me names. That left shoulder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nout of drawing. I must literally throw a veil over that. Where\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\npen-knife? Well, what about Maclagan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only gave him his riding-orders to\xe2\x80\x94to lambast you on general\r\nprinciples for not producing work that will last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereupon that young fool,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Dick threw back his head and shut one eye\r\nas he shifted the page under his hand,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbeing left alone with an\r\nink-pot and what he conceived were his own notions, went and spilt them\r\nboth over me in the papers. You might have engaged a grown man for the\r\nbusiness, Nilghai. How do you think the bridal veil looks now, Torp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow the deuce do three dabs and two scratches make the stuff stand\r\naway from the body as it does?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, to whom Dick\xe2\x80\x99s methods\r\nwere always new.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt just depends on where you put \xe2\x80\x99em. If Maclagan had known that much\r\nabout his business he might have done better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you put the damned dabs into something that will stay,\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d insisted the Nilghai, who had really taken considerable trouble\r\nin hiring for Dick\xe2\x80\x99s benefit the pen of a young gentleman who devoted\r\nmost of his waking hours to an anxious consideration of the aims and\r\nends of Art, which, he wrote, was one and indivisible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute till I see how I am going to manage my procession of\r\nwives. You seem to have married extensively, and I must rough \xe2\x80\x99em in\r\nwith the pencil\xe2\x80\x94Medes, Parthians, Edomites.... Now, setting aside the\r\nweakness and the wickedness and\xe2\x80\x94and the fat-headedness of deliberately\r\ntrying to do work that will live, as they call it, I\xe2\x80\x99m content with the\r\nknowledge that I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my best up to date, and I shan\xe2\x80\x99t do anything\r\nlike it again for some hours at least\xe2\x80\x94probably years. Most probably\r\nnever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! any stuff you have in stock your best work?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything you\xe2\x80\x99ve sold?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t here and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t sold. Better than that, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nsold, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any one knows where it is. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t....\r\nAnd yet more and more wives, on the north side of the square. Observe\r\nthe virtuous horror of the lions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may as well explain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, and Dick lifted his head\r\nfrom the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sea reminded me of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. It\r\nweighs some few thousand tons\xe2\x80\x94unless you cut it out with a cold\r\nchisel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be an idiot. You can\xe2\x80\x99t pose with us here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no pose in the matter at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. I was loafing from\r\nLima to Auckland in a big, old, condemned passenger-ship turned into a\r\ncargo-boat and owned by a second-hand Italian firm. She was a crazy\r\nbasket. We were cut down to fifteen ton of coal a day, and we thought\r\nourselves lucky when we kicked seven knots an hour out of her. Then we\r\nused to stop and let the bearings cool down, and wonder whether the\r\ncrack in the shaft was spreading.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you a steward or a stoker in those days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was flush for the time being, so I was a passenger, or else I should\r\nhave been a steward, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, with perfect gravity,\r\nreturning to the procession of angry wives. \xe2\x80\x9cI was the only other\r\npassenger from Lima, and the ship was half empty, and full of rats and\r\ncockroaches and scorpions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what has this to do with the picture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute. She had been in the China passenger trade and her lower\r\ndecks had bunks for two thousand pigtails. Those were all taken down,\r\nand she was empty up to her nose, and the lights came through the port\r\nholes\xe2\x80\x94most annoying lights to work in till you got used to them. I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to do for weeks. The ship\xe2\x80\x99s charts were in pieces and\r\nour skipper daren\xe2\x80\x99t run south for fear of catching a storm. So he did\r\nhis best to knock all the Society Islands out of the water one by one,\r\nand I went into the lower deck, and did my picture on the port side as\r\nfar forward in her as I could go. There was some brown paint and some\r\ngreen paint that they used for the boats, and some black paint for\r\nironwork, and that was all I had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe passengers must have thought you mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was only one, and it was a woman; but it gave me the notion of\r\nmy picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was she like?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a sort of Negroid-Jewess-Cuban; with morals to match. She\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read or write, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to, but she used to come\r\ndown and watch me paint, and the skipper didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, because he was\r\npaying her passage and had to be on the bridge occasionally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. That must have been cheerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the best time I ever had. To begin with, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether\r\nwe should go up or go down any minute when there was a sea on; and when\r\nit was calm it was paradise; and the woman used to mix the paints and\r\ntalk broken English, and the skipper used to steal down every few\r\nminutes to the lower deck, because he said he was afraid of fire. So,\r\nyou see, we could never tell when we might be caught, and I had a\r\nsplendid notion to work out in only three keys of colour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the notion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo lines in Poe\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNeither the angels in Heaven above nor the demons down under the sea,\r\nCan ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful Annabel Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt came out of the sea\xe2\x80\x94all by itself. I drew that fight, fought out in\r\ngreen water over the naked, choking soul, and the woman served as the\r\nmodel for the devils and the angels both\xe2\x80\x94sea-devils and sea-angels, and\r\nthe soul half drowned between them. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound much, but when\r\nthere was a good light on the lower deck it looked very fine and\r\ncreepy. It was seven by fourteen feet, all done in shifting light for\r\nshifting light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the woman inspire you much?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe and the sea between them\xe2\x80\x94immensely. There was a heap of bad\r\ndrawing in that picture. I remember I went out of my way to foreshorten\r\nfor sheer delight of doing it, and I foreshortened damnably, but for\r\nall that it\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done; and now I suppose the\r\nship\xe2\x80\x99s broken up or gone down. Whew! What a time that was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all ended. They were loading her with wool when I left the ship,\r\nbut even the stevedores kept the picture clear to the last. The eyes of\r\nthe demons scared them, I honestly believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was scared too when it was finished. She used to cross herself\r\nbefore she went down to look at it. Just three colours and no chance of\r\ngetting any more, and the sea outside and unlimited love-making inside,\r\nand the fear of death atop of everything else, O Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d He had ceased\r\nto look at the sketch, but was staring straight in front of him across\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you try something of the same kind now?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause those things come not by fasting and prayer. When I find a\r\ncargo-boat and a Jewess-Cuban and another notion and the same old life,\r\nI may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t find them here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shall not.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick shut the sketch-book with a bang. \xe2\x80\x9cThis room\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nas hot as an oven. Open the window, some one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned into the darkness, watching the greater darkness of London\r\nbelow him. The chambers stood much higher than the other houses,\r\ncommanding a hundred chimneys\xe2\x80\x94crooked cowls that looked like sitting\r\ncats as they swung round, and other uncouth brick and zinc mysteries\r\nsupported by iron stanchions and clamped by 8-pieces. Northward the\r\nlights of Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square threw a\r\ncopper-coloured glare above the black roofs, and southward by all the\r\norderly lights of the Thames. A train rolled out across one of the\r\nrailway bridges, and its thunder drowned for a minute the dull roar of\r\nthe streets. The Nilghai looked at his watch and said shortly, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe Paris night-mail. You can book from here to St. Petersburg if you\r\nchoose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick crammed head and shoulders out of the window and looked across the\r\nriver. Torpenhow came to his side, while the Nilghai passed over\r\nquietly to the piano and opened it. Binkie, making himself as large as\r\npossible, spread out upon the sofa with the air of one who is not to be\r\nlightly disturbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai to the two pairs of shoulders, \xe2\x80\x9chave you never\r\nseen this place before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA steam-tug on the river hooted as she towed her barges to wharf. Then\r\nthe boom of the traffic came into the room. Torpenhow nudged Dick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood place to bank in\xe2\x80\x94bad place to bunk in, Dickie, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s chin was in his hand as he answered, in the words of a general\r\nnot without fame, still looking out on the darkness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My God, what a\r\ncity to loot!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBinkie found the night air tickling his whiskers and sneezed\r\nplaintively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall give the Binkie-dog a cold,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthey withdrew their heads. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be buried in Kensal Green, Dick, one\r\nof these days, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t closed by the time you want to go\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94buried within two feet of some one else, his wife and his\r\nfamily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah forbid! I shall get away before that time comes. Give a man room\r\nto stretch his legs, Mr. Binkie.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick flung himself down on the sofa\r\nand tweaked Binkie\xe2\x80\x99s velvet ears, yawning heavily the while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find that wardrobe-case very much out of tune,\xe2\x80\x9d Torpenhow said\r\nto the Nilghai. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s never touched except by you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA piece of gross extravagance,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick grunted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Nilghai only comes\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99re always out. Howl, Nilghai, and let him hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe life of the Nilghai is fraud and slaughter,\r\nHis writings are watered Dickens and water;\r\nBut the voice of the Nilghai raised on high\r\nMakes even the Mahdieh glad to die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nDick quoted from Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s letterpress in the Nungapunga Book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do they call moose in Canada, Nilghai?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man laughed. Singing was his one polite accomplishment, as many\r\nPress-tents in far-off lands had known.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I sing?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning in the chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cMoll Roe in the Morning,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 said Torpenhow, at a venture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, sharply, and the Nilghai opened his eyes. The old\r\nchanty whereof he, among a very few, possessed all the words was not a\r\npretty one, but Dick had heard it many times before without wincing.\r\nWithout prelude he launched into that stately tune that calls together\r\nand troubles the hearts of the gipsies of the sea\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies,\r\nFarewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nDick turned uneasily on the sofa, for he could hear the bows of the\r\nBarralong crashing into the green seas on her way to the Southern\r\nCross.\r\n\r\nThen came the chorus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll rant and we\xe2\x80\x99ll roar like true British sailors,\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll rant and we\xe2\x80\x99ll roar across the salt seas,\r\nUntil we take soundings in the Channel of Old England\r\nFrom Ushant to Scilly \xe2\x80\x99tis forty-five leagues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-five-thirty-five,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, petulantly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tamper with\r\nHoly Writ. Go on, Nilghai.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first land we made it was called the Deadman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nand they sang to the end very vigourously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a better song if her head were turned the other way\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nthe Ushant light, for instance,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlinging his arms about like a mad windmill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cGive us\r\nsomething else, Nilghai. You\xe2\x80\x99re in fine fog-horn form tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us the \xe2\x80\x9cGanges Pilot\xe2\x80\x9d; you sang that in the square the night\r\nbefore El-Maghrib. By the way, I wonder how many of the chorus are\r\nalive to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow considered for a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! I believe only you and I.\r\n\r\nRaynor, Vicery, and Deenes\xe2\x80\x94all dead; Vincent caught smallpox in Cairo,\r\ncarried it here and died of it. Yes, only you and I and the Nilghai.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmph! And yet the men here who\xe2\x80\x99ve done their work in a well-warmed\r\nstudio all their lives, with a policeman at each corner, say that I\r\ncharge too much for my pictures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are buying your work, not your insurance policies, dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gambled with one to get at the other. Don\xe2\x80\x99t preach. Go on with the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPilot.\xe2\x80\x9d Where in the world did you get that song?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn a tombstone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai. \xe2\x80\x9cOn a tombstone in a distant land.\r\nI made it an accompaniment with heaps of base chords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Vanity! Begin.\xe2\x80\x9d And the Nilghai began\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have slipped my cable, messmates, I\xe2\x80\x99m drifting down with the tide,\r\nI have my sailing orders, while yet an anchor ride.\r\nAnd never on fair June morning have I put out to sea\r\nWith clearer conscience or better hope, or a heart more light and free.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShoulder to shoulder, Joe, my boy, into the crowd like a wedge\r\nStrike with the hangers, messmates, but do not cut with the edge.\r\nCries Charnock, \xe2\x80\x9cScatter the faggots, double that Brahmin in two,\r\nThe tall pale widow for me, Joe, the little brown girl for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Joe (you\xe2\x80\x99re nearing sixty), why is your hide so dark?\r\nKatie has soft fair blue eyes, who blackened yours?\xe2\x80\x94Why, hark!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were all singing now, Dick with the roar of the wind of the open\r\nsea about his ears as the deep bass voice let itself go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe morning gun\xe2\x80\x94Ho, steady! the arquebuses to me!\r\nI ha\xe2\x80\x99 sounded the Dutch High Admiral\xe2\x80\x99s heart as my lead doth sound the\r\nsea.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSounding, sounding the Ganges, floating down with the tide,\r\nMoore me close to Charnock, next to my nut-brown bride.\r\nMy blessing to Kate at Fairlight\xe2\x80\x94Holwell, my thanks to you;\r\nSteady! We steer for heaven, through sand-drifts cold and blue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow what is there in that nonsense to make a man restless?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick,\r\nhauling Binkie from his feet to his chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends on the man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who has been down to look at the sea,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know she was going to upset me in this fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what men say when they go to say good-bye to a woman. It\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\neasy though to get rid of three women than a piece of one\xe2\x80\x99s life and\r\nsurroundings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut a woman can be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Dick, unguardedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA piece of one\xe2\x80\x99s life,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, she can\xe2\x80\x99t. His face\r\ndarkened for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cShe says she wants to sympathise with you and\r\nhelp you in your work, and everything else that clearly a man must do\r\nfor himself. Then she sends round five notes a day to ask why the\r\ndickens you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been wasting your time with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t generalise,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the time you arrive at five\r\nnotes a day you must have gone through a good deal and behaved\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t begin these things, my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone down to the sea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, just a little\r\nanxious to change the conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sung.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sea isn\xe2\x80\x99t sending you five notes a day,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I\xe2\x80\x99m fatally compromised. She\xe2\x80\x99s an enduring old hag, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsorry I ever met her. Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I born and bred and dead in a\r\nthree-pair back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear him blaspheming his first love! Why in the world shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nlisten to her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\nBefore Dick could reply the Nilghai lifted up his voice with a shout\r\nthat shook the windows, in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Men of the Sea,\xe2\x80\x9d that begins, as all\r\nknow, \xe2\x80\x9cThe sea is a wicked old woman,\xe2\x80\x9d and after rading through eight\r\nlines whose imagery is truthful, ends in a refrain, slow as the\r\nclacking of a capstan when the boat comes unwillingly up to the bars\r\nwhere the men sweat and tramp in the shingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ye that bore us, O restore us!\r\nShe is kinder than ye;\r\nFor the call is on our heart-strings!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSaid The Men of the Sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nilghai sang that verse twice, with simple cunning, intending that\r\nDick should hear. But Dick was waiting for the farewell of the men to\r\ntheir wives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ye that love us, can ye move us?\r\nShe is dearer than ye;\r\nAnd your sleep will be the sweeter,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSaid The Men of the Sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rough words beat like the blows of the waves on the bows of the\r\nrickety boat from Lima in the days when Dick was mixing paints, making\r\nlove, drawing devils and angels in the half dark, and wondering whether\r\nthe next minute would put the Italian captain\xe2\x80\x99s knife between his\r\nshoulder-blades. And the go-fever which is more real than many doctors\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndiseases, waked and raged, urging him who loved Maisie beyond anything\r\nin the world, to go away and taste the old hot, unregenerate life\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x94to scuffle, swear, gamble, and love light loves with his\r\nfellows; to take ship and know the sea once more, and by her beget\r\npictures; to talk to Binat among the sands of Port Said while Yellow\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTina mixed the drinks; to hear the crackle of musketry, and see the\r\nsmoke roll outward, thin and thicken again till the shining black faces\r\ncame through, and in that hell every man was strictly responsible for\r\nhis own head, and his own alone, and struck with an unfettered arm. It\r\nwas impossible, utterly impossible, but\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, our fathers in the churchyard,\r\nShe is older than ye,\r\nAnd our graves will be the greener,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSaid The Men of the Sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ there to hinder?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, in the long hush that\r\nfollowed the song.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said a little time since that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come for a walk round\r\nthe world, Torp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was months ago, and I only objected to your making money for\r\ntravelling expenses. You\xe2\x80\x99ve shot your bolt here and it has gone home.\r\nGo away and do some work, and see some things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet some of the fat off you; you\xe2\x80\x99re disgracefully out of condition,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Nilghai, making a plunge from the chair and grasping a handful\r\nof Dick generally over the right ribs. \xe2\x80\x9cSoft as putty\xe2\x80\x94pure tallow born\r\nof over-feeding. Train it off, Dickie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all equally gross, Nilghai. Next time you have to take the field\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down, wink your eyes, gasp, and die in a fit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. You go away on a ship. Go to Lima again, or to Brazil.\r\n\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s always trouble in South America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose I want to be told where to go? Great Heavens, the only\r\ndifficulty is to know where I\xe2\x80\x99m to stop. But I shall stay here, as I\r\ntold you before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll be buried in Kensal Green and turn into adipocere with the\r\nothers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you thinking of commissions in hand? Pay\r\nforfeit and go. You\xe2\x80\x99ve money enough to travel as a king if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve the grisliest notions of amusement, Torp. I think I see myself\r\nshipping first class on a six-thousand-ton hotel, and asking the third\r\nengineer what makes the engines go round, and whether it isn\xe2\x80\x99t very\r\nwarm in the stokehold. Ho! ho! I should ship as a loafer if ever I\r\nshipped at all, which I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do. I shall compromise, and go\r\nfor a small trip to begin with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s something at any rate. Where will you go?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwould do you all the good in the world, old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Nilghai saw the twinkle in Dick\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and refrained from speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go in the first place to Rathray\xe2\x80\x99s stable, where I shall hire\r\none horse, and take him very carefully as far as Richmond Hill. Then I\r\nshall walk him back again, in case he should accidentally burst into a\r\nlather and make Rathray angry. I shall do that to-morrow, for the sake\r\nof air and exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d Dick had barely time to throw up his arm and ward off the\r\ncushion that the disgusted Torpenhow heaved at his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAir and exercise indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai, sitting down heavily on\r\nDick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s give him a little of both. Get the bellows, Torp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point the conference broke up in disorder, because Dick would\r\nnot open his mouth till the Nilghai held his nose fast, and there was\r\nsome trouble in forcing the nozzle of the bellows between his teeth;\r\nand even when it was there he weakly tried to puff against the force of\r\nthe blast, and his cheeks blew up with a great explosion; and the enemy\r\nbecoming helpless with laughter he so beat them over the head with a\r\nsoft sofa cushion that that became unsewn and distributed its feathers,\r\nand Binkie, interfering in Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s interests, was bundled into the\r\nhalf-empty bag and advised to scratch his way out, which he did after a\r\nwhile, travelling rapidly up and down the floor in the shape of an\r\nagitated green haggis, and when he came out looking for satisfaction,\r\nthe three pillars of his world were picking feathers out of their hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA prophet has no honour in his own country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, ruefully,\r\ndusting his knees. \xe2\x80\x9cThis filthy fluff will never brush off my legs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all for your own good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing like air and\r\nexercise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll for your good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, not in the least with reference to\r\npast clowning. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would let you focus things at their proper worth and\r\nprevent your becoming slack in this hothouse of a town. Indeed it\r\nwould, old man. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spoken if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought so. Only,\r\nyou make a joke of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore God I do no such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, quickly and earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know me if you think that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t think it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can fellows like ourselves, who know what life and death really\r\nmean, dare to make a joke of anything? I know we pretend it, to save\r\nourselves from breaking down or going to the other extreme. Can\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nsee, old man, how you\xe2\x80\x99re always anxious about me, and try to advise me\r\nto make my work better? Do you suppose I don\xe2\x80\x99t think about that myself?\r\nBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t help me\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t help me\xe2\x80\x94not even you. I must play my\r\nown hand alone in my own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear,\xe2\x80\x9d from the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the one thing in the Nilghai Saga that I\xe2\x80\x99ve never drawn in the\r\nNungapunga Book?\xe2\x80\x9d Dick continued to Torpenhow, who was a little\r\nastonished at the outburst.\r\n\r\nNow there was one blank page in the book given over to the sketch that\r\nDick had not drawn of the crowning exploit in the Nilghai\xe2\x80\x99s life; when\r\nthat man, being young and forgetting that his body and bones belonged\r\nto the paper that employed him, had ridden over sunburned slippery\r\ngrass in the rear of Bredow\xe2\x80\x99s brigade on the day that the troopers\r\nflung themselves at Caurobert\xe2\x80\x99s artillery, and for aught they knew\r\ntwenty battalions in front, to save the battered 24th German Infantry,\r\nto give time to decide the fate of Vionville, and to learn ere their\r\nremnant came back to Flavigay that cavalry can attack and crumple and\r\nbreak unshaken infantry. Whenever he was inclined to think over a life\r\nthat might have been better, an income that might have been larger, and\r\na soul that might have been considerably cleaner, the Nilghai would\r\ncomfort himself with the thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI rode with Bredow\xe2\x80\x99s brigade at\r\nVionville,\xe2\x80\x9d and take heart for any lesser battle the next day might\r\nbring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said very gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cI was always glad that you left it\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left it out because Nilghai taught me what the Germany army learned\r\nthen, and what Schmidt taught their cavalry. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know German.\r\n\r\nWhat is it? \xe2\x80\x9cTake care of the time and the dressing will take care of\r\nitself.\xe2\x80\x9d I must ride my own line to my own beat, old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Tempo ist richtung_. You\xe2\x80\x99ve learned your lesson well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nNilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must go alone. He speaks truth, Torp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I\xe2\x80\x99m as wrong as I can be\xe2\x80\x94hideously wrong. I must find that out\r\nfor myself, as I have to think things out for myself, but I daren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nturn my head to dress by the next man. It hurts me a great deal more\r\nthan you know not to be able to go, but I cannot, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. I must do\r\nmy own work and live my own life in my own way, because I\xe2\x80\x99m responsible\r\nfor both.\r\n\r\nOnly don\xe2\x80\x99t think I frivol about it, Torp. I have my own matches and\r\nsulphur, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make my own hell, thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an uncomfortable pause. Then Torpenhow said blandly, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndid the Governor of North Carolina say to the Governor of South\r\nCarolina?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent notion. It is a long time between drinks. There are the\r\nmakings of a very fine prig in you, Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve liberated my mind, estimable Binkie, with the feathers in his\r\nmouth.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick picked up the still indignant one and shook him tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re tied up in a sack and made to run about blind, Binkie-wee,\r\nwithout any reason, and it has hurt your little feelings. Never mind.\r\n_Sic volo, sic jubeo, stet pro ratione voluntas_, and don\xe2\x80\x99t sneeze in\r\nmy eye because I talk Latin. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s distinctly one for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you it was\r\nhopeless to meddle with him. He\xe2\x80\x99s not pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d swear at me if he weren\xe2\x80\x99t. I can\xe2\x80\x99t make it out. He has the\r\ngo-fever upon him and he won\xe2\x80\x99t go. I only hope that he mayn\xe2\x80\x99t have to\r\ngo some day when he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his own room Dick was settling a question with himself\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nquestion was whether all the world, and all that was therein, and a\r\nburning desire to exploit both, was worth one threepenny piece thrown\r\ninto the Thames.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came of seeing the sea, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a cur to think about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, the honeymoon will be that tour\xe2\x80\x94with reservations; only...\r\nonly I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise that the sea was so strong. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel it so\r\nmuch when I was with Maisie. These damnable songs did it. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeginning again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was only Herrick\xe2\x80\x99s Nightpiece to Julia that the Nilghai sang,\r\nand before it was ended Dick reappeared on the threshold, not\r\naltogether clothed indeed, but in his right mind, thirsty and at peace.\r\n\r\nThe mood had come and gone with the rising and the falling of the tide\r\nby Fort Keeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I have taken the common clay\r\n    And wrought it cunningly\r\nIn the shape of a god that was digged a clod,\r\n    The greater honour to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou hast taken the common clay,\r\n    And thy hands be not free\r\nFrom the taint of the soil, thou hast made thy spoil\r\n    The greater shame to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_The Two Potters_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe did no work of any kind for the rest of the week. Then came another\r\nSunday. He dreaded and longed for the day always, but since the\r\nred-haired girl had sketched him there was rather more dread than\r\ndesire in his mind.\r\n\r\nHe found that Maisie had entirely neglected his suggestions about\r\nline-work. She had gone off at score filled with some absurd notion for\r\na \xe2\x80\x9cfancy head.\xe2\x80\x9d It cost Dick something to command his temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of suggesting anything?\xe2\x80\x9d he said pointedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but this will be a picture,\xe2\x80\x94a real picture; and I know that Kami\r\nwill let me send it to the Salon. You don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose not. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t have time for the Salon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie hesitated a little. She even felt uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going over to France a month sooner because of it. I shall get\r\nthe idea sketched out here and work it up at Kami\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s heart stood still, and he came very near to being disgusted with\r\nhis queen who could do no wrong. \xe2\x80\x9cJust when I thought I had made some\r\nheadway, she goes off chasing butterflies. It\xe2\x80\x99s too maddening!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no possibility of arguing, for the red-haired girl was in the\r\nstudio. Dick could only look unutterable reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think you make a mistake. But what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nidea of your new picture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took it from a book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s bad, to begin with. Books aren\xe2\x80\x99t the places for pictures.\r\nAnd\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the red-haired girl behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cI was reading it to\r\nMaisie the other day from _The City of Dreadful Night_. D\xe2\x80\x99you know the\r\nbook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little. I am sorry I spoke. There are pictures in it. What has taken\r\nher fancy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe description of the Melancolia\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer folded wings as of a mighty eagle,\r\nBut all too impotent to lift the regal\r\nRobustness of her earth-born strength and pride.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here again. (Maisie, get the tea, dear.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe forehead charged with baleful thoughts and dreams,\r\nThe household bunch of keys, the housewife\xe2\x80\x99s gown,\r\n    Voluminous indented, and yet rigid\r\n    As though a shell of burnished metal frigid,\r\nHer feet thick-shod to tread all weakness down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no attempt to conceal the scorn of the lazy voice. Dick\r\nwinced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that has been done already by an obscure artist by the name of\r\nDurer,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does the poem run?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree centuries and threescore years ago,\r\nWith phantasies of his peculiar thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might as well try to rewrite _Hamlet_. It will be a waste of time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, putting down the teacups with a clatter to\r\nreassure herself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I mean to do it. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see what a beautiful\r\nthing it would make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow in perdition can one do work when one hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had the proper\r\ntraining? Any fool can get a notion. It needs training to drive the\r\nthing through,\xe2\x80\x94training and conviction; not rushing after the first\r\nfancy.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick spoke between his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I can do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the voice of the girl behind him\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaffled and beaten back, she works on still;\r\n    Weary and sick of soul, she works the more.\r\nSustained by her indomitable will,\r\n    The hands shall fashion, and the brain shall pore,\r\nAnd all her sorrow shall be turned to labour\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nI fancy Maisie means to embody herself in the picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSitting on a throne of rejected pictures? No, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t, dear. The\r\nnotion in itself has fascinated me.\xe2\x80\x94Of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t care for fancy\r\nheads, Dick.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you could do them. You like blood and bones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a direct challenge. If you can do a Melancolia that isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmerely a sorrowful female head, I can do a better one; and I will, too.\r\nWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you know about Melacolias?\xe2\x80\x9d Dick firmly believed that he was\r\neven then tasting three-quarters of all the sorrow in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, \xe2\x80\x9cand she suffered a great deal,\xe2\x80\x94till\r\nshe could suffer no more. Then she began to laugh at it all, and then I\r\npainted her and sent her to the Salon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe red-haired girl rose up and left the room, laughing.\r\n\r\nDick looked at Maisie humbly and hopelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind about the picture,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you really going back to\r\nKami\xe2\x80\x99s for a month before your time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must, if I want to get the picture done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s all you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be stupid, Dick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t the power. You have only the ideas\xe2\x80\x94the ideas and the\r\nlittle cheap impulses. How you could have kept at your work for ten\r\nyears steadily is a mystery to me. So you are really going,\xe2\x80\x94a month\r\nbefore you need?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must do my work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour work\xe2\x80\x94bah!... No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, dear. Of\r\ncourse you must do your work, and\xe2\x80\x94I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll say good-bye for this\r\nweek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you even stay for tea? \xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you. Have I your leave to go,\r\ndear? There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more you particularly want me to do, and the\r\nline-work doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you could stay, and then we could talk over my picture. If only\r\none single picture\xe2\x80\x99s a success, it draws attention to all the others. I\r\nknow some of my work is good, if only people could see. And you needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave been so rude about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk the Melancolia over some one of the other\r\nSundays.\r\n\r\nThere are four more\xe2\x80\x94yes, one, two, three, four\xe2\x80\x94before you go. Good-bye,\r\nMaisie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie stood by the studio window, thinking, till the red-haired girl\r\nreturned, a little white at the corners of her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick\xe2\x80\x99s gone off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie. \xe2\x80\x9cJust when I wanted to talk about the\r\npicture. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it selfish of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion opened her lips as if to speak, shut them again, and went\r\non reading _The City of Dreadful Night_.\r\n\r\nDick was in the Park, walking round and round a tree that he had chosen\r\nas his confidante for many Sundays past. He was swearing audibly, and\r\nwhen he found that the infirmities of the English tongue hemmed in his\r\nrage, he sought consolation in Arabic, which is expressly designed for\r\nthe use of the afflicted. He was not pleased with the reward of his\r\npatient service; nor was he pleased with himself; and it was long\r\nbefore he arrived at the proposition that the queen could do no wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a losing game,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m worth nothing when a whim of hers\r\nis in question. But in a losing game at Port Said we used to double the\r\nstakes and go on. She do a Melancolia! She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the power, or the\r\ninsight, or the training. Only the desire. She\xe2\x80\x99s cursed with the curse\r\nof Reuben. She won\xe2\x80\x99t do line-work, because it means real work; and yet\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s stronger than I am. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make her understand that I can beat her\r\non her own Melancolia. Even then she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care. She says I can only\r\ndo blood and bones. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she has blood in her veins. All the\r\nsame I love her; and I must go on loving her; and if I can humble her\r\ninordinate vanity I will. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a Melancolia that shall be something\r\nlike a Melancolia\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe Melancolia that transcends all wit.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it\r\nat once, con\xe2\x80\x94bless her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe discovered that the notion would not come to order, and that he\r\ncould not free his mind for an hour from the thought of Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture. He took very small interest in her rough studies for the\r\nMelancolia when she showed them next week. The Sundays were racing\r\npast, and the time was at hand when all the church bells in London\r\ncould not ring Maisie back to him. Once or twice he said something to\r\nBinkie about \xe2\x80\x9chermaphroditic futilities,\xe2\x80\x9d but the little dog received\r\nso many confidences both from Torpenhow and Dick that he did not\r\ntrouble his tulip-ears to listen.\r\n\r\nDick was permitted to see the girls off. They were going by the Dover\r\nnight-boat; and they hoped to return in August. It was then February,\r\nand Dick felt that he was being hardly used. Maisie was so busy\r\nstripping the small house across the Park, and packing her canvases,\r\nthat she had not time for thought. Dick went down to Dover and wasted a\r\nday there fretting over a wonderful possibility. Would Maisie at the\r\nvery last allow him one small kiss? He reflected that he might capture\r\nher by the strong arm, as he had seem women captured in the Southern\r\nSoudan, and lead her away; but Maisie would never be led. She would\r\nturn her gray eyes upon him and say, \xe2\x80\x9cDick, how selfish you are!\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nhis courage would fail him. It would be better, after all, to beg for\r\nthat kiss.\r\n\r\nMaisie looked more than usually kissable as she stepped from the\r\nnight-mail on to the windy pier, in a gray waterproof and a little gray\r\ncloth travelling-cap. The red-haired girl was not so lovely. Her green\r\neyes were hollow and her lips were dry. Dick saw the trunks aboard, and\r\nwent to Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s side in the darkness under the bridge. The mail-bags\r\nwere thundering into the forehold, and the red-haired girl was watching\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a rough passage to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s blowing\r\noutside. I suppose I may come over and see you if I\xe2\x80\x99m good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t. I shall be busy. At least, if I want you I\xe2\x80\x99ll send for\r\nyou. But I shall write from Vitry-sur-Marne. I shall have heaps of\r\nthings to consult you about. Oh, Dick, you have been so good to me!\xe2\x80\x94so\r\ngood to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for that, dear. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made any difference, has it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell a fib. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94in that way. But don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ngrateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn the gratitude!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, huskily, to the paddle-box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of worrying? You know I should ruin your life, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d ruin mine, as things are now. You remember what you said when you\r\nwere so angry that day in the Park? One of us has to be broken.\r\n\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t you wait till that day comes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, love. I want you unbroken\xe2\x80\x94all to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Dick, what can I say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. Give me a kiss. Only one kiss, Maisie. I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t take any more. You might as well, and then I can be sure you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngrateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie put her cheek forward, and Dick took his reward in the darkness.\r\n\r\nIt was only one kiss, but, since there was no time-limit specified, it\r\nwas a long one. Maisie wrenched herself free angrily, and Dick stood\r\nabashed and tingling from head to toe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, darling. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to scare you. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Only\xe2\x80\x94keep\r\nwell and do good work,\xe2\x80\x94specially the Melancolia. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do one,\r\ntoo. Remember me to Kami, and be careful what you drink. Country\r\ndrinking-water is bad everywhere, but it\xe2\x80\x99s worse in France. Write to me\r\nif you want anything, and good-bye. Say good-bye to the\r\nwhatever-you-call-um girl, and\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t I have another kiss? No. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nquite right. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shout told him that it was not seemly to charge up the mail-bag\r\nincline. He reached the pier as the steamer began to move off, and he\r\nfollowed her with his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\xe2\x80\x94nothing in the wide world\xe2\x80\x94to keep us apart except\r\nher obstinacy. These Calais night-boats are much too small. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nTorp to write to the papers about it. She\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to pitch\r\nalready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie stood where Dick had left her till she heard a little gasping\r\ncough at her elbow. The red-haired girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were alight with cold\r\nflame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe kissed you!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow could you let him, when he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanything to you? How dared you to take a kiss from him? Oh, Maisie,\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s go to the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 cabin. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick,\xe2\x80\x94deadly sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe aren\xe2\x80\x99t into open water yet. Go down, dear, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like the smell of the engines.... Poor Dick! He deserved\r\none,\xe2\x80\x94only one.\r\n\r\nBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99d frighten me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick returned to town next day just in time for lunch, for which he had\r\ntelegraphed. To his disgust, there were only empty plates in the\r\nstudio.\r\n\r\nHe lifted up his voice like the bears in the fairy-tale, and Torpenhow\r\nentered, looking guilty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99sh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make such a noise. I took it. Come into my\r\nrooms, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick paused amazed at the threshold, for on Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s sofa lay a girl\r\nasleep and breathing heavily. The little cheap sailor-hat, the\r\nblue-and-white dress, fitter for June than for February, dabbled with\r\nmud at the skirts, the jacket trimmed with imitation Astrakhan and\r\nripped at the shoulder-seams, the one-and-elevenpenny umbrella, and,\r\nabove all, the disgraceful condition of the kid-topped boots, declared\r\nall things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I say, old man, this is too bad! You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t bring this sort up\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThey steal things from the rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks bad, I admit, but I was coming in after lunch, and she\r\nstaggered into the hall. I thought she was drunk at first, but it was\r\ncollapse. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave her as she was, so I brought her up here and\r\ngave her your lunch. She was fainting from want of food. She went fast\r\nasleep the minute she had finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know something of that complaint. She\xe2\x80\x99s been living on sausages, I\r\nsuppose. Torp, you should have handed her over to a policeman for\r\npresuming to faint in a respectable house. Poor little wretch! Look at\r\nthe face! There isn\xe2\x80\x99t an ounce of immorality in it. Only folly,\xe2\x80\x94slack,\r\nfatuous, feeble, futile folly. It\xe2\x80\x99s a typical head. D\xe2\x80\x99you notice how\r\nthe skull begins to show through the flesh padding on the face and\r\ncheek-bone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a cold-blooded barbarian it is! Don\xe2\x80\x99t hit a woman when she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndown. Can\xe2\x80\x99t we do anything? She was simply dropping with starvation.\r\n\r\nShe almost fell into my arms, and when she got to the food she ate like\r\na wild beast. It was horrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can give her money, which she would probably spend in drinks. Is she\r\ngoing to sleep for ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl opened her eyes and glared at the men between terror and\r\neffrontery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeeling better?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Thank you. There aren\xe2\x80\x99t many gentlemen that are as kind as you\r\nare. Thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you leave service?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, who had been watching the\r\nscarred and chapped hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know I was in service? I was. General servant. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you like being your own mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I look as if I liked it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose not. One moment. Would you be good enough to turn your face\r\nto the window?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl obeyed, and Dick watched her face keenly,\xe2\x80\x94so keenly that she\r\nmade as if to hide behind Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe eyes have it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, walking up and down. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are superb\r\neyes for my business. And, after all, every head depends on the eyes.\r\nThis has been sent from heaven to make up for\xe2\x80\x94what was taken away. Now\r\nthe weekly strain\xe2\x80\x99s off my shoulders, I can get to work in earnest.\r\n\r\nEvidently sent from heaven. Yes. Raise your chin a little, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, old man, gently. You\xe2\x80\x99re scaring somebody out of her wits,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Torpenhow, who could see the girl trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let him hit me! Oh, please don\xe2\x80\x99t let him hit me! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hit\r\ncruel to-day because I spoke to a man. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let him look at me like\r\nthat! He\xe2\x80\x99s reg\xe2\x80\x99lar wicked, that one. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let him look at me like\r\nthat, neither! Oh, I feel as if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing on when he looks at me\r\nlike that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe overstrained nerves in the frail body gave way, and the girl wept\r\nlike a little child and began to scream. Dick threw open the window,\r\nand Torpenhow flung the door back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend here can call for a\r\npoliceman, and you can run through that door. Nobody is going to hurt\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl sobbed convulsively for a few minutes, and then tried to\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing in the world to hurt you. Now listen to me for a minute. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nwhat they call an artist by profession. You know what artists do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey draw the things in red and black ink on the pop-shop labels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t risen to pop-shop labels yet. Those are done by\r\nthe Academicians. I want to draw your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty. That is why you will come to the room across the\r\nlanding three times a week at eleven in the morning, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you\r\nthree quid a week just for sitting still and being drawn. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nquid on account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor nothing? Oh, my!\xe2\x80\x9d The girl turned the sovereign in her hand, and\r\nwith more foolish tears, \xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t neither o\xe2\x80\x99 you two gentlemen afraid of\r\nmy bilking you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Only ugly girls do that. Try and remember this place. And, by the\r\nway, what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Bessie,\xe2\x80\x94Bessie\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 It\xe2\x80\x99s no use giving the rest. Bessie\r\nBroke,\xe2\x80\x94Stone-broke, if you like. What\xe2\x80\x99s your names? But there,\xe2\x80\x94no one\r\never gives the real ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick consulted Torpenhow with his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name\xe2\x80\x99s Heldar, and my friend\xe2\x80\x99s called Torpenhow; and you must be\r\nsure to come here. Where do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSouth-the-water,\xe2\x80\x94one room,\xe2\x80\x94five and sixpence a week. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you making\r\nfun of me about that three quid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see later on. And, Bessie, next time you come, remember, you\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t wear that paint. It\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the skin, and I have all the\r\ncolours you\xe2\x80\x99ll be likely to need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie withdrew, scrubbing her cheek with a ragged pocket-handkerchief.\r\nThe two men looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a fool. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t our business to run about the\r\nearth reforming Bessie Brokes. And a woman of any kind has no right on\r\nthis landing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she won\xe2\x80\x99t come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will if she thinks she can get food and warmth here. I know she\r\nwill, worse luck. But remember, old man, she isn\xe2\x80\x99t a woman; she\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nmodel; and be careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea! She\xe2\x80\x99s a dissolute little scarecrow,\xe2\x80\x94a gutter-snippet and\r\nnothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you think. Wait till she has been fed a little and freed from fear.\r\nThat fair type recovers itself very quickly. You won\xe2\x80\x99t know her in a\r\nweek or two, when that abject fear has died out of her eyes. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\ntoo happy and smiling for my purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you\xe2\x80\x99re not taking her out of charity?\xe2\x80\x94to please me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in the habit of playing with hot coals to please anybody. She\r\nhas been sent from heaven, as I may have remarked before, to help me\r\nwith my Melancolia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever heard a word about the lady before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of having a friend, if you must sling your notions at\r\nhim in words? You ought to know what I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about. You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard\r\nme grunt lately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so; but grunts mean anything in your language, from bad \xe2\x80\x9cbaccy to\r\nwicked dealers. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been much in your confidence for\r\nsome time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a high and soulful grunt. You ought to have understood that it\r\nmeant the Melancolia.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick walked Torpenhow up and down the room,\r\nkeeping silence. Then he smote him in the ribs, \xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ don\xe2\x80\x99t you see\r\nit? Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s abject futility, and the terror in her eyes, welded on to\r\none or two details in the way of sorrow that have come under my\r\nexperience lately. Likewise some orange and black,\xe2\x80\x94two keys of each.\r\nBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain on an empty stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds mad enough. You\xe2\x80\x99d better stick to your soldiers, Dick,\r\ninstead of maundering about heads and eyes and experiences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink so?\xe2\x80\x9d Dick began to dance on his heels, singing\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re as proud as a turkey when they hold the ready cash,\r\n    You ought to \xe2\x80\x99ear the way they laugh an\xe2\x80\x99 joke;\r\nThey are tricky an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99re funny when they\xe2\x80\x99ve got the ready money,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Ow! but see \xe2\x80\x99em when they\xe2\x80\x99re all stone-broke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he sat down to pour out his heart to Maisie in a four-sheet letter\r\nof counsel and encouragement, and registered an oath that he would get\r\nto work with an undivided heart as soon as Bessie should reappear.\r\n\r\nThe girl kept her appointment unpainted and unadorned, afraid and\r\noverbold by turns. When she found that she was merely expected to sit\r\nstill, she grew calmer, and criticised the appointments of the studio\r\nwith freedom and some point. She liked the warmth and the comfort and\r\nthe release from fear of physical pain. Dick made two or three studies\r\nof her head in monochrome, but the actual notion of the Melancolia\r\nwould not arrive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a mess you keep your things in!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie, some days later,\r\nwhen she felt herself thoroughly at home. \xe2\x80\x9cI s\xe2\x80\x99pose your clothes are\r\njust as bad.\r\n\r\nGentlemen never think what buttons and tape are made for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI buy things to wear, and wear \xe2\x80\x99em till they go to pieces. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what Torpenhow does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie made diligent inquiry in the latter\xe2\x80\x99s room, and unearthed a bale\r\nof disreputable socks. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of these I\xe2\x80\x99ll mend now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nsome I\xe2\x80\x99ll take home. D\xe2\x80\x99you know, I sit all day long at home doing\r\nnothing, just like a lady, and no more noticing them other girls in the\r\nhouse than if they was so many flies. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any unnecessary\r\nwords, but I put \xe2\x80\x99em down quick, I can tell you, when they talk to me.\r\nNo; it\xe2\x80\x99s quite nice these days. I lock my door, and they can only call\r\nme names through the keyhole, and I sit inside, just like a lady,\r\nmending socks. Mr. Torpenhow wears his socks out both ends at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree quid a week from me, and the delights of my society. No socks\r\nmended. Nothing from Torp except a nod on the landing now and again,\r\nand all his socks mended. Bessie is very much a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Dick;\r\nand he looked at her between half-shut eyes. Food and rest had\r\ntransformed the girl, as Dick knew they would.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you looking at me like that for?\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nYou look reg\xe2\x80\x99lar bad when you look that way. You don\xe2\x80\x99t think much o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nme, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends on how you behave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie behaved beautifully. Only it was difficult at the end of a\r\nsitting to bid her go out into the gray streets. She very much\r\npreferred the studio and a big chair by the stove, with some socks in\r\nher lap as an excuse for delay. Then Torpenhow would come in, and\r\nBessie would be moved to tell strange and wonderful stories of her\r\npast, and still stranger ones of her present improved circumstances.\r\nShe would make them tea as though she had a right to make it; and once\r\nor twice on these occasions Dick caught Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fixed on the\r\ntrim little figure, and because Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s flittings about the room made\r\nDick ardently long for Maisie, he realised whither Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts\r\nwere tending. And Bessie was exceedingly careful of the condition of\r\nTorpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s linen. She spoke very little to him, but sometimes they\r\ntalked together on the landing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a great fool,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what red firelight\r\nlooks like when a man\xe2\x80\x99s tramping through a strange town; and ours is a\r\nlonely, selfish sort of life at the best. I wonder Maisie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel\r\nthat sometimes. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t order Bessie away. That\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of\r\nbeginning things. One never knows where they stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne evening, after a sitting prolonged to the last limit of the light,\r\nDick was roused from a nap by a broken voice in Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s room. He\r\njumped to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cNow what ought I to do? It looks foolish to go\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x94Oh, bless you, Binkie!\xe2\x80\x9d The little terrier thrust Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s door\r\nopen with his nose and came out to take possession of Dick\xe2\x80\x99s chair. The\r\ndoor swung wide unheeded, and Dick across the landing could see Bessie\r\nin the half-light making her little supplication to Torpenhow. She was\r\nkneeling by his side, and her hands were clasped across his knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x94I know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said thickly. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t right o\xe2\x80\x99 me to do this,\r\nbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it; and you were so kind,\xe2\x80\x94so kind; and you never took\r\nany notice o\xe2\x80\x99 me. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve mended all your things so carefully,\xe2\x80\x94I did.\r\nOh, please, \xe2\x80\x99tisn\xe2\x80\x99t as if I was asking you to marry me. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink of it.\r\n\r\nBut you\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you take and live with me till Miss Right comes along?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m only Miss Wrong, I know, but I\xe2\x80\x99d work my hands to the bare bone for\r\nyou. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not ugly to look at. Say you will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick hardly recognised Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s voice in reply\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut look here. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno use. I\xe2\x80\x99m liable to be ordered off anywhere at a minute\xe2\x80\x99s notice if a\r\nwar breaks out. At a minute\xe2\x80\x99s notice\xe2\x80\x94dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that matter? Until you go, then. Until you go. \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t much\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m asking, and\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how good I can cook.\xe2\x80\x9d She had put an arm\r\nround his neck and was drawing his head down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94go, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTorp,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, across the landing. He could hardly steady his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here a minute, old man. I\xe2\x80\x99m in trouble\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven send he\xe2\x80\x99ll listen\r\nto me!\xe2\x80\x9d There was something very like an oath from Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s lips. She\r\nwas afraid of Dick, and disappeared down the staircase in panic, but it\r\nseemed an age before Torpenhow entered the studio. He went to the\r\nmantelpiece, buried his head on his arms, and groaned like a wounded\r\nbull.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil right have you to interfere?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s interfering with which? Your own sense told you long ago you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be such a fool. It was a tough rack, St. Anthony, but you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have seen her moving about these rooms as if they\r\nbelonged to her. That\xe2\x80\x99s what upset me. It gives a lonely man a sort of\r\nhankering, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, piteously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you talk sense. It does. But, since you aren\xe2\x80\x99t in a condition to\r\ndiscuss the disadvantages of double housekeeping, do you know what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t. I wish I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going away for a season on a brilliant tour to regain tone.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to Brighton, or Scarborough, or Prawle Point, to see the\r\nships go by. And you\xe2\x80\x99re going at once. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it odd? I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of\r\nBinkie, but out you go immediately. Never resist the devil. He holds\r\nthe bank. Fly from him. Pack your things and go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you\xe2\x80\x99re right. Where shall I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you call yourself a special correspondent! Pack first and inquire\r\nafterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn hour later Torpenhow was despatched into the night for a hansom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll probably think of some place to go to while you\xe2\x80\x99re moving,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cOn to Euston, to begin with, and\xe2\x80\x94oh yes\xe2\x80\x94get drunk\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe returned to the studio, and lighted more candles, for he found the\r\nroom very dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you Jezebel! you futile little Jezebel! Won\xe2\x80\x99t you hate me\r\nto-morrow!\xe2\x80\x94Binkie, come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBinkie turned over on his back on the hearth-rug, and Dick stirred him\r\nwith a meditative foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said she was not immoral. I was wrong. She said she could cook. That\r\nshowed premeditated sin. Oh, Binkie, if you are a man you will go to\r\nperdition; but if you are a woman, and say that you can cook, you will\r\ngo to a much worse place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s you that follows at my side?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    The foe that ye must fight, my lord.\xe2\x80\x94\r\nThat hirples swift as I can ride?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    The shadow of the night, my lord.\xe2\x80\x94\r\nThen wheel my horse against the foe!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    He\xe2\x80\x99s down and overpast, my lord.\r\nYe war against the sunset glow;\r\n    The darkness gathers fast, my lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_The Fight of Heriot\xe2\x80\x99s Ford_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a cheerful life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, some days later. \xe2\x80\x9cTorp\xe2\x80\x99s away;\r\nBessie hates me; I can\xe2\x80\x99t get at the notion of the Melancolia; Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletters are scrappy; and I believe I have indigestion. What give a man\r\npains across the head and spots before his eyes, Binkie? Shall us take\r\nsome liver pills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick had just gone through a lively scene with Bessie. She had for the\r\nfiftieth time reproached him for sending Torpenhow away. She explained\r\nher enduring hatred for Dick, and made it clear to him that she only\r\nsat for the sake of his money. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s ten times a better\r\nman than you,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he went away. _I_ should have stayed and made love\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl sat with her chin on her hand, scowling. \xe2\x80\x9cTo me! I\xe2\x80\x99d like to\r\ncatch you! If I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid o\xe2\x80\x99 being hung I\xe2\x80\x99d kill you. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d do.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99you believe me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick smiled wearily. It is not pleasant to live in the company of a\r\nnotion that will not work out, a fox-terrier that cannot talk, and a\r\nwoman who talks too much. He would have answered, but at that moment\r\nthere unrolled itself from one corner of the studio a veil, as it were,\r\nof the flimsiest gauze. He rubbed his eyes, but the gray haze would not\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is disgraceful indigestion. Binkie, we will go to a medicine-man.\r\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t have our eyes interfered with, for by these we get our bread;\r\nalso mutton-chop bones for little dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor was an affable local practitioner with white hair, and he\r\nsaid nothing till Dick began to describe the gray film in the studio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all want a little patching and repairing from time to time,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nchirped. \xe2\x80\x9cLike a ship, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x94exactly like a ship. Sometimes the\r\nhull is out of order, and we consult the surgeon; sometimes the\r\nrigging, and then I advise; sometimes the engines, and we go to the\r\nbrain-specialist; sometimes the look-out on the bridge is tired, and\r\nthen we see an oculist. I should recommend you to see an oculist. A\r\nlittle patching and repairing from time to time is all we want. An\r\noculist, by all means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick sought an oculist,\xe2\x80\x94the best in London. He was certain that the\r\nlocal practitioner did not know anything about his trade, and more\r\ncertain that Maisie would laugh at him if he were forced to wear\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve neglected the warnings of my lord the stomach too long. Hence\r\nthese spots before the eyes, Binkie. I can see as well as I ever\r\ncould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he entered the dark hall that led to the consulting-room a man\r\ncannoned against him. Dick saw the face as it hurried out into the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the writer-type. He has the same modelling of the forehead as\r\nTorp. He looks very sick. Probably heard something he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven as he thought, a great fear came upon Dick, a fear that made him\r\nhold his breath as he walked into the oculist\xe2\x80\x99s waiting room, with the\r\nheavy carved furniture, the dark-green paper, and the sober-hued prints\r\non the wall. He recognised a reproduction of one of his own sketches.\r\n\r\nMany people were waiting their turn before him. His eye was caught by a\r\nflaming red-and-gold Christmas-carol book. Little children came to that\r\neye-doctor, and they needed large-type amusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s idolatrous bad Art,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, drawing the book towards himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the anatomy of the angels, it has been made in Germany.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nopened in mechanically, and there leaped to his eyes a verse printed in\r\nred ink\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe next good joy that Mary had,\r\n    It was the joy of three,\r\nTo see her good Son Jesus Christ\r\n    Making the blind to see;\r\nMaking the blind to see, good Lord,\r\n    And happy we may be.\r\nPraise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost\r\n    To all eternity!\r\n\r\n\r\nDick read and re-read the verse till his turn came, and the doctor was\r\nbending above him seated in an arm-chair. The blaze of the\r\ngas-microscope in his eyes made him wince. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s hand touched\r\nthe scar of the sword-cut on Dick\xe2\x80\x99s head, and Dick explained briefly\r\nhow he had come by it. When the flame was removed, Dick saw the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s face, and the fear came upon him again. The doctor wrapped\r\nhimself in a mist of words. Dick caught allusions to \xe2\x80\x9cscar,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfrontal\r\nbone,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9coptic nerve,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cextreme caution,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cavoidance of mental\r\nanxiety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerdict?\xe2\x80\x9d he said faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy business is painting, and I daren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwaste time. What do you make of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the whirl of words, but this time they conveyed a meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you give me anything to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMany sentences were pronounced in that darkened room, and the prisoners\r\noften needed cheering. Dick found a glass of liqueur brandy in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as I can gather,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, coughing above the spirit, \xe2\x80\x9cyou call\r\nit decay of the optic nerve, or something, and therefore hopeless. What\r\nis my time-limit, avoiding all strain and worry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps one year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! And if I don\xe2\x80\x99t take care of myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really could not say. One cannot ascertain the exact amount of\r\ninjury inflicted by the sword-cut. The scar is an old one, and\xe2\x80\x94exposure\r\nto the strong light of the desert, did you say?\xe2\x80\x94with excessive\r\napplication to fine work? I really could not say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, but it has come without any warning. If you will\r\nlet me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit here for a minute, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. You have been\r\nvery good in telling me the truth. Without any warning; without any\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\nThanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick went into the street, and was rapturously received by Binkie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got it very badly, little dog! Just as badly as we can get it.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the Park to think it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey headed for a certain tree that Dick knew well, and they sat down\r\nto think, because his legs were trembling under him and there was cold\r\nfear at the pit of his stomach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could it have come without any warning? It\xe2\x80\x99s as sudden as being\r\nshot. It\xe2\x80\x99s the living death, Binkie. We\xe2\x80\x99re to be shut up in the dark in\r\none year if we\xe2\x80\x99re careful, and we shan\xe2\x80\x99t see anybody, and we shall\r\nnever have anything we want, not though we live to be a hundred!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBinkie wagged his tail joyously. \xe2\x80\x9cBinkie, we must think. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see how\r\nit feels to be blind.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick shut his eyes, and flaming commas and\r\nCatherine-wheels floated inside the lids. Yet when he looked across the\r\nPark the scope of his vision was not contracted. He could see\r\nperfectly, until a procession of slow-wheeling fireworks defiled across\r\nhis eyeballs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle dorglums, we aren\xe2\x80\x99t at all well. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go home. If only Torp\r\nwere back, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Torpenhow was in the south of England, inspecting dockyards in the\r\ncompany of the Nilghai. His letters were brief and full of mystery.\r\n\r\nDick had never asked anybody to help him in his joys or his sorrows. He\r\nargued, in the loneliness of his studio, henceforward to be decorated\r\nwith a film of gray gauze in one corner, that, if his fate were\r\nblindness, all the Torpenhows in the world could not save him. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncall him off his trip to sit down and sympathise with me. I must pull\r\nthrough this business alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He was lying on the sofa, eating\r\nhis moustache and wondering what the darkness of the night would be\r\nlike. Then came to his mind the memory of a quaint scene in the Soudan.\r\nA soldier had been nearly hacked in two by a broad-bladed Arab spear.\r\nFor one instant the man felt no pain. Looking down, he saw that his\r\nlife-blood was going from him. The stupid bewilderment on his face was\r\nso intensely comic that both Dick and Torpenhow, still panting and\r\nunstrung from a fight for life, had roared with laughter, in which the\r\nman seemed as if he would join, but, as his lips parted in a sheepish\r\ngrin, the agony of death came upon him, and he pitched grunting at\r\ntheir feet. Dick laughed again, remembering the horror. It seemed so\r\nexactly like his own case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have a little more time allowed me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He paced up and\r\ndown the room, quietly at first, but afterwards with the hurried feet\r\nof fear. It was as though a black shadow stood at his elbow and urged\r\nhim to go forward; and there were only weaving circles and floating\r\npin-dots before his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to be calm, Binkie; we must be calm.\xe2\x80\x9d He talked aloud for the\r\nsake of distraction. \xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t nice at all. What shall we do? We must\r\ndo something. Our time is short. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed that this\r\nmorning; but now things are different. Binkie, where was Moses when the\r\nlight went out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBinkie smiled from ear to ear, as a well-bred terrier should, but made\r\nno suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cWere there but world enough and time, This coyness, Binkie, were not\r\ncrime.... But at my back I always hear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99 He wiped his forehead, which\r\nwas unpleasantly damp. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do? What can I do? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nnotions left, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t think connectedly, but I must do something,\r\nor I shall go off my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hurried walk recommenced, Dick stopping every now and again to drag\r\nforth long-neglected canvases and old note-books; for he turned to his\r\nwork by instinct, as a thing that could not fail. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t do, and\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, at each inspection. \xe2\x80\x9cNo more soldiers. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t paint \xe2\x80\x99em. Sudden death comes home too nearly, and this is\r\nbattle and murder for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe day was failing, and Dick thought for a moment that the twilight of\r\nthe blind had come upon him unaware. \xe2\x80\x9cAllah Almighty!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried\r\ndespairingly, \xe2\x80\x9chelp me through the time of waiting, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t whine\r\nwhen my punishment comes. What can I do now, before the light goes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. Dick waited till he could regain some sort of\r\ncontrol over himself. His hands were shaking, and he prided himself on\r\ntheir steadiness; he could feel that his lips were quivering, and the\r\nsweat was running down his face. He was lashed by fear, driven forward\r\nby the desire to get to work at once and accomplish something, and\r\nmaddened by the refusal of his brain to do more than repeat the news\r\nthat he was about to go blind. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a humiliating exhibition,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m glad Torp isn\xe2\x80\x99t here to see. The doctor said I was to\r\navoid mental worry.\r\n\r\nCome here and let me pet you, Binkie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little dog yelped because Dick nearly squeezed the bark out of him.\r\n\r\nThen he heard the man speaking in the twilight, and, doglike,\r\nunderstood that his trouble stood off from him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAllah is good, Binkie.\r\nNot quite so gentle as we could wish, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss that later. I\r\nthink I see my way to it now. All those studies of Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s head were\r\nnonsense, and they nearly brought your master into a scrape. I hold the\r\nnotion now as clear as crystal,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe Melancolia that transcends all\r\nwit.\xe2\x80\x9d There shall be Maisie in that head, because I shall never get\r\nMaisie; and Bess, of course, because she knows all about Melancolia,\r\nthough she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know she knows; and there shall be some drawing in\r\nit, and it shall all end up with a laugh. That\xe2\x80\x99s for myself. Shall she\r\ngiggle or grin? No, she shall laugh right out of the canvas, and every\r\nman and woman that ever had a sorrow of their own shall\xe2\x80\x94what is it the\r\npoem says?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand the speech and feel a stir\r\nOf fellowship in all disastrous fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn all disastrous fight\xe2\x80\x9d? That\xe2\x80\x99s better than painting the thing merely\r\nto pique Maisie. I can do it now because I have it inside me. Binkie,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to hold you up by your tail. You\xe2\x80\x99re an omen. Come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBinkie swung head downward for a moment without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather like holding a guinea-pig; but you\xe2\x80\x99re a brave little dog, and\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t yelp when you\xe2\x80\x99re hung up. It is an omen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBinkie went to his own chair, and as often as he looked saw Dick\r\nwalking up and down, rubbing his hands and chuckling. That night Dick\r\nwrote a letter to Maisie full of the tenderest regard for her health,\r\nbut saying very little about his own, and dreamed of the Melancolia to\r\nbe born. Not till morning did he remember that something might happen\r\nto him in the future.\r\n\r\nHe fell to work, whistling softly, and was swallowed up in the clean,\r\nclear joy of creation, which does not come to man too often, lest he\r\nshould consider himself the equal of his God, and so refuse to die at\r\nthe appointed time. He forgot Maisie, Torpenhow, and Binkie at his\r\nfeet, but remembered to stir Bessie, who needed very little stirring,\r\ninto a tremendous rage, that he might watch the smouldering lights in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself without reservation into his work, and did not think\r\nof the doom that was to overtake him, for he was possessed with his\r\nnotion, and the things of this world had no power upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie.\r\n\r\nDick waved his mahl-stick in mystic circles and went to the sideboard\r\nfor a drink. In the evening, when the exaltation of the day had died\r\ndown, he went to the sideboard again, and after some visits became\r\nconvinced that the eye-doctor was a liar, since he could still see\r\neverything very clearly.\r\n\r\nHe was of opinion that he would even make a home for Maisie, and that\r\nwhether she liked it or not she should be his wife. The mood passed\r\nnext morning, but the sideboard and all upon it remained for his\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nAgain he set to work, and his eyes troubled him with spots and dashes\r\nand blurs till he had taken counsel with the sideboard, and the\r\nMelancolia both on the canvas and in his own mind appeared lovelier\r\nthan ever. There was a delightful sense of irresponsibility upon him,\r\nsuch as they feel who walking among their fellow-men know that the\r\ndeath-sentence of disease is upon them, and, seeing that fear is but\r\nwaste of the little time left, are riotously happy. The days passed\r\nwithout event.\r\n\r\nBessie arrived punctually always, and, though her voice seemed to Dick\r\nto come from a distance, her face was always very near. The Melancolia\r\nbegan to flame on the canvas, in the likeness of a woman who had known\r\nall the sorrow in the world and was laughing at it. It was true that\r\nthe corners of the studio draped themselves in gray film and retired\r\ninto the darkness, that the spots in his eyes and the pains across his\r\nhead were very troublesome, and that Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s letters were hard to read\r\nand harder still to answer. He could not tell her of his trouble, and\r\nhe could not laugh at her accounts of her own Melancolia which was\r\nalways going to be finished. But the furious days of toil and the\r\nnights of wild dreams made amends for all, and the sideboard was his\r\nbest friend on earth.\r\n\r\nBessie was singularly dull. She used to shriek with rage when Dick\r\nstared at her between half-closed eyes. Now she sulked, or watched him\r\nwith disgust, saying very little.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow had been absent for six weeks. An incoherent note heralded\r\nhis return. \xe2\x80\x9cNews! great news!\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Nilghai knows, and so\r\ndoes the Keneu. We\xe2\x80\x99re all back on Thursday. Get lunch and clean your\r\naccoutrements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick showed Bessie the letter, and she abused him for that he had ever\r\nsent Torpenhow away and ruined her life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, brutally, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re better as you are, instead of\r\nmaking love to some drunken beast in the street.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt that he had\r\nrescued Torpenhow from great temptation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s any worse than sitting to a drunken beast in a\r\nstudio. _You_ haven\xe2\x80\x99t been sober for three weeks. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been soaking\r\nthe whole time; and yet you pretend you\xe2\x80\x99re better than me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMean! You\xe2\x80\x99ll see when Mr. Torpenhow comes back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not long to wait. Torpenhow met Bessie on the staircase without\r\na sign of feeling. He had news that was more to him than many Bessies,\r\nand the Keneu and the Nilghai were trampling behind him, calling for\r\nDick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrinking like a fish,\xe2\x80\x9d Bessie whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been at it for nearly a\r\nmonth.\xe2\x80\x9d She followed the men stealthily to hear judgment done.\r\n\r\nThey came into the studio, rejoicing, to be welcomed over effusively by\r\na drawn, lined, shrunken, haggard wreck,\xe2\x80\x94unshaven, blue-white about the\r\nnostrils, stooping in the shoulders, and peering under his eyebrows\r\nnervously. The drink had been at work as steadily as Dick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that\xe2\x80\x99s left of me. Sit down. Binkie\xe2\x80\x99s quite well, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ndoing some good work.\xe2\x80\x9d He reeled where he stood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve done some of the worst work you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done in your life. Man\r\nalive, you\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow turned to his companions appealingly, and they left the room\r\nto find lunch elsewhere. Then he spoke; but, since the reproof of a\r\nfriend is much too sacred and intimate a thing to be printed, and since\r\nTorpenhow used figures and metaphors which were unseemly, and contempt\r\nuntranslatable, it will never be known what was actually said to Dick,\r\nwho blinked and winked and picked at his hands. After a time the\r\nculprit began to feel the need of a little self-respect. He was quite\r\nsure that he had not in any way departed from virtue, and there were\r\nreasons, too, of which Torpenhow knew nothing. He would explain.\r\n\r\nHe rose, tried to straighten his shoulders, and spoke to the face he\r\ncould hardly see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am right, too. After you went away I\r\nhad some trouble with my eyes. So I went to an oculist, and he turned a\r\ngasogene\xe2\x80\x94I mean a gas-engine\xe2\x80\x94into my eye. That was very long ago. He\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cScar on the head,\xe2\x80\x94sword-cut and optic nerve.\xe2\x80\x9d Make a note of\r\nthat. So I am going blind. I have some work to do before I go blind,\r\nand I suppose that I must do it. I cannot see much now, but I can see\r\nbest when I am drunk. I did not know I was drunk till I was told, but I\r\nmust go on with my work. If you want to see it, there it is.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npointed to the all but finished Melancolia and looked for applause.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow said nothing, and Dick began to whimper feebly, for joy at\r\nseeing Torpenhow again, for grief at misdeeds\xe2\x80\x94if indeed they were\r\nmisdeeds\xe2\x80\x94that made Torpenhow remote and unsympathetic, and for childish\r\nvanity hurt, since Torpenhow had not given a word of praise to his\r\nwonderful picture.\r\n\r\nBessie looked through the keyhole after a long pause, and saw the two\r\nwalking up and down as usual, Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s hand on Dick\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\nHereat she said something so improper that it shocked even Binkie, who\r\nwas dribbling patiently on the landing with the hope of seeing his\r\nmaster again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lark will make her hymn to God,\r\n    The partridge call her brood,\r\nWhile I forget the heath I trod,\r\n    The fields wherein I stood.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis dule to know not night from morn,\r\n    But deeper dule to know\r\nI can but hear the hunter\xe2\x80\x99s horn\r\n    That once I used to blow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_The Only Son_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the third day after Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s return, and his heart was heavy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to tell me that you can\xe2\x80\x99t see to work without whiskey?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s generally the other way about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan a drunkard swear on his honour?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if he has been as good a man as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I give you my word of honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, speaking hurriedly\r\nthrough parched lips. \xe2\x80\x9cOld man, I can hardly see your face now. You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nkept me sober for two days,\xe2\x80\x94if I ever was drunk,\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ve done no work.\r\n\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t keep me back any more. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when my eyes may give out.\r\n\r\nThe spots and dots and the pains and things are crowding worse than\r\never. I swear I can see all right when I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94when I\xe2\x80\x99m moderately screwed,\r\nas you say. Give me three more sittings from Bessie and all\xe2\x80\x94the stuff I\r\nwant, and the picture will be done. I can\xe2\x80\x99t kill myself in three days.\r\nIt only means a touch of D. T. at the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I give you three days more will you promise me to stop work and\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nother thing, whether the picture\xe2\x80\x99s finished or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that picture means to me. But surely you\r\ncould get the Nilghai to help you, and knock me down and tie me up. I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fight for the whiskey, but I should for the work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, then. I give you three days; but you\xe2\x80\x99re nearly breaking my\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick returned to his work, toiling as one possessed; and the yellow\r\ndevil of whiskey stood by him and chased away the spots in his eyes.\r\nThe Melancolia was nearly finished, and was all or nearly all that he\r\nhad hoped she would be. Dick jested with Bessie, who reminded him that\r\nhe was \xe2\x80\x9ca drunken beast\xe2\x80\x99; but the reproof did not move him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t understand, Bess. We are in sight of land now, and soon we\r\nshall lie back and think about what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you three\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x99 pay when the picture\xe2\x80\x99s finished, and next time I have any more\r\nwork in hand\xe2\x80\x94but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Won\xe2\x80\x99t three months\xe2\x80\x99 pay make you\r\nhate me less?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it won\xe2\x80\x99t! I hate you, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on hating you. Mr. Torpenhow\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me any more. He\xe2\x80\x99s always looking at maps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie did not say that she had again laid siege to Torpenhow, or that\r\nat the end of her passionate pleading he had picked her up, given her a\r\nkiss, and put her outside the door with the recommendation not to be a\r\nlittle fool. He spent most of his time in the company of the Nilghai,\r\nand their talk was of war in the near future, the hiring of transports,\r\nand secret preparations among the dockyards. He did not wish to see\r\nDick till the picture was finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s doing first-class work,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the Nilghai, \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\nout of his regular line. But, for the matter of that, so\xe2\x80\x99s his infernal\r\nsoaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. Leave him alone. When he has come to his senses again\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll carry him off from this place and let him breathe clean air. Poor\r\nDick! I don\xe2\x80\x99t envy you, Torp, when his eyes fail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it will be a case of \xe2\x80\x9cGod help the man who\xe2\x80\x99s chained to our\r\nDavie.\xe2\x80\x9d The worst is that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know when it will happen, and I\r\nbelieve the uncertainty and the waiting have sent Dick to the whiskey\r\nmore than anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow the Arab who cut his head open would grin if he knew!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s at perfect liberty to grin if he can. He\xe2\x80\x99s dead. That\xe2\x80\x99s poor\r\nconsolation now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the third day Torpenhow heard Dick calling for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll finished!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it! Come in! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t she a beauty?\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she a darling? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been down to hell to get her; but isn\xe2\x80\x99t she\r\nworth it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow looked at the head of a woman who laughed,\xe2\x80\x94a full-lipped,\r\nhollow-eyed woman who laughed from out of the canvas as Dick had\r\nintended she would.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho taught you how to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cThe touch and notion\r\nhave nothing to do with your regular work. What a face it is! What\r\neyes, and what insolence!\xe2\x80\x9d Unconsciously he threw back his head and\r\nlaughed with her. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s seen the game played out,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\r\nhad a good time of it,\xe2\x80\x94and now she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get the mouth and chin from? They don\xe2\x80\x99t belong to Bess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\x94some one else\xe2\x80\x99s. But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it good? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it thundering good?\r\nWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it worth the whiskey? I did it. Alone I did it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbest I can do.\xe2\x80\x9d He drew his breath sharply, and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cJust God!\r\nwhat could I not do ten years hence, if I can do this now!\xe2\x80\x94By the way,\r\nwhat do you think of it, Bess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl was biting her lips. She loathed Torpenhow because he had\r\ntaken no notice of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s just the horridest, beastliest thing I ever saw,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered, and turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than you will be of that way of thinking, young woman.\xe2\x80\x94Dick,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of murderous, viperine suggestion in the poise of the\r\nhead that I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s trick-work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, chuckling with delight at being\r\ncompletely understood. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist one little bit of sheer\r\nswagger. It\xe2\x80\x99s a French trick, and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand; but it\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nat by slewing round the head a trifle, and a tiny, tiny foreshortening\r\nof one side of the face from the angle of the chin to the top of the\r\nleft ear. That, and deepening the shadow under the lobe of the ear. It\r\nwas flagrant trick-work; but, having the notion fixed, I felt entitled\r\nto play with it,\xe2\x80\x94Oh, you beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen! She is a beauty. I can feel it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo will every man who has any sorrow of his own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, slapping\r\nhis thigh. \xe2\x80\x9cHe shall see his trouble there, and, by the Lord Harry,\r\njust when he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling properly sorry for himself he shall throw back\r\nhis head and laugh,\xe2\x80\x94as she is laughing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve put the life of my heart\r\nand the light of my eyes into her, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what comes.... I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntired,\xe2\x80\x94awfully tired. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to sleep. Take away the whiskey,\r\nit has served its turn, and give Bessie thirty-six quid, and three over\r\nfor luck. Cover the picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped asleep in the long chair, hid face white and haggard, almost\r\nbefore he had finished the sentence. Bessie tried to take Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you never going to speak to me any more?\xe2\x80\x9d she said; but\r\nTorpenhow was looking at Dick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a stock of vanity the man has! I\xe2\x80\x99ll take him in hand to-morrow\r\nand make much of him. He deserves it.\xe2\x80\x94Eh! what was that, Bess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put things tidy here a little, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. You\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give the that three months\xe2\x80\x99 pay now, could you? He said you\r\nwere to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow gave her a check and went to his own rooms. Bessie faithfully\r\ntidied up the studio, set the door ajar for flight, emptied half a\r\nbottle of turpentine on a duster, and began to scrub the face of the\r\nMelancolia viciously. The paint did not smudge quickly enough. She took\r\na palette-knife and scraped, following each stroke with the wet duster.\r\nIn five minutes the picture was a formless, scarred muddle of colours.\r\nShe threw the paint-stained duster into the studio stove, stuck out her\r\ntongue at the sleeper, and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cBilked!\xe2\x80\x9d as she turned to run\r\ndown the staircase. She would never see Torpenhow any more, but she had\r\nat least done harm to the man who had come between her and her desire\r\nand who used to make fun of her. Cashing the check was the very cream\r\nof the jest to Bessie. Then the little privateer sailed across the\r\nThames, to be swallowed up in the gray wilderness of South-the-Water.\r\n\r\nDick slept till late in the evening, when Torpenhow dragged him off to\r\nbed. His eyes were as bright as his voice was hoarse. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have\r\nanother look at the picture,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, insistently as a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94go\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou aren\xe2\x80\x99t at all well, though you\r\nmayn\xe2\x80\x99t know it. You\xe2\x80\x99re as jumpy as a cat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reform to-morrow. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he repassed through the studio, Torpenhow lifted the cloth above the\r\npicture, and almost betrayed himself by outcries: \xe2\x80\x9cWiped out!\xe2\x80\x94scraped\r\nout and turped out! He\xe2\x80\x99s on the verge of jumps as it is. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBess,\xe2\x80\x94the little fiend! Only a woman could have done that!-with the ink\r\nnot dry on the check, too! Dick will be raving mad to-morrow. It was\r\nall my fault for trying to help gutter-devils. Oh, my poor Dick, the\r\nLord is hitting you very hard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick could not sleep that night, partly for pure joy, and partly\r\nbecause the well-known Catherine-wheels inside his eyes had given place\r\nto crackling volcanoes of many-coloured fire. \xe2\x80\x9cSpout away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done my work, and now you can do what you please.\xe2\x80\x9d He lay still,\r\nstaring at the ceiling, the long-pent-up delirium of drink in his\r\nveins, his brain on fire with racing thoughts that would not stay to be\r\nconsidered, and his hands crisped and dry. He had just discovered that\r\nhe was painting the face of the Melancolia on a revolving dome ribbed\r\nwith millions of lights, and that all his wondrous thoughts stood\r\nembodied hundreds of feet below his tiny swinging plank, shouting\r\ntogether in his honour, when something cracked inside his temples like\r\nan overstrained bowstring, the glittering dome broke inward, and he was\r\nalone in the thick night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to sleep. The room\xe2\x80\x99s very dark. Let\xe2\x80\x99s light a lamp and see how\r\nthe Melancolia looks. There ought to have been a moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was then that Torpenhow heard his name called by a voice that he did\r\nnot know,\xe2\x80\x94in the rattling accents of deadly fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s looked at the picture,\xe2\x80\x9d was his first thought, as he hurried into\r\nthe bedroom and found Dick sitting up and beating the air with his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTorp! Torp! where are you? For pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, come to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick clutched at his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cMatter! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been lying here for hours\r\nin the dark, and you never heard me. Torp, old man, don\xe2\x80\x99t go away. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nall in the dark. In the dark, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow held the candle within a foot of Dick\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but there was\r\nno light in those eyes. He lit the gas, and Dick heard the flame catch.\r\nThe grip of his fingers on Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder made Torpenhow wince.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave me. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave me alone now, would you? I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee. D\xe2\x80\x99you understand? It\xe2\x80\x99s black,\xe2\x80\x94quite black,\xe2\x80\x94and I feel as if I was\r\nfalling through it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady does it.\xe2\x80\x9d Torpenhow put his arm round Dick and began to rock\r\nhim gently to and fro.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s good. Now don\xe2\x80\x99t talk. If I keep very quiet for a while, this\r\ndarkness will lift. It seems just on the point of breaking. H\xe2\x80\x99sh!\xe2\x80\x9d Dick\r\nknit his brows and stared desperately in front of him. The night air\r\nwas chilling Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s toes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you stay like that a minute?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get my dressing-gown\r\nand some slippers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick clutched the bed-head with both hands and waited for the darkness\r\nto clear away. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a time you\xe2\x80\x99ve been!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, when Torpenhow\r\nreturned. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as black as ever. What are you banging about in the\r\ndoor-way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong chair,\xe2\x80\x94horse-blanket,\xe2\x80\x94pillow. Going to sleep by you. Lie down\r\nnow; you\xe2\x80\x99ll be better in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d The voice rose to a wail. \xe2\x80\x9cMy God! I\xe2\x80\x99m blind! I\xe2\x80\x99m blind,\r\nand the darkness will never go away.\xe2\x80\x9d He made as if to leap from the\r\nbed, but Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s arms were round him, and Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s chin was on\r\nhis shoulder, and his breath was squeezed out of him. He could only\r\ngasp, \xe2\x80\x9cBlind!\xe2\x80\x9d and wriggle feebly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady, Dickie, steady!\xe2\x80\x9d said the deep voice in his ear, and the grip\r\ntightened. \xe2\x80\x9cBite on the bullet, old man, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let them think\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d The grip could draw no closer. Both men were breathing\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\nDick threw his head from side to side and groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go,\xe2\x80\x9d he panted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re cracking my ribs. We-we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nthem think we\xe2\x80\x99re afraid, must we,\xe2\x80\x94all the powers of darkness and that\r\nlot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLie down. It\xe2\x80\x99s all over now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, obediently. \xe2\x80\x9cBut would you mind letting me hold your\r\nhand? I feel as if I wanted something to hold on to. One drops through\r\nthe dark so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow thrust out a large and hairy paw from the long chair. Dick\r\nclutched it tightly, and in half an hour had fallen asleep. Torpenhow\r\nwithdrew his hand, and, stooping over Dick, kissed him lightly on the\r\nforehead, as men do sometimes kiss a wounded comrade in the hour of\r\ndeath, to ease his departure.\r\n\r\nIn the gray dawn Torpenhow heard Dick talking to himself. He was adrift\r\non the shoreless tides of delirium, speaking very quickly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npity,\xe2\x80\x94a great pity; but it\xe2\x80\x99s helped, and it must be eaten, Master\r\nGeorge. Sufficient unto the day is the blindness thereof, and, further,\r\nputting aside all Melancolias and false humours, it is of obvious\r\nnotoriety\xe2\x80\x94such as mine was\xe2\x80\x94that the queen can do no wrong. Torp doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him when we\xe2\x80\x99re a little farther into the desert.\r\n\r\nWhat a bungle those boatmen are making of the steamer-ropes! They\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave that four-inch hawser chafed through in a minute. I told you\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94there she goes! White foam on green water, and the steamer slewing\r\nround. How good that looks! I\xe2\x80\x99ll sketch it. No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m afflicted\r\nwith ophthalmia. That was one of the ten plagues of Egypt, and it\r\nextends up the Nile in the shape of cataract. Ha! that\xe2\x80\x99s a joke, Torp.\r\nLaugh, you graven image, and stand clear of the hawser.... It\xe2\x80\x99ll knock\r\nyou into the water and make your dress all dirty, Maisie dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cThis happened before. That night on the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to say it\xe2\x80\x99s my fault if you get muddy, and you\xe2\x80\x99re quite\r\nnear enough to the breakwater. Maisie, that\xe2\x80\x99s not fair. Ah! I knew\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d miss.\r\n\r\nLow and to the left, dear. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve no conviction. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry,\r\ndarling. I\xe2\x80\x99d cut my hand off if it would give you anything more than\r\nobstinacy. My right hand, if it would serve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t listen. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an island shouting across seas of\r\nmisunderstanding with a vengeance. But it\xe2\x80\x99s shouting truth, I fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Torpenhow.\r\n\r\nThe babble continued. It all bore upon Maisie. Sometimes Dick lectured\r\nat length on his craft, then he cursed himself for his folly in being\r\nenslaved. He pleaded to Maisie for a kiss\xe2\x80\x94only one kiss\xe2\x80\x94before she went\r\naway, and called to her to come back from Vitry-sur-Marne, if she\r\nwould; but through all his ravings he bade heaven and earth witness\r\nthat the queen could do no wrong.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow listened attentively, and learned every detail of Dick\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\nthat had been hidden from him. For three days Dick raved through the\r\npast, and then a natural sleep. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strain he has been running\r\nunder, poor chap!\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cDick, of all men, handing himself\r\nover like a dog! And I was lecturing him on arrogance! I ought to have\r\nknown that it was no use to judge a man. But I did it. What a demon\r\nthat girl must be! Dick\xe2\x80\x99s given her his life,\xe2\x80\x94confound him!\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngiven him one kiss apparently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTorp,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, from the bed, \xe2\x80\x9cgo out for a walk. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been here\r\ntoo long. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get up. Hi! This is annoying. I can\xe2\x80\x99t dress myself. Oh,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s too absurd!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow helped him into his clothes and led him to the big chair in\r\nthe studio. He sat quietly waiting under strained nerves for the\r\ndarkness to lift. It did not lift that day, nor the next. Dick\r\nadventured on a voyage round the walls. He hit his shins against the\r\nstove, and this suggested to him that it would be better to crawl on\r\nall fours, one hand in front of him. Torpenhow found him on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get the geography of my new possessions,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you remember that nigger you gouged in the square? Pity you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nkeep the odd eye. It would have been useful. Any letters for me? Give\r\nme all the ones in fat gray envelopes with a sort of crown thing\r\noutside. They\xe2\x80\x99re of no importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow gave him a letter with a black M. on the envelope flap. Dick\r\nput it into his pocket. There was nothing in it that Torpenhow might\r\nnot have read, but it belonged to himself and to Maisie, who would\r\nnever belong to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she finds that I don\xe2\x80\x99t write, she\xe2\x80\x99ll stop writing. It\xe2\x80\x99s better\r\nso. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any use to her now,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick argued, and the tempter\r\nsuggested that he should make known his condition. Every nerve in him\r\nrevolted. \xe2\x80\x9cI have fallen low enough already. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to beg for\r\npity. Besides, it would be cruel to her.\xe2\x80\x9d He strove to put Maisie out\r\nof his thoughts; but the blind have many opportunities for thinking,\r\nand as the tides of his strength came back to him in the long\r\nemployless days of dead darkness, Dick\xe2\x80\x99s soul was troubled to the core.\r\nAnother letter, and another, came from Maisie. Then there was silence,\r\nand Dick sat by the window, the pulse of summer in the air, and\r\npictured her being won by another man, stronger than himself. His\r\nimagination, the keener for the dark background it worked against,\r\nspared him no single detail that might send him raging up and down the\r\nstudio, to stumble over the stove that seemed to be in four places at\r\nonce. Worst of all, tobacco would not taste in the darkness. The\r\narrogance of the man had disappeared, and in its place were settled\r\ndespair that Torpenhow knew, and blind passion that Dick confided to\r\nhis pillow at night. The intervals between the paroxysms were filled\r\nwith intolerable waiting and the weight of intolerable darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome out into the Park,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t stirred out\r\nsince the beginning of things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use? There\xe2\x80\x99s no movement in the dark; and, besides,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\npaused irresolutely at the head of the stairs,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csomething will run over\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if I\xe2\x80\x99m with you. Proceed gingerly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe roar of the streets filled Dick with nervous terror, and he clung\r\nto Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cFancy having to feel for a gutter with your foot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said petulantly, as he turned into the Park. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s curse God and\r\ndie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSentries are forbidden to pay unauthorised compliments. By Jove, there\r\nare the Guards!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s figure straightened. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get near \xe2\x80\x99em. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go in and look.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s get on the grass and run. I can smell the trees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind the low railing. That\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d Torpenhow kicked out a tuft\r\nof grass with his heel. \xe2\x80\x9cSmell that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it good?\xe2\x80\x9d Dick\r\nsniffed luxuriously. \xe2\x80\x9cNow pick up your feet and run.\xe2\x80\x9d They approached\r\nas near to the regiment as was possible. The clank of bayonets being\r\nunfixed made Dick\xe2\x80\x99s nostrils quiver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get nearer. They\xe2\x80\x99re in column, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. How did you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFelt it. Oh, my men!\xe2\x80\x94my beautiful men!\xe2\x80\x9d He edged forward as though he\r\ncould see. \xe2\x80\x9cI could draw those chaps once. Who\xe2\x80\x99ll draw \xe2\x80\x99em now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll move off in a minute. Don\xe2\x80\x99t jump when the band begins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh! I\xe2\x80\x99m not a new charger. It\xe2\x80\x99s the silences that hurt. Nearer,\r\nTorp!\xe2\x80\x94nearer! Oh, my God, what wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I give to see \xe2\x80\x99em for a\r\nminute!\xe2\x80\x94one half-minute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could hear the armed life almost within reach of him, could hear the\r\nslings tighten across the bandsman\xe2\x80\x99s chest as he heaved the big drum\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSticks crossed above his head,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. _I_ know! Who should know if I don\xe2\x80\x99t? H\xe2\x80\x99sh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe drum-sticks fell with a boom, and the men swung forward to the\r\ncrash of the band. Dick felt the wind of the massed movement in his\r\nface, heard the maddening tramp of feet and the friction of the pouches\r\non the belts. The big drum pounded out the tune. It was a music-hall\r\nrefrain that made a perfect quickstep\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe must be a man of decent height,\r\n    He must be a man of weight,\r\nHe must come home on a Saturday night\r\n    In a thoroughly sober state;\r\nHe must know how to love me,\r\n    And he must know how to kiss;\r\nAnd if he\xe2\x80\x99s enough to keep us both\r\n    I can\xe2\x80\x99t refuse him bliss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, as he saw Dick\xe2\x80\x99s head fall when\r\nthe last of the regiment had departed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I feel a little bit out of the running,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Torp,\r\ntake me back. Why did you bring me out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were three friends that buried the fourth,\r\n    The mould in his mouth and the dust in his eyes\r\nAnd they went south and east, and north,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    The strong man fights, but the sick man dies.\r\n\r\nThere were three friends that spoke of the dead,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    The strong man fights, but the sick man dies.\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd would he were with us now,\xe2\x80\x9d they said,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe sun in our face and the wind in our eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Ballad_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nilghai was angry with Torpenhow. Dick had been sent to bed,\xe2\x80\x94blind\r\nmen are ever under the orders of those who can see,\xe2\x80\x94and since he had\r\nreturned from the Park had fluently sworn at Torpenhow because he was\r\nalive, and all the world because it was alive and could see, while he,\r\nDick, was dead in the death of the blind, who, at the best, are only\r\nburdens upon their associates. Torpenhow had said something about a\r\nMrs. Gummidge, and Dick had retired in a black fury to handle and\r\nre-handle three unopened letters from Maisie.\r\n\r\nThe Nilghai, fat, burly, and aggressive, was in Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s rooms.\r\n\r\nBehind him sat the Keneu, the Great War Eagle, and between them lay a\r\nlarge map embellished with black-and-white-headed pins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was wrong about the Balkans,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not wrong\r\nabout this business. The whole of our work in the Southern Soudan must\r\nbe done over again. The public doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care, of course, but the\r\ngovernment does, and they are making their arrangements quietly. You\r\nknow that as well as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember how the people cursed us when our troops withdrew from\r\nOmdurman. It was bound to crop up sooner or later. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Torpenhow. He pointed through the open door; it was a hot night.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you blame me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Keneu purred above his pipe like a large and very happy cat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nblame you in the least. It\xe2\x80\x99s uncommonly good of you, and all the rest\r\nof it, but every man\xe2\x80\x94even you, Torp\xe2\x80\x94must consider his work. I know it\r\nsounds brutal, but Dick\xe2\x80\x99s out of the race,\xe2\x80\x94down,\xe2\x80\x94_gastados_, expended,\r\nfinished, done for. He has a little money of his own. He won\xe2\x80\x99t starve,\r\nand you can\xe2\x80\x99t pull out of your slide for his sake. Think of your own\r\nreputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick\xe2\x80\x99s was five times bigger than mine and yours put together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was because he signed his name to everything he did. It\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nended now. You must hold yourself in readiness to move out. You can\r\ncommand your own prices, and you do better work than any three of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me how tempting it is. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here to look after Dick\r\nfor a while. He\xe2\x80\x99s as cheerful as a bear with a sore head, but I think\r\nhe likes to have me near him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Nilghai said something uncomplimentary about soft-headed fools who\r\nthrow away their careers for other fools. Torpenhow flushed angrily.\r\nThe constant strain of attendance on Dick had worn his nerves thin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere remains a third fate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Keneu, thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cConsider\r\nthis, and be not larger fools than necessary. Dick is\xe2\x80\x94or rather was\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nable-bodied man of moderate attractions and a certain amount of\r\naudacity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai, who remembered an affair at Cairo. \xe2\x80\x9cI begin to\r\nsee,\xe2\x80\x94Torp, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow nodded forgiveness: \xe2\x80\x9cYou were more sorry when he cut you out,\r\nthough.\xe2\x80\x94Go on, Keneu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve often thought, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen men die out in the desert, that if\r\nthe news could be sent through the world, and the means of transport\r\nwere quick enough, there would be one woman at least at each man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere would be some mighty quaint revelations. Let us be grateful\r\nthings are as they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us rather reverently consider whether Torp\xe2\x80\x99s three-cornered\r\nministrations are exactly what Dick needs just now.\xe2\x80\x94What do you think\r\nyourself, Torp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know they aren\xe2\x80\x99t. But what can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLay the matter before the board. We are all Dick\xe2\x80\x99s friends here.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been most in his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I picked it up when he was off his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greater chance of its being true. I thought we should arrive. Who\r\nis she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Torpenhow told a tale in plain words, as a special correspondent\r\nwho knows how to make a verbal _pr\xc3\xa9cis_ should tell it. The men\r\nlistened without interruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that a man can come back across the years to his\r\ncalf-love?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Keneu. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give the facts. He says nothing about it now, but he sits fumbling\r\nthree letters from her when he thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m not looking. What am I to\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! Write to her,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know her full name, remember,\xe2\x80\x94and ask\r\nher to accept him out of pity. I believe you once told Dick you were\r\nsorry for him, Nilghai. You remember what happened, eh? Go into the\r\nbedroom and suggest full confession and an appeal to this Maisie girl,\r\nwhoever she is. I honestly believe he\xe2\x80\x99d try to kill you; and the\r\nblindness has made him rather muscular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTorpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s course is perfectly clear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Keneu. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will go to\r\nVitry-sur-Marne, which is on the Bezieres-Landes Railway,\xe2\x80\x94single track\r\nfrom Tourgas. The Prussians shelled it out in \xe2\x80\x9970 because there was a\r\npoplar on the top of a hill eighteen hundred yards from the church\r\nspire There\xe2\x80\x99s a squadron of cavalry quartered there,\xe2\x80\x94or ought to be.\r\nWhere this studio Torp spoke about may be I cannot tell. That is Torp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness. I have given him his route. He will dispassionately explain\r\nthe situation to the girl, and she will come back to Dick,\xe2\x80\x94the more\r\nespecially because, to use Dick\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing but her\r\ndamned obstinacy to keep them apart.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they have four hundred and twenty pounds a year between \xe2\x80\x99em. Dick\r\nnever lost his head for figures, even in his delirium. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nshadow of an excuse for not going,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow looked very uncomfortable. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd and impossible. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t drag her back by the hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur business\xe2\x80\x94the business for which we draw our money\xe2\x80\x94is to do absurd\r\nand impossible things,\xe2\x80\x94generally with no reason whatever except to\r\namuse the public. Here we have a reason. The rest doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\r\nshall share these rooms with the Nilghai till Torpenhow returns. There\r\nwill be a batch of unbridled \xe2\x80\x9cspecials\xe2\x80\x9d coming to town in a little\r\nwhile, and these will serve as their headquarters. Another reason for\r\nsending Torpenhow away. Thus Providence helps those who help others,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94here the Keneu dropped his measured speech\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwe can\xe2\x80\x99t have you tied\r\nby the leg to Dick when the trouble begins. It\xe2\x80\x99s your only chance of\r\ngetting away; and Dick will be grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will,\xe2\x80\x94worse luck! I can but go and try. I can\xe2\x80\x99t conceive a woman in\r\nher senses refusing Dick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk that out with the girl. I have seen you wheedle an angry Mahdieh\r\nwoman into giving you dates. This won\xe2\x80\x99t be a tithe as difficult. You\r\nhad better not be here to-morrow afternoon, because the Nilghai and I\r\nwill be in possession. It is an order. Obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, next morning, \xe2\x80\x9ccan I do anything for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Leave me alone. How often must I remind you that I\xe2\x80\x99m blind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing I could go for to fetch for to carry for to bring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Take those infernal creaking boots of yours away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor chap!\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI must have been sitting on\r\nhis nerves lately. He wants a lighter step.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\r\nSince you\xe2\x80\x99re so independent, I\xe2\x80\x99m going off for four or five days. Say\r\ngood-bye at least. The housekeeper will look after you, and Keneu has\r\nmy rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s face fell. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be longer than a week at the outside? I\r\nknow I\xe2\x80\x99m touched in the temper, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t get on without you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you? You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do without me in a little time, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe glad I\xe2\x80\x99m gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick felt his way back to the big chair, and wondered what these things\r\nmight mean. He did not wish to be tended by the housekeeper, and yet\r\nTorpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s constant tenderness jarred on him. He did not exactly know\r\nwhat he wanted. The darkness would not lift, and Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s unopened\r\nletters felt worn and old from much handling. He could never read them\r\nfor himself as long as life endured; but Maisie might have sent him\r\nsome fresh ones to play with. The Nilghai entered with a gift,\xe2\x80\x94a piece\r\nof red modelling-wax. He fancied that Dick might find interest in using\r\nhis hands. Dick poked and patted the stuff for a few minutes, and, \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nit like anything in the world?\xe2\x80\x9d he said drearily. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it away. I may\r\nget the touch of the blind in fifty years. Do you know where Torpenhow\r\nhas gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Nilghai knew nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re staying in his rooms till he comes\r\nback. Can we do anything for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to be left alone, please. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m ungrateful; but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nbest alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Nilghai chuckled, and Dick resumed his drowsy brooding and sullen\r\nrebellion against fate. He had long since ceased to think about the\r\nwork he had done in the old days, and the desire to do more work had\r\ndeparted from him. He was exceedingly sorry for himself, and the\r\ncompleteness of his tender grief soothed him. But his soul and his body\r\ncried for Maisie\xe2\x80\x94Maisie who would understand. His mind pointed out that\r\nMaisie, having her own work to do, would not care. His experience had\r\ntaught him that when money was exhausted women went away, and that when\r\na man was knocked out of the race the others trampled on him. \xe2\x80\x9cThen at\r\nthe least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cshe could use me as I used Binat,\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nsome sort of a study. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask more than to be near her again,\r\neven though I knew that another man was making love to her. Ugh! what a\r\ndog I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA voice on the staircase began to sing joyfully\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we go\xe2\x80\x94go\xe2\x80\x94go away from here,\r\n    Our creditors will weep and they will wail,\r\nOur absence much regretting when they find that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting\r\n    Out of England by next Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Indian mail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the trampling of feet, slamming of Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s door, and the\r\nsound of voices in strenuous debate, some one squeaked, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd see, you\r\ngood fellows, I have found a new water-bottle\xe2\x80\x94firs\xe2\x80\x99-class patent\xe2\x80\x94eh,\r\nhow you say? Open himself inside out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick sprang to his feet. He knew the voice well. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Cassavetti,\r\ncome back from the Continent. Now I know why Torp went away. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nrow somewhere, and\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m out of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Nilghai commanded silence in vain. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for my sake,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick said\r\nbitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe birds are getting ready to fly, and they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nme. I can hear Morten-Sutherland and Mackaye. Half the War\r\nCorrespondents in London are there;\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stumbled across the landing and plunged into Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s room. He\r\ncould feel that it was full of men. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nthe Balkans at last? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t some one tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be interested,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai,\r\nshamefacedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in the Soudan, as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lucky dogs! Let me sit here while you talk. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be a skeleton\r\nat the feast.\xe2\x80\x94Cassavetti, where are you? Your English is as bad as\r\never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick was led into a chair. He heard the rustle of the maps, and the\r\ntalk swept forward, carrying him with it. Everybody spoke at once,\r\ndiscussing press censorships, railway-routes, transport, water-supply,\r\nthe capacities of generals,\xe2\x80\x94these in language that would have horrified\r\na trusting public,\xe2\x80\x94ranging, asserting, denouncing, and laughing at the\r\ntop of their voices. There was the glorious certainty of war in the\r\nSoudan at any moment. The Nilghai said so, and it was well to be in\r\nreadiness. The Keneu had telegraphed to Cairo for horses; Cassavetti\r\nhad stolen a perfectly inaccurate list of troops that would be ordered\r\nforward, and was reading it out amid profane interruptions, and the\r\nKeneu introduced to Dick some man unknown who would be employed as war\r\nartist by the Central Southern Syndicate. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s his first outing,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Keneu. \xe2\x80\x9cGive him some tips\xe2\x80\x94about riding camels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, those camels!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Cassavetti. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall learn to ride him\r\nagain, and now I am so much all soft! Listen, you good fellows. I know\r\nyour military arrangement very well. There will go the Royal Argalshire\r\nSutherlanders. So it was read to me upon best authority.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA roar of laughter interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lists aren\xe2\x80\x99t even made out in the\r\nWar Office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill there be any force at Suakin?\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice.\r\n\r\nThen the outcries redoubled, and grew mixed, thus: \xe2\x80\x9cHow many Egyptian\r\ntroops will they use?\xe2\x80\x94God help the Fellaheen!\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s a railway in\r\nPlumstead marshes doing duty as a fives-court.\xe2\x80\x94We shall have the\r\nSuakin-Berber line built at last.\xe2\x80\x94Canadian voyageurs are too careful.\r\nGive me a half-drunk Krooman in a whale-boat.\xe2\x80\x94Who commands the Desert\r\ncolumn?\xe2\x80\x94No, they never blew up the big rock in the Ghineh bend. We\r\nshall have to be hauled up, as usual.\xe2\x80\x94Somebody tell me if there\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nIndian contingent, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll break everybody\xe2\x80\x99s head.\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t tear the map\r\nin two.\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s a war of occupation, I tell you, to connect with the\r\nAfrican companies in the South.\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s Guinea-worm in most of the\r\nwells on that route.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the Nilghai, despairing of peace, bellowed\r\nlike a fog-horn and beat upon the table with both hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what becomes of Torpenhow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, in the silence that\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTorp\xe2\x80\x99s in abeyance just now. He\xe2\x80\x99s off love-making somewhere, I\r\nsuppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said he was going to stay at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Keneu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, with an oath. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m not much good now, but\r\nif you and the Nilghai hold him down I\xe2\x80\x99ll engage to trample on him till\r\nhe sees reason. He\xe2\x80\x99ll stay behind, indeed! He\xe2\x80\x99s the best of you all.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be some tough work by Omdurman. We shall come there to stay,\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nBut I forgot. I wish I were going with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do we all, Dickie,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Keneu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I most of all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the new artist of the Central Southern\r\nSyndicate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you tell me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you one piece of advice,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick answered, moving towards the\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you happen to be cut over the head in a scrimmage, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nTell the man to go on cutting. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find it cheapest in the end.\r\nThanks for letting me look in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s grit in Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai, an hour later, when the room\r\nwas emptied of all save the Keneu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the sacred call of the war-trumpet. Did you notice how he\r\nanswered to it? Poor fellow! Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Keneu.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the talk had died away. Dick was sitting by the\r\nstudio table, with his head on his arms, when the men came in. He did\r\nnot change his position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt hurts,\xe2\x80\x9d he moaned. \xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive me, but it hurts cruelly; and yet,\r\ny\xe2\x80\x99know, the world has a knack of spinning round all by itself. Shall I\r\nsee Torp before he goes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun went down an hour ago,\r\n    I wonder if I face towards home;\r\nIf I lost my way in the light of day\r\n    How shall I find it now night is come?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Old Song_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaisie, come to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so hot I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie put her elbows on the window-sill and looked at the moonlight on\r\nthe straight, poplar-flanked road. Summer had come upon Vitry-sur-Marne\r\nand parched it to the bone. The grass was dry-burnt in the meadows, the\r\nclay by the bank of the river was caked to brick, the roadside flowers\r\nwere long since dead, and the roses in the garden hung withered on\r\ntheir stalks. The heat in the little low bedroom under the eaves was\r\nalmost intolerable. The very moonlight on the wall of Kami\xe2\x80\x99s studio\r\nacross the road seemed to make the night hotter, and the shadow of the\r\nbig bell-handle by the closed gate cast a bar of inky black that caught\r\nMaisie\xe2\x80\x99s eye and annoyed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrid thing! It should be all white,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the gate\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t in the middle of the wall, either. I never noticed that before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie was hard to please at that hour. First, the heat of the past few\r\nweeks had worn her down; secondly, her work, and particularly the study\r\nof a female head intended to represent the Melancolia and not finished\r\nin time for the Salon, was unsatisfactory; thirdly, Kami had said as\r\nmuch two days before; fourthly,\xe2\x80\x94but so completely fourthly that it was\r\nhardly worth thinking about,\xe2\x80\x94Dick, her property, had not written to her\r\nfor more than six weeks. She was angry with the heat, with Kami, and\r\nwith her work, but she was exceedingly angry with Dick.\r\n\r\nShe had written to him three times,\xe2\x80\x94each time proposing a fresh\r\ntreatment of her Melancolia. Dick had taken no notice of these\r\ncommunications. She had resolved to write no more. When she returned to\r\nEngland in the autumn\xe2\x80\x94for her pride\xe2\x80\x99s sake she could not return\r\nearlier\xe2\x80\x94she would speak to him. She missed the Sunday afternoon\r\nconferences more than she cared to admit. All that Kami said was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Continuez, mademoiselle, continuez toujours_,\xe2\x80\x9d and he had been\r\nrepeating the wearisome counsel through the hot summer, exactly like a\r\ncicada,\xe2\x80\x94an old gray cicada in a black alpaca coat, white trousers, and\r\na huge felt hat. But Dick had tramped masterfully up and down her\r\nlittle studio north of the cool green London park, and had said things\r\nten times worse than _continuez_, before he snatched the brush out of\r\nher hand and showed her where the error lay. His last letter, Maisie\r\nremembered, contained some trivial advice about not sketching in the\r\nsun or drinking water at wayside farmhouses; and he had said that not\r\nonce, but three times,\xe2\x80\x94as if he did not know that Maisie could take\r\ncare of herself.\r\n\r\nBut what was he doing, that he could not trouble to write? A murmur of\r\nvoices in the road made her lean from the window. A cavalryman of the\r\nlittle garrison in the town was talking to Kami\xe2\x80\x99s cook. The moonlight\r\nglittered on the scabbard of his sabre, which he was holding in his\r\nhand lest it should clank inopportunely. The cook\xe2\x80\x99s cap cast deep\r\nshadows on her face, which was close to the conscript\xe2\x80\x99s. He slid his\r\narm round her waist, and there followed the sound of a kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaugh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, stepping back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the red-haired girl, who was tossing uneasily\r\noutside her bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a conscript kissing the cook,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve gone away now.\xe2\x80\x9d She leaned out of the window again, and put a\r\nshawl over her nightgown to guard against chills. There was a very\r\nsmall night-breeze abroad, and a sun-baked rose below nodded its head\r\nas one who knew unutterable secrets. Was it possible that Dick should\r\nturn his thoughts from her work and his own and descend to the\r\ndegradation of Suzanne and the conscript? He could not! The rose nodded\r\nits head and one leaf therewith. It looked like a naughty little devil\r\nscratching its ear.\r\n\r\nDick could not, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Maisie, \xe2\x80\x9che is mine,\xe2\x80\x94mine,\xe2\x80\x94mine. He\r\nsaid he was. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what he does. It will only spoil his\r\nwork if he does; and it will spoil mine too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rose continued to nod in the futile way peculiar to flowers. There\r\nwas no earthly reason why Dick should not disport himself as he chose,\r\nexcept that he was called by Providence, which was Maisie, to assist\r\nMaisie in her work. And her work was the preparation of pictures that\r\nwent sometimes to English provincial exhibitions, as the notices in the\r\nscrap-book proved, and that were invariably rejected by the Salon when\r\nKami was plagued into allowing her to send them up. Her work in the\r\nfuture, it seemed, would be the preparation of pictures on exactly\r\nsimilar lines which would be rejected in exactly the same way\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nred-haired girl threshed distressfully across the sheets. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too hot\r\nto sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d she moaned; and the interruption jarred.\r\n\r\nExactly the same way. Then she would divide her years between the\r\nlittle studio in England and Kami\xe2\x80\x99s big studio at Vitry-sur-Marne. No,\r\nshe would go to another master, who should force her into the success\r\nthat was her right, if patient toil and desperate endeavour gave one a\r\nright to anything. Dick had told her that he had worked ten years to\r\nunderstand his craft. She had worked ten years, and ten years were\r\nnothing. Dick had said that ten years were nothing,\xe2\x80\x94but that was in\r\nregard to herself only. He had said\xe2\x80\x94this very man who could not find\r\ntime to write\xe2\x80\x94that he would wait ten years for her, and that she was\r\nbound to come back to him sooner or later. He had said this in the\r\nabsurd letter about sunstroke and diphtheria; and then he had stopped\r\nwriting. He was wandering up and down moonlit streets, kissing cooks.\r\nShe would like to lecture him now,\xe2\x80\x94not in her nightgown, of course, but\r\nproperly dressed, severely and from a height. Yet if he was kissing\r\nother girls he certainly would not care whether she lectured him or\r\nnot. He would laugh at her. Very good.\r\n\r\nShe would go back to her studio and prepare pictures that went, etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe mill-wheel of thought swung round slowly, that no section of it\r\nmight be slurred over, and the red-haired girl tossed and turned behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMaisie put her chin in her hands and decided that there could be no\r\ndoubt whatever of the villainy of Dick. To justify herself, she began,\r\nunwomanly, to weigh the evidence. There was a boy, and he had said he\r\nloved her. And he kissed her,\xe2\x80\x94kissed her on the cheek,\xe2\x80\x94by a yellow\r\nsea-poppy that nodded its head exactly like the maddening dry rose in\r\nthe garden. Then there was an interval, and men had told her that they\r\nloved her\xe2\x80\x94just when she was busiest with her work. Then the boy came\r\nback, and at their very second meeting had told her that he loved her.\r\nThen he had\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 But there was no end to the things he had done. He had\r\ngiven her his time and his powers. He had spoken to her of Art,\r\nhousekeeping, technique, teacups, the abuse of pickles as a\r\nstimulant,\xe2\x80\x94that was rude,\xe2\x80\x94sable hair-brushes,\xe2\x80\x94he had given her the best\r\nin her stock,\xe2\x80\x94she used them daily; he had given her advice that she\r\nprofited by, and now and again\xe2\x80\x94a look. Such a look! The look of a\r\nbeaten hound waiting for the word to crawl to his mistress\xe2\x80\x99s feet. In\r\nreturn she had given him nothing whatever, except\xe2\x80\x94here she brushed her\r\nmouth against the open-work sleeve of her nightgown\xe2\x80\x94the privilege of\r\nkissing her once. And on the mouth, too. Disgraceful! Was that not\r\nenough, and more than enough? and if it was not, had he not cancelled\r\nthe debt by not writing and\xe2\x80\x94probably kissing other girls? \xe2\x80\x9cMaisie,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll catch a chill. Do go and lie down,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wearied voice of\r\nher companion. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep a wink with you at the window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie shrugged her shoulders and did not answer. She was reflecting on\r\nthe meannesses of Dick, and on other meannesses with which he had\r\nnothing to do. The moonlight would not let her sleep. It lay on the\r\nskylight of the studio across the road in cold silver; she stared at it\r\nintently and her thoughts began to slide one into the other. The shadow\r\nof the big bell-handle in the wall grew short, lengthened again, and\r\nfaded out as the moon went down behind the pasture and a hare came\r\nlimping home across the road. Then the dawn-wind washed through the\r\nupland grasses, and brought coolness with it, and the cattle lowed by\r\nthe drought-shrunk river. Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s head fell forward on the\r\nwindow-sill, and the tangle of black hair covered her arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaisie, wake up. You\xe2\x80\x99ll catch a chill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear; yes, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d She staggered to her bed like a wearied child,\r\nand as she buried her face in the pillows she muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cI think\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nthink....\r\n\r\nBut he ought to have written.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDay brought the routine of the studio, the smell of paint and\r\nturpentine, and the monotone wisdom of Kami, who was a leaden artist,\r\nbut a golden teacher if the pupil were only in sympathy with him.\r\nMaisie was not in sympathy that day, and she waited impatiently for the\r\nend of the work. She knew when it was coming; for Kami would gather his\r\nblack alpaca coat into a bunch behind him, and, with faded blue eyes\r\nthat saw neither pupils nor canvas, look back into the past to recall\r\nthe history of one Binat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have all done not so badly,\xe2\x80\x9d he would\r\nsay. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you shall remember that it is not enough to have the method,\r\nand the art, and the power, nor even that which is touch, but you shall\r\nhave also the conviction that nails the work to the wall. Of the so\r\nmany I taught,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here the students would begin to unfix drawing-pins or\r\nget their tubes together,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe very so many that I have taught, the\r\nbest was Binat. All that comes of the study and the work and the\r\nknowledge was to him even when he came. After he left me he should have\r\ndone all that could be done with the colour, the form, and the\r\nknowledge. Only, he had not the conviction. So to-day I hear no more of\r\nBinat,\xe2\x80\x94the best of my pupils,\xe2\x80\x94and that is long ago. So to-day, too, you\r\nwill be glad to hear no more of me. _Continuez, mesdemoiselles_, and,\r\nabove all, with conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went into the garden to smoke and mourn over the lost Binat as the\r\npupils dispersed to their several cottages or loitered in the studio to\r\nmake plans for the cool of the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMaisie looked at her very unhappy Melancolia, restrained a desire to\r\ngrimace before it, and was hurrying across the road to write a letter\r\nto Dick, when she was aware of a large man on a white troop-horse. How\r\nTorpenhow had managed in the course of twenty hours to find his way to\r\nthe hearts of the cavalry officers in quarters at Vitry-sur-Marne, to\r\ndiscuss with them the certainty of a glorious revenge for France, to\r\nreduce the colonel to tears of pure affability, and to borrow the best\r\nhorse in the squadron for the journey to Kami\xe2\x80\x99s studio, is a mystery\r\nthat only special correspondents can unravel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems an absurd question to ask, but\r\nthe fact is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know her by any other name: Is there any young\r\nlady here that is called Maisie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Maisie,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer from the depths of a great sun-hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to introduce myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as the horse capered in the\r\nblinding white dust. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Torpenhow. Dick Heldar is my best\r\nfriend, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94the fact is that he has gone blind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlind!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, stupidly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t be blind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been stone-blind for nearly two months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie lifted up her face, and it was pearly white. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! No! Not blind!\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t have him blind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you care to see for yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x94at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! The Paris train doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go through this place till to-night.\r\nThere will be ample time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Mr. Heldar send you to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. Dick wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that sort of thing. He\xe2\x80\x99s sitting in\r\nhis studio, turning over some letters that he can\xe2\x80\x99t read because he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of choking from the sun-hat. Maisie bowed her head\r\nand went into the cottage, where the red-haired girl was on a sofa,\r\ncomplaining of a headache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick\xe2\x80\x99s blind!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maisie, taking her breath quickly as she steadied\r\nherself against a chair-back. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Dick\xe2\x80\x99s blind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d The girl was on the sofa no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man has come from England to tell me. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t written to me for\r\nsix weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink! _I_ should go back to London and see him and I should kiss his\r\neyes and kiss them and kiss them until they got well again! If you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t go I shall. Oh, what am I talking about? You wicked little idiot!\r\nGo to him at once. Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s neck was blistering, but he preserved a smile of infinite\r\npatience as Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s appeared bareheaded in the sunshine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, her eyes on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be at Vitry Station, then, at seven this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d This was\r\nan order delivered by one who was used to being obeyed. Maisie said\r\nnothing, but she felt grateful that there was no chance of disputing\r\nwith this big man who took everything for granted and managed a\r\nsquealing horse with one hand. She returned to the red-haired girl, who\r\nwas weeping bitterly, and between tears, kisses,\xe2\x80\x94very few of\r\nthose,\xe2\x80\x94menthol, packing, and an interview with Kami, the sultry\r\nafternoon wore away.\r\n\r\nThought might come afterwards. Her present duty was to go to Dick,\xe2\x80\x94Dick\r\nwho owned the wondrous friend and sat in the dark playing with her\r\nunopened letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what will you do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Oh, I shall stay here and\xe2\x80\x94finish your Melancolia,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nsmiling pitifully. \xe2\x80\x9cWrite to me afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night there ran a legend through Vitry-sur-Marne of a mad\r\nEnglishman, doubtless suffering from sunstroke, who had drunk all the\r\nofficers of the garrison under the table, had borrowed a horse from the\r\nlines, and had then and there eloped, after the English custom, with\r\none of those more mad English girls who drew pictures down there under\r\nthe care of that good Monsieur Kami.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are very droll,\xe2\x80\x9d said Suzanne to the conscript in the moonlight\r\nby the studio wall. \xe2\x80\x9cShe walked always with those big eyes that saw\r\nnothing, and yet she kisses me on both cheeks as though she were my\r\nsister, and gives me\xe2\x80\x94see\xe2\x80\x94ten francs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conscript levied a contribution on both gifts; for he prided\r\nhimself on being a good soldier.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow spoke very little to Maisie during the journey to Calais; but\r\nhe was careful to attend to all her wants, to get her a compartment\r\nentirely to herself, and to leave her alone. He was amazed of the ease\r\nwith which the matter had been accomplished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe safest thing would be to let her think things out. By Dick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshowing,\xe2\x80\x94when he was off his head,\xe2\x80\x94she must have ordered him about very\r\nthoroughly. Wonder how she likes being under orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie never told. She sat in the empty compartment often with her eyes\r\nshut, that she might realise the sensation of blindness. It was an\r\norder that she should return to London swiftly, and she found herself\r\nat last almost beginning to enjoy the situation. This was better than\r\nlooking after luggage and a red-haired friend who never took any\r\ninterest in her surroundings. But there appeared to be a feeling in the\r\nair that she, Maisie,\xe2\x80\x94of all people,\xe2\x80\x94was in disgrace. Therefore she\r\njustified her conduct to herself with great success, till Torpenhow\r\ncame up to her on the steamer and without preface began to tell the\r\nstory of Dick\xe2\x80\x99s blindness, suppressing a few details, but dwelling at\r\nlength on the miseries of delirium. He stopped before he reached the\r\nend, as though he had lost interest in the subject, and went forward to\r\nsmoke. Maisie was furious with him and with herself.\r\n\r\nShe was hurried on from Dover to London almost before she could ask for\r\nbreakfast, and\xe2\x80\x94she was past any feeling of indignation now\xe2\x80\x94was bidden\r\ncurtly to wait in a hall at the foot of some lead-covered stairs while\r\nTorpenhow went up to make inquiries. Again the knowledge that she was\r\nbeing treated like a naughty little girl made her pale cheeks flame. It\r\nwas all Dick\xe2\x80\x99s fault for being so stupid as to go blind.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow led her up to a shut door, which he opened very softly. Dick\r\nwas sitting by the window, with his chin on his chest. There were three\r\nenvelopes in his hand, and he turned them over and over. The big man\r\nwho gave orders was no longer by her side, and the studio door snapped\r\nbehind her.\r\n\r\nDick thrust the letters into his pocket as he heard the sound. \xe2\x80\x9cHullo,\r\nTorp! Is that you? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so lonely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice had taken the peculiar flatness of the blind. Maisie pressed\r\nherself up into a corner of the room. Her heart was beating furiously,\r\nand she put one hand on her breast to keep it quiet. Dick was staring\r\ndirectly at her, and she realised for the first time that he was blind.\r\nShutting her eyes in a railway-carriage to open them when she pleased\r\nwas child\xe2\x80\x99s play. This man was blind though his eyes were wide open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTorp, is that you? They said you were coming.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick looked puzzled and\r\na little irritated at the silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it\xe2\x80\x99s only me,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, in a strained little whisper.\r\nMaisie could hardly move her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, composedly, without moving. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a new\r\nphenomenon. Darkness I\xe2\x80\x99m getting used to; but I object to hearing\r\nvoices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas he mad, then, as well as blind, that he talked to himself? Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart beat more wildly, and she breathed in gasps. Dick rose and began\r\nto feel his way across the room, touching each table and chair as he\r\npassed. Once he caught his foot on a rug, and swore, dropping on his\r\nknees to feel what the obstruction might be. Maisie remembered him\r\nwalking in the Park as though all the earth belonged to him, tramping\r\nup and down her studio two months ago, and flying up the gangway of the\r\nChannel steamer. The beating of her heart was making her sick, and Dick\r\nwas coming nearer, guided by the sound of her breathing. She put out a\r\nhand mechanically to ward him off or to draw him to herself, she did\r\nnot know which. It touched his chest, and he stepped back as though he\r\nhad been shot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Maisie!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a dry sob. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came\xe2\x80\x94I came\xe2\x80\x94to see you, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s lips closed firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down, then? You see, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had some bother with my eyes,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. I know. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have told Mr. Torpenhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has he to do with my affairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x94he brought me from Vitry-sur-Marne. He thought I ought to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what has happened? Can I do anything for you? No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\r\nforgot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dick, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry! I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to tell you, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Let me take you\r\nback to your chair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t! I\xe2\x80\x99m not a child. You only do that out of pity. I never meant to\r\ntell you anything about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m no good now. I\xe2\x80\x99m down and done for. Let\r\nme alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe groped back to his chair, his chest labouring as he sat down.\r\n\r\nMaisie watched him, and the fear went out of her heart, to be followed\r\nby a very bitter shame. He had spoken a truth that had been hidden from\r\nthe girl through every step of the impetuous flight to London; for he\r\nwas, indeed, down and done for\xe2\x80\x94masterful no longer but rather a little\r\nabject; neither an artist stronger than she, nor a man to be looked up\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94only some blind one that sat in a chair and seemed on the point of\r\ncrying. She was immensely and unfeignedly sorry for him\xe2\x80\x94more sorry than\r\nshe had ever been for any one in her life, but not sorry enough to deny\r\nhis words.\r\n\r\nSo she stood still and felt ashamed and a little hurt, because she had\r\nhonestly intended that her journey should end triumphantly; and now she\r\nwas only filled with pity most startlingly distinct from love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, his face steadily turned away. \xe2\x80\x9cI never meant to\r\nworry you any more. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was conscious that Maisie was catching her breath, but was as\r\nunprepared as herself for the torrent of emotion that followed. She had\r\ndropped into a chair and was sobbing with her face hidden in her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried desperately. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t my\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. Oh, Dickie, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders straightened again, for the words lashed like a whip.\r\n\r\nStill the sobbing continued. It is not good to realise that you have\r\nfailed in the hour of trial or flinched before the mere possibility of\r\nmaking sacrifices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do despise myself\xe2\x80\x94indeed I do. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Oh, Dickie, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nask me\xe2\x80\x94would you?\xe2\x80\x9d wailed Maisie.\r\n\r\nShe looked up for a minute, and by chance it happened that Dick\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nfell on hers. The unshaven face was very white and set, and the lips\r\nwere trying to force themselves into a smile. But it was the worn-out\r\neyes that Maisie feared. Her Dick had gone blind and left in his place\r\nsome one that she could hardly recognise till he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is asking you to do anything, Maisie? I told you how it would be.\r\n\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of worrying? For pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t cry like that; it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t worth it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I hate myself. Oh, Dick, help me\xe2\x80\x94help me!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\npassion of tears had grown beyond her control and was beginning to\r\nalarm the man. He stumbled forward and put his arm round her, and her\r\nhead fell on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, dear, hush! Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry. You\xe2\x80\x99re quite right, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to\r\nreproach yourself with\xe2\x80\x94you never had. You\xe2\x80\x99re only a little upset by the\r\njourney, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve had any breakfast. What a brute\r\nTorp was to bring you over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to come. I did indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. And now you\xe2\x80\x99ve come and seen, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94immensely grateful.\r\n\r\nWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re better you shall go away and get something to eat. What\r\nsort of a passage did you have coming over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaisie was crying more subduedly, for the first time in her life glad\r\nthat she had something to lean against. Dick patted her on the shoulder\r\ntenderly but clumsily, for he was not quite sure where her shoulder\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\nShe drew herself out of his arms at last and waited, trembling and most\r\nunhappy. He had felt his way to the window to put the width of the room\r\nbetween them, and to quiet a little the tumult in his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you better now?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you hate me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate you? My God! I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t there anything I could do for you, then? I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here in\r\nEngland to do it, if you like. Perhaps I could come and see you\r\nsometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not, dear. It would be kindest not to see me any more, please.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to seem rude, but\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\xe2\x80\x94perhaps you had almost\r\nbetter go now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was conscious that he could not bear himself as a man if the strain\r\ncontinued much longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve anything else. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go, Dick. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. You\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to worry about; I\xe2\x80\x99d tell you if you had. Wait\r\na moment, dear. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got something to give you first. I meant it for\r\nyou ever since this little trouble began. It\xe2\x80\x99s my Melancolia; she was a\r\nbeauty when I last saw her. You can keep her for me, and if ever you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\npoor you can sell her. She\xe2\x80\x99s worth a few hundreds at any state of the\r\nmarket.\xe2\x80\x9d He groped among his canvases. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s framed in black. Is this\r\na black frame that I have my hand on? There she is. What do you think\r\nof her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned a scarred formless muddle of paint towards Maisie, and the\r\neyes strained as though they would catch her wonder and surprise. One\r\nthing and one thing only could she do for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice was fuller and more rounded, because the man knew he was\r\nspeaking of his best work. Maisie looked at the blur, and a lunatic\r\ndesire to laugh caught her by the throat. But for Dick\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x94whatever\r\nthis mad blankness might mean\xe2\x80\x94she must make no sign. Her voice choked\r\nwith hard-held tears as she answered, still gazing at the wreck\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dick, it _is_ good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe heard the little hysterical gulp and took it for tribute. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nhave it, then? I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it over to your house if you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Oh yes\xe2\x80\x94thank you. Ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d If she did not fly at once the laughter\r\nthat was worse than tears would kill her. She turned and ran, choking\r\nand blinded, down the staircases that were empty of life to take refuge\r\nin a cab and go to her house across the Parks. There she sat down in\r\nthe dismantled drawing-room and thought of Dick in his blindness,\r\nuseless till the end of life, and of herself in her own eyes. Behind\r\nthe sorrow, the shame, and the humiliation, lay fear of the cold wrath\r\nof the red-haired girl when Maisie should return. Maisie had never\r\nfeared her companion before. Not until she found herself saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nhe never asked me,\xe2\x80\x9d did she realise her scorn of herself.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the end of Maisie.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Dick was reserved more searching torment. He could not realise at\r\nfirst that Maisie, whom he had ordered to go had left him without a\r\nword of farewell. He was savagely angry against Torpenhow, who had\r\nbrought upon him this humiliation and troubled his miserable peace.\r\nThen his dark hour came and he was alone with himself and his desires\r\nto get what help he could from the darkness. The queen could do no\r\nwrong, but in following the right, so far as it served her work, she\r\nhad wounded her one subject more than his own brain would let him know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all I had and I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as soon as the misery\r\npermitted clear thinking. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Torp will think that he has been so\r\ninfernally clever that I shan\xe2\x80\x99t have the heart to tell him. I must\r\nthink this out quietly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow, entering the studio after Dick had enjoyed two\r\nhours of thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m back. Are you feeling any better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTorp, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say. Come here.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick coughed huskily,\r\nwondering, indeed, what he should say, and how to say it temperately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the need for saying anything? Get up and tramp.\xe2\x80\x9d Torpenhow was\r\nperfectly satisfied.\r\n\r\nThey walked up and down as of custom, Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s hand on Dick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder, and Dick buried in his own thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow in the world did you find it all out?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go off your head if you want to keep secrets, Dickie. It\r\nwas absolutely impertinent on my part; but if you\xe2\x80\x99d seen me rocketing\r\nabout on a half-trained French troop-horse under a blazing sun you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave laughed. There will be a charivari in my rooms to-night. Seven\r\nother devils\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94the row in the Southern Soudan. I surprised their councils the\r\nother day, and it made me unhappy. Have you fixed your flint to go? Who\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99you work for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t signed any contracts yet. I wanted to see how your business\r\nwould turn out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you have stayed with me, then, if\xe2\x80\x94things had gone wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d He put\r\nhis question cautiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me too much. I\xe2\x80\x99m only a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to be an angel very successfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh ye\xe2\x80\x94es!... Well, do you attend the function to-night? We shall be\r\nhalf screwed before the morning. All the men believe the war\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncertainty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I will, old man, if it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay\r\nquiet here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd meditate? I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you. You observe a good time if ever a man\r\ndid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night there was a tumult on the stairs. The correspondents poured\r\nin from theatre, dinner, and music-hall to Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s room that they\r\nmight discuss their plan of campaign in the event of military\r\noperations becoming a certainty. Torpenhow, the Keneu, and the Nilghai\r\nhad bidden all the men they had worked with to the orgy; and Mr.\r\nBeeton, the housekeeper, declared that never before in his checkered\r\nexperience had he seen quite such a fancy lot of gentlemen. They waked\r\nthe chambers with shoutings and song; and the elder men were quite as\r\nbad as the younger. For the chances of war were in front of them, and\r\nall knew what those meant.\r\n\r\nSitting in his own room a little perplexed by the noise across the\r\nlanding, Dick suddenly began to laugh to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen one comes to think of it the situation is intensely comic.\r\nMaisie\xe2\x80\x99s quite right\xe2\x80\x94poor little thing. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know she could cry\r\nlike that before; but now I know what Torp thinks, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nquite fool enough to stay at home and try to console me\xe2\x80\x94if he knew.\r\nBesides, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t nice to own that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been thrown over like a\r\nbroken chair. I must carry this business through alone\xe2\x80\x94as usual. If\r\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a war, and Torp finds out, I shall look foolish, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall. If there is a way I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with another man\xe2\x80\x99s chances.\r\nBusiness is business, and I want to be alone\xe2\x80\x94I want to be alone. What a\r\nrow they\xe2\x80\x99re making!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomebody hammered at the studio door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome out and frolic, Dickie,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Nilghai.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m not feeling frolicsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the boys and they\xe2\x80\x99ll drag you like a badger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease not, old man. On my word, I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner be left alone just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Can we send anything in to you? Fizz, for instance.\r\n\r\nCassavetti is beginning to sing songs of the Sunny South already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor one minute Dick considered the proposition seriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thanks, I\xe2\x80\x99ve a headache already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVirtuous child. That\xe2\x80\x99s the effect of emotion on the young. All my\r\ncongratulations, Dick. I also was concerned in the conspiracy for your\r\nwelfare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the devil\xe2\x80\x94oh, send Binkie in here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little dog entered on elastic feet, riotous from having been made\r\nmuch of all the evening. He had helped to sing the choruses; but\r\nscarcely inside the studio he realised that this was no place for\r\ntail-wagging, and settled himself on Dick\xe2\x80\x99s lap till it was bedtime.\r\nThen he went to bed with Dick, who counted every hour as it struck, and\r\nrose in the morning with a painfully clear head to receive Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore formal congratulations and a particular account of the last\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s revels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking very happy for a newly accepted man,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTorpenhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s my own affair, and I\xe2\x80\x99m all right. Do you really\r\ngo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. With the old Central Southern as usual. They wired, and I\r\naccepted on better terms than before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you start?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day after to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94for Brindisi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick spoke from the bottom of his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a pretty way of saying you\xe2\x80\x99re glad to get rid of me.\r\nBut men in your condition are allowed to be selfish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that. Will you get a hundred pounds cashed for me before\r\nyou leave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a slender amount for housekeeping, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s only for\xe2\x80\x94marriage expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTorpenhow brought him the money, counted it out in fives and tens, and\r\ncarefully put it away in the writing table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I suppose I shall have to listen to his ravings about his girl\r\nuntil I go. Heaven send us patience with a man in love!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut never a word did Dick say of Maisie or marriage. He hung in the\r\ndoorway of Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s room when the latter was packing and asked\r\ninnumerable questions about the coming campaign, till Torpenhow began\r\nto feel annoyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a secretive animal, Dickie, and you consume your own smoke,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said on the last evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I suppose so. By the way, how long do you think this war will last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDays, weeks, or months. One can never tell. It may go on for years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I were going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heavens! You\xe2\x80\x99re the most unaccountable creature! Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\noccurred to you that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be married\xe2\x80\x94thanks to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, yes. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be married\xe2\x80\x94so I am. Going to be married.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully grateful to you. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I told you that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might be going to be hanged by the look of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Torpenhow.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day Torpenhow bade him good-bye and left him to the\r\nloneliness he had so much desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nYet at the last, ere our spearmen had found him,\r\n    Yet at the last, ere a sword-thrust could save,\r\nYet at the last, with his masters around him,\r\n    He of the Faith spoke as master to slave;\r\nYet at the last, tho\xe2\x80\x99 the Kafirs had maimed him,\r\n    Broken by bondage and wrecked by the reiver,\xe2\x80\x94\r\nYet at the last, tho\xe2\x80\x99 the darkness had claimed him,\r\n    He called upon Allah and died a believer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Kizzilbashi_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg your pardon, Mr. Heldar, but\xe2\x80\x94but isn\xe2\x80\x99t nothin\xe2\x80\x99 going to happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Beeton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d Dick had just waked to another morning of blank despair and his\r\ntemper was of the shortest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t my regular business, o\xe2\x80\x99 course, sir; and what I say is, \xe2\x80\x9cMind\r\nyour own business and let other people mind theirs;\xe2\x80\x9d but just before\r\nMr. Torpenhow went away he give me to understand, like, that you might\r\nbe moving into a house of your own, so to speak\xe2\x80\x94a sort of house with\r\nrooms upstairs and downstairs where you\xe2\x80\x99d be better attended to, though\r\nI try to act just by all our tenants. Don\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! That must have been a mad-house. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you to take me\r\nthere yet. Get me my breakfast, please, and leave me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done anything wrong, sir, but you know I hope that as\r\nfar as a man can I tries to do the proper thing by all the gentlemen in\r\nchambers\xe2\x80\x94and more particular those whose lot is hard\xe2\x80\x94such as you, for\r\ninstance, Mr. Heldar. You likes soft-roe bloater, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Soft-roe\r\nbloaters is scarcer than hard-roe, but what I says is, \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind a\r\nlittle extra trouble so long as you give satisfaction to the tenants.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Beeton withdrew and left Dick to himself. Torpenhow had been long\r\naway; there was no more rioting in the chambers, and Dick had settled\r\ndown to his new life, which he was weak enough to consider nothing\r\nbetter than death.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to live alone in the dark, confusing the day and night;\r\ndropping to sleep through sheer weariness at mid-day, and rising\r\nrestless in the chill of the dawn. At first Dick, on his awakenings,\r\nwould grope along the corridors of the chambers till he heard some one\r\nsnore. Then he would know that the day had not yet come, and return\r\nwearily to his bedroom.\r\n\r\nLater he learned not to stir till there was a noise and movement in the\r\nhouse and Mr. Beeton advised him to get up. Once dressed\xe2\x80\x94and dressing,\r\nnow that Torpenhow was away, was a lengthy business, because collars,\r\nties, and the like hid themselves in far corners of the room, and\r\nsearch meant head-beating against chairs and trunks\xe2\x80\x94once dressed, there\r\nwas nothing whatever to do except to sit still and brood till the three\r\ndaily meals came. Centuries separated breakfast from lunch and lunch\r\nfrom dinner, and though a man prayed for hundreds of years that his\r\nmind might be taken from him, God would never hear. Rather the mind was\r\nquickened and the revolving thoughts ground against each other as\r\nmillstones grind when there is no corn between; and yet the brain would\r\nnot wear out and give him rest. It continued to think, at length, with\r\nimagery and all manner of reminiscences. It recalled Maisie and past\r\nsuccess, reckless travels by land and sea, the glory of doing work and\r\nfeeling that it was good, and suggested all that might have happened\r\nhad the eyes only been faithful to their duty. When thinking ceased\r\nthrough sheer weariness, there poured into Dick\xe2\x80\x99s soul tide on tide of\r\noverwhelming, purposeless fear\xe2\x80\x94dread of starvation always, terror lest\r\nthe unseen ceiling should crush down upon him, fear of fire in the\r\nchambers and a louse\xe2\x80\x99s death in red flame, and agonies of fiercer\r\nhorror that had nothing to do with any fear of death. Then Dick bowed\r\nhis head, and clutching the arms of his chair fought with his sweating\r\nself till the tinkle of plates told him that something to eat was being\r\nset before him.\r\n\r\nMr. Beeton would bring the meal when he had time to spare, and Dick\r\nlearned to hang upon his speech, which dealt with badly fitted\r\ngas-plugs, waste-pipes out of repair, little tricks for driving\r\npicture-nails into walls, and the sins of the charwoman or the\r\nhousemaids. In the lack of better things the small gossip of a\r\nservant\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 hall becomes immensely interesting, and the screwing of a\r\nwasher on a tap an event to be talked over for days.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice a week, too, Mr. Beeton would take Dick out with him when\r\nhe went marketing in the morning to haggle with tradesmen over fish,\r\nlamp-wicks, mustard, tapioca, and so forth, while Dick rested his\r\nweight first on one foot and then on the other and played aimlessly\r\nwith the tins and string-ball on the counter. Then they would perhaps\r\nmeet one of Mr. Beeton\xe2\x80\x99s friends, and Dick, standing aside a little,\r\nwould hold his peace till Mr. Beeton was willing to go on again.\r\n\r\nThe life did not increase his self-respect. He abandoned shaving as a\r\ndangerous exercise, and being shaved in a barber\xe2\x80\x99s shop meant exposure\r\nof his infirmity. He could not see that his clothes were properly\r\nbrushed, and since he had never taken any care of his personal\r\nappearance he became every known variety of sloven. A blind man cannot\r\ndeal with cleanliness till he has been some months used to the\r\ndarkness. If he demand attendance and grow angry at the want of it, he\r\nmust assert himself and stand upright. Then the meanest menial can see\r\nthat he is blind and, therefore, of no consequence. A wise man will\r\nkeep his eyes on the floor and sit still. For amusement he may pick\r\ncoal lump by lump out of the scuttle with the tongs and pile it in a\r\nlittle heap in the fender, keeping count of the lumps, which must all\r\nbe put back again, one by one and very carefully. He may set himself\r\nsums if he cares to work them out; he may talk to himself or to the cat\r\nif she chooses to visit him; and if his trade has been that of an\r\nartist, he may sketch in the air with his forefinger; but that is too\r\nmuch like drawing a pig with the eyes shut. He may go to his\r\nbookshelves and count his books, ranging them in order of their size;\r\nor to his wardrobe and count his shirts, laying them in piles of two or\r\nthree on the bed, as they suffer from frayed cuffs or lost buttons.\r\n\r\nEven this entertainment wearies after a time; and all the times are\r\nvery, very long.\r\n\r\nDick was allowed to sort a tool-chest where Mr. Beeton kept hammers,\r\ntaps and nuts, lengths of gas-pipes, oil-bottles, and string.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t have everything just where I know where to look for it,\r\nwhy, then, I can\xe2\x80\x99t find anything when I do want it. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea,\r\nsir, the amount of little things that these chambers uses up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBeeton. Fumbling at the handle of the door as he went out: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard\r\non you, sir, I _do_ think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard on you. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you going to do\r\nanything, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay my rent and messing. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doubting for a moment that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay your way, sir;\r\nbut I \xe2\x80\x99ave often said to my wife, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99ard on \xe2\x80\x99im because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t as\r\nif he was an old man, nor yet a middle-aged one, but quite a young\r\ngentleman. _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ where it comes so \xe2\x80\x99ard.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, absently. This particular nerve through long\r\nbattering had ceased to feel\xe2\x80\x94much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Beeton, still making as if to go, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nyou might like to hear my boy Alf read you the papers sometimes of an\r\nevening. He do read beautiful, seeing he\xe2\x80\x99s only nine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be very grateful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly let me make it worth his\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of _that_, sir, but of course it\xe2\x80\x99s in your own\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ands; but only to \xe2\x80\x99ear Alf sing \xe2\x80\x98A Boy\xe2\x80\x99s best Friend is \xe2\x80\x99is Mother!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him sing that too. Let him come this evening with the\r\nnewspapers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlf was not a nice child, being puffed up with many school-board\r\ncertificates for good conduct, and inordinately proud of his singing.\r\nMr. Beeton remained, beaming, while the child wailed his way through a\r\nsong of some eight eight-line verses in the usual whine of a young\r\nCockney, and, after compliments, left him to read Dick the foreign\r\ntelegrams. Ten minutes later Alf returned to his parents rather pale\r\nand scared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99E said \xe2\x80\x99e couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it no more,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never said you read badly, Alf?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Beeton spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. \xe2\x80\x99E said I read beautiful. Said \xe2\x80\x99e never \xe2\x80\x99eard any one read like\r\nthat, but \xe2\x80\x99e said \xe2\x80\x99e couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abide the stuff in the papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP\xe2\x80\x99raps he\xe2\x80\x99s lost some money in the Stocks. Were you readin\xe2\x80\x99 him about\r\nStocks, Alf?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it was all about fightin\xe2\x80\x99 out there where the soldiers is gone\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngreat long piece with all the lines close together and very hard words\r\nin it. \xe2\x80\x99E give me \xe2\x80\x99arf a crown because I read so well. And \xe2\x80\x99e says the\r\nnext time there\xe2\x80\x99s anything \xe2\x80\x99e wants read \xe2\x80\x99e\xe2\x80\x99ll send for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s good hearing, but I do think for all the half-crown\xe2\x80\x94put it into\r\nthe kicking-donkey money-box, Alf, and let me see you do it\xe2\x80\x94he might\r\nhave kept you longer. Why, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have begun to understand how\r\nbeautiful you read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s best left to hisself\xe2\x80\x94gentlemen always are when they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndownhearted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Beeton.\r\n\r\nAlf\xe2\x80\x99s rigorously limited powers of comprehending Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s special\r\ncorrespondence had waked the devil of unrest in Dick. He could hear,\r\nthrough the boy\xe2\x80\x99s nasal chant, the camels grunting in the squares\r\nbehind the soldiers outside Suakin; could hear the men swearing and\r\nchaffing across the cooking pots, and could smell the acrid wood-smoke\r\nas it drifted over camp before the wind of the desert.\r\n\r\nThat night he prayed to God that his mind might be taken from him,\r\noffering for proof that he was worthy of this favour the fact that he\r\nhad not shot himself long ago. That prayer was not answered, and indeed\r\nDick knew in his heart of hearts that only a lingering sense of humour\r\nand no special virtue had kept him alive. Suicide, he had persuaded\r\nhimself, would be a ludicrous insult to the gravity of the situation as\r\nwell as a weak-kneed confession of fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust for the fun of the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the cat, who had taken\r\nBinkie\xe2\x80\x99s place in his establishment, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know how long\r\nthis is going to last. I can live for a year on the hundred pounds Torp\r\ncashed for me. I must have two or three thousand at least in the\r\nBank\xe2\x80\x94twenty or thirty years more provided for, that is to say. Then I\r\nfall back on my hundred and twenty a year, which will be more by that\r\ntime. Let\xe2\x80\x99s consider.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five\xe2\x80\x94thirty-five\xe2\x80\x94a man\xe2\x80\x99s in his prime then, they\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94forty-five\xe2\x80\x94a middle-aged man just entering\r\npolitics\xe2\x80\x94fifty-five\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdied at the comparatively early age of\r\nfifty-five,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the newspapers. Bah! How these Christians\r\nfunk death! Sixty-five\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re only getting on in years. Seventy-five is\r\njust possible, though. Great hell, cat O! fifty years more of solitary\r\nconfinement in the dark! You\xe2\x80\x99ll die, and Beeton will die, and Torp will\r\ndie, and Mai\xe2\x80\x94everybody else will die, but I shall be alive and kicking\r\nwith nothing to do. I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry for myself. I should like some one\r\nelse to be sorry for me. Evidently I\xe2\x80\x99m not going mad before I die, but\r\nthe pain\xe2\x80\x99s just as bad as ever. Some day when you\xe2\x80\x99re vivisected, cat O!\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll tie you down on a little table and cut you open\xe2\x80\x94but don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nafraid; they\xe2\x80\x99ll take precious good care that you don\xe2\x80\x99t die. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlive, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be very sorry then that you weren\xe2\x80\x99t sorry for me.\r\nPerhaps Torp will come back or... I wish I could go to Torp and the\r\nNilghai, even though I were in their way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPussy left the room before the speech was ended, and Alf, as he\r\nentered, found Dick addressing the empty hearth-rug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a letter for you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d like me to\r\nread it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLend it to me for a minute and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe outstretched hand shook just a little and the voice was not\r\nover-steady. It was within the limits of human possibility that\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwas no letter from Maisie. He knew the heft of three closed envelopes\r\nonly too well. It was a foolish hope that the girl should write to him,\r\nfor he did not realise that there is a wrong which admits of no\r\nreparation though the evildoer may with tears and the heart\xe2\x80\x99s best love\r\nstrive to mend all. It is best to forget that wrong whether it be\r\ncaused or endured, since it is as remediless as bad work once put\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead it, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, and Alf began intoning according to the\r\nrules of the Board School\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_I could have given you love, I could have given you loyalty, such as\r\nyou never dreamed of. Do you suppose I cared what you were? But you\r\nchose to whistle everything down the wind for nothing. My only excuse\r\nfor you is that you are so young._\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, returning the paper to be dropped into the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was in the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Beeton, when Alf returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I think it was a circular or a tract about not whistlin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nat everything when you\xe2\x80\x99re young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have stepped on something when I was alive and walking about\r\nand it has bounced up and hit me. God help it, whatever it is\xe2\x80\x94unless it\r\nwas all a joke. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know any one who\xe2\x80\x99d take the trouble to play\r\na joke on me.... Love and loyalty for nothing. It sounds tempting\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether I have lost anything really?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick considered for a long time but could not remember when or how he\r\nhad put himself in the way of winning these trifles at a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\nStill, the letter as touching on matters that he preferred not to think\r\nabout stung him into a fit of frenzy that lasted for a day and night.\r\nWhen his heart was so full of despair that it would hold no more, body\r\nand soul together seemed to be dropping without check through the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThen came fear of darkness and desperate attempts to reach the light\r\nagain. But there was no light to be reached. When that agony had left\r\nhim sweating and breathless, the downward flight would recommence till\r\nthe gathering torture of it spurred him into another fight as hopeless\r\nas the first. Followed some few minutes of sleep in which he dreamed\r\nthat he saw. Then the procession of events would repeat itself till he\r\nwas utterly worn out and the brain took up its everlasting\r\nconsideration of Maisie and might-have-beens.\r\n\r\nAt the end of everything Mr. Beeton came to his room and volunteered to\r\ntake him out. \xe2\x80\x9cNot marketing this time, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll go into the Parks if\r\nyou like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe damned if I do,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep to the streets and walk up and\r\ndown. I like to hear the people round me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was not altogether true. The blind in the first stages of their\r\ninfirmity dislike those who can move with a free stride and unlifted\r\narms\xe2\x80\x94but Dick had no earthly desire to go to the Parks. Once and only\r\nonce since Maisie had shut her door he had gone there under Alf\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharge. Alf forgot him and fished for minnows in the Serpentine with\r\nsome companions. After half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s waiting Dick, almost weeping with\r\nrage and wrath, caught a passer-by, who introduced him to a friendly\r\npoliceman, who led him to a four-wheeler opposite the Albert Hall. He\r\nnever told Mr. Beeton of Alf\xe2\x80\x99s forgetfulness, but... this was not the\r\nmanner in which he was used to walk the Parks aforetime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat streets would you like to walk down, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Beeton,\r\nsympathetically. His own ideas of a riotous holiday meant picnicking on\r\nthe grass of Green Park with his family, and half a dozen paper bags\r\nfull of food.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep to the river,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, and they kept to the river, and the\r\nrush of it was in his ears till they came to Blackfriars Bridge and\r\nstruck thence on to the Waterloo Road, Mr. Beeton explaining the\r\nbeauties of the scenery as he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd walking on the other side of the pavement,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cunless I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nmuch mistaken, is the young woman that used to come to your rooms to be\r\ndrawed. I never forgets a face and I never remembers a name, except\r\npaying tenants, o\xe2\x80\x99 course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Bessie Broke. Tell her I\xe2\x80\x99d like to speak\r\nto her again. Quick, man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Beeton crossed the road under the noses of the omnibuses and\r\narrested Bessie then on her way northward. She recognised him as the\r\nman in authority who used to glare at her when she passed up Dick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstaircase, and her first impulse was to run.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t you Mr. Heldar\xe2\x80\x99s model?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Beeton, planting himself in\r\nfront of her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou was. He\xe2\x80\x99s on the other side of the road and he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie, faintly. She remembered\xe2\x80\x94indeed had never for long\r\nforgotten\xe2\x80\x94an affair connected with a newly finished picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he has asked me to do so, and because he\xe2\x80\x99s most particular\r\nblind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. \xe2\x80\x99Orspital blind. He can\xe2\x80\x99t see. That\xe2\x80\x99s him over there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick was leaning against the parapet of the bridge as Mr. Beeton\r\npointed him out\xe2\x80\x94a stub-bearded, bowed creature wearing a dirty\r\nmagenta-coloured neckcloth outside an unbrushed coat. There was nothing\r\nto fear from such an one. Even if he chased her, Bessie thought, he\r\ncould not follow far. She crossed over, and Dick\xe2\x80\x99s face lighted up. It\r\nwas long since a woman of any kind had taken the trouble to speak to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99re well, Mr. Heldar?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie, a little puzzled. Mr.\r\nBeeton stood by with the air of an ambassador and breathed responsibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very well indeed, and, by Jove! I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see\xe2\x80\x94hear you, I mean,\r\nBess. You never thought it worth while to turn up and see us again\r\nafter you got your money. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you should. Are you going\r\nanywhere in particular just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going for a walk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the old business?\xe2\x80\x9d Dick spoke under his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, no! I paid my premium\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Bessie was very proud of that word\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor a\r\nbarmaid, sleeping in, and I\xe2\x80\x99m at the bar now quite respectable. Indeed\r\nI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Beeton had no special reason to believe in the loftiness of human\r\nnature. Therefore he dissolved himself like a mist and returned to his\r\ngas-plugs without a word of apology. Bessie watched the flight with a\r\ncertain uneasiness; but so long as Dick appeared to be ignorant of the\r\nharm that had been done to him...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard work pulling the beer-handles,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot one of them penny-in-the-slot cash-machines, so if you get wrong by\r\na penny at the end of the day\xe2\x80\x94but then I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the machinery is\r\nright. Do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen it work. Mr. Beeton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I must ask you to help me home, then. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it worth\r\nyour while. You see.\xe2\x80\x9d The sightless eyes turned towards her and Bessie\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t taking you out of your way?\xe2\x80\x9d he said hesitatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can ask\r\na policeman if it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I come on at seven and I\xe2\x80\x99m off at four. That\xe2\x80\x99s easy\r\nhours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99m on all the time. I wish I had some work to do too.\r\n\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s go home, Bess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned and cannoned into a man on the sidewalk, recoiling with an\r\noath. Bessie took his arm and said nothing\xe2\x80\x94as she had said nothing when\r\nhe had ordered her to turn her face a little more to the light. They\r\nwalked for some time in silence, the girl steering him deftly through\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Torpenhow?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone away to the desert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick pointed to the right. \xe2\x80\x9cEast\xe2\x80\x94out of the mouth of the river,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen west, then south, and then east again, all along the under-side\r\nof Europe. Then south again, God knows how far.\xe2\x80\x9d The explanation did\r\nnot enlighten Bessie in the least, but she held her tongue and looked\r\nto Dick\xe2\x80\x99s path till they came to the chambers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have tea and muffins,\xe2\x80\x9d he said joyously. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you,\r\nBessie, how glad I am to find you again. What made you go away so\r\nsuddenly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d want me any more,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, emboldened by his\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t, as a matter of fact\xe2\x80\x94but afterwards\xe2\x80\x94At any rate I\xe2\x80\x99m glad\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve come. You know the stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Bessie led him home to his own place\xe2\x80\x94there was no one to hinder\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nshut the door of the studio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a mess!\xe2\x80\x9d was her first word. \xe2\x80\x9cAll these things haven\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nlooked after for months and months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, only weeks, Bess. You can\xe2\x80\x99t expect them to care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you expect them to do. They ought to know what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve paid them for. The dust\xe2\x80\x99s just awful. It\xe2\x80\x99s all over the easel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t use it much now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll over the pictures and the floor, and all over your coat. I\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nto speak to them housemaids.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRing for tea, then.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick felt his way to the one chair he used by\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\nBessie saw the action and, as far as in her lay, was touched. But there\r\nremained always a keen sense of new-found superiority, and it was in\r\nher voice when she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been like this?\xe2\x80\x9d she said wrathfully, as though the\r\nblindness were some fault of the housemaids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day after you went away with the check, almost as soon as my\r\npicture was finished; I hardly saw her alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they\xe2\x80\x99ve been cheating you ever since, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. I know their\r\nnice little ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA woman may love one man and despise another, but on general feminine\r\nprinciples she will do her best to save the man she despises from being\r\ndefrauded. Her loved one can look to himself, but the other man, being\r\nobviously an idiot, needs protection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Mr. Beeton cheats much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick. Bessie was flouncing\r\nup and down the room, and he was conscious of a keen sense of enjoyment\r\nas he heard the swish of her skirts and the light step between.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTea _and_ muffins,\xe2\x80\x9d she said shortly, when the ring at the bell was\r\nanswered; \xe2\x80\x9ctwo teaspoonfuls and one over for the pot. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want the\r\nold teapot that was here when I used to come. It don\xe2\x80\x99t draw. Get\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe housemaid went away scandalised, and Dick chuckled. Then he began\r\nto cough as Bessie banged up and down the studio disturbing the dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you trying to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut things straight. This is like unfurnished lodgings. How could you\r\nlet it go so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I help it? Dust away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dusted furiously, and in the midst of all the pother entered Mrs.\r\nBeeton. Her husband on his return had explained the situation, winding\r\nup with the peculiarly felicitous proverb, \xe2\x80\x9cDo unto others as you would\r\nbe done by.\xe2\x80\x9d She had descended to put into her place the person who\r\ndemanded muffins and an uncracked teapot as though she had a right to\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuffins ready yet?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bess, still dusting. She was no longer a drab\r\nof the streets but a young lady who, thanks to Dick\xe2\x80\x99s check, had paid\r\nher premium and was entitled to pull beer-handles with the best. Being\r\nneatly dressed in black she did not hesitate to face Mrs. Beeton, and\r\nthere passed between the two women certain regards that Dick would have\r\nappreciated. The situation adjusted itself by eye. Bessie had won, and\r\nMrs. Beeton returned to cook muffins and make scathing remarks about\r\nmodels, hussies, trollops, and the like, to her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be got of interfering with him, Liza,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlf, you go along into the street to play. When he isn\xe2\x80\x99t crossed he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nas kindly as kind, but when he\xe2\x80\x99s crossed he\xe2\x80\x99s the devil and all. We\r\ntook too many little things out of his rooms since he was blind to be\r\nthat particular about what he does. They ain\xe2\x80\x99t no objects to a blind\r\nman, of course, but if it was to come into court we\xe2\x80\x99d get the sack.\r\nYes, I did introduce him to that girl because I\xe2\x80\x99m a feelin\xe2\x80\x99 man\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch too feelin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Beeton slapped the muffins into the dish, and\r\nthought of comely housemaids long since dismissed on suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t ashamed of it, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t for us to judge him hard so long\r\nas he pays quiet and regular as he do. I know how to manage young\r\ngentlemen, you know how to cook for them, and what I says is, let each\r\nstick to his own business and then there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any trouble. Take\r\nthem muffins down, Liza, and be sure you have no words with that young\r\nwoman. His lot is cruel hard, and if he\xe2\x80\x99s crossed he do swear worse\r\nthan any one I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever served.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a little better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie, sitting down to the tea. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t wait, thank you, Mrs. Beeton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no intention of doing such, I do assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie made no answer whatever. This, she knew, was the way in which\r\nreal ladies routed their foes, and when one is a barmaid at a\r\nfirst-class public-house one may become a real lady at ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nHer eyes fell on Dick opposite her and she was both shocked and\r\ndispleased. There were droppings of food all down the front of his\r\ncoat; the mouth under the ragged ill-grown beard drooped sullenly; the\r\nforehead was lined and contracted; and on the lean temples the hair was\r\na dusty indeterminate colour that might or might not have been called\r\ngray. The utter misery and self-abandonment of the man appealed to her,\r\nand at the bottom of her heart lay the wicked feeling that he was\r\nhumbled and brought low who had once humbled her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it _is_ good to hear you moving about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, rubbing his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us all about your bar successes, Bessie, and the way you live\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that. I\xe2\x80\x99m quite respectable, as you\xe2\x80\x99d see by looking at me.\r\n_You_ don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to live too well. What made you go blind that sudden?\r\nWhy isn\xe2\x80\x99t there any one to look after you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick was too thankful for the sound of her voice to resent the tone of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was cut across the head a long time ago, and that ruined my eyes. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose anybody thinks it worth while to look after me any more.\r\n\r\nWhy should they?\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Beeton really does everything I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know any gentlemen and ladies, then, while you was\xe2\x80\x94well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to have them looking at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve growed a beard. Take it off, it don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbecome you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious, child, do you imagine that I think of what becomes of\r\nme these days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought. Get that taken off before I come here again. I suppose I\r\ncan come, can\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be only too grateful if you did. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I treated you very\r\nwell in the old days. I used to make you angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery angry, you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for it, then. Come and see me when you can and as often as\r\nyou can. God knows, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a soul in the world to take that\r\ntrouble except you and Mr. Beeton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of trouble _he\xe2\x80\x99s_ taking and _she_ too.\xe2\x80\x9d This with a toss of the\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve let you do anyhow and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t done anything for\r\nyou. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only to look and see that much. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad\r\nto come, but you must go and be shaved, and you must get some other\r\nclothes\xe2\x80\x94those ones aren\xe2\x80\x99t fit to be seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heaps somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said helplessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you have. Tell Mr. Beeton to give you a new suit and I\xe2\x80\x99ll brush\r\nit and keep it clean. You may be as blind as a barn-door, Mr. Heldar,\r\nbut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t excuse you looking like a sweep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I look like a sweep, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you. I\xe2\x80\x99m that sorry for you!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried impulsively,\r\nand took Dick\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Mechanically, he lowered his head as if to\r\nkiss\xe2\x80\x94she was the only woman who had taken pity on him, and he was not\r\ntoo proud for a little pity now. She stood up to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing o\xe2\x80\x99 that kind till you look more like a gentleman. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\neasy when you get shaved, and some clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could hear her drawing on her gloves and rose to say good-bye. She\r\npassed behind him, kissed him audaciously on the back of the neck, and\r\nran away as swiftly as on the day when she had destroyed the\r\nMelancolia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think of me kissing Mr. Heldar,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cafter all\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s done to me and all! Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for him, and if he was shaved\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so bad to look at, but... Oh them Beetons, how shameful\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve treated him! I know Beeton\xe2\x80\x99s wearing his shirt on his back\r\nto-day just as well as if I\xe2\x80\x99d aired it. To-morrow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see... I wonder\r\nif he has much of his own. It might be worth more than the bar\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do any work\xe2\x80\x94and just as respectable as if no one\r\nknew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick was not grateful to Bessie for her parting gift. He was acutely\r\nconscious of it in the nape of his neck throughout the night, but it\r\nseemed, among very many other things, to enforce the wisdom of getting\r\nshaved.\r\n\r\nHe was shaved accordingly in the morning, and felt the better for it. A\r\nfresh suit of clothes, white linen, and the knowledge that some one in\r\nthe world said that she took an interest in his personal appearance\r\nmade him carry himself almost upright; for the brain was relieved for a\r\nwhile from thinking of Maisie, who, under other circumstances, might\r\nhave given that kiss and a million others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us consider,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, after lunch. \xe2\x80\x9cThe girl can\xe2\x80\x99t care, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na toss-up whether she comes again or not, but if money can buy her to\r\nlook after me she shall be bought. Nobody else in the world would take\r\nthe trouble, and I can make it worth her while. She\xe2\x80\x99s a child of the\r\ngutter holding brevet rank as a barmaid; so she shall have everything\r\nshe wants if she\xe2\x80\x99ll only come and talk and look after me.\xe2\x80\x9d He rubbed\r\nhis newly shorn chin and began to perplex himself with the thought of\r\nher not coming. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I did look rather a sweep,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhad no reason to look otherwise. I knew things dropped on my clothes,\r\nbut it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. It would be cruel if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t come. She must.\r\nMaisie came once, and that was enough for her. She was quite right. She\r\nhad something to work for. This creature has only beer-handles to pull,\r\nunless she has deluded some young man into keeping company with her.\r\n\r\nFancy being cheated for the sake of a counter-jumper! We\xe2\x80\x99re falling\r\npretty low.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething cried aloud within him:\xe2\x80\x94This will hurt more than anything\r\nthat has gone before. It will recall and remind and suggest and\r\ntantalise, and in the end drive you mad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, I know it!\xe2\x80\x9d Dick cried, clenching his hands despairingly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut, good heavens! is a poor blind beggar never to get anything out of\r\nhis life except three meals a day and a greasy waistcoat? I wish she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon time she came, because there was no young man in\r\nher life just then, and she thought of material advantages which would\r\nallow her to be idle for the rest of her days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have known you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said approvingly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look as you\r\nused to look\xe2\x80\x94a gentleman that was proud of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think I deserve another kiss, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, flushing a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe\xe2\x80\x94but you won\xe2\x80\x99t get it yet. Sit down and let\xe2\x80\x99s see what I can do\r\nfor you. I\xe2\x80\x99m certain sure Mr. Beeton cheats you, now that you can\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nthrough the housekeeping books every month. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better come and housekeep for me then, Bessie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it in these chambers\xe2\x80\x94you know that as well as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, but we might go somewhere else, if you thought it worth your\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d try to look after you, anyhow; but I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care to have to\r\nwork for both of us.\xe2\x80\x9d This was tentative.\r\n\r\nDick laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember where I used to keep my bank-book?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cTorp\r\ntook it to be balanced just before he went away. Look and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was generally under the tobacco-jar. Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Four thousand two hundred and ten pounds nine shillings and a\r\npenny! Oh my!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can have the penny. That\xe2\x80\x99s not bad for one year\xe2\x80\x99s work. Is that\r\nand a hundred and twenty pounds a year good enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe idleness and the pretty clothes were almost within her reach now,\r\nbut she must, by being housewifely, show that she deserved them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but you\xe2\x80\x99d have to move, and if we took an inventory, I think we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nfind that Mr. Beeton has been prigging little things out of the rooms\r\nhere and there. They don\xe2\x80\x99t look as full as they used.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let him have them. The only thing I\xe2\x80\x99m particularly\r\nanxious to take away is that picture I used you for\xe2\x80\x94when you used to\r\nswear at me. We\xe2\x80\x99ll pull out of this place, Bess, and get away as far as\r\never we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where I can go to get away from myself, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll try, and\r\nyou shall have all the pretty frocks that you care for. You\xe2\x80\x99ll like\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nGive me that kiss now, Bess. Ye gods! it\xe2\x80\x99s good to put one\xe2\x80\x99s arm round\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s waist again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen came the fulfilment of the prophecy within the brain. If his arm\r\nwere thus round Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s waist and a kiss had just been given and taken\r\nbetween them,\xe2\x80\x94why then... He pressed the girl more closely to himself\r\nbecause the pain whipped him. She was wondering how to explain a little\r\naccident to the Melancolia. At any rate, if this man really desired the\r\nsolace of her company\xe2\x80\x94and certainly he would relapse into his original\r\nslough if she withdrew it\xe2\x80\x94he would not be more than just a little\r\nvexed.\r\n\r\nIt would be delightful at least to see what would happen, and by her\r\nteachings it was good for a man to stand in certain awe of his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nShe laughed nervously, and slipped out of his reach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worrit about that picture if I was you,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, in the\r\nhope of turning his attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s at the back of all my canvases somewhere. Find it, Bess; you know\r\nit as well as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what? You\xe2\x80\x99ve wit enough to manage the sale of it to a dealer.\r\n\r\nWomen haggle much better than men. It might be a matter of eight or\r\nnine hundred pounds to\xe2\x80\x94to us. I simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to think about it\r\nfor a long time. It was mixed up with my life so.\xe2\x80\x94But we\xe2\x80\x99ll cover up\r\nour tracks and get rid of everything, eh? Make a fresh start from the\r\nbeginning, Bess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she began to repent very much indeed, because she knew the value\r\nof money. Still, it was probable that the blind man was overestimating\r\nthe value of his work. Gentlemen, she knew, were absurdly particular\r\nabout their things. She giggled as a nervous housemaid giggles when she\r\ntries to explain the breakage of a pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry, but you remember I was\xe2\x80\x94I was angry with you before Mr.\r\nTorpenhow went away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were very angry, child; and on my word I think you had some right\r\nto be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x94but aren\xe2\x80\x99t you sure Mr. Torpenhow didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what? Good gracious, what are you making such a fuss about\r\nwhen you might just as well be giving me another kiss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was beginning to learn, not for the first time in his experience,\r\nthat kissing is a cumulative poison. The more you get of it, the more\r\nyou want.\r\n\r\nBessie gave the kiss promptly, whispering, as she did so, \xe2\x80\x9cI was so\r\nangry I rubbed out that picture with the turpentine. You aren\xe2\x80\x99t angry,\r\nare you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Say that again.\xe2\x80\x9d The man\xe2\x80\x99s hand had closed on her wrist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rubbed it out with turps and the knife,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Bessie. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d only have to do it over again. You did do it over again, didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou? Oh, let go of my wrist; you\xe2\x80\x99re hurting me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there anything left of the thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x99nothing that looks like anything. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you\xe2\x80\x99d take\r\non about it; I only meant to do it in fun. You aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to hit me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHit you! No! Let\xe2\x80\x99s think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not relax his hold upon her wrist but stood staring at the\r\ncarpet. Then he shook his head as a young steer shakes it when the lash\r\nof the stock-whip cross his nose warns him back to the path on to the\r\nshambles that he would escape. For weeks he had forced himself not to\r\nthink of the Melancolia, because she was a part of his dead life. With\r\nBessie\xe2\x80\x99s return and certain new prospects that had developed\r\nthemselves, the Melancolia\xe2\x80\x94lovelier in his imagination than she had\r\never been on canvas\xe2\x80\x94reappeared. By her aid he might have procured more\r\nmoney wherewith to amuse Bess and to forget Maisie, as well as another\r\ntaste of an almost forgotten success. Now, thanks to a vicious little\r\nhousemaid\xe2\x80\x99s folly, there was nothing to look for\xe2\x80\x94not even the hope that\r\nhe might some day take an abiding interest in the housemaid. Worst of\r\nall, he had been made to appear ridiculous in Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. A woman\r\nwill forgive the man who has ruined her life\xe2\x80\x99s work so long as he gives\r\nher love; a man may forgive those who ruin the love of his life, but he\r\nwill never forgive the destruction of his work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTck\xe2\x80\x94tck\xe2\x80\x94tck,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick between his teeth, and then laughed softly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an omen, Bessie, and\xe2\x80\x94a good many things considered, it serves me\r\nright for doing what I have done. By Jove! that accounts for Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrunning away. She must have thought me perfectly mad\xe2\x80\x94small blame to\r\nher! The whole picture ruined, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it so? What made you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was that angry. I\xe2\x80\x99m not angry now\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m awful sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder.\xe2\x80\x94It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, anyhow. I\xe2\x80\x99m to blame for making the\r\nmistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mistake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, dear. Great heavens! to think that\r\na little piece of dirt like you could throw me out of stride!\xe2\x80\x9d Dick was\r\ntalking to himself as Bessie tried to shake off his grip on her wrist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a piece of dirt, and you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call me so! I did it \xe2\x80\x9ccause\r\nI hated you, and I\xe2\x80\x99m only sorry now \xe2\x80\x9ccause you\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99cause you\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly\xe2\x80\x94because I\xe2\x80\x99m blind. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like tact in little\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie began to sob. She did not like being shackled against her will;\r\nshe was afraid of the blind face and the look upon it, and was sorry\r\ntoo that her great revenge had only made Dick laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and took her into his arms. \xe2\x80\x9cYou only did what\r\nyou thought right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a little piece of dirt, and if you say that I\xe2\x80\x99ll never come\r\nto you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not angry\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\r\n\r\nBe quiet for a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie remained in his arms shrinking. Dick\xe2\x80\x99s first thought was\r\nconnected with Maisie, and it hurt him as white-hot iron hurts an open\r\nsore.\r\n\r\nNot for nothing is a man permitted to ally himself to the wrong woman.\r\n\r\nThe first pang\xe2\x80\x94the first sense of things lost is but the prelude to the\r\nplay, for the very just Providence who delights in causing pain has\r\ndecreed that the agony shall return, and that in the midst of keenest\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThey know this pain equally who have forsaken or been forsaken by the\r\nlove of their life, and in their new wives\xe2\x80\x99 arms are compelled to\r\nrealise it.\r\n\r\nIt is better to remain alone and suffer only the misery of being alone,\r\nso long as it is possible to find distraction in daily work. When that\r\nresource goes the man is to be pitied and left alone.\r\n\r\nThese things and some others Dick considered while he was holding\r\nBessie to his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough you mayn\xe2\x80\x99t know it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, raising his head, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Lord is a\r\njust and a terrible God, Bess; with a very strong sense of humour. It\r\nserves me right\xe2\x80\x94how it serves me right! Torp could understand it if he\r\nwere here; he must have suffered something at your hands, child, but\r\nonly for a minute or so. I saved him. Set that to my credit, some one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bess, her face darkening. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll in good time. Did you ever attend Sunday school?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever. Let me go, I tell you; you\xe2\x80\x99re making fun of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. I\xe2\x80\x99m making fun of myself.... Thus. \xe2\x80\x9cHe saved others,\r\nhimself he cannot save.\xe2\x80\x9d It isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a school-board text.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nreleased her wrist, but since he was between her and the door, she\r\ncould not escape. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an enormous amount of mischief one little woman\r\ncan do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry; I\xe2\x80\x99m awful sorry about the picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not. I\xe2\x80\x99m grateful to you for spoiling it.... What were we talking\r\nabout before you mentioned the thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout getting away\xe2\x80\x94and money. Me and you going away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. We will get away\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have fifty whole pounds for spoiling a picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not, dear. Think of fifty pounds for pretty things all to\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything without me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was true a little while ago. I\xe2\x80\x99m better now, thank you. Get me my\r\nhat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99pose I don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeeton will, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll lose fifty pounds. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. Get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie cursed under her breath. She had pitied the man sincerely, had\r\nkissed him with almost equal sincerity, for he was not unhandsome; it\r\npleased her to be in a way and for a time his protector, and above all\r\nthere were four thousand pounds to be handled by some one. Now through\r\na slip of the tongue and a little feminine desire to give a little, not\r\ntoo much, pain she had lost the money, the blessed idleness and the\r\npretty things, the companionship, and the chance of looking outwardly\r\nas respectable as a real lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow fill me a pipe. Tobacco doesn\xe2\x80\x99t taste, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll think things out. What\xe2\x80\x99s the day of the week, Bess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTuesday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s mail-day. What a fool\xe2\x80\x94what a blind fool I have been!\r\nTwenty-two pounds covers my passage home again. Allow ten for\r\nadditional expenses. We must put up at Madam Binat\xe2\x80\x99s for old time\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake. Thirty-two pounds altogether. Add a hundred for the cost of the\r\nlast trip\xe2\x80\x94Gad, won\xe2\x80\x99t Torp stare to see me!\xe2\x80\x94a hundred and thirty-two\r\nleaves seventy-eight for _baksheesh_\xe2\x80\x94I shall need it\xe2\x80\x94and to play with.\r\nWhat are you crying for, Bess? It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your fault, child; it was mine\r\naltogether. Oh, you funny little opossum, mop your eyes and take me\r\nout! I want the pass-book and the check-book. Stop a minute. Four\r\nthousand pounds at four per cent\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s safe interest\xe2\x80\x94means a hundred\r\nand sixty pounds a year; one hundred and twenty pounds a year\xe2\x80\x94also\r\nsafe\xe2\x80\x94is two eighty, and two hundred and eighty pounds added to three\r\nhundred a year means gilded luxury for a single woman. Bess, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nto the bank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRicher by two hundred and ten pounds stored in his money-belt, Dick\r\ncaused Bessie, now thoroughly bewildered, to hurry from the bank to the\r\nP. and O. offices, where he explained things tersely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPort Said, single first; cabin as close to the baggage-hatch as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWhat ship\xe2\x80\x99s going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _Colgong_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a wet little hooker. Is it Tilbury and a tender, or Galleons and\r\nthe docks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGalleons. Twelve-forty, Thursday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks. Change, please. I can\xe2\x80\x99t see very well\xe2\x80\x94will you count it into\r\nmy hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they all took their passages like that instead of talking about\r\ntheir trunks, life would be worth something,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk to his\r\nneighbour, who was trying to explain to a harassed mother of many that\r\ncondensed milk is just as good for babes at sea as daily dairy. Being\r\nnineteen and unmarried, he spoke with conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are now,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Dick, as they returned to the studio, patting the\r\nplace where his money-belt covered ticket and money, \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond the reach\r\nof man, or devil, or woman\xe2\x80\x94which is much more important. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had three\r\nlittle affairs to carry through before Thursday, but I needn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you\r\nto help, Bess. Come here on Thursday morning at nine. We\xe2\x80\x99ll breakfast,\r\nand you shall take me down to Galleons Station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing away, of course. What should I stay for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t look after yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do anything. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise it before, but I can. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done a\r\ngreat deal already. Resolution shall be treated to one kiss if Bessie\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t object.\xe2\x80\x9d Strangely enough, Bessie objected and Dick laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose you\xe2\x80\x99re right. Well, come at nine the day after to-morrow and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll get your money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t bilk, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I do or not unless you come.\r\n\r\nOh, but it\xe2\x80\x99s long and long to wait! Good-bye, Bessie,\xe2\x80\x94send Beeton here\r\nas you go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are all the fittings of my rooms worth?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, imperiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t for me to say, sir. Some things is very pretty and some is\r\nwore out dreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m insured for two hundred and seventy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInsurance policies is no criterion, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, damn your longwindedness! You\xe2\x80\x99ve made your pickings out of me and\r\nthe other tenants. Why, you talked of retiring and buying a\r\npublic-house the other day. Give a straight answer to a straight\r\nquestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Beeton, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDouble it; or I\xe2\x80\x99ll break up half my sticks and burn the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt his way to a bookstand that supported a pile of sketch-books,\r\nand wrenched out one of the mahogany pillars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s sinful, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the housekeeper, alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my own. One hundred or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred it is. It\xe2\x80\x99ll cost me three and six to get that there\r\npilaster mended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so. What an out and out swindler you must have been to\r\nspring that price at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I\xe2\x80\x99ve done nothing to dissatisfy any of the tenants, least of\r\nall you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that. Get me the money to-morrow, and see that all my\r\nclothes are packed in the little brown bullock-trunk. I\xe2\x80\x99m going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the quarter\xe2\x80\x99s notice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay forfeit. Look after the packing and leave me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Beeton discussed this new departure with his wife, who decided that\r\nBessie was at the bottom of it all. Her husband took a more charitable\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very sudden\xe2\x80\x94but then he was always sudden in his ways. Listen to\r\nhim now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of chanting from Dick\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll never come back any more, boys,\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll never come back no more;\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the deuce on any excuse,\r\nAnd never come back no more!\r\nOh say we\xe2\x80\x99re afloat or ashore, boys,\r\nOh say we\xe2\x80\x99re afloat or ashore;\r\nBut we\xe2\x80\x99ll never come back any more, boys,\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll never come back no more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Beeton! Mr. Beeton! Where the deuce is my pistol?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to shoot himself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99avin\xe2\x80\x99 gone mad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Beeton.\r\n\r\nMr. Beeton addressed Dick soothingly, but it was some time before the\r\nlatter, threshing up and down his bedroom, could realise the intention\r\nof the promises to \xe2\x80\x9cfind everything to-morrow, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you copper-nosed old fool\xe2\x80\x94you impotent Academician!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted at\r\nlast. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose I want to shoot myself? Take the pistol in your\r\nsilly shaking hand then. If _you_ touch it, it will go off, because\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s loaded. It\xe2\x80\x99s among my campaign-kit somewhere\xe2\x80\x94in the parcel at the\r\nbottom of the trunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLong ago Dick had carefully possessed himself of a forty-pound weight\r\nfield-equipment constructed by the knowledge of his own experience. It\r\nwas this put-away treasure that he was trying to find and rehandle. Mr.\r\nBeeton whipped the revolver out of its place on the top of the package,\r\nand Dick drove his hand among the _khaki_ coat and breeches, the blue\r\ncloth leg-bands, and the heavy flannel shirts doubled over a pair of\r\nswan-neck spurs. Under these and the water-bottle lay a sketch-book and\r\na pigskin case of stationery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese we don\xe2\x80\x99t want; you can have them, Mr. Beeton. Everything else\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll keep. Pack \xe2\x80\x99em on the top right-hand side of my trunk. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone that come into the studio with your wife. I want you both. Wait a\r\nminute; get me a pen and a sheet of notepaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy thing to write when you cannot see, and Dick had\r\nparticular reasons for wishing that his work should be clear. So he\r\nbegan, following his right hand with his left: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cThe badness of this\r\nwriting is because I am blind and cannot see my pen.\xe2\x80\x9d H\xe2\x80\x99mph!\xe2\x80\x94even a\r\nlawyer can\xe2\x80\x99t mistake that. It must be signed, I suppose, but it needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe witnessed. Now an inch lower\xe2\x80\x94why did I never learn to use a\r\ntype-writer?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the last will and testament of me, Richard\r\nHeldar. I am in sound bodily and mental health, and there is no\r\nprevious will to revoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Damn the pen! Whereabouts\r\non the paper was I?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI leave everything that I possess in the world,\r\nincluding four thousand pounds, and two thousand seven hundred and\r\ntwenty eight pounds held for me\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get this straight.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ntore off half the sheet and began again with the caution about the\r\nhandwriting. Then: \xe2\x80\x9cI leave all the money I possess in the world\r\nto\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94here followed Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s name, and the names of the two banks that\r\nheld the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be quite regular, but no one has a shadow of a right to\r\ndispute it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve given Maisie\xe2\x80\x99s address. Come in, Mr. Beeton. This\r\nis my signature; I want you and your wife to witness it. Thanks.\r\nTo-morrow you must take me to the landlord and I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay forfeit for\r\nleaving without notice, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll lodge this paper with him in case\r\nanything happens while I\xe2\x80\x99m away. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to light up the studio\r\nstove. Stay with me, and give me my papers as I want \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one knows until he has tried how fine a blaze a year\xe2\x80\x99s accumulation\r\nof bills, letters, and dockets can make. Dick stuffed into the stove\r\nevery document in the studio\xe2\x80\x94saving only three unopened letters;\r\ndestroyed sketch-books, rough note-books, new and half-finished\r\ncanvases alike.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of rubbish a tenant gets about him if he stays long enough\r\nin one place, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Beeton, at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does. Is there anything more left?\xe2\x80\x9d Dick felt round the walls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a thing, and the stove\xe2\x80\x99s nigh red-hot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost about a thousand pounds\xe2\x80\x99 worth of sketches.\r\n\r\nHo! ho! Quite a thousand pounds\xe2\x80\x99 worth, if I can remember what I used\r\nto be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d politely. Mr. Beeton was quite sure that Dick had gone mad,\r\notherwise he would have never parted with his excellent furniture for a\r\nsong. The canvas things took up storage room and were much better out\r\nof the way.\r\n\r\nThere remained only to leave the little will in safe hands: that could\r\nnot be accomplished to to-morrow. Dick groped about the floor picking\r\nup the last pieces of paper, assured himself again and again that there\r\nremained no written word or sign of his past life in drawer or desk,\r\nand sat down before the stove till the fire died out and the\r\ncontracting iron cracked in the silence of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a heart of furious fancies,\r\n    Whereof I am commander;\r\nWith a burning spear and a horse of air,\r\n    To the wilderness I wander.\r\nWith a knight of ghosts and shadows\r\n    I summoned am to tourney\xe2\x80\x94\r\nTen leagues beyond the wide world\xe2\x80\x99s end,\r\n    Methinks it is no journey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Tom a\xe2\x80\x99 Bedlam\xe2\x80\x99s Song_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Bess; I promised you fifty. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a hundred\xe2\x80\x94all that I got\r\nfor my furniture from Beeton. That will keep you in pretty frocks for\r\nsome time. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been a good little girl, all things considered, but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve given me and Torpenhow a fair amount of trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive Mr. Torpenhow my love if you see him, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I will, dear. Now take me up the gang-plank and into the\r\ncabin. Once aboard the lugger and the maid is\xe2\x80\x94and I am free, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99ll look after you on this ship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe head-steward, if there\xe2\x80\x99s any use in money. The doctor when we come\r\nto Port Said, if I know anything of P. and O. doctors. After that, the\r\nLord will provide, as He used to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBess found Dick his cabin in the wild turmoil of a ship full of\r\nleavetakers and weeping relatives. Then he kissed her, and laid himself\r\ndown in his bunk until the decks should be clear. He who had taken so\r\nlong to move about his own darkened rooms well understood the geography\r\nof a ship, and the necessity of seeing to his own comforts was as wine\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nBefore the screw began to thrash the ship along the Docks he had been\r\nintroduced to the head-steward, had royally tipped him, secured a good\r\nplace at table, opened out his baggage, and settled himself down with\r\njoy in the cabin. It was scarcely necessary to feel his way as he moved\r\nabout, for he knew everything so well. Then God was very kind: a deep\r\nsleep of weariness came upon him just as he would have thought of\r\nMaisie, and he slept till the steamer had cleared the mouth of the\r\nThames and was lifting to the pulse of the Channel.\r\n\r\nThe rattle of the engines, the reek of oil and paint, and a very\r\nfamiliar sound in the next cabin roused him to his new inheritance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to be alive again!\xe2\x80\x9d He yawned, stretched himself\r\nvigorously, and went on deck to be told that they were almost abreast\r\nof the lights of Brighton. This is no more open water than Trafalgar\r\nSquare is a common; the free levels begin at Ushant; but none the less\r\nDick could feel the healing of the sea at work upon him already. A\r\nboisterous little cross-swell swung the steamer disrespectfully by the\r\nnose; and one wave breaking far aft spattered the quarterdeck and the\r\npile of new deck-chairs. He heard the foam fall with the clash of\r\nbroken glass, was stung in the face by a cupful, and sniffing\r\nluxuriously, felt his way to the smoking-room by the wheel. There a\r\nstrong breeze found him, blew his cap off and left him bareheaded in\r\nthe doorway, and the smoking-room steward, understanding that he was a\r\nvoyager of experience, said that the weather would be stiff in the\r\nchops off the Channel and more than half a gale in the Bay. These\r\nthings fell as they were foretold, and Dick enjoyed himself to the\r\nutmost. It is allowable and even necessary at sea to lay firm hold upon\r\ntables, stanchions, and ropes in moving from place to place. On land\r\nthe man who feels with his hands is patently blind. At sea even a blind\r\nman who is not sea-sick can jest with the doctor over the weakness of\r\nhis fellows. Dick told the doctor many tales\xe2\x80\x94and these are coin of more\r\nvalue than silver if properly handled\xe2\x80\x94smoked with him till unholy hours\r\nof the night, and so won his short-lived regard that he promised Dick a\r\nfew hours of his time when they came to Port Said.\r\n\r\nAnd the sea roared or was still as the winds blew, and the engines sang\r\ntheir song day and night, and the sun grew stronger day by day, and Tom\r\nthe Lascar barber shaved Dick of a morning under the opened\r\nhatch-grating where the cool winds blew, and the awnings were spread\r\nand the passengers made merry, and at last they came to Port Said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, to the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cto Madame Binat\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94if you know\r\nwhere that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cI do. There\xe2\x80\x99s not much to choose between \xe2\x80\x99em;\r\nbut I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re aware that that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the worst houses in the\r\nplace. They\xe2\x80\x99ll rob you to begin with, and knife you later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot they. Take me there, and I can look after myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he was brought to Madame Binat\xe2\x80\x99s and filled his nostrils with the\r\nwell-remembered smell of the East, that runs without a change from the\r\nCanal head to Hong-Kong, and his mouth with the villainous Lingua\r\nFranca of the Levant. The heat smote him between the shoulder-blades\r\nwith the buffet of an old friend, his feet slipped on the sand, and his\r\ncoat-sleeve was warm as new-baked bread when he lifted it to his nose.\r\n\r\nMadame Binat smiled with the smile that knows no astonishment when Dick\r\nentered the drinking-shop which was one source of her gains. But for a\r\nlittle accident of complete darkness he could hardly realise that he\r\nhad ever quitted the old life that hummed in his ears. Somebody opened\r\na bottle of peculiarly strong Schiedam. The smell reminded Dick of\r\nMonsieur Binat, who, by the way, had spoken of art and degradation.\r\n\r\nBinat was dead; Madame said as much when the doctor departed,\r\nscandalised, so far as a ship\xe2\x80\x99s doctor can be, at the warmth of Dick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreception. Dick was delighted at it. \xe2\x80\x9cThey remember me here after a\r\nyear. They have forgotten me across the water by this time. Madame, I\r\nwant a long talk with you when you\xe2\x80\x99re at liberty. It is good to be back\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the evening she set an iron-topped caf\xc3\xa9-table out on the sands, and\r\nDick and she sat by it, while the house behind them filled with riot,\r\nmerriment, oaths, and threats. The stars came out and the lights of the\r\nshipping in the harbour twinkled by the head of the Canal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The war is good for trade, my friend; but what dost thou do here?\r\nWe have not forgotten thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was over there in England and I went blind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there was the glory first. We heard of it here, even here\xe2\x80\x94I and\r\nBinat; and thou hast used the head of Yellow \xe2\x80\x9cTina\xe2\x80\x94she is still\r\nalive\xe2\x80\x94so often and so well that \xe2\x80\x9cTina laughed when the papers arrived\r\nby the mail-boats. It was always something that we here could recognise\r\nin the paintings. And then there was always the glory and the money for\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not poor\xe2\x80\x94I shall pay you well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to me. Thou hast paid for everything.\xe2\x80\x9d Under her breath, \xe2\x80\x9cMon\r\nDieu, to be blind and so young! What horror!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick could not see her face with the pity on it, or his own with the\r\ndiscoloured hair at the temples. He did not feel the need of pity; he\r\nwas too anxious to get to the front once more, and explained his\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where? The Canal is full of the English ships. Sometimes they fire\r\nas they used to do when the war was here\xe2\x80\x94ten years ago. Beyond Cairo\r\nthere is fighting, but how canst thou go there without a\r\ncorrespondent\xe2\x80\x99s passport? And in the desert there is always fighting,\r\nbut that is impossible also,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go to Suakin.\xe2\x80\x9d He knew, thanks to Alf\xe2\x80\x99s readings, that\r\nTorpenhow was at work with the column that was protecting the\r\nconstruction of the Suakin-Berber line. P. and O. steamers do not touch\r\nat that port, and, besides, Madame Binat knew everybody whose help or\r\nadvice was worth anything. They were not respectable folk, but they\r\ncould cause things to be accomplished, which is much more important\r\nwhen there is work toward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut at Suakin they are always fighting. That desert breeds men\r\nalways\xe2\x80\x94and always more men. And they are so bold! Why to Suakin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend is there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy friend! Chtt! Thy friend is death, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Binat dropped a fat arm on the table-top, filled Dick\xe2\x80\x99s glass\r\nanew, and looked at him closely under the stars. There was no need that\r\nhe should bow his head in assent and say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo. He is a man, but\xe2\x80\x94if it\r\nshould arrive... blamest thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI blame?\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed shrilly. \xe2\x80\x9cWho am I that I should blame any\r\none\xe2\x80\x94except those who try to cheat me over their consommations. But it\r\nis very terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go to Suakin. Think for me. A great deal has changed within the\r\nyear, and the men I knew are not here. The Egyptian lighthouse steamer\r\ngoes down the Canal to Suakin\xe2\x80\x94and the post-boats\xe2\x80\x94But even then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not think any longer. _I_ know, and it is for me to think. Thou\r\nshalt go\xe2\x80\x94thou shalt go and see thy friend. Be wise. Sit here until the\r\nhouse is a little quiet\xe2\x80\x94I must attend to my guests\xe2\x80\x94and afterwards go to\r\nbed. Thou shalt go, in truth, thou shalt go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as may be.\xe2\x80\x9d She was talking as though he were a child.\r\n\r\nHe sat at the table listening to the voices in the harbour and the\r\nstreets, and wondering how soon the end would come, till Madame Binat\r\ncarried him off to bed and ordered him to sleep. The house shouted and\r\nsang and danced and revelled, Madame Binat moving through it with one\r\neye on the liquor payments and the girls and the other on Dick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterests. To this latter end she smiled upon scowling and furtive\r\nTurkish officers of fellaheen regiments, was gracious to Cypriote\r\ncommissariat underlings, and more than kind to camel agents of no\r\nnationality whatever.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning, being then appropriately dressed in a flaming red\r\nsilk ball-dress, with a front of tarnished gold embroidery and a\r\nnecklace of plate-glass diamonds, she made chocolate and carried it in\r\nto Dick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only I, and I am of discreet age, eh? Drink and eat the roll\r\ntoo. Thus in France mothers bring their sons, when those behave wisely,\r\nthe morning chocolate.\xe2\x80\x9d She sat down on the side of the bed\r\nwhispering:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all arranged. Thou wilt go by the lighthouse boat.\r\nThat is a bribe of ten pounds English. The captain is never paid by the\r\nGovernment. The boat comes to Suakin in four days. There will go with\r\nthee George, a Greek muleteer. Another bribe of ten pounds. I will pay;\r\nthey must not know of thy money. George will go with thee as far as he\r\ngoes with his mules. Then he comes back to me, for his well-beloved is\r\nhere, and if I do not receive a telegram from Suakin saying that thou\r\nart well, the girl answers for George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d He reached out sleepily for the cup. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are much too\r\nkind, Madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there were anything that I might do I would say, stay here and be\r\nwise; but I do not think that would be best for thee.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at\r\nher liquor-stained dress with a sad smile. \xe2\x80\x9cNay, thou shalt go, in\r\ntruth, thou shalt go. It is best so. My boy, it is best so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stooped and kissed Dick between the eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is for\r\ngood-morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, going away. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen thou art dressed we will\r\nspeak to George and make everything ready. But first we must open the\r\nlittle trunk. Give me the keys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe amount of kissing lately has been simply scandalous. I shall\r\nexpect Torp to kiss me next. He is more likely to swear at me for\r\ngetting in his way, though. Well, it won\xe2\x80\x99t last long.\xe2\x80\x94Ohe, Madame, help\r\nme to my toilette of the guillotine! There will be no chance of\r\ndressing properly out yonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was rummaging among his new campaign-kit, and rowelling his hands\r\nwith the spurs. There are two ways of wearing well-oiled ankle-jacks,\r\nspotless blue bands, _khaki_ coat and breeches, and a perfectly\r\npipeclayed helmet. The right way is the way of the untired man, master\r\nof himself, setting out upon an expedition, well pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything must be very correct,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will become\r\ndirty afterwards, but now it is good to feel well dressed. Is\r\neverything as it should be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe patted the revolver neatly hidden under the fulness of the blouse on\r\nthe right hip and fingered his collar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do no more,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame said, between laughing and crying. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at\r\nthyself\xe2\x80\x94but I forgot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very content.\xe2\x80\x9d He stroked the creaseless spirals of his leggings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let us go and see the captain and George and the lighthouse boat.\r\n\r\nBe quick, Madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou canst not be seen by the harbour walking with me in the\r\ndaylight. Figure to yourself if some English ladies\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no English ladies; and if there are, I have forgotten them.\r\n\r\nTake me there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of this burning impatience it was nearly evening ere the\r\nlighthouse boat began to move. Madame had said a great deal both to\r\nGeorge and the captain touching the arrangements that were to be made\r\nfor Dick\xe2\x80\x99s benefit. Very few men who had the honour of her acquaintance\r\ncared to disregard Madame\xe2\x80\x99s advice. That sort of contempt might end in\r\nbeing knifed by a stranger in a gambling hell upon surprisingly short\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\nFor six days\xe2\x80\x94two of them were wasted in the crowded Canal\xe2\x80\x94the little\r\nsteamer worked her way to Suakin, where she was to pick up the\r\nsuperintendent of the lighthouse; and Dick made it his business to\r\npropitiate George, who was distracted with fears for the safety of his\r\nlight-of-love and half inclined to make Dick responsible for his own\r\ndiscomfort. When they arrived George took him under his wing, and\r\ntogether they entered the red-hot seaport, encumbered with the material\r\nand wastage of the Suakin-Berger line, from locomotives in disconsolate\r\nfragments to mounds of chairs and pot-sleepers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you keep with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cnobody will ask for passports or\r\nwhat you do. They are all very busy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but I should like to hear some of the Englishmen talk. They might\r\nremember me. I was known here a long time ago\xe2\x80\x94when I was some one\r\nindeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA long time ago is a very long time ago here. The graveyards are full.\r\n\r\nNow listen. This new railway runs out so far as Tanai-el-Hassan\xe2\x80\x94that is\r\nseven miles. Then there is a camp. They say that beyond Tanai-el-Hassan\r\nthe English troops go forward, and everything that they require will be\r\nbrought to them by this line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Base camp. I see. That\xe2\x80\x99s a better business than fighting Fuzzies\r\nin the open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor this reason even the mules go up in the iron-train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIron what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all covered with iron, because it is still being shot at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn armoured train. Better and better! Go on, faithful George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I go up with my mules to-night. Only those who particularly\r\nrequire to go to the camp go out with the train. They begin to shoot\r\nnot far from the city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dears\xe2\x80\x94they always used to!\xe2\x80\x9d Dick snuffed the smell of parched\r\ndust, heated iron, and flaking paint with delight. Certainly the old\r\nlife was welcoming him back most generously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I have got my mules together I go up to-night, but you must first\r\nsend a telegram of Port Said, declaring that I have done you no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame has you well in hand. Would you stick a knife into me if you\r\nhad the chance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no chance,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Greek. \xe2\x80\x9c_She_ is there with that woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing to be divided between love of woman and the\r\nchance of loot. I sympathise with you, George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went to the telegraph-office unquestioned, for all the world was\r\ndesperately busy and had scarcely time to turn its head, and Suakin was\r\nthe last place under sky that would be chosen for holiday-ground. On\r\ntheir return the voice of an English subaltern asked Dick what he was\r\ndoing. The blue goggles were over his eyes and he walked with his hand\r\non George\xe2\x80\x99s elbow as he replied\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEgyptian Government\xe2\x80\x94mules. My orders\r\nare to give them over to the A. C. G. at Tanai-el-Hassan. Any occasion\r\nto show my papers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly not. I beg your pardon. I\xe2\x80\x99d no right to ask, but not\r\nseeing your face before I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go out in the train to-night, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, boldly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nwill be no difficulty in loading up the mules, will there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can see the horse-platforms from here. You must have them loaded\r\nup early.\xe2\x80\x9d The young man went away wondering what sort of broken-down\r\nwaif this might be who talked like a gentleman and consorted with Greek\r\nmuleteers. Dick felt unhappy. To outface an English officer is no small\r\nthing, but the bluff loses relish when one plays it from the utter\r\ndark, and stumbles up and down rough ways, thinking and eternally\r\nthinking of what might have been if things had fallen out otherwise,\r\nand all had been as it was not.\r\n\r\nGeorge shared his meal with Dick and went off to the mule-lines. His\r\ncharge sat alone in a shed with his face in his hands. Before his\r\ntight-shut eyes danced the face of Maisie, laughing, with parted lips.\r\nThere was a great bustle and clamour about him. He grew afraid and\r\nalmost called for George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, have you got your mules ready?\xe2\x80\x9d It was the voice of the\r\nsubaltern over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy man\xe2\x80\x99s looking after them. The\xe2\x80\x94the fact is I\xe2\x80\x99ve a touch of\r\nophthalmia and can\xe2\x80\x99t see very well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! that\xe2\x80\x99s bad. You ought to lie up in hospital for a while. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad a turn of it myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s as bad as being blind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I find it. When does this armoured train go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. It takes an hour to cover the seven miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the Fuzzies on the rampage\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout three nights a week. Fact is I\xe2\x80\x99m in acting command of the\r\nnight-train. It generally runs back empty to Tanai for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBig camp at Tanai, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty big. It has to feed our desert-column somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that far off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween thirty and forty miles\xe2\x80\x94in an infernal thirsty country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the country quiet between Tanai and our men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore or less. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care to cross it alone, or with a\r\nsubaltern\xe2\x80\x99s command for the matter of that, but the scouts get through\r\nit in some extraordinary fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey always did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been here before, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was through most of the trouble when it first broke out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the service and cashiered,\xe2\x80\x9d was the subaltern\xe2\x80\x99s first thought, so\r\nhe refrained from putting any questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s your man coming up with the mules. It seems rather queer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I should be mule-leading?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say so, but it is. Forgive me\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s beastly\r\nimpertinence I know, but you speak like a man who has been at a public\r\nschool. There\xe2\x80\x99s no mistaking the tone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a public school man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so. I say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt your feelings, but you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nlittle down on your luck, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? I saw you sitting with your head\r\nin your hands, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I spoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks. I am about as thoroughly and completely broke as a man need\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose\xe2\x80\x94I mean I\xe2\x80\x99m a public school man myself. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I perhaps\xe2\x80\x94take\r\nit as a loan y\xe2\x80\x99know and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re much too good, but on my honour I\xe2\x80\x99ve as much money as I want.\r\n\r\n... I tell you what you could do for me, though, and put me under an\r\neverlasting obligation. Let me come into the bogie truck of the train.\r\n\r\nThere is a fore-truck, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. How d\xe2\x80\x99you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been in an armoured train before. Only let me see\xe2\x80\x94hear some of\r\nthe fun I mean, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be grateful. I go at my own risk as a\r\nnon-combatant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man thought for a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsupposed to be an empty train, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no one to blow me up at the\r\nother end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge and a horde of yelling amateur assistants had loaded up the\r\nmules, and the narrow-gauge armoured train, plated with three-eighths\r\ninch boiler-plate till it looked like one long coffin, stood ready to\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nTwo bogie trucks running before the locomotive were completely covered\r\nin with plating, except that the leading one was pierced in front for\r\nthe muzzle of a machine-gun, and the second at either side for lateral\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe trucks together made one long iron-vaulted chamber in which a score\r\nof artillerymen were rioting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhitechapel\xe2\x80\x94last train! Ah, I see yer kissin\xe2\x80\x99 in the first class\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d somebody shouted, just as Dick was clambering into the forward\r\ntruck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLordy! \xe2\x80\x99Ere\xe2\x80\x99s a real live passenger for the Kew, Tanai, Acton, and\r\nEalin\xe2\x80\x99 train. _Echo_, sir. Speshul edition! _Star_, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cShall I get\r\nyou a foot-warmer?\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay my footing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, and relations of the most\r\namiable were established ere silence came with the arrival of the\r\nsubaltern, and the train jolted out over the rough track.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an immense improvement on shooting the unimpressionable Fuzzy\r\nin the open,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, from his place in the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but he\xe2\x80\x99s still unimpressed. There he goes!\xe2\x80\x9d said the subaltern, as\r\na bullet struck the outside of the truck. \xe2\x80\x9cWe always have at least one\r\ndemonstration against the night-train. Generally they attack the\r\nrear-truck, where my junior commands. He gets all the fun of the fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to-night though! Listen!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick. A flight of heavy-handed\r\nbullets was succeeded by yelling and shouts. The children of the desert\r\nvalued their nightly amusement, and the train was an excellent mark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it worth giving them half a hopper full?\xe2\x80\x9d the subaltern asked of\r\nthe engine, which was driven by a Lieutenant of Sappers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so! This is my section of the line. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be playing\r\nold Harry with my permanent way if we don\xe2\x80\x99t stop \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight O!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Hrrmph!_\xe2\x80\x9d said the machine gun through all its five noses as the\r\nsubaltern drew the lever home. The empty cartridges clashed on the\r\nfloor and the smoke blew back through the truck. There was\r\nindiscriminate firing at the rear of the train, and return fire from\r\nthe darkness without and unlimited howling. Dick stretched himself on\r\nthe floor, wild with delight at the sounds and the smells.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod is very good\xe2\x80\x94I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d hear this again. Give \xe2\x80\x99em hell,\r\nmen. Oh, give \xe2\x80\x99em hell!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\nThe train stopped for some obstruction on the line ahead and a party\r\nwent out to reconnoitre, but came back, cursing, for spades. The\r\nchildren of the desert had piled sand and gravel on the rails, and\r\ntwenty minutes were lost in clearing it away. Then the slow progress\r\nrecommenced, to be varied with more shots, more shoutings, the steady\r\nclack and kick of the machine guns, and a final difficulty with a\r\nhalf-lifted rail ere the train came under the protection of the roaring\r\ncamp at Tanai-el-Hassan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you see why it takes an hour and a half to fetch her through,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the subaltern, unshipping the cartridge-hopper above his pet gun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a lark, though. I only wish it had lasted twice as long. How\r\nsuperb it must have looked from outside!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, sighing\r\nregretfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt palls after the first few nights. By the way, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve settled\r\nabout your mules, come and see what we can find to eat in my tent. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nBennil of the Gunners\xe2\x80\x94in the artillery lines\xe2\x80\x94and mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t fall\r\nover my tent-ropes in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was all dark to Dick. He could only smell the camels, the\r\nhay-bales, the cooking, the smoky fires, and the tanned canvas of the\r\ntents as he stood, where he had dropped from the train, shouting for\r\nGeorge. There was a sound of light-hearted kicking on the iron skin of\r\nthe rear trucks, with squealing and grunting. George was unloading the\r\nmules.\r\n\r\nThe engine was blowing off steam nearly in Dick\xe2\x80\x99s ear; a cold wind of\r\nthe desert danced between his legs; he was hungry, and felt tired and\r\ndirty\xe2\x80\x94so dirty that he tried to brush his coat with his hands. That was\r\na hopeless job; he thrust his hands into his pockets and began to count\r\nover the many times that he had waited in strange or remote places for\r\ntrains or camels, mules or horses, to carry him to his business. In\r\nthose days he could see\xe2\x80\x94few men more clearly\xe2\x80\x94and the spectacle of an\r\narmed camp at dinner under the stars was an ever fresh pleasure to the\r\neye. There was colour, light, and motion, without which no man has much\r\npleasure in living. This night there remained for him only one more\r\njourney through the darkness that never lifts to tell a man how far he\r\nhas travelled. Then he would grip Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s hand again\xe2\x80\x94Torpenhow, who\r\nwas alive and strong, and lived in the midst of the action that had\r\nonce made the reputation of a man called Dick Heldar: not in the least\r\nto be confused with the blind, bewildered vagabond who seemed to answer\r\nto the same name. Yes, he would find Torpenhow, and come as near to the\r\nold life as might be. Afterwards he would forget everything: Bessie,\r\nwho had wrecked the Melancolia and so nearly wrecked his life; Beeton,\r\nwho lived in a strange unreal city full of tin-tacks and gas-plugs and\r\nmatters that no men needed; that irrational being who had offered him\r\nlove and loyalty for nothing, but had not signed her name; and most of\r\nall Maisie, who, from her own point of view, was undeniably right in\r\nall she did, but oh, at this distance, so tantalisingly fair.\r\n\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s hand on his arm pulled him back to the situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what now?\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes of course. What now? Take me to the camel-men. Take me to where\r\nthe scouts sit when they come in from the desert. They sit by their\r\ncamels, and the camels eat grain out of a black blanket held up at the\r\ncorners, and the men eat by their side just like camels. Take me\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camp was rough and rutty, and Dick stumbled many times over the\r\nstumps of scrub. The scouts were sitting by their beasts, as Dick knew\r\nthey would. The light of the dung-fires flickered on their bearded\r\nfaces, and the camels bubbled and mumbled beside them at rest. It was\r\nno part of Dick\xe2\x80\x99s policy to go into the desert with a convoy of\r\nsupplies. That would lead to impertinent questions, and since a blind\r\nnon-combatant is not needed at the front, he would probably be forced\r\nto return to Suakin.\r\n\r\nHe must go up alone, and go immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow for one last bluff\xe2\x80\x94the biggest of all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeace be with\r\nyou, brethren!\xe2\x80\x9d The watchful George steered him to the circle of the\r\nnearest fire. The heads of the camel-sheiks bowed gravely, and the\r\ncamels, scenting a European, looked sideways curiously like brooding\r\nhens, half ready to get to their feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beast and a driver to go to the fighting line to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Mulaid?\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice, scornfully naming the best baggage-breed that\r\nhe knew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Bisharin,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Dick, with perfect gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cA Bisharin without\r\nsaddle-galls. Therefore no charge of thine, shock-head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo or three minutes passed. Then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWe be knee-haltered for the night.\r\nThere is no going out from the camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m! Ah! English money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother depressing interval of silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five pounds English paid into the hand of the driver at my\r\njourney\xe2\x80\x99s end, and as much more into the hand of the camel-sheik here,\r\nto be paid when the driver returns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was royal payment, and the sheik, who knew that he would get his\r\ncommission on this deposit, stirred in Dick\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor scarcely one night\xe2\x80\x99s journey\xe2\x80\x94fifty pounds. Land and wells and good\r\ntrees and wives to make a man content for the rest of his days. Who\r\nspeaks?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go\xe2\x80\x94but there is no going from the camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool! I know that a camel can break his knee-halter, and the sentries\r\ndo not fire if one goes in chase. Twenty-five pounds and another\r\ntwenty-five pounds. But the beast must be a good Bisharin; I will take\r\nno baggage-camel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the bargaining began, and at the end of half an hour the first\r\ndeposit was paid over to the sheik, who talked in low tones to the\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\nDick heard the latter say: \xe2\x80\x9cA little way out only. Any baggage-beast\r\nwill serve. Am I a fool to waste my cattle for a blind man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd though I cannot see\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Dick lifted his voice a little\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyet I carry\r\nthat which has six eyes, and the driver will sit before me. If we do\r\nnot reach the English troops in the dawn he will be dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name, are the troops?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless thou knowest let another man ride. Dost thou know? Remember it\r\nwill be life or death to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the driver, sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cStand back from my beast. I am\r\ngoing to slip him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so swiftly. George, hold the camel\xe2\x80\x99s head a moment. I want to feel\r\nhis cheek.\xe2\x80\x9d The hands wandered over the hide till they found the\r\nbranded half-circle that is the mark of the Biharin, the light-built\r\nriding-camel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well. Cut this one loose. Remember no blessing of God comes on\r\nthose who try to cheat the blind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men chuckled by the fires at the camel-driver\xe2\x80\x99s discomfiture. He\r\nhad intended to substitute a slow, saddle-galled baggage-colt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand back!\xe2\x80\x9d one shouted, lashing the Biharin under the belly with a\r\nquirt. Dick obeyed as soon as he felt the nose-string tighten in his\r\nhand,\xe2\x80\x94and a cry went up, \xe2\x80\x9cIllaha! Aho! He is loose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a roar and a grunt the Biharin rose to his feet and plunged\r\nforward toward the desert, his driver following with shouts and\r\nlamentation.\r\n\r\nGeorge caught Dick\xe2\x80\x99s arm and hurried him stumbling and tripping past a\r\ndisgusted sentry who was used to stampeding camels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the row now?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery stitch of my kit on that blasted dromedary,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick answered,\r\nafter the manner of a common soldier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, and take care your throat\xe2\x80\x99s not cut outside\xe2\x80\x94you and your\r\ndromedary\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe outcries ceased when the camel had disappeared behind a hillock,\r\nand his driver had called him back and made him kneel down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMount first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick. Then climbing into the second seat and gently\r\nscrewing the pistol muzzle into the small of his companion\xe2\x80\x99s back, \xe2\x80\x9cGo\r\non in God\xe2\x80\x99s name, and swiftly. Good-bye, George. Remember me to Madame,\r\nand have a good time with your girl. Get forward, child of the Pit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few minutes later he was shut up in a great silence, hardly broken by\r\nthe creaking of the saddle and the soft pad of the tireless feet. Dick\r\nadjusted himself comfortably to the rock and pitch of the pace, girthed\r\nhis belt tighter, and felt the darkness slide past. For an hour he was\r\nconscious only of the sense of rapid progress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good camel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was never underfed. He is my own and clean bred,\xe2\x80\x9d the driver\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis head dropped on his chest and he tried to think, but the tenor of\r\nhis thoughts was broken because he was very sleepy. In the half doze it\r\nseemed that he was learning a punishment hymn at Mrs. Jennett\xe2\x80\x99s. He had\r\ncommitted some crime as bad as Sabbath-breaking, and she had locked him\r\nup in his bedroom. But he could never repeat more than the first two\r\nlines of the hymn\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nWhen Israel of the Lord beloved\r\nOut of the land of bondage came.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe said them over and over thousands of times. The driver turned in the\r\nsaddle to see if there were any chance of capturing the revolver and\r\nending the ride. Dick roused, struck him over the head with the butt,\r\nand stormed himself wide awake. Somebody hidden in a clump of\r\ncamel-thorn shouted as the camel toiled up rising ground. A shot was\r\nfired, and the silence shut down again, bringing the desire to sleep.\r\nDick could think no longer. He was too tired and stiff and cramped to\r\ndo more than nod uneasily from time to time, waking with a start and\r\npunching the driver with the pistol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there a moon?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked drowsily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is near her setting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish that I could see her. Halt the camel. At least let me hear the\r\ndesert talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man obeyed. Out of the utter stillness came one breath of wind. It\r\nrattled the dead leaves of a shrub some distance away and ceased. A\r\nhandful of dry earth detached itself from the edge of a rail trench and\r\ncrumbled softly to the bottom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on. The night is very cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose who have watched till the morning know how the last hour before\r\nthe light lengthens itself into many eternities. It seemed to Dick that\r\nhe had never since the beginning of original darkness done anything at\r\nall save jolt through the air. Once in a thousand years he would finger\r\nthe nailheads on the saddle-front and count them all carefully.\r\nCenturies later he would shift his revolver from his right hand to his\r\nleft and allow the eased arm to drop down at his side. From the safe\r\ndistance of London he was watching himself thus employed,\xe2\x80\x94watching\r\ncritically. Yet whenever he put out his hand to the canvas that he\r\nmight paint the tawny yellow desert under the glare of the sinking\r\nmoon, the black shadow of a camel and the two bowed figures atop, that\r\nhand held a revolver and the arm was numbed from wrist to collar-bone.\r\nMoreover, he was in the dark, and could see no canvas of any kind\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe driver grunted, and Dick was conscious of a change in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI smell the dawn,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is here, and yonder are the troops. Have I done well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel stretched out its neck and roared as there came down wind the\r\npungent reek of camels in the square.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on. We must get there swiftly. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are moving in their camp. There is so much dust that I cannot see\r\nwhat they do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I in better case? Go forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey could hear the hum of voices ahead, the howling and the bubbling\r\nof the beasts and the hoarse cries of the soldiers girthing up for the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nTwo or three shots were fired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that at us? Surely they can see that I am English,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick spoke\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, it is from the desert,\xe2\x80\x9d the driver answered, cowering in his\r\nsaddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo forward, my child! Well it is that the dawn did not uncover us an\r\nhour ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel headed straight for the column and the shots behind\r\nmultiplied. The children of the desert had arranged that most\r\nuncomfortable of surprises, a dawn attack for the English troops, and\r\nwere getting their distance by snap-shots at the only moving object\r\nwithout the square.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat luck! What stupendous and imperial luck!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjust\r\nbefore the battle, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d Oh, God has been most good to me!\r\n\r\nOnly\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the agony of the thought made him screw up his eyes for an\r\ninstant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMaisie...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllahu! We are in,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, as he drove into the rearguard and\r\nthe camel knelt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the deuce are you? Despatches or what? What\xe2\x80\x99s the strength of the\r\nenemy behind that ridge? How did you get through?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a dozen\r\nvoices. For all answer Dick took a long breath, unbuckled his belt, and\r\nshouted from the saddle at the top of a wearied and dusty voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTorpenhow! Ohe, Torp! Coo-ee, Tor-pen-how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA bearded man raking in the ashes of a fire for a light to his pipe\r\nmoved very swiftly towards that cry, as the rearguard, facing about,\r\nbegan to fire at the puffs of smoke from the hillocks around. Gradually\r\nthe scattered white cloudlets drew out into the long lines of banked\r\nwhite that hung heavily in the stillness of the dawn before they turned\r\nover wave-like and glided into the valleys. The soldiers in the square\r\nwere coughing and swearing as their own smoke obstructed their view,\r\nand they edged forward to get beyond it. A wounded camel leaped to its\r\nfeet and roared aloud, the cry ending in a bubbling grunt. Some one had\r\ncut its throat to prevent confusion. Then came the thick sob of a man\r\nreceiving his death-wound from a bullet; then a yell of agony and\r\nredoubled firing.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to ask any questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet down, man! Get down behind the camel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Put me, I pray, in the forefront of the battle.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick turned his\r\nface to Torpenhow and raised his hand to set his helmet straight, but,\r\nmiscalculating the distance, knocked it off. Torpenhow saw that his\r\nhair was gray on the temples, and that his face was the face of an old\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome down, you damned fool! Dickie, come off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Dick came obediently, but as a tree falls, pitching sideways from\r\nthe Bisharin\xe2\x80\x99s saddle at Torpenhow\xe2\x80\x99s feet. His luck had held to the\r\nlast, even to the crowning mercy of a kindly bullet through his head.\r\n\r\nTorpenhow knelt under the lee of the camel, with Dick\xe2\x80\x99s body in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LIGHT THAT FAILED ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2876-0.txt or 2876-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/2/8/7/2876/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
