Overwrought by the trying and precarious work of the\r\nforenoon--which had demanded a maximum wariness, prudence, penetration,\r\nand rigour of the will--the writer had not been able even after the noon\r\nmeal to break the impetus of the productive mechanism within him, that\r\n_motus animi continuus_ which constitutes, according to Cicero, the\r\nfoundation of eloquence; and he had not attained the healing sleep\r\nwhich--what with the increasing exhaustion of his strength--he needed in\r\nthe middle of each day. So he had gone outdoors soon after tea, in the\r\nhopes that air and movement would restore him and prepare him for a\r\nprofitable evening.\r\n\r\nIt was the beginning of May, and after cold, damp weeks a false\r\nmidsummer had set in. The English Gardens, although the foliage was\r\nstill fresh and sparse, were as pungent as in August, and in the parts\r\nnearer the city had been full of conveyances and promenaders. At the\r\nAumeister, which he had reached by quieter and quieter paths, Aschenbach\r\nhad surveyed for a short time the Wirtsgarten with its lively crowds and\r\nits border of cabs and carriages. From here, as the sun was sinking, he\r\nhad started home, outside the park, across the open fields; and since he\r\nfelt tired and a storm was threatening from the direction of F\xc3\xb6hring,\r\nhe waited at the North Cemetery for the tram which would take him\r\ndirectly back to the city.\r\n\r\nIt happened that he found no one in the station or its vicinity. There\r\nwas not a vehicle to be seen, either on the paved Ungererstrasse, with\r\nits solitary glistening rails stretching out towards Schwabing, or on\r\nthe F\xc3\xb6hringer Chaussee. Behind the fences of the stone-masons\'\r\nestablishments, where the crosses, memorial tablets, and monuments\r\nstanding for sale formed a second, uninhabited burial ground, there was\r\nno sign of life; and opposite him the Byzantine structure of the Funeral\r\nHall lay silent in the reflection of the departing day; its fa\xc3\xa7ade,\r\nornamented in luminous colours with Greek crosses and hieratic\r\npaintings, above which were displayed inscriptions symmetrically\r\narranged in gold letters, and texts chosen to bear on the life beyond;\r\nsuch as, "They enter into the dwelling of the Lord," or, "The light of\r\neternity shall shine upon them." And for some time as he stood waiting\r\nhe found a grave diversion in spelling out the formulas and letting his\r\nmind\'s eye lose itself in their transparent mysticism, when, returning\r\nfrom his reveries, he noticed in the portico, above the two apocalyptic\r\nanimals guarding the steps, a man whose somewhat unusual appearance gave\r\nhis thoughts an entirely new direction.\r\n\r\nWhether he had just now come out from the inside through the bronze\r\ndoor, or had approached and mounted from the outside unobserved,\r\nremained uncertain. Aschenbach, without applying himself especially to\r\nthe matter, was inclined to believe the former. Of medium height, thin,\r\nsmooth-shaven, and noticeably pug-nosed, the man belonged to the\r\nred-haired type and possessed the appropriate fresh milky complexion.\r\nObviously, he was not of Bavarian extraction, since at least the white\r\nand straight-brimmed straw hat that covered his head gave his appearance\r\nthe stamp of a foreigner, of someone who had come from a long distance.\r\nTo be sure, he was wearing the customary knapsack strapped across his\r\nshoulders, and a belted suit of rough yellow wool; his left arm was\r\nresting on his thigh, and his grey storm cape was thrown across it. In\r\nhis right hand he held a cane with an iron ferrule, which he had stuck\r\ndiagonally into the ground, and, with his feet crossed, was leaning his\r\nhip against the crook. His head was raised so that the Adam\'s-apple\r\nprotruded hard and bare on a scrawny neck emerging from a loose\r\nsport-shirt. And he was staring sharply off into the distance, with\r\ncolourless, red-lidded eyes between which stood two strong, vertical\r\nwrinkles peculiarly suited to his short, turned-up nose. Thus--and\r\nperhaps his elevated position helped to give the impression--his bearing\r\nhad something majestic and commanding about it, something bold, or even\r\nsavage. For whether he was grimacing because he was blinded by the\r\nsetting sun, or whether it was a case of a permanent distortion of the\r\nphysiognomy, his lips seemed too short, they were so completely pulled\r\nback from his teeth that these were exposed even to the gums, and stood\r\nout white and long.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that Aschenbach, in his half-distracted,\r\nhalf-inquisitive examination of the stranger, had been somewhat\r\ninconsiderate, for he suddenly became aware that his look was being\r\nanswered, and indeed so militantly, so straight in the eye, so plainly\r\nwith the intention of driving the thing through to the very end and\r\ncompelling him to capitulate, that he turned away uncomfortably and\r\nbegan walking along by the fences, deciding casually that he would pay\r\nno further attention to the man. The next minute he had forgotten him.\r\nBut perhaps the exotic element in the stranger\'s appearance had worked\r\non his imagination; or a new physical or spiritual influence of some\r\nsort had come into play. He was quite astonished to note a peculiar\r\ninner expansion, a kind of roving unrest, a youthful longing after\r\nfar-off places: a feeling so vivid, so new, or so long dormant and\r\nneglected, that, with his hands behind his back and his eyes on the\r\nground, he came to a sudden stop, and examined into the nature and\r\npurport of this emotion.\r\n\r\nIt was the desire for travel, nothing more; although, to be sure, it had\r\nattacked him violently, and was heightened to a passion, even to the\r\npoint of an hallucination. His yearnings crystallized; his imagination,\r\nstill in ferment from his hours of work, actually pictured all the\r\nmarvels and terrors of a manifold world which it was suddenly struggling\r\nto conceive. He saw a landscape, a tropical swampland under a heavy,\r\nmurky sky, damp, luxuriant, and enormous, a kind of prehistoric\r\nwilderness of islands, bogs, and arms of water, sluggish with mud; he\r\nsaw, near him and in the distance, the hairy shafts of palms rising out\r\nof a rank lecherous thicket, out of places where the plant-life was fat,\r\nswollen, and blossoming exorbitantly; he saw strangely misshapen trees\r\nsending their roots into the ground, into stagnant pools with greenish\r\nreflections; and here, between floating flowers which were milk-white\r\nand large as dishes, birds of a strange nature, high-shouldered, with\r\ncrooked bills, were standing in the muck, and looking motionlessly to\r\none side; between dense, knotted stalks of bamboo he saw the glint from\r\nthe eyes of a crouching tiger--and he felt his heart knocking with fear\r\nand with puzzling desires. Then the image disappeared; and with a shake\r\nof his head Aschenbach resumed his walk along past the fences of the\r\nstone-masons\' establishments.\r\n\r\nSince the time, at least, when he could command the means to enjoy the\r\nadvantages of moving about the world as he pleased, he had considered\r\ntravelling simply as an hygienic precaution which must be complied with\r\nnow and then despite one\'s feelings and one\'s preferences. Too busy with\r\nthe tasks arranged for him by his interest in his own ego and in the\r\nproblems of Europe, too burdened with the onus of production, too little\r\nprone to diversion, and in no sense an amateur of the varied amusements\r\nof the great world, he had been thoroughly satisfied with such knowledge\r\nof the earth\'s surface as any one can get without moving far out of his\r\nown circle; and he had never even been tempted to leave Europe.\r\nEspecially now that his life was slowly on the decline, and that the\r\nartist\'s fear of not having finished--this uneasiness lest the clock run\r\ndown before he had done his part and given himself completely--could no\r\nlonger be waived aside as a mere whim, he had confined his outer\r\nexistence almost exclusively to the beautiful city which had become his\r\nhome and to the rough country house which he had built in the mountains\r\nand where he spent the rainy summers.\r\n\r\nFurther, this thing which had laid hold of him so belatedly, but with\r\nsuch suddenness, was very readily moderated and adjusted by the force of\r\nhis reason and of a discipline which he had practised since youth. He\r\nhad intended carrying his life work forward to a certain point before\r\nremoving to the country. And the thought of knocking about the world for\r\nmonths and neglecting his work during this time, seemed much too lax and\r\ncontrary to his plans; it really could not be considered seriously. Yet\r\nhe knew only too well what the reasons were for this unexpected\r\ntemptation. It was the urge to escape--he admitted to himself--this\r\nyearning for the new and the remote, this appetite for freedom, for\r\nunburdening, for forgetfulness; it was a pressure away from his work,\r\nfrom the steady drudgery of a coldly passionate service. To be sure, he\r\nloved this work and almost loved the enervating battle that was fought\r\ndaily between a proud tenacious will--so often tested--and this growing\r\nweariness which no one was to suspect and which must not betray itself\r\nin his productions by any sign of weakness or negligence. But it seemed\r\nwise not to draw the bow overtightly, and not to strangle by sheer\r\nobstinacy so strongly persistent an appetite. He thought of his work,\r\nthought of the place at which yesterday and now again to-day he had been\r\nforced to leave off, and which, it seemed, would yield neither to\r\npatience and coaxing nor to a definite attack. He examined it again,\r\ntrying to break through or to circumvent the deadlock, but he gave up\r\nwith a shudder of repugnance. There was no unusual difficulty here; what\r\nbalked him were the scruples of aversion, which took the form of a\r\nfastidious insatiability. Even as a young man this insatiability had\r\nmeant to him the very nature, the fullest essence, of talent; and for\r\nthat reason he had restrained and chilled his emotions, since he was\r\naware that they incline to content themselves with a happy\r\napproximation, a state of semi-completion. Were these enslaved emotions\r\nnow taking their vengeance on him, by leaving him in the lurch, by\r\nrefusing to forward and lubricate his art; and were they bearing off\r\nwith them every enjoyment, every live interest in form and expression?\r\n\r\nNot that he was producing anything bad; his years gave him at least this\r\nadvantage, that he felt himself at all times in full and easy possession\r\nof his craftsmanship. But while the nation honoured him for this, he\r\nhimself was not content; and it seemed to him that his work lacked the\r\nmarks of that fiery and fluctuating emotionalism which is an enormous\r\nthing in one\'s favour, and which, while it argues an enjoyment on the\r\npart of the author, also constitutes, more than any depth of content,\r\nthe enjoyment of the amateur. He feared the summer in the country, alone\r\nin the little house with the maid who prepared his meals, and the\r\nservant who brought them to him. He feared the familiar view of the\r\nmountain peaks and the slopes which would stand about him in his boredom\r\nand his discontent. Consequently there was need of a break in some new\r\ndirection. If the summer was to be endurable and productive, he must\r\nattempt something out of his usual orbit; he must relax, get a change of\r\nair, bring an element of freshness into the blood. To travel, then--that\r\nmuch was settled. Not far, not all the way to the tigers. But one night\r\non the sleeper, and a rest of three or four weeks at some pleasant\r\npopular resort in the South. . . .\r\n\r\nHe thought this out while the noise of the electric tram came nearer\r\nalong the Ungererstrasse; and as he boarded it he decided to devote the\r\nevening to the study of maps and time-tables. On the platform it\r\noccurred to him to look around for the man in the straw hat, his\r\ncompanion during that most significant time spent waiting at the\r\nstation. But his whereabouts remained uncertain, as he was not to be\r\nseen either at the place where he was formerly standing, or anywhere\r\nelse in the vicinity of the station, or on the car itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of that lucid and powerful prose epic built around the life\r\nof Frederick of Prussia; the tenacious artist who, after long\r\napplication, wove rich, varied strands of human destiny together under\r\none single predominating theme in the fictional tapestry known as Maya;\r\nthe creator of that stark tale which is called The Wretch and which\r\npointed out for an entire oncoming generation the possibility of some\r\nmoral certainty beyond pure knowledge; finally, the writer (and this\r\nsums up briefly the works of his mature period) of the impassioned\r\ntreatise on Art and the Spirit, whose capacity for mustering facts, and,\r\nfurther, whose fluency in their presentation, led cautious judges to\r\nplace this treatise alongside Schiller\'s conclusions on na\xc3\xafve and\r\nsentimental poetry--Gustav Aschenbach, then, was the son of a higher law\r\nofficial, and was born in L----, a leading city in the Province of\r\nSilesia. His forbears had been officers, magistrates, government\r\nfunctionaries, men who had led severe, steady lives serving their king,\r\ntheir state. A deeper strain of spirituality had been manifest in them\r\nonce, in the person of a preacher; the preceding generation had brought\r\na brisker, more sensuous blood into the family through the author\'s\r\nmother, daughter of a Bohemian band-master. The traces of foreignness in\r\nhis features came from her. A marriage of sober painstaking\r\nconscientiousness with impulses of a darker, more fiery nature had had\r\nan artist as its result, and this particular artist.\r\n\r\nSince his whole nature was centred around acquiring a reputation, he\r\nshowed himself, if not exactly precocious, at least (thanks to the\r\nfirmness and pithiness of his personality, his accent) ripened and\r\nadjusted to the public at an early age. Almost as a schoolboy he had\r\nmade a name for himself. Within ten years he had learned to face the\r\nworld through the medium of his writing-table, to discharge the\r\nobligations of his fame in a correspondence which (since many claims are\r\npressed on the successful, the trustworthy) had to be brief as well as\r\npleasant and to the point. At forty, wearied by the vicissitudes and the\r\nexertion of his own work, he had to manage a daily mail which bore the\r\npostmarks of countries in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nEqually removed from the banal and the eccentric, his talents were so\r\nconstituted as to gain both the confidence of the general public and the\r\nstable admiration and sympathy of the critical. Thus even as a young man\r\ncontinually devoted to the pursuit of craftsmanship--and that of no\r\nordinary kind--he had never known the careless freedom of youth. When,\r\naround thirty-five years of age, he had been taken ill in Vienna, one\r\nsharp observer said of him in company, "You see, Aschenbach has always\r\nlived like this," and the speaker contracted the fingers of his left\r\nhand into a fist; "never like this," and he let his open hand droop\r\ncomfortably from the arm of his chair. That hit the mark; and the\r\nheroic, the ethical about it all was that he was not of a strong\r\nconstitution, and though he was pledged by his nature to these steady\r\nefforts, he was not really born to them.\r\n\r\nConsiderations of ill-health had kept him from attending school as a\r\nboy, and had compelled him to receive instruction at home. He had grown\r\nup alone, without comrades--and he was forced to realize soon enough\r\nthat he belonged to a race which often lacked, not talent, but that\r\nphysical substructure which talent relies on for its fullest fruition: a\r\nrace accustomed to giving its best early, and seldom extending its\r\nfaculties over the years. But his favourite phrase was "carrying\r\nthrough"; in his novel on Frederick he saw the pure apotheosis of this\r\ncommand, which struck him as the essential concept of the virtuous in\r\naction and passion. Also, he wished earnestly to grow old, since he had\r\nalways maintained that the only artistry which can be called truly\r\ngreat, comprehensive, yes even truly admirable, is that which is\r\npermitted to bear fruits characteristic of each stage in human\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nSince he must carry the responsibilities of his talent on frail\r\nshoulders, and wanted to go a long way, the primary requirement was\r\ndiscipline--and fortunately discipline was his direct inheritance from\r\nhis father\'s side. By forty, fifty, or at an earlier age when others are\r\nstill slashing about with enthusiasm, and are contentedly putting off to\r\nsome later date the execution of plans on a large scale, he would start\r\nthe day early, dashing cold water over his chest and back, and then with\r\na couple of tall wax candles in silver candlesticks at the head of his\r\nmanuscript, he would pay out to his art, in two or three eager,\r\nscrupulous morning hours, the strength which he had accumulated in\r\nsleep. It was pardonable, indeed it was a direct tribute to the\r\neffectiveness of his moral scheme, that the uninitiated took his Maya\r\nworld, and the massive epic machinery upon which the life of the hero\r\nFrederick was unrolled, as evidence of long breath and sustaining power.\r\nWhile actually they had been built up layer by layer, in small daily\r\nallotments, through hundreds and hundreds of single inspirations. And if\r\nthey were so excellent in both composition and texture, it was solely\r\nbecause their creator had held out for years under the strain of one\r\nsingle work, with a steadiness of will and a tenacity comparable to that\r\nwhich conquered his native province; and because, finally, he had turned\r\nover his most vital and valuable hours to the problem of minute\r\nrevision.\r\n\r\nIn order that a significant work of the mind may exert immediately some\r\nbroad and deep effect, a secret relationship, or even conformity, must\r\nexist between the personal destiny of the author and the common destiny\r\nof his contemporaries. People do not know why they raise a work of art\r\nto fame. Far from being connoisseurs, they believe that they see in it\r\nhundreds of virtues which justify so much interest; but the true reason\r\nfor their applause is an unconscious sympathy. Aschenbach had once\r\nstated quite plainly in some remote place that nearly everything great\r\nwhich comes into being does so in spite of something--in spite of sorrow\r\nor suffering, poverty, destitution, physical weakness, depravity,\r\npassion, or a thousand other handicaps. But that was not merely an\r\nobservation; it was a discovery, the formula of his life and reputation,\r\nthe key to his work. And what wonder then that it was also the\r\ndistinguishing moral trait, the dominating gesture, of his most\r\ncharacteristic figures?\r\n\r\nYears before, one shrewd analyst had written of the new hero-type to\r\nwhich this author gave preference, and which kept turning up in\r\nvariations of one sort or another: he called it the conception of "an\r\nintellectual and youthful masculinity" which "stands motionless,\r\nhaughty, ashamed, with jaw set, while swords and spear-points beset the\r\nbody." That was beautiful and ingenious; and it was exact, although it\r\nmay have seemed to suggest too much passivity. For to be poised against\r\nfatality, to meet adverse conditions gracefully, is more than simple\r\nendurance; it is an act of aggression, a positive triumph--and the\r\nfigure of Sebastian is the most beautiful figure, if not of art as a\r\nwhole, at least of the art of literature. Looking into this fictional\r\nworld, one saw: a delicate self-mastery by which any inner\r\ndeterioration, any biological decay was kept concealed from the eyes of\r\nthe world; a crude, vicious sensuality capable of fanning its rising\r\npassions into pure flame, yes, even of mounting to dominance in the\r\nrealm of beauty; a pallid weakness which draws from the glowing depths\r\nof the soul the strength to bow whole arrogant peoples before the foot\r\nof the cross, or before the feet of weakness itself; a charming manner\r\nmaintained in his cold, strict service to form; a false, precarious mode\r\nof living, and the keenly enervating melancholy and artifice of the born\r\ndeceiver--to observe such trials as this was enough to make one question\r\nwhether there really was any heroism other than weakness. And in any\r\ncase, what heroism could be more in keeping with the times? Gustav\r\nAschenbach was the one poet among the many workers on the verge of\r\nexhaustion: all those over-burdened, used-up, tenacious moralists of\r\nproduction who, delicately built and destitute of means, can rely for a\r\ntime at least on will-power and the shrewd husbandry of their resources\r\nto secure the effects of greatness. There are many such: they are the\r\nheroes of the period. And they all found themselves in his works; here\r\nthey were indeed, upheld, intensified, applauded; they were grateful to\r\nhim, they acclaimed him.\r\n\r\nIn his time he had been young and raw; and misled by his age he had\r\nblundered in public. He had stumbled, had exposed himself; both in\r\nwriting and in talk he had offended against caution and tact. But he had\r\nacquired the dignity which, as he insisted, is the innate goad and\r\ncraving of every great talent; in fact, it could be said that his entire\r\ndevelopment had been a conscious undeviating progression away from the\r\nembarrassments of scepticism and irony, and towards dignity.\r\n\r\nThe general masses are satisfied by vigour and tangibility of treatment\r\nrather than by any close intellectual processes; but youth, with its\r\npassion for the absolute, can be arrested only by the problematical. And\r\nAschenbach had been absolute, problematical, as only a youth could be.\r\nHe had been a slave to the intellect, had played havoc with knowledge,\r\nhad ground up his seed crops, had divulged secrets, had discredited\r\ntalent, had betrayed art--yes, while his modellings were entertaining\r\nthe faithful votaries, filling them with enthusiasm, making their lives\r\nmore keen, this youthful artist was taking the breath away from the\r\ngeneration then in its twenties by his cynicisms on the questionable\r\nnature of art, and of artistry itself.\r\n\r\nBut it seems that nothing blunts the edge of a noble, robust mind more\r\nquickly and more thoroughly than the sharp and bitter corrosion of\r\nknowledge; and certainly the moody radicalism of the youth, no matter\r\nhow conscientious, was shallow in comparison with his firm determination\r\nas an older man and a master to deny knowledge, to reject it, to pass it\r\nwith raised head, in so far as it is capable of crippling, discouraging,\r\nor degrading to the slightest degree, our will, acts, feelings, or even\r\npassions. How else could the famous story of The Wretch be understood\r\nthan as an outburst of repugnance against the disreputable psychologism\r\nof the times: embodied in the figure of that soft and stupid half-clown\r\nwho pilfers a destiny for himself by guiding his wife (from\r\npowerlessness, from lasciviousness, from ethical frailty) into the arms\r\nof an adolescent, and believes that he may through profundity commit\r\nvileness? The verbal pressure with which he here cast out the outcast\r\nannounced the return from every moral scepticism, from all\r\nfellow-feeling with the engulfed: it was the counter-move to the laxity\r\nof the sympathetic principle that to understand all is to forgive\r\nall--and the thing that was here well begun, even nearly completed, was\r\nthat "miracle of reborn ingenuousness" which was taken up a little later\r\nin one of the author\'s dialogues expressly and not without a certain\r\ndiscreet emphasis. Strange coincidences! Was it as a result of this\r\nrebirth, this new dignity and sternness, that his feeling for beauty--a\r\ndiscriminating purity, simplicity, and evenness of attack which\r\nhenceforth gave his productions such an obvious, even such a deliberate\r\nstamp of mastery and classicism--showed an almost excessive\r\nstrengthening about this time? But ethical resoluteness in the exclusion\r\nof science, of emancipatory and restrictive knowledge--does this not in\r\nturn signify a simplification, a reduction morally of the world to too\r\nlimited terms, and thus also a strengthened capacity for the forbidden,\r\nthe evil, the morally impossible? And does not form have two aspects? Is\r\nit not moral and unmoral at once--moral in that it is the result and\r\nexpression of discipline, but unmoral, and even immoral, in that by\r\nnature it contains an indifference to morality, is calculated, in fact,\r\nto make morality bend beneath its proud and unencumbered sceptre?\r\n\r\nBe that as it may. An evolution is a destiny; and why should his\r\nevolution, which had been upheld by the general confidence of a vast\r\npublic, not run through a different course from one accomplished outside\r\nthe lustre and the entanglements of fame? Only chronic vagabondage will\r\nfind it tedious and be inclined to scoff when a great talent outgrows\r\nthe libertine chrysalis-stage, learns to seize upon and express the\r\ndignity of the mind, and superimposes a formal etiquette upon a solitude\r\nwhich had been filled with unchastened and rigidly isolated sufferings\r\nand struggles and had brought all this to a point of power and honour\r\namong men. Further, how much sport, defiance, indulgence there is in the\r\nself-formation of a talent! Gradually something official, didactic crept\r\ninto Gustav Aschenbach\'s productions, his style in later life fought shy\r\nof any abruptness and boldness, any subtle and unexpected contrasts; he\r\ninclined towards the fixed and standardized, the conventionally elegant,\r\nthe conservative, the formal, the formulated, nearly. And, as is\r\ntraditionally said of Louis XIV, with the advancing years he came to\r\nomit every common word from his vocabulary. At about this time it\r\nhappened that the educational authorities included selected pages by him\r\nin their prescribed school readers. This was deeply sympathetic to his\r\nnature, and he did not decline when a German prince who had just mounted\r\nto the throne raised the author of the Frederick to nobility on the\r\noccasion of his fiftieth birthday. After a few years of unrest, a few\r\ntentative stopping-places here and there, he soon chose Munich as his\r\npermanent home, and lived there in a state of middle-class\r\nrespectability such as fits in with the life of the mind in certain\r\nindividual instances. The marriage which, when still young, he had\r\ncontracted with a girl of an educated family came to an end with her\r\ndeath after a short period of happiness. He was left with a daughter,\r\nnow married. He had never had a son.\r\n\r\nGustav von Aschenbach was somewhat below average height, dark, and\r\nsmooth-shaven. His head seemed a bit too large in comparison with his\r\nalmost dapper figure. His hair was brushed straight back, thinning out\r\ntowards the crown, but very full about the temples, and strongly marked\r\nwith grey; it framed a high, ridged forehead. Gold spectacles with\r\nrimless lenses cut into the bridge of his bold, heavy nose. The mouth\r\nwas big, sometimes drooping, sometimes suddenly pinched and firm. His\r\ncheeks were thin and wrinkled, his well-formed chin had a slight cleft.\r\nThis head, usually bent patiently to one side, seemed to have gone\r\nthrough momentous experiences, and yet it was his art which had produced\r\nthose effects in his face, effects which are elsewhere the result of\r\nhard and agitated living. Behind this brow the brilliant repartee of the\r\ndialogue on war between Voltaire and the king had been born; these eyes,\r\npeering steadily and wearily from behind their glasses, had seen the\r\nbloody inferno of the lazaret in the Seven Years\' War. Even as it\r\napplies to the individual, art is a heightened mode of existence. It\r\ngives deeper pleasures, it consumes more quickly. It carves into its\r\nservants\' faces the marks of imaginary and spiritual adventures, and\r\nthough their external activities may be as quiet as a cloister, it\r\nproduces a lasting voluptuousness, over-refinement, fatigue, and\r\ncuriosity of the nerves such as can barely result from a life filled\r\nwith illicit passions and enjoyments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious matters of a literary and social nature delayed his departure\r\nuntil about two weeks after that walk in Munich. Finally he gave orders\r\nto have his country house ready for occupancy within a month; and one\r\nday between the middle and the end of May he took the night train for\r\nTrieste, where he made a stop-over of only twenty-four hours, and\r\nembarked the following morning for Pola.\r\n\r\nWhat he was hunting was something foreign and unrelated to himself which\r\nwould at the same time be quickly within reach; and so he stopped at an\r\nisland in the Adriatic which had become well-known in recent years. It\r\nlay not far off the Istrian coast, with beautifully rugged cliffs\r\nfronting the open sea, and natives who dressed in variegated tatters and\r\nmade strange sounds when they spoke. But rain and a heavy atmosphere, a\r\nprovincial and exclusively Austrian patronage at the hotel, and the lack\r\nof that restfully intimate association with the sea which can be gotten\r\nonly by a soft, sandy beach, irritated him, and prevented him from\r\nfeeling that he had found the place he was looking for. Something within\r\nwas disturbing him, and drawing him he was not sure where. He studied\r\nsailing dates, he looked about him questioningly, and of a sudden, as a\r\nthing both astounding and self-evident, his goal was before him. If you\r\nwanted to reach over night the unique, the fabulously different, where\r\ndid you go? But that was plain. What was he doing here? He had lost the\r\ntrail. He had wanted to go there. He did not delay in giving notice of\r\nhis mistake in stopping here. In the early morning mist, a week and a\r\nhalf after his arrival on the island, a fast motorboat was carrying him\r\nand his luggage back over the water to the naval port, and he landed\r\nthere just long enough to cross the gangplank to the damp deck of a ship\r\nwhich was lying under steam ready for the voyage to Venice.\r\n\r\nIt was an old hulk flying the Italian flag, decrepit, sooty, and\r\nmournful. In a cave-like, artificially lighted inside cabin where\r\nAschenbach, immediately upon boarding the ship, was conducted by a dirty\r\nhunchbacked sailor who smirked politely, there was sitting behind a\r\ntable, his hat cocked over his forehead and a cigarette stump in the\r\ncorner of his mouth, a man with a goatee, and with the face of an\r\nold-style circus director, who was taking down the particulars of the\r\npassengers with professional grimaces and distributing the tickets. "To\r\nVenice!" he repeated Aschenbach\'s request, as he extended his arm and\r\nplunged his pen into the pasty dregs of a precariously tilted inkwell.\r\n"To Venice, first class! At your service, sir." And he wrote a generous\r\nscrawl, sprinkled it with blue sand out of a box, let the sand run off\r\ninto a clay bowl, folded the paper with sallow, bony fingers, and began\r\nwriting again. "A happily chosen destination!" he chatted on. "Ah,\r\nVenice! A splendid city! A city of irresistible attractiveness for the\r\neducated on account of its history as well as its present-day charms!"\r\nThe smooth rapidity of his movements and the empty words accompanying\r\nthem had something anaesthetic and reassuring about them, much as though\r\nhe feared lest the traveller might still be vacillating in his decision\r\nto go to Venice. He handled the cash briskly, and let the change fall on\r\nthe spotted table-cover with the skill of a croupier. "A pleasant\r\njourney, sir!" he said with a theatrical bow. "Gentlemen, I have the\r\nhonour of serving you!" he called out immediately after, with his arm\r\nupraised, and he acted as if business were in full swing, although no\r\none else was there to require his attention. Aschenbach returned to the\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nWith one arm on the railing, he watched the passengers on board and the\r\nidlers who loitered around the dock waiting for the ship to sail. The\r\nsecond class passengers, men and women, were huddled together on the\r\nforedeck, using boxes and bundles as seats. A group of young people made\r\nup the travellers on the first deck, clerks from Pola, it seemed, who\r\nhad gathered in the greatest excitement for an excursion to Italy. They\r\nmade a considerable fuss about themselves and their enterprise,\r\nchattered, laughed, enjoyed their own antics self-contentedly, and,\r\nleaning over the hand-rails, shouted flippantly and mockingly at their\r\ncomrades who, with portfolios under their arms, were going up and down\r\nthe waterfront on business and kept threatening the picnickers with\r\ntheir canes. One, in a bright yellow summer suit of ultra-fashionable\r\ncut, with a red necktie, and a rakishly tilted panama, surpassed all the\r\nothers in his crowing good humour. But as soon as Aschenbach looked at\r\nhim a bit more carefully, he discovered with a kind of horror that the\r\nyouth was a cheat. He was old, that was unquestionable. There were\r\nwrinkles around his eyes and mouth. The faint crimson of the cheeks was\r\npaint, the hair under his brilliantly decorated straw hat was a wig; his\r\nneck was hollow and stringy, his turned-up moustache and the imperial on\r\nhis chin were dyed; the full set of yellow teeth which he displayed when\r\nhe laughed, a cheap artificial plate; and his hands, with signet rings\r\non both index fingers, were those of an old man. Fascinated with\r\nloathing, Aschenbach watched him in his intercourse with his friends.\r\nDid they not know, did they not observe that he was old, that he was not\r\nentitled to wear their bright, foppish clothing, that he was not\r\nentitled to play at being one of them? Unquestioningly, and as quite the\r\nusual thing, it seemed, they allowed him among them, treating him as one\r\nof their own kind and returning his jovial nudges in the ribs without\r\nrepugnance. How could that be? Aschenbach laid his hand on his forehead\r\nand closed his eyes; they were hot, since he had had too little sleep.\r\nHe felt as though everything were not quite the same as usual, as though\r\nsome dream-like estrangement, some peculiar distortion of the world,\r\nwere beginning to take possession of him, and perhaps this could be\r\nstopped if he hid his face for a time and then looked around him again.\r\nYet at this moment he felt as though he were swimming; and looking up\r\nwith an unreasoned fear, he discovered that the heavy, lugubrious body\r\nof the ship was separating slowly from the walled bank. Inch by inch,\r\nwith the driving and reversing of the engine, the strip of dirty\r\nglistening water widened between the dock and the side of the ship; and\r\nafter cumbersome manoeuvring, the steamer finally turned its nose\r\ntowards the open sea. Aschenbach crossed to the starboard side, where\r\nthe hunchback had set up a deck-chair for him, and a steward in a\r\nspotted dress-coat asked after his wants.\r\n\r\nThe sky was grey, the wind damp. Harbour and islands had been left\r\nbehind, and soon all land was lost in the haze. Flakes of coal dust,\r\nbloated with moisture, fell over the washed deck, which would not dry.\r\nAfter the first hour an awning was spread, since it had begun to rain.\r\n\r\nBundled up in his coat, a book in his lap, the traveller rested, and the\r\nhours passed unnoticed. It stopped raining; the canvas awning was\r\nremoved. The horizon was unbroken. The sea, empty, like an enormous\r\ndisk, lay stretched under the curve of the sky. But in empty\r\ninarticulate space our senses lose also the dimensions of time, and we\r\nslip into the incommensurate. As he rested, strange shadowy figures, the\r\nold dandy, the goatee from the inside cabin, passed through his mind,\r\nwith vague gestures, muddled dream-words--and he was asleep.\r\n\r\nAbout noon he was called to a meal down in the corridor-like dining-hall\r\ninto which the doors opened from the sleeping-cabins; he ate near the\r\nhead of a long table, at the other end of which the clerks including the\r\nold man had been drinking with the boisterous captain since ten o\'clock.\r\nThe food was poor, and he finished rapidly. He felt driven outside to\r\nlook at the sky, to see if it showed signs of being brighter above\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nHe had kept thinking that this had to occur, since the city had always\r\nreceived him in full blaze. But sky and sea remained dreary and leaden,\r\nat times a misty rain fell, and here he was reaching by water a\r\ndifferent Venice than he had ever found when approaching on land. He\r\nstood by the forestays, looking in the distance, waiting for land. He\r\nthought of the heavy-hearted, enthusiastic poet for whom the domes and\r\nbell towers of his dreams had once risen out of these waters; he relived\r\nin silence some of that reverence, happiness, and sorrow which had been\r\nturned then into cautious song; and easily susceptible to sensations\r\nalready moulded, he asked himself wearily and earnestly whether some new\r\nenchantment and distraction, some belated adventure of the emotions,\r\nmight still be held in store for this idle traveller.\r\n\r\nThen the flat coast emerged on the right; the sea was alive with fishing\r\nsmacks; the bathers\' island appeared; it dropped behind to the left, the\r\nsteamer slowly entered the narrow port which is named after it; and on\r\nthe lagoon, facing gay ramshackle houses, it stopped completely, since\r\nit had to wait for the barque of the health department.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed before it appeared. He had arrived, and yet he had not;\r\nno one was in any hurry, no one was driven by impatience. The young men\r\nfrom Pola, patriotically attracted by the military bugle calls which\r\nrang over the water from the vicinity of the public gardens, had come on\r\ndeck, and warmed by their Asti, they burst out with cheers for the\r\ndrilling _bersagliere._ But it was repulsive to see what a state the\r\nprimped-up old man had been brought to by his comradeship with youth.\r\nHis old head was not able to resist its wine like the young and robust:\r\nhe was painfully drunk. With glazed eyes, a cigarette between his\r\ntrembling fingers, he stood in one place, swaying backwards and forwards\r\nfrom giddiness, and balancing himself laboriously. Since he would have\r\nfallen at the first step, he did not trust himself from the spot--yet he\r\nshowed a deplorable insolence, buttonholed everyone who came near him,\r\nstammered, winked, and tittered, lifted his wrinkled, ornamented index\r\nfinger in a stupid attempt at bantering, while he licked the corers of\r\nhis mouth with his tongue in the most abominably suggestive manner.\r\nAschenbach observed him darkly, and a feeling of numbness came over him\r\nagain, as though the world were displaying a faint but irresistible\r\ntendency to distort itself into the peculiar and the grotesque: a\r\nfeeling which circumstances prevented him from surrendering himself to\r\ncompletely, for just then the pounding activity of the engines commenced\r\nagain, and the ship, resuming a voyage which had been interrupted so\r\nnear its completion, passed through the San Marco canal.\r\n\r\nSo he saw it again, the most remarkable of landing places, that blinding\r\ncomposition of fantastic buildings which the Republic lays out before\r\nthe eyes of approaching seafarers: the soft splendour of the palace, the\r\nBridge of Sighs, on the bank the columns with lion and saint, the\r\nadvancing, showy flank of the enchanted temple, the glimpse through to\r\nthe archway, and the huge giant clock. And as he looked on he thought\r\nthat to reach Venice by land, on the rail-road, was like entering a\r\npalace from the rear, and that the most unreal of cities should not be\r\napproached except as he was now doing, by ship, over the high seas.\r\n\r\nThe engine stopped, gondolas pressed in, the gangway was let down,\r\ncustoms officials climbed on board and discharged their duties\r\nperfunctorily; the disembarking could begin. Aschenbach made it\r\nunderstood that he wanted a gondola to take him and his luggage to the\r\ndock of those little steamers which ply between the city and the Lido,\r\nsince he intended to locate near the sea. His plans were complied with,\r\nhis wants were shouted down to the water, where the gondoliers were\r\nwrangling with one another in dialect. He was still hindered from\r\ndescending; he was hindered by his trunk, which was being pulled and\r\ndragged with difficulty down the ladder-like steps. So that for some\r\nminutes he was not able to avoid the importunities of the atrocious old\r\nman, whose drunkenness gave him a sinister desire to do the foreigner\r\nparting honours. "We wish you a very agreeable visit," he bleated as he\r\nmade an awkward bow. "We leave with pleasant recollections! _Au revoir,\r\nexcusez_, and _bon jour_, your excellency!" His mouth watered, he\r\npressed his eyes shut, he licked the corners of his mouth, and the dyed\r\nimperial turned up about his senile lips. "Our compliments," he mumbled,\r\nwith two fingertips on his mouth, "our compliments to our sweetheart,\r\nthe dearest prettiest sweetheart . . ." And suddenly his false upper\r\nteeth fell down on his lower lip. Aschenbach was able to escape. "To our\r\nsweetheart, our handsome sweetheart," he heard the cooing, hollow,\r\nstuttering voice behind him, while supporting himself against the\r\nhandrail, he went down the gang-way.\r\n\r\nWho would not have to suppress a fleeting shudder, a vague timidity and\r\nuneasiness, if it were a matter of boarding a Venetian gondola for the\r\nfirst time or after several years? The strange craft, an entirely\r\nunaltered survival from the times of balladry, with that peculiar\r\nblackness which is found elsewhere only in coffins--it suggests silent,\r\ncriminal adventures in the rippling night, it suggests even more\r\nstrongly death itself, the bier and the mournful funeral, and the last\r\nsilent journey. And has it been observed that the seat of such a barque,\r\nthis arm-chair of coffin-black veneer and dull black upholstery, is the\r\nsoftest, most luxuriant, most lulling seat in the world? Aschenbach\r\nnoted this when he had relaxed at the feet of the gondolier, opposite\r\nhis luggage, which lay neatly assembled on the prow. The rowers were\r\nstill wrangling, harshly, incomprehensibly, with threatening gestures.\r\nBut the strange silence of this canal city seemed to soften their\r\nvoices, to disembody them, and dissipate them over the water. It was\r\nwarm here in the harbour. Touched faintly by the warm breeze of the\r\nsirocco, leaning back against the limber portions of the cushions, the\r\ntraveller closed his eyes in the enjoyment of a lassitude which was as\r\nunusual with him as it was sweet. The trip would be short, he thought;\r\nif only it went on for ever! He felt himself glide with a gentle motion\r\naway from the crowd and the confusion of voices.\r\n\r\nIt became quieter and quieter around him! There was nothing to be heard\r\nbut the splashing of the oar, the hollow slapping of the waves against\r\nthe prow of the boat as it stood above the water black and bold and\r\narmed with its halberd-like tip, and a third sound, of speaking, of\r\nwhispering--the whispering of the gondolier, who was talking to himself\r\nbetween his teeth, fitfully, in words that were pressed out by the\r\nexertion of his arms. Aschenbach looked up, and was slightly astonished\r\nto discover that the lagoon was widening, and he was headed for the open\r\nsea. This seemed to indicate that he ought not to rest too much, but\r\nshould see to it that his wishes were carried out.\r\n\r\n"To the steamer dock!" he repeated, turning around completely and\r\nlooking into the face of the gondolier who stood behind on a raised\r\nplatform and towered up between him and the dun-coloured sky. He was a\r\nman of unpleasant, even brutal, appearance, dressed in sailor blue, with\r\na yellow sash; a formless straw hat, its weave partially unravelled, was\r\ntilted insolently on his head. The set of his face, the blond curly\r\nmoustache beneath a curtly turned-up nose, undoubtedly meant that he was\r\nnot Italian. Although of somewhat frail build, so that one would not\r\nhave thought him especially well suited to his trade, he handled the oar\r\nwith great energy, throwing his entire body into each stroke.\r\nOccasionally, he drew back his lips from the exertion, and disclosed his\r\nwhite teeth. Wrinkling his reddish brows, he gazed on past his\r\npassenger, as he answered deliberately, almost gruffly: "You are going\r\nto the Lido." Aschenbach replied: "Of course. But I have just taken the\r\ngondola to get me across to San Marco. I want to use the _vaporetto._"\r\n\r\n"You cannot use the _vaporetto_, sir."\r\n\r\n"And why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because the _vaporetto_ will not haul luggage."\r\n\r\nThat was so; Aschenbach remembered. He was silent. But the fellow\'s\r\nharsh, presumptuous manner, so unusual towards a foreigner here, seemed\r\nunbearable. He said: "That is my affair. Perhaps I want to put my things\r\nin storage. You will turn back." There was silence. The oar splashed,\r\nthe water thudded against the bow. And the talking and whispering began\r\nagain. The gondolier was talking to himself between his teeth.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? This man was strangely insolent, and had an uncanny\r\ndecisiveness; the traveller, alone with him on the water, saw no way of\r\ngetting what he wanted. And besides, how softly he could rest, if only\r\nhe did not become excited! Hadn\'t he wanted the trip to go on and on for\r\never? It was wisest to let things take their course, and the main thing\r\nwas that he was comfortable. The poison of inertia seemed to be issuing\r\nfrom the seat, from this low, black-upholstered arm-chair, so gently\r\ncradled by the oar strokes of the imperious gondolier behind him. The\r\nnotion that he had fallen into the hands of a criminal passed dreamily\r\nacross Aschenbach\'s mind--without the ability to summon his thoughts to\r\nan active defence. The possibility that it was all simply a plan for\r\ncheating him seemed more abhorrent. A feeling of duty or pride, a kind\r\nof recollection that one should prevent such things, gave him the\r\nstrength to arouse himself once more. He asked: "What are you asking for\r\nthe trip?"\r\n\r\nLooking down upon him, the gondolier answered: "You will pay."\r\n\r\nIt was plain how this should be answered. Aschenbach said mechanically:\r\n"I shall pay nothing, absolutely nothing, if you don\'t take me where I\r\nwant to go."\r\n\r\n"You want to go to the Lido."\r\n\r\n"But not with you."\r\n\r\n"I am rowing you well."\r\n\r\nThat is so, Aschenbach thought, and relaxed. That is so; you are rowing\r\nme well. Even if you do have designs on my cash, and send me down to\r\nPluto with a blow of your oar from behind, you will have rowed me well.\r\n\r\nBut nothing like that happened. They were even joined by others: a\r\nboatload of musical brigands, men and women, who sang to guitar and\r\nmandolin, riding persistently side by side with the gondola and filling\r\nthe silence over the water with their covetous foreign poetry. A hat was\r\nheld out, and Aschenbach threw in money. Then they stopped singing, and\r\nrowed away. And again the muttering of the gondolier could be heard as\r\nhe talked fitfully and jerkily to himself.\r\n\r\nSo they arrived, tossed in the wake of a steamer plying towards the\r\ncity. Two municipal officers, their hands behind their backs, their\r\nfaces turned in the direction of the lagoon, were walking back and forth\r\non the bank. Aschenbach left the gondola at the dock, supported by that\r\nold man who is stationed with his grappling hook at each one of Venice\'s\r\nlanding-places. And since he had no small money, he crossed over to the\r\nhotel by the steamer wharf to get change and pay the rower what was due\r\nhim. He got what he wanted in the lobby, he returned and found his\r\ntravelling bags in a cart on the dock, and gondola and gondolier had\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n"He got out in a hurry," said the old man with the grappling hook. "A\r\nbad man, a man without a license, sir. He is the only gondolier who\r\ndoesn\'t have a license. The others telephoned here."\r\n\r\nAschenbach shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"The gentleman rode for nothing," the old man said, and held out his\r\nhat. Aschenbach tossed in a coin. He gave instructions to have his\r\nluggage taken to the beach hotel, and followed the cart through the\r\navenue, the white-blossomed avenue which, lined on both sides with\r\ntaverns, shops, and boarding houses, runs across the island to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nHe entered the spacious hotel from the rear, by the terraced garden, and\r\npassed through the vestibule and the lobby until he reached the desk.\r\nSince he had been announced, he was received with obliging promptness. A\r\nmanager, a small frail flatteringly polite man with a black moustache\r\nand a French style frock coat, accompanied him to the third floor in the\r\nlift, and showed him his room, an agreeable place furnished in cherry\r\nwood. It was decorated with strong-smelling flowers, and its high\r\nwindows afforded a view out across the open sea. He stepped up to one of\r\nthem after the employee had left; and while his luggage was being\r\nbrought up and placed in the room behind him, he looked down on the\r\nbeach (it was comparatively deserted in the afternoon) and on the\r\nsunless ocean which was at flood tide and was sending long low waves\r\nagainst the bank in a calm regular rhythm.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of a man who lives alone and in silence are both vaguer\r\nand more penetrating than those of people in society; his thoughts are\r\nheavier, more odd, and touched always with melancholy. Images and\r\nobservations which could easily be disposed of by a glance, a smile, an\r\nexchange of opinion, will occupy him unbearably, sink deep into the\r\nsilence, become full of meaning, become life, adventure, emotion.\r\nLoneliness ripens the eccentric, the daringly and estrangingly\r\nbeautiful, the poetic. But loneliness also ripens the perverse, the\r\ndisproportionate, the absurd, and the illicit.--So, the things he had\r\nmet with on the trip, the ugly old fop with his twaddle about\r\nsweethearts, the lawbreaking gondolier who was cheated of his pay, still\r\nleft the traveller uneasy. Without really providing any resistance to\r\nthe mind, without offering any solid stuff to think over, they were\r\nnevertheless profoundly strange, as it seemed to him, and disturbing\r\nprecisely because of this contradiction. In the meanwhile, he greeted\r\nthe sea with his eyes, and felt pleasure at the knowledge that Venice\r\nwas so conveniently near. Finally he turned away, bathed his face, left\r\norders to the chambermaid for a few things he still needed done to make\r\nhis comfort complete, and let himself be taken to the ground floor by\r\nthe green-uniformed Swiss who operated the lift.\r\n\r\nHe took his tea on the terrace facing the ocean, then descended and\r\nfollowed the boardwalk for quite a way in the direction of the Hotel\r\nExcelsior. When he returned it seemed time to dress for dinner. He did\r\nthis with his usual care and slowness, since he was accustomed to\r\nworking over his toilette. And yet he came down a little early to the\r\nlobby where he found a great many of the hotel guests assembled, mixing\r\ndistantly and with a show of mutual indifference to one another, but all\r\nwaiting for meal time. He took a paper from the table, dropped into a\r\nleather chair, and observed the company; they differed agreeably from\r\nthe guests where he had first stopped.\r\n\r\nA wide and tolerantly inclusive horizon was spread out before him.\r\nSounds of all the principal languages formed a subdued murmur. The\r\naccepted evening dress, a uniform of good manners, brought all human\r\nvarieties into a fitting unity. There were Americans with their long wry\r\nfeatures, large Russian families, English ladies, German children with\r\nFrench nurses. The Slavic element seemed to predominate. Polish was\r\nbeing spoken nearby.\r\n\r\nIt was a group of children gathered around a little wicker table, under\r\nthe protection of a teacher or governess: three young girls, apparently\r\nfifteen to seventeen, and a long-haired boy about fourteen years old.\r\nWith astonishment Aschenbach noted that the boy was absolutely\r\nbeautiful. His face, pale and reserved, framed with honey-coloured hair,\r\nthe straight sloping nose, the lovely mouth, the expression of sweet and\r\ngodlike seriousness, recalled Greek sculpture of the noblest period;\r\nand the complete purity of the forms was accompanied by such a rare\r\npersonal charm that, as he watched, he felt that he had never met with\r\nanything equally felicitous in nature or the plastic arts. He was\r\nfurther struck by the obviously intentional contrast with the principles\r\nof upbringing which showed in the sisters\' attire and bearing. The three\r\ngirls, the eldest of whom could be considered grown up, were dressed\r\nwith a chasteness and severity bordering on disfigurement. Uniformly\r\ncloister-like costumes, of medium length, slate-coloured, sober, and\r\ndeliberately unbecoming in cut, with white turned-down collars as the\r\nonly relief, suppressed every possible appeal of shapeliness. Their\r\nhair, brushed down flat and tight against the head, gave their faces a\r\nnunlike emptiness and lack of character. Surely this was a mother\'s\r\ninfluence, and it had not even occurred to her to apply the pedagogical\r\nstrictness to the boy which she seemed to find necessary for her girls.\r\nIt was clear that in his existence the first factors were gentleness and\r\ntenderness. The shears had been resolutely kept from his beautiful hair;\r\nlike a Prince Charming\'s, it fell in curls over his forehead, his ears,\r\nand still deeper, across his neck. The English sailor suit, with its\r\nbraids, stitchings, and embroideries, its puffy sleeves narrowing at the\r\nends and fitting snugly about the fine wrists of his still childish but\r\nslender hands, gave the delicate figure something rich and luxurious. He\r\nwas sitting, half profile to the observer, one foot in its black\r\npatent-leather shoe placed before the other, an elbow resting on the arm\r\nof his wicker chair, a cheek pressed against his fist, in a position of\r\nnegligent good manners, entirely free of the almost subservient\r\nstiffness to which his sisters seemed accustomed. Did he have some\r\nillness? For his skin stood out as white as ivory against the golden\r\ndarkness of the surrounding curls. Or was he simply a pampered favourite\r\nchild, made this way by a doting and moody love? Aschenbach inclined to\r\nbelieve the latter. Almost every artist is born with a rich and\r\ntreacherous tendency to recognize injustices which have created beauty,\r\nand to meet aristocratic distinction with sympathy and reverence.\r\n\r\nA waiter passed through and announced in English that the meal was\r\nready. Gradually the guests disappeared through the glass door into the\r\ndining hall. Stragglers crossed, coming from the entrance, or the lifts.\r\nInside, they had already begun serving, but the young Poles were still\r\nwaiting around the little wicker table; and Aschenbach, comfortably\r\npropped in his deep chair, and with this beauty before his eyes, stayed\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nThe governess, a small corpulent middle-class woman with a red face,\r\nfinally gave the sign to rise. With lifted brows, she pushed back her\r\nchair and bowed, as a large woman dressed in grey and richly jewelled\r\nwith pearls entered the lobby. This woman was advancing with coolness\r\nand precision; her lightly powdered hair and the lines of her dress were\r\narranged with the simplicity which always signifies taste in those\r\nquarters where devoutness is taken as one element of dignity. She might\r\nhave been the wife of some high German official. Except that her\r\njewellery added something fantastically lavish to her appearance;\r\nindeed, it was almost priceless, and consisted of ear pendants and a\r\nvery long triple chain of softly glowing pearls, as large as cherries.\r\n\r\nThe children had risen promptly. They bent over to kiss the hand of\r\ntheir mother who, with a distant smile on her well preserved though\r\nsomewhat tired and peaked features, looked over their heads and directed\r\na few words to the governess in French. Then she walked to the glass\r\ndoor. The children followed her: the girls in the order of their age,\r\nafter them the governess, the boy last. For some reason or other he\r\nturned around before crossing the sill, and since no one else was in the\r\nlobby his strange dusky eyes met those of Aschenbach who, his newspaper\r\non his knees, lost in thought, was gazing after the group.\r\n\r\nWhat he saw had not been unusual in the slightest detail. They had not\r\npreceded the mother to the table; they had waited, greeted her with\r\nrespect, and observed the customary forms on entering the room. But it\r\nhad taken place so pointedly, with such an accent of training, duty, and\r\nself-respect, that Aschenbach felt peculiarly touched by it all. He\r\ndelayed for a few moments, then he too crossed into the dining-room, and\r\nwas assigned to his table, which, as he noted with a brief touch of\r\nregret, was very far removed from that of the Polish family.\r\n\r\nWeary, and yet intellectually active, he entertained himself during the\r\nlengthy meal with abstract, or even transcendental things; he thought\r\nover the secret union which the lawful must enter upon with the\r\nindividual for human beauty to result, from this he passed into general\r\nproblems of form and art, and at the end he found that his thoughts and\r\ndiscoveries were like the seemingly felicitous promptings of a dream\r\nwhich, when the mind is sobered, are seen to be completely empty and\r\nunfit. After the meal, smoking, sitting, taking an occasional turn in\r\nthe park with its smell of nightfall, he went to bed early and spent the\r\nnight in a sleep deep and unbroken, but often enlivened with the\r\napparitions of dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII (continued)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather did not improve any the following day. A land breeze was\r\nblowing. Under a cloudy ashen sky, the sea lay in dull peacefulness; it\r\nseemed shrivelled up, with a close dreary horizon, and it had retreated\r\nfrom the beach, baring the long ribs of several sandbanks. As Aschenbach\r\nopened his window he thought that he could detect the foul smell of the\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\nHe felt depressed. He thought already of leaving. Once, years ago, after\r\nseveral weeks of spring here, this same weather had afflicted him, and\r\nimpaired his health so seriously that he had to abandon Venice like a\r\nfugitive. Was not this old feverish unrest again setting in, the\r\npressure in the temples, the heaviness of the eyelids? It would be\r\nannoying to change his residence still another time; but if the wind did\r\nnot turn, he could not stay here. To be safe, he did not unpack\r\ncompletely. He breakfasted at nine in the buffet-room provided for this\r\npurpose between the lobby and the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThat formal silence reigned here which is the ambition of large hotels.\r\nThe waiters who were serving walked about on soft soles. Nothing was\r\naudible but the tinkling of the tea-things, a word half-whispered. In\r\none corner, obliquely across from the door, and two tables removed from\r\nhis own, Aschenbach observed the Polish girls with their governess.\r\nErect and red-eyed, their ash-blond hair freshly smoothed down, dressed\r\nin stiff blue linen with little white cuffs and turned-down\r\ncollars--they were sitting there, handing around a glass of marmalade.\r\nThey had almost finished their breakfast. The boy was missing.\r\n\r\nAschenbach smiled. "Well, little Phaeacian!" he thought. "You seem to be\r\nenjoying the pleasant privilege of having your sleep out." And suddenly\r\nexhilarated, he recited to himself the line: "A frequent change of\r\ndress; warm baths, and rest."\r\n\r\nHe breakfasted without haste. From the porter, who entered the hall\r\nholding his braided cap in his hand, he received some forwarded mail;\r\nand while he smoked a cigarette he opened a few letters. In this way it\r\nhappened that he was present at the entrance of the late sleeper who was\r\nbeing waited for over yonder.\r\n\r\nHe came through the glass door and crossed the room in silence to his\r\nsisters\' table. His approach--the way he held the upper part of his\r\nbody, and bent his knees, the movement of his white-shod feet--had an\r\nextraordinary charm; he walked very lightly, at once timid and proud,\r\nand this became still more lovely through the childish embarrassment\r\nwith which, twice as he proceeded, he turned his face towards the centre\r\nof the room, raising and lowering his eyes. Smiling, with something\r\nhalf-muttered in his soft vague tongue, he took his place; and now, as\r\nhe turned his full profile to the observer, Aschenbach was again\r\nastonished, terrified even, by the really godlike beauty of this human\r\nchild. To-day the boy was wearing a light blouse of blue and white\r\nstriped cotton goods, with a red silk tie in front, and closed at the\r\nneck by a plain white high collar. This collar lacked the\r\ndistinctiveness of the blouse, but above it the flowering head was\r\npoised with an incomparable seductiveness--the head of an Eros, in\r\nblended yellows of Parian marble, with fine serious brows, the temples\r\nand ears covered softly by the abrupt encroachment of his curls.\r\n\r\n"Good, good!" Aschenbach thought, with that deliberate expert appraisal\r\nwhich artists sometimes employ as a subterfuge when they have been\r\ncarried away with delight before a masterwork. And he thought further:\r\n"Really, if the sea and the beach weren\'t waiting for me, I should stay\r\nhere as long as you stayed!" But he went then, passed through the lobby\r\nunder the inspection of the servants, down the wide terrace, and\r\nstraight across the boardwalk to the section of the beach reserved for\r\nthe hotel guests. The barefoot old man in dungarees and straw hat who\r\nwas functioning here as bathing master assigned him to the bath house he\r\nhad rented; a table and a seat were placed on the sandy board platform,\r\nand he made himself comfortable in the lounge chair which he had drawn\r\ncloser to the sea, out into the waxen yellow sand.\r\n\r\nMore than ever before he was entertained and amused by the sights on the\r\nbeach, this spectacle of carefree, civilized people getting sensuous\r\nenjoyment at the very edge of the elements. The grey flat sea was\r\nalready alive with wading children, swimmers, a motley of figures lying\r\non the sandbanks with arms bent behind their heads. Others were rowing\r\nabout in little red and blue striped boats without keels; they were\r\ncontinually upsetting, amid laughter. Before the long stretches of\r\nbathing houses, where people were sitting on the platforms as though on\r\nsmall verandahs, there was a play of movement against the line of rest\r\nand inertness behind--visits and chatter, fastidious morning elegance\r\nalongside the nakedness which, boldly at ease, was enjoying the freedom\r\nwhich the place afforded. Further in front, on the damp firm sand,\r\npeople were parading about in white bathing cloaks, in ample,\r\nbrilliantly coloured wrappers. An elaborate sand pile to the right,\r\nerected by children, had flags in the colours of all nations planted\r\naround it. Venders of shells, cakes, and fruit spread out their wares,\r\nkneeling. To the left, before one of the bathing houses which stood at\r\nright angles to the others and to the sea, a Russian family was\r\nencamped: men with beards and large teeth, slow delicate women, a Baltic\r\ngirl sitting by an easel and painting the sea amidst exclamations of\r\ndespair, two ugly good-natured children, an old maid-servant who wore a\r\nkerchief on her head and had the alert scraping manners of a slave.\r\nDelighted and appreciative, they were living there, patiently calling\r\nthe names of the two rowdy disobedient children, using their scanty\r\nItalian to joke with the humorous old man from whom they were buying\r\ncandy, kissing one another on the cheek, and not in the least concerned\r\nwith any one who might be observing their community.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I shall stay," Aschenbach thought. "Where would things be better?"\r\nAnd his hands folded in his lap, he let his eyes lose themselves in the\r\nexpanses of the sea, his gaze gliding, swimming, and failing in the\r\nmonotone mist of the wilderness of space. He loved the ocean for\r\ndeep-seated reasons: because of that yearning for rest, when the\r\nhard-pressed artist hungers to shut out the exacting multiplicities of\r\nexperience and hide himself on the breast of the simple, the vast; and\r\nbecause of a forbidden hankering--seductive, by virtue of its being\r\ndirectly opposed to his obligations--after the incommunicable, the\r\nincommensurate, the eternal, the non-existent. To be at rest in the face\r\nof perfection is the hunger of everyone who is aiming at excellence; and\r\nwhat is the non-existent but a form of perfection? But now, just as his\r\ndreams were so far out in vacancy, suddenly the horizontal fringe of the\r\nsea was broken by a human figure; and as he brought his eyes back from\r\nthe unbounded, and focussed them, it was the lovely boy who was there,\r\ncoming from the left and passing him on the sand. He was barefooted,\r\nready for wading, his slender legs exposed above the knees; he walked\r\nslowly, but as lightly and proudly as though it were the customary thing\r\nfor him to move about without shoes; and he was looking around him\r\ntowards the line of bathing houses opposite. But as soon as he had\r\nnoticed the Russian family, occupied with their own harmony and\r\ncontentment, a cloud of scorn and detestation passed over his face. His\r\nbrow darkened, his mouth was compressed, he gave his lips an embittered\r\ntwist to one side so that the cheek was distorted, and the forehead\r\nbecame so heavily furrowed that the eyes seemed sunken beneath its\r\npressure: malicious and glowering, they spoke the language of hate. He\r\nlooked down, looked back once more threateningly, then with his shoulder\r\nmade an abrupt gesture of disdain and dismissal, and left the enemy\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nA kind of pudency or confusion, something like respect and shyness,\r\ncaused Aschenbach to turn away as though he had seen nothing. For the\r\nearnest-minded who have been casual observers of some passion, struggle\r\nagainst making use, even to themselves, of what they have seen. But he\r\nwas both cheered and unstrung--which is to say, he was happy. This\r\nchildish fanaticism, directed against the most good-natured possible\r\naspect of life--it brought the divinely arbitrary into human\r\nrelationships; it made a delightful natural picture which had appealed\r\nonly to the eye now seem worthy of a deeper sympathy; and it gave the\r\nfigure of this half-grown boy, who had already been important enough by\r\nhis sheer beauty, something to offset him still further, and to make one\r\ntake him more seriously than his years justified. Still looking away,\r\nAschenbach could hear the boy\'s voice, the shrill, somewhat weak voice\r\nwith which, in the distance now, he was trying to call hello to his\r\nplayfellows busied around the sand pile. They answered him, shouting\r\nback his name, or some affectionate nickname; and Aschenbach listened\r\nwith a certain curiosity, without being able to catch anything more\r\ndefinite than two melodic syllables like "Adgio," or still more\r\nfrequently "Adgiu," with a ringing u-sound prolonged at the end. He was\r\npleased with the resonance of this; he found it adequate to the subject.\r\nHe repeated it silently and, satisfied, turned to his letters and\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\nHis small portable writing-desk on his knees he began writing with his\r\nfountain pen an answer to this or that bit of correspondence. But after\r\nthe first fifteen minutes he found it a pity to abandon the\r\nsituation--the most enjoyable he could think of--in this manner and\r\nwaste it in activities which did not interest him. He tossed the writing\r\nmaterials to one side, and he faced the ocean again; soon afterwards,\r\ndiverted by the childish voices around the sand heap, he revolved his\r\nhead comfortably along the back of the chair towards the right, to\r\ndiscover where that excellent little Adgio might be and what he was\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nHe was found at a glance; the red tie on his breast was not to be\r\noverlooked. Busied with the others in laying an old plank across the\r\ndamp moat of the sand castle, he was nodding, and shouting instructions\r\nfor this work. There were about ten companions with him, boys and girls\r\nof his age, and a few younger ones who were chattering with one another\r\nin Polish, French, and in several Balkan tongues. But it was his name\r\nwhich rang out most often. He was openly in demand, sought after,\r\nadmired. One boy especially, like him a Pole, a stocky fellow who was\r\ncalled something like "Jaschu," with sleek black hair and a belted linen\r\ncoat, seemed to be his closest vassal and friend. When the work on the\r\nsand structure was finished for the time being, they walked aim in arm\r\nalong the beach, and the boy who was called "Jaschu" kissed the beauty.\r\n\r\nAschenbach was half minded to raise a warning finger. "I advise you,\r\nCristobulus," he thought, smiling, "to travel for a year! For you need\r\nthat much time at least to get over it." And then he breakfasted on\r\nlarge ripe strawberries which he got from a peddler. It had become very\r\nwarm, although the sun could no longer penetrate the blanket of mist in\r\nthe sky. Laziness clogged his brain, even while his senses delighted in\r\nthe numbing, drugging distractions of the ocean\'s stillness. To guess,\r\nto puzzle out just what name it was that sounded something like "Adgio,"\r\nseemed to the sober man an appropriate ambition, a thoroughly\r\ncomprehensive pursuit. And with the aid of a few scrappy recollections\r\nof Polish he decided that they must mean Tadzio, the shortened form of\r\nTadeusz, and sounding like Tadziu when it is called.\r\n\r\nTadzio was bathing. Aschenbach, who had lost sight of him, spied his\r\nhead and the arm with which he was propelling himself, far out in the\r\nwater; for the sea must have been smooth for a long distance out. But\r\nalready people seemed worried about him; women\'s voices were calling\r\nafter him from the bathing houses, uttering this name again and again.\r\nIt almost dominated the beach like a battle-cry, and with its soft\r\nconsonants, its long drawn u-note at the end, it had something at once\r\nsweet and wild about it: "Tadziu! Tadziu!" He turned back; beating the\r\nresistent water into a foam with his legs he hurried, his head bent down\r\nover the waves. And to see how this living figure, graceful and\r\nclean-cut in its advance, with dripping curls, and lovely as some frail\r\ngod, came up out of the depths of sky and sea, rose and separated from\r\nthe elements--this spectacle aroused a sense of myth, it was like some\r\npoet\'s recovery of time at its beginning, of the origin of forms and the\r\nbirth of gods. Aschenbach listened with closed eyes to this song ringing\r\nwithin him, and he thought again that it was pleasant here, and that he\r\nwould like to remain.\r\n\r\nLater Tadzio was resting from his bath; he lay in the sand, wrapped in\r\nhis white robe, which was drawn under the right shoulder, his head\r\nsupported on his bare arm. And even when Aschenbach was not observing\r\nhim, but was reading a few pages in his book, he hardly ever forgot that\r\nthis boy was lying there and that it would cost him only a slight turn\r\nof his head to the right to behold the mystery. It seemed that he was\r\nsitting here just to keep watch over his repose--busied with his own\r\nconcerns, and yet constantly aware of this noble picture at his right,\r\nnot far in the distance. And he was stirred by a paternal affection, the\r\nprofound leaning which those who have devoted their thoughts to the\r\ncreation of beauty feel towards those who possess beauty itself.\r\n\r\nA little past noon he left the beach, returned to the hotel, and was\r\ntaken up to his room. He stayed there for some time in front of the\r\nmirror, looking at his grey hair, his tired sharp features. At this\r\nmoment he thought of his reputation, and of the fact that he was often\r\nrecognized on the streets and observed with respect, thanks to the sure\r\naim and the appealing finish of his words. He called up all the exterior\r\nsuccesses of his talent which he could think of, remembering also his\r\nelevation to the knighthood. Then he went down to the dining-hall for\r\nlunch, and ate at his little table. As he was riding up in the lift,\r\nafter the meal was ended, a group of young people just coming from\r\nbreakfast pressed into the swaying cage after him, and Tadzio entered\r\ntoo. He stood quite near to Aschenbach, for the first time so near that\r\nAschenbach could see him, not with the aloofness of a picture, but in\r\nminute detail, in all his human particularities. The boy was addressed\r\nby someone or other, and as he was answering with an indescribably\r\nagreeable smile he stepped out again, on the second floor, walking\r\nbackwards, and with his eyes lowered. "Beauty makes modest," Aschenbach\r\nthought, and he tried insistently to explain why this was so. But he had\r\nnoticed that Tadzio\'s teeth were not all they should be; they were\r\nsomewhat jagged and pale. The enamel did not look healthy; it had a\r\npeculiar brittleness and transparency, as is often the case with\r\nanaemics. "He is very frail, he is sickly," Aschenbach thought. "In all\r\nprobability he will not grow old." And he refused to reckon with the\r\nfeeling of gratification or reassurance which accompanied this notion.\r\n\r\nHe spent two hours in his room, and in the afternoon he rode in the\r\n_vaporetto_ across the foul-smelling lagoon to Venice. He got off at San\r\nMarco, took tea on the Piazza, and then, in accord with his schedule for\r\nthe day, he went for a walk through the streets. Yet it was this walk\r\nwhich produced a complete reversal in his attitudes and his plans.\r\n\r\nAn offensive sultriness lay over the streets. The air was so heavy that\r\nthe smells pouring out of homes, stores, and eating houses became mixed\r\nwith oil, vapours, clouds of perfume, and still other odours--and these\r\nwould not blow away, but hung in layers. Cigarette smoke remained\r\nsuspended, disappearing very slowly. The crush of people along the\r\nnarrow streets irritated rather than entertained the walker. The farther\r\nhe went, the more he was depressed by the repulsive condition resulting\r\nfrom the combination of sea air and sirocco, which was at the same time\r\nboth stimulating and enervating. He broke into an uncomfortable sweat.\r\nHis eyes failed him, his chest became tight, he had a fever, the blood\r\nwas pounding in his head. He fled from the crowded business streets\r\nacross a bridge into the walks of the poor. On a quiet square, one of\r\nthose forgotten and enchanting places which lie in the interior of\r\nVenice, he rested at the brink of a well, dried his forehead, and\r\nrealized that he would have to leave here.\r\n\r\nFor the second and last time it had been demonstrated that this city in\r\nthis kind of weather was decidedly unhealthy for him. It seemed foolish\r\nto attempt a stubborn resistance, while the prospects for a change of\r\nwind were completely uncertain. A quick decision was called for. It was\r\nnot possible to go home this soon. Neither summer nor winter quarters\r\nwere prepared to receive him. But this was not the only place where\r\nthere were sea and beach; and elsewhere these could be found without the\r\nlagoon and its malarial mists. He remembered a little watering place not\r\nfar from Trieste which had been praised to him. Why not there? And\r\nwithout delay, so that this new change of location would still have time\r\nto do him some good. He pronounced this as good as settled, and stood\r\nup. At the next gondola station he took a boat back to San Marco, and\r\nwas led through the dreary labyrinth of canals, under fancy marble\r\nbalconies flanked with lions, around the corners of smooth walls, past\r\nthe sorrowing fa\xc3\xa7ades of palaces which mirrored large dilapidated\r\nbusiness-signs in the pulsing water. He had trouble arriving there, for\r\nthe gondolier, who was in league with lace-makers and glass-blowers, was\r\nalways trying to land him for inspections and purchases; and just as the\r\nbizarre trip through Venice would begin to cast its spell, the greedy\r\nbusiness sense of the sunken Queen did all it could to destroy the\r\nillusion.\r\n\r\nWhen he had returned to the hotel he announced at the office before\r\ndinner that unforeseen developments necessitated his departure the\r\nfollowing morning. He was assured of their regrets. He settled his\r\naccounts. He dined, and spent the warm evening reading the newspapers in\r\na rocking-chair on the rear terrace. Before going to bed he got his\r\nluggage all ready for departure.\r\n\r\nHe did not sleep so well as he might, since the impending break-up made\r\nhim restless. When he opened the window in the morning the sky was as\r\novercast as ever, but the air seemed fresher, and he was already\r\nbeginning to repent. Hadn\'t his decision been somewhat hasty and\r\nuncalled for, the result of a passing diffidence and indisposition? If\r\nhe had delayed a little, if, instead of surrendering so easily, he had\r\nmade some attempt to adjust himself to the air of Venice or to wait for\r\nan improvement in the weather, he would not be so rushed and\r\ninconvenienced, but could anticipate another forenoon on the beach like\r\nyesterday\'s. Too late. Now he would have to go on wanting what he had\r\nwanted yesterday. He dressed, and at about eight o\'clock rode down to\r\nthe ground floor for breakfast.\r\n\r\nAs he entered, the buffet-room was still empty of guests. A few came in\r\nwhile he sat waiting for his order. With his tea cup to his lips, he saw\r\nthe Polish girls and their governess appear: rigid, with morning\r\nfreshness, their eyes still red, they walked across to their table in\r\nthe corner by the window. Immediately afterwards, the porter approached\r\nhim, cap in hand, and warned him that it was time to go. The automobile\r\nis ready to take him and the other passengers to the Hotel Excelsior,\r\nand from here the motorboat will bring the ladies and gentlemen\r\nto the station through the company\'s private canal. Time is\r\npressing.--Aschenbach found that it was doing nothing of the sort. It\r\nwas still over an hour before his train left. He was irritated by this\r\nhotel custom of hustling departing guests out of the house, and\r\nindicated to the porter that he wished to finish his breakfast in peace.\r\nThe man retired hesitatingly, to appear again five minutes later. It is\r\nimpossible for the car to wait any longer. Then he would take a cab, and\r\ncarry his trunk with him, Aschenbach replied in anger. He would use the\r\npublic steamboat at the proper time, and he requested that it be left to\r\nhim personally to worry about his departure. The employee bowed himself\r\naway. Pleased with the way he had warded off these importunate warnings,\r\nAschenbach finished his meal at leisure; in fact, he even let the waiter\r\nbring him a newspaper. The time had become quite short when he finally\r\narose. It was fitting that at the same moment Tadzio should come through\r\nthe glass door.\r\n\r\nOn the way to his table he walked in the opposite direction to\r\nAschenbach, lowering his eyes modestly before the man with the grey hair\r\nand high forehead, only to raise them again, in his delicious manner,\r\nsoft and full upon him--and he had passed. "Good-bye, Tadzio!"\r\nAschenbach thought. "I did not see much of you." He did what was unusual\r\nwith him, really formed the words on his lips and spoke them to himself;\r\nthen he added, "God bless you!"--After this he left, distributed tips,\r\nwas ushered out by the small gentle manager in the French frock coat,\r\nand made off from the hotel on foot, as he had come, going along the\r\nwhite blossoming avenue which crossed the island to the steamer bridge,\r\naccompanied by the house servant carrying his hand luggage. He arrived,\r\ntook his place--and then followed a painful journey through all the\r\ndepths of regret.\r\n\r\nIt was the familiar trip across the lagoon, past San Marco, up the Grand\r\nCanal. Aschenbach sat on the circular bench at the bow, his arm\r\nsupported against the railing, shading his eyes with his hand. The\r\npublic gardens were left behind, the Piazzetta opened up once more in\r\nprincely splendour and was gone, then came the great flock of palaces,\r\nand as the channel made a turn the magnificently slung marble arch of\r\nthe Rialto came into view. The traveller was watching; his emotions were\r\nin conflict. The atmosphere of the city, this slightly foul smell of sea\r\nand swamp which he had been so anxious to avoid--he breathed it now in\r\ndeep, exquisitely painful draughts. Was it possible that he had not\r\nknown, had not considered, just how much he was attached to all this?\r\nWhat had been a partial misgiving this morning, a faint doubt as to the\r\nadvisability of his move, now became a distress, a positive misery, a\r\nspiritual hunger, and so bitter that it frequently brought tears to his\r\neyes, while he told himself that he could not possibly have foreseen it.\r\nHardest of all to bear, at times completely insufferable, was the\r\nthought that he would never see Venice again, that this was a\r\nleave-taking for ever. Since it had been shown for the second time that\r\nthe city affected his health, since he was compelled for the second time\r\nto get away in all haste, from now on he would have to consider it a\r\nplace impossible and forbidden to him, a place which he was not equal\r\nto, and which it would be foolish for him to visit again. Yes, he felt\r\nthat if he left now, he would be shamefaced and defiant enough never to\r\nsee again the beloved city which had twice caused him a physical\r\nbreak-down. And of a sudden this struggle between his desires and his\r\nphysical strength seemed to the aging man so grave and important, his\r\nphysical defeat seemed so dishonourable, so much a challenge to hold out\r\nat any cost, that he could not understand the ready submissiveness of\r\nthe day before, when he had decided to give in without attempting any\r\nserious resistance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the steamboat was nearing the station; pain and perplexity\r\nincreased, he became distracted. In his affliction, he felt that it was\r\nimpossible to leave, and just as impossible to turn back. The conflict\r\nwas intense as he entered the station. It was very late; there was not a\r\nmoment to lose if he was to catch the train. He wanted to, and he did\r\nnot want to. But time was pressing; it drove him on. He hurried to get\r\nhis ticket, and looked about in the tumult of the hall for the officer\r\non duty here from the hotel. The man appeared and announced that the\r\nlarge trunk had been transferred. Transferred already? Yes, thank\r\nyou--to Como. To Como? And in the midst of hasty running back and forth,\r\nangry questions and confused answers, it came to light that the trunk\r\nhad already been sent with other foreign baggage from the express office\r\nof the Hotel Excelsior in a completely wrong direction.\r\n\r\nAschenbach had difficulty in preserving the expression which was\r\nrequired under these circumstances. He was almost convulsed with an\r\nadventurous delight, an unbelievable hilarity. The employee rushed off\r\nto see if it were still possible to stop the trunk, and as was to be\r\nexpected he returned with nothing accomplished. Aschenbach declared that\r\nhe did not want to travel without his trunk, but had decided to go back\r\nand wait at the beach hotel for its return. Was the company\'s motorboat\r\nstill at the station? The man assured him that it was lying at the door.\r\nWith Italian volubility he persuaded the clerk at the ticket window to\r\nredeem the cancelled ticket, he swore that they would act speedily, that\r\nno time or money would be spared in recovering the trunk promptly,\r\nand--so the strange thing happened that, twenty minutes after his\r\narrival at the station, the traveller found himself again on the Grand\r\nCanal, returning to the Lido.\r\n\r\nHere was an adventure, wonderful, abashing, and comically dreamlike\r\nbeyond belief: places which he had just bid farewell to for ever in the\r\nmost abject misery--yet he had been turned and driven back by fate, and\r\nwas seeing them again in the same hour! The spray from the bow, washing\r\nbetween gondolas and steamers with an absurd agility, shot the speedy\r\nlittle craft ahead to its goal, while the one passenger was hiding the\r\nnervousness and ebullience of a truant boy under the mask of resigned\r\nanger. From time to time he shook with laughter at this mishap which, as\r\nhe told himself, could not have turned out better for a child of\r\ndestiny. There were explanations to be given, expressions of\r\nastonishment to be faced--and then, he told himself, everything would be\r\nall right; then a misfortune would be avoided, a grave error rectified.\r\nAnd all that he had thought he was leaving behind him would be open to\r\nhim again, there at his disposal. . . . And to cap it all, was the\r\nrapidity of the ride deceiving him, or was the wind really coming from\r\nthe sea?\r\n\r\nThe waves beat against the walls of the narrow canal which runs through\r\nthe island to the Hotel Excelsior. An automobile omnibus was awaiting\r\nhis return there, and took him above the rippling sea straight to the\r\nbeach hotel. The little manager with moustache and long-tailed frock\r\ncoat came down the stairs to meet him.\r\n\r\nHe ingratiatingly regretted the episode, spoke of it as highly painful\r\nto him and the establishment, but firmly approved of Aschenbach\'s\r\ndecision to wait here for the baggage. Of course his room had been given\r\nup, but there was another one, just as good, which he could occupy\r\nimmediately. "_Pas de chance, Monsieur_," the Swiss elevator boy smiled\r\nas they were ascending. And so the fugitive was established again, in a\r\nroom almost identical to the other in its location and furnishings.\r\n\r\nTired out by the confusion of this strange forenoon, he distributed the\r\ncontents of his hand-bag about the room and dropped into an arm-chair by\r\nthe open window. The sea had become a pale green, the air seemed thinner\r\nand purer; the beach, with its cabins and boats, seemed to have colour,\r\nalthough the sky was still grey. Aschenbach looked out, his hands folded\r\nin his lap; he was content to be back, but shook his head disapprovingly\r\nat his irresolution, his failure to know his own mind. He sat here for\r\nthe better part of an hour, resting and dreaming vaguely. About noon he\r\nsaw Tadzio in a striped linen suit with a red tie, coming back from the\r\nsea across the private beach and along the boardwalk to the hotel.\r\nAschenbach recognized him from this altitude before he had actually set\r\neyes on him; he was about to think some such words as "Well, Tadzio,\r\nthere you are again!" but at the same moment he felt this careless\r\ngreeting go dumb before the truth in his heart. He felt the exhilaration\r\nof his blood, a conflict of pain and pleasure, and he realized that it\r\nwas Tadzio who had made it so difficult for him to leave.\r\n\r\nHe sat very still, entirely unobserved from this height, and looked\r\nwithin himself. His features were alert, his eyebrows raised, and an\r\nattentive, keenly inquisitive smile distended his mouth. Then he raised\r\nhis head; lifted both hands, which had hung relaxed over the arms of the\r\nchair, and in a slow twisting movement turned the palms downward--as\r\nthough to suggest an opening and spreading outward of his arms. It was a\r\nspontaneous act of welcome, of calm acceptance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nDay after day now the naked god with the hot cheeks drove his\r\nfire-breathing quadriga across the expanses of the sky, and his yellow\r\nlocks fluttered in the assault of the east wind. A white silk sheen\r\nstretched over the slowly simmering Ponto. The sand glowed. Beneath the\r\nquaking silver blue of the ether rust-coloured canvasses were spread in\r\nfront of the beach bathing houses, and the afternoons were spent in the\r\nsharply demarcated spots of shade which they cast. But it was also\r\ndelightful in the evening, when the vegetation in the park had the smell\r\nof balsam, and the stars were working through their courses above, and\r\nthe soft persistent murmur of the sea came up enchantingly through the\r\nnight. Such evenings contained the cheering promise that more sunny days\r\nof casual idleness would follow, dotted with countless closely\r\ninterspersed possibilities of well-timed accidents.\r\n\r\nThe guest who was detained here by such an accommodating mishap did not\r\nconsider the return of his property as sufficient grounds for another\r\ndeparture. He suffered some inconvenience for two days, and had to\r\nappear for meals in the large dining-room in his travelling clothes.\r\nWhen the strayed luggage was finally deposited in his room again, he\r\nunpacked completely and filled the closet and drawers with his\r\nbelongings; he had decided to remain here indefinitely, content now that\r\nhe could pass the hours on the beach in a silk suit and appear for\r\ndinner at his little table again in appropriate evening dress.\r\n\r\nThe comfortable rhythm of this life had already cast its spell over him;\r\nhe was soon enticed by the ease, the mild splendour, of his programme.\r\nIndeed, what a place to be in, when the usual allurement of living in\r\nwatering places on southern shores was coupled with the immediate\r\nnearness of the most wonderful of all cities! Aschenbach was not a lover\r\nof pleasure. Whenever that was some call for him to take a holiday, to\r\nindulge himself, to have a good time--and this was especially true at an\r\nearlier age--restlessness and repugnance soon drove him back to his\r\nrigorous toil, the faithful sober efforts of his daily routine. Except\r\nthat this place was bewitching him, relaxing his will, making him happy.\r\nIn the mornings, under the shelter of his bathing house, letting his\r\neyes roam dreamily in the blue of the southern sea; or on a warm night\r\nas he leaned back against the cushions of the gondola carrying him under\r\nthe broad starry sky home to the Lido from the Piazza di San Marco after\r\nlong hours of idleness--and the brilliant lights, the melting notes of\r\nthe serenade were being left behind--he often recalled his place in the\r\nmountains, the scene of his battles in the summer, where the clouds blew\r\nlow across his garden, and terrifying storms put out the lamps at night,\r\nand the crows which he fed were swinging in the tops of the pine trees.\r\nThen everything seemed just right to him, as though he were lifted into\r\nthe Elysian fields, on the borders of the earth, where man enjoys the\r\neasiest life, where there is no snow or winter, nor storms and pouring\r\nrains, but where Oceanus continually sends forth gentle cooling breezes,\r\nand the days pass in a blessed inactivity, without work, without effort,\r\ndevoted wholly to the sun and to the feast days of the sun.\r\n\r\nAschenbach saw the boy Tadzio frequently, almost constantly. Owing to\r\nthe limited range of territory and the regularity of their lives, the\r\nbeauty was near him at short intervals throughout the day. He saw him,\r\nmet him, everywhere: in the lower rooms of the hotel, on the cooling\r\nwater trips to the city and back, in the arcades of the square, and at\r\ntimes when he was especially lucky ran across him on the streets. But\r\nprincipally, and with the most gratifying regularity, the forenoon on\r\nthe beach allowed him to admire and study this rare spectacle at his\r\nleisure. Yes, it was this guaranty of happiness, this daily recurrence\r\nof good fortune, which made his stay here so precious, and gave him such\r\npleasure in the constant procession of sunny days.\r\n\r\nHe was up as early as he used to be when under the driving pressure of\r\nwork, and was on the beach before most people, when the sun was still\r\nmild and the sea lay blinding white in the dreaminess of morning. He\r\nspoke amiably to the guard of the private beach, and also spoke\r\nfamiliarly to the barefoot, white-bearded old man who had prepared his\r\nplace for him, stretching the brown canopy and bringing the furniture of\r\nthe cabin out on the platform. Then he took his seat. There would now be\r\nthree or four hours in which the sun mounted and gained terrific\r\nstrength, the sea a deeper and deeper blue, and he might look at Tadzio.\r\n\r\nHe saw him approaching from the left, along the edge of the sea; he saw\r\nhim as he stepped out backwards from among the cabins; or he would\r\nsuddenly find, with a shock of pleasure, that he had missed his coming,\r\nthat he was already here in the blue and white bathing suit which was\r\nhis only garment now while on the beach, that he had already commenced\r\nhis usual activities in the sun and the sand--a pleasantly trifling,\r\nidle, and unstable manner of living, a mixture of rest and play. Tadzio\r\nwould saunter about, wade, dig, catch things, lie down, go for a swim,\r\nall the while being kept under surveillance by the women on the platform\r\nwho made his name ring out in their falsetto voices: "Tadziu! Tadziu!"\r\nThen he would come running to them with a look of eagerness, to tell\r\nthem what he had seen, what he had experienced, or to show them what he\r\nhad found or caught: mussels, sea-horses, jelly-fish, and crabs that ran\r\nsideways. Aschenbach did not understand a word he said, and though it\r\nmight have been the most ordinary thing in the world, it was a vague\r\nharmony in his ear. So the foreignness of the boy\'s speech turned it\r\ninto music, a wanton sun poured its prodigal splendour down over him,\r\nand his figure was always set off against the background of an intense\r\nsea-blue.\r\n\r\nThis piquant body was so freely exhibited that his eyes soon knew every\r\nline and posture. He was continually rediscovering with new pleasure all\r\nthis familiar beauty, and his astonishment at its delicate appeal to his\r\nsenses was unending. The boy was called to greet a guest who was paying\r\nhis respects to the ladies at the bathing house. He came running,\r\nrunning wet perhaps out of the water, tossed back his curls, and as he\r\nheld out his hand, resting on one leg and raising his other foot on the\r\ntoes, the set of his body was delightful; it had a charming expectancy\r\nabout it, a well-meaning shyness, a winsomeness which showed his\r\naristocratic training. . . . He lay stretched full length, his bath\r\ntowel slung across his shoulders, his delicately chiselled arm supported\r\nin the sand, his chin in his palm; the boy called Jaschu was squatting\r\nnear him and making up to him--and nothing could be more enchanting than\r\nthe smile of his eyes and lips when the leader glanced up at his\r\ninferior, his servant. . . . He stood on the edge of the sea, alone,\r\napart from his people, quite near to Aschenbach--erect, his hands locked\r\nacross the back of his neck, he swayed slowly on the balls of his feet,\r\nlooked dreamily into the blueness of sea and sky, while tiny waves\r\nrolled up and bathed his feet. His honey-coloured hair clung in rings\r\nabout his neck and temples. The sun made the down on his back glitter;\r\nthe fine etching of the ribs, the symmetry of the chest, were emphasized\r\nby the tightness of the suit across the buttocks. His arm-pits were\r\nstill as smooth as those of a statue; the hollows of his knees\r\nglistened, and their bluish veins made his body seem built of some\r\nclearer stuff. What rigour, what precision of thought, were expressed in\r\nthis erect, youthfully perfect body! Yet the pure and strenuous will\r\nwhich, darkly at work, could bring such godlike sculpture to the\r\nlight--was not he, the artist, familiar with this? Did it not operate in\r\nhim too when he, under the press of frugal passions, would free from the\r\nmarble mass of speech some slender form which he had seen in the mind\r\nand which he put before his fellows as a statue and a mirror of\r\nintellectual beauty?\r\n\r\nStatue and mirror! His eyes took in the noble form there bordered with\r\nblue; and with a rush of enthusiasm he felt that in this spectacle he\r\nwas catching the beautiful itself, form as the thought of God, the one\r\npure perfection which lives in the mind, and which, in this symbol and\r\nlikeness, had been placed here quietly and simply as an object of\r\ndevotion. That was drunkenness; and eagerly, without thinking, the aging\r\nartist welcomed it. His mind was in travail; all that he had learned,\r\ndropped back into flux; his understanding threw up age-old thoughts\r\nwhich he had inherited with youth though they had never before lived\r\nwith their own fire. Is it not written that the sun diverts our\r\nattention from intellectual to sensual things? Reason and understanding,\r\nit is said, become so numbed and enchanted that the soul forgets\r\neverything out of delight with its immediate circumstances, and in\r\nastonishment becomes attached to the most beautiful object shined on by\r\nthe sun; indeed, only with the aid of a body is it capable then of\r\nraising itself to higher considerations. To be sure, Amor did as the\r\ninstructors of mathematics who show backward children tangible\r\nrepresentations of the pure forms--similarly the god, in order to make\r\nthe spiritual visible for us, readily utilized the form and colour of\r\nman\'s youth, and as a reminder he adorned these with the reflected\r\nsplendour of beauty which, when we behold it, makes us flare up in pain\r\nand hope.\r\n\r\nHis enthusiasm suggested these things, put him in the mood for them. And\r\nfrom the noise of the sea and the lustre of the sun he wove himself a\r\ncharming picture. Here was the old plane-tree, not far from the walls of\r\nAthens--a holy, shadowy place filled with the smell of _agnus castus_\r\nblossoms and decorated with ornaments and images sacred to Achelous and\r\nthe Nymphs. Clear and pure, the brook at the foot of the spreading tree\r\nfell across the smooth pebbles; the cicadas were fiddling. But on the\r\ngrass, which was like a pillow gently sloping to the head, two people\r\nwere stretched out, in hiding from the heat of the day: an older man and\r\na youth, one ugly and one beautiful, wisdom next to loveliness. And amid\r\ngallantries and skilfully engaging banter, Socrates was instructing\r\nPhaedrus in matters of desire and virtue. He spoke to him of the hot\r\nterror which the initiate suffer when their eyes light on an image of\r\nthe eternal beauty; spoke of the greed of the impious and the wicked who\r\ncannot think beauty when they see its likeness, and who are incapable of\r\nreverence; spoke of the holy distress which befalls the noble-minded\r\nwhen a godlike countenance, a perfect body, appears before them; they\r\ntremble and grow distracted, and hardly dare to raise their eyes, and\r\nthey honour the man who possesses this beauty, yes, if they were not\r\nafraid of being thought downright madmen they would sacrifice to the\r\nbeloved as to the image of a god. For beauty, my Phaedrus, beauty alone\r\nis both lovely and visible at once; it is, mark me, the only form of the\r\nspiritual which we can receive through the senses. Else what would\r\nbecome of us if the divine, if reason and virtue and truth, should\r\nappear to us through the senses? Should we not perish and be consumed\r\nwith love, as Semele once was with Zeus? Thus, beauty is the sensitive\r\nman\'s access to the spirit--but only a road, a means simply, little\r\nPhaedrus. . . . And then this crafty suitor made the neatest remark of\r\nall; it was this, that the lover is more divine than the beloved, since\r\nthe god is in the one, but not in the other--perhaps the most delicate,\r\nthe most derisive thought which has ever been framed, and the one from\r\nwhich spring all the cunning and the profoundest pleasures of desire.\r\n\r\nWriters are happiest with an idea which can become all emotion, and an\r\nemotion all idea. Just such a pulsating idea, such a precise emotion,\r\nbelonged to the lonely man at this moment, was at his call. Nature, it\r\nran, shivers with ecstasy when the spirit bows in homage before beauty.\r\nSuddenly he wanted to write. Eros loves idleness, they say, and he is\r\nsuited only to idleness. But at this point in the crisis the affliction\r\nbecame a stimulus towards productivity. The incentive hardly mattered. A\r\nrequest, an agitation for an open statement on a certain large burning\r\nissue of culture and taste, was going about the intellectual world, and\r\nhad finally caught up with the traveller here. He was familiar with the\r\nsubject, it had touched his own experience; and suddenly he felt an\r\nirresistible desire to display it in the light of his own version. And\r\nhe even went so far as to prefer working in Tadzio\'s presence, taking\r\nthe scope of the boy as a standard for his writing, making his style\r\nfollow the lines of this body which seemed godlike to him, and carrying\r\nhis beauty over into the spiritual just as the eagle once carried the\r\nTrojan stag up into the ether. Never had his joy in words been more\r\nsweet. He had never been so aware that Eros is in the word as during\r\nthose perilously precious hours when, at his crude table under the\r\ncanopy, facing the idol and listening to the music of his voice, he\r\nfollowed Tadzio\'s beauty in the forming of his little tract, a page and\r\na half of choice prose which was soon to excite the admiration of many\r\nthrough its clarity, its poise, and the vigorous curve of its emotion.\r\nCertainly it is better for people to know only the beautiful product as\r\nfinished, and not in its conception, its conditions of origin. For\r\nknowledge of the sources from which the artist derives his inspiration\r\nwould often confuse and alienate, and in this way detract from the\r\neffects of his mastery. Strange hours! Strangely enervating efforts!\r\nRare creative intercourse between the spirit and a body! When Aschenbach\r\nput away his work and started back from the beach be felt exhausted, or\r\nin dispersion even; and it was as though his conscience were complaining\r\nafter some transgression.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, as he was about to leave the hotel, he looked off\r\nfrom the steps and noticed that Tadzio, who was alone and was already on\r\nhis way towards the sea, was just approaching the private beach. He was\r\nhalf tempted by the simple notion of seizing this opportunity to strike\r\nup a casual friendly acquaintanceship with the boy who had been the\r\nunconscious source of so much agitation and upheaval; he wanted to\r\naddress him, and enjoy the answering look in his eyes. The boy was\r\nsauntering along, he could be overtaken; and Aschenbach quickened his\r\npace. He reached him on the boardwalk behind the bathing houses; was\r\nabout to lay a hand on his head and shoulders; and some word or other,\r\nan amiable phrase in French, was on the tip of his tongue. But he felt\r\nthat his heart, due also perhaps to his rapid stride, was beating like a\r\nhammer; and he was so short of breath that his voice would have been\r\ntight and trembling. He hesitated, he tried to get himself under\r\ncontrol. Suddenly he became afraid that he had been walking too long so\r\nclose behind the boy. He was afraid of arousing curiosity and causing\r\nhim to look back questioningly. He made one more spurt, failed,\r\nsurrendered, and passed with bowed head.\r\n\r\n"Too late!" he thought immediately. Too late! Yet was it too late? This\r\nstep which he had just been on the verge of taking would very possibly\r\nhave put things on a sound, free and easy basis, and would have restored\r\nhim to wholesome soberness. But the fact was that Aschenbach did not\r\nwant soberness: his intoxication was too precious. Who can explain the\r\nstamp and the nature of the artist! Who can understand this deep\r\ninstinctive welding of discipline and licence? For to be unable to want\r\nwholesome soberness, is licence. Aschenbach was no longer given to\r\nself-criticism. His tastes, the mental caliber of his years, his\r\nself-respect, ripeness, and a belated simplicity made him unwilling to\r\ndismember his motives and to debate whether his impulses were the result\r\nof conscientiousness or of dissolution and weakness. He was embarrassed,\r\nas he feared that someone or other, if only the guard on the beach, must\r\nhave observed his pursuit and defeat. He was very much afraid of the\r\nridiculous. Further, he joked with himself about his comically pious\r\ndistress. "Downed," he thought, "downed like a rooster, with his wings\r\nhanging miserably in the battle. It really is a god who can, at one\r\nsight of his loveliness, break our courage this way and force down our\r\npride so thoroughly. . . ." He toyed and skirmished with his emotions,\r\nand was far too haughty to be afraid of them.\r\n\r\nHe had already ceased thinking about the time when the vacation period\r\nwhich he had fixed for himself would expire; the thought of going home\r\nnever even suggested itself. He had sent for an ample supply of money.\r\nHis only concern was with the possible departure of the Polish family;\r\nby a casual questioning of the hotel barber he had contrived to learn\r\nthat these people had come here only a short time before his own\r\narrival. The sun browned his face and hands, the invigorating salt\r\nbreezes made him feel fresher. Once he had been in the habit of\r\nexpending on his work every bit of nourishment which food, sleep, or\r\nnature could provide him; and similarly now he was generous and\r\nuneconomical, letting pass off as elation and emotion all the daily\r\nstrengthening derived from sun, idleness, and sea air.\r\n\r\nHis sleep was fitful; the preciously uniform days were separated by\r\nshort nights of happy unrest. He did retire early, for at nine o\'clock,\r\nwhen Tadzio had disappeared from the scene, the day seemed over. But at\r\nthe first grey of dawn he was awakened by a gently insistent shock; he\r\nsuddenly remembered his adventure, he could no longer remain in bed; he\r\narose, and clad lightly against the chill of morning, he sat down by the\r\nopen window to await the rising of the sun. Revived by his sleep, he\r\nwatched this miraculous event with reverence. Sky, earth, and sea still\r\nlay in glassy, ghost-like twilight; a dying star still floated in the\r\nemptiness of space But a breeze started up, a winged message from\r\nhabitations beyond reach, telling that Eros was rising from beside her\r\nhusband. And that first sweet reddening in the farthest stretches of sky\r\nand sea took place by which the sentiency of creation is announced. The\r\ngoddess was approaching, the seductress of youth who stole Cleitus and\r\nCephalus, and despite the envy of all the Olympians enjoyed the love of\r\nhandsome Orion. A strewing of roses began there on the edge of the\r\nworld, an unutterably pure glowing and blooming. Childish clouds,\r\nlighted and shined through, floated like busy little Cupids in the rosy,\r\nbluish mist. Purple fell upon the sea, which seemed to be simmering, and\r\nwashing the colour towards him. Golden spears shot up into the sky from\r\nbehind. The splendour caught fire, silently, and with godlike power an\r\nintense flame of licking tongues broke out--and with rattling hoofs the\r\nbrother\'s sacred chargers mounted the horizon. Lighted by the god\'s\r\nbrilliance, he sat there, keeping watch alone. He closed his eyes,\r\nletting this glory play against the lids. Past emotions, precious early\r\nafflictions and yearnings which had been stifled by his rigorous\r\nprogramme of living, were now returning in such strange new forms. With\r\nan embarrassed, astonished smile, he recognized them. He was thinking,\r\ndreaming; slowly his lips formed a name. And still smiling, with his\r\nface turned upwards, hands folded in his lap, he fell asleep again in\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\nBut the day which began with such fiery solemnity underwent a strange\r\nmythical transformation. Where did the breeze originate which suddenly\r\nbegan playing so gently and insinuatingly, like some whispered\r\nsuggestion, about his ears and temples? Little white choppy clouds stood\r\nin the sky in scattered clumps, like the pasturing herds of the gods. A\r\nstronger wind arose, and the steeds of Poseidon came prancing up, and\r\nalong with them the steers which belonged to the blue-locked god,\r\nbellowing and lowering their horns as they ran. Yet among the detritus\r\nof the more distant beach waves were hopping forward like agile goats.\r\nHe was caught in the enchantment of a sacredly distorted world full of\r\nPanic life--and he dreamed delicate legends. Often, when the sun was\r\nsinking behind Venice, he would sit on a bench in the park observing\r\nTadzio who was dressed in a white suit with a coloured sash and was\r\nplaying ball on the smooth gravel--and it was Hyacinth that he seemed to\r\nbe watching. Hyacinth who was to die because two gods loved him. Yes, he\r\nfelt Zephyr\'s aching jealousy of the rival who forgot the oracle, the\r\nbow, and the lyre, in order to play for ever with this beauty. He saw\r\nthe discus, guided by a pitiless envy, strike the lovely head; he too,\r\ngrowing pale, caught the drooping body--and the flower, sprung from this\r\nsweet blood, bore the inscription of his unending grief.\r\n\r\nNothing is more unusual and strained than the relationship between\r\npeople who know each other only with their eyes, who meet daily, even\r\nhourly, and yet are compelled, by force of custom or their own caprices,\r\nto say no word or make no move of acknowledgement, but to maintain the\r\nappearance of an aloof unconcern. There is a restlessness and a\r\nsurcharged curiosity existing between them, the hysteria of an\r\nunsatisfied, unnaturally repressed desire for acquaintanceship and\r\nintercourse; and especially there is a kind of tense respect. For one\r\nperson loves and honours another so long as he cannot judge him, and\r\ndesire is an evidence of incomplete knowledge.\r\n\r\nSome kind of familiarity had necessarily to form itself between\r\nAschenbach and young Tadzio; and it gave the elderly man keen pleasure\r\nto see that his sympathies and interests were not left completely\r\nunanswered. For example, when the boy appeared on the beach in the\r\nmorning and was going towards his family\'s bathing house, what had\r\ninduced him never to use the boardwalk on the far side of it any more,\r\nbut to stroll along the front path, through the sand, past Aschenbach\'s\r\nhabitual place, and often unnecessarily close to him, almost touching\r\nhis table, or his chair even? Did the attraction, the fascination of an\r\noverpowering emotion have such an effect upon the frail unthinking\r\nobject of it? Aschenbach watched daily for Tadzio to approach; and\r\nsometimes he acted as though he were occupied when this event was taking\r\nplace, and he let the boy pass unobserved. But at other times he would\r\nlook up, and their glances met. They were both in deep earnest when this\r\noccurred. Nothing in the elderly man\'s cultivated and dignified\r\nexpression betrayed any inner movement; but there was a searching look\r\nin Tadzio\'s eyes, a thoughtful questioning--he began to falter, looked\r\ndown, then looked up again charmingly, and when he had passed something\r\nin his bearing seemed to indicate that it was only his breeding which\r\nkept him from turning around.\r\n\r\nOnce, however, one evening, things turned out differently. The Polish\r\nchildren and their governess had been missing at dinner in the large\r\nhall; Aschenbach had noted this uneasily. After the meal, disturbed by\r\ntheir absence, Aschenbach was walking in evening dress and straw hat in\r\nfront of the hotel at the foot of the terrace, when suddenly he saw the\r\nnunlike sisters appear in the light of the arc-lamp, accompanied by\r\ntheir governess and with Tadzio a few steps behind. Evidently they were\r\ncoming from the steamer pier after having dined for some reason in the\r\ncity. It must have been cool on the water; Tadzio was wearing a dark\r\nblue sailor overcoat with gold buttons, and on his head he had a cap to\r\nmatch. The sun and sea air had not browned him; his skin still had the\r\nsame yellow marble colour as at first. It even seemed paler to-day than\r\nusual, whether from the coolness or from the blanching moonlight of the\r\nlamps. His regular eyebrows showed up more sharply, the darkness of his\r\neyes was deeper. It is hard to say how beautiful he was; and Aschenbach\r\nwas distressed, as he had often been before, by the thought that words\r\ncan only evaluate sensuous beauty, but not re-give it.\r\n\r\nHe had not been prepared for this rich spectacle; it came unhoped for.\r\nHe had no time to entrench himself behind an expression of repose and\r\ndignity. Pleasure, surprise, admiration must have shown on his face as\r\nhis eyes met those of the boy--and at this moment it happened that\r\nTadzio smiled, smiled to him, eloquently, familiarly, charmingly,\r\nwithout concealment; and during the smile his lips slowly opened. It was\r\nthe smile of Narcissus bent over the reflecting water, that deep,\r\nfascinated, magnetic smile with which he stretches out his arms to the\r\nimage of his own beauty--a smile distorted ever so little, distorted at\r\nthe hopelessness of his efforts to kiss the pure lips of the shadow. It\r\nwas coquettish, inquisitive, and slightly tortured. It was infatuated,\r\nand infatuating.\r\n\r\nHe had received this smile, and he hurried away as though he carried a\r\nfatal gift. He was so broken up that he was compelled to escape the\r\nlight of the terrace and the front garden; he hastily hunted out the\r\ndarkness of the park in the rear. Strangely indignant and tender\r\nadmonitions wrung themselves out of him: "You dare not smile like that!\r\nListen, no one dare smile like that to another!" He threw himself down\r\non a bench; in a frenzy he breathed the night smell of the vegetation.\r\nAnd leaning back, his arms loose, overwhelmed, with frequent\r\nchills running through him, he whispered the fixed formula of\r\ndesire--impossible in this case, absurd, abject, ridiculous, and yet\r\nholy, even in this case venerable: "I love you!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring his fourth week at the Lido Gustav von Aschenbach made several\r\nsinister observations touching on the world about him. First, it seemed\r\nto him that as the season progressed the number of guests at the hotel\r\nwas diminishing rather than increasing; and German especially seemed to\r\nbe dropping away, so that finally he heard nothing but foreign sounds at\r\ntable and on the beach. Then one day in conversation with the barber,\r\nwhom he visited often, he caught a word which startled him. The man had\r\nmentioned a German family that left soon after their arrival; he added\r\nglibly and flatteringly, "But you are staying, sir. You have no fear of\r\nthe plague." Aschenbach looked at him. "The plague?" he repeated. The\r\ngossiper was silent, made out as though busy with other things, ignored\r\nthe question. When it was put more insistently, he declared that he knew\r\nnothing, and with embarrassing volubility he tried to change the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThat was about noon. In the afternoon there was a calm, and Aschenbach\r\nrode to Venice under an intense sun. For he was driven by a mania to\r\nfollow the Polish children whom he had seen with their governess taking\r\nthe road to the steamer pier. He did not find the idol at San Marco. But\r\nwhile sitting over his tea at his little round iron table on the shady\r\nside of the square, he suddenly detected a peculiar odour in the air\r\nwhich, it seemed to him now, he had noticed for days without being\r\nconsciously aware of it. The smell was sweetish and drug-like,\r\nsuggesting sickness, and wounds, and a suspicious cleanliness. He tested\r\nand examined it thoughtfully, finished his luncheon, and left the square\r\non the side opposite the church. The smell was stronger where the street\r\nnarrowed. On the corners printed posters were hung, giving municipal\r\nwarnings against certain diseases of the gastric system liable to occur\r\nat this season, against the eating of oysters and clams, and also\r\nagainst the water of the canals. The euphemistic nature of the\r\nannouncement was palpable. Groups of people had collected in silence on\r\nthe bridges and squares; and the foreigner stood among them, scenting\r\nand investigating.\r\n\r\nAt a little shop he inquired about the fatal smell, asking the\r\nproprietor, who was leaning against his door surrounded by coral chains\r\nand imitation amethyst jewellery. The man measured him with heavy eyes,\r\nand brightened up hastily. "A matter of precaution, sir!" he answered\r\nwith a gesture. "A regulation of the police which must be taken for what\r\nit is worth. This weather is oppressive, the sirocco is not good for the\r\nhealth. In short, you understand--an exaggerated prudence perhaps."\r\nAschenbach thanked him and went on. Also on the steamer back to the Lido\r\nhe caught the smell of the disinfectant.\r\n\r\nReturning to the hotel, he went immediately to the periodical stand in\r\nthe lobby and ran through the papers. He found nothing in the foreign\r\nlanguage press. The domestic press spoke of rumours, produced hazy\r\nstatistics, repeated official denials and questioned their truthfulness.\r\nThis explained the departure of the German and Austrian guests.\r\nObviously, the subjects of the other nations knew nothing, suspected\r\nnothing, were not yet uneasy. "To keep it quiet!" Aschenbach thought\r\nangrily, as he threw the papers back on the table. "To keep that quiet!"\r\nBut at the same moment he was filled with satisfaction over the\r\nadventure that was to befall the world about him. For passion, like\r\ncrime, is not suited to the secure daily rounds of order and well-being;\r\nand every slackening in the bourgeois structure, every disorder and\r\naffliction of the world, must be held welcome, since they bring with\r\nthem a vague promise of advantage. So Aschenbach felt a dark contentment\r\nwith what was taking place, under cover of the authorities, in the dirty\r\nalleys of Venice. This wicked secret of the city was welded with his own\r\nsecret, and he too was involved in keeping it hidden. For in his\r\ninfatuation he cared about nothing but the possibility of Tadzio\'s\r\nleaving, and he realized with something like terror that he would not\r\nknow how to go on living if this occurred.\r\n\r\nLately he had not been relying simply on good luck and the daily routine\r\nfor his chances to be near the boy and look at him. He pursued him,\r\nstalked him. On Sundays, for instance, the Poles never appeared on the\r\nbeach. He guessed that they must be attending mass at San Marco. He\r\nhurried there; and stepping from the heat of the square into the golden\r\ntwilight of the church, he found the boy he was hunting, bowed over a\r\n_prie-dieu_, praying. Then he stood in the background, on the cracked\r\nmosaic floor, with people on all sides kneeling, murmuring, and making\r\nthe sign of the cross. And the compact grandeur of this oriental temple\r\nweighed heavily on his senses. In front, the richly ornamented priest\r\nwas conducting the office, moving about and singing; incense poured\r\nforth, clouding the weak little flame of the candle on the altar--and\r\nwith the sweet, stuffy sacrificial odour another seemed to commingle\r\nfaintly: the smell of the infested city. But through the smoke and the\r\nsparkle Aschenbach saw how the boy there in front turned his head,\r\nhunted him out, and looked at him.\r\n\r\nWhen the crowd was streaming out through the opened portals into the\r\nbrilliant square with its swarms of pigeons, the lover hid in the\r\nvestibule; he kept trader cover, he lay in wait. He saw the Poles quit\r\nthe church, saw how the children took ceremonious leave of their mother,\r\nand how she turned towards the Piazzetta on her way home. He made sure\r\nthat the boy, the nunlike sisters, and the governess took the road to\r\nthe right through the gateway of the dock tower and into the Merceria.\r\nAnd after giving them a slight start, he followed, followed them\r\nfurtively on their walk through Venice. He had to stand still when they\r\nstopped, had to take flight in shops and courts to let them pass when\r\nthey turned back. He lost them; hot and exhausted, he hunted them over\r\nbridges and down dirty blind-alleys--and he underwent minutes of deadly\r\nagony when suddenly he saw them coming towards him in a narrow passage\r\nwhere escape was impossible. Yet it could not be said that he suffered.\r\nHe was drunk, and his steps followed the promptings of the demon who\r\ndelights in treading human reason and dignity under foot.\r\n\r\nIn one place Tadzio and his companions took a gondola; and shortly after\r\nthey had pushed off from the shore, Aschenbach, who had hidden behind\r\nsome structure, a well, while they were climbing in, now did the same.\r\nHe spoke in a hurried undertone as he directed the rower, with the\r\npromise of a generous tip, to follow unnoticed and at a distance that\r\ngondola which was just rounding the corner. And he thrilled when the\r\nman, with the roguish willingness of an accomplice, assured him in the\r\nsame tone that his wishes would be carried out, carried out faithfully.\r\n\r\nLeaning back against the soft black cushions, he rocked and glided\r\ntowards the other black-beaked craft where his passion was drawing him.\r\nAt times it escaped; then he felt worried and uneasy. But his pilot, as\r\nthough skilled in such commissions, was always able through sly\r\nmanoeuvres, speedy diagonals and shortcuts, to bring the quest into view\r\nagain. The air was quiet and smelly, the sun burned down strong through\r\nthe slate-coloured mist. Water slapped against the wood and stone. The\r\ncall of the gondolier, half warning, half greeting, was answered with a\r\nstrange obedience far away in the silence of the labyrinth. White and\r\npurple umbels with the scent of almonds hung down from little elevated\r\ngardens over crumbling walls. Arabian window-casings were outlined\r\nthrough the murkiness. The marble steps of a church descended into the\r\nwater; a beggar squatted there, protesting his misery, holding out his\r\nhat, and showing the whites of his eyes as though he were blind. An\r\nantiquarian in front of his den fawned on the passer-by and invited him\r\nto stop in the hopes of swindling him. That was Venice, the flatteringly\r\nand suspiciously beautiful--this city, half legend, half snare for\r\nstrangers; in its foul air art once flourished gluttonously, and had\r\nsuggested to its musicians seductive notes which cradle and lull. The\r\nadventurer felt as though his eyes were taking in this same luxury, as\r\nthough his ears were being won by just such melodies. He recalled too\r\nthat the city was diseased and was concealing this through greed--and he\r\npeered more eagerly after the retreating gondola.\r\n\r\nThus, in his infatuation, he wanted simply to pursue uninterrupted the\r\nobject that aroused him, to dream of it when it was not there, and,\r\nafter the fashion of lovers, to speak softly to its mere outline.\r\nLoneliness, strangeness, and the joy of a deep belated intoxication\r\nencouraged him and prompted him to accept even the remotest things\r\nwithout reserve or shame--with the result that as he returned late in\r\nthe evening from Venice, he stopped on the second floor of the hotel\r\nbefore the door of the boy\'s room, laid his head in utter drunkenness\r\nagainst the hinge of the door, and for a long time could not drag\r\nhimself away despite the danger of being caught and embarrassed in such\r\na mad situation.\r\n\r\nYet there were still moments of relief when he came partly to his\r\nsenses. "Where to!" he would think, alarmed. "Where to!" Like every man\r\nwhose natural abilities stimulate an aristocratic interest in his\r\nancestry, he was accustomed to think of his forbears in connexion with\r\nthe accomplishments and successes of his life, to assure himself of\r\ntheir approval, their satisfaction, their undeniable respect. He thought\r\nof them now, entangled as he was in such an illicit experience, caught\r\nin such exotic transgressions. He thought of their characteristic\r\nrigidity of principle, their scrupulous masculinity--and he smiled\r\ndejectedly. What would they say? But then, what would they have said to\r\nhis whole life, which was almost degenerate in its departure from\r\ntheirs, this life under the bane of art--a life against which he himself\r\nhad once issued such youthful mockeries out of loyalty to his fathers,\r\nbut which at bottom had been so much like theirs! He too had served, he\r\ntoo had been a soldier and a warrior like many of them--for art was a\r\nwar, a destructive battle, and one was not equal to it for long these\r\ndays. A life of self-conquest and of in-spite-offs, a rigid, sober, and\r\nunyielding life which he had formed into the symbol of a delicate and\r\ntimely heroism. He might well call it masculine, or brave; and it almost\r\nseemed as though the Eros mastering him were somehow peculiarly adapted\r\nand inclined to such a life. Had not this Eros stood in high repute\r\namong the bravest of peoples; was it not true that precisely through\r\nbravery he had flourished in their cities? Numerous war heroes of\r\nantiquity had willingly borne his yoke, for nothing was deemed a\r\ndisgrace which the god imposed; and acts which would Have been rebuked\r\nas the sign of cowardice if they had been done for other\r\npurposes--prostrations, oaths, entreaties, abjectness--such things did\r\nnot bring shame upon the lover, but rather he reaped praise for them.\r\n\r\nIn this way his infatuation determined the course of his thoughts, in\r\nthis way he tried to uphold himself, to preserve his respect. But at the\r\nsame time, selfish and calculating, he turned his attention to the\r\nunclean transactions here in Venice, this adventure of the outer world\r\nwhich conspired darkly with his own and which fed his passion with vague\r\nlawless hopes.\r\n\r\nBent on getting reliable news of the condition and progress of the\r\npestilence, he ransacked the local papers in the city caf\xc3\xa9s, as they\r\nhad been missing from the reading table of the hotel lobby for several\r\ndays now. Statements alternated with disavowals. The number of the sick\r\nand dead was supposed to reach twenty, forty, or even a hundred and\r\nmore--and immediately afterwards every instance of the plague would be\r\neither flatly denied or attributed to completely isolated cases which\r\nhad crept in from the outside. There were scattered admonitions,\r\nprotests against the dangerous conduct of foreign authorities. Certainty\r\nwas impossible. Nevertheless the lone man felt especially entitled to\r\nparticipate in the secret; and although he was excluded, he derived a\r\ngrotesque satisfaction from putting embarrassing questions to those who\r\ndid know, and as they were pledged to silence, forcing them into\r\ndeliberate lies. One day at breakfast in the large dining-hall he\r\nentered into a conversation with the manager, that softly-treading\r\nlittle man in the French frock coat who was moving amiably and\r\nsolicitously about among the diners and had stopped at Aschenbach\'s\r\ntable for a few passing words. Just why, the guest asked negligently and\r\ncasually, had disinfectants become so prevalent in Venice recently? "It\r\nhas to do," was the evasive answer, "with a police regulation, and is\r\nintended to prevent any inconveniences or disturbances to the public\r\nhealth which might result from the exceptionally warm and threatening\r\nweather." . . . "The police are to be congratulated," Aschenbach\r\nanswered; and after the exchange of a few remarks on the weather, the\r\nmanager left.\r\n\r\nYet that same day, in the evening, after dinner, it happened that a\r\nlittle band of strolling singers from the city gave a performance in the\r\nfront garden of the hotel. Two men and two women, they stood by the iron\r\npost of an arc-lamp and turned their whitened faces up towards the large\r\nterrace where the guests were enjoying this folk-recital over their\r\ncoffee and cooling drinks. The hotel personnel, bell boys, waiters, and\r\nclerks from the office, could be seen listening by the doors of the\r\nvestibule. The Russian family, eager and precise in their amusements,\r\nhad had wicker chairs placed in the garden in order to be nearer the\r\nperformers; and they were sitting here in an appreciative semi-circle.\r\nBehind the ladies and gentlemen, in her turban-like kerchief, stood the\r\nold slave.\r\n\r\nMandolin, guitar, harmonica, and a squeaky violin were responding to the\r\ntouch of the virtuoso beggars. Instrumental numbers alternated with\r\nsongs, as when the younger of the women, with a sharp trembling voice,\r\njoined with the sweetly falsetto tenor in a languishing love duet. But\r\nthe real talent and leader of the group was undoubtedly the other of the\r\ntwo men, the one with the guitar. He was a kind of _buffo_ baritone,\r\nwith not much of a voice, although he did have a gift for pantomime, and\r\na remarkable comic energy. Often, with his large instrument under his\r\narm, he would leave the rest of the group and, still acting, would\r\nintrude on the platform, where his antics were rewarded with encouraging\r\nlaughter. Especially the Russians in their seats down front seemed to be\r\nenchanted with so much southern mobility, and their applause incited him\r\nto let himself out more and more boldly and assertively.\r\n\r\nAschenbach sat on the balustrade, cooling his lips now and then with a\r\nmixture of pomegranate juice and soda which glowed ruby red in his glass\r\nin front of him. His nerves took in the miserable notes, the vulgar\r\ncrooning melodies; for passion lames the sense of discrimination, and\r\nsurrenders in all seriousness to appeals which, in sober moments, are\r\neither humorously allowed for or rejected with annoyance. At the clown\'s\r\nantics his features bad twisted into a set painful smile. He sat there\r\nrelaxed, although inwardly he was intensely awake; for six paces from\r\nhim Tadzio was leaning against the stone hand-rail.\r\n\r\nIn the white belted coat which he often wore at meal times, he was\r\nstanding in a position of spontaneous and inborn gracefulness, his left\r\nforearm on the railing, feet crossed, the right hand on a supporting\r\nhip; and he looked down at the street-singers with an expression which\r\nwas hardly a smile, but only an aloof curiosity, a polite amiability.\r\nOften he would stand erect and, expanding his chest, would draw the\r\nwhite smock down under his leather belt with a beautiful gesture. And\r\nthen too, the aging man observed with a tumult of fright and triumph how\r\nhe would often turn his head over the left shoulder in the direction of\r\nhis admirer, carefully and hesitatingly, or even with abruptness as\r\nthough to attack by surprise. He did not meet Aschenbach\'s eyes, for a\r\nmean precaution compelled the transgressor to keep from staring at him:\r\nin the background of the terrace the women who guarded Tadzio were\r\nsitting, and things had reached a point where the lover had to fear that\r\nhe might be noticed and suspected. Yes, he had often observed with a\r\nkind of numbness how, when Tadzio was near him, on the beach, in the\r\nhotel lobby, in the Piazza San Marco, they called him back, they were\r\nset on keeping him at a distance--and this wounded him frightfully,\r\ncausing his pride unknown tortures which his conscience would not permit\r\nhim to evade.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the guitar-player had begun a solo to his own accompaniment,\r\na street-ballad popular throughout Italy. It had several strophes, and\r\nthe entire company joined each time in the refrain, all singing and\r\nplaying, while he managed to give a plastic and dramatic twist to the\r\nperformance. Of slight build, with thin and impoverished features, he\r\nstood on the gravel, apart from his companions, in an attitude of\r\ninsolent bravado, his shabby felt hat on the back of his head so that a\r\nbunch of his red hair jutted out from under the brim. And to the\r\nthrumming of the strings he flung his jokes up at the terrace in a\r\npenetrating recitative; while the veins were swelling on his forehead\r\nfrom the exertion of his performance. He did not seem of Venetian stock,\r\nbut rather of the race of Neapolitan comedians, half pimp, half\r\nentertainer, brutal and audacious, dangerous and amusing. His song was\r\nstupid enough so far as the words went; but in his mouth, by his\r\ngestures, the movements of his body, his way of blinking significantly\r\nand letting the tongue play across his lips, it acquired something\r\nambiguous, something vaguely repulsive. In addition to the customary\r\ncivilian dress, he was wearing a sport shirt; and his skinny neck\r\nprotruded above the soft collar, baring a noticeably large and active\r\nAdam\'s-apple. He was pale and snub-nosed. It was hard to fix an age to\r\nhis beardless features, which seemed furrowed with grimaces and\r\ndepravity; and the two wrinkles standing arrogantly, harshly, almost\r\nsavagely between his reddish eyebrows were strangely suited to the smirk\r\non his mobile lips. Yet what really prompted the lonely man to pay him\r\nkeen attention was the observation that the questionable figure seemed\r\nalso to provide its own questionable atmosphere. For each time they came\r\nto the refrain the singer, amid buffoonery and familiar handshakes,\r\nbegan a grotesque circular march which brought him immediately beneath\r\nAschenbach\'s place; and each time this happened there blew up to the\r\nterrace from his clothes and body a strong carbolic smell.\r\n\r\nAfter the song was ended, he began collecting money. He started with the\r\nRussians, who were evidently willing to spend, and then came up the\r\nstairs. Up here he showed himself just as humble as he had been bold\r\nduring the performance. Cringing and bowing, he stole about among the\r\ntables, and a smile of obsequious cunning exposed his strong teeth,\r\nwhile the two wrinkles still stood ominously between his red eyebrows.\r\nThis singular character collecting money to live on--they eyed him with\r\na curiosity and a kind of repugnance, they tossed coins into his felt\r\nhat with the tips of their fingers, and were careful not to touch him.\r\nThe elimination of the physical distance between the comedian and the\r\naudience, no matter how great the enjoyment may have been, always causes\r\na certain uneasiness. He felt it, and tried to excuse it by grovelling.\r\nHe came up to Aschenbach, and along with him the smell, which no one\r\nelse seemed concerned about.\r\n\r\n"Listen!" the recluse said in an undertone, almost mechanically. "They\r\nare disinfecting Venice. Why?" The jester answered hoarsely, "On account\r\nof the police. That is a precaution, sir, with such heat, and the\r\nsirocco. The sirocco is oppressive. It is not good for the health." He\r\nspoke as though astonished that any one could ask such things, and\r\ndemonstrated with his open hand how oppressive the sirocco was. "Then\r\nthere is no plague in Venice?" Aschenbach asked quietly, between his\r\nteeth. The clown\'s muscular features fell into a grimace of comical\r\nembarrassment. "A plague? What kind of plague? Perhaps our police are a\r\nplague? You like to joke! A plague! Of all things! A precautionary\r\nmeasure, you understand! A police regulation against the effects of the\r\noppressive weather." He gesticulated. "Very well," Aschenbach said\r\nseveral times curtly and quietly; and he quickly dropped an unduly large\r\ncoin into the hat. Then with his eyes he signalled the man to leave. He\r\nobeyed, smirking and bowing. But he had not reached the stairs before\r\ntwo hotel employees threw themselves upon him, and with their faces\r\nclose to his began a whispered cross-examination. He shrugged his\r\nshoulders; he gave assurances, he swore that he had kept quiet--that was\r\nevident. He was released, and he returned to the garden; then after a\r\nshort conference with his companions, he stepped out once more for a\r\nfinal song of thanks and leave-taking.\r\n\r\nIt was a rousing song which the recluse never recalled having heard\r\nbefore, a "big number" in incomprehensible dialect, with a laugh refrain\r\nin which the troupe joined regularly at the tops of their voices. At\r\nthis point both the words and the accompaniment of the instruments\r\nstopped, with nothing left but a laugh which was somehow arranged\r\nrhythmically although very naturally done--and the soloist especially\r\nshowed great talent in giving it a most deceptive vitality. At the\r\nrenewal of his professional distance from the audience he had recovered\r\nall his boldness again, and the artificial laugh that he directed up\r\ntowards the terrace was derisive. Even before the end of the articulate\r\nportion of the strophe, he seemed to struggle against an irresistible\r\ntickling. He gulped, his voice trembled, he pressed his hand over his\r\nmouth, he contorted his shoulders; and at the proper moment the\r\nungovernable laugh broke out of him, burst into such real cackles that\r\nit was infectious and communicated itself to the audience, so that on\r\nthe terrace also an unfounded hilarity, living off itself alone, started\r\nup. But this seemed to double the singer\'s exuberance. He bent his\r\nknees, he slapped his thighs, he nearly split himself; he no longer\r\nlaughed, he shrieked. He pointed up with his finger, as though nothing\r\nwere more comic than the laughing guests there, and finally everyone in\r\nthe garden and on the verandah was laughing, even to the waiters, bell\r\nboys, and house-servants in the doorways.\r\n\r\nAschenbach was no longer resting in his chair; he sat upright, as if\r\nattempting to defend himself, or to escape. But the laughter, the whiffs\r\nof the hospital smell, and the boy\'s nearness combined to put him into a\r\ntrance that held his mind and his senses hopelessly captive. In the\r\ngeneral movement and distraction he ventured to glance across at Tadzio,\r\nand as he did so he dared observe that the boy, in reply to his glance,\r\nwas equally serious, much as though he had modelled his conduct and\r\nexpression after those of one man, and the prevalent mood had no effect\r\non him since this one man was not part of it. This portentous childish\r\nobedience had something so disarming and overpowering about it that the\r\ngrey-haired man could hardly restrain himself from burying his face in\r\nhis hands. It had also seemed to him that Tadzio\'s occasional stretching\r\nand quick breathing indicated a complaint, a congestion, of the lungs.\r\n"He is sickly, he will probably not grow old," he thought repeatedly\r\nwith that positiveness which is often a peculiar relief to desire and\r\npassion. And along with pure solitude he had a feeling of rakish\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Venetians had ended and were leaving. Applause accompanied\r\nthem, and their leader did not miss the opportunity to cover his retreat\r\nwith further jests. His bows, the kisses he blew, were laughed at--and\r\nso he doubled them. When his companions were already gone, he acted as\r\nthough he had hurt himself by backing into a lamp-post, and he crept\r\nthrough the gate seemingly crippled with pain. Then he suddenly threw\r\noff the mask of comic hard luck, stood upright, hurried away jauntily,\r\nstuck out his tongue insolently at the guests on the terrace, and\r\nslipped into the darkness. The company was breaking up; Tadzio had been\r\nmissing from the balustrade for some time. But, to the displeasure of\r\nthe waiters, the lonely man sat for a long while over the remains of his\r\npomegranate drink. Night advanced. Time was crumbling. In the house of\r\nhis parents many years back there had been an hour glass--of a sudden he\r\nsaw the fragile and expressive instrument again, as though it were\r\nstanding in front of him. Fine and noiseless the rust-red sand was\r\nrunning through the glass neck; and since it was getting low in the\r\nupper half, a speedy little vortex had been formed there.\r\n\r\nAs early as the following day, in the afternoon, he had made new\r\nprogress in his obstinate baiting of the people he met--and this time he\r\nhad all possible success. He walked from the Piazza of St. Mark\'s into\r\nthe English travelling bureau located there; and after changing some\r\nmoney at the cash desk, he put on the expression of a distrustful\r\nforeigner and launched his fatal question at the attendant clerk. He was\r\na Britisher; he wore a woollen suit, and was still young, with close-set\r\neyes, and had that characteristic stolid reliability which is so\r\npeculiarly and strikingly appealing in the tricky, nimble-witted South.\r\nHe began, "No reason for alarm, sir. A regulation without any serious\r\nsignificance. Such measures are often taken to anticipate the unhealthy\r\neffects of the heat and the sirocco . . ." But as he raised his blue\r\neyes, he met the stare of the foreigner, a tired and somewhat unhappy\r\nstare focussed on his lips with a touch of scorn. Then the Englishman\r\nblushed. "At least," he continued in an emotional undertone, "that is\r\nthe official explanation which people here are content to accept. I will\r\nadmit that there is something more behind it." And then in his frank and\r\nleisurely manner he told the truth.\r\n\r\nFor several years now Indian cholera had shown a heightened tendency to\r\nspread and migrate. Hatched in the warm swamps of the Ganges delta,\r\nrising with the noxious breath of that luxuriant, unfit primitive world\r\nand island wilderness which is shunned by humans and where the tiger\r\ncrouches in the bamboo thickets, the plague had raged continuously and\r\nwith unusual strength in Hindustan, had reached eastwards to China,\r\nwestwards to Afghanistan and Persia, and following the chief caravan\r\nroutes, had carried its terrors to Astrachan, and even to Moscow. But\r\nwhile Europe was trembling lest the spectre continue its advance from\r\nthere across the country, it had been transported over the sea by Syrian\r\nmerchantmen, and had turned up almost simultaneously in several\r\nMediterranean ports, had raised its head in Toulon and Malaga, had\r\nshowed its mask several times in Palermo and Naples, and seemed\r\npermanently entrenched through Calabria and Apulia. The north of the\r\npeninsula had been spared. Yet in the middle of this May in Venice the\r\nfrightful vibrions were found on one and the same day in the blackish\r\nwasted bodies of a cabin boy and a woman who sold greengroceries. The\r\ncases were kept secret. But within a week there were ten, twenty, thirty\r\nmore, and in various sections. A man from the Austrian provinces who had\r\nmade a pleasure trip to Venice for a few days, returned to his home town\r\nand died with unmistakable symptoms--and that is how the first reports\r\nof the pestilence in the lagoon city got into the German newspapers. The\r\nVenetian authorities answered that the city\'s health conditions had\r\nnever been better, and took the most necessary preventive measures. But\r\nprobably the food supply had been infected. Denied and glossed over,\r\ndeath was eating its way along the narrow streets, and its dissemination\r\nwas especially favoured by the premature summer heat which made the\r\nwater of the canals lukewarm. Yes, it seemed as though the plague had\r\ngot renewed strength, as though the tenacity and fruitfulness of its\r\nstimuli had doubled. Cases of recovery were rare. Out of a hundred\r\nattacks, eighty were fatal, and in the most horrible manner. For the\r\nplague moved with utter savagery, and often showed that most dangerous\r\nform, which is called "the drying." Water from the blood vessels\r\ncollected in pockets, and the blood was unable to carry this off. Within\r\na few hours the victim was parched, his blood became as thick as glue,\r\nand he stifled amid cramps and hoarse groans. Lucky for him if, as\r\nsometimes happened, the attack took the form of a light discomfiture\r\nfollowed by a profound coma from which he seldom or never awakened. At\r\nthe beginning of June the pesthouse of the Ospedale Civico had quietly\r\nfilled; there was not much room left in the two orphan asylums, and a\r\nfrightfully active commerce was kept up between the wharf of the\r\nFondamenta Nuove and San Michele, the burial island. But there was the\r\nfear of a general drop in prosperity. The recently opened art exhibit in\r\nthe public gardens was to be considered, along with the heavy losses\r\nwhich in case of panic or unfavourable rumours, would threaten business,\r\nthe hotels, the entire elaborate system for exploiting foreigners--and\r\nas these considerations evidently carried more weight than love of truth\r\nor respect for international agreements, the city authorities upheld\r\nobstinately their policy of silence and denial. The chief health officer\r\nhad resigned from his post in indignation, and been promptly replaced by\r\na more tractable personality. The people knew this; and the corruption\r\nof their superiors, together with the predominating insecurity, the\r\nexceptional condition into which the prevalence of death had plunged the\r\ncity, induced a certain demoralization of the lower classes, encouraging\r\nshady and anti-social impulses which manifested themselves in licence,\r\nprofligacy, and a rising crime wave. Contrary to custom, many drunkards\r\nwere seen in the evenings; it was said that at night nasty mobs made the\r\nstreets unsafe. Burglaries and even murders became frequent, for it had\r\nalready been proved on two occasions that persons who had presumably\r\nfallen victim to the plague had in reality been dispatched with poison\r\nby their own relatives. And professional debauchery assumed abnormal and\r\nobtrusive proportions such as had never been known here before, and to\r\nan extent which is usually found only in the southern parts of the\r\ncountry and in the Orient.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman pronounced the final verdict on these facts. "You would\r\ndo well," he concluded, "to leave to-day rather than to-morrow. It\r\ncannot be much more than a couple of days before a quarantine zone is\r\ndeclared." "Thank you," Aschenbach said, and left the office.\r\n\r\nThe square lay sunless and stifling. Unsuspecting foreigners sat in\r\nfront of the caf\xc3\xa9s, or stood among the pigeons in front of the church\r\nand watched the swarms of birds flapping their wings, crowding one\r\nanother, and pecking at grains of corn offered them in open palms. The\r\nrecluse was feverishly excited, triumphant in his possession of the\r\ntruth. But it had left him with a bad taste in his mouth, and a weird\r\nhorror in his heart. As he walked up and down the flagstones of the\r\ngorgeous court he was weighing an action which would meet the situation\r\nand would absolve him. This evening after dinner he could approach the\r\nwoman with the pearls and make her a speech; he had figured it out word\r\nfor word: "Permit a foreigner, madam, to give you some useful advice, a\r\nwarning, which is being withheld from you through self-interest. Leave\r\nimmediately with Tadzio and your daughters! Venice is full of the\r\nplague." Then he could lay a farewell hand on the head of this tool of a\r\nmocking divinity, turn away, and flee this morass. But he felt at the\r\nsame time that he was very far from seriously desiring such a move. He\r\nwould retract it, would disengage himself from it. . . . But when we are\r\ndistracted we loathe most the thought of retracing our steps. He\r\nrecalled a white building, ornamented with inscriptions which glistened\r\nin the evening and in whose transparent mysticism his mind\'s eye had\r\nlost itself--and then that strange wanderer\'s form which had awakened in\r\nthe aging man the roving hankerings of youth after the foreign and the\r\nremote. And the thought of return, the thought of prudence and\r\nsoberness, effort, mastery, disgusted him to such an extent that his\r\nface was distorted with an expression of physical nausea. "It must be\r\nkept silent!" he whispered heavily. And: "I will keep silent!" The\r\nconsciousness of his share in the facts and the guilt intoxicated him,\r\nmuch as a little wine intoxicates a tired brain. The picture of the\r\ndiseased and neglected city hovering desolately before him aroused vague\r\nhopes beyond the bounds of reason, but with an egregious sweetness. What\r\nwas the scant happiness he had dreamed of a moment ago, compared with\r\nthese expectations? What were art and virtue worth to him, over against\r\nthe advantages of chaos? He kept silent, and remained in Venice.\r\n\r\nThis same night he had a frightful dream, if one can designate as a\r\ndream a bodily and mental experience which occurred to him in the\r\ndeepest sleep, completely independent of him, and with a physical\r\nrealness, although he never saw himself present or moving about among\r\nthe incidents; but their stage rather was his soul itself, and they\r\nbroke in from without, trampling down his resistance--a profound and\r\nspiritual resistance--by sheer force; and when they had passed through,\r\nthey left his substance, the culture of his lifetime, crushed and\r\nannihilated behind them.\r\n\r\nIt began with anguish, anguish and desire, and a frightened curiosity as\r\nto what was coming. It was night, and his senses were on the watch. From\r\nfar off a grumble, an uproar, was approaching, a jumble of noises.\r\nClanking, blaring, and dull thunder, with shrill shouts and a definite\r\nwhine in a long drawn out u-sound--all this was sweetly, ominously\r\ninterspersed and dominated by the deep cooing of wickedly persistent\r\nflutes which charmed the bowels in a shamelessly penetrative manner. But\r\nhe knew one word; it was veiled, and yet would name what was\r\napproaching: "The foreign god!" Vaporous fire began to glow; then he\r\nrecognized mountains like those about his summer house. And in the\r\nscattered light, from high up in the woods, among tree trunks and\r\ncrumbling moss-grown rocks--people, beasts, a throng, a raging mob\r\nplunged twisting and whirling downwards, and made the hill swarm with\r\nbodies, flames, tumult, and a riotous round dance. Women, tripped by\r\nover-long fur draperies which hung from their waists, were holding up\r\ntambourines and beating on them, their groaning heads flung back. Others\r\nswung sparking firebrands and bare daggers, or wore hissing snakes about\r\nthe middle of their bodies, or shrieking held their breasts in their two\r\nhands. Men with horns on their foreheads, shaggy-haired, girded with\r\nhides, bent back their necks and raised their arms and thighs, clashed\r\nbrass cymbals and beat furiously at kettledrums, while smooth boys\r\nprodded he-goats with wreathed sticks, climbing on their horns and\r\nfalling off with shouts when they bounded. And the bacchantes wailed the\r\nword with the soft consonants and the drawn out u-sound, at once sweet\r\nand savage, like nothing ever heard before. In one place it rang out as\r\nthough piped into the air by stags, and it was echoed in another by many\r\nvoices, in wild triumph--with it they incited one another to dance and\r\nto fling out their arms and legs, and it was never silent. But\r\neverything was pierced and dominated by the deep coaxing flute. He who\r\nwas fighting against this experience--did it not coax him too with its\r\nshameless penetration, into the feast and the excesses of the extreme\r\nsacrifice? His repugnance, his fear, were keen--he was honourably set on\r\ndefending himself to the very last against the barbarian, the foe to\r\nintellectual poise and dignity. But the noise, the howling, multiplied\r\nby the resonant walls of the hills, grew, took the upper hand, swelled\r\nto a fury of rapture. Odours oppressed the senses, the pungent smell of\r\nthe bucks, the scent of moist bodies, and a waft of stagnant water, with\r\nanother smell, something familiar, the smell of wounds and prevalent\r\ndisease. At the beating of the drum his heart fluttered, his head was\r\nspinning, he was caught in a frenzy, in a blinding deafening\r\nlewdness--and he yearned to join the ranks of the god. The obscene\r\nsymbol, huge, wooden, was uncovered and raised up; then they howled the\r\nmagic word with more abandon. Foaming at the mouth, they raged, teased\r\none another with ruttish gestures and caressing hands; laughing and\r\ngroaning, they stuck the goads into one another\'s flesh and licked the\r\nblood from their limbs. But the dreamer now was with them, in them, and\r\nhe belonged to the foreign god. Yes, they were he himself, as they\r\nhurled themselves biting and tearing upon the animals, got entangled in\r\nsteaming rags, and fell in promiscuous unions on the torn moss, in\r\nsacrifice to their god. And his soul tasted the unchastity and fury of\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\nWhen he awakened from the affliction of this dream he was unnerved,\r\nshattered, and hopelessly under the power of the demon. He no longer\r\navoided the inquisitive glances of other people; he did not care if he\r\nwas exciting their suspicions. And as a matter of fact they were\r\nfleeing, travelling elsewhere. Numerous bathing houses stood empty, the\r\noccupants of the dining-hall became more and more scattered, and in the\r\ncity now one rarely saw a foreigner. The truth seemed to have leaked\r\nout; the panic, despite the reticence of those whose interests were\r\ninvolved, seemed no longer avoidable. But the woman with the pearls\r\nremained with her family, either because the rumours had not yet reached\r\nher, or because she was too proud and fearless to heed them. Tadzio\r\nremained. And to Aschenbach, in his infatuation, it seemed at times as\r\nthough flight and death might remove all the disturbing elements of life\r\naround them, and he stay here alone with the boy. Yes, by the sea in the\r\nforenoon when his eyes rested heavily, irresponsibly, unwaveringly on\r\nthe thing he coveted, or when, as the day was ending, he followed\r\nshamelessly after him through streets where the hideous death lurked in\r\nsecret--at such times the atrocious seemed to him rich in possibilities,\r\nand laws of morality had dropped away.\r\n\r\nLike any lover, he wanted to please; and he felt a bitter anguish lest\r\nit might not be possible. He added bright youthful details to his dress,\r\nhe put on jewels, and used perfumes. During the day he often spent much\r\ntime over his toilet, and came to the table strikingly dressed, excited,\r\nand in suspense. In the light of the sweet youthfulness which had done\r\nthis to him, he detested his aging body. The sight of his grey hair, his\r\nsharp features, plunged him into shame and hopelessness. It induced him\r\nto attempt rejuvenating his body and appearance. He often visited the\r\nhotel barber.\r\n\r\nBeneath the barber\'s apron, leaning back in the chair under the\r\ngossiper\'s expert hands, he winced to observe his reflection in the\r\nmirror.\r\n\r\n"Grey," he said, making a wry face.\r\n\r\n"A little," the man answered. "Due entirely to a slight neglect, an\r\nindifference to outward things, which is conceivable in people of\r\nimportance, but it is not exactly praiseworthy. And all the less so\r\nsince such persons are above prejudice in matters of nature or art. If\r\nthe moral objections of certain people to the art of cosmetics were to\r\nbe logically extended to the care of the teeth, they would give no\r\nslight offence. And after all, we are just as old as we feel, and under\r\nsome circumstances grey hair would actually stand for more of an untruth\r\nthan the despised correction. In your case, sir, you are entitled to the\r\nnatural colour of your hair. Will you permit me simply to return what\r\nbelongs to you?"\r\n\r\n"How is that?" Aschenbach asked.\r\n\r\nThen the orator washed his client\'s hair with two kinds of water, one\r\nclear and one dark, and it was as black as in youth. Following this, he\r\ncurled it with irons into soft waves, stepped back, and eyed his work.\r\n\r\n"All that is left now," he said, "would be to freshen up the skin a\r\nlittle."\r\n\r\nAnd like someone who cannot finish, cannot satisfy himself, he passed\r\nwith quickening energy from one manipulation to another. Aschenbach\r\nrested comfortably, incapable of resistance, or rather his hopes aroused\r\nby what was taking place. In the glass he saw his brows arch more evenly\r\nand decisively. His eyes became longer; their brilliance was heightened\r\nby a light touching-up of the lids. A little lower, where the skin had\r\nbeen a leatherish brown, he saw a delicate crimson tint grow beneath a\r\ndeft application of colour. His lips, bloodless a little while past,\r\nbecame full, and as red as raspberries. The furrows in the cheeks and\r\nabout the mouth, the wrinkles of the eyes, disappeared beneath lotions\r\nand cream. With a knocking heart he beheld a blossoming youth. Finally\r\nthe beauty specialist declared himself content, after the manner of such\r\npeople, by obsequiously thanking the man he had been serving. "A\r\ntrifling assistance," he said, as he applied one parting touch. "Now the\r\ngentleman can fall in love unhesitatingly." He walked away, fascinated;\r\nhe was happy as in a dream, timid and bewildered. His necktie was red,\r\nhis broad-brimmed straw hat was trimmed with a variegated band.\r\n\r\nA tepid storm wind had risen. It was raining sparsely and at intervals,\r\nbut the air was damp, thick, and filled with the smell of things\r\nrotting. All around him he heard a fluttering, pattering, and swishing;\r\nand under the fever of his cosmetics it seemed to him as though evil\r\nwind-spirits were haunting the place, impure sea birds which rooted and\r\ngnawed at the food of the condemned and befouled it with their\r\ndroppings. For the sultriness destroyed his appetite, and the fancy\r\nsuggested itself that the foods were poisoned with contaminating\r\nsubstances. Tracking the boy one afternoon, Aschenbach had plunged deep\r\ninto the tangled centre of the diseased city. He was becoming uncertain\r\nof where he was, since the alleys, waterways, bridges, and little\r\nsquares of the labyrinth were all so much alike, and he was no longer\r\neven sure of directions. He was absorbed with the problem of keeping the\r\npursued figure in sight. And, driven to disgraceful subterfuges,\r\nflattening himself against walls, hiding behind the backs of other\r\npeople, for a long time he did not notice the weariness, the exhaustion,\r\nwith which emotion and the continual suspense had taxed his mind and his\r\nbody. Tadzio walked behind his companions. He always allowed the\r\ngoverness and the nunlike sisters to precede him in the narrow places;\r\nand loitering behind alone, he would turn his head occasionally to look\r\nover his shoulder and make sure by a glance of his peculiarly dark-grey\r\neyes that his admirer was following. He saw him, and did not betray him.\r\nDrunk with the knowledge of this, lured forward by those eyes, led\r\nmeekly by his passion, the lover stole after his unseemly hope--but\r\nfinally he was cheated and lost sight of him. The Poles had crossed a\r\nshort arching bridge; the height of the curve hid them from the pursuer,\r\nand when he himself had arrived there he no longer saw them. He hunted\r\nfor them vainly in three directions, straight ahead and to either side\r\nalong the narrow dirty wharf. In the end he was so tired and unnerved\r\nthat he had to give up the search.\r\n\r\nHis head was on fire, his body was covered with a sticky sweat, his\r\nknees trembled. He could no longer endure the thirst that was torturing\r\nhim, and he looked around for some immediate relief. From a little\r\nvegetable store he bought some fruit--strawberries, soft and overly\r\nripe--and he ate them as he walked. A very charming, forsaken little\r\nsquare opened up before him. He recognized it; here he had made his\r\nfrustrated plans for flight weeks ago. He let himself sink down on the\r\nsteps of the cistern in the middle of the square, and laid his head\r\nagainst the stone cylinder. It was quiet; grass was growing up through\r\nthe pavement; refuse was scattered about. Among the weather-beaten,\r\nunusually tall houses surrounding him there was one like a palace, with\r\nlittle lion-covered balconies, and Gothic windows with blank emptiness\r\nbehind them. On the ground floor of another house was a drug store. Warm\r\ngusts of wind occasionally carried the smell of carbolic acid.\r\n\r\nHe sat there, he, the master, the artist of dignity, the author of The\r\nWretch, a work which had, in such accurate symbols, renounced\r\nvagabondage and the depths of misery, had denied all sympathy with the\r\nengulfed, and had cast out the outcast; the man who had arrived and,\r\nvictor over his own knowledge, had outgrown all irony and acclimatized\r\nhimself to the obligations of public confidence; whose reputation was\r\nofficial, whose name had been knighted, and on whose style boys were\r\nurged to pattern themselves--he sat there. His eyelids were shut; only\r\nnow and then a mocking uneasy side-glance slipped out from beneath them.\r\nAnd his loose lips, set off by the cosmetics, formed isolated words of\r\nthe strange dream-logic created by his half-slumbering brain.\r\n\r\n"For beauty, Phaedrus, mark me, beauty alone is both divine and visible\r\nat once; and thus it is the road of the sensuous; it is, little\r\nPhaedrus, the road of the artist to the spiritual. But do you now\r\nbelieve, my dear, that they can ever attain wisdom and true human\r\ndignity for whom the road to the spiritual leads through the senses? Or\r\ndo you believe rather (I leave the choice to you) that this is a\r\npleasant but perilous road, a really wrong and sinful road, which\r\nnecessarily leads astray? For you must know that we poets cannot take\r\nthe road of beauty without having Eros join us and set himself up as our\r\nleader. Indeed, we may even be heroes after our fashion, and hardened\r\nwarriors, though we be like women, for passion is our exaltation, and\r\nour desire must remain love--that is our pleasure and our disgrace. You\r\nnow see, do you not, that we poets cannot be wise and dignified? That we\r\nnecessarily go astray, necessarily remain lascivious, and adventurers in\r\nemotion? The mastery of our style is all lies and foolishness, our\r\nrenown and honour are a farce, the confidence of the masses in us is\r\nhighly ridiculous, and the training of the public and of youth through\r\nart is a precarious undertaking which should be forbidden. For how\r\nindeed could he be a fit instructor who is born with a natural leaning\r\ntowards the precipice? We might well disavow it and reach after dignity,\r\nbut wherever we turn it attracts us. Let us, say, renounce the\r\ndissolvent of knowledge, since knowledge, Phaedrus, has no dignity or\r\nstrength. It is aware, it understands and pardons, but without reserve\r\nand form. It feels sympathy with the precipice, it is the precipice.\r\nThis then we abandon with firmness, and from now on our efforts matter\r\nonly by their yield of beauty, or in other words, simplicity, greatness,\r\nand new rigour, form, and a second type of openness. But form and\r\nopenness, Phaedrus, lead to intoxication and to desire, lead the noble\r\nperhaps into sinister revels of emotion which his own beautiful rigour\r\nrejects as infamous, lead to the precipice, yes they too lead to the\r\nprecipice. They lead us poets there, I say, since we cannot force\r\nourselves, since we can merely let ourselves out And now I am going,\r\nPhaedrus. You stay here; and when you no longer see me, then you go\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later, as Gustav von Aschenbach was not feeling well, he left\r\nthe beach hotel at a later hour in the morning than usual. He had to\r\nfight against certain attacks of vertigo which were only partially\r\nphysical and were accompanied by a pronounced malaise, a feeling of\r\nbafflement and hopelessness--while he was not certain whether this had\r\nto do with conditions outside him or with his own nature. In the lobby\r\nhe noticed a large pile of luggage ready for shipment; he asked the\r\ndoor-keeper who it was that was leaving, and heard in answer the Polish\r\ntitle which he had learned secretly. He accepted this without any\r\nalteration of his sunken features, with that curt elevation of the head\r\nby which one acknowledges something he does not need to know. Then he\r\nasked, "When?" The answer was, "After lunch." He nodded, and went to the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nIt was not very inviting. Rippling patches of rain retreated across the\r\nwide flat water separating the beach from the first long sand-bank. An\r\nair of autumn, of things past their prime, seemed to lie over the\r\npleasure spot which had once been so alive with colour and was now\r\nalmost abandoned. The sand was no longer kept clean. A camera, seemingly\r\nwithout an owner, stood on its tripod by the edge of the sea; and a\r\nblack cloth thrown over it was flapping noisily in the wind.\r\n\r\nTadzio, with the three or four companions still left, was moving about\r\nto the right in front of his family\'s cabin. And midway between the sea\r\nand the row of bathing houses, lying back in his chair with a robe over\r\nhis knees, Aschenbach looked at him once more. The game, which was not\r\nbeing supervised since the women were probably occupied with\r\npreparations for the journey, seemed to have no rules, and it was\r\ndegenerating. The stocky boy with the sleek black hair who was called\r\nJaschu had been angered and blinded by sand flung in his face. He forced\r\nTadzio into a wrestling match which quickly ended in the fall of the\r\nbeauty, who was weaker. But as though in the hour of parting the servile\r\nfeelings of the inferior had turned to merciless brutality and were\r\ntrying to get vengeance for a long period of slavery, the victor did not\r\nlet go of the boy underneath, but knelt on his back and pressed his face\r\nso persistently into the sand that Tadzio, already breathless from the\r\nstruggle, was in danger of strangling. His attempts to shake off the\r\nweight were fitful; for moments they stopped entirely and were resumed\r\nagain as mere twitchings. Enraged, Aschenbach was about to spring to the\r\nrescue, when the torturer finally released his victim. Tadzio, very\r\npale, raised himself halfway and sat motionless for several minutes,\r\nresting on one arm, with rumpled hair and glowering eyes. Then he stood\r\nup completely, and moved slowly away. They called him, cheerfully at\r\nfirst, then anxiously and imploringly; he did not listen. The swarthy\r\nboy, who seemed to regret his excesses immediately afterwards, caught up\r\nwith him and tried to placate him. A movement of the shoulder put him at\r\nhis distance. Tadzio went down obliquely to the water. He was barefoot,\r\nand wore his striped linen suit with the red bow.\r\n\r\nHe lingered on the edge of the water with his head down, drawing figures\r\nin the wet sand with one toe; then he went into the shallows, which did\r\nnot cover his knees in the deepest place, crossed them leisurely, and\r\narrived at the sand-bank. He stood there a moment, his face turned to\r\nthe open sea; soon after, he began stepping slowly to the left along the\r\nnarrow stretch of exposed ground. Separated from the mainland by the\r\nexpanse of water, separated from his companions by a proud moodiness, he\r\nmoved along, a strongly isolated and unrelated figure with fluttering\r\nhair--placed out there in the sea, the wind, against the vague mists. He\r\nstopped once more to look around. And suddenly, as though at some\r\nrecollection, some impulse, with one hand on his hip he turned the upper\r\npart of his body in a beautiful twist which began from the base--and he\r\nlooked over his shoulder towards the shore. The watcher sat there, as he\r\nhad sat once before when for the first time these twilight-grey eyes had\r\nturned at the doorway and met his own. His head, against the back of the\r\nchair, had slowly followed the movements of the boy walking yonder. Now,\r\nsimultaneously with this glance it rose and sank on his breast, so that\r\nhis eyes looked out from underneath, while his face took on the loose,\r\ninwardly relaxed expression of deep sleep. But it seemed to him as\r\nthough the pale and lovely lure out there were smiling to him, nodding\r\nto him; as though, removing his hand from his hip, he were signalling to\r\ncome out, were vaguely guiding towards egregious promises. And, as often\r\nbefore, he stood up to follow him.\r\n\r\nSome minutes passed before any one hurried to the aid of the man who had\r\ncollapsed into one corner of his chair. He was brought to his room. And\r\non the same day a respectfully shocked world received the news of his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The End_\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DEATH IN VENICE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
