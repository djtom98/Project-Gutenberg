Loewenstein, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINDA TRESSEL\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\nANTHONY TROLLOPE\r\n\r\nFirst published anonymously in serial form October, 1867,\r\nthrough May, 1868, in _Blackwood\'s Magazine_ and in book form\r\nin 1868. Trollope\'s authorship was acknowledged when the book\r\nwas re-published a decade later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nThe troubles and sorrows of Linda Tressel, who is the heroine of the\r\nlittle story now about to be told, arose from the too rigid virtue\r\nof her nearest and most loving friend,--as troubles will sometimes\r\ncome from rigid virtue when rigid virtue is not accompanied by sound\r\nsense, and especially when it knows little or nothing of the softness\r\nof mercy.\r\n\r\nThe nearest and dearest friend of Linda Tressel was her aunt, the\r\nwidow Staubach--Madame Charlotte Staubach, as she had come to be\r\ncalled in the little town of Nuremberg where she lived. In Nuremberg\r\nall houses are picturesque, but you shall go through the entire city\r\nand find no more picturesque abode than the small red house with the\r\nthree gables close down by the river-side in the Sch\xfctt island--the\r\nlittle island made by the river Pegnitz in the middle of the town.\r\nThey who have seen the widow Staubach\'s house will have remembered\r\nit, not only because of its bright colour and its sharp gables,\r\nbut also because of the garden which runs between the house and\r\nthe water\'s edge. And yet the garden was no bigger than may often\r\nnowadays be seen in the balconies of the mansions of Paris and of\r\nLondon. Here Linda Tressel lived with her aunt, and here also Linda\r\nhad been born.\r\n\r\nLinda was the orphan of Herr Tressel, who had for many years been\r\nwhat we may call town-clerk to the magistrates of Nuremberg. Chance\r\nin middle life had taken him to Cologne--a German city indeed, as was\r\nhis own, but a city so far away from Nuremberg that its people and\r\nits manners were as strange to him as though he had gone beyond the\r\nreach of his own mother-tongue. But here he had married, and from\r\nCologne had brought home his bride to the picturesque, red, gabled\r\nhouse by the water\'s side in his own city. His wife\'s only sister had\r\nalso married, in her own town; and that sister was the virtuous but\r\nrigid aunt Charlotte, to live with whom had been the fate in life of\r\nLinda Tressel.\r\n\r\nIt need not be more than told in the fewest words that the town-clerk\r\nand the town-clerk\'s wife both died when Linda was but an infant, and\r\nthat the husband of her aunt Charlotte died also. In Nuremberg there\r\nis no possession so much coveted and so dearly loved as that of the\r\nhouse in which the family lives. Herr Tressel had owned the house\r\nwith the three gables, and so had his father before him, and to the\r\nfather it had come from an uncle whose name had been different,--and\r\nto him from some other relative. But it was an old family property,\r\nand, like other houses in Nuremberg, was to be kept in the hands of\r\nthe family while the family might remain, unless some terrible ruin\r\nshould supervene.\r\n\r\nWhen Linda was but six years old, her aunt, the widow, came to\r\nNuremberg to inhabit the house which the Tressels had left as an only\r\nlegacy to their daughter; but it was understood when she did so that\r\na right of living in the house for the remainder of her days was to\r\nbelong to Madame Staubach because of the surrender she thus made\r\nof whatever of a home was then left to her in Cologne. There was\r\nprobably no deed executed to this effect; nor would it have been\r\nthought that any deed was necessary. Should Linda Tressel, when\r\nyears had rolled on, be taken as a wife, and should the husband\r\nlive in the red house, there would still be room for Linda\'s aunt.\r\nAnd by no husband in Nuremberg, who should be told that such an\r\narrangement had been anticipated, would such an arrangement be\r\nopposed. Mothers-in-law, aunts, maiden sisters, and dependent female\r\nrelatives, in all degrees, are endured with greater patience and\r\ntreated with a gentler hand in patient Bavaria than in some lands\r\nfarther west where life is faster, and in which men\'s shoulders\r\nare more easily galled by slight burdens. And as poor little Linda\r\nTressel had no other possession but the house, as all other income,\r\nslight as it might be, was to be brought with her by aunt Charlotte,\r\naunt Charlotte had at least a right to the free use of the roof over\r\nher head. It is necessary that so much should be told; but Linda\'s\r\ntroubles did not come from the divided right which she had in her\r\nfather\'s house. Linda\'s troubles, as has before been said, sprang not\r\nfrom her aunt\'s covetousness, but from her aunt\'s virtue--perhaps we\r\nmight more truly say, from her aunt\'s religion.\r\n\r\nNuremberg is one of those German cities in which a stranger finds it\r\ndifficult to understand the religious idiosyncrasies of the people.\r\nIt is in Bavaria, and Bavaria, as he knows, is Roman Catholic. But\r\nNuremberg is Protestant, and the stranger, when he visits the two\r\ncathedrals--those of St. Sebald and St. Lawrence--finds it hard to\r\nbelieve that they should not be made to resound with masses, so like\r\nare they in all respects to other Romanist cathedrals which he has\r\nseen. But he is told that they are Lutheran and Protestant, and he\r\nis obliged to make himself aware that the prevailing religion of\r\nNuremberg is Lutheran, in spite of what to him are the Catholic\r\nappearances of the churches. Now the widow Staubach was among\r\nProtestants the most Protestant, going far beyond the ordinary\r\namenities of Lutheran teaching, as at present taught, in her\r\nreligious observances, her religious loves, and her religious\r\nantipathies. The ordinary Lutheran of the German cities does not wear\r\nhis religion very conspicuously. It is not a trouble to him in his\r\ndaily life, causing him to live in terror as to the life to come.\r\nThat it is a comfort to him let us not doubt. But it has not on him\r\ngenerally that outward, ever palpable, unmistakable effect, making\r\nits own of his gait, his countenance, his garb, his voice, his words,\r\nhis eyes, his thoughts, his clothes, his very sneeze, his cough, his\r\nsighs, his groans, which is the result of Calvinistic impressions\r\nthoroughly brought home to the mind and lovingly entertained in the\r\nheart. Madame Staubach was in truth a German Anabaptist, but it will\r\nbe enough for us to say that her manners and gait were the manners\r\nand gait of a Calvinist.\r\n\r\nWhile Linda Tressel was a child she hardly knew that her aunt was\r\npeculiar in her religious ideas. That mode of life which comes to a\r\nchild comes naturally, and Linda, though she was probably not allowed\r\nto play as freely as did the other bairns around her, though she\r\nwas taken more frequently to the house of worship which her aunt\r\nfrequented, and targed more strictly in the reading of godly books,\r\ndid not know till she was a child no longer, that she was subjected\r\nto harder usage than others endured. But when Linda was eleven, the\r\nwidow was persuaded by a friend that it was her duty to send her\r\nniece to school; and when Linda at sixteen ceased to be a school\r\ngirl, she had learned to think that the religion of her aunt\'s\r\nneighbours was a more comfortable religion than that practised by\r\nher aunt; and when she was eighteen, she had further learned to\r\nthink that the life of certain neighbour girls was a pleasanter life\r\nthan her own. When she was twenty, she had studied the subject more\r\ndeeply, and had told herself that though her spirit was prone to\r\nrebel against her aunt, that though she would fain have been allowed\r\nto do as did other girls of twenty, yet she knew her aunt to be a\r\ngood woman, and knew that it behoved her to obey. Had not her aunt\r\ncome all the way from Cologne, from the distant city of Rhenish\r\nPrussia, to live in Nuremberg for her sake, and should she be\r\nunfaithful and rebellious? Now Madame Staubach understood and\r\nappreciated the proneness to rebellion in her niece\'s heart, but did\r\nnot quite understand, and perhaps could not appreciate, the attempt\r\nto put down that rebellion which the niece was ever making from day\r\nto day.\r\n\r\nI have said that the widow Staubach had brought with her to Nuremberg\r\nsome income upon which to live in the red house with the three\r\ngables. Some small means of her own she possessed, some few hundred\r\nflorins a-year, which were remitted to her punctually from Cologne;\r\nbut this would not have sufficed even for the moderate wants of\r\nherself, her niece, and of the old maid Tetchen, who lived with them,\r\nand who had lived with Linda\'s mother. But there was a source of\r\nincome very ready to the widow\'s hand, and of which it was a matter\r\nof course that she should in her circumstances avail herself. She and\r\nher niece could not fill the family home, and a portion of it was let\r\nto a lodger. This lodger was Herr Steinmarc--Peter Steinmarc, who had\r\nbeen clerk to Linda\'s father when Linda\'s father had been clerk to\r\nthe city magistrates, and who was now clerk to the city magistrates\r\nhimself. Peter Steinmarc in the old days had inhabited a garret in\r\nthe house, and had taken his meals at his master\'s table; but now the\r\nfirst floor of the house was his own, the big airy pleasant chamber\r\nlooking out from under one gable on to the clear water, and the broad\r\npassage under the middle gable, and the square large bedroom--the\r\nroom in which Linda had been born--under the third gable. The windows\r\nfrom these apartments all looked out on to the slow-flowing but clear\r\nstream, which ran so close below them that the town-clerk might have\r\nsat and fished from his windows had he been so minded; for there was\r\nno road there--only the narrow slip of a garden no broader than a\r\nbalcony. And opposite, beyond the river, where the road ran, there\r\nwas a broad place,--the Ruden Platz; and every house surrounding this\r\nwas picturesque with different colours, and with many gables, and the\r\npoints of the houses rose up in sharp pyramids, of which every brick\r\nand every tile was in its place, sharp, clear, well formed, and\r\nappropriate, in those very inches of space which each was called upon\r\nto fill. For in Nuremberg it is the religion of the community that\r\nno house shall fall into decay, that no form of city beauty shall be\r\nallowed to vanish, that nothing of picturesque antiquity shall be\r\nchanged. From age to age, though stones and bricks are changed, the\r\nbuildings are the same, and the medieval forms remain, delighting the\r\ntaste of the traveller as they do the pride of the burgher. Thus it\r\nwas that Herr Steinmarc, the clerk of the magistrates in Nuremberg,\r\nhad for his use as pleasant an abode as the city could furnish him.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass that, during the many years of their residence\r\nbeneath the same roof, there grew up a strong feeling of friendship\r\nbetween Peter Steinmarc and the widow Staubach, so strong that in\r\nmost worldly matters the widow would be content to follow her friend\r\nPeter\'s counsels without hesitation. And this was the case although\r\nPeter by no means lived in accordance with the widow\'s tenets as to\r\nmatters of religion. It is not to be understood that Peter was a\r\ngodless man,--not so especially, or that he lived a life in any way\r\nscandalous, or open to special animadversion from the converted; but\r\nhe was a man of the world, very fond of money, very fond of business,\r\ndoing no more in the matter of worship than is done ordinarily by men\r\nof the world,--one who would not scruple to earn a few gulden on the\r\nSunday if such earning came in his way, who liked his beer and his\r\npipe, and, above all things, liked the fees and perquisites of office\r\non which he lived and made his little wealth. But though thus worldly\r\nhe was esteemed much by Madame Staubach, who rarely, on his behalf,\r\nput forth that voice of warning which was so frequently heard by her\r\nniece.\r\n\r\nBut there are women of the class to which Madame Staubach belonged\r\nwho think that the acerbities of religion are intended altogether for\r\ntheir own sex. That men ought to be grateful to them who will deny?\r\nSuch women seem to think that Heaven will pardon that hardness of\r\nheart which it has created in man, and which the affairs of the world\r\nseem almost to require; but that it will extend no such forgiveness\r\nto the feminine creation. It may be necessary that a man should be\r\nstiff-necked, self-willed, eager on the world, perhaps even covetous\r\nand given to worldly lusts. But for a woman, it behoves her to crush\r\nherself, so that she may be at all points submissive, self-denying,\r\nand much-suffering. She should be used to thorns in the flesh, and to\r\nthorns in the spirit too. Whatever may be the thing she wants, that\r\nthing she should not have. And if it be so that, in her feminine\r\nweakness, she be not able to deny herself, there should be those\r\naround her to do the denial for her. Let her crush herself as it\r\nbecomes a poor female to do, or let there be some other female to\r\ncrush her if she lack the strength, the purity, and the religious\r\nfervour which such self-crushing requires. Poor Linda Tressel had not\r\nmuch taste for crushing herself, but Providence had supplied her with\r\none who had always been willing to do that work for her. And yet the\r\naunt had ever dearly loved her niece, and dearly loved her now in\r\nthese days of our story. If your eye offend you, shall you not pluck\r\nit out? After a sort Madame Staubach was plucking out her own eye\r\nwhen she led her niece such a life of torment as will be described in\r\nthese pages.\r\n\r\nWhen Linda was told one day by Tetchen the old servant that there was\r\na marriage on foot between Herr Steinmarc and aunt Charlotte, Linda\r\nexpressed her disbelief in very strong terms. When Tetchen produced\r\nmany arguments to show why it should be so, and put aside as of no\r\navail all the reasons given by Linda to show that such a marriage\r\ncould hardly be intended, Linda was still incredulous. "You do not\r\nknow aunt Charlotte, Tetchen;--not as I do." said Linda.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve lived in the same house with her for fourteen years," said\r\nTetchen, angrily.\r\n\r\n"And yet you do not know her. I am sure she will not marry Peter\r\nSteinmarc. She will never marry anybody. She does not think of such\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said Tetchen; "all women think of them. Their heads are\r\nalways together, and Peter talks as though he meant to be master of\r\nthe house, and he tells her everything about Ludovic. I heard them\r\ntalking about Ludovic for the hour together the other night."\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t listen, Tetchen."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t listen, miss. But when one is in and out one cannot stop\r\none\'s ears. I hope there isn\'t going to be anything wrong between \'em\r\nabout the house."\r\n\r\n"My aunt will never do anything wrong, and my aunt will never marry\r\nPeter Steinmarc." So Linda declared in her aunt\'s defence, and in her\r\nlatter assertion she was certainly right. Madame Staubach was not\r\nminded to marry Herr Steinmarc; but she might have done so had she\r\nwished it, for Herr Steinmarc asked her to take him more than once.\r\n\r\nAt this time the widow Staubach was a woman not much over forty years\r\nof age; and though it can hardly be said she was comely, yet she\r\nwas not without a certain prettiness which might have charms in the\r\njudgment of Herr Steinmarc. She was very thin, and her face was pale,\r\nand here and there was the beginning of a wrinkle telling as much\r\nof trouble as of years; but her eyes were bright and clear, and her\r\nsmooth hair, of which but the edge was allowed to be seen beneath her\r\ncap, was of as rich a brown as when she had married Gasper Staubach,\r\nnow more than twenty years ago; and her teeth were white and perfect,\r\nand the oval of her face had not been impaired by time, and her step,\r\nthough slow, was light and firm, and her voice, though sad, was low\r\nand soft. In talking to men--to such a man as was Herr Steinmarc--her\r\nvoice was always low and soft, though there would be a sharp note in\r\nit now and again when she would be speaking to Tetchen or her niece.\r\nWhether it was her gentle voice, or her bright eyes, or the edge of\r\nsoft brown hair beneath her cap, or some less creditable feeling\r\nof covetousness in regard to the gabled house in the Sch\xfctt island,\r\nshall not here be even guessed; but it was the fact that Herr\r\nSteinmarc had more than once asked Madame Staubach to be his wife\r\nwhen Tetchen first imparted her suspicion to Linda.\r\n\r\n"And what were they saying about Ludovic?" asked Linda, when\r\nTetchen, for the third time came to Linda with her tidings. Now\r\nLinda had scolded Tetchen for listening to her aunt\'s conversation\r\nabout Ludovic, and Tetchen thought it unjust that she should be\r\ninterrogated on the subject after being so treated.\r\n\r\n"I told you, miss, I didn\'t hear anything;--only just the name."\r\n\r\n"Very well, Tetchen; that will do; only I hope you won\'t say such\r\nthings of aunt Charlotte anywhere else."\r\n\r\n"What harm have I said, Linda? surely to say of a widow that she\'s to\r\nbe married to an honest man is not to say harm."\r\n\r\n"But it is not true, Tetchen; and you should not say it." Then\r\nTetchen departed quite unconvinced, and Linda began to reflect how\r\nfar her life would be changed for the better or for the worse, if\r\nTetchen\'s tidings should ever be made true. But, as has been said\r\nbefore, Tetchen\'s tidings were never to be made true.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Staubach did not resent the offer made to her. When Peter\r\nSteinmarc told her that she was a lone woman, left without guidance\r\nor protection, she allowed the fact, admitting that guidance would be\r\ngood for her. When he went on to say that Linda also was in need of\r\nprotection, she admitted that also. "She is in sore need," Madame\r\nStaubach said, "the poor thoughtless child." And when Herr Steinmarc\r\nspoke of her pecuniary condition, reminding the widow that were she\r\nleft without the lodger the two women could hardly keep the old\r\nfamily roof over their head, Madame Staubach acknowledged it all, and\r\nperhaps went very suddenly to the true point by expressing an opinion\r\nthat everything would be much better arranged if the house were the\r\nproperty of Herr Steinmarc himself. "It isn\'t good that women should\r\nown houses," said Madame Staubach; "it should be enough for them\r\nthat they are permitted to use them." Then Herr Steinmarc went on\r\nto explain that if the widow would consent to become his wife, he\r\nthought he could so settle things that for their lives, at any rate,\r\nthe house should be in his care and management. But the widow would\r\nnot consent even to speak of such an arrangement as possible. She\r\nspoke a word, with a tear in her eye, of the human lord and master\r\nwho had lived with her for two happy years, and said another word\r\nwith some mystical allusion to a heavenly husband; and after that\r\nHerr Steinmarc felt that he could not plead his cause further with\r\nany hope of success. "But why should not Linda be your wife?" said\r\nMadame Staubach, as her disappointed suitor was about to retire.\r\n\r\nThe idea had never struck the man\'s mind before, and now, when the\r\nsuggestion was made to him, he was for a while stricken dumb. Why\r\nshould he not marry Linda Tressel, the niece; gay, pretty, young,\r\nsweet as youth and prettiness and gaiety could make her, a girl than\r\nwhom there was none prettier, none sweeter, in all Nuremberg--and\r\nthe real owner, too, of the house in which he lived,--instead of the\r\naunt, who was neither gay, nor sweet, nor young; who, though she\r\nwas virtuous, self-denying, and meek, possessed certainly but few\r\nfeminine charms? Herr Steinmarc, though he was a man not by any means\r\nliving outside the pale of the Church to which he belonged, was not\r\nso strongly given to religious observances as to have preferred the\r\naunt because of her piety and sanctity of life. He was not hypocrite\r\nenough to suggest to Madame Staubach that any such feeling warmed his\r\nbosom. Why should not Linda be his wife? He sat himself down again\r\nin the arm-chair from which he had risen, and began to consider the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Herr Steinmarc was at this time nearly fifty\r\nyears old, and Linda Tressel was only twenty. He knew Linda\'s age\r\nwell, for he had been an inhabitant of the garret up-stairs when\r\nLinda was born. What would the Frau Tressel have said that night had\r\nany one prophesied to her that her little daughter would hereafter\r\nbe offered as a wife to her husband\'s penniless clerk upstairs? But\r\npenniless clerks often live to fill their masters\' shoes, and do\r\nsometimes marry their masters\' daughters. And then Linda was known\r\nthroughout Nuremberg to be the real owner of the house with the three\r\ngables, and Herr Steinmarc had an idea that the Nuremberg magistrates\r\nwould rise up against him were he to offer to marry the young\r\nheiress. And there was a third difficulty: Herr Steinmarc, though he\r\nhad no knowledge on the subject, though his suspicions were so slight\r\nthat he had never mentioned them to his old friend the widow, though\r\nhe was aware that he had barely a ground for the idea, still had\r\nan idea, that Linda Tressel\'s heart was no longer at Linda\'s own\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless the momentous question which had been so suddenly\r\nasked him was one which certainly deserved the closest consideration.\r\nIt showed him, at any rate, that Linda\'s nearest friend would help\r\nhim were he inclined to prosecute such a suit, and that she saw\r\nnothing out of course, nothing anomalous, in the proposition.\r\nIt would be very nice to be the husband of a pretty, gay,\r\nsweet-tempered, joyous young girl. It would be very nice to marry the\r\nheiress of the house, and to become its actual owner and master, and\r\nit would be nice also to be preferred to him of whom Peter Steinmarc\r\nhad thought as the true possessor of Linda\'s heart. If Linda were\r\nonce his wife, Linda, he did not doubt, would be true to him. In such\r\ncase Linda, whom he knew to be a good girl, would overcome any little\r\nprejudice of her girlhood. Other men of fifty had married girls\r\nof twenty, and why should not he, Peter Steinmarc, the well-to-do,\r\ncomfortable, and, considering his age, good-looking town-clerk of the\r\ncity of Nuremberg? He could not bring himself to tell Madame Staubach\r\nthat he would transfer his affections to her niece on that occasion\r\non which the question was first asked. He would take a week, he said,\r\nto consider. He took the week; but made up his mind on the first day\r\nof the week, and at the end of the week declared to Madame Staubach\r\nthat he thought the plan to be a good plan.\r\n\r\nAfter that there was much discussion before any further step was\r\ntaken, and Tetchen was quite sure that their lodger was to be married\r\nto Linda\'s aunt. There was much discussion, and the widow, shocked,\r\nperhaps, at her own cruelty, almost retreated from the offer she had\r\nmade. But Herr Steinmarc was emboldened, and was now eager, and held\r\nher to her own plan. It was a good plan, and he was ready. He found\r\nthat he could love the maiden, and he wished to take her to his bosom\r\nat once. For a few days the widow\'s heart relented; for a few days\r\nthere came across her breast a frail, foolish, human idea of love\r\nand passion, and the earthly joy of two young beings, happy in\r\neach other\'s arms. For a while she thought with regret of what she\r\nwas about to do, of the sacrifice to be made, of the sorrow to be\r\nendured, of the deathblow to be given to those dreams of love, which\r\ndoubtless had arisen, though hitherto they were no more than dreams.\r\nMadame Staubach, though she was now a saint, had been once a woman,\r\nand knew as well as any woman of what nature are the dreams of love\r\nwhich fill the heart of a girl. It was because she knew them so well,\r\nthat she allowed herself only a few hours of such weakness. What!\r\nshould she hesitate between heaven and hell, between God and devil,\r\nbetween this world and the next, between sacrifice of time and\r\nsacrifice of eternity, when the disposal of her own niece, her own\r\nchild, her nearest and dearest, was concerned? Was it not fit that\r\nthe world should be crushed in the bosom of a young girl? and how\r\ncould it be crushed so effectually as by marrying her to an old man,\r\none whom she respected, but who was otherwise distasteful to her--one\r\nwho, as a husband, would at first be abhorrent to her? As Madame\r\nStaubach thought of heaven then, a girl who loved and was allowed to\r\nindulge her love could hardly go to heaven. "Let it be so," she said\r\nto Peter Steinmarc after a few days of weak vacillation,--"let it be\r\nso. I think that it will be good for her." Then Peter Steinmarc swore\r\nthat it would be good for Linda--that it should be good for Linda.\r\nHis care should be so great that Linda might never doubt the good.\r\n"Peter Steinmarc, I am thinking of her soul," said Madame Staubach.\r\n"I am thinking of that too," said Peter; "one has, you know, to think\r\nof everything in turns."\r\n\r\nThen there came to be a little difficulty as to the manner in which\r\nthe proposition should be first made to Linda Tressel. Madame\r\nStaubach thought that it should be made by Peter himself, but Peter\r\nwas of opinion that if the ice were first broken by Madame Staubach,\r\nfinal success might be more probably achieved. "She owes you\r\nobedience, my friend, and she owes me none, as yet," said Peter.\r\nThere seemed to be so much of truth in this that Madame Staubach\r\nyielded, and undertook to make the first overture to Linda on behalf\r\nof her lover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nLinda Tressel was a tall, light-built, active young woman, in full\r\nhealth, by no means a fine lady, very able and very willing to assist\r\nTetchen in the work of the house, or rather to be assisted by Tetchen\r\nin doing it, and fit at all points to be the wife of any young\r\nburgher in Nuremberg. And she was very pretty withal, with eager,\r\nspeaking eyes, and soft luxurious tresses, not black, but of so very\r\ndark a brown as to be counted black in some lights. It was her aunt\'s\r\ncare to have these tresses confined, so that nothing of their wayward\r\nobstinacy in curling might be seen by the eyes of men; and Linda\r\nstrove to obey her aunt, but the curls would sometimes be too strong\r\nfor Linda, and would be seen over her shoulders and across her back,\r\ntempting the eyes of men sorely. Peter Steinmarc had so seen them\r\nmany a time, and thought much of them when the offer of Linda\'s hand\r\nwas first made to him. Her face, like that of her aunt, was oval in\r\nits form, and her complexion was dark and clear. But perhaps her\r\ngreatest beauty consisted in the half-soft, half-wild expression of\r\nher face, which, while it seemed to declare to the world that she was\r\nmild, gentle, and, for the most part, silent, gave a vague, doubtful\r\npromise of something that might be beyond, if only her nature were\r\nsufficiently awakened, creating a hope and mysterious longing for\r\nsomething more than might be expected from a girl brought up under\r\nthe severe thraldom of Madame Charlotte Staubach,--creating a hope,\r\nor perhaps it might be a fear. And Linda\'s face in this respect was\r\nthe true reflex of her character. She lived with her aunt a quiet,\r\nindustrious, sober life, striving to be obedient, striving to be\r\nreligious with the religion of her aunt. She had almost brought\r\nherself to believe that it was good for her heart to be crushed. She\r\nhad quite brought herself to wish to believe it. She had within her\r\nheart no desire for open rebellion against domestic authority. The\r\nworld was a dangerous, bad world, in which men were dust and women\r\nsomething lower than dust. She would tell herself so very often, and\r\nstrive to believe herself when she did so. But, for all this, there\r\nwas a yearning for something beyond her present life, for something\r\nthat should be of the world, worldly. When she heard profane music\r\nshe would long to dance. When she heard the girls laughing in the\r\npublic gardens she would long to stay and laugh with them. Pretty\r\nribbons and bright-coloured silks were a snare to her. When she\r\ncould shake out her curly locks in the retirement of her own little\r\nchamber, she liked to feel them and to know that they were pretty.\r\n\r\nBut these were the wiles with which the devil catches the souls of\r\nwomen, and there were times when she believed that the devil was\r\nmaking an especial struggle to possess himself of her. There were\r\nmoments in which she almost thought that the devil would succeed,\r\nand that, perhaps, it was but of little use for her to carry on any\r\nlonger the futile contest. Would it not be pleasant to give up the\r\ncontest, and to laugh and talk and shout and be merry, to dance, and\r\nwear bright colours, and be gay in company with young men, as did the\r\nother girls around her? As for those other girls, their elder friends\r\ndid not seem on their account to be specially in dread of Satan.\r\nThere was Fanny Heisse who lived close to them, who had been Linda\'s\r\nfriend when they went to school together. Fanny did just as she\r\npleased, was always talking with young men, wore the brightest\r\nribbons that the shops produced, was always dancing, seemed to be\r\nbound by no strict rules on life; and yet everybody spoke well of\r\nFanny Heisse, and now Fanny was to be married to a young lawyer from\r\nAugsburg. Could it be the fact that the devil had made sure of Fanny\r\nHeisse? Linda had been very anxious to ask her aunt a question on\r\nthat subject, but had been afraid. Whenever she attempted to discuss\r\nany point of theology with her aunt, such attempts always ended in\r\nrenewed assurances of the devil\'s greediness, and in some harder,\r\nmore crushing rule by which the devil\'s greed might be outwitted.\r\n\r\nThen there came a time of terrible peril, and poor Linda was in\r\ngreater doubt than ever. Fanny Heisse, who was to be married to\r\nthe Augsburg lawyer, had long been accustomed to talk to young men,\r\nto one young man after another, so that young men had come to be\r\nalmost nothing to her. She had selected one as her husband because\r\nit had been suggested to her that she had better settle herself in\r\nlife; and this special one was well-to-do, and good-looking, and\r\npleasant-mannered, and good-tempered. The whole thing with Fanny\r\nHeisse had seemed to go as though flirting, love, and marriage\r\nall came naturally, without danger, without care, and without\r\ndisappointment. But a young man had now spoken to her, to Linda,--had\r\nspoken to her words that she did not dare to repeat to any one,--had\r\nspoken to her twice, thrice, and she had not rebuked him. She had\r\nnot, at least, rebuked him with that withering scorn which the\r\ncircumstances had surely required, and which would have made him know\r\nthat she regarded him as one sent purposely from the Evil One to\r\ntempt her. Now again had come upon her some terrible half-formed idea\r\nthat it would be well to give up the battle and let the Evil One\r\nmake free with his prey. But, in truth, her heart within her had so\r\npalpitated with emotion when these words had been spoken and been\r\nrepeated, that she had lacked the strength to carry on the battle\r\nproperly. How send a daring young man from you with withering scorn,\r\nwhen there lacks power to raise the eyes, to open or to close the\r\nlips, to think even at the moment whether such scorn is deserved, or\r\nsomething very different from scorn?\r\n\r\nThe young man had not been seen by Linda\'s eyes for nearly a month,\r\nwhen Peter Steinmarc and Madam Staubach settled between them that\r\nthe ice should be broken. On the following morning aunt Charlotte\r\nprepared herself for the communication to be made, and, when she came\r\nin from her market purchases, went at once to her task. Linda was\r\nfound by her aunt in their lodger\'s sitting-room, busy with brooms\r\nand brushes, while Tetchen on her knees was dry-rubbing the polished\r\nboard round the broad margin of the room. "Linda," said Madame\r\nStaubach, "I have that which I wish to say to you; would you come\r\nwith me for a while?" Then Linda followed her aunt to Madame\r\nStaubach\'s own chamber, and as she went there came over her a guilty\r\nfear. Could it be that her aunt had heard of the words which the\r\nyoung man had spoken to her?\r\n\r\n"Linda," said Madame Staubach, "sit down,--there, in my chair. I\r\nhave a proposition to make to you of much importance,--of very great\r\nimportance. May the Lord grant that the thing that I do shall be\r\nright in His sight!"\r\n\r\n"To make to me, aunt?" said Linda, now quite astray as to her aunt\'s\r\nintention. She was sure, at least, that there was no danger about the\r\nyoung man. Had it been her aunt\'s purpose to rebuke her for aught\r\nthat she had done, her aunt\'s manner and look would have been very\r\ndifferent,--would have been hard, severe, and full of denunciation.\r\nAs it was, Madame Staubach almost hesitated in her words, and\r\ncertainly had assumed much less than her accustomed austerity.\r\n\r\n"I hope, Linda, that you know that I love you."\r\n\r\n"I am sure that you love me, aunt Charlotte. But why do you ask me?"\r\n\r\n"If there be any one in this world that I do love, it is you, my\r\nchild. Who else is there left to me? Were it not for you, the world\r\nwith all its troubles would be nothing to me, and I could prepare\r\nmyself to go in peace when He should be pleased to take me."\r\n\r\n"But why do you say this now, aunt Charlotte?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell you why I say it now. Though I am hardly an old woman\r\nyet--"\r\n\r\n"Of course you are not an old woman."\r\n\r\n"I wish I were older, that I might be nearer to my rest. But you are\r\nyoung, and it is necessary that your future life should be regarded.\r\nWhether I go hence or remain here it will be proper that some\r\nsettlement should be made for you." Then Madame Staubach paused, and\r\nLinda began to think that her aunt had on her mind some scheme about\r\nthe house. When her aunt had spoken of going hence or remaining here,\r\nLinda had not been quite sure whether the goings and remainings\r\nspoken of were wholly spiritual or whether there was any reference to\r\nthings worldly and temporal. Could it be that Tetchen was after all\r\nright in her surmise? Was it possible that her aunt was about to be\r\nmarried to Peter Steinmarc? But she said nothing; and after a while\r\nher aunt went on very slowly with her proposition. "Yes, Linda, some\r\nsettlement for your future life should be made. You know that the\r\nhouse in which we live is your own."\r\n\r\n"It is yours and mine together, aunt."\r\n\r\n"No, Linda; the house is your own. And the furniture in it is yours\r\ntoo; so that Herr Steinmarc is your lodger. It is right that you\r\nshould understand all this; but I think too well of my own child to\r\nbelieve that she will ever on that account be disobedient or unruly."\r\n\r\n"That will never make a difference."\r\n\r\n"No, Linda; I am sure it will not. Providence has been pleased to put\r\nme in the place of both father and mother to you. I will not say that\r\nI have done my duty by you--"\r\n\r\n"You have, aunt, always," said Linda, taking her aunt\'s hand and\r\npressing it affectionately.\r\n\r\n"But I have found, and I expect to find, a child\'s obedience. It is\r\ngood that the young should obey their elders, and should understand\r\nthat those in authority over them should know better than they can do\r\nthemselves what is good for them." Linda was now altogether astray in\r\nher thoughts and anticipations. Her aunt had very frequently spoken\r\nto her in this strain; nay, a week did not often pass by without such\r\na speech. But then the speeches would come without the solemn prelude\r\nwhich had been made on this occasion, and would be caused generally\r\nby some act or word or look or movement on the part of Linda of which\r\nMadame Staubach had found herself obliged to express disapprobation.\r\nOn the present occasion the conversation had been commenced without\r\nany such expression. Her aunt had even deigned to commend the general\r\ntenor of her life. She had dropped the hand as soon as her aunt began\r\nto talk of those in authority, and waited with patience till the gist\r\nof the lecture should be revealed to her. "I hope you will understand\r\nthis now, Linda. That which I shall propose to you is for your\r\nwelfare, here and hereafter, even though it may not at first seem to\r\nyou to be agreeable."\r\n\r\n"What is it, aunt?" said Linda, jumping up quickly from her seat.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, my child, and I will tell you." But Linda did not reseat\r\nherself at once. Some terrible fear had come upon her,--some fear\r\nof she knew not what,--and she found it to be almost impossible to\r\nremain quiet at her aunt\'s knee. "Sit down, Linda, when I ask you."\r\nThen Linda did sit down; but she had altogether lost that look of\r\nquiet, passive endurance which her face and figure had borne when she\r\nwas first asked to listen to her aunt\'s words. "The time in your life\r\nhas come, my dear, when I as your guardian have to think whether it\r\nis not well that you should be--married."\r\n\r\n"But I do not want to be married," said Linda, jumping up again.\r\n\r\n"My dearest child, it would be better that you should listen to me.\r\nMarriage, you know, is an honourable state."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know, of course. But, aunt Charlotte--"\r\n\r\n"Hush, my dear."\r\n\r\n"A girl need not be married unless she likes."\r\n\r\n"If I were dead, with whom would you live? Who would there be to\r\nguard you and guide you?"\r\n\r\n"But you are not going to die."\r\n\r\n"Linda, that is very wicked."\r\n\r\n"And why can I not guide myself?"\r\n\r\n"Because you are young, and weak, and foolish. Because it is right\r\nthat they who are frail, and timid, and spiritless, should be made\r\nsubject to those who are strong and able to hold dominion and to\r\nexact obedience." Linda did not at all like being told that she was\r\nspiritless. She thought that she might be able to show spirit enough\r\nwere it not for the duty that she owed to her aunt. And as for\r\nobedience, though she were willing to obey her aunt, she felt that\r\nher aunt had no right to transfer her privilege in that respect\r\nto another. But she said nothing, and her aunt went on with her\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n"Our lodger, Peter Steinmarc, has spoken to me, and he is anxious to\r\nmake you his wife."\r\n\r\n"Peter Steinmarc!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Linda; Peter Steinmarc."\r\n\r\n"Old Peter Steinmarc!"\r\n\r\n"He is not old. What has his being old to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"I will never marry Peter Steinmarc, aunt Charlotte."\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach had not expected to meet with immediate and positive\r\nobedience. She had thought it probable that there might be some\r\nopposition shown to her plan when it was first brought forward.\r\nIndeed, how could it be otherwise, when marriage was suggested\r\nabruptly to such a girl as Linda Tressel, even though the suggested\r\nhusband had been an Apollo? What young woman could have said,\r\n"Oh, certainly; whenever you please, aunt Charlotte," to such a\r\nproposition? Feeling this, Madame Staubach would have gone to work by\r\ndegrees,--would have opened her siege by gradual trenches, and have\r\napproached the citadel by parallels, before she attempted to take\r\nit by storm, had she known anything of the ways and forms of such\r\nstrategy. But though she knew that there were such ways and forms of\r\nstrategy among the ungodly, out in the world with the worldly, she\r\nhad practised none such herself, and knew nothing of the mode in\r\nwhich they should be conducted. On this subject, if on any, her niece\r\nowed to her obedience, and she would claim that obedience as hers of\r\nright. Though Linda would at first be startled, she would probably be\r\nnot the less willing to obey at last, if she found her guardian stern\r\nand resolute in her demand. "My dear," she said, "you have probably\r\nnot yet had time to think of the marriage which I have proposed to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I want no time to think of it."\r\n\r\n"Nothing in life should be accepted or rejected without thinking,\r\nLinda,--nothing except sin; and thinking cannot be done without\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"This would be sin--a great sin!"\r\n\r\n"Linda, you are very wicked."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I am wicked."\r\n\r\n"Herr Steinmarc is a most respectable man. There is no man in all\r\nNuremberg more respected than Herr Steinmarc." This was doubtless\r\nMadame Staubach\'s opinion of Peter Steinmarc, but it may be that\r\nMadame Staubach was not qualified to express the opinion of the city\r\nin general on that subject. "He holds the office which your father\r\nheld before him, and for many years has inhabited the best rooms in\r\nyour father\'s house."\r\n\r\n"He is welcome to the rooms if he wants them," said Linda. "He is\r\nwelcome to the whole house if you choose to give it to him."\r\n\r\n"That is nonsense, Linda. Herr Steinmarc wants nothing that is not\r\nhis of right."\r\n\r\n"I am not his of right," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"Will you listen to me? You are much mistaken if you think that it is\r\nbecause of your trumpery house that this honest man wishes to make\r\nyou his wife." We must suppose that Madame Staubach suffered some\r\nqualm of conscience as she proffered this assurance, and that she\r\nrepented afterwards of the sin she committed in making a statement\r\nwhich she could hardly herself have believed to be exactly true. "He\r\nknew your father before you were born, and your mother; and he has\r\nknown me for many years. Has he not lived with us ever since you can\r\nremember?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Linda; "I remember him ever since I was a very little\r\ngirl,--as long as I can remember anything,--and he seemed to be as\r\nold then as he is now."\r\n\r\n"And why should he not be old? Why should you want a husband to be\r\nyoung and foolish and headstrong as you are yourself;--perhaps some\r\none who would drink and gamble and go about after strange women?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any man for a husband," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"There can be nothing more proper than that Herr Steinmarc should\r\nmake you his wife. He has spoken to me and he is willing to undertake\r\nthe charge."\r\n\r\n"The charge!" almost screamed Linda, in terrible disgust.\r\n\r\n"He is willing to undertake the charge, I say. We shall then still\r\nlive together, and may hope to be able to maintain a God-fearing\r\nhousehold, in which there may be as little opening to the temptations\r\nof the world as may be found in any well-ordered house."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe that Peter Steinmarc is a God-fearing man."\r\n\r\n"Linda, you are very wicked to say so."\r\n\r\n"But if he were, it would make no difference."\r\n\r\n"Linda!"\r\n\r\n"I only know that he loves his money better than anything in the\r\nworld, and that he never gives a kreutzer to any one, and that he\r\nwon\'t subscribe to the hospital, and he always thinks that Tetchen\r\ntakes his wine, though Tetchen never touches a drop."\r\n\r\n"When he has a wife she will look after these things."\r\n\r\n"I will never look after them," said Linda.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was brought to an end as soon after this as Madame\r\nStaubach was able to close it. She had done all that she had intended\r\nto do, and had done it with as much of good result as she had\r\nexpected. She had probably not thought that Linda would be quite so\r\nfierce as she had shown herself; but she had expected tears, and\r\nmore of despair, and a clearer protestation of abject misery in the\r\nproposed marriage. Linda\'s mind would now be filled with the idea,\r\nand probably she might by degrees reconcile herself to it, and learn\r\nto think that Peter was not so very old a man. At any rate it would\r\nnow be for Peter himself to carry on the battle.\r\n\r\nLinda, as soon as she was alone, sat down with her hands before her\r\nand with her eyes fixed, gazing on vacancy, in order that she might\r\nrealise to herself the thing proposed to her. She had said very\r\nlittle to her aunt of the nature of the misery which such a marriage\r\nseemed to offer to her,--not because her imagination made for her\r\nno clear picture on the subject, not because she did not foresee\r\nunutterable wretchedness in such a union. The picture of such\r\nwretchedness had been very palpable to her. She thought that no\r\nconsideration on earth would induce her to take that mean-faced old\r\nman to her breast as her husband, her lord--as the one being whom\r\nshe was to love beyond everybody else in this world. The picture was\r\nclear enough, but she had argued to herself, unconsciously, that any\r\ndescription of that picture to her aunt would seem to suppose that\r\nthe consummation of the picture was possible. She preferred therefore\r\nto declare that the thing was impossible,--an affair the completion\r\nof which would be quite out of the question. Instead of assuring her\r\naunt that it would have made her miserable to have to look after\r\nPeter Steinmarc\'s wine, she at once protested that she never would\r\ntake upon herself that duty. "I am not his of right," she had said;\r\nand as she said it, she resolved that she would adhere to that\r\nprotest. But when she was alone she remembered her aunt\'s demand, her\r\nown submissiveness, her old habits of obedience, and above all she\r\nremembered the fear that would come over her that she was giving\r\nherself to the devil in casting from her her obedience on such a\r\nsubject, and then she became very wretched. She told herself that\r\nsooner or later her aunt would conquer her, that sooner or later that\r\nmean-faced old man, with his snuffy fingers, and his few straggling\r\nhairs brushed over his bald pate, with his big shoes spreading here\r\nand there because of his corns, and his ugly, loose, square, snuffy\r\ncoat, and his old hat which he had worn so long that she never liked\r\nto touch it, would become her husband, and that it would be her\r\nduty to look after his wine, and his old shoes, and his old hat,\r\nand to have her own little possessions doled out to her by his\r\npenuriousness. Though she continued to swear to herself that heaven\r\nand earth together should never make her become Herr Steinmarc\'s\r\nwife, yet at the same time she continued to bemoan the certainty of\r\nher coming fate. If they were both against her--both, with the Lord\r\non their sides--how could she stand against them with nothing to aid\r\nher,--nothing, but the devil, and a few words spoken to her by one\r\nwhom hitherto she had never dared to answer?\r\n\r\nThe house in which Linda and Madame Staubach lived, of which the\r\nthree gables faced towards the river, and which came so close upon\r\nthe stream that there was but a margin six feet broad between the\r\nwall and the edge of the water, was approached by a narrow street\r\nor passage, which reached as far as the end of the house, where\r\nthere was a small gravelled court or open place, perhaps thirty feet\r\nsquare. Opposite to the door of the red house was the door of that\r\nin which lived Fanny Heisse with her father and mother. They indeed\r\nhad another opening into one of the streets of the town, which was\r\nnecessary, as Jacob Heisse was an upholsterer, and required an\r\nexit from his premises for chairs and tables. But to the red house\r\nwith the three gables there was no other approach than by the\r\nnarrow passage which ran between the river and the back of Heisse\'s\r\nworkshop. Thus the little courtyard was very private, and Linda could\r\nstand leaning on the wicket-gate which divided the little garden from\r\nthe court, without being subject to the charge of making herself\r\npublic to the passers-by. Not but what she might be seen when so\r\nstanding by those in the Ruden Platz on the other side of the river,\r\nas had often been pointed out to her by her aunt. But it was a habit\r\nwith her to stand there, perhaps because while so standing she would\r\noften hear the gay laugh of her old friend Fanny, and would thus,\r\nat second hand, receive some impress from the gaiety of the world\r\nwithout. Now, in her musing, without thinking much of whither she was\r\ngoing, she went slowly down the stairs and out of the door, and stood\r\nleaning upon the gate looking over the river at the men who were\r\nworking in the front of the warehouses. She had not been there long\r\nwhen Fanny ran across to her from the door of her father\'s house.\r\nFanny Heisse was a bright broad-faced girl, with light hair, and\r\nlaughing eyes, and a dimple on her chin, freckled somewhat, with a\r\npug nose, and a large mouth. But for all this Fanny Heisse was known\r\nthroughout Nuremberg as a pretty girl.\r\n\r\n"Linda, what do you think?" said Fanny. "Papa was at Augsburg\r\nyesterday, and has just come home, and it is all to come off the week\r\nafter next."\r\n\r\n"And you are happy?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'m happy. Why shouldn\'t a girl be happy? He\'s a good\r\nfellow and deserves it all, and I mean to be such a wife to him! Only\r\nhe is to let me dance. But you don\'t care for dancing?"\r\n\r\n"I have never tried it--much."\r\n\r\n"No; your people think it wicked. I am so glad mine don\'t. But,\r\nLinda, you\'ll be let come to my marriage--will you not? I do so want\r\nyou to come. I was making up the party just now with mother and his\r\nsister Marie. Father brought Marie home with him. And we have put\r\nyou down for one. But, Linda, what ails you? Does anything ail you?"\r\nFanny might well ask, for the tears were running down Linda\'s face.\r\n\r\n"It is nothing particular."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but it is something particular--something very particular.\r\nLinda, you mope too much."\r\n\r\n"I have not been moping now. But, Fanny, I cannot talk to you about\r\nit. I cannot indeed--not now. Do not be angry with me if I go in and\r\nleave you." Then Linda ran in, and went up to her bedroom and bolted\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Steinmarc had a cousin in a younger generation than himself,\r\nwho lived in Nuremberg, and who was named Ludovic Valcarm. The mother\r\nof this young man had been Peter\'s first cousin, and when she died\r\nLudovic had in some sort fallen into the hands of his relative\r\nthe town-clerk. Ludovic\'s father was still alive; but he was a\r\nthriftless, aimless man, who had never been of service either to his\r\nwife or children, and at this moment no one knew where he was living,\r\nor what he was doing. No one knew, unless it was his son Ludovic,\r\nwho never received much encouragement in Nuremberg to talk about his\r\nfather. At the present moment, Peter Steinmarc and his cousin, though\r\nthey had not actually quarrelled, were not on the most friendly\r\nterms. As Peter, in his younger days, had been clerk to old Tressel,\r\nso had Ludovic been brought up to act as clerk to Peter; and for\r\nthree or four years the young man had received some small modicum of\r\nsalary from the city chest, as a servant in the employment of the\r\ncity magistrates. But of late Ludovic had left his uncle\'s office,\r\nand had entered the service of certain brewers in Nuremberg, who\r\nwere more liberal in their views as to wages than were the city\r\nmagistrates. Peter Steinmarc had thought ill of his cousin for making\r\nthis change. He had been at the trouble of pointing out to Ludovic\r\nhow he himself had in former years sat upon the stool in the office\r\nin the town-hall, from whence he had been promoted to the arm-chair;\r\nand had almost taken upon himself to promise that the good fortune\r\nof Ludovic should be as great as his own, if only Ludovic for the\r\npresent would be content with the stool. But young Valcarm, who by\r\nthis time was four-and-twenty, told his cousin very freely that\r\nthe stool in the town-hall suited him no longer, and that he liked\r\nneither the work nor the wages. Indeed, he went further than this,\r\nand told his kinsman that he liked the society of the office as\r\nlittle as he did either the wages or the work. It may naturally be\r\nsupposed that this was not said till there had been some unpleasant\r\nwords spoken by the town-clerk to his assistant,--till the authority\r\nof the elder had been somewhat stretched over the head of the young\r\nman; but it may be supposed also that when such words had once been\r\nspoken, Peter Steinmarc did not again press Ludovic Valcarm to sit\r\nupon the official stool.\r\n\r\nLudovic had never lived in the garret of the red house as Peter\r\nhimself had done. When the suggestion that he should do so had\r\nsome years since been made to Madame Staubach, that prudent lady,\r\nforeseeing that Linda would soon become a young woman, had been\r\nunwilling to sanction the arrangement. Ludovic, therefore, had\r\nhoused himself elsewhere, and had been free of the authority of the\r\ntown-clerk when away from his office. But he had been often in his\r\ncousin\'s rooms, and there had grown up some acquaintance between him\r\nand aunt Charlotte and Linda. It had been very slight;--so thought\r\naunt Charlotte. It had been as slight as her precautions could make\r\nit. But Ludovic, nevertheless, had spoken such words to Linda that\r\nLinda had been unable to answer him; and though Madame Staubach was\r\naltogether ignorant that such iniquity had been perpetrated, Peter\r\nSteinmarc had shrewdly guessed the truth.\r\n\r\nRumours of a very ill sort had reached the red house respecting\r\nLudovic Valcarm. When Linda had interrogated Tetchen as to the nature\r\nof the things that were said of Ludovic in that conversation between\r\nPeter and Madame Staubach which Tetchen had overheard, she had not\r\nasked without some cause. She knew that evil things were said of the\r\nyoung man, and that evil words regarding him had been whispered by\r\nPeter into her aunt\'s ears;--that such whisperings had been going on\r\nalmost ever since the day on which Ludovic had declined to return\r\nagain to the official stool; and she knew, she thought that she knew,\r\nthat such whisperings were not altogether undeserved. There was a\r\nset of young men in Nuremberg of whom it was said that they had a\r\nbad name among their elders,--that they drank spirits instead of\r\nbeer, that they were up late at nights, that they played cards among\r\nthemselves, that they were very unfrequent at any house of prayer,\r\nthat they belonged to some turbulent political society which had, to\r\nthe grief of all the old burghers, been introduced into Nuremberg\r\nfrom Munich, that they talked of women as women are talked of in\r\nParis and Vienna and other strongholds of iniquity, and that they\r\ndespised altogether the old habits and modes of life of their\r\nforefathers. They were known by their dress. They wore high round\r\nhats like chimney-pots,--such as were worn in Paris,--and satin\r\nstocks, and tight-fitting costly coats of fine cloth, and long\r\npantaloons, and they carried little canes in their hands, and gave\r\nthemselves airs, and were very unlike what the young men of Nuremberg\r\nused to be. Linda knew their appearance well, and thought that it\r\nwas not altogether unbecoming. But she knew also,--for she had often\r\nbeen so told,--that they were dangerous men, and she was grieved that\r\nLudovic Valcarm should be among their number.\r\n\r\nBut now--now that her aunt had spoken to her of that horrid plan in\r\nreference to Peter Steinmarc, what would Ludovic Valcarm be to her?\r\nNot that he could ever have been anything. She knew that, and had\r\nknown it from the first, when she had been unable to answer him with\r\nthe scorn which his words had deserved. How could such a one as she\r\nbe mated with a man so unsuited to her aunt\'s tastes, to her own\r\nmodes of life, as Ludovic Valcarm? And yet she could have wished\r\nthat it might be otherwise. For a moment once,--perhaps for moments\r\nmore than once,--there had been ideas that no mission could be more\r\nfitting for such a one as she than that of bringing back to the right\r\npath such a young man as Ludovic Valcarm. But then,--how to begin to\r\nbring a young man back? She knew that she would not be allowed to\r\naccept his love; and now,--now that the horrid plan had been proposed\r\nto her, any such scheme was more impracticable, more impossible than\r\never. Ah, how she hated Peter Steinmarc as she thought of all this!\r\n\r\nFor four or five days after this, not a word was said to Linda by\r\nany one on the hated subject. She kept out of Peter Steinmarc\'s way\r\nas well as she could, and made herself busy through the house with\r\nan almost frantic energy. She was very good to her aunt, doing\r\nevery behest that was put upon her, and going through her religious\r\nservices with a zeal which almost seemed to signify that she liked\r\nthem. She did not leave the house once except in her aunt\'s company,\r\nand restrained herself even from leaning over the wicket-gate and\r\nlistening to the voice of Fanny Heisse. There were moments during\r\nthese days in which she thought that her opposition to her aunt\'s\r\nplan had had the desired effect, and that she was not to be driven\r\nmad by the courtship of Peter Steinmarc. Surely five days would not\r\nhave elapsed without a word had not the plan been deserted. If that\r\nwere the case, how good would she be! If that were the case, she\r\nwould resolve, on her aunt\'s behalf, to be very scornful to Ludovic\r\nValcarm.\r\n\r\nBut though she had never gone outside the house without her aunt,\r\nthough she had never even leaned on the front wicket, yet she had\r\nseen Ludovic. It had been no fault of hers that he had spied her from\r\nthe Ruden Platz, and had kissed his hand to her, and had made a sign\r\nto her which she had only half understood,--by which she had thought\r\nthat he had meant to imply that he would come to her soon. All this\r\ncame from no fault of hers. She knew that the centre warehouse in the\r\nRuden Platz opposite belonged to the brewers, Sach Brothers, by whom\r\nValcarm was employed. Of course it was necessary that the young man\r\nshould be among the workmen, who were always moving barrels about\r\nbefore the warehouse, and that he should attend to his employers\'\r\nbusiness. But he need not have made the sign, or kissed his hand,\r\nwhen he stood hidden from all eyes but hers beneath the low dark\r\narchway; nor, for the matter of that, need her eyes have been fixed\r\nupon the gateway after she had once perceived that Ludovic was on the\r\nRuden Platz.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen to her if she were to declare boldly that she loved\r\nLudovic Valcarm, and intended to become his wife, and not the wife of\r\nold Peter Steinmarc? In the first place, Ludovic had never asked her\r\nto be his wife;--but on that head she had almost no doubt at all.\r\nLudovic would ask her quickly enough, she was very sure, if only he\r\nreceived sufficient encouragement. And as far as she understood the\r\nlaw of the country in which she lived, no one could, she thought,\r\nprevent her from marrying him. In such case she would have a terrible\r\nbattle with her aunt; but her aunt could not lock her up, nor starve\r\nher into submission. It would be very dreadful, and no doubt all\r\ngood people,--all those whom she had been accustomed to regard as\r\ngood,--would throw her over and point at her as one abandoned. And\r\nher aunt\'s heart would be broken, and the world,--the world as she\r\nknew it,--would pretty nearly collapse around her. Nevertheless she\r\ncould do it. But were she to do so, would it not simply be that she\r\nwould have allowed the Devil to get the victory, and that she would\r\nhave given herself for ever and ever, body and soul, to the Evil One?\r\nAnd then she made a compact with herself,--a compact which she hoped\r\nwas not a compact with Satan also. If they on one side would not\r\nstrive to make her marry Peter Steinmarc, she on the other side would\r\nsay nothing, not a word, to Ludovic Valcarm.\r\n\r\nShe soon learned, however, that she had not as yet achieved her\r\nobject by the few words which she had spoken to her aunt. Those words\r\nhad been spoken on a Monday. On the evening of the following Saturday\r\nshe sat with her aunt in their own room down-stairs, in the chamber\r\nimmediately below that occupied by Peter Steinmarc. It was a summer\r\nevening in August, and Linda was sitting at the window, with some\r\nhousehold needlework in her lap, but engaged rather in watching the\r\nwarehouse opposite than in sedulous attention to her needle. Her eyes\r\nwere fixed upon the little doorway, not expecting that any one would\r\nbe seen there, but full of remembrance of the figure of him who had\r\nstood there and had kissed his hand. Her aunt, as was her wont on\r\nevery Saturday, was leaning over a little table intent on some large\r\nbook of devotional service, with which she prepared herself for the\r\nSabbath. Close as was her attention now and always to the volume, she\r\nwould not on ordinary occasions have allowed Linda\'s eyes to stray\r\nfor so long a time across the river without recalling them by some\r\nsharp word of reproof; but on this evening she sat and read and said\r\nnothing. Either she did not see her niece, so intent was she on her\r\ngood work, or else, seeing her, she chose, for reasons of her own,\r\nto be as one who did not see. Linda was too intent upon her thoughts\r\nto remember that she was sinning with the sin of idleness, and would\r\nhave still gazed across the river had she not heard a heavy footstep\r\nin the room above her head, and the fall of a creaking shoe on the\r\nstairs, a sound which she knew full well, and stump, bump, dump,\r\nPeter Steinmarc was descending from his own apartments to those of\r\nhis neighbours below him. Then immediately Linda withdrew her eyes\r\nfrom the archway, and began to ply her needle with diligence. And\r\nMadame Staubach looked up from her book, and became uneasy on her\r\nchair. Linda felt sure that Peter was not going out for an evening\r\nstroll, was not in quest of beer and a friendly pipe at the Rothe\r\nRoss. He was much given to beer and a friendly pipe at the Rothe\r\nRoss; but Linda knew that he would creep down-stairs somewhat softly\r\nwhen his mind was that way given; not so softly but what she would\r\nhear his steps and know whither they were wending; but now, from the\r\nnature of the sound, she was quite sure that he was not going to the\r\ninn which he frequented. She threw a hurried glance round upon her\r\naunt, and was quite sure that her aunt was of the same opinion. When\r\nHerr Steinmarc paused for half a minute outside her aunt\'s door, and\r\nthen slowly turned the lock, Linda was not a bit surprised; nor was\r\nMadame Staubach surprised. She closed her book with dignity, and sat\r\nawaiting the address of her neighbour.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, ladies," said Peter Steinmarc.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Peter," said Madame Staubach. It was many years now\r\nsince these people had first known each other, and the town-clerk\r\nwas always called Peter by his old friend. Linda spoke not a word of\r\nanswer to her lover\'s salutation.\r\n\r\n"It has been a beautiful summer day," said Peter.\r\n\r\n"A lovely day," said Madame Staubach, "through the Lord\'s favour to\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Has the fraulein been out?" asked Peter.\r\n\r\n"No; I have not been out," said Linda, almost savagely.\r\n\r\n"I will go and leave you together," said Madame Staubach, getting up\r\nfrom her chair.\r\n\r\n"No, aunt, no," said Linda. "Don\'t go away; pray, do not go away."\r\n\r\n"It is fitting that I should do so," said Madame Staubach, as with\r\none hand she gently pushed back Linda, who was pressing to the door\r\nafter her. "You will stay, Linda, and hear what our friend will say;\r\nand remember, Linda, that he speaks with my authority and with my\r\nheartfelt prayer that he may prevail."\r\n\r\n"He will never prevail," said Linda. But neither Madame Staubach nor\r\nPeter Steinmarc heard what she said.\r\n\r\nLinda had already perceived, perturbed as she was in her mind, that\r\nHerr Steinmarc had prepared himself carefully for this interview.\r\nHe had brought a hat with him into the room, but it was not the hat\r\nwhich had so long been distasteful to her. And he had got on clean\r\nbright shoes, as large indeed as the old dirty ones, because Herr\r\nSteinmarc was not a man to sacrifice his corns for love; but still\r\nshoes that were decidedly intended to be worn only on occasions. And\r\nhe had changed his ordinary woollen shirt for white linen, and had\r\ntaken out his new brown frock-coat which he always wore on those high\r\ndays in Nuremberg on which the magistrates appeared with their civic\r\ncollars. But, perhaps, the effect which Linda noted most keenly was\r\nthe debonair fashion in which the straggling hairs had been disposed\r\nover the bald pate. For a moment or two a stranger might almost have\r\nbelieved that the pate was not bald.\r\n\r\n"My dear young friend," began the town-clerk, "your aunt has, I\r\nthink, spoken to you of my wishes." Linda muttered something, she\r\nknew not what. But though her words were not intelligible, her looks\r\nwere so, and were not of a kind to have been naturally conducive\r\nto much hope in the bosom of Herr Steinmarc. "Of course, I can\r\nunderstand, Linda, how much this must have taken you by surprise\r\nat first. But that surprise will wear off, and I trust that\r\nyou may gradually come to regard me as your future husband\r\nwithout--without--without anything like fear, you know, or feelings\r\nof that kind." Still she did not speak. "If you become my wife,\r\nLinda, I will do my best to make you always happy."\r\n\r\n"I shall never become your wife, never--never--never."\r\n\r\n"Do not speak so decidedly as that, Linda."\r\n\r\n"I must speak decidedly. I do speak decidedly. I can\'t speak any\r\nother way. You know very well, Herr Steinmarc, that you oughtn\'t to\r\nask me. It is very wrong of you, and very wicked."\r\n\r\n"Why is it wrong, Linda? Why is it wicked?"\r\n\r\n"If you want to get married, you should marry some one as old as\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"No, Linda, that is not so. It is always thought becoming that the\r\nman should be older than the wife."\r\n\r\n"But you are three times as old as I am, and that is not becoming."\r\nThis was cruel on Linda\'s part, and her words also were untrue. Linda\r\nwould be twenty-one at her next birthday, whereas Herr Steinmarc had\r\nnot yet reached his fifty-second birthday.\r\n\r\nHerr Steinmarc was a man who had a temper of his own, and who was a\r\nlittle touchy on the score of age. Linda knew that he was touchy on\r\nthe score of age, and had exaggerated her statement with the view of\r\ncausing pain. It was probably some appreciation of this fact which\r\ncaused Herr Steinmarc to continue his solicitations with more of\r\nauthority in his voice than he had hitherto used. "I am not three\r\ntimes as old as you, Linda; but, whatever may be my age, your aunt,\r\nwho has the charge of you, thinks that the marriage is a fitting\r\none. You should remember that you cannot fly in her face without\r\ncommitting a great sin. I offer to you an honest household and a\r\nrespectable position. As Madame Staubach thinks that you should\r\naccept them, you must know that you are wrong to answer me with scorn\r\nand ribaldry."\r\n\r\n"I have not answered you with ribaldry. It is not ribaldry to say\r\nthat you are an old man."\r\n\r\n"You have answered me with scorn."\r\n\r\n"I do scorn you, Herr Steinmarc, when you come to me pretending to\r\nmake love like a young man, with your Sunday clothes on, and your\r\nhair brushed smooth, and your new shoes. I do scorn you. And you may\r\ngo and tell my aunt that I say so, if you like. And as for being an\r\nold man, you are an old man. Old men are very well in their way, I\r\ndaresay; but they shouldn\'t go about making love to young women."\r\n\r\nHerr Steinmarc had not hoped to succeed on this his first personal\r\nventure; but he certainly had not expected to be received after\r\nthe fashion which Linda had adopted towards him. He had, doubtless,\r\nlooked very often into Linda\'s face, and had listened very often\r\nto the tone of her voice; but he had not understood what her face\r\nexpressed, nor had he known what compass that voice would reach. Had\r\nhe been a wise man,--a man wise as to his own future comfort,--he\r\nwould have abandoned his present attempt after the lessons which he\r\nwas now learning. But, as has before been said, he had a temper, and\r\nhe was now angry with Linda. He was roused, and was disposed to make\r\nher know that, old as he was, and bald, and forced to wear awkward\r\nshoes, and to stump along heavily, still he could force her to become\r\nhis wife and to minister to his wants. He understood it all. He knew\r\nwhat were his own deficiencies, and was as wide awake as was Linda\r\nherself to the natural desires of a young girl. Madame Staubach was,\r\nperhaps, equally awake, but she connected these desires directly with\r\nthe devil. Because it was natural that a young woman should love a\r\nyoung man, therefore, according to the religious theory of Madame\r\nStaubach, it was well that a young woman should marry an old man, so\r\nthat she might then be crushed and made malleable, and susceptible of\r\nthat teaching which tells us that all suffering in this world is good\r\nfor us. Now Peter Steinmarc was by no means alive to the truth of\r\nsuch lessons as these. Religion was all very well. It was an outward\r\nsign of a respectable life,--of a life in which men are trusted\r\nand receive comfortable wages,--and, beyond that, was an innocent\r\noccupation for enthusiastic women. But he had no idea that any human\r\nbeing was bound to undergo crushing in this world for his soul\'s\r\nsake. Had he not wished to marry Linda himself, it might be very well\r\nthat Linda should marry a young man. But now that Linda so openly\r\nscorned him, had treated him with such plain-spoken contumely, he\r\nthought it would be well that Linda should be crushed. Yes; and he\r\nthought also that he might probably find a means of crushing her.\r\n\r\n"I suppose, miss," he said, after pausing for some moments, "that the\r\nmeaning of this is that you have got a young lover?"\r\n\r\n"I have got no young lover," said Linda; "and if I had, why shouldn\'t\r\nI? What would that be to you?"\r\n\r\n"It would be very much to me, if it be the young man I think. Yes, I\r\nunderstand; you blush now. Very well. I shall know now how to manage\r\nyou;--or your aunt will know."\r\n\r\n"I have got no lover," said Linda, in great anger; "and you are a\r\nvery wicked old man to say so."\r\n\r\n"Then you had better receive me as your future husband. If you will\r\nbe good and obedient, I will forgive the great unkindness of what you\r\nhave said to me."\r\n\r\n"I have not meant to be unkind, but I cannot have you for my husband.\r\nHow am I to love you?"\r\n\r\n"That will come."\r\n\r\n"It will never come."\r\n\r\n"Was it not unkind when you said that I was three times as old as\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to be unkind." Since the allusion which had been\r\nmade to some younger lover, from which Linda had gathered that Peter\r\nSteinmarc must know something of Ludovic\'s passion for herself, she\r\nhad been in part quelled. She was not able now to stand up bravely\r\nbefore her suitor, and fight him as she had done at first with all\r\nthe weapons which she had at her command. The man knew something\r\nwhich it was almost ruinous to her that he should know, something by\r\nwhich, if her aunt knew it, she would be quite ruined. How could it\r\nbe that Herr Steinmarc should have learned anything of Ludovic\'s wild\r\nlove? He had not been in the house,--he had been in the town-hall,\r\nsitting in his big official arm-chair,--when Ludovic had stood in the\r\nlow-arched doorway and blown a kiss across the river from his hand.\r\nAnd yet he did know it; and knowing it, would of course tell her\r\naunt! "I did not mean to be unkind," she said.\r\n\r\n"You were very unkind."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon then, Herr Steinmarc."\r\n\r\n"Will you let me address you, then, as your lover?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!"\r\n\r\n"Because of that young man; is it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no. I have said nothing to the young man--not a word. He is\r\nnothing to me. It is not that."\r\n\r\n"Linda, I see it all. I understand everything now. Unless you will\r\npromise to give him up, and do as your aunt bids you, I must tell\r\nyour aunt everything."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to tell."\r\n\r\n"Linda!"\r\n\r\n"I have done nothing. I can\'t help any young man. He is only over\r\nthere because of the brewery." She had told all her secret now. "He\r\nis nothing to me, Herr Steinmarc, and if you choose to tell aunt\r\nCharlotte, you must. I shall tell aunt Charlotte that if she will\r\nlet me keep out of your way, I will promise to keep out of his. But\r\nif you come, then--then--then--I don\'t know what I may do." After\r\nthat she escaped, and went away back into the kitchen, while Peter\r\nSteinmarc stumped up again to his own room.\r\n\r\n"Well, my friend, how has it gone?" said Madam Staubach, entering\r\nPeter\'s chamber, at the door of which she had knocked.\r\n\r\n"I have found out the truth," said Peter, solemnly.\r\n\r\n"What truth?" Peter shook his head, not despondently so much as in\r\ndismay. The thing which he had to tell was so very bad! He felt it so\r\nkeenly, not on his own account so much as on account of his friend!\r\nAll that was expressed by the manner in which Peter shook his head.\r\n"What truth have you found out, Peter? Tell me at once," said Madame\r\nStaubach.\r\n\r\n"She has got a--lover."\r\n\r\n"Who? Linda! I do not believe it."\r\n\r\n"She has owned it. And such a lover!" Whereupon Peter Steinmarc\r\nlifted up both his hands.\r\n\r\n"What lover? Who is he? How does she know him, and when has she seen\r\nhim? I cannot believe it. Linda has never been false to me."\r\n\r\n"Her lover is--Ludovic Valcarm."\r\n\r\n"Your cousin?"\r\n\r\n"My cousin Ludovic--who is a good-for-nothing, a spendthrift, a\r\nfellow without a florin, a fellow that plays cards on Sundays."\r\n\r\n"And who fears neither God nor Satan," said Madame Staubach. "Peter\r\nSteinmarc, I do not believe it. The child can hardly have spoken to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"You had better ask her, Madame Staubach." Then with some\r\nexaggeration Peter told Linda\'s aunt all that he did know, and\r\nsomething more than all that Linda had confessed; and before their\r\nconversation was over they had both agreed that, let these tidings be\r\ntrue in much or in little, or true not at all, every exertion should\r\nbe used to force Linda into the proposed marriage with as little\r\ndelay as possible.\r\n\r\n"I overheard him speaking to her out of the street window, when they\r\nthought I was out," said the town-clerk in a whisper before he left\r\nMadame Staubach. "I had to come back home for the key of the big\r\nchest, and they never knew that I had been in the house." This had\r\nbeen one of the occasions on which Linda had been addressed, and had\r\nwanted breath to answer the bold young man who had spoken to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, being Sunday morning, Linda positively\r\nrefused to get up at the usual hour, and declared her intention of\r\nnot going to church. She was, she said, so ill that she could not go\r\nto church. Late on the preceding evening Madame Staubach, after she\r\nhad left Peter Steinmarc, had spoken to Linda of what she had heard,\r\nand it was not surprising that Linda should have a headache on the\r\nfollowing morning. "Linda," Madame Staubach said, "Peter has told me\r\nthat Ludovic Valcarm has been--making love to you. Linda, is this\r\ntrue?" Linda had been unable to say that it was not true. Her aunt\r\nput the matter to her in a more cunning way than Steinmarc had done,\r\nand Linda felt herself unable to deny the charge. "Then let me tell\r\nyou, that of all the young women of whom I ever heard, you are the\r\nmost deceitful," continued Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"Do not say that, aunt Charlotte; pray, do not say that."\r\n\r\n"But I do say it. Oh, that it should have come to this between you\r\nand me!"\r\n\r\n"I have not deceived you. Indeed I have not. I don\'t want to see\r\nLudovic again; never, if you do not wish it. I haven\'t said a word\r\nto him. Oh, aunt, pray believe me. I have never spoken a word to\r\nhim;--in the way of what you mean."\r\n\r\n"Will you consent to marry Peter Steinmarc?" Linda hesitated a moment\r\nbefore she answered. "Tell me, Miss; will you promise to take Peter\r\nSteinmarc as your husband?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot promise that, aunt Charlotte."\r\n\r\n"Then I will never forgive you,--never. And God will never forgive\r\nyou. I did not think it possible that my sister\'s child should have\r\nbeen so false to me."\r\n\r\n"I have not been false to you," said Linda through her tears.\r\n\r\n"And such a terrible young man, too; one who drinks, and gambles,\r\nand is a rebel; one of whom all the world speaks ill; a penniless\r\nspendthrift, to whom no decent girl would betroth herself. But,\r\nperhaps, you are to be his light-of-love!"\r\n\r\n"It is a shame,--a great shame,--for you to say--such things," said\r\nLinda, sobbing bitterly. "No, I won\'t wait, I must go. I would sooner\r\nbe dead than hear you say such things to me. So I would. I can\'t help\r\nit, if it\'s wicked. You make me say it." Then Linda escaped from the\r\nroom, and went up to her bed; and on the next morning she was too ill\r\neither to eat her breakfast or to go to church.\r\n\r\nOf course she saw nothing of Peter on that morning; but she heard the\r\ncreaking of his shoes as he went forth after his morning meal, and I\r\nfear that her good wishes for his Sunday work did not go with him on\r\nthat Sabbath morning. Three or four times her aunt was in her room,\r\nbut to her aunt Linda would say no more than that she was sick and\r\ncould not leave her bed. Madame Staubach did not renew the revilings\r\nwhich she had poured forth so freely on the preceding evening, partly\r\ninfluenced by Linda\'s headache, and partly, perhaps, by a statement\r\nwhich had been made to her by Tetchen as to the amount of love-making\r\nwhich had taken place. "Lord bless you, ma\'am, in any other house\r\nthan this it would go for nothing. Over at Jacob Heisse\'s, among his\r\ngirls, it wouldn\'t even have been counted at all,--such a few words\r\nas that. Just the compliments of the day, and no more." Tetchen\r\ncould not have heard it all, or she would hardly have talked of the\r\ncompliments of the day. When Ludovic had told Linda that she was the\r\nfairest girl in all Nuremberg, and that he never could be happy, not\r\nfor an hour, unless he might hope to call her his own, even Tetchen,\r\nwhose notions about young men were not over strict, could not have\r\ntaken such words as simply meaning the compliments of the day.\r\nBut there was Linda sick in bed, and this was Sunday morning, and\r\nnothing further could be said or done on the instant. And, moreover,\r\nsuch love-making as had taken place did in truth seem to have been\r\nperpetrated altogether on the side of the young man. Therefore it was\r\nthat Madame Staubach spoke with a gentle voice as she prescribed to\r\nLinda some pill or potion that might probably be of service, and then\r\nwent forth to her church.\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach\'s prayers on a Sunday morning were a long affair. She\r\nusually left the house a little after ten, and did not return till\r\npast two. Soon after she was gone, on the present occasion, Tetchen\r\ncame up to Linda\'s room, and expressed her own desire to go to the\r\nFrauenkirche,--for Tetchen was a Roman Catholic. "That is, if you\r\nmean to get up, miss, I\'ll go," said Tetchen. Linda, turning in her\r\nbed, thought that her head would be better now that her aunt was\r\ngone, and promised that she would get up. In half an hour she was\r\nalone in the kitchen down-stairs, and Tetchen had started to the\r\nFrauenkirche,--or to whatever other place was more agreeable to her\r\nfor the occupation of her Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nIt was by no means an uncommon occurrence that Linda should be\r\nleft alone in the house on some part of the Sunday, and she would\r\nnaturally have seated herself with a book at the parlour window as\r\nsoon as she had completed what little there might be to be done in\r\nthe kitchen. But on this occasion there came upon her a feeling of\r\ndesolateness as she thought of her present condition. Not only was\r\nshe alone now, but she must be alone for ever. She had no friend\r\nleft. Her aunt was estranged from her. Peter Steinmarc was her\r\nbitterest enemy. And she did not dare even to think of Ludovic\r\nValcarm. She had sauntered now into the parlour, and, as she was\r\ntelling herself that she did not dare to think of the young man, she\r\nlooked across the river, and there he was standing on the water\'s\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nShe retreated back in the room,--so far back that it was impossible\r\nthat he should see her. She felt quite sure that he had not seen her\r\nas yet, for his back had been turned to her during the single moment\r\nthat she had stood at the window. What should she do now? She was\r\nquite certain that he could not see her, as she stood far back in\r\nthe room, within the gloom of the dark walls. And then there was the\r\nriver between him and her. So she stood and watched, as one might\r\nwatch a coming enemy, or a lover who was too bold. There was a little\r\npunt or raft moored against the bank just opposite to the gateway of\r\nthe warehouse, which often lay there, and which, as Linda knew, was\r\nused in the affairs of the brewery. Now, as she stood watching him,\r\nLudovic stepped into the punt without unfastening it from the ring,\r\nand pushed the loose end of it across the river as far as the shallow\r\nbottom would allow him. But still there was a considerable distance\r\nbetween him and the garden of the red house, a distance so great that\r\nLinda felt that the water made her safe. But there was a pole in the\r\nboat, and Linda saw the young man take up the pole and prepare for a\r\nspring, and in a moment he was standing in the narrow garden. As he\r\nlanded, he flung the pole back into the punt, which remained stranded\r\nin the middle of the river. Was ever such a leap seen before? Then\r\nshe thought how safe she would have been from Peter Steinmarc, had\r\nPeter Steinmarc been in the boat.\r\n\r\nWhat would Ludovic Valcarm do next? He might remain there all day\r\nbefore she would go to him. He was now standing under the front of\r\nthe centre gable, and was out of Linda\'s sight. There was a low\r\nwindow close to him where he stood, which opened from the passage\r\nthat ran through the middle of the house. On the other side of this\r\npassage, opposite to the parlour which Madame Staubach occupied, was\r\na large room not now used, and filled with lumber. Linda, as soon\r\nas she was aware that Ludovic was in the island, within a few feet\r\nof her, and that something must be done, retreated from the parlour\r\nback into the kitchen, and, as she went, thoughtfully drew the bolt\r\nof the front door. But she had not thought of the low window into\r\nthe passage, which in these summer days was always opened, nor, if\r\nshe had thought of it, could she have taken any precaution in that\r\ndirection. To have attempted to close the window would have been to\r\nthrow herself into the young man\'s arms. But there was a bolt inside\r\nthe kitchen door, and that she drew. Then she stood in the middle of\r\nthe room listening. Had this been a thief who had come when she was\r\nleft in charge of the house, is it thus she would have protected her\r\nown property and her aunt\'s? It was no thief. But why should she run\r\nfrom this man whom she knew,--whom she knew and would have trusted\r\nhad she been left to her own judgment of him? She was no coward.\r\nWere she to face the man, she would fear no personal danger from\r\nhim. He would offer her no insult, and she thought that she could\r\nprotect herself, even were he to insult her. It was not that that\r\nshe feared,--but that her aunt should be able to say that she had\r\nreceived her lover in secret on this Sunday morning, when she had\r\npretended that she was too ill to go to church!\r\n\r\nShe was all ears, and could hear that he was within the house. She\r\nhad thought of the window the moment that she had barred the kitchen\r\ndoor, and knew that he would be within the house. She could hear him\r\nknock at the parlour door, and then enter the parlour. But he did\r\nnot stay there a moment. Then she heard him at the foot of the stair,\r\nand with a low voice he called to her by her name. "Linda, are you\r\nthere?" But, of course, she did not answer him. It might be that\r\nhe would fancy that she was not within the house and would retreat.\r\nHe would hardly intrude into their bedrooms; but it might be that\r\nhe would go as far as his cousin\'s apartments. "Linda," he said\r\nagain,--"Linda, I know that you are in the house." That wicked\r\nTetchen! It could not be but that Tetchen had been a traitor.\r\nHe went three or four steps up the stairs, and then, bethinking\r\nhimself of the locality, came down again and knocked at once at the\r\nkitchen door. "Linda," he said, when he found that the door was\r\nbarred,--"Linda, I know that you are here."\r\n\r\n"Go away," said Linda. "Why have you come here? You know that you\r\nshould not be here."\r\n\r\n"Open the door for one moment, that you may listen to me. Open the\r\ndoor, and I will tell you all. I will go instantly when I have spoken\r\nto you, Linda; I will indeed."\r\n\r\nThen she opened the door. Why should she be a barred-up prisoner\r\nin her own house? What was there that she need fear? She had done\r\nnothing that was wrong, and would do nothing wrong. Of course, she\r\nwould tell her aunt. If the man would force his way into the house,\r\nclimbing in through an open window, how could she help it? If her\r\naunt chose to misbelieve her, let it be so. There was need now that\r\nshe should call upon herself for strength. All heaven and earth\r\ntogether should not make her marry Peter Steinmarc. Nor should earth\r\nand the evil one combined make her give herself to a young man after\r\nany fashion that should disgrace her mother\'s memory or her father\'s\r\nname. If her aunt doubted her, the sorrow would be great, but she\r\nmust bear it. "You have no right here," she said as soon as she was\r\nconfronted with the young man. "You know that you should not be here.\r\nGo away."\r\n\r\n"Linda, I love you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want your love."\r\n\r\n"And now they tell me that my cousin Peter is to be your husband."\r\n\r\n"No, no. He will never be my husband."\r\n\r\n"You will promise that?"\r\n\r\n"He will never be my husband."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, dearest; a thousand thanks for that. But your aunt is his\r\nfriend. Is it not true?"\r\n\r\n"Of course she is his friend."\r\n\r\n"And would give you to him?"\r\n\r\n"I am not hers to give. I am not to be given away at all. I choose\r\nto stay as I am. You know that you are very wicked to be here; but I\r\nbelieve you want to get me into trouble."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Linda!"\r\n\r\n"Then go. If you wish me to forgive you, go instantly."\r\n\r\n"Say that you love me, and I will be gone at once."\r\n\r\n"I will not say it."\r\n\r\n"And do you not love me,--a little? Oh, Linda, you are so dear to\r\nme!"\r\n\r\n"Why do you not go? They tell me evil things of you, and now I\r\nbelieve them. If you were not very wicked you would not come upon me\r\nhere, in this way, when I am alone, doing all that you possibly can\r\nto make me wretched."\r\n\r\n"I would give all the world to make you happy."\r\n\r\n"I have never believed what they said of you. I always thought that\r\nthey were ill-natured and prejudiced, and that they spoke falsehoods.\r\nBut now I shall believe them. Now I know that you are very wicked.\r\nYou have no right to stand here. Why do you not go when I bid you?"\r\n\r\n"But you forgive me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you go now,--at once."\r\n\r\nThen he seized her hand and kissed it. "Dearest Linda, remember that\r\nI shall always love you; always be thinking of you; always hoping\r\nthat you will some day love me a little. Now I am gone."\r\n\r\n"But which way?" said Linda--"you cannot jump back to the boat. The\r\npole is gone. At the door they will see you from the windows."\r\n\r\n"Nobody shall see me. God bless you, Linda." Then he again took her\r\nhand, though he did not, on this occasion, succeed in raising it as\r\nfar as his lips. After that he ran down the passage, and, having\r\nglanced each way from the window, in half a minute was again in the\r\ngarden. Linda, of course, hurried into the parlour, that she might\r\nwatch him. In another half minute he was down over the little wall,\r\ninto the river, and in three strides had gained the punt. The water,\r\nin truth, on that side was not much over his knees; but Linda thought\r\nhe must be very wet. Then she looked round, to see if there were any\r\neyes watching him. As far as she could see, there were no eyes.\r\n\r\nLinda, when she was alone, was by no means contented with herself;\r\nand yet there was a sort of joy at her heart which she could not\r\nexplain to herself, and of which, being keenly alive to it, she felt\r\nin great dread. What could be more wicked, more full of sin, than\r\nreceiving, on a Sunday morning, a clandestine visit from a young man,\r\nand such a young man as Ludovic Valcarm? Her aunt had often spoken\r\nto her, with fear and trembling, of the mode of life in which their\r\nneighbours opposite lived. The daughters of Jacob Heisse were allowed\r\nto dance, and talk, and flirt, and, according to Madame Staubach,\r\nwere living in fearful peril. For how much would such a man as Jacob\r\nHeisse, who thought of nothing but working hard, in order that his\r\nfour girls might always have fine dresses,--for how much would he be\r\ncalled upon to answer in the last day? Of what comfort would it be\r\nto him then that his girls, in this foolish vain world, had hovered\r\nabout him, bringing him his pipe and slippers, filling his glass\r\nstoup for him, and kissing his forehead as they stood over his\r\neasy-chair in the evening? Jacob Heisse and his daughters had ever\r\nbeen used as an example of worldly living by Madame Staubach. But\r\nnone of Jacob Heisse\'s girls would ever have done such a thing as\r\nthis. They flirted, indeed; but they did it openly, under their\r\nfather\'s nose. And Linda had often heard the old man joke with his\r\ndaughters about their lovers. Could Linda joke with any one touching\r\nthis visit from Ludovic Valcarm?\r\n\r\nAnd yet there was something in it that was a joy to her,--a joy which\r\nshe could not define. Since her aunt had been so cruel to her, and\r\nsince Peter had appeared before her as her suitor, she had told\r\nherself that she had no friend. Heretofore she had acknowledged Peter\r\nas her friend, in spite of his creaking shoes and objectionable hat.\r\nThere was old custom in his favour, and he had not been unkind to\r\nher as an inmate of the same house with him. Her aunt she had loved\r\ndearly; but now her aunt\'s cruelty was so great that she shuddered\r\nas she thought of it. She had felt herself to be friendless. Then\r\nthis young man had come to her; and though she had said to him all\r\nthe hard things of which she could think because of his coming,\r\nyet--yet--yet she liked him because he had come. Was any other young\r\nman in Nuremberg so handsome? Would any other young man have taken\r\nthat leap, or have gone through the river, that he might speak\r\none word to her, even though he were to have nothing in return\r\nfor the word so spoken? He had asked her to love him, and she had\r\nrefused;--of course she had refused;--of course he had known that she\r\nwould refuse. She would sooner have died than have told him that she\r\nloved him. But she thought she did love him--a little. She did not so\r\nlove him but what she would give him up,--but what she would swear\r\nnever to set eyes upon him again, if, as part of such an agreement,\r\nshe might be set free from Peter Steinmarc\'s solicitations. That was\r\na matter of course, because, without reference to Peter, she quite\r\nacknowledged that she was not free to have a lover of her own choice,\r\nwithout her aunt\'s consent. To give up Ludovic would be a duty,--a\r\nduty which she thought she could perform. But she would not perform\r\nit unless as part of a compact. No; let them look to it. If duty was\r\nexpected from her, let duty be done to her. Then she sat thinking,\r\nand as she thought she kissed her own hand where Ludovic had kissed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe object of her thoughts was this;--what should she do now, when\r\nher aunt came home? Were she at once to tell her aunt all that had\r\noccurred, that comparison which she had made between herself and\r\nthe Heisse girls, so much to her own disfavour, would not be a true\r\ncomparison. In that case she would have received no clandestine young\r\nman. It could not be imputed to her as a fault,--at any rate not\r\nimputed by the justice of heaven,--that Ludovic Valcarm had jumped\r\nout of a boat and got in at the window. She could put herself right,\r\nat any rate, before any just tribunal, simply by telling the story\r\ntruly and immediately. "Aunt Charlotte, Ludovic Valcarm has been\r\nhere. He jumped out of a boat, and got in at the window, and followed\r\nme into the kitchen, and kissed my hand, and swore he loved me, and\r\nthen he scrambled back through the river. I couldn\'t help it;--and\r\nnow you know all about it." The telling of such a tale as that would,\r\nshe thought, be the only way of making herself quite right before\r\na just tribunal. But she felt, as she tried the telling of it to\r\nherself, that the task would be very difficult. And then her aunt\r\nwould only half believe her, and would turn the facts, joined, as\r\nthey would be, with her own unbelief, into additional grounds for\r\nurging on this marriage with Peter Steinmarc. How can one plead one\'s\r\ncause justly before a tribunal which is manifestly unjust,--which is\r\ndetermined to do injustice?\r\n\r\nMoreover, was she not bound to secrecy? Had not secrecy been implied\r\nin that forgiveness which she had promised to Ludovic as the\r\ncondition of his going? He had accepted the condition and gone. After\r\nthat, would she not be treacherous to betray him? Why was it that at\r\nthis moment it seemed to her that treachery to him,--to him who had\r\ntreated her with such arrogant audacity,--would be of all guilt the\r\nmost guilty? It was true that she could not put herself right without\r\ntelling of him; and not to put herself right in this extremity would\r\nbe to fall into so deep a depth of wrong! But any injury to herself\r\nwould now be better than treachery to him. Had he not risked much in\r\norder that he might speak to her that one word of love? But, for all\r\nthat, she did not make up her mind for a time. She must be governed\r\nby things as they went.\r\n\r\nTetchen came home first, and to Tetchen, Linda was determined that\r\nshe would say not a word. That Tetchen was in communication with\r\nyoung Valcarm she did not doubt, but she would not tell the servant\r\nwhat had been the result of her wickedness. When Tetchen came in,\r\nLinda was in the kitchen, but she went at once into the parlour, and\r\nthere awaited her aunt. Tetchen had bustled in, in high good-humour,\r\nand had at once gone to work to prepare for the Sunday dinner. "Mr.\r\nPeter is to dine with you to-day, Linda," she had said; "your aunt\r\nthinks there is nothing like making one family of it." Linda had left\r\nthe kitchen without speaking a word, but she had fully understood the\r\nimportance of the domestic arrangement which Tetchen had announced.\r\nNo stranger ever dined at her aunt\'s table; and certainly her aunt\r\nwould have asked no guest to do so on a Sunday but one whom she\r\nintended to regard as a part of her own household. Peter Steinmarc\r\nwas to be one of them, and therefore might be allowed to eat his\r\ndinner with them even on the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nBetween two and three her aunt came in, and Peter was with her. As\r\nwas usual on Sundays, Madame Staubach was very weary, and, till the\r\ndinner was served, was unable to do much in the way of talking. Peter\r\nwent up into his own room to put away his hat and umbrella, and\r\nthen, if ever, would have been the moment for Linda to have told her\r\nstory. But she did not tell it then. Her aunt was leaning back in\r\nher accustomed chair, with her eyes closed, as was often her wont,\r\nand Linda knew that her thoughts were far away, wandering in another\r\nworld, of which she was ever thinking, living in a dream of bliss\r\nwith singing angels,--but not all happy, not all sure, because of the\r\ndanger that must intervene. Linda could not break in, at such a time\r\nas this, with her story of the young man and his wild leap from the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nAnd certainly she would not tell her story before Peter Steinmarc. It\r\nshould go untold to her dying day before she would whisper a word of\r\nit in his presence. When they sat round the table, the aunt was very\r\nkind in her manner to Linda. She had asked after her headache, as\r\nthough nothing doubting the fact of the ailment; and when Linda had\r\nsaid that she had been able to rise almost as soon as her aunt had\r\nleft the house, Madame Staubach expressed no displeasure. When the\r\ndinner was over, Peter was allowed to light his pipe, and Madame\r\nStaubach either slept or appeared to sleep. Linda seated herself\r\nin the furthest corner of the room, and kept her eyes fixed upon a\r\nbook. Peter sat and smoked with his eyes closed, and his great big\r\nshoes stuck out before him. In this way they remained for an hour.\r\nThen Peter got up, and expressed his intention of going out for a\r\nstroll in the Nonnen Garten. Now the Nonnen Garten was close to\r\nthe house,--to be reached by a bridge across the river, not fifty\r\nyards from Jacob Heisse\'s door. Would Linda go with him? But Linda\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\n"You had better, my dear," said Madame Staubach, seeming to awake\r\nfrom her sleep. "The air will do you good."\r\n\r\n"Do, Linda," said Peter; and then he intended to be very gracious in\r\nwhat he added. "I will not say a word to tease you, but just take you\r\nout, and bring you back again."\r\n\r\n"I am sure, it being the Sabbath, he would say nothing of his hopes\r\nto-day," said Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"Not a word," said Peter, lifting up one hand in token of his\r\npositive assurance.\r\n\r\nBut, even so assured, Linda would not go with him, and the town-clerk\r\nwent off alone. Now, again, had come the time in which Linda could\r\ntell the tale. It must certainly be told now or never. Were she to\r\ntell it now she could easily explain why she had been silent so\r\nlong; but were she not to tell it now, such explanation would ever\r\nafterwards be impossible. "Linda, dear, will you read to me," said\r\nher aunt. Then Linda took up the great Bible. "Turn to the eighth and\r\nninth chapters of Isaiah, my child." Linda did as she was bidden, and\r\nread the two chapters indicated. After that, there was silence for a\r\nfew minutes, and then the aunt spoke. "Linda, my child."\r\n\r\n"Yes, aunt Charlotte."\r\n\r\n"I do not think you would willingly be false to me." Then Linda\r\nturned away her face, and was silent. "It is not that the offence\r\nto me would be great, who am, as we all are, a poor weak misguided\r\ncreature; but that the sin against the Lord is so great, seeing that\r\nHe has placed me here as your guide and protector." Linda made no\r\npromise in answer to this, but even then she did not tell the tale.\r\nHow could she have told it at such a moment? But the tale must now go\r\nuntold for ever!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nA week passed by, and Linda Tressel heard nothing of Ludovic, and\r\nbegan at last to hope that that terrible episode of the young man\'s\r\nvisit to her might be allowed to be as though it had never been. A\r\nweek passed by, during every day of which Linda had feared and had\r\nhalf expected to hear some question from her aunt which would nearly\r\ncrush her to the ground. But no such question had been asked, and,\r\nfor aught that Linda knew, no one but she and Ludovic were aware\r\nof the wonderful jump that had been made out of the boat on to the\r\nisland. And during this week little, almost nothing, was said to\r\nher in reference to the courtship of Peter Steinmarc. Peter himself\r\nspoke never a word; and Madame Staubach had merely said, in reference\r\nto certain pipes of tobacco which were smoked by the town-clerk in\r\nMadame Staubach\'s parlour, and which would heretofore have been\r\nsmoked in the town-clerk\'s own room, that it was well that Peter\r\nshould learn to make himself at home with them. Linda had said\r\nnothing in reply, but had sworn inwardly that she would never make\r\nherself at home with Peter Steinmarc.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the pipes of tobacco, Linda was beginning to hope that\r\nshe might even yet escape from her double peril, and, perhaps, was\r\nbeginning to have hope even beyond that, when she was suddenly shaken\r\nin her security by words which were spoken to her by Fanny Heisse.\r\n"Linda," said Fanny, running over to the gate of Madame Staubach\'s\r\nhouse, very early on one bright summer morning, "Linda, it is to be\r\nto-morrow! And will you not come?"\r\n\r\n"No, dear; we never go out here: we are so sad and solemn that we\r\nknow nothing of gaiety."\r\n\r\n"You need not be solemn unless you like it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know but what I do like it, Fanny; I have become so used to\r\nit that I am as grave as an owl."\r\n\r\n"That comes of having an old lover, Linda."\r\n\r\n"I have not got an old lover," said Linda, petulantly.\r\n\r\n"You have got a young one, at any rate."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Fanny?"\r\n\r\n"What do I mean? Just what I say. You know very well what I mean. Who\r\nwas it jumped over the river that Sunday morning, my dear? I know\r\nall about it." Then there came across Linda\'s face a look of extreme\r\npain,--a look of anguish; and Fanny Heisse could see that her friend\r\nwas greatly moved by what she had said. "You don\'t suppose that I\r\nshall tell any one," she added.\r\n\r\n"I should not mind anything being told if all could be told," said\r\nLinda.\r\n\r\n"But he did come,--did he not?" Linda merely nodded her head. "Yes; I\r\nknew that he came when your aunt was at church, and Tetchen was out,\r\nand Herr Steinmarc was out. Is it not a pity that he should be such a\r\nne\'er-do-well?"\r\n\r\n"Do you think that I am a ne\'er-do-well, Fanny?"\r\n\r\n"No indeed; but, Linda, I will tell you what I have always thought\r\nabout young men. They are very nice, and all that; and when old\r\ncroaking hunkses have told me that I should have nothing to say to\r\nthem, I have always answered that I meant to have as much to say to\r\nthem as possible; but it is like eating good things;--everybody likes\r\neating good things, but one feels ashamed of doing it in secret."\r\n\r\nThis was a terrible blow to poor Linda. "But I don\'t like doing it,"\r\nshe answered. "It wasn\'t my fault. I did not bid him come."\r\n\r\n"One never does bid them to come; I mean not till one has taken up\r\nwith a fellow as a lover outright. Then you bid them, and sometimes\r\nthey won\'t come for your bidding."\r\n\r\n"I would have given anything in the world to have prevented his doing\r\nwhat he did. I never mean to speak to him again,--if I can help it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Linda!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose you think I expected him, because I stayed at home alone?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--I did think that possibly you expected something."\r\n\r\n"I would have gone to church with my aunt though my head was\r\nsplitting had I thought that Herr Valcarm would have come here while\r\nshe was away."\r\n\r\n"Mind I have not blamed you. It is a great shame to give a girl an\r\nold lover like Peter Steinmarc, and ask her to marry him. I wouldn\'t\r\nhave married Peter Steinmarc for all the uncles and all the aunts in\r\ncreation; nor yet for father,--though father would never have thought\r\nof such a thing. I think a girl should choose a lover for herself,\r\nthough how she is to do so if she is to be kept moping at home\r\nalways, I cannot tell. If I were treated as you are I think I should\r\nask somebody to jump over the river to me."\r\n\r\n"I have asked nobody. But, Fanny, how did you know it?"\r\n\r\n"A little bird saw him."\r\n\r\n"But, Fanny, do tell me."\r\n\r\n"Max saw him get across the river with his own eyes." Max Bogen was\r\nthe happy man who on the morrow was to make Fanny Heisse his wife.\r\n\r\n"Heavens and earth!"\r\n\r\n"But, Linda, you need not be afraid of Max. Of all men in the world\r\nhe is the very last to tell tales."\r\n\r\n"Fanny, if ever you whisper a word of this to any one, I will never\r\nspeak to you again."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I shall not whisper it."\r\n\r\n"I cannot explain to you all about it,--how it would ruin me. I think\r\nI should kill myself outright if my aunt were to know it; and yet I\r\ndid nothing wrong. I would not encourage a man to come to me in that\r\nway for all the world; but I could not help his coming. I got myself\r\ninto the kitchen; but when I found that he was in the house I thought\r\nit would be better to open the door and speak to him."\r\n\r\n"Very much better. I would have slapped his face. A lover should know\r\nwhen to come and when to stay away."\r\n\r\n"I was ashamed to think that I did not dare to speak to him, and so I\r\nopened the door. I was very angry with him."\r\n\r\n"But still, perhaps, you like him,--just a little; is not that true,\r\nLinda?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know; but this I know, I do not want ever to see him\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Come, Linda; never is a long time."\r\n\r\n"Let it be ever so long, what I say is true."\r\n\r\n"The worst of Ludovic is that he is a ne\'er-do-well. He spends more\r\nmoney than he earns, and he is one of those wild spirits who are\r\nalways making up some plan of politics--who live with one foot inside\r\nthe State prison, as it were. I like a lover to be gay, and all that;\r\nbut it is not well to have one\'s young man carried off and locked up\r\nby the burgomasters. But, Linda, do not be unhappy. Be sure that I\r\nshall not tell; and as for Max Bogen, his tongue is not his own. I\r\nshould like to hear him say a word about such a thing when I tell him\r\nto be silent."\r\n\r\nLinda believed her friend, but still it was a great trouble to her\r\nthat any one should know what Ludovic Valcarm had done on that Sunday\r\nmorning. As she thought of it all, it seemed to her to be almost\r\nimpossible that a secret should remain a secret that was known to\r\nthree persons,--for she was sure that Tetchen knew it,--to three\r\npersons besides those immediately concerned. She thought of her\r\naunt\'s words to her, when Madame Staubach had cautioned her against\r\ndeceit, "I do not think that you would willingly be false to me,\r\nbecause the sin against the Lord would be so great." Linda had\r\nunderstood well how much had been meant by this caution. Her aunt had\r\ngroaned over her in spirit once, when she found it to be a fact that\r\nLudovic Valcarm had been allowed to speak to her,--had been allowed\r\nto speak though it were but a dozen words. The dozen words had been\r\nspoken and had not been revealed, and Madame Staubach having heard of\r\nthis sin, had groaned in the spirit heavily. How much deeper would be\r\nher groans if she should come to know that Ludovic had been received\r\nin her absence, had been received on a Sabbath morning, when her\r\nniece was feigning to be ill! Linda still fancied that her aunt might\r\nbelieve her if she were to tell her own story, but she was certain\r\nthat her aunt would never believe her if the story were to be told\r\nby another. In that case there would be nothing for her, Linda,\r\nbut perpetual war; and, as she thought, perpetual disgrace. As her\r\naunt would in such circumstances range her forces on the side of\r\npropriety, so must she range hers on the side of impropriety. It\r\nwould become necessary that she should surrender herself, as it were,\r\nto Satan; that she should make up her mind for an evil life; that she\r\nshould cut altogether the cord which bound her to the rigid practices\r\nof her present mode of living. Her aunt had once asked her if she\r\nmeant to be the light-of-love of this young man. Linda had well\r\nknown what her aunt had meant, and had felt deep offence; but yet\r\nshe now thought that she could foresee a state of things in which,\r\nthough that degradation might yet be impossible, the infamy of such\r\ndegradation would belong to her. She did not know how to protect\r\nherself from all this, unless she did so by telling her aunt of the\r\nyoung man\'s visit.\r\n\r\nBut were she to do so she must accompany her tale by the strongest\r\nassurance that no possible consideration would induce her to marry\r\nPeter Steinmarc. There must then be a compact, as has before been\r\nsaid, that the name neither of one man nor the other should ever\r\nagain be mentioned as that of Linda\'s future husband. But would her\r\naunt agree to such a compact? Would she not rather so use the story\r\nthat would be told to her, as to draw from it additional reasons\r\nfor pressing Peter\'s suit? The odious man still smoked his pipes of\r\ntobacco in Madame Staubach\'s parlour, gradually learning to make\r\nhimself at home there. Linda, as she thought of this, became grave,\r\nsettled, and almost ferocious in the working of her mind. Anything\r\nwould be better than this,--even the degradation to be feared from\r\nhard tongues, and from the evil report of virtuous women. As she\r\npictured to herself Peter Steinmarc with his big feet, and his\r\nstraggling hairs, and his old hat, and his constant pipe, almost any\r\nlot in life seemed to her to be better than that. Any lot in death\r\nwould certainly be better than that. No! If she told her story there\r\nmust be a compact. And if her aunt would consent to no compact,\r\nthen,--then she must give herself over to the Evil One. In that case\r\nthere would be no possible friend for her, no ally available to her\r\nin her difficulties, but that one. In that case, even though Ludovic\r\nshould have both feet within the State prison, he must be all in all\r\nto her, and she,--if possible,--all in all to him.\r\n\r\nThen she was driven to ask herself some questions as to her feelings\r\ntowards Ludovic Valcarm. Hitherto she had endeavoured to comfort\r\nherself with the reflection that she had in no degree committed\r\nherself. She had not even confessed to herself that she loved the\r\nman. She had never spoken,--she thought that she had never spoken a\r\nword, that could be taken by him as encouragement. But yet, as things\r\nwere going with her now, she passed no waking hour without thinking\r\nof him; and in her sleeping hours he came to her in her dreams. Ah,\r\nhow often he leaped over that river, beautifully, like an angel, and,\r\nrunning to her in her difficulties, dispersed all her troubles by the\r\nbeauty of his presence. But then the scene would change, and he would\r\nbecome a fiend instead of a god, or a fallen angel; and at these\r\nmoments it would become her fate to be carried off with him into\r\nuttermost darkness. But even in her saddest dreams she was never\r\ninclined to stand before the table in the church and vow that she\r\nwould be the loving wife of Peter Steinmarc. Whenever in her dreams\r\nsuch a vow was made, the promise was always given to that\r\nne\'er-do-well.\r\n\r\nOf course she loved the man. She came to know it as a fact, to be\r\nquite sure that she loved him, without reaching any moment in which\r\nshe first made the confession openly to herself. She knew that she\r\nloved him. Had she not loved him, would she have so easily forgiven\r\nhim,--so easily have told him that he was forgiven? Had she not loved\r\nhim, would not her aunt have heard the whole story from her on that\r\nSunday evening, even though the two chapters of Isaiah had been left\r\nunread in order that she might tell it? Perhaps, after all, the\r\ncompact of which she had been thinking might be more difficult to her\r\nthan she had imagined. If the story of Ludovic\'s coming could be kept\r\nfrom her aunt\'s ears, it might even yet be possible to her to keep\r\nSteinmarc at a distance without any compact. One thing was certain\r\nto her. He should be kept at a distance, either with or without a\r\ncompact.\r\n\r\nDays went on, and Fanny Heisse was married, and all probability of\r\ntelling the story was at an end. Madame Staubach had asked her niece\r\nwhy she did not go to her friend\'s wedding, but Linda had made no\r\nanswer,--had shaken her head as though in anger. What business had\r\nher aunt to ask her why she did not make one of a gay assemblage,\r\nwhile everything was being done to banish all feeling of gaiety from\r\nher life? How could there be any pleasant thought in her mind while\r\nPeter Steinmarc still smoked his pipes in their front parlour? Her\r\naunt understood this, and did not press the question of the wedding\r\nparty. But, after so long an interval, she did find it necessary to\r\npress that other question of Peter\'s courtship. It was now nearly a\r\nmonth since the matter had first been opened to Linda, and Madame\r\nStaubach was resolved that the thing should be settled before the\r\nautumn was over. "Linda," she said one day, "has Peter Steinmarc\r\nspoken to you lately?"\r\n\r\n"Has he spoken to me, aunt Charlotte?"\r\n\r\n"You know what I mean, Linda."\r\n\r\n"No, he has not--spoken to me. I do not mean that he should--speak\r\nto me." Linda, as she made this answer, put on a hard stubborn look,\r\nsuch as her aunt did not know that she had ever before seen upon her\r\ncountenance. But if Linda was resolved, so also was Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said the aunt, "I do not know what to think of such\r\nan answer. Herr Steinmarc has a right to speak if he pleases,\r\nand certainly so when that which he says is said with my full\r\nconcurrence."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t allow you to think that I shall ever be his wife. That is\r\nall."\r\n\r\nAfter this there was silence for some minutes, and then Madame\r\nStaubach spoke again. "My dear, have you thought at all\r\nabout--marriage?"\r\n\r\n"Not much, aunt Charlotte."\r\n\r\n"I daresay not, Linda; and yet it is a subject on which a young woman\r\nshould think much before she either accepts or rejects a proposed\r\nhusband."\r\n\r\n"It is enough to know that one doesn\'t like a man."\r\n\r\n"No, that is not enough. You should examine the causes of your\r\ndislike. And as far as mere dislike goes, you should get over it,\r\nif it be unjust. You ought to do that, whoever may be the person in\r\nquestion."\r\n\r\n"But it is not mere dislike."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Linda?"\r\n\r\n"It is disgust."\r\n\r\n"Linda, that is very wicked. You should not allow yourself to feel\r\nwhat you call disgust at any of God\'s creatures. Have you ever\r\nthought who made Herr Steinmarc?"\r\n\r\n"God made Judas Iscariot, aunt Charlotte."\r\n\r\n"Linda, that is profane,--very profane." Then there was silence\r\nbetween them again; and Linda would have remained silent had her aunt\r\npermitted it. She had been called profane, but she disregarded that,\r\nhaving, as she thought, got the better of her aunt in the argument as\r\nto disgust felt for any of God\'s creatures. But Madame Staubach had\r\nstill much to say. "I was asking you whether you had thought at all\r\nabout marriage, and you told me that you had not."\r\n\r\n"I have thought that I could not possibly--under any\r\ncircumstances--marry Peter Steinmarc."\r\n\r\n"Linda, will you let me speak? Marriage is a very solemn thing."\r\n\r\n"Very solemn indeed, aunt Charlotte."\r\n\r\n"In the first place, it is the manner in which the all-wise Creator\r\nhas thought fit to make the weaker vessel subject to the stronger\r\none." Linda said nothing, but thought that that old town-clerk was\r\nnot a vessel strong enough to hold her in subjection. "It is this\r\nwhich a woman should bring home to herself, Linda, when she first\r\nthinks of marriage."\r\n\r\n"Of course I should think of it, if I were going to be married."\r\n\r\n"Young women too often allow themselves to imagine that wedlock\r\nshould mean pleasure and diversion. Instead of that it is simply the\r\nentering into that state of life in which a woman can best do her\r\nduty here below. All life here must be painful, full of toil, and\r\nmoistened with many tears." Linda was partly prepared to acknowledge\r\nthe truth of this teaching; but she thought that there was a great\r\ndifference in the bitterness of tears. Were she to marry Ludovic\r\nValcarm, her tears with him would doubtless be very bitter, but no\r\ntears could be so bitter as those which she would be called upon to\r\nshed as the wife of Peter Steinmarc. "Of course," continued Madame\r\nStaubach, "a wife should love her husband."\r\n\r\n"But I could not love Peter Steinmarc."\r\n\r\n"Will you listen to me? How can you understand me if you will not\r\nlisten to me? A wife should love her husband. But young women, such\r\nas I see them to be, because they have been so instructed, want to\r\nhave something soft and delicate; a creature without a single serious\r\nthought, who is chosen because his cheek is red and his hair is soft;\r\nbecause he can dance, and speak vain, meaningless words; because\r\nhe makes love, as the foolish parlance of the world goes. And we\r\nsee what comes of such lovemaking. Oh, Linda! God forbid that you\r\nshould fall into that snare! If you will think of it, what is it but\r\nharlotry?"\r\n\r\n"Aunt Charlotte, do not say such horrible things."\r\n\r\n"A woman when she becomes a man\'s wife should see, above all things,\r\nthat she is not tempted by the devil after this fashion. Remember,\r\nLinda, how he goeth about,--ever after our souls,--like a roaring\r\nlion. And it is in this way specially that he goeth about after the\r\nsouls of young women."\r\n\r\n"But why do you say those things to me?"\r\n\r\n"It is to you only that I can say them. I would so speak to all young\r\nwomen, if it were given me to speak to more than to one. You talk of\r\nlove."\r\n\r\n"No, aunt; never. I do not talk--of love."\r\n\r\n"Young women do, and think of it, not knowing what love for their\r\nhusband should mean. A woman should revere her husband and obey him,\r\nand be subject to him in everything." Was it supposed, Linda thought,\r\nthat she should revere such a being as Peter Steinmarc? What could be\r\nher aunt\'s idea of reverence? "If she does that, she will love him\r\nalso."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--if she does," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"And will not this be much more likely, if the husband be older than\r\nhis wife?"\r\n\r\n"A year or two," said Linda, timidly.\r\n\r\n"Not a year or two only, but so much so as to make him graver and\r\nwiser, and fit to be in command over her. Will not the woman so ruled\r\nbe safer than she who trusts herself with one who is perhaps as weak\r\nand inexperienced as herself?" Madame Staubach paused, but Linda\r\nwould not answer the question. She did not wish for such security\r\nas was here proposed to her. "Is it not that of which you have to\r\nthink,--your safety here, so that, if possible, you may be safe\r\nhereafter?" Linda answered this to herself, within her own bosom. Not\r\nfor security here or hereafter, even were such to be found by such\r\nmeans, would she consent to become the wife of the man proposed to\r\nher. Madame Staubach, finding that no spoken reply was given to her\r\nquestions, at last proceeded from generalities to the special case\r\nwhich she had under her consideration. "Linda," she said, "I trust\r\nyou will consent to become the wife of this excellent man." Linda\'s\r\nface became very hard, but still she said nothing. "The danger of\r\nwhich I have spoken is close upon you. You must feel it to be so. A\r\nyouth, perhaps the most notorious in all Nuremberg for wickedness--"\r\n\r\n"No, aunt; no."\r\n\r\n"I say yes; and this youth is spoken of openly as your lover."\r\n\r\n"No one has a right to say so."\r\n\r\n"It is said, and he has so addressed himself to your own ears. You\r\nhave confessed it. Tell me that you will do as I would have you,\r\nand then I shall know that you are safe. Then I will trust you in\r\neverything, for I shall be sure that it will be well with you. Linda,\r\nshall it be so?"\r\n\r\n"It shall not be so, aunt Charlotte."\r\n\r\n"Is it thus you answer me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing shall make me marry a man whom I hate."\r\n\r\n"Hate him! Oh, Linda."\r\n\r\n"Nothing shall make me marry a man whom I cannot love."\r\n\r\n"You fancy, then, that you love that reprobate?" Linda was silent.\r\n"Is it so? Tell me. I have a right to demand an answer to that\r\nquestion."\r\n\r\n"I do love him," said Linda. Using the moment for reflection allowed\r\nto her as best she could, she thought that she saw the best means of\r\nescape in this avowal. Surely her aunt would not press her to marry\r\none man when she had declared that she loved another.\r\n\r\n"Then, indeed, you are a castaway."\r\n\r\n"I am no castaway, aunt Charlotte," said Linda, rising to her feet.\r\n"Nor will I remain here, even with you, to be so called. I have done\r\nnothing to deserve it. If you will cease to press upon me this odious\r\nscheme, I will do nothing to disgrace either myself or you; but if I\r\nam perplexed by Herr Steinmarc and his suit, I will not answer for\r\nthe consequences." Then she turned her back upon her aunt and walked\r\nslowly out of the room.\r\n\r\nOn that very evening Peter came to Linda while she was standing alone\r\nat the kitchen window. Tetchen was out of the house, and Linda had\r\nescaped from the parlour as soon as the hour arrived at which in\r\nthose days Steinmarc was wont to seat himself in her aunt\'s presence\r\nand slowly light his huge meerschaum pipe. But on this occasion he\r\nfollowed her into the kitchen, and Linda was aware that this was done\r\nbefore her aunt had had any opportunity of explaining to him what\r\nhad occurred on that morning. "Fraulein," he said, "as you are alone\r\nhere, I have ventured to come in and join you."\r\n\r\n"This is no proper place for you, Herr Steinmarc," she replied. Now,\r\nit was certainly the case that Peter rarely passed a day without\r\nstanding for some twenty minutes before the kitchen stove talking\r\nto Tetchen. Here he would always take off his boots when they were\r\nwet, and here, on more than one occasion,--on more, probably, than\r\nfifty,--had he sat and smoked his pipe, when there was no other\r\nstove a-light in the house to comfort him with its warmth. Linda,\r\ntherefore, had no strong point in her favour when she pointed out to\r\nher suitor that he was wrong to intrude upon the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Wherever you are, must be good for me," said Peter, trying to smirk\r\nand to look pleased.\r\n\r\nLinda was determined to silence him, even if she could not silence\r\nher aunt. "Herr Steinmarc," she said, "I have explained to my aunt\r\nthat this kind of thing from you must cease. It must be made to\r\ncease. If you are a man you will not persecute me by a proposal which\r\nI have told you already is altogether out of the question. If there\r\nwere not another man in all Nuremberg, I would not have you. You may\r\nperhaps make me hate you worse than anybody in the world; but you\r\ncannot possibly do anything else. Go to my aunt and you will find\r\nthat I have told her the same." Then she walked off to her own\r\nbedroom, leaving the town-clerk in sole possession of the kitchen.\r\n\r\nPeter Steinmarc, when he was left standing alone in the kitchen, did\r\nnot like his position. He was a man not endowed with much persuasive\r\ngift of words, but he had a certain strength of his own. He had a\r\nwill, and some firmness in pursuing the thing which he desired. He\r\nwas industrious, patient, and honest with a sort of second-class\r\nhonesty. He liked to earn what he took, though he had a strong\r\nbias towards believing that he had earned whatever in any way he\r\nmight have taken, and after the same fashion he was true with a\r\nsecond-class truth. He was unwilling to deceive; but he was usually\r\nable to make himself believe that that which would have been deceit\r\nfrom another to him, was not deceit from him to another. He was\r\nfriendly in his nature to a certain degree, understanding that\r\ngood offices to him-wards could not be expected unless he also was\r\nprepared to do good offices to others; but on this matter he kept an\r\naccurate mental account-sheet, on which he strove hard to be able\r\nto write the balance always on the right side. He was not cruel\r\nby nature, but he had no tenderness of heart and no delicacy of\r\nperception. He could forgive an offence against his comfort, as when\r\nTetchen would burn his soup; or even against his pocket, as when,\r\nafter many struggles, he would be unable to enforce the payment of\r\nsome municipal fee. But he was vain, and could not forgive an offence\r\nagainst his person. Linda had previously told him to his face that he\r\nwas old, and had with premeditated malice and falsehood exaggerated\r\nhis age. Now she threatened him with her hatred. If he persevered in\r\nasking her to be his wife, she would hate him! He, too, began to hate\r\nher; but his hatred was unconscious, a thing of which he was himself\r\nunaware, and he still purposed that she should be his wife. He would\r\nbreak her spirit, and bring her to his feet, and punish her with a\r\nlife-long punishment for saying that he was sixty, when, as she well\r\nknew, he was only fifty-two. She should beg for his love,--she who\r\nhad threatened him with her hatred! And if she held out against him,\r\nhe would lead her such a life, by means of tales told to Madame\r\nStaubach, that she should gladly accept any change as a release. He\r\nnever thought of the misery that might be forthcoming to himself in\r\nthe possession of a young wife procured after such a fashion. A man\r\nrequires some power of imagination to enable him to look forward to\r\nthe circumstances of an untried existence, and Peter Steinmarc was\r\nnot an imaginative man.\r\n\r\nBut he was a thoughtful man, cunning withal, and conscious that\r\nvarious resources might be necessary to him. There was a certain\r\npacker of casks, named Stobe, in the employment of the brewers who\r\nowned the warehouse opposite, and Stobe was often to be seen on the\r\nother side of the river in the Ruden Platz. With this man Steinmarc\r\nhad made an acquaintance, not at first with any reference to\r\nLinda Tressel, but because he was desirous of having some private\r\ninformation as to the doings of his relative Ludovic Valcarm. From\r\nStobe, however, he had received the first intimation of Ludovic\'s\r\npassion for Linda; and now on this very evening of which we are\r\nspeaking, he obtained further information,--which shocked him,\r\nfrightened him, pained him exceedingly, and yet gave him keen\r\ngratification. Stobe also had seen the leap out of the boat, and\r\nthe rush through the river; and when, late on that evening, Peter\r\nSteinmarc, sore with the rebuff which he had received from Linda,\r\npottered over to the Ruden Platz, thinking that it would be well that\r\nhe should be very cunning, that he should have a spy with his eye\r\nalways open, that he should learn everything that could be learned\r\nby one who might watch the red house, and watch Ludovic also, he\r\nlearned, all of a sudden, by the speech of a moment, that Ludovic\r\nValcarm had, on that Sunday morning, paid his wonderful visit to the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n"So you mean that you saw him?" said Peter.\r\n\r\n"With my own eyes," said Stobe, who had his reasons, beyond Peter\'s\r\nmoderate bribes, for wishing to do an evil turn to Ludovic. "And\r\nI saw her at the parlour window, watching him, when he came back\r\nthrough the water."\r\n\r\n"How long was he with her?" asked Peter, groaning, but yet exultant.\r\n\r\n"A matter of half an hour; not less anyways."\r\n\r\n"It was two Sundays since," said Peter, remembering well the morning\r\non which Linda had declined to go to church because of her headache.\r\n\r\n"I remember it well. It was the feast of St. Lawrence," said Stobe,\r\nwho was a Roman Catholic, and mindful of the festivals of his Church.\r\n\r\nPeter tarried for no further discourse with the brewer\'s man, but\r\nhurried back again, round by the bridge, to the red house. As he went\r\nhe applied his mind firmly to the task of resolving what he would do.\r\nHe might probably take the most severe revenge on Linda, the revenge\r\nwhich should for the moment be the most severe, by summoning her to\r\nthe presence of her aunt, by there exposing her vile iniquity, and\r\nby there declaring that it was out of the question that a man so\r\nrespectable as he should contaminate himself by marrying so vile a\r\ncreature. But were he to do this Linda would never be in his power,\r\nand the red house would never be in his possession. Moreover, though\r\nhe continued to tell himself that Linda was vile, though he was\r\nprepared to swear to her villany, he did not in truth believe that\r\nshe had done anything disgraceful. That she had seen her lover he did\r\nnot doubt; but that, in Peter\'s own estimation, was a thing to be\r\nexpected. He must, no doubt, on this occasion pretend to view the\r\nmatter with the eyes of Madame Staubach. In punishing Linda, he would\r\nso view it. But he thought that, upon the whole bearing of the case,\r\nit would not be incumbent upon his dignity to abandon for ever his\r\nbride and his bride\'s property, because she had been indiscreet. He\r\nwould marry her still. But before he did so he would let her know how\r\nthoroughly she was in his power, and how much she would owe to him\r\nif he now took her to his bosom. The point on which he could not at\r\nonce quite make up his mind was this: Should he tell Madame Staubach\r\nfirst, or should he endeavour to use the power over Linda, which his\r\nknowledge gave him, by threats to her? Might he not say to her with\r\nmuch strength, "Give way to me at once, or I will reveal to your aunt\r\nthis story of your vileness"? This no doubt would be the best course,\r\ncould he trust in its success. But, should it not succeed, he would\r\nthen have injured his position. He was afraid that Linda would be too\r\nhigh-spirited, too obstinate, and he resolved that his safest course\r\nwould be to tell everything at once to Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\nAs he passed between the back of Jacob Heisse\'s house and the river\r\nhe saw the upholsterer\'s ruddy face looking out from an open window\r\nbelonging to his workshop. "Good evening, Peter," said Jacob Heisse.\r\n"I hope the ladies are well."\r\n\r\n"Pretty well, I thank you," said Peter, as he was hurrying by.\r\n\r\n"Tell Linda that we take it amiss that she did not come to our girl\'s\r\nwedding. The truth is, Peter, you keep her too much moped up there\r\namong you. You should remember, Peter, that too much work makes Jack\r\na dull boy. Linda will give you all the slip some day, if she be kept\r\nso tight in hand."\r\n\r\nPeter muttered something as he passed on to the red house. Linda\r\nwould give them the slip, would she? It was not improbable, he\r\nthought, that she should try to do so, but he would keep such a watch\r\non her that it should be very difficult, and the widow should watch\r\nas closely as he would do. Give them the slip! Yes; that might be\r\npossible, and therefore he would lose no time.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the house he walked at once up to Madame Staubach\'s\r\nparlour, and entered it without any of that ceremony of knocking that\r\nwas usual to him. It was not that he intended to put all ceremony\r\naside, but that in his eager haste he forgot his usual precaution.\r\nWhen he entered the room Linda was there with her aunt, and he had\r\nagain to turn the whole subject over in his thoughts. Should he tell\r\nhis tale in Linda\'s presence or behind her back? It gradually became\r\napparent to him that he could not possibly tell it before her face;\r\nbut he did not arrive at this conclusion without delay, and the\r\nminutes which were so occupied were full of agony. He seated himself\r\nin his accustomed chair, and looked from the aunt to the niece and\r\nthen from the niece to the aunt. Give him the slip, would she? Well,\r\nperhaps she would. But she should be very clever if she did.\r\n\r\n"I thought you would have been in earlier, Peter," said Madame\r\nStaubach.\r\n\r\n"I was coming, but I saw the fraulein in the kitchen, and I ventured\r\nto speak a word or two there. The reception which I received drove me\r\naway."\r\n\r\n"Linda, what is this?"\r\n\r\n"I did not think, aunt, that the kitchen was the proper place for\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Any room in this house is the proper place for him," said Madame\r\nStaubach, in her enthusiasm. Linda was silent, and Peter replied to\r\nthis expression of hospitality simply by a grateful nod. "I will not\r\nhave you give yourself airs, Linda," continued Madame Staubach. "The\r\nkitchen not a proper place! What harm could Peter do in the kitchen?"\r\n\r\n"He tormented me, so I left him. When he torments me I shall always\r\nleave him." Then Linda got up and stalked out of the room. Her aunt\r\ncalled her more than once, but she would not return. Her life was\r\nbecoming so heavy to her, that it was impossible that she should\r\ncontinue to endure it. She went up now to her room, and looking out\r\nof the window fixed her eyes upon the low stone archway in which she\r\nhad more than once seen Ludovic Valcarm. But he was not there now.\r\nShe knew, indeed, that he was not in Nuremberg. Tetchen had told her\r\nthat he had gone to Augsburg,--on pretence of business connected with\r\nthe brewery, Tetchen had said, but in truth with reference to some\r\ndiabolical political scheme as to which Tetchen expressed a strong\r\nopinion that all who dabbled in it were children of the very devil.\r\nBut though Ludovic was not in Nuremberg, Linda stood looking at the\r\narchway for more than half an hour, considering the circumstances of\r\nher life, and planning, if it might be possible to plan, some future\r\nscheme of existence. To live under the upas-tree of Peter Steinmarc\'s\r\ncourtship would be impossible to her. But how should she avoid it?\r\nAs she thought of this, her eyes were continually fixed on the low\r\narchway. Why did not he come out from it and give her some counsel\r\nas to the future? There she stood looking out of the window till she\r\nwas called by her aunt\'s voice--"Linda, Linda, come down to me."\r\nHer aunt\'s voice was very solemn, almost as though it came from the\r\ngrave; but then solemnity was common to her aunt, and Linda, as she\r\ndescended, had not on her mind any special fear.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the parlour Madame Staubach was alone there,\r\nstanding in the middle of the room. For a moment or two after she\r\nentered, the widow stood there without speaking, and then Linda knew\r\nthat there was cause for fear. "Did you want me, aunt Charlotte?" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Linda, what were you doing on the morning of the Sabbath before the\r\nlast, when I went to church alone, leaving you in bed?"\r\n\r\nLinda was well aware now that her aunt knew it all, and was aware\r\nalso that Steinmarc had been the informer. No idea of denying the\r\ntruth of the story or of concealing anything, crossed her mind for\r\na moment. She was quite prepared to tell everything now, feeling no\r\ndoubt but that everything had been told. There was no longer a hope\r\nthat she should recover her aunt\'s affectionate good-will. But in\r\nwhat words was she to tell her tale? That was now her immediate\r\ndifficulty. Her aunt was standing before her, hard, stern, and cruel,\r\nexpecting an answer to her question. How was that answer to be made\r\non the spur of the moment?\r\n\r\n"I did nothing, aunt Charlotte. A man came here while you were\r\nabsent."\r\n\r\n"What man?"\r\n\r\n"Ludovic Valcarm." They were both standing, each looking the other\r\nfull in the face. On Madame Staubach\'s countenance there was written\r\na degree of indignation and angry shame which seemed to threaten\r\nutter repudiation of her niece. On Linda\'s was written a resolution\r\nto bear it all without flinching. She had no hope now with her\r\naunt,--no other hope than that of being able to endure. For some\r\nmoments neither of them spoke, and then Linda, finding it difficult\r\nto support her aunt\'s continued gaze, commenced her defence. "The\r\nyoung man came when I was alone, and made his way into the house when\r\nthe door was bolted. I had locked myself into the kitchen; but when I\r\nheard his voice I opened the door, thinking that it did not become me\r\nto be afraid of his presence."\r\n\r\n"Why did you not tell me,--at once?" Linda made no immediate reply to\r\nthis question; but when Madame Staubach repeated it, she was obliged\r\nto answer.\r\n\r\n"I told him that if he would go, I would forgive him. Then he went,\r\nand I thought that I was bound by my promise to be silent."\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach having heard this, turned round slowly, and walked to\r\nthe window, leaving Linda in the middle of the room. There she stood\r\nfor perhaps half a minute, and then came slowly back again. Linda had\r\nremained where she was, without stirring a limb; but her mind had\r\nbeen active, and she had determined that she would submit in silence\r\nto no rebukes. Any commands from her aunt, save one, she would\r\nendeavour to obey; but from all accusations as to impropriety of\r\nconduct she would defend herself with unabashed spirit. Her aunt came\r\nup close to her; and, putting out one hand, with the palm turned\r\ntowards her, raising it as high as her shoulder, seemed to wave her\r\naway. "Linda," said Madame Staubach, "you are a castaway."\r\n\r\n"I am no castaway, aunt Charlotte," said Linda, almost jumping from\r\nher feet, and screaming in her self-defence.\r\n\r\n"You will not frighten me by your wicked violence. You have--lied to\r\nme;--have lied to me. Yes; and that after all that I said to you as\r\nto the heinousness of such wickedness. Linda, it is my belief that\r\nyou knew that he was coming when you kept your bed on that Sabbath\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"If you choose to have such thoughts of me in your heart, aunt\r\nCharlotte, I cannot help it. I knew nothing of his coming. I would\r\nhave given all I had to prevent it. Yes,--though his coming could do\r\nme no real harm. My good name is more precious to me than anything\r\nshort of my self-esteem. Nothing even that you can say shall rob me\r\nof that."\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach was almost shaken by the girl\'s firmness,--by that,\r\nand by her own true affection for the sinner. In her bosom, what\r\nremained of the softness of womanhood was struggling with the\r\nhardness of the religious martinet, and with the wilfulness of the\r\ndomestic tyrant. She had promised to Steinmarc that she would be very\r\nstern. Steinmarc had pointed out to her that nothing but the hardest\r\nseverity could be of avail. He, in telling his story, had taken it\r\nfor granted that Linda had expected her lover, had remained at home\r\non purpose that she might receive her lover, and had lived a life\r\nof deceit with her aunt for months past. When Madame Staubach had\r\nsuggested that the young man\'s coming might have been accidental, he\r\nhad treated the idea with ridicule. He, as the girl\'s injured suitor,\r\nwas, he declared, obliged to treat such a suggestion as altogether\r\nincredible, although he was willing to pardon the injury done to him,\r\nif a course of intense severity and discipline were at once adopted,\r\nand if this were followed by repentance which to him should appear to\r\nbe sincere. When he took this high ground, as a man having authority,\r\nand as one who knew the world, he had carried Madame Staubach with\r\nhim, and she had not ventured to say a word in excuse for her niece.\r\nShe had promised that the severity should be at any rate forthcoming,\r\nand, if possible, the discipline. As for the repentance, that, she\r\nsaid meekly, must be left in the hands of God. "Ah!" said Peter, in\r\nhis bitterness, "I would make her repent in sackcloth and ashes!"\r\nThen Madame Staubach had again promised that the sackcloth and\r\nashes should be there. She remembered all this as she thought of\r\nrelenting,--as she perceived that to relent would be sweet to her,\r\nand she made herself rigid with fresh resolves. If the man\'s coming\r\nhad been accidental, why had not the story been told to her? She\r\ncould understand nothing of that forgiveness of which Linda had\r\nspoken; and had not Linda confessed that she loved this man? Would\r\nshe not rather have hated him who had so intruded upon her, had there\r\nbeen real intrusion in the visit?\r\n\r\n"You have done that," she said, "which would destroy the character of\r\nany girl in Nuremberg."\r\n\r\n"If you mean, aunt Charlotte, that the thing which has happened would\r\ndestroy the character of any girl in Nuremberg, it may perhaps be\r\ntrue. If so, I am very unfortunate."\r\n\r\n"Have you not told me that you love him?"\r\n\r\n"I do;--I do;--I do! One cannot help one\'s love. To love as I do is\r\nanother misfortune. There is nothing but misery around me. You have\r\nheard the whole truth now, and you may as well spare me further\r\nrebuke."\r\n\r\n"Do you not know how such misery should be met?" Linda shook her\r\nhead. "Have you prayed to be forgiven this terrible sin?"\r\n\r\n"What sin?" said Linda, again almost screaming in her energy.\r\n\r\n"The terrible sin of receiving this man in the absence of your\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\n"It was no sin. I am sinful, I know,--very; no one perhaps more so.\r\nBut there was no sin there. Could I help his coming? Aunt Charlotte,\r\nif you do not believe me about this, it is better that we should\r\nnever speak to each again. If so, we must live apart."\r\n\r\n"How can that be? We cannot rid ourselves of each other."\r\n\r\n"I will go anywhere,--into service, away from Nuremberg,--where you\r\nwill. But I will not be told that I am a liar."\r\n\r\nAnd yet Madame Staubach was sure that Linda had lied. She thought\r\nthat she was sure. And if so,--if it were the case that this young\r\nwoman had planned an infamous scheme for receiving her lover on a\r\nSunday morning;--the fact that it was on a Sunday morning, and that\r\nthe hour of the Church service had been used, greatly enhanced the\r\natrocity of the sin in the estimation of Madame Staubach;--if the\r\nyoung woman had intrigued in order that her lover might come to\r\nher, of course she would intrigue again. In spite of Linda\'s solemn\r\nprotestation as to her self-esteem, the thing would be going on. This\r\ninfamous young man, who, in Madame Staubach\'s eyes, was beginning to\r\ntake the proportions of the Evil One himself, would be coming there\r\nbeneath her very nose. It seemed to her that life would be impossible\r\nto her, unless Linda would consent to be married to the respectable\r\nsuitor who was still willing to receive her; and that the only way\r\nin which to exact that consent would be to insist on the degradation\r\nto which Linda had subjected herself. Linda had talked of going into\r\nservice. Let her go into that service which was now offered to her by\r\nthose whom she was bound to obey. "Of course Herr Steinmarc knows it\r\nall," said Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"I do not regard in the least what Herr Steinmarc knows," replied\r\nLinda.\r\n\r\n"But he is still willing to overlook the impropriety of your conduct,\r\nupon condition--"\r\n\r\n"He overlook it! Let him dare to say such a word to me, and I would\r\ntell him that his opinion in this matter was of less moment to me\r\nthan that of any other creature in all Nuremberg. What is it to him\r\nwho comes to me? Were it but for him, I would bid the young man come\r\nevery day."\r\n\r\n"Linda!"\r\n\r\n"Do not talk to me about Peter Steinmarc, aunt Charlotte, or I shall\r\ngo mad."\r\n\r\n"I must talk about him, and you must hear about him. It is now more\r\nthan ever necessary that you should be his wife. All Nuremberg will\r\nhear of this."\r\n\r\n"Of course it will,--as Peter Steinmarc knows it."\r\n\r\n"And how will you cover yourself from your shame?"\r\n\r\n"I will not cover myself at all. If you are ashamed of me, I will go\r\naway. If you will not say that you are not ashamed of me, I will go\r\naway. I have done nothing to disgrace me, and I will hear nothing\r\nabout shame." Having made this brave assertion, she burst into tears,\r\nand then escaped to her own bed.\r\n\r\nWhen Madame Staubach was left alone, she sat down, closed her eyes,\r\nclasped her hands, and began to pray. As to what she should do in\r\nthese terrible circumstances she had no light, unless such light\r\nmight be given to her from above. A certain trust she had in Peter\r\nSteinmarc, because Peter was a man, and not a young man; but it was\r\nnot a trust which made her confident. She thought that Peter was\r\nvery good in being willing to take Linda at all after all that had\r\nhappened, but she had begun to be aware that he himself was not\r\nable to make his own goodness apparent to Linda. She did not in her\r\nheart blame Peter for his want of eloquence, but rather imputed an\r\nincreased degree of culpability to Linda, in that any eloquence\r\nwas necessary for her conviction on such a matter. Eloquence in an\r\naffair of marriage, in reference to any preparation for marriage\r\narrangements, was one of those devil\'s baits of which Madame Staubach\r\nwas especially afraid. Ludovic Valcarm no doubt could be eloquent,\r\ncould talk of love, and throw glances from his eyes, and sigh, and do\r\nworse things, perhaps, even than those. All tricks of Satan, these to\r\nensnare the souls of young women! Peter could perform no such tricks,\r\nand therefore it was that his task was so difficult to him. She could\r\nnot regard it as a deficiency that he was unable to do those very\r\nthings which, when done in her presence, were abominable to her\r\nsight, and when spoken of were abominable to her ears, and when\r\nthought of were abominable to her imagination. But yet how was she to\r\narrange this marriage, if Peter were able to say nothing for himself?\r\nSo she sat herself down and clasped her hands and prayed earnestly\r\nthat assistance might be given to her. If you pray that a mountain\r\nshall be moved, and will have faith, the mountain shall certainly\r\nbe stirred. So she told herself; but she told herself this in an\r\nagony of spirit, because she still doubted,--she feared that she\r\ndoubted,--that this thing would not be done for her by heaven\'s aid.\r\nOh, if she could only make herself certain that heaven would aid her,\r\nthen the thing would be done for her. She could not be certain, and\r\ntherefore she felt herself to be a wretched sinner.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Linda was in bed up-stairs, thinking over her\r\nposition, and making up her mind as to what should be her future\r\nconduct. As far as it might be possible, she would enter no room in\r\nwhich Peter Steinmarc was present. She would not go into the parlour\r\nwhen he was there, even though her aunt should call her. Should he\r\nfollow her into the kitchen, she would instantly leave it. On no\r\npretence would she speak to him. She had always the refuge of her own\r\nbedroom, and should he venture to follow her there, she thought that\r\nshe would know how to defend herself. As to the rest, she must bear\r\nher aunt\'s thoughts, and if necessary her aunt\'s hard words also. It\r\nwas very well to talk of going into service, but where was the house\r\nthat would receive her? And then, as to Ludovic Valcarm! In regard to\r\nhim, it was not easy for her to come to any resolution; but she still\r\nthought that she would be willing to make that compact, if her aunt,\r\non the other side, would be willing to make it also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nAll September went by, and all October, and life in the red house in\r\nthe island in Nuremberg was a very sad life indeed. During this time\r\nLinda Tressel never spoke to Ludovic Valcarm, nor of him; but she saw\r\nhim once, standing among the beer-casks opposite to the warehouse.\r\nHad she not so seen him, she would have thought that he had vanished\r\naltogether out of the city, and that he was to be no more heard of\r\nor seen among them. He was such a man, and belonged to such a set,\r\nthat his vanishing in this fashion would have been a thing to create\r\nno surprise. He might have joined his father, and they two might\r\nbe together in any quarter of the globe,--on any spot,--the more\r\ndistant, the more probable. It was one of Linda\'s troubles that she\r\nknew really nothing of the life of the man she loved. She had always\r\nheard things evil spoken of him, but such evil-speaking had come\r\nfrom those who were his enemies,--from his cousin, who had been\r\nangry because Ludovic had not remained with him on the stool in the\r\ntown-hall; and from Madame Staubach, who thought ill of almost all\r\nyoung men, and who had been specially prejudiced against this young\r\nman by Peter Steinmarc. Linda did not know what she should believe.\r\nShe had heard that the Brothers Sach were respectable tradesmen,\r\nand it was in Valcarm\'s favour that he was employed by them. She\r\nhad thought that he had left them; but now, seeing him again among\r\nthe barrels, she had reason to presume that his life could not be\r\naltogether unworthy of him. He was working for his bread, and what\r\nmore could be required from a young man than that? Nevertheless, when\r\nshe saw him, she sedulously kept herself from his sight, and went,\r\nalmost at once, back to the kitchen, from whence there was no view on\r\nto the Ruden Platz.\r\n\r\nDuring these weeks life was very sad in this house. Madame Staubach\r\nsaid but little to her niece of her past iniquity in the matter\r\nof Ludovic\'s visit, and not much of Peter\'s suit; but she so bore\r\nherself that every glance of her eye, every tone of her voice, every\r\nnod of her head, was a separate rebuke. She hardly ever left Linda\r\nalone, requiring her company when she went out to make her little\r\npurchases in the market, and always on those more momentous and\r\nprolonged occasions when she attended some public prayer-meeting.\r\nLinda resolved to obey in such matters, and she did obey. She went\r\nhither and thither by her aunt\'s side, and at home sat with her aunt,\r\nalways with a needle in her hand,--never leaving the room, except\r\nwhen Peter Steinmarc entered it. This he did, perhaps, on every other\r\nevening; and when he did so, Linda always arose and went up to her\r\nown chamber, speaking no word to the man as she passed him. When her\r\naunt had rebuked her for this, laying upon her a command that she\r\nshould remain when Steinmarc appeared, she protested that in that\r\nmatter obedience was impossible to her. In all other things she would\r\ndo as she was bidden; nothing, she said, but force, should induce\r\nher to stay for five minutes in the same room with Peter Steinmarc.\r\nPeter, who was of course aware of all this, would look at her when he\r\npassed her, or met her on the stairs, or in the passages, as though\r\nshe were something too vile for him to touch. Madame Staubach, as she\r\nsaw this, would groan aloud, and then Peter would groan. Latterly,\r\ntoo, Tetchen had taken to groaning; so that life in that house had\r\nbecome very sad. But Linda paid back Peter\'s scorn with interest.\r\nHer lips would curl, and her nostrils would be dilated, and her eyes\r\nwould flash fire on him as she passed him. He also prayed a little\r\nin these days that Linda might be given into his hands. If ever she\r\nshould be so given, he should teach her what it was to scorn the\r\noffer of an honest man.\r\n\r\nFor a month or six weeks Linda Tressel bore all this with patience;\r\nbut when October was half gone, her patience was almost at an end.\r\nSuch a life, if prolonged much further, would make her mad. The\r\nabsence of all smiles from the faces of those with whom she lived,\r\nwas terrible to her. She was surrounded by a solemnity as of the\r\ngrave, and came to doubt almost whether she were a living creature.\r\nIf she were to be scorned always, to be treated ever as one unfit\r\nfor the pleasant intercourse of life, it might be as well that she\r\nshould deserve such treatment. It was possible that by deserving it\r\nshe might avoid it! At first, during these solemn wearisome weeks,\r\nshe would tell herself that because her aunt had condemned her,\r\nnot therefore need she feel assured that she was condemned of her\r\nheavenly Father. She was not a castaway because her aunt had so\r\ncalled her. But gradually there came upon her a feeling, springing\r\nfrom her imagination rather than from her judgment, that she was a\r\nthing set apart as vile and bad. There grew upon her a conviction\r\nthat she was one of the non-elect, or rather, one of those who are\r\nelected to an eternity of misery. Her religious observances, as\r\nthey came to her now, were odious to her; and that she supposed to\r\nbe a certain sign that the devil had fought for her soul and had\r\nconquered. It could not be that she should be so terribly wretched if\r\nshe were not also very wicked. She would tremble now at every sound;\r\nand though she still curled her lips, and poured scorn upon Peter\r\nfrom her eyes, as she moved away at his approach, she was almost so\r\nfar beaten as to be desirous to succumb. She must either succumb\r\nto her aunt and to him, or else she must fly. How was she to live\r\nwithout a word of sympathy from any human being?\r\n\r\nShe had been careful to say little or nothing to Tetchen, having some\r\nindistinct idea that Tetchen was a double traitor. That Tetchen had\r\non one occasion been in league with Ludovic, she was sure; but she\r\nthought that since that the woman had been in league with Peter also.\r\nThe league with Ludovic had been very wicked, but that might be\r\nforgiven. A league with Peter was a sin to be forgiven never; and\r\ntherefore Linda had resolutely declined of late to hold any converse\r\nwith Tetchen other than that which the affairs of the house demanded.\r\nWhen Tetchen, who in this matter was most unjustly treated, would\r\nmake little attempts to regain the confidence of her young mistress,\r\nher efforts were met with a repellant silence. And thus there was no\r\none in the house to whom Linda could speak. This at last became so\r\ndreadful to her, the desolation of her position was so complete,\r\nthat she had learned to regret her sternness to Tetchen. As far as\r\nshe could now see, there was no alliance between Tetchen and Peter;\r\nand it might be the case, she thought, that her suspicions had been\r\nunjust to the old woman.\r\n\r\nOne evening, about the beginning of November, when it had already\r\nbecome dark at that hour in which Peter would present himself in\r\nMadame Staubach\'s parlour, he had entered the room, as was usual with\r\nhim; and, as usual, Linda had at once left it. Peter, as he passed\r\nher, had looked at her with more than his usual anger, with an\r\naggravated bitterness of condemnation in his eyes. She had been\r\nweeping in silence before he had appeared, and she had no power left\r\nto throw back her scorn at him. Still weeping, she went up into her\r\nroom, and throwing herself on her bed, began, in her misery, to cry\r\naloud for mercy. Some end must be brought to this, or the burden on\r\nher shoulders would be heavier than she could bear. She had gone to\r\nthe window for a moment as she entered the chamber, and had thrown\r\none glance in despair over towards the Ruden Platz. But the night was\r\ndark, and full of rain, and had he been there she could not have seen\r\nhim. There was no one to befriend her. Then she threw herself on the\r\nbed and wept aloud.\r\n\r\nShe was still lying there when there came a very low tap at the door.\r\nShe started up and listened. She had heard no footfall on the stairs,\r\nand it was, she thought, impossible that any one should have come up\r\nwithout her hearing the steps. Peter Steinmarc creaked whenever he\r\nwent along the passages, and neither did her aunt or Tetchen tread\r\nwith feet as light as that. She sat up, and then the knock was\r\nrepeated,--very low and very clear. She still paused a moment,\r\nresolving that nothing should frighten her,--nothing should startle\r\nher. No change that could come to her would, she thought, be a change\r\nfor the worse. She hastened up from off the bed, and stood upon the\r\nfloor. Then she gave the answer that is usual to such a summons.\r\n"Come in," she said. She spoke low, but with clear voice, so that her\r\nword might certainly be heard, but not be heard afar. She stood about\r\nten feet from the door, and when she heard the lock turned, her heart\r\nwas beating violently.\r\n\r\nThe lock was turned, and the door was ajar, but it was not opened.\r\n"Linda," said a soft voice--"Linda, will you speak to me?" Heavens\r\nand earth! It was Ludovic,--Ludovic in her aunt\'s house,--Ludovic at\r\nher chamber door,--Ludovic there, within the very penetralia of their\r\nabode, while her aunt and Peter Steinmarc were sitting in the chamber\r\nbelow! But she had resolved that in no event would she be startled.\r\nIn making that resolve, had she not almost hoped that this would be\r\nthe voice that should greet her?\r\n\r\nShe could not now again say, "Come in," and the man who had had the\r\naudacity to advance so far, was not bold enough to advance farther,\r\nthough invited. She stepped quickly to the door, and, placing her\r\nhand upon the lock, knew not whether to close it against the intruder\r\nor to confront the man. "There can be but a moment, Linda; will you\r\nnot speak to me?" said her lover.\r\n\r\nWhat could her aunt do to her?--what Peter Steinmarc?--what could the\r\nworld do, worse than had been done already? They had told her that\r\nshe was a castaway, and she had half believed it. In the moments of\r\nher deepest misery she had believed it. If that were so, how could\r\nshe fall lower? Would it not be sweet to her to hear one word of\r\nkindness in her troubles, to catch one note that should not be laden\r\nwith rebuke? She opened the door, and stood before him in the gloom\r\nof the passage.\r\n\r\n"Linda,--dear, dearest Linda;"--and before she knew that he was so\r\nnear her, he had caught her hand.\r\n\r\n"Hush! they are below;--they will hear you."\r\n\r\n"No; I could be up among the rafters before any one could be on\r\nthe first landing; and no one should hear a motion." Linda, in her\r\nsurprise, looked up through the darkness, as though she could see\r\nthe passage of which he spoke in the narrowing stair amidst the roof.\r\nWhat a terrible man was this, who had come to her bedroom door, and\r\ncould thus talk of escaping amidst the rafters!\r\n\r\n"Why are you here?" she whispered.\r\n\r\n"Because I love you better than the light of heaven. Because I would\r\ngo through fire and water to be near you. Linda,--dearest Linda, is\r\nit not true that you are in sorrow?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed yes," she said, shaking her head, while she still left her\r\nhand in his.\r\n\r\n"And shall I not find an escape for you?"\r\n\r\n"No, no; that is impossible."\r\n\r\n"I will try at least," said he.\r\n\r\n"You can do nothing for me,--nothing."\r\n\r\n"You love me, Linda? Say that you love me." She remained silent, but\r\nher hand was still within his grasp. She could not lie to him, and\r\nsay that she loved him not. "Linda, you are all the world to me. The\r\nsweetest music that I could hear would be one word to say that I am\r\ndear to you." She said not a word, but he knew now that she loved\r\nhim. He knew it well. It is the instinct of the lover to know that\r\nhis mistress has given him her heart heartily, when she does not deny\r\nthe gift with more than sternness,--with cold cruelty. Yes; he knew\r\nher secret now; and pulling her close to him by her hand, by her arm,\r\nhe wound his own arm round her waist tightly, and pressed his face\r\nclose to hers. "Linda, Linda,--my own, my own!--O God! how happy I\r\nam!" She suffered it all, but spoke not a word. His hot kisses were\r\nrained upon her lips, but she gave him never a kiss in return. He\r\npressed her with all the muscles of his body, and she simply bore\r\nthe pressure, uncomplaining, uncomplying, hardly thinking, half\r\nconscious, almost swooning, hysterical, with blood rushing wildly\r\nto her heart, lost in an agony of mingled fear and love. "Oh,\r\nLinda!--oh, my own one!" But the kisses were still raining on her\r\nlips, and cheek, and brow. Had she heard her aunt\'s footsteps on the\r\nstairs, had she heard the creaking shoes of Peter Steinmarc himself,\r\nshe could hardly have moved to save herself from their wrath. The\r\npressure of her lover\'s arms was very sweet to her, but still,\r\nthrough it all, there was a consciousness that, in her very knowledge\r\nof that sweetness, the devil was claiming his own. Now, in very\r\ntruth, was she a castaway. "My love, my life!" said Ludovic, "there\r\nare but a few moments for us. What can I do to comfort you?" She was\r\nstill in his arms, pressed closely to his bosom, not trusting at all\r\nto the support of her own legs. She made one little struggle to free\r\nherself, but it was in vain. She opened her lips to speak, but there\r\ncame no sound from them. Then there came again upon her that storm of\r\nkisses, and she was bound round by his arm, as though she were never\r\nagain to be loosened. The waters that fell upon her were sweeter than\r\nthe rains of heaven; but she knew,--there was still enough of life\r\nin her to remember,--that they were foul with the sulphur and the\r\nbrimstone of the pit of hell.\r\n\r\n"Linda," he said, "I am leaving Nuremberg; will you go with me?" Go\r\nwith him! whither was she to go? How was she to go? And this going\r\nthat he spoke of? Was it not thus usually with castaways? If it were\r\ntrue that she was in very fact already a castaway, why should she not\r\ngo with him? And yet she was half sure that any such going on her\r\npart was a thing quite out of the question. As an actor will say of\r\nhimself when he declines some proffered character, she could not see\r\nherself in that part. Though she could tell herself that she was a\r\ncastaway, a very child of the devil, because she could thus stand and\r\nlisten to her lover at her chamber door, yet could she not think of\r\nthe sin that would really make her so without an abhorrence which\r\nmade that sin frightful to her. She was not allured, hardly tempted,\r\nby the young man\'s offer as he made it. And yet, what else was there\r\nfor her to do? And if it were true that she was a castaway, why\r\nshould she struggle to be better than others who were of the same\r\ncolour with herself? "Linda, say, will you be my wife?"\r\n\r\nHis wife! Oh, yes, she would be his wife,--if it were possible. Even\r\nnow, in the moment of her agony, there came to her a vague idea that\r\nshe might do him some service if she were his wife, because she had\r\nproperty of her own. She was ready to acknowledge to herself that her\r\nduty to him was stronger than her duty to that woman below who had\r\nbeen so cruel to her. She would be his wife, if it were possible,\r\neven though he should drag her through the mud of poverty and through\r\nthe gutters of tribulation. Could she walk down to her aunt\'s\r\npresence this moment his real wife, she would do so, and bear all\r\nthat could be said to her. Could this be so, that storm which had\r\nbeen bitter with brimstone from the lowest pit, would at once become\r\nsweet with the air of heaven. But how could this be? She knew that it\r\ncould not be. Marriage was a thing difficult to be done, hedged in\r\nwith all manner of impediments, hardly to be reached at all by such\r\na one as her, unless it might be such a marriage as that proposed to\r\nher with Peter Steinmarc. For girls with sweet, loving parents, for\r\nthe Fanny Heisses of the world, marriage might be made easy. It was\r\nall very well for Ludovic Valcarm to ask her to be his wife; but in\r\nasking he must have known that she could not if she would; and yet\r\nthe sound of the word was sweet to her. If it might be so, even yet\r\nshe would not be a castaway.\r\n\r\nBut she did not answer his question. Struggling hard to speak, she\r\nmuttered some prayer to him that he would leave her. "Say that you\r\nlove me," demanded Ludovic. The demand was only whispered, but the\r\nwords came hot into her ears.\r\n\r\n"I do love you," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Then you will go with me."\r\n\r\n"No, no! It is impossible."\r\n\r\n"They will make you take that man for your husband."\r\n\r\n"They shall never do that;--never,--never." In making this assertion,\r\nLinda found strength to extricate herself from her lover\'s arms and\r\nto stand alone.\r\n\r\n"And how shall I come to you again?" said Ludovic.\r\n\r\n"You must not come again. You should not have come now. I would not\r\nhave been here had I thought it possible you would have come."\r\n\r\n"But, Linda--" and then he went on to show to her how very\r\nunsatisfactory a courtship theirs would be, if, now that they were\r\ntogether, nothing could be arranged as to their future meeting. It\r\nsoon became clear to Linda that Ludovic knew everything that was\r\ngoing on in the house, and had learned it all from Tetchen. Tetchen\r\nat this moment was quite aware of his presence up-stairs, and was\r\nprepared to cough aloud, standing at the kitchen door, if any sign\r\nwere made that either Steinmarc or Madame Staubach were about to\r\nleave the parlour. Though it had seemed to Linda that her lover had\r\ncome to her through the darkness, aided by the powers thereof, the\r\nassistance which had really brought him there was simply that of the\r\nold cook down-stairs. It certainly was on the cards that Tetchen\r\nmight help him again after the same fashion, but Ludovic felt that\r\nsuch help would be but of little avail unless Linda, now that she had\r\nacknowledged her love, would do something to help also. With Ludovic\r\nValcarm it was quite a proper course of things that he should jump\r\nout of a boat, or disappear into the roof among the rafters, or\r\nescape across the tiles and down the spouts in the darkness, as\r\npreliminary steps in a love affair. But in this special love affair\r\nsuch movements could only be preliminary; and therefore, as he was\r\nnow standing face to face with Linda, and as there certainly had been\r\ndifficulties in achieving this position, he was anxious to make some\r\npositive use of it. And then, as he explained to Linda in very few\r\nwords, he was about to leave Nuremberg, and go to Munich. She did not\r\nquite understand whether he was always to remain in Munich; nor did\r\nshe think of inquiring how he was to earn his bread there. But it was\r\nhis scheme, that she should go with him and that there they should be\r\nmarried. If she would meet him at the railway station in time for the\r\nearly train, they certainly could reach Munich without impediment.\r\nLinda would find no difficulty in leaving the house. Tetchen would\r\ntake care that even the door should be open for her.\r\n\r\nLinda listened to it all, and by degrees the impossibility of her\r\nassenting to such iniquity became less palpable. And though the\r\nwickedness of the scheme was still manifest to her, though she felt\r\nthat, were she to assent to it, she would, in doing so, give herself\r\nup finally, body and soul, to the Evil One, yet was she not angry\r\nwith Ludovic for proposing it. Nay, loving him well enough before,\r\nshe loved him the better as he pressed her to go with him. But\r\nshe would not go. She had nothing to say but, No, no, no. It was\r\nimpossible. She was conscious after a certain fashion that her legs\r\nwould refuse to carry her to the railway station on such an errand,\r\nthat her physical strength would have failed her, and that were she\r\nto make ever so binding a promise, when the morning came she would\r\nnot be there. He had again taken her hand, and was using all his\r\neloquence, still speaking in low whispers, when there was heard a\r\ncough,--not loud, but very distinct,--Tetchen\'s cough as she stood at\r\nthe kitchen door. Ludovic Valcarm, though the necessity for movement\r\nwas so close upon him, would not leave Linda\'s hand till he had again\r\npressed a kiss upon her mouth. Now, at last, in this perilous moment,\r\nthere was some slightest movement on Linda\'s lips, which he flattered\r\nhimself he might take as a response. Then, in a moment, he was gone\r\nand her door was shut, and he was escaping, after his own fashion,\r\ninto the darkness,--she knew not whither and she knew not how, except\r\nthat there was a bitter flavour of brimstone about it all.\r\n\r\nShe seated herself at the foot of the bed lost in amazement. She must\r\nfirst think,--she was bound first to think, of his safety; and yet\r\nwhat in the way of punishment could they do to him comparable to the\r\ntorments which they could inflict upon her? She listened, and she\r\nsoon heard Peter Steinmarc creaking in the room below. Tetchen had\r\ncoughed because Peter was as usual going to his room, but had Ludovic\r\nremained at her door no one would have been a bit the wiser. No doubt\r\nLudovic, up among the rafters, was thinking the same thing; but there\r\nmust be no renewal of their intercourse that night, and therefore\r\nLinda bolted her door. As she did so, she swore to herself that she\r\nwould not unbolt it again that evening at Ludovic\'s request. No\r\nsuch encroaching request was made to her. She sat for nearly an\r\nhour at the foot of her bed, waiting, listening, fearing, thinking,\r\nhoping,--hardly hoping, when another step was heard on the stair and\r\nin the passage,--a step which she well knew to be that of her aunt\r\nCharlotte. Then she arose, and as her aunt drew near she pulled back\r\nthe bolt and opened the door. The little oil lamp which she held\r\nthrew a timid fitful light into the gloom, and Linda looked up\r\nunconsciously into the darkness of the roof over her head.\r\n\r\nIt had been her custom to return to her aunt\'s parlour as soon as she\r\nheard Peter creaking in the room below, and she had still meant to do\r\nso on this evening; but hitherto she had been unable to move, or at\r\nany rate so to compose herself as to have made it possible for her to\r\ngo into her aunt\'s presence. Had she not had the whole world of her\r\nown love story to fill her mind and her heart?\r\n\r\n"Linda, I have been expecting you to come down to me," said her aunt,\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n"Yes, aunt Charlotte, and I was coming."\r\n\r\n"It is late now, Linda."\r\n\r\n"Then, if you please, I will go to bed," said Linda, who was by no\r\nmeans sorry to escape the necessity of returning to the parlour.\r\n\r\n"I could not go to my rest," said Madame Staubach, "without doing my\r\nduty by seeing you and telling you again, that it is very wicked of\r\nyou to leave the room whenever our friend enters it. Linda, do you\r\never think of the punishment which pride will bring down upon you?"\r\n\r\n"It is not pride."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Linda. It is the worst pride in the world."\r\n\r\n"I will sit with him all the evening if he will promise me never\r\nagain to ask me to be his wife."\r\n\r\n"The time will perhaps come, Linda, when you will be only too glad to\r\ntake him, and he will tell you that you are not fit to be the wife of\r\nan honest man." Then, having uttered this bitter curse,--for such it\r\nwas,--Madame Staubach went across to her own room.\r\n\r\nLinda, as she knelt at her bedside, tried to pray that she might\r\nbe delivered from temptation, but she felt that her prayers were\r\nnot prayers indeed. Even when she was on her knees, with her hands\r\nclasped together as though towards her God, her very soul was full\r\nof the presence of that arm which had been so fast wound round her\r\nwaist. And when she was in bed she gave herself up to the sweetness\r\nof her love. With what delicious violence had that storm of kisses\r\nfallen on her! Then she prayed for him, and strove very hard that her\r\nprayer might be sincere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother month had passed by, and it was now nearly mid-winter.\r\nAnother month had passed by, and neither had Madame Staubach nor\r\nPeter Steinmarc heard ought of Ludovic\'s presence among the rafters;\r\nbut things were much altered in the red house, and Linda\'s life was\r\nhot, fevered, suspicious, and full of a dangerous excitement. Twice\r\nagain she had seen Ludovic, once meeting him in the kitchen, and once\r\nshe had met him at a certain dark gate in the Nonnen Garten, to which\r\nshe had contrived to make her escape for half an hour on a false\r\nplea. Things were much changed with Linda Tressel when she could\r\ncondescend to do this. And she had received from her lover a dozen\r\nnotes, always by the hand of Tetchen, and had written to him more\r\nthan once a few short, incoherent, startling words, in which she\r\nwould protest that she loved him, and protest also at the same time\r\nthat her love must be all in vain. "It is of no use. Do not write,\r\nand pray do not come. If this goes on it will kill me. You know that\r\nI shall never give myself to anybody else." This was in answer to\r\na proposition made through Tetchen that he should come again to\r\nher,--should come, and take her away with him. He had come, and there\r\nhad been that interview in the kitchen, but he had not succeeded in\r\ninducing her to leave her home.\r\n\r\nThere had been many projects discussed between them, as to which\r\nTetchen had given much advice. It was Tetchen\'s opinion, that if\r\nLinda would declare to her aunt that she meant at once to marry\r\nLudovic Valcarm, and make him master of the house in which they\r\nlived, Madame Staubach would have no alternative but to submit\r\nquietly; that she would herself go forth and instruct the clergyman\r\nto publish the banns, and that Linda might thus become Valcarm\'s\r\nacknowledged wife before the snow was off the ground. Ludovic seemed\r\nto have his doubts about this, still signifying his preference for a\r\nmarriage at Munich. When Tetchen explained to him that Linda would\r\nlose her character by travelling with him to Munich before she was\r\nhis wife, he merely laughed at such an old wife\'s tale. Had not he\r\nhimself seen Fanny Heisse and Max Bogen in the train together between\r\nAugsburg and Nuremberg long before they were married, and who had\r\nthought of saying a word against Fanny\'s character? "But everybody\r\nknew about that," said Linda. "Let everybody know about this," said\r\nLudovic.\r\n\r\nBut Linda would not go. She would not go, even though Ludovic told\r\nher that it was imperative that he himself should quit Nuremberg.\r\nSuch matters were in training,--he did not tell her what matters,--as\r\nwould make his going quite imperative. Still she would take no step\r\ntowards going with him. That advice of Tetchen\'s was much more in\r\naccordance with her desires. If she could act upon that, then she\r\nmight have some happiness before her. She thought that she could\r\nmake up her mind, and bring herself to declare her purpose to her\r\naunt, if Ludovic would allow her to do so. But Ludovic declared that\r\nthis could not be done, as preparatory to their being married at\r\nNuremberg; and at last he was almost angry with her. Did she not\r\ntrust him? Oh, yes, she would trust him with everything; with her\r\nhappiness, her heart, her house,--with all that the world had left\r\nfor her. But there was still that feeling left within her bosom, that\r\nif she did this thing which he proposed, she would be trusting him\r\nwith her very soul.\r\n\r\nLudovic said a word to her about the house, and Tetchen said many\r\nwords. When Linda expressed an opinion, that though the house might\r\nnot belong to her aunt legally, it was or ought to be her aunt\'s\r\nproperty in point of honour, Tetchen only laughed at her. "Don\'t\r\nlet her bother you about Peter then, if she chooses to live here on\r\nfavour," said Tetchen. As Linda came to think of it, it did appear\r\nhard to her that she should be tormented about Peter Steinmarc in her\r\nown house. She was not Madame Staubach\'s child, nor her slave; nor,\r\nindeed, was she of childish age. Gradually the idea grew upon her\r\nthat she might assert her right to free herself from the tyranny to\r\nwhich she was made subject. But there was always joined to this a\r\nconsciousness, that though, according to the laws of the world, she\r\nmight assert her right, and claim her property, and acknowledge to\r\neverybody her love to Ludovic Valcarm, she could do none of these\r\nthings in accordance with the laws of God. She had become subject to\r\nher aunt by the circumstances of her life, as though her aunt were in\r\nfact her parent, and the fifth commandment was as binding on her as\r\nthough she were in truth the daughter of the guardian who had had her\r\nin charge since her infancy. Once she said a word to her aunt about\r\nthe house, and was struck with horror by the manner in which Madame\r\nStaubach had answered her. She had simply said that, as the house was\r\npartly hers, she had thought that she might suggest the expediency\r\nof getting another lodger in place of Peter Steinmarc. But Madame\r\nStaubach had arisen from her chair and had threatened to go at once\r\nout into the street,--"bare, naked, and destitute," as she expressed\r\nherself. "If you ever tell me again," said Madame Staubach, "that the\r\nhouse is yours, I will never eat another meal beneath your father\'s\r\nroof." Linda, shocked at her own wickedness, had fallen at her aunt\'s\r\nknees, and promised that she would never again be guilty of such\r\nwickedness. And as she reflected on what she had done, she did\r\nbelieve herself to have been very mean and very wicked. She had known\r\nall her life that, though the house was hers to live in, it was\r\nsubject to the guidance of her aunt; and so had she been subject till\r\nshe had grown to be a woman. She could not quite understand that such\r\nsubjection for the whole term of her life need be a duty to her; but\r\nwhen was the term of duty to be completed?\r\n\r\nBetween her own feelings on one side, and Tetchen\'s continued\r\ninstigation on the other, she became aware that that which she truly\r\nneeded was advice. These secret interviews and this clandestine\r\ncorrespondence were terrible to her very soul. She would not even yet\r\nbe a castaway if it might be possible to save herself! There were two\r\nthings fixed for her,--fixed, even though by their certainty she must\r\nbecome a castaway. She would never marry Peter Steinmarc, and she\r\nwould never cease to love Ludovic Valcarm. But might it be possible\r\nthat these assured facts should be reconciled to duty? If only there\r\nwere somebody whom she might trust to tell her that!\r\n\r\nLinda\'s father had had many friends in Nuremberg, and she could still\r\nremember those whom, as a child, she had seen from time to time in\r\nher father\'s house. The names of some were still familiar to her, and\r\nthe memories of the faces even of one or two who had suffered her\r\nto play at their knees when she was little more than a baby, were\r\npresent to her. Manners had so changed at the red house since those\r\ndays, that few, if any, of these alliances had been preserved. The\r\npeculiar creed of Madame Staubach was not popular with the burghers\r\nof Nuremberg, and we all know how family friendships will die out\r\nwhen they are not kept alive by the warmth of familiar intercourse.\r\nThere were still a few, and they among those most respected in the\r\ncity, who would bow to Madame Staubach when they met her in the\r\nstreets, and would smile and nod at Linda as they remembered the old\r\ndays when they would be merry with a decorous mirth in the presence\r\nof her father. But there were none in the town,--no, not one,--who\r\ncould interfere as a friend in the affairs of the widow Staubach\'s\r\nhousehold, or who ever thought of asking Linda to sit at a friendly\r\nhearth. Close neighbourhood and school acquaintance had made Fanny\r\nHeisse her friend, but it was very rarely indeed that she had set her\r\nfoot over the threshold of Jacob\'s door. Peter Steinmarc was their\r\nonly friend, and his friendship had arisen from the mere fact of his\r\nresidence beneath the same roof. It was necessary that their house\r\nshould be divided with another, and in this way Peter had become\r\ntheir lodger. Linda certainly could not go to Peter for advice. She\r\nwould have gone to Jacob Heisse, but that Jacob was a man slow of\r\nspeech, somewhat timid in all matters beyond the making of furniture,\r\nand but little inclined to meddle with things out of his own reach.\r\nShe fancied that the counsel which she required should be sought for\r\nfrom some one wiser and more learned than Jacob Heisse.\r\n\r\nAmong the names of those who had loved her father, which still\r\nrested in her memory, was that of Herr Molk, a man much spoken of\r\nin Nuremberg, one rich and of great repute, who was or had been\r\nburgomaster, and who occupied a house on the Egidien Platz, known to\r\nLinda well, because of its picturesque beauty. Even Peter Steinmarc,\r\nwho would often speak of the town magistrates as though they were\r\ngreatly inferior to himself in municipal lore and general wisdom,\r\nwould mention the name of Herr Molk with almost involuntary respect.\r\nLinda had seen him from time to time either in the Platz or on the\r\nmarket-place, and her father\'s old friend had always smiled on her\r\nand expressed some hope that she was well and happy. Ah, how vain had\r\nbeen that hope! What if she should now go to Herr Molk and ask him\r\nfor advice? She would not speak to Tetchen, because Tetchen would at\r\nonce tell it all to Ludovic; and in this matter, as Linda felt, she\r\nmust not act as Ludovic would bid her. Yes; she would go to this\r\nnoted pundit of the city, and, if he would allow her so to do, would\r\ntell to him all her story.\r\n\r\nAnd then she made another resolve. She would not do this without\r\ninforming her aunt that it was about to be done. On this occasion,\r\neven though her aunt should tell her to remain in the house, she\r\nwould go forth. But her aunt should not throw it in her teeth that\r\nshe had acted on the sly. One day, one cold November morning, when\r\nthe hour of their early dinner was approaching, she went up-stairs\r\nfrom the kitchen for her hat and cloak, and then, equipped for her\r\nwalk, presented herself before her aunt.\r\n\r\n"Linda, where are you going?" demanded Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"I am going, aunt Charlotte, to Herr Molk, in the Egidien Platz."\r\n\r\n"To Herr Molk? And why? Has he bidden you come to him?" Then Linda\r\ntold her story, with much difficulty. She was unhappy, she said, and\r\nwanted advice. She remembered this man,--that he was the friend of\r\nher father. "I am sorry, Linda, that you should want other advice\r\nthan that which I can give you."\r\n\r\n"Dear aunt, it is just that. You want me to marry this man here, and\r\nI cannot do it. This has made you miserable, and me miserable. Is it\r\nnot true that we are not happy as we used to be?"\r\n\r\n"I certainly am not happy. How can I be happy when I see you\r\nwandering astray? How can I be happy when you tell me that you love\r\nthe man in Nuremberg whom I believe of all to be most wicked and\r\nungodly? How can I be happy when you threaten to expel from the\r\nhouse, because it is your own, the only man whom I love, honour, and\r\nrespect?"\r\n\r\n"I never said so, aunt Charlotte;--I never thought of saying such a\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"And what will you ask of this stranger should you find yourself in\r\nhis presence?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell him everything, and ask him what I should do."\r\n\r\n"And will you tell him truly?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, aunt Charlotte; I will tell him the truth in everything."\r\n\r\n"And if he bids you marry the man whom I have chosen as your\r\nhusband?" Linda, when this suggestion was made to her, became silent.\r\nTruly it was impossible that any wise man in Nuremberg could tell her\r\nthat such a sacrifice as that was necessary! Then Madame Staubach\r\nrepeated the question. "If he bids you marry Peter Steinmarc, will\r\nyou do as he bids you?"\r\n\r\nSurely she would not be so bidden by her father\'s friend! "I will\r\nendeavour to do as he bids me," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"Then go to him, my child, and may God so give him grace that he may\r\nsoften the hardness of your heart, and prevail with you to put down\r\nbeneath your feet the temptations of Satan; and that he may quell the\r\nspirit of evil within you. God forbid that I should think that there\r\nis no wisdom in Nuremberg fitter than mine to guide you. If the man\r\nbe a man of God, he will give you good counsel."\r\n\r\nThen Linda, wondering much at her aunt\'s ready acquiescence, went\r\nforth, and walked straightway to the house of Herr Molk in the\r\nEgidien Platz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nA walk of ten minutes took Linda from the Sch\xfctt island to the\r\nEgidien Platz, and placed her before the door of Herr Molk\'s house.\r\nThe Egidien Platz is, perhaps, the most fashionable quarter of\r\nNuremberg, if Nuremberg may be said to have a fashion in such\r\nmatters. It is near to the Rathhaus, and to St. Sebald\'s Church, and\r\nis not far distant from the old Burg or Castle in which the Emperors\r\nused to dwell when they visited the imperial city of Nuremberg.\r\nThis large open Place has a church in its centre, and around it are\r\nhouses almost all large, built with gables turned towards the street,\r\nquaint, picturesque, and eloquent of much burghers\' wealth. There\r\ncould be no such square in a city which was not or had not been very\r\nrich. And among all the houses in the Egidien Platz, there was no\r\nhouse to exceed in beauty of ornament, in quaintness of architecture,\r\nor in general wealth and comfort, that which was inhabited by Herr\r\nMolk.\r\n\r\nLinda stood for a moment at the door, and then putting up her hand,\r\npulled down the heavy iron bell-handle, which itself was a gem of\r\nart, representing some ancient and discreet burgher of the town,\r\nwrapped in his cloak, and almost hidden by his broad-brimmed hat. She\r\nheard the bell clank close inside the door, and then the portal was\r\nopen, as though the very pulling of the bell had opened it. The lock\r\nat least was open, so that Linda could push the door with her hand\r\nand enter over the threshold. This she did, and she found herself\r\nwithin a long narrow court or yard, round which, one above another,\r\nthere ran galleries, open to the court, and guarded with heavy\r\nbalustrades of carved wood. From the narrowness of the enclosure, the\r\nhouse on each side seemed to be very high, and Linda, looking round\r\nwith astonished eyes, could see that at every point the wood was\r\ncarved. And the waterspouts were ornamented with grotesque figures,\r\nand the huge broad stairs which led to the open galleries on the\r\nleft hand were of polished oak, made so slippery with the polishers\'\r\ndaily care that it was difficult to tread upon them without falling.\r\nAll around the bottom of the court there were open granaries or\r\nwarehouses; for there seemed to be nothing that could be called a\r\nroom on the ground floor, beyond the porter\'s lodge; and these open\r\nwarehouses seemed to be filled full with masses of stacked firewood.\r\nLinda knew well the value of such stores in Nuremberg, and lost none\r\nof her veneration for Herr Molk because of such nature were the signs\r\nof his domestic wealth.\r\n\r\nAs she timidly looked around her she saw an old woman within the gate\r\nof the porter\'s lodge, and inquired whether Herr Molk was at home and\r\ndisengaged. The woman simply motioned her to the wicket gate by which\r\nthe broad polished stairs were guarded. Linda, hesitating to advance\r\ninto so grand a mansion alone, and yet knowing that she should do\r\nas she was bidden, entered the wicket and ascended carefully to the\r\nfirst gallery. Here was another bell ready to her hand, the handle of\r\nwhich consisted of a little child in iron-work. This also she pulled,\r\nand waited till some one should come. Presently there was a scuffling\r\nheard of quick feet in the gallery, and three children ran up to her.\r\nIn the middle was the elder, a girl dressed in dark silk, and at her\r\nsides were two boys habited in black velvet. They all had long fair\r\nhair, and large blue eyes, and soft peach-like cheeks,--such as those\r\nwho love children always long to kiss. Linda thought that she had\r\nnever seen children so gracious and so fair. She asked again whether\r\nHerr Molk was at home, and at liberty to see a stranger. "Quite a\r\nstranger," said poor Linda, with what emphasis she could put upon her\r\nwords. The little girl said that her grandfather was at home, and\r\nwould see any visitor,--as a matter of course. Would Linda follow\r\nher? Then the child, still leading her little brothers, tripped up\r\nthe stairs to the second gallery, and opening a door which led into\r\none of the large front rooms, communicated to an old gentleman who\r\nseemed to be taking exercise in the apartment with his hands behind\r\nhis back, that he was wanted by a lady.\r\n\r\n"Wanted, am I, my pretty one? Well, and here I am." Then the little\r\ngirl, giving a long look up into Linda\'s face, retreated, taking her\r\nbrothers with her, and closing the door. Thus Linda found herself\r\nin the room along with the old gentleman, who still kept his hands\r\nbehind his back. It was a singular apartment, nearly square, but very\r\nlarge, panelled with carved wood, not only throughout the walls, but\r\nup to the ceiling also. And the floor was polished even brighter than\r\nwere the stairs. Herr Molk must have been well accustomed to take\r\nhis exercise there, or he would surely have slipped and fallen in\r\nhis course. There was but one small table in the room, which stood\r\nunused near a wall, and there were perhaps not more than half-a-dozen\r\nchairs,--all high-backed, covered with old tapestry, and looking as\r\nthough they could hardly have been placed there for ordinary use.\r\nOn one of these, Linda sat at the old man\'s bidding; and he placed\r\nhimself on another, with his hands still behind him, just seating\r\nhimself on the edge of the chair.\r\n\r\n"I am Linda Tressel," said poor Linda. She saw at a glance that she\r\nherself would not have known Herr Molk, whom she had never before met\r\nwithout his hat, and she perceived also that he had not recognised\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Linda Tressel! So you are. Dear, dear! I knew your father\r\nwell,--very well. But, lord, how long that is ago! He is dead ever so\r\nmany years; how many years?"\r\n\r\n"Sixteen years," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"Sixteen years dead! And he was a younger man than I,--much younger.\r\nLet me see,--not so much younger, but younger. Linda Tressel, your\r\nfather\'s daughter is welcome to my house. A glass of wine will not\r\nhurt you this cold weather." She declined the wine, but the old man\r\nwould have his way. He went out, and was absent perhaps five minutes.\r\nThen he returned bearing a small tray in his own hands, with a\r\nlong-necked bottle and glasses curiously engraved, and he insisted\r\nthat Linda should clink her glass with his. "And now, my dear, what\r\nis it that I can do for you?"\r\n\r\nSo far Linda\'s mission had prospered well; but now that the story was\r\nto be told, she found very much difficulty in telling it. She had to\r\nbegin with the whole history of the red house, and of the terms upon\r\nwhich her aunt had come to reside in it. She had one point at least\r\nin her favour. Herr Molk was an excellent listener. He would nod his\r\nhead, and pat one hand upon the other, and say, "Yes, yes," without\r\nthe slightest sign of impatience. It seemed as though he had no other\r\ncare before him than that of listening to Linda\'s story. When she\r\nexperienced the encouragement which came from the nodding of his\r\nhead and the patting of his hand, she went on boldly. She told how\r\nPeter Steinmarc had come to the house, and how her aunt was a woman\r\npeculiar from the strength of her religious convictions. "Yes, my\r\ndear, yes; we know that,--we know that," said Herr Molk. Linda did\r\nher best to say nothing evil of her aunt. Then she came to the story\r\nof Peter\'s courtship. "He is quite an old man, you know," said poor\r\nLinda, thoughtfully. Then she was interrupted by Herr Molk. "A worthy\r\nman; I know him well,--well,--well. Peter Steinmarc is our clerk\r\nat the Rathhaus. A very worthy man is Peter Steinmarc. Your father,\r\nmy dear, was clerk at the Rathhaus, and Peter followed him. He is\r\nnot young,--not just young; but a very worthy man. Go on, my dear."\r\nLinda had resolved to tell it all, and she did tell it all. It was\r\ndifficult to tell, but it all came out. Perhaps there could be no\r\nlistener more encouraging to such a girl as Linda than the patient,\r\ngentle-mannered old man with whom she was closeted. "She had a lover\r\nwhom she loved dearly," she said,--"a young man."\r\n\r\n"Oh, a lover," said Herr Molk. But there seemed to be no anger in\r\nhis voice. He received the information as though it were important,\r\nbut not astonishing. Then Linda even told him how the lover had come\r\nacross the river on the Sunday morning, and how it had happened that\r\nshe had not told her aunt, and how angry her aunt had been. "Yes,\r\nyes," said Herr Molk; "it is better that your elders should know such\r\nthings,--always better. But go on, my dear." Then she told also how\r\nthe lover had come down, or had gone up, through the rafters, and the\r\nold man smiled. Perhaps he had hidden himself among rafters fifty\r\nyears ago, and had some sweet remembrance of the feat. And now Linda\r\nwanted to know what was she to do, and how she ought to act. The\r\nhouse was her own, but she would not for worlds drive her aunt out\r\nof it. She loved her lover very dearly, and she could not love Peter\r\nSteinmarc at all,--not in that way.\r\n\r\n"Has the young man means to support a wife?" asked Herr Molk. Linda\r\nhesitated, knowing that there was still a thing to be told, which she\r\nhad not as yet dared to mention. She knew too that it must be told.\r\nHerr Molk, as she hesitated, asked a second question on this very\r\npoint. "And what is the young man\'s name, my dear? It all depends on\r\nhis name and character, and whether he has means to support a wife."\r\n\r\n"His name--is--Ludovic Valcarm," said Linda, whispering the words\r\nvery low.\r\n\r\nThe old man jumped from his seat with an alacrity that Linda had\r\ncertainly not expected. "Ludovic--Valcarm!" he said; "why, my dear,\r\nthe man is in prison this moment. I signed the committal yesterday\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"In prison!" said Linda, rising also from her chair.\r\n\r\n"He is a terrible young man," said Herr Molk--"a very terrible young\r\nman. He does all manner of things;--I can\'t explain what. My dear\r\nyoung woman, you must not think of taking Ludovic Valcarm for your\r\nhusband; you must not, indeed. You had better make up your mind to\r\ntake Peter Steinmarc. Peter Steinmarc can support a wife, and is very\r\nrespectable. I have known Peter all my life. Ludovic Valcarm! Oh\r\ndear! That would be very bad,--very bad indeed!"\r\n\r\nLinda\'s distress was excessive. It was not only that the tidings\r\nwhich she heard of Ludovic were hard to bear, but it seemed that\r\nHerr Molk was intent on ranging himself altogether with her enemies\r\nrespecting Peter Steinmarc. In fact, the old man\'s advice to her\r\nrespecting Peter was more important in her mind that his denunciation\r\nof Ludovic. She did not quite credit what he said of Ludovic. It\r\nwas doubtless true that Ludovic was in prison; probably for some\r\npolitical offence. But such men, she thought, were not kept in prison\r\nlong. It was bad, this fact of her lover\'s imprisonment; but not so\r\nbad as the advice which her counsellor gave her, and which she knew\r\nshe would be bound to repeat to her aunt.\r\n\r\n"But, Herr Molk, sir, if I do not love Peter Steinmarc--if I hate\r\nhim--?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, my dear! This is a terrible thing. There is not such\r\nanother ne\'er-do-well in all Nuremberg as Ludovic Valcarm. Support\r\na wife! He cannot support himself. And it will be well if he\r\ndoes not die in a jail. Oh dear! oh dear! For your father\'s sake,\r\nfraulein--for your father\'s sake, I would go any distance to save you\r\nfrom this. Your father was a good man, and a credit to the city. And\r\nPeter Steinmarc is a good man."\r\n\r\n"But I need not marry Peter Steinmarc, Herr Molk."\r\n\r\n"You cannot do better, my dear,--indeed you cannot. See what your\r\naunt says. And remember, my dear, that you should submit yourself to\r\nyour elders and your betters. Peter is not so old. He is not old at\r\nall. I was one of the city magistrates when Peter was a little boy. I\r\nremember him well. And he began life in your father\'s office. Nothing\r\ncan be more respectable than he has been. And then Ludovic Valcarm!\r\noh dear! If you ask my advice, I should counsel you to accept Peter\r\nSteinmarc."\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to be got from Herr Molk. And with this\r\nterrible recommendation still sounding in her ears, Linda sadly made\r\nher way back from the Egidien Platz to the Sch\xfctt island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nLinda Tressel, as she returned home to the house in the Sch\xfctt\r\nisland, became aware that it was necessary for her to tell to her\r\naunt all that had passed between herself and Herr Molk. She had been\r\nhalf stunned with grief as she left the magistrate\'s house, and for\r\na while had tried to think that she could keep back from Madame\r\nStaubach at any rate the purport of the advice that had been given to\r\nher. And as she came to the conclusion that this would be impossible\r\nto her,--that it must all come out,--various wild plans flitted\r\nacross her brain. Could she not run away without returning to the red\r\nhouse at all? But whither was she to run, and with whom? The only one\r\nwho would have helped her in this wild enterprise had been sent to\r\nprison by that ill-conditioned old man who had made her so miserable!\r\nAt this moment, there was no longer any hope in her bosom that she\r\nshould save herself from being a castaway; nay, there was hardly a\r\nwish. There was no disreputable life so terrible to her thoughts, no\r\ninfamy so infamous in idea to her, as would be respectability in the\r\nform of matrimony with Peter Steinmarc. And now, as she walked along\r\npainfully, going far out of her way that she might have some little\r\ntime for reflection, turning all this in her mind, she began almost\r\nto fear that if she went back to her aunt, her aunt would prevail,\r\nand that in very truth Peter Steinmarc would become her lord and\r\nmaster. Then there was another plan, as impracticable as that scheme\r\nof running away. What if she were to become sullen, and decline to\r\nspeak at all? She was well aware that in such a contest her aunt\'s\r\ntongue would be very terrible to her; and as the idea crossed her\r\nmind, she told herself that were she so to act people would treat\r\nher as a mad woman. But even that, she thought, would be better than\r\nbeing forced to marry Peter Steinmarc. Before she had reached the\r\nisland, she knew that the one scheme was as impossible as the other.\r\nShe entered the house very quietly, and turning to the left went at\r\nonce into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Linda, your aunt is waiting dinner for you this hour," said Tetchen.\r\n\r\n"Why did you not take it to her by herself?" said Linda, crossly.\r\n\r\n"How could I do that, when she would not have it? You had better go\r\nin now at once. But, Linda, does anything ail you?"\r\n\r\n"Very much ails me," said Linda.\r\n\r\nThen Tetchen came close to her, and whispered, "Have you heard\r\nanything about him?"\r\n\r\n"What have you heard, Tetchen? Tell me at once."\r\n\r\n"He is in trouble."\r\n\r\n"He is in prison!" Linda said this with a little hysteric scream.\r\nThen she began to sob and cry, and turned her back to Tetchen and hid\r\nher face in her hands.\r\n\r\n"I have heard that too," said Tetchen. "They say the burgomasters\r\nhave caught him with letters on him from some terrible rebels up in\r\nPrussia, and that he has been plotting to have the city burned down.\r\nBut I don\'t believe all that, fraulein."\r\n\r\n"He is in prison. I know he is in prison," said Linda. "I wish I\r\nwere there too;--so I do, or dead. I\'d rather be dead." Then Madame\r\nStaubach, having perhaps heard the lock of the front door when it was\r\nclosed, came into the kitchen. "Linda," she said, "I am waiting for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I do not want any dinner," said Linda, still standing with her face\r\nturned to the wall. Then Madame Staubach took hold of her arm, and\r\nled her across the passage into the parlour. Linda said not a word as\r\nshe was being thus conducted, but was thinking whether it might not\r\neven yet serve her purpose to be silent and sullen. She was still\r\nsobbing, and striving to repress her sobs; but she allowed herself to\r\nbe led without resistance, and in an instant the door was closed, and\r\nshe was seated on the old sofa with her aunt beside her.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Herr Molk?" demanded Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have seen him."\r\n\r\n"And what has he said to you?" Then Linda was silent. "You told me\r\nthat you would seek his counsel; and that you would act as he might\r\nadvise you."\r\n\r\n"No; I did not say that."\r\n\r\n"Linda!"\r\n\r\n"I did not promise. I made no promise."\r\n\r\n"Linda, surely you did promise. When I asked you whether you would do\r\nas he might bid you, you said that you would be ruled by him. Then,\r\nknowing that he is wise, and of repute in the city, I let you go.\r\nLinda, was it not so?" Linda could not remember what words had in\r\ntruth been spoken between them. She did remember that in her anxiety\r\nto go forth, thinking it to be impossible that the burgomaster should\r\nask her to marry a man old enough to be her father, she had in some\r\nway assented to her aunt\'s proposition. But yet she thought that she\r\nhad made no definite promise that she would marry the man she hated.\r\nShe did not believe that she would absolutely have promised that\r\nunder any possible circumstances she would do so. She could not,\r\nhowever, answer her aunt\'s question; so she continued to sob, and\r\nendeavoured again to hide her face. "Did you tell the man everything,\r\nmy child?" demanded Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did."\r\n\r\n"And what has he said to you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know! Linda, that cannot be true. It is not yet half an\r\nhour since, and you do not know what Herr Molk said to you? Did you\r\ntell him of my wish about our friend Peter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did."\r\n\r\n"And did you tell him of your foolish fancy for that wicked young\r\nman?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say?"\r\n\r\nLinda was still silent. It was almost impossible for her to tell her\r\naunt what the man had said to her. She could not bring herself to\r\ntell the story of what had passed in the panelled room. Had Madame\r\nStaubach been in any way different from what she was,--had she been\r\nat all less stubborn, less hard, less reliant on the efficacy of her\r\nreligious convictions to carry her over all obstacles,--she would\r\nhave understood something of the sufferings of the poor girl with\r\nwhom she was dealing. But with her the only idea present to her mind\r\nwas the absolute necessity of saving Linda from the wrath to come by\r\nbreaking her spirit in regard to things of this world, and crushing\r\nher into atoms here, that those atoms might be remoulded in a\r\nform that would be capable of a future and a better life. Instead\r\ntherefore of shrinking from cruelty, Madame Staubach was continually\r\ninstigating herself to be cruel. She knew that the image of the\r\ntown-clerk was one simply disgusting to Linda, and therefore she was\r\ndetermined to force that image upon her. She knew that the girl\'s\r\nheart was set upon Ludovic Valcarm with all the warmth of its young\r\nlove, and therefore she conceived it to be her duty to prove to the\r\ngirl that Ludovic Valcarm was one already given up to Satan and\r\nSatanic agencies. Linda must be taught not only to acknowledge, but\r\nin very fact to understand and perceive, that this world is a vale\r\nof tears, that its paths are sharp to the feet, and that they who\r\nwalk through it should walk in mourning and tribulation. What though\r\nher young heart should be broken by the lesson,--be broken after\r\nthe fashion in which human hearts are made to suffer? To Madame\r\nStaubach\'s mind a broken heart and a contrite spirit were pretty\r\nmuch the same thing. It was good that hearts should be broken, that\r\nall the inner humanities of the living being should be, as it were,\r\ncrushed on a wheel and ground into fragments, so that nothing should\r\nbe left capable of receiving pleasure from the delights of this\r\nworld. Such, according to her theory of life, was the treatment to\r\nwhich young women should be subjected. The system needed for men\r\nmight probably be different. It was necessary that they should go\r\nforth and work; and Madame Staubach conceived it to be possible that\r\nthe work of the world could not be adequately done by men who had\r\nbeen subjected to the crushing process which was requisite for women.\r\nTherefore it was that she admitted Peter Steinmarc to her confidence\r\nas a worthy friend, though Peter was by no means a man enfranchised\r\nfrom the thralls of the earth. Of young women there was but one\r\nwith whom she could herself deal; but in regard to that one Madame\r\nStaubach was resolved that no softness of heart should deter her from\r\nher duty. "Linda," she said, after pausing for a while, "I desire to\r\nknow from you what Herr Molk has said to you!" Then there was a short\r\nperiod of silence. "Linda, did he sanction your love for Ludovic\r\nValcarm?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Linda, sullenly.\r\n\r\n"I should think not, indeed! And, Linda, did he bid you be rebellious\r\nin that other matter?"\r\n\r\nLinda paused again before she answered; but it was but for a moment,\r\nand then she replied, in the same voice, "No."\r\n\r\n"Did he tell you that you had better take Peter Steinmarc for your\r\nhusband?" Linda could not bring herself to answer this, but sat\r\nbeating the floor with her foot, and with her face turned away and\r\nher eyes fixed upon the wall. She was no longer sobbing now, but\r\nwas hardening herself against her aunt. She was resolving that she\r\nwould be a castaway,--that she would have nothing more to do with\r\ngodliness, or even with decency. She had found godliness and decency\r\ntoo heavy to be borne. In all her life, had not that moment in which\r\nLudovic had held her tight bound by his arm round her waist been\r\nthe happiest? Had it not been to her, her one single morsel of real\r\nbliss? She was thinking now whether she would fly round upon her aunt\r\nand astonish her tyrant by a declaration of principles that should be\r\naltogether new. Then came the question again in the same hard voice,\r\n"Did he not tell you that you had better take Peter Steinmarc for\r\nyour husband?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t take Peter Steinmarc for my husband," said Linda; and she\r\ndid in part effect that flying round of which she had been thinking.\r\n"I won\'t take Peter Steinmarc for my husband, let the man say what he\r\nmay. How can I marry him if I hate him? He is a--beast."\r\n\r\nThen Madame Staubach groaned. Linda had often heard her groan, but\r\nhad never known her to groan as she groaned now. It was very deep and\r\nvery low, and prolonged with a cadence that caused Linda to tremble\r\nin every limb. And Linda understood it thoroughly. It was as though\r\nher aunt had been told by an angel that Satan was coming to her house\r\nin person that day. And Linda did that which the reader also should\r\ndo. She gave to her aunt full credit for pure sincerity in her\r\nfeelings. Madame Staubach did believe that Satan was coming for her\r\nniece, if not actually come; he was close at hand, if not arrived.\r\nThe crushing, if done at all, must be done instantly, so that Satan\r\nshould find the spirit so broken and torn to paltry fragments as not\r\nto be worth his acceptance. She stretched forth her hand and took\r\nhold of her niece. "Linda," she said, "do you ever think of the\r\nbourne to which the wicked ones go;--they who are wicked as you now\r\nare wicked?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot help it," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"And did he not bid you take this man for your husband?"\r\n\r\n"I will not do his bidding, then! It would kill me. Do you not know\r\nthat I love Ludovic better than all the world? He is in prison,\r\nbut shall I cease to love him for that reason? He came to me once\r\nup-stairs at night when you were sitting here with that--beast, and I\r\nswore to him then that I would never love another man,--that I should\r\nnever marry anybody else!"\r\n\r\n"Came to you once up-stairs at night! To your own chamber?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he did. You may know all about it, if you please. You may know\r\neverything. I don\'t want anything to be secret. He came to me, and\r\nwhen he had his arms round me I told him that I was his own,--his\r\nown,--his own. How can I be the wife of another man after that?"\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach was so truly horrified by what she had first heard,\r\nwas so astonished, that she omitted even to groan. Valcarm had been\r\nwith this wretched girl up in her own chamber! She hardly even now\r\nbelieved that which it seemed to her that she was called upon to\r\nbelieve, having never as yet for a moment doubted the real purity\r\nof her niece even when she was most vehemently denouncing her as a\r\nreprobate, a castaway, and a child of Satan. The reader will know to\r\nwhat extent Linda had been imprudent, to what extent she had sinned.\r\nBut Madame Staubach did not know. She had nothing to guide her but\r\nthe words of this poor girl who had been so driven to desperation by\r\nthe misery which enveloped her, that she almost wished to be taken\r\nfor worse than she was in order that she might escape the terrible\r\ndoom from which she saw no other means of escape. Nobody, it is true,\r\ncould have forced her to marry Peter Steinmarc. There was no law, no\r\ncustom in Nuremberg, which would have assisted her aunt, or Peter, or\r\neven the much-esteemed and venerable Herr Molk himself, in compelling\r\nher to submit to such nuptials. She was free to exercise her own\r\nchoice, if only she had had strength to assert her freedom. But\r\nyouth, which rebels so often against the authority and wisdom of age,\r\nis also subject to much tyranny from age. Linda did not know the\r\nstrength of her own position, had not learned to recognise the fact\r\nof her own individuality. She feared the power of her aunt over her,\r\nand through her aunt the power of the man whom she hated; and she\r\nfeared the now provoked authority of Herr Molk, who had been with\r\nher weak as a child is weak, counselling her to submit herself to\r\na suitor unfitted for her, because another man who loved her was\r\nalso unfit. And, moreover, Linda, though she was now willing in her\r\ndesperation to cast aside all religious scruples of her own, still\r\nfeared those with which her aunt was armed. Unless she did something,\r\nor at least said something, to separate herself entirely from her\r\naunt, this terrible domestic tyrant would overcome her by the fear\r\nof denunciation, which would terrify her soul even though she had\r\ndared to declare to herself that in her stress of misery she would\r\nthrow overboard all consideration of her soul\'s welfare. Though she\r\nintended no longer to live in accordance with her religious belief,\r\nshe feared what religion could say to her,--dreaded to the very\r\nmarrow of her bones the threats of God\'s anger and of Satan\'s power\r\nwith which her aunt would harass her. If only she could rid herself\r\nof it all! Therefore, though she perceived that the story which she\r\nhad told of herself had filled her aunt\'s mind with a horrible and a\r\nfalse suspicion, she said nothing to correct the error. Therefore she\r\nsaid nothing further, though her aunt sat looking at her with open\r\nmouth, and eyes full of terror, and hands clasped, and pale cheeks.\r\n\r\n"In this house,--in this very house!" said Madame Staubach, not\r\nknowing what it might best become her to say in such a strait as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n"The house is as much mine as yours," said Linda, sullenly. And she\r\ntoo, in saying this, had not known what she meant to say, or what\r\nshe ought to have said. Her aunt had alluded to the house, and there\r\nseemed to her, in her distress, to be something in that on which she\r\ncould hang a word.\r\n\r\nFor a while her aunt sat in silence looking at Linda, and then she\r\nfell upon her knees, with her hands clasped to heaven. What was the\r\nmatter of her prayers we may not here venture to surmise; but, such\r\nas they were, they were sincere. Then she arose and went slowly\r\nas far as the door, but she returned before she had reached the\r\nthreshold. "Wretched child!" she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you have made me wretched," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, Linda, if so much grace is left to you. After what\r\nyou have told me, I cannot but suppose that all hope of happiness or\r\ncomfort in this world is over both for you and me."\r\n\r\n"For myself, I wish I were dead," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"Have you no thought of what will come after death? Oh, my child,\r\nrepentance is still possible to you, and with repentance there will\r\ncome at length grace and salvation. Mary Magdalene was blessed,--was\r\nspecially blessed among women."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw!" said Linda, indignantly. What had she to do with Mary\r\nMagdalene? The reality of her position then came upon her, and\r\nnot the facts of that position which she had for a moment almost\r\nendeavoured to simulate.\r\n\r\n"Do you not hate yourself for what you have done?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no. But I hate Peter Steinmarc, and I hate Herr Molk, and if\r\nyou are so cruel to me I shall hate you. I have done nothing wrong. I\r\ncould not help it if he came up-stairs. He came because he loved me,\r\nand because you would not let him come in a proper way. Nobody else\r\nloves me, but he would do anything for me. And now they have thrown\r\nhim into prison!"\r\n\r\nThe case was so singular in all its bearings, that Madame Staubach\r\ncould make nothing of it. Linda seemed to have confessed her\r\niniquity, and yet, after her confession, spoke of herself as though\r\nshe were the injured person,--of herself and her lover as though they\r\nwere both ill used. According to Madame Staubach\'s own ideas, Linda\r\nought now to have been in the dust, dissolved in tears, wiping the\r\nfloor with her hair, utterly subdued in spirit, hating herself as the\r\nvilest of God\'s creatures. But there was not even an outward sign of\r\ncontrition. And then, in the midst of all this real tragedy, Tetchen\r\nbrought in the dinner. The two women sat down together, but neither\r\nof them spoke a word. Linda did eat something,--a morsel or two; but\r\nMadame Staubach would not touch the food on the table. Then Tetchen\r\nwas summoned to take away the all but unused plates. Tetchen, when\r\nshe saw how it had been, said nothing, but looked from the face of\r\none to the face of the other. "She has heard all about that scamp\r\nLudovic," said Tetchen to herself, as she carried the dishes back\r\ninto the kitchen.\r\n\r\nIt had been late when the dinner had been brought to them, and the\r\ndusk of the evening came upon them as soon as Tetchen\'s clatter with\r\nthe crockery was done. Madame Staubach sat in her accustomed chair,\r\nwith her eyes closed, and her hands clasped on her lap before her. A\r\nstranger might have thought that she was asleep, but Linda knew that\r\nher aunt was not sleeping. She also sat silent till she thought that\r\nthe time was drawing near at which Steinmarc might probably enter the\r\nparlour. Then she arose to go, but could not leave her aunt without\r\na word. "Aunt Charlotte," she said, "I am ill,--very ill; my head is\r\nthrobbing, and I will go to bed." Madame Staubach merely shook her\r\nhead, and shook her hands, and remained silent, with her eyes still\r\nclosed. She had not even yet resolved upon the words with which it\r\nwould be expedient that she should address her niece. Then Linda left\r\nthe room, and went to her own apartment.\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach, when she was alone, sobbed and cried, and kneeled\r\nand prayed, and walked the length and breadth of the room in an agony\r\nof despair and doubt. She also was in want of a counsellor to whom\r\nshe could go in her present misery. And there was no such counsellor.\r\nIt seemed to her to be impossible that she should confide everything\r\nto Peter Steinmarc. And yet it was no more than honest that Peter\r\nshould be told before he was allowed to continue his courtship. Even\r\nnow, though she had seen Linda\'s misery, Madame Staubach thought that\r\nthe marriage which she had been so anxious to arrange would be the\r\nsafest way out of all their troubles,--if only Peter might be brought\r\nto consent to it after hearing all the truth. And she fancied that\r\nthose traits in Peter\'s character, appearance, and demeanour which\r\nwere so revolting to Linda would be additional means of bringing\r\nLinda back from the slough of despond,--if only such a marriage might\r\nstill be possible. But the crushing must be more severe than had\r\nhitherto been intended, the weights imposed must be heavier, and the\r\nhuman atoms smaller and more like the dust.\r\n\r\nWhile she was meditating on this there came the usual knock at\r\nthe door, and Steinmarc entered the room. She greeted him, as was\r\nher wont, with but a word or two, and he sat down and lighted his\r\npipe. An observant man might have known, even from the sound of her\r\nbreathing, that something had stirred Madame Staubach more than\r\nusual. But Peter was not an observant man, and, having something\r\non his own mind, paid but little attention to the widow. At last,\r\nhaving finished his first pipe and filled it again, he spoke. "Madame\r\nStaubach," he said, "I have been thinking about Linda Tressel."\r\n\r\n"And so have I, Peter," said Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"Yes,--of course; that is natural. She is your niece, and you and she\r\nhave interests in common."\r\n\r\n"What interests, Peter? Ah me! I wish we had."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is all right that you should, and I say nothing about\r\nthat. But, Madame Staubach, I do not like to be made a fool of;--I\r\nparticularly object to be made a fool of. If Linda is to become my\r\nwife, there is not any time to be lost." Then Peter recommenced the\r\nsmoking of his new-lighted pipe with great vigour.\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach at this moment became a martyr to great scruples. Was\r\nit her duty, or was it not her duty, to tell Peter at this moment all\r\nthat she had heard to-day? She rather thought that it was her duty to\r\ndo so, and yet she was restrained by some feeling of feminine honour\r\nfrom disgracing her niece,--by some feeling of feminine honour for\r\nwhich she afterwards did penance with many inward flagellations of\r\nthe spirit.\r\n\r\n"You must not be too hard upon her, Peter," said Madame Staubach with\r\na trembling voice.\r\n\r\n"It is all very well saying that, and I do not think that I am the\r\nman to be hard upon any one. But the fact is that this young woman\r\nhas got a lover, which is a thing of which I do not approve. I do not\r\napprove of it at all, Madame Staubach. Some persons who stand very\r\nhigh indeed in the city,--indeed I may say that none in Nuremberg\r\nstand higher,--have asked me to-day whether I am engaged to marry\r\nLinda Tressel. What answer am I to make when I am so asked, Madame\r\nStaubach? One of our leading burgomasters was good enough to say\r\nthat he hoped it was so for the young woman\'s sake." Madame Staubach,\r\nlittle as she knew of the world of Nuremberg, was well aware who was\r\nthe burgomaster. "That is all very well, my friend; but if it be\r\nso that Linda will not renounce her lover,--who, by the by, is at\r\nthis moment locked up in prison, so that he cannot do any harm just\r\nnow,--why then, in that case, Madame Staubach, I must renounce her."\r\nHaving uttered these terrible words, Peter Steinmarc smoked away\r\nagain with all his fury.\r\n\r\nA fortnight ago, had Peter Steinmarc ventured to speak to her in this\r\nstrain, Madame Staubach would have answered him with some feminine\r\npride, and would have told him that her niece was not a suppliant for\r\nhis hand. This she did not dare to do now. She was all at fault as\r\nto facts, and did not know what the personages of Nuremberg might\r\nbe saying in respect to Linda. Were she to quarrel altogether with\r\nSteinmarc, she thought that there would be left to her no means\r\nof bringing upon Linda that salutary crushing which alone might\r\nbe efficacious for her salvation. She was therefore compelled to\r\ntemporise. Let Peter be silent for a week, and at the end of that\r\nweek let him speak again. If things could not then be arranged to his\r\nsatisfaction, Linda should be regarded as altogether a castaway.\r\n\r\n"Very well, Madame Staubach. Then I will ask her for the last time\r\nthis day week." In coarsest sackcloth, and with bitterest ashes, did\r\nMadame Staubach on that night do spiritual penance for her own sins\r\nand for those of Linda Tressel.\r\n\r\nThis week had nearly passed to the duration of which Peter Steinmarc\r\nhad assented, and at the end of which it was to be settled whether\r\nLinda would renounce Ludovic Valcarm, or Peter himself would renounce\r\nLinda. With a manly propriety he omitted any spoken allusion to the\r\nsubject during those smoking visits which he still paid on alternate\r\ndays to the parlour of Madame Staubach. But, though he said nothing,\r\nhis looks and features and the motions of his limbs were eloquent\r\nof his importance and his dignity during this period of waiting.\r\nHe would salute Madame Staubach when he entered the chamber with a\r\nmajesty of demeanour which he had not before affected, and would say\r\na few words on subjects of public interest--such as the weather, the\r\nprice of butter, and the adulteration of the city beer--in false\r\nnotes, in tones which did not belong to him, and which in truth\r\ndisgusted Madame Staubach, who was sincere in all things. But Madame\r\nStaubach, though she was disgusted, did not change her mind or\r\nabandon her purpose. Linda was to be made to marry Peter Steinmarc,\r\nnot because he was a pleasant man, but because such a discipline\r\nwould be for the good of her soul. Madame Staubach therefore\r\nlistened, and said little or nothing; and when Peter on a certain\r\nThursday evening remarked as he was leaving the parlour that the week\r\nwould be over on the following morning, and that he would do himself\r\nthe honour of asking for the fraulein\'s decision on his return from\r\nthe town-hall at five P.M. on the morrow, apologising at the same\r\ntime for the fact that he would then be driven to intrude on an\r\nirregular day, Madame Staubach merely answered by an assenting motion\r\nof her head, and by the utterance of her usual benison, "God in\r\nHis mercy be with you, Peter Steinmarc." "And with you too, Madame\r\nStaubach." Then Peter marched forth with great dignity, holding his\r\npipe as high as his shoulder.\r\n\r\nLinda Tressel had kept her bed during nearly the whole week, and had\r\nin truth been very ill. Hitherto it had been her aunt\'s scheme of\r\nlife to intermit in some slight degree the acerbity of her usual\r\ndemeanour in periods of illness. At such times she would be very\r\nconstant with the reading of good books by the bedside and with much\r\nghostly advice to the sufferer, but she would not take it amiss if\r\nthe patient succumbed to sleep while she was thus employed, believing\r\nsleep to be pardonable at such times of bodily weakness, and perhaps\r\nsalutary; and she would be softer in her general manner, and would\r\nsometimes descend to the saying of tender little words, and would\r\nadminister things agreeable to the palate which might at the same\r\ntime be profitable to the health. So thus there had been moments in\r\nwhich Linda had felt that it would be comfortable to be always ill.\r\nBut now, during the whole of this week, Madame Staubach had been very\r\ndoubtful as to her conduct. At first it had seemed to her that all\r\ntenderness must be misplaced in circumstances so terrible, till there\r\nhad been an actual resolution of repentance, till the spirit had been\r\nmade to pass seven times through the fire, till the heart had lost\r\nall its human cords and fibres. But gradually, and that before the\r\nsecond day had elapsed, there came upon her a conviction that she had\r\nin some way mistaken the meaning of Linda\'s words, and that matters\r\nwere not as she had supposed. She did not now in the least doubt\r\nLinda\'s truth. She was convinced that Linda had intentionally told\r\nno falsehood, and that she would tell none. But there were questions\r\nwhich she would not ask, which she could not ask at any rate except\r\nby slow degrees. Something, however, she learned from Tetchen,\r\nsomething from Linda herself, and thus there came upon her a\r\nconviction that there might be no frightful story to tell to\r\nPeter,--that in all probability there was no such story to be told.\r\nWhat she believed at this time was in fact about the truth.\r\n\r\nBut if it were as she believed, then was it the more incumbent on\r\nher to see that this marriage did not slip through her fingers. She\r\nbecame very busy, and in her eagerness she went to Herr Molk. Herr\r\nMolk had learned something further about Ludovic, and promised that\r\nhe would himself come down and see "the child." He would see "the\r\nchild," ill as she was, in bed, and perhaps say a word or two that\r\nmight assist. Madame Staubach found that the burgomaster was quite\r\nprepared to advocate the Steinmarc marriage, being instigated thereto\r\napparently by his civic horror at Valcarm\'s crimes. He would shake\r\nhis head, and swing his whole body, and blow out the breath from\r\nbehind his cheeks, knitting his eyebrows and assuming a look of\r\nterror when it was suggested to him that the daughter of his old\r\nfriend, the undoubted owner of a house in Nuremberg, was anxious to\r\ngive herself and her property to Ludovic Valcarm. "No, no, Madame\r\nStaubach, that mustn\'t be;--that must not be, my dear Madame. A\r\nrebel! a traitor! I don\'t know what the young man hasn\'t done. It\r\nwould be confiscated;--confiscated! Dear, dear, only to think of\r\nJosef Tressel\'s daughter! Let her marry Peter Steinmarc, a good\r\nman,--a very good man! Followed her father, you know, and does his\r\nwork very well. The city is not what it used to be, Madame Staubach,\r\nbut still Peter does his work very well." Then Herr Molk promised to\r\ncome down to the red house, and he did come down.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Staubach could not trust everything to Herr Molk. It was\r\nnecessary that she should do much before he came, and much probably\r\nafter he went. As her conception of the true state of things became\r\nstrong, and as she was convinced also that Linda was really far\r\nfrom well, her manner became kinder, and she assumed that sickbed\r\ntenderness which admitted of sleep during the reading of a sermon.\r\nBut it was essential that she should not forget her work for an hour.\r\nGradually Linda was taught to understand that on such a day Steinmarc\r\nwas to demand an answer. When Linda attempted to explain that the\r\nanswer had been already given, and could not be altered, her aunt\r\ninterrupted her, declaring that nothing need be said at the present\r\nmoment. So that the question remained an open question, and Linda\r\nunderstood that it was so regarded. Then Madame Staubach spoke of\r\nLudovic Valcarm, putting up her hands with dismay, and declaring what\r\nhorrid things Herr Molk had told of him. It was at that moment that\r\nLinda was told that she was to be visited in a day or two by the\r\nburgomaster. Linda endeavoured to explain that though it might be\r\nnecessary to give up Ludovic,--not saying that she would give him\r\nup,--still it was not on that account necessary also that she should\r\nmarry Peter Steinmarc. Madame Staubach shook her head, and implied\r\nthat the necessity did exist. Things had been said, and things had\r\nbeen done, and Herr Molk was decidedly of opinion that the marriage\r\nshould be solemnised without delay. Linda, of course, did not submit\r\nto this in silence; but gradually she became more and more silent as\r\nher aunt continued in a low tone to drone forth her wishes and her\r\nconvictions, and at last Linda would almost sleep while the salutary\r\nposition of Peter Steinmarc\'s wife was being explained to her.\r\n\r\nThe reader must understand that she was in truth ill, prostrated\r\nby misery, doubt, and agitation, and weak from the effects of her\r\nillness. In this condition Herr Molk paid his visit to her. He spoke,\r\nin the first place, of the civil honour which she had inherited from\r\nher respected father, and of all that she owed to Nuremberg on this\r\naccount. Then he spoke also of that other inheritance, the red house,\r\nexplaining to her that it was her duty as a citizen to see that this\r\nshould not be placed by her in evil hands. After that he took up\r\nthe subject of Peter Steinmarc\'s merits; and according to Herr Molk,\r\nas he now drew the picture, Peter was little short of a municipal\r\ndemigod. Prudent he was, and confidential. A man deep in the city\'s\r\ntrust, and with money laid out at interest. Strong and healthy he\r\nwas,--indeed lusty for his age, if Herr Molk spoke the truth. Poor\r\nLinda gave a little kick beneath the clothes when this was said,\r\nbut she spoke no word of reply. And then Peter was a man not given\r\nto scolding, of equal temper, who knew his place, and would not\r\ninterfere with things that did not belong to him. Herr Molk produced\r\na catalogue of nuptial virtues, and endowed Peter with them all. When\r\nthis was completed, he came to the last head of his discourse,--the\r\nlast head and the most important. Ludovic Valcarm was still in\r\nprison, and there was no knowing what might be done to him. To be\r\nimprisoned for life in some horrible place among the rats seemed\r\nto be the least of it. Linda, when she heard this, gave one slight\r\nscream, but she said nothing. Because Herr Molk was a burgomaster,\r\nshe need not on that account believe every word that fell from his\r\nmouth. But the cruellest blow of all was at the end. When Ludovic was\r\ntaken, there had been--a young woman with him.\r\n\r\n"What young woman?" said Linda, turning sharply upon the burgomaster.\r\n\r\n"Not such a young woman as any young man ought to be seen with," said\r\nHerr Molk.\r\n\r\n"What matters her name?" said Madame Staubach, who, during the whole\r\ndiscourse, had been sitting silent by the bedside.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe a word of it," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"I saw the young woman in his company, my dear. She had a felt hat\r\nand a blue frock. But, my child, you know nothing of the lives of\r\nsuch young men as this. It would not astonish me if he knew a dozen\r\nyoung women! You don\'t suppose that such a one as he ever means to be\r\ntrue?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure he meant to be true to me," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"T-sh, t-sh, t-sh! my dear child; you don\'t know the world, and how\r\nshould you? If you want to marry a husband who will remain at home\r\nand live discreetly, and be true to you, you must take such a man as\r\nPeter Steinmarc."\r\n\r\n"Of course she must," said Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"Such a one as Ludovic Valcarm would only waste your property and\r\ndrag you into the gutters."\r\n\r\n"No more--no more," said Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"She will think better of it, Madame Staubach. She will not be so\r\nfoolish nor so wicked as that," said the burgomaster.\r\n\r\n"May the Lord in His mercy give her light to see the right way," said\r\nMadame Staubach.\r\n\r\nThen Herr Molk took his departure with Madame Staubach at his heels,\r\nand Linda was left to her own considerations. Her first assertion to\r\nherself was that she did not believe a word of it. She knew what sort\r\nof a man she could love as her husband without having Herr Molk to\r\ncome and teach her. She could not love Peter Steinmarc, let him be\r\never so much respected in Nuremberg. As to what Herr Molk said that\r\nshe owed to the city, that was nothing to her. The city did not care\r\nfor her, nor she for the city. If they wished to take the house from\r\nher, let them do it. She was quite sure that Ludovic Valcarm had not\r\nloved her because she was the owner of a paltry old house. As to\r\nLudovic being in prison, the deeper was his dungeon, the more true\r\nit behoved her to be to him. If he were among the rats, she would\r\nwillingly be there also. But when she tried to settle in her thoughts\r\nthe matter of the young woman with the felt hat and the blue frock,\r\nthen her mind became more doubtful.\r\n\r\nShe knew well enough that Herr Molk was wrong in the picture which\r\nhe drew of Peter; but she was not so sure that he was wrong in that\r\nother picture about Ludovic. There was something very grand, that had\r\ngratified her spirit amazingly, in the manner in which her lover had\r\ndisappeared among the rafters; but at the same time she acknowledged\r\nto herself that there was much in it that was dangerous. A young man\r\nwho can disappear among the rafters so quickly must have had much\r\nexperience. She knew that Ludovic was wild,--very wild, and that wild\r\nyoung men do not make good husbands. To have had his arm once round\r\nher waist was to her almost a joy for ever. But she had nearly come\r\nto believe that if she were to have his arm often round her waist,\r\nshe must become a castaway. And then, to be a castaway, sharing her\r\ntreasure with another! Who was this blue-frocked woman, with a felt\r\nhat, who seemed to have been willing to do so much more for Ludovic\r\nthan she had done,--who had gone with him into danger, and was\r\nsharing with him his perils?\r\n\r\nBut though she made a great fight against the wisdom of Herr Molk\r\nwhen she was first left to herself, the words of the burgomaster had\r\ntheir effect. Her enemies were becoming too strong for her. Her heart\r\nwas weak within her. She had eaten little or nothing for the last few\r\ndays, and the blood was running thinly through her veins. It was more\r\ndifficult to reply to tenderness from her aunt than to harshness. And\r\nthere came upon her a feeling that after all it signified but little.\r\nThere was but a choice between one misery and another. The only\r\nreally good thing would be to die and to have done with it all,--to\r\ndie before she had utterly thrown away all hope, all chance of\r\nhappiness in that future world in which she thoroughly believed. She\r\nwas ill now, and if it might be that her illness would bring her to\r\ndeath;--but would bring her slowly, so that she might yet repent, and\r\nall would be right.\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach said nothing more to her about Peter till the morning\r\nof that day on which Peter was to come for his answer. A little\r\nbefore noon Madame Staubach brought to her niece some weak broth, as\r\nshe had done once before, on that morning. But Linda, who was sick\r\nand faint at heart, would not take it.\r\n\r\n"Try, my dear," said Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"I cannot try," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"I wish particularly to speak to you,--now,--at once; and this will\r\ngive you strength to listen to me." But Linda declined to be made\r\nstrong for such a purpose, and declared that she could listen very\r\nwell as she was. Then Madame Staubach began her great argument. Linda\r\nhad heard what the burgomaster had said. Linda knew well what she,\r\nher aunt and guardian, thought about it. Linda could not but know\r\nthat visits from a young man at her chamber door, such as that to\r\nwhich she herself had confessed, were things so horrible that they\r\nhardly admitted of being spoken of even between an aunt and her\r\nniece; and Madame Staubach\'s cheeks were hot and red as she spoke of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n"If he had come to your door, aunt Charlotte, you could not have\r\nhelped it."\r\n\r\n"But he embraced you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he did."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my child, will you not let me save you from the evil days?\r\nLinda, you are all in all to me;--the only one that I love. Linda,\r\nLinda, your soul is precious to me, almost as my own. Oh, Linda,\r\nshall I pray for you in vain?" She sank upon her knees as she spoke,\r\nand prayed with all her might that God would turn the heart of this\r\nchild, so that even yet she might be rescued from the burning. With\r\narms extended, and loud voice, and dishevelled hair, and streaming\r\ntears, shrieking to Heaven in her agony, every now and again kissing\r\nthe hand of the poor sinner, she besought the Lord her God that He\r\nwould give to her the thing for which she asked;--and that thing\r\nprayed for with such agony of earnestness, was a consent from Linda\r\nto marry Peter Steinmarc! It was very strange, but the woman was as\r\nsincere in her prayer as is faith itself. She would have cut herself\r\nwith knives, and have swallowed ashes whole, could she have believed\r\nthat by doing so she could have been nearer her object. And she had\r\nno end of her own in view. That Peter, as master of the house, would\r\nbe a thorn in her own side, she had learned to believe; but thorns\r\nin the sides of women were, she thought, good for them; and it was\r\nnecessary to Linda that she should be stuck full of thorns, so that\r\nher base human desires might, as it were, fall from her bones and\r\nperish out of the way. Once, twice, thrice, Linda besought her aunt\r\nto arise; but the half frantic woman had said to herself that she\r\nwould remain on her knees, on the hard boards, till this thing was\r\ngranted to her. Had it not been said by lips that could not lie, that\r\nfaith would move a mountain? and would not faith, real faith, do\r\nfor her this smaller thing? Then there came questions to her mind,\r\nwhether the faith was there. Did she really believe that this thing\r\nwould be done for her? If she believed it, then it would be done.\r\nThinking of all this, with the girl\'s hands between her own, she\r\nrenewed her prayers. Once and again she threw herself upon the floor,\r\nstriking it with her forehead. "Oh, my child! my child, my child! If\r\nGod would do this for me! my child, my child! Only for my sin and\r\nweakness this thing would be done for me."\r\n\r\nFor three hours Linda lay there, hearing this, mingling her screams\r\nwith those of her aunt, half fainting, half dead, now and again\r\ndozing for a moment even amidst the screams, and then struggling up\r\nin bed, that she might embrace her aunt, and implore her to abandon\r\nher purpose. But the woman would only give herself with the greater\r\nvehemence to the work. "Now, if the Lord would see fit, now,--now; if\r\nthe Lord would see fit!"\r\n\r\nLinda had swooned, her aunt being all unconscious of it, had dozed\r\nafterwards, and had then risen and struggled up, and was seated in\r\nher bed. "Aunt Charlotte," she said, "what is it--that--you want of\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"That you should obey the Lord, and take this man for your husband."\r\n\r\nLinda stayed a while to think, not pausing that she might answer\r\nher aunt\'s sophistry, which she hardly noticed, but that she might\r\nconsider, if it were possible, what it was that she was about\r\nto do;--that there might be left a moment to her before she had\r\nsurrendered herself for ever to her doom. And then she spoke. "Aunt\r\nCharlotte," she said, "if you will get up I will do as you would have\r\nme."\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach could not arise at once, as it was incumbent on\r\nher to return thanks for the mercy that had been vouchsafed to her;\r\nbut her thanks were quickly rendered, and then she was on the bed,\r\nwith Linda in her arms. She had succeeded, and her child was saved.\r\nPerhaps there was something of triumph that the earnestness of her\r\nprayer should have been efficacious. It was a great thing that she\r\nhad done, and the Scriptures had proved themselves to be true to her.\r\nShe lay for a while fondling her niece and kissing her, as she had\r\nnot done for years. "Linda, dear Linda!" She almost promised to the\r\ngirl earthly happiness, in spite of her creed as to the necessity\r\nfor crushing. For the moment she petted her niece as one weak woman\r\nmay pet another. She went down to the kitchen and made coffee for\r\nher,--though she herself was weak from want of food,--and toasted\r\nbread, and brought the food up with a china cup and a china plate, to\r\nshow her gratitude to the niece who had been her convert. And yet, as\r\nshe did so, she told herself that such gratitude was mean, vile, and\r\nmistaken. It had been the Lord\'s doing, and not Linda\'s.\r\n\r\nLinda took the coffee and the toast, and tried to make herself\r\npassive in her aunt\'s hands. She returned Madame Staubach\'s kisses\r\nand the pressure of her hand, and made some semblance of joy, that\r\npeace should have been re-established between them two. But her heart\r\nwas dead within her, and the reflection that this illness might even\r\nyet be an illness unto death was the only one in which she could find\r\nthe slightest comfort. She had promised Ludovic that she would never\r\nbecome the wife of any one but him; and now, at the first trial\r\nof her faith, she had promised to marry Peter Steinmarc. She was\r\nforsworn, and it would hardly be that the Lord would be satisfied\r\nwith her, because she had perjured herself! When her aunt left her,\r\nwhich Madame Staubach did as the dusk came on, she endeavoured to\r\npromise herself that she would never get well. Was not the very\r\nthought that she would have to take Peter for her husband enough to\r\nkeep her on her sickbed till she should be beyond all such perils as\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach, before she left the room, asked Linda whether she\r\nwould not be able to dress herself and come down, so that she might\r\nsay one word to her affianced husband. It should be but one word, and\r\nthen she should be allowed to return. Linda would have declined to do\r\nthis,--was refusing utterly to do it,--when she found that if she did\r\nnot go down Peter would be brought up to her bedroom, to receive her\r\ntroth there, by her bedside. The former evil, she thought, would be\r\nless than the latter. Steinmarc as a lover at her bedside would be\r\nintolerable to her; and then if she descended, she might ascend again\r\ninstantly. That was part of the bargain. But if Peter were to come up\r\nto her room, there was no knowing how long he might stay there. She\r\npromised therefore that she would dress and come down as soon as she\r\nknew that the man was in the parlour. We may say for her, that when\r\nleft alone she was as firmly resolved as ever that she would never\r\nbecome the man\'s wife. If this illness did not kill her, she would\r\nescape from the wedding in some other way. She would never put her\r\nhand into that of Peter Steinmarc, and let the priest call him and\r\nher man and wife. She had lied to her aunt--so she told herself,--but\r\nher aunt had forced the lie from her.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter entered Madame Staubach\'s parlour he was again dressed in\r\nhis Sunday best, as he had been when he made his first overture to\r\nLinda. "Good evening, Madame Staubach," he said.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Peter Steinmarc."\r\n\r\n"I hope you have good news for me, Madame Staubach, from the maiden\r\nup-stairs."\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach took a moment or two for thought before she replied.\r\n"Peter Steinmarc, the Lord has been good to us, and has softened her\r\nheart, and has brought the child round to our way of thinking. She\r\nhas consented, Peter, that you should be her husband."\r\n\r\nPeter was not so grateful perhaps as he should have been at this good\r\nnews,--or rather perhaps at the manner in which the result seemed\r\nto have been achieved. Of course he knew nothing of those terribly\r\nearnest petitions which Madame Staubach had preferred to the throne\r\nof heaven on behalf of his marriage, but he did not like being told\r\nat all of any interposition from above in such a matter. He would\r\nhave preferred to be assured, even though he himself might not quite\r\nhave believed the assurance, that Linda had yielded to a sense of\r\nhis own merits. "I am glad she has thought better of it, Madame\r\nStaubach," he said; "she is only just in time."\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach was very nearly angry, but she reminded herself that\r\npeople cannot be crushed by rose-leaves. Peter Steinmarc was to be\r\ntaken, because he was Peter Steinmarc, not because he was somebody\r\nvery different, better mannered, and more agreeable.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how that may be, Peter."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but it is so;--only just in time, I can assure you. But \'a miss\r\nis as good as a mile;\' so we will let that pass."\r\n\r\n"She is now ready to come down and accept your troth, and give you\r\nhers. You will remember that she is ill and weak; and, indeed, I am\r\nunwell myself. She can stay but a moment, and then, I am sure, you\r\nwill leave us for to-night. The day has not been without its trouble\r\nand its toil to both of us."\r\n\r\n"Surely," said Peter; "a word or two shall satisfy me to-night. But,\r\nMadame Staubach, I shall look to you to see that the period before\r\nour wedding is not protracted,--you will remember that." To this\r\nMadame Staubach made no answer, but slowly mounted to Linda\'s\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nLinda was already nearly dressed. She was not minded to keep her\r\nsuitor waiting. Tetchen was with her, aiding her; but to Tetchen she\r\nhad refused to say a single word respecting either Peter or Ludovic.\r\nSomething Tetchen had heard from Madame Staubach, but from Linda\r\nshe heard nothing. Linda intended to go down to the parlour, and\r\ntherefore she must dress herself. As she was weak almost to fainting,\r\nshe had allowed Tetchen to help her. Her aunt led her down, and there\r\nwas nothing said between them as they went. At the door her aunt\r\nkissed her, and muttered some word of love. Then they entered the\r\nroom together.\r\n\r\nPeter was found standing in the middle of the chamber, with his\r\nleft hand beneath his waistcoat, and his right hand free for the\r\nperformance of some graceful salutation. "Linda," said he, as soon as\r\nhe saw the two ladies standing a few feet away from him, "I am glad\r\nto see you down-stairs again,--very glad. I hope you find yourself\r\nbetter." Linda muttered, or tried to mutter, some words of thanks;\r\nbut nothing was audible. She stood hanging upon her aunt, with eyes\r\nturned down, and her limbs trembling beneath her. "Linda," continued\r\nPeter, "your aunt tells me that you have accepted my offer. I am very\r\nglad of it. I will be a good husband to you, and I hope you will be\r\nan obedient wife."\r\n\r\n"Linda," said Madame Staubach, "put your hand in his." Linda put\r\nforth her little hand a few inches, and Peter took it within his own,\r\nlooking the while into Madame Staubach\'s face, as though he were to\r\nrepeat some form of words after her. "You are now betrothed in the\r\nsight of God, as man and wife," said Madame Staubach; "and may the\r\nmarried life of both of you be passed to His glory.--Amen."\r\n\r\n"Amen," said Steinmarc, like the parish clerk. Linda pressed her lips\r\nclose together, so that there should be no possibility of a chance\r\nsound passing from them.\r\n\r\n"Now, I think we will go back again, Peter, as the poor child\r\ncan hardly stand." Peter raised no objection, and then Linda was\r\nconducted back again to her bed. There was one comfort to her in the\r\nremembrance of the scene. She had escaped the dreaded contamination\r\nof a kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Steinmarc, now that he was an engaged man, affianced to a young\r\nbride, was urgent from day to day with Madame Staubach that the date\r\nof his wedding should be fixed. He soon found that all Nuremberg knew\r\nthat he was to be married. Perhaps Herr Molk had not been so silent\r\nand discreet as would have been becoming in a man so highly placed,\r\nand perhaps Peter himself had let slip a word to some confidential\r\nfriend who had betrayed him. Be this as it might, all Nuremberg knew\r\nof Peter\'s good fortune, and he soon found that he should have no\r\npeace till the thing was completed. "She is quite well enough, I\r\nam sure," said Peter to Madame Staubach, "and if there is anything\r\namiss she can finish getting well afterwards." Madame Staubach was\r\nsufficiently eager herself that Linda should be married without\r\ndelay; but, nevertheless, she was angry at being so pressed, and\r\nused rather sharp language in explaining to Peter that he would not\r\nbe allowed to dictate on such a subject. "Ah! well; if it isn\'t this\r\nyear it won\'t be next," said Peter, on one occasion when he had\r\ndetermined to show his power. Madame Staubach did not believe the\r\nthreat, but she did begin to fear that, perhaps, after all, there\r\nmight be fresh obstacles. It was now near the end of November, and\r\nthough Linda still kept her room, her aunt could not see that she\r\nwas suffering from any real illness. When, however, a word was said\r\nto press the poor girl, Linda would declare that she was weak and\r\nsick--unable to walk; in short, that at present she would not leave\r\nher room. Madame Staubach was beginning to be angered at this; but,\r\nfor all that, Linda had not left her room.\r\n\r\nIt was now two weeks since she had suffered herself to be betrothed,\r\nand Peter had twice been up to her chamber, creaking with his shoes\r\nalong the passages. Twice she had passed a terrible half-hour, while\r\nhe had sat, for the most part silent, in an old wicker chair by her\r\nbedside. Her aunt had, of course, been present, and had spoken most\r\nof the words that had been uttered during these visits; and these\r\nwords had nearly altogether referred to Linda\'s ailments. Linda was\r\nstill not quite well, she had said, but would soon be better, and\r\nthen all would be properly settled. Such was the purport of the words\r\nwhich Madame Staubach would speak on those occasions.\r\n\r\n"Before Christmas?" Peter had once asked.\r\n\r\n"No," Linda had replied, very sharply.\r\n\r\n"It must be as the Lord shall will it," said Madame Staubach. That\r\nhad been so true that neither Linda nor Peter had found it necessary\r\nto express dissent. On both these occasions Linda\'s energy had been\r\nchiefly used to guard herself from any sign of a caress. Peter had\r\nthought of it, but Linda lay far away upon the bed, and the lover did\r\nnot see how it was to be managed. He was not sure, moreover, whether\r\nMadame Staubach would not have been shocked at any proposal in\r\nreference to an antenuptial embrace. On these considerations he\r\nabstained.\r\n\r\nIt was now near the end of November, and Linda knew that she was\r\nwell. Her aunt had proposed some day in January for the marriage, and\r\nLinda, though she had never assented, could not on the moment find\r\nany plea for refusing altogether to have a day fixed. All she could\r\ndo was to endeavour to stave off the evil. Madame Staubach seemed\r\nto think that it was indispensable that a day in January should be\r\nnamed; therefore, at last, the thirtieth of that month was after some\r\nfashion fixed for the wedding. Linda never actually assented, but\r\nafter many discourses it seemed to be decided that it should be so.\r\nPeter was so told, and with some grumbling expressed himself as\r\nsatisfied; but when would Linda come down to him? He was sure that\r\nLinda was well enough to come down if she would. At last a day was\r\nfixed for that also. It was arranged that the three should go to\r\nchurch together on the first Sunday in December. It would be safer so\r\nthan in any other way. He could not make love to her in church.\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday evening Linda was down-stairs with her aunt. Peter,\r\nas she knew well, was at the Rothe Ross on that evening, and would\r\nnot be home till past ten. Tetchen was out, and Linda had gone down\r\nto take her supper with her aunt. The meal had been eaten almost\r\nin silence, for Linda was very sad, and Madame Staubach herself\r\nwas beginning to feel that the task before her was almost too much\r\nfor her strength. Had it not been that she was carried on by the\r\nconviction that things stern and hard and cruel would in the long-run\r\nbe comforting to the soul, she would have given way. But she was a\r\nwoman not prone to give way when she thought that the soul\'s welfare\r\nwas concerned. She had seen the shrinking, retreating horror with\r\nwhich Linda had almost involuntarily contrived to keep her distance\r\nfrom her future husband. She had listened to the girl\'s voice, and\r\nknew that there had been not one light-hearted tone from it since\r\nthat consent had been wrung from the sufferer by the vehemence of her\r\nown bedside prayers. She was aware that Linda from day to day was\r\nbecoming thinner and thinner, paler and still paler. But she knew, or\r\nthought that she knew, that it was God\'s will; and so she went on. It\r\nwas not a happy time even for Madame Staubach, but it was a time in\r\nwhich to Linda it seemed that hell had come to her beforehand with\r\nall its terrors.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one thing certain to her yet. She would never put\r\nher hand into that of Peter Steinmarc in God\'s house after such a\r\nfashion that any priest should be able to say that they two were man\r\nand wife in the sight of God.\r\n\r\nOn this Saturday evening Tetchen was out, as was the habit with her\r\non alternate Saturday evenings. On such occasions Linda would usually\r\ndo what household work was necessary in the kitchen, preparatory\r\nto the coming Sabbath. But on this evening Madame Staubach herself\r\nwas employed in the kitchen, as Linda was not considered to be well\r\nenough to perform the task. Linda was sitting alone, between the fire\r\nand the window, with no work in her hand, with no book before her,\r\nthinking of her fate, when there came upon the panes of the window\r\nsundry small, sharp, quickly-repeated rappings, as though gravel\r\nhad been thrown upon them. She knew at once that the noise was not\r\naccidental, and jumped up on her feet. If it was some mode of escape,\r\nlet it be what it might, she would accept it. She jumped up, and with\r\nshort hurried steps placed herself close to the window. The quick,\r\nsharp, little blows upon the glass were heard again, and then there\r\nwas a voice. "Linda, Linda." Heavens and earth! it was his voice.\r\nThere was no mistaking it. Had she heard but a single syllable in the\r\nfaintest whisper, she would have known it. It was Ludovic Valcarm,\r\nand he had come for her, even out of his prison. He should find that\r\nhe had not come in vain. Then the word was repeated--"Linda, are you\r\nthere?" "I am here," she said, speaking very faintly, and trembling\r\nat the sound of her own voice. Then the iron pin was withdrawn\r\nfrom the wooden shutter on the outside, as it could not have been\r\nwithdrawn had not some traitor within the house prepared the way for\r\nit, and the heavy Venetian blinds were folded back, and Linda could\r\nsee the outlines of the man\'s head and shoulders, in the dark, close\r\nto the panes of the window. It was raining at the time, and the night\r\nwas very dark, but still she could see the outline. She stood and\r\nwatched him; for, though she was willing to be with him, she felt\r\nthat she could do nothing. In a moment the frame of the window was\r\nraised, and his head was within the room, within her aunt\'s parlour,\r\nwhere her aunt might now have been for all that he could have\r\nknown;--were it not that Tetchen was watching at the corner, and\r\nknew to the scraping of a carrot how long it would be before Madame\r\nStaubach had made the soup for to-morrow\'s dinner.\r\n\r\n"Linda," he said, "how is it with you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ludovic!"\r\n\r\n"Linda, will you go with me now?"\r\n\r\n"What! now, this instant?"\r\n\r\n"To-night. Listen, dearest, for she will be back. Go to her in ten\r\nminutes from now, and tell her that you are weary and would be in\r\nbed. She will see you to your room perhaps, and there may be delay.\r\nBut when you can, come down silently, with your thickest cloak\r\nand your strongest hat, and any little thing you can carry easily.\r\nCome without a candle, and creep to the passage window. I will be\r\nthere. If she will let you go up-stairs alone, you may be there in\r\nhalf-an-hour. It is our only chance." Then the window was closed, and\r\nafter that the shutter, and then the pin was pushed back, and Linda\r\nwas again alone in her aunt\'s chamber.\r\n\r\nTo be there in half-an-hour! To commence such a job as this at once!\r\nTo go to her aunt with a premeditated lie that would require perfect\r\nacting, and to have to do this in ten minutes, in five minutes,\r\nwhile the minutes were flying from her like sparks of fire! It was\r\nimpossible. If it had been enjoined upon her for the morrow, so that\r\nthere should have been time for thought, she might have done it. But\r\nthis call upon her for instant action almost paralysed her. And yet\r\nwhat other hope was there? She had told herself that she would do\r\nanything, however wicked, however dreadful, that would save her from\r\nthe proposed marriage. She had sworn to herself that she would do\r\nsomething; for that Steinmarc\'s wife she would never be. And here had\r\ncome to her a possibility of escape,--of escape too which had in it\r\nso much of sweetness! She must lie to her aunt. Was not every hour of\r\nlife a separate lie? And as for acting a lie, what was the difference\r\nbetween that and telling it, except in the capability of the liar.\r\nHer aunt had forced her to lie. No truth was any longer possible to\r\nher. Would it not be better to lie for Ludovic Valcarm than to lie\r\nfor Peter Steinmarc? She looked at the upright clock which stood in\r\nthe corner of the room, and, seeing that the ten minutes was already\r\npassed, she crossed at once over into the kitchen. Her aunt was\r\nstanding there, and Tetchen with her bonnet on, was standing by.\r\nTetchen, as soon as she saw Linda, explained that she must be off\r\nagain at once. She had only returned to fetch some article for a\r\nlittle niece of hers which Madame Staubach had given her.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Charlotte," said Linda, "I am very weary. You will not be\r\nangry, will you, if I go to bed?"\r\n\r\n"It is not yet nine o\'clock, my dear."\r\n\r\n"But I am tired, and I fear that I shall lack strength for\r\nto-morrow." Oh, Linda, Linda! But, indeed, had you foreseen the\r\nfuture, you might have truly said that you would want strength on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\n"Then go, my dear;" and Madame Staubach kissed her niece and blessed\r\nher, and after that, with careful hand, threw some salt into the pot\r\nthat was simmering on the stove. Peter Steinmarc was to dine with\r\nthem on the morrow, and he was a man who cared that his soup should\r\nbe well seasoned. Linda, terribly smitten by the consciousness of her\r\nown duplicity, went forth, and crept up-stairs to her room. She had\r\nnow, as she calculated, a quarter of an hour, and she would wish,\r\nif possible, to be punctual. She looked out for a moment from the\r\nwindow, and could only see that it was very dark, and could hear that\r\nit was raining hard. She took her thickest cloak and her strongest\r\nhat. She would do in all things as he bade her; and then she tried\r\nto think what else she would take. She was going forth,--whither she\r\nknew not. Then came upon her a thought that on the morrow,--for many\r\nmorrows afterwards, perhaps for all morrows to come,--there would be\r\nno comfortable wardrobe to which she could go for such decent changes\r\nof raiment as she required. She looked at her frock, and having one\r\ndarker and thicker than that she wore, she changed it instantly. And\r\nthen it was not only her garments that she was leaving behind her.\r\nFor ever afterwards,--for ever and ever and ever,--she must be a\r\ncastaway. The die had been thrown now, and everything was over. She\r\nwas leaving behind her all decency, all feminine respect, all the\r\nclean ways of her pure young life, all modest thoughts, all honest,\r\nserviceable daily tasks, all godliness, all hope of heaven! The\r\nsilent, quick-running tears streamed down her face as she moved\r\nrapidly about the room. The thing must be done, must be done,--must\r\nbe done, even though earth and heaven were to fail her for ever\r\nafterwards. Earth and heaven would fail her for ever afterwards, but\r\nstill the thing must be done. All should be endured, if by that all\r\nshe could escape from the man she loathed.\r\n\r\nShe collected a few things, what little store of money she had,--four\r\nor five gulden, perhaps,--and a pair of light shoes and clean\r\nstockings, and a fresh handkerchief or two, and a little collar,\r\nand then she started. He had told her to bring what she could carry\r\neasily. She must not disobey him, but she would fain have brought\r\nmore had she dared. At the last moment she returned, and took a small\r\nhair-brush and a comb. Then she looked round the room with a hurried\r\nglance, put out her candle, and crept silently down the stairs. On\r\nthe first landing she paused, for it was possible that Peter might\r\nbe returning. She listened, and then remembered that she would have\r\nheard Peter\'s feet even on the walk outside. Very quickly, but still\r\nmore gently than ever, she went down the last stairs. From the foot\r\nof the stairs into the passage there was a moment in which she must\r\nbe within sight of the kitchen door. She flew by, and felt that she\r\nmust have been seen. But she was not seen. In an instant she was at\r\nthe open window, and in another instant she was standing beside her\r\nlover on the gravel path. What he said to her she did not hear; what\r\nhe did she did not know. She had completed her task now; she had done\r\nher part, and had committed herself entirely into his hands. She\r\nwould ask no question. She would trust him entirely. She only knew\r\nthat at the moment his arm was round her, and that she was being\r\nlifted off the bank into the river.\r\n\r\n"Dearest girl! can you see? No; nothing, of course, as yet. Step\r\ndown. There is a boat here. There are two boats. Lean upon me, and we\r\ncan walk over. There. Do not mind treading softly. They cannot hear\r\nbecause of the rain. We shall be out of it in a minute. I am sorry\r\nyou should be wet, but yet it is better for us."\r\n\r\nShe hardly understood him, but yet she did as he told her, and in a\r\nfew minutes she was standing on the other bank of the river, in the\r\nRuden Platz. Here Linda perceived that there was a man awaiting them,\r\nto whom Ludovic gave certain orders about the boats. Then Ludovic\r\ntook her by the hand and ran with her across the Platz, till they\r\nstood beneath the archway of the brewery warehouse where she had so\r\noften watched him as he went in and out. "Here we are safe," he said,\r\nstooping down and kissing her, and brushing away the drops of rain\r\nfrom the edges of her hair. Oh, what safety! To be there, in the\r\nmiddle of the night, with him, and not know whither she was to go,\r\nwhere she was to lie, whether she would ever again know that feeling\r\nof security which had been given to her throughout her whole life by\r\nher aunt\'s presence and the walls of her own house. Safe! Was ever\r\nperil equal to hers? "Linda, say that you love me. Say that you are\r\nmy own."\r\n\r\n"I do love you," she said; "otherwise how should I be here?"\r\n\r\n"And you had promised to marry that man!"\r\n\r\n"I should never have married him. I should have died."\r\n\r\n"Dearest Linda! But come; you must not stand here." Then he took her\r\nup, up the warehouse stairs into a gloomy chamber, from which there\r\nwas a window looking on to the Ruden Platz, and there, with many\r\ncaresses, he explained to her his plans. The caresses she endeavoured\r\nto avoid, and, when she could not avoid them, to moderate. "Would he\r\nremember," she asked, "just for the present, all that she had gone\r\nthrough, and spare her for a while, because she was so weak?" She\r\nmade her little appeal with swimming eyes and low voice, looking into\r\nhis face, holding his great hand the while between her own. He swore\r\nthat she was his queen, and should have her way in everything. But\r\nwould she not give him one kiss? He reminded her that she had never\r\nkissed him. She did as he asked her, just touching his lips with\r\nhers, and then she stood by him, leaning on him, while he explained\r\nto her something of his plans. He kept close to the window, as it was\r\nnecessary that he should keep his eyes upon the red house.\r\n\r\nHis plan was this. There was a train which passed by the Nuremberg\r\nstation on its way to Augsburg at three o\'clock in the morning. By\r\nthis train he proposed that they should travel to that city. He had,\r\nhe said, the means of providing accommodation for her there, and no\r\none would know whither they had gone. He did not anticipate that any\r\none in the house opposite would learn that Linda had escaped till the\r\nnext morning; but should any suspicion have been aroused, and should\r\nthe fact be ascertained, there would certainly be lights moving in\r\nthe house, and light would be seen from the window of Linda\'s own\r\nchamber. Therefore he proposed, during the long hours that they must\r\nyet wait, to stand in his present spot and watch, so that he might\r\nknow at the first moment whether there was any commotion among the\r\ninmates of the red house. "There goes old Peter to bed," said he; "he\r\nwon\'t be the first to find out, I\'ll bet a florin." And afterwards he\r\nsignified the fact that Madame Staubach had gone to her chamber. This\r\nwas the moment of danger, as it might be very possible that Madame\r\nStaubach would go into Linda\'s room. In that case, as he said, he\r\nhad a little carriage outside the walls which would take them to the\r\nfirst town on the route to Augsburg. Had a light been seen but for a\r\nmoment in Linda\'s room they were to start; and would certainly reach\r\nthe spot where the carriage stood before any followers could be\r\non their heels. But Madame Staubach went to her own room without\r\nnoticing that of her niece, and then the red house was all dark and\r\nall still. They would have made the best of their way to Augsburg\r\nbefore their flight would be discovered.\r\n\r\nDuring the minutes in which they were watching the lights Linda stood\r\nclose to her lover, leaning on his shoulder, and supported by his\r\narm. But this was over by ten, and then there remained nearly five\r\nhours, during which they must stay in their present hiding-place. Up\r\nto this time Linda\'s strength had supported her under the excitement\r\nof her escape, but now she was like to faint, and it was necessary at\r\nany rate that she should be allowed to lie down. He got sacks for her\r\nfrom some part of the building, and with these constructed for her\r\na bed on the floor, near to the spot which he must occupy himself\r\nin still keeping his eye upon the red house. He laid her down and\r\ncovered her feet with sacking, and put sacks under her head for\r\na pillow. He was very gentle with her, and she thanked him over\r\nand over again, and endeavoured to think that her escape had been\r\nfortunate, and that her position was happy. Had she not succeeded in\r\nflying from Peter Steinmarc? And after such a flight would not all\r\nidea of a marriage with him be out of the question? For some little\r\ntime she was cheered by talking to him. She asked him about his\r\nimprisonment. "Ah!" said he; "if I cannot be one too many for such an\r\nold fogey as Herr Molk, I\'ll let out my brains to an ass, and take to\r\ngrazing on thistles." His offence had been political, and had been\r\ncommitted in conjunction with others. And he and they were sure of\r\nsuccess ultimately,--were sure of success very speedily. Linda could\r\nunderstand nothing of the subject. But she could hope that her lover\r\nmight prosper in his undertaking, and she could admire and love him\r\nfor encountering the dangers of such an enterprise. And then, half\r\nsportively, half in earnest, she taxed him with that matter which was\r\nnext her heart. Who had been the young woman with the blue frock and\r\nthe felt hat who had been with him when he was brought before the\r\nmagistrates?\r\n\r\n"Young woman;--with blue frock! who told you of the young woman,\r\nLinda?" He came and knelt beside her as he asked the question,\r\nleaving his watch for the moment; and she could see by the dim light\r\nof the lamp outside that there was a smile upon his face,--almost\r\njoyous, full of mirth.\r\n\r\n"Who told me? The magistrate you were taken to; Herr Molk told me\r\nhimself," said Linda, almost happily. That smile upon his face had in\r\nsome way vanquished her feeling of jealousy.\r\n\r\n"Then he is a greater scoundrel than I took him to be, or else a more\r\nutter fool. The girl in the blue frock, Linda, was one of our young\r\nmen, who was to get out of the city in that disguise. And I believe\r\nHerr Molk knew it when he tried to set you against me, by telling you\r\nthe story."\r\n\r\nWhether Herr Molk had known this, or whether he had simply been fool\r\nenough to be taken in by the blue frock and the felt hat, it is not\r\nfor us to inquire here. But Ludovic was greatly amused at the story,\r\nand Linda was charmed at the explanation she had received. It was\r\nonly an extra feather in her lover\'s cap that he should have been\r\nconnected with a blue frock and felt hat under such circumstances as\r\nthose now explained to her. Then he went back to the window, and she\r\nturned on her side and attempted to sleep.\r\n\r\nTo be in all respects a castaway,--a woman to whom other women\r\nwould not speak! She knew that such was her position now. She had\r\ndone a deed which would separate her for ever from those who were\r\nrespectable, and decent, and good. Peter Steinmarc would utterly\r\ndespise her. It was very well that something should have occurred\r\nwhich would make it impossible that he should any longer wish to\r\nmarry her; but it would be very bitter to her to be rejected even by\r\nhim because she was unfit to be an honest man\'s wife. And then she\r\nasked herself questions about her young lover, who was so handsome,\r\nso bold, so tender to her; who was in all outward respects just what\r\na lover should be. Would he wish to marry her after she had thus\r\nconsented to fly with him, alone, at night: or would he wish that she\r\nshould be his light-of-love, as her aunt had been once cruel enough\r\nto call her? There would be no cruelty, at any rate no injustice, in\r\nso calling her now. And should there be any hesitation on his part,\r\nwould she ask him to make her his wife? It was very terrible to her\r\nto think that it might come to pass that she should have on her knees\r\nto implore this man to marry her. He had called her his queen, but\r\nhe had never said that she should be his wife. And would any pastor\r\nmarry them, coming to him, as they must come, as two runaways? She\r\nknew that certain preliminaries were necessary,--certain bidding of\r\nbanns, and processes before the magistrates. Her own banns and those\r\nof her betrothed, Peter Steinmarc, had been asked once in the church\r\nof St. Lawrence, as she had heard with infinite disgust. She did not\r\nsee that it was possible that Ludovic should marry her, even if he\r\nwere willing to do so. But it was too late to think of all this now;\r\nand she could only moisten the rough sacking with her tears.\r\n\r\n"You had better get up now, dearest," said Ludovic, again bending\r\nover her.\r\n\r\n"Has the time come?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; the time has come, and we must be moving. The rain is over,\r\nwhich is a comfort. It is as dark as pitch, too. Cling close to me. I\r\nshould know my way if I were blindfold."\r\n\r\nShe did cling close to him, and he conducted her through narrow\r\nstreets and passages out to the city gate, which led to the railway\r\nstation. Nuremberg has still gates like a fortified town, and there\r\nare, I believe, porters at the gates with huge keys. Nuremberg\r\ndelights to perpetuate the memories of things that are gone. But\r\ningress and egress are free to everybody, by night as well as by day,\r\nas it must be when railway trains arrive and start at three in the\r\nmorning; and the burgomaster and warders, and sentinels and porters,\r\nthough they still carry the keys, know that the glory of their house\r\nhas gone.\r\n\r\nRailway tickets for two were given to Linda without a question,--for\r\nto her was intrusted the duty of procuring them,--and they were soon\r\nhurrying away towards Augsburg through the dark night. At any rate\r\nthey had been successful in escaping. "After to-morrow we will be as\r\nhappy as the day is long," said Ludovic, as he pressed his companion\r\nclose to his side. Linda told herself, but did not tell him, that she\r\nnever could be happy again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were whirled away through the dark cold night with the noise\r\nof the rattling train ever in their ears. Though there had been a\r\nrailway running close by Nuremberg now for many years, Linda was not\r\nherself so well accustomed to travelling as will probably be most of\r\nthose who will read this tale of her sufferings. Now and again in\r\nthe day-time, and generally in fair weather, she had gone as far as\r\nF\xfcrth, and on one occasion even as far as W\xfcrzburg with her aunt when\r\nthere had been a great gathering of German Anabaptists at that town;\r\nbut she had never before travelled at night, and she had certainly\r\nnever before travelled in such circumstances as those which now\r\nenveloped her. When she entered the carriage, she was glad to\r\nsee that there were other persons present. There was a woman,\r\nthough the woman was so closely muffled and so fast asleep that\r\nLinda, throughout the whole morning, did not know whether her\r\nfellow-traveller was young or old. Nevertheless, the presence of the\r\nwoman was in some sort a comfort to her, and there were two men in\r\nthe carriage, and a little boy. She hardly understood why, but she\r\nfelt that it was better for her to have fellow-travellers. Neither\r\nof them, however, spoke above a word or two either to her or to her\r\nlover. At first she sat at a little distance from Ludovic,--or rather\r\ninduced him to allow that there should be some space between them;\r\nbut gradually she suffered him to come closer to her, and she dozed\r\nwith her head upon his shoulder. Very little was said between them.\r\nHe whispered to her from time to time sundry little words of love,\r\ncalling her his queen, his own one, his life, and the joy of his\r\neyes. But he told her little or nothing of his future plans, as she\r\nwould have wished that he should do. She asked him, however, no\r\nquestions;--none at least till their journey was nearly over. The\r\nmore that his conduct warranted her want of trust, the more unwilling\r\ndid she become to express any diffidence or suspicion.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she became very cold;--so cold that that now became for\r\nthe moment her greatest cause of suffering. It was mid-winter, and\r\nthough the cloak she had brought was the warmest garment that she\r\npossessed, it was very insufficient for such work as the present\r\nnight had brought upon her. Besides her cloak, she had nothing\r\nwherewith to wrap herself. Her feet became like ice, and then the\r\nchill crept up her body; and though she clung very close to her\r\nlover, she could not keep herself from shivering as though in an ague\r\nfit. She had no hesitation now in striving to obtain some warmth by\r\nhis close proximity. It seemed to her as though the cold would kill\r\nher before she could reach Augsburg. The train would not be due there\r\ntill nine in the morning, and it was still dark night as she thought\r\nthat it would be impossible for her to sustain such an agony of\r\npain much longer. It was still dark night, and the violent rain\r\nwas pattering against the glass, and the damp came in through the\r\ncrevices, and the wind blew bitterly upon her; and then as she\r\nturned a little to ask her lover to find some comfort for her, some\r\nmitigation of her pain, she perceived that he was asleep. Then the\r\ntears began to run down her cheeks, and she told herself that it\r\nwould be well if she could die.\r\n\r\nAfter all, what did she know of this man who was now sleeping by her\r\nside,--this man to whom she had intrusted everything, more than her\r\nhappiness, her very soul? How many words had she ever spoken to him?\r\nWhat assurance had she even of his heart? Why was he asleep, while\r\nher sufferings were so very cruel to her? She had encountered the\r\nevils of this elopement to escape what had appeared to her the\r\ngreater evils of a detested marriage. Steinmarc was very much to be\r\nhated. But might it not be that even that would have been better than\r\nthis? Poor girl! the illusion even of her love was being frozen cold\r\nwithin her during the agony of that morning. All the while the train\r\nwent thundering on through the night, now rushing into a tunnel, now\r\ncrossing a river, and at every change in the sounds of the carriages\r\nshe almost hoped that something might be amiss. Oh, the cold! She had\r\ngathered her feet up and was trying to sit on them. For a moment or\r\ntwo she had hoped that her movement would waken Ludovic, so that she\r\nmight have had the comfort of a word; but he had only tumbled with\r\nhis head hither and thither, and had finally settled himself in a\r\nposition in which he leaned heavily upon her. She thought that he\r\nwas heartless to sleep while she was suffering; but she forgot that\r\nhe had watched at the window while she had slumbered upon the sacks\r\nin the warehouse. At length, however, she could bear his weight no\r\nlonger, and she was forced to rouse him. "You are so heavy," she\r\nsaid; "I cannot bear it;" when at last she succeeded in inducing him\r\nto sit upright.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! oh, ah, yes. How cold it is! I think I have been asleep."\r\n\r\n"The cold is killing me," she said.\r\n\r\n"My poor darling! What shall I do? Let me see. Where do you feel it\r\nmost."\r\n\r\n"All over. Do you not feel how I shiver? Oh, Ludovic, could we get\r\nout at the next station?"\r\n\r\n"Impossible, Linda. What should we do there?"\r\n\r\n"And what shall we do at Augsburg? Oh dear, I wish I had not come.\r\nI am so cold. It is killing me." Then she burst out into floods of\r\nsobbing, so that the old man opposite to her was aroused. The old man\r\nhad brandy in his basket and made her drink a little. Then after a\r\nwhile she was quieted, and was taken by station after station without\r\ndemanding of Ludovic that he should bring this weary journey to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nGradually the day dawned, and the two could look at each other in the\r\ngrey light of the morning. But Linda thought of her own appearance\r\nrather than that of her lover. She had been taught that it was\r\nrequired of a woman that she should be neat, and she felt now that\r\nshe was dirty, foul inside and out,--a thing to be scorned. As their\r\ncompanions also bestirred themselves in the daylight, she was afraid\r\nto meet their eyes, and strove to conceal her face. The sacks in\r\nthe warehouse had, in lieu of a better bed, been acceptable; but\r\nshe was aware now, as she could see the skirts of her own dress and\r\nher shoes, and as she glanced her eyes gradually round upon her\r\nshoulders, that the stains of the place were upon her, and she knew\r\nherself to be unclean. That sense of killing cold had passed off from\r\nher, having grown to a numbness which did not amount to present pain,\r\nthough it would hardly leave her without some return of the agony;\r\nbut the misery of her disreputable appearance was almost as bad to\r\nher as the cold had been. It was not only that she was untidy and\r\ndishevelled, but it was that her condition should have been such\r\nwithout the company of any elder female friend whose presence would\r\nhave said, "This young woman is respectable, even though her dress be\r\nsoiled with dust and meal." As it was, the friend by her side was one\r\nwho by his very appearance would condemn her. No one would suppose\r\nher to be his wife. And then the worst of it was that he also would\r\njudge her as others judged her. He also would say to himself that no\r\none would suppose such a woman to be his wife. And if once he should\r\nlearn so to think of her, how could she expect that he would ever\r\npersuade himself to become her husband? How she wished that she had\r\nremained beneath her aunt\'s roof! It now occurred to her, as though\r\nfor the first time, that no one could have forced her to go to church\r\non that thirtieth of January and become Peter Steinmarc\'s wife. Why\r\nhad she not remained at home and simply told her aunt that the thing\r\nwas impossible?\r\n\r\nAt last they were within an hour of Augsburg, and even yet she knew\r\nnothing as to his future plans. It was very odd that he should not\r\nhave told her what they were to do at Augsburg. He said that she\r\nshould be his queen, that she should be as happy as the day was long,\r\nthat everything would be right as soon as they reached Augsburg; but\r\nnow they were all but at Augsburg, and she did not as yet know what\r\nfirst step they were to take when they reached the town. She had much\r\nwished that he would speak without being questioned, but at last she\r\nthought that she was bound to question him. "Ludovic, where are we\r\ngoing to at Augsburg?"\r\n\r\n"To the Black Bear first. That will be best at first."\r\n\r\n"Is it an inn?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear; not a great big house like the Rothe Ross at Nuremberg,\r\nbut very quiet and retired, in a back street."\r\n\r\n"Do they expect us?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no; not exactly. But that won\'t matter."\r\n\r\n"And how long shall we stay there?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! that must depend on tidings from Berlin and Munich. It may be\r\nthat we shall be compelled to get away from Bavaria altogether." Then\r\nhe paused for a moment, while she was thinking what other question\r\nshe could ask. "By the by," he said, "my father is in Augsburg."\r\n\r\nShe had heard of his father as a man altogether worthless, one ever\r\nin difficulties, who would never work, who had never seemed to wish\r\nto be respectable. When the great sins of Ludovic\'s father had been\r\nmagnified to her by Madame Staubach and by Peter, with certain wise\r\nhints that swans never came out of the eggs of geese, Linda would\r\ndeclare with some pride of spirit that the son was not like the\r\nfather; that the son had never been known to be idle. She had not\r\nattempted to defend the father, of whom it seemed to be acknowledged\r\nby the common consent of all Nuremberg that he was utterly worthless,\r\nand a disgrace to the city which had produced him. But Linda now felt\r\nvery thankful for the assurance of even his presence. Had it been\r\nLudovic\'s mother, how much better would it have been! But that she\r\nshould be received even by his father,--by such a father,--was much\r\nto her in her desolate condition.\r\n\r\n"Will he be at the station?" Linda asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no."\r\n\r\n"Does he expect us?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no. You see, Linda, I only got out of prison yesterday\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"Does your father live in Augsburg?"\r\n\r\n"He hardly lives anywhere. He goes and comes at present as he is\r\nwanted by the cause. It is quite on the cards that we should find\r\nthat the police have nabbed him. But I hope not. I think not. When I\r\nhave seen you made comfortable, and when we have had something to eat\r\nand drink, I shall know where to seek him. While I am doing so, you\r\nhad better lie down."\r\n\r\nShe was afraid to ask him whether his father knew, or would suspect,\r\naught as to his bringing a companion, or whether the old man would\r\nwelcome such a companion for his son. Indeed, she hardly knew how\r\nto frame any question that had application to herself. She merely\r\nassented to his proposition that she should go to bed at the Black\r\nBear, and then waited for the end of their journey. Early in the\r\nmorning their fellow-passengers had left them, and they were now\r\nalone. But Ludovic distressed her no more by the vehemence of his\r\ncaresses. He also was tired and fagged and cold and jaded. It is not\r\nimprobable that he had been meditating whether he, in his present\r\nwalk of life, had done well to encumber himself with the burden of a\r\nyoung woman.\r\n\r\nAt last they were at the platform at Augsburg. "Don\'t move quite\r\nyet," he said. "One has to be a little careful." When she attempted\r\nto raise herself she found herself to be so numb that all quickness\r\nof motion was out of the question. Ludovic, paying no attention to\r\nher, sat back in the carriage, with his cap before his face, looking\r\nwith eager eyes over the cap on to the platform.\r\n\r\n"May we not go now?" said Linda, when she saw that the other\r\npassengers had alighted.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be in a hurry, my girl. By God, there are those ruffians, the\r\ngendarmerie. It\'s all up. By Jove! yes, it\'s all up. That is hard,\r\nafter all I did at Nuremberg."\r\n\r\n"Ludovic!"\r\n\r\n"Look here, Linda. Get out at once and take these letters. Make your\r\nway to the Black Bear, and wait for me."\r\n\r\n"And you?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind me, but do as you\'re told. In a moment it will be too\r\nlate. If we are noticed to be together it will be too late."\r\n\r\n"But how am I to get to the Black Bear?"\r\n\r\n"Heaven and earth! haven\'t you a tongue? But here they are, and it\'s\r\nall up." And so it was. A railway porter opened the door, and behind\r\nthe railway porter were two policemen. Linda, in her dismay, had not\r\neven taken the papers which had been offered to her, and Valcarm, as\r\nsoon as he was sure that the police were upon him, had stuffed them\r\ndown the receptacle made in the door for the fall of the window.\r\n\r\nBut the fate of Valcarm and of his papers is at the present moment\r\nnot of so much moment to us as is that of Linda Tressel. Valcarm was\r\ncarried off, with or without the papers, and she, after some hurried\r\nwords, which were unintelligible to her in her dismay, found herself\r\nupon the platform amidst the porters. A message had come from\r\nNuremberg by the wires to Augsburg, requiring the arrest of Ludovic\r\nValcarm, but the wires had said nothing of any companion that might\r\nbe with him. Therefore Linda was left standing amidst the porters on\r\nthe platform. She asked one of the men about the Black Bear. He shook\r\nhis head, and told her that it was a house of a very bad sort,--of a\r\nvery bad sort indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nA dozen times during the night Linda had remembered that her old\r\nfriend Fanny Heisse, now the wife of Max Bogen, lived at Augsburg,\r\nand as she remembered it, she had asked herself what she would do\r\nwere she to meet Fanny in the streets. Would Fanny condescend to\r\nspeak to her, or would Fanny\'s husband allow his wife to hold any\r\ncommunion with such a castaway? How might she dare to hope that her\r\nold friend would do other than shun her, or, at the very least, scorn\r\nher, and pass her as a thing unseen? And yet, through all the days\r\nof their life, there had been in Linda\'s world a supposition that\r\nLinda was the good young woman, and that Fanny Heisse was, if not a\r\ncastaway, one who had made the frivolities of the world so dear to\r\nher that she could be accounted as little better than a castaway.\r\nLinda\'s conclusion, as she thought of all this, had been, that it\r\nwould be better that she should keep out of the way of the wife of an\r\nhonest man who knew her. All fellowship hereafter with the wives and\r\ndaughters of honest men must be denied to her. She had felt this very\r\nstrongly when she had first seen herself in the dawn of the morning.\r\n\r\nBut now there had fallen upon her a trouble of another kind, which\r\nalmost crushed her,--in which she was not as yet able to see that,\r\nby God\'s mercy, salvation from utter ruin might yet be extended to\r\nher. What should she do now,--now, at this moment? The Black Bear,\r\nto which her lover had directed her, was so spoken of that she did\r\nnot dare to ask to be directed thither. When a compassionate railway\r\nporter pressed her to say whither she would go, she could only totter\r\nto a seat against the wall, and there lay herself down and sob. She\r\nhad no friends, she said; no home; no protector except him who had\r\njust been carried away to prison. The porter asked her whether the\r\nman were her husband, and then again she was nearly choked with sobs.\r\nEven the manner of the porter was changed to her when he perceived\r\nthat she was not the wife of him who had been her companion. He\r\nhanded her over to an old woman who looked after the station, and the\r\nold woman at last learned from Linda the fact that the wife of Max\r\nBogen the lawyer had once been her friend. About two hours after that\r\nshe was seated with Max Bogen himself, in a small close carriage,\r\nand was being taken home to the lawyer\'s house. Max Bogen asked her\r\nhardly a question. He only said that Fanny would be so glad to have\r\nher;--Fanny, he said, was so soft, so good, and so clever, and so\r\nwise, and always knew exactly what ought to be done. Linda heard it\r\nall, marvelling in her dumb half-consciousness. This was the Fanny\r\nHeisse of whom her aunt had so often told her that one so given to\r\nthe vanities of the world could never come to any good!\r\n\r\nMax Bogen handed Linda over to his wife, and then disappeared. "Oh,\r\nLinda, what is it? Why are you here? Dear Linda." And then her old\r\nfriend kissed her, and within half an hour the whole story had been\r\ntold.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that she eloped with him from her aunt\'s house in the\r\nmiddle of the night?" asked Max, as soon as he was alone with his\r\nwife. "Of course she did," said Fanny; "and so would I, had I been\r\ntreated as she has been. It has all been the fault of that wicked old\r\nsaint, her aunt." Then they put their heads together as to the steps\r\nthat must be taken. Fanny proposed that a letter should be at once\r\nsent to Madame Staubach, explaining plainly that Linda had run away\r\nfrom her marriage with Steinmarc, and stating that for the present\r\nshe was safe and comfortable with her old friend. It could hardly\r\nbe said that Linda assented to this, because she accepted all that\r\nwas done for her as a child might accept it. But she knelt upon the\r\nfloor with her head upon her friend\'s lap, kissing Fanny\'s hands,\r\nand striving to murmur thanks. Oh, if they would leave her there\r\nfor three days, so that she might recover something of her strength!\r\n"They shall leave you for three weeks, Linda," said the other.\r\n"Madame Staubach is not the Emperor, that she is to have her own way\r\nin everything. And as for Peter--"\r\n\r\n"Pray, don\'t talk of him;--pray, do not," said Linda, shuddering.\r\n\r\nBut all this comfort was at an end about seven o\'clock on that\r\nevening. The second train in the day from Nuremberg was due at\r\nAugsburg at six, and Max Bogen, though he said nothing on the subject\r\nto Linda, had thought it probable that some messenger from the former\r\ntown might arrive in quest of Linda by that train. At seven there\r\ncame another little carriage up to the door, and before her name\r\ncould be announced, Madame Staubach was standing in Fanny Bogen\'s\r\nparlour. "Oh, my child!" she said. "Oh, my child, may God in His\r\nmercy forgive my child!" Linda cowered in a corner of the sofa and\r\ndid not speak.\r\n\r\n"She hasn\'t done anything in the least wrong," said Fanny; "nothing\r\non earth. You were going to make her marry a man she hated, and so\r\nshe came away. If father had done the same to me, I wouldn\'t have\r\nstayed an hour." Linda still cowered on the sofa, and was still\r\nspeechless.\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach, when she heard this defence of her niece, was hardly\r\npushed to know in what way it was her duty to answer it. It would be\r\nvery expedient, of course, that some story should be told for Linda\r\nwhich might save her from the ill report of all the world,--that some\r\nexcuse should be made which might now, instantly, remove from Linda\'s\r\nname the blight which would make her otherwise to be a thing scorned,\r\ndefamed, useless, and hideous; but the truth was the truth, and even\r\nto save her child from infamy Madame Staubach would not listen to a\r\nlie without refuting it. The punishment of Linda\'s infamy had been\r\ndeserved, and it was right that it should be endured. Hereafter, as\r\nfacts came to disclose themselves, it would be for Peter Steinmarc to\r\nsay whether he would take such a woman for his wife; but whether he\r\ntook her or whether he rejected her, it could not be well that Linda\r\nshould be screened by a lie from any part of the punishment which\r\nshe had deserved. Let her go seven times seven through the fire, if\r\nby such suffering there might yet be a chance for her poor desolate\r\nhalf-withered soul.\r\n\r\n"Done nothing wrong, Fanny Heisse!" said Madame Staubach, who, in\r\nspite of her great fatigue, was still standing in the middle of the\r\nroom. "Do you say so, who have become the wife of an honest\r\nGod-fearing man?"\r\n\r\nBut Fanny was determined that she would not be put down in her own\r\nhouse by Madame Staubach. "It doesn\'t matter whose wife I am," she\r\nsaid, "and I am sure Max will say the same as I do. She hasn\'t\r\ndone anything wrong. She made up her mind to come away because she\r\nwouldn\'t marry Peter Steinmarc. She came here in company with her own\r\nyoung man, as I used to come with Max. And as soon as she got here\r\nshe sent word up to us, and here she is. If there\'s anything very\r\nwicked in that, I\'m not religious enough to understand it. But I tell\r\nyou what I can understand, Madame Staubach,--there is nothing on\r\nearth so horribly wicked as trying to make a girl marry a man whom\r\nshe loathes, and hates, and detests, and abominates. There, Madame\r\nStaubach; that\'s what I\'ve got to say; and now I hope you\'ll stop and\r\nhave supper with Max and Linda and me."\r\n\r\nLinda felt herself to be blushing in the darkness of her corner as\r\nshe heard this excuse for her conduct. No; she had not made the\r\njourney to Augsburg with Ludovic in such fashion as Fanny had,\r\nperhaps more than once, travelled the same route with her present\r\nhusband. Fanny had not come by night, without her father\'s knowledge,\r\nhad not escaped out of a window; nor had Fanny come with any such\r\npurpose as had been hers. There was no salve to her conscience in all\r\nthis, though she felt very grateful to her friend, who was fighting\r\nher battle for her.\r\n\r\n"It is not right that I should argue the matter with you," said\r\nMadame Staubach, with some touch of true dignity. "Alas, I know that\r\nwhich I know. Perhaps you will allow me to say a word in privacy to\r\nthis unfortunate child."\r\n\r\nBut Max Bogen had not paid his wife a false compliment for\r\ncleverness. She perceived at once that the longer this interview\r\nbetween the aunt and her niece could be delayed,--the longer that it\r\ncould be delayed, now that they were in each other\'s company,--the\r\nlighter would be the storm on Linda\'s head when it did come. "After\r\nsupper, Madame Staubach; Linda wants her supper; don\'t you, my pet?"\r\nLinda answered nothing. She could not even look up, so as to meet the\r\nglance of her aunt\'s eyes. But Fanny Bogen succeeded in arranging\r\nthings after her own fashion. She would not leave the room, though in\r\nsooth her presence at the preparation of the supper might have been\r\nuseful. It came to be understood that Madame Staubach was to sleep\r\nat the lawyer\'s house, and great changes were made in order that\r\nthe aunt and niece might not be put in the same room. Early in the\r\nmorning they were to return together to Nuremberg, and then Linda\'s\r\nshort hour of comfort would be over.\r\n\r\nShe had hardly as yet spoken a word to her aunt when Fanny left them\r\nin the carriage together. "There were three or four others there,"\r\nsaid Fanny to her husband, "and she won\'t have much said to her\r\nbefore she gets home."\r\n\r\n"But when she is at home!" Fanny only shrugged her shoulders. "The\r\ntruth is, you know," said Max, "that it was not at all the proper\r\nsort of thing to do!"\r\n\r\n"And who does the proper sort of thing?"\r\n\r\n"You do, my dear."\r\n\r\n"And wouldn\'t you have run away with me if father had wanted me to\r\nmarry some nasty old fellow who cares for nothing but his pipe and\r\nhis beer? If you hadn\'t, I\'d never have spoken to you again."\r\n\r\n"All the same," said Max, "it won\'t do her any good."\r\n\r\nThe journey home to Nuremberg was made almost in silence, and things\r\nhad been so managed by Fanny\'s craft that when the two women entered\r\nthe red house hardly a word between them had been spoken as to the\r\naffairs of the previous day. Tetchen, as she saw them enter, cast\r\na guilty glance on her young mistress, but said not a word. Linda\r\nherself, with a veil over her face which she had borrowed from her\r\nfriend Fanny, hurried up-stairs towards her own room. "Go into my\r\nchamber, Linda," said Madame Staubach, who followed her. Linda did\r\nas she was bid, went in, and stood by the side of her aunt\'s bed.\r\n"Kneel down with me, Linda, and let us pray that the great gift of\r\nrepentance may be given to us," said Madame Staubach. Then Linda\r\nknelt down, and hid her face upon the counterpane.\r\n\r\nAll her sins were recapitulated to her during that prayer. The\r\nwhole heinousness of the thing which she had done was given in its\r\nfull details, and the details were repeated more than once. It was\r\nacknowledged in that prayer that though God\'s grace might effect\r\nabsolute pardon in the world to come, such a deed as that which had\r\nbeen done by this young woman was beyond the pale of pardon in this\r\nworld. And the Giver of all mercy was specially asked so to make\r\nthings clear to that poor sinful creature, that she might not be\r\ndeluded into any idea that the thing which she had done could be\r\njustified. She was told in that prayer that she was impure, vile,\r\nunclean, and infamous. And yet she probably did not suffer from the\r\nprayer half so much as she would have suffered had the same things\r\nbeen said to her face to face across the table. And she recognised\r\nthe truth of the prayer, and she was thankful that no allusion was\r\nmade in it to Peter Steinmarc, and she endeavoured to acknowledge\r\nthat her conduct was that which her aunt represented it to be in\r\nher strong language. When the prayer was over Madame Staubach stood\r\nbefore Linda for a while, and put her two hands on the girl\'s arms,\r\nand lightly kissed her brow. "Linda," she said, "with the Lord\r\nnothing is impossible; with the Lord it is never too late; with the\r\nLord the punishment need never be unto death!" Linda, though she\r\ncould utter no articulate word, acknowledged to herself that her aunt\r\nhad been good to her, and almost forgot the evil things that her aunt\r\nhad worked for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLinda Tressel, before she had gone to bed on that night which she\r\nhad passed at Augsburg, had written a short note which was to be\r\ndelivered, if such delivery should be possible, to Ludovic Valcarm.\r\nThe condition of her lover had, of course, been an added trouble to\r\nthose which were more especially her own. During the last three or\r\nfour hours which she had passed with him in the train her tenderness\r\nfor him had been numbed by her own sufferings, and she had allowed\r\nherself for a while to think that he was not sufficiently alive to\r\nthe great sacrifice she was making on his behalf. But when he was\r\nremoved from her, and had been taken, as she well knew, to the prison\r\nof the city, something of the softness of her love returned to her,\r\nand she tried to persuade herself that she owed to him that duty\r\nwhich a wife would owe. When she spoke to Fanny on the subject, she\r\ndeclared that even if it were possible to her she would not go back\r\nto Ludovic. "I see it differently now," she said; "and I see how bad\r\nit is." But, still,--though she declared that she was very firm in\r\nthat resolve,--she did not like to be carried back to her old home\r\nwithout doing something, making some attempt, which might be at least\r\na token to herself that she had not been heartless in regard to her\r\nlover. She wrote therefore with much difficulty the following few\r\nwords, which Fanny promised that her husband should endeavour to\r\nconvey to the hands of Ludovic Valcarm:\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR LUDOVIC,--My aunt has come here for me, and takes\r\n   me back to Nuremberg to-morrow. When you left me at the\r\n   station I was too ill to go to the place you told me; so\r\n   they sent to this house, and my dear, dear friend Fanny\r\n   Heisse got her husband to come for me, and I am in their\r\n   house now. Then my aunt came, and she will take me home\r\n   to-morrow. I am so unhappy that you should be in trouble!\r\n   I hope that my coming with you did not help to bring it\r\n   about. As for me, I know it is best that I should go back,\r\n   though I think that it will kill me. I was very wicked to\r\n   come. I feel that now, and I know that even you will have\r\n   ceased to respect me. Dear Ludovic, I hope that God will\r\n   forgive us both. It will be better that we should never\r\n   meet again, though the thought that it must be so is\r\n   almost more than I can bear. I have always felt that I was\r\n   different from other girls, and that there never could\r\n   be any happiness for me in this world. God bless you,\r\n   Ludovic. Think of me sometimes,--but never, never, try to\r\n   come for me again.\r\n\r\n   L. T.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had cost her an hour of hard toil to write this little letter,\r\nand when it was written she felt that it was cold, ungrateful,\r\nunloving,--very unlike the words which he would feel that he had a\r\nright to expect from her. Nevertheless, such as it was, she gave\r\nit to her friend Fanny, with many injunctions that it might, if\r\npossible, be placed in the hands of Ludovic. And thus, as she told\r\nherself repeatedly on her way home, the romance of her life was over.\r\nAfter all, the journey to Augsburg would have been serviceable to\r\nher,--would be serviceable although her character should be infamous\r\nfor ever in the town that knew her,--if by that journey she would be\r\nsaved from all further mention of the name of Peter Steinmarc. No\r\ndisgrace would be so bad as the prospect of that marriage. Therefore,\r\nas she journeyed homeward, sitting opposite to her aunt, she\r\nendeavoured to console herself by reflecting that his suit to her\r\nwould surely be at an end. Would it ever reach his dull heart that\r\nshe had consented to destroy her own character, to undergo ill-repute\r\nand the scorn of all honest people, in order that she might not be\r\nforced into the horror of a marriage with him? Could he be made to\r\nunderstand that in her flight from Nuremberg her great motive had\r\nbeen to fly from him?\r\n\r\nOn the second morning after her return even this consolation was\r\ntaken from her, and she learned from her aunt that she had not given\r\nup all hope in the direction of the town-clerk. On the first day\r\nafter her return not a word was said to Linda about Peter, nor would\r\nshe have had any notice of his presence in the house had she not\r\nheard his shoes creaking up and down the stairs. Nor was the name of\r\nLudovic Valcarm so much as mentioned in her presence. Between Tetchen\r\nand her there was not a word passed, unless such as were spoken in\r\nthe presence of Madame Staubach. Linda found that she was hardly\r\nallowed to be for a moment out of her aunt\'s presence, and at this\r\ntime she was unable not to be submissive. It seemed to her that\r\nher aunt was so good to her in not positively upbraiding her from\r\nmorning to night, that it was impossible for her not to be altogether\r\nobedient in all things! She did not therefore even struggle to escape\r\nthe long readings, and the longer prayers, and the austere severity\r\nof her aunt\'s presence. Except in prayer,--in prayers delivered out\r\nloud by the aunt in the niece\'s presence,--no direct mention was\r\nmade of the great iniquity of which Linda had been guilty. Linda was\r\ncalled no heartrending name to her face; but she was required to\r\njoin, and did join over and over again, in petitions to the throne of\r\nmercy "that the poor castaway might be received back again into the\r\npale of those who were accepted." And at this time she would have\r\nbeen content to continue to live like this, to join in such prayers\r\nday after day, to have her own infamy continually brought forward as\r\nneeding some special mercy, if by such means she might be allowed to\r\nlive in tranquillity without sight or mention of Peter Steinmarc. But\r\nsuch tranquillity was not to be hers.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the second day her aunt went out, leaving Linda\r\nalone in the house with Tetchen. Linda at once went to her chamber,\r\nand endeavoured to make herself busy among those possessions of her\r\nown which she had so lately thought that she was leaving for ever.\r\nShe took out her all, the articles of her wardrobe, all her little\r\ntreasures, opened the sweet folds of her modest raiment and refolded\r\nthem, weeping all the while as she thought of the wreck she had made\r\nof herself. But no; it was not she who had made the wreck. She had\r\nbeen ruined by the cruelty of that man whose step at this moment she\r\nheard beneath her. She clenched her fist, and pressed her little foot\r\nagainst the floor, as she thought of the injury which this man had\r\ndone her. There was not enough of charity in her religion to induce\r\nher even to think that she would ever cease to hate him with all the\r\nvigour of her heart. Then Tetchen came to her, and told her that her\r\naunt had returned and desired to see her. Linda instantly went down\r\nto the parlour. Up to this moment she was as a child in her aunt\'s\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, Linda," said Madame Staubach, who had taken off her\r\nbonnet, and was already herself stiffly seated in her accustomed\r\nchair. "Sit down, my dear, while I speak to you." Linda sat down at\r\nsome distance from her aunt, and awaited dumbly the speech that was\r\nto be made to her. "Linda," continued Madame Staubach, "I have been\r\nthis afternoon to the house of your friend Herr Molk." Linda said\r\nnothing out loud, but she declared to herself that Herr Molk was no\r\nfriend of hers. Friend indeed! Herr Molk had shown himself to be\r\none of her bitterest enemies. "I thought it best to see him after\r\nwhat--has been done, especially as he had been with you when you were\r\nill, before you went." Still Linda said nothing. What was there that\r\nshe could possibly say? Madame Staubach paused, not expecting her\r\nniece to speak, but collecting her own thoughts and arranging her\r\nwords. "And Peter Steinmarc was there also," said Madame Staubach.\r\nUpon hearing this Linda\'s heart sank within her. Had all her\r\nsufferings, then, been for nothing? Had she passed that terrible\r\nnight, that terrible day, with no result that might be useful to her?\r\nBut even yet might there not be hope? Was it not possible that her\r\naunt was about to communicate to her the fact that Peter Steinmarc\r\ndeclined to be bound by his engagement to her? She sighed deeply and\r\nalmost sobbed, as she clasped her hands together. Her aunt observed\r\nit all, and then went on with her speech. "You will, I hope, have\r\nunderstood, Linda, that I have not wished to upbraid you."\r\n\r\n"You have been very good, aunt Charlotte."\r\n\r\n"But you must know that that which you have done is,--is,--is a thing\r\naltogether destructive of a young woman\'s name and character." Madame\r\nStaubach\'s voice, as she said this, was tremulous with the excess of\r\nher eagerness. If this were Peter Steinmarc\'s decision, Linda would\r\nbear it all without a complaint. She bowed her head in token that\r\nshe accepted the disgrace of which her aunt had spoken. "Of course,\r\nLinda," continued Madame Staubach, "recovery from so lamentable a\r\nposition is very difficult,--is almost impossible. I do not mean to\r\nsay a word of what has been done. We believe,--that is, I believe,\r\nand Herr Molk, and Peter also believes it--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care what Peter Steinmarc believes," exclaimed Linda, unable\r\nto hold her peace any longer.\r\n\r\n"Linda, Linda, would you be a thing to be shuddered at, a woman\r\nwithout a name, a byword for shame for ever?" Madame Staubach had\r\nbeen interrupted in her statement as to the belief entertained in\r\nrespect to Linda\'s journey by herself and her two colleagues, and did\r\nnot recur to that special point in her narrative. When Linda made no\r\nanswer to her last appeal, she broadly stated the conclusion to which\r\nshe and her friends had come in consultation together in the panelled\r\nchamber of Herr Molk\'s house. "I may as well make the story short,"\r\nshe said. "Herr Molk has explained to Peter that things are not as\r\nbad as they have seemed to be." Every muscle and every fibre in\r\nLinda\'s body was convulsed when she heard this, and she shuddered and\r\nshivered so that she could hardly keep her seat upon her chair. "And\r\nPeter has declared that he will be satisfied if you will at once\r\nagree that the marriage shall take place on the thirtieth of the\r\nmonth. If you will do this, and will make him a promise that you will\r\ngo nowhere without his sanction before that day, he will forget what\r\nhas been done." Linda answered not a word, but burst into tears, and\r\nfell at her aunt\'s feet.\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach was a woman who could bring herself to pardon any\r\nsin that had been committed,--that was done, and, as it were,\r\naccomplished,--hoping in all charity that it would be followed by\r\nrepentance. Therefore she had forgiven, after a fashion, even the\r\nlast tremendous trespass of which her niece had been guilty, and had\r\ncontented herself with forcing Linda to listen to her prayers that\r\nrepentance might be forthcoming. But she could forgive no fault, no\r\nconduct that seemed to herself to be in the slightest degree wrong,\r\nwhile it was in the course of action. She had abstained from all hard\r\nwords against Linda, from all rebuke, since she had found that the\r\nyoung man was gone, and that her niece was willing to return to her\r\nhome. But she would be prepared to exercise all the power which\r\nLinda\'s position had given her, to be as severe as the austerity\r\nof her nature would permit, if this girl should persist in her\r\nobstinacy. She regarded it as Linda\'s positive duty to submit to\r\nPeter Steinmarc as her husband. They had been betrothed with Linda\'s\r\nown consent. The banns had been already once called. She herself had\r\nasked for God\'s protection over them as man and wife. And then how\r\nmuch was there not due to Peter, who had consented, not without much\r\ndifficult persuasion from Herr Molk, to take this soiled flower to\r\nhis bosom, in spite of the darkness of the stain. "There will be\r\nno provoking difficulties made about the house?" Peter had said in\r\na corner to the burgomaster. Then the burgomaster had undertaken\r\nthat in the circumstances as they now existed, there should be no\r\nprovoking difficulties. Herr Molk understood that Linda must give up\r\nsomething on receiving that position of an honest man\'s wife, which\r\nshe was now hardly entitled to expect. Thus the bargain had been\r\nmade, and Madame Staubach was of opinion that it was her first duty\r\nto see that it should not be again endangered by any obstinacy on\r\nbehalf of Linda. Obstinate, indeed! How could she be obstinate after\r\nthat which she had done? She had now fallen at her aunt\'s feet, was\r\nweeping, sobbing, praying for mercy. But Madame Staubach could have\r\nno mercy on the girl in this position. Such mercy would in itself\r\nbe a sin. The sin done she could forgive; the sin a-doing must be\r\ncrushed, and put down, and burnt out, and extinguished, let the agony\r\ncoming from such process be as severe as might be. There could be no\r\nsoftness for Linda while Linda was obstinate. "I cannot suppose," she\r\nsaid, "that you mean to hesitate after what has taken place."\r\n\r\n"Oh, aunt Charlotte! dear aunt Charlotte!"\r\n\r\n"What is the meaning of this?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t love him. I can\'t love him. I will do anything else\r\nthat you please. He may have the house if he wants it. I will\r\npromise;--promise never to go away again or to see anybody." But\r\nshe might as well have addressed such prayers to a figure of stone.\r\nOn such a matter as this Madame Staubach could not be other than\r\nrelentless. Even while Linda was kneeling at her feet convulsed with\r\nsobs, she told the poor girl, with all the severity of language\r\nwhich she could use, of the vileness of the iniquity of that night\'s\r\nproceedings. Linda had been false to her friend, false to her vows,\r\nfalse to her God, immodest, unclean, had sinned against all the laws\r\nby which women bind themselves together for good conduct,--had in\r\nfact become a castaway in very deed. There was nothing that a female\r\ncould do more vile, more loathsome than that which Linda had done.\r\nMadame Staubach believed that the time had come in which it would be\r\nwicked to spare, and she did not spare. Linda grovelled at her feet,\r\nand could only pray that God might take her to Himself at once. "He\r\nwill never take you; never, never, never," said Madame Staubach;\r\n"Satan will have you for his own, and all my prayers will be of no\r\navail."\r\n\r\nThere were two days such as this, and Linda was still alive and still\r\nbore it. On the third day, which was the fifth after her return from\r\nAugsburg, Herr Molk came to her, and at his own request was alone\r\nwith her. He did not vituperate her as her aunt had done, nor did he\r\nexpress any special personal horror at her sin; but he insisted very\r\nplainly on the position which she had made for herself. "You see,\r\nmy dear, the only thing for you is to be married out of hand at\r\nonce, and then nobody will say anything about it. And what is the\r\ndifference if he is a little old? girls forget to think about that\r\nafter a month or two; and then, you see, it will put an end to all\r\nyour troubles;--to all your troubles." Such were the arguments of\r\nHerr Molk; and it must be acknowledged that such arguments were not\r\nlacking in strength, nor were they altogether without truth. The\r\nlittle story of Linda\'s journey to Augsburg had been told throughout\r\nthe city, and there were not wanting many who said that Peter\r\nSteinmarc must be a very good-natured man indeed, if, after all that\r\nhad passed, he would still accept Linda Tressel as his wife. "You\r\nshould remember all that of course, my dear," said Herr Molk.\r\n\r\nHow was it possible that Linda should stand alone against such\r\ninfluence as had been brought to bear against her? She was quite\r\nalone, for she would not admit of any intimacy with Tetchen. She\r\nwould hardly speak to the old woman. She was quite aware that Tetchen\r\nhad arranged with Ludovic the manner of her elopement; and though she\r\nfelt no anger with him, still she was angry with the servant whose\r\nduplicity had helped to bring about the present misery. Had she not\r\nfled with her lover she might then,--so she thought now,--have held\r\nher ground against her aunt and against Peter. As things had gone\r\nwith her since, such obstinacy had become impossible to her. On the\r\nmorning of the seventh day she bowed her head, and though she did\r\nnot speak, she gave her aunt to understand that she had yielded. "We\r\nwill begin to purchase what may be necessary to-morrow," said Madame\r\nStaubach.\r\n\r\nBut even now she had not made up her mind that she would in truth\r\nmarry the man. She had simply found it again impossible to say that\r\nshe would not do so. There was still a chance of escape. She might\r\ndie, for instance! Or she might run away again. If she did that,\r\nsurely the man would persecute her no further. Or at the last moment\r\nshe might stolidly decline to move; she might refuse to stand on her\r\nlegs before the altar. She might be as a dead thing even though she\r\nwere alive,--as a thing dead and speechless. Oh! if she could only be\r\nwithout ears to hear those terrible words which her aunt would say\r\nto her! And then there came another scheme into her mind. She would\r\nmake one great personal appeal to Steinmarc\'s feelings as a man.\r\nIf she implored him not to make her his wife, kneeling before him,\r\nsubmitting herself to him, preferring to him with all her earnestness\r\nthis one great prayer, surely he would not persevere!\r\n\r\nHitherto, since her return from Augsburg, Peter had done very little\r\nto press his own suit. She had again had her hand placed in his since\r\nshe had yielded, and had accepted as a present from him a great glass\r\nbrooch which to her eyes was the ugliest thing in the guise of a\r\ntrinket which the world of vanity had ever seen. She had not been a\r\nmoment in his company without her aunt\'s presence, and there had not\r\nbeen the slightest allusion made by him to her elopement. Peter had\r\nconsidered that such allusion had better come after marriage when his\r\npower would, as he thought, be consolidated. He was surprised when he\r\nwas told, early in the morning after that second hand-pledging, by\r\nLinda herself that she wanted to see him. Linda came to his door and\r\nmade her request in person. Of course he was delighted to welcome\r\nhis future bride to his own apartment, and begged her with as soft a\r\nsmile as he could assume to seat herself in his own arm-chair. She\r\ntook a humbler seat, however, and motioned to him to take that to\r\nwhich he was accustomed. He looked at her as he did so, and perceived\r\nthat the very nature of her face was changed. She had lost the\r\nplumpness of her cheeks, she had lost the fresh colour of her youth,\r\nshe had lost much of her prettiness. But her eyes were brighter than\r\never they had been, and there was something in their expression\r\nwhich almost made Peter uneasy. Though she had lost so much of her\r\nprettiness, he was not on that account moved to doubt the value of\r\nhis matrimonial prize; but there did come across his mind an idea\r\nthat those eyes might perhaps bring with them some discomfort into\r\nhis household. "I am very glad to see you, Linda," he said. "It is\r\nvery good of you to come to me here. Is there anything I can do for\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"There is one thing, Peter Steinmarc, that you can do for me."\r\n\r\n"What is that, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Let me alone." As she spoke she clenched her small fist and brought\r\nit down with some energy on the table that was close to her. She\r\nlooked into his face as she did so, and his eyes quailed before her\r\nglance. Then she repeated her demand. "Let me alone."\r\n\r\n"I do not know what you mean, Linda. Of course you are going to be my\r\nwife now."\r\n\r\n"I do not wish to be your wife. You know that; and if you are a man\r\nyou will not force me." She had intended to be gentle with him, to\r\nentreat him, to win him by humility and softness, and to take his\r\nhand, and even kiss it if he would be good to her. But there was so\r\nmuch of tragedy in her heart, and such an earnestness of purpose in\r\nher mind, that she could not be gentle. As she spoke it seemed to him\r\nthat she was threatening him.\r\n\r\n"It is all settled, Linda. It cannot be changed now."\r\n\r\n"It can be changed. It must be changed. Tell her that I am not good\r\nenough. You need not fear her. And if you will say so, I will never\r\nbe angry with you for the word. I will bless you for it."\r\n\r\n"But, Linda, you did nothing so very much amiss;--did you?" Then\r\nthere came across her mind an idea that she would lie to him, and\r\ndegrade herself with a double disgrace. But she hesitated, and\r\nwas not actress enough to carry on the part. He winked at her as\r\nhe continued to speak. "I know," he said. "It was just a foolish\r\nbusiness, but no worse than that."\r\n\r\nOh heavens, how she hated him! She could have stabbed him to the\r\nheart that moment, had the weapon been there, and had she possessed\r\nthe physical energy necessary for such an enterprise. He was a\r\nthing to her so foul that all her feminine nature recoiled from the\r\ncloseness of his presence, and her flesh crept as she felt that the\r\nsame atmosphere encompassed them. And this man was to be her husband!\r\nShe must speak to him, speak out, speak very plainly. Could it be\r\npossible that a man should wish to take a woman to his bosom who had\r\ntold him to his face that he was loathed? "Peter," she said, "I am\r\nsure that you don\'t think that I love you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why you shouldn\'t, Linda."\r\n\r\n"I do not;--not the least; I can promise you that. And I never\r\nshall;--never. Think what it would be to have a wife who doesn\'t love\r\nyou a bit. Would not that be bad?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you will."\r\n\r\n"Never! Don\'t you know that I love somebody else very dearly?"\r\nOn hearing this there came something of darkness upon Peter\'s\r\nbrow,--something which indicated that he had been touched. Linda\r\nunderstood it all. "But I will never speak to him again, never see\r\nhim, if you will let me alone."\r\n\r\n"See him, Linda! He is in prison, and will be sent to the quarries to\r\nwork. He will never be a free man again. Ha! ha! I need not fear him,\r\nmy dear."\r\n\r\n"But you shall fear me. Yes; I will lead you such a life! Peter\r\nSteinmarc, I will make you rue the day you first saw me. You shall\r\nwish that you were at the quarries yourself. I will disgrace you, and\r\nmake your name infamous. I will waste everything that you have. There\r\nis nothing so bad I will not do to punish you. Yes; you may look at\r\nme, but I will. Do you think that you are to trample me under foot,\r\nand that I will not have my revenge? You said it was a foolish\r\nbusiness that I did. I will make it worse than foolish." He stood\r\nwith his hands in the pockets of his broad flaps, looking at her, not\r\nknowing how to answer her. He was no coward,--not such a coward as\r\nto be intimidated at the moment by the girl\'s violence. And being\r\nnow thoroughly angry, her words had not worked upon him as she had\r\nintended that they should work. His desire was to conquer her and get\r\nthe best of her; but his thoughts worked slowly, and he did not know\r\nhow to answer her. "Well, what do you say to me? If you will let me\r\nescape, I will always be your friend."\r\n\r\n"I will not let you escape," he said.\r\n\r\n"And you expect that I shall be your wife?"\r\n\r\n"I do expect it."\r\n\r\n"I shall die first; yes;--die first. To be your wife! Oh, there is\r\nnot a beggar in the streets of Nuremberg whom I would not sooner\r\ntake for my husband." She paused, but again he was at a loss for\r\nwords. "Come, Peter, think of it. Do not drive a poor weak girl to\r\ndesperation. I have been very unhappy,--very; you do not know how\r\nunhappy I have been. Do not make it worse for me." Then the chord\r\nwhich had been strung so tightly was broken asunder. Her strength\r\nfailed her, and she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"I will make you pay dearly for all this one of these days,\r\nfraulein," said Peter, as, with his hands still in his pockets, he\r\nleft the room. She watched him as he creaked down-stairs, and went\r\ninto her aunt\'s apartments. For a moment she felt disposed to go and\r\nconfront him there before her aunt. Together, the two of them, could\r\nnot force her to marry him. But her courage failed her. Though she\r\ncould face Peter Steinmarc without flinching, she feared the words\r\nwhich her aunt could say to her. She had not scrupled to threaten\r\nSteinmarc with her own disgrace, but she could not endure to be told\r\nby her aunt that she was degraded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Steinmarc, when he went into Madame Staubach\'s parlour, found\r\nthat lady on her knees in prayer. He had entered the room without\r\nnotice, having been urged to this unwonted impetuosity by the\r\nseverity of the provocation which he had received. Madame Staubach\r\nraised her head; but when she saw him she did not rise. He stood\r\nthere for some seconds looking at her, expecting her to get up and\r\ngreet him; but when he found that such was not her purpose, he turned\r\nangrily on his heel, and went out of the house, up to his office in\r\nthe town-hall. His services were not of much service to the city\r\non that day,--neither on that day nor on the two following days.\r\nHe was using all his mental faculties in endeavouring to decide\r\nwhat it might be best for him to do in the present emergency. The\r\nred house was a chattel of great value in Nuremberg,--a thing very\r\ndesirable,--the possession of which Peter himself did desire with all\r\nhis heart. But then, even in regard to the house, it was not to be\r\narranged that Peter was to become the sole and immediate possessor\r\nof it on his marriage. Madame Staubach was to live there, and during\r\nher life the prize would be but a half-and-half possession. Madame\r\nStaubach was younger than himself; and though he had once thought of\r\nmarrying her, he was not sure that he was now desirous of living in\r\nthe same house with her for the remainder of his life. He had wished\r\nto marry Linda Tressel, because she was young, and was acknowledged\r\nto be a pretty girl; and he still wished to marry her, if not now for\r\nthese reasons, still for others which were quite as potent. He wanted\r\nto be her master, to get the better of her, to punish her for her\r\ndisdain of him, and to bring her to his feet. But he was not a man so\r\ncarried away by anger or by a spirit of revenge as to be altogether\r\nindifferent to his own future happiness. There had already been some\r\namong his fellow-citizens, or perhaps citizenesses, kind enough to\r\ncompliment him on his good-nature. He had been asked whether Linda\r\nTressel had told him all about her little trip to Augsburg, and\r\nwhether he intended to ask his cousin Ludovic Valcarm to come to his\r\nwedding. And now Linda herself had said things to him which made him\r\ndoubt whether she was fit to be the wife of a man so respectable and\r\nso respected as himself. And were she to do those things which she\r\nthreatened, where would he be then? All the town would laugh at him,\r\nand he would be reduced to live for the remainder of his days in the\r\nsole company of Madame Staubach as the result of his enterprise. He\r\nwas sufficiently desirous of being revenged on Linda, but he was a\r\ncautious man, and began to think that he might buy even that pleasure\r\ntoo dear. He had been egged on to the marriage by Herr Molk and one\r\nor two others of the city pundits,--by the very men whose opposition\r\nhe had feared when the idea of marrying Linda was first suggested to\r\nhim. They had told him that Linda was all right, that the elopement\r\nhad been in point of fact nothing. "Young girls will be young before\r\nthey are settled," Herr Molk had said. Then the extreme desirability\r\nof the red house had been mentioned, and so Peter had been persuaded.\r\nBut now, as the day drew near, and as Linda\'s words sounded in his\r\nears, he hardly knew what to think of it. On the evening of the third\r\nday of his contemplation, he went again to his friend Herr Molk.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Peter," said the magistrate; "you must go on now, and\r\nthere is no reason why you should not. Is a man of your standing to\r\nbe turned aside by a few idle words from a young girl?"\r\n\r\n"But she told me-- You can\'t understand what she told me. She\'s been\r\naway with this young fellow once, and she said as much as that she\'d\r\ngo again."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! you haven\'t had to do with women as I have, or you would\r\nunderstand them better. Of course a young girl likes to have her\r\nlittle romance. But when a girl has been well brought up,--and there\r\nis no better bringing up than what Linda Tressel has had,--marriage\r\nsteadies them directly. Think of the position you\'ll have in the city\r\nwhen the house belongs to yourself."\r\n\r\nPeter, when he left the magistrate, was still tossed about by an\r\ninfinity of doubts. If he should once take the girl as his wife,\r\nhe could never unmarry himself again. He could not do so at least\r\nwithout trouble, disgrace, and ruinous expense. As for revenge, he\r\nthought that he might still have a certain amount of that pleasure in\r\nrepudiating his promised spouse for her bad conduct, and in declaring\r\nto her aunt that he could not bring himself to make a wife of a woman\r\nwho had first disgraced herself, and then absolutely taken glory\r\nin her disgrace. As he went along from Herr Molk\'s house towards\r\nthe island, taking a somewhat long path by the Rothe Ross where he\r\nrefreshed himself, and down the Carls Strasse, and by the Church of\r\nSt. Lawrence, round which he walked twice, looking up to the tower\r\nfor inspiration,--he told himself that circumstances had been most\r\ncruel to him. He complained bitterly of his misfortune. If he refused\r\nto marry Linda he must leave the red house altogether, and would,\r\nof course, be ridiculed for his attempt at matrimony; and if he did\r\nmarry her-- Then, as far as he could see, there would be the very\r\nmischief. He pitied himself with an exceedingly strong compassion,\r\nbecause of the unmerited hardness of his position. It was very\r\ndark when he got to the narrow passage leading to the house along\r\nthe river, and when there, in the narrowest and darkest part of\r\nthe passage, whom should he meet coming from Madame Staubach\'s\r\nhouse,--coming from Linda\'s house, for the passage led from the red\r\nhouse only,--but Ludovic Valcarm his cousin?\r\n\r\n"What, uncle Peter?" said Ludovic, assuming a name which he had\r\nsometimes used in old days when he had wished to be impertinent to\r\nhis relative. Peter Steinmarc was too much taken aback to have any\r\nspeech ready on the occasion. "You don\'t say a word to congratulate\r\nme on having escaped from the hands of the Philistines."\r\n\r\n"What are you doing here?" said Peter.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been to see my young woman," said Ludovic, who, as Peter\r\nimagined, was somewhat elated by strong drink.\r\n\r\n"She is not your young woman," said Peter.\r\n\r\n"She is not yours at any rate," said the other.\r\n\r\n"She is mine if I like to take her," said Peter.\r\n\r\n"We shall see about that. But here I am again, at any rate. The\r\nmischief take them for interfering old fools! When they had got me\r\nthey had nothing to say against me."\r\n\r\n"Pass on, and let me go by," said Peter.\r\n\r\n"One word first, uncle Peter. Among you, you are treating that girl\r\nas cruelly as ever a girl was treated. You had better be warned by\r\nme, and leave off. If she were forced into a marriage with you, you\r\nwould only disgrace yourself. I don\'t suppose you want to see her\r\ndead at your feet. Go on now, and think of what I have said to you."\r\nSo Ludovic had been with her again! No; he, Peter Steinmarc, would\r\nnot wed with one who was so abandoned. He would reject her;--would\r\nreject her that very night. But he would do so in a manner that\r\nshould leave her very little cause for joy or triumph.\r\n\r\nWe must now go back for a while to Linda and her aunt. No detailed\r\naccount of that meeting between Linda and Steinmarc, in Steinmarc\'s\r\nroom, ever reached Madame Staubach\'s ears. That there had been an\r\ninterview, and that Linda had asked Steinmarc to absolve her from her\r\ntroth, the aunt did learn from the niece; and most angry she was when\r\nshe learned it. She again pointed out to the sinner the terrible sin\r\nof which she was guilty in not submitting herself entirely, in not\r\neradicating and casting out from her bosom all her human feelings,\r\nin not crushing herself, as it were, upon a wheel, in token of her\r\nrepentance for what she had done. Sackcloth and ashes, in their\r\nmaterial shape, were odious to the imagination of Madame Staubach,\r\nbecause they had a savour of Papacy, and implied that the poor sinner\r\nwho bore them could do something towards his own salvation by his own\r\nworks; but that moral sackcloth, and those ashes of the heart and\r\nmind, which she was ever prescribing to Linda, seemed to her to have\r\nnone of this taint. And yet, in what is the difference? The school of\r\nreligion to which Madame Staubach belonged was very like that early\r\nschool of the Church of Rome in which material ashes were first used\r\nfor the personal annoyance of the sinner. But the Church of Rome in\r\nMadame Staubach\'s day had, by the force of the human nature of its\r\nadherents, made its way back to the natural sympathies of mankind;\r\nwhereas in Madame Staubach\'s school the austerity of self-punishment\r\nwas still believed to be all in all. During the days of Steinmarc\'s\r\nmeditation, Linda was prayed for and was preached to with an\r\nunflagging diligence which, at the end of that time, had almost\r\nbrought the girl to madness. For Linda the worst circumstance of all\r\nwas this, that she had never as yet brought herself to disbelieve her\r\naunt\'s religious menaces. She had been so educated that what fixed\r\nbelief she had on the subject at all was in accordance with her\r\naunt\'s creed rather than against it. When she was alone, she would\r\ntell herself that it was her lot to undergo that eternal condemnation\r\nwith which her aunt threatened her; though in telling herself so she\r\nwould declare to herself also that whatever that punishment could be,\r\nher Creator, let Him be ever so relentless, could inflict nothing\r\non her worse than that state of agony with which His creatures had\r\ntormented her in this world.\r\n\r\nShe was in this state when Tetchen crept up to her room, on that\r\nevening on which Peter had been with Herr Molk. "Fraulein," said\r\nTetchen, "you are very unkind to me."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Linda, not looking up into the woman\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I have done everything in my power for you, as though you had been\r\nmy own."\r\n\r\n"I am not your own. I don\'t want you to do anything for me."\r\n\r\n"I love you dearly, and I love him,--Ludovic. Have I not done\r\neverything in my power to save you from the man you hate?"\r\n\r\n"You made me go off with him in the night, like a--like a--! Oh,\r\nTetchen, was that treating me as though I had been your own? Would\r\nyou have done that for your own child?"\r\n\r\n"Why not,--if you are to be his wife?"\r\n\r\n"Tetchen, you have made me hate you, and you have made me hate\r\nmyself. If I had not done that, I should not be such a coward. Go\r\naway. I do not want to speak to you."\r\n\r\nThen the old woman came close up to Linda, and stood for a moment\r\nleaning over her. Linda took no notice of her, but continued by a\r\ncertain tremulous shaking of her knee to show how strongly she was\r\nmoved. "My darling," said Tetchen, "why should you send away from you\r\nthose who love you?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody loves me," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"I love you,--and Ludovic loves you."\r\n\r\n"That is of no use,--of none at all. I do not wish to hear his name\r\nagain. It was not his fault, but he has disgraced me. It was my own\r\nfault,--and yours."\r\n\r\n"Linda, he is in the house now."\r\n\r\n"Who--Ludovic?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; Ludovic Valcarm."\r\n\r\n"In the house? How did he escape?"\r\n\r\n"They could do nothing to him. They let him go. They were obliged to\r\nlet him go."\r\n\r\nThen Linda got up from her seat, and stood for a minute with her eyes\r\nfixed upon the old woman\'s face, thinking what step she had better\r\ntake. In the confusion of her mind, and in the state to which she\r\nhad been reduced, there was no idea left with her that it might yet\r\nbe possible that she would become the wife of Ludovic Valcarm, and\r\nlive as such the life of a respectable woman. She had taught herself\r\nto acknowledge that her elopement with him had made that quite\r\nimpossible;--that by what they had done they had both put themselves\r\nbeyond the pale of such gentle mercy. Such evil had come to her from\r\nher secret interviews with this man who had become her lover almost\r\nwithout her own acquiescence, that she dreaded him even though she\r\nloved him. The remembrance of the night she had passed with him,\r\npartly in the warehouse and partly in the railway train, had nothing\r\nin it of the sweetness of love, to make her thoughts of it acceptable\r\nto her. This girl was so pure at heart, was by her own feelings so\r\nprone to virtue, that she looked back upon what she had done with\r\nabhorrence. Whether she had sinned or not, she hated what she had\r\ndone as though it had been sinful; and now, when she was told that\r\nLudovic Valcarm was again in the house, she recoiled from the idea of\r\nmeeting him. On the former occasions of his coming to her, a choice\r\nhad hardly been allowed to her whether she would see him or not. He\r\nhad been with her before she had had time to fly from him. Now she\r\nhad a moment for thought,--a moment in which she could ask herself\r\nwhether it would be good for her to place herself again in his hands.\r\nShe said that it would not be good, and she walked steadily down to\r\nher aunt\'s parlour. "Aunt Charlotte," she said, "Ludovic Valcarm is\r\nin the house."\r\n\r\n"In this house,--again!" exclaimed Madame Staubach. Linda, having\r\nmade her statement, said not a word further. Though she had felt\r\nherself compelled to turn informant against her lover, and by\r\nimplication against Tetchen, her lover\'s accomplice, nevertheless she\r\ndespised herself for what she was doing. She did not expect to soften\r\nher aunt by her conduct, or in any way to mitigate the rigour of her\r\nown sufferings. Her clandestine meetings with Ludovic had brought\r\nwith them so much of pain and shame, that she had resolved almost by\r\ninstinct to avoid another. But having taken this step to avoid it,\r\nshe had nothing further to say or to do. "Where is the young man?"\r\ndemanded Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"Tetchen says that he is here, in the house," said Linda. Then Madame\r\nStaubach left the parlour, and crossed into the kitchen. There,\r\nstanding close to the stove and warming himself, she found this\r\nterrible youth who had worked her so much trouble. It seemed to\r\nMadame Staubach that for months past she had been hearing of his\r\nhaving been constantly in and about the house, entering where he\r\nwould and when he would, and in all those months she had never seen\r\nhim. When last she had beheld him he had been to her simply a foolish\r\nidle youth with whom his elder cousin had been forced to quarrel.\r\nSince that, he had become to her a source of infinite terror. He had\r\nbeen described to her as one guilty of crimes which, much as she\r\nhated them, produced, even in her breast, a kind of respect for the\r\ncriminal. He was a rebel of whom the magistrates were afraid. When in\r\nprison he had had means of escaping. When arrested at Nuremberg he\r\nwould be the next day at Augsburg; when arrested at Augsburg he would\r\nbe the next day at Nuremberg. He could get in and out of the roofs of\r\nhouses, and could carry away with him a young maiden. These are deeds\r\nwhich always excite a certain degree of admiration in the female\r\nheart, and Madame Staubach, though she was a Baptist, was still\r\na female. When, therefore, she found herself in the presence of\r\nLudovic, she could not treat him with the indignant scorn with\r\nwhich she would have received him had he intruded upon her premises\r\nbefore her fears of him had been excited. "Why are you here, Ludovic\r\nValcarm?" she said advancing hardly a step beyond the doorway.\r\nLudovic looked up at her with his hand resting on the table. He was\r\nnot drunk, but he had been drinking; his clothes were soiled; he\r\nwas unwashed and dirty, and the appearance of the man was that of a\r\nvagabond. "Speak to me, and tell me why you are here," said Madame\r\nStaubach.\r\n\r\n"I have come to look for my wife," said Ludovic.\r\n\r\n"You have no wife;--at any rate you have none here."\r\n\r\n"Linda Tressel is my true and lawful wife, and I have come to take\r\nher away with me. She went with me once, and now she will go again.\r\nWhere is she? You\'re not going to keep her locked up. It\'s against\r\nthe law to make a young woman a prisoner."\r\n\r\n"My niece does not wish to see you;--does not intend to see you. Go\r\naway."\r\n\r\nBut he refused to go, and threatened her, alleging that Linda Tressel\r\nwas of an age which allowed her to dispose as she pleased of her\r\nperson and her property. Of course this was of no avail with Madame\r\nStaubach, who was determined that, whatever might happen, the young\r\nman should not force himself into Linda\'s presence. When Ludovic\r\nattempted to leave the kitchen, Madame Staubach stood in the doorway\r\nand called for Tetchen. The servant, who had perched herself on the\r\nlanding, since Linda had entered the parlour, was down in a moment,\r\nand with various winks and little signs endeavoured to induce Valcarm\r\nto leave the house. "You had better go, or I shall call at once for\r\nmy neighbour Jacob Heisse," said Madame Staubach. Then she did call,\r\nas lustily as she was able, though in vain. Upon this Ludovic, not\r\nknowing how to proceed, unable or unwilling to force his way further\r\ninto the house in opposition to Madame Staubach, took his departure,\r\nand as he went met Peter Steinmarc in the passage at the back of\r\nHeisse\'s house. Madame Staubach was still in the kitchen asking\r\nquestions of Tetchen which Tetchen did not answer with perfect truth,\r\nwhen Peter appeared among them. "Madame Staubach," he said, "that\r\nvagabond Ludovic Valcarm has just been here, in this house."\r\n\r\n"He went away but a minute since," said Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"Just so. That is exactly what I mean. This is a thing not to be\r\nborne,--not to be endured, and shows that your niece Linda is\r\naltogether beyond the reach of any good impressions."\r\n\r\n"Peter Steinmarc!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is all very well; of course I expect that you will take\r\nher part; although, with your high ideas of religion and all that\r\nsort of thing, it is almost unaccountable that you should do so. As\r\nfar as I am concerned there must be an end of it. I am not going to\r\nmake myself ridiculous to all Nuremberg by marrying a young woman who\r\nhas no sense whatever of self-respect. I have overlooked a great deal\r\ntoo much already,--a great deal too much."\r\n\r\n"But Linda has not seen the young man. It was she herself who told me\r\nthat he was here."\r\n\r\n"Ah, very well. I don\'t know anything about that. I saw him coming\r\naway from here, and it may be as well to tell you that I have made up\r\nmy mind. Linda Tressel is not the sort of young woman that I took her\r\nto be, and I shall have nothing more to say to her."\r\n\r\n"You are an old goose," said Tetchen.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue," said Madame Staubach angrily to her servant.\r\nThough she was very indignant with Peter Steinmarc, still it would go\r\nmuch against the grain with her that the match should be broken off.\r\nShe had resolved so firmly that this marriage was proper for all\r\npurposes, that she had almost come to look at it as though it were\r\na thing ordained of God. Then, too, she remembered, even in this\r\nmoment, that Peter Steinmarc had received great provocation. Her\r\nimmediate object was to persuade him that nothing had been done to\r\ngive him further provocation. No fault had been committed by Linda\r\nwhich had not already been made known to him and been condoned by\r\nhim. But how was she to explain all this to him in privacy, while\r\nTetchen was in the kitchen, and Linda was in the parlour opposite?\r\n"Peter, on my word as an honest truthful woman, Linda has been guilty\r\nof no further fault."\r\n\r\n"She has been guilty of more than enough," said Peter.\r\n\r\n"That may be said of all us guilty, frail, sinful human beings,"\r\nrejoined Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"I doubt whether there are any of us so bad as she is," said Peter.\r\n\r\n"I wonder, madame, you can condescend to argue with him," said\r\nTetchen; "as if all the world did not know that the fraulein is ten\r\ntimes too good for the like of him!"\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue," said Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"And where is Miss Linda at the present moment?" demanded Peter.\r\nMadame Staubach hesitated for an instant before she answered, and\r\nthen replied that Linda was in the parlour. It might seem, she\r\nthought, that there was some cause for secrecy if she made any\r\nconcealment at the present moment. Then Peter made his way out of the\r\nkitchen and across the passage, and without any invitation entered\r\nthe parlour. Madame Staubach followed him, and Tetchen followed also.\r\nIt was unfortunate for Madame Staubach\'s plans that the meeting\r\nbetween Peter and Linda should take place in this way, but she could\r\nnot help it. But she was already making up her mind to this,--that if\r\nPeter Steinmarc ill-treated her niece, she would bring all Nuremberg\r\nabout his ears.\r\n\r\n"Linda Tressel," he said;--and as he spoke, the impetuosity of\r\nindignation to which he had worked himself had not as yet subsided,\r\nand therefore he was full of courage;--"Linda Tressel, I find that\r\nthat vagabond Ludovic Valcarm has again been here."\r\n\r\n"He is no vagabond," said Linda, turning upon him with full as much\r\nindignation as his own.\r\n\r\n"All the city knows him, and all the city knows you too. You are no\r\nbetter than you should be, and I wash my hands of you."\r\n\r\n"Let it be so," said Linda; "and for such a blessing I will pardon\r\nyou the unmanly cruelty of your words."\r\n\r\n"But I will not pardon him," said Madame Staubach. "It is false; and\r\nif he dares to repeat such words, he shall rue them as long as he\r\nlives. Linda, this is to go for nothing,--for nothing. Perhaps it\r\nis not unnatural that he should have some suspicion." Poor Madame\r\nStaubach, agitated by divided feelings, hardly knew on which side to\r\nuse her eloquence.\r\n\r\n"I should think not indeed," said Peter, in triumph. "Unnatural! Ha!\r\nha!"\r\n\r\n"I will put his eyes out of him if he laughs like that," said\r\nTetchen, looking as though she were ready to put her threat into\r\nexecution upon the instant.\r\n\r\n"Peter Steinmarc, you are mistaken in this," said Madame Staubach.\r\n"You had better let me see you in private."\r\n\r\n"Mistaken, am I? Oh! am I mistaken in thinking that she was alone\r\nduring the whole night with Ludovic? A man does not like such\r\nmistakes as that. I tell you that I have done with her,--done with\r\nher,--done with her! She is a bad piece. She does not ring sound.\r\nMadame Staubach, I respect you, and am sorry for you; but you know\r\nthe truth as well as I do."\r\n\r\n"Man," she said to him, "you are ungrateful, cruel, and unjust."\r\n\r\n"Aunt Charlotte," said Linda, "he has done me the only favour that\r\nI could accept at his hands. It is true that I have done that which,\r\nhad he been a man, would have prevented him from seeking to make me\r\nhis wife. All that is true. I own it."\r\n\r\n"There; you hear her, Madame Staubach."\r\n\r\n"And you shall hear me by-and-by," said Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"But it is no thought of that that has made him give me up,"\r\ncontinued Linda. "He knows that he never could have got my hand. I\r\ntold him that I would die first, and he has believed me. It is very\r\nwell that he should give me up; but no one else, no other man alive,\r\nwould have been base enough to have spoken to any woman as he has\r\nspoken to me."\r\n\r\n"It is all very well for you to say so," said Peter.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Charlotte, I hope I may never be asked to hear another word\r\nfrom his lips, or to speak another word to his ears." Then Linda\r\nescaped from the room, thinking as she went that God in His mercy had\r\nsaved her at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nAll January had passed by. That thirtieth of January had come and\r\ngone which was to have made Linda Tressel a bride, and Linda was\r\nstill Linda Tressel. But her troubles were not therefore over, and\r\nPeter Steinmarc was once again her suitor. It may be remembered\r\nhow he had reviled her in her aunt\'s presence, how he had reminded\r\nher of her indiscretion, and how he had then rejected her; but,\r\nnevertheless, in the first week of February he was again her suitor.\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach had passed a very troubled and uneasy month.\r\nThough she was minded to take her niece\'s part when Linda was so\r\nungenerously attacked by the man whom she had warmed in the bosom of\r\nher family, still she was most unwilling that Linda should triumph.\r\nHer feminine instincts prompted her to take Linda\'s part on the spur\r\nof the moment, as similar instincts had prompted Tetchen to do the\r\nsame thing; but hardly the less on that account did she feel that\r\nit was still her duty to persevere with that process of crushing by\r\nwhich all human vanity was to be pressed out of Linda\'s heart. Peter\r\nSteinmarc had misbehaved himself grossly, had appeared at that last\r\ninterview in a guise which could not have made him fascinating to any\r\nyoung woman; but on that account the merit of submitting to him would\r\nbe so much the greater. There could hardly be any moral sackcloth and\r\nashes too coarse and too bitter for the correction of a sinful mind\r\nin this world, but for the special correction of a mind sinful as\r\nLinda\'s had been, marriage with such a man as Peter Steinmarc would\r\nbe sackcloth and ashes of the most salutary kind. The objection which\r\nLinda would feel for the man would be the exact antidote to the\r\npoison with which she had been infected by the influence of the Evil\r\nOne. Madame Staubach acknowledged, when she was asked the question,\r\nthat a woman should love her husband; but she would always go on to\r\ndescribe this required love as a feeling which should spring from a\r\ndutiful submission. She was of opinion that a virtuous child would\r\nlove his parent, that a virtuous servant would love her mistress,\r\nthat a virtuous woman would love her husband, even in spite of\r\naustere severity on the part of him or her who might be in authority.\r\nWhen, therefore, Linda would refer to what had taken place in the\r\nparlour, and would ask whether it were possible that she should love\r\na man who had ill-used her so grossly, Madame Staubach would reply\r\nas though love and forgiveness were one and the same thing. It was\r\nLinda\'s duty to pardon the ill-usage and to kiss the rod that had\r\nsmitten her. "I hate him so deeply that my blood curdles at the sight\r\nof him," Linda had replied. Then Madame Staubach had prayed that her\r\nniece\'s heart might be softened, and had called upon Linda to join\r\nher in these prayers. Poor Linda had felt herself compelled to go\r\ndown upon her knees and submit herself to such prayer as well as she\r\nwas able. Could she have enfranchised her mind altogether from the\r\ntrammels of belief in her aunt\'s peculiar religion, she might have\r\nescaped from the waters which seemed from day to day to be closing\r\nover her head; but this was not within her power. She asked herself\r\nno questions as to the truth of these convictions. The doctrine had\r\nbeen taught to her from her youth upwards, and she had not realised\r\nthe fact that she possessed any power of rejecting it. She would\r\ntell herself, and that frequently, that to her religion held out no\r\ncomfort, that she was not of the elect, that manifestly she was a\r\ncastaway, and that therefore there could be no reason why she should\r\nendure unnecessary torments in this life. With such impressions on\r\nher mind she had suffered herself to be taken from her aunt\'s house,\r\nand carried off by her lover to Augsburg. With such impressions\r\nstrong upon her, she would not hesitate to declare her hatred for\r\nthe man, whom, in truth, she hated with all her heart, but whom,\r\nnevertheless, she thought it was wicked to hate. She daily told\r\nherself that she was one given up by herself to Satan. But yet, when\r\nsummoned to her aunt\'s prayers, when asked to kneel and implore her\r\nLord and Saviour to soften her own heart,--so to soften it that she\r\nmight become a submissive wife to Peter Steinmarc,--she would comply,\r\nbecause she still believed that such were the sacrifices which a true\r\nreligion demanded. But there was no comfort to her in her religion.\r\nAlas! alas! let her turn herself which way she might, there was no\r\ncomfort to be found on any side.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first week in February no renewed promise of assent\r\nhad been extracted from Linda; but Peter, who was made of stuff less\r\nstern, had been gradually brought round to see that he had been\r\nwrong. Madame Staubach had, in the first instance, obtained the\r\nco-operation of Herr Molk and others of the leading city magistrates.\r\nThe question of Linda\'s marriage had become quite a city matter. She\r\nhad been indiscreet; that was acknowledged. As to the amount of her\r\nindiscretion, different people had different opinions. In the opinion\r\nof Herr Molk, that was a thing that did not signify. Linda Tressel\r\nwas the daughter of a city officer who had been much respected. Her\r\nfather\'s successor in that office was just the man who ought to be\r\nher husband. Of course he was a little old and rusty; but then Linda\r\nhad been indiscreet. Linda had not only been indiscreet, but her\r\nindiscretion had been, so to say, very public. She had run away from\r\nthe city in the middle of the night with a young man,--with a young\r\nman known to be a scamp and a rebel. It must be acknowledged that\r\nindiscretion could hardly go beyond this. But then was there not\r\nthe red house to make things even, and was it not acknowledged on\r\nall sides that Peter Steinmarc was very rusty?--The magistrates\r\nhad made up their minds that the bargain was a just one, and as it\r\nhad been made, they thought that it should be carried out. When\r\nPeter complained of further indiscretion on the part of Linda, and\r\npointed out that he was manifestly absolved from his contract by\r\nher continued misconduct, Herr Molk went to work with most demure\r\ndiligence, collected all the evidence, examined all the parties,\r\nand explained to Peter that Linda had not misbehaved herself since\r\nthe contract had last been ratified. "Peter, my friend," said the\r\nburgomaster, "you have no right to go back to anything,--to anything\r\nthat happened before the twenty-third." The twenty-third was the day\r\non which Peter had expressed his pardon for the great indiscretion\r\nof the elopement. "Since that time there has been no breach of trust\r\non her part. I have examined all the parties, Peter." It was in vain\r\nthat Steinmarc tried to show that he was entitled to be absolved\r\nbecause Linda had said that she hated him. Herr Molk did not lose\r\nabove an hour or two in explaining to him that little amenities of\r\nthat kind were to be held as compensated in full by the possession\r\nof the red house. And then, had it not been acknowledged that he was\r\nvery rusty,--a man naturally to be hated by a young woman who had\r\nshown that she had a preference for a young lover? "Oh, bah!" said\r\nHerr Molk, almost angry at this folly; "do not let me hear anything\r\nmore about that, Peter." Steinmarc had been convinced, had assented,\r\nand was now ready to accept the hand of his bride.\r\n\r\nNothing more had been heard of Ludovic since the day on which he\r\nhad come to the house and had disappeared. Herr Molk, when he was\r\ninterrogated on the subject, would shake his head, but in truth Herr\r\nMolk knew nothing. It was the fact that Valcarm, after being confined\r\nin prison at Augsburg for three days, had been discharged by the\r\ncity magistrates; and it was the case, also, though the fact was not\r\ngenerally known, that the city magistrates of Augsburg had declared\r\nthe city magistrates of Nuremberg to be--geese. Ludovic Valcarm\r\nwas not now in prison, but he had left Nuremberg, and no one knew\r\nwhither he was gone. The brewers, Sach, by whom he had been employed,\r\nprofessed that they knew nothing respecting him; but then, as Herr\r\nMolk declared, the two brothers Sach were men who ought themselves to\r\nbe in prison. They, too, were rebels, according to Herr Molk.\r\n\r\nBut in truth, as regarded Linda, no trouble need have been taken in\r\ninquiring after Ludovic. She made no inquiry respecting him. She\r\nwould not even listen to Tetchen when Tetchen would suggest this or\r\nthat mode of ascertaining where he might be. She had allowed herself\r\nto be reconciled to Tetchen, because Tetchen had taken her part\r\nagainst Peter Steinmarc; but she would submit to no intrigue at the\r\nold woman\'s instance. "I do not want to see him ever again, Tetchen."\r\n\r\n"But, fraulein, you loved him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I do. But of what use is such love? I could do him no good.\r\nIf he were there, opposite,--where he used to be,--I would not cross\r\nthe river to him."\r\n\r\n"I hope, my dear, that it mayn\'t be so with you always, that\'s all,"\r\nTetchen had said. But Linda had no vestige of such hope at her heart.\r\nThe journey to Augsburg had been to her the cause of too much agony,\r\nhad filled her with too real a sense of maidenly shame, to enable her\r\nto look forward with hope to any adventure in which Ludovic should\r\nhave to take a part. To escape from Peter Steinmarc, whether by\r\ndeath, or illness, or flight, or sullen refusal,--but to escape from\r\nhim let the cost to herself be what it might,--that was all that she\r\nnow desired. But she thought that escape was not possible to her. She\r\nwas coming at last to believe that she would have to stand up in the\r\nchurch and give her hand. If it were so, all Nuremberg should ring\r\nwith the tragedy of their nuptials.\r\n\r\nSince Peter had returned, and expressed to Madame Staubach his\r\nwillingness to go on with the marriage, he had, after a fashion, been\r\nagain taken into that lady\'s favour. He had behaved very badly, but a\r\nfault repented was a fault to be forgiven. "I am sorry that there was\r\na rumpus, Madame Staubach," he had said, "but you see that there is\r\nso much to put a man\'s back up when a girl runs away with a man in\r\nthe middle of the night, you know."\r\n\r\n"Peter," the widow had replied, interrupting him, "that need not be\r\ndiscussed again. The wickedness of the human heart is so deep that\r\nit cannot be fathomed; but we have the word of the Lord to show to\r\nus that no sinner is too vile to be forgiven. What you said in your\r\nanger was cruel and unmanly, but it has been pardoned." Then Peter\r\nsat down and lighted his pipe. He did not like the tone of his\r\nfriend\'s remarks, but he knew well that there was nothing to be\r\ngained by discussing such matters with Madame Staubach. It was better\r\nfor him to take his old seat quietly, and at once to light his pipe.\r\nLinda, on that occasion, and on many others subsequently, came and\r\nsat in the room, and there would be almost absolute silence. There\r\nmight be a question asked about the household, and Linda would answer\r\nit; or Peter might remark that such a one among the small city\r\ndealers had been fined before the magistrates for some petty breach\r\nof the city\'s laws. But of conversation there was none, and Peter\r\nnever on these evenings addressed himself specially to Linda. It was\r\nquite understood that she was to undergo persuasion, not from Peter,\r\nbut from her aunt.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of February her aunt made her last attack on poor\r\nLinda. For days before something had been said daily; some word had\r\nbeen spoken in which Madame Staubach alluded to the match as an\r\naffair which would certainly be brought about sooner or later. And\r\nthere were prayers daily for the softening of Linda\'s heart. And it\r\nwas understood that every one in the house was supposed to be living\r\nunder some special cloud of God\'s anger till Linda\'s consent should\r\nhave been given. Madame Staubach had declared during the ecstasy of\r\nher devotion, that not only she herself, but even Tetchen also, would\r\nbecome the prey of Satan if Linda did not relent. Linda had almost\r\nacknowledged to herself that she was in the act of bringing eternal\r\ndestruction on all those around her by her obstinacy. Oh, if she\r\ncould only herself be dead, let the eternal consequences as they\r\nregarded herself alone be what they might!\r\n\r\n"Linda," said her aunt, "is it not time at length that you should\r\ngive us an answer?"\r\n\r\n"An answer, aunt Charlotte?" As if she had not given a sufficiency of\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\n"Do you not see how others suffer because of your obstinacy?"\r\n\r\n"It is not my doing."\r\n\r\n"It is your doing. Do not allow any such thought as that to get into\r\nyour mind, and assist the Devil in closing the door of your heart.\r\nThey who are your friends are bound to you, and cannot separate\r\nthemselves from you."\r\n\r\n"Who are my friends?"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry you should ask that question, Linda."\r\n\r\n"I have no friends."\r\n\r\n"Linda, that is ungrateful to God, and thankless. I say nothing of\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"You are my friend, but no one else."\r\n\r\n"Herr Molk is your friend, and has shown himself to be so. Jacob\r\nHeisse is your friend." He, too, using such wisdom as he possessed,\r\nhad recommended Linda to take the husband provided for her. "Peter\r\nSteinmarc is your friend."\r\n\r\n"No, he is not," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"That is very wicked,--heinously wicked." Whereupon Madame Staubach\r\nwent towards the door for the purpose of bolting it, and Linda\r\nknew that this was preparatory to a prayer. Linda felt that it was\r\nimpossible that she should fall on her knees and attempt to pray at\r\nthis moment. What was the use of it? Sooner or later she must yield.\r\nShe had no weapon with which to carry on the battle, whereas her aunt\r\nwas always armed.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Charlotte," she said, suddenly, "I will do what you want,--only\r\nnot now; not quite yet. Let there be time for me to make myself ready\r\nfor it."\r\n\r\nThe dreaded visitation of that special prayer was at any rate\r\narrested, and Madame Staubach graciously accepted Linda\'s assent as\r\nsufficient quittance at any rate for the evil words that had been\r\nspoken on that occasion. She was too wise to demand a more gracious\r\nacquiescence, and did not say a word then even in opposition to the\r\nearnest request which had been made for delay. She kissed her niece,\r\nand rejoiced as the woman rejoiced who had swept diligently and had\r\nfound her lost piece. If Linda would at last take the right path, all\r\nformer deviations from it should be as nothing. And Madame Staubach\r\nhalf-trusted, almost thought, that it could not be but that her\r\nown prayers should prevail at last. Linda indeed had twice before\r\nassented, and had twice retracted her word. But there had been\r\ncauses. The young man had come and had prevailed, who surely would\r\nnot come again, and who surely, if coming, would not prevail. And\r\nthen Peter himself had misbehaved. It must now be Madame Staubach\'s\r\ncare that there should arise no further stumbling-block. There were\r\nbut two modes of taking this care at her disposal. She could watch\r\nLinda all the day, and she could reiterate her prayers with renewed\r\ndiligence. On neither point would she be found lacking.\r\n\r\n"And when shall be the happy day?" said Peter. On the occasion of\r\nhis visit to the parlour subsequent to the scene which has just been\r\ndescribed, Madame Staubach left the room for a while so that the two\r\nlovers might be together. Peter had been warned that it would be so,\r\nand had prepared, no doubt, his little speech.\r\n\r\n"There will be no happy day," said Linda.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I do say it. There will be no happy day for you or for me."\r\n\r\n"But we must fix a day, you know," said Peter.\r\n\r\n"I will arrange it with my aunt." Then Linda got up and left the\r\nroom. Peter Steinmarc attempted no further conversation with her, nor\r\ndid Madame Staubach again endeavour to create any intercourse between\r\nthem. It must come after marriage. It was clearly to her God\'s will\r\nthat these two people should be married, and she could not but be\r\nright to leave the result to His wisdom. A day was named. With a\r\nsimple nod of her head Linda agreed that she would become Peter\'s\r\nwife on the fifteenth of March; and she received visits from Herr\r\nMolk and from Jacob Heisse to congratulate her on her coming\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout February Linda never flinched. She hardly spoke at\r\nall except on matters of household business, but to them she was\r\nsedulously attentive. She herself insisted on understanding what\r\nlegal arrangement was made about the house, and would not consent\r\nto sign the necessary document preparatory to her marriage till\r\nthere was inserted in it a clause giving to her aunt a certain\r\nlife-interest in the property in the event either of her marriage or\r\nof her death. Peter did his best to oppose this, as did also Madame\r\nStaubach herself; but Linda prevailed, and the clause was there. "She\r\nwould have to live with you whether or no," said Herr Molk to the\r\ntown-clerk. "You couldn\'t turn the woman out into the street." But\r\nPeter had wished to be master of his own house, and would not give\r\nup the point till much eloquence and authority had been used. He had\r\ncome to wish with all his heart that he had never seen Linda Tressel\r\nor the red house; but he had gone so far that he could not retract.\r\nLinda never flinched, never uttered a word of complaint; sat silent\r\nwhile Peter was smoking, and awaited her doom. Once her aunt spoke\r\nto her about her feelings as a bride. "You do love him, do you not,\r\nLinda?" said Madame Staubach. "I do not love him," Linda had replied.\r\nThen Madame Staubach dared to ask no further question, but prayed\r\nthat the necessary affection might be given.\r\n\r\nThere were various things to be bought, and money for the purpose was\r\nin a moderate degree forthcoming. Madame Staubach possessed a small\r\nhoard, which was now to be spent, and something she raised on her own\r\nlittle property. A portion of this was intrusted wholly to Linda, and\r\nshe exercised care and discretion in its disposition. Linen for the\r\nhouse she purchased, and things needed for the rooms and the kitchen.\r\nBut she would expend nothing in clothes for herself. When pressed on\r\nthe subject by her aunt, she declared that her marriage would be one\r\nthat required no finery. Her own condition and that of her proposed\r\nhusband, she said, made it quite unnecessary. When she was told that\r\nSteinmarc would be offended by such exaggerated simplicity, she\r\nturned upon her aunt with such a look of scorn that Madame Staubach\r\ndid not dare to say another word. Indeed at this time Madame Staubach\r\nhad become almost afraid of her niece, and would sit watching the\r\nsilent stern industry of the younger woman with something of awe.\r\nCould it be that there ever came over her heart a shock of regret for\r\nthe thing she was doing? Was it possible that she should already be\r\nfeeling remorse? If it was so with her, she turned herself to prayer,\r\nand believed that the Lord told her that she was right.\r\n\r\nBut there were others who watched, and spoke among themselves, and\r\nfelt that the silent solemnity of Linda\'s mode of life was a cause\r\nfor trembling. Max Bogen\'s wife had come to her father\'s house, and\r\nhad seen Linda, and had talked to Tetchen, and had said at home that\r\nLinda was--mad. Her father had become frightened, and had refused to\r\ntake any part in the matter. He acknowledged that he had given his\r\nadvice in favour of the marriage, but he had done this merely as a\r\nmatter of course,--to oblige his neighbour, Madame Staubach. He would\r\nhave nothing more to do with it. When Fanny told him that she feared\r\nthat Linda would lose her senses, he went into his workshop and\r\nbusied himself with a great chair. But Tetchen was not so reticent.\r\nTetchen said much to Madame Staubach;--so much that the unfortunate\r\nwidow was nearly always on her knees, asking for help, asking in very\r\ntruth for new gifts of obstinate persistency; and Tetchen also said\r\nmuch to Fanny Bogen.\r\n\r\n"But what can we do, Tetchen?" asked Fanny.\r\n\r\n"If I had my will," said Tetchen, "I would so handle him that he\r\nwould be glad enough to be off his bargain. But you\'ll see they\'ll\r\nnever live together as man and wife,--never for a day."\r\n\r\nThey who said that Linda was mad at this time were probably\r\nhalf-right; but if so, her madness had shown itself in none of those\r\nforms which are held to justify interference by authority. There was\r\nno one in Nuremberg who could lock a woman up because she was silent;\r\nor could declare her to be unfit for marriage because she refused to\r\nbuy wedding clothes. The marriage must go on. Linda herself felt that\r\nit must be accomplished. Her silence and her sternness were not now\r\nconsciously used by her as means of opposing or delaying the coming\r\nceremony, but simply betrayed the state of mind to which she was\r\nreduced. She counted the days and she counted the hours as a criminal\r\ncounts them who sits in his cell and waits for the executioner. She\r\nknew, she thought she knew, that she would stand in the church and\r\nhave her hand put into that of Peter Steinmarc; but what might happen\r\nafter that she did not know.\r\n\r\nShe would stand at the altar and have her hand put into that of Peter\r\nSteinmarc, and she would be called his wife in sight of God and\r\nman. She spent hours in solitude attempting to realise the position\r\nwith all its horrors. She never devoted a minute to the task of\r\nreconciling herself to it. She did not make one slightest endeavour\r\ntowards teaching herself that after all it might be possible for her\r\nto live with the man as his companion in peace and quietness. She\r\nhated him with all the vigour of her heart, and she would hate him to\r\nthe end. On that subject no advice, no prayer, no grace from heaven,\r\ncould be of service to her. Satan, with all the horrors of hell, as\r\nthey had been described to her, was preferable to the companionship\r\nof Peter Steinmarc. And yet she went on without flinching.\r\n\r\nShe went on without flinching till the night of the tenth of March.\r\nUp to that time, from the day on which she had last consented to her\r\nmartyrdom, no idea of escape had occurred to her. As she left her\r\naunt on that evening, Madame Staubach spoke to her. "You should at\r\nany rate pray for him," said Madame Staubach. "I hope that you pray\r\nthat this marriage may be for his welfare." How could she pray for\r\nhim? And how could she utter such a prayer as that? But she tried;\r\nand as she tried, she reflected that the curse to him would be as\r\ngreat as it was to her. Not only was she to be sacrificed, but the\r\nmiserable man was bringing himself also to utter wretchedness. Unless\r\nshe could die, there would be no escape for him, as also there would\r\nbe none for her. That she should speak to him, touch him, hold\r\nintercourse with him, was, she now told herself, out of the question.\r\nShe might be his servant, if he would allow her to be so at a\r\ndistance, but nothing more. Or it might be possible that she should\r\nbe his murderess! A woman who has been taught by her religion that\r\nshe is and must be a child of the Evil One, may become guilty of what\r\nmost terrible crime you please without much increase of damage to her\r\nown cause,--without much damage according to her own views of life\r\nand death. Linda, as she thought of it in her own chamber, with her\r\neyes wide open, looking into the dark night from out of her window,\r\ndeclared to herself that in certain circumstances she would certainly\r\nattempt to kill him. She shuddered and shook till she almost fell\r\nfrom her chair. Come what might, she would not endure the pressure of\r\nhis caress.\r\n\r\nThen she got up and resolved that she would even yet make one other\r\nstruggle to escape. It would not be true of her to say that at this\r\nmoment she was mad, but the mixed excitement and terror of her\r\nposition as she was waiting her doom, joined to her fears, her\r\ndoubts, and, worse than all, her certainties as to her condition in\r\nthe sight of God, had almost unstrung her mind. She had almost come\r\nto believe that the world was at its end, and that the punishment of\r\nwhich she had heard so much was already upon her. "If this is to be a\r\ndoom for ever," she said to herself, "the God I have striven to love\r\nis very cruel." But then there came an exercise of reason which told\r\nher that it could not be a doom for ever. It was clear to her that\r\nthere was much as yet within her own power which could certainly not\r\nbe so in that abode of the unblessed to which she was to be summoned.\r\nThere was the window before her, with the silent river running below;\r\nand she knew that she could throw herself from it if she chose to put\r\nforth the power which she still possessed. She felt that "she herself\r\nmight her quietus make with a bare bodkin." Why should she\r\n\r\n\r\n                           "Fardels bear,\r\n   To grunt and sweat under a weary life,\r\n   But that the dread of something after life,\r\n   The undiscovered country from whose bourne\r\n   No traveller returns, puzzles the will,\r\n   And makes us rather bear those ills we have\r\n   Than fly to others that we know not of."\r\n\r\n\r\nLinda knew nothing of Hamlet, but the thought was there, exact; and\r\nthe knowledge that some sort of choice was still open to her, if it\r\nwere only the choice of sending herself at once to a world different\r\nfrom this, a world in which Peter Steinmarc would not be the avenger\r\nof her life\'s wickedness, made her aware that even yet something\r\nmight be done.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning she was in the kitchen, as was usual with\r\nher now, at an early hour, and made the coffee for her aunt\'s\r\nbreakfast, and for Peter\'s. Tetchen was there also, and to Tetchen\r\nshe spoke a word or two in good humour. Tetchen said afterwards that\r\nshe knew that something was to happen, because Linda\'s manner to her\r\nhad been completely changed that morning. She sat down with her aunt\r\nat eight, and ate a morsel of bread, and endeavoured to swallow her\r\ncoffee. She was thinking at the time that it might be the case that\r\nshe would never see her aunt again. All the suffering that she had\r\nendured at Madame Staubach\'s hands had never quenched her love.\r\nMiserable as she had been made by the manner in which this woman had\r\nexecuted the trust which circumstances had placed in her hands, Linda\r\nhad hardly blamed her aunt even within her own bosom. When with a\r\nfrenzy of agony Madame Staubach would repeat prayer after prayer,\r\nextending her hands towards heaven, and seeking to obtain that which\r\nshe desired by the painful intensity of her own faith, it had never\r\noccurred to Linda that in such proceedings she was ill-treated by\r\nher aunt. Her aunt, she thought, had ever shown to her all that love\r\nwhich a mother has for her child, and Linda in her misery was never\r\nungrateful. As soon as the meal was finished she put on her hat and\r\ncloak, which she had brought down from her room, and then kissed her\r\naunt.\r\n\r\n"God bless you, my child," said Madame Staubach, "and enable you to\r\nbe an affectionate and dutiful wife to your husband." Then Linda went\r\nforth from the room and from the house, and as she went she cast her\r\neyes around, thinking that it might be possible that she should never\r\nsee them again.\r\n\r\nLinda told no lie as she left her aunt, but she felt that she was\r\nacting a lie. It had been arranged between them, before she had\r\nentertained this thought of escaping from Nuremberg, that she should\r\non this morning go out by herself and make certain purchases. In\r\nspite of the things that had been done, of Valcarm\'s visit to the\r\nupper storeys of the house, of the flight to Augsburg, of Linda\'s\r\nlong protracted obstinacy and persistently expressed hatred for the\r\nman who was to be her husband, Madame Staubach still trusted her\r\nniece. She trusted Linda perhaps the more at this time from a feeling\r\nthat she had exacted so much from the girl. When, therefore, Linda\r\nkissed her and went out, she had no suspicion on her mind; nor was\r\nany aroused till the usual dinner-hour was passed, and Linda was\r\nstill absent. When Tetchen at one o\'clock said something of her\r\nwonder that the fraulein had not returned, Madame Staubach had\r\nsuggested that she might be with her friend Herr Molk. Tetchen knew\r\nwhat was the warmth of that friendship, and thought that such a visit\r\nwas not probable. At three o\'clock the postman brought a letter\r\nwhich Linda herself had dropped into the box of the post-office\r\nthat morning, soon after leaving the house. She had known when,\r\nin ordinary course, it would be delivered. Should it lead by any\r\nmisfortune to her discovery before she could escape, that she could\r\nnot help. Even that, accompanied by her capture, would be as good a\r\nmode as any other of telling her aunt the truth. The letter was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Thursday Night.\r\n\r\n   DEAREST AUNT,--I think you hardly know what are my\r\n   sufferings. I truly believe that I have deserved them, but\r\n   nevertheless they are insupportable. I cannot marry Peter\r\n   Steinmarc. I have tried it, and cannot. The day is very\r\n   near now; but were it to come nearer, I should go mad, or I\r\n   should kill myself. I think that you do not know what the\r\n   feeling is that has made me the most wretched of women since\r\n   this marriage was first proposed to me. I shall go away\r\n   to-morrow, and shall try to get to my uncle\'s house in\r\n   Cologne. It is a long way off, and perhaps I shall never get\r\n   there: but if I am to die on the road, oh, how much better\r\n   will that be! I do not want to live. I have made you\r\n   unhappy, and everybody unhappy, but I do not think that\r\n   anybody has been so unhappy as I am. I shall give you\r\n   a kiss as I go out, and you will think that it was the\r\n   kiss of Judas; but I am not a Judas in my heart. Dear\r\n   aunt Charlotte, I would have borne it if I could,--Your\r\n   affectionate, but undutiful niece,\r\n\r\n   LINDA TRESSEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nUndutiful! So she called herself; but had she not, in truth, paid\r\nduty to her aunt beyond that which one human being can in any case\r\nowe to another? Are we to believe that the very soul of the offspring\r\nis to be at the disposition of the parent? Poor Linda! Madame\r\nStaubach, when the letter was handed to her by Tetchen, sat aghast\r\nfor a while, motionless, with her hands before her. "She is off\r\nagain, I suppose," said Tetchen.\r\n\r\n"Yes; she has gone."\r\n\r\n"It serves you right. I say it now, and I will say it. Why was she so\r\ndriven?" Madame Staubach said never a word. Could she have had Linda\r\nback at the instant, just now, at this very moment, she would have\r\nyielded. It was beginning to become apparent to her that God did not\r\nintend that her prayers should be successful. Doubtless the fault was\r\nwith herself. She had lacked faith. Then as she sat there she began\r\nto reflect that it might be that she herself was not of the elect.\r\nWhat if, after all, she had been wrong throughout! "Is anything to be\r\ndone?" said Tetchen, who was still standing by her side.\r\n\r\n"What ought I to do, Tetchen?"\r\n\r\n"Wring Peter Steinmarc\'s neck," said Tetchen. "That would be the best\r\nthing." Even this did not bring forth an angry retort from Madame\r\nStaubach. About an hour after that Peter came in. He had already\r\nheard that the bird had flown. Some messenger from Jacob Heisse\'s\r\nhouse had brought him the tidings to the town-hall.\r\n\r\n"What is this?" said he. "What is this? She has gone again."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Tetchen, "she has gone again. What did you expect?"\r\n\r\n"And Ludovic Valcarm is with her?"\r\n\r\n"Ludovic Valcarm is not with her!" said Madame Staubach, with an\r\nexpression of wrath which made him start a foot back from where he\r\nstood.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he exclaimed, when he had recovered himself, and reflected that\r\nhe had no cause for fear, "she is no better than she should be."\r\n\r\n"She is ten times too good for you. That is all that is the matter\r\nwith her," said Tetchen.\r\n\r\n"I have done with her,--have done with her altogether," said Peter,\r\nrubbing his hands together.\r\n\r\n"I should think you have," said Tetchen.\r\n\r\n"Tell him to leave me," said Madame Staubach, waving Peter away with\r\nher hand. Then Tetchen took the town-clerk by his arm, and led him\r\nsomewhat roughly out of the room. So he shall disappear from our\r\nsight. No reader will now require to be told that he did not become\r\nthe husband of Linda Tressel.\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach did nothing and said nothing further on the matter\r\nthat night. Tetchen indeed went up to the railway station, and found\r\nthat Linda had taken a ticket through to Mannheim, and had asked\r\nquestions there, openly, in reference to the boats from thence down\r\nthe Rhine. She had with her money sufficient to take her to Cologne,\r\nand her aunt endeavoured to comfort herself with thinking that no\r\nfurther evil would come of this journey than the cost, and the\r\nrumours it would furnish. As to Peter Steinmarc, that was now all\r\nover. If Linda would return, no further attempt should be made.\r\nTetchen said nothing on the subject, but she herself was by no means\r\nsure that Linda had no partner in her escape. To Tetchen\'s mind it\r\nwas so natural that there should be a partner.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning Madame Staubach was closeted with\r\nHerr Molk in the panelled chamber of the house in the Egidien Platz,\r\nseeking advice. "Gone again, is she?" said Herr Molk, holding up his\r\nhand. "And that fellow is with her of course?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no!" exclaimed Madame Staubach.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure of that! At any rate she must marry him now, for nobody\r\nelse will take her. Peter won\'t bite again at that bait." Then Madame\r\nStaubach was compelled to explain that all ideas of matrimony in\r\nrespect to her niece must be laid aside, and she was driven also\r\nto confess that she had persevered too long in regard to Peter\r\nSteinmarc. "He certainly is a little rusty for such a young woman\r\nas Linda," said Herr Molk, confessing also his part of the fault.\r\nAt last he counselled Madame Staubach that she could do nothing\r\nbut follow her niece to Cologne, as she had before followed her to\r\nAugsburg. Such a journey would be very terrible to her. She had not\r\nbeen in Cologne for years, and did not wish to see again those who\r\nwere there. But she felt that she had no alternative, and she went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nFor very many years no connection had been maintained between the two\r\nwomen who lived together in Nuremberg, and their nearest relative,\r\nwho was a half-brother of Madame Staubach\'s, a lawyer, living in\r\nCologne. This uncle of Linda\'s was a Roman Catholic, and had on this\r\naccount been shunned by Madame Staubach. Some slight intercourse\r\nthere had been on matters of business, and thus it had come to pass\r\nthat Linda knew the address of her uncle. But this was all that she\r\nknew, and knowing this only, she had started for Cologne. The reader\r\nwill hardly require to be told that she had not gone in company with\r\nhim who a few weeks since had been her lover. The reader, perhaps,\r\nwill have understood Linda\'s character so thoroughly as to be\r\nconvinced that, though she had submitted to be dragged out of her\r\nwindow by her lover, and carried away to Augsburg in the night,\r\nstill it was not probable that she should again be guilty of such\r\nindiscretion as that. The lesson had not been in vain. If there be\r\nany reader who does not know Linda\'s character better than it was\r\nknown to Herr Molk, or even to Tetchen, this story has been told\r\nin vain. All alone she started, and all alone she made the entire\r\njourney. Long as it was, there was no rest for her on the way. She\r\nwent by a cheap and slow train, and on she went through the long day\r\nand the long night, and on through the long day again. She did not\r\nsuffer with the cold as she had suffered on that journey to Augsburg,\r\nbut the weariness of the hours was very great, and the continuation\r\nof the motion oppressed her sorely. Then joined to this suffering was\r\nthe feeling that she was going to a strange world in which no one\r\nwould receive her kindly. She had money to take her to Cologne, but\r\nshe would have none to bring her back again. It seemed to her as she\r\nwent that there could be no prospect to her returning to a home which\r\nshe had disgraced so thoroughly.\r\n\r\nAt Mannheim she found that she was obliged to wait over four hours\r\nbefore the boat started. She quitted the railway a little after\r\nmidnight, and she was told that she was to be on board before five\r\nin the morning. The night was piercing cold, though never so cold\r\nas had been that other night; and she was dismayed at the thought\r\nof wandering about in that desolate town. Some one, however, had\r\ncompassion on her, and she was taken to a small inn, in which she\r\nrested on a bed without removing her clothes. When she rose in the\r\nmorning, she walked down to the boat without a word of complaint, but\r\nshe found that her limbs were hardly able to carry her. An idea came\r\nacross her mind that if the people saw that she was ill they would\r\nnot take her upon the boat. She crawled on, and took her place among\r\nthe poorer passengers before the funnels. For a considerable time no\r\none noticed her, as she sat shivering in the cold morning air on a\r\ndamp bench. At last a market-woman going down to Mayence asked her a\r\nquestion. Was she ill? Before they had reached Mayence she had told\r\nher whole story to the market-woman. "May God temper the wind for\r\nthee, my shorn lamb!" said the market-woman to Linda, as she left\r\nher; "for it seems that thou hast been shorn very close." By this\r\ntime, with the assistance of the woman, she had found a place below\r\nin which she could lie down, and there she remained till she learned\r\nthat the boat had reached Cologne. Some one in authority on board\r\nthe vessel had been told that she was ill; and as they had reached\r\nCologne also at night, she was allowed to remain on board till\r\nthe next morning. With the early dawn she was astir, and the full\r\ndaylight of the March morning was hardly perfect in the heavens when\r\nshe found herself standing before the door of a house in the city, to\r\nwhich she had been brought as being the residence of her uncle.\r\n\r\nShe was now, in truth, so weak and ill that she could hardly stand.\r\nHer clothes had not been off her back since she left Nuremberg, nor\r\nhad she come prepared with any change of raiment. A woman more\r\nwretched, more disconsolate, on whose shoulders the troubles of\r\nthis world lay heavier, never stood at an honest man\'s door to beg\r\nadmittance. If only she might have died as she crawled through the\r\nstreets!\r\n\r\nBut there she was, and she must make some petition that the door\r\nmight be opened for her. She had come all the way from Nuremberg to\r\nthis spot, thinking it possible that in this spot alone she might\r\nreceive succour; and now she stood there, fearing to raise the\r\nknocker on the door. She was a lamb indeed, whose fleece had been\r\nshorn very close; and the shearing had been done all in the sacred\r\nname of religion! It had been thought necessary that the vile desires\r\nof her human heart should be crushed within her bosom, and the\r\ncrushing had brought her to this. She looked up in her desolation at\r\nthe front of the house. It was a white, large house, as belonging to\r\na moderately prosperous citizen, with two windows on each side of the\r\ndoor, and five above, and then others again above them. But there\r\nseemed to be no motion within it, nor was there any one stirring\r\nalong the street. Would it not be better, she thought, that she\r\nshould sit for a while and wait upon the door-step? Who has not known\r\nthat frame of mind in which any postponement of the thing dreaded is\r\nacceptable?\r\n\r\nBut Linda\'s power of postponement was very short. She had hardly\r\nsunk on to the step, when the door was opened, and the necessity for\r\nexplaining herself came upon her. Slowly and with pain she dragged\r\nherself on to her feet, and told the suspicious servant, who stood\r\nfilling the aperture of the doorway, that her name was Linda Tressel,\r\nand that she had come from Nuremberg. She had come from the house of\r\nMadame Staubach at Nuremberg. Would the servant be kind enough to\r\ntell Herr Gr\xfcner that Linda Tressel, from Madame Staubach\'s house in\r\nNuremberg, was at his door? She claimed no kindred then, feeling that\r\nthe woman might take such claim as a disgrace to her master. When she\r\nwas asked to call again later, she looked piteously into the woman\'s\r\nface, and said that she feared she was too ill to walk away.\r\n\r\nBefore the morning was over she was in bed, and her uncle\'s wife was\r\nat her bedside, and there had been fair-haired cousins in her room,\r\ncreeping in to gaze at her with their soft blue eyes, touching her\r\nwith their young soft hands, and calling her Cousin Linda with their\r\nsoft voices. It seemed to her that she could have died happily, so\r\nhappily, then, if only they might have been allowed to stand round\r\nher bed, and still to whisper and still to touch her. But they had\r\nbeen told that they might only just see their new cousin and then\r\ndepart,--because the new cousin was ill. The servant at the front\r\ndoor had doubted her, as it is the duty of servants to doubt in such\r\ncases; but her uncle had not doubted, and her uncle\'s wife, when she\r\nheard the story, wept over her, and told her that she should be at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nLinda told her story from the first to the last. She told\r\neverything,--her hatred for the one man, her love for the other; her\r\njourney to Augsburg. "Ah, dear, dear, dear," said aunt Gr\xfcner when\r\nthis was told to her. "I know how wicked I have been," said Linda,\r\nsorrowing. "I do not say that you have been wicked, my dear, but you\r\nhave been unfortunate," said aunt Gr\xfcner. And then Linda went on to\r\ntell her, as the day so much dreaded by her drew nearer and nearer,\r\nas she came to be aware that, let her make what effort she would, she\r\ncould not bring herself to be the man\'s wife,--that the horror of it\r\nwas too powerful for her,--she resolved at the last moment that she\r\nwould seek the only other relative in the world of whom she knew even\r\nthe name. Her aunt Gr\xfcner thoroughly commended her for this, saying,\r\nhowever, that it would have been much better that she should have\r\nmade the journey at some period earlier in her troubles. "Aunt\r\nCharlotte does not seem to be a very nice sort of woman to live\r\nwith," said aunt Gr\xfcner. Then Linda, with what strength she could,\r\ntook Madame Staubach\'s part. "She always thought that she was doing\r\nright," said Linda, solemnly. "Ah, that comes of her religion," said\r\naunt Gr\xfcner. "We think differently, my dear. Thank God, we have got\r\nsomebody to tell us what we ought to do and what we ought not to do."\r\nLinda was not strong enough to argue the question, or to remind her\r\naunt that this somebody, too, might possibly be wrong.\r\n\r\nLinda Tressel was now happier than she had remembered herself to\r\nhave been since she was a child, though ill, so that the doctor who\r\ncame to visit her could only shake his head and speak in whispers\r\nto aunt Gr\xfcner. Linda herself, perceiving how it was with the\r\ndoctor,--knowing that there were whispers though she did not hear\r\nthem, and shakings of the head though she did not see them,--told her\r\naunt with a smile that she was contented to die. Her utmost hope, the\r\nextent of her wishes, had been to escape from the extremity of misery\r\nto which she had been doomed. She had thought often, she said, as she\r\nhad been making that journey, that her strength would not serve her\r\nto reach the house of her relative. "God," she said, "had been very\r\ngood to her, and she was now contented to go."\r\n\r\nMadame Staubach arrived at Cologne four days after her niece, and was\r\nalso welcomed at her brother\'s house. But the welcome accorded to\r\nher was not that which had been given to Linda. "She has been driven\r\nvery nearly to death\'s door among you," said the one aunt to the\r\nother. To Linda Madame Staubach was willing to own that she had been\r\nwrong, but she could make no such acknowledgment to the wife of her\r\nhalf-brother,--to a benighted Papist. "I have endeavoured to do my\r\nduty by my niece," said Madame Staubach, "asking the Lord daily to\r\nshow me the way." "Pshaw!" said the other woman. "Your always asking\r\nthe way, and never knowing it, will end in her death. She will have\r\nbeen murdered by your prayers." This was very terrible, but for\r\nLinda\'s sake it was borne.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing of reproach either from Linda to her aunt or from\r\nMadame Staubach to her niece, nor was the name of Peter Steinmarc\r\nmentioned between them for many days. It was, indeed, mentioned but\r\nonce again by poor Linda Tressel. For some weeks, for nearly a month,\r\nthey all remained in the house of Herr Gr\xfcner, and then Linda was\r\nremoved to apartments in Cologne, in which all her earthly troubles\r\nwere brought to a close. She never saw Nuremberg again, or Tetchen,\r\nwho had been faithful at least to her, nor did she ever even ask the\r\nfate of Ludovic Valcarm. His name Madame Staubach never dared to\r\nmention; and Linda was silent, thinking always that it was a name of\r\noffence. But when she had been told that she must die,--that her days\r\nwere indeed numbered, and that no return to Nuremberg was possible\r\nfor her,--she did speak a word of Peter Steinmarc. "Tell him, aunt\r\nCharlotte, from me," she said, "that I prayed for him when I was\r\ndying, and that I forgave him. You know, aunt Charlotte, it was\r\nimpossible that I should marry him. A woman must not marry a man whom\r\nshe does not love." Madame Staubach did not venture to say a word\r\nin her own justification. She did not dare even to recur to the old\r\ntenets of her fierce religion, while Linda still lived. She was\r\ncowed, and contented herself with the offices of a nurse by the\r\nsickbed of the dying girl. She had been told by her sister-in-law\r\nthat she had murdered her niece. Who can say what were the\r\naccusations brought against her by the fury of her own conscience?\r\n\r\nEvery day the fair-haired cousins came to Linda\'s bedside, and\r\nwhispered to her with their soft voices, and looked at her with their\r\nsoft eyes, and touched her with their soft hands. Linda would kiss\r\ntheir plump arms and lean her head against them, and would find a\r\nvery paradise of happiness in this late revelation of human love. As\r\nshe lay a-dying she must have known that the world had been very hard\r\nto her, and that her aunt\'s teaching had indeed crushed her,--body as\r\nwell as spirit. But she made no complaint; and at last, when the full\r\nsummer had come, she died at Cologne in Madame Staubach\'s arms.\r\n\r\nDuring those four months at Cologne the zeal of Madame Staubach\'s\r\nreligion had been quenched, and she had been unable to use her\r\nfanaticism, even towards herself. But when she was alone in the\r\nworld the fury of her creed returned. "With faith you shall move a\r\nmountain," she would say, "but without faith you cannot live." She\r\ncould never trust her own faith, for the mountain would not be moved.\r\n\r\nA small tombstone in the Protestant burying-ground at Cologne tells\r\nthat Linda Tressel, of Nuremberg, died in that city on the 20th of\r\nJuly 1863, and that she was buried in that spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LINDA TRESSEL***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 26002-8.txt or 26002-8.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/6/0/0/26002\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
