When\r\nthis sad event happened he had ceased to be Prime Minister. During\r\nthe first nine months after he had left office he and the Duchess\r\nremained in England. Then they had gone abroad, taking with them\r\ntheir three children. The eldest, Lord Silverbridge, had been at\r\nOxford, but had had his career there cut short by some more than\r\nordinary youthful folly, which had induced his father to agree with\r\nthe college authorities that his name had better be taken off the\r\ncollege books,--all which had been cause of very great sorrow to\r\nthe Duke. The other boy was to go to Cambridge; but his father had\r\nthought it well to give him a twelvemonth\'s run on the Continent,\r\nunder his own inspection. Lady Mary, the only daughter, was the\r\nyoungest of the family, and she also had been with them on the\r\nContinent. They remained the full year abroad, travelling with a\r\nlarge accompaniment of tutors, lady\'s-maids, couriers, and sometimes\r\nfriends. I do not know that the Duchess or the Duke had enjoyed it\r\nmuch; but the young people had seen something of foreign courts and\r\nmuch of foreign scenery, and had perhaps perfected their French. The\r\nDuke had gone to work at his travels with a full determination to\r\ncreate for himself occupation out of a new kind of life. He had\r\nstudied Dante, and had striven to arouse himself to ecstatic joy\r\namidst the loveliness of the Italian lakes. But through it all he\r\nhad been aware that he had failed. The Duchess had made no such\r\nresolution,--had hardly, perhaps, made any attempt; but, in truth,\r\nthey had both sighed to be back among the war-trumpets. They had both\r\nsuffered much among the trumpets, and yet they longed to return. He\r\ntold himself from day to day, that though he had been banished from\r\nthe House of Commons, still, as a peer, he had a seat in Parliament,\r\nand that, though he was no longer a minister, still he might be\r\nuseful as a legislator. She, in her career as a leader of fashion,\r\nhad no doubt met with some trouble,--with some trouble but with no\r\ndisgrace; and as she had been carried about among the lakes and\r\nmountains, among the pictures and statues, among the counts and\r\ncountesses, she had often felt that there was no happiness except in\r\nthat dominion which circumstances had enabled her to achieve once,\r\nand might enable her to achieve again--in the realms of London\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThen, in the early spring of 187--, they came back to England, having\r\npersistently carried out their project, at any rate in regard to\r\ntime. Lord Gerald, the younger son, was at once sent up to Trinity.\r\nFor the eldest son a seat was to be found in the House of Commons,\r\nand the fact that a dissolution of Parliament was expected served to\r\nprevent any prolonged sojourn abroad. Lady Mary Palliser was at that\r\ntime nineteen, and her entrance into the world was to be her mother\'s\r\ngreat care and great delight. In March they spent a few days in\r\nLondon, and then went down to Matching Priory. When she left town the\r\nDuchess was complaining of cold, sore throat, and debility. A week\r\nafter their arrival at Matching she was dead.\r\n\r\nHad the heavens fallen and mixed themselves with the earth, had the\r\npeople of London risen in rebellion with French ideas of equality,\r\nhad the Queen persistently declined to comply with the constitutional\r\nadvice of her ministers, had a majority in the House of Commons lost\r\nits influence in the country,--the utter prostration of the bereft\r\nhusband could not have been more complete. It was not only that his\r\nheart was torn to pieces, but that he did not know how to look out\r\ninto the world. It was as though a man should be suddenly called upon\r\nto live without hands or even arms. He was helpless, and knew himself\r\nto be helpless. Hitherto he had never specially acknowledged to\r\nhimself that his wife was necessary to him as a component part of his\r\nlife. Though he had loved her dearly, and had in all things consulted\r\nher welfare and happiness, he had at times been inclined to think\r\nthat in the exuberance of her spirits she had been a trouble\r\nrather than a support to him. But now it was as though all outside\r\nappliances were taken away from him. There was no one of whom he\r\ncould ask a question.\r\n\r\nFor it may be said of this man that, though throughout his life he\r\nhad had many Honourable and Right Honourable friends, and that though\r\nhe had entertained guests by the score, and though he had achieved\r\nfor himself the respect of all good men and the thorough admiration\r\nof some few who knew him, he had hardly made for himself a single\r\nintimate friend--except that one who had now passed away from him. To\r\nher he had been able to say what he thought, even though she would\r\noccasionally ridicule him while he was declaring his feelings. But\r\nthere had been no other human soul to whom he could open himself.\r\nThere were one or two whom he loved, and perhaps liked; but his\r\nloving and his liking had been exclusively political. He had so\r\nhabituated himself to devote his mind and his heart to the service of\r\nhis country, that he had almost risen above or sunk below humanity.\r\nBut she, who had been essentially human, had been a link between him\r\nand the world.\r\n\r\nThere were his three children, the youngest of whom was now nearly\r\nnineteen, and they surely were links! At the first moment of his\r\nbereavement they were felt to be hardly more than burdens. A more\r\nloving father there was not in England, but nature had made him so\r\nundemonstrative that as yet they had hardly known his love. In all\r\ntheir joys and in all their troubles, in all their desires and all\r\ntheir disappointments, they had ever gone to their mother. She had\r\nbeen conversant with everything about them, from the boys\' bills\r\nand the girl\'s gloves to the innermost turn in the heart and the\r\ndisposition of each. She had known with the utmost accuracy the\r\nnature of the scrapes into which Lord Silverbridge had precipitated\r\nhimself, and had known also how probable it was that Lord Gerald\r\nwould do the same. The results of such scrapes she, of course,\r\ndeplored; and therefore she would give good counsel, pointing out how\r\nimperative it was that such evil-doings should be avoided; but with\r\nthe spirit that produced the scrapes she fully sympathised. The\r\nfather disliked the spirit almost worse than the results; and was\r\ntherefore often irritated and unhappy.\r\n\r\nAnd the difficulties about the girl were almost worse to bear than\r\nthose about the boys. She had done nothing wrong. She had given no\r\nsigns of extravagance or other juvenile misconduct. But she was\r\nbeautiful and young. How was he to bring her out into the world? How\r\nwas he to decide whom she should or whom she should not marry? How\r\nwas he to guide her through the shoals and rocks which lay in the\r\npath of such a girl before she can achieve matrimony?\r\n\r\nIt was the fate of the family that, with a world of acquaintance,\r\nthey had not many friends. From all close connection with relatives\r\non the side of the Duchess they had been dissevered by old feelings\r\nat first, and afterwards by want of any similitude in the habits\r\nof life. She had, when young, been repressed by male and female\r\nguardians with an iron hand. Such repression had been needed, and had\r\nbeen perhaps salutary, but it had not left behind it much affection.\r\nAnd then her nearest relatives were not sympathetic with the Duke. He\r\ncould obtain no assistance in the care of his girl from that source.\r\nNor could he even do it from his own cousins\' wives, who were his\r\nnearest connections on the side of the Pallisers. They were women\r\nto whom he had ever been kind, but to whom he had never opened his\r\nheart. When, in the midst of the stunning sorrow of the first week,\r\nhe tried to think of all this, it seemed to him that there was\r\nnobody.\r\n\r\nThere had been one lady, a very dear ally, staying in the house with\r\nthem when the Duchess died. This was Mrs. Finn, the wife of Phineas\r\nFinn, who had been one of the Duke\'s colleagues when in office.\r\nHow it had come to pass that Mrs. Finn and the Duchess had become\r\nsingularly bound together has been told elsewhere. But there had been\r\nclose bonds,--so close that when the Duchess on their return from the\r\nContinent had passed through London on her way to Matching, ill at\r\nthe time and very comfortless, it had been almost a thing of course,\r\nthat Mrs. Finn should go with her. And as she had sunk, and then\r\ndespaired, and then died, it was this woman who had always been at\r\nher side, who had ministered to her, and had listened to the fears\r\nand the wishes and hopes she had expressed respecting the children.\r\n\r\nAt Matching, amidst the ruins of the old Priory, there is a parish\r\nburying-ground, and there, in accordance with her own wish, almost\r\nwithin sight of her own bedroom-window, she was buried. On the day\r\nof the funeral a dozen relatives came, Pallisers and M\'Closkies, who\r\non such an occasion were bound to show themselves, as members of the\r\nfamily. With them and his two sons the Duke walked across to the\r\ngraveyard, and then walked back; but even to those who stayed the\r\nnight at the house he hardly spoke. By noon on the following day they\r\nhad all left him, and the only stranger in the house was Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the day after the funeral the Duke and his guest\r\nmet, almost for the first time since the sad event. There had been\r\njust a pressure of the hand, just a glance of compassion, just some\r\nmurmur of deep sorrow,--but there had been no real speech between\r\nthem. Now he had sent for her, and she went down to him in the room\r\nin which he commonly sat at work. He was seated at his table when she\r\nentered, but there was no book open before him, and no pen ready to\r\nhis hand. He was dressed of course in black. That, indeed, was usual\r\nwith him, but now the tailor by his funereal art had added some\r\ndeeper dye of blackness to his appearance. When he rose and turned to\r\nher she thought that he had at once become an old man. His hair was\r\ngrey in parts, and he had never accustomed himself to use that skill\r\nin managing his outside person by which many men are able to preserve\r\nfor themselves a look, if not of youth, at any rate of freshness.\r\nHe was thin, of an adust complexion, and had acquired a habit of\r\nstooping which, when he was not excited, gave him an appearance of\r\nage. All that was common to him; but now it was so much exaggerated\r\nthat he who was not yet fifty might have been taken to be over sixty.\r\n\r\nHe put out his hand to greet her as she came up to him.\r\n"Silverbridge," he said, "tells me that you go back to London\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I thought it would be best, Duke. My presence here can be of no\r\ncomfort to you."\r\n\r\n"I will not say that anything can be of comfort. But of course it\r\nis right that you should go. I can have no excuse for asking you to\r\nremain. While there was yet a hope for her--" Then he stopped, unable\r\nto say a word further in that direction, and yet there was no sign of\r\na tear and no sound of a sob.\r\n\r\n"Of course I would stay, Duke, if I could be of any service."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn will expect you to return to him."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it would be better that I should say that I would stay were\r\nit not that I know that I can be of no real service."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that, Mrs. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Mary should have with her at such a time some other friend."\r\n\r\n"There was none other whom her mother loved as she loved you--none,\r\nnone." This he said almost with energy.\r\n\r\n"There was no one lately, Duke, with whom circumstances caused\r\nher mother to be so closely intimate. But even that perhaps was\r\nunfortunate."\r\n\r\n"I never thought so."\r\n\r\n"That is a great compliment. But as to Lady Mary, will it not\r\nbe as well that she should have with her, as soon as possible,\r\nsomeone,--perhaps someone of her own kindred if it be possible, or,\r\nif not that, at least one of her own kind?"\r\n\r\n"Who is there? Whom do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean no one. It is hard, Duke, to say what I do mean, but perhaps\r\nI had better try. There will be,--probably there have been,--some\r\namong your friends who have regretted the great intimacy which chance\r\nproduced between me and my lost friend. While she was with us no such\r\nfeeling would have sufficed to drive me from her. She had chosen for\r\nherself, and if others disapproved her choice that was nothing to me.\r\nBut as regards Lady Mary, it will be better, I think, that from the\r\nbeginning she should be taught to look for friendship and guidance to\r\nthose--to those who are more naturally connected with her."\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of any guidance," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Of course not. But with one so young, where there is intimacy there\r\nwill be guidance. There should be somebody with her. It was almost\r\nthe last thought that occupied her mother\'s mind. I could not tell\r\nher, Duke, but I can tell you, that I cannot with advantage to your\r\ngirl be that somebody."\r\n\r\n"Cora wished it."\r\n\r\n"Her wishes, probably, were sudden and hardly fixed."\r\n\r\n"Who should it be, then?" asked the father, after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Who am I, Duke, that I should answer such a question?"\r\n\r\nAfter that there was another pause, and then the conference was ended\r\nby a request from the Duke that Mrs. Finn would stay at Matching for\r\nyet two days longer. At dinner they all met,--the father, the three\r\nchildren, and Mrs. Finn. How far the young people among themselves\r\nhad been able to throw off something of the gloom of death need not\r\nhere be asked; but in the presence of their father they were sad and\r\nsombre, almost as he was. On the next day, early in the morning, the\r\nyounger lad returned to his college, and Lord Silverbridge went up to\r\nLondon, where he was supposed to have his home.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you would not mind reading these letters," the Duke said to\r\nMrs. Finn, when she again went to him, in compliance with a message\r\nfrom him asking for her presence. Then she sat down and read two\r\nletters, one from Lady Cantrip, and the other from a Mrs. Jeffrey\r\nPalliser, each of which contained an invitation for his daughter,\r\nand expressed a hope that Lady Mary would not be unwilling to spend\r\nsome time with the writer. Lady Cantrip\'s letter was long, and went\r\nminutely into circumstances. If Lady Mary would come to her, she\r\nwould abstain from having other company in the house till her young\r\nfriend\'s spirits should have somewhat recovered themselves. Nothing\r\ncould be more kind, or proposed in a sweeter fashion. There had,\r\nhowever, been present to the Duke\'s mind as he read it a feeling that\r\na proposition to a bereaved husband to relieve him of the society\r\nof an only daughter, was not one which would usually be made to\r\na father. In such a position a child\'s company would probably\r\nbe his best solace. But he knew,--at this moment he painfully\r\nremembered,--that he was not as are other men. He acknowledged the\r\ntruth of this, but he was not the less grieved and irritated by the\r\nreminder. The letter from Mrs. Jeffrey Palliser was to the same\r\neffect, but was much shorter. If it would suit Mary to come to them\r\nfor a month or six weeks at their place in Gloucestershire, they\r\nwould both be delighted.\r\n\r\n"I should not choose her to go there," said the Duke, as Mrs. Finn\r\nrefolded the latter letter. "My cousin\'s wife is a very good woman,\r\nbut Mary would not be happy with her."\r\n\r\n"Lady Cantrip is an excellent friend for her."\r\n\r\n"Excellent. I know no one whom I esteem more than Lady Cantrip."\r\n\r\n"Would you wish her to go there, Duke?"\r\n\r\nThere came a wistful piteous look over the father\'s face. Why should\r\nhe be treated as no other father would be treated? Why should it\r\nbe supposed that he would desire to send his girl away from him?\r\nBut yet he felt that it would be better that she should go. It was\r\nhis present purpose to remain at Matching through a portion of the\r\nsummer. What could he do to make a girl happy? What comfort would\r\nthere be in his companionship?\r\n\r\n"I suppose she ought to go somewhere," he said.\r\n\r\n"I had not thought of it," said Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"I understood you to say," replied the Duke, almost angrily, "that\r\nshe ought to go to someone who would take care of her."\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of some friend coming to her."\r\n\r\n"Who would come? Who is there that I could possibly ask? You will not\r\nstay."\r\n\r\n"I certainly would stay, if it were for her good. I was thinking,\r\nDuke, that perhaps you might ask the Greys to come to you."\r\n\r\n"They would not come," he said, after a pause.\r\n\r\n"When she was told that it was for her sake, she would come, I\r\nthink."\r\n\r\nThen there was another pause. "I could not ask them," he said; "for\r\nhis sake I could not have it put to her in that way. Perhaps Mary had\r\nbetter go to Lady Cantrip. Perhaps I had better be alone here for a\r\ntime. I do not think that I am fit to have any human being here with\r\nme in my sorrow."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nLady Mary Palliser\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may as well be said at once that Mrs. Finn knew something of Lady\r\nMary which was not known to the father, and which she was not yet\r\nprepared to make known to him. The last winter abroad had been passed\r\nat Rome, and there Lady Mary Palliser had become acquainted with a\r\ncertain Mr. Tregear,--Francis Oliphant Tregear. The Duchess, who had\r\nbeen in constant correspondence with her friend, had asked questions\r\nby letter as to Mr. Tregear, of whom she had only known that he\r\nwas the younger son of a Cornish gentleman, who had become Lord\r\nSilverbridge\'s friend at Oxford. In this there had certainly been but\r\nlittle to recommend him to the intimacy of such a girl as Lady Mary\r\nPalliser. Nor had the Duchess, when writing, ever spoken of him as a\r\nprobable suitor for her daughter\'s hand. She had never connected the\r\ntwo names together. But Mrs. Finn had been clever enough to perceive\r\nthat the Duchess had become fond of Mr. Tregear, and would willingly\r\nhave heard something to his advantage. And she did hear something to\r\nhis advantage,--something also to his disadvantage. At his mother\'s\r\ndeath this young man would inherit a property amounting to about\r\nfifteen hundred a year. "And I am told," said Mrs. Finn, "that he is\r\nquite likely to spend his money before it comes to him." There had\r\nbeen nothing more written specially about Mr. Tregear; but Mrs. Finn\r\nhad feared not only that the young man loved the girl, but that the\r\nyoung man\'s love had in some imprudent way been fostered by the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThen there had been some fitful confidence during those few days\r\nof acute illness. Why should not the girl have the man if he were\r\nlovable? And the Duchess referred to her own early days when she had\r\nloved, and to the great ruin which had come upon her heart when she\r\nhad been severed from the man she had loved. "Not but that it has\r\nbeen all for the best," she had said. "Not but that Plantagenet has\r\nbeen to me all that a husband should be. Only if she can be spared\r\nwhat I suffered, let her be spared." Even when these things had been\r\nsaid to her, Mrs. Finn had found herself unable to ask questions.\r\nShe could not bring herself to inquire whether the girl had in truth\r\ngiven her heart to this young Tregear. The one was nineteen and the\r\nother as yet but two-and-twenty! But though she asked no questions\r\nshe almost knew that it must be so. And she knew also that the\r\nfather, as yet, was quite in the dark on the matter. How was it\r\npossible that in such circumstances she should assume the part of the\r\ngirl\'s confidential friend and monitress? Were she to do so she must\r\nimmediately tell the father everything. In such a position no one\r\ncould be a better friend than Lady Cantrip, and Mrs. Finn had already\r\nalmost made up her mind that, should Lady Cantrip occupy the place,\r\nshe would tell her ladyship all that had passed between herself and\r\nthe Duchess on the subject.\r\n\r\nOf what hopes she might have, or what fears, about her girl, the\r\nDuchess had said no word to her husband. But when she had believed\r\nthat the things of the world were fading away from her, and when he\r\nwas sitting by her bedside,--dumb, because at such a moment he knew\r\nnot how to express the tenderness of his heart,--holding her hand,\r\nand trying so to listen to her words, that he might collect and\r\nremember every wish, she had murmured something about the ultimate\r\ndivision of the great wealth with which she herself had been endowed.\r\n"She had never," she said, "even tried to remember what arrangements\r\nhad been made by lawyers, but she hoped that Mary might be so\r\ncircumstanced, that if her happiness depended on marrying a poor\r\nman, want of money need not prevent it." The Duke suspecting nothing,\r\nbelieving this to be a not unnatural expression of maternal interest,\r\nhad assured her that Mary\'s fortune would be ample.\r\n\r\nMrs. Finn made the proposition to Lady Mary in respect to Lady\r\nCantrip\'s invitation. Lady Mary was very like her mother, especially\r\nin having exactly her mother\'s tone of voice, her quick manner of\r\nspeech, and her sharp intelligence. She had also her mother\'s eyes,\r\nlarge and round, and almost blue, full of life and full of courage,\r\neyes which never seemed to quail, and her mother\'s dark brown hair,\r\nnever long but very copious in its thickness. She was, however,\r\ntaller than her mother, and very much more graceful in her movement.\r\nAnd she could already assume a personal dignity of manner which had\r\nnever been within her mother\'s reach. She had become aware of a\r\ncertain brusqueness of speech in her mother, a certain aptitude to\r\nsay sharp things without thinking whether the sharpness was becoming\r\nto the position which she held, and, taking advantage of the example,\r\nthe girl had already learned that she might gain more than she would\r\nlose by controlling her words.\r\n\r\n"Papa wants me to go to Lady Cantrip," she said.\r\n\r\n"I think he would like it,--just for the present, Lady Mary."\r\n\r\nThough there had been the closest possible intimacy between the\r\nDuchess and Mrs. Finn, this had hardly been so as to the intercourse\r\nbetween Mrs. Finn and the children. Of Mrs. Finn it must be\r\nacknowledged that she was, perhaps fastidiously, afraid of appearing\r\nto take advantage of her friendship with the Duke\'s family. She would\r\ntell herself that though circumstances had compelled her to be the\r\nclosest and nearest friend of a Duchess, still her natural place was\r\nnot among dukes and their children, and therefore in her intercourse\r\nwith the girl she did not at first assume the manner and bearing\r\nwhich her position in the house would have seemed to warrant. Hence\r\nthe "Lady Mary."\r\n\r\n"Why does he want to send me away, Mrs. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"It is not that he wants to send you away, but that he thinks it will\r\nbe better for you to be with some friend. Here you must be so much\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you stay? But I suppose Mr. Finn wants you to be back in\r\nLondon."\r\n\r\n"It is not that only, or, to speak the truth, not that at all. Mr.\r\nFinn could come here if it were suitable. Or for a week or two he\r\nmight do very well without me. But there are other reasons. There is\r\nno one whom your mother respected more highly than Lady Cantrip."\r\n\r\n"I never heard her speak a word of Lady Cantrip."\r\n\r\n"Both he and she are your father\'s intimate friends."\r\n\r\n"Does papa want to be--alone here?"\r\n\r\n"It is you, not himself, of whom he is thinking."\r\n\r\n"Therefore I must think of him, Mrs. Finn. I do not wish him to be\r\nalone. I am sure it would be better that I should stay with him."\r\n\r\n"He feels that it would not be well that you should live without the\r\ncompanionship of some lady."\r\n\r\n"Then let him find some lady. You would be the best, because he knows\r\nyou so well. I, however, am not afraid of being alone. I am sure he\r\nought not to be here quite by himself. If he bids me go, I must go,\r\nand then of course I shall go where he sends me; but I won\'t say that\r\nI think it best that I should go, and certainly I do not want to go\r\nto Lady Cantrip." This she said with great decision, as though the\r\nmatter was one on which she had altogether made up her mind. Then she\r\nadded, in a lower voice: "Why doesn\'t papa speak to me about it?"\r\n\r\n"He is thinking only of what may be best for you."\r\n\r\n"It would be best for me to stay near him. Whom else has he got?"\r\n\r\nAll this Mrs. Finn repeated to the Duke as closely as she could, and\r\nthen of course the father was obliged to speak to his daughter.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t send me away, papa," she said at once.\r\n\r\n"Your life here, Mary, will be inexpressibly sad."\r\n\r\n"It must be sad anywhere. I cannot go to college, like Gerald, or\r\nlive anywhere just as I please, like Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"Do you envy them that?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes, papa. Only I shall think more of poor mamma by being\r\nalone, and I should like to be thinking of her always." He shook his\r\nhead mournfully. "I do not mean that I shall always be unhappy, as I\r\nam now."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear; you are too young for that. It is only the old who\r\nsuffer in that way."\r\n\r\n"You will suffer less if I am with you; won\'t you, papa? I do not\r\nwant to go to Lady Cantrip. I hardly remember her at all."\r\n\r\n"She is very good."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. That is what they used to say to mamma about Lady\r\nMidlothian. Papa, pray do not send me to Lady Cantrip."\r\n\r\nOf course it was decided that she should not go to Lady Cantrip at\r\nonce, or to Mrs. Jeffrey Palliser, and, after a short interval of\r\ndoubt, it was decided also that Mrs. Finn should remain at Matching\r\nfor at least a fortnight. The Duke declared that he would be glad\r\nto see Mr. Finn, but she knew that in his present mood the society\r\nof any one man to whom he would feel himself called upon to devote\r\nhis time, would be a burden to him, and she plainly said that Mr.\r\nFinn had better not come to Matching at present. "There are old\r\nassociations," she said, "which will enable you to bear with me as\r\nyou will with your butler or your groom, but you are not as yet quite\r\nable to make yourself happy with company." This he bore with perfect\r\nequanimity, and then, as it were, handed over his daughter to Mrs.\r\nFinn\'s care.\r\n\r\nVery quickly there came to be close intimacy between Mrs. Finn\r\nand Lady Mary. For a day or two the elder woman, though the place\r\nshe filled was one of absolute confidence, rather resisted than\r\nencouraged the intimacy. She always remembered that the girl was the\r\ndaughter of a great duke, and that her position in the house had\r\nsprung from circumstances which would not, perhaps, in the eyes of\r\nthe world at large, have recommended her for such friendship. She\r\nknew--the reader may possibly know--that nothing had ever been\r\npurer, nothing more disinterested than her friendship. But she knew\r\nalso,--no one knew better,--that the judgment of men and women\r\ndoes not always run parallel with facts. She entertained, too, a\r\nconviction in regard to herself, that hard words and hard judgments\r\nwere to be expected from the world,--were to be accepted by her\r\nwithout any strong feeling of injustice,--because she had been\r\nelevated by chance to the possession of more good things than she\r\nhad merited. She weighed all this with a very fine balance, and even\r\nafter the encouragement she had received from the Duke, was intent on\r\nconfining herself to some position about the girl inferior to that\r\nwhich such a friend as Lady Cantrip might have occupied. But the\r\ngirl\'s manner, and the girl\'s speech about her own mother, overcame\r\nher. It was the unintentional revelation of the Duchess\'s constant\r\nreference to her,--the way in which Lady Mary would assert that\r\n"Mamma used always to say this of you; mamma always knew that you\r\nwould think so and so; mamma used to say that you had told her." It\r\nwas the feeling thus conveyed, that the mother who was now dead had\r\nin her daily dealings with her own child spoken of her as her nearest\r\nfriend, which mainly served to conquer the deference of manner which\r\nshe had assumed.\r\n\r\nThen gradually there came confidences,--and at last absolute\r\nconfidence. The whole story about Mr. Tregear was told. Yes; she\r\nloved Mr. Tregear. She had given him her heart, and had told him so.\r\n\r\n"Then, my dear, your father ought to know it," said Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"No; not yet. Mamma knew it."\r\n\r\n"Did she know all that you have told me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; all. And Mr. Tregear spoke to her, and she said that papa ought\r\nnot to be told quite yet."\r\n\r\nMrs. Finn could not but remember that the friend she had lost was\r\nnot, among women, the one best able to give a girl good counsel in\r\nsuch a crisis.\r\n\r\n"Why not yet, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Well, because--. It is very hard to explain. In the first place,\r\nbecause Mr. Tregear himself does not wish it."\r\n\r\n"That is a very bad reason; the worst in the world."\r\n\r\n"Of course you will say so. Of course everybody would say so. But\r\nwhen there is one person whom one loves better than all the rest,\r\nfor whom one would be ready to die, to whom one is determined that\r\neverything shall be devoted, surely the wishes of a person so dear as\r\nthat ought to have weight."\r\n\r\n"Not in persuading you to do that which is acknowledged to be wrong."\r\n\r\n"What wrong? I am going to do nothing wrong."\r\n\r\n"The very concealment of your love is wrong, after that love has been\r\nnot only given but declared. A girl\'s position in such matters is so\r\ndelicate, especially that of such a girl as you!"\r\n\r\n"I know all about that," said Lady Mary, with something almost\r\napproaching to scorn in her tone. "Of course I have to be--delicate.\r\nI don\'t quite know what the word means. I am not a bit ashamed of\r\nbeing in love with Mr. Tregear. He is a gentleman, highly educated,\r\nvery clever, of an old family,--older, I believe, than papa\'s. And he\r\nis manly and handsome; just what a young man ought to be. Only he is\r\nnot rich."\r\n\r\n"If he be all that you say, ought you not to trust your papa? If he\r\napprove of it, he could give you money."\r\n\r\n"Of course he must be told; but not now. He is nearly broken-hearted\r\nabout dear mamma. He could not bring himself to care about anything\r\nof that kind at present. And then it is Mr. Tregear that should speak\r\nto him first."\r\n\r\n"Not now, Mary."\r\n\r\n"How do you mean not now?"\r\n\r\n"If you had a mother you would talk to her about it."\r\n\r\n"Mamma knew."\r\n\r\n"If she were still living she would tell your father."\r\n\r\n"But she didn\'t tell him though she did know. She didn\'t mean to tell\r\nhim quite yet. She wanted to see Mr. Tregear here in England first.\r\nOf course I shall do nothing till papa does know."\r\n\r\n"You will not see him?"\r\n\r\n"How can I see him here? He will not come here, if you mean that."\r\n\r\n"You do not correspond with him?" Here for the first time the girl\r\nblushed. "Oh, Mary, if you are writing to him your father ought to\r\nknow it."\r\n\r\n"I have not written to him; but when he heard how ill poor mamma was,\r\nthen he wrote to me--twice. You may see his letters. It is all about\r\nher. No one worshipped mamma as he did."\r\n\r\nGradually the whole story was told. These two young persons\r\nconsidered themselves to be engaged, but had agreed that their\r\nengagement should not be made known to the Duke till something had\r\noccurred, or some time had arrived, as to which Mr. Tregear was to be\r\nthe judge. In Mrs. Finn\'s opinion nothing could be more unwise, and\r\nshe said much to induce the girl to confess everything to her father\r\nat once. But in all her arguments she was opposed by the girl\'s\r\nreference to her mother. "Mamma knew it." And it did certainly seem\r\nto Mrs. Finn as though the mother had assented to this imprudent\r\nconcealment. When she endeavoured, in her own mind, to make excuse\r\nfor her friend, she felt almost sure that the Duchess, with all\r\nher courage, had been afraid to propose to her husband that their\r\ndaughter should marry a commoner without an income. But in thinking\r\nof all that, there could now be nothing gained. What ought she to\r\ndo--at once? The girl, in telling her, had exacted no promise of\r\nsecrecy, nor would she have given any such promise; but yet she did\r\nnot like the idea of telling the tale behind the girl\'s back. It was\r\nevident that Lady Mary had considered herself to be safe in confiding\r\nher story to her mother\'s old friend. Lady Mary no doubt had had her\r\nconfidences with her mother,--confidences from which it had been\r\nintended by both that the father should be excluded; and now she\r\nseemed naturally to expect that this new ally should look at this\r\ngreat question as her mother had looked at it. The father had been\r\nregarded as a great outside power, which could hardly be overcome,\r\nbut which might be evaded, or made inoperative by stratagem. It was\r\nnot that the daughter did not love him. She loved him and venerated\r\nhim highly,--the veneration perhaps being stronger than the love. The\r\nDuchess, too, had loved him dearly,--more dearly in late years than\r\nin her early life. But her husband to her had always been an outside\r\npower which had in many cases to be evaded. Lady Mary, though she did\r\nnot express all this, evidently thought that in this new friend she\r\nhad found a woman whose wishes and aspirations for her would be those\r\nwhich her mother had entertained.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Finn was much troubled in her mind, thinking that it was her\r\nduty to tell the story to the Duke. It was not only the daughter who\r\nhad trusted her, but the father also; and the father\'s confidence had\r\nbeen not only the first but by far the holier of the two. And the\r\nquestion was one so important to the girl\'s future happiness! There\r\ncould be no doubt that the peril of her present position was very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n"Mary," she said one morning, when the fortnight was nearly at an\r\nend, "your father ought to know all this. I should feel that I had\r\nbetrayed him were I to go away leaving him in ignorance."\r\n\r\n"You do not mean to say that you will tell?" said the girl, horrified\r\nat the idea of such treachery.\r\n\r\n"I wish that I could induce you to do so. Every day that he is kept\r\nin the dark is an injury to you."\r\n\r\n"I am doing nothing. What harm can come? It is not as though I were\r\nseeing him every day."\r\n\r\n"This harm will come; your father of course will know that you became\r\nengaged to Mr. Tregear in Italy, and that a fact so important to him\r\nhas been kept back from him."\r\n\r\n"If there is anything in that, the evil has been done already. Of\r\ncourse poor mamma did mean to tell him."\r\n\r\n"She cannot tell him now, and therefore you ought to do what she\r\nwould have done."\r\n\r\n"I cannot break my promise to him." "Him" always meant Mr. Tregear.\r\n"I have told him that I would not do so till I had his consent, and I\r\nwill not."\r\n\r\nThis was very dreadful to Mrs. Finn, and yet she was most unwilling\r\nto take upon herself the part of a stern elder, and declare that\r\nunder the circumstances she must tell the tale. The story had been\r\ntold to her under the supposition that she was not a stern elder,\r\nthat she was regarded as the special friend of the dear mother who\r\nwas gone, that she might be trusted to assist against the terrible\r\nweight of parental authority. She could not endure to be regarded at\r\nonce as a traitor by this young friend who had sweetly inherited the\r\naffection with which the Duchess had regarded her. And yet if she\r\nwere to be silent how could she forgive herself? "The Duke certainly\r\nought to know at once," said she, repeating her words merely that she\r\nmight gain some time for thinking, and pluck up courage to declare\r\nher purpose, should she resolve on betraying the secret.\r\n\r\n"If you tell him now, I will never forgive you," said Lady Mary.\r\n\r\n"I am bound in honour to see that your father knows a thing which is\r\nof such vital importance to him and to you. Having heard all this\r\nI have no right to keep it from him. If Mr. Tregear really loves\r\nyou"--Lady Mary smiled at the doubt implied by this suggestion--"he\r\nought to feel that for your sake there should be no secret from your\r\nfather." Then she paused a moment to think. "Will you let me see Mr.\r\nTregear myself, and talk to him about it?"\r\n\r\nTo this Lady Mary at first demurred, but when she found that in no\r\nother way could she prevent Mrs. Finn from going at once to the\r\nDuke and telling him everything, she consented. Under Mrs. Finn\'s\r\ndirections she wrote a note to her lover, which Mrs. Finn saw,\r\nand then undertook to send it, with a letter from herself, to Mr.\r\nTregear\'s address in London. The note was very short, and was indeed\r\ndictated by the elder lady, with some dispute, however, as to certain\r\nterms, in which the younger lady had her way. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAREST FRANK,\r\n\r\n   I wish you to see Mrs. Finn, who, as you know, was dear\r\n   mamma\'s most particular friend. Please go to her, as she\r\n   will ask you to do. When you hear what she says I think\r\n   you ought to do what she advises.\r\n\r\n   Yours for ever and always,\r\n\r\n   M. P.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Mrs. Finn sent enclosed in an envelope, with a few words from\r\nherself, asking the gentleman to call upon her in Park Lane, on a day\r\nand at an hour fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFrancis Oliphant Tregear\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Francis Oliphant Tregear was a young man who might not improbably\r\nmake a figure in the world, should circumstances be kind to him,\r\nbut as to whom it might be doubted whether circumstances would be\r\nsufficiently kind to enable him to use serviceably his unquestionable\r\ntalents and great personal gifts. He had taught himself to regard\r\nhimself as a young English gentleman of the first water, qualified\r\nby his birth and position to live with all that was most noble and\r\nmost elegant; and he could have lived in that sphere naturally\r\nand gracefully were it not that the part of the "sphere" which he\r\nspecially affected requires wealth as well as birth and intellect.\r\nWealth he had not, and yet he did not abandon the sphere. As a\r\nconsequence of all this, it was possible that the predictions of his\r\nfriends as to that figure which he was to make in the world might be\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nHe had been educated at Eton, from whence he had been sent to Christ\r\nChurch; and both at school and at college had been the most intimate\r\nfriend of the son and heir of a great and wealthy duke. He and Lord\r\nSilverbridge had been always together, and they who were interested\r\nin the career of the young nobleman had generally thought he had\r\nchosen his friend well. Tregear had gone out in honours, having\r\nbeen a second-class man. His friend Silverbridge, we know, had been\r\nallowed to take no degree at all; but the terrible practical joke\r\nby which the whole front of the Dean\'s house had been coloured\r\nscarlet in the middle of the night, had been carried on without any\r\nassistance from Tregear. The two young men had then been separated\r\nfor a year; but immediately after taking his degree, Tregear, at the\r\ninvitation of Lord Silverbridge, had gone to Italy, and had there\r\ncompletely made good his footing with the Duchess,--with what effect\r\non another member of the Palliser family the reader already knows.\r\n\r\nThe young man was certainly clever. When the Duchess found that he\r\ncould talk without any shyness, that he could speak French fluently,\r\nand that after a month in Italy he could chatter Italian, at any rate\r\nwithout reticence or shame; when she perceived that all the women\r\nliked the lad\'s society and impudence, and that all the young men\r\nwere anxious to know him, she was glad to find that Silverbridge\r\nhad chosen so valuable a friend. And then he was beautiful to look\r\nat,--putting her almost in mind of another man on whom her eyes had\r\nonce loved to dwell. He was dark, with hair that was almost black,\r\nbut yet was not black; with clear brown eyes, a nose as regular as\r\nApollo\'s, and a mouth in which was ever to be found that expression\r\nof manliness, which of all characteristics is the one which women\r\nlove the best. He was five feet ten in height. He was always well\r\ndressed, and yet always so dressed as to seem to show that his\r\noutside garniture had not been matter of trouble to him. Before the\r\nDuchess had dreamed what might take place between this young man and\r\nher daughter she had been urgent in her congratulations to her son as\r\nto the possession of such a friend.\r\n\r\nFor though she now and then would catch a glimpse of the outer man,\r\nwhich would remind her of that other beautiful one whom she had\r\nknown in her youth, and though, as these glimpses came, she would\r\nremember how poor in spirit and how unmanly that other one had\r\nbeen, though she would confess to herself how terrible had been the\r\nheart-shipwreck which that other one had brought upon herself; still\r\nshe was able completely to assure herself that this man, though not\r\nsuperior in external grace, was altogether different in mind and\r\ncharacter. She was old enough now to see all this and to appreciate\r\nit. Young Tregear had his own ideas about the politics of the day,\r\nand they were ideas with which she sympathised, though they were\r\nantagonistic to the politics of her life. He had his ideas about\r\nbooks too, as to manners of life, as to art, and even ethics. Whether\r\nor no in all this there was not much that was superficial only, she\r\nwas not herself deep enough to discover. Nor would she have been\r\ndeterred from admiring him had she been told that it was tinsel. Such\r\nwere the acquirements, such the charms, that she loved. Here was a\r\nyoung man who dared to speak, and had always something ready to be\r\nspoken; who was not afraid of beauty, nor daunted by superiority of\r\nrank; who, if he had not money, could carry himself on equal terms\r\namong those who had. In this way he won the Duchess\'s heart, and\r\nhaving done that, was it odd that he should win the heart of the\r\ndaughter also?\r\n\r\nHis father was a Cornwall squire of comfortable means, having joined\r\nthe property of his wife to his own for the period of his own life.\r\nShe had possessed land also in Cornwall, supposed to be worth fifteen\r\nhundred a year, and his own paternal estate at Polwenning was said\r\nto be double that value. Being a prudent man, he lived at home as a\r\ncountry gentleman, and thus was able in his county to hold his head\r\nas high as richer men. But Frank Tregear was only his second son; and\r\nthough Frank would hereafter inherit his mother\'s fortune, he was by\r\nno means now in a position to assume the right of living as an idle\r\nman. Yet he was idle. The elder brother, who was considerably older\r\nthan Frank, was an odd man, much addicted to quarrelling with his\r\nfamily, and who spent his time chiefly in travelling about the world.\r\nFrank\'s mother, who was not the mother of the heir also, would\r\nsometimes surmise, in Frank\'s hearing, that the entire property must\r\nultimately come to him. That other Tregear, who was now supposed to\r\nbe investigating the mountains of Crim Tartary, would surely never\r\nmarry. And Frank was the favourite also with his father, who paid\r\nhis debts at Oxford with not much grumbling; who was proud of his\r\nfriendship with a future duke; who did not urge, as he ought to have\r\nurged, that vital question of a profession; and who, when he allowed\r\nhis son four hundred pounds a year, was almost content with that\r\nson\'s protestations that he knew how to live as a poor man among rich\r\nmen, without chagrin and without trouble.\r\n\r\nSuch was the young man who now, in lieu of a profession, had taken\r\nupon himself the responsibility of an engagement with Lady Mary\r\nPalliser. He was tolerably certain that, should he be able to\r\novercome the parental obstacles which he would no doubt find in his\r\npath, money would be forthcoming sufficient for the purposes of\r\nmatrimonial life. The Duke\'s wealth was fabulous, and as a great\r\npart of it, if not the greater, had come from his wife, there would\r\nprobably be ample provision for the younger children. And when the\r\nDuchess had found out how things were going, and had yielded to her\r\ndaughter, after an opposition which never had the appearance even of\r\nbeing in earnest, she had taken upon herself to say that she would\r\nuse her influence to prevent any great weight of trouble from\r\npecuniary matters. Frank Tregear, young and bright, and full of\r\nhearty ambitions, was certainly not the man to pursue a girl simply\r\nbecause of her fortune; nor was he weak enough to be attracted simply\r\nby the glitter of rank; but he was wise enough with worldly wisdom\r\nto understand thoroughly the comforts of a good income, and he was\r\nsufficiently attached to high position to feel the advantage of\r\nmarrying a daughter of the Duke of Omnium.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duchess was leaving Italy, it had been her declared purpose\r\nto tell her husband the story as soon as they were at home in\r\nEngland. And it was on this understanding that Frank Tregear had\r\nexplained to the girl that he would not as yet ask her father for\r\nhis permission to be received into the family as a suitor. Everyone\r\nconcerned had felt that the Duke would not easily be reconciled to\r\nsuch a son-in-law, and that the Duchess should be the one to bell the\r\ncat.\r\n\r\nThere was one member of the family who had hitherto been half-hearted\r\nin the matter. Lord Silverbridge had vacillated between loyalty to\r\nhis friend and a certain feeling as to the impropriety of such a\r\nmatch for his sister. He was aware that something very much better\r\nshould be expected for her, and still was unable to explain his\r\nobjections to Tregear. He had not at first been admitted into\r\nconfidence, either by his sister or by Tregear, but had questioned\r\nhis friend when he saw what was going on. "Certainly I love your\r\nsister," Tregear had said; "do you object?" Lord Silverbridge was the\r\nweaker of the two, and much subject to the influence of his friend;\r\nbut he could on occasion be firm, and he did at first object. But he\r\ndid not object strongly, and allowed himself at last to be content\r\nwith declaring that the Duke would never give his consent.\r\n\r\nWhile Tregear was with his love, or near her, his hopes and fears\r\nwere sufficient to occupy his mind; and immediately on his return,\r\nall the world was nothing to him, except as far as the world was\r\nconcerned with Lady Mary Palliser. He had come back to England\r\nsomewhat before the ducal party, and the pleasures and occupations\r\nof London life had not abated his love, but enabled him to feel that\r\nthere was something in life over and beyond his love; whereas to\r\nLady Mary, down at Matching, there had been nothing over and beyond\r\nher love--except the infinite grief and desolation produced by her\r\nmother\'s death.\r\n\r\nTregear, when he received the note from Mrs. Finn, was staying at\r\nthe Duke\'s house in Carlton Terrace. Silverbridge was there, and, on\r\nleaving Matching, had asked the Duke\'s permission to have his friend\r\nwith him. The Duke at that time was not well pleased with his son\r\nas to a matter of politics, and gave his son\'s friend credit for\r\nthe evil counsel which had produced this displeasure. But still\r\nhe had not refused his assent to this proposition. Had he done so,\r\nSilverbridge would probably have gone elsewhere; and though there\r\nwas a matter in respect to Tregear of which the Duke disapproved, it\r\nwas not a matter, as he thought, which would have justified him in\r\nexpelling the young man from his house. The young man was a strong\r\nConservative; and now Silverbridge had declared his purpose of\r\nentering the House of Commons, if he did enter it, as one of the\r\nConservative party.\r\n\r\nThis had been a terrible blow to the Duke; and he believed that it\r\nall came from this young Tregear. Still he must do his duty, and not\r\nmore than his duty. He knew nothing against Tregear. That a Tregear\r\nshould be a Conservative was perhaps natural enough--at any rate, was\r\nnot disgraceful; that he should have his political creed sufficiently\r\nat heart to be able to persuade another man, was to his credit.\r\nHe was a gentleman, well educated, superior in many things to\r\nSilverbridge himself. There were those who said that Silverbridge\r\nhad redeemed himself from contempt--from that sort of contempt which\r\nmight be supposed to await a young nobleman who had painted scarlet\r\nthe residence of the Head of his college--by the fact of his having\r\nchosen such a friend. The Duke was essentially a just man; and\r\nthough, at the very moment in which the request was made, his heart\r\nwas half crushed by his son\'s apostasy, he gave the permission asked.\r\n\r\n"You know Mrs. Finn?" Tregear said to his friend one morning at\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n"I remember her all my life. She used to be a great deal with my\r\ngrandfather. I believe he left her a lot of diamonds and money, and\r\nthat she wouldn\'t have them. I don\'t know whether the diamonds are\r\nnot locked up somewhere now, so that she can take them when she\r\npleases."\r\n\r\n"What a singular woman!"\r\n\r\n"It was odd; but she had some fad about it. What makes you ask about\r\nMrs. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"She wants me to go and see her."\r\n\r\n"What about?"\r\n\r\n"I think I have heard your mother speak of her as though she loved\r\nher dearly," said Tregear.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about loving her dearly. They were intimate, and Mrs.\r\nFinn used to be with her very much when she was in the country. She\r\nwas at Matching just now, when my poor mother died. Why does she want\r\nto see you?"\r\n\r\n"She has written to me from Matching. She wants to see me--"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"To tell you the truth, I do not know what she has to say to me;\r\nthough I can guess."\r\n\r\n"What do you guess?"\r\n\r\n"It is something about your sister."\r\n\r\n"You will have to give that up, Tregear."\r\n\r\n"I think not."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you will; my father will never stand it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what there is to stand. I am not noble, nor am I rich;\r\nbut I am as good a gentleman as he is."\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow," said the young lord, "you know very well what I\r\nthink about all that. A fellow is not any better to me because he\r\nhas got a title, nor yet because he owns half a county. But men have\r\ntheir ideas and feelings about it. My father is a rich man, and of\r\ncourse he\'ll want his daughter to marry a rich man. My father is\r\nnoble, and he\'ll want his daughter to marry a nobleman. You can\'t\r\nvery well marry Mary without his permission, and therefore you had\r\nbetter let it alone."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t even asked his permission as yet."\r\n\r\n"Even my mother was afraid to speak to him about it, and I never knew\r\nher to be afraid to say anything else to him."\r\n\r\n"I shall not be afraid," said Tregear, looking grimly.\r\n\r\n"I should. That\'s the difference between us."\r\n\r\n"He can\'t very well eat me."\r\n\r\n"Nor even bite you;--nor will he abuse you. But he can look at you,\r\nand he can say a word or two which you will find it very hard to\r\nbear. My governor is the quietest man I know, but he has a way\r\nof making himself disagreeable when he wishes, that I never saw\r\nequalled."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, I had better go and see your Mrs. Finn." Then Tregear\r\nwrote a line to Mrs. Finn, and made his appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPark Lane\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the affair Tregear had found the necessity\r\nof bolstering himself up inwardly in his great attempt by mottoes,\r\nproverbs, and instigations to courage addressed to himself. "None but\r\nthe brave deserve the fair." "De l\'audace, et encore de l\'audace, et\r\ntoujours de l\'audace." He was a man naturally of good heart in such\r\nmatters, who was not afraid of his brother-men, nor yet of women,\r\nhis sisters. But in this affair he knew very much persistence would\r\nbe required of him, and that even with such persistence he might\r\nprobably fail, unless he should find a more than ordinary constancy\r\nin the girl. That the Duke could not eat him, indeed that nobody\r\ncould eat him as long as he carried himself as an honest man and a\r\ngentleman, was to him an inward assurance on which he leaned much.\r\nAnd yet he was conscious, almost with a feeling of shame, that in\r\nItaly he had not spoken to the Duke about his daughter because he was\r\nafraid lest the Duke might eat him. In such an affair he should have\r\nbeen careful from the first to keep his own hands thoroughly clean.\r\nHad it not been his duty as a gentleman to communicate with the\r\nfather, if not before he gained the girl\'s heart, at any rate as soon\r\nas he knew he had done so? He had left Italy thinking that he would\r\ncertainly meet the Duchess and her daughter in London, and that then\r\nhe might go to the Duke as though this love of his had arisen from\r\nthe sweetness of those meetings in London. But all these ideas had\r\nbeen dissipated by the great misfortune of the death of Lady Mary\'s\r\nmother. From all this he was driven to acknowledge to himself that\r\nhis silence in Italy had been wrong, that he had been weak in\r\nallowing himself to be guided by the counsel of the Duchess, and that\r\nhe had already armed the Duke with one strong argument against him.\r\n\r\nHe did not doubt but that Mrs. Finn would be opposed to him. Of\r\ncourse he could not doubt but that all the world would now be opposed\r\nto him,--except the girl herself. He would find no other friend so\r\ngenerous, so romantic, so unworldly as the Duchess had been. It was\r\nclear to him that Lady Mary had told the story of her engagement to\r\nMrs. Finn, and that Mrs. Finn had not as yet told it to the Duke.\r\nFrom this he was justified in regarding Mrs. Finn as the girl\'s\r\nfriend. The request made was that he should at once do something\r\nwhich Mrs. Finn was to suggest. He could hardly have been so\r\nrequested, and that in terms of such warm affection, had it been Mrs.\r\nFinn\'s intention to ask him to desist altogether from his courtship.\r\nThis woman was regarded by Lady Mary as her mother\'s dearest friend.\r\nIt was therefore incumbent on him now to induce her to believe in him\r\nas the Duchess had believed.\r\n\r\nHe knocked at the door of Mrs. Finn\'s little house in Park Lane a\r\nfew minutes before the time appointed, and found himself alone when\r\nhe was shown into the drawing-room. He had heard much of this lady\r\nthough he had never seen her, and had heard much also of her husband.\r\nThere had been a kind of mystery about her. People did not quite\r\nunderstand how it was that she had been so intimate with the Duchess,\r\nnor why the late Duke had left to her an enormous legacy, which as\r\nyet had never been claimed. There was supposed, too, to have been\r\nsomething especially romantic in her marriage with her present\r\nhusband. It was believed also that she was very rich. The rumours of\r\nall these things together had made her a person of note, and Tregear,\r\nwhen he found himself alone in the drawing-room, looked round about\r\nhim as though a special interest was to be attached to the belongings\r\nof such a woman. It was a pretty room, somewhat dark, because the\r\ncurtains were almost closed across the windows, but furnished with\r\na pretty taste, and now, in these early April days, filled with\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n"I have to apologise, Mr. Tregear, for keeping you waiting," she said\r\nas she entered the room.\r\n\r\n"I fear I was before my time."\r\n\r\n"I know that I am after mine,--a few minutes," said the lady.\r\n\r\nHe told himself that though she was not a young woman, yet she was\r\nattractive. She was dark, and still wore her black hair in curls,\r\nsuch as are now seldom seen with ladies. Perhaps the reduced light of\r\nthe chamber had been regulated with some regard to her complexion and\r\nto her age. The effect, however, was good, and Frank Tregear felt at\r\nonce interested in her.\r\n\r\n"You have just come up from Matching?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes; only the day before yesterday. It is very good of you to come\r\nto me so soon."\r\n\r\n"Of course I came when you sent for me. I am afraid the Duke felt his\r\nloss severely."\r\n\r\n"How should he not, such a loss as it was? Few people knew how much\r\nhe trusted her, and how dearly he loved her."\r\n\r\n"Silverbridge has told me that he is awfully cut up."\r\n\r\n"You have seen Lord Silverbridge then?"\r\n\r\n"Just at present I am living with him, at Carlton Terrace."\r\n\r\n"In the Duke\'s house?" she asked, with some surprise.\r\n\r\n"Yes; in the Duke\'s house. Silverbridge and I have been very\r\nintimate. Of course the Duke knows that I am there. Is there any\r\nchance of his coming to town?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet, I fear. He is determined to be alone. I wish it were\r\notherwise, as I am sure he would better bear his sorrow, if he would\r\ngo about among other men."\r\n\r\n"No doubt he would suffer less," said Tregear. Then there was a\r\npause. Each wished that the other should introduce the matter which\r\nboth knew was to be the subject of their conversation. But Tregear\r\nwould not begin. "When I left them all at Florence," he said, "I\r\nlittle thought that I should never see her again."\r\n\r\n"You had been intimate with them, Mr. Tregear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I think I may say I have been intimate with them. I had been at\r\nEton and at Christ Church with Silverbridge, and we have always been\r\nmuch together."\r\n\r\n"I have understood that. Have you and the Duke been good friends?"\r\n\r\n"We have never been enemies."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not that."\r\n\r\n"The Duke, I think, does not much care about young people. I hardly\r\nknow what he used to do with himself. When I dined with them, I saw\r\nhim, but I did not often do that. I think he used to read a good\r\ndeal, and walk about alone. We were always riding."\r\n\r\n"Lady Mary used to ride?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; and Lord Silverbridge and Lord Gerald. And the Duchess used\r\nto drive. One of us would always be with her."\r\n\r\n"And so you became intimate with the whole family?"\r\n\r\n"So I became intimate with the whole family."\r\n\r\n"And especially so with Lady Mary?" This she said in her sweetest\r\npossible tone, and with a most gracious smile.\r\n\r\n"Especially so with Lady Mary," he replied.\r\n\r\n"It will be very good of you, Mr. Tregear, if you endure and forgive\r\nall this cross-questioning from me, who am a perfect stranger to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"But you are not a perfect stranger to her."\r\n\r\n"That is it, of course. Now, if you will allow me, I will explain to\r\nyou exactly what my footing with her is. When the Duchess returned,\r\nand when I found her to be so ill as she passed through London, I\r\nwent down with her into the country,--quite as a matter of course."\r\n\r\n"So I understand."\r\n\r\n"And there she died,--in my arms. I will not try to harass you by\r\ntelling you what those few days were; how absolutely he was struck to\r\nthe ground, how terrible was the grief of the daughter, how the boys\r\nwere astonished by the feeling of their loss. After a few days they\r\nwent away. It was, I think, their father\'s wish that they should go.\r\nAnd I too was going away,--and had felt, indeed, directly her spirit\r\nhad parted from her, that I was only in the way in his house. But I\r\nstayed at his request, because he did not wish his daughter to be\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"I can easily understand that, Mrs. Finn."\r\n\r\n"I wanted her to go to Lady Cantrip who had invited her, but she\r\nwould not. In that way we were thrown together in the closest\r\nintercourse, for two or three weeks. Then she told me the story of\r\nyour engagement."\r\n\r\n"That was natural, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Surely so. Think of her position, left as she is without a mother!\r\nIt was incumbent on her to tell someone. There was, however, one\r\nother person in whom it would have been much better that she should\r\nhave confided."\r\n\r\n"What person?"\r\n\r\n"Her father."\r\n\r\n"I rather fancy that it is I who ought to tell him."\r\n\r\n"As far as I understand these things, Mr. Tregear,--which, indeed, is\r\nvery imperfectly,--I think it is natural that a girl should at once\r\ntell her mother when a gentleman has made her understand that he\r\nloves her."\r\n\r\n"She did so, Mrs. Finn."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose that generally the mother would tell the father."\r\n\r\n"She did not."\r\n\r\n"No; and therefore the position of the young lady is now one of great\r\nembarrassment. The Duchess has gone from us, and we must now make up\r\nour minds as to what had better be done. It is out of the question\r\nthat Lady Mary should be allowed to consider herself to be engaged,\r\nand that the father should be kept in ignorance of her position." She\r\npaused for his reply, but as he said nothing, she continued: "Either\r\nyou must tell the Duke, or she must do so, or I must do so."\r\n\r\n"I suppose she told you in confidence."\r\n\r\n"No doubt. She told it me presuming that I would not betray her; but\r\nI shall,--if that be a betrayal. The Duke must know it. It will be\r\ninfinitely better that he should know it through you, or through her,\r\nthan through me. But he must be told."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t quite see why," said Tregear.\r\n\r\n"For her sake,--whom I suppose you love."\r\n\r\n"Certainly I love her."\r\n\r\n"In order that she may not suffer. I wonder you do not see it, Mr.\r\nTregear. Perhaps you have a sister."\r\n\r\n"I have no sister as it happens."\r\n\r\n"But you can imagine what your feelings would be. Should you like to\r\nthink of a sister as being engaged to a man without the knowledge of\r\nany of her family?"\r\n\r\n"It was not so. The Duchess knew it. The present condition of things\r\nis altogether an accident."\r\n\r\n"It is an accident that must be brought to an end."\r\n\r\n"Of course it must be brought to an end. I am not such a fool as to\r\nsuppose that I can make her my wife without telling her father."\r\n\r\n"I mean at once, Mr. Tregear."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that you are rather dictating to me, Mrs. Finn."\r\n\r\n"I owe you an apology, of course, for meddling in your affairs at\r\nall. But as it will be more conducive to your success that the Duke\r\nshould hear this from you than from me, and as I feel that I am bound\r\nby my duty to him and to Lady Mary to see that he be not left in\r\nignorance, I think that I am doing you a service."\r\n\r\n"I do not like to have a constraint put upon me."\r\n\r\n"That, Mr. Tregear, is what gentlemen, I fancy, very often feel in\r\nregard to ladies. But the constraint of which you speak is necessary\r\nfor their protection. Are you unwilling to see the Duke?"\r\n\r\nHe was very unwilling, but he would not confess so much. He gave\r\nvarious reasons for delay, urging repeatedly that the question of his\r\nmarriage was one which he could not press upon the Duke so soon after\r\nthe death of the Duchess. And when she assured him that this was a\r\nmatter of importance so great, that even the death of the man\'s wife\r\nshould not be held by him to justify delay, he became angry, and for\r\nawhile insisted that he must be allowed to follow his own judgment.\r\nBut he gave her a promise that he would see the Duke before a week\r\nwas over. Nevertheless he left the house in dudgeon, having told Mrs.\r\nFinn more than once that she was taking advantage of Lady Mary\'s\r\nconfidence. They hardly parted as friends, and her feeling was, on\r\nthe whole, hostile to him and to his love. It could not, she thought,\r\nbe for the happiness of such a one as Lady Mary that she should give\r\nherself to one who seemed to have so little to recommend him.\r\n\r\nHe, when he had left her, was angry with his own weakness. He had not\r\nonly promised that he would make his application to the Duke, but\r\nthat he would do so within the period of a week. Who was she that she\r\nshould exact terms from him after this fashion, and prescribe days\r\nand hours? And now, because this strange woman had spoken to him, he\r\nwas compelled to make a journey down to the Duke\'s country house, and\r\nseek an interview in which he would surely be snubbed!\r\n\r\nThis occurred on a Wednesday, and he resolved that he would go down\r\nto Matching on the next Monday. He said nothing of his plan to any\r\none, and not a word passed between him and Lord Silverbridge about\r\nLady Mary during the first two or three days. But on the Saturday\r\nSilverbridge appeared at breakfast with a letter in his hand. "The\r\ngovernor is coming up to town," he said.\r\n\r\n"Immediately?"\r\n\r\n"In the course of next week. He says that he thinks he shall be here\r\non Wednesday."\r\n\r\nIt immediately struck Tregear that this sudden journey must have some\r\nreference to Lady Mary and her engagement. "Do you know why he is\r\ncoming?"\r\n\r\n"Because of these vacancies in Parliament."\r\n\r\n"Why should that bring him up?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose he hopes to be able to talk me into obedience. He wants me\r\nto stand for the county--as a Liberal, of course. I intend to stand\r\nfor the borough as a Conservative, and I have told them so down\r\nat Silverbridge. I am very sorry to annoy him, and all that kind\r\nof thing. But what the deuce is a fellow to do? If a man has got\r\npolitical convictions of his own, of course, he must stick to them."\r\nThis the young Lord said with a good deal of self-assurance, as\r\nthough he, by the light of his own reason, had ascertained on which\r\nside the truth lay in political contests of the day.\r\n\r\n"There is a good deal to be said on both sides of the question, my\r\nboy." At this particular moment Tregear felt that the Duke ought to\r\nbe propitiated.\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t have me give up my convictions!"\r\n\r\n"A seat in Parliament is a great thing."\r\n\r\n"I can probably secure that, whichever side I take. I thought you\r\nwere so devilish hot against the Radicals."\r\n\r\n"So I am. But then you are, as it were, bound by family allegiance."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be shot if I am. One never knows how to understand you\r\nnowadays. It used to be a great doctrine with you, that nothing\r\nshould induce a man to vote against his political opinions."\r\n\r\n"So it is,--if he has really got any. However, as your father is\r\ncoming to London, I need not go down to Matching."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say that you were going to Matching?"\r\n\r\n"I had intended to beard the lion in his country den; but now the\r\nlion will find me in his own town den, and I must beard him here."\r\n\r\nThen Tregear wrote a most chilling note to Mrs. Finn, informing her\r\nwith great precision, that, as the Duke of Omnium intended to be in\r\ntown one day next week, he would postpone the performance of his\r\npromise for a day or two beyond the allotted time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n"It Is Impossible"\r\n\r\n\r\nDown at Matching Lady Mary\'s life was very dull after Mrs. Finn had\r\nleft her. She had a horse to ride, but had no one to ride with her.\r\nShe had a carriage in which to be driven, but no one to be driven\r\nwith her, and no special places whither to go. Her father would walk\r\ndaily for two hours, and she would accompany him when he encouraged\r\nher to do so; but she had an idea that he preferred taking his walks\r\nalone, and when they were together there was no feeling of confidence\r\nbetween them. There could be none on her part, as she knew that she\r\nwas keeping back information which he was entitled to possess. On\r\nthis matter she received two letters from Mrs. Finn, in the first of\r\nwhich she was told that Mr. Tregear intended to present himself at\r\nMatching within a few days, and was advised in the same letter not to\r\nendeavour to see her lover on that occasion; and then, in the second\r\nshe was informed that this interview with her father was to be sought\r\nnot at Matching but in London. From this latter letter there was of\r\ncourse some disappointment, though some feeling of relief. Had he\r\ncome there she might possibly have seen him after the interview.\r\nBut she would have been subjected to the immediate sternness of her\r\nfather\'s anger. That she would now escape. She would not be called\r\non to meet him just when the first blow had fallen upon him. She was\r\nquite sure that he would disapprove of the thing. She was quite sure\r\nthat he would be very angry. She knew that he was a peculiarly just\r\nman, and yet she thought that in this he would be unjust. Had she\r\nbeen called upon to sing the praises of her father she would have\r\ninsisted above all things on the absolute integrity of his mind, and\r\nyet, knowing as she did that he would be opposed to her marriage with\r\nMr. Tregear, she assured herself every day and every hour that he\r\nhad no right to make any such objection. The man she loved was a\r\ngentleman, and an honest man, by no means a fool, and subject to no\r\nvices. Her father had no right to demand that she should give her\r\nheart to a rich man, or to one of high rank. Rank! As for rank, she\r\ntold herself that she had the most supreme contempt for it. She\r\nthought that she had seen it near enough already to be sure that it\r\nought to have no special allurements. What was it doing for her?\r\nSimply restraining her choice among comparatively a few who seemed to\r\nher by no means the best endowed of God\'s creatures.\r\n\r\nOf one thing she was very sure, that under no pressure whatsoever\r\nwould she abandon her engagement with Mr. Tregear. That to her had\r\nbecome a bond almost as holy as matrimony itself could be. She had\r\ntold the man that she loved him, and after that there could be no\r\nretreat. He had kissed her, and she had returned his caress. He had\r\ntold her that she was his, as his arm was round her; and she had\r\nacknowledged that it was so, that she belonged to him, and could not\r\nbe taken away from him. All this was to her a compact so sacred that\r\nnothing could break it but a desire on his part to have it annulled.\r\nNo other man had ever whispered a word of love to her, of no other\r\nman had an idea entered her mind that it could be pleasant to join\r\nher lot in life with his. With her it had been all new and all\r\nsacred. Love with her had that religion which nothing but freshness\r\ncan give it. That freshness, that bloom, may last through a long\r\nlife. But every change impairs it, and after many changes it has\r\nperished for ever. There was no question with her but that she\r\nmust bear her father\'s anger, should he be angry; put up with his\r\ncontinued opposition, should he resolutely oppose her; bear all that\r\nthe countesses of the world might say to her;--for it was thus that\r\nshe thought of Lady Cantrip now. Any retrogression was beyond her\r\npower.\r\n\r\nShe was walking with her father when she first heard of his intended\r\nvisit to London. At that time she had received Mrs. Finn\'s first\r\nletter, but not the second. "I suppose you\'ll see Silverbridge," she\r\nsaid. She knew then that Frank Tregear was living with her brother.\r\n\r\n"I am going up on purpose to see him. He is causing me much\r\nannoyance."\r\n\r\n"Is he extravagant?"\r\n\r\n"It is not that--at present." He winced even as he said this, for he\r\nhad in truth suffered somewhat from demands made upon him for money,\r\nwhich had hurt him not so much by their amount as by their nature.\r\nLord Silverbridge had taken upon himself to "own a horse or two,"\r\nvery much to his father\'s chagrin, and was at this moment part\r\nproprietor of an animal supposed to stand well for the Derby. The\r\nfact was not announced in the papers with his lordship\'s name, but\r\nhis father was aware of it, and did not like it the better because\r\nhis son held the horse in partnership with a certain Major Tifto, who\r\nwas well known in the sporting world.\r\n\r\n"What is it, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Of course he ought to go into Parliament."\r\n\r\n"I think he wishes it himself."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but how? By a piece of extreme good fortune, West Barsetshire\r\nis open to him. The two seats are vacant together. There is hardly\r\nanother agricultural county in England that will return a Liberal,\r\nand I fear I am not asserting too much in saying that no other\r\nLiberal could carry the seat but one of our family."\r\n\r\n"You used to sit for Silverbridge, papa."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did. In those days the county returned four Conservatives.\r\nI cannot explain it all to you, but it is his duty to contest the\r\ncounty on the Liberal side."\r\n\r\n"But if he is a Conservative himself, papa?" asked Lady Mary, who had\r\nhad some political ideas suggested to her own mind by her lover.\r\n\r\n"It is all rubbish. It has come from that young man Tregear, with\r\nwhom he has been associating."\r\n\r\n"But, papa," said Lady Mary, who felt that even in this matter she\r\nwas bound to be firm on what was now her side of the question, "I\r\nsuppose it is as--as--as respectable to be a Conservative as a\r\nLiberal."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that at all," said the Duke angrily.\r\n\r\n"I thought that--the two sides were--"\r\n\r\nShe was going to express an opinion that the two parties might be\r\nsupposed to stand as equal in the respect of the country, when he\r\ninterrupted her. "The Pallisers have always been Liberal. It will be\r\na blow to me, indeed, if Silverbridge deserts his colours. I know\r\nthat as yet he himself has had no deep thoughts on the subject, that\r\nunfortunately he does not give himself much to thinking, and that in\r\nthis matter he is being talked over by a young man whose position in\r\nlife has hardly justified the great intimacy which has existed."\r\n\r\nThis was very far from being comfortable to her, but of course she\r\nsaid nothing in defence of Tregear\'s politics. Nor at present was she\r\ndisposed to say anything as to his position in life, though at some\r\nfuture time she might not be so silent. A few days later they were\r\nagain walking together, when he spoke to her about herself. "I cannot\r\nbear that you should be left here alone while I am away," he said.\r\n\r\n"You will not be long gone, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Only for three or four days now."\r\n\r\n"I shall not mind that, papa."\r\n\r\n"But very probably I may have to go into Barsetshire. Would you not\r\nbe happier if you would let me write to Lady Cantrip, and tell her\r\nthat you will go to her?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa, I think not. There are times when one feels that one ought\r\nto be almost alone. Don\'t you feel that?"\r\n\r\n"I do not wish you to feel it, nor would you do so long if you had\r\nother people around you. With me it is different. I am an old man,\r\nand cannot look for new pleasures in society. It has been the fault\r\nof my life to be too much alone. I do not want to see my children\r\nfollow me in that."\r\n\r\n"It is so very short a time as yet," said she, thinking of her\r\nmother\'s death.\r\n\r\n"But I think that you should be with somebody,--with some woman who\r\nwould be kind to you. I like to see you with books, but books alone\r\nshould not be sufficient at your age." How little, she thought, did\r\nhe know of the state either of her heart or mind! "Do you dislike\r\nLady Cantrip?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know her. I can\'t say that I dislike a person whom I don\'t\r\nthink I ever spoke to, and never saw above once or twice. But how can\r\nI say that I like her?" She did, however, know that Lady Cantrip was\r\na countess all over, and would be shocked at the idea of a daughter\r\nof a Duke of Omnium marrying the younger son of a country squire.\r\nNothing further was then said on the matter, and when the Duke went\r\nto town Lady Mary was left quite alone, with an understanding that if\r\nhe went into Barsetshire he should come back and take her with him.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at his own house in Carlton Terrace about five o\'clock\r\nin the afternoon, and immediately went to his study, intending to\r\ndine and spend the evening there alone. His son had already pleaded\r\nan engagement for that afternoon, but had consented to devote the\r\nfollowing morning to his father\'s wishes. Of the other sojourner in\r\nhis house the Duke had thought nothing; but the other sojourner had\r\nthought very much of the Duke. Frank Tregear was fully possessed of\r\nthat courage which induces a man who knows that he must be thrown\r\nover a precipice, to choose the first possible moment for his fall.\r\nHe had sounded Silverbridge about this change in his politics, and\r\nhad found his friend quite determined not to go back to the family\r\ndoctrine. Such being the case, the Duke\'s ill-will and hardness and\r\ngeneral severity would probably be enhanced by his interview with\r\nhis son. Tregear, therefore, thinking that nothing could be got by\r\ndelay, sent his name in to the Duke before he had been an hour in the\r\nhouse, and asked for an interview. The servant brought back word that\r\nhis Grace was fatigued, but would see Mr. Tregear if the matter in\r\nquestion was one of importance. Frank\'s heart quailed for a moment,\r\nbut only for a moment. He took up a pen and wrote a note.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR DUKE OF OMNIUM,\r\n\r\n   If your Grace can spare a moment, I think you will find\r\n   that what I have to say will justify the intrusion.\r\n\r\n   Your very faithful servant,\r\n\r\n   F. O. TREGEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course the Duke admitted him. There was but one idea in his head\r\nas to what was coming. His son had taken this way of making some\r\ncommunication to him respecting his political creed. Some overture or\r\nsome demand was to be preferred through Tregear. If so, it was proof\r\nof a certain anxiety as to the matter on his son\'s part which was not\r\ndispleasing to him. But he was not left long in this mistake after\r\nTregear had entered the room. "Sir," he said, speaking quite at once,\r\nas soon as the door was closed behind him, but still speaking very\r\nslowly, looking beautiful as Apollo as he stood upright before his\r\nwished-for father-in-law--"Sir, I have come to you to ask you to give\r\nme the hand of your daughter." The few words had been all arranged\r\nbeforehand, and were now spoken without any appearance of fear\r\nor shame. No one hearing them would have imagined that an almost\r\npenniless young gentleman was asking in marriage the daughter of the\r\nrichest and greatest nobleman in England.\r\n\r\n"The hand of my daughter!" said the Duke, rising from his chair.\r\n\r\n"I know how very great is the prize," said Frank, "and how unworthy I\r\nam of it. But--as she thinks me worthy--"\r\n\r\n"She! What she?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Mary."\r\n\r\n"She think you worthy!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, your Grace."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe it." On hearing this, Frank simply bowed his head.\r\n"I beg your pardon, Mr. Tregear. I do not mean to say that I do not\r\nbelieve you. I never yet gave the lie to a gentleman, and I hope\r\nI never may be driven to do so. But there must be some mistake in\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"I am complying with Lady Mary\'s wishes in asking your permission to\r\nenter your house as her suitor." The Duke stood for a moment biting\r\nhis lips in silence. "I cannot believe it," he said at last. "I\r\ncannot bring myself to believe it. There must be some mistake. My\r\ndaughter! Lady Mary Palliser!" Again the young man bowed his head.\r\n"What are your pretensions?"\r\n\r\n"Simply her regard."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is impossible. You are not so ignorant but that you\r\nmust have known as much when you came to me."\r\n\r\nThere was so much scorn in his words, and in the tone in which they\r\nwere uttered, that Tregear in his turn was becoming angry. He had\r\nprepared himself to bow humbly before the great man, before the Duke,\r\nbefore the Croesus, before the late Prime Minister, before the man\r\nwho was to be regarded as certainly one of the most exalted of the\r\nearth; but he had not prepared himself to be looked at as the Duke\r\nlooked at him. "The truth, my Lord Duke, is this," he said, "that\r\nyour daughter loves me, and that we are engaged to each other,--as\r\nfar as that engagement can be made without your sanction as her\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"It cannot have been made at all," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"I can only hope,--we can both of us only hope that a little time may\r\nsoften--"\r\n\r\n"It is out of the question. There must be an end of this altogether.\r\nYou must neither see her, nor hear from her, nor in any way\r\ncommunicate with her. It is altogether impossible. I believe, sir,\r\nthat you have no means?"\r\n\r\n"Very little at present, Duke."\r\n\r\n"How did you think you were to live? But it is altogether unnecessary\r\nto speak of such a matter as that. There are so many reasons to make\r\nthis impossible, that it would be useless to discuss one as being\r\nmore important than others. Has any other one of my family known of\r\nthis?" This he added, wishing to ascertain whether Lord Silverbridge\r\nhad disgraced himself by lending his hand to such a disposition of\r\nhis sister.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Tregear.\r\n\r\n"Who has known it?"\r\n\r\n"The Duchess, sir. We had all her sympathy and approval."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe a word of it," said the Duke, becoming extremely\r\nred in the face. He was forced to do now that which he had just\r\ndeclared that he had never done in his life,--driven by the desire of\r\nhis heart to acquit the wife he had lost of the terrible imprudence,\r\nworse than imprudence, of which she was now accused.\r\n\r\n"That is the second time, my Lord, that you have found it necessary\r\nto tell me that you have not believed direct assertions which I made\r\nyou. But, luckily for me, the two assertions are capable of the\r\nearliest and most direct proof. You will believe Lady Mary, and she\r\nwill confirm me in the one and the other."\r\n\r\nThe Duke was almost beside himself with emotion and grief. He did\r\nknow,--though now at this moment he was most loath to own to himself\r\nthat it was so,--that his dear wife had been the most imprudent of\r\nwomen. And he recognised in her encouragement of this most pernicious\r\ncourtship,--if she had encouraged it,--a repetition of that romantic\r\nfolly by which she had so nearly brought herself to shipwreck in\r\nher own early life. If it had been so,--even whether it had been so\r\nor not,--he had been wrong to tell the man that he did not believe\r\nhim. And the man had rebuked him with dignity. "At any rate it is\r\nimpossible," he repeated.\r\n\r\n"I cannot allow that it is impossible."\r\n\r\n"That is for me to judge, sir."\r\n\r\n"I trust that you will excuse me when I say that I also must hold\r\nmyself to be in some degree a judge in the matter. If you were in my\r\nplace, you would feel--"\r\n\r\n"I could not possibly be in your place."\r\n\r\n"If your Grace were in my place you would feel that as long as you\r\nwere assured by the young lady that your affection was valued by her\r\nyou would not be deterred by the opposition of her father. That you\r\nshould yield to me, of course I do not expect; that Lady Mary should\r\nbe persistent in her present feelings, when she knows your mind,\r\nperhaps I have no right to hope; but should she be so persistent as\r\nto make you feel that her happiness depends, as mine does, on our\r\nmarriage, then I shall believe that you will yield at last."\r\n\r\n"Never!" said the Duke. "Never! I shall never believe that my\r\ndaughter\'s happiness can be assured by a step which I should regard\r\nas disgraceful to her."\r\n\r\n"Disgraceful is a violent word, my Lord."\r\n\r\n"It is the only word that will express my meaning."\r\n\r\n"And one which I must be bold enough to say you are not justified\r\nin using. Should she become my wife to-morrow, no one in England\r\nwould think she had disgraced herself. The Queen would receive her\r\non her marriage. All your friends would hold out their hands to\r\nus,--presuming that we had your goodwill."\r\n\r\n"But you would not have it."\r\n\r\n"Her disgrace would not depend upon that, my Lord. Should your\r\ndaughter so dispose of herself, as to disgrace herself,--which I\r\nthink to be impossible,--your countenance could not set her right.\r\nNor can the withdrawal of your countenance condemn her before the\r\nworld if she does that with herself which any other lady might do and\r\nremain a lady."\r\n\r\nThe Duke, when he heard this, even in the midst of his wrath, which\r\nwas very violent, and in the midst of his anger, which was very\r\nacute, felt that he had to deal with a man,--with one whom he could\r\nnot put off from him into the gutter, and there leave as buried in\r\nthe mud. And there came, too, a feeling upon him, which he had no\r\ntime to analyse, but of which he was part aware, that this terrible\r\nindiscretion on the part of his daughter and of his late wife was\r\nless wonderful than it had at first appeared to be. But not on that\r\naccount was he the less determined to make the young man feel that\r\nhis parental opposition would be invincible.\r\n\r\n"It is quite impossible, sir. I do not think that I need say anything\r\nmore." Then, while Tregear was meditating whether to make any reply,\r\nthe Duke asked a question which had better have been left unasked.\r\nThe asking of it diminished somewhat from that ducal, grand-ducal,\r\nquasi-archducal, almost godlike superiority which he had assumed, and\r\nshowed the curiosity of a mere man. "Has anybody else been aware of\r\nthis?" he said, still wishing to know whether he had cause for anger\r\nagainst Silverbridge in the matter.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Finn is aware of it," answered Tregear.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Finn!" exclaimed the Duke, as though he had been stung by an\r\nadder.\r\n\r\nThis was the woman whom he had prayed to remain awhile with his\r\ndaughter after his wife had been laid in her grave, in order that\r\nthere might be someone near whom he could trust! And this very woman\r\nwhom he had so trusted,--whom, in his early associations with her,\r\nhe had disliked and distrusted, but had taught himself both to\r\nlike and to trust because his wife had loved her,--this woman was\r\nthe she-Pandarus who had managed matters between Tregear and his\r\ndaughter! His wife had been too much subject to her influence. That\r\nhe had always known. And now, in this last act of her life, she\r\nhad allowed herself to be persuaded to give up her daughter by the\r\nbaneful wiles of this most pernicious woman. Such were the workings\r\nof the Duke\'s mind when the young man told him that Mrs. Finn was\r\nacquainted with the whole affair. As the reader is aware, nothing\r\ncould have been more unjust.\r\n\r\n"I mentioned her name," said Tregear, "because I thought she had been\r\na friend of the family."\r\n\r\n"That will do, sir. I have been greatly pained as well as surprised\r\nby what I have heard. Of the real state of the case I can form no\r\nopinion till I see my daughter. You, of course, will hold no further\r\nintercourse with her." He paused as though for a promise, but Tregear\r\ndid not feel himself called upon to say a word in one direction or in\r\nthe other. "It will be my care that you shall not do so.\r\nGood-morning, sir."\r\n\r\nTregear, who during the interview had been standing, then bowed,\r\nturned upon his heel, and left the room.\r\n\r\nThe Duke seated himself, and, crossing his arms upon his chest, sat\r\nfor an hour looking up at the ceiling. Why was it that, for him, such\r\na world of misery had been prepared? What wrong had he done, of what\r\nimprudence had he been guilty, that, at every turn of life, something\r\nshould occur so grievous as to make him think himself the most\r\nwretched of men? No man had ever loved his wife more dearly than he\r\nhad done; and yet now, in that very excess of tenderness which her\r\ndeath had occasioned, he was driven to accuse her of a great sin\r\nagainst himself, in that she had kept from him her knowledge of this\r\naffair;--for, when he came to turn the matter over in his mind, he\r\ndid believe Tregear\'s statement as to her encouragement. Then, too,\r\nhe had been proud of his daughter. He was a man so reticent and\r\nundemonstrative in his manner that he had never known how to make\r\nconfidential friends of his children. In his sons hitherto he had\r\nnot taken pride. They were gallant, well-grown, handsome boys, with\r\na certain dash of cleverness,--more like their mother than their\r\nfather; but they had not as yet done anything as he would have had\r\nthem do it. But the girl, in the perfection of her beauty, in the\r\nquiescence of her manner, in the nature of her studies, and in the\r\ngeneral dignity of her bearing, had seemed to be all that he had\r\ndesired. And now she had engaged herself, behind his back, to the\r\nyounger son of a little county squire!\r\n\r\nBut his anger against Mrs. Finn was hotter than his anger against any\r\none in his own family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMajor Tifto\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Tifto had lately become a member of the Beargarden Club, under\r\nthe auspices of his friend Lord Silverbridge. It was believed, by\r\nthose who had made some inquiry into the matter, that the Major had\r\nreally served a campaign as a volunteer in the Carlist army in the\r\nnorth of Spain. When, therefore, it was declared by someone that\r\nhe was not a major at all, his friends were able to contradict the\r\nassertion, and to impute it to slander. Instances were brought\r\nup,--declared by these friends to be innumerable, but which did, in\r\ntruth, amount to three or four,--of English gentlemen who had come\r\nhome from a former Carlist war, bearing the title of colonel, without\r\nany contradiction or invidious remark. Had this gallant officer\r\nappeared as Colonel Tifto, perhaps less might have been said about\r\nit. There was a little lack of courage in the title which he did\r\nchoose. But it was accepted at last, and, as Major Tifto, he was\r\nproposed, seconded, and elected at the Beargarden.\r\n\r\nBut he had other points in his favour besides the friendship of Lord\r\nSilverbridge,--points which had probably led to that friendship. He\r\nwas, without doubt, one of the best horsemen in England. There were\r\nsome who said that, across country, he was the very best, and that,\r\nas a judge of a hunter, few excelled him. Of late years he had crept\r\ninto credit as a betting-man. No one supposed that he had much\r\ncapital to work with; but still, when he lost a bet he paid it.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return from Spain, he was chosen as Master of the\r\nRunnymede Fox-Hounds, and was thus enabled to write the letters\r\nM.F.H. after his name. The gentlemen who rode with the Runnymede were\r\nnot very liberal in their terms, and had lately been compelled to\r\nchange their Master rather more frequently than was good for that\r\nquasi-suburban hunt; but now they had fitted themselves well. How he\r\nwas to hunt the country five days a fortnight, finding servants and\r\nhorses, and feeding the hounds, for eight hundred pounds a year, no\r\none could understand. But Major Tifto not only undertook to do it,\r\nbut did it. And he actually succeeded in obtaining for the Runnymede\r\na degree of popularity which for many years previous it had not\r\npossessed. Such a man,--even though no one did know anything of his\r\nfather or mother, though no one had ever heard him speak of a brother\r\nor a sister, though it was believed that he had no real income,--was\r\nfelt by many to be the very man for the Beargarden; and when his name\r\nwas brought up at the committee, Lord Silverbridge was able to say so\r\nmuch in his favour that only two blackballs were given against him.\r\nUnder the mild rule of the club, three would have been necessary to\r\nexclude him; and therefore Major Tifto was now as good a member as\r\nany one else.\r\n\r\nHe was a well-made little man, good-looking for those who like such\r\ngood looks. He was light-haired and blue-eyed, with regular and\r\nyet not inexpressive features. But his eyes were small and never\r\ntranquil, and rarely capable of looking at the person who was\r\nspeaking to him. He had small well-trimmed, glossy whiskers, with the\r\nbest-kept moustache, and the best-kept tuft on his chin which were to\r\nbe seen anywhere. His face still bore the freshness of youth, which\r\nwas a marvel to many, who declared that, from facts within their\r\nknowledge, Tifto must be far on the wrong side of forty. At a first\r\nglance you would hardly have called him thirty. No doubt, when, on\r\nclose inspection, you came to look into his eyes, you could see the\r\nhand of time. Even if you believed the common assertion that he\r\npainted,--which it was very hard to believe of a man who passed the\r\nmost of his time in the hunting-field or on a race-course,--yet the\r\npaint on his cheeks would not enable him to move with the elasticity\r\nwhich seemed to belong to all his limbs. He rode flat races and\r\nsteeple chases,--if jump races may still be so called; and with his\r\nown hounds and with the Queen\'s did incredible things on horseback.\r\nHe could jump over chairs too,--the backs of four chairs in a\r\ndining-room after dinner,--a feat which no gentleman of forty-five\r\ncould perform, even though he painted himself ever so.\r\n\r\nSo much in praise of Major Tifto honesty has compelled the present\r\nchronicler to say. But there were traits of character in which he\r\nfell off a little, even in the estimation of those whose pursuits\r\nendeared him to them. He could not refrain from boasting,--and\r\nespecially from boasting about women. His desire for glory in that\r\ndirection knew no bounds, and he would sometimes mention names, and\r\nbring himself into trouble. It was told of him that at one period of\r\nhis life, when misfortune had almost overcome him, when sorrow had\r\nproduced prostration, and prostration some expression of truth, he\r\nhad owned to a friend his own conviction that could he have kept\r\nhis tongue from talking of women, he might have risen to prosperity\r\nin his profession. From these misfortunes he had emerged, and, no\r\ndoubt, had often reflected on what he himself had then said. But\r\nwe know that the drunkard, though he hates drunkenness, cannot but\r\ndrink,--that the gambler cannot keep from the dice. Major Tifto still\r\nlied about women, and could not keep his tongue from the subject. He\r\nwould boast, too, about other matters,--much to his own disadvantage.\r\nHe was, too, very "deep", and some men, who could put up with his\r\nother failings, could not endure that. Whatever he wanted to do he\r\nwould attempt round three corners. Though he could ride straight,\r\nhe could do nothing else straight. He was full of mysteries. If he\r\nwanted to draw Charter Wood he would take his hounds out of the\r\nstreet at Egham directly in the other direction. If he had made up\r\nhis mind to ride Lord Pottlepot\'s horse for the great Leamington\r\nhandicap, he would be sure to tell even his intimate friends that he\r\nwas almost determined to take the "baronet\'s" offer of a mount. This\r\nhe would do even where there was no possible turn in the betting to\r\nbe affected by such falsehood. So that his companions were apt to\r\ncomplain that there was no knowing where to have Tifto. And then,\r\nthey who were old enough in the world to have had some experience in\r\nmen, had perceived that peculiar quality of his eyes, which never\r\nallowed him to look any one in the face.\r\n\r\nThat Major Tifto should make money by selling horses was, perhaps, a\r\nnecessity of his position. No one grumbled at him because he did so,\r\nor thought that such a pursuit was incompatible with his character as\r\na sporting gentleman. But there were some who considered that they\r\nhad suffered unduly under his hands, and in their bargains with\r\nhim had been made to pay more than a proper amount of tax for the\r\nadvantages of his general assistance. When a man has perhaps made\r\nfifty pounds by using a "straight tip" as to a horse at Newmarket,\r\nin doing which he had of course encountered some risks, he feels\r\nhe ought not to be made to pay the amount back into the pockets of\r\nthe "tipper," and at the same time to find himself saddled with the\r\npossession of a perfectly useless animal. In this way there were\r\nrocks in the course through which Tifto was called on to steer his\r\nbark. Of course he was anxious, when preying upon his acquaintances,\r\nto spare those who were useful friends to him. Now and again he would\r\nsell a serviceable animal at a fair price, and would endeavour to\r\nmake such sale in favour of someone whose countenance would be a rock\r\nto him. He knew his business well, but yet there would be mistakes.\r\n\r\nNow, at this very moment, was the culmination of the Major\'s life. He\r\nwas Master of the Runnymede Hounds, he was partner with the eldest\r\nson of a Duke in the possession of that magnificent colt, the Prime\r\nMinister, and he was a member of the Beargarden. He was a man who\r\nhad often been despondent about himself, but was now disposed to\r\nbe a little triumphant. He had finished his season well with the\r\nRunnymede, and were it not that, let him work as he would, his\r\nexpenses always exceeded his means, he would have been fairly\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\'clock Lord Silverbridge and his friend met in the\r\ndining-room of the Beargarden. "Have you been here before?" asked the\r\nLord.\r\n\r\n"Not in here, my Lord. I just looked in at the smoking-room last\r\nnight. Glasslough and Nidderdale were there. I thought we should have\r\ngot up a rubber, but they didn\'t seem to see it."\r\n\r\n"There is whist here generally. You\'ll find out all about it before\r\nlong. Perhaps they are a little afraid of you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m the worst hand at cards, I suppose, in England. A dash at loo\r\nfor about an hour, and half-a-dozen cuts at blind hookey,--that\'s\r\nabout my form. I know I drop more than I pick up. If I knew what I\r\nwas about I should never touch a card."\r\n\r\n"Horses; eh, Tifto?"\r\n\r\n"Horses, yes. They\'ve pretty good claret, here, eh, Silverbridge?" He\r\ncould never hit off his familiarity quite right. He had my-Lorded his\r\nyoung friend at first, and now brought out the name with a hesitating\r\ntwang, which the young nobleman appreciated. But then the young\r\nnobleman was quite aware that the Major was a friend for club\r\npurposes, and sporting purposes, and not for home use.\r\n\r\n"Everything of that kind is pretty good here," said the Lord.\r\n\r\n"You were saying--horses."\r\n\r\n"I dare say you do better with them than with cards."\r\n\r\n"If I didn\'t I don\'t know where I should be, seeing what a lot pass\r\nthrough my hands in the year. Any one of our fellows who has a horse\r\nto sell thinks that I am bound to buy him. And I do buy \'em. Last May\r\nI had forty-two hunters on my hands."\r\n\r\n"How many of them have you got now?"\r\n\r\n"Three. Three of that lot,--though a goodish many have come up since.\r\nBut what does it amount to? When I have anything that is very good,\r\nsome fellow that I like gets him from me."\r\n\r\n"After paying for him."\r\n\r\n"After paying for him! Yes; I don\'t mean that I make a fellow a\r\npresent. But the man who buys has a deal the best of it. Did you ever\r\nget anything better than that spotted chestnut in your life?"\r\n\r\n"What, old Sarcinet?"\r\n\r\n"You had her for one hundred and sixty pounds. Now, if you were on\r\nyour oath, what is she worth?"\r\n\r\n"She suits me, Major, and of course I shouldn\'t sell her."\r\n\r\n"I rather think not. I knew what that mare was, well enough. A dealer\r\nwould have had three hundred and fifty pounds for her. I could have\r\ngot the money easily if I had taken her down into the shires, and\r\nridden her a day or two myself."\r\n\r\n"I gave you what you asked."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you did. It isn\'t often that I take less than I ask. But the\r\nfact is, about horses, I don\'t know whether I shouldn\'t do better if\r\nI never owned an animal at all but those I want for my own use. When\r\nI am dealing with a man I call a friend, I can\'t bear to make money\r\nof him. I don\'t think fellows give me all the credit they should do\r\nfor sticking to them."\r\n\r\nThe Major, as he said this, leaned back in his chair, put his hand up\r\nto his moustache, and looked sadly away into the vacancy of the room,\r\nas though he was meditating sorrowfully on the ingratitude of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it\'s all right about Cream Cheese?" asked the Lord.\r\n\r\n"Well; it ought to be." And now the Major spoke like an oracle,\r\nleaning forward on the table, uttering his words in a low voice,\r\nbut very plainly, so that not a syllable might be lost. "When you\r\nremember how he ran at the Craven with 9 st. 12 lb. on him, that it\r\ntook Archbishop all he knew to beat him with only 9 st. 2 lb., and\r\nwhat the lot at Chester are likely to be, I don\'t think that there\r\ncan be seven to one against him. I should be very glad to take it off\r\nyour hands, only the figures are a little too heavy for me."\r\n\r\n"I suppose Sunflower\'ll be the best animal there?"\r\n\r\n"Not a doubt of it, if he\'s all right, and if his temper will stand.\r\nThink what a course Chester is for an ill-conditioned brute like\r\nthat! And then he\'s the most uncertain horse in training. There are\r\ntimes he won\'t feed. From what I hear, I shouldn\'t wonder if he don\'t\r\nturn up at all."\r\n\r\n"Solomon says he\'s all right."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t get Solomon to take four to one against him, nor yet four\r\nand a half. I suppose you\'ll go down, my Lord?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; if there\'s nothing else doing just then. I don\'t know how\r\nit may be about this electioneering business. I shall go and smoke\r\nupstairs."\r\n\r\nAt the Beargarden there were,--I was going to say, two smoking-rooms;\r\nbut in truth the house was a smoking-room all over. It was, however,\r\nthe custom of those who habitually played cards, to have their cigars\r\nand coffee upstairs. Into this sanctum Major Tifto had not yet been\r\nintroduced, but now he was taken there under Lord Silverbridge\'s\r\nwing. There were already four or five assembled, among whom was Mr.\r\nAdolphus Longstaff, a young man of about thirty-five years of age,\r\nwho spent very much of his time at the Beargarden. "Do you know my\r\nfriend Tifto?" said the Lord. "Tifto, this is Mr. Longstaff, whom men\r\nwithin the walls of this asylum sometimes call Dolly." Whereupon the\r\nMajor bowed and smiled graciously.\r\n\r\n"I have heard of Major Tifto," said Dolly.\r\n\r\n"Who has not?" said Lord Nidderdale, another middle-aged young man,\r\nwho made one of the company. Again the Major bowed.\r\n\r\n"Last season I was always intending to get down to your country and\r\nhave a day with the Tiftoes," said Dolly. "Don\'t they call your\r\nhounds the Tiftoes?"\r\n\r\n"They shall be called so if you like," said the Major. "And why\r\ndidn\'t you come?"\r\n\r\n"It always was such a grind."\r\n\r\n"Train down from Paddington every day at half-past ten."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well if you happen to be up. Well, Silverbridge,\r\nhow\'s the Prime Minister?"\r\n\r\n"How is he, Tifto?" asked the noble partner.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there\'s a man in England just at present enjoying a\r\nvery much better state of health," said the Major pleasantly.\r\n\r\n"Safe to run?" asked Dolly.\r\n\r\n"Safe to run! Why shouldn\'t he be safe to run?"\r\n\r\n"I mean sure to start."\r\n\r\n"I think we mean him to start, don\'t we, Silverbridge?" said the\r\nMajor.\r\n\r\nThere was something perhaps in the tone in which the last remark was\r\nmade which jarred a little against the young lord\'s dignity. At any\r\nrate he got up and declared his purpose of going to the opera. He\r\nshould look in, he said, and hear a song from Mdlle Stuffa. Mdlle\r\nStuffa was the nightingale of the season, and Lord Silverbridge, when\r\nhe had nothing else to do, would sometimes think that he was fond of\r\nmusic. Soon after he was gone Major Tifto had some whisky-and-water,\r\nlit his third cigar, and began to feel the glory of belonging to\r\nthe Beargarden. With Lord Silverbridge, to whom it was essentially\r\nnecessary that he should make himself agreeable at all times, he\r\nwas somewhat overweighted as it were. Though he attempted an easy\r\nfamiliarity, he was a little afraid of Lord Silverbridge. With\r\nDolly Longstaff he felt that he might be comfortable,--not, perhaps,\r\nunderstanding that gentleman\'s character. With Lord Nidderdale he had\r\npreviously been acquainted, and had found him to be good-natured. So,\r\nas he sipped his whisky, he became confidential and comfortable.\r\n\r\n"I never thought so much about her good looks," he said. They were\r\ntalking of the singer, the charms of whose voice had carried Lord\r\nSilverbridge away.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see her off the stage?" asked Nidderdale.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear yes."\r\n\r\n"She does not go about very much, I fancy," said someone.\r\n\r\n"I dare say not," said Tifto. "But she and I have had a day or two\r\ntogether, for all that."\r\n\r\n"You must have been very much favoured," said Dolly.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been pals ever since she has been over here," said Tifto, with\r\nan enormous lie.\r\n\r\n"How do you get on with her husband?" asked Dolly,--in the simplest\r\nvoice, as though not in the least surprised at his companion\'s\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n"Husband!" exclaimed the Major; who was not possessed of sufficient\r\npresence of mind to suppress all signs of his ignorance.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Dolly; "you are not probably aware that your pal has been\r\nmarried to Mr. Thomas Jones for the last year and a half." Soon after\r\nthat Major Tifto left the club,--with considerably enhanced respect\r\nfor Mr. Longstaff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nConservative Convictions\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge had engaged himself to be with his father the next\r\nmorning at half-past nine, and he entered the breakfast-room a very\r\nfew minutes after that hour. He had made up his mind as to what he\r\nwould say to his father. He meant to call himself a Conservative, and\r\nto go into the House of Commons under that denomination. All the men\r\namong whom he lived were Conservatives. It was a matter on which,\r\nas he thought, his father could have no right to control him. Down\r\nin Barsetshire, as well as up in London, there was some little\r\ndifference of opinion in this matter. The people of Silverbridge\r\ndeclared that they would prefer to have a Conservative member, as\r\nindeed they had one for the last Session. They had loyally returned\r\nthe Duke himself while he was a commoner, but they had returned him\r\nas being part and parcel of the Omnium appendages. That was all over\r\nnow. As a constituency they were not endowed with advanced views, and\r\nthought that a Conservative would suit them best. That being so, and\r\nas they had been told that the Duke\'s son was a Conservative, they\r\nfancied that by electing him they would be pleasing everybody. But,\r\nin truth, by so doing they would by no means please the Duke. He\r\nhad told them on previous occasions that they might elect whom they\r\npleased, and felt no anger because they had elected a Conservative.\r\nThey might send up to Parliament the most antediluvian old Tory\r\nthey could find in England if they wished, only not his son, not a\r\nPalliser as a Tory or Conservative. And then, though the little town\r\nhad gone back in the ways of the world, the county, or the Duke\'s\r\ndivision of the county, had made so much progress, that a Liberal\r\ncandidate recommended by him would almost certainly be returned. It\r\nwas just the occasion on which a Palliser should show himself ready\r\nto serve his country. There would be an expense, but he would think\r\nnothing of expense in such a matter. Ten thousand pounds spent on\r\nsuch an object would not vex him. The very contest would have given\r\nhim new life. All this Lord Silverbridge understood, but had said to\r\nhimself and to all his friends that it was a matter in which he did\r\nnot intend to be controlled.\r\n\r\nThe Duke had passed a very unhappy night. He had told himself that\r\nany such marriage as that spoken of was out of the question. He\r\nbelieved that the matter might be so represented to his girl as to\r\nmake her feel that it was out of the question. He hardly doubted but\r\nthat he could stamp it out. Though he should have to take her away\r\ninto some further corner of the world, he would stamp it out. But\r\nshe, when this foolish passion of hers should have been thus stamped\r\nout, could never be the pure, the bright, the unsullied, unsoiled\r\nthing, of the possession of which he had thought so much. He had\r\nnever spoken of his hopes about her even to his wife, but in the\r\nsilence of his very silent life he had thought much of the day when\r\nhe would give her to some noble youth,--noble with all gifts of\r\nnobility, including rank and wealth,--who might be fit to receive\r\nher. Now, even though no one else should know it,--and all would\r\nknow it,--she would be the girl who had condescended to love young\r\nTregear.\r\n\r\nHis own Duchess, she whose loss to him now was as though he had lost\r\nhalf his limbs,--had not she in the same way loved a Tregear, or\r\nworse than a Tregear, in her early days? Ah yes! And though his Cora\r\nhad been so much to him, had he not often felt, had he not been\r\nfeeling all his days, that Fate had robbed him of the sweetest joy\r\nthat is given to man, in that she had not come to him loving him with\r\nher early spring of love, as she had loved that poor ne\'er-do-well?\r\nHow infinite had been his regrets. How often had he told himself\r\nthat, with all that Fortune had given him, still Fortune had been\r\nunjust to him because he had been robbed of that. Not to save his\r\nlife could he have whispered a word of this to any one, but he had\r\nfelt it. He had felt it for years. Dear as she had been, she had not\r\nbeen quite what she should have been but for that. And now this girl\r\nof his, who was so much dearer to him than anything else left to him,\r\nwas doing exactly as her mother had done. The young man might be\r\nstamped out. He might be made to vanish as that other young man had\r\nvanished. But the fact that he had been there, cherished in the\r\ngirl\'s heart,--that could not be stamped out.\r\n\r\nHe struggled gallantly to acquit the memory of his wife. He could\r\nbest do that by leaning with the full weight of his mind on the\r\npresumed iniquity of Mrs. Finn. Had he not known from the first that\r\nthe woman was an adventuress? And had he not declared to himself over\r\nand over again that between such a one and himself there should be no\r\nintercourse, no common feeling? He had allowed himself to be talked\r\ninto an intimacy, to be talked almost into an affection. And this was\r\nthe result!\r\n\r\nAnd how should he treat this matter in his coming interview with his\r\nson;--or should he make an allusion to it? At first it seemed as\r\nthough it would be impossible for him to give his mind to that other\r\nsubject. How could he enforce the merits of political Liberalism,\r\nand the duty of adhering to the old family party, while his mind was\r\nentirely preoccupied with his daughter? It had suddenly become almost\r\nindifferent to him whether Silverbridge should be a Conservative or a\r\nLiberal. But as he dressed he told himself that, as a man, he ought\r\nto be able to do a plain duty, marked out for him as this had been by\r\nhis own judgment, without regard to personal suffering. The hedger\r\nand ditcher must make his hedge and clean his ditch even though he be\r\ntormented by rheumatism. His duty by his son he must do, even though\r\nhis heart were torn to pieces.\r\n\r\nDuring breakfast he tried to be gracious, and condescended to ask his\r\nson a question about Prime Minister. Racing was an amusement to which\r\nEnglish noblemen had been addicted for many ages, and had been held\r\nto be serviceable rather than disgraceful, if conducted in a noble\r\nfashion. He did not credit Tifto with much nobility. He knew but\r\nlittle about the Major. He would much have preferred that his son\r\nshould have owned a horse alone, if he must have anything to do with\r\nownership. "Would it not be better to buy the other share?" asked the\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\n"It would take a deal of money, sir. The Major would ask a couple of\r\nthousand, I should think."\r\n\r\n"That is a great deal."\r\n\r\n"And then the Major is a very useful man. He thoroughly understands\r\nthe turf."\r\n\r\n"I hope he doesn\'t live by it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; he doesn\'t live by it. That is, he has a great many irons in\r\nthe fire."\r\n\r\n"I do not mind a young man owning a horse, if he can afford the\r\nexpense,--as you perhaps can do; but I hope you don\'t bet."\r\n\r\n"Nothing to speak of."\r\n\r\n"Nothing to speak of is so apt to grow into that which has to be\r\nspoken of." So much the father said at breakfast, hardly giving his\r\nmind to the matter discussed,--his mind being on other things. But\r\nwhen their breakfast was eaten, then it was necessary that he should\r\nbegin. "Silverbridge," he said, "I hope you have thought better of\r\nwhat we were talking about as to these coming elections."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir;--of course I have thought about it."\r\n\r\n"And you can do as I would have you?"\r\n\r\n"You see, sir, a man\'s political opinion is a kind of thing he can\'t\r\nget rid of."\r\n\r\n"You can hardly as yet have any very confirmed political opinion.\r\nYou are still young, and I do not suppose that you have thought much\r\nabout politics."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir; I think I have. I\'ve got my own ideas. We\'ve got to\r\nprotect our position as well as we can against the Radicals and\r\nCommunists."\r\n\r\n"I cannot admit that at all, Silverbridge. There is no great\r\npolitical party in this country anxious either for Communism or for\r\nrevolution. But, putting all that aside for the present, do you think\r\nthat a man\'s political opinions should be held in regard to his own\r\nindividual interests, or to the much wider interests of others, whom\r\nwe call the public?"\r\n\r\n"To his own interest," said the young man with decision.\r\n\r\n"It is simply self-protection then?"\r\n\r\n"His own and his class. The people will look after themselves, and we\r\nmust look after ourselves. We are so few and they are so many, that\r\nwe shall have quite enough to do."\r\n\r\nThen the Duke gave his son a somewhat lengthy political lecture,\r\nwhich was intended to teach him that the greatest benefit of the\r\ngreatest number was the object to which all political studies should\r\ntend. The son listened to it with attention, and when it was over,\r\nexpressed his opinion that there was a great deal in what his father\r\nhad said. "I trust, if you will consider it," said the Duke, "that\r\nyou will not find yourself obliged to desert the school of politics\r\nin which your father has not been an inactive supporter, and to which\r\nyour family has belonged for many generations."\r\n\r\n"I could not call myself a Liberal," said the young politician.\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because I am a Conservative."\r\n\r\n"And you won\'t stand for the county on the Liberal interest?"\r\n\r\n"I should be obliged to tell them that I should always give a\r\nConservative vote."\r\n\r\n"Then you refuse to do what I ask?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know how I can help refusing. If you wanted me to grow a\r\ncouple of inches taller I couldn\'t do it, even though I should be\r\never so anxious to oblige you."\r\n\r\n"But a very young man, as you are, may have so much deference for his\r\nelders as to be induced to believe that he has been in error."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; of course."\r\n\r\n"You cannot but be aware that the political condition of the country\r\nis the one subject to which I have devoted the labour of my life."\r\n\r\n"I know that very well; and, of course, I know how much they all\r\nthink of you."\r\n\r\n"Then my opinion might go for something with you?"\r\n\r\n"So it does, sir; I shouldn\'t have doubted at all only for that\r\nlittle. Still, you see, as the thing is,--how am I to help myself?"\r\n\r\n"You believe that you must be right,--you, who have never given an\r\nhour\'s study to the subject!"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. In comparison with a great many men, I know that I am a\r\nfool. Perhaps it is because I know that, that I am a Conservative.\r\nThe Radicals are always saying that a Conservative must be a fool.\r\nThen a fool ought to be a Conservative."\r\n\r\nHereupon the father got up from his chair and turned round, facing\r\nthe fire, with his back to his son. He was becoming very angry, but\r\nendeavoured to restrain his anger. The matter in dispute between them\r\nwas of so great importance, that he could hardly be justified in\r\nabandoning it in consequence of arguments so trifling in themselves\r\nas these which his son adduced. As he stood there for some minutes\r\nthinking of it all, he was tempted again and again to burst out in\r\nwrath and threaten the lad,--to threaten him as to money, as to his\r\namusements, as to the general tenure of his life. The pity was so\r\ngreat that the lad should be so stubborn and so foolish! He would\r\nnever ask his son to be a slave to the Liberal party, as he had been.\r\nBut that a Palliser should not be a Liberal,--and his son, as the\r\nfirst recreant Palliser,--was wormwood to him! As he stood there\r\nhe more than once clenched his fist in eager desire to turn upon\r\nthe young man; but he restrained himself, telling himself that in\r\njustice he should not be angry for such offence as this. To become a\r\nConservative, when the path to Liberalism was so fairly open, might\r\nbe the part of a fool, but could not fairly be imputed as a crime. To\r\nendeavour to be just was the study of his life, and in no condition\r\nof life can justice be more imperatively due than from a father to\r\nhis son.\r\n\r\n"You mean to stand for Silverbridge?" he said at last.\r\n\r\n"Not if you object, sir."\r\n\r\nThis made it worse. It became now still more difficult for him to\r\nscold the young man.\r\n\r\n"You are aware that I should not meddle in any way."\r\n\r\n"That was what I supposed. They will return a Conservative at any\r\nrate."\r\n\r\n"It is not that I care about," said the Duke sadly.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, sir, I am very sorry to vex you; but what would you\r\nhave me do? I will give up Parliament altogether, if you say that you\r\nwish it."\r\n\r\n"No; I do not wish that."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t have me tell a lie?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"What can I do then?"\r\n\r\n"Learn what there is to learn from some master fit to teach you."\r\n\r\n"There are so many masters."\r\n\r\n"I believe it to be that most arrogant ill-behaved young man who was\r\nwith me yesterday who has done this evil."\r\n\r\n"You mean Frank Tregear?"\r\n\r\n"I do mean Mr. Tregear."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a Conservative, of course; and of course he and I have been\r\nmuch together. Was he with you yesterday, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he was."\r\n\r\n"What was that about?" asked Lord Silverbridge, in a voice that\r\nalmost betrayed fear, for he knew very well what cause had produced\r\nthe interview.\r\n\r\n"He has been speaking to me--" When the Duke had got so far as this\r\nhe paused, finding himself to be hardly able to declare the disgrace\r\nwhich had fallen upon himself and his family. As he did tell the\r\nstory, both his face and his voice were altered, so that the son, in\r\ntruth, was scared. "He has been speaking to me about your sister. Did\r\nyou know of this?"\r\n\r\n"I knew there was something between them."\r\n\r\n"And you encouraged it?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; just the contrary. I have told him that I was quite sure it\r\nwould never do."\r\n\r\n"And why did you not tell me?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir; that was hardly my business, was it?"\r\n\r\n"Not to guard the honour of your sister?"\r\n\r\n"You see, sir, how many things have happened all at once."\r\n\r\n"What things?"\r\n\r\n"My dear mother, sir, thought well of him." The Duke uttered a deep\r\nsigh and turned again round to the fire. "I always told him that you\r\nwould never consent."\r\n\r\n"I should think not."\r\n\r\n"It has come so suddenly. I should have spoken to you about it as\r\nsoon as--as soon as--" He had meant to say as soon as the husband\'s\r\ngrief for the loss of his wife had been in some degree appeased, but\r\nhe could not speak the words. The Duke, however, perfectly understood\r\nhim. "In the meantime, they were not seeing each other."\r\n\r\n"Nor writing?"\r\n\r\n"I think not."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Finn has known it all."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Finn!"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. She has known it all through."\r\n\r\n"I do not see how it can have been so."\r\n\r\n"He told me so himself," said the Duke, unwittingly putting words\r\ninto Tregear\'s mouth which Tregear had never uttered. "There must be\r\nan end of this. I will speak to your sister. In the meantime, the\r\nless, I think, you see of Mr. Tregear the better. Of course it is out\r\nof the question he should be allowed to remain in this house. You\r\nwill make him understand that at once, if you please."\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n"He Is a Gentleman"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke returned to Matching an almost broken-hearted man. He had\r\nintended to go down into Barsetshire, in reference to the coming\r\nelections;--not with the view of interfering in any unlordly, or\r\nrather unpeerlike fashion, but thinking that if his eldest son were\r\nto stand for the county in a proper constitutional spirit, as the\r\neldest son of so great a county magnate ought to do, his presence at\r\nGatherum Castle, among his own people, might probably be serviceable,\r\nand would certainly be gracious. There would be no question of\r\nentertainment. His bereavement would make that impossible. But there\r\nwould come from his presence a certain savour of proprietorship,\r\nand a sense of power, which would be beneficial to his son, and\r\nwould not, as the Duke thought, be contrary to the spirit of the\r\nconstitution. But all this was now at an end. He told himself that he\r\ndid not care how the elections might go;--that he did not care much\r\nhow anything might go. Silverbridge might stand for Silverbridge\r\nif he so pleased. He would give neither assistance nor obstruction,\r\neither in the county or in the borough. He wrote to this effect to\r\nhis agent, Mr. Morton;--but at the same time desired that gentleman\r\nto pay Lord Silverbridge\'s electioneering expenses, feeling it to be\r\nhis duty as a father to do so much for his son.\r\n\r\nBut though he endeavoured to engage his thoughts in these\r\nparliamentary matters, though he tried to make himself believe that\r\nthis political apostasy was the trouble which vexed him, in truth\r\nthat other misery was so crushing, as to make the affairs of his son\r\ninsignificant. How should he express himself to her? That was the\r\nthought present to his mind as he went down to Matching. Should he\r\ncontent himself with simply telling her that such a wish on her part\r\nwas disgraceful, and that it could never be fulfilled; or should he\r\nargue the matter with her, endeavouring as he did so to persuade her\r\ngently that she was wrong to place her affections so low, and so to\r\nobtain from her an assurance that the idea should be abandoned?\r\n\r\nThe latter course would be infinitely the better,--if only he could\r\naccomplish it. But he was conscious of his own hardness of manner,\r\nand was aware that he had never succeeded in establishing confidence\r\nbetween himself and his daughter. It was a thing for which he had\r\nlonged,--as a plain girl might long to possess the charms of an\r\nacknowledged beauty;--as a poor little fellow, five feet in height,\r\nmight long to have a cubit added to his stature.\r\n\r\nThough he was angry with her, how willingly would he take her into\r\nhis arms and assure her of his forgiveness! How anxious he would\r\nbe to make her understand that nothing should be spared by him to\r\nadd beauty and grace to her life! Only, as a matter of course, Mr.\r\nTregear must be abandoned. But he knew of himself that he would not\r\nknow how to begin to be tender and forgiving. He knew that he would\r\nnot know how not to be stern and hard.\r\n\r\nBut he must find out the history of it all. No doubt the man had been\r\nhis son\'s friend, and had joined his party in Italy at his son\'s\r\ninstance. But yet he had come to entertain an idea that Mrs. Finn had\r\nbeen the great promoter of the sin, and he thought that Tregear had\r\ntold him that that lady had been concerned with the matter from the\r\nbeginning. In all this there was a craving in his heart to lessen the\r\namount of culpable responsibility which might seem to attach itself\r\nto the wife he had lost.\r\n\r\nHe reached Matching about eight, and ordered his dinner to be brought\r\nto him in his own study. When Lady Mary came to welcome him, he\r\nkissed her forehead and bade her come to him after his dinner. "Shall\r\nI not sit with you, papa, whilst you are eating it?" she asked; but\r\nhe merely told her that he would not trouble her to do that. Even\r\nin saying this he was so unusually tender to her that she assured\r\nherself that her lover had not as yet told his tale.\r\n\r\nThe Duke\'s meals were not generally feasts for a Lucullus. No man\r\nliving, perhaps, cared less what he ate, or knew less what he drank.\r\nIn such matters he took what was provided for him, making his dinner\r\noff the first bit of meat that was brought, and simply ignoring\r\nanything offered to him afterwards. And he would drink what wine\r\nthe servant gave him, mixing it, whatever it might be, with seltzer\r\nwater. He had never been much given to the pleasures of the table;\r\nbut this habit of simplicity had grown on him of late, till the\r\nDuchess used to tell him that his wants were so few that it was a\r\npity he was not a hermit, vowed to poverty.\r\n\r\nVery shortly a message was brought to Lady Mary, saying that her\r\nfather wished to see her. She went at once, and found him seated on\r\na sofa, which stood close along the bookshelves on one side of the\r\nroom. The table had already been cleared, and he was alone. He not\r\nonly was alone, but had not even a pamphlet or newspaper in his hand.\r\n\r\nThen she knew that Tregear must have told the story. As this occurred\r\nto her, her legs almost gave way under her. "Come and sit down,\r\nMary," he said, pointing to the seat on the sofa beside himself.\r\n\r\nShe sat down and took one of his hands within her own. Then, as he\r\ndid not begin at once, she asked a question. "Will Silverbridge stand\r\nfor the county, papa?"\r\n\r\n"No, my dear."\r\n\r\n"But for the town?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear."\r\n\r\n"And he won\'t be a Liberal?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid not. It is a cause of great unhappiness to me; but I do\r\nnot know that I should be justified in any absolute opposition. A man\r\nis entitled to his own opinion, even though he be a very young man."\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry that it should be so, papa, because it vexes you."\r\n\r\n"I have many things to vex me;--things to break my heart."\r\n\r\n"Poor mamma!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Yes; that above all others. But life and death are in God\'s hands,\r\nand even though we may complain we can alter nothing. But whatever\r\nour sorrows are while we are here, we must do our duty."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he may be a good Member of Parliament, though he has\r\nturned Conservative."\r\n\r\n"I am not thinking about your brother. I am thinking about you."\r\nThe poor girl gave a little start on the sofa. "Do you know--Mr.\r\nTregear?" he added.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa; of course I know him. You used to see him in Italy."\r\n\r\n"I believe I did; I understand that he was there as a friend of\r\nSilverbridge."\r\n\r\n"His most intimate friend, papa."\r\n\r\n"I dare say. He came to me, in London yesterday, and told me--! Oh\r\nMary, can it be true?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa," she said, covered up to her forehead with blushes, and\r\nwith her eyes turned down. In the ordinary affairs of life she was\r\na girl of great courage, who was not given to be shaken from her\r\nconstancy by the pressure of any present difficulty; but now the\r\nterror inspired by her father\'s voice almost overpowered her.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to tell me that you have engaged yourself to that young\r\nman without my approval?"\r\n\r\n"Of course you were to have been asked, papa."\r\n\r\n"Is that in accordance with your idea of what should be the conduct\r\nof a young lady in your position?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody meant to conceal anything from you, papa."\r\n\r\n"It has been so far concealed. And yet this young man has the\r\nself-confidence to come to me and to demand your hand as though it\r\nwere a matter of course that I should accede to so trivial a request.\r\nIt is, as a matter of course, quite impossible. You understand that;\r\ndo you not?" When she did not answer him at once, he repeated the\r\nquestion. "I ask you whether you do not feel that it is altogether\r\nimpossible?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa," she said, in the lowest possible whisper, but still\r\nin such a whisper that he could hear the word, and with so much\r\nclearness that he could judge from her voice of the obstinacy of her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n"Then, Mary, it becomes my duty to tell you that it is quite\r\nimpossible. I will not have it thought of. There must be an end of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Why, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Why! I am astonished that you should ask me why."\r\n\r\n"I should not have allowed him, papa, to go to you unless I\r\nhad,--unless I had loved him."\r\n\r\n"Then you must conquer your love. It is disgraceful and must be\r\nconquered."\r\n\r\n"Disgraceful!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I am sorry to use such a word to my own child, but it is so.\r\nIf you will promise to be guided by me in this matter, if you will\r\nundertake not to see him any more, I will,--if not forget it,--at\r\nany rate pardon it, and be silent. I will excuse it because you were\r\nyoung, and were thrown imprudently in his way. There has, I believe,\r\nbeen someone at work in the matter with whom I ought to be more\r\nangry than with you. Say that you will obey me, and there is nothing\r\nwithin a father\'s power that I will not do for you, to make your\r\nlife happy." It was thus that he strove not to be stern. His heart,\r\nindeed, was tender enough, but there was nothing tender in the tone\r\nof his voice or in the glance of his eye. Though he was very positive\r\nin what he said, yet he was shy and shamefaced even with his own\r\ndaughter. He, too, had blushed when he told her that she must conquer\r\nher love.\r\n\r\nThat she should be told that she had disgraced herself was terrible\r\nto her. That her father should speak of her marriage with this man as\r\nan event that was impossible made her very unhappy. That he should\r\ntalk of pardoning her, as for some great fault, was in itself a\r\nmisery. But she had not on that account the least idea of giving up\r\nher lover. Young as she was, she had her own peculiar theory on that\r\nmatter, her own code of conduct and honour, from which she did not\r\nmean to be driven. Of course she had not expected that her father\r\nwould yield at the first word. He, no doubt, would wish that she\r\nshould make a more exalted marriage. She had known that she would\r\nhave to encounter opposition, though she had not expected to be told\r\nthat she had disgraced herself. As she sat there she resolved that\r\nunder no pretence would she give up her lover;--but she was so far\r\nabashed that she could not find words to express herself. He, too,\r\nhad been silent for a few moments before he again asked her for her\r\npromise.\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me, Mary, that you will not see him again?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that I can say that, papa."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Oh papa, how can I, when of all the people in the world I love him\r\nthe best?"\r\n\r\nIt is not without a pang that any one can be told that she who is of\r\nall the dearest has some other one who to her is the dearest. Such\r\npain fathers and mothers have to bear; and though, I think, the arrow\r\nis never so blunted but that it leaves something of a wound behind,\r\nthere is in most cases, if not a perfect salve, still an ample\r\nconsolation. The mother knows that it is good that her child should\r\nlove some man better than all the world beside, and that she should\r\nbe taken away to become a wife and a mother. And the father, when\r\nthat delight of his eyes ceases to assure him that he is her nearest\r\nand dearest, though he abandon the treasure of that nearestness and\r\ndearestness with a soft melancholy, still knows that it is as it\r\nshould be. Of course that other "him" is the person she loves the\r\nbest in the world. Were it not so how evil a thing it would be that\r\nshe should marry him! Were it not so with reference to some "him",\r\nhow void would her life be! But now, to the poor Duke the wound had\r\nno salve, no consolation. When he was told that this young Tregear\r\nwas the owner of his girl\'s sweet love, was the treasure of her\r\nheart, he shrank as though arrows with sharp points were pricking him\r\nall over. "I will not hear of such love," he said.\r\n\r\n"What am I to say, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Say that you will obey me."\r\n\r\nThen she sat silent. "Do you not know that he is not fit to be your\r\nhusband?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa."\r\n\r\n"Then you cannot have thought much either of your position or of\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"He is a gentleman, papa."\r\n\r\n"So is my private secretary. There is not a clerk in one of our\r\npublic offices who does not consider himself to be a gentleman. The\r\ncurate of the parish is a gentleman, and the medical man who comes\r\nhere from Bradstock. The word is too vague to carry with it any\r\nmeaning that ought to be serviceable to you in thinking of such a\r\nmatter."\r\n\r\n"I do not know any other way of dividing people," said she, showing\r\nthereby that she had altogether made up her mind as to what ought to\r\nbe serviceable to her.\r\n\r\n"You are not called upon to divide people. That division requires so\r\nmuch experience that you are bound in this matter to rely upon those\r\nto whom your obedience is due. I cannot but think you must have known\r\nthat you were not entitled to give your love to any man without being\r\nassured that the man would be approved of by--by--by me." He was\r\ngoing to say, "your parents," but was stopped by the remembrance of\r\nhis wife\'s imprudence.\r\n\r\nShe saw it all, and was too noble to plead her mother\'s authority.\r\nBut she was not too dutiful to cast a reproach upon him, when he was\r\nso stern to her. "You have been so little with me, papa."\r\n\r\n"That is true," he said, after a pause. "That is true. It has been a\r\nfault, and I will mend it. It is a reason for forgiveness, and I will\r\nforgive you. But you must tell me that there shall be an end to\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"No, papa."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"That as I love Mr. Tregear, and as I have told him so, and as I have\r\npromised him, I will be true to him. I cannot let there be an end to\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You do not suppose that you will be allowed to see him again?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"Most assuredly not. Do you write to him?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa."\r\n\r\n"Never?"\r\n\r\n"Never since we have been back in England."\r\n\r\n"You must promise me that you will not write."\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment before she answered him, and now she was looking\r\nhim full in the face. "I shall not write to him. I do not think I\r\nshall write to him; but I will not promise."\r\n\r\n"Not promise me,--your father!"\r\n\r\n"No, papa. It might be that--that I should do it."\r\n\r\n"You would not wish me so to guard you that you should have no power\r\nof sending a letter but by permission?"\r\n\r\n"I should not like that."\r\n\r\n"But it will have to be so."\r\n\r\n"If I do write I will tell you."\r\n\r\n"And show me what you write?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa; not that; but I will tell you what I have written."\r\n\r\nThen it occurred to him that this bargaining was altogether\r\nderogatory to his parental authority, and by no means likely to\r\nimpress upon her mind the conviction that Tregear must be completely\r\nbanished from her thoughts. He began already to find how difficult\r\nit would be for him to have the charge of such a daughter,--how\r\nimpossible that he should conduct such a charge with sufficient\r\nfirmness, and yet with sufficient tenderness! At present he had\r\ndone no good. He had only been made more wretched than ever by\r\nher obstinacy. Surely he must pass her over to the charge of some\r\nlady,--but of some lady who would be as determined as was he himself\r\nthat she should not throw herself away by marrying Mr. Tregear.\r\n\r\n"There shall be no writing," he said, "no visiting, no communication\r\nof any kind. As you refuse to obey me now, you had better go to your\r\nroom."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n"In Medias Res"\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the method of rushing at once "in medias res" is, of all the\r\nways of beginning a story, or a separate branch of a story, the least\r\nobjectionable. The reader is made to think that the gold lies so near\r\nthe surface that he will be required to take very little trouble in\r\ndigging for it. And the writer is enabled,--at any rate for a time,\r\nand till his neck has become, as it were, warm to the collar,--to\r\nthrow off from him the difficulties and dangers, the tedium and\r\nprolixity, of description. This rushing "in medias res" has doubtless\r\nthe charm of ease. "Certainly, when I threw her from the garret\r\nwindow to the stony pavement below, I did not anticipate that she\r\nwould fall so far without injury to life or limb." When a story\r\nhas been begun after this fashion, without any prelude, without\r\ndescription of the garret or of the pavement, or of the lady thrown,\r\nor of the speaker, a great amount of trouble seems to have been\r\nsaved. The mind of the reader fills up the blanks,--if erroneously,\r\nstill satisfactorily. He knows, at least, that the heroine has\r\nencountered a terrible danger, and has escaped from it with almost\r\nincredible good fortune; that the demon of the piece is a bold demon,\r\nnot ashamed to speak of his own iniquity, and that the heroine\r\nand the demon are so far united that they have been in a garret\r\ntogether. But there is the drawback on the system,--that it is almost\r\nimpossible to avoid the necessity of doing, sooner or later, that\r\nwhich would naturally be done at first. It answers, perhaps, for\r\nhalf-a-dozen chapters;--and to carry the reader pleasantly for\r\nhalf-a-dozen chapters is a great matter!--but after that a certain\r\nnebulous darkness gradually seems to envelope the characters and\r\nthe incidents. "Is all this going on in the country, or is it in\r\ntown,--or perhaps in the Colonies? How old was she? Was she tall? Is\r\nshe fair? Is she heroine-like in her form and gait? And, after all,\r\nhow high was the garret window?" I have always found that the details\r\nwould insist on being told at last, and that by rushing "in medias\r\nres" I was simply presenting the cart before the horse. But as\r\nreaders like the cart the best, I will do it once again,--trying it\r\nonly for a branch of my story,--and will endeavour to let as little\r\nas possible of the horse be seen afterwards.\r\n\r\n"And so poor Frank has been turned out of heaven?" said Lady Mabel\r\nGrex to young Lord Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Who told you that? I have said nothing about it to anybody."\r\n\r\n"Of course he told me himself," said the young beauty. I am aware\r\nthat, in the word beauty, and perhaps, also, in the word young, a\r\nlittle bit of the horse is appearing; and I am already sure that I\r\nshall have to show his head and neck, even if not his very tail.\r\n"Poor Frank! Did you hear it all?"\r\n\r\n"I heard nothing, Lady Mab, and know nothing."\r\n\r\n"You know that your awful governor won\'t let him stay any longer in\r\nCarlton Terrace?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know that."\r\n\r\n"And why not?"\r\n\r\n"Would Lord Grex allow Percival to have his friends living here?"\r\nEarl Grex was Lady Mabel\'s father, Lord Percival was the Earl\'s\r\nson;--and the Earl lived in Belgrave Square. All these are little\r\nbits of the horse.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. In the first place, I am here."\r\n\r\n"That makes a difference, certainly."\r\n\r\n"Of course it makes a difference. They would be wanting to make love\r\nto me."\r\n\r\n"No doubt. I should, I know."\r\n\r\n"And therefore it wouldn\'t do for you to live here; and then papa is\r\nliving here himself. And then the permission never has been given. I\r\nsuppose Frank did not go there at first without the Duke knowing it."\r\n\r\n"I daresay that I had mentioned it."\r\n\r\n"You might as well tell me all about it. We are cousins, you know."\r\nFrank Tregear, through his mother\'s family, was second cousin to Lady\r\nMabel; as was also Lord Silverbridge, one of the Grexes having, at\r\nsome remote period, married a Palliser. This is another bit of the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n"The governor merely seemed to think that he would like to have his\r\nown house to himself--like other people. What an ass Tregear was to\r\nsay anything to you about it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he was an ass at all. Of course he had to tell us that\r\nhe was changing his residence. He says that he is going to take a\r\nback bedroom somewhere near the Seven Dials."\r\n\r\n"He has got very nice rooms in Duke Street."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen him, then?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I have."\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow! I wish he had a little money; he is so nice. And now,\r\nLord Silverbridge, do you mean to say that there is not something in\r\nthe wind about Lady Mary?"\r\n\r\n"If there were I should not talk about it," said Lord Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"You are a very innocent young gentleman."\r\n\r\n"And you are a very interesting young lady."\r\n\r\n"You ought to think me so, for I interest myself very much about you.\r\nWas the Duke very angry about your not standing for the county?"\r\n\r\n"He was vexed."\r\n\r\n"I do think it is so odd that a man should be expected to be this or\r\nthat in politics because his father happened to be so before him! I\r\ndon\'t understand how he should expect that you should remain with\r\na party so utterly snobbish and down in the world as the Radicals.\r\nEverybody that is worth anything is leaving them."\r\n\r\n"He has not left them."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t suppose he could; but you have."\r\n\r\n"I never belonged to them, Lady Mab."\r\n\r\n"And never will, I hope. I always told papa that you would certainly\r\nbe one of us." All this took place in the drawing-room of Lord Grex\'s\r\nhouse. There was no Lady Grex alive, but there lived with the Earl\r\na certain elderly lady, reported to be in some distant way a cousin\r\nof the family, named Miss Cassewary, who, in the matter of looking\r\nafter Lady Mab, did what was supposed to be absolutely necessary. She\r\nnow entered the room with her bonnet on, having just returned from\r\nchurch. "What was the text?" asked Lady Mab at once.\r\n\r\n"If you had gone to church, as you ought to have done, my dear, you\r\nwould have heard it."\r\n\r\n"But as I didn\'t?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think the text alone will do you any good."\r\n\r\n"And probably you forget it."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t, my dear. How do you do, Lord Silverbridge?"\r\n\r\n"He is a Conservative, Miss Cass."\r\n\r\n"Of course he is. I am quite sure that a young nobleman of so much\r\ntaste and intellect would take the better side."\r\n\r\n"You forget that all you are saying is against my father and my\r\nfamily, Miss Cassewary."\r\n\r\n"I dare say it was different when your father was a young man.\r\nAnd your father, too, was, not very long since, at the head of a\r\ngovernment which contained many Conservatives. I don\'t look upon your\r\nfather as a Radical, though perhaps I should not be justified in\r\ncalling him a Conservative."\r\n\r\n"Well; certainly not, I think."\r\n\r\n"But now it is necessary that all noblemen in England should rally to\r\nthe defence of their order." Miss Cassewary was a great politician,\r\nand was one of those who are always foreseeing the ruin of their\r\ncountry. "My dear, I will go and take my bonnet off. Perhaps you will\r\nhave tea when I come down."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you go," said Lady Mabel, when Silverbridge got up to take his\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n"I always do when tea comes."\r\n\r\n"But you are going to dine here?"\r\n\r\n"Not that I know of. In the first place, nobody has asked me. In the\r\nsecond place, I am engaged. Thirdly, I don\'t care about having to\r\ntalk politics to Miss Cass; and fourthly, I hate family dinners on\r\nSunday."\r\n\r\n"In the first place, I ask you. Secondly, I know you were going\r\nto dine with Frank Tregear, at the club. Thirdly, I want you to\r\ntalk to me, and not to Miss Cass. And fourthly, you are an uncivil\r\nyoung--young,--young,--I should say cub if I dared, to tell me that\r\nyou don\'t like dining with me any day of the week."\r\n\r\n"Of course you know what I mean is, that I don\'t like troubling your\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"Leave that to me. I shall tell him you are coming, and Frank too. Of\r\ncourse you can bring him. Then he can talk to me when papa goes down\r\nto his club, and you can arrange your politics with Miss Cass." So\r\nit was settled, and at eight o\'clock Lord Silverbridge reappeared in\r\nBelgrave Square with Frank Tregear.\r\n\r\nEarl Grex was a nobleman of very ancient family, the Grexes having\r\nheld the parish of Grex, in Yorkshire, from some time long prior to\r\nthe Conquest. In saying all this, I am, I know, allowing the horse to\r\nappear wholesale;--but I find that he cannot be kept out. I may as\r\nwell go on to say that the present Earl was better known at Newmarket\r\nand the Beaufort,--where he spent a large part of his life in playing\r\nwhist,--than in the House of Lords. He was a grey-haired, handsome,\r\nworn-out old man, who through a long life of pleasure had greatly\r\nimpaired a fortune which, for an earl, had never been magnificent,\r\nand who now strove hard, but not always successfully, to remedy that\r\nevil by gambling. As he could no longer eat and drink as he had used\r\nto do, and as he cared no longer for the light that lies in a lady\'s\r\neye, there was not much left to him in the world but cards and\r\nracing. Nevertheless he was a handsome old man, of polished manners,\r\nwhen he chose to use them; a staunch Conservative and much regarded\r\nby his party, for whom in his early life he had done some work in the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\n"Silverbridge is all very well," he had said; "but I don\'t see why\r\nthat young Tregear is to dine here every night of his life."\r\n\r\n"This is the second time since he has been up in town, papa."\r\n\r\n"He was here last week, I know."\r\n\r\n"Silverbridge wouldn\'t come without him."\r\n\r\n"That\'s d---- nonsense," said the Earl. Miss Cassewary gave a\r\nstart,--not, we may presume, because she was shocked, for she could\r\nnot be much shocked, having heard the same word from the same lips\r\nvery often; but she thought it right always to enter a protest. Then\r\nthe two young men were announced.\r\n\r\nFrank Tregear, having been known by the family as a boy, was Frank\r\nto all of them,--as was Lady Mabel, Mabel to him, somewhat to the\r\ndisgust of the father and not altogether with the approbation of Miss\r\nCass. But Lady Mabel had declared that she would not be guilty of the\r\nfolly of changing old habits. Silverbridge, being Silverbridge to\r\nall his own people, hardly seemed to have a Christian name;--his\r\ngodfathers and godmothers had indeed called him Plantagenet;--but\r\nhaving only become acquainted with the family since his Oxford days\r\nhe was Lord Silverbridge to Lady Mabel. Lady Mabel had not as yet\r\nbecome Mabel to him, but, as by her very intimate friends she was\r\ncalled Mab, had allowed herself to be addressed by him as Lady Mab.\r\nThere was thus between them all considerable intimacy.\r\n\r\n"I\'m deuced glad to hear it," said the Earl when dinner was\r\nannounced. For, though he could not eat much, Lord Grex was always\r\nimpatient when the time of eating was at hand. Then he walked down\r\nalone. Lord Silverbridge followed with his daughter, and Frank\r\nTregear gave his arm to Miss Cassewary. "If that woman can\'t clear\r\nher soup better than that, she might as well go to the d----,"\r\nsaid the Earl;--upon which remark no one in the company made any\r\nobservation. As there were two men-servants in the room when it was\r\nmade the cook probably had the advantage of it. It may be almost\r\nunnecessary to add that though the Earl had polished manners for\r\ncertain occasions he would sometimes throw them off in the bosom of\r\nhis own family.\r\n\r\n"My Lord," said Miss Cassewary--she always called him "My\r\nLord"--"Lord Silverbridge is going to stand for the Duke\'s borough in\r\nthe Conservative interest."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know the Duke had a borough," said the Earl.\r\n\r\n"He had one till he thought it proper to give it up," said the son,\r\ntaking his father\'s part.\r\n\r\n"And you are going to pay him off for what he has done by standing\r\nagainst him. It\'s just the sort of thing for a son to do in these\r\ndays. If I had a borough Percival would go down and make radical\r\nspeeches there."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t a better Conservative in England than Percival," said\r\nLady Mabel, bridling up.\r\n\r\n"Nor a worse son," said the father. "I believe he would do anything\r\nhe could lay his hand on to oppose me." During the past week there\r\nhad been some little difference of opinion between the father and the\r\nson as to the signing of a deed.\r\n\r\n"My father does not take it in bad part at all," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he\'s ratting himself," said the Earl. "When a man lends\r\nhimself to a coalition he is as good as half gone."\r\n\r\n"I do not think that in all England there is so thorough a Liberal as\r\nmy father," said Lord Silverbridge. "And when I say that he doesn\'t\r\ntake this badly, I don\'t mean that it doesn\'t vex him. I know it\r\nvexes him. But he doesn\'t quarrel with me. He even wrote down to\r\nBarsetshire to say that all my expenses at Silverbridge were to be\r\npaid."\r\n\r\n"I call that very bad politics," said the Earl.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me to be very grand," said Frank.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, sir, you don\'t know what is good or what is bad in\r\npolitics," said the Earl, trying to snub his guest.\r\n\r\nBut it was difficult to snub Frank. "I know a gentleman when I see\r\nhim, I think," he said. "Of course Silverbridge is right to be a\r\nConservative. Nobody has a stronger opinion about that than I have.\r\nBut the Duke is behaving so well that if I were he I should almost\r\nregret it."\r\n\r\n"And so I do," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies were gone the old Earl turned himself round to the\r\nfire, having filled his glass and pushed the bottles away from him,\r\nas though he meant to leave the two young men to themselves. He sat\r\nleaning with his head on his hand, looking the picture of woe. It was\r\nnow only nine o\'clock, and there would be no whist at the Beaufort\r\ntill eleven. There was still more than an hour to be endured before\r\nthe brougham would come to fetch him. "I suppose we shall have a\r\nmajority," said Frank, trying to rouse him.\r\n\r\n"Who does \'We\' mean?" asked the Earl.\r\n\r\n"The Conservatives, of whom I take the liberty to call myself one."\r\n\r\n"It sounded as though you were a very influential member of the\r\nparty."\r\n\r\n"I consider myself to be one of the party, and so I say \'We.\'"\r\n\r\nUpstairs in the drawing-room Miss Cassewary did her duty loyally.\r\nIt was quite right that young ladies and young gentlemen should be\r\nallowed to talk together, and very right indeed that such a young\r\ngentleman as Lord Silverbridge should be allowed to talk to such a\r\nyoung lady as Lady Mabel. What could be so nice as a marriage between\r\nthe heir of the house of Omnium and Lady Mabel Grex? Lady Mabel\r\nlooked indeed to be the elder,--but they were in truth the same\r\nage. All the world acknowledged that Lady Mabel was very clever and\r\nvery beautiful and fit to be a Duchess. Even the Earl, when Miss\r\nCassewary hinted at the matter to him, grunted an assent. Lady Mabel\r\nhad already refused one or two not ineligible offers, and it was\r\nnecessary that something should be done. There had been at one time a\r\nfear in Miss Cassewary\'s bosom lest her charge should fall too deeply\r\nin love with Frank Tregear;--but Miss Cassewary knew that whatever\r\ndanger there might have been in that respect had passed away. Frank\r\nwas willing to talk to her, while Mabel and Lord Silverbridge were in\r\na corner together.\r\n\r\n"I shall be on tenterhooks now till I know how it is to be at\r\nSilverbridge," said the young lady.\r\n\r\n"It is very good of you to feel so much interest."\r\n\r\n"Of course I feel an interest. Are not you one of us? When is it to\r\nbe?"\r\n\r\n"They say that the elections will be over before the Derby."\r\n\r\n"And which do you care for the most?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to pull off the Derby, I own."\r\n\r\n"From what papa says, I should think the other event is the more\r\nprobable."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t the Earl stand to win on Prime Minister?"\r\n\r\n"I never know anything about his betting. But,--you know his way,--he\r\nsaid you were going to drop a lot of money like a-- I can\'t quite\r\ntell you what he likened you to."\r\n\r\n"The Earl may be mistaken."\r\n\r\n"You are not betting much, I hope."\r\n\r\n"Not plunging. But I have a little money on."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t get into a way of betting."\r\n\r\n"Why:--what difference does it make,--to you?"\r\n\r\n"Is that kind, Lord Silverbridge?"\r\n\r\n"I meant to say that if I did make a mess of it you wouldn\'t care\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I should. I should care very much. I dare say you could lose a\r\ngreat deal of money and care nothing about it."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I could not."\r\n\r\n"What would be a great deal of money to me. But you would want to get\r\nit back again. And in that way you would be regularly on the turf."\r\n\r\n"And why not?"\r\n\r\n"I want to see better things from you."\r\n\r\n"You ought not to preach against the turf, Lady Mab."\r\n\r\n"Because of papa? But I am not preaching against the turf. If I were\r\nsuch as you are I would have a horse or two myself. A man in your\r\nposition should do a little of everything. You should hunt and have a\r\nyacht, and stalk deer and keep your own trainer at Newmarket."\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d say all that to my father."\r\n\r\n"Of course I mean if you can afford it. I like a man to like\r\npleasure. But I despise a man who makes a business of his pleasures.\r\nWhen I hear that this man is the best whist-player in London, and\r\nthat man the best billiard-player, I always know that they can do\r\nnothing else, and then I despise them."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t despise me, because I do nothing well," said he, as he\r\ngot up to take his leave.\r\n\r\n"I do so hope you\'ll get the seat,--and win the Derby."\r\n\r\nThese were her last words to him as she wished him good-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n"Why Not Like Romeo If I Feel Like Romeo?"\r\n\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, Miss Cass, and I shall," said Lady Mabel. They were\r\ntogether, on the morning after the little dinner-party described in\r\nthe last chapter, in a small back sitting-room which was supposed to\r\nbe Lady Mabel\'s own, and the servant had just announced the fact that\r\nMr. Tregear was below.\r\n\r\n"Then I shall go down too," said Miss Cassewary.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll do nothing of the kind. Will you please to tell me what it is\r\nyou are afraid of? Do you think that Frank is going to make love to\r\nme again?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Or that if I chose that he should I would let you stop me? He is\r\nin love with somebody else,--and perhaps I am too. And we are two\r\npaupers."\r\n\r\n"My lord would not approve of it."\r\n\r\n"If you know what my lord approves of and what he disapproves you\r\nunderstand him a great deal better than I do. And if you mind what\r\nhe approves or disapproves, you care for his opinion a great deal\r\nmore than I do. My cousin is here now to talk to me,--about his own\r\naffairs, and I mean to see him,--alone." Then she left the little\r\nroom, and went down to that in which Frank was waiting for her,\r\nwithout the company of Miss Cassewary.\r\n\r\n"Do you really mean," she said after they had been together for some\r\nminutes, "that you had the courage to ask the Duke for his daughter\'s\r\nhand?"\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"I believe you would dare do anything."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t very well take it without asking him."\r\n\r\n"As I am not acquainted with the young lady I don\'t know how that\r\nmight be."\r\n\r\n"And if I took her so, I should have to take her empty-handed."\r\n\r\n"Which wouldn\'t suit;--would it?"\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t suit for her,--whose comforts and happiness are much\r\nmore to me than my own."\r\n\r\n"No doubt! Of course you are terribly in love."\r\n\r\n"Very thoroughly in love, I think, I am."\r\n\r\n"For the tenth time, I should say."\r\n\r\n"For the second only. I don\'t regard myself as a monument of\r\nconstancy, but I think I am less fickle than some other people."\r\n\r\n"Meaning me!"\r\n\r\n"Not especially."\r\n\r\n"Frank, that is ill-natured, and almost unmanly,--and false also.\r\nWhen have I been fickle? You say that there was one before with you.\r\nI say that there has never really been one with me at all. No one\r\nknows that better than yourself. I cannot afford to be in love till I\r\nam quite sure that the man is fit to be, and will be, my husband."\r\n\r\n"I doubt sometimes whether you are capable of being in love with any\r\none."\r\n\r\n"I think I am," she said, very gently. "But I am at any rate capable\r\nof not being in love till I wish it. Come, Frank; do not quarrel with\r\nme. You know,--you ought to know,--that I should have loved you had\r\nit not been that such love would have been bad for both of us."\r\n\r\n"It is a kind of self-restraint I do not understand."\r\n\r\n"Because you are not a woman."\r\n\r\n"Why did you twit me with changing my love?"\r\n\r\n"Because I am a woman. Can\'t you forgive as much as that to me?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Only you must not think that I have been false because I\r\nnow love her so dearly."\r\n\r\n"I do not think you are false. I would do anything to help you if\r\nthere were anything I could do. But when you spoke so like a Romeo of\r\nyour love--"\r\n\r\n"Why not like a Romeo, if I feel like a Romeo?"\r\n\r\n"But I doubt whether Romeo talked much to Rosaline of his love for\r\nJuliet. But you shall talk to me of yours for Lady Mary, and I will\r\nlisten to you patiently and encourage you, and will not even think of\r\nthose former vows."\r\n\r\n"The former vows were foolish."\r\n\r\n"Oh,--of course."\r\n\r\n"You at least used to say so."\r\n\r\n"I say so now, and they shall be as though they had been never\r\nspoken. So you bearded the Duke in his den, and asked him for Lady\r\nMary\'s hand,--just as though you had been a young Duke yourself and\r\nowned half a county?"\r\n\r\n"Just the same."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say?"\r\n\r\n"He swore that it was impossible.--Of course I knew all that before."\r\n\r\n"How will it be now? You will not give it up?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"And Lady Mary?"\r\n\r\n"One human being can perhaps never answer for another with perfect\r\nsecurity."\r\n\r\n"But you feel sure of her?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"He, I should think, can be very imperious."\r\n\r\n"And so can she. The Pallisers are all obstinate."\r\n\r\n"Is Silverbridge obstinate?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Stiff-necked as a bull if he takes it into his head to be so."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t have thought it."\r\n\r\n"No;--because he is so soft in his manner, and often finds it easier\r\nto be led by others than to direct himself."\r\n\r\nThen she remained silent for a few seconds. They were both thinking\r\nof the same thing, and both wishing to speak of it. But the words\r\ncame to her first. "I wonder what he thinks of me." Whereupon Tregear\r\nonly smiled. "I suppose he has spoken to you about me?"\r\n\r\n"Why do you ask?"\r\n\r\n"Why!"\r\n\r\n"And why should I tell you? Suppose he should have said to me in the\r\nconfidence of friendship that he thinks you ugly and stupid."\r\n\r\n"I am sure he has not said that. He has eyes to see and ears to hear.\r\nBut, though I am neither ugly nor stupid, he needn\'t like me."\r\n\r\n"Do you want him to like you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do. Oh yes; you may laugh; but if I did not think that I\r\ncould be a good wife to him I would not take his hand even to become\r\nDuchess of Omnium."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you love him, Mabel?"\r\n\r\n"No; I do not mean that. But I would learn to love him. You do not\r\nbelieve that?" Here he smiled again and shook his head. "It is as I\r\nsaid before, because you are not a woman, and do not understand how\r\nwomen are trammelled. Do you think ill of me because I say this?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Do not think ill of me if you can help it, because you are almost\r\nthe only friend that I can trust. I almost trust dear old Cass, but\r\nnot quite. She is old-fashioned and I shock her. As for other women,\r\nthere isn\'t one anywhere to whom I would say a word. Only think how\r\na girl such as I am is placed; or indeed any girl. You, if you see\r\na woman that you fancy, can pursue her, can win her and triumph, or\r\nlose her and gnaw your heart;--at any rate you can do something. You\r\ncan tell her that you love her; can tell her so again and again even\r\nthough she should scorn you. You can set yourself about the business\r\nyou have taken in hand and can work hard at it. What can a girl do?"\r\n\r\n"Girls work hard too sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Of course they do;--but everybody feels that they are sinning\r\nagainst their sex. Of love, such as a man\'s is, a woman ought to know\r\nnothing. How can she love with passion when she should never give her\r\nlove till it has been asked, and not then unless her friends tell her\r\nthat the thing is suitable? Love such as that to me is out of the\r\nquestion. But, as it is fit that I should be married, I wish to be\r\nmarried well."\r\n\r\n"And you will love him after a fashion?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--after a very sterling fashion. I will make his wishes my\r\nwishes, his ways my ways, his party my party, his home my home,\r\nhis ambition my ambition,--his honour my honour." As she said this\r\nshe stood up with her hands clenched and head erect, and her eyes\r\nflashing. "Do you not know me well enough to be sure that I should be\r\nloyal to him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I think that you would be loyal."\r\n\r\n"Whether I loved him or not, he should love me."\r\n\r\n"And you think that Silverbridge would do?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think that Silverbridge would do. You, no doubt, will say\r\nthat I am flying high?"\r\n\r\n"Not too high. Why should you not fly high? If I can justify myself,\r\nsurely I cannot accuse you."\r\n\r\n"It is hardly the same thing, Frank. Of course, there is not a girl\r\nin London to whom Lord Silverbridge would not be the best match that\r\nshe could make. He has the choice of us all."\r\n\r\n"Most girls would think twice before refusing him."\r\n\r\n"Very few would think twice before accepting him. Perhaps he wishes\r\nto add to his wealth by marrying richly,--as his father did."\r\n\r\n"No thought on that subject will ever trouble him. That will be all\r\nas it happens. As soon as he takes a sufficient fancy to a girl he\r\nwill ask her straight off. I do not say that he might not change\r\nafterwards, but he would mean it at the time."\r\n\r\n"If he had once said the word to me, he should not change. But then\r\nwhat right have I to expect it? What has he ever said about me?"\r\n\r\n"Very little. But had he said much I should not tell you."\r\n\r\n"You are my friend,--but you are his too; and he, perhaps, is more to\r\nyou than I am. As his friend it may be your duty to tell him all that\r\nI am saying. If so, I have been wrong."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that I shall do that, Mabel?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. Men are so strong in their friendships."\r\n\r\n"Mine with you is the older, and the sweeter. Though we may not be\r\nmore than friends, I will say that it is the more tender. In my heart\r\nof hearts I do not think that Silverbridge could do better."\r\n\r\n"Thanks for that, Frank."\r\n\r\n"I shall tell him nothing of you that can set him against you."\r\n\r\n"And you would be glad to see me his wife?" she said.\r\n\r\n"As you must be somebody\'s wife, and not mine."\r\n\r\n"I cannot be yours, Frank; can I?"\r\n\r\n"And not mine," he repeated. "I will endeavour to be glad. Who can\r\nexplain his feelings in such a matter? Though I most truly love the\r\ngirl I hope to marry, yet my heart goes back to former things and\r\nopens itself to past regrets."\r\n\r\n"I know it all," she whispered.\r\n\r\n"But you and I must be too wise to permit ourselves to be tormented\r\nby such foolish melancholy." As he said this he took her hand, half\r\nwith the purpose of bidding her good-bye, but partly with the idea of\r\ngiving some expression to the tenderness of his feelings. But as he\r\ndid so, the door was opened, and the old Earl shambled into the room.\r\n\r\n"What the deuce are you doing here?" he said.\r\n\r\n"I have been talking to Lady Mabel."\r\n\r\n"For about an hour."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do not know for how long."\r\n\r\n"Papa, he is going to be married." When she said this Frank Tregear\r\nturned round and looked at her almost in anger.\r\n\r\n"Going to be married, is he? Who is the fortunate woman?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he will let me tell you."\r\n\r\n"Not yet, I think," said Frank, gloomily. "There is nothing settled."\r\n\r\nThe old Earl looked puzzled, but Lady Mabel\'s craft had been\r\nsuccessful. If this objectionable young second-cousin had come there\r\nto talk about his marriage with another young woman, the conversation\r\nmust have been innocent. "Where is Miss Cassewary?" asked the Earl.\r\n\r\n"I asked her not to come down with me because Frank wished to speak\r\nto me about his own affairs. You have no objection to his coming,\r\npapa?"\r\n\r\nThere had been objections raised to any intimacy with Frank Tregear;\r\nbut all that was now nearly two years since. He had been assured over\r\nand over again by Miss Cassewary that he need not be afraid of Frank\r\nTregear, and had in a sort of way assented to the young man\'s visits.\r\n"I think he might find something better to do with his time than\r\nhanging about here all day." Frank, shrugging his shoulders, and\r\nhaving shaken hands both with the daughter and father, took his hat\r\nand departed. "Who is the girl?" asked the Earl.\r\n\r\n"You heard him say that I was not to tell."\r\n\r\n"Has she got money?"\r\n\r\n"I believe she will have a great deal."\r\n\r\n"Then she is a great fool for her pains," said the Earl, shambling\r\noff again.\r\n\r\nLady Mabel spent the greater part of the afternoon alone,\r\nendeavouring to recall to her mind all that she had said to Frank\r\nTregear, and questioning herself as to the wisdom and truth of her\r\nown words. She had intended to tell the truth,--but hardly perhaps\r\nthe whole truth. The life which was before her,--which it was\r\nnecessary that she should lead,--seemed to her to be so difficult!\r\nShe could not clearly see her way to be pure and good and feminine,\r\nand at the same time wise. She had been false now;--so far false that\r\nshe had told her friend that she had never been in love. But she was\r\nin love;--in love with him, Frank Tregear. She knew it as thoroughly\r\nas it was possible for her to know anything;--and had acknowledged it\r\nto herself a score of times.\r\n\r\nBut she could not marry him. And it was expected, nay, almost\r\nnecessary that she should marry someone. To that someone, how good\r\nshe would be! How she would strive by duty and attention, and if\r\npossible by affection, to make up for that misfortune of her early\r\nlove!\r\n\r\nAnd so I hope that I have brought my cart in to its appointed place\r\nin the front, without showing too much of the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n"Cruel"\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two or three days after the first scene between the Duke and his\r\ndaughter,--that scene in which she was forbidden either to see or\r\nto write to her lover,--not a word was said at Matching about Mr.\r\nTregear, nor were any steps taken towards curtailing her liberty\r\nof action. She had said she would not write to him without telling\r\nher father, and the Duke was too proud of the honour of his family\r\nto believe it to be possible that she should deceive him. Nor was\r\nit possible. Not only would her own idea of duty prevent her from\r\nwriting to her lover, although she had stipulated for the right to do\r\nso in some possible emergency,--but, carried far beyond that in her\r\nsense of what was right and wrong, she felt it now incumbent on her\r\nto have no secret from her father at all. The secret, as long as it\r\nhad been a secret, had been a legacy from her mother,--and had been\r\nkept, at her lover\'s instance, during that period of mourning for\r\nher mother in which it would, she thought, have been indecorous that\r\nthere should be any question of love or of giving in marriage. It had\r\nbeen a burden to her, though a necessary burden. She had been very\r\nclear that the revelation should be made to her father, when it was\r\nmade, by her lover. That had been done,--and now it was open to her\r\nto live without any secrecy,--as was her nature. She meant to cling\r\nto her lover. She was quite sure of that. Nothing could divide her\r\nfrom him but his death or hers,--or falseness on his part. But as\r\nto marriage, that would not be possible till her father had assented.\r\nAnd as to seeing the man,--ah, yes, if she could do so with her\r\nfather\'s assent! She would not be ashamed to own her great desire to\r\nsee him. She would tell her father that all her happiness depended\r\nupon seeing him. She would not be coy in speaking of her love. But\r\nshe would obey her father.\r\n\r\nShe had a strong idea that she would ultimately prevail,--an idea\r\nalso that that "ultimately" should not be postponed to some undefined\r\nmiddle-aged period of her life. As she intended to belong to Frank\r\nTregear, she thought it expedient that he should have the best of\r\nher days as well as what might be supposed to be the worst; and she\r\ntherefore resolved that it would be her duty to make her father\r\nunderstand that though she would certainly obey him, she would look\r\nto be treated humanely by him, and not to be made miserable for an\r\nindefinite term of years.\r\n\r\nThe first word spoken between them on the subject,--the first word\r\nafter that discussion,--began with him and was caused by his feeling\r\nthat her present life at Matching must be sad and lonely. Lady\r\nCantrip had again written that she would be delighted to take\r\nher;--but Lady Cantrip was in London and must be in London, at any\r\nrate when Parliament should again be sitting. A London life would\r\nperhaps, at present, hardly suit Lady Mary. Then a plan had been\r\nprepared which might be convenient. The Duke had a house at Richmond,\r\non the river, called The Horns. That should be lent to Lady Cantrip,\r\nand Mary should there be her guest. So it was settled between the\r\nDuke and Lady Cantrip. But as yet Lady Mary knew nothing of the\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n"I think I shall go up to town to-morrow," said the Duke to his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n"For long?"\r\n\r\n"I shall be gone only one night. It is on your behalf that I am\r\ngoing."\r\n\r\n"On my behalf, papa?"\r\n\r\n"I have been writing to Lady Cantrip."\r\n\r\n"Not about Mr. Tregear?"\r\n\r\n"No;--not about Mr. Tregear," said the father with a mixture of anger\r\nand solemnity in his tone. "It is my desire to regard Mr. Tregear as\r\nthough he did not exist."\r\n\r\n"That is not possible, papa."\r\n\r\n"I have alluded to the inconvenience of your position here."\r\n\r\n"Why is it inconvenient?"\r\n\r\n"You are too young to be without a companion. It is not fit that you\r\nshould be so much alone."\r\n\r\n"I do not feel it."\r\n\r\n"It is very melancholy for you, and cannot be good for you. They will\r\ngo down to The Horns, so that you will not be absolutely in London,\r\nand you will find Lady Cantrip a very nice person."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care for new people just now, papa," she said. But to\r\nthis he paid but little heed; nor was she prepared to say that she\r\nwould not do as he directed. When therefore he left Matching, she\r\nunderstood that he was going to prepare a temporary home for her.\r\nNothing further was said about Tregear. She was too proud to ask that\r\nno mention of his name should be made to Lady Cantrip. And he when he\r\nleft the house did not think that he would find himself called upon\r\nto allude to the subject.\r\n\r\nBut when Lady Cantrip made some inquiry about the girl and her\r\nhabits,--asking what were her ordinary occupations, how she\r\nwas accustomed to pass her hours, to what she chiefly devoted\r\nherself,--then at last with much difficulty the Duke did bring\r\nhimself to tell the story. "Perhaps it is better you should know it\r\nall," he said as he told it.\r\n\r\n"Poor girl! Yes, Duke; upon the whole it is better that I should know\r\nit all," said Lady Cantrip. "Of course he will not come here."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear; I hope not."\r\n\r\n"Nor to The Horns."\r\n\r\n"I hope he will never see her again anywhere," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Poor girl!"\r\n\r\n"Have I not been right? Is it not best to put an end to such a thing\r\nat once?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly at once, if it has to be put an end to,--and can be put an\r\nend to."\r\n\r\n"It must be put an end to," said the Duke, very decidedly. "Do you\r\nnot see that it must be so? Who is Mr. Tregear?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose they were allowed to be together."\r\n\r\n"He was unfortunately intimate with Silverbridge, who took him over\r\nto Italy. He has nothing; not even a profession." Lady Cantrip could\r\nnot but smile when she remembered the immense wealth of the man who\r\nwas speaking to her;--and the Duke saw the smile and understood it.\r\n"You will understand what I mean, Lady Cantrip. If this young man\r\nwere in other respects suitable, of course I could find an income for\r\nthem. But he is nothing; just an idle seeker for pleasure without the\r\nmeans of obtaining it."\r\n\r\n"That is very bad."\r\n\r\n"As for rank," continued the Duke energetically, "I do not think\r\nthat I am specially wedded to it. I have found myself as willing\r\nto associate with those who are without it as with those who have\r\nit. But for my child, I would wish her to mate with one of her own\r\nclass."\r\n\r\n"It would be best."\r\n\r\n"When a young man comes to me who, though I believe him to be what is\r\ncalled a gentleman, has neither rank, nor means, nor profession, nor\r\nname, and asks for my daughter, surely I am right to say that such a\r\nmarriage shall not be thought of. Was I not right?" demanded the Duke\r\npersistently.\r\n\r\n"But it is a pity that it should be so. It is a pity that they should\r\never have come together."\r\n\r\n"It is indeed, indeed to be lamented,--and I will own at once that\r\nthe fault was not hers. Though I must be firm in this, you are not to\r\nsuppose that I am angry with her. I have myself been to blame." This\r\nhe said with a resolution that,--as he and his wife had been one\r\nflesh,--all faults committed by her should, now that she was dead, be\r\naccepted by him as his faults. "It had not occurred to me that as yet\r\nshe would love any man."\r\n\r\n"Has it gone deep with her, Duke?"\r\n\r\n"I fear that all things go deep with her."\r\n\r\n"Poor girl!"\r\n\r\n"But they shall be kept apart! As long as your great kindness is\r\ncontinued to her they shall be kept apart!"\r\n\r\n"I do not think that I should be found good at watching a young\r\nlady."\r\n\r\n"She will require no watching."\r\n\r\n"Then of course they will not meet. She had better know that you have\r\ntold me."\r\n\r\n"She shall know it."\r\n\r\n"And let her know also that anything I can do to make her happy shall\r\nbe done. But, Duke, there is but one cure."\r\n\r\n"Time, you mean."\r\n\r\n"Yes; time; but I did not mean time." Then she smiled as she went\r\non. "You must not suppose that I am speaking against my own sex if I\r\nsay that she will not forget Mr. Tregear till someone else has made\r\nhimself agreeable to her. We must wait till she can go out a little\r\ninto society. Then she will find out that there are others in the\r\nworld besides Mr. Tregear. It so often is the case that a girl\'s love\r\nmeans her sympathy for him who has chanced to be nearest to her."\r\n\r\nThe Duke as he went away thought very much of what Lady Cantrip had\r\nsaid to him;--particularly of those last words. "Till some one else\r\nhas made himself agreeable to her." Was he to send his girl into the\r\nworld in order that she might find a lover? There was something in\r\nthe idea which was thoroughly distasteful to him. He had not given\r\nhis mind much to the matter, but he felt that a woman should be\r\nsought for,--sought for and extracted, cunningly, as it were, from\r\nsome hiding-place, and not sent out into a market to be exposed as\r\nfor sale. In his own personal history there had been a misfortune,--a\r\nmisfortune, the sense of which he could never, at any moment, have\r\nexpressed to any ears, the memory of which had been always buried in\r\nhis own bosom,--but a misfortune in that no such cunning extraction\r\non his part had won for him the woman to whose hands had been\r\nconfided the strings of his heart. His wife had undergone that\r\nprocess of extraction before he had seen her, and his marriage with\r\nher had been a matter of sagacious bargaining. He was now told that\r\nhis daughter must be sent out among young men in order that she might\r\nbecome sufficiently fond of some special one to be regardless of\r\nTregear. There was a feeling that in doing so she must lose something\r\nof the freshness of the bloom of her innocence. How was this transfer\r\nof her love to be effected? Let her go here because she will meet the\r\nheir of this wealthy house who may probably be smitten by her charms;\r\nor there because that other young lordling would make a fit husband\r\nfor her. Let us contrive to throw her into the arms of this man, or\r\nput her into the way of that man. Was his girl to be exposed to this?\r\nSurely that method of bargaining to which he had owed his own wife\r\nwould be better than that. Let it be said,--only he himself most\r\ncertainly could not be the person to say it,--let it be said to some\r\nman of rank and means and fairly good character: "Here is a wife for\r\nyou with so many thousand pounds, with beauty, as you can see for\r\nyourself, with rank and belongings of the highest; very good in every\r\nrespect;--only that as regards her heart she thinks she has given\r\nit to a young man named Tregear. No marriage there is possible; but\r\nperhaps the young lady might suit you?" It was thus he had been\r\nmarried. There was an absence in it of that romance which, though he\r\nhad never experienced it in his own life, was always present to his\r\nimagination. His wife had often ridiculed him because he could only\r\nlive among figures and official details; but to her had not been\r\ngiven the power of looking into a man\'s heart and feeling all that\r\nwas there. Yes;--in such bargaining for a wife, in such bargaining\r\nfor a husband, there could be nothing of the tremulous delicacy of\r\nfeminine romance; but it would be better than standing at a stall\r\nin the market till the sufficient purchaser should come. It never\r\noccurred to him that the delicacy, the innocence, the romance, the\r\nbloom might all be preserved if he would give his girl to the man\r\nwhom she said she loved. Could he have modelled her future course\r\naccording to his own wishes, he would have had her live a gentle life\r\nfor the next three years, with a pencil perhaps in her hand or a\r\nmusic-book before her;--and then come forth, cleaned as it were by\r\nsuch quarantine from the impurity to which she had been subjected.\r\n\r\nWhen he was back at Matching he at once told his daughter what he had\r\narranged for her, and then there took place a prolonged discussion\r\nboth as to his view of her future life and as to her own. "You did\r\ntell her then about Mr. Tregear?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"As she is to have charge of you for a time I thought it best."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it is. Perhaps--you were afraid."\r\n\r\n"No; I was not afraid," he said angrily.\r\n\r\n"You need not be afraid. I shall do nothing elsewhere that I would\r\nnot do here, and nothing anywhere without telling you."\r\n\r\n"I know I can trust you."\r\n\r\n"But, papa, I shall always intend to marry Mr. Tregear."\r\n\r\n"No!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--always. I want you to understand exactly how it is. Nothing\r\nyou can do can separate me from him."\r\n\r\n"Mary, that is very wicked."\r\n\r\n"It cannot be wicked to tell the truth, papa. I mean to try to do all\r\nthat you tell me. I shall not see him, or write to him,--unless there\r\nshould be some very particular reason. And if I did see him or write\r\nto him I would tell you. And of course I should not think of--of\r\nmarrying without your leave. But I shall expect you to let me marry\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Never!"\r\n\r\n"Then I shall think you are--cruel; and you will break my heart."\r\n\r\n"You should not call your father cruel."\r\n\r\n"I hope you will not be cruel."\r\n\r\n"I can never permit you to marry this man. It would be altogether\r\nimproper. I cannot allow you to say that I am cruel because I do what\r\nI feel to be my duty. You will see other people."\r\n\r\n"A great many perhaps."\r\n\r\n"And will learn to,--to,--to forget him."\r\n\r\n"Never! I will not forget him. I should hate myself if I thought it\r\npossible. What would love be worth if it could be forgotten in that\r\nway?" As he heard this he reflected whether his own wife, this girl\'s\r\nmother, had ever forgotten her early love for that Burgo Fitzgerald\r\nwhom in her girlhood she had wished to marry.\r\n\r\nWhen he was leaving her she called him back again. "There is one\r\nother thing I think I ought to say, papa. If Lady Cantrip speaks to\r\nme about Mr. Tregear, I can only tell her what I have told you. I\r\nshall never give him up." When he heard this he turned angrily from\r\nher, almost stamping his foot upon the ground, when she quietly left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nCruel! She had told him that he would be cruel, if he opposed her\r\nlove. He thought he knew of himself that he could not be cruel,--even\r\nto a fly, even to a political opponent. There could be no cruelty\r\nwithout dishonesty, and did he not always struggle to be honest?\r\nCruel to his own daughter!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nAt Richmond\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pity of it! The pity of it! It was thus that Lady Cantrip looked\r\nat it. From what the girl\'s father had said to her she was disposed\r\nto believe that the malady had gone deep with her. "All things go\r\ndeep with her," he had said. And she too from other sources had heard\r\nsomething of this girl. She was afraid that it would go deep. It was\r\na thousand pities! Then she asked herself whether the marriage ought\r\nto be regarded as impossible. The Duke had been very positive,--had\r\ndeclared again and again that it was quite impossible, had so\r\nexpressed himself as to make her aware that he intended her to\r\nunderstand that he would not yield whatever the sufferings of the\r\ngirl might be. But Lady Cantrip knew the world well and was aware\r\nthat in such matters daughters are apt to be stronger than their\r\nfathers. He had declared Tregear to be a young man with very small\r\nmeans, and intent on such pleasures as require great means for their\r\nenjoyment. No worse character could be given to a gentleman who\r\nhad proposed himself as a son-in-law. But Lady Cantrip thought it\r\npossible that the Duke might be mistaken in this. She had never seen\r\nMr. Tregear, but she fancied that she had heard his name, and that\r\nthe name had been connected with a character different from that\r\nwhich the Duke had given him.\r\n\r\nLady Cantrip, who at this time was a young-looking woman, not much\r\nabove forty, had two daughters, both of whom were married. The\r\nyounger about a year since had become the wife of Lord Nidderdale, a\r\nmiddle-aged young man who had been long about town, a cousin of the\r\nlate Duchess, the heir to a marquisate, and a Member of Parliament.\r\nThe marriage had not been considered to be very brilliant; but the\r\nhusband was himself good-natured and pleasant, and Lady Cantrip was\r\nfond of him. In the first place she went to him for information.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I know him. He\'s one of our set at the Beargarden."\r\n\r\n"Not your set, now, I hope," she said laughing.\r\n\r\n"Well;--I don\'t see so much of them as I used to do. Tregear is not a\r\nbad fellow at all. He\'s always with Silverbridge. When Silverbridge\r\ndoes what Tregear tells him, he goes along pretty straight. But\r\nunfortunately there\'s another man called Tifto, and when Tifto is in\r\nthe ascendant then Silverbridge is apt to get a little astray."\r\n\r\n"He\'s not in debt, then?"\r\n\r\n"Who?--Tregear? I should think he\'s the last man in the world to owe\r\na penny to any one."\r\n\r\n"Is he a betting man?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no; quite the other way up. He\'s a severe, sarcastic,\r\nbookish sort of fellow,--a chap who knows everything and turns up his\r\nnose at people who know nothing."\r\n\r\n"Has he got anything of his own?"\r\n\r\n"Not much, I should say. If he had had any money he would have\r\nmarried Lady Mab Grex last year."\r\n\r\nLady Cantrip was inclined from what she now learned to think that the\r\nDuke must be wrong about the young man. But before Lady Mary joined\r\nher she made further inquiry. She too knew Lady Mabel, and knowing\r\nLady Mabel, she knew Miss Cassewary. She contrived to find herself\r\nalone with Miss Cassewary, and asked some further questions about Mr.\r\nTregear. "He is a cousin of my Lord\'s," said Miss Cass.\r\n\r\n"So I thought. I wonder what sort of a young man he is. He is a good\r\ndeal with Lord Silverbridge."\r\n\r\nThen Miss Cassewary spoke her opinion very plainly. "If Lord\r\nSilverbridge had nobody worse about him than Mr. Tregear he would not\r\ncome to much harm."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he\'s not very well off."\r\n\r\n"No;--certainly not. He will have a property of some kind, I believe,\r\nwhen his mother dies. I think very well of Mr. Tregear;--only I wish\r\nthat he had a profession. But why are you asking about him, Lady\r\nCantrip?"\r\n\r\n"Nidderdale was talking to me about him and saying that he was\r\nso much with Lord Silverbridge. Lord Silverbridge is going into\r\nParliament now, and, as it were, beginning the world, and it would\r\nbe a thousand pities that he should get into bad hands." It may,\r\nhowever, be doubted whether Miss Cassewary was hoodwinked by this\r\nlittle story.\r\n\r\nEarly in the second week in May the Duke brought his daughter up to\r\nThe Horns, and at the same time expressed his intention of remaining\r\nin London. When he did so Lady Mary at once asked whether she might\r\nnot be with him,--but he would not permit it. The house in London\r\nwould, he said, be more gloomy even than Matching.\r\n\r\n"I am quite ashamed of giving you so much trouble," Lady Mary said to\r\nher new friend.\r\n\r\n"We are delighted to have you, my dear."\r\n\r\n"But I know that you have been obliged to leave London because I am\r\nwith you."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing I like so much as this place, which your father has\r\nbeen kind enough to lend us. As for London, there is nothing now to\r\nmake me like being there. Both my girls are married, and therefore I\r\nregard myself as an old woman who has done her work. Don\'t you think\r\nthis place very much nicer than London at this time of the year?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know London at all. I had only just been brought out when\r\npoor mamma went abroad."\r\n\r\nThe life they led was very quiet, and must probably have been felt\r\nto be dull by Lady Cantrip, in spite of her old age and desire\r\nfor retirement. But the place itself was very lovely. May of all\r\nthe months of the year is in England the most insidious, the most\r\ndangerous, and the most inclement. A greatcoat cannot be endured,\r\nand without a greatcoat who can endure a May wind and live? But of\r\nall months it is the prettiest. The grasses are then the greenest,\r\nand the young foliage of the trees, while it has all the glory and\r\nall the colour of spring vegetation, does not hide the form of the\r\nbranches as do the heavy masses of the larger leaves which come in\r\nthe advancing summer. And of all villas near London The Horns was the\r\nsweetest. The broad green lawn swept down to the very margin of the\r\nThames, which absolutely washed the fringe of grass when the tide\r\nwas high. And here, along the bank, was a row of flowering ashes,\r\nthe drooping boughs of which in places touched the water. It was\r\none of those spots which when they are first seen make the beholder\r\nfeel that to be able to live there and look at it always would be\r\nhappiness enough for life.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the week there came a visitor to see Lady Mary. A very\r\npretty carriage was driven up to the door of The Horns, and the\r\nservant asked for Lady Mary Palliser. The owner of that carriage was\r\nMrs. Finn. Now it must be explained to the reader that there had\r\nnever been any friendship between Mrs. Finn and Lady Cantrip, though\r\nthe ladies had met each other. The great political intimacy which had\r\nexisted between the Duke and Lord Cantrip had created some intimacy\r\nalso between their wives. The Duchess and Lady Cantrip had been\r\nfriends,--after a fashion. But Mrs. Finn had never been cordially\r\naccepted by those among whom Lady Cantrip chiefly lived. When\r\ntherefore the name was announced, the servant expressly stating that\r\nthe visitor had asked for Lady Mary, Lady Cantrip, who was with her\r\nguest, had to bethink herself what she would do. The Duke, who was at\r\nthis time very full of wrath against Mrs. Finn, had not mentioned\r\nthis lady\'s name when delivering up the charge of his daughter to\r\nLady Cantrip. At this moment it occurred to her that not improbably\r\nMrs. Finn would cease to be included in the intimacies of the\r\nPalliser family from the time of the death of the Duchess,--that the\r\nDuke would not care to maintain the old relations, and that he would\r\nbe as little anxious to do it for his daughter as for himself. If so,\r\ncould it be right that Mrs. Finn should come down here, to a house\r\nwhich was now in the occupation of a lady with whom she was not on\r\ninviting terms, in order that she might thus force herself on the\r\nDuke\'s daughter? Mrs. Finn had not left her carriage, but had sent in\r\nto ask if Lady Mary could see her. In all this there was considerable\r\nembarrassment. She looked round at her guest, who had at once risen\r\nfrom her chair. "Would you wish to see her?" asked Lady Cantrip.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; certainly."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen her since,--since you came home from Italy?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, yes! She was down at Matching when poor mamma died. And\r\npapa persuaded her to remain afterwards. Of course I will see her."\r\nThen the servant was desired to ask Mrs. Finn to come in;--and while\r\nthis was being done Lady Cantrip retired.\r\n\r\nMrs. Finn embraced her young friend, and asked after her welfare, and\r\nafter the welfare of the house in which she was staying,--a house\r\nwith which Mrs. Finn herself had been well acquainted,--and said\r\nhalf-a-dozen pretty little things in her own quiet pretty way, before\r\nshe spoke of the matter which had really brought her to The Horns on\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\n"I have had a correspondence with your father, Mary."\r\n\r\n"Indeed."\r\n\r\n"And unfortunately one that has been far from agreeable to me."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for that, Mrs. Finn."\r\n\r\n"So am I, very sorry. I may say with perfect truth that there is no\r\nman in the world, except my own husband, for whom I feel so perfect\r\nan esteem as I do for your father. If it were not that I do not like\r\nto be carried away by strong language I would speak of more than\r\nesteem. Through your dear mother I have watched his conduct closely,\r\nand have come to think that there is perhaps no other man at the same\r\ntime so just and so patriotic. Now he is very angry with me,--and\r\nmost unjustly angry."\r\n\r\n"Is it about me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--it is about you. Had it not been altogether about you I would\r\nnot have troubled you."\r\n\r\n"And about--?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--about Mr. Tregear also. When I tell you that there has been a\r\ncorrespondence I must explain that I have written one long letter to\r\nthe Duke, and that in answer I have received a very short one. That\r\nhas been the whole correspondence. Here is your father\'s letter to\r\nme." Then she brought out of her pocket a note, which Lady Mary\r\nread,--covered with blushes as she did so. The note was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Duke of Omnium understands from Mrs. Finn\'s letter\r\n   that Mrs. Finn, while she was the Duke\'s guest at\r\n   Matching, was aware of a certain circumstance affecting\r\n   the Duke\'s honour and happiness,--which circumstance she\r\n   certainly did not communicate to the Duke. The Duke thinks\r\n   that the trust which had been placed in Mrs. Finn should\r\n   have made such a communication imperative. The Duke feels\r\n   that no further correspondence between himself and Mrs.\r\n   Finn on the matter could lead to any good result.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Do you understand it?" asked Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"It simply means this,--that when at Matching he had thought me\r\nworthy of having for a time the charge of you and of your welfare,\r\nthat he had trusted me, who was the friend of your dear mother,\r\nto take for a time in regard to you the place which had been so\r\nunhappily left vacant by her death; and it means also that I deceived\r\nhim and betrayed that trust by being privy to an engagement on your\r\npart, of which he disapproves, and of which he was not then aware."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he does mean that."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lady Mary; that is what he means. And he means further to let\r\nme know that as I did so foully betray the trust which he had placed\r\nin me,--that as I had consented to play the part of assistant to you\r\nin that secret engagement,--therefore he casts me off as altogether\r\nunworthy of his esteem and acquaintance. It is as though he had told\r\nme in so many words that among women he had known none more vile or\r\nmore false than I."\r\n\r\n"Not that, Mrs. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that;--all of that. He tells me that, and then says that there\r\nshall be no more words spoken or written about it. I can hardly\r\nsubmit to so stern a judgment. You know the truth, Lady Mary."\r\n\r\n"Do not call me Lady Mary. Do not quarrel with me."\r\n\r\n"If your father has quarrelled with me, it would not be fit that you\r\nand I should be friends. Your duty to him would forbid it. I should\r\nnot have come to you now did I not feel that I am bound to justify\r\nmyself. The thing of which I am accused is so repugnant to me, that\r\nI am obliged to do something and to say something, even though the\r\nsubject itself be one on which I would so willingly be silent."\r\n\r\n"What can I do, Mrs. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"It was Mr. Tregear who first told me that your father was angry with\r\nme. He knew what I had done and why, and he was bound to tell me in\r\norder that I might have an opportunity of setting myself right with\r\nthe Duke. Then I wrote and explained everything,--how you had told\r\nme of the engagement, and how I had then urged Mr. Tregear that he\r\nshould not keep such a matter secret from your father. In answer to\r\nmy letter I have received--that."\r\n\r\n"Shall I write and tell papa?"\r\n\r\n"He should be made to understand that from the moment in which I\r\nheard of the engagement I was urgent with you and with Mr. Tregear\r\nthat he should be informed of it. You will remember what passed."\r\n\r\n"I remember it all."\r\n\r\n"I did not conceive it to be my duty to tell the Duke myself, but I\r\ndid conceive it to be my duty to see he should be told. Now he writes\r\nas though I had known the secret from the first, and as though I had\r\nbeen concealing it from him at the very moment in which he was asking\r\nme to remain at Matching on your behalf. That I consider to be\r\nhard,--and unjust. I cannot deny what he says. I did know of it while\r\nI was at Matching, for it was at Matching that you told me. But he\r\nimplies that I knew it before. When you told me your story I did feel\r\nthat it was my duty to see that the matter was not kept longer from\r\nhim;--and I did my duty. Now your father takes upon himself to rebuke\r\nme,--and takes upon himself at the same time to forbid me to write to\r\nhim again!"\r\n\r\n"I will tell him all, Mrs. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Let him understand this. I do not wish to write to him again. After\r\nwhat has passed I cannot say I wish to see him again. But I think he\r\nshould acknowledge to me that he has been mistaken. He need not then\r\nfear that I shall trouble him with any reply. But I shall know that\r\nhe has acquitted me of a fault of which I cannot bear to think I\r\nshould be accused." Then she took a somewhat formal though still an\r\naffectionate farewell of the girl.\r\n\r\n"I want to see papa as soon as possible," said Lady Mary when she was\r\nagain with Lady Cantrip. The reason for her wish was soon given, and\r\nthen the whole story told. "You do not think that she should have\r\ngone to papa at once?" Lady Mary asked. It was a point of moral law\r\non which the elder woman, who had had girls of her own, found it hard\r\nto give an immediate answer. It certainly is expedient that parents\r\nshould know at once of any engagement by which their daughters may\r\nseek to contract themselves. It is expedient that they should be able\r\nto prevent any secret contracts. Lady Cantrip felt strongly that\r\nMrs. Finn having accepted the confidential charge of the daughter\r\ncould not, without gross betrayal of trust, allow herself to be the\r\ndepositary of such a secret. "But she did not allow herself," said\r\nLady Mary, pleading for her friend.\r\n\r\n"But she left the house without telling him, my dear."\r\n\r\n"But it was because of what she did that he was told."\r\n\r\n"That is true; but I doubt whether she should have left him an hour\r\nin ignorance."\r\n\r\n"But it was I who told her. She would have betrayed me."\r\n\r\n"She was not a fit recipient for your confidence, Mary. But I do not\r\nwish to accuse her. She seems to be a high-minded woman, and I think\r\nthat your papa has been hard upon her."\r\n\r\n"And mamma knew it always," said Mary. To this Lady Cantrip could\r\ngive no answer. Whatever cause for anger the Duke might have against\r\nMrs. Finn, there had been cause for much more against his wife. But\r\nshe had freed herself from all accusation by death.\r\n\r\nLady Mary wrote to her father, declaring that she was most\r\nparticularly anxious to see him and talk to him about Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nThe Duke\'s Injustice\r\n\r\n\r\nNo advantage whatever was obtained by Lady Mary\'s interview with her\r\nfather. He persisted that Mrs. Finn had been untrue to him when she\r\nleft Matching without telling him all that she knew of his daughter\'s\r\nengagement with Mr. Tregear. No doubt by degrees that idea which he\r\nat first entertained was expelled from his head,--the idea that she\r\nhad been cognisant of the whole thing before she came to Matching;\r\nbut even this was done so slowly that there was no moment at which he\r\nbecame aware of any lessened feeling of indignation. To his thinking\r\nshe had betrayed her trust, and he could not be got by his daughter\r\nto say that he would forgive her. He certainly could not be got to\r\nsay that he would apologise for the accusation he had made. It was\r\nnothing less that his daughter asked; and he could hardly refrain\r\nhimself from anger when she asked it. "There should not have been\r\na moment," he said, "before she came to me and told me all." Poor\r\nLady Mary\'s position was certainly uncomfortable enough. The great\r\nsin,--the sin which was so great that to have known it for a day\r\nwithout revealing it was in itself a damning sin on the part of Mrs.\r\nFinn,--was Lady Mary\'s sin. And she differed so entirely from her\r\nfather as to think that this sin of her own was a virtue, and that to\r\nhave spoken of it to him would have been, on the part of Mrs. Finn,\r\na treachery so deep that no woman ought to have forgiven it! When\r\nhe spoke of a matter which deeply affected his honour,--she could\r\nhardly refrain from asserting that his honour was quite safe in his\r\ndaughter\'s hands. And when in his heart he declared that it should\r\nhave been Mrs. Finn\'s first care to save him from disgrace, Lady Mary\r\ndid break out. "Papa, there could be no disgrace." "That for a moment\r\nshall be laid aside," he said, with that manner by which even his\r\npeers in council had never been able not to be awed, "but if you\r\ncommunicate with Mrs. Finn at all you must make her understand that I\r\nregard her conduct as inexcusable."\r\n\r\nNothing had been gained, and poor Lady Mary was compelled to write a\r\nfew lines which were to her most painful in writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MRS. FINN,\r\n\r\n   I have seen papa, and he thinks that you ought to have\r\n   told him when I told you. It occurs to me that that would\r\n   have been a cruel thing to do, and most unfair to Mr.\r\n   Tregear, who was quite willing to go to papa, and had only\r\n   put off doing so because of poor mamma\'s death. As I had\r\n   told mamma, of course it was right that he should tell\r\n   papa. Then I told you, because you were so kind to me! I\r\n   am so sorry that I have got you into this trouble; but\r\n   what can I do?\r\n\r\n   I told him I must write to you. I suppose it is better\r\n   that I should, although what I have to say is so\r\n   unpleasant. I hope it will all blow over in time,\r\n   because I love you dearly. You may be quite sure of one\r\n   thing,--that I shall never change. [In this assurance the\r\n   writer was alluding not to her friendship for her friend\r\n   but her love for her lover,--and so the friend understood\r\n   her.] I hope things will be settled some day, and then we\r\n   may be able to meet.\r\n\r\n   Your very affectionate Friend,\r\n\r\n   MARY PALLISER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Finn, when she received this, was alone in her house in Park\r\nLane. Her husband was down in the North of England. On this subject\r\nshe had not spoken to him, fearing that he would feel himself bound\r\nto take some steps to support his wife under the treatment she had\r\nreceived. Even though she must quarrel with the Duke, she was most\r\nanxious that her husband should not be compelled to do so. Their\r\nconnection had been political rather than personal. There were many\r\nreasons why there should be no open cause of disruption between them.\r\nBut her husband was hot-headed, and, were all this to be told him and\r\nthat letter shown to him which the Duke had written, there would be\r\nwords between him and the Duke which would probably make impossible\r\nany further connection between them.\r\n\r\nIt troubled her very much. She was by no means not alive to the\r\nhonour of the Duke\'s friendship. Throughout her intimacy with the\r\nDuchess she had abstained from pressing herself on him, not because\r\nshe had been indifferent about him, but that she had perceived that\r\nshe might make her way with him better by standing aloof than by\r\nthrusting herself forward. And she had known that she had been\r\nsuccessful. She could tell herself with pride that her conduct\r\ntowards him had been always such as would become a lady of high\r\nspirit and fine feeling. She knew that she had deserved well of him,\r\nthat in all her intercourse with him, with his uncle, and with his\r\nwife, she had given much and had taken little. She was the last woman\r\nin the world to let a word on such a matter pass her lips; but not\r\nthe less was she conscious of her merit towards him. And she had been\r\nled to act as she had done by sincere admiration for the man. In all\r\ntheir political troubles, she had understood him better than the\r\nDuchess had done. Looking on from a distance she had understood the\r\nman\'s character as it had come to her both from his wife and from her\r\nown husband.\r\n\r\nThat he was unjust to her,--cruelly unjust, she was quite sure. He\r\naccused her of intentional privity to a secret which it behoved him\r\nto know, and of being a party to that secrecy. Whereas from the\r\nmoment in which she had heard the secret she had determined that it\r\nmust be made known to him. She felt that she had deserved his good\r\nopinion in all things, but in nothing more than in the way in which\r\nshe had acted in this matter. And yet he had treated her with an\r\nimperious harshness which amounted to insolence. What a letter it was\r\nthat he had written to her! The very tips of her ears tingled with\r\nheat as she read it again to herself. None of the ordinary courtesies\r\nof epistle-craft had been preserved either in the beginning or in\r\nthe end. It was worse even than if he had called her Madam without\r\nan epithet. "The Duke understands--" "The Duke thinks--" "The Duke\r\nfeels--" feels that he should not be troubled with either letters or\r\nconversation; the upshot of it all being that the Duke declared her\r\nto have shown herself unworthy of being treated like a lady! And this\r\nafter all that she had done!\r\n\r\nShe would not bear it. That at present was all that she could say\r\nto herself. She was not angry with Lady Mary. She did not doubt but\r\nthat the girl had done the best in her power to bring her father\r\nto reason. But because Lady Mary had failed, she, Mrs. Finn,\r\nwas not going to put up with so grievous an injury. And she was\r\nforced to bear all this alone! There was none with whom she could\r\ncommunicate;--no one from whom she could ask advice. She would not\r\nbring her husband into a quarrel which might be prejudicial to his\r\nposition as a member of his political party. There was no one else to\r\nwhom she would tell the secret of Lady Mary\'s love. And yet she could\r\nnot bear this injustice done to her.\r\n\r\nThen she wrote as follows to the Duke:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Mrs. Finn presents her compliments to the Duke of Omnium.\r\n   Mrs. Finn finds it to be essential to her that she should\r\n   see the Duke in reference to his letter to her. If his\r\n   Grace will let her know on what day and at what hour he\r\n   will be kind enough to call on her, Mrs. Finn will be at\r\n   home to receive him.\r\n\r\n   Park Lane. Thursday, 12th May, 18--.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nThe New Member for Silverbridge\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge was informed that it would be right that he should\r\ngo down to Silverbridge a few days before the election, to make\r\nhimself known to the electors. As the day for the election drew\r\nnear it was understood that there would be no other candidate.\r\nThe Conservative side was the popular side among the tradesmen of\r\nSilverbridge. Silverbridge had been proud to be honoured by the\r\nservices of the heir of the house of Omnium, even while that heir had\r\nbeen a Liberal,--had regarded it as so much a matter of course that\r\nthe borough should be at his disposal that no question as to politics\r\nhad ever arisen while he retained the seat. And had the Duke chosen\r\nto continue to send them Liberals, one after another, when he went\r\ninto the House of Lords, there would have been no question as to the\r\nfitness of the man or men so sent. Silverbridge had been supposed\r\nto be a Liberal as a matter of course,--because the Pallisers were\r\nLiberals. But when the matter was remitted to themselves,--when the\r\nDuke declared that he would not interfere any more, for it was thus\r\nthat the borough had obtained its freedom,--then the borough began to\r\nfeel Conservative predilections. "If his Grace really does mean us to\r\ndo just what we please ourselves, which is a thing we never thought\r\nof asking from his Grace, then we find, having turned the matter over\r\namong ourselves, that we are upon the whole Conservative." In this\r\nspirit the borough had elected a certain Mr. Fletcher; but in doing\r\nso the borough had still a shade of fear that it would offend the\r\nDuke. The house of Palliser, Gatherum Castle, the Duke of Omnium,\r\nand this special Duke himself, were all so great in the eyes of\r\nthe borough, that the first and only strong feeling in the borough\r\nwas the one of duty. The borough did not altogether enjoy being\r\nenfranchised. But when the Duke had spoken once, twice, and thrice,\r\nthen with a hesitating heart the borough returned Mr. Fletcher. Now\r\nMr. Fletcher was wanted elsewhere, having been persuaded to stand\r\nfor the county, and it was a comfort to the borough that it could\r\nresettle itself beneath the warmth of the wings of the Pallisers.\r\n\r\nSo the matter stood when Lord Silverbridge was told that his presence\r\nin the borough for a few hours would be taken as a compliment.\r\nHitherto no one knew him at Silverbridge. During his boyhood he had\r\nnot been much at Gatherum Castle, and had done his best to eschew the\r\nplace since he had ceased to be a boy. All the Pallisers took a pride\r\nin Gatherum Castle, but they all disliked it. "Oh yes; I\'ll go down,"\r\nhe said to Mr. Morton, who was up in town. "I needn\'t go to the great\r\nbarrack I suppose." The great barrack was the Castle. "I\'ll put up at\r\nthe Inn." Mr. Morton begged the heir to come to his own house; but\r\nSilverbridge declared that he would prefer the Inn, and so the matter\r\nwas settled. He was to meet sundry politicians,--Mr. Sprugeon and Mr.\r\nSprout and Mr. Du Boung,--who would like to be thanked for what they\r\nhad done. But who was to go with him? He would naturally have asked\r\nTregear, but from Tregear he had for the last week or two been, not\r\nperhaps estranged, but separated. He had been much taken up with\r\nracing. He had gone down to Chester with Major Tifto, and under the\r\nMajor\'s auspicious influences had won a little money;--and now he\r\nwas very anxiously preparing himself for the Newmarket Second\r\nSpring Meeting. He had therefore passed much of his time with Major\r\nTifto. And when this visit to Silverbridge was pressed on him he\r\nthoughtlessly asked Tifto to go with him. Tifto was delighted. Lord\r\nSilverbridge was to be met at Silverbridge by various well-known\r\npoliticians from the neighbourhood, and Major Tifto was greatly\r\nelated by the prospect of such an introduction into the political\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner had the offer been made by Lord Silverbridge than\r\nhe saw his own indiscretion. Tifto was very well for Chester or\r\nNewmarket, very well perhaps for the Beargarden, but not very well\r\nfor an electioneering expedition. An idea came to the young nobleman\r\nthat if it should be his fate to represent Silverbridge in Parliament\r\nfor the next twenty years, it would be well that Silverbridge should\r\nentertain respecting him some exalted estimation,--that Silverbridge\r\nshould be taught to regard him as a fit son of his father and a\r\nworthy specimen of the British political nobility. Struck by serious\r\nreflections of this nature he did open his mind to Tregear. "I am\r\nvery fond of Tifto," he said, "but I don\'t know whether he\'s just the\r\nsort of fellow to take down to an election."\r\n\r\n"I should think not," said Tregear very decidedly.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a very good fellow, you know," said Silverbridge. "I don\'t know\r\nan honester man than Tifto anywhere."\r\n\r\n"I dare say. Or rather, I don\'t dare say. I know nothing about the\r\nMajor\'s honesty, and I doubt whether you do. He rides very well."\r\n\r\n"What has that to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing on earth. Therefore I advise you not to take him to\r\nSilverbridge."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t preach."\r\n\r\n"You may call it what you like. Tifto would not hold his tongue,\r\nand there is nothing he could say there which would not be to your\r\nprejudice."\r\n\r\n"Will you go?"\r\n\r\n"If you wish it," said Tregear.\r\n\r\n"What will the governor say?"\r\n\r\n"That must be your look-out. In a political point of view I\r\nshall not disgrace you. I shall hold my tongue and look like a\r\ngentleman,--neither of which is in Tifto\'s power."\r\n\r\nAnd so it was settled, that on the day but one after this\r\nconversation Lord Silverbridge and Tregear should go together to\r\nSilverbridge. But the Major, when on the same night his noble\r\nfriend\'s altered plans were explained to him, did not bear the\r\ndisappointment with equanimity. "Isn\'t that a little strange?" he\r\nsaid, becoming very red in the face.\r\n\r\n"What do you call strange?" said the Lord.\r\n\r\n"Well;--I\'d made all my arrangements. When a man has been asked to do\r\na thing like that, he doesn\'t like to be put off."\r\n\r\n"The truth is, Tifto, when I came to think of it, I saw that, going\r\ndown to these fellows about Parliament and all that sort of thing, I\r\nought to have a political atmosphere, and not a racing or a betting\r\nor a hunting atmosphere."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t a man in London who cares more about politics than I\r\ndo;--and not very many perhaps who understand them better. To tell\r\nyou the truth, my Lord, I think you are throwing me over."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make it up to you," said Silverbridge, meaning to be kind.\r\n"I\'ll go down to Newmarket with you and stick to you like wax."\r\n\r\n"No doubt you\'ll do that," said Tifto, who, like a fool, failed to\r\nsee where his advantage lay. "I can be useful at Newmarket, and so\r\nyou\'ll stick to me."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Major Tifto," said Silverbridge; "if you are\r\ndissatisfied, you and I can easily separate ourselves."\r\n\r\n"I am not dissatisfied," said the little man, almost crying.\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t talk as though you were. As to Silverbridge, I shall\r\nnot want you there. When I asked you I was only thinking what would\r\nbe pleasant to both of us; but since that I have remembered that\r\nbusiness must be business." Even this did not reconcile the angry\r\nlittle man, who as he turned away declared within his own little\r\nbosom that he would "take it out of Silverbridge for that."\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge and Tregear went down to the borough together, and\r\non the journey something was said about Lady Mary,--and something\r\nalso about Lady Mabel. "From the first, you know," said Lady Mary\'s\r\nbrother, "I never thought it would answer."\r\n\r\n"Why not answer?"\r\n\r\n"Because I knew the governor would not have it. Money and rank and\r\nthose sort of things are not particularly charming to me. But still\r\nthings should go together. It is all very well for you and me to\r\nbe pals, but of course it will be expected that Mary should marry\r\nsome--"\r\n\r\n"Some swell?"\r\n\r\n"Some swell, if you will have it."\r\n\r\n"You mean to call yourself a swell?"\r\n\r\n"Yes I do," said Silverbridge, with considerable resolution. "You\r\nought not to make yourself disagreeable, because you understand all\r\nabout it as well as anybody. Chance has made me the eldest son of a\r\nDuke and heir to an enormous fortune. Chance has made my sister the\r\ndaughter of a Duke, and an heiress also. My intimacy with you ought\r\nto be proof at any rate to you that I don\'t on that account set\r\nmyself up above other fellows. But when you come to talk of marriage,\r\nof course it is a serious thing."\r\n\r\n"But you have told me more than once that you have no objection on\r\nyour own score."\r\n\r\n"Nor have I."\r\n\r\n"You are only saying what the Duke will think."\r\n\r\n"I am telling you that it is impossible, and I told you so before.\r\nYou and she will be kept apart, and so--"\r\n\r\n"And so she\'ll forget me."\r\n\r\n"Something of that kind."\r\n\r\n"Of course I have to trust to her for that. If she forgets me, well\r\nand good."\r\n\r\n"She needn\'t forget you. Lord bless me! you talk as though the thing\r\nwere not done every day. You\'ll hear some morning that she is going\r\nto marry some fellow who has a lot of money and a good position; and\r\nwhat difference will it make then whether she has forgotten you or\r\nnot?" It might almost have been supposed that the young man had been\r\nacquainted with his mother\'s history.\r\n\r\nAfter this there was a pause, and there arose conversation about\r\nother things, and a cigar was smoked. Then Tregear returned once more\r\nto the subject. "There is one thing I wish to say about it all."\r\n\r\n"What is that?"\r\n\r\n"I want you to understand that nothing else will turn me away from my\r\nintention but such a marriage on her part as that of which you speak.\r\nNothing that your father can do will turn me."\r\n\r\n"She can\'t marry without his leave."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not."\r\n\r\n"That he\'ll never give,--and I don\'t suppose you look forward to\r\nwaiting till his death."\r\n\r\n"If he sees that her happiness really depends on it he will give his\r\nleave. It all depends on that. If I judge your father rightly, he\'s\r\njust as soft-hearted as other people. The man who holds out is not\r\nthe man of the firmest opinion, but the man of the hardest heart."\r\n\r\n"Somebody will talk Mary over."\r\n\r\n"If so, the thing is over. It all depends on her." Then he went on to\r\ntell his friend that he had spoken of his engagement to Lady Mabel.\r\n"I have mentioned it to no soul but to your father and to her."\r\n\r\n"Why to her?"\r\n\r\n"Because we were friends together as children. I never had a sister,\r\nbut she has been more like a sister to me than any one else. Do you\r\nobject to her knowing it?"\r\n\r\n"Not particularly. It seems to me now that everybody knows\r\neverything. There are no longer any secrets."\r\n\r\n"But she is a special friend."\r\n\r\n"Of yours," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"And of yours," said Tregear.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes;--in a sort of way. She is the jolliest girl I know."\r\n\r\n"Take her all round, for beauty, intellect, good sense, and fun at\r\nthe same time, I don\'t know any one equal to her."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity you didn\'t fall in love with her."\r\n\r\n"We knew each other too early for that. And then she has not a\r\nshilling. I should think myself dishonest if I did not tell you that\r\nI could not afford to love any girl who hadn\'t money. A man must\r\nlive,--and a woman too."\r\n\r\nAt the station they were met by Mr. Sprugeon and Mr. Sprout, who,\r\nwith many apologies for the meanness of such entertainment, took them\r\nup to the George and Vulture, which was supposed for the nonce to be\r\nthe Conservative hotel in the town. Here they were met by other men\r\nof importance in the borough, and among them by Mr. Du Boung. Now Mr.\r\nSprout and Mr. Sprugeon were Conservatives, but Mr. Du Boung was a\r\nstrong Liberal.\r\n\r\n"We are, all of us, particularly glad to see your Lordship among us,"\r\nsaid Mr. Du Boung.\r\n\r\n"I have told his Lordship how perfectly satisfied you are to see the\r\nborough in his Lordship\'s hands," said Mr. Sprugeon.\r\n\r\n"I am sure it could not be in better," said Mr. Du Boung. "For myself\r\nI am quite willing to postpone any peculiar shade of politics to the\r\nadvantage of having your father\'s son as our representative."\r\n\r\nThis Mr. Du Boung said with much intention of imparting both grace\r\nand dignity to the occasion. He thought that he was doing a great\r\nthing for the house of Omnium, and that the house of Omnium ought to\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\n"That\'s very kind of you," said Lord Silverbridge, who had not read\r\nas carefully as he should have done the letters which had been sent\r\nto him, and did not therefore quite understand the position.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Du Boung had intended to stand himself," said Mr. Sprout.\r\n\r\n"But retired in your Lordship\'s favour," said Mr. Sprugeon.\r\n\r\n"In doing which I considered that I studied the interest of the\r\nborough," said Mr. Du Boung.\r\n\r\n"I thought you gave it up because there was hardly a footing for a\r\nLiberal," said his Lordship, very imprudently.\r\n\r\n"The borough was always Liberal till the last election," said Mr. Du\r\nBoung, drawing himself up.\r\n\r\n"The borough wishes on this occasion to be magnanimous," said\r\nMr. Sprout, probably having on his mind some confusion between\r\nmagnanimity and unanimity.\r\n\r\n"As your Lordship is coming among us, the borough is anxious to sink\r\npolitics altogether for the moment," said Mr. Sprugeon. There had no\r\ndoubt been a compact between the Sprugeon and Sprout party and the Du\r\nBoung party in accordance with which it had been arranged that Mr. Du\r\nBoung should be entitled to a certain amount of glorification in the\r\npresence of Lord Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"And it was in compliance with that wish on the part of the borough,\r\nmy Lord," said Mr. Du Boung,--"as to which my own feelings were quite\r\nas strong as that of any other gentleman in the borough,--that I\r\nconceived it to be my duty to give way."\r\n\r\n"His Lordship is quite aware how much he owes to Mr. Du Boung," said\r\nTregear. Whereupon Lord Silverbridge bowed.\r\n\r\n"And now what are we to do?" said Lord Silverbridge.\r\n\r\nThen there was a little whispering between Mr. Sprout and Mr.\r\nSprugeon. "Perhaps, Mr. Du Boung," said Sprugeon, "his Lordship had\r\nbetter call first on Dr. Tempest."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said the injured brewer, "as it is to be a party affair\r\nafter all I had better retire from the scene."\r\n\r\n"I thought all that was to be given up," said Tregear.\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly," said Sprout. "Suppose we go to Mr. Walker first?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m up to anything," said Lord Silverbridge; "but of course\r\neverybody understands that I am a Conservative."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, yes," said Sprugeon.\r\n\r\n"We are all aware of that," said Sprout.\r\n\r\n"And very glad we\'ve all of us been to hear it," said the landlord.\r\n\r\n"Though there are some in the borough who could have wished, my Lord,\r\nthat you had stuck to the old Palliser politics," said Mr. Du Boung.\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t stuck to the Palliser politics. Just at present I\r\nthink that order and all that sort of thing should be maintained."\r\n\r\n"Hear, hear!" said the landlord.\r\n\r\n"And now, as I have expressed my views generally, I am willing to go\r\nanywhere."\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll go to Mr. Walker first," said Sprugeon. Now it was\r\nunderstood that in the borough, among those who really had opinions\r\nof their own, Mr. Walker the old attorney stood first as a Liberal,\r\nand Dr. Tempest the old rector first as a Conservative.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to see your Lordship in the town which gives you\r\nits name," said Mr. Walker, who was a hale old gentleman with\r\nsilvery-white hair, over seventy years of age. "I proposed your\r\nfather for this borough on, I think, six or seven different\r\noccasions. They used to go in and out then whenever they changed\r\ntheir offices."\r\n\r\n"We hope you\'ll propose Lord Silverbridge now," said Mr. Sprugeon.\r\n\r\n"Oh; well;--yes. He\'s his father\'s son, and I never knew anything but\r\ngood of the family. I wish you were going to sit on the same side, my\r\nLord."\r\n\r\n"Times are changed a little, perhaps," said his Lordship.\r\n\r\n"The matter is not to be discussed now," said the old attorney. "I\r\nunderstand that. Only I hope you\'ll excuse me if I say that a man\r\nought to get up very early in the morning if he means to see further\r\ninto politics than your father."\r\n\r\n"Very early indeed," said Mr. Du Boung, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," said Lord Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll propose you, my Lord. I need not wish you success, because\r\nthere is no one to stand against you."\r\n\r\nThen they went to Dr. Tempest, who was also an old man. "Yes,\r\nmy Lord, I shall be proud to second you," said the rector. "I\r\ndidn\'t think that I should ever do that to one of your name in\r\nSilverbridge."\r\n\r\n"I hope you think I\'ve made a change for the better," said the\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve come over to my school of course, and I suppose I am bound\r\nto think that a change for the better. Nevertheless I have a kind of\r\nidea that certain people ought to be Tories and that other certain\r\npeople ought to be Whigs. What does your father say about it?"\r\n\r\n"My father wishes me to be in the House, and that he has not\r\nquarrelled with me you may know by the fact that had there been a\r\ncontest he would have paid my expenses."\r\n\r\n"A father generally has to do that whether he approves of what his\r\nson is about or not," said the caustic old gentleman.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else to be done. They all went back to the hotel,\r\nand Mr. Sprugeon with Mr. Sprout and the landlord drank a glass of\r\nsherry at the candidate\'s expense, wishing him political long life\r\nand prosperity. There was no one else whom it was thought necessary\r\nthat the candidate should visit, and the next day he returned to town\r\nwith the understanding that on the day appointed in the next week he\r\nshould come back again to be elected.\r\n\r\nAnd on the day appointed the two young men again went to\r\nSilverbridge, and after he had been declared duly elected, the new\r\nMember of Parliament made his first speech. There was a meeting in\r\nthe town-hall and many were assembled anxious to hear,--not the lad\'s\r\nopinions, for which probably nobody cared much,--but the tone of his\r\nvoice and to see his manner. Of what sort was the eldest son of the\r\nman of whom the neighbourhood had been so proud? For the county was\r\nin truth proud of their Duke. Of this son whom they had now made a\r\nMember of Parliament they at present only knew that he had been sent\r\naway from Oxford,--not so very long ago,--for painting the Dean\'s\r\nhouse scarlet. The speech was not very brilliant. He told them\r\nthat he was very much obliged to them for the honour they had done\r\nhim. Though he could not follow exactly his father\'s political\r\nopinions,--he would always have before his eyes his father\'s\r\npolitical honesty and independence. He broke down two or three times\r\nand blushed, and repeated himself, and knocked his words a great deal\r\ntoo quickly one on the top of another. But it was taken very well,\r\nand was better than was expected. When it was over he wrote a line to\r\nthe Duke.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR FATHER,\r\n\r\n   I am Member of Parliament for Silverbridge,--as you used\r\n   to be in the days which I can first remember. I hope you\r\n   won\'t think that it does not make me unhappy to have\r\n   differed from you. Indeed it does. I don\'t think that\r\n   anybody has ever done so well in politics as you have.\r\n   But when a man does take up an opinion I don\'t see how\r\n   he can help himself. Of course I could have kept myself\r\n   quiet;--but then you wished me to be in the House. They\r\n   were all very civil to me at Silverbridge, but there was\r\n   very little said.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate Son,\r\n\r\n   SILVERBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nThe Duke Receives a Letter,--and Writes One\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke, when he received Mrs. Finn\'s note, demanding an interview,\r\nthought much upon the matter before he replied. She had made her\r\ndemand as though the Duke had been no more than any other gentleman,\r\nalmost as though she had a right to call upon him to wait upon her.\r\nHe understood and admired the courage of this;--but nevertheless he\r\nwould not go to her. He had trusted her with that which of all things\r\nwas the most sacred to him, and she had deceived him! He wrote to her\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Duke of Omnium presents his compliments to Mrs. Finn.\r\n   As the Duke thinks that no good could result either to\r\n   Mrs. Finn or to himself from an interview, he is obliged\r\n   to say that he would rather not do as Mrs. Finn has\r\n   requested.\r\n\r\n   But for the strength of this conviction the Duke would\r\n   have waited upon Mrs. Finn most willingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Finn when she received this was not surprised. She had felt sure\r\nthat such would be the nature of the Duke\'s answer; but she was also\r\nsure that if such an answer did come she would not let the matter\r\nrest. The accusation was so bitter to her that she would spare\r\nnothing in defending herself,--nothing in labour and nothing in time.\r\nShe would make him know that she was in earnest. As she could not\r\nsucceed in getting into his presence she must do this by letter,--and\r\nshe wrote her letter, taking two days to think of her words.\r\n\r\n\r\n   May 18, 18--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR DUKE OF OMNIUM,\r\n\r\n   As you will not come to me, I must trouble your Grace\r\n   to read what I fear will be a long letter. For it is\r\n   absolutely necessary that I should explain my conduct to\r\n   you. That you have condemned me I am sure you will not\r\n   deny;--nor that you have punished me as far as the power\r\n   of punishment was in your hands. If I can succeed in\r\n   making you see that you have judged me wrongly, I think\r\n   you will admit your error and beg my pardon. You are not\r\n   one who from your nature can be brought easily to do this;\r\n   but you are one who will certainly do it if you can be\r\n   made to feel that by not doing so you would be unjust. I\r\n   am myself so clear as to my own rectitude of purpose and\r\n   conduct, and am so well aware of your perspicuity, that\r\n   I venture to believe that if you will read this letter I\r\n   shall convince you.\r\n\r\n   Before I go any further I will confess that the matter is\r\n   one,--I was going to say almost of life and death to me.\r\n   Circumstances, not of my own seeking, have for some years\r\n   past thrown me so closely into intercourse with your\r\n   family that now to be cast off, and to be put on one side\r\n   as a disgraced person,--and that so quickly after the\r\n   death of her who loved me so dearly and who was so dear to\r\n   me,--is such an affront as I cannot bear and hold up my\r\n   head afterwards. I have come to be known as her whom your\r\n   uncle trusted and loved, as her whom your wife trusted and\r\n   loved,--obscure as I was before;--and as her whom, may I\r\n   not say, you yourself trusted? As there was much of honour\r\n   and very much of pleasure in this, so also was there\r\n   something of misfortune. Friendships are safest when the\r\n   friends are of the same standing. I have always felt there\r\n   was danger, and now the thing I feared has come home to\r\n   me.\r\n\r\n   Now I will plead my case. I fancy, that when first you\r\n   heard that I had been cognisant of your daughter\'s\r\n   engagement, you imagined that I was aware of it before I\r\n   went to Matching. Had I been so, I should have been guilty\r\n   of that treachery of which you accuse me. I did know\r\n   nothing of it till Lady Mary told me on the day before I\r\n   left Matching. That she should tell me was natural enough.\r\n   Her mother had known it, and for the moment,--if I am\r\n   not assuming too much in saying so,--I was filling her\r\n   mother\'s place. But, in reference to you, I could not\r\n   exercise the discretion which a mother might have used,\r\n   and I told her at once, most decidedly, that you must be\r\n   made acquainted with the fact.\r\n\r\n   Then Lady Mary expressed to me her wish,--not that this\r\n   matter should be kept any longer from you, for that it\r\n   should be told she was as anxious as I was myself,--but\r\n   that it should be told to you by Mr. Tregear. It was not\r\n   for me to raise any question as to Mr. Tregear\'s fitness\r\n   or unfitness,--as to which indeed I could know nothing.\r\n   All I could do was to say that if Mr. Tregear would make\r\n   the communication at once, I should feel that I had done\r\n   my duty. The upshot was that Mr. Tregear came to me\r\n   immediately on my return to London, and agreeing with me\r\n   that it was imperative that you be informed, went to you\r\n   and did inform you. In all of that, if I have told the\r\n   story truly, where has been my offence? I suppose you will\r\n   believe me, but your daughter can give evidence as to\r\n   every word that I have written.\r\n\r\n   I think that you have got it into your mind that I have\r\n   befriended Mr. Tregear\'s suit, and that, having received\r\n   this impression, you hold it with the tenacity which is\r\n   usual to you. There never was a greater mistake. I went to\r\n   Matching as the friend of my dear friend;--but I stayed\r\n   there at your request, as your friend. Had I been, when\r\n   you asked me to do so, a participator in that secret I\r\n   could not have honestly remained in the position you\r\n   assigned to me. Had I done so, I should have deserved your\r\n   ill opinion. As it is I have not deserved it, and your\r\n   condemnation of me has been altogether unjust. Should I\r\n   not now receive from you a full withdrawal of all charge\r\n   against me, I shall be driven to think that after all\r\n   the insight which circumstances have given me into your\r\n   character, I have nevertheless been mistaken in the\r\n   reading of it.\r\n\r\n   I remain,\r\n   Dear Duke of Omnium,\r\n   Yours truly,\r\n\r\n   M. FINN.\r\n\r\n   I find on looking over my letter that I must add one word\r\n   further. It might seem that I am asking for a return of\r\n   your friendship. Such is not my purpose. Neither can you\r\n   forget that you have accused me,--nor can I. What I expect\r\n   is that you should tell me that you in your conduct to me\r\n   have been wrong and that I in mine to you have been right.\r\n   I must be enabled to feel that the separation between us\r\n   has come from injury done to me, and not by me.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe did read the letter more than once, and read it with tingling\r\nears, and hot cheeks, and a knitted brow. As the letter went on, and\r\nas the woman\'s sense of wrong grew hot from her own telling of her\r\nown story, her words became stronger and still stronger, till at\r\nlast they were almost insolent in their strength. Were it not that\r\nthey came from one who did think herself to have been wronged, then\r\ncertainly they would be insolent. A sense of injury, a burning\r\nconviction of wrong sustained, will justify language which otherwise\r\nwould be unbearable. The Duke felt that, and though his ears were\r\ntingling and his brow knitted, he could have forgiven the language,\r\nif only he could have admitted the argument. He understood every word\r\nof it. When she spoke of tenacity she intended to charge him with\r\nobstinacy. Though she had dwelt but lightly on her own services she\r\nhad made her thoughts on the matter clear enough. "I, Mrs. Finn, who\r\nam nobody, have done much to succour and assist you, the Duke of\r\nOmnium; and this is the return which I have received!" And then she\r\ntold him to his face that unless he did something which it would be\r\nimpossible that he should do, she would revoke her opinion of his\r\nhonesty! He tried to persuade himself that her opinion about his\r\nhonesty was nothing to him;--but he failed. Her opinion was very much\r\nto him. Though in his anger he had determined to throw her off from\r\nhim, he knew her to be one whose good opinion was worth having.\r\n\r\nNot a word of overt accusation had been made against his wife. Every\r\nallusion to her was full of love. But yet how heavy a charge was\r\nreally made! That such a secret should be kept from him, the father,\r\nwas acknowledged to be a heinous fault;--but the wife had known the\r\nsecret and had kept it from him, the father! And then how wretched a\r\nthing it was for him that any one should dare to write to him about\r\nthe wife that had been taken away from him! In spite of all her\r\nfaults her name was so holy to him that it had never once passed\r\nhis lips since her death, except in low whispers to himself,--low\r\nwhispers made in the perfect, double-guarded seclusion of his own\r\nchamber. "Cora, Cora," he had murmured, so that the sense of the\r\nsound and not the sound itself had come to him from his own lips. And\r\nnow this woman wrote to him about her freely, as though there were\r\nnothing sacred, no religion in the memory of her.\r\n\r\n"It was not for me to raise any question as to Mr. Tregear\'s\r\nfitness." Was it not palpable to all the world that he was unfit?\r\nUnfit! How could a man be more unfit? He was asking for the hand of\r\none who was second only to royalty--who was possessed of everything,\r\nwho was beautiful, well-born, rich, who was the daughter of the Duke\r\nof Omnium, and he had absolutely nothing of his own to offer.\r\n\r\nBut it was necessary that he should at last come to the consideration\r\nof the actual point as to which she had written to him so forcibly.\r\nHe tried to set himself to the task in perfect honesty. He certainly\r\nhad condemned her. He had condemned her and had no doubt punished her\r\nto the extent of his power. And if he could be brought to see that he\r\nhad done this unjustly, then certainly must he beg her pardon. And\r\nwhen he considered it all, he had to own that her intimacy with his\r\nuncle and his wife had not been so much of her seeking as of theirs.\r\nIt grieved him now that it should have been so, but so it was. And\r\nafter all this,--after the affectionate surrender of herself to his\r\nwife\'s caprices which the woman had made,--he had turned upon her and\r\ndriven her away with ignominy. That was all true. As he thought of\r\nit he became hot, and was conscious of a quivering feeling round his\r\nheart. These were bonds indeed; but they were bonds of such a nature\r\nas to be capable of being rescinded and cut away altogether by\r\nabsolute bad conduct. If he could make it good to himself that in a\r\nmatter of such magnitude as the charge of his daughter she had been\r\nuntrue to him and had leagued herself against him, with an unworthy\r\nlover, then, then--all bonds would be rescinded! Then would his wrath\r\nbe altogether justified! Then would it have been impossible that\r\nhe should have done aught else than cast her out! As he thought of\r\nthis he felt sure that she had betrayed him! How great would be the\r\nignominy to him should he be driven to own to himself that she had\r\nnot betrayed him! "There should not have been a moment," he said to\r\nhimself over and over again,--"not a moment!" Yes;--she certainly had\r\nbetrayed him.\r\n\r\nThere might still be safety for him in that confident assertion of\r\n"not a moment;" but had there been anything of that conspiracy of\r\nwhich he had certainly at first judged her to be guilty? She had told\r\nher story, and had then appealed to Lady Mary for evidence. After\r\nfive minutes of perfect stillness,--but five minutes of misery, five\r\nminutes during which great beads of perspiration broke out from him\r\nand stood upon his brow, he had to confess to himself that he did not\r\nwant any evidence. He did believe her story. When he allowed himself\r\nto think she had been in league with Tregear he had wronged her. He\r\nwiped away the beads from his brow, and again repeated to himself\r\nthose words which were now his only comfort, "There should not have\r\nbeen a moment;--not a moment!"\r\n\r\nIt was thus and only thus that he was enabled to assure himself that\r\nthere need be no acknowledgment of wrong done on his part. Having\r\nsettled this in his own mind he forced himself to attend a meeting\r\nat which his assistance had been asked as to a complex question on\r\nLaw Reform. The Duke endeavoured to give himself up entirely to the\r\nmatter; but through it all there was the picture before him of Mrs.\r\nFinn waiting for an answer to her letter. If he should confirm\r\nhimself in his opinion that he had been right, then would any answer\r\nbe necessary? He might just acknowledge the letter, after the fashion\r\nwhich has come up in official life, than which silence is an insult\r\nmuch more bearable. But he did not wish to insult, nor to punish her\r\nfurther. He would willingly have withdrawn the punishment under which\r\nshe was groaning could he have done so without self-abasement. Or he\r\nmight write as she had done,--advocating his own cause with all his\r\nstrength, using that last one strong argument,--"there should not\r\nhave been a moment." But there would be something repulsive to his\r\npersonal dignity in the continued correspondence which this would\r\nproduce. "The Duke of Omnium regrets to say, in answer to Mrs.\r\nFinn\'s letter, that he thinks no good can be attained by a prolonged\r\ncorrespondence." Such, or of such kind, he thought must be his\r\nanswer. But would this be a fair return for the solicitude shown by\r\nher to his uncle, for the love which had made her so patient a friend\r\nto his wife, for the nobility of her own conduct in many things? Then\r\nhis mind reverted to certain jewels,--supposed to be of enormous\r\nvalue,--which were still in his possession though they were the\r\nproperty of this woman. They had been left to her by his uncle, and\r\nshe had obstinately refused to take them. Now they were lying packed\r\nin the cellars of certain bankers,--but still they were in his\r\ncustody. What should he now do in this matter? Hitherto, perhaps once\r\nin every six months, he had notified to her that he was keeping them\r\nas her curator, and she had always repeated that it was a charge from\r\nwhich she could not relieve him. It had become almost a joke between\r\nthem. But how could he joke with a woman with whom he had quarrelled\r\nafter this internecine fashion?\r\n\r\nWhat if he were to consult Lady Cantrip? He could not do so without a\r\npang that would be very bitter to him,--but any agony would be better\r\nthan that arising from a fear that he had been unjust to one who had\r\ndeserved well of him. No doubt Lady Cantrip would see it in the same\r\nlight as he had done. And then he would be able to support himself by\r\nthe assurance that that which he had judged to be right was approved\r\nof by one whom the world would acknowledge to be a good judge on such\r\na matter.\r\n\r\nWhen he got home he found his son\'s letter telling him of the\r\nelection at Silverbridge. There was something in it which softened\r\nhis heart to the young man,--or perhaps it was that in the midst\r\nof his many discomforts he wished to find something which at least\r\nwas not painful to him. That his son and his heir should insist on\r\nentering political life in opposition to him was of course a source\r\nof pain; but, putting that aside, the thing had been done pleasantly\r\nenough, and the young member\'s letter had been written with some good\r\nfeeling. So he answered the letter as pleasantly as he knew how.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SILVERBRIDGE,\r\n\r\n   I am glad that you are in Parliament and am glad also\r\n   that you should have been returned by the old borough;\r\n   though I would that you could have reconciled yourself\r\n   to adhering to the politics of your family. But there is\r\n   nothing disgraceful in such a change, and I am able to\r\n   congratulate you as a father should a son and to wish you\r\n   long life and success as a legislator.\r\n\r\n   There are one or two things I would ask you to\r\n   remember;--and firstly this, that as you have voluntarily\r\n   undertaken certain duties you are bound as an honest man\r\n   to perform them as scrupulously as though you were paid\r\n   for doing them. There was no obligation in you to seek the\r\n   post;--but having sought it and acquired it you cannot\r\n   neglect the work attached to it without being untrue to\r\n   the covenant you have made. It is necessary that a young\r\n   member of Parliament should bear this in his mind, and\r\n   especially a member who has not worked his way up to\r\n   notoriety outside the House, because to him there will be\r\n   great facility for idleness and neglect.\r\n\r\n   And then I would have you always remember the purport for\r\n   which there is a Parliament elected in this happy and free\r\n   country. It is not that some men may shine there, that\r\n   some may acquire power, or that all may plume themselves\r\n   on being the elect of the nation. It often appears to me\r\n   that some members of Parliament so regard their success\r\n   in life,--as the fellows of our colleges do too often,\r\n   thinking that their fellowships were awarded for their\r\n   comfort and not for the furtherance of any object as\r\n   education or religion. I have known gentlemen who have\r\n   felt that in becoming members of Parliament they had\r\n   achieved an object for themselves instead of thinking that\r\n   they had put themselves in the way of achieving something\r\n   for others. A member of Parliament should feel himself\r\n   to be the servant of his country,--and like every other\r\n   servant, he should serve. If this be distasteful to a man\r\n   he need not go into Parliament. If the harness gall him he\r\n   need not wear it. But if he takes the trappings, then he\r\n   should draw the coach. You are there as the guardian of\r\n   your fellow-countrymen,--that they may be safe, that they\r\n   may be prosperous, that they may be well governed and\r\n   lightly burdened,--above all that they may be free. If you\r\n   cannot feel this to be your duty, you should not be there\r\n   at all.\r\n\r\n   And I would have you remember also that the work of a\r\n   member of Parliament can seldom be of that brilliant\r\n   nature which is of itself charming; and that the young\r\n   member should think of such brilliancy as being possible\r\n   to him only at a distance. It should be your first care to\r\n   sit and listen so that the forms and methods of the House\r\n   may as it were soak into you gradually. And then you must\r\n   bear in mind that speaking in the House is but a very\r\n   small part of a member\'s work, perhaps that part which\r\n   he may lay aside altogether with the least strain on his\r\n   conscience. A good member of Parliament will be good\r\n   upstairs in the Committee Rooms, good down-stairs to make\r\n   and to keep a House, good to vote, for his party if it\r\n   may be nothing better, but for the measures also which he\r\n   believes to be for the good of his country.\r\n\r\n   Gradually, if you will give your thoughts to it, and above\r\n   all your time, the theory of legislation will sink into\r\n   your mind, and you will find that there will come upon you\r\n   the ineffable delight of having served your country to the\r\n   best of your ability.\r\n\r\n   It is the only pleasure in life which has been enjoyed\r\n   without alloy by your affectionate father,\r\n\r\n   OMNIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke in writing this letter was able for a few moments to forget\r\nMrs. Finn, and to enjoy the work which he had on hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n"Poor Boy"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new member for Silverbridge, when he entered the House to take\r\nthe oath, was supported on the right and left by two staunch old\r\nTories. Mr. Monk had seen him a few minutes previously,--Mr. Monk who\r\nof all Liberals was the firmest and than whom no one had been more\r\nstaunch to the Duke,--and had congratulated him on his election,\r\nexpressing at the same time some gentle regrets. "I only wish you\r\ncould have come among us on the other side," he said.\r\n\r\n"But I couldn\'t," said the young Lord.\r\n\r\n"I am sure nothing but a conscientious feeling would have separated\r\nyou from your father\'s friends," said the old Liberal. And then they\r\nwere parted, and the member for Silverbridge was bustled up to the\r\ntable between two staunch Tories.\r\n\r\nOf what else was done on that occasion nothing shall be said here. No\r\npolitical work was required from him, except that of helping for an\r\nhour or two to crowd the Government benches. But we will follow him\r\nas he left the House. There were one or two others quite as anxious\r\nas to his political career as any staunch old Liberal. At any rate\r\none other. He had promised that as soon as he could get away from the\r\nHouse he would go to Belgrave Square and tell Lady Mabel Grex all\r\nabout it. When he reached the square it was past seven, but Lady\r\nMabel and Miss Cassewary were still in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"There seemed to be a great deal of bustle, and I didn\'t understand\r\nmuch about it," said the member.\r\n\r\n"But you heard the speeches?" These were the speeches made on the\r\nproposing and seconding of the address.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--Lupton did it very well. Lord George didn\'t seem to be\r\nquite so good. Then Sir Timothy Beeswax made a speech, and then Mr.\r\nMonk. After that I saw other fellows going away, so I bolted too."\r\n\r\n"If I were a member of Parliament I would never leave it while the\r\nHouse was sitting," said Miss Cassewary.\r\n\r\n"If all were like that there wouldn\'t be seats for them to sit upon,"\r\nsaid Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"A persistent member will always find a seat," continued the positive\r\nold lady.\r\n\r\n"I am sure that Lord Silverbridge means to do his duty," said Lady\r\nMabel.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--I\'ve thought a good deal about it, and I mean to try. As\r\nlong as a man isn\'t called upon to speak I don\'t see why it shouldn\'t\r\nbe easy enough."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad to hear you say so! Of course after a little time you\r\nwill speak. I should so like to hear you make your first speech."\r\n\r\n"If I thought you were there, I\'m sure I should not make it at all."\r\n\r\nJust at this period Miss Cassewary, saying something as to the\r\nnecessity of dressing, and cautioning her young friend that there was\r\nnot much time to be lost, left the room.\r\n\r\n"Dressing does not take me more than ten minutes," said Lady Mabel.\r\n\r\nMiss Cassewary declared this to be nonsense, but she nevertheless\r\nleft the room. Whether she would have done so if Lord Silverbridge\r\nhad not been Lord Silverbridge, but had been some young man with whom\r\nit would not have been expedient that Lady Mabel should fall in love,\r\nmay perhaps be doubted. But then it may be taken as certain that\r\nunder such circumstances Lady Mabel herself would not have remained.\r\nShe had quite realised the duties of life, had had her little\r\nromance,--and had acknowledged that it was foolish.\r\n\r\n"I do so hope that you will do well," she said, going back to the\r\nparliamentary duties.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I shall ever do much. I shall never be like my\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why not."\r\n\r\n"There never was anybody like him. I am always amusing myself, but he\r\nnever cared for amusement."\r\n\r\n"You are very young."\r\n\r\n"As far as I can learn he was just as he is now at my age. My mother\r\nhas told me that long before she married him he used to spend all his\r\ntime in the House. I wonder whether you would mind reading the letter\r\nhe wrote me when he heard of my election."\r\n\r\nThen he took the epistle out of his pocket and handed it to Lady\r\nMabel.\r\n\r\n"He means all that he says."\r\n\r\n"He always does that."\r\n\r\n"And he really hopes that you will put your shoulder to the\r\nwheel;--even though you must do so in opposition to him."\r\n\r\n"That makes no difference. I think my father is a very fine fellow."\r\n\r\n"Shall you do all that he tells you?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--I suppose not;--except that he advises me to hold my tongue.\r\nI think that I shall do that. I mean to go down there, you know, and\r\nI daresay I shall be much the same as others."\r\n\r\n"Has he talked to you much about it?"\r\n\r\n"No;--he never talks much. Every now and then he will give me a\r\ndownright lecture, or he will write me a letter like that; but he\r\nnever talks to any of us."\r\n\r\n"How very odd."\r\n\r\n"Yes; he is odd. He seems to be fretful when we are with him. A good\r\nmany things make him unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Your poor mother\'s death."\r\n\r\n"That first;--and then there are other things. I suppose he didn\'t\r\nlike the way I came to an end at Oxford."\r\n\r\n"You were a boy then."\r\n\r\n"Of course I was very sorry for it,--though I hated Oxford. It was\r\nneither one thing nor another. You were your own master and yet you\r\nwere not."\r\n\r\n"Now you must be your own master."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"You must marry, and become a lord of the Treasury. When I was a\r\nchild I acted as a child. You know all about that."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. And now I must throw off childish things. You mean that I\r\nmustn\'t paint any man\'s house? Eh, Lady Mab."\r\n\r\n"That and the rest of it. You are a legislator now."\r\n\r\n"So is Popplecourt, who took his seat in the House of Lords two or\r\nthree months ago. He\'s the biggest young fool I know out. He couldn\'t\r\neven paint a house."\r\n\r\n"He is not an elected legislator. It makes all the difference. I\r\nquite agree with what the Duke says. Lord Popplecourt can\'t help\r\nhimself. Whether he\'s an idle young scamp or not, he must be a\r\nlegislator. But when a man goes in for it himself, as you have done,\r\nhe should make up his mind to be useful."\r\n\r\n"I shall vote with my party of course."\r\n\r\n"More than that; much more than that. If you didn\'t care for politics\r\nyou couldn\'t have taken a line of your own." When she said this she\r\nknew that he had been talked into what he had done by Tregear,--by\r\nTregear, who had ambition, and intelligence, and capacity for forming\r\nan opinion of his own. "If you do not do it for your own sake, you\r\nwill for the sake of those who,--who,--who are your friends," she\r\nsaid at last, not feeling quite able to tell him that he must do it\r\nfor the sake of those who loved him.\r\n\r\n"There are not very many I suppose who care about it."\r\n\r\n"Your father."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes,--my father."\r\n\r\n"And Tregear."\r\n\r\n"Tregear has got his own fish to fry."\r\n\r\n"Are there none others? Do you think we care nothing about it here?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Cassewary?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--Miss Cassewary! A man might have a worse friend than Miss\r\nCassewary;--and my father."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose Lord Grex cares a straw about me."\r\n\r\n"Indeed he does,--a great many straws. And so do I. Do you think I\r\ndon\'t care a straw about it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you should."\r\n\r\n"Because it is my nature to be earnest. A girl comes out into the\r\nworld so young that she becomes serious, and steady as it were, so\r\nmuch sooner than a man does."\r\n\r\n"I always think that nobody is so full of chaff as you are, Lady\r\nMab."\r\n\r\n"I am not chaffing now in recommending you to go to work in the world\r\nlike a man."\r\n\r\nAs she said this they were sitting on the same sofa, but with some\r\nspace between them. When Miss Cassewary had left the room Lord\r\nSilverbridge was standing, but after a little he had fallen into the\r\nseat, at the extreme corner, and had gradually come a little nearer\r\nto her. Now in her energy she put out her hand, meaning perhaps to\r\ntouch lightly the sleeve of his coat, meaning perhaps not quite to\r\ntouch him at all. But as she did so he put out his hand and took hold\r\nof hers.\r\n\r\nShe drew it away, not seeming to allow it to remain in his grasp for\r\na moment; but she did so, not angrily, or hurriedly, or with any\r\nflurry. She did it as though it were natural that he should take her\r\nhand and as natural that she should recover it.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I have hardly more than ten minutes left for dressing," she\r\nsaid, rising from her seat.\r\n\r\n"If you will say that you care about it, you yourself, I will do my\r\nbest." As he made this declaration blushes covered his cheeks and\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n"I do care about it,--very much; I myself," said Lady Mabel, not\r\nblushing at all. Then there was a knock at the door, and Lady Mabel\'s\r\nmaid, putting her head in, declared that my Lord had come in and\r\nhad already been some time in his dressing-room. "Good-bye, Lord\r\nSilverbridge," she said quite gaily, and rather more aloud than would\r\nhave been necessary, had she not intended that the maid also should\r\nhear her.\r\n\r\n"Poor boy!" she said to herself as she was dressing. "Poor boy!"\r\nThen, when the evening was over she spoke to herself again about him.\r\n"Dear sweet boy!" And then she sat and thought. How was it that she\r\nwas so old a woman, while he was so little more than a child? How\r\nfair he was, how far removed from conceit, how capable of being made\r\ninto a man--in the process of time! What might not be expected from\r\nhim if he could be kept in good hands for the next ten years! But in\r\nwhose hands? What would she be in ten years, she who already seemed\r\nto know the town and all its belongings so well? And yet she was as\r\nyoung in years as he. He, as she knew, had passed his twenty-second\r\nbirthday,--and so had she. That was all. It might be good for her\r\nthat she should marry him. She was ambitious. And such a marriage\r\nwould satisfy her ambition. Through her father\'s fault, and her\r\nbrother\'s, she was likely to be poor. This man would certainly be\r\nrich. Many of those who were buzzing around her from day to day, were\r\ndistasteful to her. From among them she knew that she could not take\r\na husband, let their rank and wealth be what it might. She was too\r\nfastidious, too proud, too prone to think that things should be with\r\nher as she liked them! This last was in all things pleasant to her.\r\nThough he was but a boy, there was a certain boyish manliness about\r\nhim. The very way in which he had grasped at her hand and had then\r\nblushed ruby-red at his own daring, had gone far with her. How\r\ngracious he was to look at! Dear sweet boy! Love him? No;--she did\r\nnot know that she loved him. That dream was over. She was sure\r\nhowever that she liked him.\r\n\r\nBut how would it be with him? It might be well for her to become his\r\nwife, but could it be well for him that he should become her husband?\r\nDid she not feel that it would be better for him that he should\r\nbecome a man before he married at all? Perhaps so;--but then if she\r\ndesisted would others desist? If she did not put out her bait would\r\nthere not be other hooks,--others and worse? Would not such a one,\r\nso soft, so easy, so prone to be caught and so desirable for the\r\ncatching, be sure to be made prey of by some snare?\r\n\r\nBut could she love him? That a woman should not marry a man without\r\nloving him, she partly knew. But she thought she knew also that there\r\nmust be exceptions. She would do her very best to love him. That\r\nother man should be banished from her very thoughts. She would be\r\nsuch a wife to him that he should never know that he lacked anything.\r\nPoor boy! Sweet dear boy! He, as he went away to his dinner, had\r\nhis thoughts also about her. Of all the girls he knew she was the\r\njolliest,--and of all his friends she was the pleasantest. As she was\r\nanxious that he should go to work in the House of Commons he would\r\ngo to work there. As for loving her! Well;--of course he must marry\r\nsomeone, and why not Lady Mab as well as any one else?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nThe Derby\r\n\r\n\r\nAn attendance at the Newmarket Second Spring Meeting had\r\nunfortunately not been compatible with the Silverbridge election.\r\nMajor Tifto had therefore been obliged to look after the affair\r\nalone. "A very useful mare," as Tifto had been in the habit of\r\ncalling a leggy, thoroughbred, meagre-looking brute named Coalition,\r\nwas on this occasion confided to the Major\'s sole care and judgment.\r\nBut Coalition failed, as coalitions always do, and Tifto had to\r\nreport to his noble patron that they had not pulled off the event.\r\nIt had been a match for four hundred pounds, made indeed by Lord\r\nSilverbridge, but made at the suggestion of Tifto;--and now Tifto\r\nwrote in a very bad humour about it. It had been altogether his\r\nLordship\'s fault in submitting to carry two pounds more than Tifto\r\nhad thought to be fair and equitable. The match had been lost. Would\r\nLord Silverbridge be so good as to pay the money to Mr. Green Griffin\r\nand debit him, Tifto, with the share of his loss?\r\n\r\nWe must acknowledge that the unpleasant tone of the Major\'s letter\r\nwas due quite as much to the ill-usage he had received in reference\r\nto that journey to Silverbridge, as to the loss of the race. Within\r\nthat little body there was a high-mounting heart, and that heart had\r\nbeen greatly wounded by his Lordship\'s treatment. Tifto had felt\r\nhimself to have been treated like a servant. Hardly an excuse had\r\neven been made. He had been simply told that he was not wanted. He\r\nwas apt sometimes to tell himself that he knew on which side his\r\nbread was buttered. But perhaps he hardly knew how best to keep\r\nthe butter going. There was a little pride about him which was\r\nantagonistic to the best interests of such a trade as his. Perhaps it\r\nwas well that he should inwardly suffer when injured. But it could\r\nnot be well that he should declare to such men as Nidderdale, and\r\nDolly Longstaff, and Popplecourt that he didn\'t mean to put up with\r\nthat sort of thing. He certainly should not have spoken in this\r\nstrain before Tregear. Of all men living he hated and feared him\r\nthe most. And he knew that no other man loved Silverbridge as did\r\nTregear. Had he been thinking of his bread-and-butter, instead\r\nof giving way to the mighty anger of his little bosom, he would\r\nhave hardly declared openly at the club that he would let Lord\r\nSilverbridge know that he did not mean to stand any man\'s airs. But\r\nthese extravagances were due perhaps to whisky-and-water, and that\r\nkind of intoxication which comes to certain men from momentary\r\ntriumphs. Tifto could always be got to make a fool of himself when\r\nsurrounded by three or four men of rank who, for the occasion, would\r\ntalk to him as an equal. He almost declared that Coalition had lost\r\nhis match because he had not been taken down to Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Tifto is in a deuce of a way with you," said Dolly Longstaff to the\r\nyoung member.\r\n\r\n"I know all about it," said Silverbridge, who had had an interview\r\nwith his partner since the race.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t take care he\'ll dismiss you."\r\n\r\nSilverbridge did not care much about this, knowing that words of\r\nwisdom did not ordinarily fall from the mouth of Dolly Longstaff. But\r\nhe was more moved when his friend Tregear spoke to him. "I wish you\r\nknew the kind of things that fellow Tifto says behind your back."\r\n\r\n"As if I cared!"\r\n\r\n"But you ought to care."\r\n\r\n"Do you care what every fellow says about you?"\r\n\r\n"I care very much what those say whom I choose to live with me.\r\nWhatever Tifto might say about me would be quite indifferent to\r\nme, because we have nothing in common. But you and he are bound\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"We have a horse or two in common; that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"But that is a great deal. The truth is he\'s a nasty, brawling,\r\nboasting, ill-conditioned little reptile."\r\n\r\nSilverbridge of course did not acknowledge that this was true. But he\r\nfelt it, and almost repented of his trust in Tifto. But still Prime\r\nMinister stood very well for the Derby. He was second favourite, the\r\nodds against him being only four to one. The glory of being part\r\nowner of a probable winner of the Derby was so much to him that he\r\ncould not bring himself to be altogether angry with Tifto. There\r\nwas no doubt that the horse\'s present condition was due entirely to\r\nTifto\'s care. Tifto spent in these few days just before the race the\r\ngreatest part of his time in the close vicinity of the horse, only\r\nrunning up to London now and then, as a fish comes up to the surface,\r\nfor a breath of air. It was impossible that Lord Silverbridge should\r\nseparate himself from the Major,--at any rate till after the Epsom\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nHe had paid the money for the match without a word of reproach to his\r\npartner, but still with a feeling that things were not quite as they\r\nought to be. In money matters his father had been liberal, but not\r\nvery definite. He had been told that he ought not to spend above two\r\nthousand pounds a year, and had been reminded that there was a house\r\nfor him to use both in town and in the country. But he had been given\r\nto understand also that any application made to Mr. Morton, if not\r\nvery unreasonable, would be attended with success. A solemn promise\r\nhad been exacted from him that he would have no dealings with\r\nmoney-lenders;--and then he had been set afloat. There had been a\r\nrather frequent correspondence with Mr. Morton, who had once or twice\r\nsubmitted a total of the money paid on behalf of his correspondent.\r\nLord Silverbridge, who imagined himself to be anything but\r\nextravagant, had wondered how the figures could mount up so rapidly.\r\nBut the money needed was always forthcoming, and the raising of\r\nobjections never seemed to be carried back beyond Mr. Morton. His\r\npromise to his father about the money-lenders had been scrupulously\r\nkept. As long as ready money can be made to be forthcoming without\r\nany charge for interest, a young man must be very foolish who will\r\nprefer to borrow it at twenty-five per cent.\r\n\r\nNow had come the night before the Derby, and it must be acknowledged\r\nthat the young Lord was much fluttered by the greatness of the coming\r\nstruggle. Tifto, having seen his horse conveyed to Epsom, had come up\r\nto London in order that he might dine with his partner and hear what\r\nwas being said about the race at the Beargarden. The party dining\r\nthere consisted of Silverbridge, Dolly Longstaff, Popplecourt, and\r\nTifto. Nidderdale was to have joined them, but he told them on the\r\nday before, with a sigh, that domestic duties were too strong for\r\nhim. Lady Nidderdale,--or if not Lady Nidderdale herself, then Lady\r\nNidderdale\'s mother,--was so far potent over the young nobleman as to\r\ninduce him to confine his Derby jovialities to the Derby Day. Another\r\nguest had also been expected, the reason for whose non-appearance\r\nmust be explained somewhat at length. Lord Gerald Palliser, the\r\nDuke\'s second son, was at this time at Cambridge,--being almost as\r\npopular at Trinity as his brother had been at Christ Church. It was\r\nto him quite a matter of course that he should see his brother\'s\r\nhorse run for the Derby. But, unfortunately, in this very year a\r\nstand was being made by the University pundits against a practice\r\nwhich they thought had become too general. For the last year or two\r\nit had been considered almost as much a matter of course that a\r\nCambridge undergraduate should go to the Derby as that a Member\r\nof Parliament should do so. Against this three or four rigid\r\ndisciplinarians had raised their voices,--and as a result, no young\r\nman up at Trinity could get leave to be away on the Derby pretext.\r\n\r\nLord Gerald raged against the restriction very loudly. He at first\r\nproclaimed his intention of ignoring the college authorities\r\naltogether. Of course he would be expelled. But the order itself\r\nwas to his thinking so absurd,--the idea that he should not see his\r\nbrother\'s horse run was so extravagant,--that he argued that his\r\nfather could not be angry with him for incurring dismissal in so\r\nexcellent a cause. But his brother saw things in a different light.\r\nHe knew how his father had looked at him when he had been sent away\r\nfrom Oxford, and he counselled moderation. Gerald should see the\r\nDerby, but should not encounter that heaviest wrath of all which\r\ncomes from a man\'s not sleeping beneath his college roof. There was\r\na train which left Cambridge at an early hour, and would bring him\r\ninto London in time to accompany his friends to the race-course;--and\r\nanother train, a special, which would take him down after dinner, so\r\nthat he and others should reach Cambridge before the college gates\r\nwere shut.\r\n\r\nThe dinner at the Beargarden was very joyous. Of course the state of\r\nthe betting in regard to Prime Minister was the subject generally\r\npopular for the night. Mr. Lupton came in, a gentleman well known in\r\nall fashionable circles, parliamentary, social, and racing, who was\r\nrather older than his company on this occasion, but still not so\r\nmuch so as to be found to be an incumbrance. Lord Glasslough too,\r\nand others joined them, and a good deal was said about the horse.\r\n"I never keep these things dark," said Tifto. "Of course he\'s an\r\nuncertain horse."\r\n\r\n"Most horses are," said Lupton.\r\n\r\n"Just so, Mr. Lupton. What I mean is, the Minister has got a\r\nbit of temper. But if he likes to do his best I don\'t think any\r\nthree-year-old in England can get his nose past him."\r\n\r\n"For half a mile he\'d be nowhere with the Provence filly," said\r\nGlasslough.\r\n\r\n"I\'m speaking of a Derby distance, my Lord."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a kind of thing nobody really knows," said Lupton.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen him \'ave his gallops," said the little man, who in his\r\nmoments of excitement would sometimes fall away from that exact\r\npronunciation which had been one of the studies of his life, "and\r\nhave measured his stride. I think I know what pace means. Of course\r\nI\'m not going to answer for the \'orse. He\'s a temper, but if things\r\ngo favourably, no animal that ever showed on the Downs was more\r\nlikely to do the trick. Is there any gentleman here who would like to\r\nbet me fifteen to one in hundreds against the two events,--the Derby\r\nand the Leger?" The desired odds were at once offered by Mr. Lupton,\r\nand the bet was booked.\r\n\r\nThis gave rise to other betting, and before the evening was over Lord\r\nSilverbridge had taken three-and-a-half to one against his horse\r\nto such an extent that he stood to lose twelve hundred pounds. The\r\nchampagne which he had drunk, and the news that Quousque, the first\r\nfavourite, had so gone to pieces that now there was a question which\r\nwas the first favourite, had so inflated him that, had he been left\r\nalone, he would almost have wagered even money on his horse. In the\r\nmidst of his excitement there came to him a feeling that he was\r\nallowing himself to do just that which he had intended to avoid. But\r\nthen the occasion was so peculiar! How often can it happen to a man\r\nin his life that he shall own a favourite for the Derby? The affair\r\nwas one in which it was almost necessary that he should risk a little\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nTifto, when he got into his bed, was altogether happy. He had added\r\nwhisky-and-water to his champagne, and feared nothing. If Prime\r\nMinister should win the Derby he would be able to pay all that he\r\nowed, and to make a start with money in his pocket. And then there\r\nwould be attached to him all the infinite glory of being the owner of\r\na winner of the Derby. The horse was run in his name. Thoughts as to\r\ngreat successes crowded themselves upon his heated brain. What might\r\nnot be open to him? Parliament! The Jockey Club! The mastership of\r\none of the crack shire packs! Might it not come to pass that he\r\nshould some day become the great authority in England upon races,\r\nracehorses, and hunters? If he could be the winner of a Derby and\r\nLeger he thought that Glasslough and Lupton would snub him no longer,\r\nthat even Tregear would speak to him, and that his pal the Duke\'s son\r\nwould never throw him aside again.\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge had bought a drag with all its appendages. There\r\nwas a coach, the four bay horses, the harness, and the two regulation\r\ngrooms. When making this purchase he had condescended to say a word\r\nto his father on the subject. "Everybody belongs to the four-in-hand\r\nclub now," said the son.\r\n\r\n"I never did," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Ah,--if I could be like you!"\r\n\r\nThe Duke had said that he would think about it, and then had told Mr.\r\nMorton that he was to pay the bill for this new toy. He had thought\r\nabout it, and had assured himself that driving a coach and four was\r\nat present regarded as a fitting amusement for young men of rank and\r\nwealth. He did not understand it himself. It seemed to him to be\r\nas unnatural as though a gentleman should turn blacksmith and make\r\nhorseshoes for his amusement. Driving four horses was hard work. But\r\nthe same might be said of rowing. There were men, he knew, who would\r\nspend their days standing at a lathe, making little boxes for their\r\nrecreation. He did not sympathise with it. But the fact was so, and\r\nthis driving of coaches was regarded with favour. He had been a\r\nlittle touched by that word his son had spoken. "Ah,--if I could be\r\nlike you!" So he had given the permission; the drag, horses, harness,\r\nand grooms had come into the possession of Lord Silverbridge; and now\r\nthey were put into requisition to take their triumphant owner and his\r\nparty down to Epsom. Dolly Longstaff\'s team was sent down to meet\r\nthem half-way. Gerald Palliser, who had come up from Cambridge\r\nthat morning, was allowed to drive the first stage out of town to\r\ncompensate him for the cruelty done to him by the University pundits.\r\nTifto, with a cigar in his mouth, with a white hat and a blue veil,\r\nand a new light-coloured coat, was by no means the least happy of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nHow that race was run, and how both Prime Minister and Quousque\r\nwere beaten by an outsider named Fishknife, Prime Minister, however,\r\ncoming in a good second, the present writer having no aptitude in\r\nthat way, cannot describe. Such, however, were the facts, and then\r\nDolly Longstaff and Lord Silverbridge drove the coach back to London.\r\nThe coming back was not so triumphant, though the young fellows\r\nbore their failure well. Dolly Longstaff had lost a "pot of money",\r\nSilverbridge would have to draw upon that inexhaustible Mr. Morton\r\nfor something over two thousand pounds,--in regard to which he had no\r\ndoubt as to the certainty with which the money would be forthcoming,\r\nbut he feared that it would give rise to special notice from his\r\nfather. Even the poor younger brother had lost a couple of hundred\r\npounds, for which he would have to make his own special application\r\nto Mr. Morton.\r\n\r\nBut Tifto felt it more than any one. The horse ought to have won.\r\nFishknife had been favoured by such a series of accidents that the\r\nwhole affair had been a miracle. Tifto had these circumstances at\r\nhis fingers\' ends, and in the course of the afternoon and evening\r\nexplained them accurately to all who would listen to him. He had this\r\nto say on his own behalf,--that before the party had left the course\r\ntheir horse stood first favourite for the Leger. But Tifto was\r\nunhappy as he came back to town, and in spite of the lunch, which had\r\nbeen very glorious, sat moody and sometimes even silent within his\r\ngay apparel.\r\n\r\n"It was the unfairest start I ever saw," said Tifto, almost getting\r\nup from his seat on the coach so as to address Dolly and Silverbridge\r\non the box.\r\n\r\n"What the ---- is the good of that?" said Dolly from the coach-box.\r\n"Take your licking and don\'t squeal."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well. I can take my licking as well as another\r\nman. But one has to look to the causes of these things. I never saw\r\nPeppermint ride so badly. Before he got round the corner I wished I\'d\r\nbeen on the horse myself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it was Peppermint\'s fault a bit," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Well;--perhaps not. Only I did think that I was a pretty good judge\r\nof riding."\r\n\r\nThen Tifto again settled down into silence.\r\n\r\nBut though much money had been lost, and a great deal of\r\ndisappointment had to be endured by our party in reference to the\r\nDerby, the most injurious and most deplorable event in the day\'s\r\nhistory had not occurred yet. Dinner had been ordered at the\r\nBeargarden at seven,--an hour earlier than would have been named had\r\nit not been that Lord Gerald must be at the Eastern Counties Railway\r\nStation at nine P.M. An hour and a half for dinner and a cigar\r\nafterwards, and half an hour to get to the railway station would not\r\nbe more than time enough.\r\n\r\nBut of all men alive Dolly Longstaff was the most unpunctual. He did\r\nnot arrive till eight. The others were not there before half-past\r\nseven, and it was nearly eight before any of them sat down. At\r\nhalf-past eight Silverbridge began to be very anxious about his\r\nbrother, and told him that he ought to start without further delay. A\r\nhansom cab was waiting at the door, but Lord Gerald still delayed. He\r\nknew, he said, that the special would not start till half-past nine.\r\nThere were a lot of fellows who were dining about everywhere, and\r\nthey would never get to the station by the hour fixed. It became\r\napparent to the elder brother that Gerald would stay altogether\r\nunless he were forced to go, and at last he did get up and pushed the\r\nyoung fellow out. "Drive like the very devil," he said to the cabman,\r\nexplaining to him something of the circumstances. The cabman did do\r\nhis best, but a cab cannot be made to travel from the Beargarden,\r\nwhich as all the world knows is close to St. James\'s Street, to\r\nLiverpool Street in the City in ten minutes. When Lord Gerald reached\r\nthe station the train had started.\r\n\r\nAt twenty minutes to ten the young man reappeared at the club.\r\n"Why on earth didn\'t you take a special for yourself?" exclaimed\r\nSilverbridge.\r\n\r\n"They wouldn\'t give me one." After that it was apparent to all of\r\nthem that what had just happened had done more to ruffle our hero\'s\r\ntemper than his failure and loss at the races.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t have had it happen for any money you could name," said\r\nthe elder brother to the younger, as he took him home to Carlton\r\nTerrace.\r\n\r\n"If they do send me down, what\'s the odds?" said the younger brother,\r\nwho was not quite as sober as he might have been.\r\n\r\n"After what happened to me it will almost break the governor\'s\r\nheart," said the heir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nOne of the Results of the Derby\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning at about eleven Silverbridge and his brother\r\nwere at breakfast at an hotel in Jermyn Street. They had slept in\r\nCarlton Terrace, but Lord Gerald had done so without the knowledge of\r\nthe Duke. Lord Silverbridge, as he was putting himself to bed, had\r\nmade up his mind to tell the story to the Duke at once, but when the\r\nmorning came his courage failed him. The two young men therefore\r\nslunk out of the house, and as there was no breakfasting at the\r\nBeargarden they went to this hotel. They were both rather gloomy, but\r\nthe elder brother was the more sad of the two. "I\'d give anything I\r\nhave in the world," he said, "that you hadn\'t come up at all."\r\n\r\n"Things have been so unfortunate!"\r\n\r\n"Why the deuce wouldn\'t you go when I told you?"\r\n\r\n"Who on earth would have thought that they\'d have been so punctual?\r\nThey never are punctual on the Great Eastern. It was an infernal\r\nshame. I think I shall go at once to Harnage and tell him all about\r\nit." Mr. Harnage was Lord Gerald\'s tutor.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve been in ever so many rows before."\r\n\r\n"Well,--I\'ve been gated, and once when they\'d gated me I came right\r\nupon Harnage on the bridge at King\'s."\r\n\r\n"What sort of a fellow is he?"\r\n\r\n"He used to be good-natured. Now he has taken ever so many crotchets\r\ninto his head. It was he who began all this about none of the men\r\ngoing to the Derby."\r\n\r\n"Did you ask him yourself for leave?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. And when I told him about your owning Prime Minister he got\r\nsavage and declared that was the very reason why I shouldn\'t go."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t tell me that."\r\n\r\n"I was determined I would go. I wasn\'t going to be made a child of."\r\n\r\nAt last it was decided that the two brothers should go down to\r\nCambridge together. Silverbridge would be able to come back to London\r\nthe same evening, so as to take his drag down to the Oaks on the\r\nFriday,--a duty from which even his present misery would not deter\r\nhim. They reached Cambridge at about three, and Lord Silverbridge at\r\nonce called at the Master\'s lodge and sent in his card. The Master\r\nof Trinity is so great that he cannot be supposed to see all comers,\r\nbut on this occasion Lord Silverbridge was fortunate. With much\r\ntrepidation he told his story. Such being the circumstances, could\r\nanything be done to moderate the vials of wrath which must doubtless\r\nbe poured out over the head of his unfortunate brother?\r\n\r\n"Why come to me?" said the Master. "From what you say yourself, it is\r\nevident that you know that this must rest with the College tutor."\r\n\r\n"I thought, sir, if you would say a word."\r\n\r\n"Do you think it would be right that I should interfere for one\r\nspecial man, and that a man of special rank?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody thinks that would count for anything. But--"\r\n\r\n"But what?" asked the Master.\r\n\r\n"If you knew my father, sir!"\r\n\r\n"Everybody knows your father;--every Englishman I mean. Of course I\r\nknow your father,--as a public man, and I know how much the country\r\nowes to him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it does. But it is not that I mean. If you knew how this\r\nwould,--would,--would break his heart." Then there came a tear into\r\nthe young man\'s eye,--and there was something almost like a tear in\r\nthe eye of the old man too. "Of course it was my fault. I got him to\r\ncome. He hadn\'t the slightest intention of staying. I think you will\r\nbelieve what I say about that, sir."\r\n\r\n"I believe every word you say, my Lord."\r\n\r\n"I got into a row at Oxford. I daresay you heard. There never was\r\nanything so stupid. That was a great grief to my father,--a very\r\ngreat grief. It is so hard upon him because he never did anything\r\nfoolish himself."\r\n\r\n"You should try to imitate him." Silverbridge shook his head. "Or at\r\nleast not to grieve him."\r\n\r\n"That is it. He has got over the affair about me. As I\'m the eldest\r\nson I\'ve got into Parliament, and he thinks perhaps that all has been\r\nforgotten. An eldest son may, I fancy, be a greater ass than his\r\nyounger brother." The Master could not but smile as he thought of\r\nthe selection which had been made of a legislator. "But if Gerald is\r\nsent down, I don\'t know how he\'ll get over it." And now the tears\r\nabsolutely rolled down the young man\'s face, so that he was forced to\r\nwipe them from his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Master was much moved. That a young man should pray for himself\r\nwould be nothing to him. The discipline of the college was not in\r\nhis hands, and such prayers would avail nothing with him. Nor would\r\na brother praying simply for a brother avail much. A father asking\r\nfor his son might be resisted. But the brother asking pardon for the\r\nbrother on behalf of the father was almost irresistible. But this man\r\nhad long been in a position in which he knew that no such prayers\r\nshould ever prevail at all. In the first place it was not his\r\nbusiness. If he did anything, it would only be by asking a favour\r\nwhen he knew that no favour should be granted;--and a favour which\r\nhe of all men should not ask, because to him of all men it could\r\nnot be refused. And then the very altitude of the great statesman\r\nwhom he was invited to befriend,--the position of this Duke who had\r\nbeen so powerful and might be powerful again, was against any such\r\ninterference. Of himself he might be sure that he would certainly\r\nhave done this as readily for any Mr. Jones as for the Duke of\r\nOmnium; but were he to do it, it would be said of him that it had\r\nbeen done because the man was Duke of Omnium. There are positions\r\nexalted beyond the reach of benevolence, because benevolence would\r\nseem to be self-seeking. "Your father, if he were here," said he,\r\n"would know that I could not interfere."\r\n\r\n"And will he be sent down?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know all the circumstances. From your own showing the case\r\nseems to be one of great insubordination. To tell the truth, Lord\r\nSilverbridge, I ought not to have spoken to you on the subject at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"You mean that I should not have spoken to you."\r\n\r\n"Well; I did not say so. And if you have been indiscreet I can pardon\r\nthat. I wish I could have served you; but I fear that it is not in\r\nmy power." Then Lord Silverbridge took his leave, and going to his\r\nbrother\'s rooms waited there till Lord Gerald had returned from his\r\ninterview with the tutor.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all up," said he, chucking down his cap, striving to be at his\r\nease. "I may pack up and go--just where I please. He says that on no\r\naccount will he have anything more to do with me. I asked him what I\r\nwas to do, and he said that the governor had better take my name off\r\nthe books of the college. I did ask whether I couldn\'t go over to\r\nMaclean."\r\n\r\n"Who is Maclean?"\r\n\r\n"One of the other tutors. But the brute only smiled."\r\n\r\n"He thought you meant it for chaff."\r\n\r\n"Well;--I suppose I did mean to show him that I was not going to be\r\nexterminated by him. He will write to the governor to-day. And you\r\nwill have to talk to the governor."\r\n\r\nYes! As Lord Silverbridge went back that afternoon to London he\r\nthought very much of that talking to the governor! Never yet had he\r\nbeen able to say anything very pleasant to "the governor." He had\r\nhimself been always in disgrace at Eton, and had been sent away from\r\nOxford. He had introduced Tregear into the family, which of all the\r\ntroubles perhaps was the worst. He had changed his politics. He had\r\nspent more money than he ought to have done, and now at this very\r\nmoment must ask for a large sum. And he had brought Gerald up to see\r\nthe Derby, thereby causing him to be sent away from Cambridge! And\r\nthrough it all there was present to him a feeling that by no words\r\nwhich he could use would he be able to make his father understand how\r\ndeeply he felt all this.\r\n\r\nHe could not bring himself to see the Duke that evening, and the\r\nnext morning he was sent for before he was out of bed. He found his\r\nfather at breakfast with the tutor\'s letter before him. "Do you know\r\nanything about this?" asked the Duke very calmly.\r\n\r\n"Gerald ran up to see the Derby, and in the evening missed the\r\ntrain."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Harnage tells me that he had been expressly ordered not to go to\r\nthese races."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he was, sir."\r\n\r\nThen there was silence between them for some minutes. "You might as\r\nwell sit down and eat your breakfast," said the father. Then Lord\r\nSilverbridge did sit down and poured himself out a cup of tea. There\r\nwas no servant in the room, and he dreaded to ring the bell. "Is\r\nthere anything you want?" asked the Duke. There was a small dish\r\nof fried bacon on the table, and some cold mutton on the sideboard.\r\nSilverbridge, declaring that he had everything that was necessary,\r\ngot up and helped himself to the cold mutton. Then again there was\r\nsilence, during which the Duke crunched his toast and made an attempt\r\nat reading the newspaper. But, soon pushing that aside, he again took\r\nup Mr. Harnage\'s letter. Silverbridge watched every motion of his\r\nfather as he slowly made his way through the slice of cold mutton.\r\n"It seems that Gerald is to be sent away altogether."\r\n\r\n"I fear so, sir."\r\n\r\n"He has profited by your example at Oxford. Did you persuade him to\r\ncome to these races?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I did."\r\n\r\n"Though you knew the orders which had been given?"\r\n\r\n"I thought it was meant that he should not be away the night."\r\n\r\n"He had asked permission to go to the Derby and had been positively\r\nrefused. Did you know that?"\r\n\r\nSilverbridge sat for some moments considering. He could not at first\r\nquite remember what he had known and what he had not known. Perhaps\r\nhe entertained some faint hope that the question would be allowed to\r\npass unanswered. He saw, however, from his father\'s eye that that was\r\nimpossible. And then he did remember it all. "I suppose I did know\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"And you were willing to imperil your brother\'s position in life, and\r\nmy happiness, in order that he might see a horse, of which I believe\r\nyou call yourself part owner, run a race?"\r\n\r\n"I thought there would be no risk if he got back the same night. I\r\ndon\'t suppose there is any good in my saying it, but I never was so\r\nsorry for anything in all my life. I feel as if I could go and hang\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"That is absurd,--and unmanly," said the Duke. The expression of\r\nsorrow, as it had been made, might be absurd and unmanly, but\r\nnevertheless it had touched him. He was severe because he did not\r\nknow how far his severity wounded. "It is a great blow,--another\r\ngreat blow! Races! A congregation of all the worst blackguards in the\r\ncountry mixed with the greatest fools."\r\n\r\n"Lord Cantrip was there," said Silverbridge; "and I saw Sir Timothy\r\nBeeswax."\r\n\r\n"If the presence of Sir Timothy be an allurement to you, I pity you\r\nindeed. I have nothing further to say about it. You have ruined your\r\nbrother." He had been driven to further anger by this reference to\r\none man whom he respected, and to another whom he despised.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that, sir."\r\n\r\n"What am I to say?"\r\n\r\n"Let him be an attache, or something of that sort."\r\n\r\n"Do you believe it possible that he should pass any examination?\r\nI think that my children between them will bring me to the grave.\r\nYou had better go now. I suppose you will want to be--at the races\r\nagain." Then the young man crept out of the room, and going to his\r\nown part of the house shut himself up alone for nearly an hour. What\r\nhad he better do to give his father some comfort? Should he abandon\r\nracing altogether, sell his share of Prime Minister and Coalition,\r\nand go in hard and strong for committees, debates, and divisions?\r\nShould he get rid of his drag, and resolve to read up parliamentary\r\nliterature? He was resolved upon one thing at any rate. He would\r\nnot go to the Oaks that day. And then he was resolved on another\r\nthing. He would call on Lady Mab Grex and ask her advice. He felt so\r\ndisconsolate and insufficient for himself that he wanted advice from\r\nsomeone whom he could trust.\r\n\r\nHe found Tifto, Dolly Longstaff, and one or two others at the\r\nstables, from whence it was intended that the drag should start. They\r\nwere waiting, and rather angry because they had been kept waiting.\r\nBut the news, when it came, was very sad indeed. "You wouldn\'t mind\r\ntaking the team down and back yourself; would you, Dolly?" he said to\r\nLongstaff.\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t going!" said Dolly, assuming a look of much heroic\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n"No;--I am not going to-day."\r\n\r\n"What\'s up?" asked Popplecourt.\r\n\r\n"That\'s rather sudden; isn\'t it?" asked the Major.\r\n\r\n"Well; yes; I suppose it is sudden."\r\n\r\n"It\'s throwing us over a little, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Not that I see. You\'ve got the trap and the horses."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--we\'ve got the trap and the horses," said Dolly, "and I vote we\r\nmake a start."\r\n\r\n"As you are not going yourself, perhaps I\'d better drive your\r\nhorses," said Tifto.\r\n\r\n"Dolly will take the team," said his Lordship.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--decidedly. I will take the team," said Dolly. "There isn\'t a\r\ndeal of driving wanted on the road to Epsom, but a man should know\r\nhow to hold his reins." This of course gave rise to some angry words,\r\nbut Silverbridge did not stop to hear them.\r\n\r\nThe poor Duke had no one to whom he could go for advice and\r\nconsolation. When his son left him he turned to his newspaper, and\r\ntried to read it--in vain. His mind was too ill at ease to admit of\r\npolitical matters. He was greatly grieved by this new misfortune as\r\nto Gerald, and by Lord Silverbridge\'s propensity to racing.\r\n\r\nBut though these sorrows were heavy, there was a sorrow heavier than\r\nthese. Lady Cantrip had expressed an opinion almost in favour of\r\nTregear--and had certainly expressed an opinion in favour of Mrs.\r\nFinn. The whole affair in regard to Mrs. Finn had been explained to\r\nher, and she had told the Duke that, according to her thinking, Mrs.\r\nFinn had behaved well! When the Duke, with an energy which was by no\r\nmeans customary with him, had asked that question, on the answer to\r\nwhich so much depended, "Should there have been a moment lost?" Lady\r\nCantrip had assured him that not a moment had been lost. Mrs. Finn\r\nhad at once gone to work, and had arranged that the whole affair\r\nshould be told to him, the Duke, in the proper way. "I think she\r\ndid," said Lady Cantrip, "what I myself should have done in similar\r\ncircumstances."\r\n\r\nIf Lady Cantrip was right, then must his apology to Mrs. Finn be\r\nample and abject. Perhaps it was this feeling which at the moment was\r\nmost vexatious to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n"No; My Lord, I Do Not"\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween two and three o\'clock Lord Silverbridge, in spite of his\r\nsorrow, found himself able to eat his lunch at his club. The place\r\nwas deserted, the Beargarden world having gone to the races. As he\r\nsat eating cold lamb and drinking soda-and-brandy he did confirm\r\nhimself in certain modified resolutions, which might be more probably\r\nkept than those sterner laws of absolute renunciation to which he had\r\nthought of pledging himself in his half-starved morning condition.\r\nHis father had spoken in very strong language against racing,--saying\r\nthat those who went were either fools or rascals. He was sure that\r\nthis was exaggerated. Half the House of Lords and two-thirds of the\r\nHouse of Commons were to be seen at the Derby; but no doubt there\r\nwere many rascals and fools, and he could not associate with the\r\nlegislators without finding himself among the fools and rascals. He\r\nwould,--as soon as he could,--separate himself from the Major. And\r\nhe would not bet. It was on that side of the sport that the rascals\r\nand the fools showed themselves. Of what service could betting be\r\nto him whom Providence had provided with all things wanted to make\r\nlife pleasant? As to the drag, his father had in a certain measure\r\napproved of that, and he would keep the drag, as he must have some\r\nrelaxation. But his great effort of all should be made in the House\r\nof Commons. He would endeavour to make his father perceive that he\r\nhad appreciated that letter. He would always be in the House soon\r\nafter four, and would remain there,--for, if possible, as long as the\r\nSpeaker sat in the chair. He had already begun to feel that there was\r\na difficulty in keeping his seat upon those benches. The half-hours\r\nthere would be so much longer than elsewhere! An irresistible desire\r\nof sauntering out would come upon him. There were men the very sound\r\nof whose voices was already odious to him. There had come upon him a\r\nfeeling in regard to certain orators, that when once they had begun\r\nthere was no reason why they should ever stop. Words of some sort\r\nwere always forthcoming, like spiders\' webs. He did not think that he\r\ncould learn to take a pleasure in sitting in the House; but he hoped\r\nthat he might be man enough to do it, though it was not pleasant. He\r\nwould begin to-day, instead of going to the Oaks.\r\n\r\nBut before he went to the House he would see Lady Mabel Grex. And\r\nhere it may be well to state that in making his resolutions as to\r\na better life, he had considered much whether it would not be well\r\nfor him to take a wife. His father had once told him that when he\r\nmarried, the house in Carlton Terrace should be his own. "I will be a\r\nlodger if you will have me," said the Duke; "or if your wife should\r\nnot like that, I will find a lodging elsewhere." This had been in the\r\nsadness and tenderness which had immediately followed the death of\r\nthe Duchess. Marriage would steady him. Were he a married man, Tifto\r\nwould of course disappear. Upon the whole he thought it would be good\r\nthat he should marry. And, if so, who could be so nice as Lady Mabel?\r\nThat his father would be contented with Lady Mab, he was inclined to\r\nbelieve. There was no better blood in England. And Lady Mabel was\r\nknown to be clever, beautiful, and, in her peculiar circumstances,\r\nvery wise.\r\n\r\nHe was aware, however, of a certain drawback. Lady Mabel as his wife\r\nwould be his superior, and in some degree his master. Though not\r\nolder she was wiser than he,--and not only wiser but more powerful\r\nalso. And he was not quite sure but that she regarded him as a\r\nboy. He thought that she did love him,--or would do so if he asked\r\nher,--but that her love would be bestowed upon him as on an inferior\r\ncreature. He was already jealous of his own dignity, and fearful lest\r\nhe should miss the glory of being loved by this lovely one for his\r\nown sake,--for his own manhood, and his own gifts and his own\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAnd yet his attraction to her was so great that now in the day of his\r\nsorrow he could think of no solace but what was to be found in her\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n"Not at the Oaks!" she said as soon as he was shown into the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n"No;--not at the Oaks. Lord Grex is there, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--that is a matter of course. Why are you a recreant?"\r\n\r\n"The House sits to-day."\r\n\r\n"How virtuous! Is it coming to that,--that when the House sits you\r\nwill never be absent?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the kind of life I\'m going to lead. You haven\'t heard about\r\nGerald?"\r\n\r\n"About your brother?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--you haven\'t heard?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word. I hope there is no misfortune."\r\n\r\n"But indeed there is,--a most terrible misfortune." Then he told the\r\nwhole story. How Gerald had been kept in London, and how he had gone\r\ndown to Cambridge,--all in vain; how his father had taken the matter\r\nto heart, telling him that he had ruined his brother; and how he, in\r\nconsequence, had determined not to go to the races. "Then he said,"\r\ncontinued Silverbridge, "that his children between them would bring\r\nhim to his grave."\r\n\r\n"That was terrible."\r\n\r\n"Very terrible."\r\n\r\n"But what did he mean by that?" asked Lady Mabel, anxious to hear\r\nsomething about Lady Mary and Tregear.\r\n\r\n"Well; of course what I did at Oxford made him unhappy; and now there\r\nis this affair of Gerald\'s."\r\n\r\n"He did not allude to your sister?"\r\n\r\n"Yes he did. You have heard of all that. Tregear told you."\r\n\r\n"He told me something."\r\n\r\n"Of course my father does not like it."\r\n\r\n"Do you approve of it?"\r\n\r\n"No," said he--curtly and sturdily.\r\n\r\n"Why not? You like Tregear."\r\n\r\n"Certainly I like Tregear. He is the friend, among men, whom I like\r\nthe best. I have only two real friends."\r\n\r\n"Who are they?" she asked, sinking her voice very low.\r\n\r\n"He is one;--and you are the other. You know that."\r\n\r\n"I hoped that I was one," she said. "But if you love Tregear so\r\ndearly, why do you not approve of him for your sister?"\r\n\r\n"I always knew it would not do."\r\n\r\n"But why not?"\r\n\r\n"Mary ought to marry a man of higher standing."\r\n\r\n"Of higher rank you mean. The daughters of Dukes have married\r\ncommoners before."\r\n\r\n"It is not exactly that. I don\'t like to talk of it in that way. I\r\nknew it would make my father unhappy. In point of fact he can\'t marry\r\nher. What is the good of approving of a thing that is impossible?"\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew your sister. Is she--firm?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed she is."\r\n\r\n"I am not so sure that you are."\r\n\r\n"No," said he, after considering awhile; "nor am I. But she is not\r\nlike Gerald or me. She is more obstinate."\r\n\r\n"Less fickle perhaps."\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you choose to call it fickle. I don\'t know that I am fickle.\r\nIf I were in love with a girl I should be true to her."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure of that?"\r\n\r\n"Quite sure. If I were really in love with her I certainly should not\r\nchange. It is possible that I might be bullied out of it."\r\n\r\n"But she will not be bullied out of it?"\r\n\r\n"Mary? No. That is just it. She will stick to it if he does."\r\n\r\n"I would if I were she. Where will you find any young man equal to\r\nFrank Tregear?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you mean to cut poor Mary out."\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t a nice thing for you to say, Lord Silverbridge. Frank is\r\nmy cousin,--as indeed you are also; but it so happens that I have\r\nseen a great deal of him all my life. And, though I don\'t want to cut\r\nyour sister out, as you so prettily say, I love him well enough to\r\nunderstand that any girl whom he loves ought to be true to him."\r\nSo far what she said was very well, but she afterwards added a\r\nword which might have been wisely omitted. "Frank and I are almost\r\nbeggars."\r\n\r\n"What an accursed thing money is," he exclaimed, jumping up from his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t agree with you at all. It is a very comfortable thing."\r\n\r\n"How is anybody who has got it to know if anybody cares for him?"\r\n\r\n"You must find that out. There is such a thing I suppose as real\r\nsympathy."\r\n\r\n"You tell me to my face that you and Tregear would have been lovers\r\nonly that you are both poor."\r\n\r\n"I never said anything of the kind."\r\n\r\n"And that he is to be passed on to my sister because it is supposed\r\nthat she will have some money."\r\n\r\n"You are putting words into my mouth which I never spoke, and ideas\r\ninto my mind which I never thought."\r\n\r\n"And of course I feel the same about myself. How can a fellow help\r\nit? I wish you had a lot of money, I know."\r\n\r\n"It is very kind of you;--but why?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--I can\'t explain myself," he said, blushing as was his wont.\r\n"I daresay it wouldn\'t make any difference."\r\n\r\n"It would make a great difference to me. As it is, having none, and\r\nknowing as I do that papa and Percival are getting things into a\r\nworse mess every day, I am obliged to hope that I may some day marry\r\na man who has got an income."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," said he, still blushing, but frowning at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"You see I can be very frank with a real friend. But I am sure of\r\nmyself in this,--that I will never marry a man I do not love. A girl\r\nneedn\'t love a man unless she likes it, I suppose. She doesn\'t tumble\r\ninto love as she does into the fire. It would not suit me to marry a\r\npoor man, and so I don\'t mean to fall in love with a poor man."\r\n\r\n"But you do mean to fall in love with a rich one?"\r\n\r\n"That remains to be seen, Lord Silverbridge. The rich man will at any\r\nrate have to fall in love with me first. If you know of any one you\r\nneed not tell him to be too sure because he has a good income."\r\n\r\n"There\'s Popplecourt. He\'s his own master, and, fool as he is, he\r\nknows how to keep his money."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want a fool. You must do better for me than Lord\r\nPopplecourt."\r\n\r\n"What do you say to Dolly Longstaff?"\r\n\r\n"He would be just the man, only he never would take the trouble to\r\ncome out and be married."\r\n\r\n"Or Glasslough?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he is cross, and wouldn\'t let me have my own way."\r\n\r\n"I can only think of one other;--but you would not take him."\r\n\r\n"Then you had better not mention him. It is no good crowding the list\r\nwith impossibles."\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of--myself."\r\n\r\n"You are certainly one of the impossibles."\r\n\r\n"Why, Lady Mab?"\r\n\r\n"For twenty reasons. You are too young, and you are bound to oblige\r\nyour father, and you are to be wedded to Parliament,--at any rate for\r\nthe next ten years. And altogether it wouldn\'t do,--for a great many\r\nreasons."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you don\'t like me well enough?"\r\n\r\n"What a question to ask! No; my Lord, I do not. There; that\'s what\r\nyou may call an answer. Don\'t you pretend to look offended, because\r\nif you do, I shall laugh at you. If you may have your joke surely I\r\nmay have mine."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see any joke in it."\r\n\r\n"But I do. Suppose I were to say the other thing. Oh, Lord\r\nSilverbridge, you do me so much honour! And now I come to think about\r\nit, there is no one in the world I am so fond of as you. Would that\r\nsuit you?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly."\r\n\r\n"But it wouldn\'t suit me. There\'s papa. Don\'t run away."\r\n\r\n"It\'s ever so much past five," said the legislator, "and I had\r\nintended to be in the House more than an hour ago. Good-bye. Give my\r\nlove to Miss Cassewary."\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Miss Cassewary is your most devoted friend. Won\'t you\r\nbring your sister to see me some day?"\r\n\r\n"When she is in town I will."\r\n\r\n"I should so like to know her. Good-bye."\r\n\r\nAs he hurried down to the House in a hansom he thought over it all,\r\nand told himself that he feared it would not do. She might perhaps\r\naccept him, but if so, she would do it simply in order that she might\r\nbecome Duchess of Omnium. She might, he thought, have accepted him\r\nthen, had she chosen. He had spoken plainly enough. But she had\r\nlaughed at him. He felt that if she loved him, there ought to have\r\nbeen something of that feminine tremor, of that doubting, hesitating\r\nhalf-avowal of which he had perhaps read in novels, and which his\r\nown instincts taught him to desire. But there had been no tremor nor\r\nhesitating. "No; my Lord, I do not," she had said when he asked her\r\nto her face whether she liked him well enough to be his wife. "No; my\r\nLord, I do not." It was not the refusal conveyed in these words which\r\nannoyed him. He did believe that if he were to press his suit with\r\nthe usual forms she would accept him. But it was that there should be\r\nsuch a total absence of trepidation in her words and manner. Before\r\nher he blushed and hesitated and felt that he did not know how to\r\nexpress himself. If she would only have done the same, then there\r\nwould have been an equality. Then he could have seized her in his\r\narms and sworn that never, never, never would he care for any one but\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIn truth he saw everything as it was only too truly. Though she\r\nmight choose to marry him if he pressed his request, she would never\r\nsubject herself to him as he would have the girl do whom he loved.\r\nShe was his superior, and in every word uttered between them showed\r\nthat it was so. But yet how beautiful she was;--how much more\r\nbeautiful than any other thing he had ever seen!\r\n\r\nHe sat on one of the high seats behind Sir Timothy Beeswax and Sir\r\nOrlando Drought, listening, or pretending to listen, to the speeches\r\nof three or four gentlemen respecting sugar, thinking of all this\r\ntill half-past seven;--and then he went to dine with the proud\r\nconsciousness of having done his duty. The forms and methods of the\r\nHouse were, he flattered himself, soaking into him gradually,--as his\r\nfather had desired. The theory of legislation was sinking into his\r\nmind. The welfare of the nation depended chiefly on sugar. But he\r\nthought that, after all, his own welfare must depend on the\r\npossession of Mab Grex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n"Then He Will Come Again"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mabel, when her young lover left her, was for a time freed from\r\nthe necessity of thinking about him by her father. He had returned\r\nfrom the Oaks in a very bad humour. Lord Grex had been very badly\r\ntreated by his son, whom he hated worse than any one else in the\r\nworld. On the Derby Day he had won a large sum of money, which had\r\nbeen to him at the time a matter of intense delight,--for he was\r\nin great want of money. But on this day he had discovered that his\r\nson and heir had lost more than he had won, and an arrangement had\r\nbeen suggested to him that his winnings should go to pay Percival\'s\r\nlosings. This was a mode of settling affairs to which the Earl would\r\nnot listen for a moment, had he possessed the power of putting a veto\r\nupon it. But there had been a transaction lately between him and his\r\nson with reference to the cutting off a certain entail under which\r\nmoney was to be paid to Lord Percival. This money had not yet been\r\nforthcoming, and therefore the Earl was constrained to assent. This\r\nwas very distasteful to the Earl, and he came home therefore in a bad\r\nhumour, and said a great many disagreeable things to his daughter.\r\n"You know, papa, if I could do anything I would." This she said in\r\nanswer to a threat, which he had made often before and now repeated,\r\nof getting rid altogether of the house in Belgrave Square. Whenever\r\nhe made this threat he did not scruple to tell her that the house had\r\nto be kept up solely for her welfare. "I don\'t see why the deuce you\r\ndon\'t get married. You\'ll have to do it sooner or later." That was\r\nnot a pleasant speech for a daughter to hear from her father. "As to\r\nthat," she said, "it must come or not as chance will have it. If you\r\nwant me to sign anything I will sign it;"--for she had been asked\r\nto sign papers, or in other words to surrender rights;--"but for\r\nthat other matter it must be left to myself." Then he had been very\r\ndisagreeable indeed.\r\n\r\nThey dined out together,--of course with all the luxury that wealth\r\ncan give. There was a well-appointed carriage to take them backwards\r\nand forwards to the next square, such as an Earl should have. She\r\nwas splendidly dressed, as became an Earl\'s daughter, and he was\r\nbrilliant with some star which had been accorded to him by his\r\nsovereign\'s grateful minister in return for staunch parliamentary\r\nsupport. No one looking at them could have imagined that such a\r\nfather could have told such a daughter that she must marry herself\r\nout of the way because as an unmarried girl she was a burden.\r\n\r\nDuring the dinner she was very gay. To be gay was the habit,--we may\r\nalmost say the work,--of her life. It so chanced that she sat between\r\nSir Timothy Beeswax, who in these days was a very great man indeed,\r\nand that very Dolly Longstaff, whom Silverbridge in his irony had\r\nproposed to her as a fitting suitor for her hand.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t Lord Silverbridge a cousin of yours?" asked Sir Timothy.\r\n\r\n"A very distant one."\r\n\r\n"He has come over to us, you know. It is such a triumph."\r\n\r\n"I was so sorry to hear it." This, however, as the reader knows, was\r\na fib.\r\n\r\n"Sorry!" said Sir Timothy. "Surely Lord Grex\'s daughter must be a\r\nConservative."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--I am a Conservative because I was born one. I think that\r\npeople in politics should remain as they are born,--unless they are\r\nvery wise indeed. When men come to be statesmen and all that kind of\r\nthing, of course they can change backwards and forwards."\r\n\r\n"I hope that is not intended for me, Lady Mabel."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. I don\'t know enough about it to be personal." That,\r\nhowever, was again not quite true. "But I have the greatest possible\r\nrespect for the Duke, and I think it a pity that he should be made\r\nunhappy by his son. Don\'t you like the Duke?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes;--in a way. He is a most respectable man; and has been a\r\ngood public servant."\r\n\r\n"All our lot are ruined, you know," said Dolly, talking of the races.\r\n\r\n"Who are your lot, Mr. Longstaff?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m one myself."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"I\'m utterly smashed. Then there\'s Percival."\r\n\r\n"I hope he has not lost much. Of course you know he\'s my brother."\r\n\r\n"Oh laws;--so he is. I always put my foot in it. Well;--he has lost\r\na lot. And so have Silverbridge and Tifto. Perhaps you don\'t know\r\nTifto."\r\n\r\n"I have not the pleasure of knowing Mr. Tifto."\r\n\r\n"He is a major. I think you\'d like Major Tifto. He\'s a sort of racing\r\ncoach to Silverbridge. You ought to know Tifto. And Tregear is pretty\r\nnearly cleared out."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Tregear! Frank Tregear!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m told he has been hit very heavy. I hope he\'s not a friend of\r\nyours, Lady Mabel."\r\n\r\n"Indeed he is;--a very dear friend and a cousin."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I hear. He\'s very much with Silverbridge you know."\r\n\r\n"I cannot think that Mr. Tregear has lost money."\r\n\r\n"I hope he hasn\'t. I know I have. I wish someone would stick up for\r\nme, and say that it was impossible."\r\n\r\n"But that is not Mr. Tregear\'s way of living. I can understand that\r\nLord Silverbridge or Percival should lose money."\r\n\r\n"Or me?"\r\n\r\n"Or you, if you like to say so."\r\n\r\n"Or Tifto?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about Mr. Tifto."\r\n\r\n"Major Tifto."\r\n\r\n"Or Major Tifto;--what does it signify?"\r\n\r\n"No;--of course. We inferior people may lose our money just as we\r\nplease. But a man who can look as clever as Mr. Tregear ought to win\r\nalways."\r\n\r\n"I told you just now that he was a friend of mine."\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you think that he does look clever?" There could be no\r\nquestion but that Tregear, when he disliked his company, could show\r\nhis dislike by his countenance; and it was not improbable that he\r\nhad done so in the presence of Mr. Adolphus Longstaff. "Now tell the\r\ntruth, Lady Mabel; does he not look conceited sometimes?"\r\n\r\n"He generally looks as if he knew what he was talking about, which is\r\nmore than some other people do."\r\n\r\n"Of course he is a great deal more clever than I am. I know that.\r\nBut I don\'t think even he can be so clever as he looks. \'Or you so\r\nstupid,\' that\'s what you ought to say now."\r\n\r\n"Sometimes, Mr. Longstaff, I deny myself the pleasure of saying what\r\nI think."\r\n\r\nWhen all this was over she was very angry with herself for the\r\nanxiety she had expressed about Tregear. This Mr. Longstaff was, she\r\nthought, exactly the man to report all she had said in the public\r\nroom at the club. But she had been annoyed by what she had heard as\r\nto her friend. She knew that he of all men should keep himself free\r\nfrom such follies. Those others had, as it were, a right to make\r\nfools of themselves. It had seemed so natural that the young men of\r\nher own class should dissipate their fortunes and their reputations\r\nby every kind of extravagance! Her father had done so, and she had\r\nnever even ventured to hope that her brother would not follow her\r\nfather\'s example. But Tregear, if he gave way to such follies as\r\nthese, would soon fall headlong into a pit from which there would be\r\nno escape. And if he did fall, she knew herself well enough to be\r\naware that she could not stifle, nor even conceal, the misery which\r\nthis would occasion her. As long as he stood well before the world\r\nshe would be well able to assume indifference. But were he to be\r\nprecipitated into some bottomless misfortunes then she could only\r\nthrow herself after him. She could see him marry, and smile,--and\r\nperhaps even like his wife. And while he was doing so, she could also\r\nmarry, and resolve that the husband whom she took should be made to\r\nthink that he had a loving wife. But were Frank to die,--then must\r\nshe fall upon his body as though he had been known by all the world\r\nto be her lover. Something of this feeling came upon her now, when\r\nshe heard that he had been betting and had been unfortunate. She had\r\nbeen unable so to subdue herself as to seem to be perfectly careless\r\nabout it. She had begun by saying that she had not believed it;--but\r\nshe had believed it. It was so natural that Tregear should have done\r\nas the others did with whom he lived! But then the misfortune would\r\nbe to him so terrible,--so irremediable! The reader, however, may\r\nas well know at once that there was not a word of truth in the\r\nassertion.\r\n\r\nAfter the dinner she went home alone. There were other festivities to\r\nbe attended, had she pleased to attend them; and poor Miss Cassewary\r\nwas dressed ready to go with her as chaperone;--but Miss Cassewary\r\nwas quite satisfied to be allowed to go to bed in lieu of Mrs.\r\nMontacute Jones\'s great ball. And she had gone to her bedroom when\r\nLady Mabel went to her. "I am glad you are alone," she said, "because\r\nI want to speak to you."\r\n\r\n"Is anything wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Everything is wrong. Papa says he must give up this house."\r\n\r\n"He says that almost always when he comes back from the races, and\r\nvery often when he comes back from the club."\r\n\r\n"Percival has lost ever so much."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think my Lord will hamper himself for your brother."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t explain it, but there is some horrible money complication.\r\nIt is hard upon you and me."\r\n\r\n"Who am I?" said Miss Cassewary.\r\n\r\n"About the dearest friend that ever a poor girl had. It is hard upon\r\nyou,--and upon me. I have given up everything,--and what good have I\r\ndone?"\r\n\r\n"It is hard, my dear."\r\n\r\n"But after all I do not care much for all that. The thing has been\r\ngoing on so long that one is used to it."\r\n\r\n"What is it then?"\r\n\r\n"Ah;--yes;--what is it? How am I to tell you?"\r\n\r\n"Surely you can tell me," said the old woman, putting out her hand so\r\nas to caress the arm of the younger one.\r\n\r\n"I could tell no one else; I am sure of that. Frank Tregear has taken\r\nto gambling,--like the rest of them."\r\n\r\n"Who says so?"\r\n\r\n"He has lost a lot of money at these races. A man who sat next me\r\nat dinner,--one of those stupid do-nothing fools that one meets\r\neverywhere,--told me so. He is one of the Beargarden set, and of\r\ncourse he knows all about it."\r\n\r\n"Did he say how much?"\r\n\r\n"How is he to pay anything? Of all things that men do this is the\r\nworst. A man who would think himself disgraced for ever if he\r\naccepted a present of money will not scruple to use all his wits to\r\nrob his friend of everything that he has by studying the run of cards\r\nor by watching the paces of some brutes of horses! And they consider\r\nthemselves to be fine gentlemen! A real gentleman should never want\r\nthe money out of another man\'s pocket;--should never think of money\r\nat all."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how that is to be helped, my dear. You have got to\r\nthink of money."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have to think of it, and do think of it; and because I do so\r\nI am not what I call a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"No;--my dear; you\'re a lady."\r\n\r\n"Psha! you know what I mean. I might have had the feelings of a\r\ngentleman as well as the best man that ever was born. I haven\'t;\r\nbut I have never done anything so mean as gambling. Now I have got\r\nsomething else to tell you."\r\n\r\n"What is it? You do frighten me so when you look like that."\r\n\r\n"You may well be frightened,--for if this all comes round I shall\r\nvery soon be able to dispense with you altogether. His Royal Highness\r\nLord Silverbridge--"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Mabel?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s next door to a Royal Highness at any rate, and a much more\r\ntopping man than most of them. Well then;--His Serene Highness the\r\nheir of the Duke of Omnium has done me the inexpressible honour of\r\nasking me--to marry him."\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"You may well say, No. And to tell the truth exactly, he didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you say he did?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he did quite ask me, but he gave me to understand that\r\nhe would do so if I gave him any encouragement."\r\n\r\n"Did he mean it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--poor boy! He meant it. With a word;--with a look, he would\r\nhave been down there kneeling. He asked me whether I liked him well\r\nenough. What do you think I did?"\r\n\r\n"What did you do?"\r\n\r\n"I spared him;--out of sheer downright Christian charity! I said to\r\nmyself \'Love your neighbours.\' \'Don\'t be selfish.\' \'Do unto him as\r\nyou would he should do unto you,\'--that is, think of his welfare.\r\nThough I had him in my net, I let him go. Shall I go to heaven for\r\ndoing that?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Miss Cassewary, who was so much perturbed by\r\nthe news she had heard as to be unable to come to any opinion on the\r\npoint just raised.\r\n\r\n"Or mayn\'t I rather go to the other place? From how much\r\nembarrassment should I have relieved my father! What a friend I\r\nshould have made for Percival! How much I might have been able to do\r\nfor Frank! And then what a wife I should have made him!"\r\n\r\n"I think you would."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll never get another half so good; and he\'ll be sure to get one\r\nbefore long. It is a sort of tenderness that is quite inefficacious.\r\nHe will become a prey, as I should have made him a prey. But where is\r\nthere another who will treat him so well?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot bear to hear you speak of yourself in that way."\r\n\r\n"But it is true. I know the sort of girl he should marry. In the\r\nfirst place she should be two years younger, and four years fresher.\r\nShe should be able not only to like him and love him, but to worship\r\nhim. How well I can see her! She should have fair hair, and bright\r\ngreen-gray eyes, with the sweetest complexion, and the prettiest\r\nlittle dimples;--two inches shorter than me, and the delight of her\r\nlife should be to hang with two hands on his arm. She should have a\r\nfeeling that her Silverbridge is an Apollo upon earth. To me he is a\r\nrather foolish, but very, very sweet-tempered young man;--anything\r\nrather than a god. If I thought that he would get the fresh young\r\ngirl with the dimples then I ought to abstain."\r\n\r\n"If he was in earnest," said Miss Cassewary, throwing aside all this\r\nbadinage and thinking of the main point, "if he was in earnest he\r\nwill come again."\r\n\r\n"He was quite in earnest."\r\n\r\n"Then he will come again."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he will," said Lady Mabel. "I told him that I was too\r\nold for him, and I tried to laugh him out of it. He does not like\r\nbeing laughed at. He has been saved, and he will know it."\r\n\r\n"But if he should come again?"\r\n\r\n"I shall not spare him again. No;--not twice. I felt it to be hard to\r\ndo so once, because I so nearly love him! There are so many of them\r\nwho are odious to me, as to whom the idea of marrying them seems to\r\nbe mixed somehow with an idea of suicide."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mabel!"\r\n\r\n"But he is as sweet as a rose. If I were his sister, or his servant,\r\nor his dog, I could be devoted to him. I can fancy that his comfort\r\nand his success and his name should be everything to me."\r\n\r\n"That is what a wife ought to feel."\r\n\r\n"But I could never feel him to be my superior. That is what a\r\nwife ought in truth to feel. Think of those two young men and the\r\ndifference between them! Well;--don\'t look like that at me. I don\'t\r\noften give way, and I dare say after all I shall live to be the\r\nDuchess of Omnium." Then she kissed her friend and went away to her\r\nown room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nSir Timothy Beeswax\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had lately been a great Conservative reaction in the country,\r\nbrought about in part by the industry and good management of\r\ngentlemen who were strong on that side;--but due also in part to the\r\nblunders and quarrels of their opponents. That these opponents should\r\nhave blundered and quarrelled, being men active and in earnest, was\r\nto have been expected. Such blunderings and quarrellings have been\r\na matter of course since politics have been politics, and since\r\nreligion has been religion. When men combine to do nothing, how\r\nshould there be disagreement? When men combine to do much, how should\r\nthere not be disagreement? Thirty men can sit still, each as like the\r\nother as peas. But put your thirty men up to run a race, and they\r\nwill soon assume different forms. And in doing nothing, you can\r\nhardly do amiss. Let the doers of nothing have something of action\r\nforced upon them, and they, too, will blunder and quarrel.\r\n\r\nThe wonder is that there should ever be in a reforming party enough\r\nof consentaneous action to carry any reform. The reforming or Liberal\r\nparty in British politics had thus stumbled,--and stumbled till it\r\nfell. And now there had been a great Conservative reaction! Many of\r\nthe most Liberal constituencies in the country had been untrue to\r\ntheir old political convictions. And, as the result, Lord Drummond\r\nwas Prime Minister in the House of Lords,--with Sir Timothy Beeswax\r\nacting as first man in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that Sir Timothy had his good points as a\r\npolitician. He was industrious, patient, clear-sighted, intelligent,\r\ncourageous, and determined. Long before he had had a seat in the\r\nHouse, when he was simply making his way up to the probability of a\r\nseat by making a reputation as an advocate, he had resolved that he\r\nwould be more than an Attorney-General, more than a judge,--more,\r\nas he thought it, than a Chief Justice; but at any rate something\r\ndifferent. This plan he had all but gained,--and it must be\r\nacknowledged that he had been moved by a grand and manly ambition.\r\nBut there were drawbacks to the utility and beauty of Sir Timothy\'s\r\ncharacter as a statesman. He had no idea as to the necessity or\r\nnon-necessity of any measure whatever in reference to the well-being\r\nof the country. It may, indeed, be said that all such ideas were to\r\nhim absurd, and the fact that they should be held by his friends and\r\nsupporters was an inconvenience. He was not in accord with those who\r\ndeclare that a Parliament is a collection of windbags which puff, and\r\nblow, and crack to the annoyance of honest men. But to him Parliament\r\nwas a debating place, by having a majority in which, and by no other\r\nmeans, he,--or another,--might become the great man of the day. By no\r\nother than parliamentary means could such a one as he come to be the\r\nchief man. And this use of Parliament, either on his own behalf or\r\non behalf of others, had been for so many years present to his mind,\r\nthat there seemed to be nothing absurd in an institution supported\r\nfor such a purpose. Parliament was a club so eligible in its nature\r\nthat all Englishmen wished to belong to it. They who succeeded were\r\nacknowledged to be the cream of the land. They who dominated in it\r\nwere the cream of the cream. Those two who were elected to be the\r\nchiefs of the two parties had more of cream in their composition than\r\nany others. But he who could be the chief of the strongest party, and\r\nwho therefore, in accordance with the prevailing arrangements of the\r\ncountry, should have the power of making dukes, and bestowing garters\r\nand appointing bishops, he who by attaining the first seat should\r\nachieve the right of snubbing all before him, whether friends or\r\nfoes, he, according to the feelings of Sir Timothy, would have gained\r\nan Elysium of creaminess not to be found in any other position on the\r\nearth\'s surface. No man was more warmly attached to parliamentary\r\ngovernment than Sir Timothy Beeswax; but I do not think that he ever\r\ncared much for legislation.\r\n\r\nParliamentary management was his forte. There have been various rocks\r\non which men have shattered their barks in their attempts to sail\r\nsuccessfully into the harbours of parliamentary management. There is\r\nthe great Senator who declares to himself that personally he will\r\nhave neither friend nor foe. There is his country before him and its\r\nwelfare. Within his bosom is the fire of patriotism, and within his\r\nmind the examples of all past time. He knows that he can be just, he\r\nteaches himself to be eloquent, and he strives to be wise. But he\r\nwill not bend;--and at last, in some great solitude, though closely\r\nsurrounded by those whose love he had neglected to acquire,--he\r\nbreaks his heart.\r\n\r\nThen there is he who seeing the misfortune of that great one, tells\r\nhimself that patriotism, judgment, industry, and eloquence will not\r\nsuffice for him unless he himself can be loved. To do great things\r\na man must have a great following, and to achieve that he must be\r\npopular. So he smiles and learns the necessary wiles. He is all for\r\nhis country and his friends,--but for his friends first. He too must\r\nbe eloquent and well instructed in the ways of Parliament, must be\r\nwise and diligent; but in all that he does and all that he says he\r\nmust first study his party. It is well with him for a time;--but\r\nhe has closed the door of his Elysium too rigidly. Those without\r\ngradually become stronger than his friends within, and so he falls.\r\n\r\nBut may not the door be occasionally opened to an outsider, so that\r\nthe exterior force be diminished? We know how great is the pressure\r\nof water; and how the peril of an overwhelming weight of it may be\r\nremoved by opening the way for a small current. There comes therefore\r\nthe Statesman who acknowledges to himself that he will be pregnable.\r\nThat, as a Statesman, he should have enemies is a matter of course.\r\nAgainst moderate enemies he will hold his own. But when there comes\r\none immoderately forcible, violently inimical, then to that man he\r\nwill open his bosom. He will tempt into his camp with an offer of\r\nhigh command any foe that may be worth his purchase. This too has\r\nanswered well; but there is a Nemesis. The loyalty of officers so\r\nprocured must be open to suspicion. The man who has said bitter\r\nthings against you will never sit at your feet in contented\r\nsubmission, nor will your friend of old standing long endure to be\r\nsuperseded by such converts.\r\n\r\nAll these dangers Sir Timothy had seen and studied, and for each of\r\nthem he had hoped to be able to provide an antidote. Love cannot do\r\nall. Fear may do more. Fear acknowledges a superior. Love desires an\r\nequal. Love is to be created by benefits done, and means gratitude,\r\nwhich we all know to be weak. But hope, which refers itself to\r\nbenefits to come, is of all our feelings the strongest. And Sir\r\nTimothy had parliamentary doctrines concealed in the depths of his\r\nown bosom more important even than these. The Statesman who falls is\r\nhe who does much, and thus injures many. The Statesman who stands the\r\nlongest is he who does nothing and injures no one. He soon knew that\r\nthe work which he had taken in hand required all the art of a great\r\nconjuror. He must be possessed of tricks so marvellous that not even\r\nthey who sat nearest to him might know how they were performed.\r\n\r\nFor the executive or legislative business of the country he cared\r\nlittle. The one should be left in the hands of men who liked\r\nwork;--of the other there should be little, or, if possible, none.\r\nBut Parliament must be managed,--and his party. Of patriotism he\r\ndid not know the meaning;--few, perhaps, do, beyond a feeling that\r\nthey would like to lick the Russians, or to get the better of the\r\nAmericans in a matter of fisheries or frontiers. But he invented a\r\npseudo-patriotic conjuring phraseology which no one understood but\r\nwhich many admired. He was ambitious that it should be said of him\r\nthat he was far-and-away the cleverest of his party. He knew himself\r\nto be clever. But he could only be far-and-away the cleverest by\r\nsaying and doing that which no one could understand. If he could\r\nbecome master of some great hocus-pocus system which could be made to\r\nbe graceful to the ears and eyes of many, which might for awhile seem\r\nto have within it some semi-divine attribute, which should have all\r\nbut divine power of mastering the loaves and fishes, then would they\r\nwho followed him believe in him more firmly than other followers who\r\nhad believed in their leaders. When you see a young woman read a\r\nclosed book placed on her dorsal vertebrae,--if you do believe that\r\nshe so reads it, you think that she is endowed with a wonderful\r\nfaculty! And should you also be made to believe that the same young\r\nwoman had direct communication with Abraham, by means of some\r\ninvisible wire, you would be apt to do a great many things as\r\nthat young woman might tell you. Conjuring, when not known to be\r\nconjuring, is very effective.\r\n\r\nMuch, no doubt, of Sir Timothy\'s power had come from his praiseworthy\r\nindustry. Though he cared nothing for the making of laws, though he\r\nknew nothing of finance, though he had abandoned his legal studies,\r\nstill he worked hard. And because he had worked harder in a special\r\ndirection than others around him, therefore he was enabled to lead\r\nthem. The management of a party is a very great work in itself; and\r\nwhen to that is added the management of the House of Commons, a man\r\nhas enough upon his hands even though he neglects altogether the\r\nordinary pursuits of a Statesman. Those around Sir Timothy were fond\r\nof their party; but they were for the most part men who had not\r\ncondescended to put their shoulders to the wheel as he had done. Had\r\nthere been any very great light among them, had there been a Pitt\r\nor a Peel, Sir Timothy would have probably become Attorney-General\r\nand have made his way to the bench;--but there had been no Pitt and\r\nno Peel, and he had seen his opening. He had studied the ways of\r\nMembers. Parliamentary practice had become familiar to him. He had\r\nshown himself to be ready at all hours to fight the battle of the\r\nparty he had joined. And no man knew so well as did Sir Timothy how\r\nto elevate a simple legislative attempt into a good faction fight. He\r\nhad so mastered his tricks of conjuring that no one could get to the\r\nbottom of them, and had assumed a look of preternatural gravity which\r\nmade many young Members think that Sir Timothy was born to be a king\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nThere were no doubt some among his older supporters who felt their\r\nthraldom grievously. There were some lords in the Upper House and\r\nsome sons of the lords in the Lower,--with pedigrees going back far\r\nenough for pride,--who found it irksome to recognise Sir Timothy as\r\na master. No doubt he had worked very hard, and had worked for them.\r\nNo doubt he knew how to do the work, and they did not. There was\r\nno other man among them to whom the lead could be conveniently\r\ntransferred. But yet they were uncomfortable,--and perhaps a little\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\nIt had arisen partly from this cause, that there had been something\r\nof a counter-reaction at the last general election. When the Houses\r\nmet, the Ministers had indeed a majority, but a much lessened\r\nmajority. The old Liberal constituencies had returned to an\r\nexpression of their real feeling. This reassertion of the progress\r\nof the tide, this recovery from the partial ebb which checks the\r\nviolence of every flow, is common enough in politics; but at the\r\npresent moment there were many who said that all this had been\r\naccelerated by a feeling in the country that Sir Timothy was hardly\r\nall that the country required as the leader of the country party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nThe Duke in His Study\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was natural that at such a time, when success greater than had\r\nbeen expected had attended the efforts of the Liberals, when some\r\ndozen unexpected votes had been acquired, the leading politicians of\r\nthat party should have found themselves compelled to look about them\r\nand see how these good things might be utilised. In February they\r\ncertainly had not expected to be called to power in the course of\r\nthe existing Session. Perhaps they did not expect it yet. There was\r\nstill a Conservative majority,--though but a small majority. But the\r\nstrength of the minority consisted, not in the fact that the majority\r\nagainst them was small, but that it was decreasing. How quickly does\r\nthe snowball grow into hugeness as it is rolled on,--but when the\r\nchange comes in the weather how quickly does it melt, and before\r\nit is gone become a thing ugly, weak, and formless! Where is the\r\nindividual who does not assert to himself that he would be more loyal\r\nto a falling than to a rising friend? Such is perhaps the nature\r\nof each one of us. But when any large number of men act together,\r\nthe falling friend is apt to be deserted. There was a general\r\nfeeling among politicians that Lord Drummond\'s ministry,--or Sir\r\nTimothy\'s--was failing, and the Liberals, though they could not yet\r\ncount the votes by which they might hope to be supported in power,\r\nnevertheless felt that they ought to be looking to their arms.\r\n\r\nThere had been a coalition. They who are well read in the political\r\nliterature of their country will remember all about that. It had\r\nperhaps succeeded in doing that for which it had been intended. The\r\nQueen\'s government had been carried on for two or three years. The\r\nDuke of Omnium had been the head of that Ministry; but during those\r\nyears had suffered so much as to have become utterly ashamed of the\r\ncoalition,--so much as to have said often to himself that under no\r\ncircumstances would he again join any Ministry. At this time there\r\nwas no idea of another coalition. That is a state of things which\r\ncannot come about frequently,--which can only be reproduced by men\r\nwho have never hitherto felt the mean insipidity of such a condition.\r\nBut they who had served on the Liberal side in that coalition must\r\nagain put their shoulders to the wheel. Of course it was in every\r\nman\'s mouth that the Duke must be induced to forget his miseries and\r\nonce more to take upon himself the duties of an active servant of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nBut they who were most anxious on the subject, such men as Lord\r\nCantrip, Mr. Monk, our old friend Phineas Finn, and a few others,\r\nwere almost afraid to approach him. At the moment when the coalition\r\nwas broken up he had been very bitter in spirit, apparently almost\r\narrogant, holding himself aloof from his late colleagues,--and since\r\nthat, troubles had come to him, which had aggravated the soreness of\r\nhis heart. His wife had died, and he had suffered much through his\r\nchildren. What Lord Silverbridge had done at Oxford was matter of\r\ngeneral conversation, and also what he had not done.\r\n\r\nThat the heir of the family should have become a renegade in politics\r\nwas supposed greatly to have affected the father. Now Lord Gerald had\r\nbeen expelled from Cambridge, and Silverbridge was on the turf in\r\nconjunction with Major Tifto! Something, too, had oozed out into\r\ngeneral ears about Lady Mary,--something which should have been\r\nkept secret as the grave. It had therefore come to pass that it was\r\ndifficult even to address the Duke.\r\n\r\nThere was one man, and but one, who could do this with ease to\r\nhimself;--and that man was at last put into motion at the instance\r\nof the leaders of the party. The old Duke of St. Bungay wrote the\r\nfollowing letter to the Duke of Omnium. The letter purported to be an\r\nexcuse for the writer\'s own defalcation. But the chief object of the\r\nwriter was to induce the younger Duke once more to submit to harness.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Longroyston, 3rd June, 187--.\r\n\r\n   DEAR DUKE OF OMNIUM,\r\n\r\n   How quickly the things come round! I had thought that I\r\n   should never again have been called upon even to think of\r\n   the formation of another Liberal Ministry; and now, though\r\n   it was but yesterday that we were all telling ourselves\r\n   that we were thoroughly manumitted from our labours by the\r\n   altered opinions of the country, sundry of our old friends\r\n   are again putting their heads together.\r\n\r\n   Did they not do so they would neglect a manifest duty.\r\n   Nothing is more essential to the political well-being\r\n   of the country than that the leaders on both sides in\r\n   politics should be prepared for their duties. But for\r\n   myself, I am bound at last to put in the old plea with\r\n   a determination that it shall be respected. "Solve\r\n   senescentem." It is now, if I calculate rightly, exactly\r\n   fifty years since I first entered public life in obedience\r\n   to the advice of Lord Grey. I had then already sat five\r\n   years in the House of Commons. I assisted humbly in the\r\n   emancipation of the Roman Catholics, and have learned by\r\n   the legislative troubles of just half a century that those\r\n   whom we then invited to sit with us in Parliament have\r\n   been in all things our worst enemies. But what then? Had\r\n   we benefited only those who love us, would not the sinners\r\n   also,--or even the Tories,--have done as much as that?\r\n\r\n   But such memories are of no avail now. I write to say that\r\n   after so much of active political life, I will at last\r\n   retire. My friends when they see me inspecting a pigsty\r\n   or picking a peach are apt to remind me that I can still\r\n   stand on my legs, and with more of compliment than of\r\n   kindness will argue therefore that I ought still to\r\n   undertake active duties in Parliament. I can select my\r\n   own hours for pigs and peaches, and should I, through the\r\n   dotage of age, make mistakes as to the breeding of the one\r\n   or the flavour of the other, the harm done will not go\r\n   far. In politics I have done my work. What you and others\r\n   in the arena do will interest me more than all other\r\n   things of this world, I think and hope, to my dying day.\r\n   But I will not trouble the workers with the querulousness\r\n   of old age.\r\n\r\n   So much for myself. And now let me, as I go, say a parting\r\n   word to him with whom in politics I have been for many\r\n   years more in accord than with any other leading man. As\r\n   nothing but age or infirmity would to my own mind have\r\n   justified me in retiring, so do I think that you, who can\r\n   plead neither age nor infirmity, will find yourself at\r\n   last to want self-justification, if you permit yourself\r\n   to be driven from the task either by pride or by\r\n   indifference.\r\n\r\n   I should express my feelings better were I to say by pride\r\n   and diffidence. I look to our old friendship, to the\r\n   authority given to me by my age, and to the thorough\r\n   goodness of your heart for pardon in thus accusing you.\r\n   That little men should have ventured to ill-use you, has\r\n   hurt your pride. That these little men should have been\r\n   able to do so has created your diffidence. Put you to\r\n   a piece of work that a man may do, you have less false\r\n   pride as to the way in which you may do it than any man\r\n   I have known; and, let the way be open to you, as little\r\n   diffidence as any. But in this political mill of ours\r\n   in England, a man cannot always find the way open to do\r\n   things. It does not often happen that an English statesman\r\n   can go in and make a great score off his own bat. But not\r\n   the less is he bound to play the game and to go to the\r\n   wicket when he finds that his time has come.\r\n\r\n   There are, I think, two things for you to consider in this\r\n   matter, and two only. The first is your capacity, and the\r\n   other is your duty. A man may have found by experience\r\n   that he is unfitted for public life. You and I have known\r\n   men in regard to whom we have thoroughly wished that such\r\n   experience had been reached. But this is a matter in which\r\n   a man who doubts himself is bound to take the evidence of\r\n   those around him. The whole party is most anxious for your\r\n   co-operation. If this be so,--and I make you the assurance\r\n   from most conclusive evidence,--you are bound to accept\r\n   the common consent of your political friends on that\r\n   matter. You perhaps think that at a certain period of your\r\n   life you failed. They all agree with me that you did not\r\n   fail. It is a matter on which you should be bound by our\r\n   opinion rather than by your own.\r\n\r\n   As to that matter of duty I shall have less difficulty\r\n   in carrying you with me. Though this renewed task may be\r\n   personally disagreeable to you, even though your tastes\r\n   should lead you to some other life,--which I think is not\r\n   the case,--still if your country wants you, you should\r\n   serve your country. It is a work as to which such a one\r\n   as you has no option. Of most of those who choose public\r\n   life,--it may be said that were they not there, there\r\n   would be others as serviceable. But when a man such as you\r\n   has shown himself to be necessary, as long as health and\r\n   age permit he cannot recede without breach of manifest\r\n   duty. The work to be done is so important, the numbers to\r\n   be benefited are so great, that he cannot be justified in\r\n   even remembering that he has a self.\r\n\r\n   As I have said before, I trust that my own age and\r\n   your goodness will induce you to pardon this great\r\n   interference. But whether pardoned or not I shall always\r\n   be\r\n\r\n   Your most affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n   ST. BUNGAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke,--our Duke,--on reading this letter was by no means pleased\r\nby its contents. He could ill bear to be reminded either of his pride\r\nor of his diffidence. And yet the accusations which others made\r\nagainst him were as nothing to those with which he charged himself.\r\nHe would do this till at last he was forced to defend himself against\r\nhimself by asking himself whether he could be other than as God had\r\nmade him. It is the last and the poorest makeshift of a defence to\r\nwhich a man can be brought in his own court! Was it his fault that he\r\nwas so thin-skinned that all things hurt him? When some coarse man\r\nsaid to him that which ought not to have been said, was it his fault\r\nthat at every word a penknife had stabbed him? Other men had borne\r\nthese buffets without shrinking, and had shown themselves thereby to\r\nbe more useful, much more efficacious; but he could no more imitate\r\nthem than he could procure for himself the skin of a rhinoceros or\r\nthe tusk of an elephant. And this shrinking was what men called\r\npride,--was the pride of which his old friend wrote! "Have I\r\never been haughty, unless in my own defence?" he asked himself,\r\nremembering certain passages of humility in his life,--and certain\r\npassages of haughtiness also.\r\n\r\nAnd the Duke told him also that he was diffident. Of course he was\r\ndiffident. Was it not one and the same thing? The very pride of which\r\nhe was accused was no more than that shrinking which comes from the\r\nwant of trust in oneself. He was a shy man. All his friends and all\r\nhis enemies knew that;--it was thus that he still discoursed with\r\nhimself;--a shy, self-conscious, timid, shrinking, thin-skinned man!\r\nOf course he was diffident. Then why urge him on to tasks for which\r\nhe was by nature unfitted?\r\n\r\nAnd yet there was much in his old friend\'s letter which moved him.\r\nThere were certain words which he kept on repeating to himself. "He\r\ncannot be justified in even remembering that he has a self." It was\r\na hard thing to say of any man, but yet a true thing of such a man\r\nas his correspondent had described. His correspondent had spoken of\r\na man who should know himself to be capable of serving the State.\r\nIf a man were capable, and was sure within his own bosom of his own\r\ncapacity, it would be his duty. But what if he were not so satisfied?\r\nWhat if he felt that any labours of his would be vain, and all\r\nself-abnegation useless? His friend had told him that on that matter\r\nhe was bound to take the opinion of others. Perhaps so. But if so,\r\nhad not that opinion been given to him very plainly when he was told\r\nthat he was both proud and diffident? That he was called upon to\r\nserve his country by good service, if such were within his power, he\r\ndid acknowledge freely; but not that he should allow himself to be\r\nstuck up as a ninepin only to be knocked down! There are politicians\r\nfor whom such occupation seems to be proper;--and who like it too. A\r\nlittle office, a little power, a little rank, a little pay, a little\r\nniche in the ephemeral history of the year will reward many men\r\nadequately for being knocked down.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he loved power, and even when thinking of all this allowed\r\nhis mind from time to time to run away into a dreamland of\r\nprosperous political labours. He thought what it would be to be\r\nan all-beneficent Prime Minister, with a loyal majority, with a\r\nwell-conditioned unanimous cabinet, with a grateful people, and an\r\nappreciative Sovereign. How well might a man spend himself night and\r\nday, even to death, in the midst of labours such as these.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after receiving the Duke\'s letter he suddenly jumped up\r\nand sat himself down at his desk. He felt it to be necessary that he\r\nshould at once write to his old friend;--and the more necessary that\r\nhe should do so at once, because he had resolved that he would do so\r\nbefore he had made up his mind on the chief subject of that letter.\r\nIt did not suit him to say either that he would or that he would not\r\ndo as his friend advised him. The reply was made in a very few words.\r\n"As to myself," he said, after expressing his regret that the Duke\r\nshould find it necessary to retire from public life--"as to myself,\r\npray understand that whatever I may do I shall never cease to be\r\ngrateful for your affectionate and high-spirited counsels."\r\n\r\nThen his mind recurred to a more immediate and, for the moment, a\r\nheavier trouble. He had as yet given no answer to that letter from\r\nMrs. Finn, which the reader will perhaps remember. It might indeed be\r\npassed over without an answer; but to him that was impossible. She\r\nhad accused him in the very strongest language of injustice, and had\r\nmade him understand that if he were unjust to her, then would he\r\nbe most ungrateful. He, looking at the matter with his own lights,\r\nhad thought that he had been right, but had resolved to submit the\r\nquestion to another person. As judge in the matter he had chosen Lady\r\nCantrip, and Lady Cantrip had given judgment against him.\r\n\r\nHe had pressed Lady Cantrip for a decided opinion, and she had told\r\nhim that she, in the same position, would have done just as Mrs. Finn\r\nhad done. He had constituted Lady Cantrip his judge, and had resolved\r\nthat her judgment should be final. He declared to himself that he\r\ndid not understand it. If a man\'s house be on fire, do you think of\r\ncertain rules of etiquette before you bid him send for the engines?\r\nIf a wild beast be loose, do you go through some ceremony before you\r\ncaution the wanderers abroad? There should not have been a moment!\r\nBut, nevertheless, it was now necessary that he should conform\r\nhimself to the opinion of Lady Cantrip, and in doing so he must\r\napologise for the bitter scorn with which he had allowed himself to\r\ntreat his wife\'s most loyal and loving friend.\r\n\r\nThe few words to the Duke had not been difficult, but this letter\r\nseemed to be an Herculean task. It was made infinitely more difficult\r\nby the fact that Lady Cantrip had not seemed to think that this\r\nmarriage was impossible. "Young people when they have set their minds\r\nupon it do so generally prevail at last!" These had been her words,\r\nand they discomforted him greatly. She had thought the marriage to\r\nbe possible. Had she not almost expressed an opinion that they ought\r\nto be allowed to marry? And if so, would it not be his duty to take\r\nhis girl away from Lady Cantrip? As to the idea that young people,\r\nbecause they have declared themselves to be in love, were to have\r\njust what they wanted,--with that he did not agree at all. Lady\r\nCantrip had told him that young people generally did prevail at last.\r\nHe knew the story of one young person, whose position in her youth\r\nhad been very much the same as that of his daughter now, and she had\r\nnot prevailed. And in her case had not the opposition which had been\r\nmade to her wishes been most fortunate? That young person had become\r\nhis wife, his Glencora, his Duchess. Had she been allowed to have her\r\nown way when she was a child, what would have been her fate? Ah what!\r\nThen he had to think of it all. Might she not have been alive now,\r\nand perhaps happier than she had ever been with him? And had he\r\nremained always unmarried, devoted simply to politics, would not the\r\ntroubles of the world have been lighter on him? But what had that\r\nto do with it? In these matters it was not the happiness of this or\r\nthat individual which should be considered. There is a propriety in\r\nthings;--and only by an adherence to that propriety on the part of\r\nindividuals can the general welfare be maintained. A King in this\r\ncountry, or the heir or the possible heir to the throne, is debarred\r\nfrom what might possibly be a happy marriage by regard to the good\r\nof his subjects. To the Duke\'s thinking the maintenance of the\r\naristocracy of the country was second only in importance to the\r\nmaintenance of the Crown. How should the aristocracy be maintained if\r\nits wealth were allowed to fall into the hands of an adventurer!\r\n\r\nSuch were the opinions with regard to his own order of one who was as\r\ntruly Liberal in his ideas as any man in England, and who had argued\r\nout these ideas to their consequences. As by the spread of education\r\nand increase of general well-being every proletaire was brought\r\nnearer to a Duke, so by such action would the Duke be brought nearer\r\nto a proletaire. Such drawing-nearer of the classes was the object\r\nto which all this man\'s political action tended. And yet it was a\r\ndreadful thing to him that his own daughter should desire to marry a\r\nman so much beneath her own rank and fortune as Frank Tregear.\r\n\r\nHe would not allow himself to believe that the young people could\r\never prevail; but nevertheless, as the idea of the thing had not\r\nalarmed Lady Cantrip as it had him, it was necessary that he should\r\nmake some apology to Mrs. Finn. Each moment of procrastination was\r\na prick to his conscience. He now therefore dragged out from the\r\nsecrecy of some close drawer Mrs. Finn\'s letter and read it through\r\nto himself once again. Yes--it was true that he had condemned her,\r\nand that he had punished her. Though he had done nothing to her, and\r\nsaid nothing, and written but very little, still he had punished her\r\nmost severely.\r\n\r\nShe had written as though the matter was almost one of life and death\r\nto her. He could understand that too. His uncle\'s conduct to this\r\nwoman, and his wife\'s, had created the intimacy which had existed.\r\nThrough their efforts she had become almost as one of the family. And\r\nnow to be dismissed, like a servant who had misbehaved herself! And\r\nthen her arguments in her own defence were all so good,--if only that\r\nwhich Lady Cantrip had laid down as law was to be held as law. He\r\nwas aware now that she had had no knowledge of the matter till his\r\ndaughter had told her of the engagement at Matching. Then it was\r\nevident also that she had sent this Tregear to him immediately on her\r\nreturn to London. And at the end of the letter she accused him of\r\nwhat she had been pleased to call his usual tenacity in believing ill\r\nof her! He had been obstinate,--too obstinate in this respect, but he\r\ndid not love her the better for having told him of it.\r\n\r\nAt last he did put his apology into words.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MRS. FINN,\r\n\r\n   I believe I had better acknowledge to you at once that I\r\n   have been wrong in my judgment as to your conduct in a\r\n   certain matter. You tell me that I owe it to you to make\r\n   this acknowledgment,--and I make it. The subject is, as\r\n   you may imagine, so painful that I will spare myself, if\r\n   possible, any further allusion to it. I believe I did you\r\n   a wrong, and therefore I write to ask your pardon.\r\n\r\n   I should perhaps apologise also for delay in my reply. I\r\n   have had much to think of in this matter, and have many\r\n   others also on my mind.\r\n\r\n   Believe me to be,\r\n   Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n   OMNIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was very short, and as being short was infinitely less troublesome\r\nat the moment than a fuller epistle; but he was angry with himself,\r\nknowing that it was too short, feeling that it was ungracious. He\r\nshould have expressed a hope that he might soon see her again,--only\r\nhe had no such wish. There had been times at which he had liked her,\r\nbut he knew that he did not like her now. And yet he was bound to be\r\nher friend! If he could only do some great thing for her, and thus\r\nsatisfy his feeling of indebtedness towards her! But all the favours\r\nhad been from her to him and his.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nFrank Tregear Wants a Friend\r\n\r\n\r\nSix or seven weeks had passed since Tregear had made his\r\ncommunication to the Duke, and during that time he had heard not a\r\nword about the girl he loved. He knew, indeed, that she was at The\r\nHorns, and probably had reason to suppose that she was being guarded\r\nthere, as it were, out of his reach. This did not surprise him; nor\r\ndid he regard it as a hardship. It was to be expected that she should\r\nbe kept out of his sight. But this was a state of things to which,\r\nas he thought, there should not be more than a moderate amount of\r\nsubmission. Six weeks was not a very long period, but it was perhaps\r\nlong enough for evincing that respect which he owed to the young\r\nlady\'s father. Something must be done some day. How could he expect\r\nher to be true to him unless he took some means of showing himself to\r\nbe true to her?\r\n\r\nIn these days he did not live very much with her brother. He not only\r\ndisliked, but distrusted Major Tifto, and had so expressed himself as\r\nto give rise to angry words. Silverbridge had said that he knew how\r\nto take care of himself. Tregear had replied that he had his doubts\r\non that matter. Then the Member of Parliament had declared that at\r\nany rate he did not intend to be taken care of by Frank Tregear! In\r\nsuch a state of things it was not possible that there should be any\r\nclose confidence as to Lady Mary. Nor does it often come to pass that\r\nthe brother is the confidant of the sister\'s lover. Brothers hardly\r\nlike their sisters to have lovers, though they are often well\r\nsatisfied that their sisters should find husbands. Tregear\'s want of\r\nrank and wealth added something to this feeling in the mind of this\r\nbrother; so that Silverbridge, though he felt himself to be deterred\r\nby friendship from any open opposition, still was almost inimical.\r\n"It won\'t do, you know," he had said to his brother Gerald, shaking\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nTregear, however, was determined to be active in the matter, to make\r\nsome effort, to speak to somebody. But how to make an effort,--and\r\nto whom should he speak? Thinking of all this he remembered that Mrs.\r\nFinn had sent for him and had told him to go with his love story\r\nto the Duke. She had been almost severe with him;--but after the\r\ninterview was over, he had felt that she had acted well and wisely.\r\nHe therefore determined that he would go to Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\nShe had as yet received no answer from the Duke, though nearly a\r\nfortnight had elapsed since she had written her letter. During that\r\ntime she had become very angry. She felt that he was not treating her\r\nas a gentleman should treat a lady, and certainly not as the husband\r\nof her late friend should have treated the friend of his late\r\nwife. She had a proud consciousness of having behaved well to the\r\nPallisers, and now this head of the Pallisers was rewarding her by\r\nevil treatment. She had been generous; he was ungenerous. She had\r\nbeen honest; he was deficient even in that honesty for which she\r\nhad given him credit. And she had been unable to obtain any of that\r\nconsolation which could have come to her from talking of her wrongs.\r\nShe could not complain to her husband, because there were reasons\r\nthat made it essential that her husband should not quarrel with\r\nthe Duke. She was hot with indignation at the very moment in which\r\nTregear was announced.\r\n\r\nHe began by apologising for his intrusion, and she of course assured\r\nhim that he was welcome. "After the liberty which I took with you,\r\nMr. Tregear, I am only too well pleased that you should come to see\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid," he said, "that I was a little rough."\r\n\r\n"A little warm;--but that was to be expected. A gentleman never likes\r\nto be interfered with on such a matter."\r\n\r\n"The position was and is difficult, Mrs. Finn."\r\n\r\n"And I am bound to acknowledge the very ready way in which you did\r\nwhat I asked you to do."\r\n\r\n"And now, Mrs. Finn, what is to come next?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!"\r\n\r\n"Something must be done! You know of course that the Duke did not\r\nreceive me with any great favour."\r\n\r\n"I did not suppose he would."\r\n\r\n"Nor did I. Of course he would object to such a marriage. But a man\r\nin these days cannot dictate to his daughter what husband she should\r\nmarry."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he can dictate to her what husband she shall not marry."\r\n\r\n"Hardly that. He may put impediments in the way; and the Duke will\r\ndo so. But if I am happy enough to have won the affections of his\r\ndaughter,--so as to make it essential to her happiness that she\r\nshould become my wife,--he will give way."\r\n\r\n"What am I to say, Mr. Tregear?"\r\n\r\n"Just what you think."\r\n\r\n"Why should I be made to say what I think on so delicate a matter? Or\r\nof what use would be my thoughts? Remember how far I am removed from\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"You are his friend."\r\n\r\n"Not at all! No one less so!" As she said this she could not hinder\r\nthe colour from coming into her face. "I was her friend,--Lady\r\nGlencora\'s; but with the death of my friend there was an end of all\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"You were staying with him,--at his request. You told me so\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"I shall never stay with him again. But all that, Mr. Tregear, is\r\nof no matter. I do not mean to say a word against him;--not a word.\r\nBut if you wish to interest any one as being the Duke\'s friend, then\r\nI can assure you I am the last person in London to whom you should\r\ncome. I know no one to whom the Duke is likely to entertain feelings\r\nso little kind as towards me." This she said in a peculiarly solemn\r\nway that startled Tregear. But before he could answer her a servant\r\nentered the room with a letter. She recognised at once the Duke\'s\r\nhandwriting. Here was the answer for which she had been so long\r\nwaiting in silent expectation! She could not keep it unread till he\r\nwas gone. "Will you allow me a moment?" she whispered, and then she\r\nopened the envelope. As she read the few words her eyes became laden\r\nwith tears. They quite sufficed to relieve the injured pride which\r\nhad sat so heavy at her heart. "I believe I did you a wrong, and\r\ntherefore I ask your pardon!" It was so like what she had believed\r\nthe man to be! She could not be longer angry with him. And yet the\r\nvery last words she had spoken were words complaining of his conduct.\r\n"This is from the Duke," she said, putting the letter back into its\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed."\r\n\r\n"It is odd that it should have come while you were here."\r\n\r\n"Is it,--is it,--about Lady Mary?"\r\n\r\n"No;--at least,--not directly. I perhaps spoke more harshly about him\r\nthan I should have done. The truth is I had expected a line from him,\r\nand it had not come. Now it is here; but I do not suppose I shall\r\never see much of him. My intimacy was with her. But I would not wish\r\nyou to remember what I said just now, if--if--"\r\n\r\n"If what, Mrs. Finn? You mean, perhaps, if I should ever be allowed\r\nto call myself his son-in-law. It may seem to you to be arrogant, but\r\nit is an honour which I expect to win."\r\n\r\n"Faint heart,--you know, Mr. Tregear."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. One has to tell oneself that very often. You will help me?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," she said, as though she were much startled. "How can\r\nI help you?"\r\n\r\n"By telling me what I should do. I suppose if I were to go down to\r\nRichmond I should not be admitted."\r\n\r\n"If you ask me, I think not;--not to see Lady Mary. Lady Cantrip\r\nwould perhaps see you."\r\n\r\n"She is acting the part of--duenna."\r\n\r\n"As I should do also, if Lady Mary were staying with me. You don\'t\r\nsuppose that if she were here I would let her see you in my house\r\nwithout her father\'s leave?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose not."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not; and therefore I conceive that Lady Cantrip will not\r\ndo so either."\r\n\r\n"I wish she were here."\r\n\r\n"It would be of no use. I should be a dragon in guarding her."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would let me feel that you were like a sister to me in\r\nthis matter."\r\n\r\n"But I am not your sister, nor yet your aunt, nor yet your\r\ngrandmother. What I mean is that I cannot be on your side."\r\n\r\n"Can you not?"\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Tregear. Think how long I have known these other people."\r\n\r\n"But just now you said that he was your enemy."\r\n\r\n"I did say so; but as I have unsaid it since, you as a gentleman will\r\nnot remember my words. At any rate I cannot help you in this."\r\n\r\n"I shall write to her."\r\n\r\n"It can be nothing to me. If you write she will show your letter\r\neither to her father or to Lady Cantrip."\r\n\r\n"But she will read it first."\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell how that may be. In fact I am the very last person in\r\nthe world to whom you should come for assistance in this matter. If\r\nI gave any assistance to anybody I should be bound to give it to the\r\nDuke."\r\n\r\n"I cannot understand that, Mrs. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Nor can I explain it, but it would be so. I shall always be very\r\nglad to see you, and I do feel that we ought to be friends,--because\r\nI took such a liberty with you. But in this matter I cannot help\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nWhen she said this he had to take his leave. It was impossible that\r\nhe should further press his case upon her, though he would have been\r\nvery glad to extract from her some kindly word. It is such a help in\r\na difficulty to have somebody who will express even a hope that the\r\ndifficulty is perhaps not invincible! He had no one to comfort him in\r\nthis matter. There was one dear friend,--as a friend dearer than any\r\nother,--to whom he might go, and who would after some fashion bid him\r\nprosper. Mabel would encourage him. She had said that she would do\r\nso. But in making that promise she had told him that Romeo would not\r\nhave spoken of his love for Juliet to Rosaline, whom he had loved\r\nbefore he saw Juliet. No doubt she had gone on to tell him that he\r\nmight come to her and talk freely of his love for Lady Mary,--but\r\nafter what had been said before, he felt that he could not do so\r\nwithout leaving a sting behind. When a man\'s love goes well with\r\nhim,--so well as to be in some degree oppressive to him even by\r\nits prosperity,--when the young lady has jumped into his arms and\r\nthe father and mother have been quite willing, then he wants no\r\nconfidant. He does not care to speak very much of the matter which\r\namong his friends is apt to become a subject for raillery. When\r\nyou call a man Benedick he does not come to you with ecstatic\r\ndescriptions of the beauty and the wit of his Beatrice. But no one\r\nwas likely to call him Benedick in reference to Lady Mary.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his manner, in spite of his apparent self-sufficiency,\r\nthis man was very soft within. Less than two years back he had been\r\nwilling to sacrifice all the world for his cousin Mabel, and his\r\ncousin Mabel had told him that he was wrong. "It does not pay to\r\nsacrifice the world for love." So cousin Mabel had said, and had\r\nadded something as to its being necessary that she should marry a\r\nrich man, and expedient that he should marry a rich woman. He had\r\nthought much about it, and had declared to himself that on no account\r\nwould he marry a woman for her money. Then he had encountered Lady\r\nMary Palliser. There had been no doubt, no resolution after that,\r\nno thinking about it;--but downright love. There was nothing left\r\nof real regret for his cousin in his bosom. She had been right.\r\nThat love had been impossible. But this would be possible,--ah, so\r\ndeliciously possible,--if only her father and mother would assist!\r\nThe mother, imprudent in this as in all things, had assented. The\r\nreader knows the rest.\r\n\r\nIt was in every way possible. "She will have money enough," the\r\nDuchess had said, "if only her father can be brought to give it you."\r\nSo Tregear had set his heart upon it, and had said to himself that\r\nthe thing was to be done. Then his friend the Duchess had died, and\r\nthe real difficulties had commenced. From that day he had not seen\r\nhis love, or heard from her. How was he to know whether she would be\r\ntrue to him? And where was he to seek for that sympathy which he felt\r\nto be so necessary to him? A wild idea had come into his head that\r\nMrs. Finn would be his friend;--but she had repudiated him.\r\n\r\nHe went straight home and at once wrote to the girl. The letter was\r\na simple love-letter, and as such need not be given here. In what\r\nsweetest language he could find he assured her that even though he\r\nshould never be allowed to see her or to hear from her, that still he\r\nshould cling to her. And then he added this passage: "If your love\r\nfor me be what I think it to be, no one can have a right to keep us\r\napart. Pray be sure that I shall not change. If you change let me\r\nknow it;--but I shall as soon expect the heavens to fall."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n"She Must Be Made to Obey"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary Palliser down at The Horns had as much liberty allowed\r\nto her as is usually given to young ladies in these very free days.\r\nThere was indeed no restriction placed upon her at all. Had Tregear\r\ngone down to Richmond and asked for the young lady, and had Lady\r\nCantrip at the time been out and the young lady at home, it would\r\nhave depended altogether upon the young lady whether she would have\r\nseen her lover or not. Nevertheless Lady Cantrip kept her eyes open,\r\nand when the letter came from Tregear she was aware that the letter\r\nhad come. But the letter found its way into Lady Mary\'s hands and\r\nwas read in the seclusion of her own bed-room. "I wonder whether you\r\nwould mind reading that," she said very shortly afterwards to Lady\r\nCantrip. "What answer ought I to make?"\r\n\r\n"Do you think any answer ought to be made, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; I must answer him."\r\n\r\n"Would your papa wish it?"\r\n\r\n"I told papa that I would not promise not to write to him. I think\r\nI told him that he should see any letters that there were. But if I\r\nshow them to you, I suppose that will do as well."\r\n\r\n"You had better keep your word to him absolutely."\r\n\r\n"I am not afraid of doing so, if you mean that. I cannot bear to give\r\nhim pain, but this is a matter in which I mean to have my own way."\r\n\r\n"Mean to have your own way!" said Lady Cantrip, much surprised by the\r\ndetermined tone of the young lady.\r\n\r\n"Certainly I do. I want you to understand so much! I suppose papa can\r\nkeep us from marrying for ever and ever if he pleases, but he never\r\nwill make me say that I will give up Mr. Tregear. And if he does not\r\nyield I shall think him cruel. Why should he wish to make me unhappy\r\nall my life?"\r\n\r\n"He certainly does not wish that, my dear."\r\n\r\n"But he will do it."\r\n\r\n"I cannot go against your father, Mary."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose not. I shall write to Mr. Tregear, and then I will\r\nshow you what I have written. Papa shall see it too if he pleases. I\r\nwill do nothing secret, but I will never give up Mr. Tregear."\r\n\r\nLord Cantrip came down to Richmond that evening, and his wife told\r\nhim that in her opinion it would be best that the Duke should allow\r\nthe young people to marry, and should give them money enough to live\r\nupon. "Is not that a strong order?" asked the Earl. The Countess\r\nacknowledged that it was a "strong order," but suggested that for the\r\nhappiness of them all it might as well be done at first as at last.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Lady Mary showed her a copy of the reply which she\r\nhad already sent to her lover.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR FRANK,\r\n\r\n   You may be quite sure that I shall never give you up. I\r\n   will not write more at present because papa does not wish\r\n   me to do so. I shall show papa your letter and my answer.\r\n\r\n   Your own most affectionate\r\n\r\n   MARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Has it gone?" asked the Countess.\r\n\r\n"I put it myself into the pillar letter-box." Then Lady Cantrip felt\r\nthat she had to deal with a very self-willed young lady indeed.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Lady Cantrip asked Lady Mary whether she might be\r\nallowed to take the two letters up to town with the express purpose\r\nof showing them to the Duke. "Oh yes," said Mary, "I think it would\r\nbe so much the best. Give papa my kindest love, and tell him from me\r\nthat if he wants to make his poor little girl happy he will forgive\r\nher and be kind to her in all this." Then the Countess made some\r\nattempt to argue the matter. There were proprieties! High rank might\r\nbe a blessing or might be the reverse--as people thought of it;--but\r\nall men acknowledged that much was due to it. "Noblesse oblige."\r\nIt was often the case in life that women were called upon by\r\ncircumstances to sacrifice their inclinations! What right had a\r\ngentleman to talk of marriage who had no means? These things she said\r\nand very many more, but it was to no purpose. The young lady asserted\r\nthat as the gentleman was a gentleman there need be no question as\r\nto rank, and that in regard to money there need be no difficulty if\r\none of them had sufficient. "But you have none but what your father\r\nmay give you," said Lady Cantrip. "Papa can give it us without any\r\ntrouble," said Lady Mary. This child had a clear idea of what she\r\nthought to be her own rights. Being the child of rich parents she\r\nhad the right to money. Being a woman she had a right to a husband.\r\nHaving been born free she had a right to choose one for herself.\r\nHaving had a man\'s love given to her she had a right to keep it.\r\n"One doesn\'t know which she is most like, her father or her mother,"\r\nLady Cantrip said afterwards to her husband. "She has his cool\r\ndetermination, and her hot-headed obstinacy."\r\n\r\nShe did show the letters to the Duke, and in answer to a word or two\r\nfrom him explained that she could not take upon herself to debar her\r\nguest from the use of the post. "But she will write nothing without\r\nletting you know it."\r\n\r\n"She ought to write nothing at all."\r\n\r\n"What she feels is much worse than what she writes."\r\n\r\n"If there were no intercourse she would forget him."\r\n\r\n"Ah; I don\'t know," said the Countess sorrowfully; "I thought so\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"All children are determined as long as they are allowed to have\r\ntheir own way."\r\n\r\n"I mean to say that it is the nature of her character to be\r\nobstinate. Most girls are prone to yield. They have not character\r\nenough to stand against opposition. I am not speaking now only of\r\naffairs like this. It would be the same with her in any thing. Have\r\nyou not always found it so?"\r\n\r\nThen he had to acknowledge to himself that he had never found out\r\nanything in reference to his daughter\'s character. She had been\r\nproperly educated;--at least he hoped so. He had seen her grow up,\r\npretty, sweet, affectionate, always obedient to him;--the most\r\ncharming plaything in the world on the few occasions in which he had\r\nallowed himself to play. But as to her actual disposition, he had\r\nnever taken any trouble to inform himself. She had been left to her\r\nmother,--as other girls are left. And his sons had been left to their\r\ntutors. And now he had no control over any of them. "She must be made\r\nto obey like others," he said at last, speaking through his teeth.\r\n\r\nThere was something in this which almost frightened Lady Cantrip. She\r\ncould not bear to hear him say that the girl must be made to yield,\r\nwith that spirit of despotic power under which women were restrained\r\nin years now passed. If she could have spoken her own mind it would\r\nhave been to this effect: "Let us do what we can to lead her away\r\nfrom this desire of hers; and in order that we may do so, let us tell\r\nher that her marriage with Mr. Tregear is out of the question. But if\r\nwe do not succeed,--say in the course of the next twelve months,--let\r\nus give way. Let us make it a matter of joy that the young man\r\nhimself is so acceptable and well-behaved." That was her idea, and\r\nwith that she would have indoctrined the Duke had she been able. But\r\nhis was different. "She must be made to obey," he said. And, as he\r\nsaid it, he seemed to be indifferent as to the sorrow which such\r\nenforced obedience might bring upon his child. In answer to this she\r\ncould only shake her head. "What do you mean?" he asked. "Do you\r\nthink we ought to yield?"\r\n\r\n"Not at once, certainly."\r\n\r\n"But at last?"\r\n\r\n"What can you do, Duke? If she be as firm as you, can you bear to see\r\nher pine away in her misery?"\r\n\r\n"Girls do not do like that," he said.\r\n\r\n"Girls, like men, are very different. They generally will yield to\r\nexternal influences. English girls, though they become the most\r\nloving wives in the world, do not generally become so riven by an\r\nattachment as to become deep sufferers when it is disallowed. But\r\nhere, I fear, we have to deal with one who will suffer after this\r\nfashion."\r\n\r\n"Why should she not be like others?"\r\n\r\n"It may be so. We will try. But you see what she says in her letter\r\nto him. She writes as though your authority were to be nothing in\r\nthat matter of giving up. In all that she says to me there is the\r\nsame spirit. If she is firm, Duke, you must yield."\r\n\r\n"Never! She shall never marry him with my sanction."\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to be said, and Lady Cantrip went her way. But\r\nthe Duke, though he could say nothing more, continued to think of it\r\nhour after hour. He went down to the House of Lords to listen to a\r\ndebate in which it was intended to cover the ministers with heavy\r\ndisgrace. But the Duke could not listen even to his own friends.\r\nHe could listen to nothing as he thought of the condition of his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nHe had been asked whether he could bear to see his girl suffer, as\r\nthough he were indifferent to the sufferings of his child. Did he\r\nnot know of himself that there was no father who would do more for\r\nthe welfare of his daughter? Was he not sure of the tenderness of\r\nhis own heart? In all that he was doing was he governed by anything\r\nbut a sense of duty? Was it personal pride or love of personal\r\naggrandisement? He thought that he could assure himself that he was\r\nopen to no such charge. Would he not die for her,--or for them,--if\r\nhe could so serve them? Surely this woman had accused him most\r\nwrongfully when she had intimated that he could see his girl suffer\r\nwithout caring for it. In his indignation he determined--for\r\nawhile--that he would remove her from the custody of Lady Cantrip.\r\nBut then, where should he place her? He was aware that his own\r\nhouse would be like a grave to a girl just fit to come out into the\r\nworld. In this coming autumn she must go somewhere,--with someone.\r\nHe himself, in his present frame of mind, would be but a sorry\r\ntravelling companion.\r\n\r\nLady Cantrip had said that the best hope of escape would lie in the\r\nprospect of another lover. The prescription was disagreeable, but it\r\nhad availed in the case of his own wife. Before he had ever seen her\r\nas Lady Glencora McCloskie she had been desirous of giving herself\r\nand all her wealth to one Burgo Fitzgerald, who had been altogether\r\nunworthy. The Duke could remember well how a certain old Lady\r\nMidlothian had first hinted to him that Lady Glencora\'s property was\r\nvery large, and had then added that the young lady herself was very\r\nbeautiful. And he could remember how his uncle, the late Duke, who\r\nhad seldom taken much trouble in merely human affairs, had said a\r\nword or two--"I have heard a whisper about you and Lady Glencora\r\nMcCloskie; nothing could be better." The result had been undoubtedly\r\ngood. His Cora and all her money had been saved from a worthless\r\nspendthrift. He had found a wife who he now thought had made him\r\nhappy. And she had found at any rate a respectable husband. The idea\r\nwhen picked to pieces is not a nice idea. "Let us look out for a\r\nhusband for this girl, so that we may get her married,--out of the\r\nway of her lover." It is not nice. But it had succeeded in one case,\r\nand why should it not succeed in another?\r\n\r\nBut how was it to be done? Who should do it? Whom should he select to\r\nplay the part which he had undertaken in that other arrangement? No\r\nworse person could be found than himself for managing such an affair.\r\nWhen the idea had first been raised he had thought that Lady Cantrip\r\nwould do it all; but now he was angry with Lady Cantrip.\r\n\r\nHow was it to be done? How should it be commenced? How had it been\r\ncommenced in his own case? He did not in the least know how he had\r\nbeen chosen. Was it possible that his uncle, who was the proudest man\r\nin England, should have condescended to make a bargain with an old\r\ndowager whom everybody had despised? And in what way had he been\r\nselected? No doubt he had been known to be the heir-apparent to a\r\ndukedom and to ducal revenues. In his case old Lady Midlothian had\r\nbegun the matter with him. It occurred to him that in royal marriages\r\nsuch beginnings are quite common.\r\n\r\nBut who should be the happy man? Then he began to count up the\r\nrequisite attributes. He must be of high rank, and an eldest son,\r\nand the possessor of, or the heir to, a good estate. He did despise\r\nhimself when he found that he put these things first,--as a matter\r\nof course. Nevertheless he did put them first. He was ejecting this\r\nother man because he possessed none of these attributes. He hurried\r\nhimself on to add that the man must be of good character, and such as\r\na young girl might learn to love. But yet he was aware that he added\r\nthese things for his conscience\'s sake. Tregear\'s character was good,\r\nand certainly the girl loved him. But was it not clear to all who\r\nknew anything of such matters that Mr. Francis Tregear should not\r\nhave dared even to think of marrying the daughter of the Duke of\r\nOmnium?\r\n\r\nWho should be the happy man? There were so many who evidently were\r\nunfit. Young Lord Percival was heir to a ruined estate and a beggared\r\npeerage. Lord Glasslough was odious to all men. There were three or\r\nfour others of whom he thought that he knew some fatal objection. But\r\nwhen he remembered Lord Popplecourt there seemed to be no objection\r\nwhich need be fatal.\r\n\r\nLord Popplecourt was a young peer whose father had died two years\r\nsince and whose estates were large and unembarrassed. The late lord,\r\nwho had been a Whig of the old fashion, had been the Duke\'s friend.\r\nThey had been at Oxford and in the House of Commons together, and\r\nLord Popplecourt had always been true to his party. As to the son,\r\nthe Duke remembered to have heard lately that he was not given to\r\nwaste his money. He drove a coach about London a good deal, but had\r\nas yet not done anything very foolish. He had taken his degree at\r\nOxford, thereby showing himself to be better than Silverbridge. He\r\nhad also taken his seat in the House of Lords and had once opened\r\nhis mouth. He had not indeed appeared often again; but at Lord\r\nPopplecourt\'s age much legislation is not to be expected from a young\r\npeer. Then he thought of the man\'s appearance. Popplecourt was not\r\nspecially attractive, whereas Tregear was a very handsome man. But\r\nso also had been Burgo Fitzgerald,--almost abnormally beautiful,\r\nwhile he, Plantagenet Palliser, as he was then, had been quite as\r\ninsignificant in appearance as Lord Popplecourt.\r\n\r\nLord Popplecourt might possibly do. But then how should the matter be\r\nspoken of to the young man? After all, would it not be best that he\r\nshould trust Lady Cantrip?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nA Family Breakfast-Table\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge had paid all his Derby losses without any\r\ndifficulty. They had not been very heavy for a man in his position,\r\nand the money had come without remonstrance. When asking for it he\r\nwas half ashamed of himself, but could still find consolation by\r\nremembering how much worse had befallen many young men whom he knew.\r\nHe had never "plunged." In fact he had made the most prudent book in\r\nthe world; and had so managed affairs that even now the horse which\r\nhad been beaten was worth more than all he had lost and paid. "This\r\nis getting serious," he had said to his partner when, on making out\r\na rough account, he had brought the Major in a debtor to him of\r\nmore than a thousand pounds. The Major had remarked that as he was\r\nhalf-owner of the horses his partner had good security for the money.\r\nThen something of an unwritten arrangement was made. The "Prime\r\nMinister" was now one of the favourites for the Leger. If the horse\r\nwon that race there would be money enough for everything. If that\r\nrace were lost, then there should be a settlement by the transfer of\r\nthe stud to the younger partner. "He\'s safe to pull it off," said the\r\nMajor.\r\n\r\nAt this time both his sons were living with the Duke in London. It\r\nhad been found impracticable to send Lord Gerald back to Cambridge.\r\nThe doors of Trinity were closed against him. But some interest had\r\nbeen made in his favour, and he was to be transferred to Oxford. All\r\nthe truth had been told, and there had been a feeling that the lad\r\nshould be allowed another chance. He could not however go to his new\r\nAlma Mater till after the long vacation. In the meantime he was to\r\nbe taken by a tutor down to a cottage on Dartmoor and there be made\r\nto read,--with such amusement in the meantime as might be got from\r\nfishing, and playing cricket with the West Devon county club. "It\r\nisn\'t a very bright look-out for the summer," his brother had said to\r\nhim, "but it\'s better than breaking out on the loose altogether. You\r\nbe a credit to the family and all that sort of thing. Then I\'ll give\r\nup the borough to you. But mind you stick to the Liberals. I\'ve made\r\nan ass of myself." However in these early days of June Lord Gerald\r\nhad not yet got his tutor.\r\n\r\nThough the father and the two young men were living together they did\r\nnot see very much of each other. The Duke breakfasted at nine and the\r\nrepast was a very simple one. When they failed to appear, he did not\r\nscold,--but would simply be disappointed. At dinner they never met.\r\nIt was supposed that Lord Gerald passed his mornings in reading, and\r\nsome little attempts were made in that direction. It is to be feared\r\nthey did not come to much. Silverbridge was very kind to Gerald,\r\nfeeling an increased tenderness for him on account of that Cambridge\r\nmishap. Now they were much together, and occasionally, by a strong\r\neffort, would grace their father\'s breakfast-table with their\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nIt was not often that he either reproached them or preached to them.\r\nThough he could not live with them on almost equal terms, as some\r\nfathers can live with their sons, though he could not laugh at their\r\nfun or make them laugh at his wit, he knew that it would have been\r\nbetter both for him and them if he had possessed this capacity.\r\nThough the life which they lived was distasteful to him,--though\r\nracehorses were an abomination to him, and the driving of coaches a\r\nfolly, and club-life a manifest waste of time, still he recognised\r\nthese things as being, if not necessary, yet unavoidable evils. To\r\nGerald he would talk about Oxford, avoiding all allusions to past\r\nCambridge misfortunes; but in the presence of Silverbridge, whose\r\nOxford career had been so peculiarly unfortunate, he would make no\r\nallusion to either of the universities. To his eldest son he would\r\ntalk of Parliament, which of all subjects would have been the most\r\ncongenial had they agreed in politics. As it was he could speak more\r\nfreely to him on that than any other matter.\r\n\r\nOne Thursday night as the two brothers went to bed on returning from\r\nthe Beargarden, at a not very late hour, they agreed that they would\r\n"give the governor a turn" the next morning,--by which they meant\r\nthat they would drag themselves out of bed in time to breakfast with\r\nhim. "The worst of it is that he never will let them get anything to\r\neat," said Gerald. But Silverbridge explained that he had taken that\r\nmatter into his own hands, and had specially ordered broiled salmon\r\nand stewed kidneys. "He won\'t like it, you know," said Gerald. "I\'m\r\nsure he thinks it wicked to eat anything but toasted bacon before\r\nlunch."\r\n\r\nAt a very little after nine Silverbridge was in the breakfast-room,\r\nand there found his father. "I suppose Gerald is not up yet," said\r\nthe Duke almost crossly.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes he is, sir. He\'ll be here directly."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen him this morning?"\r\n\r\n"No; I haven\'t seen him. But I know he\'ll be here. He said he would,\r\nlast night."\r\n\r\n"You speak of it as if it were an undertaking."\r\n\r\n"No, not that, sir. But we are not always quite up to time."\r\n\r\n"No; indeed you are not. Perhaps you sit late at the House."\r\n\r\n"Sometimes I do," said the young member, with a feeling almost akin\r\nto shame as he remembered all the hours spent at the Beargarden. "I\r\nhave had Gerald there in the Gallery sometimes. It is just as well he\r\nshould know what is being done."\r\n\r\n"Quite as well."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder if he gets a seat some day."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how that may be."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t change as I have done. He\'ll stick to your side. Indeed I\r\nthink he\'d do better in the House than I shall. He has more gift of\r\nthe gab."\r\n\r\n"That is not the first thing requisite."\r\n\r\n"I know all that, sir. I\'ve read your letter more than once, and I\r\nshowed it to him."\r\n\r\nThere was something sweet and pleasant in the young man\'s manner by\r\nwhich the father could hardly not be captivated. They had now sat\r\ndown, and the servant had brought in the unusual accessories for a\r\nmorning feast. "What is all that?" asked the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Gerald and I are so awfully hungry of a morning," said the son,\r\napologising.\r\n\r\n"Well;--it\'s a very good thing to be hungry;--that is if you can get\r\nplenty to eat. Salmon, is it? I don\'t think I\'ll have any myself.\r\nKidneys! Not for me. I think I\'ll take a bit of fried bacon. I also\r\nam hungry, but not awfully hungry."\r\n\r\n"You never seem to me to eat anything, sir."\r\n\r\n"Eating is an occupation from which I think a man takes the more\r\npleasure the less he considers it. A rural labourer who sits on the\r\nditch-side with his bread and cheese and an onion has more enjoyment\r\nout of it than any Lucullus."\r\n\r\n"But he likes a good deal of it."\r\n\r\n"I do not think he ever over-eats himself,--which Lucullus does. I\r\nhave envied a ploughman his power,--his dura ilia,--but never an\r\nepicure the appreciative skill of his palate. If Gerald does not make\r\nhaste he will have to exercise neither the one nor the other upon\r\nthat fish."\r\n\r\n"I will leave a bit for him, sir,--and here he is. You are twenty\r\nminutes late, Gerald. My father says that bread and cheese and onions\r\nwould be better for you than salmon and stewed kidneys."\r\n\r\n"No, Silverbridge;--I said no such thing; but that if he were a\r\nhedger and ditcher the bread and cheese and onions would be as good."\r\n\r\n"I should not mind trying them at all," said Gerald. "Only one never\r\ndoes have such things for breakfast. Last winter a lot of us skated\r\nto Ely, and we ate two or three loaves of bread and a whole cheese at\r\na pot-house! And as for beer, we drank the public dry."\r\n\r\n"It was because for the time you had been a hedger and ditcher."\r\n\r\n"Proby was a ditcher I know, when he went right through into one of\r\nthe dykes. Just push on that dish, Silverbridge. It\'s no good you\r\nhaving the trouble of helping me half-a-dozen times. I don\'t think\r\nthings are a bit the nicer because they cost a lot of money. I\r\nsuppose that is what you mean, sir."\r\n\r\n"Something of that kind, Gerald. Not to have money for your\r\nwants;--that must be troublesome."\r\n\r\n"Very bad indeed," said Silverbridge, shaking his head wisely, as a\r\nMember of Parliament might do who felt that something should be done\r\nto put down such a lamentable state of things.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t complain," said Gerald. "No fellow ever had less right to\r\ncomplain. But I never felt that I had quite enough. Of course it was\r\nmy own fault."\r\n\r\n"I should say so, my boy. But then there are a great many like you.\r\nLet their means be what they may, they never have quite enough. To be\r\nin any difficulty with regard to money,--to owe what you cannot pay,\r\nor even to have to abstain from things which you have told yourself\r\nare necessary to yourself or to those who depend on you,--creates a\r\nfeeling of meanness."\r\n\r\n"That is what I have always felt," said Silverbridge. "I cannot bear\r\nto think that I should like to have a thing and that I cannot afford\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You do not quite understand me, I fear. The only case in which you\r\ncan be justified in desiring that which you cannot afford is when the\r\nthing is necessary;--as bread may be, or clothes."\r\n\r\n"As when a fellow wants a lot of new breeches before he has paid his\r\ntailor\'s bill."\r\n\r\n"As when a poor man," said the Duke impressively, "may long to give\r\nhis wife a new gown, or his children boots to keep their feet from\r\nthe mud and snow." Then he paused a moment, but the serious tone of\r\nhis voice and the energy of his words had sent Gerald headlong among\r\nhis kidneys. "I say that in such cases money must be regarded as a\r\nblessing."\r\n\r\n"A ten-pound note will do so much," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"But beyond that it ought to have no power of conferring happiness,\r\nand certainly cannot drive away sorrow. Not though you build palaces\r\nout into the deep, can that help you. You read your Horace, I hope.\r\n\'Scandunt eodum quo dominus minae.\'"\r\n\r\n"I recollect that," said Gerald. "Black care sits behind the\r\nhorseman."\r\n\r\n"Even though he have a groom riding after him beautiful with\r\nexquisite boots. As far as I have been able to look out into the\r\nworld--"\r\n\r\n"I suppose you know it as well as anybody," said Silverbridge,--who\r\nwas simply desirous of making himself pleasant to the "dear old\r\ngovernor."\r\n\r\n"As far as my experience goes, the happiest man is he who, being\r\nabove the troubles which money brings, has his hands the fullest of\r\nwork. If I were to name the class of men whose lives are spent with\r\nthe most thorough enjoyment, I think I should name that of barristers\r\nwho are in large practice and also in Parliament."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it a great grind, sir?" asked Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"A very great grind, as you call it. And there may be the grind and\r\nnot the success. But--" He had now got up from his seat at the table\r\nand was standing with his back against the chimney-piece, and as he\r\nwent on with his lecture,--as the word "But" came from his lips--he\r\nstruck the fingers of one hand lightly on the palm of the other as\r\nhe had been known to do at some happy flight of oratory in the House\r\nof Commons. "But it is the grind that makes the happiness. To feel\r\nthat your hours are filled to overflowing, that you can barely steal\r\nminutes enough for sleep, that the welfare of many is entrusted\r\nto you, that the world looks on and approves, that some good is\r\nalways being done to others,--above all things some good to your\r\ncountry;--that is happiness. For myself I can conceive none other."\r\n\r\n"Books," suggested Gerald, as he put the last morsel of the last\r\nkidney into his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Yes, books! Cicero and Ovid have told us that to literature only\r\ncould they look for consolation in their banishment. But then they\r\nspeak of a remedy for sorrow, not of a source of joy. No young man\r\nshould dare to neglect literature. At some period of his life he will\r\nsurely need consolation. And he may be certain that should he live to\r\nbe an old man, there will be none other,--except religion. But for\r\nthat feeling of self-contentment, which creates happiness--hard work,\r\nand hard work alone, can give it to you."\r\n\r\n"Books are hard work themselves sometimes," said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"As for money," continued the father, not caring to notice this\r\ninterruption, "if it be regarded in any other light than as a shield\r\nagainst want, as a rampart under the protection of which you may\r\ncarry on your battle, it will fail you. I was born a rich man."\r\n\r\n"Few people have cared so little about it as you," said the elder\r\nson.\r\n\r\n"And you, both of you, have been born to be rich." This assertion did\r\nnot take the elder brother by surprise. It was a matter of course.\r\nBut Lord Gerald, who had never as yet heard anything as to his future\r\ndestiny from his father, was interested by the statement. "When I\r\nthink of all this,--of what constitutes happiness,--I am almost\r\ntempted to grieve that it should be so."\r\n\r\n"If a large fortune were really a bad thing," said Gerald, "a man\r\ncould I suppose get rid of it."\r\n\r\n"No;--it is a thing of which a man cannot get rid,--unless by\r\nshameful means. It is a burden which he must carry to the end."\r\n\r\n"Does anybody wish to get rid of it, as Sindbad did of the Old\r\nMan?" asked Gerald pertinaciously. "At any rate I have enjoyed the\r\nkidneys."\r\n\r\n"You assured us just now that the bread and cheese at Ely were just\r\nas good." The Duke as he said this looked as though he knew that he\r\nhad taken all the wind out of his adversary\'s sails. "Though you add\r\ncarriage to carriage, you will not be carried more comfortably."\r\n\r\n"A second horse out hunting is a comfort," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Then at any rate don\'t desire a third for show. But such comforts\r\nwill cease to be joys when they become matters of course. That a boy\r\nwho does not see a pudding once a year should enjoy a pudding when it\r\ncomes I can understand; but the daily pudding, or the pudding twice\r\na day, is soon no more than simple daily bread,--which will or will\r\nnot be sweet as it shall or shall not have been earned." Then he\r\nwent slowly to the door, but, as he stood with the handle of it in\r\nhis hand, he turned round and spoke another word. "When, hereafter,\r\nGerald, you may chance to think of that bread and cheese at Ely,\r\nalways remember that you had skated from Cambridge."\r\n\r\nThe two brothers then took themselves to some remote part of the\r\nhouse where arrangements had been made for smoking, and there they\r\nfinished the conversation. "I was very glad to hear what he said\r\nabout you, old boy." This of course came from Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t quite understand him."\r\n\r\n"He meant you to understand that you wouldn\'t be like other younger\r\nbrothers."\r\n\r\n"Then what I have will be taken from you."\r\n\r\n"There is lots for three or four of us. I do agree that if a fellow\r\nhas as much as he can spend he ought not to want anything more.\r\nMorton was telling me the other day something about the settled\r\nestates. I sat in that office with him all one morning. I could not\r\nunderstand it all, but I observed that he said nothing about the\r\nScotch property. You\'ll be a laird, and I wish you joy with all my\r\nheart. The governor will tell you all about it before long. He\'s\r\ngoing to have two eldest sons."\r\n\r\n"What an unnatural piece of cruelty to me;--and so unnecessary!"\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"He says that a property is no better than a burden. But I\'ll try and\r\nbear it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nDinner at the Beargarden\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke was in the gallery of the House of Commons which is devoted\r\nto the use of peers, and Silverbridge, having heard that his father\r\nwas there, had come up to him. It was then about half-past five,\r\nand the House had settled down to business. Prayers had been read,\r\npetitions had been presented, and Ministers had gone through their\r\ncourse of baiting with that equanimity and air of superiority which\r\nalways belongs to a well-trained occupant of the Treasury bench.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was very anxious that his son should attend to his\r\nparliamentary duties, but he was too proud a man and too generous to\r\ncome to the House as a spy. It was his present habit always to be\r\nin his own place when the Lords were sitting, and to remain there\r\nwhile the Lords sat. It was not, for many reasons, an altogether\r\nsatisfactory occupation, but it was the best which his life afforded\r\nhim. He would never, however, come across into the other House,\r\nwithout letting his son know of his coming, and Lord Silverbridge had\r\non this occasion been on the look-out, and had come up to his father\r\nat once. "Don\'t let me take you away," said the Duke, "if you are\r\nparticularly interested in your Chief\'s defence," for Sir Timothy\r\nBeeswax was defending some measure of legal reform in which he was\r\nsaid to have fallen into trouble.\r\n\r\n"I can hear it up here, you know, sir."\r\n\r\n"Hardly if you are talking to me."\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth it\'s a matter I don\'t care much about. They\'ve got\r\ninto some mess as to the number of Judges and what they ought to do.\r\nFinn was saying that they had so arranged that there was one Judge\r\nwho never could possibly do anything."\r\n\r\n"If Mr. Finn said so it would probably be so, with some little\r\nallowance for Irish exaggeration. He is a clever man, with less of\r\nhis country\'s hyperbole than others;--but still not without his\r\nshare."\r\n\r\n"You know him well, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--as one man does know another in the political world."\r\n\r\n"But he is a friend of yours? I don\'t mean an \'honourable friend,\'\r\nwhich is great bosh; but you know him at home."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--certainly. He has been staying with me at Matching. In\r\npublic life such intimacies come from politics."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t care very much about him then."\r\n\r\nThe Duke paused a moment before he answered. "Yes I do;--and in what\r\nI said just now perhaps I wronged him. I have been under obligations\r\nto Mr. Finn,--in a matter as to which he behaved very well. I have\r\nfound him to be a gentleman. If you come across him in the House I\r\nwould wish you to be courteous to him. I have not seen him since we\r\ncame from abroad. I have been able to see nobody. But if ever again\r\nI should entertain my friends at my table, Mr. Finn would be one who\r\nwould always be welcome there." This he said with a sadly serious\r\nair as though wishing that his words should be noted. At the present\r\nmoment he was remembering that he owed recompense to Mrs. Finn, and\r\nwas making an effort to pay the debt. "But your leader is striking\r\nout into unwonted eloquence. Surely we ought to listen to him."\r\n\r\nSir Timothy was a fluent speaker, and when there was nothing to be\r\nsaid was possessed of great plenty of words. And he was gifted with\r\nthat peculiar power which enables a man to have the last word in\r\nevery encounter,--a power which we are apt to call repartee, which is\r\nin truth the readiness which comes from continual practice. You shall\r\nmeet two men of whom you shall know the one to be endowed with the\r\nbrilliancy of true genius, and the other to be possessed of but\r\nmoderate parts, and shall find the former never able to hold his\r\nown against the latter. In a debate, the man of moderate parts will\r\nseem to be greater than the man of genius. But this skill of tongue,\r\nthis glibness of speech is hardly an affair of intellect at all. It\r\nis,--as is style to the writer,--not the wares which he has to take\r\nto market, but the vehicle in which they may be carried. Of what\r\navail to you is it to have filled granaries with corn if you cannot\r\nget your corn to the consumer? Now Sir Timothy was a great vehicle,\r\nbut he had not in truth much corn to send. He could turn a laugh\r\nagainst an adversary;--no man better. He could seize, at the moment,\r\nevery advantage which the opportunity might give him. The Treasury\r\nBench on which he sat and the big box on the table before him were\r\nto him fortifications of which he knew how to use every stone. The\r\ncheers and the jeers of the House had been so measured by him that\r\nhe knew the value and force of every sound. Politics had never been\r\nto him a study; but to parliamentary strategy he had devoted all\r\nhis faculties. No one knew so well as Sir Timothy how to make\r\narrangements for business, so that every detail should be troublesome\r\nto his opponents. He could foresee a month beforehand that on a\r\ncertain day a Royal concert would make the House empty, and would\r\ngenerously give that day to a less observant adversary. He knew how\r\nto blind the eyes of members to the truth. Those on the opposite\r\nside of the House would find themselves checkmated by his\r\nastuteness,--when, with all their pieces on the board, there should\r\nbe none which they could move. And this to him was Government! It was\r\nto these purposes that he conceived that a great Statesman should\r\ndevote himself! Parliamentary management! That, in his mind, was\r\nunder this Constitution of ours the one act essential for Government.\r\n\r\nIn all this he was very great; but when it might fall to his duty\r\neither to suggest or to defend any real piece of proposed legislation\r\nhe was less happy. On this occasion he had been driven to take the\r\nmatter in hand because he had previously been concerned in it as\r\na lawyer. He had allowed himself to wax angry as he endeavoured\r\nto answer certain personal criticisms. Now Sir Timothy was never\r\nstronger than when he simulated anger. His mock indignation was\r\nperhaps his most powerful weapon. But real anger is a passion which\r\nfew men can use with judgment. And now Sir Timothy was really angry,\r\nand condescended to speak of our old friend Phineas who had made the\r\nonslaught as a bellicose Irishman. There was an over-true story as to\r\nour friend having once been seduced into fighting a duel, and those\r\nwho wished to decry him sometimes alluded to the adventure. Sir\r\nTimothy had been called to order, but the Speaker had ruled that\r\n"bellicose Irishman" was not beyond the latitude of parliamentary\r\nanimadversion. Then Sir Timothy had repeated the phrase with\r\nemphasis, and the Duke hearing it in the gallery had made his remark\r\nas to the unwonted eloquence of his son\'s parliamentary chief.\r\n\r\n"Surely we ought to listen to him," said the Duke. And for a short\r\ntime they did listen. "Sir Timothy is not a man I like, you know,"\r\nsaid the son, feeling himself obliged to apologise for his subjection\r\nto such a chief.\r\n\r\n"I never particularly loved him myself."\r\n\r\n"They say that he is a sort of necessity."\r\n\r\n"A Conservative Fate," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; he is so,--so awfully clever! We all feel that we could\r\nnot get on without him. When you were in, he was one of your party."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--he was one of us. I have no right to complain of you for\r\nusing him. But when you say you could not get on without him, does\r\nit not occur to you that should he,--let us say be taken up to\r\nheaven,--you would have to get on without him."\r\n\r\n"Then he would be,--out of the way, sir."\r\n\r\n"What you mean perhaps is that you do not know how to get rid of\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Of course I don\'t pretend to understand much about it; but they all\r\nthink that he does know how to keep the party together. I don\'t think\r\nwe are proud of him."\r\n\r\n"Hardly that."\r\n\r\n"He is awfully useful. A man has to look out so sharp to be always\r\nready for those other fellows! I beg your pardon, sir, but I mean\r\nyour side."\r\n\r\n"I understand who the other fellows are."\r\n\r\n"And it isn\'t everybody who will go through such a grind. A man to do\r\nit must be always ready. He has so many little things to think of. As\r\nfar as I can see we all feel that we could not get along very well\r\nwithout him." Upon the whole the Duke was pleased with what he heard\r\nfrom his son. The young man\'s ideas about politics were boyish, but\r\nthey were the ideas of a clear-headed boy. Silverbridge had picked up\r\nsome of the ways of the place, though he had not yet formed any sound\r\npolitical opinions.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Timothy finished a long speech with a flowery peroration,\r\nin which he declared that if Parliament were desirous of keeping the\r\nrealms of Her Majesty free from the invasions of foreigners it must\r\nbe done by maintaining the dignity of the Judicial bench. There were\r\nsome clamours at this; and although it was now dinner-time Phineas\r\nFinn, who had been called a bellicose Irishman, was able to say a\r\nword or two. "The Right Honourable gentleman no doubt means," said\r\nPhineas, "that we must carry ourselves with some increased external\r\ndignity. The world is bewigging itself, and we must buy a bigger wig\r\nthan any we have got, in order to confront the world with proper\r\nself-respect. Turveydrop and deportment will suffice for us against\r\nany odds."\r\n\r\nAbout half-past seven the House became very empty. "Where are you\r\ngoing to dine, sir?" asked Silverbridge. The Duke, with something\r\nlike a sigh, said he supposed he should dine at home.\r\n\r\n"You never were at the Beargarden;--were you, sir?" asked\r\nSilverbridge suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Never," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Come and dine with me."\r\n\r\n"I am not a member of the club."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t care at all about that. Anybody can take in anybody."\r\n\r\n"Does not that make it promiscuous?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--no; I don\'t know that it does. It seems to go on very well. I\r\ndaresay there are some cads there sometimes. But I don\'t know where\r\none doesn\'t meet cads. There are plenty in the House of Commons."\r\n\r\n"There is something in that, Silverbridge, which makes me think that\r\nyou have not realised the difference between private and public life.\r\nIn the former you choose your own associates and are responsible for\r\nyour choice. In the latter you are concerned with others for the good\r\nof the State; and though, even for the State\'s sake, you would not\r\nwillingly be closely allied with those whom you think dishonest,\r\nthe outward manners and fashions of life need create no barriers.\r\nI should not turn up my nose at the House of Commons because some\r\nconstituency might send them an illiterate shoemaker; but I might\r\nprobably find the illiterate shoemaker an unprofitable companion for\r\nmy private hours."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there will be any shoemakers at the Beargarden."\r\n\r\n"Even if there were I would go and dine with you. I shall be glad to\r\nsee the place where you, I suppose, pass many hours."\r\n\r\n"I find it a very good shop to dine at. The place at the House is so\r\nstuffy and nasty. Besides, one likes to get away for a little time."\r\n\r\n"Certainly. I never was an advocate for living in the House. One\r\nshould always change the atmosphere." Then they got into a cab and\r\nwent to the club. Silverbridge was a little afraid of what he was\r\ndoing. The invitation had come from him on the spur of the moment,\r\nand he hardly ventured to think that his father would accept it. And\r\nnow he did not quite know how the Duke would go through the ceremony.\r\n"The other fellows" would all come and stare at a man whom they had\r\nall been taught to regard as the most un-Beargardenish of men. But he\r\nwas especially anxious to make things pleasant for his father.\r\n\r\n"What shall I order?" said the son as he took the Duke into a\r\ndressing-room to wash his hands. The Duke suggested that anything\r\nsufficient for his son would certainly be sufficient for him.\r\n\r\nNothing especial occurred during the dinner, which the Duke appeared\r\nto enjoy very much. "Yes; I think it is very good soup," he said.\r\n"I don\'t think they ever give me any soup at home." Then the son\r\nexpressed his opinion that unless his father looked about rather more\r\nsharply, "they" very soon would provide no dinner at all, remarking\r\nthat experience had taught him that the less people demanded the more\r\nthey were "sat upon." The Duke did like his dinner,--or rather he\r\nliked the feeling that he was dining with his son. A report that the\r\nDuke of Omnium was with Lord Silverbridge soon went round the room,\r\nand they who were justified by some previous acquaintance came up to\r\ngreet him. To all who did so he was very gracious, and was specially\r\nso to Lord Popplecourt, who happened to pass close by the table.\r\n\r\n"I think he is a fool," whispered Silverbridge as soon as Popplecourt\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\n"What makes you think so?"\r\n\r\n"We thought him an ass at Eton."\r\n\r\n"He has done pretty well, however."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, in a way."\r\n\r\n"Somebody has told me that he is a careful man about his property."\r\n\r\n"I believe he is all that," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Then I don\'t see why you should think him a fool."\r\n\r\nTo this Silverbridge made no reply; partly perhaps because he had\r\nnothing to say,--but hindered also by the coming in of Tregear.\r\nThis was an accident, the possibility of which had not crossed him.\r\nUnfortunately too the Duke\'s back was turned, so that Tregear, as he\r\nwalked up the room, could not see who was sitting at his friend\'s\r\ntable. Tregear coming up stood close to the Duke\'s elbow before he\r\nrecognised the man, and spoke some word or two to Silverbridge. "How\r\ndo you do, Mr. Tregear," said the Duke, turning round.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my Lord, I did not know that it was you."\r\n\r\n"You hardly would. I am quite a stranger here. Silverbridge and I\r\ncame up from the House together, and he has been hospitable enough to\r\ngive me a dinner. I will tell you an odd thing for a London man, Mr.\r\nTregear. I have not dined at a London club for fifteen years before\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"I hope you like it, sir," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Very much indeed. Good-evening, Mr. Tregear. I suppose you have to\r\ngo to your dinner now."\r\n\r\nThen they went into one of the rooms upstairs to have coffee, the son\r\ndeclining to go into the smoking-room, and assuring his father that\r\nhe did not in the least care about a cigar after dinner. "You would\r\nbe smothered, sir." The Duke did as he was bidden and went upstairs.\r\nThere was in truth a strong reason for avoiding the publicity of the\r\nsmoking-room. When bringing his father to the club he had thought\r\nnothing about Tregear but he had thought about Tifto. As he entered\r\nhe had seen Tifto at a table dining alone, and had bobbed his head at\r\nhim. Then he had taken the Duke to the further end of the room, and\r\nhad trusted that fear would keep the Major in his place. Fear had\r\nkept the Major in his place. When the Major learned who the stranger\r\nwas, he had become silent and reserved. Before the father and son\r\nhad finished their dinner, Tifto had gone to his cigar; and so that\r\ndanger was over.\r\n\r\n"By George, there\'s Silverbridge has got his governor to dinner,"\r\nsaid Tifto, standing in the middle of the room, and looking round as\r\nthough he were announcing some confusion of the heavens and earth.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t Lord Silverbridge have his father to dine with him?"\r\nasked Mr. Lupton.\r\n\r\n"I believe I know Silverbridge as well as any man, and by George it\r\nis the very last thing of the kind that I should have expected. There\r\nhave been no end of quarrels."\r\n\r\n"There has been no quarrel at all," said Tregear, who had then just\r\nentered the room. "Nothing on earth would make Silverbridge quarrel\r\nwith his father, and I think it would break the Duke\'s heart to\r\nquarrel with his son." Tifto endeavoured to argue the matter out; but\r\nTregear having made the assertion on behalf of his friend would not\r\nallow himself to be enticed into further speech. Nevertheless there\r\nwas a good deal said by others, during which the Major drank two\r\nglasses of whisky-and-water. In the dining-room he had been struck\r\nwith awe by the Duke\'s presence, and had certainly no idea of\r\npresenting himself personally to the great man. But Bacchus lent\r\nhim aid, and when the discussion was over and the whisky had been\r\nswallowed, it occurred to him that he would go upstairs and ask to be\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Duke and his son were seated in close\r\nconversation on one of the upstairs sofas. It was a rule at the\r\nBeargarden that men might smoke all over the house except in the\r\ndining-room;--but there was one small chamber called the library, in\r\nwhich the practice was not often followed. The room was generally\r\ndeserted, and at this moment the father and son were the only\r\noccupants. "A club," said the Duke, as he sipped his coffee, "is\r\na comfortable and economical residence. A man gets what he wants\r\nwell-served, and gets it cheap. But it has its drawbacks."\r\n\r\n"You always see the same fellows," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"A man who lives much at a club is apt to fall into a selfish mode of\r\nlife. He is taught to think that his own comfort should always be the\r\nfirst object. A man can never be happy unless his first objects are\r\noutside himself. Personal self-indulgence begets a sense of meanness\r\nwhich sticks to a man even when he has got beyond all hope of rescue.\r\nIt is for that reason,--among others,--that marriage is so\r\ndesirable."\r\n\r\n"A man should marry, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Unless a man has on his shoulders the burden of a wife and children\r\nhe should, I think, feel that he has shirked out of school. He is not\r\ndoing his share of the work of the Commonwealth."\r\n\r\n"Pitt was not married, sir."\r\n\r\n"No;--and a great many other good men have remained unmarried. Do you\r\nmean to be another Pitt?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t intend to be a Prime Minister."\r\n\r\n"I would not recommend you to entertain that ambition. Pitt perhaps\r\nhardly had time for marriage. You may be more lucky."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I shall marry some day."\r\n\r\n"I should be glad to see you marry early," said the Duke, speaking\r\nin a low voice, almost solemnly, but in his quietest, sweetest tone\r\nof voice. "You are peculiarly situated. Though as yet you are only\r\nthe heir to the property and honours of our family, still, were you\r\nmarried, almost everything would be at your disposal. There is so\r\nmuch which I should only be too ready to give up to you!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear to hear you talking of giving up anything," said\r\nSilverbridge energetically.\r\n\r\nThen the father looked round the room furtively, and seeing that\r\nthe door was shut, and that they were assuredly alone, he put out\r\nhis hand and gently stroked the young man\'s hair. It was almost\r\na caress,--as though he would have said to himself, "Were he my\r\ndaughter, I would kiss him." "There is much I would fain give up," he\r\nsaid. "If you were a married man the house in Carlton Terrace would\r\nbe fitter for you than for me. I have disqualified myself for taking\r\nthat part in society which should be filled by the head of our\r\nfamily. You who have inherited so much from your mother would, if you\r\nmarried pleasantly, do all that right well." He paused for a moment\r\nand then asked a straightforward question, very quickly--"You have\r\nnever thought of any one yet, I suppose?"\r\n\r\nSilverbridge had thought very much of somebody. He was quite aware\r\nthat he had almost made an offer to Lady Mabel. She certainly had not\r\ngiven him any encouragement; but the very fact that she had not done\r\nso allured him the more. He did believe that he was thoroughly in\r\nlove with Lady Mabel. She had told him that he was too young,--but he\r\nwas older than Lady Mab herself by a week. She was beautiful;--that\r\nwas certain. It was acknowledged by all that she was clever. As\r\nfor blood, of which he believed his father thought much, there was\r\nperhaps none better in England. He had heard it said of her,--as\r\nhe now well remembered, in his father\'s presence,--that she had\r\nbehaved remarkably well in trying circumstances. She had no\r\nfortune;--everybody knew that; but then he did not want fortune.\r\nWould not this be a good opportunity for breaking the matter to his\r\nfather? "You have never thought of any one?" said the Duke,--again\r\nvery sweetly, very softly.\r\n\r\n"But I have!" Lord Silverbridge as he made the announcement blushed\r\nup to the eyes.\r\n\r\nThen there came over the father something almost of fear. If he was\r\nto be told, how would it be if he could not approve?\r\n\r\n"Yes I have," said Silverbridge, recovering himself. "If you wish it,\r\nI will tell you who it is."\r\n\r\n"Nay, my boy;--as to that consult your own feelings. Are you sure of\r\nyourself?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"Have you spoken to her?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes, in part. She has not accepted me, if you mean that.\r\nRather the contrary." Now the Duke would have been very unwilling to\r\nsay that his son would certainly be accepted by any girl in England\r\nto whom he might choose to offer his hand. But when the idea of a\r\ndoubt was suggested to him, it did seem odd that his son should ask\r\nin vain. What other young man was there who could offer so much, and\r\nwho was at the same time so likely to be loved for his own sake? He\r\nsmiled however and was silent. "I suppose I may as well out with it,"\r\ncontinued Silverbridge. "You know Lady Mabel Grex?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Mabel Grex? Yes;--I know her."\r\n\r\n"Is there any objection?"\r\n\r\n"Is she not your senior?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; no; she is younger than I am."\r\n\r\n"Her father is not a man I esteem."\r\n\r\n"But she has always been so good!" Then the Duke was again silent.\r\n"Have you not heard that, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I think I have."\r\n\r\n"Is not that a great deal?"\r\n\r\n"A very great deal. To be good must of all qualities be the best. She\r\nis very beautiful."\r\n\r\n"I think so, sir. Of course she has no money."\r\n\r\n"It is not needed. It is not needed. I have no objection to make. If\r\nyou are sure of your own mind--"\r\n\r\n"I am quite sure of that, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then I will raise no objection. Lady Mabel Grex! Her father, I fear,\r\nis not a worthy man. I hear that he is a gambler."\r\n\r\n"He is so poor!"\r\n\r\n"That makes it worse, Silverbridge. A man who gambles because he has\r\nmoney that he can afford to lose is, to my thinking, a fool. But he\r\nwho gambles because he has none, is--well, let us hope the best of\r\nhim. You may give her my love."\r\n\r\n"She has not accepted me."\r\n\r\n"But should she do so, you may."\r\n\r\n"She almost rejected me. But I am not sure that she was in earnest,\r\nand I mean to try again." Just at that moment the door was opened and\r\nMajor Tifto walked into the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nMajor Tifto and the Duke\r\n\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, Silverbridge," said the Major, entering the room,\r\n"but I was looking for Longstaff."\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t here," said Silverbridge, who did not wish to be\r\ninterrupted by his racing friend.\r\n\r\n"Your father, I believe?" said Tifto. He was red in the face but\r\nwas in other respects perhaps improved in appearance by his liquor.\r\nIn his more sober moments he was not always able to assume that\r\nappearance of equality with his companions which it was the ambition\r\nof his soul to achieve. But a second glass of whisky-and-water would\r\nalways enable him to cock his tail and bark before the company with\r\nall the courage of my lady\'s pug. "Would you do me the great honour\r\nto introduce me to his Grace?"\r\n\r\nSilverbridge was not prone to turn his back upon a friend because he\r\nwas low in the world. He had begun to understand that he had made\r\na mistake by connecting himself with the Major, but at the club he\r\nalways defended his partner. Though he not unfrequently found himself\r\nobliged to snub the Major himself, he always countenanced the little\r\nMaster of Hounds, and was true to his own idea of "standing to a\r\nfellow." Nevertheless he did not wish to introduce his friend to\r\nhis father. The Duke saw it all at a glance, and felt that the\r\nintroduction should be made. "Perhaps," said he, getting up from his\r\nchair, "this is Major Tifto."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--my Lord Duke. I am Major Tifto."\r\n\r\nThe Duke bowed graciously.\r\n\r\n"My father and I were engaged about private matters," said\r\nSilverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I beg ten thousand pardons," exclaimed the Major. "I did not intend\r\nto intrude."\r\n\r\n"I think we had done," said the Duke. "Pray sit down, Major Tifto."\r\nThe Major sat down. "Though now I bethink myself, I have to beg your\r\npardon;--that I a stranger should ask you to sit down in your own\r\nclub."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mention it, my Lord Duke."\r\n\r\n"I am so unused to clubs, that I forgot where I was."\r\n\r\n"Quite so, my Lord Duke. I hope you think that Silverbridge is\r\nlooking well?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--yes. I think so."\r\n\r\nSilverbridge bit his lips and turned his face away to the door.\r\n\r\n"We didn\'t make a very good thing of our Derby nag the other day.\r\nPerhaps your Grace has heard all that?"\r\n\r\n"I did hear that the horse in which you are both interested had\r\nfailed to win the race."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he did. The Prime Minister, we call him, your Grace,--out of\r\ncompliment to a certain Ministry which I wish it was going on to-day\r\ninstead of the seedy lot we\'ve got in. I think, my Lord Duke, that\r\nany one you may ask will tell you that I know what running is.\r\nWell;--I can assure you,--your Grace, that is,--that since I\'ve seen\r\n\'orses I\'ve never seen a \'orse fitter than him. When he got his\r\ncanter that morning, it was nearly even betting. Not that I or\r\nSilverbridge were fools enough to put on anything at that rate. But\r\nI never saw a \'orse so bad ridden. I don\'t mean to say anything, my\r\nLord Duke, against the man. But if that fellow hadn\'t been squared,\r\nor else wasn\'t drunk, or else wasn\'t off his head, that \'orse must\r\nhave won,--my Lord Duke."\r\n\r\n"I do not know anything about racing, Major Tifto."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not, your Grace. But as I and Silverbridge are together in\r\nthis matter I thought I\'d just let your Grace know that we ought to\r\nhave had a very good thing. I thought that perhaps your Grace might\r\nlike to know that."\r\n\r\n"Tifto, you are making an ass of yourself," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Making an ass of myself!" exclaimed the Major.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--considerably."\r\n\r\n"I think you are a little hard upon your friend," said the Duke, with\r\nan attempt at a laugh. "It is not to be supposed that he should know\r\nhow utterly indifferent I am to everything connected with the turf."\r\n\r\n"I thought, my Lord Duke, you might care about learning how\r\nSilverbridge was going on." This the poor little man said almost with\r\na whine. His partner\'s roughness had knocked out of him nearly all\r\nthe courage which Bacchus had given him.\r\n\r\n"So I do; anything that interests him, interests me. But perhaps of\r\nall his pursuits racing is the one to which I am least able to lend\r\nan attentive ear. That every horse has a head, and that all did have\r\ntails till they were ill-used, is the extent of my stable knowledge."\r\n\r\n"Very good indeed, my Lord Duke; very good indeed! Ha, ha, ha!--all\r\nhorses have heads, and all have tails! Heads and tails. Upon my word\r\nthat is the best thing I have heard for a long time. I will do myself\r\nthe honour of wishing your Grace good-night. By-bye, Silverbridge."\r\nThen he left the room, having been made supremely happy by what\r\nhe considered to have been the Duke\'s joke. Nevertheless he would\r\nremember the snubbing and would be even with Silverbridge some day.\r\nDid Lord Silverbridge think that he was going to look after his\r\nLordship\'s \'orses, and do this always on the square, and then be\r\nsnubbed for doing it!\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry that he should have come in to trouble you," said\r\nthe son.\r\n\r\n"He has not troubled me much. I do not know whether he has troubled\r\nyou. If you are coming down to the House again I will walk with you."\r\nSilverbridge of course had to go down to the House again, and they\r\nstarted together. "That man did not trouble me, Silverbridge; but the\r\nquestion is whether such an acquaintance must not be troublesome to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not very proud of him, sir."\r\n\r\n"But I think one ought to be proud of one\'s friends."\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t my friend in that way at all."\r\n\r\n"In what way then?"\r\n\r\n"He understands racing."\r\n\r\n"He is the partner of your pleasure then;--the man in whose society\r\nyou love to enjoy the recreation of the race-course."\r\n\r\n"It is, sir, because he understands it."\r\n\r\n"I thought that a gentleman on the turf would have a trainer for that\r\npurpose;--not a companion. You mean to imply that you can save money\r\nby leaguing yourself with Major Tifto?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir,--indeed."\r\n\r\n"If you associate with him, not for pleasure, then it surely must\r\nbe for profit. That you should do the former would be to me so\r\nsurprising that I must regard it as impossible. That you should do\r\nthe latter--is, I think, a reproach." This he said with no tone of\r\nanger in his voice,--so gently that Silverbridge at first hardly\r\nunderstood it. But gradually all that was meant came in upon him, and\r\nhe felt himself to be ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\n"He is bad," he said at last.\r\n\r\n"Whether he be bad I will not say; but I am sure that you can gain\r\nnothing by his companionship."\r\n\r\n"I will get rid of him," said Silverbridge, after a considerable\r\npause. "I cannot do so at once, but I will do it."\r\n\r\n"It will be better, I think."\r\n\r\n"Tregear has been telling me the same thing."\r\n\r\n"Is he objectionable to Mr. Tregear?" asked the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. Tregear cannot bear him. You treated him a great deal better\r\nthan Tregear ever does."\r\n\r\n"I do not deny that he is entitled to be treated well;--but so also\r\nis your groom. Let us say no more about him. And so it is to be Mabel\r\nGrex?"\r\n\r\n"I did not say so, sir. How can I answer for her? Only it was so\r\npleasant for me to know that you would approve if it should come\r\noff."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I will approve. When she has accepted you--"\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t think she will."\r\n\r\n"If she should, tell her that I will go to her at once. It will be\r\nmuch to have a new daughter;--very much that you should have a wife.\r\nWhere would she like to live?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, we haven\'t got as far as that yet."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not; I dare say not," said the Duke. "Gatherum is always\r\nthought to be dull."\r\n\r\n"She wouldn\'t like Gatherum, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\n"Have you asked her?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. But nobody ever did like Gatherum."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not. And yet, Silverbridge, what a sum of money it cost!"\r\n\r\n"I believe it did."\r\n\r\n"All vanity; and vexation of spirit!"\r\n\r\nThe Duke no doubt was thinking of certain scenes passed at the great\r\nhouse in question, which scenes had not been delightful to him. "No,\r\nI don\'t suppose she would wish to live at Gatherum. The Horns was\r\ngiven expressly by my uncle to your dear mother, and I should like\r\nMary to have the place."\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"You should live among your tenantry. I don\'t care so very much for\r\nMatching."\r\n\r\n"It is the one place you do like, sir."\r\n\r\n"However, we can manage all that. Carlton Terrace I do not\r\nparticularly like; but it is a good house, and there you should hang\r\nup your hat when in London. When it is settled, let me know at once."\r\n\r\n"But if it should never be settled?"\r\n\r\n"I will ask no questions; but if it be settled, tell me." Then in\r\nPalace Yard he was turning to go, but before he did so, he said\r\nanother word leaning on his son\'s shoulder. "I do not think that\r\nMabel Grex and Major Tifto would do well together at all."\r\n\r\n"There shall be an end to that, sir."\r\n\r\n"God bless you, my boy!" said the Duke.\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge sat in the House--or, to speak more accurately, in\r\nthe smoking-room of the House--for about an hour thinking over all\r\nthat had passed between himself and his father. He certainly had\r\nnot intended to say anything about Lady Mab, but on the spur of the\r\nmoment it had all come out. Now at any rate it was decided for him\r\nthat he must, in set terms, ask her to be his wife. The scene which\r\nhad just occurred had made him thoroughly sick of Major Tifto. He\r\nmust get rid of the Major, and there could be no way of doing this\r\nat once so easy and so little open to observation as marriage. If he\r\nwere but once engaged to Mabel Grex the dismissal of Tifto would be\r\nquite a matter of course. He would see Lady Mabel again on the morrow\r\nand ask her in direct language to be his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nMrs. Montacute Jones\'s Garden-Party\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was known to all the world that Mrs. Montacute Jones\'s first great\r\ngarden-party was to come off on Wednesday, 16th June, at Roehampton.\r\nMrs. Montacute Jones, who lived in Grosvenor Place and had a country\r\nhouse in Gloucestershire, and a place for young men to shoot at in\r\nScotland, also kept a suburban elysium at Roehampton, in order that\r\nshe might give two garden-parties every year. When it is said that\r\nall these costly luxuries appertained to Mrs. Montacute Jones, it\r\nis to be understood that they did in truth belong to Mr. Jones, of\r\nwhom nobody heard much. But of Mrs. Jones,--that is, Mrs. Montacute\r\nJones,--everybody heard a great deal. She was an old lady who devoted\r\nher life to the amusement of--not only her friends, but very many who\r\nwere not her friends. No doubt she was fond of Lords and Countesses,\r\nand worked very hard to get round her all the rank and fashion of the\r\nday. It must be acknowledged that she was a worldly old woman. But\r\nno more good-natured old woman lived in London, and everybody liked\r\nto be asked to her garden-parties. On this occasion there was to be\r\na considerable infusion of royal blood,--German, Belgian, French,\r\nSpanish, and of native growth. Everybody who was asked would go, and\r\neverybody had been asked,--who was anybody. Lord Silverbridge had\r\nbeen asked, and Lord Silverbridge intended to be there. Lady Mary,\r\nhis sister, could not even be asked, because her mother was hardly\r\nmore than three months dead; but it is understood in the world that\r\nwomen mourn longer than men.\r\n\r\nSilverbridge had mounted a private hansom cab in which he could be\r\ntaken about rapidly,--and, as he said himself, without being shut\r\nup in a coffin. In this vehicle he had himself taken to Roehampton,\r\npurporting to kill two birds with one stone. He had not as yet seen\r\nhis sister since she had been with Lady Cantrip. He would on this day\r\ncome back by The Horns.\r\n\r\nHe was well aware that Lady Mab would be at the garden-party. What\r\nplace could be better for putting the question he had to ask? He was\r\nby no means so confident as the heir to so many good things might\r\nperhaps have been without overdue self-confidence.\r\n\r\nEntering through the house into the lawn he encountered Mrs.\r\nMontacute Jones, who, with a seat behind her on the terrace,\r\nsurrounded by flowers, was going through the immense labour of\r\nreceiving her guests.\r\n\r\n"How very good of you to come all this way, Lord Silverbridge, to eat\r\nmy strawberries."\r\n\r\n"How very good of you to ask me! I did not come to eat your\r\nstrawberries but to see your friends."\r\n\r\n"You ought to have said you came to see me, you know. Have you met\r\nMiss Boncassen yet?"\r\n\r\n"The American beauty? No. Is she here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and she particularly wants to be introduced to you; you won\'t\r\nbetray me, will you?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not; I am as true as steel."\r\n\r\n"She wanted, she said, to see if the eldest son of the Duke of Omnium\r\nreally did look like any other man."\r\n\r\n"Then I don\'t want to see her," said Silverbridge, with a look of\r\nvexation.\r\n\r\n"There you are wrong, for there was real downright fun in the way\r\nshe said it. There they are, and I shall introduce you." Then Mrs.\r\nMontacute Jones absolutely left her post for a minute or two, and\r\ntaking the young lord down the steps of the terrace did introduce him\r\nto Mr. Boncassen, who was standing there amidst a crowd, and to Miss\r\nBoncassen the daughter.\r\n\r\nMr. Boncassen was an American who had lately arrived in England with\r\nthe object of carrying out certain literary pursuits in which he was\r\nengaged within the British Museum. He was an American who had nothing\r\nto do with politics and nothing to do with trade. He was a man of\r\nwealth and a man of letters. And he had a daughter who was said to\r\nbe the prettiest young woman either in Europe or in America at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nIsabel Boncassen was certainly a very pretty girl. I wish that\r\nmy reader would believe my simple assurance. But no such simple\r\nassurance was ever believed, and I doubt even whether any description\r\nwill procure for me from the reader that amount of faith which I\r\ndesire to achieve. But I must make the attempt. General opinion\r\ngenerally considered Miss Boncassen to be small, but she was in\r\ntruth something above the average height of English women. She was\r\nslight, without that look of slimness which is common to girls, and\r\nespecially to American girls. That her figure was perfect the reader\r\nmust believe on my word, as any detailed description of her arms,\r\nfeet, bust, and waist, would be altogether ineffective. Her hair\r\nwas dark brown and plentiful; but it added but little to her charms,\r\nwhich depended on other matters. Perhaps what struck the beholder\r\nfirst was the excessive brilliancy of her complexion. No pink was\r\never pinker, no alabaster whiteness was ever more like alabaster; but\r\nunder and around and through it all there was a constantly changing\r\nhue which gave a vitality to her countenance which no fixed colours\r\ncan produce. Her eyes, too, were full of life and brilliancy, and\r\neven when she was silent her mouth would speak. Nor was there a fault\r\nwithin the oval of her face upon which the hypercritics of mature age\r\ncould set a finger. Her teeth were excellent both in form and colour,\r\nbut were seen but seldom. Who does not know that look of ubiquitous\r\nivory produced by teeth which are too perfect in a face which is\r\notherwise poor? Her nose at the base spread a little,--so that it was\r\nnot purely Grecian. But who has ever seen a nose to be eloquent and\r\nexpressive, which did not so spread? It was, I think, the vitality\r\nof her countenance,--the way in which she could speak with every\r\nfeature, the command which she had of pathos, of humour, of sympathy,\r\nof satire, the assurance which she gave by every glance of her eye,\r\nevery elevation of her brow, every curl of her lip, that she was\r\nalive to all that was going on,--it was all this rather than those\r\nfeminine charms which can be catalogued and labelled that made all\r\nacknowledge that she was beautiful.\r\n\r\n"Lord Silverbridge," said Mr. Boncassen, speaking a little through\r\nhis nose, "I am proud to make your acquaintance, sir. Your father is\r\na man for whom we in our country have a great respect. I think, sir,\r\nyou must be proud of such a father."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes,--no doubt," said Silverbridge awkwardly. Then Mr. Boncassen\r\ncontinued his discourse with the gentlemen around him. Upon this our\r\nfriend turned to the young lady. "Have you been long in England, Miss\r\nBoncassen?"\r\n\r\n"Long enough to have heard about you and your father," she said,\r\nspeaking with no slightest twang.\r\n\r\n"I hope you have not heard any evil of me."\r\n\r\n"Well!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you can\'t have heard much good."\r\n\r\n"I know you didn\'t win the Derby."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been long enough to hear that?"\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose we don\'t interest ourselves about the Derby in New\r\nYork? Why, when we arrived at Queenstown I was leaning over the\r\ntaffrail so that I might ask the first man on board the tender\r\nwhether the Prime Minister had won."\r\n\r\n"And he said he hadn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t conceive why you of all men should call your horse by such a\r\nname. If my father had been President of the United States, I don\'t\r\nthink I\'d call a horse President."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t name the horse."\r\n\r\n"I\'d have changed it. But is it not very impudent in me to be finding\r\nfault with you the first time I have ever seen you? Shall you have a\r\nhorse at Ascot?"\r\n\r\n"There will be something going, I suppose. Nothing that I care\r\nabout." Lord Silverbridge had made up his mind that he would go to no\r\nraces with Tifto before the Leger. The Leger would be an affair of\r\nsuch moment as to demand his presence. After that should come the\r\ncomplete rupture between him and Tifto.\r\n\r\nThen there was a movement among the elders, and Lord Silverbridge\r\nsoon found himself walking alone with Miss Boncassen. It seemed to\r\nher to be quite natural to do so, and there certainly was no reason\r\nwhy he should decline anything so pleasant. It was thus that he had\r\nintended to walk with Mabel Grex;--only as yet he had not found her.\r\n"Oh yes," said Miss Boncassen, when they had been together about\r\ntwenty minutes; "we shall be here all the summer, and all the fall,\r\nand all the winter. Indeed father means to read every book in the\r\nBritish Museum before he goes back."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll have something to do."\r\n\r\n"He reads by steam, and he has two or three young men with him to\r\ntake it all down and make other books out of it;--just as you\'ll see\r\na lady take a lace shawl and turn it all about till she has trimmed\r\na petticoat with it. It is the same lace all through,--and so I tell\r\nfather it\'s the same knowledge."\r\n\r\n"But he puts it where more people will find it."\r\n\r\n"The lady endeavours to do the same with the lace. That depends on\r\nwhether people look up or down. Father however is a very learned man.\r\nYou mustn\'t suppose that I am laughing at him. He is going to write a\r\nvery learned book. Only everybody will be dead before it can be half\r\nfinished." They still went on together, and then he gave her his arm\r\nand took her into the place where the strawberries and cream were\r\nprepared. As he was going in he saw Mabel Grex walking with Tregear,\r\nand she bowed to him pleasantly and playfully. "Is that lady a great\r\nfriend of yours?" asked Miss Boncassen.\r\n\r\n"A very great friend indeed."\r\n\r\n"She is very beautiful."\r\n\r\n"And clever as well,--and good as gold."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! Do tell me who it is that owns all these qualities."\r\n\r\n"Lady Mabel Grex. She is daughter of Lord Grex. That man with her\r\nis my particular friend. His name is Frank Tregear, and they are\r\ncousins."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad they are cousins."\r\n\r\n"Why glad?"\r\n\r\n"Because his being with her won\'t make you unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Supposing I was in love with her,--which I am not,--do you suppose\r\nit would make me jealous to see her with another man?"\r\n\r\n"In our country it would not. A young lady may walk about with a\r\nyoung gentleman just as she might with another young lady; but I\r\nthought it was different here. Do you know, judging by English ways,\r\nI believe I am behaving very improperly in walking about with you so\r\nlong. Ought I not to tell you to go away?"\r\n\r\n"Pray do not."\r\n\r\n"As I am going to stay here so long I wish to behave well to English\r\neyes."\r\n\r\n"People know who you are, and discount all that."\r\n\r\n"If the difference be very marked they do. For instance, I needn\'t\r\nwear a hideous long bit of cloth over my face in Constantinople\r\nbecause I am a woman. But when the discrepancies are small, then they\r\nhave to be attended to. So I shan\'t walk about with you any more."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, you will," said Silverbridge, who began to think that he\r\nliked walking about with Miss Boncassen.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. There is Mr. Sprottle. He is father\'s secretary. He\r\nwill take me back."\r\n\r\n"Cannot I take you back as well as Mr. Sprottle?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed no;--I am not going to monopolise such a man as you. Do you\r\nthink that I don\'t understand that everybody will be making remarks\r\nupon the American girl who won\'t leave the son of the Duke of Omnium\r\nalone? There is your particular friend Lady Mabel, and here is my\r\nparticular friend Mr. Sprottle."\r\n\r\n"May I come and call?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Father will only be too proud,--and I shall be prouder.\r\nMother will be the proudest of all. Mother very seldom goes out. Till\r\nwe get a house we are at The Langham. Thank you, Mr. Sprottle. I\r\nthink we\'ll go and find father."\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge found himself close to Lady Mabel and Tregear, and\r\nalso to Miss Cassewary, who had now joined Lady Mabel. He had been\r\nmuch struck with the American beauty, but was not on that account\r\nthe less anxious to carry out his great plan. It was essentially\r\nnecessary that he should do so at once, because the matter had been\r\nsettled between him and his father. He was anxious to assure her that\r\nif she would consent, then the Duke would be ready to pour out all\r\nkinds of paternal blessings on their heads. "Come and take a turn\r\namong the haycocks," he said.\r\n\r\n"Frank declares," said Lady Mabel, "that the hay is hired for the\r\noccasion. I wonder whether that is true."\r\n\r\n"Anybody can see," said Tregear, "that it has not been cut off the\r\ngrass it stands upon."\r\n\r\n"If I could find Mrs. Montacute Jones I\'d ask her where she got it,"\r\nsaid Lady Mabel.\r\n\r\n"Are you coming?" asked Silverbridge impatiently.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I am. I have been walking round the haycocks till I am\r\ntired of them."\r\n\r\n"Anywhere else then?"\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t anywhere else. What have you done with your American\r\nbeauty? The truth is, Lord Silverbridge, you ask me for my company\r\nwhen she won\'t give you hers any longer. Doesn\'t it look like it,\r\nMiss Cassewary?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Lord Silverbridge is the man to forget an old friend\r\nfor a new one."\r\n\r\n"Not though the new friend be as lovely as Miss Boncassen?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I ever saw a prettier girl," said Tregear.\r\n\r\n"I quite admit it," said Lady Mabel. "But that is no salve for my\r\ninjured feelings I have heard so much about Miss Boncassen\'s beauty\r\nfor the last week, that I mean to get up a company of British\r\nfemales, limited, for the express purpose of putting her down. Who is\r\nMiss Boncassen that we are all to be put on one side for her?"\r\n\r\nOf course he knew that she was joking, but he hardly knew how to take\r\nher joke. There is a manner of joking which carries with it much\r\nserious intention. He did feel that Lady Mabel was not gracious to\r\nhim because he had spent half an hour with this new beauty, and he\r\nwas half inclined to be angry with her. Was it fitting that she\r\nshould be cross with him, seeing that he was resolved to throw at\r\nher feet all the good things that he had in the world? "Bother Miss\r\nBoncassen," he said; "you might as well come and take a turn with a\r\nfellow."\r\n\r\n"Come along, Miss Cassewary," said she. "We will go round the\r\nhaycocks yet once again." So they turned and the two ladies\r\naccompanied Lord Silverbridge.\r\n\r\nBut this was not what he wanted. He could not say what he had to say\r\nin the presence of Miss Cassewary,--nor could he ask her to take\r\nherself off in another direction. Nor could he take himself off. Now\r\nthat he had joined himself to these two ladies he must make with them\r\nthe tour of the gardens. All this made him cross. "These kind of\r\nthings are a great bore," he said.\r\n\r\n"I dare say you would rather be in the House of Commons;--or, better\r\nstill, at the Beargarden."\r\n\r\n"You mean to be ill-natured when you say that, Lady Mab."\r\n\r\n"You ask us to come and walk with you, and then you tell us that we\r\nare bores!"\r\n\r\n"I did nothing of the kind."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought that you would be particularly pleased with\r\nyourself for coming here to-day, seeing that you have made Miss\r\nBoncassen\'s acquaintance. To be allowed to walk half an hour alone\r\nwith the acknowledged beauty of the two hemispheres ought to be\r\nenough even for Lord Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"That is nonsense, Lady Mab."\r\n\r\n"Nothing gives so much zest to admiration as novelty. A republican\r\ncharmer must be exciting after all the blasees habituees of the\r\nLondon drawing-rooms."\r\n\r\n"How can you talk such nonsense, Mabel?" said Miss Cassewary.\r\n\r\n"But it is so. I feel that people must be sick of seeing me. I know I\r\nam very often sick of seeing them. Here is something fresh,--and not\r\nonly unlike, but so much more lovely. I quite acknowledge that I may\r\nbe jealous, but no one can say that I am spiteful. I wish that some\r\nrepublican Adonis or Apollo would crop up,--so that we might have our\r\nturn. But I don\'t think the republican gentlemen are equal to the\r\nrepublican ladies. Do you, Lord Silverbridge?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t thought about it."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Sprottle for instance."\r\n\r\n"I have not the pleasure of knowing Mr. Sprottle."\r\n\r\n"Now we\'ve been round the haycocks, and really, Lord Silverbridge, I\r\ndon\'t think we have gained much by it. Those forced marches never do\r\nany good." And so they parted.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking with a bitter spirit of the ill-result of his\r\nmorning\'s work when he again found himself close to Miss Boncassen\r\nin the crowd of departing people on the terrace. "Mind you keep\r\nyour word," she said. And then she turned to her father. "Lord\r\nSilverbridge has promised to call."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Boncassen will be delighted to make his acquaintance."\r\n\r\nHe got into his cab and was driven off towards Richmond. As he went\r\nhe began to think of the two young women with whom he had passed\r\nhis morning. Mabel had certainly behaved badly to him. Even if\r\nshe suspected nothing of his object, did she not owe it to their\r\nfriendship to be more courteous to him than she had been? And if she\r\nsuspected that object, should she not at any rate have given him the\r\nopportunity?\r\n\r\nOr could it be that she was really jealous of the American girl?\r\nNo;--that idea he rejected instantly. It was not compatible with the\r\ninnate modesty of his disposition. But no doubt the American girl was\r\nvery lovely. Merely as a thing to be looked at she was superior to\r\nMabel. He did feel that as to mere personal beauty she was in truth\r\nsuperior to anything he had ever seen before. And she was clever\r\ntoo;--and good-humoured;--whereas Mabel had been both ill-natured and\r\nunpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nThe Lovers Meet\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge found his sister alone. "I particularly want you,"\r\nsaid he, "to come and call on Mabel Grex. She wishes to know you, and\r\nI am sure you would like her."\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t been out anywhere yet," she said. "I don\'t feel as\r\nthough I wanted to go anywhere."\r\n\r\nNevertheless she was very anxious to know Lady Mabel Grex, of whom\r\nshe had heard much. A girl if she has had a former love passage says\r\nnothing of it to her new lover; but a man is not so reticent. Frank\r\nTregear had perhaps not told her everything, but he had told her\r\nsomething. "I was very fond of her;--very fond of her," he had said.\r\n"And so I am still," he had added. "As you are my love of loves,\r\nshe is my friend of friends." Lady Mary had been satisfied by the\r\nassurance, but had become anxious to see the friend of friends. She\r\nresisted at first her brother\'s entreaties. She felt that her father\r\nin delivering her over to the seclusion of The Horns had intended to\r\npreclude her from showing herself in London. She was conscious that\r\nshe was being treated with cruelty, and had a certain pride in her\r\nmartyrdom. She would obey her father to the letter; she would give\r\nhim no right to call her conduct in question; but he and any other to\r\nwhom he might entrust the care of her, should be made to know that\r\nshe thought him cruel. He had his power to which she must submit.\r\nBut she also had hers,--to which it was possible he might be made to\r\nsubmit. "I do not know that papa would wish me to go," she said.\r\n\r\n"But it is just what he would wish. He thinks a good deal about\r\nMabel."\r\n\r\n"Why should he think about her at all?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t exactly explain," said Silverbridge, "but he does."\r\n\r\n"If you mean to tell me that Mabel Grex is anything particular to\r\nyou, and that papa approves of it, I will go all round the world to\r\nsee her." But he had not meant to tell her this. The request had been\r\nmade at Lady Mabel\'s instance. When his sister had spoken of her\r\nfather\'s possible objection, then he had become eager in explaining\r\nthe Duke\'s feeling, not remembering that such anxiety might betray\r\nhimself. At that moment Lady Cantrip came in, and the question was\r\nreferred to her. She did not see any objection to such a visit, and\r\nexpressed her opinion that it would be a good thing that Mary should\r\nbe taken out. "She should begin to go somewhere," said Lady Cantrip.\r\nAnd so it was decided. On the next Friday he would come down early in\r\nhis hansom and drive her up to Belgrave Square. Then he would take\r\nher to Carlton Terrace, and Lady Cantrip\'s carriage should pick her\r\nup there and bring her home. He would arrange it all.\r\n\r\n"What did you think of the American beauty?" asked Lady Cantrip when\r\nthat was settled.\r\n\r\n"I thought she was a beauty."\r\n\r\n"So I perceived. You had eyes for nobody else," said Lady Cantrip,\r\nwho had been at the garden-party.\r\n\r\n"Somebody introduced her to me, and then I had to walk about the\r\ngrounds with her. That\'s the kind of thing one always does in those\r\nplaces."\r\n\r\n"Just so. That is what \'those places\' are meant for, I suppose. But\r\nit was not apparently a great infliction." Lord Silverbridge had\r\nto explain that it was not an infliction;--that it was a privilege,\r\nseeing that Miss Boncassen was both clever and lovely; but that it\r\ndid not mean anything in particular.\r\n\r\nWhen he took his leave he asked his sister to go out into the grounds\r\nwith him for a moment. This she did almost unwillingly, fearing that\r\nhe was about to speak to her of Tregear. But he had no such purpose\r\non his mind. "Of course you know," he began, "all that was nonsense\r\nyou were saying about Mabel."\r\n\r\n"I did not know."\r\n\r\n"I was afraid you might blurt out something before her."\r\n\r\n"I should not be so imprudent."\r\n\r\n"Girls do make such fools of themselves sometimes. They are always\r\nthinking about people being in love. But it is the truth that my\r\nfather said to me the other day how very much he liked what he had\r\nheard of her, and that he would like you to know her."\r\n\r\nOn that same evening Silverbridge wrote from the Beargarden the\r\nshortest possible note to Lady Mabel, telling her what he had\r\narranged. "I and Mary propose to call in B. Square on Friday at two.\r\nI must be early because of the House. You will give us lunch. S."\r\nThere was no word of endearment,--none even of those ordinary words\r\nwhich people who hate each other use to one another. But he received\r\nthe next day at home a much more kindly-written note from her:\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR LORD SILVERBRIDGE,\r\n\r\n   You are so good! You always do just what you think people\r\n   will like best. Nothing could please me so much as seeing\r\n   your sister, of whom of course I have heard very very\r\n   much. There shall be nobody here but Miss Cass.\r\n\r\n   Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n   M. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n"How I do wish I were a man!" his sister said to him when they were\r\nin the hansom together.\r\n\r\n"You\'d have a great deal more trouble."\r\n\r\n"But I\'d have a hansom of my own, and go where I pleased. How would\r\nyou like to be shut up at a place like The Horns?"\r\n\r\n"You can go out if you like it."\r\n\r\n"Not like you. Papa thinks it\'s the proper place for me to live in,\r\nand so I must live there. I don\'t think a woman ever chooses how or\r\nwhere she shall live herself."\r\n\r\n"You are not going to take up woman\'s rights, I hope."\r\n\r\n"I think I shall if I stay at The Horns much longer. What would papa\r\nsay if he heard that I was going to give a lecture at an Institute?"\r\n\r\n"The governor has had so many things to bear that a trifle such as\r\nthat would make but little difference."\r\n\r\n"Poor papa!"\r\n\r\n"He was dreadfully cut up about Gerald. And then he is so good! He\r\nsaid more to me about Gerald than he ever did about my own little\r\nmisfortune at Oxford; but to Gerald himself he said almost nothing.\r\nNow he has forgiven me because he thinks I am constant at the House."\r\n\r\n"And are you?"\r\n\r\n"Not so much as he thinks. I do go there,--for his sake. He has been\r\nso good about my changing sides."\r\n\r\n"I think you were quite right there."\r\n\r\n"I am beginning to think I was quite wrong. What did it matter to\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose it did make papa unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Of course it did;--and then this affair of yours." As soon as this\r\nwas said Lady Mary at once hardened her heart against her father.\r\nWhether Silverbridge was or was not entitled to his own political\r\nopinions,--seeing that the Pallisers had for ages been known as\r\nstaunch Whigs and Liberals,--might be a matter for question. But that\r\nshe had a right to her own lover she thought that there could be no\r\nquestion. As they were sitting in the cab he could hardly see her\r\nface, but he was aware that she was in some fashion arming herself\r\nagainst opposition. "I am sure that this makes him very unhappy,"\r\ncontinued Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"It cannot be altered," she said.\r\n\r\n"It will have to be altered."\r\n\r\n"Nothing can alter it. He might die, indeed;--or so might I."\r\n\r\n"Or he might see that it is no good,--and change his mind," suggested\r\nSilverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Of course that is possible," said Lady Mary very curtly,--showing\r\nplainly by her manner that the subject was one which she did not\r\nchoose to discuss any further.\r\n\r\n"It is very good of you to come to me," said Lady Mabel, kissing her\r\nnew acquaintance. "I have heard so much about you."\r\n\r\n"And I also of you."\r\n\r\n"I, you know, am one of your brother\'s stern Mentors. There are three\r\nor four of us determined to make him a pattern young legislator. Miss\r\nCassewary is another. Only she is not quite so stern as I am."\r\n\r\n"He ought to be very much obliged."\r\n\r\n"But he is not,--not a bit. Are you, Lord Silverbridge?"\r\n\r\n"Not so much as I ought to be, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"Of course there is an opposing force. There are the race-horses, and\r\nthe drag, and Major Tifto. No doubt you have heard of Major Tifto.\r\nThe Major is the Mr. Worldly-Wiseman who won\'t let Christian go to\r\nthe Strait Gate. I am afraid he hasn\'t read his Pilgrim\'s Progress.\r\nBut we shall prevail, Lady Mary, and he will get to the beautiful\r\ncity at last."\r\n\r\n"What is the beautiful city?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"A seat in the Cabinet, I suppose,--or that general respect which a\r\nyoung nobleman achieves when he has shown himself able to sit on a\r\nbench for six consecutive hours without appearing to go to sleep."\r\n\r\nThen they went to lunch, and Lady Mary did find herself to be happy\r\nwith her new acquaintance. Her life since her mother\'s death had\r\nbeen so sad, that this short escape from it was a relief to her.\r\nNow for awhile she found herself almost gay. There was an easy\r\nliveliness about Lady Mabel,--a grain of humour and playfulness\r\nconjoined,--which made her feel at home at once. And it seemed to her\r\nas though her brother was at home. He called the girl Lady Mab, and\r\nQueen Mab, and once plain Mabel, and the old woman he called Miss\r\nCass. It surely, she thought, must be the case that Lady Mabel and\r\nher brother were engaged.\r\n\r\n"Come upstairs into my own room,--it is nicer than this," said Lady\r\nMabel, and they went from the dining-room into a pretty little\r\nsitting-room with which Silverbridge was very well acquainted. "Have\r\nyou heard of Miss Boncassen?" Mary said she had heard something of\r\nMiss Boncassen\'s great beauty. "Everybody is talking about her. Your\r\nbrother met her at Mrs. Montacute Jones\'s garden-party, and was made\r\na conquest of instantly."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t made a conquest of at all," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Then he ought to have been made a conquest of. I should be if I were\r\na man. I think she is the loveliest person to look at and the nicest\r\nperson to listen to that I ever came across. We all feel that, as far\r\nas this season is concerned, we are cut out. But we don\'t mind it so\r\nmuch because she is a foreigner." Then just as she said this the door\r\nwas opened and Frank Tregear was announced.\r\n\r\nEverybody there present knew as well as does the reader, what was the\r\nconnexion between Tregear and Lady Mary Palliser. And each knew that\r\nthe other knew it. It was therefore impossible for them not to feel\r\nthemselves guilty among themselves. The two lovers had not seen each\r\nother since they had been together in Italy. Now they were brought\r\nface to face in this unexpected manner! And nobody except Tregear\r\nwas at first quite sure whether somebody had not done something to\r\narrange the meeting. Mary might naturally suspect that Lady Mabel had\r\ndone this in the interest of her friend Tregear, and Silverbridge\r\ncould not but suspect that it was so. Lady Mabel, who had never\r\nbefore met the other girl, could hardly refrain from thinking that\r\nthere had been some underhand communication,--and Miss Cassewary was\r\nclearly of opinion that there had been some understanding.\r\n\r\nSilverbridge was the first to speak. "Halloo, Tregear, I didn\'t know\r\nthat we were to see you."\r\n\r\n"Nor I, that I should see you," said he. Then of course there was a\r\nshaking of hands all round, in the course of which ceremony he came\r\nto Mary the last. She gave him her hand, but had not a word to say\r\nto him. "If I had known that you were here," he said, "I should not\r\nhave come; but I need hardly say how glad I am to see you,--even in\r\nthis way." Then the two girls were convinced that the meeting was\r\naccidental; but Miss Cass still had her doubts.\r\n\r\nConversation became at once very difficult. Tregear seated himself\r\nnear, but not very near, to Lady Mary, and made some attempt to talk\r\nto both the girls at once. Lady Mabel plainly showed that she was not\r\nat her ease;--whereas Mary seemed to be stricken dumb by the presence\r\nof her lover. Silverbridge was so much annoyed by a feeling that this\r\ninterview was a treason to his father, that he sat cudgelling his\r\nbrain to think how he should bring it to an end. Miss Cassewary was\r\ndumbfounded by the occasion. She was the one elder in the company\r\nwho ought to see that no wrong was committed. She was not directly\r\nresponsible to the Duke of Omnium, but she was thoroughly permeated\r\nby a feeling that it was her duty to take care that there should\r\nbe no clandestine love meetings in Lord Grex\'s house. At last\r\nSilverbridge jumped up from his chair. "Upon my word, Tregear, I\r\nthink you had better go," said he.\r\n\r\n"So do I," said Miss Cassewary. "If it is an accident--"\r\n\r\n"Of course it is an accident," said Tregear angrily,--looking round\r\nat Mary, who blushed up to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to doubt it," said the old lady. "But as it has\r\noccurred, Mabel, don\'t you think that he had better go?"\r\n\r\n"He won\'t bite anybody, Miss Cass."\r\n\r\n"She would not have come if she had expected it," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said Mary, speaking for the first time. "But now he\r\nis here--" Then she stopped herself, rose from the sofa, sat down,\r\nand then rising again, stepped up to her lover, who rose at the same\r\nmoment,--and threw herself into his arms and put up her lips to be\r\nkissed.\r\n\r\n"This won\'t do at all," said Silverbridge. Miss Cassewary clasped her\r\nhands together and looked up to heaven. She probably had never seen\r\nsuch a thing done before. Lady Mabel\'s eyes were filled with tears,\r\nand though in all this there was much to cause her anguish, still in\r\nher heart of hearts she admired the brave girl who could thus show\r\nher truth to her lover.\r\n\r\n"Now go," said Mary, through her sobs.\r\n\r\n"My own one," ejaculated Tregear.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, yes; always your own. Go,--go; go." She was weeping and\r\nsobbing as she said this, and hiding her face with her handkerchief.\r\nHe stood for a moment irresolute, and then left the room without a\r\nword of adieu to any one.\r\n\r\n"You have behaved very badly," said the brother.\r\n\r\n"She has behaved like an angel," said Mabel, throwing her arms round\r\nMary as she spoke, "like an angel. If there had been a girl whom you\r\nloved and who loved you, would you not have wished it? Would you\r\nnot have worshipped her for showing that she was not ashamed of her\r\nlove?"\r\n\r\n"I am not a bit ashamed," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"And I say that you have no cause. No one knows him as I do. How good\r\nhe is, and how worthy!" Immediately after that Silverbridge took his\r\nsister away, and Lady Mabel, escaping from Miss Cass, was alone. "She\r\nloves him almost as I have loved him," she said to herself. "I wonder\r\nwhether he can love her as he did me?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nWhat Came of the Meeting\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a word was said in the cab as Lord Silverbridge took his sister\r\nto Carlton Terrace, and he was leaving her without any reference to\r\nthe scene which had taken place, when an idea struck him that this\r\nwould be cruel. "Mary," he said, "I was very sorry for all that."\r\n\r\n"It was not my doing."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it was nobody\'s doing. But I am very sorry that it\r\noccurred. I think that you should have controlled yourself."\r\n\r\n"No!" she almost shouted.\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"No;--if you mean by controlling myself, holding my tongue. He is the\r\nman I love,--whom I have promised to marry."\r\n\r\n"But, Mary,--do ladies generally embrace their lovers in public?"\r\n\r\n"No;--nor should I. I never did such a thing in my life before. But\r\nas he was there I had to show that I was not ashamed of him! Do you\r\nthink I should have done it if you all had not been there?" Then\r\nagain she burst into tears.\r\n\r\nHe did not quite know what to make of it. Mabel Grex had declared\r\nthat she had behaved like an angel. But yet, as he thought of what\r\nhe had seen, he shuddered with vexation. "I was thinking of the\r\ngovernor," he said.\r\n\r\n"He shall be told everything."\r\n\r\n"That you met Tregear?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly; and that I--kissed him. I will do nothing that I am\r\nashamed to tell everybody."\r\n\r\n"He will be very angry."\r\n\r\n"I cannot help it. He should not treat me as he is doing. Mr. Tregear\r\nis a gentleman. Why did he let him come? Why did you bring him? But\r\nit is of no use. The thing is settled. Papa can break my heart, but\r\nhe cannot make me say that I am not engaged to Mr. Tregear."\r\n\r\nOn that night Mary told the whole of her story to Lady Cantrip. There\r\nwas nothing that she tried to conceal. "I got up," she said, "and\r\nthrew my arms round him. Is he not all the world to me?"\r\n\r\n"Had it been planned?" asked Lady Cantrip.\r\n\r\n"No;--no! Nothing had been planned. They are cousins and very\r\nintimate, and he goes there constantly. Now I want you to tell papa\r\nall about it."\r\n\r\nLady Cantrip began to think that it had been an evil day for her when\r\nshe had agreed to take charge of this very determined young lady; but\r\nshe consented at once to write to the Duke. As the girl was in her\r\nhands she must take care not to lay herself open to reproaches. As\r\nthis objectionable lover had either contrived a meeting, or had met\r\nher without contriving, it was necessary that the Duke should be\r\ninformed. "I would rather you wrote the letter," said Lady Mary. "But\r\npray tell him that all along I have meant him to know all about it."\r\n\r\nTill Lady Cantrip seated herself at her writing-table she did not\r\nknow how great the difficulty would be. It cannot in any circumstance\r\nbe easy to write to a father as to his daughter\'s love for an\r\nobjectionable lover; but the Duke\'s character added much to the\r\nseverity of the task. And then that embrace! She knew that the Duke\r\nwould be struck with horror as he read of such a tale, and she found\r\nherself almost struck with horror as she attempted to write it. When\r\nshe came to the point she found she could not write it. "I fear there\r\nwas a good deal of warmth shown on both sides," she said, feeling\r\nthat she was calumniating the man, as to whose warmth she had heard\r\nnothing. "It is quite clear," she added, "that this is not a passing\r\nfancy on her part."\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that the Duke should be made to understand\r\nexactly what had occurred. That Silverbridge had taken Mary he did\r\nunderstand, and that they had together gone to Lord Grex\'s house. He\r\nunderstood also that the meeting had taken place in the presence of\r\nSilverbridge and of Lady Mabel. "No doubt it was all an accident,"\r\nLady Cantrip wrote. How could it be an accident?\r\n\r\n"You had Mary up in town on Friday," he said to his son on the\r\nfollowing Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"And that friend of yours came in?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Do you not know what my wishes are?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I do;--but I could not help his coming. You do not suppose\r\nthat anybody had planned it?"\r\n\r\n"I hope not."\r\n\r\n"It was simply an accident. Such an accident as must occur over and\r\nover again,--unless Mary is to be locked up."\r\n\r\n"Who talks of locking anybody up? What right have you to speak in\r\nthat way?"\r\n\r\n"I only meant that of course they will stumble across each other in\r\nLondon."\r\n\r\n"I think I will go abroad," said the Duke. He was silent for awhile,\r\nand then repeated his words. "I think I will go abroad."\r\n\r\n"Not for long, I hope, sir."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--to live there. Why should I stay here? What good can I do\r\nhere? Everything I see and everything I hear is a pain to me." The\r\nyoung man of course could not but go back in his mind to the last\r\ninterview which he had had with his father, when the Duke had been so\r\ngracious and apparently so well pleased.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything else wrong,--except about Mary?" Silverbridge\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"I am told that Gerald owes about fifteen hundred pounds at\r\nCambridge."\r\n\r\n"So much as that! I knew he had a few horses there."\r\n\r\n"It is not the money, but the absence of principle,--that a young\r\nman should have no feeling that he ought to live within certain\r\nprescribed means! Do you know what you have had from Mr. Morton?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly, sir."\r\n\r\n"It is different with you. But a man, let him be who he may, should\r\nlive within certain means. As for your sister, I think she will\r\nbreak my heart." Silverbridge found it to be quite impossible to say\r\nanything in answer to this. "Are you going to church?" asked the\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of doing so particularly."\r\n\r\n"Do you not ever go?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--sometimes. I will go with you now, if you like it, sir."\r\n\r\n"I had thought of going, but my mind is too much harassed. I do not\r\nsee why you should not go."\r\n\r\nBut Silverbridge, though he had been willing to sacrifice his morning\r\nto his father,--for it was, I fear, in that way that he had looked at\r\nit,--did not see any reason for performing a duty which his father\r\nhimself omitted. And there were various matters also which harassed\r\nhim. On the previous evening, after dinner, he had allowed himself\r\nto back the Prime Minister for the Leger to a very serious amount.\r\nIn fact he had plunged, and now stood to lose some twenty thousand\r\npounds on the doings of the last night. And he had made these bets\r\nunder the influence of Major Tifto. It was the remembrance of this,\r\nafter the promise made to his father, that annoyed him the most.\r\nHe was imbued with a feeling that it behoved him as a man to "pull\r\nhimself together," as he would have said himself, and to live in\r\naccordance with certain rules. He could make the rules easily enough,\r\nbut he had never yet succeeded in keeping any one of them. He had\r\ndetermined to sever himself from Tifto, and, in doing that, had\r\nintended to sever himself from affairs of the turf generally. This\r\nresolution was not yet a week old. It was on that evening that he had\r\nresolved that Tifto should no longer be his companion; and now he had\r\nto confess to himself that because he had drunk three or four glasses\r\nof champagne he had been induced by Tifto to make those wretched\r\nbets.\r\n\r\nAnd he had told his father that he intended to ask Mabel Grex to be\r\nhis wife. He had so committed himself that the offer must now be\r\nmade. He did not specially regret that, though he wished that he had\r\nbeen more reticent. "What a fool a man is to blurt out everything!"\r\nhe said to himself. A wife would be a good thing for him; and where\r\ncould he possibly find a better wife than Mabel Grex? In beauty she\r\nwas no doubt inferior to Miss Boncassen. There was something about\r\nMiss Boncassen which made it impossible to forget her. But Miss\r\nBoncassen was an American, and on many accounts out of the question.\r\nIt did not occur to him that he would fall in love with Miss\r\nBoncassen; but still it seemed hard to him that this intention of\r\nmarriage should stand in his way of having a good time with Miss\r\nBoncassen for a few weeks. No doubt there were objections to\r\nmarriage. It clipped a fellow\'s wings. But then, if he were married,\r\nhe might be sure that Tifto would be laid aside. It was such a great\r\nthing to have got his father\'s assured consent to a marriage. It\r\nmeant complete independence in money matters.\r\n\r\nThen his mind ran away to a review of his father\'s affairs. It was a\r\ngenuine trouble to him that his father should be so unhappy. Of all\r\nthe griefs which weighed upon the Duke\'s mind, that in reference to\r\nhis sister was the heaviest. The money which Gerald owed at Cambridge\r\nwould be nothing if that other sorrow could be conquered. Nor had\r\nTifto and his own extravagance caused the Duke any incurable wounds.\r\nIf Tregear could be got out of the way, his father, he thought, might\r\nbe reconciled to other things. He felt very tender-hearted about his\r\nfather; but he had no remorse in regard to his sister as he made up\r\nhis mind that he would speak very seriously to Tregear.\r\n\r\nHe had wandered into St. James\'s Park, and had lighted by this time\r\nhalf-a-dozen cigarettes one after another, as he sat on one of the\r\nbenches. He was a handsome youth, all but six feet high, with light\r\nhair, with round blue eyes, and with all that aristocratic look,\r\nwhich had belonged so peculiarly to the late Duke but which was less\r\nconspicuous in the present head of the family. He was a young man\r\nwhom you would hardly pass in a crowd without observing,--but of whom\r\nyou would say, after due observation, that he had not as yet put off\r\nall his childish ways. He now sat with his legs stretched out, with\r\nhis cane in his hands, looking down upon the water. He was trying to\r\nthink. He worked hard at thinking. But the bench was hard and, upon\r\nthe whole, he was not satisfied with his position. He had just made\r\nup his mind that he would look up Tregear, when Tregear himself\r\nappeared on the path before him.\r\n\r\n"Tregear!" exclaimed Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Silverbridge!" exclaimed Tregear.\r\n\r\n"What on earth makes you walk about here on a Sunday morning?"\r\n\r\n"What on earth makes you sit there? That I should walk here, which\r\nI often do, does not seem to me odd. But that I should find you is\r\nmarvellous. Do you often come?"\r\n\r\n"Never was here in my life before. I strolled in because I had things\r\nto think of."\r\n\r\n"Questions to be asked in Parliament? Notices of motions, Amendments\r\nin Committee, and that kind of thing?"\r\n\r\n"Go on, old fellow."\r\n\r\n"Or perhaps Major Tifto has made important revelations."\r\n\r\n"D---- Major Tifto."\r\n\r\n"With all my heart," said Tregear.\r\n\r\n"Sit down here," said Silverbridge. "As it happened, at the moment\r\nwhen you came up I was thinking of you."\r\n\r\n"That was kind."\r\n\r\n"And I was determined to go to you. All this about my sister must be\r\ngiven up."\r\n\r\n"Must be given up?"\r\n\r\n"It can never lead to any good. I mean that there never can be a\r\nmarriage." Then he paused, but Tregear was determined to hear him\r\nout. "It is making my father so miserable that you would pity him if\r\nyou could see him."\r\n\r\n"I dare say I should. When I see people unhappy I always pity them.\r\nWhat I would ask you to think of is this. If I were to commission you\r\nto tell your sister that everything between us should be given up,\r\nwould not she be so unhappy that you would have to pity her?"\r\n\r\n"She would get over it."\r\n\r\n"And so will your father."\r\n\r\n"He has a right to have his own opinion on such a matter."\r\n\r\n"And so have I. And so has she. His rights in this matter are very\r\nclear and very potential. I am quite ready to admit that we cannot\r\nmarry for many years to come, unless he will provide the money. You\r\nare quite at liberty to tell him that I say so. I have no right to\r\nask your father for a penny, and I will never do so. The power is all\r\nin his hands. As far as I know my own purposes, I shall not make any\r\nimmediate attempt even to see her. We did meet, as you saw, the other\r\nday, by the merest chance. After that, do you think that your sister\r\nwishes me to give her up?"\r\n\r\n"As for supposing that girls are to have what they wish, that is\r\nnonsense."\r\n\r\n"For young men I suppose equally so. Life ought to be a life of\r\nself-denial, no doubt. Perhaps it might be my duty to retire from\r\nthis affair, if by doing so I should sacrifice only myself. The one\r\nperson of whom I am bound to think in this matter is the girl I\r\nlove."\r\n\r\n"That is just what she would say about you."\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"In that way you support each other. If it were any other man\r\ncircumstanced just like you are, and any other girl placed like Mary,\r\nyou would be the first to say that the man was behaving badly. I\r\ndon\'t like to use hard language to you, but in such a case you would\r\nbe the first to say of another man--that he was looking after the\r\ngirl\'s money."\r\n\r\nSilverbridge as he said this looked forward steadfastly on to the\r\nwater, regretting much that cause for quarrel should have arisen,\r\nbut thinking that Tregear would find himself obliged to quarrel.\r\nBut Tregear, after a few moments\' silence, having thought it out,\r\ndetermined that he would not quarrel. "I think I probably might," he\r\nsaid, laying his hand on Silverbridge\'s arm. "I think I perhaps might\r\nexpress such an opinion."\r\n\r\n"Well then!"\r\n\r\n"I have to examine myself, and find out whether I am guilty of the\r\nmeanness which I might perhaps be too ready to impute to another.\r\nI have done so, and I am quite sure that I am not drawn to your\r\nsister by any desire for her money. I did not seek her because\r\nshe was a rich man\'s daughter, nor,--because she is a rich man\'s\r\ndaughter,--will I give her up. She shall be mistress of the occasion.\r\nNothing but a word from her shall induce me to leave her;--but a word\r\nfrom her, if it comes from her own lips,--shall do so." Then he took\r\nhis friend\'s hand in his, and, having grasped it, walked away without\r\nsaying another word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nMiss Boncassen\'s River-Party. No. 1\r\n\r\n\r\nThrice within the next three weeks did Lord Silverbridge go forth\r\nto ask Mabel to be his wife, but thrice in vain. On one occasion\r\nshe would talk on other things. On the second Miss Cassewary would\r\nnot leave her. On the third the conversation turned in a very\r\ndisagreeable way on Miss Boncassen, as to whom Lord Silverbridge\r\ncould not but think that Lady Mabel said some very ill-natured\r\nthings. It was no doubt true that he, during the last three weeks,\r\nhad often been in Miss Boncassen\'s company, that he had danced\r\nwith her, ridden with her, taken her to the House of Lords and to\r\nthe House of Commons, and was now engaged to attend upon her at a\r\nriver-party up above Maidenhead. But Mabel had certainly no right to\r\ncomplain. Had he not thrice during the same period come there to lay\r\nhis coronet at her feet;--and now, at this very moment, was it not\r\nher fault that he was not going through the ceremony?\r\n\r\n"I suppose," she said, laughing, "that it is all settled."\r\n\r\n"What is all settled?"\r\n\r\n"About you and the American beauty."\r\n\r\n"I am not aware that anything particular has been settled."\r\n\r\n"Then it ought to be,--oughtn\'t it? For her sake, I mean."\r\n\r\n"That is so like an English woman," said Lord Silverbridge. "Because\r\nyou cannot understand a manner of life a little different from your\r\nown you will impute evil."\r\n\r\n"I have imputed no evil, Lord Silverbridge, and you have no right to\r\nsay so."\r\n\r\n"If you mean to assert," said Miss Cass, "that the manners of\r\nAmerican young ladies are freer than those of English young ladies,\r\nit is you that are taking away their characters."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say it would be at all bad," continued Lady Mabel. "She is\r\na beautiful girl, and very clever, and would make a charming Duchess.\r\nAnd then it would be such a delicious change to have an American\r\nDuchess."\r\n\r\n"She wouldn\'t be a Duchess."\r\n\r\n"Well, Countess, with Duchessship before her in the remote future.\r\nWouldn\'t it be a change, Miss Cass?"\r\n\r\n"Oh decidedly!" said Miss Cass.\r\n\r\n"And very much for the better. Quite a case of new blood, you know.\r\nPray don\'t suppose that I mean to object. Everybody who talks about\r\nit approves. I haven\'t heard a dissentient voice. Only as it has gone\r\nso far, and as English people are too stupid, you know, to understand\r\nall these new ways,--don\'t you think perhaps--?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think. I don\'t think anything except that you are very\r\nill-natured." Then he got up and, after making formal adieux to both\r\nthe ladies, left the house.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was gone Lady Mabel began to laugh, but the least\r\napprehensive ears would have perceived that the laughter was\r\naffected. Miss Cassewary did not laugh at all, but sat bolt upright\r\nand looked very serious. "Upon my honour," said the younger lady, "he\r\nis the most beautifully simple-minded human being I ever knew in my\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"Then I wouldn\'t laugh at him."\r\n\r\n"How can one help it? But of course I do it with a purpose."\r\n\r\n"What purpose?"\r\n\r\n"I think he is making a fool of himself. If somebody does not\r\ninterfere he will go so far that he will not be able to draw back\r\nwithout misbehaving."\r\n\r\n"I thought," said Miss Cassewary, in a very low voice, almost\r\nwhispering, "I thought that he was looking for a wife elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"You need not think of that again," said Lady Mab, jumping up from\r\nher seat. "I had thought of it too. But as I told you before, I\r\nspared him. He did not really mean it with me;--nor does he mean\r\nit with this American girl. Such young men seldom mean. They drift\r\ninto matrimony. But she will not spare him. It would be a national\r\ntriumph. All the States would sing a paean of glory. Fancy a New York\r\nbelle having compassed a Duke!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it possible. It would be too horrid."\r\n\r\n"I think it quite possible. As for me, I could teach myself to think\r\nit best as it is, were I not so sure that I should be better for him\r\nthan so many others. But I shouldn\'t love him."\r\n\r\n"Why not love him?"\r\n\r\n"He is such a boy. I should always treat him like a boy,--spoiling\r\nhim and petting him, but never respecting him. Don\'t run away with\r\nany idea that I should refuse him from conscientious motives, if he\r\nwere really to ask me. I too should like to be a Duchess. I should\r\nlike to bring all this misery at home to an end."\r\n\r\n"But you did refuse him."\r\n\r\n"Not exactly;--because he never asked me. For the moment I was weak,\r\nand so I let him have another chance. I shall not have been a good\r\nfriend to him if it ends in his marrying this Yankee."\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge went out of the house in a very ill humour,--which\r\nhowever left him when in the course of the afternoon he found himself\r\nup at Maidenhead with Miss Boncassen. Miss Boncassen at any rate did\r\nnot laugh at him. And then she was so pleasant, so full of common\r\nsense, and so completely intelligent! "I like you," she had said,\r\n"because I feel that you will not think that you ought to make love\r\nto me. There is nothing I hate so much as the idea that a young man\r\nand a young woman can\'t be acquainted with each other without some\r\nsuch tomfoolery as that." This had exactly expressed his own feeling.\r\nNothing could be so pleasant as his intimacy with Isabel Boncassen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Boncassen seemed to be a homely person, with no desire either\r\nto speak, or to be spoken to. She went out but seldom, and on those\r\nrare occasions did not in any way interfere with her daughter. Mr.\r\nBoncassen filled a prouder situation. Everybody knew that Miss\r\nBoncassen was in England because it suited Mr. Boncassen to spend\r\nmany hours in the British Museum. But still the daughter hardly\r\nseemed to be under control from the father. She went alone where she\r\nliked; talked to those she liked; and did what she liked. Some of the\r\nyoung ladies of the day thought that there was a good deal to be said\r\nin favour of the freedom which she enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThere is however a good deal to be said against it. All young ladies\r\ncannot be Miss Boncassens, with such an assurance of admirers as to\r\nbe free from all fear of loneliness. There is a comfort for a young\r\nlady in having a pied-a-terre to which she may retreat in case of\r\nneed. In American circles, where girls congregate without their\r\nmothers, there is a danger felt by young men that if a lady be\r\nonce taken in hand, there will be no possibility of getting rid of\r\nher,--no mamma to whom she may be taken and under whose wings she may\r\nbe dropped. "My dear," said an old gentleman the other day walking\r\nthrough an American ball-room, and addressing himself to a girl whom\r\nhe knew well,--"My dear--" But the girl bowed and passed on, still\r\nclinging to the arm of the young man who accompanied her. But the\r\nold gentleman was cruel, and possessed of a determined purpose. "My\r\ndear," said he again, catching the young man tight by the collar and\r\nholding him fast. "Don\'t be afraid; I\'ve got him; he shan\'t desert\r\nyou; I\'ll hold him here till you have told me how your father does."\r\nThe young lady looked as if she didn\'t like it, and the sight of her\r\nmisery gave rise to a feeling that, after all, mammas perhaps may be\r\na comfort.\r\n\r\nBut in her present phase of life Miss Boncassen suffered no\r\nmisfortune of this kind. It had become a privilege to be allowed to\r\nattend upon Miss Boncassen, and the feeling of this privilege had\r\nbeen enhanced by the manner in which Lord Silverbridge had devoted\r\nhimself to her. Fashion of course makes fashion. Had not Lord\r\nSilverbridge been so very much struck by the charm of the young lady,\r\nLords Glasslough and Popplecourt would not perhaps have found it\r\nnecessary to run after her. As it was, even that most unenergetic of\r\nyoung men, Dolly Longstaff, was moved to profound admiration.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion they were all up the river at Maidenhead. Mr.\r\nBoncassen had looked about for some means of returning the civilities\r\noffered to him, and had been instigated by Mrs. Montacute Jones to\r\ndo it after this fashion. There was a magnificent banquet spread in\r\na summer-house on the river bank. There were boats, and there was\r\na band, and there was a sward for dancing. There was lawn-tennis,\r\nand fishing-rods,--which nobody used,--and better still, long shady\r\nsecluded walks in which gentlemen might stroll,--and ladies too,\r\nif they were kind enough. The whole thing had been arranged by Mrs.\r\nMontacute Jones. As the day was fine, as many of the old people had\r\nabstained from coming, as there were plenty of young men of the\r\nbest sort, and as nothing had been spared in reference to external\r\ncomforts, the party promised to be a success. Every most lovely girl\r\nin London of course was there,--except Lady Mabel Grex. Lady Mabel\r\nwas in the habit of going everywhere, but on this occasion she\r\nhad refused Mrs. Boncassen\'s invitation. "I don\'t want to see her\r\ntriumphs," she had said to Miss Cass.\r\n\r\nEverybody went down by railway of course, and innumerable flies and\r\ncarriages had been provided to take them to the scene of action.\r\nSome immediately got into boats and rowed themselves up from the\r\nbridge,--which, as the thermometer was standing at eighty in the\r\nshade, was an inconsiderate proceeding. "I don\'t think I am quite up\r\nto that," said Dolly Longstaff, when it was proposed to him to take\r\nan oar. "Miss Amazon will do it. She rows so well, and is so strong."\r\nWhereupon Miss Amazon, not at all abashed, did take the oar; and as\r\nLord Silverbridge was on the seat behind her with the other oar she\r\nprobably enjoyed her task.\r\n\r\n"What a very nice sort of person Lady Cantrip is." This was said\r\nto Silverbridge by that generally silent young nobleman Lord\r\nPopplecourt. The remark was the more singular because Lady Cantrip\r\nwas not at the party,--and the more so again because, as Silverbridge\r\nthought, there could be but little in common between the Countess who\r\nhad his sister in charge and the young lord beside him, who was not\r\nfast only because he did not like to risk his money.\r\n\r\n"Well,--yes; I dare say she is."\r\n\r\n"I thought so, peculiarly. I was at that place at Richmond\r\nyesterday."\r\n\r\n"The devil you were! What were you doing at The Horns?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Cantrip\'s grandmother was,--I don\'t quite know what she was,\r\nbut something to us. I know I\'ve got a picture of her at Popplecourt.\r\nLady Cantrip wanted to ask me something about it, and so I went down.\r\nI was so glad to make acquaintance with your sister."\r\n\r\n"You saw Mary, did you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; I lunched there. I\'m to go down and meet the Duke some day."\r\n\r\n"Meet the Duke!"\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"No reason on earth,--only I can\'t imagine the governor going to\r\nRichmond for his dinner. Well! I am very glad to hear it. I hope\r\nyou\'ll get on well with him."\r\n\r\n"I was so much struck with your sister."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I dare say," said Silverbridge, turning away into the path\r\nwhere he saw Miss Boncassen standing with some other ladies. It\r\ncertainly did not occur to him that Popplecourt was to be brought\r\nforward as a suitor for his sister\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"I believe this is the most lovely place in the world," Miss\r\nBoncassen said to him.\r\n\r\n"We are so much the more obliged to you for bringing us here."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t bring you. You allow us to come with you and see all that\r\nis pretty and lovely."\r\n\r\n"Is it not your party?"\r\n\r\n"Father will pay the bill, I suppose,--as far as that goes. And\r\nmother\'s name was put on the cards. But of course we know what that\r\nmeans. It is because you and a few others like you have been so kind\r\nto us, that we are able to be here at all."\r\n\r\n"Everybody, I should think, must be kind to you."\r\n\r\n"I do have a good time pretty much; but nowhere so good as here. I\r\nfear that when I get back I shall not like New York."\r\n\r\n"I have heard you say, Miss Boncassen, that Americans were more\r\nlikeable than the English."\r\n\r\n"Have you? Well, yes; I think I have said so. And I think it is so.\r\nI\'d sooner have to dance with a bank clerk in New York, than with a\r\nbank clerk here."\r\n\r\n"Do you ever dance with bank clerks?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear yes. At least I suppose so. I dance with whoever comes up.\r\nWe haven\'t got lords in America, you know!"\r\n\r\n"You have got gentlemen?"\r\n\r\n"Plenty of them;--but they are not so easily defined as lords. I do\r\nlike lords."\r\n\r\n"Do you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes,--and ladies;--Countesses I mean and women of that sort. Your\r\nLady Mabel Grex is not here. Why wouldn\'t she come?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you didn\'t ask her."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes I did;--especially for your sake."\r\n\r\n"She is not my Lady Mabel Grex," said Lord Silverbridge with\r\nunnecessary energy.\r\n\r\n"But she will be."\r\n\r\n"What makes you think that?"\r\n\r\n"You are devoted to her."\r\n\r\n"Much more to you, Miss Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"That is nonsense, Lord Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"Not at all."\r\n\r\n"It is also--untrue."\r\n\r\n"Surely I must be the best judge of that myself."\r\n\r\n"Not a doubt; a judge not only whether it be true, but if true\r\nwhether expedient,--or even possible. What did I say to you when we\r\nfirst began to know each other?"\r\n\r\n"What did you say?"\r\n\r\n"That I liked knowing you;--that was frank enough;--that I liked\r\nknowing you because I knew that there would be no tomfoolery of\r\nlove-making." Then she paused; but he did not quite know how to go on\r\nwith the conversation at once, and she continued her speech. "When\r\nyou condescend to tell me that you are devoted to me, as though\r\nthat were the kind of thing that I expect to have said when I take\r\na walk with a young man in a wood, is not that the tomfoolery of\r\nlove-making?" She stopped and looked at him, so that he was obliged\r\nto answer.\r\n\r\n"Then why do you ask me if I am devoted to Lady Mabel? Would not that\r\nbe tomfoolery too?"\r\n\r\n"No. If I thought so, I would not have asked the question. I did\r\nspecially invite her to come here because I thought you would like\r\nit. You have got to marry somebody."\r\n\r\n"Some day, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"And why not her?"\r\n\r\n"If you come to that, why not you?" He felt himself to be getting\r\ninto deep waters as he said this,--but he had a meaning to express if\r\nonly he could find the words to express it. "I don\'t say whether it\r\nis tomfoolery, as you call it, or not; but whatever it is, you began\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--yes. I see. You punish me for my unpremeditated impertinence\r\nin suggesting that you are devoted to Lady Mabel by the premeditated\r\nimpertinence of pretending to be devoted to me."\r\n\r\n"Stop a moment. I cannot follow that." Then she laughed. "I will\r\nswear that I did not intend to be impertinent."\r\n\r\n"I hope not."\r\n\r\n"I am devoted to you."\r\n\r\n"Lord Silverbridge!"\r\n\r\n"I think you are--"\r\n\r\n"Stop, stop. Do not say it."\r\n\r\n"Well I won\'t;--not now. But there has been no tomfoolery."\r\n\r\n"May I ask a question, Lord Silverbridge? You will not be angry? I\r\nwould not have you angry with me."\r\n\r\n"I will not be angry," he said.\r\n\r\n"Are you not engaged to marry Lady Mabel Grex?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then I beg your pardon. I was told that you were engaged to her. And\r\nI thought your choice was so fortunate, so happy! I have seen no girl\r\nhere that I admire half so much. She almost comes up to my idea of\r\nwhat a young woman should be."\r\n\r\n"Almost!"\r\n\r\n"Now I am sure that if not engaged to her you must be in love with\r\nher, or my praise would have sufficed."\r\n\r\n"Though one knows a Lady Mabel Grex, one may become acquainted with a\r\nMiss Boncassen."\r\n\r\nThere are moments in which stupid people say clever things, obtuse\r\npeople say sharp things, and good-natured people say ill-natured\r\nthings. "Lord Silverbridge," she said, "I did not expect that from\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Expect what? I meant it simply."\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt you meant it simply. We Americans think ourselves\r\nsharp, but I have long since found out that we may meet more than our\r\nmatches over here. I think we will go back. Mother means to try to\r\nget up a quadrille."\r\n\r\n"You will dance with me?"\r\n\r\n"I think not. I have been walking with you, and I had better dance\r\nwith someone else."\r\n\r\n"You can let me have one dance."\r\n\r\n"I think not. There will not be many."\r\n\r\n"Are you angry with me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am; there." But as she said this she smiled. "The truth is,\r\nI thought I was getting the better of you, and you turned round and\r\ngave me a pat on the head to show me that you could be master when it\r\npleased you. You have defended your intelligence at the expense of\r\nyour good-nature."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be shot if I know what it all means," he said, just as he was\r\nparting with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nMiss Boncassen\'s River-Party. No. 2\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge made up his mind that as he could not dance with\r\nMiss Boncassen he would not dance at all. He was not angry at being\r\nrejected, and when he saw her stand up with Dolly Longstaff he felt\r\nno jealousy. She had refused to dance with him not because she did\r\nnot like him, but because she did not wish to show that she liked\r\nhim. He could understand that, though he had not quite followed all\r\nthe ins and outs of her little accusations against him. She had\r\nflattered him--without any intention of flattery on her part. She had\r\nspoken of his intelligence and had complained that he had been too\r\nsharp to her. Mabel Grex when most sweet to him, when most loving,\r\nalways made him feel that he was her inferior. She took no trouble\r\nto hide her conviction of his youthfulness. This was anything but\r\nflattering. Miss Boncassen, on the other hand, professed herself to\r\nbe almost afraid of him.\r\n\r\n"There shall be no tomfoolery of love-making," she had said. But\r\nwhat if it were not tomfoolery at all? What if it were good, genuine,\r\nearnest love-making? He certainly was not pledged to Lady Mabel. As\r\nregarded his father there would be a difficulty. In the first place\r\nhe had been fool enough to tell his father that he was going to make\r\nan offer to Mabel Grex. And then his father would surely refuse\r\nhis consent to a marriage with an American stranger. In such case\r\nthere would be no unlimited income, no immediate pleasantness of\r\nmagnificent life such as he knew would be poured out upon him if he\r\nwere to marry Mabel Grex. As he thought of this, however, he told\r\nhimself that he would not sell himself for money and magnificence.\r\nHe could afford to be independent, and gratify his own taste. Just\r\nat this moment he was of opinion that Isabel Boncassen would be the\r\nsweeter companion of the two.\r\n\r\nHe had sauntered down to the place where they were dancing and stood\r\nby, saying a few words to Mrs. Boncassen. "Why are you not dancing,\r\nmy Lord?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"There are enough without me."\r\n\r\n"I guess you young aristocrats are never over-fond of doing much with\r\nyour own arms and legs."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that; polo, you know, for the legs, and\r\nlawn-tennis for the arms, is hard work enough."\r\n\r\n"But it must always be something new-fangled; and after all it isn\'t\r\nof much account. Our young men like to have quite a time at dancing."\r\n\r\nIt all came through her nose! And she looked so common! What would\r\nthe Duke say to her, or Mary, or even Gerald? The father was by no\r\nmeans so objectionable. He was a tall, straight, ungainly man, who\r\nalways wore black clothes. He had dark, stiff, short hair, a long\r\nnose, and a forehead that was both high and broad. Ezekiel Boncassen\r\nwas the very man,--from his appearance,--for a President of the\r\nUnited States; and there were men who talked of him for that high\r\noffice. That he had never attended to politics was supposed to be\r\nin his favour. He had the reputation of being the most learned man\r\nin the States, and reputation itself often suffices to give a man\r\ndignity of manner. He, too, spoke through his nose, but the peculiar\r\ntwang coming from a man would be supposed to be virile and incisive.\r\nFrom a woman, Lord Silverbridge thought it to be unbearable. But as\r\nto Isabel, had she been born within the confines of some lordly park\r\nin Hertfordshire, she could not have been more completely free from\r\nthe abomination.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that you should not be enjoying yourself," said Mr.\r\nBoncassen, coming to his wife\'s relief.\r\n\r\n"Nothing could have been nicer. To tell the truth, I am standing idle\r\nby way of showing my anger against your daughter, who would not dance\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\n"I am sure she would have felt herself honoured," said Mr. Boncassen.\r\n\r\n"Who is the gentleman with her?" asked the mother.\r\n\r\n"A particular friend of mine--Dolly Longstaff."\r\n\r\n"Dolly!" ejaculated Mrs. Boncassen.\r\n\r\n"Everybody calls him so. His real name I believe to be Adolphus."\r\n\r\n"Is he,--is he--just anybody?" asked the anxious mother.\r\n\r\n"He is a very great deal,--as people go here. Everybody knows him.\r\nHe is asked everywhere, but he goes nowhere. The greatest compliment\r\npaid to you here is his presence."\r\n\r\n"Nay, my Lord, there are the Countess Montague, and the Marchioness\r\nof Capulet, and Lord Tybalt, and--"\r\n\r\n"They go everywhere. They are nobodies. It is a charity to even\r\ninvite them. But to have had Dolly Longstaff once is a triumph for\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"Laws!" said Mrs. Boncassen, looking hard at the young man who was\r\ndancing. "What has he done?"\r\n\r\n"He never did anything in his life."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he\'s very rich."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I should think not. I don\'t know anything about his\r\nriches, but I can assure you that having had him down here will quite\r\ngive a character to the day."\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Dolly Longstaff was in a state of great excitement.\r\nSome part of the character assigned to him by Lord Silverbridge was\r\ntrue. He very rarely did go anywhere, and yet was asked to a great\r\nmany places. He was a young man,--though not a very young man,--with\r\na fortune of his own and the expectation of a future fortune. Few men\r\nliving could have done less for the world than Dolly Longstaff,--and\r\nyet he had a position of his own. Now he had taken it into his head\r\nto fall in love with Miss Boncassen. This was an accident which\r\nhad probably never happened to him before, and which had disturbed\r\nhim much. He had known Miss Boncassen a week or two before Lord\r\nSilverbridge had seen her, having by some chance dined out and sat\r\nnext to her. From that moment he had become changed, and had gone\r\nhither and thither in pursuit of the American beauty. His passion\r\nhaving become suspected by his companions had excited their ridicule.\r\nNevertheless he had persevered;--and now he was absolutely dancing\r\nwith the lady out in the open air. "If this goes on, your friends\r\nwill have to look after you and put you somewhere," Mr. Lupton had\r\nsaid to him in one of the intervals of the dance. Dolly had turned\r\nround and scowled, and suggested that if Mr. Lupton would mind his\r\nown affairs it would be as well for the world at large.\r\n\r\nAt the present crisis Dolly was very much excited. When the dance was\r\nover, as a matter of course, he offered the lady his arm, and as a\r\nmatter of course she accepted it. "You\'ll take a turn; won\'t you?" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"It must be a very short turn," she said,--"as I am expected to make\r\nmyself busy."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother that."\r\n\r\n"It bothers me; but it has to be done."\r\n\r\n"You have set everything going now. They\'ll begin dancing again\r\nwithout your telling them."\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"And I\'ve got something I want to say."\r\n\r\n"Dear me; what is it?"\r\n\r\nThey were now on a path close to the riverside, in which there were\r\nmany loungers. "Would you mind coming up to the temple?" he said.\r\n\r\n"What temple?"\r\n\r\n"Oh such a beautiful place. The Temple of the Winds, I think they\r\ncall it, or Venus;--or--or--Mrs. Arthur de Bever."\r\n\r\n"Was she a goddess?"\r\n\r\n"It is something built to her memory. Such a view of the river! I was\r\nhere once before and they took me up there. Everybody who comes here\r\ngoes and sees Mrs. Arthur de Bever. They ought to have told you."\r\n\r\n"Let us go then," said Miss Boncassen. "Only it must not be long."\r\n\r\n"Five minutes will do it all." Then he walked rather quickly up a\r\nflight of rural steps. "Lovely spot; isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed."\r\n\r\n"That\'s Maidenhead Bridge;--that\'s--somebody\'s place;--and now I\'ve\r\ngot something to say to you."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not going to murder me now you\'ve got me up here alone?" said\r\nMiss Boncassen, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Murder you!" said Dolly, throwing himself into an attitude that was\r\nintended to express devoted affection. "Oh no!"\r\n\r\n"I am glad of that."\r\n\r\n"Miss Boncassen!"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Longstaff! If you sigh like that you\'ll burst yourself."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll--what?"\r\n\r\n"Burst yourself!" and she nodded her head at him.\r\n\r\nThen he clapped his hands together, and turned his head away from\r\nher towards the little temple. "I wonder whether she knows what love\r\nis," he said, as though he were addressing himself to Mrs. Arthur de\r\nBever.\r\n\r\n"No, she don\'t," said Miss Boncassen.\r\n\r\n"But I do," he shouted, turning back towards her. "I do. If any man\r\nwere ever absolutely, actually, really in love, I am the man."\r\n\r\n"Are you indeed, Mr. Longstaff? Isn\'t it pleasant?"\r\n\r\n"Pleasant;--pleasant? Oh, it could be so pleasant."\r\n\r\n"But who is the lady? Perhaps you don\'t mean to tell me that."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say you don\'t know?"\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t the least idea in life."\r\n\r\n"Let me tell you then that it could only be one person. It never was\r\nbut one person. It never could have been but one person. It is you."\r\nThen he put his hand well on his heart.\r\n\r\n"Me!" said Miss Boncassen, choosing to be ungrammatical in order that\r\nhe might be more absurd.\r\n\r\n"Of course it is you. Do you think that I should have brought you all\r\nthe way up here to tell you that I was in love with anybody else?"\r\n\r\n"I thought I was brought to see Mrs. de Somebody, and the view."\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said Dolly emphatically.\r\n\r\n"Then you have deceived me."\r\n\r\n"I will never deceive you. Only say that you will love me, and I will\r\nbe as true to you as the North Pole."\r\n\r\n"Is that true to me?"\r\n\r\n"You know what I mean."\r\n\r\n"But if I don\'t love you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you do!"\r\n\r\n"Do I?"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," said Dolly. "I didn\'t mean to say that. Of\r\ncourse a man shouldn\'t make sure of a thing."\r\n\r\n"Not in this case, Mr. Longstaff; because really I entertain no such\r\nfeeling."\r\n\r\n"But you can if you please. Just let me tell you who I am."\r\n\r\n"That will do no good whatever, Mr. Longstaff."\r\n\r\n"Let me tell you at any rate. I have a very good income of my own as\r\nit is."\r\n\r\n"Money can have nothing to do with it."\r\n\r\n"But I want you to know that I can afford it. You might perhaps have\r\nthought that I wanted your money."\r\n\r\n"I will attribute nothing evil to you, Mr. Longstaff. Only it is\r\nquite out of the question that I should--respond as I suppose you\r\nwish me to; and therefore, pray, do not say anything further."\r\n\r\nShe went to the head of the little steps but he interrupted her. "You\r\nought to hear me," he said.\r\n\r\n"I have heard you."\r\n\r\n"I can give you as good a position as any man without a title in\r\nEngland."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Longstaff, I rather fancy that wherever I may be I can make a\r\nposition for myself. At any rate I shall not marry with the view of\r\ngetting one. If my husband were an English Duke I should think myself\r\nnothing, unless I was something as Isabel Boncassen."\r\n\r\nWhen she said this she did not bethink herself that Lord Silverbridge\r\nwould in the course of nature become an English Duke. But the\r\nallusion to an English Duke told intensely on Dolly, who had\r\nsuspected that he had a noble rival. "English Dukes aren\'t so easily\r\ngot," he said.\r\n\r\n"Very likely not. I might have expressed my meaning better had I said\r\nan English Prince."\r\n\r\n"That\'s quite out of the question," said Dolly. "They can\'t do\r\nit,--by Act of Parliament,--except in a hugger-mugger left-handed\r\nway, that wouldn\'t suit you at all."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Longstaff,--you must forgive me--if I say--that of all the\r\ngentlemen--I have ever met in this country or in any other--you\r\nare the--most obtuse." This she brought out in little disjointed\r\nsentences, not with any hesitation, but in a way to make every word\r\nshe uttered more clear to an intelligence which she did not believe\r\nto be bright. But in this belief she did some injustice to Dolly. He\r\nwas quite alive to the disgrace of being called obtuse, and quick\r\nenough to avenge himself at the moment.\r\n\r\n"Am I?" said he. "How humble-minded you must be when you think me a\r\nfool because I have fallen in love with such a one as yourself."\r\n\r\n"I like you for that," she replied laughing, "and withdraw the\r\nepithet as not being applicable. Now we are quits and can forget and\r\nforgive;--only let there be the forgetting."\r\n\r\n"Never!" said Dolly, with his hand again on his heart.\r\n\r\n"Then let it be a little dream of your youth,--that you once met a\r\npretty American girl who was foolish enough to refuse all that you\r\nwould have given her."\r\n\r\n"So pretty! So awfully pretty!" Thereupon she curtsied. "I have seen\r\nall the handsome women in England going for the last ten years, and\r\nthere has not been one who has made me think that it would be worth\r\nmy while to get off my perch for her."\r\n\r\n"And now you would desert your perch for me!"\r\n\r\n"I have already."\r\n\r\n"But you can get up again. Let it be all a dream. I know men like to\r\nhave had such dreams. And in order that the dream may be pleasant the\r\nlast word between us shall be kind. Such admiration from such a one\r\nas you is an honour,--and I will reckon it among my honours. But\r\nit can be no more than a dream." Then she gave him her hand. "It\r\nshall be so;--shall it not?" Then she paused. "It must be so, Mr.\r\nLongstaff."\r\n\r\n"Must it?"\r\n\r\n"That and no more. Now I wish to go down. Will you come with me? It\r\nwill be better. Don\'t you think it is going to rain?"\r\n\r\nDolly looked up at the clouds. "I wish it would with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"I know you are not so ill-natured. It would spoil all."\r\n\r\n"You have spoiled all."\r\n\r\n"No, no. I have spoiled nothing. It will only be a little dream about\r\n\'that strange American girl, who really did make me feel queer for\r\nhalf an hour.\' Look at that. A great big drop--and the cloud has come\r\nover us as black as Erebus. Do hurry down." He was leading the way.\r\n"What shall we do for carriages to get us to the inn?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s the summer-house."\r\n\r\n"It will hold about half of us. And think what it will be to be in\r\nthere waiting till the rain shall be over! Everybody has been so\r\ngood-humoured and now they will be so cross!"\r\n\r\nThe rain was falling in big heavy drops, slow and far between, but\r\nalmost black with their size. And the heaviness of the cloud which\r\nhad gathered over them made everything black.\r\n\r\n"Will you have my arm?" said Silverbridge, who saw Miss Boncassen\r\nscudding along, with Dolly Longstaff following as fast as he could.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no. I have got to mind my dress. There;--I have gone right\r\ninto a puddle. Oh dear!" So she ran on, and Silverbridge followed\r\nclose behind her, leaving Dolly Longstaff in the distance.\r\n\r\nIt was not only Miss Boncassen who got her feet into a puddle and\r\nsplashed her stockings. Many did so who were not obliged by their\r\nposition to maintain good-humour under their misfortunes. The storm\r\nhad come on with such unexpected quickness that there had been a\r\ngeneral stampede to the summer-house. As Isabel had said, there was\r\ncomfortable room for not more than half of them. In a few minutes\r\npeople were crushed who never ought to be crushed. A Countess for\r\nwhom treble-piled sofas were hardly good enough was seated on the\r\ncorner of a table till some younger and less gorgeous lady could be\r\nmade to give way. And the Marchioness was declaring she was as wet\r\nthrough as though she had been dragged in a river. Mrs. Boncassen was\r\nso absolutely quelled as to have retired into the kitchen attached\r\nto the summer-house. Mr. Boncassen, with all his country\'s pluck and\r\npride, was proving to a knot of gentlemen round him on the verandah,\r\nthat such treachery in the weather was a thing unknown in his happier\r\ncountry. Miss Boncassen had to do her best to console the splashed\r\nladies. "Oh Mrs. Jones, is it not a pity! What can I do for you?"\r\n\r\n"We must bear it, my dear. It often does rain, but why on this\r\nspecial day should it come down out of buckets?"\r\n\r\n"I never was so wet in all my life," said Dolly Longstaff, poking in\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n"There\'s somebody smoking," said the Countess angrily. There was a\r\ncrowd of men smoking out on the verandah. "I never knew anything so\r\nnasty," the Countess continued, leaving it in doubt whether she spoke\r\nof the rain, or the smoke, or the party generally.\r\n\r\nDamp gauzes, splashed stockings, trampled muslins, and features which\r\nhave perhaps known something of rouge and certainly encountered\r\nsomething of rain may be made, but can only, by supreme high\r\nbreeding, be made compatible with good-humour. To be moist, muddy,\r\nrumpled and smeared, when by the very nature of your position it is\r\nyour duty to be clear-starched up to the pellucidity of crystal, to\r\nbe spotless as the lily, to be crisp as the ivy-leaf, and as clear\r\nin complexion as a rose,--is it not, O gentle readers, felt to be a\r\ndisgrace? It came to pass, therefore, that many were now very cross.\r\nCarriages were ordered under the idea that some improvement might be\r\nmade at the inn which was nearly a mile distant. Very few, however,\r\nhad their own carriages, and there was jockeying for the vehicles. In\r\nthe midst of all this Silverbridge remained as near to Miss Boncassen\r\nas circumstances would admit. "You are not waiting for me," she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am. We might as well go up to town together."\r\n\r\n"Leave me with father and mother. Like the captain of a ship, I must\r\nbe the last to leave the wreck."\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll be the gallant sailor of the day who always at the risk of\r\nhis life sticks to the skipper to the last moment."\r\n\r\n"Not at all;--just because there will be no gallantry. But come and\r\nsee us to-morrow and find out whether we have got through it alive."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nThe Langham Hotel\r\n\r\n\r\n"What an abominable climate," Mrs. Boncassen had said when they were\r\nquite alone at Maidenhead.\r\n\r\n"My dear, you didn\'t think you were to bring New York along with you\r\nwhen you came here," replied her husband.\r\n\r\n"I wish I was going back to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a foolish thing to say. People here are very kind, and you\r\nare seeing a great deal more of the world than you would ever see at\r\nhome. I am having a very good time. What do you say, Bell?"\r\n\r\n"I wish I could have kept my stockings clean."\r\n\r\n"But what about the young men?"\r\n\r\n"Young men are pretty much the same everywhere, I guess. They never\r\nhave their wits about them. They never mean what they say, because\r\nthey don\'t understand the use of words. They are generally half\r\nimpudent and half timid. When in love they do not at all understand\r\nwhat has befallen them. What they want they try to compass as a cow\r\ndoes when it stands stretching out its head towards a stack of hay\r\nwhich it cannot reach. Indeed there is no such thing as a young man,\r\nfor a man is not really a man till he is middle-aged. But take them\r\nat their worst they are a deal too good for us, for they become men\r\nsome day, whereas we must only be women to the end."\r\n\r\n"My word, Bella!" exclaimed the mother.\r\n\r\n"You have managed to be tolerably heavy upon God\'s creatures, taking\r\nthem in a lump," said the father. "Boys, girls, and cows! Something\r\nhas gone wrong with you besides the rain."\r\n\r\n"Nothing on earth, sir,--except the boredom."\r\n\r\n"Some young man has been talking to you, Bella."\r\n\r\n"One or two, mother; and I got to be thinking if any one of them\r\nshould ask me to marry him, and if moved by some evil destiny I were\r\nto take him, whether I should murder him, or myself, or run away with\r\none of the others."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t you bear with him till, according to your own theory, he\r\nwould grow out of his folly?" said the father.\r\n\r\n"Being a woman,--no. The present moment is always everything to me.\r\nWhen that horrid old harridan halloaed out that somebody was smoking,\r\nI thought I should have died. It was very bad just then."\r\n\r\n"Awful!" said Mrs. Boncassen, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t seem to feel it much," said the father. "One doesn\'t look\r\nto have everything just what one wants always. If I did I should go\r\nnowhere;--but my total life would be less enjoyable. If ever you do\r\nget married, Bell, you should remember that."\r\n\r\n"I mean to get married some day, so that I shouldn\'t be made love to\r\nany longer."\r\n\r\n"I hope it will have that effect," said the father.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Boncassen!" ejaculated the mother.\r\n\r\n"What I say is true. I hope it will have that effect. It had with\r\nyou, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that people didn\'t think of me as much as of anybody\r\nelse, even though I was married."\r\n\r\n"Then, my dear, I never knew it."\r\n\r\nMiss Boncassen, though she had behaved serenely and with good temper\r\nduring the process of Dolly\'s proposal, had not liked it. She had a\r\nvery high opinion of herself, and was certainly entitled to have it\r\nby the undisguised admiration of all that came near her. She was not\r\nmore indifferent to the admiration of young men than are other young\r\nladies. But she was not proud of the admiration of Dolly Longstaff.\r\nShe was here among strangers whose ways were unknown to her, whose\r\nrank and standing in the world were vague to her, and wonderful\r\nin their dimness. She knew that she was associating with men very\r\ndifferent from those at home where young men were supposed to be\r\nunder the necessity of earning their bread. At New York she would\r\ndance, as she had said, with bank clerks. She was not prepared to\r\nadmit that a young London lord was better than a New York bank clerk.\r\nJudging the men on their own individual merits she might find the\r\nbank clerk to be the better of the two. But a certain sweetness of\r\nthe aroma of rank was beginning to permeate her republican senses.\r\nThe softness of a life in which no occupation was compulsory had\r\nits charms for her. Though she had complained of the insufficient\r\nintelligence of young men she was alive to the delight of having\r\nnothings said to her pleasantly. All this had affected her so\r\nstrongly that she had almost felt that a life among these English\r\nluxuries would be a pleasant life. Like most Americans who do not as\r\nyet know the country, she had come with an inward feeling that as an\r\nAmerican and a republican she might probably be despised.\r\n\r\nThere is not uncommonly a savageness of self-assertion about\r\nAmericans which arises from a too great anxiety to be admitted\r\nto fellowship with Britons. She had felt this, and conscious of\r\nreputation already made by herself in the social life of New York,\r\nshe had half trusted that she would be well received in London, and\r\nhad half convinced herself that she would be rejected. She had not\r\nbeen rejected. She must have become quite aware of that. She had\r\ndropped very quickly the idea that she would be scorned. Ignorant\r\nas she had been of English life, she perceived that she had at\r\nonce become popular. And this had been so in spite of her mother\'s\r\nhomeliness and her father\'s awkwardness. By herself and by her own\r\ngifts she had done it. She had found out concerning herself that she\r\nhad that which would commend her to other society than that of the\r\nFifth Avenue. Those lords of whom she had heard were as plenty with\r\nher as blackberries. Young Lord Silverbridge, of whom she was told\r\nthat of all the young lords of the day he stood first in rank and\r\nwealth, was peculiarly her friend. Her brain was firmer than that of\r\nmost girls, but even her brain was a little turned. She never told\r\nherself that it would be well for her to become the wife of such a\r\none. In her more thoughtful moments she told herself that it would\r\nnot be well. But still the allurement was strong upon her. Park Lane\r\nwas sweeter than the Fifth Avenue. Lord Silverbridge was nicer than\r\nthe bank clerk.\r\n\r\nBut Dolly Longstaff was not. She would certainly prefer the bank\r\nclerk to Dolly Longstaff. And yet Dolly Longstaff was the one among\r\nher English admirers who had come forward and spoken out. She did not\r\ndesire that any one should come forward and speak out. But it was an\r\nannoyance to her that this special man should have done so.\r\n\r\nThe waiter at the Langham understood American ways perfectly, and\r\nwhen a young man called between three and four o\'clock, asking for\r\nMrs. Boncassen, said that Miss Boncassen was at home. The young\r\nman took off his hat, brushed up his hair, and followed the waiter\r\nup to the sitting-room. The door was opened and the young man was\r\nannounced. "Mr. Longstaff."\r\n\r\nMiss Boncassen was rather disgusted. She had had enough of this\r\nEnglish lover. Why should he have come after what had occurred\r\nyesterday? He ought to have felt that he was absolved from the\r\nnecessity of making personal inquiries. "I am glad to see that you\r\ngot home safe," she said as she gave him her hand.\r\n\r\n"And you too, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--so, so; with my clothes a good deal damaged and my temper\r\nrather worse."\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry."\r\n\r\n"It should not rain on such days. Mother has gone to church."\r\n\r\n"Oh;--indeed. I like going to church myself sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Do you now?"\r\n\r\n"I know what would make me like to go to church."\r\n\r\n"And father is at the Athenaeum. He goes there to do a little light\r\nreading in the library on Sunday afternoon."\r\n\r\n"I shall never forget yesterday, Miss Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t if your clothes had been spoilt as mine were."\r\n\r\n"Money will repair that."\r\n\r\n"Well; yes; but when I\'ve had a petticoat flounced particularly to\r\norder I don\'t like to see it ill-treated. There are emotions of the\r\nheart which money can\'t touch."\r\n\r\n"Just so;--emotions of the heart! That\'s the very phrase."\r\n\r\nShe was determined if possible to prevent a repetition of the scene\r\nwhich had taken place up at Mrs. de Bever\'s temple. "All my emotions\r\nare about my dress."\r\n\r\n"All?"\r\n\r\n"Well; yes; all. I guess I don\'t care much for eating and drinking."\r\nIn saying this she actually contrived to produce something of a nasal\r\ntwang.\r\n\r\n"Eating and drinking!" said Dolly. "Of course they are\r\nnecessities;--and so are clothes."\r\n\r\n"But new things are such ducks!"\r\n\r\n"Trowsers may be," said Dolly.\r\n\r\nThen she took a prolonged gaze at him, wondering whether he was or\r\nwas not such a fool as he looked. "How funny you are," she said.\r\n\r\n"A man does not generally feel funny after going through what I\r\nsuffered yesterday, Miss Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"Would you mind ringing the bell?"\r\n\r\n"Must it be done quite at once?"\r\n\r\n"Quite,--quite," she said. "I can do it myself for the matter of\r\nthat." And she rang the bell somewhat violently. Dolly sank back\r\nagain into his seat, remarking in his usual apathetic way that he had\r\nintended to obey her behest but had not understood that she was in so\r\ngreat a hurry. "I am always in a hurry," she said. "I like things to\r\nbe done--sharp." And she hit the table a crack. "Please bring me some\r\niced water," this of course was addressed to the waiter. "And a glass\r\nfor Mr. Longstaff."\r\n\r\n"None for me, thank you."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you\'d like soda and brandy?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no;--nothing of the kind. But I am so much obliged to you\r\nall the same." As the water-bottle was in fact standing in the room,\r\nand as the waiter had only to hand the glass, all this created but\r\nlittle obstacle. Still it had its effect, and Dolly, when the man\r\nhad retired, felt that there was a difficulty in proceeding. "I have\r\ncalled to-day--" he began.\r\n\r\n"That has been so kind of you. But mother has gone to church."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad that she has gone to church, because I wish to--"\r\n\r\n"Oh laws! There\'s a horse has tumbled down in the street. I heard\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"He has got up again," said Dolly, looking leisurely out of the\r\nwindow. "But as I was saying--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that the water we Americans drink can be good. It\r\nmakes the women become ugly so young."\r\n\r\n"You will never become ugly."\r\n\r\nShe got up and curtsied to him, and then, still standing, made him a\r\nspeech. "Mr. Longstaff, it would be absurd of me to pretend not to\r\nunderstand what you mean. But I won\'t have any more of it. Whether\r\nyou are making fun of me, or whether you are in earnest, it is just\r\nthe same."\r\n\r\n"Making fun of you!"\r\n\r\n"It does not signify. I don\'t care which it is. But I won\'t have it.\r\nThere!"\r\n\r\n"A gentleman should be allowed to express his feelings and to explain\r\nhis position."\r\n\r\n"You have expressed and explained more than enough, and I won\'t have\r\nany more. If you will sit down and talk about something else, or\r\nelse go away, there shall be an end of it;--but if you go on, I will\r\nring the bell again. What can a man gain by going on when a girl has\r\nspoken as I have done?" They were both at this time standing up, and\r\nhe was now as angry as she was.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve paid you the greatest compliment a man can pay a woman," he\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n"Very well. If I remember rightly I thanked you for it yesterday. If\r\nyou wish it, I will thank you again to-day. But it is a compliment\r\nwhich becomes very much the reverse if it be repeated too often. You\r\nare sharp enough to understand that I have done everything in my\r\npower to save us both from this trouble."\r\n\r\n"What makes you so fierce, Miss Boncassen?"\r\n\r\n"What makes you so foolish?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose it must be something peculiar to American ladies."\r\n\r\n"Just that;--something peculiar to American ladies. They don\'t\r\nlike--well; I don\'t want to say anything more that can be called\r\nfierce."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door was again opened and Lord Silverbridge was\r\nannounced. "Halloa, Dolly, are you here?"\r\n\r\n"It seems that I am."\r\n\r\n"And I am here too," said Miss Boncassen, smiling her prettiest.\r\n\r\n"None the worse for yesterday\'s troubles, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"A good deal the worse. I have been explaining all that to Mr.\r\nLongstaff, who has been quite sympathetic with me about my things."\r\n\r\n"A terrible pity that shower," said Dolly.\r\n\r\n"For you," said Silverbridge, "because, if I remember right, Miss\r\nBoncassen was walking with you;--but I was rather glad of it."\r\n\r\n"Lord Silverbridge!"\r\n\r\n"I regarded it as a direct interposition of Providence, because you\r\nwould not dance with me."\r\n\r\n"Any news to-day, Silverbridge?" asked Dolly.\r\n\r\n"Nothing particular. They say that Coalheaver can\'t run for the\r\nLeger."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" asked Dolly vigorously.\r\n\r\n"Broke down at Ascot. But I daresay it\'s a lie."\r\n\r\n"Sure to be a lie," said Dolly. "What do you think of Madame\r\nScholzdam, Miss Boncassen?"\r\n\r\n"I am not a good judge."\r\n\r\n"Never heard anything equal to it yet in this world," said Dolly. "I\r\nwonder whether that\'s true about Coalheaver?"\r\n\r\n"Tifto says so."\r\n\r\n"Which at the present moment," asked Miss Boncassen, "is the greater\r\nfavourite with the public, Madame Scholzdam or Coalheaver?"\r\n\r\n"Coalheaver is a horse, Miss Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"Oh,--a horse!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I ought to say a colt."\r\n\r\n"Oh,--a colt."\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose, Dolly, that Miss Boncassen doesn\'t know all that?"\r\nasked Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"He supposes that my American ferocity has never been sufficiently\r\nsoftened for the reception of polite erudition."\r\n\r\n"You two have been quarrelling, I fear."\r\n\r\n"I never quarrel with a woman," said Dolly.\r\n\r\n"Nor with a man in my presence, I hope," said Miss Boncassen.\r\n\r\n"Somebody does seem to have got out of bed at the wrong side," said\r\nSilverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I did," said Miss Boncassen. "I got out of bed at the wrong side.\r\nI am cross. I can\'t get over the spoiling of my flounces. I think\r\nyou had better both go away and leave me. If I could walk about\r\nthe room for half an hour and stamp my feet, I should get better."\r\nSilverbridge thought that as he had come last, he certainly ought to\r\nbe left last. Miss Boncassen felt that, at any rate, Mr. Longstaff\r\nshould go. Dolly felt that his manhood required him to remain. After\r\nwhat had taken place he was not going to leave the field vacant for\r\nanother. Therefore he made no effort to move.\r\n\r\n"That seems rather hard upon me," said Silverbridge. "You told me to\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n"I told you to come and ask after us all. You have come and asked\r\nafter us, and have been informed that we are very bad. What more can\r\nI say? You accuse me of getting out of bed the wrong side, and I own\r\nthat I did."\r\n\r\n"I meant to say that Dolly Longstaff had done so."\r\n\r\n"And I say it was Silverbridge," said Dolly.\r\n\r\n"We aren\'t very agreeable together, are we? Upon my word I think\r\nyou\'d better both go." Silverbridge immediately got up from his\r\nchair; upon which Dolly also moved.\r\n\r\n"What the mischief is up?" asked Silverbridge, when they were under\r\nthe porch together.\r\n\r\n"The truth is, you never can tell what you are to do with those\r\nAmerican girls."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you have been making up to her."\r\n\r\n"Nothing in earnest. She seemed to me to like admiration; so I told\r\nher I admired her."\r\n\r\n"What did she say then?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, you seem to be very great at cross-examining. Perhaps\r\nyou had better go back and ask her."\r\n\r\n"I will, next time I see her." Then he stepped into his cab, and in\r\na loud voice ordered the man to drive him to the Zoo. But when he\r\nhad gone a little way up Portland Place, he stopped the driver and\r\ndesired he might be taken back again to the hotel. As he left the\r\nvehicle he looked round for Dolly, but Dolly had certainly gone. Then\r\nhe told the waiter to take his card to Miss Boncassen, and explain\r\nthat he had something to say which he had forgotten.\r\n\r\n"So you have come back again?" said Miss Boncassen, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Of course I have. You didn\'t suppose I was going to let that fellow\r\nget the better of me. Why should I be turned out because he had made\r\nan ass of himself!"\r\n\r\n"Who said he made an ass of himself?"\r\n\r\n"But he had; hadn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"No;--by no means," said she after a little pause.\r\n\r\n"Tell me what he had been saying."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I shall do nothing of the kind. If I told you all he said,\r\nthen I should have to tell the next man all that you may say. Would\r\nthat be fair?"\r\n\r\n"I should not mind," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I dare say not, because you have nothing particular to say. But\r\nthe principle is the same. Lawyers and doctors and parsons talk of\r\nprivileged communications. Why should not a young lady have her\r\nprivileged communications?"\r\n\r\n"But I have something particular to say."\r\n\r\n"I hope not."\r\n\r\n"Why should you hope not?"\r\n\r\n"I hate having things said particularly. Nobody likes conversation so\r\nwell as I do; but it should never be particular."\r\n\r\n"I was going to tell you that I came back to London yesterday in the\r\nsame carriage with old Lady Clanfiddle, and that she swore that no\r\nconsideration on earth would ever induce her to go to Maidenhead\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t particular."\r\n\r\n"She went on to say;--you won\'t tell of me; will you?"\r\n\r\n"It shall all be privileged."\r\n\r\n"She went on to say that Americans couldn\'t be expected to understand\r\nEnglish manners."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they may be all the better for that."\r\n\r\n"Then I spoke up. I swore I was awfully in love with you."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I did;--that you were, out and away, the finest girl I ever saw in\r\nmy life. Of course you understand that her two daughters were there.\r\nAnd that as for manners,--unless the rain could be attributed to\r\nAmerican manners,--I did not think anything had gone wrong."\r\n\r\n"What about the smoking?"\r\n\r\n"I told her they were all Englishmen, and that if she had been giving\r\nthe party herself they would have smoked just as much. You must\r\nunderstand that she never does give any parties."\r\n\r\n"How could you be so ill-natured?"\r\n\r\n"There was ever so much more of it. And it ended in her telling me\r\nthat I was a schoolboy. I found out the cause of it all. A great\r\nspout of rain had come upon her daughter\'s hat, and that had produced\r\na most melancholy catastrophe."\r\n\r\n"I would have given her mine willingly."\r\n\r\n"An American hat;--to be worn by Lady Violet Clanfiddle!"\r\n\r\n"It came from Paris last week, sir."\r\n\r\n"But must have been contaminated by American contact."\r\n\r\n"Now, Lord Silverbridge," said she, getting up, "if I had a stick I\'d\r\nwhip you."\r\n\r\n"It was such fun."\r\n\r\n"And you come here and tell it all to me?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do. It was a deal too good to keep it to myself.\r\n\'American manners!\'" As he said this he almost succeeded in looking\r\nlike Lady Clanfiddle.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mr. Boncassen entered the room, and was immediately\r\nappealed to by his daughter. "Father, you must turn Lord Silverbridge\r\nout of the room."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! If I must,--of course I must. But why?"\r\n\r\n"He is saying everything horrid he can about Americans."\r\n\r\nAfter this they settled down for a few minutes to general\r\nconversation, and then Lord Silverbridge again took his leave. When\r\nhe was gone Isabel Boncassen almost regretted that the "something\r\nparticular" which he had threatened to say had not been less comic in\r\nits nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nLord Popplecourt\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the reader was told that Lord Popplecourt had found Lady Cantrip\r\nvery agreeable it is to be hoped that the reader was disgusted.\r\nLord Popplecourt would certainly not have given a second thought to\r\nLady Cantrip unless he had been specially flattered. And why should\r\nsuch a man have been flattered by a woman who was in all respects\r\nhis superior? The reader will understand. It had been settled by\r\nthe wisdom of the elders that it would be a good thing that Lord\r\nPopplecourt should marry Lady Mary Palliser.\r\n\r\nThe mutual assent which leads to marriage should no doubt be\r\nspontaneous. Who does not feel that? Young love should speak from its\r\nfirst doubtful unconscious spark,--a spark which any breath of air\r\nmay quench or cherish,--till it becomes a flame which nothing can\r\nsatisfy but the union of the two lovers. No one should be told to\r\nlove, or bidden to marry, this man or that woman. The theory of this\r\nis plain to us all, and till we have sons or daughters whom we feel\r\nimperatively obliged to control, the theory is unassailable. But the\r\nduty is so imperative! The Duke had taught himself to believe that\r\nas his wife would have been thrown away on the world had she been\r\nallowed to marry Burgo Fitzgerald, so would his daughter be thrown\r\naway were she allowed to marry Mr. Tregear. Therefore the theory\r\nof spontaneous love must in this case be set aside. Therefore the\r\nspark,--would that it had been no more!--must be quenched. Therefore\r\nthere could be no union of two lovers;--but simply a prudent and\r\nperhaps splendid marriage.\r\n\r\nLord Popplecourt was a man in possession of a large estate which was\r\nunencumbered. His rank in the peerage was not high; but his barony\r\nwas of an old date,--and, if things went well with him, something\r\nhigher in rank might be open to him. He had good looks of that sort\r\nwhich recommend themselves to pastors and masters, to elders and\r\nbetters. He had regular features. He looked as though he were\r\nsteady. He was not impatient nor rollicking. Silverbridge was also\r\ngood-looking;--but his good looks were such as would give a pang\r\nto the hearts of anxious mothers of daughters. Tregear was the\r\nhandsomest man of the three;--but then he looked as though he had no\r\nbetters and did not care for his elders. Lord Popplecourt, though\r\na very young man, had once stammered through half-a-dozen words in\r\nthe House of Lords, and had been known to dine with the "Benevolent\r\nFunds." Lord Silverbridge had declared him to be a fool. No one\r\nthought him to be bright. But in the eyes of the Duke,--and of Lady\r\nCantrip,--he had his good qualities.\r\n\r\nBut the work was very disagreeable. It was the more hard upon Lady\r\nCantrip because she did not believe in it. If it could be done, it\r\nwould be expedient. But she felt very strongly that it could not\r\nbe done. No doubt that Lady Glencora had been turned from her evil\r\ndestiny; but Lady Glencora had been younger than her daughter was\r\nnow, and possessed of less character. Nor was Lady Cantrip blind to\r\nthe difference between a poor man with a bad character, such as that\r\nBurgo had been, and a poor man with a good character, such as was\r\nTregear. Nevertheless she undertook to aid the work, and condescended\r\nto pretend to be so interested in the portrait of some common\r\nancestor as to persuade the young man to have it photographed,\r\nin order that the bringing down of the photograph might lead to\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nHe took the photograph, and Lady Cantrip said very much to him about\r\nhis grandmother, who was the old lady in question. "She could," she\r\nsaid, "just remember the features of the dear old woman." She was not\r\nhabitually a hypocrite, and she hated herself for what she was doing,\r\nand yet her object was simply good,--to bring together two young\r\npeople who might advantageously marry each other. The mere talking\r\nabout the old woman would be of no service. She longed to bring out\r\nthe offer plainly, and say, "There is Lady Mary Palliser. Don\'t you\r\nthink she\'d make a good wife for you?" But she could not, as yet,\r\nbring herself to be so indelicately plain. "You haven\'t seen the Duke\r\nsince?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"He spoke to me only yesterday in the House. I like the Duke."\r\n\r\n"If I may be allowed to say so, it would be for your advantage\r\nthat he should like you;--that is, if you mean to take a part in\r\npolitics."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I shall," said Popplecourt. "There isn\'t much else to do."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t go to races?" He shook his head. "I am glad of that,"\r\nsaid Lady Cantrip. "Nothing is so bad as the turf. I fear Lord\r\nSilverbridge is devoting himself to the turf."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it can be good for any man to have much to do with\r\nMajor Tifto. I suppose Silverbridge knows what he\'s about."\r\n\r\nHere was an opportunity which might have been used. It would have\r\nbeen so easy for her to glide from the imperfections of the brother\r\nto the perfections of the sister. But she could not bring herself to\r\ndo it quite at once. She approached the matter however as nearly as\r\nshe could without making her grand proposition. She shook her head\r\nsadly in reference to Silverbridge, and then spoke of the Duke. "His\r\nfather is so anxious about him."\r\n\r\n"I dare say."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know any man who is more painfully anxious about his\r\nchildren. He feels the responsibility so much since his wife\'s death.\r\nThere is Lady Mary."\r\n\r\n"She\'s all right, I should say."\r\n\r\n"All right! oh yes. But when a girl is possessed of so many\r\nthings,--rank, beauty, intelligence, large fortune,--"\r\n\r\n"Will Lady Mary have much?"\r\n\r\n"A large portion of her mother\'s money, I should say. When all these\r\nthings are joined together, a father of course feels most anxious as\r\nto their disposal."\r\n\r\n"I suppose she is clever."\r\n\r\n"Very clever," said Lady Cantrip.\r\n\r\n"I think a girl may be too clever, you know," said Lord Popplecourt.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she may. But I know more who are too foolish. I am so much\r\nobliged to you for the photograph."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mention it."\r\n\r\n"I really did mean that you should send a man down."\r\n\r\nOn that occasion the two young people did not see each other. Lady\r\nMary did not come down, and Lady Cantrip lacked the courage to send\r\nfor her. As it was, might it not be possible that the young man\r\nshould be induced to make himself agreeable to the young lady without\r\nany further explanation? But love-making between young people\r\ncannot well take place unless they be brought together. There was a\r\ndifficulty in bringing them together at Richmond. The Duke had indeed\r\nspoken of meeting Lord Popplecourt at dinner there;--but this was to\r\nhave followed the proposition which Lady Cantrip should make to him.\r\nShe could not yet make the proposition, and therefore she hardly\r\nknew how to arrange the dinner. She was obliged at last to let the\r\nwished-for lover go away without arranging anything. When the Duke\r\nshould have settled his autumn plans, then an attempt must be made to\r\ninduce Lord Popplecourt to travel in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThat evening Lady Cantrip said a few words to Mary respecting the\r\nproposed suitor. "There is nothing I have such a horror of as\r\ngambling," she said.\r\n\r\n"It is dreadful."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to think that Nidderdale does not do anything of that\r\nsort." It was perhaps on the cards that Nidderdale should do things\r\nof which she knew nothing. "I hope Silverbridge does not bet."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he does."\r\n\r\n"There\'s Lord Popplecourt,--quite a young man,--with everything at\r\nhis own disposal, and a very large estate. Think of the evil he might\r\ndo if he were given that way."\r\n\r\n"Does he gamble?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all. It must be such a comfort to his mother!"\r\n\r\n"He looks to me as though he never would do anything," said Lady\r\nMary. Then the subject was dropped.\r\n\r\nIt was a week after this, towards the end of July, that the Duke\r\nwrote a line to Lady Cantrip, apologising for what he had done, but\r\nexplaining that he had asked Lord Popplecourt to dine at The Horns on\r\na certain Sunday. He had, he said, been assured by Lord Cantrip that\r\nsuch an arrangement would be quite convenient. It was clear from his\r\nletter that he was much in earnest. Of course there was no reason why\r\nthe dinner should not be eaten. Only the speciality of the invitation\r\nto Lord Popplecourt must not be so glaring that he himself should be\r\nstruck by the strangeness of it. There must be a little party made\r\nup. Lord Nidderdale and his wife were therefore bidden to come down,\r\nand Silverbridge, who at first consented rather unwillingly,--and\r\nLady Mabel Grex, as to whom the Duke made a special request that she\r\nmight be asked. This last invitation was sent express from Lady Mary,\r\nand included Miss Cass. So the party was made up. The careful reader\r\nwill perceive that there were to be ten of them.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it odd papa wanting to have Lady Mabel?" Mary said to Lady\r\nCantrip.\r\n\r\n"Does he not know her, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"He hardly ever spoke to her. I\'ll tell you what; I expect\r\nSilverbridge is going to marry her."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why he shouldn\'t. She is very beautiful, and very\r\nclever. But if so, papa must know all about it. It does seem so odd\r\nthat papa of all people should turn match-maker, or even that he\r\nshould think of it."\r\n\r\n"So much is thrown upon him now," said Lady Cantrip\r\n\r\n"Poor papa!" Then she remembered herself, and spoke with a little\r\nstart. "Of course I am not thinking of myself. Arranging a marriage\r\nis very different from preventing any one from marrying."\r\n\r\n"Whatever he may think to be his duty he will be sure to do it," said\r\nthe elder lady very solemnly.\r\n\r\nLady Mabel was surprised by the invitation, but she was not slow\r\nto accept it. "Papa will be here and will be so glad to meet you,"\r\nLady Mary had said. Why should the Duke of Omnium wish to meet her?\r\n"Silverbridge will be here too," Mary had gone on to say. "It is just\r\na family party. Papa, you know, is not going anywhere; nor am I."\r\nBy all this Lady Mabel\'s thoughts were much stirred, and her bosom\r\nsomewhat moved. And Silverbridge also was moved by it. Of course he\r\ncould not but remember that he had pledged himself to his father to\r\nask Lady Mabel to be his wife. He had faltered since. She had been,\r\nhe thought, unkind to him, or at any rate indifferent. He had surely\r\nsaid enough to her to make her know what he meant; and yet she had\r\ntaken no trouble to meet him half way. And then Isabel Boncassen had\r\nintervened. Now he was asked to dinner in a most unusual manner!\r\n\r\nOf all the guests invited Lord Popplecourt was perhaps the least\r\ndisturbed. He was quite alive to the honour of being noticed by the\r\nDuke of Omnium, and alive also to the flattering courtesy shown to\r\nhim by Lady Cantrip. But justice would not be done him unless it were\r\nacknowledged that he had as yet flattered himself with no hopes in\r\nregard to Lady Mary Palliser. He, when he prepared himself for his\r\njourney down to Richmond, thought much more of the Duke than of the\r\nDuke\'s daughter.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I can drive you down if you like that kind of thing,"\r\nSilverbridge said to him on the Saturday evening.\r\n\r\n"And bring me back?"\r\n\r\n"If you will come when I am coming. I hate waiting for a fellow."\r\n\r\n"Suppose we leave at half-past ten."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t fix any time; but if we can\'t make it suit there\'ll be the\r\ngovernor\'s carriage."\r\n\r\n"Will the Duke go down in his carriage?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. It\'s quicker and less trouble than the railway." Then\r\nLord Popplecourt reflected that he would certainly come back with\r\nthe Duke if he could so manage it, and there floated before his eyes\r\nvisions of under-secretaryships, all of which might owe their origin\r\nto this proposed drive up from Richmond.\r\n\r\nAt six o\'clock on the Sunday evening Silverbridge called for Lord\r\nPopplecourt. "Upon my word," said he, "I didn\'t ever expect to see\r\nyou in my cab."\r\n\r\n"Why not me especially?"\r\n\r\n"Because you\'re not one of our lot."\r\n\r\n"You\'d sooner have Tifto, I dare say."\r\n\r\n"No, I wouldn\'t. Tifto is not at all a pleasant companion, though he\r\nunderstands horses. You\'re going in for heavy politics, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Not particularly heavy."\r\n\r\n"If not, why on earth does my governor take you up? You won\'t mind my\r\nsmoking, I dare say." After this there was no conversation between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n"Don\'t You Think--?"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was pretty to see the Duke\'s reception of Lady Mabel. "I knew your\r\nmother many years ago," he said, "when I was young myself. Her mother\r\nand my mother were first cousins and dear friends." He held her hand\r\nas he spoke and looked at her as though he meant to love her. Lady\r\nMabel saw that it was so. Could it be possible that the Duke had\r\nheard anything;--that he should wish to receive her? She had told\r\nherself and had told Miss Cassewary that though she had spared\r\nSilverbridge, yet she knew that she would make him a good wife. If\r\nthe Duke thought so also, then surely she need not doubt.\r\n\r\n"I knew we were cousins," she said, "and have been so proud of the\r\nconnection! Lord Silverbridge does come and see us sometimes."\r\n\r\nSoon after that Silverbridge and Popplecourt came in. If the story of\r\nthe old woman in the portrait may be taken as evidence of a family\r\nconnexion between Lady Cantrip and Lord Popplecourt, everybody there\r\nwas more or less connected with everybody else. Nidderdale had been a\r\nfirst cousin of Lady Glencora, and he had married a daughter of Lady\r\nCantrip. They were manifestly a family party,--thanks to the old\r\nwoman in the picture.\r\n\r\nIt is a point of conscience among the--perhaps not ten thousand, but\r\nsay one thousand of bluest blood,--that everybody should know who\r\neverybody is. Our Duke, though he had not given his mind much to the\r\npursuit, had nevertheless learned his lesson. It is a knowledge which\r\nthe possession of the blue blood itself produces. There are countries\r\nwith bluer blood than our own in which to be without such knowledge\r\nis a crime.\r\n\r\nWhen the old lady in the portrait had been discussed, Popplecourt was\r\nclose to Lady Mary. They two had no idea why such vicinity had been\r\nplanned. The Duke knew, of course, and Lady Cantrip. Lady Cantrip had\r\nwhispered to her daughter that such a marriage would be suitable, and\r\nthe daughter had hinted it to her husband. Lord Cantrip of course was\r\nnot in the dark. Lady Mabel had expressed a hint on the matter to\r\nMiss Cass, who had not repudiated it. Even Silverbridge had suggested\r\nto himself that something of the kind might be in the wind, thinking\r\nthat, if so, none of them knew much about his sister Mary. But\r\nPopplecourt himself was divinely innocent. His ideas of marriage had\r\nas yet gone no farther than a conviction that girls generally were\r\nthings which would be pressed on him, and against which he must arm\r\nhimself with some shield. Marriage would have to come, no doubt; but\r\nnot the less was it his duty to live as though it were a pit towards\r\nwhich he would be tempted by female allurements. But that a net\r\nshould be spread over him here he was much too humble-minded to\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\n"Very hot," he said to Lady Mary.\r\n\r\n"We found it warm in church to-day."\r\n\r\n"I dare say. I came down here with your brother in his hansom cab.\r\nWhat a very odd thing to have a hansom cab!"\r\n\r\n"I should like one."\r\n\r\n"Should you indeed?"\r\n\r\n"Particularly if I could drive it myself. Silverbridge does, at\r\nnight, when he thinks people won\'t see him."\r\n\r\n"Drive the cab in the streets! What does he do with his man?"\r\n\r\n"Puts him inside. He was out once without the man and took up a\r\nfare,--an old woman, he said. And when she was going to pay him he\r\ntouched his hat and said he never took money from ladies."\r\n\r\n"Do you believe that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. I call that good fun, because it did no harm. He had his\r\nlark. The lady was taken where she wanted to go, and she saved her\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"Suppose he had upset her," said Lord Popplecourt, looking as an old\r\nphilosopher might have looked when he had found some clenching answer\r\nto another philosopher\'s argument.\r\n\r\n"The real cabman might have upset her worse," said Lady Mary.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you feel it odd that we should meet here?" said Lord\r\nSilverbridge to his neighbour, Lady Mabel.\r\n\r\n"Anything unexpected is odd," said Lady Mabel. It seemed to her to be\r\nvery odd,--unless certain people had made up their minds as to the\r\nexpediency of a certain event.\r\n\r\n"That is what you call logic;--isn\'t it? Anything unexpected is odd!"\r\n\r\n"Lord Silverbridge, I won\'t be laughed at. You have been at Oxford\r\nand ought to know what logic is."\r\n\r\n"That at any rate is ill-natured," he replied, turning very red in\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think I meant it. Oh, Lord Silverbridge, say that you\r\ndon\'t think I meant it. You cannot think I would willingly wound\r\nyou. Indeed, indeed, I was not thinking." It had in truth been\r\nan accident. She could not speak aloud because they were closely\r\nsurrounded by others, but she looked up in his face to see whether\r\nhe were angry with her. "Say that you do not think I meant it."\r\n\r\n"I do not think you meant it."\r\n\r\n"I would not say a word to hurt you,--oh, for more than I can tell\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"It is all bosh, of course," he said laughing; "but I do not like to\r\nhear the old place named. I have always made a fool of myself. Some\r\nmen do it and don\'t care about it. But I do it, and yet it makes me\r\nmiserable."\r\n\r\n"If that be so you will soon give over making--what you call a fool\r\nof yourself. For myself I like the idea of wild oats. I look upon\r\nthem like measles. Only you should have a doctor ready when the\r\ndisease shows itself."\r\n\r\n"What sort of a doctor ought I to have?"\r\n\r\n"Ah;--you must find out that yourself. That sort of feeling which\r\nmakes you feel miserable;--that is a doctor itself."\r\n\r\n"Or a wife?"\r\n\r\n"Or a wife,--if you can find a good one. There are wives, you know,\r\nwho aggravate the disease. If I had a fast husband I should make him\r\nfaster by being fast myself. There is nothing I envy so much as the\r\npower of doing half-mad things."\r\n\r\n"Women can do that too."\r\n\r\n"But they go to the dogs. We are dreadfully restricted. If you like\r\nchampagne you can have a bucketful. I am obliged to pretend that I\r\nonly want a very little. You can bet thousands. I must confine myself\r\nto gloves. You can flirt with any woman you please. I must wait till\r\nsomebody comes,--and put up with it if nobody does come."\r\n\r\n"Plenty come, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"But I want to pick and choose. A man turns the girls over one after\r\nanother as one does the papers when one is fitting up a room, or\r\nrolls them out as one rolls out the carpets. A very careful young man\r\nlike Lord Popplecourt might reject a young woman because her hair\r\ndidn\'t suit the colour of his furniture."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that I shall choose my wife as I would papers and\r\ncarpets."\r\n\r\nThe Duke, who sat between Lady Cantrip and her daughter, did\r\nhis best to make himself agreeable. The conversation had been\r\nsemi-political,--political to the usual feminine extent, and had\r\nconsisted chiefly of sarcasms from Lady Cantrip against Sir Timothy\r\nBeeswax. "That England should put up with such a man," Lady Cantrip\r\nhad said, "is to me shocking! There used to be a feeling in favour\r\nof gentlemen." To this the Duke had responded by asserting that Sir\r\nTimothy had displayed great aptitude for parliamentary life, and\r\nknew the House of Commons better than most men. He said nothing\r\nagainst his foe, and very much in his foe\'s praise. But Lady Cantrip\r\nperceived that she had succeeded in pleasing him.\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies were gone the politics became more serious. "That\r\nunfortunate quarrel is to go on the same as ever, I suppose," said\r\nthe Duke, addressing himself to the two young men who had seats in\r\nthe House of Commons. They were both on the Conservative side in\r\npolitics. The three peers present were all Liberals.\r\n\r\n"Till next Session, I think, sir," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Sir Timothy, though he did lose his temper, has managed it well,"\r\nsaid Lord Cantrip.\r\n\r\n"Phineas Finn lost his temper worse than Sir Timothy," said Lord\r\nNidderdale.\r\n\r\n"But yet I think he had the feeling of the House with him," said the\r\nDuke. "I happened to be present in the gallery at the time."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Nidderdale, "because he \'owned up.\' The fact is if you\r\n\'own up\' in a genial sort of way the House will forgive anything. If\r\nI were to murder my grandmother, and when questioned about it were to\r\nacknowledge that I had done it--" Then Lord Nidderdale stood up and\r\nmade his speech as he might have made it in the House of Commons. "\'I\r\nregret to say, sir, that the old woman did get in my way when I was\r\nin a passion. Unfortunately I had a heavy stick in my hand and I\r\ndid strike her over the head. Nobody can regret it so much as I do!\r\nNobody can feel so acutely the position in which I am placed! I have\r\nsat in this House for many years, and many gentlemen know me well. I\r\nthink, Sir, that they will acknowledge that I am a man not deficient\r\nin filial piety or general humanity. Sir, I am sorry for what I did\r\nin a moment of heat. I have now spoken the truth, and I shall leave\r\nmyself in the hands of the House.\' My belief is I should get such a\r\nround of applause as I certainly shall never achieve in any other\r\nway. It is not only that a popular man may do it,--like Phineas\r\nFinn,--but the most unpopular man in the House may make himself liked\r\nby owning freely that he has done something that he ought to be\r\nashamed of." Nidderdale\'s unwonted eloquence was received in good\r\npart by the assembled legislators.\r\n\r\n"Taking it altogether," said the Duke, "I know of no assembly in\r\nany country in which good-humour prevails so generally, in which\r\nthe members behave to each other so well, in which rules are so\r\nuniversally followed, or in which the president is so thoroughly\r\nsustained by the feeling of the members."\r\n\r\n"I hear men say that it isn\'t quite what it used to be," said\r\nSilverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Nothing will ever be quite what it used to be."\r\n\r\n"Changes for the worse, I mean. Men are doing all kinds of things,\r\njust because the rules of the House allow them."\r\n\r\n"If they be within rule," said the Duke, "I don\'t know who is to\r\nblame them. In my time, if any man stretched a rule too far the House\r\nwould not put up with it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it," said Nidderdale. "The House puts up with anything\r\nnow. There is a great deal of good feeling no doubt, but there\'s no\r\nearnestness about anything. I think you are more earnest than we; but\r\nthen you are such horrid bores. And each earnest man is in earnest\r\nabout something that nobody else cares for."\r\n\r\nWhen they were again in the drawing-room, Lord Popplecourt was seated\r\nnext to Lady Mary. "Where are you going this autumn?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know in the least. Papa said something about going abroad."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t be at Custins?" Custins was Lord Cantrip\'s country seat in\r\nDorsetshire.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about myself as yet. But I don\'t think I shall go\r\nanywhere unless papa goes too."\r\n\r\n"Lady Cantrip has asked me to be at Custins in the middle of October.\r\nThey say it is about the best pheasant-shooting in England."\r\n\r\n"Do you shoot much?"\r\n\r\n"A great deal. I shall be in Scotland on the Twelfth. I and Reginald\r\nDobbes have a place together. I shall get to my own partridges on the\r\n1st of September. I always manage that. Popplecourt is in Suffolk,\r\nand I don\'t think any man in England can beat me for partridges."\r\n\r\n"What do you do with all you slay?"\r\n\r\n"Leadenhall Market. I make it pay,--or very nearly. Then I shall run\r\nback to Scotland for the end of the stalking, and I can easily manage\r\nto be at Custins by the middle of October. I never touch my own\r\npheasants till November."\r\n\r\n"Why are you so abstemious?"\r\n\r\n"The birds are heavier and it answers better. But if I thought you\r\nwould be at Custins it would be much nicer." Lady Mary again told him\r\nthat as yet she knew nothing of her father\'s autumn movements.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time the Duke was arranging his autumn movements, or\r\nat any rate those of his daughter. Lady Cantrip had told him that the\r\ndesirable son-in-law had promised to go to Custins, and suggested\r\nthat he and Mary should also be there. In his daughter\'s name he\r\npromised, but he would not bind himself. Would it not be better that\r\nhe should be absent? Now that the doing of this thing was brought\r\nnearer to him so that he could see and feel its details, he was\r\ndisgusted by it. And yet it had answered so well with his wife!\r\n\r\n"Is Lord Popplecourt intimate here?" Lady Mabel asked her friend,\r\nLord Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I am not."\r\n\r\n"Lady Cantrip seems to think a great deal about him."\r\n\r\n"I dare say. I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Your father seems to like him."\r\n\r\n"That\'s possible too. They\'re going back to London together in the\r\ngovernor\'s carriage. My father will talk high politics all the way,\r\nand Popplecourt will agree with everything."\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t intended to--to--? You know what I mean."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say that I do."\r\n\r\n"To cut out poor Frank."\r\n\r\n"It\'s quite possible."\r\n\r\n"Poor Frank!"\r\n\r\n"You had a great deal better say poor Popplecourt!--or poor governor,\r\nor poor Lady Cantrip."\r\n\r\n"But a hundred countesses can\'t make your sister marry a man she\r\ndoesn\'t like."\r\n\r\n"Just that. They don\'t go the right way about it."\r\n\r\n"What would you do?"\r\n\r\n"Leave her alone. Let her find out gradually that what she wants\r\ncan\'t be done."\r\n\r\n"And so linger on for years," said Lady Mabel reproachfully.\r\n\r\n"I say nothing about that. The man is my friend."\r\n\r\n"And you ought to be proud of him."\r\n\r\n"I never knew anybody yet that was proud of his friends. I like him\r\nwell enough, but I can quite understand that the governor should\r\nobject."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we all know that," said she sadly.\r\n\r\n"What would your father say if you wanted to marry someone who hadn\'t\r\na shilling?"\r\n\r\n"I should object myself,--without waiting for my father. But\r\nthen,--neither have I a shilling. If I had money, do you think I\r\nwouldn\'t like to give it to the man I loved?"\r\n\r\n"But this is a case of giving somebody else\'s money. They won\'t make\r\nher give it up by bringing such a young ass as that down here. If my\r\nfather has persistency enough to let her cry her eyes out, he\'ll\r\nsucceed."\r\n\r\n"And break her heart. Could you do that?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. But then I\'m soft. I can\'t refuse."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Not if the person who asks me is in my good books. You try me."\r\n\r\n"What shall I ask for?"\r\n\r\n"Anything."\r\n\r\n"Give me that ring off your finger," she said. He at once took it\r\noff his hand. "Of course you know I am in joke. You don\'t imagine\r\nthat I would take it from you?" He still held it towards her. "Lord\r\nSilverbridge, I expect that with you I may say a foolish word without\r\nbeing brought to sorrow by it. I know that that ring belonged to your\r\ngreat-uncle,--and to fifty Pallisers before."\r\n\r\n"What would it matter?"\r\n\r\n"And it would be wholly useless to me, as I could not wear it."\r\n\r\n"Of course it would be too big," said he, replacing the ring on his\r\nown finger. "But when I talk of any one being in my good books, I\r\ndon\'t mean a thing like that. Don\'t you know there is nobody on earth\r\nI--" there he paused and blushed, and she sat motionless, looking at\r\nhim expecting, with her colour too somewhat raised,--"whom I like so\r\nwell as I do you?" It was a lame conclusion. She felt it to be lame.\r\nBut as regarded him, the lameness at the moment had come from a\r\ntimidity which forbade him to say the word "love" even though he had\r\nmeant to say it.\r\n\r\nShe recovered herself instantly. "I do believe it," she said. "I do\r\nthink that we are real friends."\r\n\r\n"Would you not take a ring from a--real friend?"\r\n\r\n"Not that ring;--nor a ring at all after I had asked for it in\r\njoke. You understand it all. But to go back to what we were talking\r\nabout,--if you can do anything for Frank, pray do. You know it will\r\nbreak her heart. A man of course bears it better, but he does not\r\nperhaps suffer the less. It is all his life to him. He can do nothing\r\nwhile this is going on. Are you not true enough to your friendship to\r\nexert yourself for him?" Silverbridge put his hand up and rubbed his\r\nhead as though he were vexed. "Your aid would turn everything in his\r\nfavour."\r\n\r\n"You do not know my father."\r\n\r\n"Is he so inexorable?"\r\n\r\n"It is not that, Mabel. But he is so unhappy. I cannot add to his\r\nunhappiness by taking part against him."\r\n\r\nIn another part of the room Lady Cantrip was busy with Lord\r\nPopplecourt. She had talked about pheasants, and had talked about\r\ngrouse, had talked about moving the address in the House of Lords in\r\nsome coming Session, and the great value of political alliances early\r\nin life, till the young peer began to think that Lady Cantrip was the\r\nnicest of women. Then after a short pause she changed the subject.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think Lady Mary very beautiful?"\r\n\r\n"Uncommon," said his Lordship.\r\n\r\n"And her manners so perfect. She has all her mother\'s ease without\r\nany of that-- You know what I mean."\r\n\r\n"Quite so," said his Lordship.\r\n\r\n"And then she has got so much in her."\r\n\r\n"Has she though?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know any girl of her age so thoroughly well educated. The\r\nDuke seems to take to you."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes;--the Duke is very kind."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think--?"\r\n\r\n"Eh!"\r\n\r\n"You have heard of her mother\'s fortune?"\r\n\r\n"Tremendous!"\r\n\r\n"She will have, I take it, quite a third of it. Whatever I say I\'m\r\nsure you will take in confidence; but she is a dear dear girl; and I\r\nam anxious for her happiness almost as though she belonged to me."\r\n\r\nLord Popplecourt went back to town in the Duke\'s carriage, but was\r\nunable to say a word about politics. His mind was altogether filled\r\nwith the wonderful words that had been spoken to him. Could it be\r\nthat Lady Mary had fallen violently in love with him? He would not\r\nat once give himself up to the pleasing idea, having so thoroughly\r\ngrounded himself in the belief that female nets were to be avoided.\r\nBut when he got home he did think favourably of it. The daughter of\r\na Duke,--and such a Duke! So lovely a girl, and with such gifts! And\r\nthen a fortune which would make a material addition to his own large\r\nproperty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTally-Ho Lodge\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all know that very clever distich concerning the great fleas and\r\nthe little fleas which tells us that no animal is too humble to have\r\nits parasite. Even Major Tifto had his inferior friend. This was\r\na certain Captain Green,--for the friend also affected military\r\nhonours. He was a man somewhat older than Tifto, of whose antecedents\r\nno one was supposed to know anything. It was presumed of him that he\r\nlived by betting, and it was boasted by those who wished to defend\r\nhis character that when he lost he paid his money like a gentleman.\r\nTifto during the last year or two had been anxious to support Captain\r\nGreen, and had always made use of this argument: "Where the d---- he\r\ngets his money I don\'t know;--but when he loses, there it is."\r\n\r\nMajor Tifto had a little "box" of his own in the neighbourhood of\r\nEgham, at which he had a set of stables a little bigger than his\r\nhouse, and a set of kennels a little bigger than his stables. It was\r\nhere he kept his horses and hounds, and himself too when business\r\nconnected with his sporting life did not take him to town. It was\r\nnow the middle of August and he had come to Tally-ho Lodge, there to\r\nlook after his establishments, to make arrangements for cub-hunting,\r\nand to prepare for the autumn racing campaign. On this occasion\r\nCaptain Green was enjoying his hospitality and assisting him by sage\r\ncounsels. Behind the little box was a little garden,--a garden that\r\nwas very little; but, still, thus close to the parlour window, there\r\nwas room for a small table to be put on the grass-plat, and for a\r\ncouple of armchairs. Here the Major and the Captain were seated\r\nabout eight o\'clock one evening, with convivial good things within\r\ntheir reach. The good things were gin-and-water and pipes. The two\r\ngentlemen had not dressed strictly for dinner. They had spent a great\r\npart of the day handling the hounds and the horses, dressing wounds,\r\ncuring sores, and ministering to canine ailments, and had been\r\ndetained over their work too long to think of their toilet. As it\r\nwas they had an eye to business. The stables at one corner and the\r\nkennels at the other were close to the little garden, and the doings\r\nof a man and a boy who were still at work among the animals could be\r\ndirected from the armchairs on which the two sportsmen were sitting.\r\n\r\nIt must be explained that ever since the Silverbridge election\r\nthere had been a growing feeling in Tifto\'s mind that he had been\r\nill-treated by his partner. The feeling was strengthened by the\r\nadmirable condition of Prime Minister. Surely more consideration had\r\nbeen due to a man who had produced such a state of things!\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t quarrel with him, but I\'d make him pay his way," said the\r\nprudent Captain.\r\n\r\n"As for that, of course he does pay--his share."\r\n\r\n"Who does all the work?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s true."\r\n\r\n"The fact is, Tifto, you don\'t make enough out of it. When a small\r\nman like you has to deal with a big man like that, he may take it out\r\nof him in one of two ways. But he must be deuced clever if he can get\r\nit both ways."\r\n\r\n"What are you driving at?" asked Tifto, who did not like being called\r\na small man, feeling himself to be every inch a Master of foxhounds.\r\n\r\n"Why, this!--Look at that d---- fellow fretting that \'orse with a\r\nswitch. If you can\'t strap a \'orse without a stick in your hand,\r\ndon\'t you strap him at all, you--" Then there came a volley of abuse\r\nout of the Captain\'s mouth, in the middle of which the man threw down\r\nthe rubber he was using and walked away.\r\n\r\n"You come back," halloed Tifto, jumping up from his seat with his\r\npipe in his mouth. Then there was a general quarrel between the man\r\nand his two masters, in which the man at last was victorious. And the\r\nhorse was taken into the stable in an unfinished condition. "It\'s\r\nall very well to say \'Get rid of him,\' but where am I to get anybody\r\nbetter? It has come to such a pass that now if you speak to a fellow\r\nhe walks out of the yard."\r\n\r\nThey then returned to the state of affairs, as it was between Tifto\r\nand Lord Silverbridge. "What I was saying is this," continued the\r\nCaptain. "If you choose to put yourself up to live with a fellow like\r\nthat on equal terms--"\r\n\r\n"One gentleman with another, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Put it so. It don\'t quite hit it off, but put it so. Why then you\r\nget your wages when you take his arm and call him Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want wages from any man," said the indignant Major.\r\n\r\n"That comes from not knowing what wages is. I do want wages. If I\r\ndo a thing I like to be paid for it. You are paid for it after one\r\nfashion, I prefer the other."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean he should give me--a salary?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d have it out of him some way. What\'s the good of young chaps of\r\nthat sort if they aren\'t made to pay? You\'ve got this young swell in\r\ntow. He\'s going to be about the richest man in England;--and what the\r\ndeuce better are you for it?" Tifto sat meditating, thinking of the\r\nwisdom which was being spoken. The same ideas had occurred to him.\r\nThe happy chance which had made him intimate with Lord Silverbridge\r\nhad not yet enriched him. "What is the good of chaps of that sort if\r\nthey are not made to pay?" The words were wise words. But yet how\r\nglorious he had been when he was elected at the Beargarden, and had\r\nentered the club as the special friend of the heir of the Duke of\r\nOmnium.\r\n\r\nAfter a short pause, Captain Green pursued his discourse. "You said\r\nsalary."\r\n\r\n"I did mention the word."\r\n\r\n"Salary and wages is one. A salary is a nice thing if it\'s paid\r\nregular. I had a salary once myself for looking after a stud of\r\n\'orses at Newmarket, only the gentleman broke up and it never went\r\nvery far."\r\n\r\n"Was that Marley Bullock?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; that was Marley Bullock. He\'s abroad somewhere now with nothing\r\na year paid quarterly to live on. I think he does a little at cards.\r\nHe\'d had a good bit of money once, but most of it was gone when he\r\ncame my way."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t make by him?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t lose nothing. I didn\'t have a lot of \'orses under me\r\nwithout getting something out of it."\r\n\r\n"What am I to do?" asked Tifto. "I can sell him a horse now and\r\nagain. But if I give him anything good there isn\'t much to come out\r\nof that."\r\n\r\n"Very little I should say. Don\'t he put his money on his \'orses?"\r\n\r\n"Not very free. I think he\'s coming out freer now."\r\n\r\n"What did he stand to win on the Derby?"\r\n\r\n"A thousand or two perhaps."\r\n\r\n"There may be something got handsome out of that," said the Captain,\r\nnot venturing to allow his voice to rise above a whisper. Major Tifto\r\nlooked hard at him but said nothing. "Of course you must see your\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite understand."\r\n\r\n"Race \'orses are expensive animals,--and races generally is\r\nexpensive."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true."\r\n\r\n"When so much is dropped, somebody has to pick it up. That\'s what\r\nI\'ve always said to myself. I\'m as honest as another man."\r\n\r\n"That\'s of course," said the Major civilly.\r\n\r\n"But if I don\'t keep my mouth shut, somebody \'ll have my teeth out of\r\nmy head. Every one for himself and God for us all. I suppose there\'s\r\na deal of money flying about. He\'ll put a lot of money on this \'orse\r\nof yours for the Leger if he\'s managed right. There\'s more to be got\r\nout of that than calling him Silverbridge and walking arm-in-arm.\r\nBusiness is business. I don\'t know whether I make myself understood."\r\n\r\nThe gentleman did not quite make himself understood; but Tifto\r\nendeavoured to read the riddle. He must in some way make money out of\r\nhis friend Lord Silverbridge. Hitherto he had contented himself with\r\nthe brilliancy of the connection; but now his brilliant friend had\r\ntaken to snubbing him, and had on more than one occasion made himself\r\ndisagreeable. It seemed to him that Captain Green counselled him to\r\nput up with that, but counselled him at the same time to--pick up\r\nsome of his friend\'s money. He didn\'t think that he could ask Lord\r\nSilverbridge for a salary--he who was a Master of Fox-hounds, and a\r\nmember of the Beargarden. Then his friend had suggested something\r\nabout the young lord\'s bets. He was endeavouring to unriddle all this\r\nwith a brain that was already somewhat muddled with alcohol, when\r\nCaptain Green got up from his chair and standing over the Major spoke\r\nhis last words for that night as from an oracle. "Square is all very\r\nwell, as long as others are square to you;--but when they aren\'t,\r\nthen I say square be d----. Square! what comes of it? Work your heart\r\nout, and then it\'s no good."\r\n\r\nThe Major thought about it much that night, and was thinking about it\r\nstill when he awoke on the next morning. He would like to make Lord\r\nSilverbridge pay for his late insolence. It would answer his purpose\r\nto make a little money,--as he told himself,--in any honest way.\r\nAt the present moment he was in want of money, and on looking into\r\nhis affairs declared to himself that he had certainly impoverished\r\nhimself by his devotion to Lord Silverbridge\'s interests. At\r\nbreakfast on the following morning he endeavoured to bring his friend\r\nback to the subject. But the Captain was cross, rather than oracular.\r\n"Everybody," he said, "ought to know his own business. He wasn\'t\r\ngoing to meddle or make. What he had said had been taken amiss." This\r\nwas hard upon Tifto, who had taken nothing amiss.\r\n\r\n"Square be d----!" There was a great deal in the lesson there\r\nenunciated which demanded consideration. Hitherto the Major had\r\nfought his battles with a certain adherence to squareness. If his\r\nangles had not all been perfect angles, still there had always been\r\nan attempt at geometrical accuracy. He might now and again have\r\ntold a lie about a horse--but who that deals in horses has not done\r\nthat? He had been alive to the value of underhand information from\r\nracing-stables, but who won\'t use a tip if he can get it? He had lied\r\nabout the expense of his hounds, in order to enhance the subscription\r\nof his members. Those were things which everybody did in his line.\r\nBut Green had meant something beyond this.\r\n\r\nAs far as he could see out in the world at large, nobody was square.\r\nYou had to keep your mouth shut, or your teeth would be stolen out of\r\nit. He didn\'t look into a paper without seeing that on all sides of\r\nhim men had abandoned the idea of squareness. Chairmen, directors,\r\nmembers of Parliament, ambassadors,--all the world, as he told\r\nhimself,--were trying to get on by their wits. He didn\'t see why he\r\nshould be more square than anybody else. Why hadn\'t Silverbridge\r\ntaken him down to Scotland for the grouse?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nGrex\r\n\r\n\r\nFar away from all known places, in the northern limit of the Craven\r\ndistrict, on the borders of Westmorland but in Yorkshire, there\r\nstands a large, rambling, most picturesque old house called Grex. The\r\npeople around call it the Castle, but it is not a castle. It is an\r\nold brick building supposed to have been erected in the days of James\r\nthe First, having oriel windows, twisted chimneys, long galleries,\r\ngable ends, a quadrangle of which the house surrounds three sides,\r\nterraces, sun-dials, and fish-ponds. But it is so sadly out of repair\r\nas to be altogether unfit for the residence of a gentleman and his\r\nfamily. It stands not in a park, for the land about it is divided\r\ninto paddocks by low stone walls, but in the midst of lovely scenery,\r\nthe ground rising all round it in low irregular hills or fells, and\r\nclose to it, a quarter of a mile from the back of the house, there is\r\na small dark lake, not serenely lovely as are some of the lakes in\r\nWestmorland, but attractive by the darkness of its waters and the\r\ngloom of the woods around it.\r\n\r\nThis is the country seat of Earl Grex,--which however he had not\r\nvisited for some years. Gradually the place had got into such a\r\ncondition that his absence is not surprising. An owner of Grex, with\r\nlarge means at his disposal and with a taste for the picturesque\r\nto gratify,--one who could afford to pay for memories and who was\r\nwilling to pay dearly for such luxuries, might no doubt restore Grex.\r\nBut the Earl had neither the money nor the taste.\r\n\r\nLord Grex had latterly never gone near the place, nor was his son\r\nLord Percival fond of looking upon the ruin of his property. But Lady\r\nMabel loved it with a fond love. With all her lightness of spirit she\r\nwas prone to memories, prone to melancholy, prone at times almost to\r\nseek the gratification of sorrow. Year after year when the London\r\nseason was over she would come down to Grex and spend a week or two\r\namidst its desolation. She was now going on to a seat in Scotland\r\nbelonging to Mrs. Montacute Jones called Killancodlem; but she was in\r\nthe meanwhile passing a desolate fortnight at Grex in company with\r\nMiss Cassewary. The gardens were let,--and being let of course were\r\nnot kept in further order than as profit might require. The man who\r\nrented them lived in the big house with his wife, and they on such\r\noccasions as this would cook and wait upon Lady Mabel.\r\n\r\nLady Mabel was at the home of her ancestors, and the faithful Miss\r\nCass was with her. But at the moment and at the spot at which the\r\nreader shall see her, Miss Cass was not with her. She was sitting on\r\na rock about twelve feet above the lake looking upon the black water;\r\nand on another rock a few feet from her was seated Frank Tregear.\r\n"No," she said, "you should not have come. Nothing can justify it. Of\r\ncourse as you are here I could not refuse to come out with you. To\r\nmake a fuss about it would be the worst of all. But you should not\r\nhave come."\r\n\r\n"Why not? Whom does it hurt? It is a pleasure to me. If it be the\r\nreverse to you, I will go."\r\n\r\n"Men are so unmanly. They take such mean advantages. You know it is a\r\npleasure to me to see you."\r\n\r\n"I had hoped so."\r\n\r\n"But it is a pleasure I ought not to have,--at least not here."\r\n\r\n"That is what I do not understand," said he. "In London, where the\r\nEarl could bark at me if he happened to find me, I could see the\r\ninconvenience of it. But here, where there is nobody but Miss Cass--"\r\n\r\n"There are a great many others. There are the rooks, and stones, and\r\nold women;--all of which have ears."\r\n\r\n"But of what is there to be ashamed? There is nothing in the world to\r\nme so pleasant as the companionship of my friends."\r\n\r\n"Then go after Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"I mean to do so;--but I am taking you by the way."\r\n\r\n"It is all unmanly," she said, rising from her stone; "you know\r\nthat it is so. Friends! Do you mean to say that it would make no\r\ndifference whether you were here with me or with Miss Cass?"\r\n\r\n"The greatest difference in the world."\r\n\r\n"Because she is an old woman and I am a young one, and because in\r\nintercourse between young men and young women there is something\r\ndangerous to the women and therefore pleasant to the men."\r\n\r\n"I never heard anything more unjust. You cannot think I desire\r\nanything injurious to you."\r\n\r\n"I do think so." She was still standing and spoke now with great\r\nvehemence. "I do think so. You force me to throw aside the reticence\r\nI ought to keep. Would it help me in my prospects if your friend Lord\r\nSilverbridge knew that I was here?"\r\n\r\n"How should he know?"\r\n\r\n"But if he did? Do you suppose that I want to have visits paid to me\r\nof which I am afraid to speak? Would you dare to tell Lady Mary that\r\nyou had been sitting alone with me on the rocks at Grex?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I would."\r\n\r\n"Then it would be because you have not dared to tell her certain\r\nother things which have gone before. You have sworn to her no doubt\r\nthat you love her better than all the world."\r\n\r\n"I have."\r\n\r\n"And you have taken the trouble to come here to tell me that,--to\r\nwound me to the core by saying so; to show me that, though I may\r\nstill be sick, you have recovered,--that is if you ever suffered! Go\r\nyour way and let me go mine. I do not want you."\r\n\r\n"Mabel!"\r\n\r\n"I do not want you. I know you will not help me, but you need not\r\ndestroy me."\r\n\r\n"You know that you are wronging me."\r\n\r\n"No! You understand it all though you look so calm. I hate your Lady\r\nMary Palliser. There! But if by anything I could do I could secure\r\nher to you I would do it,--because you want it."\r\n\r\n"She will be your sister-in-law,--probably."\r\n\r\n"Never. It will never be so."\r\n\r\n"Why do you hate her?"\r\n\r\n"There again! You are so little of a man that you can ask me why!"\r\nThen she turned away as though she intended to go down to the marge\r\nof the lake.\r\n\r\nBut he rose up and stopped her. "Let us have this out, Mabel, before\r\nwe go," he said. "Unmanly is a heavy word to hear from you, and you\r\nhave used it a dozen times."\r\n\r\n"It is because I have thought it a thousand times. Go and get her if\r\nyou can;--but why tell me about it?"\r\n\r\n"You said you would help me."\r\n\r\n"So I would, as I would help you do anything you might want; but you\r\ncan hardly think that after what has passed I can wish to hear about\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"It was you spoke of her."\r\n\r\n"I told you you should not be here,--because of her and because of\r\nme. And I tell you again, I hate her. Do you think I can hear you\r\nspeak of her as though she were the only woman you had ever seen\r\nwithout feeling it? Did you ever swear that you loved any one else?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, I have so sworn."\r\n\r\n"Have you ever said that nothing could alter that love?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I have."\r\n\r\n"But it is altered. It has all gone. It has been transferred to one\r\nwho has more advantages of beauty, youth, wealth, and position."\r\n\r\n"Oh Mabel, Mabel!"\r\n\r\n"But it is so."\r\n\r\n"When you say this do you not think of yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. But I have never been false to any one. You are false to me."\r\n\r\n"Have I not offered to face all the world with you?"\r\n\r\n"You would not offer it now?"\r\n\r\n"No," he said, after a pause,--"not now. Were I to do so, I should be\r\nfalse. You bade me take my love elsewhere, and I did so."\r\n\r\n"With the greatest ease."\r\n\r\n"We agreed it should be so; and you have done the same."\r\n\r\n"That is false. Look me in the face and tell me whether you do not\r\nknow it to be false!"\r\n\r\n"And yet I am told that I am injuring you with Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"Oh,--so unmanly again! Of course I have to marry. Who does not know\r\nit? Do you want to see me begging my bread about the streets? You\r\nhave bread; or if not, you might earn it. If you marry for money--"\r\n\r\n"The accusation is altogether unjustifiable."\r\n\r\n"Allow me to finish what I have to say. If you marry for money you\r\nwill do that which is in itself bad, and which is also unnecessary.\r\nWhat other course would you recommend me to take? No one goes into\r\nthe gutter while there is a clean path open. If there be no escape\r\nbut through the gutter, one has to take it."\r\n\r\n"You mean that my duty to you should have kept me from marrying all\r\nmy life."\r\n\r\n"Not that;--but a little while, Frank; just a little while. Your\r\nbloom is not fading; your charms are not running from you. Have you\r\nnot a strength which I cannot have? Do you not feel that you are a\r\ntree, standing firm in the ground, while I am a bit of ivy that will\r\nbe trodden in the dirt unless it can be made to cling to something?\r\nYou should not liken yourself to me, Frank."\r\n\r\n"If I could do you any good!"\r\n\r\n"Good! What is the meaning of good? If you love, it is good to be\r\nloved again. It is good not to have your heart torn in pieces. You\r\nknow that I love you." He was standing close to her, and put out\r\nhis hand as though he would twine his arm round her waist. "Not for\r\nworlds," she said. "It belongs to that Palliser girl. And as I have\r\ntaught myself to think that what there is left of me may perhaps\r\nbelong to some other one, worthless as it is, I will keep it for him.\r\nI love you,--but there can be none of that softness of love between\r\nus." Then there was a pause, but as he did not speak she went on.\r\n"But remember, Frank,--our position is not equal. You have got over\r\nyour little complaint. It probably did not go deep with you, and you\r\nhave found a cure. Perhaps there is a satisfaction in finding that\r\ntwo young women love you."\r\n\r\n"You are trying to be cruel to me."\r\n\r\n"Why else should you be here? You know I love you,--with all my\r\nheart, with all my strength, and that I would give the world to cure\r\nmyself. Knowing this, you come and talk to me of your passion for\r\nthis other girl."\r\n\r\n"I had hoped we might both talk rationally as friends."\r\n\r\n"Friends! Frank Tregear, I have been bold enough to tell you I love\r\nyou; but you are not my friend, and cannot be my friend. If I have\r\nbefore asked you to help me in this mean catastrophe of mine, in my\r\nattack upon that poor boy, I withdraw my request. I think I will go\r\nback to the house now."\r\n\r\n"I will walk back to Ledburgh if you wish it without going to the\r\nhouse again."\r\n\r\n"No; I will have nothing that looks like being ashamed. You ought not\r\nto have come, but you need not run away." Then they walked back to\r\nthe house together and found Miss Cassewary on the terrace. "We have\r\nbeen to the lake," said Mabel, "and have been talking of old days.\r\nI have but one ambition now in the world." Of course Miss Cassewary\r\nasked what the remaining ambition was. "To get money enough to\r\npurchase this place from the ruins of the Grex property. If I could\r\nown the house and the lake, and the paddocks about, and had enough\r\nincome to keep one servant and bread for us to eat--of course\r\nincluding you, Miss Cass--"\r\n\r\n"Thank\'ee, my dear; but I am not sure I should like it."\r\n\r\n"Yes; you would. Frank would come and see us perhaps once a year. I\r\ndon\'t suppose anybody else cares about the place, but to me it is the\r\ndearest spot in the world." So she went on in almost high spirits,\r\nthough alluding to the general decadence of the Grex family, till\r\nTregear took his leave.\r\n\r\n"I wish he had not come," said Miss Cassewary when he was gone.\r\n\r\n"Why should you wish that? There is not so much here to amuse me that\r\nyou should begrudge me a stray visitor."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that I grudge you anything in the way of pleasure,\r\nmy dear; but still he should not have come. My Lord, if he knew it,\r\nwould be angry."\r\n\r\n"Then let him be angry. Papa does not do so much for me that I am\r\nbound to think of him at every turn."\r\n\r\n"But I am,--or rather I am bound to think of myself, if I take his\r\nbread."\r\n\r\n"Bread!"\r\n\r\n"Well;--I do take his bread, and I take it on the understanding that\r\nI will be to you what a mother might be,--or an aunt."\r\n\r\n"Well,--and if so! Had I a mother living would not Frank Tregear\r\nhave come to visit her, and in visiting her, would he not have seen\r\nme,--and should we not have walked out together?"\r\n\r\n"Not after all that has come and gone."\r\n\r\n"But you are not a mother nor yet an aunt, and you have to do just\r\nwhat I tell you. And don\'t I know that you trust me in all things?\r\nAnd am I not trustworthy?"\r\n\r\n"I think you are trustworthy."\r\n\r\n"I know what my duty is and I mean to do it. No one shall ever have\r\nto say of me that I have given way to self-indulgence. I couldn\'t\r\nhelp his coming, you know."\r\n\r\nThat same night, after Miss Cassewary had gone to bed, when the moon\r\nwas high in the heavens and the world around her was all asleep, Lady\r\nMabel again wandered out to the lake, and again seated herself on the\r\nsame rock, and there she sat thinking of her past life and trying to\r\nthink of that before her. It is so much easier to think of the past\r\nthan of the future,--to remember what has been than to resolve what\r\nshall be! She had reminded him of the offer which he had made and\r\nrepeated to her more than once,--to share with her all his chances in\r\nlife. There would have been almost no income for them. All the world\r\nwould have been against her. She would have caused his ruin. Her\r\nlight on the matter had been so clear that it had not taken her very\r\nlong to decide that such a thing must not be thought of. She had at\r\nlast been quite stern in her decision.\r\n\r\nNow she was broken-hearted because she found that he had left her\r\nin very truth. Oh yes;--she would marry the boy, if she could so\r\narrange. Since that meeting at Richmond he had sent her the ring\r\nreset. She was to meet him down in Scotland within a week or two from\r\nthe present time. Mrs. Montacute Jones had managed that. He had all\r\nbut offered to her a second time at Richmond. But all that would not\r\nserve to make her happy. She declared to herself that she did not\r\nwish to see Frank Tregear again; but still it was a misery to her\r\nthat his heart should in truth be given to another woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nCrummie-Toddie\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost at the last moment Silverbridge and his brother Gerald were\r\ninduced to join Lord Popplecourt\'s shooting-party in Scotland. The\r\nparty perhaps might more properly be called the party of Reginald\r\nDobbes, who was a man knowing in such matters. It was he who made\r\nthe party up. Popplecourt and Silverbridge were to share the expense\r\nbetween them, each bringing three guns. Silverbridge brought his\r\nbrother and Frank Tregear,--having refused a most piteous petition\r\non the subject from Major Tifto. With Popplecourt of course came\r\nReginald Dobbes, who was, in truth, to manage everything, and Lord\r\nNidderdale, whose wife had generously permitted him this recreation.\r\nThe shooting was in the west of Perthshire, known as Crummie-Toddie,\r\nand comprised an enormous acreage of so-called forest and moor. Mr.\r\nDobbes declared that nothing like it had as yet been produced in\r\nScotland. Everything had been made to give way to deer and grouse.\r\nThe thing had been managed so well that the tourist nuisance had been\r\nconsiderably abated. There was hardly a potato patch left in the\r\ndistrict, nor a head of cattle to be seen. There were no inhabitants\r\nremaining, or so few that they could be absorbed in game-preserving\r\nor cognate duties. Reginald Dobbes, who was very great at grouse,\r\nand supposed to be capable of outwitting a deer by venatical wiles\r\nmore perfectly than any other sportsman in Great Britain, regarded\r\nCrummie-Toddie as the nearest thing there was to a Paradise on earth.\r\nCould he have been allowed to pass one or two special laws for his\r\nown protection, there might still have been improvement. He would\r\nlike the right to have all intruders thrashed by the gillies within\r\nan inch of their lives; and he would have had a clause in his lease\r\nagainst the making of any new roads, opening of footpaths, or\r\nbuilding of bridges. He had seen somewhere in print a plan for\r\nrunning a railway from Callender to Fort Augustus right through\r\nCrummie-Toddie! If this were done in his time the beauty of the\r\nworld would be over. Reginald Dobbes was a man of about forty,\r\nstrong, active, well-made, about five feet ten in height, with broad\r\nshoulders and greatly-developed legs. He was not a handsome man,\r\nhaving a protrusive nose, high cheek-bones, and long upper lip; but\r\nthere was a manliness about his face which redeemed it. Sport was the\r\nbusiness of his life, and he thoroughly despised all who were not\r\nsportsmen. He fished and shot and hunted during nine or ten months\r\nof the year, filling up his time as best he might with coaching polo,\r\nand pigeon-shooting. He regarded it as a great duty to keep his\r\nbody in the firmest possible condition. All his eating and all his\r\ndrinking was done upon a system, and he would consider himself to\r\nbe guilty of weak self-indulgence were he to allow himself to break\r\nthrough sanitary rules. But it never occurred to him that his whole\r\nlife was one of self-indulgence. He could walk his thirty miles with\r\nhis gun on his shoulder as well now as he could ten years ago; and\r\nbeing sure of this, was thoroughly contented with himself. He had a\r\npatrimony amounting to perhaps L1000 a year, which he husbanded so as\r\nto enjoy all his amusements to perfection. No one had ever heard of\r\nhis sponging on his friends. Of money he rarely spoke, sport being\r\nin his estimation the only subject worthy of a man\'s words. Such was\r\nReginald Dobbes, who was now to be the master of the shooting at\r\nCrummie-Toddie.\r\n\r\nCrummie-Toddie was but twelve miles from Killancodlem, Mrs. Montacute\r\nJones\'s highland seat; and it was this vicinity which first induced\r\nLord Silverbridge to join the party. Mabel Grex was to be at\r\nKillancodlem, and, determined as he still was to ask her to be his\r\nwife, he would make this his opportunity. Of real opportunity there\r\nhad been none at Richmond. Since he had had his ring altered and had\r\nsent it to her there had come but a word or two of answer. "What am\r\nI to say? You unkindest of men! To keep it or to send it back would\r\nmake me equally miserable. I shall keep it till you are married, and\r\nthen give it to your wife." This affair of the ring had made him more\r\nintent than ever. After that he heard that Isabel Boncassen would\r\nalso be at Killancodlem, having been induced to join Mrs. Montacute\r\nJones\'s swarm of visitors. Though he was dangerously devoid of\r\nexperience, still he felt that this was unfortunate. He intended to\r\nmarry Mabel Grex. And he could assure himself that he thoroughly\r\nloved her. Nevertheless he liked making love to Isabel Boncassen. He\r\nwas quite willing to marry and settle down, and looked forward with\r\nsatisfaction to having Mabel Grex for his wife. But it would be\r\npleasant to have a six-months run of flirting and love-making before\r\nthis settlement, and he had certainly never seen any one with whom\r\nthis would be so delightful as with Miss Boncassen. But that the two\r\nladies should be at the same house was unfortunate.\r\n\r\nHe and Gerald reached Crummie-Toddie late on the evening of August\r\n11th, and found Reginald Dobbes alone. That was on Wednesday.\r\nPopplecourt and Nidderdale ought to have made their appearance on\r\nthat morning, but had telegraphed to say that they would be detained\r\ntwo days on their route. Tregear, whom hitherto Dobbes had never\r\nseen, had left his arrival uncertain. This carelessness on such\r\nmatters was very offensive to Mr. Dobbes, who loved discipline and\r\nexactitude. He ought to have received the two young men with open\r\narms because they were punctual; but he had been somewhat angered by\r\nwhat he considered the extreme youth of Lord Gerald. Boys who could\r\nnot shoot were, he thought, putting themselves forward before their\r\ntime. And Silverbridge himself was by no means a first-rate shot.\r\nSuch a one as Silverbridge had to be endured because from his\r\nposition and wealth he could facilitate such arrangements as these.\r\nIt was much to have to do with a man who would not complain if an\r\nextra fifty pounds were wanted. But he ought to have understood that\r\nhe was bound in honour to bring down competent friends. Of Tregear\'s\r\nshooting Dobbes had been able to learn nothing. Lord Gerald was a lad\r\nfrom the Universities; and Dobbes hated University lads. Popplecourt\r\nand Nidderdale were known to be efficient. They were men who could\r\nwork hard and do their part of the required slaughter. Dobbes proudly\r\nknew that he could make up for some deficiency by his own prowess;\r\nbut he could not struggle against three bad guns. What was the use\r\nof so perfecting Crummie-Toddie as to make it the best bit of ground\r\nfor grouse and deer in Scotland, if the men who came there failed\r\nby their own incapacity to bring up the grand total of killed to a\r\nfigure which would render Dobbes and Crummie-Toddie famous throughout\r\nthe whole shooting world? He had been hard at work on other matters.\r\nDogs had gone amiss,--or guns, and he had been made angry by the\r\nchampagne which Popplecourt caused to be sent down. He knew what\r\nchampagne meant. Whisky-and-water, and not much of it, was the liquor\r\nwhich Reginald Dobbes loved in the mountains.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you call this a very ugly country?" Silverbridge asked as soon\r\nas he arrived. Now it is the case that the traveller who travels\r\ninto Argyllshire, Perthshire, and Inverness, expects to find lovely\r\nscenery; and it was also true that the country through which they had\r\npassed for the last twenty miles had been not only bleak and barren,\r\nbut uninteresting and ugly. It was all rough open moorland, never\r\nrising into mountains, and graced by no running streams, by no forest\r\nscenery, almost by no foliage. The lodge itself did indeed stand\r\nclose upon a little river, and was reached by a bridge that crossed\r\nit; but there was nothing pretty either in the river or the bridge.\r\nIt was a placid black little streamlet, which in that portion of\r\nits course was hurried by no steepness, had no broken rocks in its\r\nbed, no trees on its low banks, and played none of those gambols\r\nwhich make running water beautiful. The bridge was a simple low\r\nconstruction with a low parapet, carrying an ordinary roadway up\r\nto the hall door. The lodge itself was as ugly as a house could be,\r\nwhite, of two stories, with the door in the middle and windows on\r\neach side, with a slate roof, and without a tree near it. It was in\r\nthe middle of the shooting, and did not create a town around itself\r\nas do sumptuous mansions, to the great detriment of that seclusion\r\nwhich is favourable to game. "Look at Killancodlem," Dobbes had been\r\nheard to say--"a very fine house for ladies to flirt in; but if you\r\nfind a deer within six miles of it I will eat him first and shoot\r\nhim afterwards." There was a Spartan simplicity about Crummie-Toddie\r\nwhich pleased the Spartan mind of Reginald Dobbes.\r\n\r\n"Ugly, do you call it?"\r\n\r\n"Infernally ugly," said Lord Gerald.\r\n\r\n"What did you expect to find? A big hotel, and a lot of cockneys?\r\nIf you come after grouse, you must come to what the grouse thinks\r\npretty."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, it is ugly," said Silverbridge, who did not choose\r\nto be "sat upon." "I have been at shootings in Scotland before, and\r\nsometimes they are not ugly. This I call beastly." Whereupon Reginald\r\nDobbes turned upon his heel and walked away.\r\n\r\n"Can you shoot?" he said afterwards to Lord Gerald.\r\n\r\n"I can fire off a gun, if you mean that," said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"You have never shot much?"\r\n\r\n"Not what you call very much. I\'m not so old as you are, you know.\r\nEverything must have a beginning." Mr. Dobbes wished "the beginning"\r\nmight have taken place elsewhere; but there had been some truth in\r\nthe remark.\r\n\r\n"What on earth made you tell him crammers like that?" asked\r\nSilverbridge, as the brothers sat together afterwards smoking on the\r\nwall of the bridge.\r\n\r\n"Because he made an ass of himself; asking me whether I could shoot."\r\n\r\nOn the next morning they started at seven. Dobbes had determined to\r\nbe cross, because, as he thought, the young men would certainly keep\r\nhim waiting; and was cross because by their punctuality they robbed\r\nhim of any just cause for offence. During the morning on the moor\r\nthey were hardly ever near enough each other for much conversation,\r\nand very little was said. According to arrangement made they returned\r\nto the house for lunch, it being their purpose not to go far from\r\nhome till their numbers were complete. As they came over the bridge\r\nand put down their guns near the door, Mr. Dobbes spoke the first\r\ngood-humoured word they had heard from his lips. "Why did you tell me\r\nsuch an infernal--, I would say lie, only perhaps you mightn\'t like\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"I told you no lie," said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve only missed two birds all the morning, and you have shot\r\nforty-two. That\'s uncommonly good sport."\r\n\r\n"What have you done?"\r\n\r\n"Only forty," and Mr. Dobbes seemed for the moment to be gratified\r\nby his own inferiority. "You are a deuced sight better than your\r\nbrother."\r\n\r\n"Gerald\'s about the best shot I know," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t he tell?"\r\n\r\n"Because you were angry when we said the place was ugly."\r\n\r\n"I see all about it," said Dobbes. "Nevertheless when a fellow comes\r\nto shoot he shouldn\'t complain because a place isn\'t pretty. What you\r\nwant is a decent house as near as you can have it to your ground. If\r\nthere is anything in Scotland to beat Crummie-Toddie I don\'t know\r\nwhere to find it. Shooting is shooting you know, and touring is\r\ntouring."\r\n\r\nUpon that he took very kindly to Lord Gerald, who, even after the\r\narrival of the other men, was second only in skill to Dobbes himself.\r\nWith Nidderdale, who was an old companion, he got on very well.\r\nNidderdale ate and drank too much, and refused to be driven beyond a\r\ncertain amount of labour, but was in other respects obedient and knew\r\nwhat he was about. Popplecourt was disagreeable, but he was a fairly\r\ngood shot and understood what was expected of him. Silverbridge\r\nwas so good-humoured, that even his manifest faults,--shooting\r\ncarelessly, lying in bed and wanting his dinner,--were, if not\r\nforgiven, at least endured. But Tregear was an abomination. He could\r\nshoot well enough and was active, and when he was at the work seemed\r\nto like it;--but he would stay away whole days by himself, and when\r\nspoken to would answer in a manner which seemed to Dobbes to be flat\r\nmutiny. "We are not doing it for our bread," said Tregear.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no duty in killing a certain number of these animals." They\r\nhad been driving deer on the day before and were to continue the work\r\non the day in question. "I\'m not paid fifteen shillings a week for\r\ndoing it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose if you undertake to do a thing you mean to do it. Of\r\ncourse you\'re not wanted. We can make the double party without you."\r\n\r\n"Then why the mischief should you growl at me?"\r\n\r\n"Because I think a man should do what he undertakes to do. A man who\r\ngets tired after three days\' work of this kind would become tired if\r\nhe were earning his bread."\r\n\r\n"Who says I am tired? I came here to amuse myself."\r\n\r\n"Amuse yourself!"\r\n\r\n"And as long as it amuses me I shall shoot, and when it does not I\r\nshall give it up."\r\n\r\nThis vexed the governor of Crummie-Toddie much. He had learned to\r\nregard himself as the arbiter of the fate of men while they were\r\nsojourning under the same autumnal roof as himself. But a defalcation\r\nwhich occurred immediately afterwards was worse. Silverbridge\r\ndeclared his intention of going over one morning to Killancodlem.\r\nReginald Dobbes muttered a curse between his teeth, which was visible\r\nby the anger on his brow to all the party. "I shall be back to-night,\r\nyou know," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"A lot of men and women who pretend to come there for shooting," said\r\nDobbes angrily, "but do all the mischief they can."\r\n\r\n"One must go and see one\'s friends, you know."\r\n\r\n"Some girl!" said Dobbes.\r\n\r\nBut worse happened than the evil so lightly mentioned. Silverbridge\r\ndid go over to Killancodlem; and presently there came back a man with\r\na cart, who was to return with a certain not small proportion of his\r\nluggage.\r\n\r\n"It\'s hardly honest, you know," said Reginald Dobbes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nKillancodlem\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Dobbes was probably right in his opinion that hotels, tourists,\r\nand congregations of men are detrimental to shooting. Crummie-Toddie\r\nwas in all respects suited for sport. Killancodlem, though it had\r\nthe name of a shooting-place, certainly was not so. Men going there\r\ntook their guns. Gamekeepers were provided and gillies,--and, in a\r\nmoderate quantity, game. On certain grand days a deer or two might be\r\nshot,--and would be very much talked about afterwards. But a glance\r\nat the place would suffice to show that Killancodlem was not intended\r\nfor sport. It was a fine castellated mansion, with beautiful though\r\nnarrow grounds, standing in the valley of the Archay River, with a\r\nmountain behind and the river in front. Between the gates and the\r\nriver there was a public road on which a stage-coach ran, with\r\nloud-blown horns and the noise of many tourists. A mile beyond the\r\nCastle was the famous Killancodlem hotel which made up a hundred\r\nand twenty beds, and at which half as many more guests would sleep\r\non occasions under the tables. And there was the Killancodlem\r\npost-office halfway between the two. At Crummie-Toddie they had to\r\nsend nine miles for their letters and newspapers. At Killancodlem\r\nthere was lawn-tennis and a billiard-room and dancing every night.\r\nThe costumes of the ladies were lovely, and those of the gentlemen,\r\nwho were wonderful in knickerbockers, picturesque hats and variegated\r\nstockings, hardly less so. And then there were carriages and\r\nsaddle-horses, and paths had been made hither and thither through\r\nthe rocks and hills for the sake of the scenery. Scenery! To hear Mr.\r\nDobbes utter the single word was as good as a play. Was it for such\r\ncockney purposes as those that Scotland had been created, fit mother\r\nfor grouse and deer?\r\n\r\nSilverbridge arrived just before lunch, and was soon made to\r\nunderstand that it was impossible that he should go back that day.\r\nMrs. Jones was very great on that occasion. "You are afraid of\r\nReginald Dobbes," she said severely.\r\n\r\n"I think I am rather."\r\n\r\n"Of course you are. How came it to pass that you of all men should\r\nsubmit yourself to such a tyrant?"\r\n\r\n"Good shooting, you know," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"But you dare not call an hour your own--or your soul. Mr. Dobbes and\r\nI are sworn enemies. We both like Scotland, and unfortunately we have\r\nfallen into the same neighbourhood. He looks upon me as the genius of\r\nsloth. I regard him as the incarnation of tyranny. He once said there\r\nshould be no women in Scotland,--just an old one here and there, who\r\nwould know how to cook grouse. I offered to go and cook his grouse!\r\n\r\n"Any friend of mine," continued Mrs. Jones, "who comes down to\r\nCrummie-Toddie without staying a day or two with me,--will never be\r\nmy friend any more. I do not hesitate to tell you, Lord Silverbridge,\r\nthat I call for your surrender, in order that I may show my power\r\nover Reginald Dobbes. Are you a Dobbite?"\r\n\r\n"Not thorough-going," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Then be a Montacute Jones-ite; or a Boncassenite, if, as is\r\npossible, you prefer a young woman to an old one." At this moment\r\nIsabel Boncassen was standing close to them.\r\n\r\n"Killancodlem against Crummie-Toddie for ever!" said Miss Boncassen,\r\nwaving her handkerchief. As a matter of course a messenger was sent\r\nback to Crummie-Toddie for the young lord\'s wearing apparel.\r\n\r\nThe whole of that afternoon he spent playing lawn-tennis with Miss\r\nBoncassen. Lady Mabel was asked to join the party, but she refused,\r\nhaving promised to take a walk to a distant waterfall where the\r\nCodlem falls into the Archay. A gentleman in knickerbockers was\r\nto have gone with her, and two other young ladies; but when the\r\ntime came she was weary, she said,--and she sat almost the entire\r\nafternoon looking at the game from a distance. Silverbridge played\r\nwell, but not so well as the pretty American. With them were joined\r\ntwo others somewhat inferior, so that Silverbridge and Miss Boncassen\r\nwere on different sides. They played game after game, and Miss\r\nBoncassen\'s side always won.\r\n\r\nVery little was said between Silverbridge and Miss Boncassen which\r\ndid not refer to the game. But Lady Mabel, looking on, told herself\r\nthat they were making love to each other before her eyes. And why\r\nshouldn\'t they? She asked herself that question in perfect good\r\nfaith. Why should they not be lovers? Was ever anything prettier than\r\nthe girl in her country dress, active as a fawn and as graceful?\r\nOr could anything be more handsome, more attractive to a girl,\r\nmore good-humoured, or better bred in his playful emulation than\r\nSilverbridge?\r\n\r\n"When youth and pleasure meet, To chase the glowing hours with flying\r\nfeet!" she said to herself over and over again.\r\n\r\nBut why had he sent her the ring? She would certainly give him\r\nback the ring and bid him bestow it at once upon Miss Boncassen.\r\nInconstant boy! Then she would get up and wander away for a time and\r\nrebuke herself. What right had she even to think of inconstancy?\r\nCould she be so irrational, so unjust, as to be sick for his love, as\r\nto be angry with him because he seemed to prefer another? Was she not\r\nwell aware that she herself did not love him;--but that she did love\r\nanother man? She had made up her mind to marry him in order that\r\nshe might be a duchess, and because she could give herself to him\r\nwithout any of that horror which would be her fate in submitting to\r\nmatrimony with one or another of the young men around her. There\r\nmight be disappointment. If he escaped her there would be bitter\r\ndisappointment. But seeing how it was, had she any further ground for\r\nhope? She certainly had no ground for anger!\r\n\r\nIt was thus, within her own bosom, she put questions to herself. And\r\nyet all this before her was simply a game of play in which the girl\r\nand the young man were as eager for victory as though they were\r\nchildren. They were thinking neither of love nor love-making. That\r\nthe girl should be so lovely was no doubt a pleasure to him;--and\r\nperhaps to her also that he should be joyous to look at and sweet of\r\nvoice. But he, could he have been made to tell all the truth within\r\nhim, would have still owned that it was his purpose to make Mabel his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nWhen the game was over and the propositions made for further matches\r\nand the like,--Miss Boncassen said that she would betake herself to\r\nher own room. "I never worked so hard in my life before," she said.\r\n"And I feel like a navvie. I could drink beer out of a jug and eat\r\nbread and cheese. I won\'t play with you any more, Lord Silverbridge,\r\nbecause I am beginning to think it is unladylike to exert myself."\r\n\r\n"Are you not glad you came over?" said Lady Mabel to him as he was\r\ngoing off the ground almost without seeing her.\r\n\r\n"Pretty well," he said.\r\n\r\n"Is not that better than stalking?"\r\n\r\n"Lawn-tennis?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--lawn-tennis,--with Miss Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"She plays uncommonly well."\r\n\r\n"And so do you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, she has such an eye for distances."\r\n\r\n"And you,--what have you an eye for? Will you answer me a question?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes; I think so."\r\n\r\n"Truly."\r\n\r\n"Certainly; if I do answer it."\r\n\r\n"Do you not think her the most beautiful creature you ever saw in\r\nyour life?" He pushed back his cap and looked at her without making\r\nany immediate answer. "I do. Now tell me what you think."\r\n\r\n"I think that perhaps she is."\r\n\r\n"I knew you would say so. You are so honest that you could not bring\r\nyourself to tell a fib,--even to me about that. Come here and sit\r\ndown for a moment." Of course he sat down by her. "You know that\r\nFrank came to see me at Grex?"\r\n\r\n"He never mentioned it."\r\n\r\n"Dear me;--how odd!"\r\n\r\n"It was odd," said he in a voice which showed that he was angry. She\r\ncould hardly explain to herself why she told him this at the present\r\nmoment. It came partly from jealousy, as though she had said to\r\nherself, "Though he may neglect me, he shall know that there is\r\nsomeone who does not;"--and partly from an eager half-angry feeling\r\nthat she would have nothing concealed. There were moments with her\r\nin which she thought that she could arrange her future life in\r\naccordance with certain wise rules over which her heart should have\r\nno influence. There were others, many others, in which her feelings\r\ncompletely got the better of her. And now she told herself that she\r\nwould be afraid of nothing. There should be no deceit, no lies!\r\n\r\n"He went to see you at Grex!" said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Why should he not have come to me at Grex?"\r\n\r\n"Only it is so odd that he did not mention it. It seems to me that he\r\nis always having secrets with you of some kind."\r\n\r\n"Poor Frank! There is no one else who would come to see me at that\r\ntumbledown old place. But I have another thing to say to you. You\r\nhave behaved badly to me."\r\n\r\n"Have I?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. After my folly about that ring you should have known\r\nbetter than to send it to me. You must take it back again."\r\n\r\n"You shall do exactly what you said you would. You shall give it to\r\nmy wife,--when I have one."\r\n\r\n"That did very well for me to say in a note. I did not want to send\r\nmy anger to you over a distance of two or three hundred miles by the\r\npostman. But now that we are together you must take it back."\r\n\r\n"I will do no such thing," said he sturdily.\r\n\r\n"You speak as though this were a matter in which you can have your\r\nown way."\r\n\r\n"I mean to have mine about that."\r\n\r\n"Any lady then must be forced to take any present that a gentleman\r\nmay send her! Allow me to assure you that the usages of society do\r\nnot run in that direction. Here is the ring. I knew that you would\r\ncome over to see--well, to see someone here, and I have kept it ready\r\nin my pocket."\r\n\r\n"I came over to see you."\r\n\r\n"Lord Silverbridge! But we know that in certain employments all\r\nthings are fair." He looked at her not knowing what were the\r\nemployments to which she alluded. "At any rate you will oblige me\r\nby--by--by not being troublesome, and putting this little trinket\r\ninto your pocket."\r\n\r\n"Never! Nothing on earth shall make me do it."\r\n\r\nAt Killancodlem they did not dine till half-past eight. Twilight was\r\nnow stealing on these two, who were still out in the garden, all the\r\nothers having gone in to dress. She looked round to see that no other\r\neyes were watching them as she still held the ring. "It is there,"\r\nshe said, putting it on the bench between them. Then she prepared to\r\nrise from the seat so that she might leave it with him.\r\n\r\nBut he was too quick for her, and was away at a distance before she\r\nhad collected her dress. And from a distance he spoke again, "If you\r\nchoose that it shall be lost, so be it."\r\n\r\n"You had better take it," said she, following him slowly. But he\r\nwould not turn back;--nor would she. They met again in the hall for a\r\nmoment. "I should be sorry it should be lost," said he, "because it\r\nbelonged to my great-uncle. And I had hoped that I might live to see\r\nit very often."\r\n\r\n"You can fetch it," she said, as she went to her room. He however\r\nwould not fetch it. She had accepted it, and he would not take it\r\nback again, let the fate of the gem be what it might.\r\n\r\nBut to the feminine and more cautious mind the very value of the\r\ntrinket made its position out there on the bench, within the grasp of\r\nany dishonest gardener, a burden to her. She could not reconcile it\r\nto her conscience that it should be so left. The diamond was a large\r\none, and she had heard it spoken of as a stone of great value,--so\r\nmuch so, that Silverbridge had been blamed for wearing it ordinarily.\r\nShe had asked for it in joke, regarding it as a thing which could not\r\nbe given away. She could not go down herself and take it up again;\r\nbut neither could she allow it to remain. As she went to her room\r\nshe met Mrs. Jones already coming from hers. "You will keep us all\r\nwaiting," said the hostess.\r\n\r\n"Oh no;--nobody ever dressed so quickly. But, Mrs. Jones, will you do\r\nme a favour?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"And will you let me explain something?"\r\n\r\n"Anything you like,--from a hopeless engagement down to a broken\r\ngarter."\r\n\r\n"I am suffering neither from one or the other. But there is a most\r\nvaluable ring lying out in the garden. Will you send for it?" Then of\r\ncourse the story had to be told. "You will, I hope, understand how\r\nI came to ask for it foolishly. It was because it was the one thing\r\nwhich I was sure he would not give away."\r\n\r\n"Why not take it?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you understand? I wouldn\'t for the world. But you will be good\r\nenough,--won\'t you, to see that there is nothing else in it?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing of love?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing in the least. He and I are excellent friends. We are\r\ncousins, and intimate, and all that. I thought I might have had my\r\njoke, and now I am punished for it. As for love, don\'t you see he is\r\nover head and ears in love with Miss Boncassen?"\r\n\r\nThis was very imprudent on the part of Lady Mabel, who, had she been\r\ncapable of clinging fast to her policy, would not now in a moment\r\nof strong feeling have done so much to raise obstacles in her own\r\nway. "But you will send for it, won\'t you, and have it put on his\r\ndressing-table to-night?" When he went to bed Lord Silverbridge found\r\nit on his table.\r\n\r\nBut before that time came he had twice danced with Miss Boncassen,\r\nLady Mabel having refused to dance with him. "No," she said, "I am\r\nangry with you. You ought to have felt that it did not become you as\r\na gentleman to subject me to inconvenience by throwing upon me the\r\ncharge of that diamond. You may be foolish enough to be indifferent\r\nabout its value, but as you have mixed me up with it I cannot afford\r\nto have it lost."\r\n\r\n"It is yours."\r\n\r\n"No, sir; it is not mine, nor will it ever be mine. But I wish you to\r\nunderstand that you have offended me."\r\n\r\nThis made him so unhappy for the time that he almost told the story\r\nto Miss Boncassen. "If I were to give you a ring," he said, "would\r\nnot you accept it?"\r\n\r\n"What a question!"\r\n\r\n"What I mean is, don\'t you think all those conventional rules about\r\nmen and women are absurd?"\r\n\r\n"As a progressive American, of course I am bound to think all\r\nconventional rules are an abomination."\r\n\r\n"If you had a brother and I gave him a stick he\'d take it."\r\n\r\n"Not across his back, I hope."\r\n\r\n"Or if I gave your father a book?"\r\n\r\n"He\'d take books to any extent, I should say."\r\n\r\n"And why not you a ring?"\r\n\r\n"Who said I wouldn\'t? But after all this you mustn\'t try me."\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad of that! Well;--if you\'ll promise that you\'ll never\r\noffer me one, I\'ll promise that I\'ll take it when it comes. But what\r\ndoes all this mean?"\r\n\r\n"It is not worth talking about."\r\n\r\n"You have offered somebody a ring, and somebody hasn\'t taken it. May\r\nI guess?"\r\n\r\n"I had rather you did not."\r\n\r\n"I could, you know."\r\n\r\n"Never mind about that. Now come and have a turn. I am bound not to\r\ngive you a ring; but you are bound to accept anything else I may\r\noffer."\r\n\r\n"No, Lord Silverbridge;--not at all. Nevertheless we\'ll have a turn."\r\n\r\nThat night before he went up to his room he had told Isabel Boncassen\r\nthat he loved her. And when he spoke he was telling her the truth.\r\nIt had seemed to him that Mabel had become hard to him, and had over\r\nand over again rejected the approaches to tenderness which he had\r\nattempted to make in his intercourse with her. Even though she were\r\nto accept him, what would that be worth to him if she did not love\r\nhim? So many things had been added together! Why had Tregear gone to\r\nGrex, and having gone there why had he kept his journey a secret?\r\nTregear he knew was engaged to his sister;--but for all that, there\r\nwas a closer intimacy between Mabel and Tregear than between Mabel\r\nand himself. And surely she might have taken his ring!\r\n\r\nAnd then Isabel Boncassen was so perfect! Since he had first met her\r\nhe had heard her loveliness talked of on all sides. It seemed to be\r\nadmitted everywhere that so beautiful a creature had never before\r\nbeen seen in London. There is even a certain dignity attached to that\r\nwhich is praised by all lips. Miss Boncassen as an American girl, had\r\nshe been judged to be beautiful only by his own eyes, might perhaps\r\nhave seemed to him to be beneath his serious notice. In such a case\r\nhe might have felt himself unable to justify so extraordinary a\r\nchoice. But there was an acclamation of assent as to this girl! Then\r\ncame the dancing,--the one dance after another; the pressure of the\r\nhand, the entreaty that she would not, just on this occasion, dance\r\nwith any other man, the attendance on her when she took her glass\r\nof wine, the whispered encouragement of Mrs. Montacute Jones, the\r\nhalf-resisting and yet half-yielding conduct of the girl. "I shall\r\nnot dance at all again," she said when he asked her to stand up for\r\nanother. "Think of all that lawn-tennis this morning."\r\n\r\n"But you will play to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you were going."\r\n\r\n"Of course I shall stay now," he said, and as he said it he put his\r\nhand on her hand, which was on his arm. She drew it away at once. "I\r\nlove you so dearly," he whispered to her; "so dearly."\r\n\r\n"Lord Silverbridge!"\r\n\r\n"I do. I do. Can you say that you will love me in return?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot," she said slowly. "I have never dreamed of such a thing. I\r\nhardly know now whether you are in earnest."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, indeed I am."\r\n\r\n"Then I will say good-night, and think about it. Everybody is going.\r\nWe will have our game to-morrow at any rate."\r\n\r\nWhen he went to his room he found the ring on his dressing-table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n"And Then!"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next morning Miss Boncassen did not appear at breakfast. Word\r\ncame that she had been so fatigued by the lawn-tennis as not to be\r\nable to leave her bed. "I have been to her," said Mrs. Montacute\r\nJones, whispering to Lord Silverbridge, as though he were\r\nparticularly interested. "There\'s nothing really the matter. She will\r\nbe down to lunch."\r\n\r\n"I was afraid she might be ill," said Silverbridge, who was now\r\nhardly anxious to hide his admiration.\r\n\r\n"Oh no;--nothing of that sort; but she will not be able to play again\r\nto-day. It was your fault. You should not have made her dance last\r\nnight." After that Mrs. Jones said a word about it all to Lady Mabel.\r\n"I hope the Duke will not be angry with me."\r\n\r\n"Why should he be angry with you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose he will approve of it, and perhaps he\'ll say I\r\nbrought them together on purpose."\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards Mabel asked Silverbridge to walk with her to the\r\nwaterfall. She had worked herself into such a state of mind that she\r\nhardly knew what to do, what to wish, or how to act. At one moment\r\nshe would tell herself that it was better in every respect that she\r\nshould cease to think of being Duchess of Omnium. It was not fit that\r\nshe should think of it. She herself cared but little for the young\r\nman, and he--she would tell herself--now appeared to care as little\r\nfor her. And yet to be Duchess of Omnium! But was it not clear that\r\nhe was absolutely in love with this other girl? She had played her\r\ncards so badly that the game was now beyond her powers. Then other\r\nthoughts would come. Was it beyond her powers? Had he not told her\r\nin London that he loved her? Had he not given her the ring which she\r\nwell knew he valued? Ah;--if she could but have been aware of all\r\nthat had passed between Silverbridge and the Duke, how different\r\nwould have been her feelings! And then would it not be so much better\r\nfor him that he should marry her, one of his own class, than this\r\nAmerican girl, of whom nobody knew anything? And then,--to be the\r\ndaughter of the Duke of Omnium, to be the future Duchess, to escape\r\nfrom all the cares which her father\'s vices and follies had brought\r\nupon her, to have come to an end of all her troubles! Would it not be\r\nsweet?\r\n\r\nShe had made her mind up to nothing when she asked him to walk up to\r\nthe waterfall. There was present to her only the glimmer of an idea\r\nthat she ought to caution him not to play with the American girl\'s\r\nfeelings. She knew herself to be aware that, when the time for her\r\nown action came, her feminine feelings would get the better of\r\nher purpose. She could not craftily bring him to the necessity of\r\nbestowing himself upon her. Had that been within the compass of her\r\npowers, opportunities had not been lacking to her. On such occasions\r\nshe had always "spared him." And should the opportunity come again,\r\nagain she would spare him. But she might perhaps do some good,--not\r\nto herself, that was now out of the question,--but to him, by showing\r\nhim how wrong he was in trifling with this girl\'s feelings.\r\n\r\nAnd so they started for their walk. He of course would have avoided\r\nit had it been possible. When men in such matters have two strings to\r\ntheir bow, much inconvenience is felt when the two become entangled.\r\nSilverbridge no doubt had come over to Killancodlem for the sake of\r\nmaking love to Mabel Grex, and instead of doing so he had made love\r\nto Isabel Boncassen. And during the watches of the night, and as he\r\nhad dressed himself in the morning, and while Mrs. Jones had been\r\nwhispering to him her little bulletin as to the state of the young\r\nlady\'s health, he had not repented himself of the change. Mabel had\r\nbeen, he thought, so little gracious to him that he would have given\r\nup that notion earlier, but for his indiscreet declaration to his\r\nfather. On the other hand, making love to Isabel Boncassen seemed\r\nto him to possess some divine afflatus of joy which made it of all\r\nimaginable occupations the sweetest and most charming. She had\r\nadmitted of no embrace. Indeed he had attempted none, unless that\r\ntouch of the hand might be so called, from which she had immediately\r\nwithdrawn. Her conduct had been such that he had felt it to be\r\nincumbent on him, at the very moment, to justify the touch by a\r\ndeclaration of love. Then she had told him that she would not promise\r\nto love him in return. And yet it had been so sweet, so heavenly\r\nsweet!\r\n\r\nDuring the morning he had almost forgotten Mabel. When Mrs. Jones\r\ntold him that Isabel would keep her room, he longed to ask for\r\nleave to go and make some inquiry at the door. She would not play\r\nlawn-tennis with him. Well;--he did not now care much for that. After\r\nwhat he had said to her she must at any rate give him some answer.\r\nShe had been so gracious to him that his hopes ran very high. It\r\nnever occurred to him to fancy that she might be gracious to him\r\nbecause he was heir to the Dukedom of Omnium. She herself was so\r\ninfinitely superior to all wealth, to all rank, to all sublunary\r\narrangements, conventions, and considerations, that there was no room\r\nfor confidence of that nature. But he was confident because her smile\r\nhad been sweet, and her eyes bright,--and because he was conscious,\r\nthough unconsciously conscious, of something of the sympathy of love.\r\n\r\nBut he had to go to the waterfall with Mabel. Lady Mabel was always\r\ndressed perfectly,--having great gifts of her own in that direction.\r\nThere was a freshness about her which made her morning costume more\r\ncharming than that of the evening, and never did she look so well as\r\nwhen arrayed for a walk. On this occasion she had certainly done her\r\nbest. But he, poor blind idiot, saw nothing of this. The white gauzy\r\nfabric which had covered Isabel\'s satin petticoat on the previous\r\nevening still filled his eyes. Those perfect boots, the little\r\nglimpses of party-coloured stockings above them, the looped-up skirt,\r\nthe jacket fitting but never binding that lovely body and waist, the\r\njaunty hat with its small fresh feathers, all were nothing to him.\r\nNor was the bright honest face beneath the hat anything to him\r\nnow;--for it was an honest face, though misfortunes which had come\r\nhad somewhat marred the honesty of the heart.\r\n\r\nAt first the conversation was about indifferent things,--Killancodlem\r\nand Mrs. Jones, Crummie-Toddie and Reginald Dobbes. They had gone\r\nalong the high-road as far as the post-office, and had turned up\r\nthrough the wood and reached a seat whence there was a beautiful view\r\ndown upon the Archay, before a word was said affecting either Miss\r\nBoncassen or the ring. "You got the ring safe?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"How could you be so foolish as to risk it?"\r\n\r\n"I did not regard it as mine. You had accepted it,--I thought."\r\n\r\n"But if I had, and then repented of my fault in doing so, should you\r\nnot have been willing to help me in setting myself right with myself?\r\nOf course, after what had passed, it was a trouble to me when it\r\ncame. What was I to do? For a day or two I thought I would take it,\r\nnot as liking to take it, but as getting rid of the trouble in that\r\nway. Then I remembered its value, its history, the fact that all who\r\nknew you would want to know what had become of it,--and I felt that\r\nit should be given back. There is only one person to whom you must\r\ngive it."\r\n\r\n"Who is that?" he said quickly.\r\n\r\n"Your wife;--or to her who is to become your wife. No other woman can\r\nbe justified in accepting such a present."\r\n\r\n"There has been a great deal more said about it than it\'s worth,"\r\nsaid he, not anxious at the present moment to discuss any matrimonial\r\nprojects with her. "Shall we go on to the Fall?" Then she got up and\r\nled the way till they came to the little bridge from which they could\r\nsee the Falls of the Codlem below them. "I call that very pretty," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"I thought you would like it."\r\n\r\n"I never saw anything of that kind more jolly. Do you care for\r\nscenery, Mabel?"\r\n\r\n"Very much. I know no pleasure equal to it. You have never seen\r\nGrex?"\r\n\r\n"Is it like this?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. It is wilder than this, and there are not so many\r\ntrees; but to my eyes it is very beautiful. I wish you had seen it."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I may some day."\r\n\r\n"That is not likely now," she said. "The house is in ruins. If I had\r\njust money enough to keep it for myself, I think I could live alone\r\nthere and be happy."\r\n\r\n"You;--alone! Of course you mean to marry?"\r\n\r\n"Mean to marry! Do persons marry because they mean it? With nineteen\r\nmen out of twenty the idea of marrying them would convey the idea of\r\nhating them. You can mean to marry. No doubt you do mean it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I shall,--some day. How very well the house looks from\r\nhere." It was incumbent upon him at the present moment to turn the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nBut when she had a project in her head it was not so easy to turn her\r\naway. "Yes, indeed," she said, "very well. But as I was saying,--you\r\ncan mean to marry."\r\n\r\n"Anybody can mean it."\r\n\r\n"But you can carry out a purpose. What are you thinking of doing\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my honour, Mabel, that is unfair."\r\n\r\n"Are we not friends?"\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"Dear friends?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"Then may I not tell you what I think? If you do not mean to marry\r\nthat American young lady you should not raise false hopes."\r\n\r\n"False--hopes!" He had hopes, but he had never thought that Isabel\r\ncould have any.\r\n\r\n"False hopes;--certainly. Do you not know that everyone was looking\r\nat you last night?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"And that that old woman is going about talking of it as her doing,\r\npretending to be afraid of your father, whereas nothing would please\r\nher better than to humble a family so high as yours."\r\n\r\n"Humble!" exclaimed Lord Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Do you think your father would like it? Would you think that another\r\nman would be doing well for himself by marrying Miss Boncassen?"\r\n\r\n"I do," said he energetically.\r\n\r\n"Then you must be very much in love with her."\r\n\r\n"I say nothing about that."\r\n\r\n"If you are so much in love with her that you mean to face the\r\ndispleasure of all your friends--"\r\n\r\n"I do not say what I mean. I could talk more freely to you than to\r\nany one else, but I won\'t talk about that even to you. As regards\r\nMiss Boncassen, I think that any man might marry her, without\r\ndiscredit. I won\'t have it said that she can be inferior to me,--or\r\nto anybody."\r\n\r\nThere was a steady manliness in this which took Lady Mabel by\r\nsurprise. She was convinced that he intended to offer his hand to the\r\ngirl, and now was actuated chiefly by a feeling that his doing so\r\nwould be an outrage to all English propriety. If a word might have\r\nan effect it would be her duty to speak that word. "I think you are\r\nwrong there, Lord Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I am right."\r\n\r\n"What have you yourself felt about your sister and Mr. Tregear?"\r\n\r\n"It is altogether different;--altogether. Frank\'s wife will be simply\r\nhis wife. Mine, should I outlive my father, will be Duchess of\r\nOmnium."\r\n\r\n"But your father? I have heard you speak with bitter regret of this\r\naffair of Lady Mary\'s, because it vexes him. Would your marriage with\r\nan American lady vex him less?"\r\n\r\n"Why should it vex him at all? Is she vulgar, or ill to look at, or\r\nstupid?"\r\n\r\n"Think of her mother."\r\n\r\n"I am not going to marry her mother. Nor for the matter of that am\r\nI going to marry her. You are taking all that for granted in a most\r\nunfair way."\r\n\r\n"How can I help it after what I saw yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"I will not talk any more about it. We had better go down or we shall\r\nget no lunch." Lady Mabel, as she followed him, tried to make herself\r\nbelieve that all her sorrow came from regret that so fine a scion\r\nof the British nobility should throw himself away upon an American\r\nadventuress.\r\n\r\nThe guests were still at lunch when they entered the dining-room, and\r\nIsabel was seated close to Mrs. Jones. Silverbridge at once went up\r\nto her,--and place was made for him as though he had almost a right\r\nto be next to her. Miss Boncassen herself bore her honours well,\r\nseeming to regard the little change at table as though it was of no\r\nmoment. "I became so eager about that game," she said, "that I went\r\non too long."\r\n\r\n"I hope you are now none the worse."\r\n\r\n"At six o\'clock this morning I thought I should never use my legs\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Were you awake at six?" said Silverbridge, with pitying voice.\r\n\r\n"That was it. I could not sleep. Now I begin to hope that sooner or\r\nlater I shall unstiffen."\r\n\r\nDuring every moment, at every word that he uttered, he was thinking\r\nof the declaration of love which he had made to her. But it seemed to\r\nhim as though the matter had not dwelt on her mind. When they drew\r\ntheir chairs away from the table he thought that not a moment was\r\nto be lost before some further explanation of their feelings for\r\neach other should be made. Was not the matter which had been so far\r\ndiscussed of vital importance for both of them? And, glorious as she\r\nwas above all other women, the offer which he had made must have some\r\nweight with her. He did not think that he proposed to give more than\r\nshe deserved, but still, that which he was so willing to give was not\r\na little. Or was it possible that she had not understood his meaning?\r\nIf so, he would not willingly lose a moment before he made it plain\r\nto her. But she seemed content to hang about with the other women,\r\nand when she sauntered about the grounds seated herself on a\r\ngarden-chair with Lady Mabel, and discussed with great eloquence the\r\ngeneral beauty of Scottish scenery. An hour went on in this way.\r\nCould it be that she knew that he had offered to make her his wife?\r\nDuring this time he went and returned more than once, but still she\r\nwas there, on the same garden-seat, talking to those who came in her\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThen on a sudden she got up and put her hand on his arm. "Come and\r\ntake a turn with me," she said. "Lord Silverbridge, do you remember\r\nanything of last night?"\r\n\r\n"Remember!"\r\n\r\n"I thought for a while this morning that I would let it pass as\r\nthough it had been mere trifling."\r\n\r\n"It would have wanted two to let it pass in that way," he said,\r\nalmost indignantly.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this she looked up at him, and there came over her face\r\nthat brilliant smile, which to him was perhaps the most potent of her\r\nspells. "What do you mean by--wanting two?"\r\n\r\n"I must have a voice in that as well as you."\r\n\r\n"And what is your voice?"\r\n\r\n"My voice is this. I told you last night that I loved you. This\r\nmorning I ask you to be my wife."\r\n\r\n"It is a very clear voice," she said,--almost in a whisper; but in a\r\ntone so serious that it startled him.\r\n\r\n"It ought to be clear," he said doggedly.\r\n\r\n"Do you think I don\'t know that? Do you think that if I liked you\r\nwell last night I don\'t like you better now?"\r\n\r\n"But do you--like me?"\r\n\r\n"That is just the thing I am going to say nothing about."\r\n\r\n"Isabel!"\r\n\r\n"Just the one thing I will not allude to. Now you must listen to me."\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"I know a great deal about you. We Americans are an inquiring people,\r\nand I have found out pretty much everything." His mind misgave him\r\nas he felt she had ascertained his former purpose respecting Mabel.\r\n"You," she said, "among young men in England are about the foremost,\r\nand therefore,--as I think,--about the foremost in the world. And you\r\nhave all personal gifts;--youth and spirits-- Well, I will not go on\r\nand name the others. You are, no doubt, supposed to be entitled to\r\nthe best and sweetest of God\'s feminine creatures."\r\n\r\n"You are she."\r\n\r\n"Whether you be entitled to me or not I cannot yet say. Now I will\r\ntell you something of myself. My father\'s father came to New York as\r\na labourer from Holland, and worked upon the quays in that city. Then\r\nhe built houses, and became rich, and was almost a miser;--with the\r\ngood sense, however, to educate his only son. What my father is you\r\nsee. To me he is sterling gold, but he is not like your people. My\r\ndear mother is not at all like your ladies. She is not a lady in your\r\nsense,--though with her unselfish devotion to others she is something\r\ninfinitely better. For myself I am,--well, meaning to speak honestly,\r\nI will call myself pretty and smart. I think I know how to be true."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you do."\r\n\r\n"But what right have you to suppose I shall know how to be a\r\nDuchess?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure you will."\r\n\r\n"Now listen to me. Go to your friends and ask them. Ask that Lady\r\nMabel;--ask your father;--ask that Lady Cantrip. And above all, ask\r\nyourself. And allow me to require you to take three months to do\r\nthis. Do not come to see me for three months."\r\n\r\n"And then?"\r\n\r\n"What may happen then I cannot tell, for I want three months also to\r\nthink of it myself. Till then, good-bye." She gave him her hand and\r\nleft it in his for a few seconds. He tried to draw her to him; but\r\nshe resisted him, still smiling. Then she left him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nIschl\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a custom with Mrs. Finn almost every autumn to go off to\r\nVienna, where she possessed considerable property, and there to\r\ninspect the circumstances of her estate. Sometimes her husband\r\nwould accompany her, and he did so in this year of which we are now\r\nspeaking. One morning in September they were together at an hotel at\r\nIschl, whither they had come from Vienna, when as they went through\r\nthe hall into the courtyard, they came, in the very doorway, upon\r\nthe Duke of Omnium and his daughter. The Duke and Lady Mary had just\r\narrived, having passed through the mountains from the salt-mine\r\ndistrict, and were about to take up their residence in the hotel for\r\na few days. They had travelled very slowly, for Lady Mary had been\r\nill, and the Duke had expressed his determination to see a doctor at\r\nIschl.\r\n\r\nThere is no greater mistake than in supposing that only the young\r\nblush. But the blushes of middle life are luckily not seen through\r\nthe tan which has come from the sun and the gas and the work and the\r\nwiles of the world. Both the Duke and Phineas blushed; and though\r\ntheir blushes were hidden, that peculiar glance of the eye which\r\nalways accompanies a blush was visible enough from one to the other.\r\nThe elder lady kept her countenance admirably, and the younger one\r\nhad no occasion for blushing. She at once ran forward and kissed her\r\nfriend. The Duke stood with his hat off waiting to give his hand to\r\nthe lady, and then took that of his late colleague. "How odd that we\r\nshould meet here," he said, turning to Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"Odd enough to us that your Grace should be here," she said, "because\r\nwe had heard nothing of your intended coming."\r\n\r\n"It is so nice to find you," said Lady Mary. "We are this moment\r\ncome. Don\'t say that you are this moment going."\r\n\r\n"At this moment we are only going as far as Halstadt."\r\n\r\n"And are coming back to dinner? Of course they will dine with us.\r\nWill they not, papa?" The Duke said that he hoped they would. To\r\ndeclare that you are engaged at an hotel, unless there be some real\r\nengagement, is almost an impossibility. There was no escape, and\r\nbefore they were allowed to get into their carriage they had promised\r\nthey would dine with the Duke and his daughter.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that it is especially a bore," Mrs. Finn said to her\r\nhusband in the carriage. "You may be quite sure that of whatever\r\ntrouble there may be in it, he has much more than his share."\r\n\r\n"His share should be the whole," said her husband. "No one else has\r\ndone anything wrong."\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke\'s apology had reached her, so that there was no longer\r\nany ground for absolute hostility, then she had told the whole story\r\nto her husband. He at first was very indignant. What right had the\r\nDuke to expect that any ordinary friend should act duenna over his\r\ndaughter in accordance with his caprices? This was said and much more\r\nof the kind. But any humour towards quarrelling which Phineas Finn\r\nmight have felt for a day or two was quieted by his wife\'s prudence.\r\n"A man," she said, "can do no more than apologise. After that there\r\nis no room for reproach."\r\n\r\nAt dinner the conversation turned at first on British politics,\r\nin which Mrs. Finn was quite able to take her part. Phineas was\r\ndecidedly of opinion that Sir Timothy Beeswax and Lord Drummond could\r\nnot live another Session. And on this subject a good deal was said.\r\nLater in the evening the Duke found himself sitting with Mrs. Finn in\r\nthe broad verandah over the hotel garden, while Lady Mary was playing\r\nto Phineas within. "How do you think she is looking?" asked the\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n"Of course I see that she has been ill. She tells me that she was far\r\nfrom well at Salzburg."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--indeed for three or four days she frightened me much. She\r\nsuffered terribly from headaches."\r\n\r\n"Nervous headaches?"\r\n\r\n"So they said there. I feel quite angry with myself because I did\r\nnot bring a doctor with us. The trouble and ceremony of such an\r\naccompaniment is no doubt disagreeable."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose seemed when you started to be unnecessary?"\r\n\r\n"Quite unnecessary."\r\n\r\n"Does she complain again now?"\r\n\r\n"She did to-day--a little."\r\n\r\nThe next day Lady Mary could not leave her bed; and the Duke in his\r\nsorrow was obliged to apply to Mrs. Finn. After what had passed on\r\nthe previous day Mrs. Finn of course called, and was shown at once up\r\nto her young friend\'s room. There she found the girl in great pain,\r\nlying with her two thin hands up to her head, and hardly able to\r\nutter more than a word. Shortly after that Mrs. Finn was alone with\r\nthe Duke, and then there took place a conversation between them which\r\nthe lady thought to be very remarkable.\r\n\r\n"Had I better send for a doctor from England?" he asked. In answer to\r\nthis Mrs. Finn expressed her opinion that such a measure was hardly\r\nnecessary, that the gentleman from the town who had been called in\r\nseemed to know what he was about, and that the illness, lamentable\r\nas it was, did not seem to be in any way dangerous. "One cannot tell\r\nwhat it comes from," said the Duke dubiously.\r\n\r\n"Young people, I fancy, are often subject to such maladies."\r\n\r\n"It must come from something wrong."\r\n\r\n"That may be said of all sickness."\r\n\r\n"And therefore one tries to find out the cause. She says that she is\r\nunhappy." These last words he spoke slowly and in a low voice. To\r\nthis Mrs. Finn could make no reply. She did not doubt but that the\r\ngirl was unhappy, and she knew well why; but the source of Lady\r\nMary\'s misery was one to which she could not very well allude. "You\r\nknow all the misery about that young man."\r\n\r\n"That is a trouble that requires time to cure it," she said,--not\r\nmeaning to imply that time would cure it by enabling the girl to\r\nforget her lover; but because in truth she had not known what else to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n"If time will cure it."\r\n\r\n"Time, they say, cures all sorrows."\r\n\r\n"But what should I do to help time? There is no sacrifice I would\r\nnot make,--no sacrifice! Of myself I mean. I would devote myself to\r\nher,--leave everything else on one side. We purpose being back in\r\nEngland in October; but I would remain here if I thought it better\r\nfor her comfort."\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell, Duke."\r\n\r\n"Neither can I. But you are a woman and might know better than I do.\r\nIt is so hard that a man should be left with a charge of which from\r\nits very nature he cannot understand the duties." Then he paused, but\r\nshe could find no words which would suit at the moment. It was almost\r\nincredible to her that after what had passed he should speak to her\r\nat all as to the condition of his daughter. "I cannot, you know," he\r\nsaid very seriously, "encourage a hope that she should be allowed to\r\nmarry that man."\r\n\r\n"I do not know."\r\n\r\n"You yourself, Mrs. Finn, felt that when she told you about it at\r\nMatching."\r\n\r\n"I felt that you would disapprove of it."\r\n\r\n"Disapprove of it! How could it be otherwise? Of course you felt\r\nthat. There are ranks in life in which the first comer that suits a\r\nmaiden\'s eye may be accepted as a fitting lover. I will not say but\r\nthat they who are born to such a life may be the happier. They are, I\r\nam sure, free from troubles to which they are incident whom fate has\r\ncalled to a different sphere. But duty is--duty;--and whatever pang\r\nit may cost, duty should be performed."\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"Certainly;--certainly; certainly," he said, re-echoing her word.\r\n\r\n"But then, Duke, one has to be so sure what duty requires. In many\r\nmatters this is easy enough, and the only difficulty comes from\r\ntemptation. There are cases in which it is so hard to know."\r\n\r\n"Is this one of them?"\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"Then the maiden should--in any class of life--be allowed to take the\r\nman--that just suits her eye?" As he said this his mind was intent on\r\nhis Glencora and on Burgo Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n"I have not said so. A man may be bad, vicious, a spendthrift,--eaten\r\nup by bad habits." Then he frowned, thinking that she also had her\r\nmind intent on his Glencora and on that Burgo Fitzgerald, and being\r\nmost unwilling to have the difference between Burgo and Frank Tregear\r\npointed out to him. "Nor have I said," she continued, "that even were\r\nnone of these faults apparent in the character of a suitor, the lady\r\nshould in all cases be advised to accept a young man because he has\r\nmade himself agreeable to her. There may be discrepancies."\r\n\r\n"There are," said he, still with a low voice, but with infinite\r\nenergy,--"insurmountable discrepancies."\r\n\r\n"I only said that this was a case in which it might be difficult for\r\nyou to see your duty plainly."\r\n\r\n"Why should it be?"\r\n\r\n"You would not have her--break her heart?" Then he was silent for\r\nawhile, turning over in his mind the proposition which now seemed to\r\nhave been made to him. If the question came to that,--should she be\r\nallowed to break her heart and die, or should he save her from that\r\nfate by sanctioning her marriage with Tregear? If the choice could be\r\nput to him plainly by some supernal power, what then would he choose?\r\nIf duty required him to prevent this marriage, his duty could not be\r\naltered by the fact that his girl would avenge herself upon him by\r\ndying! If such a marriage were in itself wrong, that wrong could not\r\nbe made right by the fear of such a catastrophe. Was it not often\r\nthe case that duty required that someone should die? And yet as he\r\nthought of it,--thought that the someone whom his mind had suggested\r\nwas the one female creature now left belonging to him,--he put his\r\nhand up to his brow and trembled with agony. If he knew, if in\r\ntruth he believed that such would be the result of firmness on his\r\npart,--then he would be infirm, then he must yield. Sooner than that,\r\nhe must welcome this Tregear to his house. But why should he think\r\nthat she would die? This woman had now asked him whether he would\r\nbe willing to break his girl\'s heart. It was a frightful question;\r\nbut he could see that it had come naturally in the sequence of the\r\nconversation which he had forced upon her. Did girls break their\r\nhearts in such emergencies? Was it not all romance? "Men have died\r\nand worms have eaten them,--but not for love." He remembered it all\r\nand carried on the argument in his mind, though the pause was but for\r\na minute. There might be suffering, no doubt. The higher the duties\r\nthe keener the pangs! But would it become him to be deterred from\r\ndoing right because she for a time might find that she had made the\r\nworld bitter to herself? And were there not feminine wiles,--tricks\r\nby which women learn to have their way in opposition to the judgment\r\nof their lords and masters? He did not think that his Mary was\r\nwilfully guilty of any scheme. The suffering he knew was true\r\nsuffering. But not the less did it become him to be on his guard\r\nagainst attacks of this nature.\r\n\r\n"No," he said at last; "I would not have her break her heart,--if I\r\nunderstand what such words mean. They are generally, I think, used\r\nfantastically."\r\n\r\n"You would not wish to see her overwhelmed by sorrow?"\r\n\r\n"Wish it! What a question to ask a father!"\r\n\r\n"I must be more plain in my language, Duke. Though such a marriage\r\nbe distasteful to you, it might perhaps be preferable to seeing her\r\nsorrowing always."\r\n\r\n"Why should it? I have to sorrow always. We are told that man is born\r\nto sorrow as surely as the sparks fly upwards."\r\n\r\n"Then I can say nothing further."\r\n\r\n"You think I am cruel."\r\n\r\n"If I am to say what I really think I shall offend you."\r\n\r\n"No;--not unless you mean offence."\r\n\r\n"I shall never do that to you, Duke. When you talk as you do now you\r\nhardly know yourself. You think you could see her suffering, and not\r\nbe moved by it. But were it to be continued long you would give way.\r\nThough we know that there is an infinity of grief in this life, still\r\nwe struggle to save those we love from grieving. If she be steadfast\r\nenough to cling to her affection for this man, then at last you will\r\nhave to yield." He looked at her frowning, but did not say a word.\r\n"Then it will perhaps be a comfort for you to know that the man\r\nhimself is trustworthy and honest."\r\n\r\nThere was a terrible rebuke in this; but still, as he had called it\r\ndown upon himself, he would not resent it, even in his heart. "Thank\r\nyou," he said, rising from his chair. "Perhaps you will see her again\r\nthis afternoon." Of course she assented, and, as the interview had\r\ntaken place in his rooms, she took her leave.\r\n\r\nThis which Mrs. Finn had said to him was all to the same effect as\r\nthat which had come from Lady Cantrip; only it was said with a higher\r\nspirit. Both the women saw the matter in the same light. There must\r\nbe a fight between him and his girl; but she, if she could hold out\r\nfor a certain time, would be the conqueror. He might take her away\r\nand try what absence would do, or he might have recourse to that\r\nspecific which had answered so well in reference to his own wife;\r\nbut if she continued to sorrow during absence, and if she would have\r\nnothing to do with the other lover,--then he must at last give way!\r\nHe had declared that he was willing to sacrifice himself,--meaning\r\nthereby that if a lengthened visit to the cities of China, or a\r\nprolonged sojourn in the Western States of America would wean her\r\nfrom her love, he would go to China or to the Western States. At\r\npresent his self-banishment had been carried no farther than Vienna.\r\nDuring their travels hitherto Tregear\'s name had not once been\r\nmentioned. The Duke had come away from home resolved not to mention\r\nit,--and she was minded to keep it in reserve till some seeming\r\ncatastrophe should justify a declaration of her purpose. But from\r\nfirst to last she had been sad, and latterly she had been ill. When\r\nasked as to her complaint she would simply say that she was not\r\nhappy. To go on with this through the Chinese cities could hardly be\r\ngood for either of them. She would not wake herself to any enthusiasm\r\nin regard to scenery, costume, pictures, or even discomforts.\r\nWherever she was taken it was all barren to her.\r\n\r\nAs their plans stood at present, they were to return to England so\r\nas to enable her to be at Custins by the middle of October. Had he\r\ntaught himself to hope that any good could be done by prolonged\r\ntravelling he would readily have thrown over Custins and Lord\r\nPopplecourt. He could not bring himself to trust much to the\r\nPopplecourt scheme. But the same contrivance had answered on that\r\nformer occasion. When he spoke to her about their plans, she\r\nexpressed herself quite ready to go back to England. When he\r\nsuggested those Chinese cities, her face became very long and she was\r\nimmediately attacked by paroxysms of headaches.\r\n\r\n"I think I should take her to some place on the seashore in England,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"Custins is close to the sea," he replied. "It is Lord Cantrip\'s\r\nplace in Dorsetshire. It was partly settled that she was to go\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"I suppose she likes Lady Cantrip."\r\n\r\n"Why should she not?"\r\n\r\n"She has not said a word to me to the contrary. I only fear she would\r\nfeel that she was being sent there,--as to a convent."\r\n\r\n"What ought I to do then?"\r\n\r\n"How can I venture to answer that? What she would like best, I think,\r\nwould be to return to Matching with you, and to settle down in a\r\nquiet way for the winter." The Duke shook his head. That would be\r\nworse than travelling. She would still have headaches and still tell\r\nhim that she was unhappy. "Of course I do not know what your plans\r\nare, and pray believe me that I should not obtrude my advice if you\r\ndid not ask me."\r\n\r\n"I know it," he said. "I know how good you are and how reasonable. I\r\nknow how much you have to forgive."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no."\r\n\r\n"And, if I have not said so as I should have done, it has not been\r\nfrom want of feeling. I do believe you did what you thought best when\r\nMary told you that story at Matching."\r\n\r\n"Why should your Grace go back to that?"\r\n\r\n"Only that I may acknowledge my indebtedness to you, and say to you\r\nsomewhat fuller than I could do in my letter that I am sorry for the\r\npain which I gave you."\r\n\r\n"All that is over now,--and shall be forgotten."\r\n\r\nThen he spoke of his immediate plans. He would at once go back to\r\nEngland by slow stages,--by very slow stages,--staying a day or two\r\nat Salzburg, at Ratisbon, at Nuremberg, at Frankfort, and so on. In\r\nthis way he would reach England about the 10th of October, and Mary\r\nwould then be ready to go to Custins by the time appointed.\r\n\r\nIn a day or two Lady Mary was better. "It is terrible while it\r\nlasts," she said, speaking to Mrs. Finn of her headache, "but when it\r\nhas gone then I am quite well. Only"--she added after a pause--"only\r\nI can never be happy again while papa thinks as he does now." Then\r\nthere was a party made up before they separated for an excursion to\r\nthe Hintersee and the Obersee. On this occasion Lady Mary seemed to\r\nenjoy herself, as she liked the companionship of Mrs. Finn. Against\r\nLady Cantrip she never said a word. But Lady Cantrip was always a\r\nduenna to her, whereas Mrs. Finn was a friend. While the Duke and\r\nPhineas were discussing politics together--thoroughly enjoying the\r\nweakness of Lord Drummond and the iniquity of Sir Timothy--which they\r\ndid with augmented vehemence from their ponies\' backs, the two women\r\nin lower voices talked over their own affairs. "I dare say you will\r\nbe happy at Custins," said Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"No; I shall not. There will be people there whom I don\'t know, and I\r\ndon\'t want to know. Have you heard anything about him, Mrs. Finn?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Finn turned round and looked at her,--for a moment almost\r\nangrily. Then her heart relented. "Do you mean--Mr. Tregear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Tregear."\r\n\r\n"I think I heard that he was shooting with Lord Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of that," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"It will be pleasant for both of them."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad they should be together. While I know that, I feel\r\nthat we are not altogether separated. I will never give it up, Mrs.\r\nFinn,--never; never. It is no use taking me to China." In that Mrs.\r\nFinn quite agreed with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nAgain at Killancodlem\r\n\r\n\r\nSilverbridge remained at Crummie-Toddie under the dominion of\r\nReginald Dobbes till the second week in September. Popplecourt,\r\nNidderdale, and Gerald Palliser were there also, very obedient, and\r\nupon the whole efficient. Tregear was intractable, occasional, and\r\nuntrustworthy. He was the cause of much trouble to Mr. Dobbes. He\r\nwould entertain a most heterodox and injurious idea that, as he had\r\ncome to Crummie-Toddie for amusement, he was not bound to do anything\r\nthat did not amuse him. He would not understand that in sport as in\r\nother matters there was an ambition, driving a man on to excel always\r\nand be ahead of others. In spite of this Mr. Dobbes had cause for\r\nmuch triumph. It was going to be the greatest thing ever done by six\r\nguns in Scotland. As for Gerald, whom he had regarded as a boy, and\r\nwho had offended him by saying that Crummie-Toddie was ugly,--he was\r\nready to go round the world for him. He had indoctrinated Gerald with\r\nall his ideas of a sportsman,--even to a contempt for champagne and a\r\nconviction that tobacco should be moderated. The three lords too had\r\nproved themselves efficient, and the thing was going to be a success.\r\nBut just when a day was of vital importance, when it was essential\r\nthat there should be a strong party for a drive, Silverbridge found\r\nit absolutely necessary that he should go over to Killancodlem.\r\n\r\n"She has gone," said Nidderdale.\r\n\r\n"Who the ---- is she?" asked Silverbridge, almost angrily.\r\n\r\n"Everybody knows who she is," said Popplecourt.\r\n\r\n"It will be a good thing when some She has got hold of you, my boy,\r\nso as to keep you in your proper place."\r\n\r\n"If you cannot withstand that sort of attraction you ought not to go\r\nin for shooting at all," said Dobbes.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder at his going," continued Nidderdale, "if we\r\ndidn\'t all know that the American is no longer there. She has gone\r\nto--Bath I think they say."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it\'s Mrs. Jones herself," said Popplecourt.\r\n\r\n"My dear boys," said Silverbridge, "you may be quite sure that when\r\nI say that I am going to Killancodlem I mean to go to Killancodlem,\r\nand that no chaff about young ladies,--which I think very\r\ndisgusting,--will stop me. I shall be sorry if Dobbes\'s roll of\r\nthe killed should be lessened by a single hand, seeing that his\r\nambition sets that way. Considering the amount of slaughter we have\r\nperpetrated, I really think that we need not be over anxious." After\r\nthis nothing further was said. Tregear, who knew that Mabel Grex was\r\nstill at Killancodlem, had not spoken.\r\n\r\nIn truth Mabel had sent for Lord Silverbridge, and this had been her\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR LORD SILVERBRIDGE,\r\n\r\n   Mrs. Montacute Jones is cut to the heart because you have\r\n   not been over to see her again, and she says that it is\r\n   lamentable to think that such a man as Reginald Dobbes\r\n   should have so much power over you. "Only twelve miles,"\r\n   she says, "and he knows that we are here!" I told her that\r\n   you knew Miss Boncassen was gone.\r\n\r\n   But though Miss Boncassen has left us we are a very\r\n   pleasant party, and surely you must be tired of such a\r\n   place as Crummie-Toddie. If only for the sake of getting a\r\n   good dinner once in a way do come over again. I shall be\r\n   here yet for ten days. As they will not let me go back to\r\n   Grex I don\'t know where I could be more happy. I have been\r\n   asked to go to Custins, and suppose I shall turn up there\r\n   some time in the autumn.\r\n\r\n   And now shall I tell you what I expect? I do expect\r\n   that you will come over to--see me. "I did see her the\r\n   other day," you will say, "and she did not make herself\r\n   pleasant." I know that. How was I to make myself pleasant\r\n   when I found myself so completely snuffed out by your\r\n   American beauty? Now she is away, and Richard will be\r\n   himself. Do come, because in truth I want to see you.\r\n\r\n   Yours always sincerely,\r\n\r\n   MABEL GREX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn receiving this he at once made up his mind to go to Killancodlem,\r\nbut he could not make up his mind why it was that she had asked him.\r\nHe was sure of two things; sure in the first place that she had\r\nintended to let him know that she did not care about him; and then\r\nsure that she was aware of his intention in regard to Miss Boncassen.\r\nEverybody at Killancodlem had seen it,--to his disgust; but still\r\nthat it was so had been manifest. And he had consoled himself,\r\nfeeling that it would matter nothing should he be accepted. She had\r\nmade an attempt to talk him out of his purpose. Could it be that she\r\nthought it possible a second attempt might be successful? If so, she\r\ndid not know him.\r\n\r\nShe had in truth thought not only that this, but that something\r\nfurther than this, might be possible. Of course the prize loomed\r\nlarger before her eyes as the prospects of obtaining it became less.\r\nShe could not doubt that he had intended to offer her his hand when\r\nhe had spoken to her of his love in London. Then she had stopped\r\nhim;--had "spared him," as she had told her friend. Certainly she had\r\nthen been swayed by some feeling that it would be ungenerous in her\r\nto seize greedily the first opportunity he had given her. But he had\r\nagain made an effort. He surely would not have sent her the ring had\r\nhe not intended her to regard him as her lover. When she received\r\nthe ring her heart had beat very high. Then she had sent that little\r\nnote, saying that she would keep it till she could give it to his\r\nwife. When she wrote that she had intended the ring should be her\r\nown. And other things pressed upon her mind. Why had she been asked\r\nto the dinner at Richmond? Why was she invited to Custins? Little\r\nhints had reached her of the Duke\'s goodwill towards her. If on that\r\nside the marriage were approved, why should she destroy her own\r\nhopes?\r\n\r\nThen she had seen him with Miss Boncassen, and in her pique had\r\nforced the ring back upon him. During that long game on the lawn her\r\nfeelings had been very bitter. Of course the girl was the lovelier\r\nof the two. All the world was raving of her beauty. And there was\r\nno doubt as to the charm of her wit and manner. And then she had\r\nno touch of that blase used-up way of life of which Lady Mabel was\r\nconscious herself. It was natural that it should be so. And was she,\r\nMabel Grex, the girl to stand in his way and to force herself upon\r\nhim, if he loved another? Certainly not,--though there might be a\r\ntriple ducal coronet to be had.\r\n\r\nBut were there not other considerations? Could it be well that the\r\nheir of the house of Omnium should marry an American girl, as to\r\nwhose humble birth whispers were already afloat? As his friend, would\r\nit not be right that she should tell him what the world would say? As\r\nhis friend, therefore, she had given him her counsel.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone the whole thing weighed heavily upon her mind. Why\r\nshould she lose the prize if it might still be her own? To be Duchess\r\nof Omnium! She had read of many of the other sex, and of one or two\r\nof her own, who by settled resolution had achieved greatness in\r\nopposition to all obstacles. Was this thing beyond her reach? To hunt\r\nhim, and catch him, and marry him to his own injury,--that would be\r\nimpossible to her. She was sure of herself there. But how infinitely\r\nbetter would this be for him! Would she not have all his family with\r\nher,--and all the world of England? In how short a time would he not\r\nrepent his marriage with Miss Boncassen! Whereas, were she his wife,\r\nshe would so stir herself for his joys, for his good, for his honour,\r\nthat there should be no possibility of repentance. And he certainly\r\nhad loved her. Why else had he followed her, and spoken such words to\r\nher? Of course he had loved her! But then there had come this blaze\r\nof beauty and had carried off,--not his heart but his imagination.\r\nBecause he had yielded to such fascination, was she to desert him,\r\nand also to desert herself? From day to day she thought of it, and\r\nthen she wrote that letter. She hardly knew what she would do, what\r\nshe might say; but she would trust to the opportunity to do and say\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n"If you have no room for me," he said to Mrs. Jones, "you must scold\r\nLady Mab. She has told me that you told her to invite me."\r\n\r\n"Of course I did. Do you think I would not sleep in the stables, and\r\ngive you up my own bed if there were no other? It is so good of you\r\nto come!"\r\n\r\n"So good of you, Mrs. Jones, to ask me."\r\n\r\n"So very kind to come when all the attraction has gone!" Then he\r\nblushed and stammered, and was just able to say that his only object\r\nin life was to pour out his adoration at the feet of Mrs. Montacute\r\nJones herself.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain Lady Fawn,--a pretty mincing married woman\r\nof about twenty-five, with a husband much older, who liked mild\r\nflirtations with mild young men. "I am afraid we\'ve lost your great\r\nattraction," she whispered to him.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not as long as Lady Fawn is here," he said, seating\r\nhimself close to her on a garden bench, and seizing suddenly hold\r\nof her hand. She gave a little scream and a jerk, and so relieved\r\nherself from him. "You see," said he, "people do make such mistakes\r\nabout a man\'s feelings."\r\n\r\n"Lord Silverbridge!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s quite true, but I\'ll tell you all about it another time," and\r\nso he left her. All these little troubles, his experience in the\r\n"House," the necessity of snubbing Tifto, the choice of a wife, and\r\nhis battle with Reginald Dobbes, were giving him by degrees age and\r\nflavour.\r\n\r\nLady Mabel had fluttered about him on his first coming, and had been\r\nvery gracious, doing the part of an old friend. "There is to be a big\r\nshooting to-morrow," she said, in the presence of Mrs. Jones.\r\n\r\n"If it is to come to that," he said, "I might as well go back to\r\nDobbydom."\r\n\r\n"You may shoot if you like," said Lady Mabel.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t even brought a gun with me."\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll have a walk,--a whole lot of us," she said.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, about an hour before dinner, Silverbridge and Lady\r\nMabel were seated together on the bank of a little stream which ran\r\non the other side of the road, but on a spot not more than a furlong\r\nfrom the hall-door. She had brought him there, but she had done so\r\nwithout any definite scheme. She had made no plan of campaign for the\r\nevening, having felt relieved when she found herself able to postpone\r\nthe project of her attack till the morrow. Of course there must be\r\nan attack, but how it should be made she had never had the courage\r\nto tell herself. The great women of the world, the Semiramises, the\r\nPocahontas, the Ida Pfeiffers, and the Charlotte Cordays, had never\r\nbeen wanting to themselves when the moment for action came. Now she\r\nwas pleased to have this opportunity added to her; this pleasant\r\nminute in which some soft preparatory word might be spoken; but the\r\ngreat effort should be made on the morrow.\r\n\r\n"Is not this nicer than shooting with Mr. Dobbes?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"A great deal nicer. Of course I am bound to say so."\r\n\r\n"But in truth, I want to find out what you really like. Men are so\r\ndifferent. You need not pay me any compliment; you know that well\r\nenough."\r\n\r\n"I like you better than Dobbes,--if you mean that."\r\n\r\n"Even so much is something."\r\n\r\n"But I am fond of shooting."\r\n\r\n"Only a man may have enough of it."\r\n\r\n"Too much, if he is subject to Dobbes, as Dobbes likes them to be.\r\nGerald likes it."\r\n\r\n"Did you think it odd," she said after a pause, "that I should ask\r\nyou to come over again?"\r\n\r\n"Was it odd?" he replied.\r\n\r\n"That is as you may take it. There is certainly no other man in the\r\nworld to whom I would have done it."\r\n\r\n"Not to Tregear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said; "yes,--to Tregear, could I have been as sure of a\r\nwelcome for him as I am for you. Frank is in all respects the same as\r\na brother to me. That would not have seemed odd;--I mean to myself."\r\n\r\n"And has this been--odd,--to yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Not that anybody else has felt it so. Only I,--and perhaps you.\r\nYou felt it so?"\r\n\r\n"Not especially. I thought you were a very good fellow. I have always\r\nthought that;--except when you made me take back the ring."\r\n\r\n"Does that still fret you?"\r\n\r\n"No man likes to take back a thing. It makes him seem to have been\r\nawkward and stupid in giving it."\r\n\r\n"It was the value--"\r\n\r\n"You should have left me to judge of that."\r\n\r\n"If I have offended you I will beg your pardon. Give me anything\r\nelse, anything but that, and I will take it."\r\n\r\n"But why not that?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Now that you have fitted it for a lady\'s finger it should go to your\r\nwife. No one else should have it."\r\n\r\nUpon this he brought the ring once more out of his pocket and again\r\noffered it to her. "No; anything but that. That your wife must have."\r\nThen he put the ring back again. "It would have been nicer for you\r\nhad Miss Boncassen been here." In saying this she followed no plan.\r\nIt came rather from pique. It was almost as though she had asked him\r\nwhether Miss Boncassen was to have the ring.\r\n\r\n"What makes you say that?"\r\n\r\n"But it would."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it would," he replied stoutly, turning round as he lay on the\r\nground and facing her.\r\n\r\n"Has it come to that?"\r\n\r\n"Come to what? You ask me a question and I answer you truly."\r\n\r\n"You cannot be happy without her?"\r\n\r\n"I did not say so. You ask me whether I should like to have her\r\nhere,--and I say Yes. What would you think of me if I said No?"\r\n\r\n"My being here is not enough?" This should not have been said, of\r\ncourse, but the little speech came from the exquisite pain of the\r\nmoment. She had meant to have said hardly anything. She had intended\r\nto be happy with him, just touching lightly on things which might\r\nlead to that attack which must be made on the morrow. But words\r\nwill often lead whither the speaker has not intended. So it was now,\r\nand in the soreness of her heart she spoke. "My being here is not\r\nenough?"\r\n\r\n"It would be enough," he said, jumping on his feet, "if you\r\nunderstood all, and would be kind to me."\r\n\r\n"I will at any rate be kind to you," she replied, as she sat upon the\r\nbank looking at the running water.\r\n\r\n"I have asked Miss Boncassen to be my wife."\r\n\r\n"And she has accepted?"\r\n\r\n"No; not as yet. She is to take three months to think of it. Of\r\ncourse I love her best of all. If you will sympathise with me in\r\nthat, then I will be as happy with you as the day is long."\r\n\r\n"No," said she, "I cannot. I will not."\r\n\r\n"Very well."\r\n\r\n"There should be no such marriage. If you have told me in\r\nconfidence--"\r\n\r\n"Of course I have told you in confidence."\r\n\r\n"It will go no farther; but there can be no sympathy between us.\r\nIt--it--it is not,--is not--" Then she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"Mabel!"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, no; no! What did you mean? But never mind. I have no\r\nquestions to ask, not a word to say. Why should I? Only this,--that\r\nsuch a marriage will disgrace your family. To me it is no more than\r\nto anybody else. But it will disgrace your family."\r\n\r\nHow she got back to the house she hardly knew; nor did he. That\r\nevening they did not again speak to each other, and on the following\r\nmorning there was no walk to the mountains. Before dinner he drove\r\nhimself back to Crummie-Toddie, and when he was taking his leave she\r\nshook hands with him with her usual pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nWhat Happened at Doncaster\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Leger this year was to be run on the 14th September, and while\r\nLord Silverbridge was amusing himself with the deer at Crummie-Toddie\r\nand at Killancodlem with the more easily pursued young ladies, the\r\nindefatigable Major was hard at work in the stables. This came a\r\nlittle hard on him. There was the cub-hunting to be looked after,\r\nwhich made his presence at Runnymede necessary, and then that\r\n"pig-headed fellow, Silverbridge" would not have the horses trained\r\nanywhere but at Newmarket. How was he to be in two places at once?\r\nYet he was in two places almost at once: cub-hunting in the morning\r\nat Egham and Bagshot, and sitting on the same evening at the\r\nstable-door at Newmarket, with his eyes fixed upon Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nGradually had he and Captain Green come to understand each other, and\r\nthough they did at last understand each other, Tifto would talk as\r\nthough there were no such correct intelligence;--when for instance he\r\nwould abuse Lord Silverbridge for being pig-headed. On such occasions\r\nthe Captain\'s remark would generally be short. "That be blowed!"\r\nhe would say, implying that that state of things between the two\r\npartners, in which such complaints might be natural, had now been\r\nbrought to an end. But on one occasion, about a week before the race,\r\nhe spoke out a little plainer. "What\'s the use of your going on with\r\nall that before me? It\'s settled what you\'ve got to do."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that anything is settled," said the Major.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t it? I thought it was. If it ain\'t you\'ll find yourself in the\r\nwrong box. You\'ve as straight a tip as a man need wish for, but if\r\nyou back out you\'ll come to grief. Your money\'s all on the other way\r\nalready."\r\n\r\nOn the Friday before the race Silverbridge dined with Tifto at the\r\nBeargarden. On the next morning they went down to Newmarket to see\r\nthe horse get a gallop, and came back the same evening. During all\r\nthis time, Tifto was more than ordinarily pleasant to his patron. The\r\nhorse and the certainty of the horse\'s success were the only subjects\r\nmooted. "It isn\'t what I say," repeated Tifto, "but look at the\r\nbetting. You can\'t get five to four against him. They tell me that\r\nif you want to do anything on the Sunday the pull will be the other\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"I stand to lose over L20,000 already," said Silverbridge, almost\r\nfrightened by the amount.\r\n\r\n"But how much are you on to win?" said Tifto. "I suppose you could\r\nsell your bets for L5,000 down."\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew how to do it," said Silverbridge. But this was an\r\narrangement, which, if made just now, would not suit the Major\'s\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nThey went to Newmarket, and there they met Captain Green. "Tifto,"\r\nsaid the young Lord, "I won\'t have that fellow with us when the horse\r\nis galloping."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t an honester man, or a man who understands a horse\'s\r\npaces better in all England," said Tifto.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t have him standing alongside of me on the Heath," said his\r\nLordship.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how I\'m to help it."\r\n\r\n"If he\'s there I\'ll send the horse in;--that\'s all." Then Tifto\r\nfound it best to say a few words to Captain Green. But the Captain\r\nalso said a few words to himself. "D---- young fool; he don\'t know\r\nwhat he\'s dropping into." Which assertion, if you lay aside the\r\nunnecessary expletive, was true to the letter. Lord Silverbridge was\r\na young fool, and did not at all know into what a mess he was being\r\ndropped by the united experience, perspicuity, and energy of the man\r\nwhose company on the Heath he had declined.\r\n\r\nThe horse was quite a "picture to look at." Mr. Pook the trainer\r\nassured his Lordship that for health and condition he had never seen\r\nanything better. "Stout all over," said Mr. Pook, "and not an ounce\r\nof what you may call flesh. And bright! just feel his coat, my Lord!\r\nThat\'s \'ealth,--that is; not dressing, nor yet macassar!"\r\n\r\nAnd then there were various evidences produced of his pace,--how he\r\nhad beaten that horse, giving him two pounds; how he had been beaten\r\nby that, but only on a mile course; the Leger distance was just the\r\nthing for Prime Minister; how by a lucky chance that marvellous quick\r\nrat of a thing that had won the Derby had not been entered for the\r\nautumn race; how Coalheaver was known to have had bad feet. "He\'s a\r\nstout \'orse, no doubt,--is the \'Eaver," said Mr. Pook, "and that\'s\r\nwhy the betting-men have stuck to him. But he\'ll be nowhere on\r\nWednesday. They\'re beginning to see it now, my Lord. I wish they\r\nwasn\'t so sharp-sighted."\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day, however, they met a gentleman who was of a\r\ndifferent opinion. He said loudly that he looked on the Heaver as the\r\nbest three-year-old in England. Of course as matters stood he wasn\'t\r\ngoing to back the Heaver at even money;--but he\'d take twenty-five\r\nto thirty in hundreds between the two. All this ended in the bet\r\nbeing accepted and duly booked by Lord Silverbridge. And in this\r\nway Silverbridge added two thousand four hundred pounds to his\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nBut there was worse than this coming. On the Sunday afternoon he went\r\ndown to Doncaster, of course in company with the Major. He was alive\r\nto the necessity of ridding himself of the Major; but it had been\r\nacknowledged that that duty could not be performed till after this\r\nrace had been run. As he sat opposite to his friend on their journey\r\nto Doncaster, he thought of this in the train. It should be done\r\nimmediately on their return to London after the race. But the horse,\r\nhis Prime Minister, was by this time so dear to him that he intended\r\nif possible to keep possession of the animal.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Doncaster the racing-men were all occupied with\r\nPrime Minister. The horse and Mr. Pook had arrived that day from\r\nNewmarket, via Cambridge and Peterborough. Tifto, Silverbridge,\r\nand Mr. Pook visited him together three times that afternoon and\r\nevening;--and the Captain also visited the horse, though not in\r\ncompany with Lord Silverbridge. To do Mr. Pook justice, no one could\r\nbe more careful. When the Captain came round with the Major, Mr. Pook\r\nwas there. But Captain Green did not enter the box,--had no wish to\r\ndo so, was of opinion that on such occasions no one whose business\r\ndid not carry him there should go near a horse. His only object\r\nseemed to be to compliment Mr. Pook as to his care, skill, and good\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nIt was on the Tuesday evening that the chief mischief was done. There\r\nwas a club at which many of the racing-men dined, and there Lord\r\nSilverbridge spent his evening. He was the hero of the hour, and\r\neverybody flattered him. It must be acknowledged that his head was\r\nturned. They dined at eight and much wine was drunk. No one was\r\ntipsy, but many were elated; and much confidence in their favourite\r\nanimals was imparted to men who had been sufficiently cautious before\r\ndinner. Then cigars and soda-and-brandy became common and our young\r\nfriend was not more abstemious than others. Large sums were named,\r\nand at last in three successive bets Lord Silverbridge backed his\r\nhorse for more than forty thousand pounds. As he was making the\r\nsecond bet Mr. Lupton came across to him and begged him to hold his\r\nhand. "It will be a nasty sum for you to lose, and winning it will be\r\nnothing to you," he said. Silverbridge took it good-humouredly, but\r\nsaid that he knew what he was about. "These men will pay," whispered\r\nLupton; "but you can\'t be quite sure what they\'re at." The young\r\nman\'s brow was covered with perspiration. He was smoking quick and\r\nhad already smoked more than was good for him. "All right," he said.\r\n"I\'ll mind what I\'m about." Mr. Lupton could do no more, and retired.\r\nBefore the night was over bets had been booked to the amount stated,\r\nand the Duke\'s son, who had promised that he would never plunge,\r\nstood to lose about seventy thousand pounds upon the race.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on Tifto sat not far from his patron, but\r\ncompletely silent. During the day and early in the evening a few\r\nsparks of the glory which scintillated from the favourite horse flew\r\nin his direction. But he was on this occasion unlike himself, and\r\nthough the horse was to be run in his name had very little to say in\r\nthe matter. Not a boast came out of his mouth during dinner or after\r\ndinner. He was so moody that his partner, who was generally anxious\r\nto keep him quiet, more than once endeavoured to encourage him. But\r\nhe was unable to rouse himself. It was still within his power to run\r\nstraight; to be on the square, if not with Captain Green, at any rate\r\nwith Lord Silverbridge. But to do so he must make a clean breast\r\nwith his Lordship and confess the intended sin. As he heard all that\r\nwas being done, his conscience troubled him sorely. With pitch of\r\nthis sort he had never soiled himself before. He was to have three\r\nthousand pounds from Green, and then there would be the bets he\r\nhimself had laid against the horse,--by Green\'s assistance! It would\r\nbe the making of him. Of what use had been all his "square" work to\r\nhim? And then Silverbridge had behaved so badly to him! But still, as\r\nhe sat there during the evening, he would have given a hand to have\r\nbeen free from the attempt. He had had no conception before that he\r\ncould become subject to such misery from such a cause. He would make\r\nit straight with Silverbridge this very night,--but that Silverbridge\r\nwas ever lighting fresh cigars and ever having his glass refilled. It\r\nwas clear to him that on this night Silverbridge could not be made\r\nto understand anything about it. And the deed in which he himself\r\nwas to be the chief actor was to be done very early in the following\r\nmorning. At last he slunk away to bed.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, the morning of the day on which the race\r\nwas to be run, the Major tapped at his patron\'s door about seven\r\no\'clock. Of course there was no answer, though the knock was\r\nrepeated. When young men overnight drink as much brandy-and-water\r\nas Silverbridge had done, and smoke as many cigars, they are apt\r\nnot to hear knocks at their door made at seven o\'clock. Nor was his\r\nLordship\'s servant up,--so that Tifto had no means of getting at him\r\nexcept by personal invasion of the sanctity of his bedroom. But there\r\nwas no time, not a minute, to be lost. Now, within this minute that\r\nwas pressing on him, Tifto must choose his course. He opened the door\r\nand was standing at the young man\'s head.\r\n\r\n"What the d---- does this mean?" said his Lordship angrily, as soon\r\nas his visitor had succeeded in waking him. Tifto muttered something\r\nabout the horse which Silverbridge failed to understand. The young\r\nman\'s condition was by no means pleasant. His mouth was furred by the\r\nfumes of tobacco. His head was aching. He was heavy with sleep, and\r\nthis intrusion seemed to him to be a final indignity offered to him\r\nby the man whom he now hated. "What business have you to come in\r\nhere?" he said, leaning on his elbow. "I don\'t care a straw for the\r\nhorse. If you have anything to say send my servant. Get out!"\r\n\r\n"Oh;--very well," said Tifto;--and Tifto got out.\r\n\r\nIt was about an hour afterwards that Tifto returned, and on this\r\noccasion a groom from the stables, and the young Lord\'s own servant,\r\nand two or three other men were with him. Tifto had been made to\r\nunderstand that the news now to be communicated, must be communicated\r\nby himself, whether his Lordship were angry or not. Indeed, after\r\nwhat had been done his Lordship\'s anger was not of much moment. In\r\nhis present visit he was only carrying out the pleasant little plan\r\nwhich had been arranged for him by Captain Green. "What the mischief\r\nis up?" said Silverbridge, rising in his bed.\r\n\r\nThen Tifto told his story, sullenly, doggedly, but still in a\r\nperspicuous manner, and with words which admitted of no doubt. But\r\nbefore he told the story he had excluded all but himself and the\r\ngroom. He and the groom had taken the horse out of the stable,\r\nit being the animal\'s nature to eat his corn better after slight\r\nexercise, and while doing so a nail had been picked up.\r\n\r\n"Is it much?" asked Silverbridge, jumping still higher in his bed.\r\nThen he was told that it was very much,--that the iron had driven\r\nitself into the horse\'s frog, and that there was actually no\r\npossibility that the horse should run on that day.\r\n\r\n"He can\'t walk, my Lord," said the groom, in that authoritative voice\r\nwhich grooms use when they desire to have their own way, and to\r\nmake their masters understand that they at any rate are not to have\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\n"Where is Pook?" asked Silverbridge. But Mr. Pook was also still in\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nIt was soon known to Lord Silverbridge as a fact that in very truth\r\nthe horse could not run. Then sick with headache, with a stomach\r\nsuffering unutterable things, he had, as he dressed himself, to\r\nthink of his seventy thousand pounds. Of course the money would be\r\nforthcoming. But how would his father look at him? How would it be\r\nbetween him and his father now? After such a misfortune how would he\r\nbe able to break that other matter to the Duke, and say that he had\r\nchanged his mind about his marriage,--that he was going to abandon\r\nLady Mabel Grex, and give his hand and a future Duchess\'s coronet to\r\nan American girl whose grandfather had been a porter?\r\n\r\nA nail in his foot! Well! He had heard of such things before. He knew\r\nthat such accidents had happened. What an ass must he have been to\r\nrisk such a sum on the well-being and safety of an animal who might\r\nany day pick up a nail in his foot? Then he thought of the caution\r\nwhich Lupton had given him. What good would the money have done him\r\nhad he won it? What more could he have than he now enjoyed? But to\r\nlose such a sum of money! With all his advantages of wealth he felt\r\nhimself to be as forlorn and wretched as though he had nothing left\r\nin the world before him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nHow It Was Done\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story was soon about the town, and was the one matter for\r\ndiscussion in all racing quarters. About the town! It was about\r\nEngland, about all Europe. It had travelled to America and the\r\nIndies, to Australia and the Chinese cities before two hours were\r\nover. Before the race was run the accident was discussed and\r\nsomething like the truth surmised in Cairo, Calcutta, Melbourne, and\r\nSan Francisco. But at Doncaster it was so all-pervading a matter that\r\ndown to the tradesmen\'s daughters and the boys at the free-school\r\nthe town was divided into two parties, one party believing it to\r\nhave been a "plant," and the other holding that the cause had been\r\nnatural. It is hardly necessary to say that the ring, as a rule,\r\nbelonged to the former party. The ring always suspects. It did not\r\nbehove even those who would win by the transaction to stand up for\r\nits honesty.\r\n\r\nThe intention had been to take the horse round a portion of the\r\noutside of the course near to which his stable stood. A boy rode him\r\nand the groom and Tifto went with him. At a certain spot on their\r\nreturn Tifto had exclaimed that the horse was going lame in his\r\noff fore-foot. As to this exclamation the boy and the two men were\r\nagreed. The boy was then made to dismount and run for Mr. Pook; and\r\nas he started Tifto commenced to examine the horse\'s foot. The boy\r\nsaw him raise the off fore-leg. He himself had not found the horse\r\nlame under him, but had been so hustled and hurried out of the saddle\r\nby Tifto and the groom that he had not thought on that matter till\r\nhe was questioned. So far the story told by Tifto and the groom was\r\ncorroborated by the boy,--except as to the horse\'s actual lameness.\r\nSo far the story was believed by all men,--except in regard to the\r\nactual lameness. And so far it was true. Then, according to Tifto\r\nand the groom, the other foot was looked at, but nothing was seen.\r\nThis other foot, the near fore-foot, was examined by the groom, who\r\ndeclared himself to be so flurried by the lameness of such a horse at\r\nsuch a time, that he hardly knew what he saw or what he did not see.\r\nAt any rate then in his confusion he found no cause of lameness,\r\nbut the horse was led into the stable as lame as a tree. Here Tifto\r\nfound the nail inserted into the very cleft of the frog of the near\r\nfore-foot, and so inserted that he could not extract it till the\r\nfarrier came. That the farrier had extracted the nail from the part\r\nof the foot indicated was certainly a fact.\r\n\r\nThen there was the nail. Only those who were most peculiarly\r\nprivileged were allowed to see the nail. But it was buzzed about the\r\nracing quarters that the head of the nail,--an old rusty, straight,\r\nand well-pointed nail,--bore on it the mark of a recent hammer. In\r\nanswer to this it was alleged that the blacksmith in extracting\r\nthe nail with his pincers, had of course operated on its head, had\r\nremoved certain particles of rust, and might easily have given it the\r\nappearance of having been struck. But in answer to this the farrier,\r\nwho was a sharp fellow, and quite beyond suspicion in the matter,\r\ndeclared that he had very particularly looked at the nail before he\r\nextracted it,--had looked at it with the feeling on his mind that\r\nsomething base might too probably have been done,--and that he was\r\nready to swear that the clear mark on the head of the nail was there\r\nbefore he touched it. And then not in the stable, but lying under\r\nthe little dung-heap away from the stable-door, there was found a\r\nsmall piece of broken iron bar, about a foot long, which might have\r\nanswered for a hammer,--a rusty bit of iron; and amidst the rust of\r\nthis was found such traces as might have been left had it been used\r\nin striking such a nail. There were some who declared that neither on\r\nthe nail nor on the iron could they see anything. And among these was\r\nthe Major. But Mr. Lupton brought a strong magnifying-glass to bear,\r\nand the world of examiners was satisfied that the marks were there.\r\n\r\nIt seemed however to be agreed that nothing could be done.\r\nSilverbridge would not lend himself at all to those who suspected\r\nmischief. He was miserable enough, but in this great trouble he would\r\nnot separate himself from Tifto. "I don\'t believe a word of all\r\nthat," he said to Mr. Lupton.\r\n\r\n"It ought to be investigated at any rate," said Lupton.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pook may do as he likes, but I will have nothing to do with it."\r\n\r\nThen Tifto came to him swaggering. Tifto had to go through a\r\nconsiderable amount of acting, for which he was not very well\r\nadapted. The Captain would have done it better. He would have\r\nendeavoured to put himself altogether into the same boat with his\r\npartner, and would have imagined neither suspicion or enmity on his\r\npartner\'s part till suspicion or enmity had been shown. But Tifto,\r\nwho had not expected that the matter would be allowed to pass over\r\nwithout some inquiry, began by assuming that Silverbridge would think\r\nevil of him. Tifto, who at this moment would have given all that\r\nhe had in the world not to have done the deed, who now hated the\r\ninstigator of the deed, and felt something almost akin to love for\r\nSilverbridge, found himself to be forced by circumstances to defend\r\nhimself by swaggering. "I don\'t understand all this that\'s going on,\r\nmy Lord," he said.\r\n\r\n"Neither do I," replied Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Any horse is subject to an accident. I am, I suppose, as great a\r\nsufferer as you are, and a deuced sight less able to bear it."\r\n\r\n"Who has said anything to the contrary? As for bearing it, we must\r\ntake it as it comes,--both of us. You may as well know now as later\r\nthat I have done with racing--for ever."\r\n\r\n"What do you tell me that for? You can do as you like and I can do\r\nas I like about that. If I had had my way about the horse this never\r\nwould have happened. Taking a horse out at that time in the\r\nmorning,--before a race!"\r\n\r\n"Why, you went with him yourself."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--by Pook\'s orders. You allowed Pook to do just as he pleased. I\r\nshould like to know what money Pook has got on it, and which way he\r\nlaid it." This disgusted Silverbridge so much that he turned away and\r\nwould have no more to say to Tifto.\r\n\r\nBefore one o\'clock, at which hour it was stated nominally that the\r\nraces would commence, general opinion had formed itself,--and general\r\nopinion had nearly hit the truth. General opinion declared that the\r\nnail had been driven in wilfully,--that it had been done by Tifto\r\nhimself, and that Tifto had been instigated by Captain Green. Captain\r\nGreen perhaps over-acted his part a little. His intimacy with the\r\nMajor was well known, and yet, in all this turmoil, he kept himself\r\napart as though he had no interest in the matter. "I have got my\r\nlittle money on, and what little I have I lose," he said in answer\r\nto inquiries. But everyone knew that he could not but have a great\r\ninterest in a race, as to which the half owner of the favourite was\r\na peculiarly intimate friend of his own. Had he come down to the\r\nstables and been seen about the place with Tifto it might have been\r\nbetter. As it was, though he was very quiet, his name was soon mixed\r\nup in the matter. There was one man who asserted it as a fact known\r\nto himself that Green and Villiers,--one Gilbert Villiers,--were in\r\npartnership together. It was very well known that Gilbert Villiers\r\nwould win two thousand five hundred pounds from Lord Silverbridge.\r\n\r\nThen minute investigation was made into the betting of certain\r\nindividuals. Of course there would be great plunder, and where would\r\nthe plunder go? Who would get the money which poor Silverbridge would\r\nlose? It was said that one at least of the large bets made on that\r\nTuesday evening could be traced to the same Villiers though not\r\nactually made by him. More would be learned when the settling-day\r\nshould come. But there was quite enough already to show that there\r\nwere many men determined to get to the bottom of it all if possible.\r\n\r\nThere came upon Silverbridge in his trouble a keen sense of his\r\nposition and a feeling of the dignity which he ought to support. He\r\nclung during great part of the morning to Mr. Lupton. Mr. Lupton was\r\nmuch his senior and they had never been intimate; but now there was\r\ncomfort in his society. "I am afraid you are hit heavily," said Mr.\r\nLupton.\r\n\r\n"Something over seventy thousand pounds!"\r\n\r\n"Looking at what will be your property it is of course nothing. But\r\nif--"\r\n\r\n"If what?"\r\n\r\n"If you go to the Jews for it then it will become a great deal."\r\n\r\n"I shall certainly not do that."\r\n\r\n"Then you may regard it as a trifle," said Lupton.\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t. It is not a trifle. I must tell my father. He\'ll find\r\nthe money."\r\n\r\n"There is no doubt about that."\r\n\r\n"He will. But I feel at present that I would rather change places\r\nwith the poorest gentleman I know than have to tell him. I have done\r\nwith races, Lupton."\r\n\r\n"If so, this will have been a happy day for you. A man in your\r\nposition can hardly make money by it, but he may lose so much! If a\r\nman really likes the amusement,--as I do,--and risks no more than\r\nwhat he has in his pocket, that may be very well."\r\n\r\n"At any rate I have done with it."\r\n\r\nNevertheless he went to see the race run, and everybody seemed to be\r\ntouched with pity for him. He carried himself well, saying as little\r\nas he could of his own horse, and taking, or affecting to take, great\r\ninterest in the race. After the race he managed to see all those to\r\nwhom he had lost heavy stakes,--having to own to himself, as he did\r\nso, that not one of them was a gentleman to whom he should like to\r\ngive his hand. To them he explained that his father was abroad,--that\r\nprobably his liabilities could not be settled till after his father\'s\r\nreturn. He however would consult his father\'s agent and would\r\nthen appear on settling-day. They were all full of the blandest\r\ncourtesies. There was not one of them who had any doubt as to getting\r\nhis money,--unless the whole thing might be disputed on the score of\r\nTifto\'s villany. Even then payment could not be disputed, unless it\r\nwas proved that he who demanded the money had been one of the actual\r\nconspirators. After having seen his creditors he went away up alone\r\nto London.\r\n\r\nWhen in London he went to Carlton Terrace and spent the night in\r\nabsolute solitude. It had been his plan to join Gerald for some\r\npartridge-shooting at Matching, and then to go yachting till such\r\ntime as he should be enabled to renew his suit to Miss Boncassen.\r\nEarly in November he would again ask her to be his wife. These\r\nhad been his plans. But now it seemed that everything was changed.\r\nPartridge-shooting and yachting must be out of the question till this\r\nterrible load was taken off his shoulders. Soon after his arrival at\r\nthe house two telegrams followed him from Doncaster. One was from\r\nGerald. "What is all this about Prime Minister? Is it a sell? I am so\r\nunhappy." The other was from Lady Mabel,--for among other luxuries\r\nMrs. Montacute Jones had her own telegraph-wire at Killancodlem. "Can\r\nthis be true? We are all so miserable. I do hope it is not much."\r\nFrom which he learned that his misfortune was already known to all\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\nAnd now what was he to do? He ate his supper, and then without\r\nhesitating for a moment,--feeling that if he did hesitate the task\r\nwould not be done on that night,--he sat down and wrote the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Carlton Terrace, Sept. 14, 18--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR. MORETON,\r\n\r\n   I have just come up from Doncaster. You have probably\r\n   heard what has been Prime Minister\'s fate. I don\'t know\r\n   whether any horse has ever been such a favourite for the\r\n   Leger. Early in the morning he was taken out and picked up\r\n   a nail. The consequence was he could not run.\r\n\r\n   Now I must come to the bad part of my story. I have lost\r\n   seventy thousand pounds! It is no use beating about the\r\n   bush. The sum is something over that. What am I to do? If\r\n   I tell you that I shall give up racing altogether I dare\r\n   say you will not believe me. It is a sort of thing a man\r\n   always says when he wants money; but I feel now I cannot\r\n   help saying it.\r\n\r\n   But what shall I do? Perhaps, if it be not too much\r\n   trouble, you will come up to town and see me. You can send\r\n   me a word by the wires.\r\n\r\n   You may be sure of this, I shall make no attempt to raise\r\n   the money elsewhere, unless I find that my father will not\r\n   help me. You will understand that of course it must be\r\n   paid. You will understand also what I must feel about\r\n   telling my father, but I shall do so at once. I only wait\r\n   till I can hear from you.\r\n\r\n   Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n   SILVERBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next day two despatches reached Lord Silverbridge, both of\r\nthem coming as he sat down to his solitary dinner. The first\r\nconsisted of a short but very civil note.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Messrs. Comfort and Criball present their compliments to\r\n   the Earl of Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n   Messrs. C. and C. beg to offer their apologies for\r\n   interfering, but desire to inform his Lordship that should\r\n   cash be wanting to any amount in consequence of the late\r\n   races, they will be happy to accommodate his Lordship\r\n   on most reasonable terms at a moment\'s notice, upon his\r\n   Lordship\'s single bond.\r\n\r\n   Lord Silverbridge may be sure of absolute secrecy.\r\n\r\n   Crasham Court, Crutched Friars, Sept. 15, 18--.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other despatch was a telegram from Mr. Moreton saying that he\r\nwould be in Carlton Terrace by noon on the following day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\n"There Shall Not Be Another Word About It"\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in October the Duke was at Matching with his daughter, and\r\nPhineas Finn and his wife were both with them. On the day after they\r\nparted at Ischl the first news respecting Prime Minister had reached\r\nhim,--namely, that his son\'s horse had lost the race. This would not\r\nhave annoyed him at all, but that the papers which he read contained\r\nsome vague charge of swindling against somebody, and hinted that Lord\r\nSilverbridge had been a victim. Even this would not have troubled\r\nhim,--might in some sort have comforted him,--were it not made\r\nevident to him that his son had been closely associated with\r\nswindlers in these transactions. If it were a mere question of money,\r\nthat might be settled without difficulty. Even though the sum lost\r\nmight have grown out of what he might have expected into some few\r\nthousands, still he would bear it without a word, if only he could\r\nseparate his boy from bad companions. Then came Mr. Moreton\'s letter\r\ntelling the whole.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting which took place between Silverbridge and his father\'s\r\nagent at Carlton Terrace it was settled that Mr. Moreton should write\r\nthe letter. Silverbridge tried and found that he could not do it. He\r\ndid not know how to humiliate himself sufficiently, and yet could\r\nnot keep himself from making attempts to prove that according to all\r\nrecognised chances his bets had been good bets.\r\n\r\nMr. Moreton was better able to accomplish the task. He knew the\r\nDuke\'s mind. A very large discretion had been left in Mr. Moreton\'s\r\nhands in regard to moneys which might be needed on behalf of\r\nthat dangerous heir!--so large that he had been able to tell\r\nLord Silverbridge that if the money was in truth lost according\r\nto Jockey Club rules, it should all be forthcoming on the\r\nsettling-day,--certainly without assistance from Messrs. Comfort and\r\nCriball. The Duke had been nervously afraid of such men of business\r\nas Comfort and Criball, and from the earliest days of his son\'s\r\nsemi-manhood had been on his guard against them. Let any sacrifice be\r\nmade so that his son might be kept clear from Comforts and Criballs.\r\nTo Mr. Moreton he had been very explicit. His own pecuniary resources\r\nwere so great that they could bear some ravaging without serious\r\ndetriment. It was for his son\'s character and standing in the world,\r\nfor his future respectability and dignity, that his fears were so\r\nkeen, and not for his own money. By one so excitable, so fond of\r\npleasure as Lord Silverbridge, some ravaging would probably be made.\r\nLet it be met by ready money. Such had been the Duke\'s instructions\r\nto his own trusted man of business, and, acting on these\r\ninstructions, Mr. Moreton was able to tell the heir that the money\r\nshould be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nMr. Moreton, after detailing the extent and the nature of the loss,\r\nand the steps which he had decided upon taking, went on to explain\r\nthe circumstances as best he could. He had made some inquiry, and\r\nfelt no doubt that a gigantic swindle had been perpetrated by Major\r\nTifto and others. The swindle had been successful. Mr. Moreton had\r\nconsulted certain gentlemen of high character versed in affairs of\r\nthe turf. He mentioned Mr. Lupton among others,--and had been assured\r\nthat though the swindle was undoubted, the money had better be paid.\r\nIt was thought to be impossible to connect the men who had made the\r\nbets with the perpetrators of the fraud;--and if Lord Silverbridge\r\nwere to abstain from paying his bets because his own partner had\r\nruined the animal which belonged to them jointly, the feeling would\r\nbe against him rather than in his favour. In fact the Jockey Club\r\ncould not sustain him in such refusal. Therefore the money would be\r\npaid. Mr. Moreton, with some expressions of doubt, trusted that he\r\nmight be thought to have exercised a wise discretion. Then he went\r\non to express his own opinion in regard to the lasting effect which\r\nthe matter would have upon the young man. "I think," said he, "that\r\nhis Lordship is heartily sickened of racing, and that he will never\r\nreturn to it."\r\n\r\nThe Duke was of course very wretched when these tidings first reached\r\nhim. Though he was a rich man, and of all men the least careful of\r\nhis riches, still he felt that seventy thousand pounds was a large\r\nsum of money to throw away among a nest of swindlers. And then it was\r\nexcessively grievous to him that his son should have been mixed up\r\nwith such men. Wishing to screen his son, even from his own anger, he\r\nwas careful to remember that the promise made that Tifto should be\r\ndismissed, was not to take effect till after this race had been run.\r\nThere had been no deceit in that. But then Silverbridge had promised\r\nthat he would not "plunge." There are, however, promises which from\r\ntheir very nature may be broken without falsehood. Plunging is a\r\ndoubtful word, and the path down to it, like all doubtful paths,--is\r\nslippery and easy! If that assurance with which Mr. Moreton ended his\r\nletter could only be made true, he could bring himself to forgive\r\neven this offence. The boy must be made to settle himself in life.\r\nThe Duke resolved that his only revenge should be to press on that\r\nmarriage with Mabel Grex.\r\n\r\nAt Coblenz, on their way home, the Duke and his daughter were caught\r\nup by Mr. and Mrs. Finn, and the matter of the young man\'s losses\r\nwas discussed. Phineas had heard all about it, and was loud in\r\ndenunciations against Tifto, Captain Green, Gilbert Villiers, and\r\nothers whose names had reached him. The money, he thought, should\r\nnever have been paid. The Duke however declared that the money would\r\nnot cause a moment\'s regret, if only the whole thing could be got rid\r\nof at that cost. It had reached Finn\'s ears that Tifto was already at\r\nloggerheads with his associates. There was some hope that the whole\r\nthing might be brought to light by this means. For all that the Duke\r\ncared nothing. If only Silverbridge and Tifto could for the future be\r\nkept apart, as far as he and his were concerned, good would have been\r\ndone rather than harm. While they were in this way together on the\r\nRhine it was decided that very soon after their return to England\r\nPhineas and Mrs. Finn should go down to Matching.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke arrived in London his sons were not there. Gerald had\r\ngone back to Oxford, and Silverbridge had merely left an address.\r\nThen his sister wrote him a very short letter. "Papa will be so\r\nglad if you will come to Matching. Do come." Of course he came, and\r\npresented himself some few days after the Duke\'s arrival.\r\n\r\nBut he dreaded this meeting with his father which, however, let it be\r\npostponed for ever so long, must come at last. In reference to this\r\nhe made a great resolution,--that he would go instantly as soon as he\r\nmight be sent for. When the summons came he started; but, though he\r\nwas by courtesy an Earl, and by fact was not only a man but a Member\r\nof Parliament, though he was half engaged to marry one young lady and\r\nought to have been engaged to marry another, though he had come to an\r\nage at which Pitt was a great minister and Pope a great poet, still\r\nhis heart was in his boots, as a schoolboy\'s might be, when he was\r\ndriven up to the house at Matching.\r\n\r\nIn two minutes, before he had washed the dust from his face and\r\nhands, he was with his father. "I am glad to see you, Silverbridge,"\r\nsaid the Duke, putting out his hand.\r\n\r\n"I hope I see you well, sir."\r\n\r\n"Fairly well. Thank you. Travelling I think agrees with me. I miss,\r\nnot my comforts, but a certain knowledge of how things are going on,\r\nwhich comes to us I think through our skins when we are at home. A\r\nfeeling of absence pervades me. Otherwise I like it. And you;--what\r\nhave you been doing?"\r\n\r\n"Shooting a little," said Silverbridge, in a mooncalf tone.\r\n\r\n"Shooting a great deal, if what I see in the newspapers be true about\r\nMr. Reginald Dobbes and his party. I presume it is a religion to\r\noffer up hecatombs to the autumnal gods,--who must surely take a\r\nkeener delight in blood and slaughter than those bloodthirsty gods of\r\nold."\r\n\r\n"You should talk to Gerald about that, sir."\r\n\r\n"Has Gerald been so great at his sacrifices? How will that suit with\r\nPlato? What does Mr. Simcox say?"\r\n\r\n"Of course they were all to have a holiday just at that time. But\r\nGerald is reading. I fancy that Gerald is clever."\r\n\r\n"And he is a great Nimrod?"\r\n\r\n"As to hunting."\r\n\r\n"Nimrod I fancy got his game in any way that he could compass it. I\r\ndo not doubt but that he trapped foxes."\r\n\r\n"With a rifle at deer, say for four hundred yards, I would back\r\nGerald against any man of his age in England or Scotland."\r\n\r\n"As for backing, Silverbridge, do not you think that we had better\r\nhave done with that?" This was said hardly in a tone of reproach,\r\nwith something even of banter in it; and as the question was asked\r\nthe Duke was smiling. But in a moment all that sense of joyousness\r\nwhich the young man had felt in singing his brother\'s praises was\r\nexpelled. His face fell, and he stood before his father almost like a\r\nculprit. "We might as well have it out about this racing," continued\r\nthe Duke. "Something has to be said about it. You have lost an\r\nenormous sum of money." The Duke\'s tone in saying this became\r\nterribly severe. Such at least was its sound in his son\'s ears. He\r\ndid not mean to be severe.\r\n\r\nBut when he did speak of that which displeased him his voice\r\nnaturally assumed that tone of indignation with which in days of yore\r\nhe had been wont to denounce the public extravagance of his opponents\r\nin the House of Commons. The father paused, but the son could not\r\nspeak at the moment.\r\n\r\n"And worse than that," continued the Duke; "you have lost it in\r\nas bad company as you could have found had you picked all England\r\nthrough."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lupton, and Sir Henry Playfair, and Lord Stirling were in the\r\nroom when the bets were made."\r\n\r\n"Were the gentlemen you name concerned with Major Tifto?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Who can tell with whom he may be in a room? Though rooms of that\r\nkind are, I think, best avoided." Then the Duke paused again, but\r\nSilverbridge was now sobbing so that he could hardly speak. "I am\r\nsorry that you should be so grieved," continued the father, "but such\r\ndelights cannot, I think, lead to much real joy."\r\n\r\n"It is for you, sir," said the son, rubbing his eyes with the hand\r\nwhich supported his head.\r\n\r\n"My grief in the matter might soon be cured."\r\n\r\n"How shall I cure it? I will do anything to cure it."\r\n\r\n"Let Major Tifto and the horses go."\r\n\r\n"They are gone," said Silverbridge energetically, jumping from his\r\nchair as he spoke. "I will never own a horse again, or a part of a\r\nhorse. I will have nothing more to do with races. You will believe\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"I will believe anything that you tell me."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t say I will not go to another race, because--"\r\n\r\n"No; no. I would not have you hamper yourself. Nor shall you bind\r\nyourself by any further promises. You have done with racing."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, indeed I have, sir."\r\n\r\nThen the father came up to the son and put his arms round the young\r\nman\'s shoulders and embraced him. "Of course it made me unhappy."\r\n\r\n"I knew it would."\r\n\r\n"But if you are cured of this evil, the money is nothing. What is it\r\nall for but for you and your brother and sister? It was a large sum,\r\nbut that shall not grieve me. The thing itself is so dangerous that,\r\nif with that much of loss we can escape, I will think that we have\r\nmade not a bad market. Who owns the horse now?"\r\n\r\n"The horses shall be sold."\r\n\r\n"For anything they may fetch so that we may get clear of this dirt.\r\nAnd the Major?"\r\n\r\n"I know nothing of him. I have not seen him since that day."\r\n\r\n"Has he claims on you?"\r\n\r\n"Not a shilling. It is all the other way."\r\n\r\n"Let it go then. Be quit of him, however it may be. Send a messenger\r\nso that he may understand that you have abandoned racing altogether.\r\nMr. Moreton might perhaps see him."\r\n\r\nThat his father should forgive so readily and yet himself suffer so\r\ndeeply, affected the son\'s feelings so strongly that for a time he\r\ncould hardly repress his sobs. "And now there shall not be a word\r\nmore said about it," said the Duke suddenly.\r\n\r\nSilverbridge in his confusion could make no answer.\r\n\r\n"There shall not be another word said about it," said the Duke again.\r\n"And now what do you mean to do with yourself immediately?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll stay here, sir, as long as you do. Finn, and Warburton, and I\r\nhave still a few coverts to shoot."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good reason for staying anywhere."\r\n\r\n"I meant that I would remain while you remained, sir."\r\n\r\n"That at any rate is a good reason, as far as I am concerned. But we\r\ngo to Custins next week."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a deal of shooting to be done at Gatherum," said the heir.\r\n\r\n"You speak of it as if it were the business of your life,--on which\r\nyour bread depended."\r\n\r\n"One can\'t expect game to be kept up if nobody goes to shoot it."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t one? I didn\'t know. I should have thought that the less was\r\nshot the more there would be to shoot; but I am ignorant in such\r\nmatters." Silverbridge then broke forth into a long explanation as to\r\ncoverts, gamekeepers, poachers, breeding, and the expectations of the\r\nneighbourhood at large, in the middle of which he was interrupted by\r\nthe Duke. "I am afraid, my dear boy, that I am too old to learn. But\r\nas it is so manifestly a duty, go and perform it like a man. Who will\r\ngo with you?"\r\n\r\n"I will ask Mr. Finn to be one."\r\n\r\n"He will be very hard upon you in the way of politics."\r\n\r\n"I can answer him better than I can you, sir. Mr. Lupton said he\r\nwould come for a day or two. He\'ll stand to me."\r\n\r\nAfter that his father stopped him as he was about to leave the room.\r\n"One more word, Silverbridge. Do you remember what you were saying\r\nwhen you walked down to the House with me from your club that night?"\r\nSilverbridge remembered very well what he had said. He had undertaken\r\nto ask Mabel Grex to be his wife, and had received his father\'s ready\r\napproval to the proposition. But at this moment he was unwilling to\r\nrefer to that matter. "I have thought about it very much since that,"\r\nsaid the Duke. "I may say that I have been thinking of it every day.\r\nIf there were anything to tell me, you would let me know;--would you\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then there is nothing to be told? I hope you have not changed your\r\nmind."\r\n\r\nSilverbridge paused a moment, trusting that he might be able to\r\nescape the making of any answer;--but the Duke evidently intended to\r\nhave an answer. "It appeared to me, sir, that it did not seem to suit\r\nher," said the hardly-driven young man. He could not now say that\r\nMabel had shown a disposition to reject his offer, because as they\r\nhad been sitting by the brookside at Killancodlem, even he, with all\r\nhis self-diffidence, had been forced to see what were her wishes.\r\nHer confusion, and too evident despair when she heard of the offer\r\nto the American girl, had plainly told her tale. He could not now\r\nplead to his father that Mabel Grex would refuse his offer. But his\r\nself-defence, when first he found that he had lost himself in love\r\nfor the American, had been based on that idea. He had done his best\r\nto make Mabel understand him. If he had not actually offered to her,\r\nhe had done the next thing to it. And he had run after her, till he\r\nwas ashamed of such running. She had given him no encouragement;--and\r\ntherefore he had been justified. No doubt he must have been mistaken;\r\nthat he now perceived; but still he felt himself to be justified. It\r\nwas impossible that he should explain all this to his father. One\r\nthing he certainly could not say,--just at present. After his folly\r\nin regard to those heavy debts he could not at once risk his father\'s\r\nrenewed anger by proposing to him an American daughter-in-law.\r\nThat must stand over, at any rate till the girl had accepted him\r\npositively. "I am afraid it won\'t come off, sir," he said at last.\r\n\r\n"Then I am to presume that you have changed your mind?"\r\n\r\n"I told you when we were speaking of it that I was not confident."\r\n\r\n"She has not--"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t explain it all, sir,--but I fear it won\'t come off."\r\n\r\nThen the Duke, who had been sitting, got up from his chair and with\r\nhis back to the fire made a final little speech. "We decided just\r\nnow, Silverbridge, that nothing more should be said about that\r\nunpleasant racing business, and nothing more shall be said by me. But\r\nyou must not be surprised if I am anxious to see you settled in life.\r\nNo young man could be more bound by duty to marry early than you\r\nare. In the first place you have to repair the injury done by my\r\ninaptitude for society. You have explained to me that it is your duty\r\nto have the Barsetshire coverts properly shot, and I have acceded\r\nto your views. Surely it must be equally your duty to see your\r\nBarsetshire neighbours. And you are a young man every feature of\r\nwhose character would be improved by matrimony. As far as means are\r\nconcerned you are almost as free to make arrangements as though you\r\nwere already the head of the family."\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"I could never bring myself to dictate to a son in regard to his\r\nchoice of a wife. But I will own that when you told me that you had\r\nchosen I was much gratified. Try and think again when you are pausing\r\namidst your sacrifices at Gatherum, whether that be possible. If it\r\nbe not, still I would wish you to bear in mind what is my idea as to\r\nyour duty." Silverbridge said that he would bear this in mind, and\r\nthen escaped from the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nLady Mary\'s Dream\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke and his daughter reached Custins they found a large\r\nparty assembled, and were somewhat surprised at the crowd. Lord and\r\nLady Nidderdale were there, which might have been expected as they\r\nwere part of the family. With Lord Popplecourt had come his recent\r\nfriend Adolphus Longstaff. That too might have been natural. Mr.\r\nand Miss Boncassen were there also, who at this moment were quite\r\nstrangers to the Duke; and Mr. Lupton. The Duke also found Lady\r\nChiltern, whose father-in-law had more than once sat in the same\r\nCabinet with himself, and Mr. Monk, who was generally spoken of as\r\nthe head of the coming Liberal Government, and the Ladies Adelaide\r\nand Flora FitzHoward, the still unmarried but not very juvenile\r\ndaughters of the Duke of St. Bungay. These with a few others made a\r\nlarge party, and rather confused the Duke, who had hardly reflected\r\nthat discreet and profitable love-making was more likely to go on\r\namong numbers, than if the two young people were thrown together with\r\nno other companions.\r\n\r\nLord Popplecourt had been made to understand what was expected\r\nof him, and after some hesitation had submitted himself to the\r\nconspiracy. There would not be less at any rate than two hundred\r\nthousand pounds;--and the connexion would be made with one of the\r\nhighest families in Great Britain. Though Lady Cantrip had said very\r\nfew words, those words had been expressive; and the young bachelor\r\npeer had given in his adhesion. Some vague half-defined tale had\r\nbeen told him,--not about Tregear, as Tregear\'s name had not been\r\nmentioned,--but respecting some dream of a young man who had flitted\r\nacross the girl\'s path during her mother\'s lifetime. "All girls have\r\nsuch dreams," Lady Cantrip had suggested. Whereupon Lord Popplecourt\r\nsaid that he supposed it was so. "But a softer, purer, more unsullied\r\nflower never waited on its stalk till the proper fingers should come\r\nto pluck it," said Lady Cantrip, rising to unaccustomed poetry on\r\nbehalf of her friend the Duke. Lord Popplecourt accepted the poetry\r\nand was ready to do his best to pluck the flower.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Duke\'s arrival Lord Popplecourt found himself\r\nin one of the drawing-rooms with Lady Cantrip and his proposed\r\nfather-in-law. A hint had been given him that he might as well be\r\nhome early from shooting, so as to be in the way. As the hour in\r\nwhich he was to make himself specially agreeable, both to the father\r\nand to the daughter, had drawn nigh, he became somewhat nervous, and\r\nnow, at this moment, was not altogether comfortable. Though he had\r\nbeen concerned in no such matter before, he had an idea that love was\r\na soft kind of thing which ought to steal on one unawares and come\r\nand go without trouble. In his case it came upon him with a rough\r\ndemand for immediate hard work. He had not previously thought that\r\nhe was to be subjected to such labours, and at this moment almost\r\nresented the interference with his ease. He was already a little\r\nangry with Lady Cantrip, but at the same time felt himself to be so\r\nmuch in subjection to her that he could not rebel.\r\n\r\nThe Duke himself when he saw the young man was hardly more\r\ncomfortable. He had brought his daughter to Custins, feeling that it\r\nwas his duty to be with her; but he would have preferred to leave\r\nthe whole operation to the care of Lady Cantrip. He hardly liked to\r\nlook at the fish whom he wished to catch for his daughter. Whenever\r\nthis aspect of affairs presented itself to him, he would endeavour\r\nto console himself by remembering the past success of a similar\r\ntransaction. He thought of his own first interview with his wife.\r\n"You have heard," he had said, "what our friends wish." She had\r\npouted her lips, and when gently pressed had at last muttered, with\r\nher shoulder turned to him, that she supposed it was to be so. Very\r\nmuch more coercion had been used to her then than either himself or\r\nLady Cantrip had dared to apply to his daughter. He did not think\r\nthat his girl in her present condition of mind would signify to Lord\r\nPopplecourt that "she supposed it was to be so." Now that the time\r\nfor the transaction was present he felt almost sure it would never be\r\ntransacted. But still he must go on with it. Were he now to abandon\r\nhis scheme, would it not be tantamount to abandoning everything? So\r\nhe wreathed his face in smiles,--or made some attempt at it,--as he\r\ngreeted the young man.\r\n\r\n"I hope you and Lady Mary had a pleasant journey abroad," said Lord\r\nPopplecourt. Lord Popplecourt, being aware that he had been chosen\r\nas a son-in-law, felt himself called upon to be familiar as well as\r\npleasant. "I often thought of you and Lady Mary, and wondered what\r\nyou were about."\r\n\r\n"We were visiting lakes and mountains, churches and picture\r\ngalleries, cities and salt-mines," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Does Lady Mary like that sort of thing?"\r\n\r\n"I think she was pleased with what she saw."\r\n\r\n"She has been abroad a great deal before, I believe. It depends so\r\nmuch on whom you meet when abroad."\r\n\r\nThis was unfortunate, because it recalled Tregear to the Duke\'s mind.\r\n"We saw very few people whom we knew," he said.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been shooting in Scotland with Silverbridge, and Gerald, and\r\nReginald Dobbes, and Nidderdale,--and that fellow Tregear, who is so\r\nthick with Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m told that Lord Gerald is going to be the great shot of his day,"\r\nsaid Lady Cantrip.\r\n\r\n"It is a distinction," said the Duke bitterly.\r\n\r\n"He did not beat me by so much," continued Popplecourt. "I think\r\nTregear did the best with his rifle. One morning he potted three.\r\nDobbes was disgusted. He hated Tregear."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it stupid,--half-a-dozen men getting together in that way?"\r\nasked Lady Cantrip.\r\n\r\n"Nidderdale is always jolly."\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear that," said the mother-in-law.\r\n\r\n"And Gerald is a regular brick." The Duke bowed. "Silverbridge used\r\nalways to be going off to Killancodlem, where there were a lot of\r\nladies. He is very sweet, you know, on this American girl whom you\r\nhave here." Again the Duke winced. "Dobbes is awfully good as to\r\nmaking out the shooting, but then he is a tyrant. Nevertheless I\r\nagree with him, if you mean to do a thing you should do it."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said the Duke. "But you should make up your mind first\r\nwhether the thing is worth doing."\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Popplecourt. "And as grouse and deer together are\r\nabout the best things out, most of us made up our minds that it was\r\nworth doing. But that fellow Tregear would argue it out. He said a\r\ngentleman oughtn\'t to play billiards as well as a marker."\r\n\r\n"I think he was right," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Do you know Mr. Tregear, Duke?"\r\n\r\n"I have met him--with my son."\r\n\r\n"Do you like him?"\r\n\r\n"I have seen very little of him."\r\n\r\n"I cannot say I do. He thinks so much of himself. Of course he is\r\nvery intimate with Silverbridge, and that is all that any one knows\r\nof him." The Duke bowed almost haughtily, though why he bowed he\r\ncould hardly have explained to himself. Lady Cantrip bit her lips in\r\ndisgust. "He\'s just the fellow," continued Popplecourt, "to think\r\nthat some princess has fallen in love with him." Then the Duke left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n"You had better not talk to him about Mr. Tregear," said Lady\r\nCantrip.\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether he approves of the intimacy between him and\r\nLord Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"I should think not;--a man without any position or a shilling in the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"The Duke is peculiar. If a subject is distasteful to him he does\r\nnot like it to be mentioned. You had better not mention Mr. Tregear."\r\nLady Cantrip, as she said this, blushed inwardly at her own\r\nhypocrisy.\r\n\r\nIt was of course contrived at dinner that Lord Popplecourt should\r\ntake out Lady Mary. It is impossible to discover how such things get\r\nwind, but there was already an idea prevalent at Custins that Lord\r\nPopplecourt had matrimonial views, and that these views were looked\r\nupon favourably. "You may be quite sure of it, Mr. Lupton," Lady\r\nAdelaide FitzHoward had said. "I\'ll make a bet they\'re married before\r\nthis time next year."\r\n\r\n"It will be a terrible case of Beauty and the Beast," said Lupton.\r\n\r\nLady Chiltern had whispered a suspicion of the same kind, and had\r\nexpressed a hope that the lover would be worthy of the girl. And\r\nDolly Longstaff had chaffed his friend Popplecourt on the subject,\r\nPopplecourt having laid himself open by indiscreet allusions to\r\nDolly\'s love for Miss Boncassen. "Everybody can\'t have it as easily\r\narranged for him as you,--a Duke\'s daughter and a pot of money\r\nwithout so much as the trouble of asking for it!"\r\n\r\n"What do you know about the Duke\'s children?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what it is to be a lord and not to have a father."\r\nPopplecourt tried to show that he was disgusted; but he felt himself\r\nall the more strongly bound to go on with his project.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore a matter of course that these should-be lovers would\r\nbe sent out of the room together. "You\'ll give your arm to Mary,"\r\nLady Cantrip said, dropping the ceremonial prefix. Lady Mary of\r\ncourse went out as she was bidden. Though everybody else knew it, no\r\nidea of what was intended had yet come across her mind.\r\n\r\nThe should-be lover immediately reverted to the Austrian tour,\r\nexpressing a hope that his neighbour had enjoyed herself. "There\'s\r\nnothing I like so much myself," said he, remembering some of the\r\nDuke\'s words, "as mountains, cities, salt-mines, and all that kind of\r\nthing. There\'s such a lot of interest about it."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see a salt-mine?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--not exactly a salt-mine; but I have coal-mines on my property\r\nin Staffordshire. I\'m very fond of coal. I hope you like coal."\r\n\r\n"I like salt a great deal better--to look at."\r\n\r\n"But which do you think pays best? I don\'t mind telling you,--though\r\nit\'s a kind of thing I never talk about to strangers,--the royalties\r\nfrom the Blogownie and Toodlem mines go up regularly two thousand\r\npounds every year."\r\n\r\n"I thought we were talking about what was pretty to look at."\r\n\r\n"So we were. I\'m as fond of pretty things as anybody. Do you know\r\nReginald Dobbes?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t. Is he pretty?"\r\n\r\n"He used to be so angry with Silverbridge, because Silverbridge would\r\nsay Crummie-Toddie was ugly."\r\n\r\n"Was Crummie-Toddie ugly?"\r\n\r\n"Just a plain house on a moor."\r\n\r\n"That sounds ugly."\r\n\r\n"I suppose your family like pretty things?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"I do, I know." Lord Popplecourt endeavoured to look as though he\r\nintended her to understand that she was the pretty thing which he\r\nmost particularly liked. She partly conceived his meaning, and was\r\ndisgusted accordingly. On the other side of her sat Mr. Boncassen, to\r\nwhom she had been introduced in the drawing-room,--and who had said a\r\nfew words to her about some Norwegian poet. She turned round to him,\r\nand asked him some questions about the Skald, and so, getting into\r\nconversation with him, managed to turn her shoulder to her suitor. On\r\nthe other side of him sat Lady Rosina de Courcy, to whom, as being\r\nan old woman and an old maid, he felt very little inclined to be\r\ncourteous. She said a word, asking him whether he did not think the\r\nweather was treacherous. He answered her very curtly, and sat bolt\r\nupright, looking forward on the table, and taking his dinner as it\r\ncame to him. He had been put there in order that Lady Mary Palliser\r\nmight talk to him, and he regarded interference on the part of\r\nthat old American as being ungentlemanlike. But the old American\r\ndisregarded him, and went on with his quotations from the\r\nScandinavian bard.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Boncassen sat next to Lady Cantrip, and when at last he was\r\ncalled upon to give his ear to the Countess, Lady Mary was again\r\nvacant for Popplecourt\'s attentions.\r\n\r\n"Are you very fond of poetry?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Very fond."\r\n\r\n"So am I. Which do you like best, Tennyson or Shakespeare?"\r\n\r\n"They are very unlike."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--they are unlike. Or Moore\'s Melodies? I am very fond of \'When\r\nin death I shall calm recline.\' I think this equal to anything.\r\nReginald Dobbes would have it that poetry is all bosh."\r\n\r\n"Then I think that Mr. Reginald Dobbes must be all bosh himself."\r\n\r\n"There was a man there named Tregear who had brought some books."\r\nThen there was a pause. Lady Mary had not a word to say. "Dobbes used\r\nto declare that he was always pretending to read poetry."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Tregear never pretends anything."\r\n\r\n"Do you know him?" asked the rival.\r\n\r\n"He is my brother\'s most particular friend."\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes. I dare say Silverbridge has talked to you about him. I\r\nthink he\'s a stuck-up sort of fellow." To this there was not a word\r\nof reply. "Where did your brother pick him up?"\r\n\r\n"They were at Oxford together."\r\n\r\n"I must say I think he gives himself airs;--because, you know, he\'s\r\nnobody."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything of the kind," said Lady Mary, becoming very\r\nred. "And as he is my brother\'s most particular friend,--his very\r\nfriend of friends,--I think you had better not abuse him to me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think the Duke is very fond of him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care who is fond of him. I am very fond of Silverbridge, and\r\nI won\'t hear his friend ill-spoken of. I dare say he had some books\r\nwith him. He is not at all the sort of a man to go to a place and\r\nsatisfy himself with doing nothing but killing animals."\r\n\r\n"Do you know him, Lady Mary?"\r\n\r\n"I have seen him, and of course I have heard a great deal of him from\r\nSilverbridge. I would rather not talk any more about him."\r\n\r\n"You seem to be very fond of Mr. Tregear," he said angrily.\r\n\r\n"It is no business of yours, Lord Popplecourt, whether I am fond of\r\nanybody or not. I have told you that Mr. Tregear is my brother\'s\r\nfriend, and that ought to be enough."\r\n\r\nLord Popplecourt was a young man possessed of a certain amount of\r\ningenuity. It was said of him that he knew on which side his bread\r\nwas buttered, and that if you wished to take him in you must get up\r\nearly. After dinner and during the night he pondered a good deal on\r\nwhat he had heard. Lady Cantrip had told him there had been a--dream.\r\nWhat was he to believe about that dream? Had he not better avoid the\r\nerror of putting too fine a point upon it, and tell himself at once\r\nthat a dream in this instance meant a--lover? Lady Mary had already\r\nbeen troubled by a lover! He was disposed to believe that young\r\nladies often do have objectionable lovers, and that things get\r\nthemselves right afterwards. Young ladies can be made to understand\r\nthe beauty of coal-mines almost as readily as young gentlemen. There\r\nwould be the two hundred thousand pounds; and there was the girl,\r\nbeautiful, well-born, and thoroughly well-mannered. But what if\r\nthis Tregear and the dream were one and the same? If so, had he not\r\nreceived plenty of evidence that the dream had not yet passed away?\r\nA remnant of affection for the dream would not have been a fatal\r\nbarrier, had not the girl been so fierce with him in defence of her\r\ndream. He remembered, too, what the Duke had said about Tregear, and\r\nLady Cantrip\'s advice to him to be silent in respect to this man. And\r\nthen do girls generally defend their brothers\' friends as she had\r\ndefended Tregear? He thought not. Putting all these things together\r\non the following morning he came to an uncomfortable belief that\r\nTregear was the dream.\r\n\r\nSoon after that he found himself near to Dolly Longstaff as they were\r\nshooting. "You know that fellow Tregear, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh Lord, yes. He is Silverbridge\'s pal."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever hear anything about him?"\r\n\r\n"What sort of thing?"\r\n\r\n"Was he ever--ever in love with any one?"\r\n\r\n"I fancy he used to be awfully spooney on Mab Grex. I remember\r\nhearing that they were to have been married, only that neither of\r\nthem had sixpence."\r\n\r\n"Oh--Lady Mabel Grex! That\'s a horse of another colour."\r\n\r\n"And which is the horse of your colour?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t got a horse," said Lord Popplecourt, going away to his own\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nMiss Boncassen\'s Idea of Heaven\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was generally known that Dolly Longstaff had been heavily smitten\r\nby the charms of Miss Boncassen; but the world hardly gave him credit\r\nfor the earnestness of his affection. Dolly had never been known to\r\nbe in earnest in anything;--but now he was in very truth in love. He\r\nhad agreed to be Popplecourt\'s companion at Custins because he had\r\nheard that Miss Boncassen would be there. He had thought over the\r\nmatter with more consideration than he had ever before given to any\r\nsubject. He had gone so far as to see his own man of business, with a\r\nview of ascertaining what settlements he could make and what income\r\nhe might be able to spend. He had told himself over and over again\r\nthat he was not the "sort of fellow" that ought to marry; but it\r\nwas all of no avail. He confessed to himself that he was completely\r\n"bowled over,"--"knocked off his pins!"\r\n\r\n"Is a fellow to have no chance?" he said to Miss Boncassen at\r\nCustins.\r\n\r\n"If I understand what a fellow means, I am afraid not."\r\n\r\n"No man alive was ever more in earnest than I am."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Longstaff, I do not suppose that you have been trying to\r\ntake me in all this time."\r\n\r\n"I hope you do not think ill of me."\r\n\r\n"I may think well of a great many gentlemen without wishing to marry\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"But does love go for nothing?" said Dolly, putting his hand upon his\r\nheart. "Perhaps there are so many that love you."\r\n\r\n"Not above half-a-dozen or so."\r\n\r\n"You can make a joke of it, when I--. But I don\'t think, Miss\r\nBoncassen, you at all realise what I feel. As to settlements and all\r\nthat, your father could do what he likes with me."\r\n\r\n"My father has nothing to do with it, and I don\'t know what\r\nsettlements mean. We never think anything of settlements in our\r\ncountry. If two young people love each other they go and get\r\nmarried."\r\n\r\n"Let us do the same here."\r\n\r\n"But the two young people don\'t love each other. Look here, Mr.\r\nLongstaff; it\'s my opinion that a young woman ought not to be\r\npestered."\r\n\r\n"Pestered!"\r\n\r\n"You force me to speak in that way. I\'ve given you an answer ever so\r\nmany times. I will not be made to do it over and over again."\r\n\r\n"It\'s that d---- fellow, Silverbridge," he exclaimed almost angrily.\r\nOn hearing this Miss Boncassen left the room without speaking another\r\nword, and Dolly Longstaff found himself alone. He saw what he had\r\ndone as soon as she was gone. After that he could hardly venture to\r\npersevere again--here at Custins. He weighed it over in his mind for\r\na long time, almost coming to a resolution in favour of hard drink.\r\nHe had never felt anything like this before. He was so uncomfortable\r\nthat he couldn\'t eat his luncheon, though in accordance with his\r\nusual habit he had breakfasted off soda-and-brandy and a morsel of\r\ndevilled toast. He did not know himself in his changed character.\r\n"I wonder whether she understands that I have four thousand pounds\r\na year of my own, and shall have twelve thousand pounds more when\r\nmy governor goes! She was so headstrong that it was impossible to\r\nexplain anything to her."\r\n\r\n"I\'m off to London," he said to Popplecourt that afternoon.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! you said you\'d stay for ten days."\r\n\r\n"All the same, I\'m going at once. I\'ve sent to Bridport for a trap,\r\nand I shall sleep to-night at Dorchester."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the meaning of it all?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had some words with somebody. Don\'t mind asking any more."\r\n\r\n"Not with the Duke?"\r\n\r\n"The Duke! No; I haven\'t spoken to him."\r\n\r\n"Or Lord Cantrip?"\r\n\r\n"I wish you wouldn\'t ask questions."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ve quarrelled with anybody you ought to consult a friend."\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing of that kind."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s a lady. It\'s the American girl!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I tell you I don\'t want to talk about it? I\'m going. I\'ve told\r\nLady Cantrip that my mother wasn\'t well and wants to see me. You\'ll\r\nstop your time out, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got it all square, no doubt. I wish I\'d a handle to my name.\r\nI never cared for it before."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry you\'re so down in the mouth. Why don\'t you try again? The\r\nthing is to stick to \'em like wax. If ten times of asking won\'t do,\r\ngo in twenty times."\r\n\r\nDolly shook his head despondently. "What can you do when a girl walks\r\nout of the room and slams the door in your face? She\'ll get it hot\r\nand heavy before she has done. I know what she\'s after. She might as\r\nwell cry for the moon." And so Dolly got into the trap and went to\r\nBridport, and slept that night at the hotel at Dorchester.\r\n\r\nLord Popplecourt, though he could give such excellent advice to his\r\nfriend, had been able as yet to do very little in his own case. He\r\nhad been a week at Custins, and had said not a word to denote his\r\npassion. Day after day he had prepared himself for the encounter, but\r\nthe lady had never given him the opportunity. When he sat next to her\r\nat dinner she would be very silent. If he stayed at home on a morning\r\nshe was not visible. During the short evenings he could never get her\r\nattention. And he made no progress with the Duke. The Duke had been\r\nvery courteous to him at Richmond, but here he was monosyllabic and\r\nalmost sullen.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice Lord Popplecourt had a little conversation with Lady\r\nCantrip. "Dear girl!" said her ladyship. "She is so little given to\r\nseeking admiration."\r\n\r\n"I dare say."\r\n\r\n"Girls are so different, Lord Popplecourt. With some of them it seems\r\nthat a gentleman need have no trouble in explaining what it is that\r\nhe wishes."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Lady Mary is like that at all."\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. Any one who addresses her must be prepared to\r\nexplain himself fully. Nor ought he to hope to get much encouragement\r\nat first. I do not think that Lady Mary will bestow her heart till\r\nshe is sure she can give it with safety." There was an amount\r\nof falsehood in this which was proof at any rate of very strong\r\nfriendship on the part of Lady Cantrip.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days Lady Mary became more intimate with the American and\r\nhis daughter than with any others of the party. Perhaps she liked\r\nto talk about the Scandinavian poets, of whom Mr. Boncassen was so\r\nfond. Perhaps she felt sure that her transatlantic friend would not\r\nmake love to her. Perhaps it was that she yielded to the various\r\nallurements of Miss Boncassen. Miss Boncassen saw the Duke of Omnium\r\nfor the first time at Custins, and there had the first opportunity of\r\nasking herself how such a man as that would receive from his son and\r\nheir such an announcement as Lord Silverbridge would have to make him\r\nshould she at the end of three months accept his offer. She was quite\r\naware that Lord Silverbridge need not repeat the offer unless he\r\nwere so pleased. But she thought that he would come again. He had so\r\nspoken that she was sure of his love; and had so spoken as to obtain\r\nhers. Yes;--she was sure that she loved him. She had never seen\r\nanything like him before;--so glorious in his beauty, so gentle in\r\nhis manhood, so powerful and yet so little imperious, so great in\r\ncondition, and yet so little confident in his own greatness, so\r\nbolstered up with external advantages, and so little apt to trust\r\nanything but his own heart and his own voice. In asking for her\r\nlove he had put forward no claim but his own love. She was glad he\r\nwas what he was. She counted at their full value all his natural\r\nadvantages. To be an English Duchess! Oh--yes; her ambition\r\nunderstood it all! But she loved him, because in the expression of\r\nhis love no hint had fallen from him of the greatness of the benefits\r\nwhich he could confer upon her. Yes, she would like to be a Duchess;\r\nbut not to be a Duchess would she become the wife of a man who should\r\nbegin his courtship by assuming a superiority.\r\n\r\nNow the chances of society had brought her into the company of his\r\nnearest friends. She was in the house with his father and with his\r\nsister. Now and again the Duke spoke a few words to her, and always\r\ndid so with a peculiar courtesy. But she was sure that the Duke had\r\nheard nothing of his son\'s courtship. And she was equally sure that\r\nthe matter had not reached Lady Mary\'s ears. She perceived that the\r\nDuke and her father would often converse together. Mr. Boncassen\r\nwould discuss republicanism generally, and the Duke would explain\r\nthat theory of monarchy as it prevails in England, which but very few\r\nAmericans have ever been made to understand. All this Miss Boncassen\r\nwatched with pleasure. She was still of opinion that it would not\r\nbecome her to force her way into a family which would endeavour to\r\nrepudiate her. She would not become this young man\'s wife if all\r\nconnected with the young man were resolved to reject the contact. But\r\nif she could conquer them,--then,--then she thought that she could\r\nput her little hand into that young man\'s grasp with a happy heart.\r\n\r\nIt was in this frame of mind that she laid herself out not\r\nunsuccessfully to win the esteem of Lady Mary Palliser. "I do not\r\nknow whether you approve it," Lady Cantrip said to the Duke; "but\r\nMary has become very intimate with our new American friend." At this\r\ntime Lady Cantrip had become very nervous,--so as almost to wish\r\nthat Lady Mary\'s difficulties might be unravelled elsewhere than at\r\nCustins.\r\n\r\n"They seem to be sensible people," said the Duke. "I don\'t know when\r\nI have met a man with higher ideas on politics than Mr. Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"His daughter is popular with everybody."\r\n\r\n"A nice ladylike girl," said the Duke, "and appears to have been well\r\neducated."\r\n\r\nIt was now near the end of October, and the weather was peculiarly\r\nfine. Perhaps in our climate, October would of all months be the most\r\ndelightful if something of its charms were not detracted from by the\r\nfeeling that with it will depart the last relics of the delights of\r\nsummer. The leaves are still there with their gorgeous colouring, but\r\nthey are going. The last rose still lingers on the bush, but it is\r\nthe last. The woodland walks are still pleasant to the feet, but\r\ncaution is heard on every side as to the coming winter.\r\n\r\nThe park at Custins, which was spacious, had many woodland walks\r\nattached to it, from which, through vistas of the timber, distant\r\nglimpses of the sea were caught. Within half a mile of the house the\r\nwoods were reached, and within a mile the open sea was in sight,--and\r\nyet the wanderers might walk for miles without going over the same\r\nground. Here, without other companions, Lady Mary and Miss Boncassen\r\nfound themselves one afternoon, and here the latter told her story to\r\nher lover\'s sister. "I so long to tell you something," she said.\r\n\r\n"Is it a secret?" asked Lady Mary.\r\n\r\n"Well; yes; it is,--if you will keep it so. I would rather you should\r\nkeep it a secret. But I will tell you." Then she stood still, looking\r\ninto the other\'s face. "I wonder how you will take it."\r\n\r\n"What can it be?"\r\n\r\n"Your brother has asked me to be his wife."\r\n\r\n"Silverbridge!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--Lord Silverbridge. You are astonished."\r\n\r\nLady Mary was very much astonished,--so much astonished that words\r\nescaped from her, which she regretted afterwards. "I thought there\r\nwas someone else."\r\n\r\n"Who else?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Mabel Grex. But I know nothing."\r\n\r\n"I think not," said Miss Boncassen slowly. "I have seen them together\r\nand I think not. There might be somebody, though I think not her. But\r\nwhy do I say that? Why do I malign him, and make so little of myself?\r\nThere is no one else, Lady Mary. Is he not true?"\r\n\r\n"I think he is true."\r\n\r\n"I am sure he is true. And he has asked me to be his wife."\r\n\r\n"What did you say?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--what do you think? What is it probable that such a girl as I\r\nwould say when such a man as your brother asks her to be his wife? Is\r\nhe not such a man as a girl would love?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"Is he not handsome as a god?" Mary stared at her with all her eyes.\r\n"And sweeter than any god those pagan races knew? And is he not\r\ngood-tempered, and loving; and has he not that perfection of manly\r\ndash without which I do not think I could give my heart to any man?"\r\n\r\n"Then you have accepted him?"\r\n\r\n"And his rank and his wealth! The highest position in all the world\r\nin my eyes."\r\n\r\n"I do not think you should take him for that."\r\n\r\n"Does it not all help? Can you put yourself in my place? Why should I\r\nrefuse him? No, not for that. I would not take him for that. But if I\r\nlove him,--because he is all that my imagination tells me that a man\r\nought to be;--if to be his wife seems to me to be the greatest bliss\r\nthat could happen to a woman; if I feel that I could die to serve\r\nhim, that I could live to worship him, that his touch would be sweet\r\nto me, his voice music, his strength the only support in the world on\r\nwhich I would care to lean,--what then?"\r\n\r\n"Is it so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is so. It is after that fashion that I love him. He is my\r\nhero;--and not the less so because there is none higher than he among\r\nthe nobles of the greatest land under the sun. Would you have me for\r\na sister?" Lady Mary could not answer all at once. She had to think\r\nof her father;--and then she thought of her own lover. Why should\r\nnot Silverbridge be as well entitled to his choice as she considered\r\nherself to be? And yet how would it be with her father? Silverbridge\r\nwould in process of time be the head of the family. Would it be\r\nproper that he should marry an American?\r\n\r\n"You would not like me for a sister?"\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of my father. For myself I like you."\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell you what I said to him?"\r\n\r\n"If you will."\r\n\r\n"I told him that he must ask his friends;--that I would not be his\r\nwife to be rejected by them all. Nor will I. Though it be heaven I\r\nwill not creep there through a hole. If I cannot go in with my head\r\nupright, I will not go even there." Then she turned round as though\r\nshe were prepared in her emotion to walk back to the house alone. But\r\nLady Mary ran after her, and having caught her, put her arm round her\r\nwaist and kissed her.\r\n\r\n"I at any rate will love you," said Lady Mary.\r\n\r\n"I will do as I have said," continued Miss Boncassen. "I will do as I\r\nhave said. Though I love your brother down to the ground he shall not\r\nmarry me without his father\'s consent." Then they returned arm-in-arm\r\nclose together; but very little more was said between them.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Mary entered the house she was told that Lady Cantrip\r\nwished to see her in her own room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\nThe Party at Custins Is Broken Up\r\n\r\n\r\nThe message was given to Lady Mary after so solemn a fashion that she\r\nwas sure some important communication was to be made to her. Her mind\r\nat that moment had been filled with her new friend\'s story. She felt\r\nthat she required some time to meditate before she could determine\r\nwhat she herself would wish; but when she was going to her own room,\r\nin order that she might think it over, she was summoned to Lady\r\nCantrip. "My dear," said the Countess, "I wish you to do something to\r\noblige me."\r\n\r\n"Of course I will."\r\n\r\n"Lord Popplecourt wants to speak to you."\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"Lord Popplecourt."\r\n\r\n"What can Lord Popplecourt have to say to me?"\r\n\r\n"Can you not guess? Lord Popplecourt is a young nobleman, standing\r\nvery high in the world, possessed of ample means, just in that\r\nposition in which it behoves such a man to look about for a wife."\r\nLady Mary pressed her lips together, and clenched her two hands. "Can\r\nyou not imagine what such a gentleman may have to say?" Then there\r\nwas a pause, but she made no immediate answer. "I am to tell you, my\r\ndear, that your father would approve of it."\r\n\r\n"Approve of what?"\r\n\r\n"He approves of Lord Popplecourt as a suitor for your hand."\r\n\r\n"How can he?"\r\n\r\n"Why not, Mary? Of course he has made it his business to ascertain\r\nall particulars as to Lord Popplecourt\'s character and property."\r\n\r\n"Papa knows that I love somebody else."\r\n\r\n"My dear Mary, that is all vanity."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that papa can want to see me married to a man when he\r\nknows that with all my heart and soul--"\r\n\r\n"Oh Mary!"\r\n\r\n"When he knows," continued Mary, who would not be put down, "that I\r\nlove another man with all my heart. What will Lord Popplecourt say if\r\nI tell him that? If he says anything to me, I shall tell him. Lord\r\nPopplecourt! He cares for nothing but his coal-mines. Of course, if\r\nyou bid me see him I will; but it can do no good. I despise him, and\r\nif he troubles me I shall hate him. As for marrying him,--I would\r\nsooner die this minute."\r\n\r\nAfter this Lady Cantrip did not insist on the interview. She\r\nexpressed her regret that things should be as they were,--explained\r\nin sweetly innocent phrases that in a certain rank of life young\r\nladies could not always marry the gentlemen to whom their fancies\r\nmight attach them, but must, not unfrequently, postpone their\r\nyouthful inclinations to the will of their elders,--or in less\r\ndelicate language, that though they might love in one direction they\r\nmust marry in another; and then expressed a hope that her dear Mary\r\nwould think over these things and try to please her father. "Why does\r\nhe not try to please me?" said Mary. Then Lady Cantrip was obliged to\r\nsee Lord Popplecourt, a necessity which was a great nuisance to her.\r\n"Yes;--she understands what you mean. But she is not prepared for it\r\nyet. You must wait awhile."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why I am to wait."\r\n\r\n"She is very young,--and so are you, indeed. There is plenty of\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"There is somebody else I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I told you," said Lady Cantrip, in her softest voice, "that there\r\nhas been a dream across her path."\r\n\r\n"It\'s that Tregear!"\r\n\r\n"I am not prepared to mention names," said Lady Cantrip, astonished\r\nthat he should know so much. "But indeed you must wait."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see it, Lady Cantrip."\r\n\r\n"What can I say more? If you think that such a girl as Lady Mary\r\nPalliser, the daughter of the Duke of Omnium, possessed of fortune,\r\nbeauty, and every good gift, is to come like a bird to your call, you\r\nwill find yourself mistaken. All that her friends can do for you will\r\nbe done. The rest must remain with yourself." During that evening\r\nLord Popplecourt endeavoured to make himself pleasant to one of the\r\nFitzHoward young ladies, and on the next morning he took his leave of\r\nCustins.\r\n\r\n"I will never interfere again in reference to anybody else\'s child as\r\nlong as I live," Lady Cantrip said to her husband that night.\r\n\r\nLady Mary was very much tempted to open her heart to Miss Boncassen.\r\nIt would be delightful to her to have a friend; but were she to\r\nengage Miss Boncassen\'s sympathies on her behalf, she must of course\r\nsympathise with Miss Boncassen in return. And what if, after all,\r\nSilverbridge were not devoted to the American beauty! What if it\r\nshould turn out that he was going to marry Lady Mabel Grex! "I\r\nwish you would call me Isabel," her friend said to her. "It is so\r\nodd,--since I have left New York I have never heard my name from any\r\nlips except father\'s and mother\'s."\r\n\r\n"Has not Silverbridge ever called you by your Christian name?"\r\n\r\n"I think not. I am sure he never has." But he had, though it had\r\npassed by her at the moment without attention. "It all came from\r\nhim so suddenly. And yet I expected it. But it was too sudden for\r\nChristian names and pretty talk. I do not even know what his name\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"Plantagenet;--but we always call him Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"Plantagenet is very much prettier. I shall always call him\r\nPlantagenet. But I recall that. You will not remember that against\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"I will remember nothing that you do not wish."\r\n\r\n"I mean that if,--if all the grandeurs of all the Pallisers could\r\nconsent to put up with poor me, if heaven were opened to me with a\r\nstraight gate, so that I could walk out of our republic into your\r\naristocracy with my head erect, with the stars and stripes waving\r\nproudly round me till I had been accepted into the shelter of the\r\nOmnium griffins,--then I would call him--"\r\n\r\n"There\'s one Palliser would welcome you."\r\n\r\n"Would you, dear? Then I will love you so dearly. May I call you\r\nMary?"\r\n\r\n"Of course you may."\r\n\r\n"Mary is the prettiest name under the sun. But Plantagenet is so\r\ngrand! Which of the kings did you branch off from?"\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about it. From none of them, I should think. There is\r\nsome story about a Sir Guy who was a king\'s friend. I never trouble\r\nmyself about it. I hate aristocracy."\r\n\r\n"Do you, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mary, full of her own grievances. "It is an abominable\r\nbondage, and I do not see that it does any good at all."\r\n\r\n"I think it is so glorious," said the American. "There is no such\r\nmischievous nonsense in all the world as equality. That is what\r\nfather says. What men ought to want is liberty."\r\n\r\n"It is terrible to be tied up in a small circle," said the Duke\'s\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Lady Mary?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you were to call me Mary. What I mean is this. Suppose\r\nthat Silverbridge loves you better than all the world."\r\n\r\n"I hope he does. I think he does."\r\n\r\n"And suppose he cannot marry you, because of his--aristocracy?"\r\n\r\n"But he can."\r\n\r\n"I thought you were saying yourself--"\r\n\r\n"Saying what? That he could not marry me! No, indeed! But that under\r\ncertain circumstances I would not marry him. You don\'t suppose that\r\nI think he would be disgraced? If so I would go away at once, and\r\nhe should never again see my face or hear my voice. I think myself\r\ngood enough for the best man God ever made. But if others think\r\ndifferently, and those others are so closely concerned with him,\r\nand would be so closely concerned with me, as to trouble our joint\r\nlives,--then will I neither subject him to such sorrow nor will I\r\nencounter it myself."\r\n\r\n"It all comes from what you call aristocracy."\r\n\r\n"No, dear;--but from the prejudices of an aristocracy. To tell the\r\ntruth, Mary, the more difficult a place is to get into, the more the\r\nright of going in is valued. If everybody could be a Duchess and a\r\nPalliser, I should not perhaps think so much about it."\r\n\r\n"I thought it was because you loved him."\r\n\r\n"So I do. I love him entirely. I have said not a word of that to\r\nhim;--but I do, if I know at all what love is. But if you love a\r\nstar, the pride you have in your star will enhance your love. Though\r\nyou know that you must die of your love, still you must love your\r\nstar."\r\n\r\nAnd yet Mary could not tell her tale in return. She could not show\r\nthe reverse picture;--that she being a star was anxious to dispose of\r\nherself after the fashion of poor human rushlights. It was not that\r\nshe was ashamed of her love, but that she could not bring herself to\r\nyield altogether in reference to the great descent which Silverbridge\r\nwould have to make.\r\n\r\nOn the day after this,--the last day of the Duke\'s sojourn at\r\nCustins, the last also of the Boncassens\' visit,--it came to pass\r\nthat the Duke and Mr. Boncassen, with Lady Mary and Isabel, were all\r\nwalking in the woods together. And it so happened when they were at\r\na little distance from the house, each of the girls was walking with\r\nthe other girl\'s father. Isabel had calculated what she would say to\r\nthe Duke should a time for speaking come to her. She could not tell\r\nhim of his son\'s love. She could not ask his permission. She could\r\nnot explain to him all her feelings, or tell him what she thought of\r\nher proper way of getting into heaven. That must come afterwards if\r\nit should ever come at all. But there was something that she could\r\ntell. "We are so different from you," she said, speaking of her own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n"And yet so like," said the Duke, smiling;--"your language, your\r\nlaws, your habits!"\r\n\r\n"But still there is such a difference! I do not think there is a man\r\nin the whole Union more respected than father."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not."\r\n\r\n"Many people think that if he would only allow himself to be put in\r\nnomination, he might be the next president."\r\n\r\n"The choice, I am sure, would do your country honour."\r\n\r\n"And yet his father was a poor labourer who earned his bread among\r\nthe shipping at New York. That kind of thing would be impossible\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"My dear young lady, there you wrong us."\r\n\r\n"Do I?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly! A Prime Minister with us might as easily come from the\r\nsame class."\r\n\r\n"Here you think so much of rank. You are--a Duke."\r\n\r\n"But a Prime Minister can make a Duke; and if a man can raise himself\r\nby his own intellect to that position, no one will think of his\r\nfather or his grandfather. The sons of merchants have with us been\r\nPrime Ministers more than once, and no Englishmen ever were more\r\nhonoured among their countrymen. Our peerage is being continually\r\nrecruited from the ranks of the people, and hence it gets its\r\nstrength."\r\n\r\n"Is it so?"\r\n\r\n"There is no greater mistake than to suppose that inferiority of\r\nbirth is a barrier to success in this country."\r\n\r\nShe listened to this and to much more on the same subject with\r\nattentive ears,--not shaken in her ideas as to the English\r\naristocracy in general, but thinking that she was perhaps learning\r\nsomething of his own individual opinions. If he were more liberal\r\nthan others, on that liberality might perhaps be based her own\r\nhappiness and fortune.\r\n\r\nHe, in all this, was quite unconscious of the working of her mind.\r\nNor in discussing such matters generally did he ever mingle his own\r\nprivate feelings, his own pride of race and name, his own ideas of\r\nwhat was due to his ancient rank with the political creed by which\r\nhis conduct in public life was governed. The peer who sat next to him\r\nin the House of Lords, whose grandmother had been a washerwoman and\r\nwhose father an innkeeper, was to him every whit as good a peer as\r\nhimself. And he would as soon sit in counsel with Mr. Monk, whose\r\nfather had risen from a mechanic to be a merchant, as with any\r\nnobleman who could count ancestors against himself. But there was an\r\ninner feeling in his bosom as to his own family, his own name, his\r\nown children, and his own personal self, which was kept altogether\r\napart from his grand political theories. It was a subject on which\r\nhe never spoke; but the feeling had come to him as a part of his\r\nbirthright. And he conceived that it would pass through him to his\r\nchildren after the same fashion. It was this which made the idea of\r\na marriage between his daughter and Tregear intolerable to him, and\r\nwhich would operate as strongly in regard to any marriage which\r\nhis son might contemplate. Lord Grex was not a man with whom he\r\nwould wish to form any intimacy. He was, we may say, a wretched\r\nunprincipled old man, bad all round; and such the Duke knew him to\r\nbe. But the blue blood and the rank were there; and as the girl was\r\ngood herself, he would have been quite contented that his son should\r\nmarry the daughter of Lord Grex. That one and the same man should\r\nhave been in one part of himself so unlike the other part,--that he\r\nshould have one set of opinions so contrary to another set,--poor\r\nIsabel Boncassen did not understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\nThe Major\'s Fate\r\n\r\n\r\nThe affair of Prime Minister and the nail was not allowed to fade\r\naway into obscurity. Through September and October it was made\r\nmatter for pungent inquiry. The Jockey Club was alive. Mr. Pook was\r\nvery instant,--with many Pookites anxious to free themselves from\r\nsuspicion. Sporting men declared that the honour of the turf required\r\nthat every detail of the case should be laid open. But by the end of\r\nOctober, though every detail had been surmised, nothing had in truth\r\nbeen discovered. Nobody doubted but that Tifto had driven the nail\r\ninto the horse\'s foot, and that Green and Gilbert Villiers had shared\r\nthe bulk of the plunder. They had gone off on their travels together,\r\nand the fact that each of them had been in possession of about twenty\r\nthousand pounds was proved. But then there is no law against two\r\ngentlemen having such a sum of money. It was notorious that Captain\r\nGreen and Mr. Gilbert Villiers had enriched themselves to this extent\r\nby the failure of Prime Minister. But yet nothing was proved!\r\n\r\nThat the Major had either himself driven in the nail or seen it done,\r\nall racing men were agreed. He had been out with the horse in the\r\nmorning and had been the first to declare that the animal was lame.\r\nAnd he had been with the horse till the farrier had come. But he had\r\nconcocted a story for himself. He did not dispute that the horse\r\nhad been lamed by the machinations of Green and Villiers,--with the\r\nassistance of the groom. No doubt, he said, these men, who had been\r\nafraid to face an inquiry, had contrived and had carried out the\r\niniquity. How the lameness had been caused he could not pretend to\r\nsay. The groom who was at the horse\'s head, and who evidently knew\r\nhow these things were done, might have struck a nerve in the horse\'s\r\nfoot with his boot. But when the horse was got into the stable he,\r\nTifto,--so he declared,--at once ran out to send for the farrier.\r\nDuring the minutes so occupied the operation must have been made with\r\nthe nail. That was Tifto\'s story,--and as he kept his ground, there\r\nwere some few who believed it.\r\n\r\nBut though the story was so far good, he had at moments been\r\nimprudent, and had talked when he should have been silent. The whole\r\nmatter had been a torment to him. In the first place his conscience\r\nmade him miserable. As long as it had been possible to prevent the\r\nevil he had hoped to make a clean breast of it to Lord Silverbridge.\r\nUp to this period of his life everything had been "square" with him.\r\nHe had betted "square," and had ridden "square," and had run horses\r\n"square." He had taken a pride in this, as though it had been a great\r\nvirtue. It was not without great inward grief that he had deprived\r\nhimself of the consolations of these reflections! But when he had\r\napproached his noble partner, his noble partner snubbed him at every\r\nturn,--and he did the deed.\r\n\r\nHis reward was to be three thousand pounds,--and he got his money.\r\nThe money was very much to him,--would perhaps have been almost\r\nenough to comfort him in his misery, had not those other rascals\r\ngot so much more. When he heard that the groom\'s fee was higher\r\nthan his own, it almost broke his heart. Green and Villiers, men of\r\ninfinitely lower standing,--men at whom the Beargarden would not have\r\nlooked,--had absolutely netted fortunes on which they could live\r\nin comfort. No doubt they had run away while Tifto still stood his\r\nground;--but he soon began to doubt whether to have run away with\r\ntwenty thousand pounds was not better than to remain with such\r\nsmall plunder as had fallen to his lot, among such faces as those\r\nwhich now looked upon him! Then when he had drunk a few glasses of\r\nwhisky-and-water, he said something very foolish as to his power of\r\npunishing that swindler Green.\r\n\r\nAn attempt had been made to induce Silverbridge to delay the payment\r\nof his bets;--but he had been very eager that they should be paid.\r\nUnder the joint auspices of Mr. Lupton and Mr. Moreton the horses\r\nwere sold, and the establishment was annihilated,--with considerable\r\nloss, but with great despatch. The Duke had been urgent. The Jockey\r\nClub, and the racing world, and the horsey fraternity generally,\r\nmight do what seemed to them good,--so that Silverbridge was\r\nextricated from the matter. Silverbridge was extricated,--and the\r\nDuke cared nothing for the rest.\r\n\r\nBut Silverbridge could not get out of the mess quite so easily as\r\nhis father wished. Two questions arose about Major Tifto, outside\r\nthe racing world, but within the domain of the world of sport and\r\npleasure generally, as to one of which it was impossible that\r\nSilverbridge should not express an opinion. The first question had\r\nreference to the Mastership of the Runnymede hounds. In this our\r\nyoung friend was not bound to concern himself. The other affected the\r\nBeargarden Club; and, as Lord Silverbridge had introduced the Major,\r\nhe could hardly forbear from the expression of an opinion.\r\n\r\nThere was a meeting of the subscribers to the hunt in the last week\r\nof October. At that meeting Major Tifto told his story. There he was,\r\nto answer any charge which might be brought against him. If he had\r\nmade money by losing the race,--where was it and whence had it come?\r\nWas it not clear that a conspiracy might have been made without his\r\nknowledge;--and clear also that the real conspirators had levanted?\r\nHe had not levanted! The hounds were his own. He had undertaken to\r\nhunt the country for this season, and they had undertaken to pay\r\nhim a certain sum of money. He should expect and demand that sum of\r\nmoney. If they chose to make any other arrangement for the year\r\nfollowing they could do so. Then he sat down and the meeting was\r\nadjourned,--the secretary having declared that he would not act in\r\nthat capacity any longer, nor collect the funds. A farmer had also\r\nasserted that he and his friends had resolved that Major Tifto should\r\nnot ride over their fields. On the next day the Major had his hounds\r\nout, and some of the London men, with a few of the neighbours, joined\r\nhim. Gates were locked; but the hounds ran, and those who chose to\r\nride managed to follow them. There are men who will stick to their\r\nsport though Apollyon himself should carry the horn. Who cares\r\nwhether the lady who fills a theatre be or be not a moral young\r\nwoman, or whether the bandmaster who keeps such excellent time in a\r\nball has or has not paid his debts? There were men of this sort who\r\nsupported Major Tifto;--but then there was a general opinion that\r\nthe Runnymede hunt would come to an end unless a new Master could be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThen in the first week in November a special meeting was called at\r\nthe Beargarden, at which Lord Silverbridge was asked to attend. "It\r\nis impossible that he should be allowed to remain in the club." This\r\nwas said to Lord Silverbridge by Mr. Lupton. "Either he must go or\r\nthe club must be broken up."\r\n\r\nSilverbridge was very unhappy on the occasion. He had at last been\r\nreasoned into believing that the horse had been made the victim of\r\nfoul play; but he persisted in saying that there was no conclusive\r\nevidence against Tifto. The matter was argued with him. Tifto had\r\nlaid bets against the horse; Tifto had been hand-and-glove with\r\nGreen; Tifto could not have been absent from the horse above two\r\nminutes; the thing could not have been arranged without Tifto. As\r\nhe had brought Tifto into the club, and had been his partner on the\r\nturf, it was his business to look into the matter. "But for all\r\nthat," said he, "I\'m not going to jump on a man when he\'s down,\r\nunless I feel sure that he\'s guilty."\r\n\r\nThen the meeting was held, and Tifto himself appeared. When the\r\naccusation was made by Mr. Lupton, who proposed that he should be\r\nexpelled, he burst into tears. The whole story was repeated,--the\r\nnail, and the hammer, and the lameness; and the moments were counted\r\nup, and poor Tifto\'s bets and friendship with Green were made\r\napparent,--and the case was submitted to the club. An old gentleman\r\nwho had been connected with the turf all his life, and who would not\r\nhave scrupled, by square betting, to rob his dearest friend of his\r\nlast shilling, seconded the proposition,--telling all the story over\r\nagain. Then Major Tifto was asked whether he wished to say anything.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to say that I\'m here," said Tifto, still crying, "and if\r\nI\'d done anything of that kind, of course I\'d have gone with the rest\r\nof \'em. I put it to Lord Silverbridge to say whether I\'m that sort of\r\nfellow." Then he sat down.\r\n\r\nUpon this there was a pause, and the club was manifestly of opinion\r\nthat Lord Silverbridge ought to say something. "I think that Major\r\nTifto should not have betted against the horse," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I can explain that," said the Major. "Let me explain that. Everybody\r\nknows that I\'m a man of small means. I wanted to \'edge, I only wanted\r\nto \'edge."\r\n\r\nMr. Lupton shook his head. "Why have you not shown me your book?"\r\n\r\n"I told you before that it was stolen. Green got hold of it. I did\r\nwin a little. I never said I didn\'t. But what has that to do with\r\nhammering a nail into a horse\'s foot? I have always been true to you,\r\nLord Silverbridge, and you ought to stick up for me now."\r\n\r\n"I will have nothing further to do with the matter," said\r\nSilverbridge, "one way or the other," and he walked out of the\r\nroom,--and out of the club. The affair was ended by a magnanimous\r\ndeclaration on the part of Major Tifto that he would not remain in a\r\nclub in which he was suspected, and by a consent on the part of the\r\nmeeting to receive the Major\'s instant resignation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\nThe Duke\'s Arguments\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke before he left Custins had an interview with Lady Cantrip,\r\nat which that lady found herself called upon to speak her mind\r\nfreely. "I don\'t think she cares about Lord Popplecourt," Lady\r\nCantrip said.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I don\'t know why she should," said the Duke, who was often\r\nvery aggravating even to his friend.\r\n\r\n"But as we had thought--"\r\n\r\n"She ought to do as she is told," said the Duke, remembering how\r\nobedient his Glencora had been. "Has he spoken to her?"\r\n\r\n"I think not."\r\n\r\n"Then how can we tell?"\r\n\r\n"I asked her to see him, but she expressed so much dislike that I\r\ncould not press it. I am afraid, Duke, that you will find it\r\ndifficult to deal with her."\r\n\r\n"I have found it very difficult!"\r\n\r\n"As you have trusted me so much--"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I have trusted you, and do trust you. I hope you understand\r\nthat I appreciate your kindness."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps then you will let me say what I think."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Lady Cantrip."\r\n\r\n"Mary is a very peculiar girl,--with great gifts,--but--"\r\n\r\n"But what?"\r\n\r\n"She is obstinate. Perhaps it would be fairer to say that she has\r\ngreat firmness of character. It is within your power to separate her\r\nfrom Mr. Tregear. It would be foreign to her character to--to--leave\r\nyou, except with your approbation."\r\n\r\n"You mean, she will not run away."\r\n\r\n"She will do nothing without your permission. But she will remain\r\nunmarried unless she be allowed to marry Mr. Tregear."\r\n\r\n"What do you advise then?"\r\n\r\n"That you should yield. As regards money, you could give them what\r\nthey want. Let him go into public life. You could manage that for\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"He is Conservative!"\r\n\r\n"What does that matter when the question is one of your daughter\'s\r\nhappiness? Everybody tells me that he is clever and well conducted."\r\n\r\nHe betrayed nothing by his face as this was said to him. But as he\r\ngot into the carriage he was a miserable man. It is very well to tell\r\na man that he should yield, but there is nothing so wretched to a man\r\nas yielding. Young people and women have to yield,--but for such a\r\nman as this, to yield is in itself a misery. In this matter the Duke\r\nwas quite certain of the propriety of his judgment. To yield would\r\nbe not only to mortify himself, but to do wrong at the same time. He\r\nhad convinced himself that the Popplecourt arrangement would come to\r\nnothing. Nor had he and Lady Cantrip combined been able to exercise\r\nover her the sort of power to which Lady Glencora had been subjected.\r\nIf he persevered,--and he still was sure, almost sure, that he would\r\npersevere,--his object must be achieved after a different fashion.\r\nThere must be infinite suffering,--suffering both to him and to her.\r\nCould she have been made to consent to marry someone else, terrible\r\nas the rupture might have been, she would have reconciled herself at\r\nlast to her new life. So it had been with his Glencora, after a time.\r\nNow the misery must go on from day to day beneath his eyes, with the\r\nknowledge on his part that he was crushing all joy out of her young\r\nlife, and the conviction on her part that she was being treated with\r\ncontinued cruelty by her father! It was a terrible prospect! But if\r\nit was manifestly his duty to act after this fashion, must he not do\r\nhis duty?\r\n\r\nIf he were to find that by persevering in this course he would doom\r\nher to death, or perchance to madness,--what then? If it were right,\r\nhe must still do it. He must still do it, if the weakness incident to\r\nhis human nature did not rob him of the necessary firmness. If every\r\nfoolish girl were indulged, all restraint would be lost, and there\r\nwould be an end to those rules as to birth and position by which he\r\nthought his world was kept straight. And then, mixed with all this,\r\nwas his feeling of the young man\'s arrogance in looking for such a\r\nmatch. Here was a man without a shilling, whose manifest duty it was\r\nto go to work so that he might earn his bread, who instead of doing\r\nso, had hoped to raise himself to wealth and position by entrapping\r\nthe heart of an unwary girl! There was something to the Duke\'s\r\nthinking base in this, and much more base because the unwary girl was\r\nhis own daughter. That such a man as Tregear should make an attack\r\nupon him and select his rank, his wealth, and his child as the\r\nstepping-stones by which he intended to rise! What could be so\r\nmean as that a man should seek to live by looking out for a wife\r\nwith money? But what so impudent, so arrogant, so unblushingly\r\ndisregardful of propriety, as that he should endeavour to select\r\nhis victim from such a family as that of the Pallisers, and that\r\nhe should lay his impious hand on the very daughter of the Duke of\r\nOmnium?\r\n\r\nBut together with all this there came upon him moments of ineffable\r\ntenderness. He felt as though he longed to take her in his arms and\r\ntell her, that if she were unhappy, so would he be unhappy too,--to\r\nmake her understand that a hard necessity had made this sorrow common\r\nto them both. He thought that, if she would only allow it, he could\r\nspeak of her love as a calamity which had befallen them, as from the\r\nhand of fate, and not as a fault. If he could make a partnership in\r\nmisery with her, so that each might believe that each was acting for\r\nthe best, then he could endure all that might come. But, as he was\r\nwell aware, she regarded him as being simply cruel to her. She did\r\nnot understand that he was performing an imperative duty. She had set\r\nher heart upon a certain object, and having taught herself that in\r\nthat way happiness might be reached, had no conception that there\r\nshould be something in the world, some idea of personal dignity, more\r\nvaluable to her than the fruition of her own desires! And yet every\r\nword he spoke to her was affectionate. He knew that she was bruised,\r\nand if it might be possible he would pour oil into her wounds,--even\r\nthough she would not recognise the hand which relieved her.\r\n\r\nThey slept one night in town,--where they encountered Silverbridge\r\nsoon after his retreat from the Beargarden. "I cannot quite make up\r\nmy mind, sir, about that fellow Tifto," he said to his father.\r\n\r\n"I hope you have made up your mind that he is no fit companion for\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"That\'s over. Everybody understands that, sir."\r\n\r\n"Is anything more necessary?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like feeling that he has been ill-used. They have made him\r\nresign the club, and I fancy they won\'t have him at the hunt."\r\n\r\n"He has lost no money by you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no."\r\n\r\n"Then I think you may be indifferent. From all that I hear I think he\r\nmust have won money,--which will probably be a consolation to him."\r\n\r\n"I think they have been hard upon him," continued Silverbridge. "Of\r\ncourse he is not a good man, nor a gentleman, nor possessed of very\r\nhigh feelings. But a man is not to be sacrificed altogether for that.\r\nThere are so many men who are not gentlemen, and so many gentlemen\r\nwho are bad fellows."\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt Mr. Lupton knew what he was about," replied the\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning the Duke and Lady Mary went down to Matching,\r\nand as they sat together in the carriage after leaving the railway\r\nthe father endeavoured to make himself pleasant to his daughter. "I\r\nsuppose we shall stay at Matching now till Christmas," he said.\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"Whom would you like to have here?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any one, papa."\r\n\r\n"You will be very sad without somebody. Would you like the Finns?"\r\n\r\n"If you please, papa. I like her. He never talks anything but\r\npolitics."\r\n\r\n"He is none the worse for that, Mary. I wonder whether Lady Mabel\r\nGrex would come."\r\n\r\n"Lady Mabel Grex!"\r\n\r\n"Do you not like her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I like her;--but what made you think of her, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Silverbridge would come to us then."\r\n\r\nLady Mary thought that she knew a great deal more about that than her\r\nfather did. "Is he fond of Lady Mabel, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--I don\'t know. There are secrets which should not be told. I\r\nthink they are very good friends. I would not have her asked unless\r\nit would please you."\r\n\r\n"I like her very much, papa."\r\n\r\n"And perhaps we might get the Boncassens to come to us. I did say\r\na word to him about it." Now, as Mary felt, difficulty was heaping\r\nitself upon difficulty. "I have seldom met a man in whose company I\r\ncould take more pleasure than in that of Mr. Boncassen; and the young\r\nlady seems to be worthy of her father." Mary was silent, feeling the\r\ncomplication of the difficulties. "Do you not like her?" asked the\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\n"Very much indeed," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Then let us fix a day and ask them. If you will come to me after\r\ndinner with an almanac we will arrange it. Of course you will invite\r\nthat Miss Cassewary too?"\r\n\r\nThe complication seemed to be very bad indeed. In the first place was\r\nit not clear that she, Lady Mary, ought not to be a party to asking\r\nMiss Boncassen to meet her brother at Matching? Would it not be\r\nimperative on her part to tell her father the whole story? And yet\r\nhow could she do that? It had been told her in confidence, and\r\nshe remembered what her own feelings had been when Mrs. Finn had\r\nsuggested the propriety of telling the story which had been told\r\nto her! And how would it be possible to ask Lady Mabel to come to\r\nMatching to meet Miss Boncassen in the presence of Silverbridge? If\r\nthe party could be made up without Silverbridge things might run\r\nsmoothly.\r\n\r\nAs she was thinking of this in her own room, thinking also how happy\r\nshe could be if one other name might be added to the list of guests,\r\nthe Duke had gone alone into his library. There a pile of letters\r\nreached him, among which he found one marked "Private," and addressed\r\nin a hand which he did not recognise. This he opened suddenly,--with\r\na conviction that it would contain a thorn,--and, turning over the\r\npage, found the signature to it was "Francis Tregear." The man\'s name\r\nwas wormwood to him. He at once felt that he would wish to have his\r\ndinner, his fragment of a dinner, brought to him in that solitary\r\nroom, and that he might remain secluded for the rest of the evening.\r\nBut still he must read the letter;--and he read it.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR LORD DUKE,\r\n\r\n   If my mode of addressing your Grace be too familiar I hope\r\n   you will excuse it. It seems to me that if I were to use\r\n   one more distant, I should myself be detracting something\r\n   from my right to make the claim which I intend to put\r\n   forward. You know what my feelings are in reference to\r\n   your daughter. I do not pretend to suppose that they\r\n   should have the least weight with you. But you know also\r\n   what her feelings are for me. A man seems to be vain when\r\n   he expresses his conviction of a woman\'s love for himself.\r\n   But this matter is so important to her as well as to me\r\n   that I am compelled to lay aside all pretence. If she do\r\n   not love me as I love her, then the whole thing drops to\r\n   the ground. Then it will be for me to take myself off from\r\n   out of your notice,--and from hers, and to keep to myself\r\n   whatever heart-breaking I may have to undergo. But if she\r\n   be as steadfast in this matter as I am,--if her happiness\r\n   be fixed on marrying me as mine is on marrying her,--then,\r\n   I think, I am entitled to ask you whether you are\r\n   justified in keeping us apart.\r\n\r\n   I know well what are the discrepancies. Speaking from my\r\n   own feeling I regard very little those of rank. I believe\r\n   myself to be as good a gentleman as though my father\'s\r\n   forefathers had sat for centuries past in the House of\r\n   Lords. I believe that you would have thought so also, had\r\n   you and I been brought in contact on any other subject.\r\n   The discrepancy in regard to money is, I own, a great\r\n   trouble to me. Having no wealth of my own I wish that your\r\n   daughter were so circumstanced that I could go out into\r\n   the world and earn bread for her. I know myself so well\r\n   that I dare say positively that her money,--if it be that\r\n   she will have money,--had no attractions for me when I\r\n   first became acquainted with her, and adds nothing now to\r\n   the persistency with which I claim her hand.\r\n\r\n   But I venture to ask whether you can dare to keep us apart\r\n   if her happiness depends on her love for me? It is now\r\n   more than six months since I called upon you in London and\r\n   explained my wishes. You will understand me when I say\r\n   that I cannot be contented to sit idle, trusting simply to\r\n   the assurance which I have of her affection. Did I doubt\r\n   it, my way would be more clear. I should feel in that case\r\n   that she would yield to your wishes, and I should then, as\r\n   I have said before, just take myself out of the way. But\r\n   if it be not so, then I am bound to do something,--on her\r\n   behalf as well as my own. What am I to do? Any endeavour\r\n   to meet her clandestinely is against my instincts,\r\n   and would certainly be rejected by her. A secret\r\n   correspondence would be equally distasteful to both of us.\r\n   Whatever I do in this matter, I wish you to know that I do\r\n   it.\r\n\r\n   Yours always,\r\n   Most faithfully, and with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\n   FRANCIS TREGEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe read the letter very carefully, and at first was simply astonished\r\nby what he considered to be the unparalleled arrogance of the young\r\nman. In regard to rank this young gentleman thought himself to be\r\nas good as anybody else! In regard to money he did acknowledge some\r\ninferiority. But that was a misfortune, and could not be helped! Not\r\nonly was the letter arrogant;--but the fact that he should dare to\r\nwrite any letter on such a subject was proof of most unpardonable\r\narrogance. The Duke walked about the room thinking of it till he was\r\nalmost in a passion. Then he read the letter again and was gradually\r\npervaded by a feeling of its manliness. Its arrogance remained,\r\nbut with its arrogance there was a certain boldness which induced\r\nrespect. Whether I am such a son-in-law as you would like or not, it\r\nis your duty to accept me, if by refusing to do so you will render\r\nyour daughter miserable. That was Mr. Tregear\'s argument. He himself\r\nmight be prepared to argue in answer that it was his duty to reject\r\nsuch a son-in-law, even though by rejecting him he might make his\r\ndaughter miserable. He was not shaken; but with his condemnation of\r\nthe young man there was mingled something of respect.\r\n\r\nHe continued to digest the letter before the hour of dinner, and\r\nwhen the almanac was brought to him he fixed on certain days. The\r\nBoncassens he knew would be free from engagements in ten days\' time.\r\nAs to Lady Mabel, he seemed to think it almost certain that she would\r\ncome. "I believe she is always going about from one house to another\r\nat this time of the year," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"I think she will come to us if it be possible," said the Duke. "And\r\nyou must write to Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"And what about Mr. and Mrs. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"She promised she would come again, you know. They are at their own\r\nplace in Surrey. They will come unless they have friends with them.\r\nThey have no shooting, and nothing brings people together now except\r\nshooting. I suppose there are things here to be shot. And be sure you\r\nwrite to Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\nThe Duke\'s Guests\r\n\r\n\r\n"The Duke of Omnium presents his compliments to Mr. Francis Tregear,\r\nand begs to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Tregear\'s letter of ----.\r\nThe Duke has no other communication to make to Mr. Tregear, and must\r\nbeg to decline any further correspondence." This was the reply which\r\nthe Duke wrote to the applicant for his daughter\'s hand. And he wrote\r\nit at once. He had acknowledged to himself that Tregear had shown a\r\ncertain manliness in his appeal; but not on that account was such a\r\nman to have all that he demanded! It seemed to the Duke that there\r\nwas no alternative between such a note as that given above and a\r\ntotal surrender.\r\n\r\nBut the post did not go out during the night, and the note lay hidden\r\nin the Duke\'s private drawer till the morning. There was still that\r\n"locus poenitentiae" which should be accorded to all letters written\r\nin anger. During the day he thought over it all constantly, not\r\nin any spirit of yielding, not descending a single step from that\r\naltitude of conviction which made him feel that it might be his duty\r\nabsolutely to sacrifice his daughter,--but asking himself whether it\r\nmight not be well that he should explain the whole matter at length\r\nto the young man. He thought he could put the matter strongly. It\r\nwas not by his own doing that he belonged to an aristocracy which,\r\nif all exclusiveness were banished from it, must cease to exist.\r\nBut being what he was, having been born to such privileges and\r\nsuch limitations, was he not bound in duty to maintain a certain\r\nexclusiveness? He would appeal to the young man himself to say\r\nwhether marriage ought to be free between all classes of the\r\ncommunity. And if not between all, who was to maintain the limits but\r\nthey to whom authority in such matters is given? So much in regard\r\nto rank! And then he would ask this young man whether he thought\r\nit fitting that a young man whose duty, according to all known\r\nprinciples, it must be to earn his bread, should avoid that manifest\r\nduty by taking a wife who could maintain him. As he roamed about his\r\npark alone he felt that he could write such a letter as would make an\r\nimpression even upon a lover. But when he had come back to his study,\r\nother reflections came to his aid. Though he might write the most\r\nappropriate letter in the world, would there not certainly be a\r\nreply? As to conviction, had he ever known an instance of a man\r\nwho had been convinced by an adversary? Of course there would be a\r\nreply,--and replies. And to such a correspondence there would be\r\nno visible end. Words when once written remain, or may remain, in\r\ntestimony for ever. So at last when the moment came he sent off those\r\nthree lines, with his uncourteous compliments and his demand that\r\nthere should be no further correspondence.\r\n\r\nAt dinner he endeavoured to make up for this harshness by increased\r\ntenderness to his daughter, who was altogether ignorant of the\r\ncorrespondence. "Have you written your letters, dear?" She said she\r\nhad written them.\r\n\r\n"I hope the people will come."\r\n\r\n"If it will make you comfortable, papa!"\r\n\r\n"It is for your sake I wish them to be here. I think that Lady Mabel\r\nand Miss Boncassen are just such girls as you would like."\r\n\r\n"I do like them; only--"\r\n\r\n"Only what?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Boncassen is an American."\r\n\r\n"Is that an objection? According to my ideas it is desirable to\r\nbecome acquainted with persons of various nations. I have heard, no\r\ndoubt, many stories of the awkward manners displayed by American\r\nladies. If you look for them you may probably find American women who\r\nare not polished. I do not think I shall calumniate my own country if\r\nI say the same of English women. It should be our object to select\r\nfor our own acquaintances the best we can find of all countries. It\r\nseems to me that Miss Boncassen is a young lady with whom any other\r\nyoung lady might be glad to form an acquaintance."\r\n\r\nThis was a little sermon which Mary was quite contented to endure in\r\nsilence. She was, in truth, fond of the young American beauty, and\r\nhad felt a pleasure in the intimacy which the girl had proposed to\r\nher. But she thought it inexpedient that Miss Boncassen, Lady Mabel,\r\nand Silverbridge should be at Matching together. Therefore she made a\r\nreply to her father\'s sermon which hardly seemed to go to the point\r\nat issue. "She is so beautiful!" she said.\r\n\r\n"Very beautiful," said the Duke. "But what has that to do with it?\r\nMy girl need not be jealous of any girl\'s beauty." Mary laughed and\r\nshook her head. "What is it, then?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Silverbridge might admire her."\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt he would,--or does, for I am aware that they have\r\nmet. But why should he not admire her?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Lady Mary sheepishly.\r\n\r\n"I fancy that there is no danger in that direction. I think\r\nSilverbridge understands what is expected from him." Had not\r\nSilverbridge plainly shown that he understood what was expected from\r\nhim when he selected Lady Mabel? Nothing could have been more proper,\r\nand the Duke had been altogether satisfied. That in such a matter\r\nthere should have been a change in so short a time did not occur to\r\nhim. Poor Mary was now completely silenced. She had been told that\r\nSilverbridge understood what was expected from him; and of course\r\ncould not fail to carry home to herself an accusation that she failed\r\nto understand what was expected from her.\r\n\r\nShe had written her letters, but had not as yet sent them. Those to\r\nMrs. Finn and to the two young ladies had been easy enough. Could Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Finn come to Matching on the 20th of November? "Papa says\r\nthat you promised to return, and thinks this time will perhaps\r\nsuit you." And then to Lady Mabel: "Do come if you can; and papa\r\nparticularly says that he hopes Miss Cassewary will come also." To\r\nMiss Boncassen she had written a long letter, but that too had been\r\nwritten very easily. "I write to you instead of your mamma, because I\r\nknow you. You must tell her that, and then she will not be angry. I\r\nam only papa\'s messenger, and I am to say how much he hopes that you\r\nwill come on the 20th. Mr. Boncassen is to bring the whole British\r\nMuseum if he wishes." Then there was a little postscript which showed\r\nthat there was already considerable intimacy between the two young\r\nladies. "We won\'t have either Mr. L. or Lord P." Not a word was said\r\nabout Lord Silverbridge. There was not even an initial to indicate\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nBut the letter to her brother was more difficult. In her epistles to\r\nthose others she had so framed her words as if possible to bring them\r\nto Matching. But in writing to her brother, she was anxious so to\r\nwrite as to deter him from coming. She was bound to obey her father\'s\r\ncommands. He had desired that Silverbridge should be asked to\r\ncome,--and he was asked to come. But she craftily endeavoured so to\r\nword the invitation that he should be induced to remain away. "It is\r\nall papa\'s doing," she said; "and I am glad that he should like to\r\nhave people here. I have asked the Finns, with whom papa seems to\r\nhave made up everything. Mr. Warburton will be here of course, and I\r\nthink Mr. Moreton is coming. He seems to think that a certain amount\r\nof shooting ought to be done. Then I have invited Lady Mabel Grex and\r\nMiss Cassewary,--all of papa\'s choosing, and the Boncassens. Now you\r\nwill know whether the set will suit you. Papa has particularly begged\r\nthat you will come,--apparently because of Lady Mabel. I don\'t at all\r\nknow what that means. Perhaps you do. As I like Lady Mabel, I hope\r\nshe will come." Surely Silverbridge would not run himself into the\r\njaws of the lion. When he heard that he was specially expected by\r\nhis father to come to Matching in order that he might make himself\r\nagreeable to one young lady, he would hardly venture to come, seeing\r\nthat he would be bound to make love to another young lady!\r\n\r\nTo Mary\'s great horror, all the invitations were accepted. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Finn were quite at the Duke\'s disposal. That she had expected.\r\nThe Boncassens would all come. This was signified in a note from\r\nIsabel, which covered four sides of the paper and was full of fun.\r\nBut under her signature had been written a few words,--not in\r\nfun,--words which Lady Mary perfectly understood. "I wonder, I\r\nwonder, I wonder!" Did the Duke when inviting her know anything of\r\nhis son\'s inclinations? Would he be made to know them now, during\r\nthis visit? And what would he say when he did know them?\r\n\r\nThat the Boncassens would come was a matter of course; but Mary had\r\nthought that Lady Mabel would refuse. She had told Lady Mabel that\r\nthe Boncassens had been asked, and to her thinking it had not been\r\nimprobable that the young lady would be unwilling to meet her rival\r\nat Matching. But the invitation was accepted.\r\n\r\nBut it was her brother\'s ready acquiescence which troubled Mary\r\nchiefly. He wrote as though there were no doubt about the matter.\r\n"Of course there is a deal of shooting to be done," he said, "and I\r\nconsider myself bound to look after it. There ought not to be less\r\nthan four guns,--particularly if Warburton is to be one of them. I\r\nlike Warburton very much, and I think he shoots badly to ingratiate\r\nhimself with the governor. I wonder whether the governor would get\r\nleave for Gerald for a week. He has been sticking to his work like\r\na brick. If not, would he mind my bringing someone? You ask the\r\ngovernor and let me know. I\'ll be there on the 20th. I wonder whether\r\nthey\'ll let me hear what goes on among them about politics. I\'m sure\r\nthere is not one of them hates Sir Timothy worse than I do. Lady Mab\r\nis a brick, and I\'m glad you have asked her. I don\'t think she\'ll\r\ncome, as she likes shutting herself up at Grex. Miss Boncassen is\r\nanother brick. And if you can manage about Gerald I will say that you\r\nare a third."\r\n\r\nThis would have been all very well had she not known that secret.\r\nCould it be that Miss Boncassen had been mistaken? She was forced to\r\nwrite again to say that her father did not think it right that Gerald\r\nshould be brought away from his studies for the sake of shooting, and\r\nthat the necessary fourth gun would be there in the person of one\r\nBarrington Erle. Then she added: "Lady Mabel Grex is coming, and so\r\nis Miss Boncassen." But to this she received no reply.\r\n\r\nThough Silverbridge had written to his sister in his usual careless\r\nstyle, he had considered the matter much. The three months were over.\r\nHe had no idea of any hesitation on his part. He had asked her to be\r\nhis wife, and he was determined to go on with his suit. Had he ever\r\nbeen enabled to make the same request to Mabel Grex, or had she\r\nanswered him when he did half make it in a serious manner, he would\r\nhave been true to her. He had not told his father, or his sister,\r\nor his friends, as Isabel had suggested. He would not do so till\r\nhe should have received some more certain answer from her. But in\r\nrespect to his love he was prepared to be quite as obstinate as his\r\nsister. It was a matter for his own consideration, and he would\r\nchoose for himself. The three months were over, and it was now his\r\nbusiness to present himself to the lady again.\r\n\r\nThat Lady Mabel should also be at Matching, would certainly be a\r\nmisfortune. He thought it probable that she, knowing that Isabel\r\nBoncassen and he would be there together, would refuse the\r\ninvitation. Surely she ought to do so. That was his opinion when he\r\nwrote to his sister. When he heard afterwards that she intended to\r\nbe there, he could only suppose that she was prepared to accept the\r\ncircumstances as they stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\nMiss Boncassen Tells the Truth\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of the month all the guests came rattling in at Matching\r\none after another. The Boncassens were the first, but Lady Mabel with\r\nMiss Cassewary followed them quickly. Then came the Finns, and with\r\nthem Barrington Erle. Lord Silverbridge was the last. He arrived by a\r\ntrain which reached the station at 7 P.M., and only entered the house\r\nas his father was taking Mrs. Boncassen into the dining-room. He\r\ndressed himself in ten minutes, and joined the party as they had\r\nfinished their fish. "I am awfully sorry," he said, rushing up to his\r\nfather, "but I thought that I should just hit it."\r\n\r\n"There is no occasion for awe," said the Duke, "as a sufficiency of\r\ndinner is left. But how you should have hit it, as you say,--seeing\r\nthat the train is not due at Bridstock till 7.05, I do not know."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve done it often, sir," said Silverbridge, taking the seat left\r\nvacant for him next to Lady Mabel. "We\'ve had a political caucus of\r\nthe party,--all the members who could be got together in London,--at\r\nSir Timothy\'s, and I was bound to attend."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve all heard of that," said Phineas Finn.\r\n\r\n"And we pretty well know all the points of Sir Timothy\'s eloquence,"\r\nsaid Barrington Erle.\r\n\r\n"I am not going to tell any of the secrets. I have no doubt that\r\nthere were reporters present, and you will see the whole of it in the\r\npapers to-morrow." Then Silverbridge turned to his neighbour. "Well,\r\nLady Mab, and how are you this long time?"\r\n\r\n"But how are you? Think what you have gone through since we were at\r\nKillancodlem!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk of it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is not to be talked of."\r\n\r\n"Though upon the whole it has happened very luckily. I have got rid\r\nof the accursed horses, and my governor has shown what a brick he can\r\nbe. I don\'t think there is another man in England who would have done\r\nas he did."\r\n\r\n"There are not many who could."\r\n\r\n"There are fewer who would. When they came into my bedroom that\r\nmorning and told me that the horse could not run, I thought I should\r\nhave broken my heart. Seventy thousand pounds gone!"\r\n\r\n"Seventy thousand pounds!"\r\n\r\n"And the honour and glory of winning the race! And then the feeling\r\nthat one had been so awfully swindled! Of course I had to look as\r\nthough I did not care a straw about it, and to go and see the race,\r\nwith a jaunty air and a cigar in my mouth. That is what I call hard\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"But you did it!"\r\n\r\n"I tried. I wish I could explain to you my state of mind that day.\r\nIn the first place the money had to be got. Though it was to go into\r\nthe hands of swindlers, still it had to be paid. I don\'t know how\r\nyour father and Percival get on together;--but I felt very like the\r\nprodigal son."\r\n\r\n"It is very different with papa."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. I felt very like hanging myself when I was alone that\r\nevening. And now everything is right again."\r\n\r\n"I am glad that everything is right," she said, with a strong\r\nemphasis on the "everything."\r\n\r\n"I have done with racing, at any rate. The feeling of being in the\r\npower of a lot of low blackguards is so terrible! I did love the poor\r\nbrute so dearly. And now what have you been doing?"\r\n\r\n"Just nothing;--and have seen nobody. I went back to Grex after\r\nleaving Killancodlem, and shut myself up in my misery."\r\n\r\n"Why misery?"\r\n\r\n"Why misery! What a question for you to ask! Though I love Grex, I am\r\nnot altogether fond of living alone; and though Grex has its charms,\r\nthey are of a melancholy kind. And when I think of the state of our\r\nfamily affairs, that is not reassuring. Your father has just paid\r\nseventy thousand pounds for you. My father has been good enough to\r\ntake something less than a quarter of that sum from me;--but still it\r\nwas all that I was ever to have."\r\n\r\n"Girls don\'t want money."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t they? When I look forward it seems to me that a time will come\r\nwhen I shall want it very much."\r\n\r\n"You will marry," he said. She turned round for a moment and looked\r\nat him, full in the face, after such a fashion that he did not dare\r\nto promise her further comfort in that direction. "Things always do\r\ncome right, somehow."\r\n\r\n"Let us hope so. Only nothing has ever come right with me yet. What\r\nis Frank doing?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t seen him since he left Crummie-Toddie."\r\n\r\n"And your sister?" she whispered.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about it at all."\r\n\r\n"And you? I have told you everything about myself."\r\n\r\n"As for me, I think of nothing but politics now. I have told you\r\nabout my racing experiences. Just at present shooting is up. Before\r\nChristmas I shall go into Chiltern\'s country for a little hunting."\r\n\r\n"You can hunt here?"\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t stay long enough to make it worth while to have my horses\r\ndown. If Tregear will go with me to the Brake, I can mount him for a\r\nday or two. But I dare say you know more of his plans than I do. He\r\nwent to see you at Grex."\r\n\r\n"And you did not."\r\n\r\n"I was not asked."\r\n\r\n"Nor was he."\r\n\r\n"Then all I can say is," replied Silverbridge, speaking in a low\r\nvoice, but with considerable energy, "that he can use a freedom with\r\nLady Mabel Grex upon which I cannot venture."\r\n\r\n"I believe you begrudge me his friendship. If you had no one else\r\nbelonging to you with whom you could have any sympathy, would not you\r\nfind comfort in a relation who could be almost as near to you as a\r\nbrother?"\r\n\r\n"I do not grudge him to you."\r\n\r\n"Yes; you do. And what business have you to interfere?"\r\n\r\n"None at all;--certainly. I will never do it again."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that, Lord Silverbridge. You ought to have more mercy on\r\nme. You ought to put up with anything from me,--knowing how much I\r\nsuffer."\r\n\r\n"I will put up with anything," said he.\r\n\r\n"Do, do. And now I will try to talk to Mr. Erle."\r\n\r\nMiss Boncassen was sitting on the other side of the table, between\r\nMr. Monk and Phineas Finn, and throughout the dinner talked mock\r\npolitics with the greatest liveliness. Silverbridge when he entered\r\nthe room had gone round the table and had shaken hands with everyone.\r\nBut there had been no other greeting between him and Isabel, nor had\r\nany sign passed from one to the other. No such greeting or sign had\r\nbeen possible. Nothing had been left undone which she had expected,\r\nor hoped. But, though she was lively, nevertheless she kept her eye\r\nupon her lover and Lady Mabel. Lady Mary had said that she thought\r\nher brother was in love with Lady Mabel. Could it be possible? In\r\nher own land she had heard absurd stories,--stories which seemed to\r\nher to be absurd,--of the treachery of lords and countesses, of the\r\nbaseness of aristocrats, of the iniquities of high life in London.\r\nBut her father had told her that, go where she might, she would find\r\npeople in the main to be very like each other. It had seemed to her\r\nthat nothing could be more ingenuous than this young man had been in\r\nthe declaration of his love. No simplest republican could have spoken\r\nmore plainly. But now, at this moment, she could not doubt but that\r\nher lover was very intimate with this other girl. Of course he was\r\nfree. When she had refused to say a word to him of her own love or\r\nwant of love, she had necessarily left him his liberty. When she had\r\nput him off for three months, of course he was to be his own master.\r\nBut what must she think of him if it were so? And how could he have\r\nthe courage to face her in his father\'s house if he intended to treat\r\nher in such a fashion? But of all this she showed nothing, nor was\r\nthere a tone in her voice which betrayed her. She said her last word\r\nto Mr. Monk with so sweet a smile that that old bachelor wished he\r\nwere younger for her sake.\r\n\r\nIn the evening after dinner there was music. It was discovered that\r\nMiss Boncassen sang divinely, and both Lady Mabel and Lady Mary\r\naccompanied her. Mr. Erle, and Mr. Warburton, and Mr. Monk, all of\r\nwhom were unmarried, stood by enraptured. But Lord Silverbridge kept\r\nhimself apart, and interested himself in a description which Mrs.\r\nBoncassen gave him of their young men and their young ladies in the\r\nStates. He had hardly spoken to Miss Boncassen,--till he offered her\r\nsherry or soda-water before she retired for the night. She refused\r\nhis courtesy with her usual smile, but showed no more emotion than\r\nthough they two had now met for the first time in their lives.\r\n\r\nHe had quite made up his mind as to what he would do. When the\r\nopportunity should come in his way he would simply remind her that\r\nthe three months were passed. But he was shy of talking to her in\r\nthe presence of Lady Mabel and his father. He was quite determined\r\nthat the thing should be done at once, but he certainly wished that\r\nLady Mabel had not been there. In what she had said to him at the\r\ndinner-table she had made him understand that she would be a trouble\r\nto him. He remembered her look when he told her she would marry. It\r\nwas as though she had declared to him that it was he who ought to be\r\nher husband. It referred back to that proffer of love which he had\r\nonce made to her. Of course all this was disagreeable. Of course it\r\nmade things difficult for him. But not the less was it a thing quite\r\nassured that he would press his suit to Miss Boncassen. When he was\r\ntalking to Mrs. Boncassen he was thinking of nothing else. When he\r\nwas offering Isabel the glass of sherry he was telling himself that\r\nhe would find his opportunity on the morrow,--though now, at that\r\nmoment, it was impossible that he should make a sign. She, as she\r\nwent to bed, asked herself whether it were possible that there should\r\nbe such treachery;--whether it were possible that he should pass it\r\nall by as though he had never said a word to her!\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the next day, which was Sunday, he was equally\r\nsilent. Immediately after breakfast, on the Monday, shooting\r\ncommenced, and he could not find a moment in which to speak. It\r\nseemed to him that she purposely kept out of his way. With Mabel he\r\ndid find himself for a few minutes alone, and was then interrupted by\r\nhis sister and Isabel. "I hope you have killed a lot of things," said\r\nMiss Boncassen.\r\n\r\n"Pretty well, among us all."\r\n\r\n"What an odd amusement it seems, going out to commit wholesale\r\nslaughter. However it is the proper thing, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Quite the proper thing," said Lord Silverbridge, and that was all.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning he dressed himself for shooting,--and then sent\r\nout the party without him. He had heard, he said, of a young horse\r\nfor sale in the neighbourhood, and had sent to desire that it might\r\nbe brought to him. And now he found his occasion.\r\n\r\n"Come and play a game of billiards," he said to Isabel, as the three\r\ngirls with the other ladies were together in the drawing-room. She\r\ngot up very slowly from her seat, and very slowly crept away to the\r\ndoor. Then she looked round as though expecting the others to follow\r\nher. None of them did follow her. Mary felt that she ought to do so;\r\nbut, knowing all that she knew, did not dare. And what good could she\r\nhave done by one such interruption? Lady Mabel would fain have gone\r\ntoo;--but neither did she quite dare. Had there been no special\r\nreason why she should or should not have gone with them, the thing\r\nwould have been easy enough. When two people go to play billiards, a\r\nthird may surely accompany them. But now, Lady Mabel found that she\r\ncould not stir. Mrs. Finn, Mrs. Boncassen, and Miss Cassewary were\r\nall in the room, but none of them moved. Silverbridge led the way\r\nquickly across the hall, and Isabel Boncassen followed him very\r\nslowly. When she entered the room she found him standing with a cue\r\nin his hand. He at once shut the door, and walking up to her dropped\r\nthe butt of the cue on the floor and spoke one word. "Well!" he said.\r\n\r\n"What does \'well\' mean?"\r\n\r\n"The three months are over."\r\n\r\n"Certainly they are \'over.\'"\r\n\r\n"And I have been a model of patience."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps your patience is more remarkable than your constancy. Is not\r\nLady Mabel Grex in the ascendant just now?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that? Why do you ask that? You told me to wait\r\nfor three months. I have waited, and here I am."\r\n\r\n"How very--very--downright you are."\r\n\r\n"Is not that the proper thing?"\r\n\r\n"I thought I was downright,--but you beat me hollow. Yes, the three\r\nmonths are over. And now what have you got to say?" He put down his\r\ncue, and stretched out his arms as though he were going to take her\r\nand hold her to his heart. "No;--no; not that," she said laughing.\r\n"But if you will speak, I will hear you."\r\n\r\n"You know what I said before. Will you love me, Isabel?"\r\n\r\n"And you know what I said before. Do they know that you love me? Does\r\nyour father know it, and your sister? Why did they ask me to come\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody knows it. But say that you love me, and everyone shall know\r\nit at once. Yes; one person knows it. Why did you mention Lady\r\nMabel\'s name? She knows it."\r\n\r\n"Did you tell her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I went again to Killancodlem after you were gone, and then I\r\ntold her."\r\n\r\n"But why her? Come, Lord Silverbridge. You are straightforward with\r\nme, and I will be the same with you. You have told Lady Mabel; I have\r\ntold Lady Mary."\r\n\r\n"My sister!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--your sister. And I am sure she disapproves it. She did not say\r\nso; but I am sure it is so. And then she told me something."\r\n\r\n"What did she tell you?"\r\n\r\n"Has there never been reason to think that you intended to offer your\r\nhand to Lady Mabel Grex?"\r\n\r\n"Did she tell you so?"\r\n\r\n"You should answer my question, Lord Silverbridge. It is surely one\r\nwhich I have a right to ask." Then she stood waiting for his reply,\r\nkeeping herself at some little distance from him as though she were\r\nafraid that he would fly upon her. And indeed there seemed to be\r\ncause for such fear from the frequent gestures of his hands. "Why do\r\nyou not answer me? Has there been reason for such expectations?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--there has."\r\n\r\n"There has!"\r\n\r\n"I thought of it,--not knowing myself; before I had seen you. You\r\nshall know it all if you will only say that you love me."\r\n\r\n"I should like to know it all first."\r\n\r\n"You do know it all;--almost. I have told you that she knows what I\r\nsaid to you at Killancodlem. Is not that enough?"\r\n\r\n"And she approves!"\r\n\r\n"What has that to do with it? Lady Mabel is my friend, but not my\r\nguardian."\r\n\r\n"Has she a right to expect that she should be your wife?"\r\n\r\n"No;--certainly not. Why should you ask all this? Do you love me?\r\nCome, Isabel; say that you love me. Will you call me vain if I say\r\nthat I almost think you do? You cannot doubt about my love;--not\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"No;--not now."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t. Why won\'t you be as honest to me? If you hate me, say\r\nso;--but if you love me--!"\r\n\r\n"I do not hate you, Lord Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"And is that all?"\r\n\r\n"You asked me the question."\r\n\r\n"But you do love me? By George, I thought you would be more honest\r\nand straightforward."\r\n\r\nThen she dropped her badinage and answered him seriously. "I thought\r\nI had been honest and straightforward. When I found that you were in\r\nearnest at Killancodlem--"\r\n\r\n"Why did you ever doubt me?"\r\n\r\n"When I felt that you were in earnest, then I had to be in earnest\r\ntoo. And I thought so much about it that I lay awake nearly all that\r\nnight. Shall I tell you what I thought?"\r\n\r\n"Tell me something that I should like to hear."\r\n\r\n"I will tell you the truth. \'Is it possible,\' I said to myself, \'that\r\nsuch a man as that can want me to be his wife; he an Englishman, of\r\nthe highest rank and the greatest wealth, and one that any girl in\r\nthe world would love?\'"\r\n\r\n"Psha!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"That is what I said to myself." Then she paused, and looking into\r\nher face he saw that there was a glimmer of a tear in each eye. "One\r\nthat any girl must love when asked for her love;--because he is so\r\nsweet, so good, and so pleasant."\r\n\r\n"I know that you are chaffing."\r\n\r\n"Then I went on asking myself questions. And is it possible that\r\nI, who by all his friends will be regarded as a nobody, who am an\r\nAmerican,--with merely human workaday blood in my veins,--that such a\r\none as I should become his wife? Then I told myself that it was not\r\npossible. It was not in accordance with the fitness of things. All\r\nthe dukes in England would rise up against it, and especially that\r\nduke whose good-will would be imperative."\r\n\r\n"Why should he rise up against it?"\r\n\r\n"You know he will. But I will go on with my story of myself. When I\r\nhad settled that in my mind, I just cried myself to sleep. It had\r\nbeen a dream. I had come across one who in his own self seemed to\r\ncombine all that I had ever thought of as being lovable in a man--"\r\n\r\n"Isabel!"\r\n\r\n"And in his outward circumstances soared as much above my thoughts\r\nas the heaven is above the earth. And he had whispered to me soft,\r\nloving, heavenly words. No;--no, you shall not touch me. But you\r\nshall listen to me. In my sleep I could be happy again and not see\r\nthe barriers. But when I woke I made up my mind. \'If he comes to me\r\nagain,\' I said--\'if it should be that he should come to me again, I\r\nwill tell him that he shall be my heaven on earth,--if,--if,--if the\r\nill-will of his friends would not make that heaven a hell to both of\r\nus.\' I did not tell you quite all that."\r\n\r\n"You told me nothing but that I was to come again in three months."\r\n\r\n"I said more than that. I bade you ask your father. Now you have come\r\nagain. You cannot understand a girl\'s fears and doubts. How should\r\nyou? I thought perhaps you would not come. When I saw you whispering\r\nto that highly-born well-bred beauty, and remembered what I was\r\nmyself, I thought that--you would not come."\r\n\r\n"Then you must love me."\r\n\r\n"Love you! Oh, my darling!--No, no, no," she said, as she retreated\r\nfrom him round the corner of the billiard-table, and stood guarding\r\nherself from him with her little hands. "You ask if I love you. You\r\nare entitled to know the truth. From the sole of your foot to the\r\ncrown of your head I love you as I think a man would wish to be\r\nloved by the girl he loves. You have come across my life, and have\r\nswallowed me up, and made me all your own. But I will not marry you\r\nto be rejected by your people. No; nor shall there be a kiss between\r\nus till I know that it will not be so."\r\n\r\n"May I speak to your father?"\r\n\r\n"For what good? I have not spoken to father or mother because I have\r\nknown that it must depend upon your father. Lord Silverbridge, if\r\nhe will tell me that I shall be his daughter, I will become your\r\nwife,--oh, with such perfect joy, with such perfect truth! If it can\r\nnever be so, then let us be torn apart,--with whatever struggle,\r\nstill at once. In that case I will get myself back to my own country\r\nas best I may, and will pray to God that all this may be forgotten."\r\nThen she made her way round to the door, leaving him fixed to the\r\nspot in which she had been standing. But as she went she made a\r\nlittle prayer to him. "Do not delay my fate. It is all in all to me."\r\nAnd so he was left alone in the billiard-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\n"Then I Am As Proud As a Queen"\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next day or two the shooting went on without much\r\ninterruption from love-making. The love-making was not prosperous all\r\nround. Poor Lady Mary had nothing to comfort her. Could she have been\r\nallowed to see the letter which her lover had written to her father,\r\nthe comfort would have been, if not ample, still very great. Mary\r\ntold herself again and again that she was quite sure of Tregear;--but\r\nit was hard upon her that she could not be made certain that her\r\ncertainty was well grounded. Had she known that Tregear had written,\r\nthough she had not seen a word of his letter, it would have comforted\r\nher. But she had heard nothing of the letter. In June last she had\r\nseen him, by chance, for a few minutes, in Lady Mabel\'s drawing-room.\r\nSince that she had not heard from him or of him. That was now more\r\nthan five months since. How could her love serve her,--how could her\r\nvery life serve her, if things were to go on like that? How was she\r\nto bear it? Thinking of this she resolved--she almost resolved--that\r\nshe would go boldly to her father and desire that she might be given\r\nup to her lover.\r\n\r\nHer brother, though more triumphant,--for how could he fail to\r\ntriumph after such words as Isabel had spoken to him?--still felt his\r\ndifficulties very seriously. She had imbued him with a strong sense\r\nof her own firmness, and she had declared that she would go away and\r\nleave him altogether if the Duke should be unwilling to receive her.\r\nHe knew that the Duke would be unwilling. The Duke, who certainly was\r\nnot handy in those duties of match-making which seemed to have fallen\r\nupon him at the death of his wife, showed by a hundred little signs\r\nhis anxiety that his son and heir should arrange his affairs with\r\nLady Mabel. These signs were manifest to Mary,--were disagreeably\r\nmanifest to Silverbridge,--were unfortunately manifest to Lady Mabel\r\nherself. They were manifest to Mrs. Finn, who was clever enough to\r\nperceive that the inclinations of the young heir were turned in\r\nanother direction. And gradually they became manifest to Isabel\r\nBoncassen. The host himself, as host, was courteous to all his\r\nguests. They had been of his own selection, and he did his best\r\nto make himself pleasant to them all. But he selected two for his\r\npeculiar notice,--and those two were Miss Boncassen and Lady Mabel.\r\nWhile he would himself walk, and talk, and argue after his own\r\npeculiar fashion with the American beauty,--explaining to her matters\r\npolitical and social, till he persuaded her to promise to read his\r\npamphlet upon decimal coinage,--he was always making awkward efforts\r\nto throw Silverbridge and Lady Mabel together. The two girls saw it\r\nall and knew well how the matter was,--knew that they were rivals,\r\nand knew each the ground on which she herself and on which the other\r\nstood. But neither was satisfied with her advantage, or nearly\r\nsatisfied. Isabel would not take the prize without the Duke\'s\r\nconsent;--and Mabel could not have it without that other consent. "If\r\nyou want to marry an English Duke," she once said to Isabel in that\r\nanger which she was unable to restrain, "there is the Duke himself. I\r\nnever saw a man more absolutely in love." "But I do not want to marry\r\nan English Duke," said Isabel, "and I pity any girl who has any idea\r\nof marriage except that which comes from a wish to give back love for\r\nlove."\r\n\r\nThrough it all the father never suspected the real state of his son\'s\r\nmind. He was too simple to think it possible that the purpose which\r\nSilverbridge had declared to him as they walked together from the\r\nBeargarden had already been thrown to the winds. He did not like\r\nto ask why the thing was not settled. Young men, he thought, were\r\nsometimes shy, and young ladies not always ready to give immediate\r\nencouragement. But, when he saw them together, he concluded that\r\nmatters were going in the right direction. It was, however, an\r\nopinion which he had all to himself.\r\n\r\nDuring the three or four days which followed the scene in the\r\nbilliard-room Isabel kept herself out of her lover\'s way. She had\r\nexplained to him that which she wished him to do, and she left him to\r\ndo it. Day by day she watched the circumstances of the life around\r\nher, and knew that it had not been done. She was sure that it could\r\nnot have been done while the Duke was explaining to her the beauty of\r\nquints, and expatiating on the horrors of twelve pennies, and twelve\r\ninches, and twelve ounces,--variegated in some matters by sixteen and\r\nfourteen! He could not know that she was ambitious of becoming his\r\ndaughter-in-law, while he was opening out to her the mysteries of\r\nthe House of Lords, and explaining how it came to pass that while he\r\nwas a member of one House of Parliament, his son should be sitting\r\nas a member of another;--how it was that a nobleman could be a\r\ncommoner, and how a peer of one part of the Empire could sit as the\r\nrepresentative of a borough in another part. She was an apt scholar.\r\nHad there been a question of any other young man marrying her, he\r\nwould probably have thought that no other young man could have done\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nSilverbridge was discontented with himself. The greatest misfortune\r\nwas that Lady Mabel should be there. While she was present to his\r\nfather\'s eyes he did not know how to declare his altered wishes.\r\nEvery now and then she would say to him some little word indicating\r\nher feelings of the absurdity of his passion. "I declare I don\'t know\r\nwhether it is you or your father that Miss Boncassen most affects,"\r\nshe said. But to this and to other similar speeches he would make no\r\nanswer. She had extracted his secret from him at Killancodlem, and\r\nmight use it against him if she pleased. In his present frame of mind\r\nhe was not disposed to joke with her upon the subject.\r\n\r\nOn that second Sunday,--the Boncassens were to return to London on\r\nthe following Tuesday,--he found himself alone with Isabel\'s father.\r\nThe American had been brought out at his own request to see the\r\nstables, and had been accompanied round the premises by Silverbridge\r\nand by Mr. Warburton, by Isabel and by Lady Mary. As they got out\r\ninto the park the party were divided, and Silverbridge found himself\r\nwith Mr. Boncassen. Then it occurred to him that the proper thing\r\nfor a young man in love was to go, not to his own father, but to the\r\nlady\'s father. Why should not he do as others always did? Isabel no\r\ndoubt had suggested a different course. But that which Isabel had\r\nsuggested was at the present moment impossible to him. Now, at this\r\ninstant, without a moment\'s forethought, he determined to tell his\r\nstory to Isabel\'s father,--as any other lover might tell it to any\r\nother father.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to find ourselves alone, Mr. Boncassen," he said. Mr.\r\nBoncassen bowed and showed himself prepared to listen. Though so many\r\nat Matching had seen the whole play, Mr. Boncassen had seen nothing\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether you are aware of what I have got to say."\r\n\r\n"I cannot quite say that I am, my Lord. But whatever it is, I am sure\r\nI shall be delighted to hear it."\r\n\r\n"I want to marry your daughter," said Silverbridge. Isabel had told\r\nhim that he was downright, and in such a matter he had hardly as\r\nyet learned how to express himself with those paraphrases in which\r\nthe world delights. Mr. Boncassen stood stock still, and in the\r\nexcitement of the moment pulled off his hat. "The proper thing is to\r\nask your permission to go on with it."\r\n\r\n"You want to marry my daughter!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. That is what I have got to say."\r\n\r\n"Is she aware of your--intention?"\r\n\r\n"Quite aware. I believe I may say that if other things go straight,\r\nshe will consent."\r\n\r\n"And your father--the Duke?"\r\n\r\n"He knows nothing about it,--as yet."\r\n\r\n"Really this takes me quite by surprise. I am afraid you have not\r\ngiven enough thought to the matter."\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking about it for the last three months," said Lord\r\nSilverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Marriage is a very serious thing."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is."\r\n\r\n"And men generally like to marry their equals."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that. I don\'t think that counts for much. People\r\ndon\'t always know who are their equals."\r\n\r\n"That is quite true. If I were speaking to you or to your father\r\ntheoretically I should perhaps be unwilling to admit superiority on\r\nyour side because of your rank and wealth. I could make an argument\r\nin favour of any equality with the best Briton that ever lived,--as\r\nwould become a true-born Republican."\r\n\r\n"That is just what I mean."\r\n\r\n"But when the question becomes one of practising,--a question for our\r\nlives, for our happiness, for our own conduct, then, knowing what\r\nmust be the feelings of an aristocracy in such a country as this, I\r\nam prepared to admit that your father would be as well justified in\r\nobjecting to a marriage between a child of his and a child of mine,\r\nas I should be in objecting to one between my child and the son of\r\nsome mechanic in our native city."\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t be a gentleman," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"That is a word of which I don\'t quite know the meaning."\r\n\r\n"I do," said Silverbridge confidently.\r\n\r\n"But you could not define it. If a man be well educated, and can keep\r\na good house over his head, perhaps you may call him a gentleman. But\r\nthere are many such with whom your father would not wish to be so\r\nclosely connected as you propose."\r\n\r\n"But I may have your sanction?" Mr. Boncassen again took off his hat\r\nand walked along thoughtfully. "I hope you don\'t object to me\r\npersonally."\r\n\r\n"My dear young lord, your father has gone out of his way to be civil\r\nto me. Am I to return his courtesy by bringing a great trouble upon\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"He seems to be very fond of Miss Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"Will he continue to be fond of her when he has heard this? What does\r\nIsabel say?"\r\n\r\n"She says the same as you, of course."\r\n\r\n"Why of course;--except that it is evident to you as it is to me that\r\nshe could not with propriety say anything else."\r\n\r\n"I think she would,--would like it, you know."\r\n\r\n"She would like to be your wife!"\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes. If it were all serene, I think she would consent."\r\n\r\n"I dare say she would consent,--if it were all serene. Why should she\r\nnot? Do not try her too hard, Lord Silverbridge. You say you love\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Then think of the position in which you are placing her. You are\r\nstruggling to win her heart." Silverbridge as he heard this assured\r\nhimself that there was no need for any further struggling in that\r\ndirection. "Perhaps you have won it. Yet she may feel that she cannot\r\nbecome your wife. She may well say to herself that this which is\r\noffered to her is so great, that she does not know how to refuse it;\r\nand may yet have to say, at the same time, that she cannot accept it\r\nwithout disgrace. You would not put one that you love into such a\r\nposition?"\r\n\r\n"As for disgrace,--that is nonsense. I beg your pardon, Mr.\r\nBoncassen."\r\n\r\n"Would it be no disgrace that she should be known here, in England,\r\nto be your wife, and that none of those of your rank,--of what would\r\nthen be her own rank,--should welcome her into her new world?"\r\n\r\n"That would be out of the question."\r\n\r\n"If your own father refused to welcome her, would not others follow\r\nsuit?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know my father."\r\n\r\n"You seem to know him well enough to fear that he would object."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--that is true."\r\n\r\n"What more do I want to know?"\r\n\r\n"If she were once my wife he would not reject her. Of all human\r\nbeings he is in truth the kindest and most affectionate."\r\n\r\n"And therefore you would try him after this fashion? No, my Lord; I\r\ncannot see my way through these difficulties. You can say what you\r\nplease to him as to your own wishes. But you must not tell him that\r\nyou have any sanction from me."\r\n\r\nThat evening the story was told to Mrs. Boncassen, and the matter\r\nwas discussed among the family. Isabel in talking to them made no\r\nscruple of declaring her own feelings; and though in speaking to\r\nLord Silverbridge she had spoken very much as her father had done\r\nafterwards, yet in this family conclave she took her lover\'s part.\r\n"That is all very well, father," she said; "I told him the same thing\r\nmyself. But if he is man enough to be firm I shall not throw him\r\nover,--not for all the dukes in Europe. I shall not stay here to be\r\npointed at. I will go back home. If he follows me then I shall choose\r\nto forget all about his rank. If he loves me well enough to show that\r\nhe is in earnest, I shall not disappoint him for the sake of pleasing\r\nhis father." To this neither Mr. nor Mrs. Boncassen was able to make\r\nany efficient answer. Mrs. Boncassen, dear good woman, could see\r\nno reason why two young people who loved each other should not be\r\nmarried at once. Dukes and duchesses were nothing to her. If they\r\ncouldn\'t be happy in England, then let them come and live in New\r\nYork. She didn\'t understand that anybody could be too good for her\r\ndaughter. Was there not an idea that Mr. Boncassen would be the next\r\nPresident? And was not the President of the United States as good as\r\nthe Queen of England?\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge, when he left Mr. Boncassen, wandered about the\r\npark by himself. King Cophetua married the beggar\'s daughter. He\r\nwas sure of that. King Cophetua probably had not a father; and the\r\nbeggar, probably, was not high-minded. But the discrepancy in that\r\ncase was much greater. He intended to persevere, trusting much to a\r\nbelief that when once he was married his father would "come round."\r\nHis father always did come round. But the more he thought of it, the\r\nmore impossible it seemed to him that he should ask his father\'s\r\nconsent at the present moment. Lady Mabel\'s presence in the house\r\nwas an insuperable obstacle. He thought that he could do it if he\r\nand his father were alone together, or comparatively alone. He must\r\nbe prepared for an opposition, at any rate of some days, which\r\nopposition would make his father quite unable to entertain his guests\r\nwhile it lasted.\r\n\r\nBut as he could not declare his wishes to his father, and was thus\r\ndisobeying Isabel\'s behests, he must explain the difficulty to her.\r\nHe felt already that she would despise him for his cowardice,--that\r\nshe would not perceive the difficulties in his way, or understand\r\nthat he might injure his cause by precipitation. Then he considered\r\nwhether he might not possibly make some bargain with his father. How\r\nwould it be if he should consent to go back to the Liberal party on\r\nbeing allowed to marry the girl he loved? As far as his political\r\nfeelings were concerned he did not think that he would much object\r\nto make the change. There was only one thing certain,--that he must\r\nexplain his condition to Miss Boncassen before she went.\r\n\r\nHe found no difficulty now in getting the opportunity. She was\r\nequally anxious, and as well disposed to acknowledge her anxiety.\r\nAfter what had passed between them she was not desirous of pretending\r\nthat the matter was one of small moment to herself. She had told him\r\nthat it was all the world to her, and had begged him to let her know\r\nher fate as quickly as possible. On that last Monday morning they\r\nwere in the grounds together, and Lady Mabel, who was walking with\r\nMrs. Finn, saw them pass through a little gate which led from the\r\ngardens into the Priory ruins. "It all means nothing," Mabel said\r\nwith a little laugh to her companion.\r\n\r\n"If so, I am sorry for the young lady," said Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think that one always has to be sorry for the young\r\nladies? Young ladies generally have a bad time of it. Did you ever\r\nhear of a gentleman who had always to roll a stone to the top of a\r\nhill, but it would always come back upon him?"\r\n\r\n"That gentleman I believe never succeeded," said Mrs. Finn. "The\r\nyoung ladies I suppose do sometimes."\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Isabel and Silverbridge were among the ruins\r\ntogether. "This is where the old Pallisers used to be buried," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed. And married, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I dare say. They had a priest of their own, no doubt, which must\r\nhave been convenient. This block of a fellow without any legs left\r\nis supposed to represent Sir Guy. He ran away with half-a-dozen\r\nheiresses, they say. I wish things were as easily done now."\r\n\r\n"Nobody should have run away with me. I have no idea of going on such\r\na journey except on terms of equality,--just step and step alike."\r\nThen she took hold of his arm and put out one foot. "Are you ready?"\r\n\r\n"I am very willing."\r\n\r\n"But are you ready,--for a straightforward walk off to church before\r\nall the world? None of your private chaplains, such as Sir Guy had at\r\nhis command. Just the registrar, if there is nothing better,--so that\r\nit be public, before all the world."\r\n\r\n"I wish we could start this instant."\r\n\r\n"But we can\'t,--can we?"\r\n\r\n"No, dear. So many things have to be settled."\r\n\r\n"And what have you settled on since you last spoke to me?"\r\n\r\n"I have told your father everything."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I know that. What good does that do? Father is not a Duke of\r\nOmnium. No one supposed that he would object."\r\n\r\n"But he did," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--as I do,--for the same reason; because he would not have his\r\ndaughter creep in at a hole. But to your own father you have not\r\nventured to speak." Then he told his story, as best he knew how. It\r\nwas not that he feared his father, but that he felt that the present\r\nmoment was not fit. "He wishes you to marry that Lady Mabel Grex,"\r\nshe said. He nodded his head. "And you will marry her?"\r\n\r\n"Never! I might have done so, had I not seen you. I should have done\r\nso, if she had been willing. But now I never can,--never, never."\r\nHer hand had dropped from his arm, but now she put it up again for a\r\nmoment, so that he might feel the pressure of her fingers. "Say that\r\nyou believe me."\r\n\r\n"I think I do."\r\n\r\n"You know I love you."\r\n\r\n"I think you do. I am sure I hope you do. If you don\'t, then I am--a\r\nmiserable wretch."\r\n\r\n"With all my heart I do."\r\n\r\n"Then I am as proud as a queen. You will tell him soon?"\r\n\r\n"As soon as you are gone. As soon as we are alone together. I\r\nwill;--and then I will follow you to London. Now shall we not say,\r\nGood-bye?"\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, my own," she whispered.\r\n\r\n"You will let me have one kiss?"\r\n\r\nHer hand was in his, and she looked about as though to see that no\r\neyes were watching them. But then, as the thoughts came rushing to\r\nher mind, she changed her purpose. "No," she said. "What is it but a\r\ntrifle! It is nothing in itself. But I have bound myself to myself by\r\ncertain promises, and you must not ask me to break them. You are as\r\nsweet to me as I can be to you, but there shall be no kissing till I\r\nknow that I shall be your wife. Now take me back."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\n"I Don\'t Think She Is a Snake"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Tuesday, the Boncassens went, and then there\r\nwere none of the guests left but Mrs. Finn and Lady Mabel Grex,--with\r\nof course Miss Cassewary. The Duke had especially asked both Mrs.\r\nFinn and Lady Mabel to remain, the former, through his anxiety to\r\nshow his repentance for the injustice he had formerly done her, and\r\nthe latter in the hope that something might be settled as soon as\r\nthe crowd of visitors should have gone. He had never spoken quite\r\ndistinctly to Mabel. He had felt that the manner in which he had\r\nlearned his son\'s purpose,--that which once had been his son\'s\r\npurpose,--forbade him to do so. But he had so spoken as to make Lady\r\nMabel quite aware of his wish. He would not have told her how sure he\r\nwas that Silverbridge would keep no more racehorses, how he trusted\r\nthat Silverbridge had done with betting, how he believed that the\r\nyoung member would take a real interest in the House of Commons, had\r\nhe not intended that she should take a special interest in the young\r\nman. And then he had spoken about the house in London. It was to\r\nbe made over to Silverbridge as soon as Silverbridge should marry.\r\nAnd there was Gatherum Castle. Gatherum was rather a trouble than\r\notherwise. He had ever felt it to be so, but had nevertheless always\r\nkept it open perhaps for a month in the year. His uncle had always\r\nresided there for a fortnight at Christmas. When Silverbridge was\r\nmarried it would become the young man\'s duty to do something of\r\nthe same kind. Gatherum was the White Elephant of the family, and\r\nSilverbridge must enter in upon his share of the trouble. He did not\r\nknow that in saying all this he was offering his son as a husband\r\nto Lady Mabel, but she understood it as thoroughly as though he had\r\nspoken the words.\r\n\r\nBut she knew the son\'s mind also. He had indeed himself told her all\r\nhis mind. "Of course I love her best of all," he had said. When he\r\ntold her of it she had been so overcome that she had wept in her\r\ndespair;--had wept in his presence. She had declared to him her\r\nsecret,--that it had been her intention to become his wife, and\r\nthen he had rejected her! It had all been shame, and sorrow, and\r\ndisappointment to her. And she could not but remember that there had\r\nbeen a moment when she might have secured him by a word. A look would\r\nhave done it; a touch of her finger on that morning. She had known\r\nthen that he had intended to be in earnest,--that he only waited for\r\nencouragement. She had not given it because she had not wished to\r\ngrasp too eagerly at the prize,--and now the prize was gone! She had\r\nsaid that she had spared him;--but then she could afford to joke,\r\nthinking that he would surely come back to her.\r\n\r\nShe had begun her world with so fatal a mistake! When she was quite\r\nyoung, when she was little more than a child but still not a child,\r\nshe had given all her love to a man whom she soon found that it would\r\nbe impossible she should ever marry. He had offered to face the world\r\nwith her, promising to do the best to smooth the rough places, and to\r\nsoften the stones for her feet. But she, young as she was, had felt\r\nthat both he and she belonged to a class which could hardly endure\r\npoverty with contentment. The grinding need for money, the absolute\r\nnecessity of luxurious living, had been pressed upon her from her\r\nchildhood. She had seen it and acknowledged it, and had told him,\r\nwith precocious wisdom, that that which he offered to do for her sake\r\nwould be a folly for them both. She had not stinted the assurance of\r\nher love, but had told him that they must both turn aside and learn\r\nto love elsewhere. He had done so, with too complete readiness!\r\nShe had dreamed of a second love, which should obliterate the\r\nfirst,--which might still leave to her the memory of the romance of\r\nher early passion. Then this boy had come in her way! With him all\r\nher ambition might have been satisfied. She desired high rank and\r\ngreat wealth. With him she might have had it all. And then, too,\r\nthough there would always be the memory of that early passion, yet\r\nshe could in another fashion love this youth. He was pleasant to her,\r\nand gracious;--and she had told herself that if it should be so that\r\nthis great fortune might be hers, she would atone to him fully for\r\nthat past romance by the wife-like devotion of her life. The cup had\r\ncome within the reach of her fingers, but she had not grasped it. Her\r\nhappiness, her triumphs, her great success had been there, present to\r\nher, and she had dallied with her fortune. There had been a day on\r\nwhich he had been all but at her feet, and on the next he had been\r\nprostrate at the feet of another. He had even dared to tell her\r\nso,--saying of that American that "of course he loved her the best!"\r\n\r\nOver and over again since that, she had asked herself whether there\r\nwas no chance. Though he had loved that other one best she would take\r\nhim if it were possible. When the invitation came from the Duke she\r\nwould not lose a chance. She had told him that it was impossible that\r\nhe, the heir to the Duke of Omnium, should marry an American. All his\r\nfamily, all his friends, all his world would be against him. And then\r\nhe was so young,--and, as she thought, so easily led. He was lovable\r\nand prone to love;--but surely his love could not be very strong, or\r\nhe would not have changed so easily.\r\n\r\nShe did not hesitate to own to herself that this American was very\r\nlovely. She too, herself, was beautiful. She too had a reputation for\r\ngrace, loveliness, and feminine high-bred charm. She knew all that,\r\nbut she knew also that her attractions were not so bright as those\r\nof her rival. She could not smile or laugh and throw sparks of\r\nbrilliance around her as did the American girl. Miss Boncassen could\r\nbe graceful as a nymph in doing the awkwardest thing! When she had\r\npretended to walk stiffly along, to some imaginary marriage ceremony,\r\nwith her foot stuck out before her, with her chin in the air, and one\r\narm akimbo, Silverbridge had been all afire with admiration. Lady\r\nMabel understood it all. The American girl must be taken away,--from\r\nout of the reach of the young man\'s senses,--and then the struggle\r\nmust be made.\r\n\r\nLady Mabel had not been long at Matching before she learned that she\r\nhad much in her favour. She perceived that the Duke himself had no\r\nsuspicion of what was going on, and that he was strongly disposed in\r\nher favour. She unravelled it all in her own mind. There must have\r\nbeen some agreement, between the father and the son, when the son had\r\nall but made his offer to her. More than once she was half-minded to\r\nspeak openly to the Duke, to tell him all that Silverbridge had said\r\nto her and all that he had not said, and to ask the father\'s help in\r\nscheming against that rival. But she could not find the words with\r\nwhich to begin. And then, might he not despise her, and, despising\r\nher, reject her, were she to declare her desire to marry a man who\r\nhad given his heart to another woman? And so, when the Duke asked her\r\nto remain after the departure of the other guests, she decided that\r\nit would be best to bide her time. The Duke, as she assented, kissed\r\nher hand, and she knew that this sign of grace was given to his\r\nintended daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\nIn all this she half-confided her thoughts and her prospects to her\r\nold friend, Miss Cassewary. "That girl has gone at last," she said to\r\nMiss Cass.\r\n\r\n"I fear she has left her spells behind her, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Of course she has. The venom out of the snake\'s tooth will poison\r\nall the blood; but still the poor bitten wretch does not always die."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she is a snake."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be moral, Cass. She is a snake in my sense. She has got her\r\nweapons, and of course it is natural enough that she should use them.\r\nIf I want to be Duchess of Omnium, why shouldn\'t she?"\r\n\r\n"I hate to hear you talk of yourself in that way."\r\n\r\n"Because you have enough of the old school about you to like\r\nconventional falsehood. This young man did in fact ask me to be his\r\nwife. Of course I meant to accept him,--but I didn\'t. Then comes this\r\nconvict\'s granddaughter."\r\n\r\n"Not a convict\'s!"\r\n\r\n"You know what I mean. Had he been a convict it would have been all\r\nthe same. I take upon myself to say that, had the world been informed\r\nthat an alliance had been arranged between the eldest son of the Duke\r\nof Omnium and the daughter of Earl Grex,--the world would have been\r\nsatisfied. Every unmarried daughter of every peer in England would\r\nhave envied me,--but it would have been comme il faut."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, my dear."\r\n\r\n"But what would be the feeling as to the convict\'s granddaughter?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t suppose that I would approve it;--but it seems to me that\r\nin these days young men do just what they please."\r\n\r\n"He shall do what he pleases, but he must be made to be pleased with\r\nme." So much she said to Miss Cassewary; but she did not divulge\r\nany plan. The Boncassens had just gone off to the station, and\r\nSilverbridge was out shooting. If anything could be done here at\r\nMatching, it must be done quickly, as Silverbridge would soon take\r\nhis departure. She did not know it, but, in truth, he was remaining\r\nin order that he might, as he said, "have all this out with the\r\ngovernor."\r\n\r\nShe tried to realise for herself some plan, but when the evening came\r\nnothing was fixed. For a quarter of an hour, just as the sun was\r\nsetting, the Duke joined her in the gardens,--and spoke to her more\r\nplainly than he had ever spoken before. "Has Silverbridge come home?"\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n"I have not seen him."\r\n\r\n"I hope you and Mary get on well together."\r\n\r\n"I think so, Duke. I am sure we should if we saw more of each other."\r\n\r\n"I sincerely hope you may. There is nothing I wish for Mary so much\r\nas that she should have a sister. And there is no one whom I would be\r\nso glad to hear her call by that name as yourself." How could he have\r\nspoken plainer?\r\n\r\nThe ladies were all together in the drawing-room when Silverbridge\r\ncame bursting in rather late. "Where\'s the governor?" he asked,\r\nturning to his sister.\r\n\r\n"Dressing, I should think; but what is the matter?"\r\n\r\n"I want to see him. I must be off to Cornwall to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"To Cornwall!" said Miss Cassewary. "Why to Cornwall?" asked Lady\r\nMabel. But Mary, connecting Cornwall with Frank Tregear, held her\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t explain it all now, but I must start very early to-morrow."\r\nThen he went off to his father\'s study, and finding the Duke still\r\nthere explained the cause of his intended journey. The member for\r\nPolpenno had died, and Frank Tregear had been invited to stand for\r\nthe borough. He had written to his friend to ask him to come and\r\nassist in the struggle. "Years ago there used to be always a Tregear\r\nin for Polpenno," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"But he is a younger son."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about it," said Silverbridge, "but as he\r\nhas asked me to go I think I ought to do it." The Duke, who was by\r\nno means the man to make light of the political obligations of\r\nfriendship, raised no objection.\r\n\r\n"I wish," said he, "that something could have been arranged between\r\nyou and Mabel before you went." The young man stood in the gloom\r\nof the dark room aghast. This was certainly not the moment for\r\nexplaining everything to his father. "I have set my heart very much\r\nupon it, and you ought to be gratified by knowing that I quite\r\napprove your choice."\r\n\r\nAll that had been years ago,--in last June;--before Mrs. Montacute\r\nJones\'s garden-party, before that day in the rain at Maidenhead,\r\nbefore the brightness of Killancodlem, before the glories of Miss\r\nBoncassen had been revealed to him. "There is no time for that kind\r\nof thing now," he said weakly.\r\n\r\n"I thought that when you were here together--"\r\n\r\n"I must dress now, sir; but I will tell you all about it when I get\r\nback from Cornwall. I will come back direct to Matching, and will\r\nexplain everything." So he escaped.\r\n\r\nIt was clear to Lady Mabel that there was no opportunity now for any\r\nscheme. Whatever might be possible must be postponed till after this\r\nCornish business had been completed. Perhaps it might be better so.\r\nShe had thought that she would appeal to himself, that she would tell\r\nhim of his father\'s wishes, of her love for him,--of the authority\r\nwhich he had once given her for loving him,--and of the absolute\r\nimpossibility of his marriage with the American. She thought that she\r\ncould do it, if not efficiently at any rate effectively. But it could\r\nnot be done on the very day on which the American had gone.\r\n\r\nIt came out in the course of the evening that he was going to assist\r\nFrank Tregear in his canvass. The matter was not spoken of openly, as\r\nTregear\'s name could hardly be mentioned. But everybody knew it, and\r\nit gave occasion to Mabel for a few words apart with Silverbridge. "I\r\nam so glad you are going to him," she said in a little whisper.\r\n\r\n"Of course I go when he wishes me. I don\'t know that I can do him any\r\ngood."\r\n\r\n"The greatest good in the world. Your name will go so far! It will be\r\neverything to him to be in Parliament. And when are we to meet\r\nagain?" she said.\r\n\r\n"I shall turn up somewhere," he replied as he gave her his hand to\r\nwish her good-bye.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the Duke proposed to Lady Mabel that she\r\nshould stay at Matching for yet another fortnight,--or even for a\r\nmonth if it might be possible. Lady Mabel, whose father was still\r\nabroad, was not sorry to accept the invitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\nPolpenno\r\n\r\n\r\nPolwenning, the seat of Mr. Tregear, Frank\'s father, was close to the\r\nborough of Polpenno,--so close that the gates of the grounds opened\r\ninto the town. As Silverbridge had told his father, many of the\r\nTregear family had sat for the borough. Then there had come changes,\r\nand strangers had made themselves welcome by their money. When the\r\nvacancy now occurred a deputation waited upon Squire Tregear and\r\nasked him to stand. The deputation would guarantee that the expense\r\nshould not exceed--a certain limited sum. Mr. Tregear for himself\r\nhad no such ambition. His eldest son was abroad and was not at all\r\nsuch a man as one would choose to make into a Member of Parliament.\r\nAfter much consideration in the family, Frank was invited to present\r\nhimself to the constituency. Frank\'s aspirations in regard to Lady\r\nMary Palliser were known at Polwenning, and it was thought that they\r\nwould have a better chance of success if he could write the letters\r\nM.P. after his name. Frank acceded, and as he was starting wrote\r\nto ask the assistance of his friend Lord Silverbridge. At that\r\ntime there were only nine days more before the election, and Mr.\r\nCarbottle, the Liberal candidate, was already living in great style\r\nat the Camborne Arms.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Tregear and an elder sister of Frank\'s, who quite\r\nacknowledged herself to be an old maid, were very glad to welcome\r\nFrank\'s friend. On the first morning of course they discussed the\r\ncandidates\' prospects. "My best chance of success," said Frank,\r\n"arises from the fact that Mr. Carbottle is fatter than the people\r\nhere seem to approve."\r\n\r\n"If his purse be fat," said old Mr. Tregear, "that will carry off any\r\npersonal defect." Lord Silverbridge asked whether the candidate was\r\nnot too fat to make speeches. Miss Tregear declared that he had made\r\nthree speeches daily for the last week, and that Mr. Williams the\r\nrector, who had heard him, declared him to be a godless dissenter.\r\nMrs. Tregear thought that it would be much better that the place\r\nshould be disfranchised altogether than that such a horrid man should\r\nbe brought into the neighbourhood. "A godless dissenter!" she said,\r\nholding up her hands in dismay. Frank thought that they had better\r\nabstain from allusion to their opponent\'s religion. Then Mr. Tregear\r\nmade a little speech. "We used," he said, "to endeavour to get\r\nsomeone to represent us in Parliament, who would agree with us on\r\nvital subjects, such as the Church of England and the necessity of\r\nreligion. Now it seems to be considered ill-mannered to make any\r\nallusion to such subjects!" From which it may be seen that this old\r\nTregear was very conservative indeed.\r\n\r\nWhen the old people were gone to bed the two young men discussed the\r\nmatter. "I hope you\'ll get in," said Silverbridge. "And if I can do\r\nanything for you of course I will."\r\n\r\n"It is always good to have a real member along with one," said\r\nTregear.\r\n\r\n"But I begin to think I am a very shaky Conservative myself."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for that."\r\n\r\n"Sir Timothy is such a beast," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Is that your notion of a political opinion? Are you to be this\r\nor that in accordance with your own liking or disliking for some\r\nparticular man? One is supposed to have opinions of one\'s own."\r\n\r\n"Your father would be down on a man because he is a dissenter."\r\n\r\n"Of course my father is old-fashioned."\r\n\r\n"It does seem so hard to me," said Silverbridge, "to find any\r\ndifference between the two sets. You who are a true Conservative are\r\nmuch more like to my father, who is a Liberal, than to your own, who\r\nis on the same side as yourself."\r\n\r\n"It may be so, and still I may be a good Conservative."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me in the House to mean nothing more than choosing one\r\nset of companions or choosing another. There are some awful cads who\r\nsit along with Mr. Monk;--fellows that make you sick to hear them,\r\nand whom I couldn\'t be civil to. But I don\'t think there is anybody I\r\nhate so much as old Beeswax. He has a contemptuous way with his nose\r\nwhich makes me long to pull it."\r\n\r\n"And you mean to go over in order that you may be justified in doing\r\nso. I think I soar a little higher," said Tregear.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course. You\'re a clever fellow," said Silverbridge, not\r\nwithout a touch of sarcasm.\r\n\r\n"A man may soar higher than that without being very clever. If the\r\nparty that calls itself Liberal were to have all its own way who is\r\nthere that doesn\'t believe that the church would go at once, then\r\nall distinction between boroughs, the House of Lords immediately\r\nafterwards, and after that the Crown?"\r\n\r\n"Those are not my governor\'s ideas."\r\n\r\n"Your governor couldn\'t help himself. A Liberal party, with\r\nplenipotentiary power, must go on right away to the logical\r\nconclusion of its arguments. It is only the conservative feeling of\r\nthe country which saves such men as your father from being carried\r\nheadlong to ruin by their own machinery. You have read Carlyle\'s\r\nFrench Revolution."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have read that."\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t it so there? There were a lot of honest men who thought\r\nthey could do a deal of good by making everybody equal. A good many\r\nwere made equal by having their heads cut off. That\'s why I mean\r\nto be member for Polpenno and to send Mr. Carbottle back to London.\r\nCarbottle probably doesn\'t want to cut anybody\'s head off."\r\n\r\n"I dare say he\'s as conservative as anybody."\r\n\r\n"But he wants to be a member of Parliament; and, as he hasn\'t thought\r\nmuch about anything, he is quite willing to lend a hand to communism,\r\nradicalism, socialism, chopping people\'s heads off, or anything\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well," said Silverbridge, "but where should we have\r\nbeen if there had been no Liberals? Robespierre and his pals cut off\r\na lot of heads, but Louis XIV and Louis XV locked up more in prison."\r\nAnd so he had the last word in the argument.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the next morning was spent in canvassing, and the whole\r\nof the afternoon. In the evening there was a great meeting at the\r\nPolwenning Assembly Room, which at the present moment was in the\r\nhands of the Conservative party. Here Frank Tregear made an oration,\r\nin which he declared his political convictions. The whole speech was\r\nsaid at the time to be very good; but the portion of it which was\r\napparently esteemed the most, had direct reference to Mr. Carbottle.\r\nWho was Mr. Carbottle? Why had he come to Polpenno? Who had sent for\r\nhim? Why Mr. Carbottle rather than anybody else? Did not the people\r\nof Polpenno think that it might be as well to send Mr. Carbottle back\r\nto the place from whence he had come? These questions, which seemed\r\nto Silverbridge to be as easy as they were attractive, almost made\r\nhim desirous of making a speech himself.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Williams, the rector, followed, a gentleman who had many\r\nstaunch friends and many bitter enemies in the town. He addressed\r\nhimself chiefly to that bane of the whole country,--as he conceived\r\nthem,--the godless dissenters; and was felt by Tregear to be injuring\r\nthe cause by every word he spoke. It was necessary that Mr. Williams\r\nshould liberate his own mind, and therefore he persevered with the\r\ngodless dissenters at great length,--not explaining, however, how a\r\nman who thought enough about his religion to be a dissenter could be\r\ngodless, or how a godless man should care enough about religion to be\r\na dissenter.\r\n\r\nMr. Williams was heard with impatience, and then there was a clamour\r\nfor the young lord. He was the son of an ex-Prime Minister, and\r\ntherefore of course he could speak. He was himself a member of\r\nParliament, and therefore could speak. He had boldly severed himself\r\nfrom the faulty political tenets of his family, and therefore on such\r\nan occasion as this was peculiarly entitled to speak. When a man\r\ngoes electioneering, he must speak. At a dinner-table to refuse\r\nis possible:--or in any assembly convened for a semi-private\r\npurpose, a gentleman may declare that he is not prepared for the\r\noccasion. But in such an emergency as this, a man,--and a member of\r\nParliament,--cannot plead that he is not prepared. A son of a former\r\nPrime Minister who had already taken so strong a part in politics\r\nas to have severed himself from his father, not prepared to address\r\nthe voters of a borough whom he had come to canvass! The plea was so\r\nabsurd, that he was thrust on to his feet before he knew what he was\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nIt was in truth his first public speech. At Silverbridge he had\r\nattempted to repeat a few words, and in his failure had been covered\r\nby the Sprugeons and the Sprouts. But now he was on his legs in a\r\ngreat room, in an unknown town, with all the aristocracy of the place\r\nbefore him! His eyes at first swam a little, and there was a moment\r\nin which he thought he would run away. But, on that morning, as he\r\nwas dressing, there had come to his mind the idea of the possibility\r\nof such a moment as this, and a few words had occurred to him. "My\r\nfriend Frank Tregear," he began, rushing at once at his subject, "is\r\na very good fellow, and I hope you\'ll elect him." Then he paused, not\r\nremembering what was to come next; but the sentiment which he had\r\nuttered appeared to his auditors to be so good in itself and so\r\nwell-delivered, that they filled up a long pause with continued\r\nclappings and exclamations. "Yes," continued the young member of\r\nParliament, encouraged by the kindness of the crowd, "I have known\r\nFrank Tregear ever so long, and I don\'t think you could find a better\r\nmember of Parliament anywhere." There were many ladies present and\r\nthey thought that the Duke\'s son was just the person who ought to\r\ncome electioneering among them. His voice was much pleasanter to\r\ntheir ears than that of old Mr. Williams. The women waved their\r\nhandkerchiefs and the men stamped their feet. Here was an orator\r\ncome among them! "You all know all about it just as well as I do,"\r\ncontinued the orator, "and I am sure you feel that he ought to be\r\nmember for Polpenno." There could be no doubt about that as far as\r\nthe opinion of the audience went. "There can\'t be a better fellow\r\nthan Frank Tregear, and I ask you all to give three cheers for the\r\nnew member." Ten times three cheers were given, and the Carbottleites\r\noutside the door who had come to report what was going on at the\r\nTregear meeting were quite of opinion that this eldest son of the\r\nformer Prime Minister was a tower of strength. "I don\'t know anything\r\nabout Mr. Carbottle," continued Silverbridge, who was almost growing\r\nto like the sound of his own voice. "Perhaps he\'s a good fellow too."\r\n"No; no, no. A very bad fellow indeed," was heard from different\r\nparts of the room. "I don\'t know anything about him. I wasn\'t at\r\nschool with Carbottle." This was taken as a stroke of the keenest\r\nwit, and was received with infinite cheering. Silverbridge was in the\r\npride of his youth, and Carbottle was sixty at the least. Nothing\r\ncould have been funnier. "He seems to be a stout old party, but I\r\ndon\'t think he\'s the man for Polpenno. I think you\'ll return Frank\r\nTregear. I was at school with him;--and I tell you, that you can\'t\r\nfind a better fellow anywhere than Frank Tregear." Then he sat down,\r\nand I am afraid he felt that he had made the speech of the evening.\r\n"We are so much obliged to you, Lord Silverbridge," Miss Tregear said\r\nas they were walking home together. "That\'s just the sort of thing\r\nthat the people like. So reassuring, you know. What Mr. Williams says\r\nabout the dissenters is of course true; but it isn\'t reassuring."\r\n\r\n"I hope I didn\'t make a fool of myself to-night," Silverbridge said\r\nwhen he was alone with Tregear,--probably with some little pride in\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n"I ought to say that you did, seeing that you praised me so\r\nviolently. But, whatever it was, it was well taken. I don\'t know\r\nwhether they will elect me; but had you come down as a candidate, I\r\nam quite sure they would have elected you." Silverbridge was hardly\r\nsatisfied with this. He wished to have been told that he had spoken\r\nwell. He did not, however, resent his friend\'s coldness. "Perhaps,\r\nafter all, I did make a fool of myself," he said to himself as he\r\nwent to bed.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, after breakfast, it was found to be raining heavily.\r\nCanvassing was of course the business of the hour, and canvassing is\r\na business which cannot be done indoors. It was soon decided that the\r\nrain should go for nothing. Could an agreement have been come to with\r\nthe Carbottleites it might have been decided that both parties should\r\nabstain, but as that was impossible the Tregear party could not\r\nafford to lose the day. As Mr. Carbottle, by reason of his fatness\r\nand natural slowness, would perhaps be specially averse to walking\r\nabout in the slush and mud, it might be that they would gain\r\nsomething; so after breakfast they started with umbrellas,--Tregear,\r\nSilverbridge, Mr. Newcomb the curate, Mr. Pinebott the conservative\r\nattorney, with four or five followers who were armed with books and\r\npencils, and who ticked off on the list of the voters the names of\r\nthe friendly, the doubtful, and the inimical.\r\n\r\nParliamentary canvassing is not a pleasant occupation. Perhaps\r\nnothing more disagreeable, more squalid, more revolting to the\r\nsenses, more opposed to personal dignity, can be conceived. The\r\nsame words have to be repeated over and over again in the cottages,\r\nhovels, and lodgings of poor men and women who only understand that\r\nthe time has come round in which they are to be flattered instead of\r\nbeing the flatterers. "I think I am right in supposing that your\r\nhusband\'s principles are Conservative, Mrs. Bubbs." "I don\'t know\r\nnothing about it. You\'d better call again and see Bubbs hissel."\r\n"Certainly I will do so. I shouldn\'t at all like to leave the borough\r\nwithout seeing Mr. Bubbs. I hope we shall have your influence, Mrs.\r\nBubbs." "I don\'t know nothing about it. My folk at home allays vote\r\nbuff; and I think Bubbs ought to go buff too. Only mind this; Bubbs\r\ndon\'t never come home to his dinner. You must come arter six, and I\r\nhope he\'s to have some\'at for his trouble. He won\'t have my word to\r\nvote unless he have some\'at." Such is the conversation in which the\r\ncandidate takes a part, while his cortege at the door is criticising\r\nhis very imperfect mode of securing Mrs. Bubbs\' good wishes. Then he\r\ngoes on to the next house, and the same thing with some variation is\r\nendured again. Some guide, philosopher, and friend, who accompanies\r\nhim, and who is the chief of the cortege, has calculated on his\r\nbehalf that he ought to make twenty such visitations an hour, and to\r\ncall on two hundred constituents in the course of the day. As he is\r\nalways falling behind in his number, he is always being driven on by\r\nhis philosopher, till he comes to hate the poor creatures to whom he\r\nis forced to address himself, with a most cordial hatred.\r\n\r\nIt is a nuisance to which no man should subject himself in any\r\nweather. But when it rains there is superadded a squalor and an ill\r\nhumour to all the party which makes it almost impossible for them not\r\nto quarrel before the day is over. To talk politics to Mrs. Bubbs\r\nunder any circumstances is bad, but to do so with the conviction that\r\nthe moisture is penetrating from your greatcoat through your shirt to\r\nyour bones, and that while so employed you are breathing the steam\r\nfrom those seven other wet men at the door, is abominable. To have\r\nto go through this is enough to take away all the pride which a man\r\nmight otherwise take from becoming a member of Parliament. But to\r\ngo through it and then not to become a member is base indeed! To\r\ngo through it and to feel that you are probably paying at the rate\r\nof a hundred pounds a day for the privilege is most disheartening.\r\nSilverbridge, as he backed up Tregear in the uncomfortable work,\r\ncongratulated himself on the comfort of having a Mr. Sprugeon and a\r\nMr. Sprout who could manage his borough for him without a contest.\r\n\r\nThey worked on that day all the morning till one, when they took\r\nluncheon, all reeking with wet, at the King\'s Head,--so that a little\r\nmoney might be legitimately spent in the cause. Then, at two, they\r\nsallied out again, vainly endeavouring to make their twenty calls\r\nwithin the hour. About four, when it was beginning to be dusk, they\r\nwere very tired, and Silverbridge had ventured to suggest that as\r\nthey were all wet through, and as there was to be another meeting in\r\nthe Assembly Room that night, and as nobody in that part of the town\r\nseemed to be at home, they might perhaps be allowed to adjourn for\r\nthe present. He was thinking how nice it would be to have a glass\r\nof hot brandy-and-water and then lounge till dinner-time. But the\r\nphilosophers received the proposition with stern disdain. Was his\r\nLordship aware that Mr. Carbottle had been out all day from eight\r\nin the morning, and was still at work; that the Carbottleites had\r\nalready sent for lanterns and were determined to go on till eight\r\no\'clock among the artisans who would then have returned from their\r\nwork? When a man had put his hand to the plough, the philosophers\r\nthought that that man should complete the furrow!\r\n\r\nThe philosophers\' view had just carried the day, the discussion\r\nhaving been held under seven or eight wet umbrellas at the corner\r\nof a dirty little lane leading into the High Street; when suddenly,\r\non the other side of the way, Mr. Carbottle\'s cortege made its\r\nappearance. The philosophers at once informed them that on such\r\noccasions it was customary that the rival candidates should be\r\nintroduced. "It will take ten minutes," said the philosophers; "but\r\nthen it will take them ten minutes too." Upon this Tregear, as being\r\nthe younger of the two, crossed over the road, and the introduction\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nThere was something comfortable in it to the Tregear party, as no\r\nimagination could conceive anything more wretched than the appearance\r\nof Mr. Carbottle. He was a very stout man of sixty, and seemed to be\r\nalmost carried along by his companions. He had pulled his coat-collar\r\nup and his hat down till very little of his face was visible, and in\r\nattempting to look at Tregear and Silverbridge he had to lift up his\r\nchin till the rain ran off his hat on to his nose. He had an umbrella\r\nin one hand and a stick in the other, and was wet through to his very\r\nskin. What were his own feelings cannot be told, but his\r\nphilosophers, guides, and friends would allow him no rest. "Very hard\r\nwork, Mr. Tregear," he said, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n"Very hard indeed, Mr. Carbottle." Then the two parties went on, each\r\ntheir own way, without another word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\nThe News Is Sent to Matching\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were nine days of this work, during which Lord Silverbridge\r\nbecame very popular and made many speeches. Tregear did not win half\r\nso many hearts, or recommend himself so thoroughly to the political\r\npredilections of the borough;--but nevertheless he was returned. It\r\nwould probably be unjust to attribute this success chiefly to the\r\nyoung Lord\'s eloquence. It certainly was not due to the strong\r\nreligious feelings of the rector. It is to be feared that even the\r\nthoughtful political convictions of the candidate did not altogether\r\nproduce the result. It was that chief man among the candidate\'s\r\nguides and friends, that leading philosopher who would not allow\r\nanybody to go home from the rain, and who kept his eyes so sharply\r\nopen to the pecuniary doings of the Carbottleites, that Mr.\r\nCarbottle\'s guides and friends had hardly dared to spend a\r\nshilling;--it was he who had in truth been efficacious. In every\r\nattempt they had made to spend their money they had been looked into\r\nand circumvented. As Mr. Carbottle had been brought down to Polpenno\r\non purpose that he might spend money,--as he had nothing but his\r\nmoney to recommend him, and as he had not spent it,--the free and\r\nindependent electors of the borough had not seen their way to\r\nvote for him. Therefore the Conservatives were very elate with\r\ntheir triumph. There was a great Conservative reaction. But the\r\nelectioneering guide, philosopher, and friend, in the humble\r\nretirement of his own home,--he was a tailor in the town, whose\r\nassistance at such periods had long been in requisition,--he knew\r\nvery well how the seat had been secured. Ten shillings a head would\r\nhave sent three hundred true Liberals to the ballot-boxes! The mode\r\nof distributing the money had been arranged; but the Conservative\r\ntailor had been too acute, and not half-a-sovereign could be passed.\r\nThe tailor got twenty-five pounds for his work, and that was smuggled\r\nin among the bills for printing.\r\n\r\nMr. Williams, however, was sure that he had so opened out the\r\niniquities of the dissenters as to have convinced the borough. Yes;\r\nevery Salem and Zion and Ebenezer in his large parish would be\r\nclosed. "It is a great thing for the country," said Mr. Williams.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll make a capital member," said Silverbridge, clapping his friend\r\non the back.\r\n\r\n"I hope he\'ll never forget," said Mr. Williams, "that he owes his\r\nseat to the Protestant and Church-of-England principles which have\r\nsunk so deeply into the minds of the thoughtful portion of the\r\ninhabitants of this borough."\r\n\r\n"Whom should they elect but a Tregear?" said the mother, feeling that\r\nher rector took too much of the praise to himself.\r\n\r\n"I think you have done more for us than any one else," whispered\r\nMiss Tregear to the young Lord. "What you said was so reassuring!"\r\nThe father before he went to bed expressed to his son, with some\r\ntrepidation, a hope that all this would lead to no great permanent\r\nincrease of expenditure.\r\n\r\nThat evening before he went to bed Lord Silverbridge wrote to his\r\nfather an account of what had taken place at Polpenno.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Polwenning, 15th December.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR FATHER,\r\n\r\n   Among us all we have managed to return Tregear. I am\r\n   afraid you will not be quite pleased because it will be a\r\n   vote lost to your party. But I really think that he is\r\n   just the fellow to be in Parliament. If he were on your\r\n   side I\'m sure he\'s the kind of man you\'d like to bring\r\n   into office. He is always thinking about those sort of\r\n   things. He says that, if there were no Conservatives, such\r\n   Liberals as you and Mr. Monk would be destroyed by the\r\n   Jacobins. There is something in that. Whether a man is a\r\n   Conservative or not himself, I suppose there ought to be\r\n   Conservatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke as he read this made a memorandum in his own mind that he\r\nwould explain to his son that every carriage should have a drag\r\nto its wheels, but that an ambitious soul would choose to be the\r\ncoachman rather than the drag.\r\n\r\n\r\n   It was beastly work!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke made another memorandum to instruct his son that no\r\ngentleman above the age of a schoolboy should allow himself to use\r\nsuch a word in such a sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n   We had to go about in the rain up to our knees in mud for\r\n   eight or nine days, always saying the same thing. And of\r\n   course all that we said was bosh.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother memorandum--or rather two, one as to the slang, and another\r\nas to the expediency of teaching something to the poor voters on such\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Our only comfort was that the Carbottle people were quite\r\n   as badly off as us.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother memorandum as to the grammar. The absence of Christian\r\ncharity did not at the moment affect the Duke.\r\n\r\n\r\n   I made ever so many speeches, till at last it seemed to be\r\n   quite easy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere there was a very grave memorandum. Speeches easy to young\r\nspeakers are generally very difficult to old listeners.\r\n\r\n\r\n   But of course it was all bosh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis required no separate memorandum.\r\n\r\n\r\n   I have promised to go up to town with Tregear for a day\r\n   or two. After that I will stick to my purpose of going to\r\n   Matching again. I will be there about the 22nd, and will\r\n   then stay over Christmas. After that I am going into the\r\n   Brake country for some hunting. It is such a shame to have\r\n   a lot of horses and never to ride them!\r\n\r\n   Your most affectionate Son,\r\n\r\n   SILVERBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last sentence gave rise in the Duke\'s mind to the necessity of a\r\nvery elaborate memorandum on the subject of amusements generally.\r\n\r\nBy the same post another letter went from Polpenno to Matching which\r\nalso gave rise to some mental memoranda. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MABEL,\r\n\r\n   I am a Member of the British House of Commons! I have\r\n   sometimes regarded myself as being one of the most\r\n   peculiarly unfortunate men in the world, and yet now I\r\n   have achieved that which all commoners in England think to\r\n   be the greatest honour within their reach, and have done\r\n   so at an age at which very few achieve it but the sons of\r\n   the wealthy and the powerful.\r\n\r\n   I now come to my misfortunes. I know that as a poor man\r\n   I ought not to be a member of Parliament. I ought to\r\n   be earning my bread as a lawyer or a doctor. I have no\r\n   business to be what I am, and when I am forty I shall find\r\n   that I have eaten up all my good things instead of having\r\n   them to eat.\r\n\r\n   I have one chance before me. You know very well what that\r\n   is. Tell her that my pride in being a member of Parliament\r\n   is much more on her behalf than on my own. The man who\r\n   dares to love her ought at any rate to be something in the\r\n   world. If it might be,--if ever it may be,--I should wish\r\n   to be something for her sake. I am sure you will be glad\r\n   of my success yourself, for my own sake.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate Friend and Cousin,\r\n\r\n   FRANCIS TREGEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first mental memorandum in regard to this came from the writer\'s\r\nassertion that he at forty would have eaten up all his good things.\r\nNo! He being a man might make his way to good things though he was\r\nnot born to them. He surely would win his good things for himself.\r\nBut what good things were in store for her? What chance of success\r\nwas there for her? But the reflection which was the most bitter to\r\nher of all came from her assurance that his love for that other\r\ngirl was so genuine. Even when he was writing to her there was no\r\nspark left of the old romance! Some hint of a recollection of past\r\nfeelings, some half-concealed reference to the former passion might\r\nhave been allowed to him! She as a woman,--as a woman all whose\r\nfortune must depend on marriage,--could indulge in no such allusions;\r\nbut surely he need not have been so hard!\r\n\r\nBut still there was another memorandum. At the present moment she\r\nwould do all that he desired as far as it was in her power. She was\r\nanxious that he should marry Lady Mary Palliser, though so anxious\r\nalso that something of his love should remain with herself! She was\r\nquite willing to convey that message,--if it might be done without\r\noffence to the Duke. She was there with the object of ingratiating\r\nherself with the Duke. She must not impede her favour with the Duke\r\nby making herself the medium of any secret communications between\r\nMary and her lover.\r\n\r\nBut how should she serve Tregear without risk of offending the Duke?\r\nShe read the letter again and again, and thinking it to be a good\r\nletter she determined to show it to the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Tregear has got in at Polpenno," she said on the day on which\r\nshe and the Duke had received their letters.\r\n\r\n"So I hear from Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"It will be a good thing for him, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I do not know," said the Duke coldly.\r\n\r\n"He is my cousin, and I have always been interested in his welfare."\r\n\r\n"That is natural."\r\n\r\n"And a seat in Parliament will give him something to do."\r\n\r\n"Certainly it ought," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"I do not think that he is an idle man." To this the Duke made no\r\nanswer. He did not wish to be made to talk about Tregear. "May I\r\ntell you why I say all this?" she asked softly, pressing her hand on\r\nthe Duke\'s arm ever so gently. To this the Duke assented, but still\r\ncoldly. "Because I want to know what I ought to do. Would you mind\r\nreading that letter? Of course you will remember that Frank and I\r\nhave been brought up almost as brother and sister."\r\n\r\nThe Duke took the letter in his hand and did read it, very slowly.\r\n"What he says about young men without means going into Parliament\r\nis true enough." This was not encouraging, but as the Duke went on\r\nreading, Mabel did not think it necessary to argue the matter. He had\r\nto read the last paragraph twice before he understood it. He did read\r\nit twice, and then folding the letter very slowly gave it back to his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n"What ought I to do?" asked Lady Mabel.\r\n\r\n"As you and I, my dear, are friends, I think that any carrying of a\r\nmessage to Mary would be breaking confidence. I think that you should\r\nnot speak to Mary about Mr. Tregear." Then he changed the subject.\r\nLady Mabel of course understood that after that she could not say a\r\nword to Mary about the election at Polpenno.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\nThe Meeting at "The Bobtailed Fox"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now the middle of December, and matters were not comfortable\r\nin the Runnymede country. The Major with much pluck had carried on\r\nhis operations in opposition to the wishes of the resident members of\r\nthe hunt. The owners of coverts had protested, and farmers had sworn\r\nthat he should not ride over their lands. There had even been some\r\ntalk among the younger men of thrashing him if he persevered. But he\r\ndid persevere, and had managed to have one or two good runs. Now it\r\nwas the fortune of the Runnymede hunt that many of those who rode\r\nwith the hounds were strangers to the country,--men who came down by\r\ntrain from London, gentlemen of perhaps no great distinction, who\r\ncould ride hard, but as to whom it was thought that as they did not\r\nprovide the land to ride over, or the fences to be destroyed, or the\r\ncoverts for the foxes, or the greater part of the subscription, they\r\nought not to oppose those by whom all these things were supplied. But\r\nthe Major, knowing where his strength lay, had managed to get a party\r\nto support him. The contract to hunt the country had been made with\r\nhim in last March, and was good for one year. Having the kennels and\r\nthe hounds under his command he did hunt the country; but he did so\r\namidst a storm of contumely and ill will.\r\n\r\nAt last it was decided that a general meeting of the members of the\r\nhunt should be called together with the express object of getting rid\r\nof the Major. The gentlemen of the neighbourhood felt that the Major\r\nwas not to be borne, and the farmers were very much stronger against\r\nhim than the gentlemen. It had now become a settled belief among\r\nsporting men in England that the Major had with his own hands driven\r\nthe nail into the horse\'s foot. Was it to be endured that the\r\nRunnymede farmers should ride to hounds under a Master who had been\r\nguilty of such an iniquity as that? "The Staines and Egham Gazette,"\r\nwhich had always supported the Runnymede hunt, declared in very plain\r\nterms that all who rode with the Major were enjoying their sport out\r\nof the plunder which had been extracted from Lord Silverbridge. Then\r\na meeting was called for Saturday, the 18th December, to be held at\r\nthat well-known sporting little inn The Bobtailed Fox. The members of\r\nthe hunt were earnestly called upon to attend. It was,--so said the\r\nprinted document which was issued,--the only means by which the hunt\r\ncould be preserved. If gentlemen who were interested did not put\r\ntheir shoulders to the wheel, the Runnymede hunt must be regarded\r\nas a thing of the past. One of the documents was sent to the Major\r\nwith an intimation that if he wished to attend no objection would be\r\nmade to his presence. The chair would be taken at half-past twelve\r\npunctually by that popular and well-known old sportsman Mr. Mahogany\r\nTopps.\r\n\r\nWas ever the Master of a hunt treated in such a way! His presence not\r\nobjected to! As a rule the Master of a hunt does not attend hunt\r\nmeetings, because the matter to be discussed is generally that of the\r\nmoney to be subscribed for him, as to which it is as well he should\r\nnot hear the pros and cons. But it is presumed that he is to be the\r\nhero of the hour, and that he is to be treated to his face, and\r\nspoken of behind his back, with love, admiration, and respect. But\r\nnow this Master was told his presence would be allowed! And then\r\nthis fox-hunting meeting was summoned for half-past twelve on a\r\nhunting-day;--when, as all the world knew, the hounds were to meet at\r\neleven, twelve miles off! Was ever anything so base? said the Major\r\nto himself. But he resolved that he would be equal to the occasion.\r\nHe immediately issued cards to all the members, stating that on that\r\nday the meet had been changed from Croppingham Bushes, which was ever\r\nso much on the other side of Bagshot, to The Bobtailed Fox,--for the\r\nbenefit of the hunt at large, said the card,--and that the hounds\r\nwould be there at half-past one.\r\n\r\nWhatever might happen, he must show a spirit. In all this there were\r\none or two of the London brigade who stood fast to him. "Cock your\r\ntail, Tifto," said one hard-riding supporter, "and show \'em you\r\naren\'t afraid of nothing." So Tifto cocked his tail and went to the\r\nmeeting in his best new scarlet coat, with his whitest breeches, his\r\npinkest boots, and his neatest little bows at his knees. He entered\r\nthe room with his horn in his hand, as a symbol of authority, and\r\ntook off his hunting-cap to salute the assembly with a jaunty air. He\r\nhad taken two glasses of cherry brandy, and as long as the stimulant\r\nlasted would no doubt be able to support himself with audacity.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Topps, in rising from his chair, did not say very much. He\r\nhad been hunting in the Runnymede country for nearly fifty years, and\r\nhad never seen anything so sad as this before. It made him, he knew,\r\nvery unhappy. As for foxes, there were always plenty of foxes in his\r\ncoverts. His friend Mr. Jawstock, on the right, would explain what\r\nall this was about. All he wanted was to see the Runnymede hunt\r\nproperly kept up. Then he sat down, and Mr. Jawstock rose to his\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nMr. Jawstock was a gentleman well known in the Runnymede country,\r\nwho had himself been instrumental in bringing Major Tifto into these\r\nparts. There is often someone in a hunting country who never becomes\r\na Master of hounds himself, but who has almost as much to say about\r\nthe business as the Master himself. Sometimes at hunt meetings he is\r\nrather unpopular, as he is always inclined to talk. But there are\r\noccasions on which his services are felt to be valuable,--as were Mr.\r\nJawstock\'s at present. He was about forty-five years of age, was not\r\nmuch given to riding, owned no coverts himself, and was not a man of\r\nwealth; but he understood the nature of hunting, knew all its laws,\r\nand was a judge of horses, of hounds,--and of men; and could say a\r\nthing when he had to say it.\r\n\r\nMr. Jawstock sat on the right hand of Mr. Topps, and a place was left\r\nfor the Master opposite. The task to be performed was neither easy\r\nnor pleasant. It was necessary that the orator should accuse the\r\ngentleman opposite to him,--a man with whom he himself had been very\r\nintimate,--of iniquity so gross and so mean, that nothing worse can\r\nbe conceived. "You are a swindler, a cheat, a rascal of the very\r\ndeepest dye;--a rogue so mean that it is revolting to be in the same\r\nroom with you!" That was what Mr. Jawstock had to say. And he said\r\nit. Looking round the room, occasionally appealing to Mr. Topps,\r\nwho on these occasions would lift up his hands in horror, but never\r\nletting his eye fall for a moment on the Major, Mr. Jawstock told his\r\nstory. "I did not see it done," said he. "I know nothing about it. I\r\nnever was at Doncaster in my life. But you have evidence of what the\r\nJockey Club thinks. The Master of our Hunt has been banished from\r\nracecourses." Here there was considerable opposition, and a few short\r\nbut excited little dialogues were maintained;--throughout all which\r\nTifto restrained himself like a Spartan. "At any rate he has been\r\nthoroughly disgraced," continued Mr. Jawstock, "as a sporting man. He\r\nhas been driven out of the Beargarden Club." "He resigned in disgust\r\nat their treatment," said a friend of the Major\'s. "Then let him\r\nresign in disgust at ours," said Mr. Jawstock, "for we won\'t have him\r\nhere. Caesar wouldn\'t keep a wife who was suspected of infidelity, nor\r\nwill the Runnymede country endure a Master of Hounds who is supposed\r\nto have driven a nail into a horse\'s foot."\r\n\r\nTwo or three other gentlemen had something to say before the Major\r\nwas allowed to speak,--the upshot of the discourse of all of them\r\nbeing the same. The Major must go.\r\n\r\nThen the Major got up, and certainly as far as attention went he\r\nhad full justice done him. However clamorous they might intend to\r\nbe afterwards that amount of fair play they were all determined\r\nto afford him. The Major was not excellent at speaking, but he\r\ndid perhaps better than might have been expected. "This is a very\r\ndisagreeable position," he said, "very disagreeable indeed. As for\r\nthe nail in the horse\'s foot I know no more about it than the babe\r\nunborn. But I\'ve got two things to say, and I\'ll say what aren\'t the\r\nmost consequence first. These hounds belong to me." Here he paused,\r\nand a loud contradiction came from many parts of the room. Mr.\r\nJawstock, however, proposed that the Major should be heard to the\r\nend. "I say they belong to me," repeated the Major. "If anybody\r\ntries his hand at anything else the law will soon set that to rights.\r\nBut that aren\'t of much consequence. What I\'ve got to say is this.\r\nLet the matter be referred. If that \'orse had a nail run into his\r\nfoot,--and I don\'t say he hadn\'t,--who was the man most injured? Why,\r\nLord Silverbridge. Everybody knows that. I suppose he dropped well on\r\nto eighty thousand pounds! I propose to leave it to him. Let him say.\r\nHe ought to know more about it than any one. He and I were partners\r\nin the horse. His Lordship aren\'t very sweet upon me just at present.\r\nNobody need fear that he\'ll do me a good turn. I say leave it to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nIn this matter the Major had certainly been well advised. A rumour\r\nhad become prevalent among sporting circles that Silverbridge had\r\nrefused to condemn the Major. It was known that he had paid his bets\r\nwithout delay, and that he had, to some extent, declined to take\r\nadvice from the leaders of the Jockey Club. The Major\'s friends were\r\ninformed that the young lord had refused to vote against him at the\r\nclub. Was it not more than probable that if this matter were referred\r\nto him he would refuse to give a verdict against his late partner?\r\n\r\nThe Major sat down, put on his cap, and folded his arms akimbo,\r\nwith his horn sticking out from his left hand. For a time there was\r\ngeneral silence, broken, however, by murmurs in different parts of\r\nthe room. Then Mr. Jawstock whispered something into the ear of the\r\nChairman, and Mr. Topps, rising from his seat, suggested to Tifto\r\nthat he should retire. "I think so," said Mr. Jawstock. "The\r\nproposition you have made can be discussed only in your absence."\r\nThen the Major held a consultation with one of his friends, and after\r\nthat did retire.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone the real hubbub of the meeting commenced. There were\r\nsome there who understood the nature of Lord Silverbridge\'s feelings\r\nin the matter. "He would be the last man in England to declare him\r\nguilty," said Mr. Jawstock. "Whatever my lord says, he shan\'t ride\r\nacross my land," said a farmer in the background. "I don\'t think\r\nany gentleman ever made a fairer proposition,--since anything was\r\nanything," said a friend of the Major\'s, a gentleman who kept\r\nlivery stables in Long Acre. "We won\'t have him here," said another\r\nfarmer,--whereupon Mr. Topps shook his head sadly. "I don\'t think\r\nany gentleman ought to be condemned without a \'earing," said one\r\nof Tifto\'s admirers, "and where you\'re to get any one to hunt the\r\ncountry like him, I don\'t know as any body is prepared to say."\r\n"We\'ll manage that," said a young gentleman from the neighbourhood of\r\nBagshot, who thought that he could hunt the country himself quite as\r\nwell as Major Tifto. "He must go from here; that\'s the long and the\r\nshort of it," said Mr. Jawstock. "Put it to the vote, Mr. Jawstock,"\r\nsaid the livery-stable keeper. Mr. Topps, who had had great\r\nexperience in public meetings, hereupon expressed an opinion that\r\nthey might as well go to a vote. No doubt he was right if the matter\r\nwas one which must sooner or later be decided in that manner.\r\n\r\nMr. Jawstock looked round the room trying to calculate what might\r\nbe the effect of a show of hands. The majority was with him; but he\r\nwas well aware that of this majority some few would be drawn away by\r\nthe apparent justice of Tifto\'s proposition. And what was the use of\r\nvoting? Let them vote as they might, it was out of the question that\r\nTifto should remain Master of the hunt. But the chairman had acceded,\r\nand on such occasions it is difficult to go against the chairman.\r\n\r\nThen there came a show of hands,--first for those who desired to\r\nrefer the matter to Lord Silverbridge, and afterwards for Tifto\'s\r\ndirect enemies,--for those who were anxious to banish Tifto out of\r\nhand, without reference to any one. At last the matter was settled.\r\nTo the great annoyance of Mr. Jawstock and the farmers, the meeting\r\nvoted that Lord Silverbridge should be invited to give his opinion as\r\nto the innocence or guilt of his late partner.\r\n\r\nThe Major\'s friends carried the discussion out to him as he sat on\r\nhorseback, as though he had altogether gained the battle and was\r\nsecure in his position as Master of the Runnymede Hunt for the next\r\ndozen years. But at the same time there came a message from Mr.\r\nMahogany Topps. It was now half-past two, and Mr. Topps expressed\r\na hope that Major Tifto would not draw the country on the present\r\noccasion. The Major, thinking that it might be as well to conciliate\r\nhis enemies, rode solemnly and slowly home to Tallyho Lodge in the\r\nmiddle of his hounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\nThe Major Is Deposed\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Silverbridge undertook to return with Tregear to London instead\r\nof going off direct to Matching, it is to be feared that he was\r\nsimply actuated by a desire to postpone his further visit to his\r\nfather\'s house. He had thought that Lady Mabel would surely be gone\r\nbefore his task at Polpenno was completed. As soon as he should again\r\nfind himself in his father\'s presence he would at once declare his\r\nintention of marrying Isabel Boncassen. But he could not see his way\r\nto doing it while Lady Mabel should be in the house.\r\n\r\n"I think you will find Mabel still at Matching," said Tregear on\r\ntheir way up. "She will wait for you, I fancy."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why she should wait for me," said Silverbridge almost\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n"I thought that you and she were fast friends."\r\n\r\n"I suppose we are--after a fashion. She might wait for you perhaps."\r\n\r\n"I think she would,--if I could go there."\r\n\r\n"You are much thicker with her than I ever was. You went to see her\r\nat Grex,--when nobody else was there."\r\n\r\n"Is Miss Cassewary nobody?"\r\n\r\n"Next door to it," said Silverbridge, half jealous of the favours\r\nshown to Tregear.\r\n\r\n"I thought," said Tregear, "that there would be a closer intimacy\r\nbetween you and her."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you should think so."\r\n\r\n"Had you never any such idea yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t any now,--so there may be an end of it. I don\'t think a\r\nfellow ought to be cross-questioned on such a subject."\r\n\r\n"Then I am very sorry for Mabel," said Tregear. This was uttered\r\nsolemnly, so that Silverbridge found himself debarred from making any\r\nflippant answer. He could not altogether defend himself. He had been\r\nquite justified, he thought, in changing his mind, but he did not\r\nlike to own that he had changed it so quickly.\r\n\r\n"I think we had better not talk any more about it," he said, after\r\npausing for a few moments. After that nothing more was said between\r\nthem on the subject.\r\n\r\nUp in town Silverbridge spent two or three days pleasantly enough,\r\nwhile a thunderbolt was being prepared for him, or rather, in truth,\r\ntwo thunderbolts. During these days he was much with Tregear; and\r\nthough he could not speak freely of his own matrimonial projects,\r\nstill he was brought round to give some sort of assent to the\r\nengagement between Tregear and his sister. This new position which\r\nhis friend had won for himself did in some degree operate on his\r\njudgment. It was not perhaps that he himself imagined that Tregear as\r\na member of Parliament would be worthier, but that he fancied that\r\nsuch would be the Duke\'s feelings. The Duke had declared that Tregear\r\nwas nobody. That could hardly be said of a man who had a seat in\r\nthe House of Commons;--certainly could not be said by so staunch a\r\npolitician as the Duke.\r\n\r\nBut had he known of those two thunderbolts he would not have enjoyed\r\nhis time at the Beargarden. The thunderbolts fell upon him in the\r\nshape of two letters which reached his hands at the same time, and\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Bobtailed Fox. Egham. 18th December.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   At a meeting held in this house to-day in reference to the\r\n   hunting of the Runnymede country, it was proposed that the\r\n   management of the hounds should be taken out of the hands\r\n   of Major Tifto, in consequence of certain conduct of which\r\n   it is alleged that he was guilty at the last Doncaster\r\n   races.\r\n\r\n   Major Tifto was present, and requested that your\r\n   Lordship\'s opinion should be asked as to his guilt. I do\r\n   not know myself that we are warranted in troubling your\r\n   Lordship on the subject. I am, however, commissioned by\r\n   the majority of the gentlemen who were present to ask\r\n   you whether you think that Major Tifto\'s conduct on that\r\n   occasion was of such a nature as to make him unfit to be\r\n   the depositary of that influence, authority, and intimacy\r\n   which ought to be at the command of a Master of Hounds.\r\n\r\n   I feel myself bound to inform your Lordship that the hunt\r\n   generally will be inclined to place great weight upon your\r\n   opinion; but that it does not undertake to reinstate Major\r\n   Tifto, even should your opinion be in his favour.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be,\r\n   My Lord,\r\n   Your Lordship\'s most obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n   JEREMIAH JAWSTOCK.\r\n\r\n   Juniper Lodge, Staines.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Jawstock, when he had written this letter, was proud of his own\r\nlanguage, but still felt that the application was a very lame one.\r\nWhy ask any man for an opinion, and tell him at the same time that\r\nhis opinion might probably not be taken? And yet no other alternative\r\nhad been left to him. The meeting had decided that the application\r\nshould be made; but Mr. Jawstock was well aware that let the young\r\nLord\'s answer be what it might, the Major would not be endured as\r\nMaster in the Runnymede country. Mr. Jawstock felt that the passage\r\nin which he explained that a Master of Hounds should be a depositary\r\nof influence and intimacy, was good;--but yet the application was\r\nlame, very lame.\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge as he read it thought that it was very unfair.\r\nIt was a most disagreeable thunderbolt. Then he opened the second\r\nletter, of which he well knew the handwriting. It was from the Major.\r\nTifto\'s letters were very legible, but the writing was cramped,\r\nshowing that the operation had been performed with difficulty.\r\nSilverbridge had hoped that he might never receive another epistle\r\nfrom his late partner. The letter, as follows, had been drawn out for\r\nTifto in rough by the livery-stable keeper in Long Acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR LORD SILVERBRIDGE,\r\n\r\n   I venture respectfully to appeal to your Lordship for\r\n   an act of justice. Nobody has more of a true-born\r\n   Englishman\'s feeling of fair play between man and man than\r\n   your Lordship; and as you and me have been a good deal\r\n   together, and your Lordship ought to know me pretty well,\r\n   I venture to appeal to your Lordship for a good word.\r\n\r\n   All that story from Doncaster has got down into the\r\n   country where I am M.F.H. Nobody could have been more\r\n   sorry than me that your Lordship dropped your money. Would\r\n   not I have been prouder than anything to have a horse in\r\n   my name win the race! Was it likely I should lame him?\r\n   Anyways I didn\'t, and I don\'t think your Lordship thinks\r\n   it was me. Of course your Lordship and me is two now;--but\r\n   that don\'t alter the facts.\r\n\r\n   What I want is your Lordship to send me a line, just\r\n   stating your Lordship\'s opinion that I didn\'t do it, and\r\n   didn\'t have nothing to do with it;--which I didn\'t. There\r\n   was a meeting at The Bobtailed Fox yesterday, and the\r\n   gentlemen was all of one mind to go by what your Lordship\r\n   would say. I couldn\'t desire nothing fairer. So I hope\r\n   your Lordship will stand to me now, and write something\r\n   that will pull me through.\r\n\r\n   With all respects I beg to remain,\r\n   Your Lordship\'s most dutiful Servant,\r\n\r\n   T. TIFTO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was something in this letter which the Major himself did not\r\nquite approve. There was an absence of familiarity about it which\r\nannoyed him. He would have liked to call upon his late partner to\r\ndeclare that a more honourable man than Major Tifto had never been\r\nknown on the turf. But he felt himself to be so far down in the world\r\nthat it was not safe for him to hold an opinion of his own, even\r\nagainst the livery-stable keeper!\r\n\r\nSilverbridge was for a time in doubt whether he should answer the\r\nletters at all, and if so how he should answer them. In regard to Mr.\r\nJawstock and the meeting at large, he regarded the application as\r\nan impertinence. But as to Tifto himself he vacillated much between\r\npity, contempt, and absolute condemnation. Everybody had assured him\r\nthat the man had certainly been guilty. The fact that he had made\r\nbets against their joint horse,--bets as to which he had said nothing\r\ntill after the race was over,--had been admitted by himself. And yet\r\nit was possible that the man might not be such a rascal as to be\r\nunfit to manage the Runnymede hounds. Having himself got rid of\r\nTifto, he would have been glad that the poor wretch should have been\r\nleft with his hunting honours. But he did not think that he could\r\nwrite to his late partner any letter that would preserve those\r\nhonours to him.\r\n\r\nAt Tregear\'s advice he referred the matter to Mr. Lupton. Mr. Lupton\r\nwas of opinion that both the letters should be answered, but that\r\nthe answer to each should be very short. "There is a prejudice about\r\nthe world just at present," said Mr. Lupton, "in favour of answering\r\nletters. I don\'t see why I am to be subjected to an annoyance because\r\nanother man has taken a liberty. But it is better to submit to public\r\nopinion. Public opinion thinks that letters should be answered." Then\r\nMr. Lupton dictated the answers.\r\n\r\n"Lord Silverbridge presents his compliments to Mr. Jawstock, and\r\nbegs to say that he does not feel himself called upon to express\r\nany opinion as to Major Tifto\'s conduct at Doncaster." That was the\r\nfirst. The second was rather less simple, but not much longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n   SIR,\r\n\r\n   I do not feel myself called upon to express any opinion\r\n   either to you or to others as to your conduct at\r\n   Doncaster. Having received a letter on the subject from\r\n   Mr. Jawstock I have written to him to this effect.\r\n\r\n   Your obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n   SILVERBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n   To T. Tifto, Esq.,\r\n   Tallyho Lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Tifto, when he got this very curt epistle, was broken-hearted.\r\nHe did not dare to show it. Day after day he told the livery-stable\r\nkeeper that he had received no reply, and at last asserted that his\r\nappeal had remained altogether unanswered. Even this he thought\r\nwas better than acknowledging the rebuff which had reached him.\r\nAs regarded the meeting which had been held,--and any further\r\nmeetings which might be held,--at The Bobtailed Fox, he did not\r\nsee the necessity, as he explained to the livery-stable keeper, of\r\nacknowledging that he had written any letter to Lord Silverbridge.\r\n\r\nThe letter to Mr. Jawstock was of course brought forward. Another\r\nmeeting at The Bobtailed Fox was convened. But in the meantime\r\nhunting had been discontinued in the Runnymede country. The Major\r\nwith all his pluck, with infinite cherry brandy, could not do it. Men\r\nwho had a few weeks since been on very friendly terms, and who had\r\ncalled each other Dick and Harry when the squabble first began, were\r\nnow talking of "punching" each other\'s heads. Special whips had been\r\nprocured by men who intended to ride, and special bludgeons by the\r\nyoung farmers who intended that nobody should ride as long as Major\r\nTifto kept the hounds. It was said that the police would interfere.\r\nIt was whispered that the hounds would be shot,--though Mr. Topps,\r\nMr. Jawstock, and others declared that no crime so heinous as that\r\nhad ever been contemplated in the Runnymede country.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties were too many for poor Tifto, and the hounds were\r\nnot brought out again under his influence.\r\n\r\nA second meeting was summoned, and an invitation was sent to the\r\nMajor similar to that which he had before received;--but on this\r\noccasion he did not appear. Nor were there many of the gentlemen\r\ndown from London. This second meeting might almost have been called\r\nselect. Mr. Mahogany Topps was there of course, in the chair, and\r\nMr. Jawstock took the place of honour and of difficulty on his right\r\nhand. There was the young gentleman from Bagshot, who considered\r\nhimself quite fit to take Tifto\'s place if somebody else would pay\r\nthe bills and settle the money, and there was the sporting old parson\r\nfrom Croppingham. Three or four other members of the hunt were\r\npresent, and perhaps half-a-dozen farmers, ready to declare that\r\nMajor Tifto should never be allowed to cross their fields again.\r\n\r\nBut there was no opposition. Mr. Jawstock read the young lord\'s note,\r\nand declared that it was quite as much as he expected. He considered\r\nthat the note, short as it was, must be decisive. Major Tifto, in\r\nappealing to Lord Silverbridge, had agreed to abide by his Lordship\'s\r\nanswer, and that answer was now before them. Mr. Jawstock ventured to\r\npropose that Major Tifto should be declared to be no longer Master\r\nof the Runnymede Hounds. The parson from Croppingham seconded the\r\nproposition, and Major Tifto was formally deposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\nNo One Can Tell What May Come to Pass\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Lord Silverbridge necessarily went down to Matching, knowing\r\nthat he must meet Mabel Grex. Why should she have prolonged her\r\nvisit? No doubt it might be very pleasant for her to be his father\'s\r\nguest at Matching, but she had been there above a month! He could\r\nunderstand that his father should ask her to remain. His father was\r\nstill brooding over that foolish communication which had been made\r\nto him on the night of the dinner at the Beargarden. His father was\r\nstill intending to take Mabel to his arms as a daughter-in-law. But\r\nLady Mabel herself knew that it could not be so! The whole truth had\r\nbeen told to her. Why should she remain at Matching for the sake of\r\nbeing mixed up in a scene the acting of which could not fail to be\r\ndisagreeable to her?\r\n\r\nHe found the house very quiet and nearly empty. Mrs. Finn was there\r\nwith the two girls, and Mr. Warburton had come back. Miss Cassewary\r\nhad gone to a brother\'s house. Other guests to make Christmas merry\r\nthere were none. As he looked round at the large rooms he reflected\r\nthat he himself was there only for a special purpose. It was his duty\r\nto break the news of his intended marriage to his father. As he stood\r\nbefore the fire, thinking how best he might do this, it occurred\r\nto him that a letter from a distance would have been the ready and\r\nsimple way. But then it had occurred to him also, when at a distance,\r\nthat a declaration of his purpose face to face was the simplest and\r\nreadiest way. If you have to go headlong into the water you should\r\ntake your plunge without hesitating. So he told himself, making up\r\nhis mind that he would have it all out that evening.\r\n\r\nAt dinner Lady Mabel sat next to his father, and he could watch the\r\nspecial courtesy with which the Duke treated the girl whom he was so\r\ndesirous of introducing to his house. Silverbridge could not talk\r\nabout the election at Polpenno because all conversation about Tregear\r\nwas interdicted in the presence of his sister. He could say nothing\r\nas to the Runnymede hunt and the two thunderbolts which had fallen\r\non him, as Major Tifto was not a subject on which he could expatiate\r\nin the presence of his father. He asked a few questions about the\r\nshooting, and referred with great regret to his absence from the\r\nBrake country.\r\n\r\n"I am sure Mr. Cassewary could spare you for another fortnight,"\r\nthe Duke said to his neighbour, alluding to a visit which she now\r\nintended to make.\r\n\r\n"If so he would have to spare me altogether," said Mabel, "for I must\r\nmeet my father in London in the middle of January."\r\n\r\n"Could you not put it off to another year?"\r\n\r\n"You would think I had taken root and was growing at Matching."\r\n\r\n"Of all our products you would be the most delightful, and the most\r\ncharming,--and we would hope the most permanent," said the courteous\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\n"After being here so long I need hardly say that I like Matching\r\nbetter than any place in the world. I suppose it is the contrast to\r\nGrex."\r\n\r\n"Grex was a palace," said the Duke, "before a wall of this house had\r\nbeen built."\r\n\r\n"Grex is very old, and very wild,--and very uncomfortable. But I love\r\nit dearly. Matching is the very reverse of Grex."\r\n\r\n"Not I hope in your affections."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean that. I think one likes a contrast. But I must go,\r\nsay on the first of January, to pick up Miss Cassewary."\r\n\r\nIt was certain, therefore, that she was going on the first of\r\nJanuary. How would it be if he put off the telling of his story for\r\nyet another week, till she should be gone? Then he looked around and\r\nbethought himself that the time would hang very heavy with him. And\r\nhis father would daily expect from him a declaration exactly opposed\r\nto that which he had to make. He had no horses to ride. As he went\r\non listening he almost convinced himself that the proper thing to do\r\nwould be to go back to London and thence write to his father. He made\r\nno confession to his father on that night.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning there was a heavy fall of snow, but nevertheless\r\neverybody managed to go to church. The Duke, as he looked at Lady\r\nMabel tripping along over the swept paths in her furs and short\r\npetticoats and well-made boots, thought that his son was a lucky\r\nfellow to have the chance of winning the love of such a girl. No\r\nremembrance of Miss Boncassen came across his mind as he saw them\r\nclose together. It was so important that Silverbridge should marry\r\nand thus be kept from further follies! And it was so momentous to the\r\nfortunes of the Palliser family generally that he should marry well!\r\nIn thinking so it did not occur to him that the granddaughter of an\r\nAmerican labourer might be offered to him. A young lady fit to be\r\nDuchess of Omnium was not to be found everywhere. But this girl,\r\nhe thought as he saw her walking briskly and strongly through the\r\nsnow, with every mark of health about her, with every sign of high\r\nbreeding, very beautiful, exquisite in manner, gracious as a goddess,\r\nwas fit to be a Duchess! Silverbridge at this moment was walking\r\nclose to her side,--in good looks, in gracious manner, in high\r\nbreeding her equal,--in worldly gifts infinitely her superior. Surely\r\nshe would not despise him! Silverbridge at the moment was expressing\r\na hope that the sermon would not be very long.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch Mabel came suddenly behind the chair on which\r\nSilverbridge was sitting and asked him to take a walk with her. Was\r\nshe not afraid of the snow? "Perhaps you are," she said laughing. "I\r\ndo not mind it in the least." When they were but a few yards from the\r\nfront door, she put her hand upon his arm, and spoke to him as though\r\nshe had arranged the walk with reference to that special question,\r\n"And now tell me all about Frank."\r\n\r\nShe had arranged everything. She had a plan before her now, and had\r\ndetermined in accordance with that plan that she would say nothing to\r\ndisturb him on this occasion. If she could succeed in bringing him\r\ninto good humour with herself, that should be sufficient for to-day.\r\n"Now tell me everything about Frank."\r\n\r\n"Frank is member of Parliament for Polpenno. That is all."\r\n\r\n"That is so like a man and so unlike a woman. What did he say? What\r\ndid he do? How did he look? What did you say? What did you do? How\r\ndid you look?"\r\n\r\n"We looked very miserable, when we got wet through, walking about all\r\nday in the rain."\r\n\r\n"Was that necessary?"\r\n\r\n"Quite necessary. We looked so mean and draggled that nobody would\r\nhave voted for us, only that poor Mr. Carbottle looked meaner and\r\nmore draggled."\r\n\r\n"The Duke says you made ever so many speeches."\r\n\r\n"I should think I did. It is very easy to make speeches down at a\r\nplace like that. Tregear spoke like a book."\r\n\r\n"He spoke well?"\r\n\r\n"Awfully well. He told them that all the good things that had ever\r\nbeen done in Parliament had been carried by the Tories. He went back\r\nto Pitt\'s time, and had it all at his fingers\' ends."\r\n\r\n"And quite true."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what it was not. It was all a crammer. But it did as\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"I am glad he is a member. Don\'t you think the Duke will come round a\r\nlittle now?"\r\n\r\nWhen Tregear and the election had been sufficiently discussed,\r\nthey came by degrees to Major Tifto and the two thunderbolts.\r\nSilverbridge, when he perceived that nothing was to be said about\r\nIsabel Boncassen, or his own freedom in the matter of love-making,\r\nwas not sorry to have a friend from whom he could find sympathy for\r\nhimself in his own troubles. With some encouragement from Mabel the\r\nwhole story was told. "Was it not a great impertinence?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"It was an awful bore. What could I say? I was not going to pronounce\r\njudgment against the poor devil. I daresay he was good enough for Mr.\r\nJawstock."\r\n\r\n"But I suppose he did cheat horribly."\r\n\r\n"I daresay he did. A great many of them do cheat. But what of that? I\r\nwas not bound to give him a character, bad or good."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"He had not been my servant. It was such a letter. I\'ll show it you\r\nwhen we get in!--asking whether Tifto was fit to be the depositary of\r\nthe intimacy of the Runnymede hunt! And then Tif\'s letter;--I almost\r\nwept over that."\r\n\r\n"How could he have had the audacity to write at all?"\r\n\r\n"He said that \'him and me had been a good deal together.\'\r\nUnfortunately that was true. Even now I am not quite sure that he\r\nlamed the horse himself."\r\n\r\n"Everybody thinks he did. Percival says there is no doubt about it."\r\n\r\n"Percival knows nothing about it. Three of the gang ran away, and he\r\nstood his ground. That\'s about all we do know."\r\n\r\n"What did you say to him?"\r\n\r\n"I had to address him as Sir, and beg him not to write to me any\r\nmore. Of course they mean to get rid of him, and I couldn\'t do him\r\nany good. Poor Tifto! Upon the whole I think I hate Jawstock worse\r\nthan Tifto."\r\n\r\nLady Mabel was content with her afternoon\'s work. When they had been\r\nat Matching before the Polpenno election, there had apparently been\r\nno friendship between them,--at any rate no confidential friendship.\r\nMiss Boncassen had been there, and he had had neither ears nor eyes\r\nfor any one else. But now something like the feeling of old days had\r\nbeen restored. She had not done much towards her great object;--but\r\nthen she had known that nothing could be done till he should again be\r\nin a good humour with her.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday, the Monday, and the Tuesday they were again together.\r\nIn some of these interviews Silverbridge described the Polpenno\r\npeople, and told her how Miss Tregear had been reassured by his\r\neloquence. He also read to her the Jawstock and Tifto correspondence,\r\nand was complimented by her as to his prudence and foresight. "To\r\ntell the truth I consulted Mr. Lupton," he said, not liking to take\r\ncredit for wisdom which had not been his own. Then they talked about\r\nGrex, and Killancodlem, about Gerald and the shooting, about Mary\'s\r\nlove for Tregear, and about the work of the coming Session. On\r\nall these subjects they were comfortable and confidential,--Miss\r\nBoncassen\'s name never having been as yet so much as mentioned.\r\n\r\nBut still the real work was before her. She had not hoped to bring\r\nhim round to kneel once more at her feet by such gentle measures as\r\nthese. She had not dared to dream that he could in this way be taught\r\nto forget the past autumn and all its charms. She knew well that\r\nthere was something very difficult before her. But, if that difficult\r\nthing might be done at all, these were the preparations which must be\r\nmade for the doing of it.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that she should leave Matching on Saturday, the first\r\nday of the new year. Things had gone on in the manner described till\r\nthe Thursday had come. The Duke had been impatient but had restrained\r\nhimself. He had seen that they were much together and that they were\r\napparently friends. He too told himself that there were two more\r\ndays, and that before the end of those days everything might be\r\npleasantly settled!\r\n\r\nIt had become a matter of course that Silverbridge and Mabel should\r\nwalk together in the afternoon. He himself had felt that there was\r\ndanger in this,--not danger that he should be untrue to Isabel, but\r\nthat he should make others think that he was true to Mabel. But he\r\nexcused himself on the plea that he and Mabel had been intimate\r\nfriends,--were still intimate friends, and that she was going away\r\nin a day or two. Mary, who watched it all, was sure that misery was\r\nbeing prepared for someone. She was aware that by this time her\r\nfather was anxious to welcome Mabel as his daughter-in-law. She\r\nstrongly suspected that something had been said between her father\r\nand her brother on the subject. But then she had Isabel Boncassen\'s\r\ndirect assurance that Silverbridge was engaged to her! Now when\r\nIsabel\'s back was turned, Silverbridge and Mabel were always\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday after lunch they were again out together. It had\r\nbecome so much a habit that the walk repeated itself without an\r\neffort. It had been part of Mabel\'s scheme that it should be so.\r\nDuring all this morning she had been thinking of her scheme. It was\r\nall but hopeless. So much she had declared to herself. But forlorn\r\nhopes do sometimes end in splendid triumphs. That which she might\r\ngain was so much! And what could she lose? The sweet bloom of her\r\nmaiden shame? That, she told herself, with bitterest inward tears,\r\nwas already gone from her. Frank Tregear at any rate knew where her\r\nheart had been given. Frank Tregear knew that having lost her heart\r\nto one man she was anxious to marry another. He knew that she was\r\nwilling to accept the coronet of a duchess as her consolation.\r\nThat bloom of her maiden shame, of which she quite understood the\r\nsweetness, the charm, the value--was gone when she had brought\r\nherself to such a state that any human being should know that, loving\r\none man, she should be willing to marry another. The sweet treasure\r\nwas gone from her. Its aroma was fled. It behoved her now to be\r\nambitious, cautious,--and if possible successful.\r\n\r\nWhen first she had so resolved, success seemed to be easily within\r\nher reach. Of all the golden youths that crossed her path no one was\r\nso pleasant to her eye, to her ear, to her feelings generally as this\r\nDuke\'s young heir. There was a coming manliness about him which she\r\nliked,--and she liked even the slight want of present manliness.\r\nPutting aside Frank Tregear she could go nearer to loving him than\r\nany other man she had ever seen. With him she would not be turned\r\nfrom her duties by disgust, by dislike, or dismay. She could even\r\nthink that the time would come when she might really love him. Then\r\nshe had all but succeeded, and she might have succeeded altogether\r\nhad she been but a little more prudent. But she had allowed her great\r\nprize to escape from her fingers.\r\n\r\nBut the prize was not yet utterly beyond her grasp. To recover\r\nit,--to recover even the smallest chance of recovering it, there\r\nwould be need of great exertion. She must be bold, sudden,\r\nunwomanlike,--and yet with such display of woman\'s charm that he at\r\nleast should discover no want. She must be false, but false with\r\nsuch perfect deceit, that he must regard her as a pearl of truth.\r\nIf anything could lure him back it must be his conviction of her\r\npassionate love. And she must be strong;--so strong as to overcome\r\nnot only his weakness, but all that was strong in him. She knew that\r\nhe did love that other girl,--and she must overcome even that. And to\r\ndo this she must prostrate herself at his feet,--as, since the world\r\nbegan, it has been man\'s province to prostrate himself at the feet of\r\nthe woman he loves.\r\n\r\nTo do this she must indeed bid adieu to the sweet bloom of her maiden\r\nshame! But had she not done so already when, by the side of the brook\r\nat Killancodlem, she had declared to him plainly enough her despair\r\nat hearing that he loved that other girl? Though she were to grovel\r\nat his feet she could not speak more plainly than she had spoken\r\nthen. She could not tell her story now more plainly than she had done\r\nthen; but,--though the chances were small,--perchance she might tell\r\nit more effectually.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps this will be our last walk," she said. "Come down to the\r\nseat over the river."\r\n\r\n"Why should it be the last? You\'ll be here to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"There are so many slips in such things," she said laughing. "You may\r\nget a letter from your constituents that will want all the day to\r\nanswer. Or your father may have a political communication to make to\r\nme. But at any rate come." So they went to the seat.\r\n\r\nIt was a spot in the park from whence there was a distant view over\r\nmany lands, and low beneath the bench, which stood on the edge of a\r\nsteep bank, ran a stream which made a sweeping bend in this place, so\r\nthat a reach of the little river might be seen both to the right and\r\nto the left. Though the sun was shining, the snow under their feet\r\nwas hard with frost. It was an air such as one sometimes finds in\r\nEngland, and often in America. Though the cold was very perceptible,\r\nthough water in the shade was freezing at this moment, there was no\r\nfeeling of damp, no sense of bitter wind. It was a sweet and jocund\r\nair, such as would make young people prone to run and skip. "You\r\nare not going to sit down with all the snow on the bench," said\r\nSilverbridge.\r\n\r\nOn their way thither she had not said a word that would disturb him.\r\nShe had spoken to him of the coming Session, and had managed to\r\ndisplay to him the interest which she took in his parliamentary\r\ncareer. In doing this she had flattered him to the top of his bent.\r\nIf he would return to his father\'s politics, then would she too\r\nbecome a renegade. Would he speak in the next Session? She hoped he\r\nwould speak. And if he did, might she be there to hear him? She was\r\ncautious not to say a word of Frank Tregear, understanding something\r\nof that strange jealousy which could exist even when he who was\r\njealous did not love the woman who caused it.\r\n\r\n"No," she said, "I do not think we can sit. But still I like to\r\nbe here with you. All that some day will be your own." Then she\r\nstretched her hands out to the far view.\r\n\r\n"Some of it, I suppose. I don\'t think it is all ours. As for that, if\r\nwe cared for extent of acres, one ought to go to Barsetshire."\r\n\r\n"Is that larger?"\r\n\r\n"Twice as large, I believe, and yet none of the family like being\r\nthere. The rental is very well."\r\n\r\n"And the borough," she said, leaning on his arm and looking up into\r\nhis face. "What a happy fellow you ought to be."\r\n\r\n"Bar Tifto,--and Mr. Jawstock."\r\n\r\n"You have got rid of Tifto and all those troubles very easily."\r\n\r\n"Thanks to the governor."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. I do love your father so dearly."\r\n\r\n"So do I--rather."\r\n\r\n"May I tell you something about him?" As she asked the question she\r\nwas standing very close to him, leaning upon his arm, with her left\r\nhand crossed upon her right. Had others been there, of course she\r\nwould not have stood in such a guise. She knew that,--and he knew it\r\ntoo. Of course there was something in it of declared affection,--of\r\nthat kind of love which most of us have been happy enough to give and\r\nreceive, without intending to show more than true friendship will\r\nallow at special moments.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me anything about him I shan\'t like to hear."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--that is so hard to know. I wish you would like to hear it."\r\n\r\n"What can it be?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you now."\r\n\r\n"Why not? And why did you offer?"\r\n\r\n"Because-- Oh, Silverbridge."\r\n\r\nHe certainly as yet did not understand it. It had never occurred to\r\nhim that she would know what were his father\'s wishes. Perhaps he was\r\nslow of comprehension as he urged her to tell him what this was about\r\nhis father. "What can you tell me about him, that I should not like\r\nto hear?"\r\n\r\n"You do not know? Oh, Silverbridge, I think you know." Then there\r\ncame upon him a glimmering of the truth. "You do know." And she stood\r\napart looking him full in the face.\r\n\r\n"I do not know what you can have to tell me."\r\n\r\n"No;--no. It is not I that should tell you. But yet it is so.\r\nSilverbridge, what did you say to me when you came to me that morning\r\nin the Square?"\r\n\r\n"What did I say?"\r\n\r\n"Was I not entitled to think that you--loved me?" To this he had\r\nnothing to reply, but stood before her silent and frowning. "Think of\r\nit, Silverbridge. Was it not so? And because I did not at once tell\r\nyou all the truth, because I did not there say that my heart was all\r\nyours, were you right to leave me?"\r\n\r\n"You only laughed at me."\r\n\r\n"No;--no; no; I never laughed at you. How could I laugh when you were\r\nall the world to me? Ask Frank;--he knew. Ask Miss Cass;--she knew.\r\nAnd can you say you did not know; you, you, you yourself? Can any\r\ngirl suppose that such words as these are to mean nothing when they\r\nhave been spoken? You knew I loved you."\r\n\r\n"No;--no."\r\n\r\n"You must have known it. I will never believe but that you knew it.\r\nWhy should your father be so sure of it?"\r\n\r\n"He never was sure of it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Silverbridge; yes. There is not one in the house who does not\r\nsee that he treats me as though he expected me to be his son\'s wife.\r\nDo you not know that he wishes it?" He fain would not have answered\r\nthis; but she paused for his answer and then repeated her question.\r\n"Do you not know that he wishes it?"\r\n\r\n"I think he does," said Silverbridge; "but it can never be so."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Silverbridge;--oh, my loved one! Do not say that to me! Do not\r\nkill me at once!" Now she placed her hands one on each arm as she\r\nstood opposite to him and looked up into his face. "You said you\r\nloved me once. Why do you desert me now? Have you a right to treat me\r\nlike that;--when I tell you that you have all my heart?" The tears\r\nwere now streaming down her face, and they were not counterfeit\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"You know," he said, submitting to her hands, but not lifting his arm\r\nto embrace her.\r\n\r\n"What do I know?"\r\n\r\n"That I have given all I have to give to another." As he said this he\r\nlooked away sternly, over her shoulder, to the distance.\r\n\r\n"That American girl!" she exclaimed, starting back, with some show of\r\nsternness also on her brow.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--that American girl," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\nThen she recovered herself immediately. Indignation, natural\r\nindignation, would not serve her turn in the present emergency. "You\r\nknow that cannot be. You ought to know it. What will your father\r\nsay? You have not dared to tell him. That is so natural," she added,\r\ntrying to appease his frown. "How possibly can it be told to him? I\r\nwill not say a word against her."\r\n\r\n"No; do not do that."\r\n\r\n"But there are fitnesses of things which such a one as you cannot\r\ndisregard without preparing for yourself a whole life of repentance."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Mabel."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell you the truth."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I would sooner lose all;--the rank I have; the rank that I am to\r\nhave; all these lands that you have been looking on; my father\'s\r\nwealth, my seat in Parliament,--everything that fortune has done for\r\nme,--I would give them all up, sooner than lose her." Now at any rate\r\nhe was a man. She was sure of that now. This was more, very much\r\nmore, not only than she had expected from him, but more than she had\r\nthought it possible that his character should have produced.\r\n\r\nHis strength reduced her to weakness. "And I am nothing," she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed; you are Lady Mabel Grex,--whom all women envy, and whom\r\nall men honour."\r\n\r\n"The poorest wretch this day under the sun."\r\n\r\n"Do not say that. You should take shame to say that."\r\n\r\n"I do take shame;--and I do say it. Sir, do you not feel what you owe\r\nme? Do you not know that you have made me the wretch I am? How did\r\nyou dare to talk to me as you did talk when you were in London? You\r\ntell me that I am Lady Mabel Grex;--and yet you come to me with a lie\r\non your lips,--with such a lie as that! You must have taken me for\r\nsome nursemaid on whom you had condescended to cast your eye! It\r\ncannot be that even you should have dared to treat Lady Mabel Grex\r\nafter such a fashion as that! And now you have cast your eye on this\r\nother girl. You can never marry her!"\r\n\r\n"I shall endeavour to do so."\r\n\r\n"You can never marry her," she said, stamping her foot. She had now\r\nlost all the caution which she had taught herself for the prosecution\r\nof her scheme,--all the care with which she had burdened herself. Now\r\nshe was natural enough. "No,--you can never marry her. You could not\r\nshow yourself after it in your clubs, or in Parliament, or in the\r\nworld. Come home, do you say? No, I will not go to your home. It is\r\nnot my home. Cold;--of course I am cold;--cold through to the heart."\r\n\r\n"I cannot leave you alone here," he said, for she had now turned from\r\nhim, and was walking with hurried steps and short turns on the edge\r\nof the bank, which at this place was almost a precipice.\r\n\r\n"You have left me,--utterly in the cold--more desolate than I am here\r\neven though I should spend the night among the trees. But I will go\r\nback, and will tell your father everything. If my father were other\r\nthan he is,--if my brother were better to me, you would not have done\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"If you had a legion of brothers it would have been the same," he\r\nsaid, turning sharp upon her.\r\n\r\nThey walked on together, but without a word till the house was in\r\nsight. Then she looked round at him, and stopped him on the path as\r\nshe caught his eye. "Silverbridge!" she said.\r\n\r\n"Lady Mabel."\r\n\r\n"Call me Mabel. At any rate call me Mabel. If I have said anything to\r\noffend you--I beg your pardon."\r\n\r\n"I am not offended--but unhappy."\r\n\r\n"If you are unhappy, what must I be? What have I to look forward to?\r\nGive me your hand, and say that we are friends."\r\n\r\n"Certainly we are friends," he said, as he gave her his hand.\r\n\r\n"Who can tell what may come to pass?" To this he would make no\r\nanswer, as it seemed to imply that some division between himself and\r\nIsabel Boncassen might possibly come to pass. "You will not tell any\r\none that I love you?"\r\n\r\n"I tell such a thing as that!"\r\n\r\n"But never forget it yourself. No one can tell what may come to\r\npass."\r\n\r\nLady Mabel at once went up to her room. She had played her scene, but\r\nwas well aware that she had played it altogether unsuccessfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX\r\n\r\nLord Gerald in Further Trouble\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Silverbridge got back to the house he was by no means well\r\npleased with himself. In the first place he was unhappy to think that\r\nMabel was unhappy, and that he had made her so. And then she had told\r\nhim that he would not have dared to have acted as he had done, but\r\nthat her father and her brother were careless to defend her. He had\r\nreplied fiercely that a legion of brothers, ready to act on her\r\nbehalf, would not have altered his conduct; but not the less did he\r\nfeel that he had behaved badly to her. It could not now be altered.\r\nHe could not now be untrue to Isabel. But certainly he had said a\r\nword or two to Mabel which he could not remember without regret. He\r\nhad not thought that a word from him could have been so powerful.\r\nNow, when that word was recalled to his memory by the girl to whom it\r\nhad been spoken, he could not quite acquit himself.\r\n\r\nAnd Mabel had declared to him that she would at once appeal to his\r\nfather. There was an absurdity in this at which he could not but\r\nsmile,--that the girl should complain to his father because he would\r\nnot marry her! But even in doing this she might cause him great\r\nvexation. He could not bring himself to ask her not to tell her story\r\nto the Duke. He must take all that as it might come.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thinking of all this in his own room a servant brought\r\nhim two letters. From the first which he opened he soon perceived\r\nthat it contained an account of more troubles. It was from his\r\nbrother Gerald, and was written from Auld Reikie, the name of a house\r\nin Scotland belonging to Lord Nidderdale\'s people.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR SILVER,\r\n\r\n   I have got into a most awful scrape. That fellow Percival\r\n   is here, and Dolly Longstaff, and Nidderdale, and\r\n   Popplecourt, and Jack Hindes, and Perry who is in the\r\n   Coldstreams, and one or two more, and there has been a lot\r\n   of cards, and I have lost ever so much money. I wouldn\'t\r\n   mind it so much but Percival has won it all,--a fellow\r\n   I hate; and now I owe him--three thousand four hundred\r\n   pounds! He has just told me he is hard up and that he\r\n   wants the money before the week is over. He can\'t be hard\r\n   up because he has won from everybody;--but of course I had\r\n   to tell him that I would pay him.\r\n\r\n   Can you help me? Of course I know that I have been a fool.\r\n   Percival knows what he is about and plays regularly for\r\n   money. When I began I didn\'t think that I could lose above\r\n   twenty or thirty pounds. But it got on from one thing to\r\n   another, and when I woke this morning I felt I didn\'t know\r\n   what to do with myself. You can\'t think how the luck went\r\n   against me. Everybody says that they never saw such cards.\r\n\r\n   And now do tell me how I am to get out of it. Could you\r\n   manage it with Mr. Moreton? Of course I will make it all\r\n   right with you some day. Moreton always lets you have\r\n   whatever you want. But perhaps you couldn\'t do this\r\n   without letting the governor know. I would rather anything\r\n   than that. There is some money owing at Oxford also, which\r\n   of course he must know.\r\n\r\n   I was thinking that perhaps I might get it from some of\r\n   those fellows in London. There are people called Comfort\r\n   and Criball, who let men have money constantly. I know two\r\n   or three up at Oxford who have had it from them. Of course\r\n   I couldn\'t go to them as you could do, for, in spite of\r\n   what the governor said to us up in London one day, there\r\n   is nothing that must come to me. But you could do anything\r\n   in that way, and of course I would stand to it.\r\n\r\n   I know you won\'t throw me over, because you always have\r\n   been such a brick. But above all things don\'t tell the\r\n   governor. Percival is such a nasty fellow, otherwise I\r\n   shouldn\'t mind it. He spoke this morning as though I was\r\n   treating him badly,--though the money was only lost last\r\n   night; and he looked at me in a way that made me long to\r\n   kick him. I told him not to flurry himself, and that he\r\n   should have his money. If he speaks to me like that again\r\n   I will kick him.\r\n\r\n   I will be at Matching as soon as possible, but I cannot go\r\n   till this is settled. Nid--[meaning Lord Nidderdale]--is a\r\n   brick.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate Brother,\r\n\r\n   GERALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other was from Nidderdale, and referred to the same subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR SILVERBRIDGE,\r\n\r\n   Here has been a terrible nuisance. Last night some of\r\n   the men got to playing cards, and Gerald lost a terribly\r\n   large sum to Percival. I did all that I could to stop it,\r\n   because I saw that Percival was going in for a big thing.\r\n   I fancy that he got as much from Dolly Longstaff as he did\r\n   from Gerald;--but it won\'t matter much to Dolly; or if it\r\n   does, nobody cares. Gerald told me he was writing to you\r\n   about it, so I am not betraying him.\r\n\r\n   What is to be done? Of course Percival is behaving badly.\r\n   He always does. I can\'t turn him out of the house, and he\r\n   seems to intend to stick to Gerald till he has got the\r\n   money. He has taken a cheque from Dolly dated two months\r\n   hence. I am in an awful funk for fear Gerald should pitch\r\n   into him. He will, in a minute, if anything rough is said\r\n   to him. I suppose the straightest thing would be to go to\r\n   the Duke at once, but Gerald won\'t hear of it. I hope you\r\n   won\'t think me wrong to tell you. If I could help him I\r\n   would. You know what a bad doctor I am for that sort of\r\n   complaint.\r\n\r\n   Yours always,\r\n\r\n   NIDDERDALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dinner-bell had rung before Silverbridge had come to an end of\r\nthinking of this new vexation, and he had not as yet made up his mind\r\nwhat he had better do for his brother. There was one thing as to\r\nwhich he was determined,--that it should not be done by him, nor,\r\nif he could prevent it, by Gerald. There should be no dealings with\r\nComfort and Criball. The Duke had succeeded, at any rate, in filling\r\nhis son\'s mind with a horror of aid of that sort. Nidderdale had\r\nsuggested that the "straightest" thing would be to go direct to the\r\nDuke. That no doubt would be straight,--and efficacious. The Duke\r\nwould not have allowed a boy of his to be a debtor to Lord Percival\r\nfor a day, let the debt have been contracted how it might. But\r\nGerald had declared against this course,--and Silverbridge himself\r\nwould have been most unwilling to adopt it. How could he have told\r\nthat story to the Duke, while there was that other infinitely more\r\nimportant story of his own, which must be told at once?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all these troubles he went down to dinner. "Lady\r\nMabel," said the Duke, "tells me that you two have been to see Sir\r\nGuy\'s look-out."\r\n\r\nShe was standing close to the Duke and whispered a word into his ear.\r\n"You said you would call me Mabel."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Silverbridge, "and I have made up my mind that Sir\r\nGuy never stayed there very long in winter. It was awfully cold."\r\n\r\n"I had furs on," said Mabel. "What a lovely spot it is, even in this\r\nweather." Then dinner was announced. She had not been cold. She could\r\nstill feel the tingling heat of her blood as she had implored him to\r\nlove her.\r\n\r\nSilverbridge felt that he must write to his brother by the first\r\npost. The communication was of a nature that would bear no delay.\r\nIf his hands had been free he would himself have gone off to Auld\r\nReikie. At last he made up his mind. The first letter he wrote was\r\nneither to Nidderdale nor to Gerald, but to Lord Percival himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR PERCIVAL,\r\n\r\n   Gerald writes me word that he has lost to you at cards\r\n   L3,400, and he wants me to get him the money. It is a\r\n   terrible nuisance, and he has been an ass. But of course\r\n   I shall stand to him for anything he wants. I haven\'t\r\n   got L3,400 in my pocket, and I don\'t know any one who\r\n   has;--that is among our set. But I send you my I.O.U. for\r\n   the amount, and will promise to get you the money in two\r\n   months. I suppose that will be sufficient, and that you\r\n   will not bother Gerald any more about it.\r\n\r\n   Yours truly,\r\n\r\n   SILVERBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he copied this letter and enclosed the copy in another which he\r\nwrote to his brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR GERALD,\r\n\r\n   What an ass you have been! But I don\'t suppose you are\r\n   worse than I was at Doncaster. I will have nothing to do\r\n   with such people as Comfort and Criball. That is the sure\r\n   way to the D----! As for telling Moreton, that is only\r\n   a polite and roundabout way of telling the governor. He\r\n   would immediately ask the governor what was to be done.\r\n   You will see what I have done. Of course I must tell the\r\n   governor before the end of February, as I cannot get the\r\n   money in any other way. But that I will do. It does seem\r\n   hard upon him. Not that the money will hurt him much; but\r\n   that he would so like to have a steady-going son.\r\n\r\n   I suppose Percival won\'t make any bother about the I.O.U.\r\n   He\'ll be a fool if he does. I wouldn\'t kick him if I were\r\n   you,--unless he says anything very bad. You would be sure\r\n   to come to grief somehow. He is a beast.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate Brother,\r\n\r\n   SILVERBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these letters that special grief was removed from his mind for\r\nawhile. Looking over the dark river of possible trouble which seemed\r\nto run between the present moment and the time at which the money\r\nmust be procured, he thought that he had driven off this calamity of\r\nGerald\'s to infinite distance. But into that dark river he must now\r\nplunge almost at once. On the next day, he managed so that there\r\nshould be no walk with Mabel. In the evening he could see that the\r\nDuke was uneasy;--but not a word was said to him. On the following\r\nmorning Lady Mabel took her departure. When she went from the door,\r\nboth the Duke and Silverbridge were there to bid her farewell. She\r\nsmiled and was as gracious as though everything had gone according\r\nto her heart\'s delight. "Dear Duke, I am so obliged to you for your\r\nkindness," she said, as she put up her cheek for him to kiss. Then\r\nshe gave her hand to Silverbridge. "Of course you will come and see\r\nme in town." And she smiled upon them all;--having courage enough to\r\nkeep down all her sufferings.\r\n\r\n"Come in here a moment, Silverbridge," said the father as they\r\nreturned into the house together. "How is it now between you and\r\nher?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\n"Bone of My Bone"\r\n\r\n\r\n"How is it now between you and her?" That was the question which the\r\nDuke put to his son as soon as he had closed the door of the study.\r\nLady Mabel had just been dismissed from the front door on her\r\njourney, and there could be no doubt as to the "her" intended. No\r\nsuch question would have been asked had not Silverbridge himself\r\ndeclared to his father his purpose of making Lady Mabel his wife.\r\nOn that subject the Duke, without such authority, would not have\r\ninterfered. But he had been consulted, had acceded, and had\r\nencouraged the idea by excessive liberality on his part. He had never\r\ndropped it out of his mind for a moment. But when he found that the\r\ngirl was leaving his house without any explanation, then he became\r\nrestless and inquisitive.\r\n\r\nThey say that perfect love casteth out fear. If it be so the love of\r\nchildren to their parents is seldom altogether perfect,--and perhaps\r\nhad better not be quite perfect. With this young man it was not that\r\nhe feared anything which his father could do to him, that he believed\r\nthat in consequence of the declaration which he had to make his\r\ncomforts and pleasures would be curtailed, or his independence\r\ndiminished. He knew his father too well to dread such punishment.\r\nBut he feared that he would make his father unhappy, and he was\r\nconscious that he had so often sinned in that way. He had stumbled so\r\nfrequently! Though in action he would so often be thoughtless,--yet\r\nhe understood perfectly the effect which had been produced on his\r\nfather\'s mind by his conduct. He had it at heart "to be good to the\r\ngovernor," to gratify that most loving of all possible friends, who,\r\nas he knew well, was always thinking of his welfare. And yet he never\r\nhad been "good to the governor";--nor had Gerald;--and to all this\r\nwas added his sister\'s determined perversity. It was thus he feared\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment, while the Duke stood with his back to the\r\nfire looking at him. "I\'m afraid that it is all over, sir," he said.\r\n\r\n"All over!"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid so."\r\n\r\n"Why is it all over? Has she refused you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir;--it isn\'t quite that." Then he paused again. It was so\r\ndifficult to begin about Isabel Boncassen.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for that," said the Duke, almost hesitating; "very sorry.\r\nYou will understand, I hope, that I should make no inquiry in such a\r\nmatter, unless I had felt myself warranted in doing so by what you\r\nhad yourself told me in London."\r\n\r\n"I understand all that."\r\n\r\n"I have been very anxious about it, and have even gone so far as\r\nto make some preparations for what I had hoped would be your early\r\nmarriage."\r\n\r\n"Preparations!" exclaimed Silverbridge, thinking of church bells,\r\nbride cake, and wedding presents.\r\n\r\n"As to the property. I am so anxious that you should enjoy all the\r\nsettled independence which can belong to an English gentleman. I\r\nnever plough or sow. I know no more of sheep and bulls than of the\r\nextinct animals of earlier ages. I would not have it so with you. I\r\nwould fain see you surrounded by those things which ought to interest\r\na nobleman in this country. Why is it all over with Lady Mabel Grex?"\r\n\r\nThe young man looked imploringly at his father, as though earnestly\r\nbegging that nothing more might be said about Mabel. "I had changed\r\nmy mind before I found out that she was really in love with me!" He\r\ncould not say that. He could not hint that he might still have Mabel\r\nif he would. The only thing for him was to tell everything about\r\nIsabel Boncassen. He felt that in doing this he must begin with\r\nhimself. "I have rather changed my mind, sir," he said, "since we\r\nwere walking together in London that night."\r\n\r\n"Have you quarrelled with Lady Mabel?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no. I am very fond of Mabel;--only not just like that."\r\n\r\n"Not just like what?"\r\n\r\n"I had better tell the whole truth at once."\r\n\r\n"Certainly tell the truth, Silverbridge. I cannot say that you are\r\nbound in duty to tell the whole truth even to your father in such a\r\nmatter."\r\n\r\n"But I mean to tell you everything. Mabel did not seem to care for me\r\nmuch--in London. And then I saw someone,--someone I liked better."\r\nThen he stopped, but as the Duke did not ask any questions he plunged\r\non. "It was Miss Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"Miss Boncassen!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Silverbridge, with a little access of decision.\r\n\r\n"The American young lady?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Do you know anything of her family?"\r\n\r\n"I think I know all about her family. It is not much in the way\r\nof--family."\r\n\r\n"You have not spoken to her about it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir;--I have settled it all with her, on condition--"\r\n\r\n"Settled it with her that she is to be your wife!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir,--on condition that you will approve."\r\n\r\n"Did you go to her, Silverbridge, with such a stipulation as that?"\r\n\r\n"It was not like that."\r\n\r\n"How was it then?"\r\n\r\n"She stipulated. She will marry me if you will consent."\r\n\r\n"It was she then who thought of my wishes and my feeling;--not you?"\r\n\r\n"I knew that I loved her. What is a man to do when he feels like\r\nthat? Of course I meant to tell you." The Duke was now looking very\r\nblack. "I thought you liked her, sir."\r\n\r\n"Liked her! I did like her. I do like her. What has that to do with\r\nit? Do you think I like none but those with whom I should think it\r\nfitting to ally myself in marriage? Is there to be no duty in such\r\nmatters, no restraint, no feeling of what is due to your own name,\r\nand to others who bear it? The lad out there who is sweeping the\r\nwalks can marry the first girl that pleases his eye if she will take\r\nhim. Perhaps his lot is the happier because he owns such liberty.\r\nHave you the same freedom?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I have,--by law."\r\n\r\n"Do you recognise no duty but what the laws impose upon you? Should\r\nyou be disposed to eat and drink in bestial excess, because the laws\r\nwould not hinder you? Should you lie and sleep all the day, the law\r\nwould say nothing! Should you neglect every duty which your position\r\nimposes on you, the law could not interfere! To such a one as you\r\nthe law can be no guide. You should so live as not to come near the\r\nlaw,--or to have the law to come near to you. From all evil against\r\nwhich the law bars you, you should be barred, at an infinite\r\ndistance, by honour, by conscience, and nobility. Does the law\r\nrequire patriotism, philanthropy, self-abnegation, public service,\r\npurity of purpose, devotion to the needs of others who have been\r\nplaced in the world below you? The law is a great thing,--because men\r\nare poor and weak, and bad. And it is great, because where it exists\r\nin its strength, no tyrant can be above it. But between you and me\r\nthere should be no mention of law as the guide of conduct. Speak to\r\nme of honour, of duty, and of nobility; and tell me what they require\r\nof you."\r\n\r\nSilverbridge listened in silence and with something of true\r\nadmiration in his heart. But he felt the strong necessity of\r\ndeclaring his own convictions on one special point here, at once,\r\nin this new crisis of the conversation. That accident in regard to\r\nthe colour of the Dean\'s lodge had stood in the way of his logical\r\nstudies,--so that he was unable to put his argument into proper\r\nshape; but there belonged to him a certain natural astuteness which\r\ntold him that he must put in his rejoinder at this particular point.\r\n"I think I am bound in honour and in duty to marry Miss Boncassen,"\r\nhe said. "And, if I understand what you mean, by nobility just as\r\nmuch."\r\n\r\n"Because you have promised."\r\n\r\n"Not only for that. I have promised and therefore I am bound. She\r\nhas--well, she has said that she loves me, and therefore of course I\r\nam bound. But it is not only that."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose a man ought to marry the woman he loves,--if he can get\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"No; no; not so; not always so. Do you think that love is a passion\r\nthat cannot be withstood?"\r\n\r\n"But here we are both of one mind, sir. When I saw how you seemed to\r\ntake to her--"\r\n\r\n"Take to her! Can I not interest myself in human beings without\r\nwishing to make them flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone? What am\r\nI to think of you? It was but the other day that all that you are\r\nnow telling me of Miss Boncassen, you were telling me of Lady Mabel\r\nGrex." Here poor Silverbridge bit his lips and shook his head, and\r\nlooked down upon the ground. This was the weak part of his case. He\r\ncould not tell his father the whole story about Mabel,--that she had\r\ncoyed his love, so that he had been justified in thinking himself\r\nfree from any claim in that direction when he had encountered the\r\ninfinitely sweeter charms of Isabel Boncassen. "You are weak as\r\nwater," said the unhappy father.\r\n\r\n"I am not weak in this."\r\n\r\n"Did you not say exactly the same about Lady Mabel?"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, so that he was driven to reply. "I found her as I\r\nthought indifferent, and then--I changed my mind."\r\n\r\n"Indifferent! What does she think about it now? Does she know of\r\nthis? How does it stand between you two at the present moment?"\r\n\r\n"She knows that I am engaged to--Miss Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"Does she approve of it?"\r\n\r\n"Why should I ask her, sir? I have not asked her."\r\n\r\n"Then why did you tell her? She could not but have spoken her mind\r\nwhen you told her. There must have been much between you when this\r\nwas talked of."\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate young man was obliged to take some time before he\r\ncould answer this appeal. He had to own that his father had some\r\njustice on his side, but at the same time he could reveal nothing of\r\nMabel\'s secret. "I told her because we were friends. I did not ask\r\nher approval; but she did disapprove. She thought that your son\r\nshould not marry an American girl without family."\r\n\r\n"Of course she would feel that."\r\n\r\n"Now I have told you what she said, and I hope you will ask me\r\nno further questions about her. I cannot make Lady Mabel my\r\nwife;--though, for the matter of that, I ought not to presume that\r\nshe would take me if I wished it. I had intended to ask you to-day to\r\nconsent to my marriage with Miss Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"I cannot give you my consent."\r\n\r\n"Then I am very unhappy."\r\n\r\n"How can I believe as to your unhappiness when you would have said\r\nthe same about Lady Mabel Grex a few weeks ago?"\r\n\r\n"Nearly eight months," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"What is the difference? It is not the time, but the disposition of\r\nthe man! I cannot give you my consent. The young lady sees it in the\r\nright light, and that will make your escape easy."\r\n\r\n"I do not want to escape."\r\n\r\n"She has indicated the cause which will separate you."\r\n\r\n"I will not be separated from her," said Silverbridge, who was\r\nbeginning to feel that he was subjugated to tyranny. If he chose to\r\nmarry Isabel, no one could have a right to hinder him.\r\n\r\n"I can only hope that you will think better of it, and that when next\r\nyou speak to me on that or any other subject you will answer me with\r\nless arrogance."\r\n\r\nThis rebuke was terrible to the son, whose mind at the present moment\r\nwas filled with two ideas, that of constancy to Isabel Boncassen, and\r\nthen of respect and affection for his father. "Indeed, sir," he said,\r\n"I am not arrogant, and if I have answered improperly I beg your\r\npardon. But my mind is made up about this, and I thought you had\r\nbetter know how it is."\r\n\r\n"I do not see that I can say anything else to you now."\r\n\r\n"I think of going to Harrington this afternoon." Then the Duke, with\r\nfurther very visible annoyance, asked where Harrington was. It was\r\nexplained that Harrington was Lord Chiltern\'s seat, Lord Chiltern\r\nbeing the Master of the Brake hounds;--that it was his son\'s purpose\r\nto remain six weeks among the Brake hounds, but that he should\r\nstay only a day or two with Lord Chiltern. Then it appeared that\r\nSilverbridge intended to put himself up at a hunting inn in the\r\nneighbourhood, and the Duke did not at all like the plan. That his\r\nson should choose to live at an inn, when the comforts of an English\r\ncountry house were open to him, was distasteful and almost offensive\r\nto the Duke. And the matter was not improved when he was made to\r\nunderstand that all this was to be done for the sake of hunting.\r\nThere had been the shooting in Scotland; then the racing,--ah, alas!\r\nyes,--the racing, and the betting at Doncaster! Then the shooting\r\nat Matching had been made to appear to be the chief reason why he\r\nhimself had been living in his own house! And now his son was going\r\naway to live at an inn in order that more time might be devoted to\r\nhunting! "Why can\'t you hunt here at home, if you must hunt?"\r\n\r\n"It is all woodland," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I thought you wanted woods. Lord Chiltern is always troubling me\r\nabout Trumpington Wood."\r\n\r\nThis breeze about the hunting enabled the son to escape without any\r\nfurther allusion to Miss Boncassen. He did escape, and proceeded to\r\nturn over in his mind all that had been said. His tale had been told.\r\nA great burden was thus taken off his shoulders. He could tell Isabel\r\nso much, and thus free himself from the suspicion of having been\r\nafraid to declare his purpose. She should know what he had done,\r\nand should be made to understand that he had been firm. He had, he\r\nthought, been very firm and gave himself some credit on that head.\r\nHis father, no doubt, had been firm too, but that he had expected.\r\nHis father had said much. All that about honour and duty had been\r\nvery good; but this was certain,--that when a young man had promised\r\na young woman he ought to keep his word. And he thought that there\r\nwere certain changes going on in the management of the world\r\nwhich his father did not quite understand. Fathers never do quite\r\nunderstand the changes which are manifest to their sons. Some years\r\nago it might have been improper that an American girl should be\r\nelevated to the rank of an English Duchess; but now all that was\r\naltered.\r\n\r\nThe Duke spent the rest of the day alone, and was not happy in his\r\nsolitude. All that Silverbridge had told him was sad to him. He\r\nhad taught himself to think that he could love Lady Mabel as an\r\naffectionate father wishes to love his son\'s wife. He had set himself\r\nto wish to like her, and had been successful. Being most anxious\r\nthat his son should marry he had prepared himself to be more than\r\nordinarily liberal,--to be in every way gracious. His children were\r\nnow everything to him, and among his children his son and heir was\r\nthe chief. From the moment in which he had heard from Silverbridge\r\nthat Lady Mabel was chosen he had given himself up to considering\r\nhow he might best promote their interests,--how he might best enable\r\nthem to live, with that dignity and splendour which he himself had\r\nunwisely despised. That the son who was to come after him should\r\nbe worthy of the place assigned to his name had been, of personal\r\nobjects, the nearest to his heart. There had been failures, but still\r\nthere had been left room for hope. The boy had been unfortunate at\r\nEton;--but how many unfortunate boys had become great men! He had\r\ndisgraced himself by his folly at college,--but, though some lads\r\nwill be men at twenty, others are then little more than children.\r\nThe fruit that ripens the soonest is seldom the best. Then had come\r\nTifto and the racing mania. Nothing could be worse than Tifto and\r\nrace-horses. But from that evil Silverbridge had seemed to be made\r\nfree by the very disgust which the vileness of the circumstance had\r\nproduced. Perhaps Tifto driving a nail into his horse\'s foot had on\r\nthe whole been serviceable. That apostasy from the political creed of\r\nthe Pallisers had been a blow,--much more felt than the loss of the\r\nseventy thousand pounds;--but even under that blow he had consoled\r\nhimself by thinking that a Conservative patriotic nobleman may serve\r\nhis country,--even as a Conservative. In the midst of this he had\r\nfelt that the surest resource for his son against evil would be in an\r\nearly marriage. If he would marry becomingly, then might everything\r\nstill be made pleasant. If his son would marry becomingly nothing\r\nwhich a father could do should be wanting to add splendour and\r\ndignity to his son\'s life.\r\n\r\nIn thinking of all this he had by no means regarded his own mode of\r\nlife with favour. He knew how jejune his life had been,--how devoid\r\nof other interests than that of the public service to which he had\r\ndevoted himself. He was thinking of this when he told his son that\r\nhe had neither ploughed and sowed or been the owner of sheep or oxen.\r\nHe often thought of this, when he heard those around him talking of\r\nthe sports, which, though he condemned them as the employments of a\r\nlife, he now regarded wistfully, hopelessly as far as he himself was\r\nconcerned, as proper recreations for a man of wealth. Silverbridge\r\nshould have it all, if he could arrange it. The one thing necessary\r\nwas a fitting wife;--and the fitting wife had been absolutely chosen\r\nby Silverbridge himself.\r\n\r\nIt may be conceived, therefore, that he was again unhappy. He\r\nhad already been driven to acknowledge that these children of\r\nhis,--thoughtless, restless, though they seemed to be,--still had a\r\nwill of their own. In all which how like they were to their mother!\r\nWith her, however, his word, though it might be resisted, had never\r\nlost its authority. When he had declared that a thing should not\r\nbe done, she had never persisted in saying that she would do it.\r\nBut with his children it was otherwise. What power had he over\r\nSilverbridge,--or for the matter of that, even over his daughter?\r\nThey had only to be firm and he knew that he must be conquered.\r\n\r\n"I thought that you liked her," Silverbridge had said to him. How\r\nutterly unconscious, thought the Duke, must the young man have\r\nbeen of all that his position required of him when he used such an\r\nargument! Liked her! He did like her. She was clever, accomplished,\r\nbeautiful, well-mannered,--as far as he knew endowed with all good\r\nqualities! Would not many an old Roman have said as much for some\r\nfavourite Greek slave,--for some freedman whom he would admit to his\r\nvery heart? But what old Roman ever dreamed of giving his daughter to\r\nthe son of a Greek bondsman! Had he done so, what would have become\r\nof the name of a Roman citizen? And was it not his duty to fortify\r\nand maintain that higher, smaller, more precious pinnacle of rank on\r\nwhich Fortune had placed him and his children?\r\n\r\nLike her! Yes! he liked her certainly. He had by no means always\r\nfound that he best liked the companionship of his own order. He had\r\nliked to feel around him the free battle of the House of Commons. He\r\nliked the power of attack and defence in carrying on which an English\r\npolitician cares nothing for rank. He liked to remember that the\r\nson of any tradesman might, by his own merits, become a peer of\r\nParliament. He would have liked to think that his son should share\r\nall these tastes with him. Yes,--he liked Isabel Boncassen. But how\r\ndifferent was that liking from a desire that she should be bone of\r\nhis bone, and flesh of his flesh!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\nThe Brake Country\r\n\r\n\r\n"What does your father mean to do about Trumpington Wood?" That was\r\nthe first word from Lord Chiltern after he had shaken hands with his\r\nguest.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it all right yet?"\r\n\r\n"All right? No! How can a wood like that be all right without a man\r\nabout the place who knows anything of the nature of a fox? In your\r\ngrandfather\'s time--"\r\n\r\n"My great-uncle you mean."\r\n\r\n"Well;--your great-uncle!--they used to trap the foxes there. There\r\nwas a fellow named Fothergill who used to come there for shooting.\r\nNow it is worse than ever. Nobody shoots there because there is\r\nnothing to shoot. There isn\'t a keeper. Every scamp is allowed to go\r\nwhere he pleases, and of course there isn\'t a fox in the whole place.\r\nMy huntsman laughs at me when I ask him to draw it." As the indignant\r\nMaster of the Brake Hounds said this the very fire flashed from his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Lady Chiltern expostulating, "Lord Silverbridge\r\nhasn\'t been in the house above half an hour."\r\n\r\n"What does that matter? When a thing has to be said it had better be\r\nsaid at once."\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn was staying at Harrington with his intimate friends\r\nthe Chilterns, as were also a certain Mr. and Mrs. Maule, both of\r\nwhom were addicted to hunting,--the lady, whose maiden name had\r\nbeen Palliser, being a cousin to Lord Silverbridge. On that day\r\nalso a certain Mr. and Mrs. Spooner dined at Harrington. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Spooner were both very much given to hunting, as seemed to\r\nbe necessarily the case with everybody admitted to that house. Mr.\r\nSpooner was a gentleman who might be on the wrong side of fifty, with\r\na red nose, very vigorous, and submissive in regard to all things\r\nbut port-wine. His wife was perhaps something more than half his age,\r\na stout, hard-riding, handsome woman. She had been the penniless\r\ndaughter of a retired officer,--but yet had managed to ride on\r\nwhatever animal any one would lend her. Then Mr. Spooner, who had for\r\nmany years been part and parcel of the Brake hunt, and who was much\r\nin want of a wife, had, luckily for her, cast his eyes upon Miss\r\nLeatherside. It was thought that upon the whole she made him a good\r\nwife. She hunted four days a week, and he could afford to keep horses\r\nfor her. She never flirted, and wanted no one to open gates. Tom\r\nSpooner himself was not always so forward as he used to be; but his\r\nwife was always there and would tell him all that he did not see\r\nhimself. And she was a good housewife, taking care that nothing\r\nshould be spent lavishly, except upon the stable. Of him, too, and of\r\nhis health, she was careful, never scrupling to say a word in season\r\nwhen he was likely to hurt himself, either among the fences or among\r\nthe decanters. "You ain\'t so young as you were, Tom. Don\'t think of\r\ndoing it." This she would say to him with a loud voice when she would\r\nfind him pausing at a fence. Then she would hop over herself and he\r\nwould go round. She was "quite a providence to him," as her mother,\r\nold Mrs. Leatherside, would say.\r\n\r\nShe was hardly the woman that one would have expected to meet as\r\na friend in the drawing-room of Lady Chiltern. Lord Chiltern was\r\nperhaps a little rough, but Lady Chiltern was all that a mother, a\r\nwife, and a lady ought to be. She probably felt that some little\r\napology ought to be made for Mrs. Spooner. "I hope you like hunting,"\r\nshe said to Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Best of all things," said he, enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n"Because you know this is Castle Nimrod, in which nothing is allowed\r\nto interfere with the one great business of life."\r\n\r\n"It\'s like that; is it?"\r\n\r\n"Quite like that. Lord Chiltern has taken up hunting as his duty in\r\nlife, and he does it with his might and main. Not to have a good day\r\nis a misery to him;--not for himself but because he feels that he is\r\nresponsible. We had one blank day last year, and I thought that he\r\nnever would recover it. It was that unfortunate Trumpington Wood."\r\n\r\n"How he will hate me."\r\n\r\n"Not if you will praise the hounds judiciously. And then there is\r\na Mr. Spooner coming here to-night. He is the first-lieutenant. He\r\nunderstands all about the foxes, and all about the farmers. He has\r\ngot a wife."\r\n\r\n"Does she understand anything?"\r\n\r\n"She understands him. She is coming too. They have not been married\r\nlong, and he never goes anywhere without her."\r\n\r\n"Does she ride?"\r\n\r\n"Well; yes. I never go out myself now because I have so much of it\r\nall at home. But I fancy she does ride a good deal. She will talk\r\nhunting too. If Chiltern were to leave the country I think they ought\r\nto make her master. Perhaps you\'ll think her rather odd; but really\r\nshe is a very good woman."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I shall like her."\r\n\r\n"I hope you will. You know Mr. Finn. He is here. He and my husband\r\nare very old friends. And Adelaide Maule is your cousin. She hunts\r\ntoo. And so does Mr. Maule,--only not quite so energetically. I think\r\nthat is all we shall have."\r\n\r\nImmediately after that all the guests came in at once, and a\r\ndiscussion was heard as they were passing through the hall.\r\n"No;--that wasn\'t it," said Mrs. Spooner loudly. "I don\'t care what\r\nDick said." Dick Rabbit was the first whip, and seemed to have been\r\nmuch exercised with the matter now under dispute. "The fox never went\r\ninto Grobby Gorse at all. I was there and saw Sappho give him a line\r\ndown the bank."\r\n\r\n"I think he must have gone into the gorse, my dear," said her\r\nhusband. "The earth was open, you know."\r\n\r\n"I tell you she didn\'t. You weren\'t there, and you can\'t know. I\'m\r\nsure it was a vixen by her running. We ought to have killed that\r\nfox, my Lord." Then Mrs. Spooner made her obeisance to her hostess.\r\nPerhaps she was rather slow in doing this, but the greatness of the\r\nsubject had been the cause. These are matters so important, that the\r\nordinary civilities of the world should not stand in their way.\r\n\r\n"What do you say, Chiltern?" asked the husband.\r\n\r\n"I say that Mrs. Spooner isn\'t very often wrong, and that Dick Rabbit\r\nisn\'t very often right about a fox."\r\n\r\n"It was a pretty run," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Just thirty-four minutes," said Mr. Spooner.\r\n\r\n"Thirty-two up to Grobby Gorse," asserted Mrs. Spooner. "The hounds\r\nnever hunted a yard after that. Dick hurried them into the gorse, and\r\nthe old hound wouldn\'t stick to his line when she found that no one\r\nbelieved her."\r\n\r\nThis was on a Monday evening, and the Brake hounds went out generally\r\nfive days a week. "You\'ll hunt to-morrow, I suppose?" Lady Chiltern\r\nsaid to Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"You must hunt to-morrow. Indeed there is nothing else to do.\r\nChiltern has taken such a dislike to shooting-men, that he won\'t\r\nshoot pheasants himself. We don\'t hunt on Wednesdays or Sundays, and\r\nthen everybody lies in bed. Here is Mr. Maule, he lies in bed on\r\nother mornings as well, and spends the rest of his day riding about\r\nthe country looking for the hounds."\r\n\r\n"Does he ever find them?"\r\n\r\n"What did become of you all to-day?" said Mr. Maule, as he took his\r\nplace at the dinner-table. "You can\'t have drawn any of the coverts\r\nregularly."\r\n\r\n"Then we found our foxes without drawing them," said the Master.\r\n\r\n"We chopped one at Bromleys," said Mr. Spooner.\r\n\r\n"I went there."\r\n\r\n"Then you ought to have known better," said Mrs. Spooner. "When a man\r\nloses the hounds in that country, he ought to go direct to Brackett\'s\r\nWood. If you had come on to Brackett\'s, you\'d have seen as good a\r\nthirty-two minutes as ever you wished to ride." When the ladies went\r\nout of the room Mrs. Spooner gave a parting word of advice to her\r\nhusband, and to the host. "Now, Tom, don\'t you drink port-wine. Lord\r\nChiltern, look after him, and don\'t let him have port-wine."\r\n\r\nThen there began an altogether different phase of hunting\r\nconversation. As long as the ladies were there it was all very well\r\nto talk of hunting as an amusement; good sport, a thirty minutes\r\nor so, the delight of having a friend in a ditch, or the glory of\r\na stiff-built rail were fitting subjects for a lighter hour. But\r\nnow the business of the night was to begin. The difficulties, the\r\nenmities, the precautions, the resolutions, the resources of the\r\nBrake hunt were to be discussed. And from thence the conversation of\r\nthese devotees strayed away to the perils at large to which hunting\r\nin these modern days is subjected;--not the perils of broken necks\r\nand crushed ribs, which can be reduced to an average, and so an end\r\nmade of that small matter; but the perils from outsiders, the perils\r\nfrom new-fangled prejudices, the perils from more modern sports, the\r\nperils from over-cultivation, the perils from extended population,\r\nthe perils from increasing railroads, the perils from literary\r\nignorances, the perils from intruding cads, the perils from\r\nindifferent magnates,--the Duke of Omnium, for instance;--and that\r\nperil of perils, the peril of decrease of funds and increase of\r\nexpenditure! The jaunty gentleman who puts on his dainty breeches,\r\nand his pair of boots, and on his single horse rides out on a\r\npleasant morning to some neighbouring meet, thinking himself a\r\nsportsman, has but a faint idea of the troubles which a few staunch\r\nworkmen endure in order that he may not be made to think that his\r\nboots, and his breeches, and his horse, have been in vain.\r\n\r\nA word or two further was at first said about that unfortunate wood\r\nfor which Silverbridge at the present felt himself responsible. Finn\r\nsaid that he was sure the Duke would look to it, if Silverbridge\r\nwould mention it. Chiltern simply groaned. Silverbridge said nothing,\r\nremembering how many troubles he had on hand at this moment. Then\r\nby degrees their solicitude worked itself round to the cares of a\r\nneighbouring hunt. The A. R. U. had lost their Master. One Captain\r\nGlomax was going, and the county had been driven to the necessity\r\nof advertising for a successor. "When hunting comes to that," said\r\nLord Chiltern, "one begins to think that it is in a bad way." It may\r\nalways be observed that when hunting-men speak seriously of their\r\nsport, they speak despondingly. Everything is going wrong. Perhaps\r\nthe same thing may be remarked in other pursuits. Farmers are\r\ngenerally on the verge of ruin. Trade is always bad. The Church is in\r\ndanger. The House of Lords isn\'t worth a dozen years\' purchase. The\r\nthrone totters.\r\n\r\n"An itinerant Master with a carpet-bag never can carry on a country,"\r\nsaid Mr. Spooner.\r\n\r\n"You ought really to have a gentleman of property in the county,"\r\nsaid Lord Chiltern, in a self-deprecating tone. His father\'s acres\r\nlay elsewhere.\r\n\r\n"It should be someone who has a real stake in the country," replied\r\nMr. Spooner,--"whom the farmers can respect. Glomax understood\r\nhunting no doubt, but the farmers didn\'t care for him. If you don\'t\r\nhave the farmers with you you can\'t have hunting." Then he filled a\r\nglass of port.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t approve of Glomax, what do you think of a man like\r\nMajor Tifto?" asked Mr. Maule.\r\n\r\n"That was in the Runnymede," said Spooner contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"Who is Major Tifto?" asked Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"He is the man," said Silverbridge, boldly, "who owned Prime Minister\r\nwith me, when he didn\'t win the Leger last September."\r\n\r\n"There was a deuce of a row," said Maule. Then Mr. Spooner, who read\r\nhis "Bell\'s Life" and "Field" very religiously, and who never missed\r\nan article in "Bayley\'s," proceeded to give them an account of\r\neverything that had taken place in the Runnymede Hunt. It mattered\r\nbut little that he was wrong in all his details. Narrations always\r\nare. The result to which he came was nearly right when he declared\r\nthat the Major had been turned off, that a committee had been\r\nappointed, and that Messrs. Topps and Jawstock had been threatened\r\nwith a lawsuit.\r\n\r\n"That comes," said Lord Chiltern solemnly, "of employing men like\r\nMajor Tifto in places for which they are radically unfit. I dare say\r\nMajor Tifto knew how to handle a pack of hounds,--perhaps almost as\r\nwell as my huntsman, Fowler. But I don\'t think a county would get on\r\nvery well which appointed Fowler Master of Hounds. He is an honest\r\nman, and therefore would be better than Tifto. But--it would not do.\r\nIt is a position in which a man should at any rate be a gentleman. If\r\nhe be not, all those who should be concerned in maintaining the hunt\r\nwill turn their backs upon him. When I take my hounds over this man\'s\r\nground, and that man\'s ground, certainly without doing him any good,\r\nI have to think of a great many things. I have to understand that\r\nthose whom I cannot compensate by money, I have to compensate by\r\ncourtesy. When I shake hands with a farmer and express my obligation\r\nto him because he does not lock his gates, he is gratified. I don\'t\r\nthink any decent farmer would care much for shaking hands with Major\r\nTifto. If we fall into that kind of thing there must soon be an end\r\nof hunting. Major Tiftos are cheap no doubt; but in hunting, as in\r\nmost other things, cheap and nasty go together. If men don\'t choose\r\nto put their hands in their pockets they had better say so, and give\r\nthe thing up altogether. If you won\'t take any more wine, we\'ll go to\r\nthe ladies. Silverbridge, the trap will start from the door to-morrow\r\nmorning precisely at 9.30 A.M. Grantingham Cross is fourteen miles."\r\nThen they all left their chairs,--but as they did so Mr. Spooner\r\nfinished the bottle of port-wine.\r\n\r\n"I never heard Chiltern speak so much like a book before," said\r\nSpooner to his wife, as she drove him home that night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning everybody was ready for a start at half-past nine,\r\nexcept Mr. Maule,--as to whom his wife declared that she had left him\r\nin bed when she came down to breakfast. "He can never get there if\r\nwe don\'t take him," said Lord Chiltern, who was in truth the most\r\ngood-natured man in the world. Five minutes were allowed him, and\r\nthen he came down with a large sandwich in one hand and a button-hook\r\nin the other, with which he was prepared to complete his toilet.\r\n"What the deuce makes you always in such a hurry?" were the first\r\nwords he spoke as Lord Chiltern got on the box. The Master knew him\r\ntoo well to argue the point. "Well;--he always is in a hurry," said\r\nthe sinner, when his wife accused him of ingratitude.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Spooner?" asked the Master when he saw Mrs. Spooner without\r\nher husband at the meet.\r\n\r\n"I knew how it would be when I saw the port-wine," she said in a\r\nwhisper that could be heard all round. "He has got it this time\r\nsharp,--in his great toe. We shan\'t find at Grantingham. They were\r\ncutting wood there last week. If I were you, my Lord, I\'d go away to\r\nthe Spinnies at once."\r\n\r\n"I must draw the country regularly," muttered the Master.\r\n\r\nThe country was drawn regularly, but in vain till about two o\'clock.\r\nNot only was there no fox at Grantingham Wood, but none even at\r\nthe Spinnies. And at two, Fowler, with an anxious face, held a\r\nconsultation with his more anxious Master. Trumpington Wood lay on\r\ntheir right, and that no doubt would have been the proper draw. "I\r\nsuppose we must try it," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\nOld Fowler looked very sour. "You might as well look for a fox under\r\nmy wife\'s bed, my Lord."\r\n\r\n"I dare say we should find one there," said one of the wags of the\r\nhunt. Fowler shook his head, feeling that this was no time for\r\njoking.\r\n\r\n"It ought to be drawn," said Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"Of course you know best, my Lord. I wouldn\'t touch it,--never no\r\nmore. Let \'em all know what the Duke\'s Wood is."\r\n\r\n"This is Lord Silverbridge, the Duke\'s son," said Chiltern, laughing.\r\n\r\n"I beg your Lordship\'s pardon," said Fowler, taking off his cap.\r\n"We shall have a good time coming, some day. Let me trot \'em off to\r\nMichaelmas Daisies, my Lord. I\'ll be there in thirty minutes." In the\r\nneighbouring parish of St. Michael de Dezier there was a favourite\r\nlittle gorse which among hunting-men had acquired this unreasonable\r\nname. After a little consideration the Master yielded, and away they\r\ntrotted.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll cross the ford, Fowler?" asked Mrs. Spooner.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, ma\'am; we couldn\'t draw the Daisies this afternoon if we\r\ndidn\'t."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be up to the horses\' bellies."\r\n\r\n"Those who don\'t like it can go round."\r\n\r\n"They\'d never be there in time, Fowler."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a many, ma\'am, as don\'t mind that. You won\'t be one to stay\r\nbehind." The water was up to the horses\' bellies, but, nevertheless,\r\nMrs. Spooner was at the gorse side when the Daisies were drawn.\r\n\r\nThey found and were away in a minute. It was all done so quickly that\r\nFowler, who had alone gone into the gorse, had hardly time to get out\r\nwith his hounds. The fox ran right back, as though he were making\r\nfor the Duke\'s pernicious wood. In the first field or two there was\r\na succession of gates, and there was not much to do in the way of\r\njumping. Then the fox, keeping straight ahead, deviated from the line\r\nby which they had come, making for the brook by a more direct course.\r\nThe ruck of the horsemen, understanding the matter very well, left\r\nthe hounds, and went to the right, riding for the ford. The ford was\r\nof such a nature that but one horse could pass it at a time, and that\r\none had to scramble through deep mud. "There\'ll be the devil to pay\r\nthere," said Lord Chiltern, going straight with his hounds. Phineas\r\nFinn and Dick Rabbit were close after him. Old Fowler had craftily\r\ngone to the ford; but Mrs. Spooner, who did not intend to be shaken\r\noff, followed the Master, and close with her was Lord Silverbridge.\r\n"Lord Chiltern hasn\'t got it right," she said. "He can\'t do it among\r\nthese bushes." As she spoke the Master put his horse at the bushes\r\nand then--disappeared. The lady had been right. There was no ground\r\nat that spot to take off from, and the bushes had impeded him. Lord\r\nChiltern got over, but his horse was in the water. Dick Rabbit and\r\npoor Phineas Finn were stopped in their course by the necessity of\r\nhelping the Master in his trouble.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Spooner, the judicious Mrs. Spooner, rode at the stream\r\nwhere it was, indeed, a little wider, but at a place in which the\r\nhorse could see what he was about, and where he could jump from and\r\nto firm ground. Lord Silverbridge followed her gallantly. They both\r\njumped the brook well, and then were together. "You\'ll beat me in\r\npace," said the lady as he rode alongside of her. "Take the fence\r\nahead straight, and then turn sharp to your right." With all her\r\nfaults Mrs. Spooner was a thorough sportsman.\r\n\r\nHe did take the fence ahead,--or rather tried to do so. It was a\r\nbank and a double ditch,--not very great in itself, but requiring a\r\nhorse to land on the top and go off with a second spring. Our young\r\nfriend\'s nag, not quite understanding the nature of the impediment,\r\nendeavoured to "swallow it whole," as hard-riding men say, and came\r\ndown in the further ditch. Silverbridge came down on his head, but\r\nthe horse pursued his course,--across a heavily-ploughed field.\r\n\r\nThis was very disagreeable. He was not in the least hurt, but it\r\nbecame his duty to run after his horse. A very few furrows of that\r\nwork suffice to make a man think that hunting altogether is a\r\n"beastly sort of thing." Mrs. Spooner\'s horse, who had shown himself\r\nto be a little less quick of foot than his own, had known all about\r\nthe bank and the double ditch, and had, apparently of his own accord,\r\nturned down to the right, either seeing or hearing the hounds, and\r\nknowing that the ploughed ground was to be avoided. But his rider\r\nsoon changed his course. She went straight after the riderless horse,\r\nand when Silverbridge had reduced himself to utter speechlessness by\r\nhis exertions, brought him back his steed.\r\n\r\n"I am,--I am, I am--so sorry," he struggled to say,--and then as she\r\nheld his horse for him he struggled up into the saddle.\r\n\r\n"Keep down this furrow," said Mrs. Spooner, "and we shall be with\r\nthem in the second field. There\'s nobody near them yet."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII\r\n\r\n"I\'ve Seen \'Em Like That Before"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Silverbridge stayed only a few days at Harrington,\r\nhaving promised Tregear to entertain him at The Baldfaced Stag. It\r\nwas here that his horses were standing, and he now intended, by\r\nlimiting himself to one horse a day, to mount his friend for a\r\ncouple of weeks. It was settled at last that Tregear should ride his\r\nfriend\'s horse one day, hire the next, and so on. "I wonder what\r\nyou\'ll think of Mrs. Spooner?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Why should I think anything of her?"\r\n\r\n"Because I doubt whether you ever saw such a woman before. She does\r\nnothing but hunt."\r\n\r\n"Then I certainly shan\'t want to see her again."\r\n\r\n"And she talks as I never heard a lady talk before."\r\n\r\n"Then I don\'t care if I never see her at all."\r\n\r\n"But she is the most plucky and most good-natured human being I ever\r\nsaw in my life. After all, hunting is very good fun."\r\n\r\n"Very; if you don\'t do it so often as to be sick of it."\r\n\r\n"Long as I have known you I don\'t think I ever saw you ride yet."\r\n\r\n"We used to have hunting down in Cornwall, and thought we did it\r\npretty well. And I have ridden in South Wales, which I can assure you\r\nisn\'t an easy thing to do. But you mustn\'t expect much from me."\r\n\r\nThey were both out the Monday and Tuesday in that week, and then\r\nagain on the Thursday without anything special in the way of sport.\r\nLord Chiltern, who had found Silverbridge to be a young man after\r\nhis own heart, was anxious that he should come back to Harrington\r\nand bring Tregear with him. But to this Tregear would not assent,\r\nalleging that he should feel himself to be a burden both to Lord and\r\nLady Chiltern. On the Friday Tregear did not go out, saying that he\r\nwould avoid the expense, and on that day there was a good run. "It is\r\nalways the way," said Silverbridge. "If you miss a day, it is sure to\r\nbe the best thing of the season. An hour and a quarter with hardly\r\nanything you could call a check! It is the only very good thing I\r\nhave seen since I have been here. Mrs. Spooner was with them all\r\nthrough."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose you were with Mrs. Spooner."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t far off. I wish you had been there."\r\n\r\nOn the next day the meet was at the kennels, close to Harrington,\r\nand Silverbridge drove his friend over in a gig. The Master and Lady\r\nChiltern, Spooner and Mrs. Spooner, Maule and Mrs. Maule, Phineas\r\nFinn, and a host of others condoled with the unfortunate young man\r\nbecause he had not seen the good thing yesterday. "We\'ve had it a\r\nlittle faster once or twice," said Mrs. Spooner with deliberation,\r\n"but never for so long. Then it was straight as a line, and a real\r\nopen kill. No changing, you know. We did go through the Daisies,\r\nbut I\'ll swear to its being the same fox." All of which set Tregear\r\nwondering. How could she swear to her fox? And if they had changed,\r\nwhat did it matter? And if it had been a little crooked, why would it\r\nhave been less enjoyable? And was she really so exact a judge of pace\r\nas she pretended to be? "I\'m afraid we shan\'t have anything like that\r\nto-day," she continued. "The wind\'s in the west, and I never do like\r\na westerly wind."\r\n\r\n"A little to the north," said her husband, looking round the compass.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said the lady, "you never know where the wind comes from.\r\nNow don\'t you think of taking off your comforter. I won\'t have it."\r\n\r\nTregear was riding his friend\'s favourite hunter, a thoroughbred bay\r\nhorse, very much more than up to his rider\'s weight, and supposed\r\nto be peculiarly good at timber, water, or any well-defined kind of\r\nfence, however high or however broad. They found at a covert near the\r\nkennels, and killed their fox after a burst of a few minutes. They\r\nfound again, and having lost their fox, all declared that there was\r\nnot a yard of scent. "I always know what a west wind means," said\r\nMrs. Spooner.\r\n\r\nThen they lunched, and smoked, and trotted about with an apparent\r\nacknowledgement that there wasn\'t much to be done. It was not right\r\nthat they should expect much after so good a thing as they had had\r\nyesterday. At half-past two Mr. Spooner had been sent home by his\r\nProvidence, and Mrs. Spooner was calculating that she would be\r\nable to ride her horse again on the Tuesday, when on a sudden the\r\nhounds were on a fox. It turned out afterwards that Dick Rabbit had\r\nabsolutely ridden him up among the stubble, and that the hounds had\r\nnearly killed him before he had gone a yard. But the astute animal,\r\nmaking the best use of his legs till he could get the advantage of\r\nthe first ditch, ran, and crept, and jumped absolutely through the\r\npack. Then there was shouting, and yelling, and riding. The men who\r\nwere idly smoking threw away their cigars. Those who were loitering\r\nat a distance lost their chance. But the real sportsmen, always on\r\nthe alert, always thinking of the business in hand, always mindful\r\nthat there may be at any moment a fox just before the hounds, had\r\na glorious opportunity of getting "well away." Among these no one\r\nwas more intent, or, when the moment came, "better away," than Mrs.\r\nSpooner.\r\n\r\nSilverbridge had been talking to her and had the full advantage of\r\nher care. Tregear was riding behind with Lord Chiltern, who had been\r\npressing him to come with his friend to Harrington. As soon as the\r\nshouting was heard Chiltern was off like a rocket. It was not only\r\nthat he was anxious to "get well away," but that a sense of duty\r\ncompelled him to see how the thing was being done. Old Fowler\r\ncertainly was a little slow, and Dick Rabbit, with the true\r\nbloody-minded instinct of a whip, was a little apt to bustle a fox\r\nback into covert. And then, when a run commences with a fast rush,\r\nriders are apt to over-ride the hounds, and then the hounds will\r\nover-run the fox. All of which has to be seen to by a Master who\r\nknows his business.\r\n\r\nTregear followed, and being mounted on a fast horse was soon as\r\nforward as a judicious rider would desire. "Now, Runks, don\'t you\r\npress on and spoil it all," said Mrs. Spooner to the hard-riding,\r\nobjectionable son of old Runks the vet from Rufford. But young Runks\r\ndid press on till the Master spoke a word. The word shall not be\r\nrepeated, but it was efficacious.\r\n\r\nAt that moment there had been a check,--as there is generally after a\r\nshort spurt, when fox, hounds, and horsemen get off together, and not\r\nalways in the order in which they have been placed here. There is too\r\nmuch bustle, and the pack becomes disconcerted. But it enabled Fowler\r\nto get up, and by dint of growling at the men and conciliating his\r\nhounds, he soon picked up the scent. "If they\'d all stand still\r\nfor two minutes and be ---- to them," he muttered aloud to himself,\r\n"they\'d \'ave some\'at to ride arter. They might go then, and there\'s\r\nsome of \'em \'d soon be nowhere."\r\n\r\nBut in spite of Fowler\'s denunciations there was, of course, another\r\nrush. Runks had slunk away, but by making a little distance was now\r\nagain ahead of the hounds. And unfortunately there was half-a-dozen\r\nwith him. Lord Chiltern was very wrath. "When he\'s like that," said\r\nMrs. Spooner to Tregear, "it\'s always well to give him a wide berth."\r\nBut as the hounds were now running fast it was necessary that even\r\nin taking this precaution due regard should be had to the fox\'s line.\r\n"He\'s back for Harrington bushes," said Mrs. Spooner. And as she\r\nsaid so, she rode at a bank, with a rail at the top of it perhaps a\r\nfoot-and-a-half high, with a deep drop into the field beyond. It was\r\nnot a very nice place, but it was apparently the only available spot\r\nin the fence. She seemed to know it well, for as she got close to it\r\nshe brought her horse almost to a stand and so took it. The horse\r\ncleared the rail, seemed just to touch the bank on the other side,\r\nwhile she threw herself back almost on to his crupper, and so came\r\ndown with perfect ease. But she, knowing that it would not be easy to\r\nall horses, paused a moment to see what would happen.\r\n\r\nTregear was next to her and was intending to "fly" the fence. But\r\nwhen he saw Mrs. Spooner pull her horse and pause, he also had to\r\npull his horse. This he did so as to enable her to take her leap\r\nwithout danger or encumbrance from him, but hardly so as to bring\r\nhis horse to the bank in the same way. It may be doubted whether the\r\nanimal he was riding would have known enough and been quiet enough\r\nto have performed the acrobatic manoeuvre which had carried Mrs.\r\nSpooner so pleasantly over the peril. He had some idea of this, for\r\nthe thought occurred to him that he would turn and ride fast at the\r\njump. But before he could turn he saw that Silverbridge was pressing\r\non him. It was thus his only resource to do as Mrs. Spooner had\r\ndone. He was too close to the rail, but still he tried it. The horse\r\nattempted to jump, caught his foot against the bar, and of course\r\nwent over head-foremost. This probably would have been nothing, had\r\nnot Silverbridge with his rushing beast been immediately after them.\r\nWhen the young lord saw that his friend was down it was too late\r\nfor him to stop his course. His horse was determined to have the\r\nfence,--and did have it. He touched nothing, and would have skimmed\r\nin glory over the next field had he not come right down on Tregear\r\nand Tregear\'s steed. There they were, four of them, two men and two\r\nhorses in one confused heap.\r\n\r\nThe first person with them was Mrs. Spooner, who was off her horse in\r\na minute. And Silverbridge too was very soon on his legs. He at any\r\nrate was unhurt, and the two horses were up before Mrs. Spooner was\r\nout of her saddle. But Tregear did not move. "What are we to do?"\r\nsaid Lord Silverbridge, kneeling down over his friend. "Oh, Mrs.\r\nSpooner, what are we to do?"\r\n\r\nThe hunt had passed on and no one else was immediately with them. But\r\nat this moment Dick Rabbit, who had been left behind to bring up his\r\nhounds, appeared above the bank. "Leave your horse and come down,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Spooner. "Here is a gentleman who has hurt himself." Dick\r\nwouldn\'t leave his horse, but was soon on the scene, having found his\r\nway through another part of the fence.\r\n\r\n"No; he ain\'t dead," said Dick--"I\'ve seen \'em like that before, and\r\nthey wurn\'t dead. But he\'s had a hawful squeege." Then he passed his\r\nhand over the man\'s neck and chest. "There\'s a lot of \'em is broke,"\r\nsaid he. "We must get him into farmer Tooby\'s."\r\n\r\nAfter awhile he was got into farmer Tooby\'s, when that surgeon came\r\nwho is always in attendance on a hunting-field. The surgeon declared\r\nthat he had broken his collar-bone, two of his ribs, and his left\r\narm. And then one of the animals had struck him on the chest as he\r\nraised himself. A little brandy was poured down his throat, but even\r\nunder that operation he gave no sign of life. "No, missis, he aren\'t\r\ndead," said Dick to Mrs. Tooby; "no more he won\'t die this bout; but\r\nhe\'s got it very nasty."\r\n\r\nThat night Silverbridge was sitting by his friend\'s bedside at ten\r\no\'clock in Lord Chiltern\'s house. Tregear had spoken a few words, and\r\nthe bones had been set. But the doctor had not felt himself justified\r\nin speaking with that assurance which Dick had expressed. The man\'s\r\nwhole body had been bruised by the horse which had fallen on him. The\r\nagony of Silverbridge was extreme, for he knew that it had been his\r\ndoing. "You were a little too close," Mrs. Spooner had said to him,\r\n"but nobody saw it and we\'ll hold our tongues." Silverbridge however\r\nwould not hold his tongue. He told everybody how it had happened,\r\nhow he had been unable to stop his horse, how he had jumped upon his\r\nfriend, and perhaps killed him. "I don\'t know what I am to do. I am\r\nso miserable," he said to Lady Chiltern with the tears running down\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nThe two remained at Harrington and their luggage was brought over\r\nfrom The Baldfaced Stag. The accident had happened on a Saturday.\r\nOn the Sunday there was no comfort. On the Monday the patient\'s\r\nrecollection and mind were re-established, and the doctor thought\r\nthat perhaps, with great care, his constitution would pull him\r\nthrough. On that day the consternation at Harrington was so great\r\nthat Mrs. Spooner would not go to the meet. She came over from Spoon\r\nHall, and spent a considerable part of the day in the sick man\'s\r\nroom. "It\'s sure to come right if it\'s above the vitals," she said,\r\nexpressing an opinion which had come from much experience. "That is,"\r\nshe added, "unless the neck\'s broke. When poor old Jack Stubbs drove\r\nhis head into his cap and dislocated his wertebury, of course it was\r\nall up with him." The patient heard this and was seen to smile.\r\n\r\nOn the Tuesday there arose the question of family communication. As\r\nthe accident would make its way into the papers a message had been\r\nsent to Polwenning to say that various bones had been broken, but\r\nthat the patient was upon the whole doing well. Then there had been\r\ndifferent messages backwards and forwards, in all of which there\r\nhad been an attempt to comfort old Mrs. Tregear. But on the Tuesday\r\nletters were written. Silverbridge, sitting in his friend\'s room,\r\nsent a long account of the accident to Mrs. Tregear, giving a list of\r\nthe injuries done.\r\n\r\n"Your sister," whispered the poor fellow from his pillow.\r\n\r\n"Yes,--yes;--yes, I will."\r\n\r\n"And Mabel Grex." Silverbridge nodded assent and again went to the\r\nwriting-table. He did write to his sister, and in plain words told\r\nher everything. "The doctor says he is not now in danger." Then he\r\nadded a postscript. "As long as I am here I will let you know how he\r\nis."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV\r\n\r\n"I Believe Him to Be a Worthy Young Man"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary and Mrs. Finn were alone when the tidings came from\r\nSilverbridge. The Duke had been absent, having gone to spend an\r\nunpleasant week in Barsetshire. Mary had taken the opportunity of his\r\nabsence to discuss her own prospects at full length. "My dear," said\r\nMrs. Finn, "I will not express an opinion. How can I after all that\r\nhas passed? I have told the Duke the same. I cannot be heart and hand\r\nwith either without being false to the other." But still Lady Mary\r\ncontinued to talk about Tregear.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think papa has a right to treat me in this way," she said.\r\n"He wouldn\'t be allowed to kill me, and this is killing me."\r\n\r\n"While there is life there is hope," said Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"Yes; while there is life there is hope. But one doesn\'t want to grow\r\nold first."\r\n\r\n"There is no danger of that yet, Mary."\r\n\r\n"I feel very old. What is the use of life without something to make\r\nit sweet? I am not even allowed to hear anything that he is doing. If\r\nhe were to ask me, I think I would go away with him to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"He would not be foolish enough for that."\r\n\r\n"Because he does not suffer as I do. He has his borough, and his\r\npublic life, and a hundred things to think of. I have got nothing but\r\nhim. I know he is true;--quite as true as I am. But it is I that have\r\nthe suffering in all this. A man can never be like a girl. Papa ought\r\nnot to make me suffer like this."\r\n\r\nThat took place on the Monday. On the Tuesday Mrs. Finn received\r\na letter from her husband giving his account of the accident. "As\r\nfar as I can learn," he said, "Silverbridge will write about it\r\nto-morrow." Then he went on to give a by no means good account of\r\nthe state of the patient. The doctor had declared him to be out of\r\nimmediate danger, and had set the broken bones. As tidings would be\r\nsent on the next day she had better say nothing about the accident\r\nto Lady Mary. This letter reached Matching on Tuesday and made the\r\nposition of Mrs. Finn very disagreeable. She was bound to carry\r\nherself as though nothing was amiss, knowing, as she did so, the\r\ncondition of Mary\'s lover.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of that day Lady Mary was more lively than usual,\r\nthough her liveliness was hardly of a happy nature. "I don\'t know\r\nwhat papa can expect. I\'ve heard him say a hundred times that to be\r\nin Parliament is the highest place a gentleman can fill, and now\r\nFrank is in Parliament." Mrs. Finn looked at her with beseeching\r\neyes, as though begging her not to speak of Tregear. "And then to\r\nthink of their having that Lord Popplecourt there! I shall always\r\nhate Lady Cantrip, for it was her place. That she should have thought\r\nit possible! Lord Popplecourt! Such a creature! Hyperion to a satyr.\r\nIsn\'t it true? Oh, that papa should have thought it possible!" Then\r\nshe got up, and walked about the room, beating her hands together.\r\nAll this time Mrs. Finn knew that Tregear was lying at Harrington\r\nwith half his bones broken, and in danger of his life!\r\n\r\nOn the next morning Lady Mary received her letters. There were two\r\nlying before her plate when she came into breakfast, one from her\r\nfather and the other from Silverbridge. She read that from the\r\nDuke first while Mrs. Finn was watching her. "Papa will be home on\r\nSaturday," she said. "He declares that the people in the borough\r\nare quite delighted with Silverbridge for a member. And he is quite\r\njocose. \'They used to be delighted with me once,\' he says, \'but I\r\nsuppose everybody changes.\'" Then she began to pour out the tea\r\nbefore she opened her brother\'s letter. Mrs. Finn\'s eyes were still\r\non her anxiously. "I wonder what Silverbridge has got to say about\r\nthe Brake Hunt." Then she opened her letter.\r\n\r\n"Oh;--oh!" she exclaimed,--"Frank has killed himself."\r\n\r\n"Killed himself! Not that. It is not so bad as that."\r\n\r\n"You had heard it before?"\r\n\r\n"How is he, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, heavens! I cannot read it. Do you read it. Tell me all. Tell me\r\nthe truth. What am I to do? Where shall I go?" Then she threw up her\r\nhands, and with a loud scream fell on her knees with her head upon\r\nthe chair. In the next moment Mrs. Finn was down beside her on the\r\nfloor. "Read it; why do you not read it? If you will not read it,\r\ngive it to me."\r\n\r\nMrs. Finn did read the letter, which was very short, but still giving\r\nby no means an unfavourable account of the patient. "I am sorry\r\nto say he has broken ever so many bones, and we were very much\r\nfrightened about him." Then the writer went into details, from which\r\na reader who did not read the words carefully might well imagine that\r\nthe man\'s life was still in danger.\r\n\r\nMrs. Finn did read it all, and did her best to comfort her friend.\r\n"It has been a bad accident," she said, "but it is clear that he is\r\ngetting better. Men do so often break their bones, and then seem to\r\nthink nothing of it afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Silverbridge says it was his fault. What does he mean?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose he was riding too close to Mr. Tregear, and that they came\r\ndown together. Of course it is distressing, but I do not think you\r\nneed make yourself positively unhappy about it."\r\n\r\n"Would you not be unhappy if it were Mr. Finn?" said Mary, jumping\r\nup from her knees. "I shall go to him. I should go mad if I were to\r\nremain here and know nothing about it but what Silverbridge will tell\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I will telegraph to Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn won\'t care. Men are so heartless. They write about each\r\nother just as though it did not signify in the least whether anybody\r\nwere dead or alive. I shall go to him."\r\n\r\n"You cannot do that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care now what anybody may think. I choose to be considered\r\nas belonging to him, and if papa were here I would say the same." It\r\nwas of course not difficult to make her understand that she could not\r\ngo to Harrington, but it was by no means easy to keep her tranquil.\r\nShe would send a telegram herself. This was debated for a long time,\r\ntill at last Lady Mary insisted that she was not subject to Mrs.\r\nFinn\'s authority. "If papa were here, even then I would send it." And\r\nshe did send it, in her own name, regardless of the fact pointed out\r\nto her by Mrs. Finn, that the people at the post-office would thus\r\nknow her secret. "It is no secret," she said. "I don\'t want it to be\r\na secret." The telegram went in the following words: "I have heard\r\nit. I am so wretched. Send me one word to say how you are." She got\r\nan answer back, with Tregear\'s own name to it, on that afternoon. "Do\r\nnot be unhappy. I am doing well. Silverbridge is with me."\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday Gerald came home from Scotland. He had arranged\r\nhis little affair with Lord Percival, not however without some\r\ndifficulty. Lord Percival had declared he did not understand I.O.U.\'s\r\nin an affair of that kind. He had always thought that gentlemen did\r\nnot play for stakes which they could not pay at once. This was not\r\nsaid to Gerald himself;--or the result would have been calamitous.\r\nNidderdale was the go-between, and at last arranged it,--not however\r\ntill he had pointed out that Percival, having won so large a sum of\r\nmoney from a lad under twenty-one years of age, was very lucky in\r\nreceiving substantial security for its payment.\r\n\r\nGerald had chosen the period of his father\'s absence for his return.\r\nIt was necessary that the story of the gambling debt should be told\r\nthe Duke in February. Silverbridge had explained that to him, and\r\nhe had quite understood it. He, indeed, would be up at Oxford in\r\nFebruary, and, in that case, the first horror of the thing would be\r\nleft to poor Silverbridge! Thinking of this, Gerald felt that he was\r\nbound to tell his father himself. He resolved that he would do so,\r\nbut was anxious to postpone the evil day. He lingered therefore in\r\nScotland till he knew that his father was in Barsetshire.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival he was told of Tregear\'s accident. "Oh, Gerald; have\r\nyou heard?" said his sister. He had not as yet heard, and then the\r\nhistory was repeated to him. Mary did not attempt to conceal her own\r\nfeelings. She was as open with her brother as she had been with Mrs.\r\nFinn.\r\n\r\n"I suppose he\'ll get over it," said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"Is that all you say?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"What can I say better? I suppose he will. Fellows always do get over\r\nthat kind of thing. Herbert de Burgh smashed both his thighs, and now\r\nhe can move about again,--of course with crutches."\r\n\r\n"Gerald! How can you be so unfeeling!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean. I always liked Tregear, and I am very\r\nsorry for him. If you would take it a little quieter, I think it\r\nwould be better."\r\n\r\n"I could not take it quietly. How can I take it quietly when he is\r\nmore than all the world to me?"\r\n\r\n"You should keep that to yourself."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--and so let people think that I didn\'t care, till I broke my\r\nheart! I shall say just the same to papa when he comes home." After\r\nthat the brother and sister were not on very good terms with each\r\nother for the remainder of the day.\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday there was a letter from Silverbridge to Mrs. Finn.\r\nTregear was better; but was unhappy because it had been decided\r\nthat he could not be moved for the next month. This entailed\r\ntwo misfortunes on him;--first that of being the enforced guest\r\nof persons who were not,--or, hitherto had not been, his own\r\nfriends,--and then his absence from the first meeting of Parliament.\r\nWhen a gentleman has been in Parliament some years he may be able to\r\nreconcile himself to an obligatory vacation with a calm mind. But\r\nwhen the honours and glory are new, and the tedium of the benches\r\nhas not yet been experienced, then such an accident is felt to be\r\na grievance. But the young member was out of danger, and was, as\r\nSilverbridge declared, in the very best quarters which could be\r\nprovided for a man in such a position.\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn told him all the politics; Mrs. Spooner related to\r\nhim, on Sundays and Wednesdays, all the hunting details; while Lady\r\nChiltern read to him light literature, because he was not allowed to\r\nhold a book in his hand. "I wish it were me," said Gerald. "I wish I\r\nwere there to read to him," said Mary.\r\n\r\nThen the Duke came home. "Mary," said he, "I have been distressed to\r\nhear of this accident." This seemed to her to be the kindest word she\r\nhad heard from him for a long time. "I believe him to be a worthy\r\nyoung man. I am sorry that he should be the cause of so much sorrow\r\nto you--and to me."\r\n\r\n"Of course I was sorry for his accident," she replied, after pausing\r\nawhile; "but now that he is better I will not call him a cause of\r\nsorrow--to me." Then the Duke said nothing further about Tregear; nor\r\ndid she.\r\n\r\n"So you have come at last," he said to Gerald. That was the first\r\ngreeting,--to which the son responded by an awkward smile. But in the\r\ncourse of the evening he walked straight up to his father--"I have\r\nsomething to tell you, sir," said he.\r\n\r\n"Something to tell me?"\r\n\r\n"Something that will make you very angry."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV\r\n\r\n"Do You Ever Think What Money Is?"\r\n\r\n\r\nGerald told his story, standing bolt upright, and looking his father\r\nfull in the face as he told it. "You lost three thousand four hundred\r\npounds at one sitting to Lord Percival--at cards!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"In Lord Nidderdale\'s house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Nidderdale wasn\'t playing. It wasn\'t his fault."\r\n\r\n"Who were playing?"\r\n\r\n"Percival, and Dolly Longstaff, and Jack Hindes,--and I. Popplecourt\r\nwas playing at first."\r\n\r\n"Lord Popplecourt!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. But he went away when he began to lose."\r\n\r\n"Three thousand four hundred pounds! How old are you?"\r\n\r\n"I am just twenty-one."\r\n\r\n"You are beginning the world well, Gerald! What is the engagement\r\nwhich Silverbridge has made with Lord Percival?"\r\n\r\n"To pay him the money at the end of next month."\r\n\r\n"What had Silverbridge to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, sir. I wrote to Silverbridge because I didn\'t know what to\r\ndo. I knew he would stand to me."\r\n\r\n"Who is to stand to either of you if you go on thus I do not know."\r\nTo this Gerald of course made no reply, but an idea came across his\r\nmind that he knew who would stand both to himself and his brother.\r\n"How did Silverbridge mean to get the money?"\r\n\r\n"He said he would ask you. But I thought that I ought to tell you."\r\n\r\n"Is that all?"\r\n\r\n"All what, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Are there other debts?" To this Gerald made no reply. "Other\r\ngambling debts."\r\n\r\n"No, sir;--not a shilling of that kind. I have never played before."\r\n\r\n"Does it ever occur to you that going on at that rate you may very\r\nsoon lose all the fortune that will ever come to you? You were not\r\nyet of age and you lost three thousand four hundred pounds at cards\r\nto a man whom you probably knew to be a professed gambler!" The Duke\r\nseemed to wait for a reply, but poor Gerald had not a word to say.\r\n"Can you explain to me what benefit you proposed to yourself when you\r\nplayed for such stakes as that?"\r\n\r\n"I hoped to win back what I had lost."\r\n\r\n"Facilis descensus Averni!" said the Duke, shaking his head. "Noctes\r\natque dies patet atri janua Ditis." No doubt, he thought, that as his\r\nson was at Oxford, admonitions in Latin would serve him better than\r\nin his native tongue. But Gerald, when he heard the grand hexameter\r\nrolled out in his father\'s grandest tone, entertained a comfortable\r\nfeeling that the worst of the interview was over. "Win back what\r\nyou had lost! Do you think that that is the common fortune of young\r\ngamblers when they fall among those who are more experienced than\r\nthemselves?"\r\n\r\n"One goes on, sir, without reflecting."\r\n\r\n"Go on without reflecting! Yes; and where to? where to? Oh Gerald,\r\nwhere to? Whither will such progress without reflection take you?"\r\n"He means--to the devil," the lad said inwardly to himself, without\r\nmoving his lips. "There is but one goal for such going on as that. I\r\ncan pay three thousand four hundred pounds for you certainly. I think\r\nit hard that I should have to do so; but I can do it,--and I will do\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir," murmured Gerald.\r\n\r\n"But how can I wash your young mind clean from the foul stain which\r\nhas already defiled it? Why did you sit down to play? Was it to win\r\nthe money which these men had in their pockets?"\r\n\r\n"Not particularly."\r\n\r\n"It cannot be that a rational being should consent to risk the\r\nmoney he has himself,--to risk even the money which he has not\r\nhimself,--without a desire to win that which as yet belongs to his\r\nopponents. You desired to win."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I did hope to win."\r\n\r\n"And why? Why did you want to extract their property from their\r\npockets, and to put it into your own? That the footpad on the road\r\nshould have such desire when, with his pistol, he stops the traveller\r\non his journey we all understand. And we know what we think of the\r\nfootpad,--and what we do to him. He is a poor creature, who from his\r\nyouth upwards has had no good thing done for him, uneducated, an\r\noutcast, whom we should pity more than we despise him. We take him as\r\na pest which we cannot endure, and lock him up where he can harm us\r\nno more. On my word, Gerald, I think that the so-called gentleman\r\nwho sits down with the deliberate intention of extracting money from\r\nthe pockets of his antagonists, who lays out for himself that way of\r\nrepairing the shortcomings of fortune, who looks to that resource as\r\nan aid to his means,--is worse, much worse, than the public robber!\r\nHe is meaner, more cowardly, and has I think in his bosom less of the\r\nfeelings of an honest man. And he probably has been educated,--as you\r\nhave been. He calls himself a gentleman. He should know black from\r\nwhite. It is considered terrible to cheat at cards."\r\n\r\n"There was nothing of that, sir."\r\n\r\n"The man who plays and cheats has fallen low indeed."\r\n\r\n"I understand that, sir."\r\n\r\n"He who plays that he may make an income, but does not cheat, has\r\nfallen nearly as low. Do you ever think what money is?"\r\n\r\nThe Duke paused so long, collecting his own thoughts and thinking of\r\nhis own words, that Gerald found himself obliged to answer. "Cheques,\r\nand sovereigns, and bank-notes," he replied with much hesitation.\r\n\r\n"Money is the reward of labour," said the Duke, "or rather, in the\r\nshape it reaches you, it is your representation of that reward. You\r\nmay earn it yourself, or, as is, I am afraid, more likely to be the\r\ncase with you, you may possess it honestly as prepared for you by the\r\nlabour of others who have stored it up for you. But it is a commodity\r\nof which you are bound to see that the source is not only clean but\r\nnoble. You would not let Lord Percival give you money."\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t do that, sir, I am sure."\r\n\r\n"Nor would you take it. There is nothing so comfortable as\r\nmoney,--but nothing so defiling if it be come by unworthily; nothing\r\nso comfortable, but nothing so noxious if the mind be allowed to\r\ndwell upon it constantly. If a man have enough, let him spend\r\nit freely. If he wants it, let him earn it honestly. Let him do\r\nsomething for it, so that the man who pays it to him may get its\r\nvalue. But to think that it may be got by gambling, to hope to live\r\nafter that fashion, to sit down with your fingers almost in your\r\nneighbour\'s pockets, with your eye on his purse, trusting that you\r\nmay know better than he some studied calculations as to the pips\r\nconcealed in your hands, praying to the only god you worship that\r\nsome special card may be vouchsafed to you,--that I say is to have\r\nleft far, far behind you, all nobility, all gentleness, all manhood!\r\nWrite me down Lord Percival\'s address and I will send him the money."\r\n\r\nThen the Duke wrote a cheque for the money claimed and sent it with\r\na note, as follows:--"The Duke of Omnium presents his compliments to\r\nLord Percival. The Duke has been informed by Lord Gerald Palliser\r\nthat Lord Percival has won at cards from him the sum of three\r\nthousand four hundred pounds. The Duke now encloses a cheque for that\r\namount, and requests that the document which Lord Percival holds from\r\nLord Silverbridge as security for the amount, may be returned to\r\nLord Gerald." Let the noble gambler have his prey. He was little\r\nsolicitous about that. If he could only so operate on the mind of\r\nthis son,--so operate on the minds of both his sons, as to make them\r\nsee the foolishness of folly, the ugliness of what is mean, the\r\nsqualor and dirt of ignoble pursuits, then he could easily pardon\r\npast faults. If it were half his wealth, what would it signify if he\r\ncould teach his children to accept those lessons without which no man\r\ncan live as a gentleman, let his rank be the highest known, let his\r\nwealth be as the sands, his fashion unrivalled?\r\n\r\nThe word or two which his daughter had said to him, declaring\r\nthat she still took pride in her lover\'s love, and then this new\r\nmisfortune on Gerald\'s part, upset him greatly. He almost sickened of\r\npolitics when he thought of his domestic bereavement and his domestic\r\nmisfortunes. How completely had he failed to indoctrinate his\r\nchildren with the ideas by which his own mind was fortified and\r\ncontrolled! Nothing was so base to him as a gambler, and they had\r\nboth commenced their career by gambling. From their young boyhood\r\nnothing had seemed so desirable to him as that they should be\r\naccustomed by early training to devote themselves to the service of\r\ntheir country. He saw other young noblemen around him who at eighteen\r\nwere known as debaters at their colleges, or at twenty-five were\r\nalready deep in politics, social science, and educational projects.\r\nWhat good would all his wealth or all his position do for his\r\nchildren if their minds could rise to nothing beyond the shooting\r\nof deer and the hunting of foxes? There was young Lord Buttercup,\r\nthe son of the Earl of Woolantallow, only a few months older than\r\nSilverbridge,--who was already a junior lord, and as constant at his\r\noffice, or during the Session on the Treasury Bench, as though there\r\nwere not a pack of hounds or a card-table in Great Britain! Lord\r\nButtercup, too, had already written an article in "The Fortnightly"\r\non the subject of Turkish finance. How long would it be before\r\nSilverbridge would write an article, or Gerald sign his name in the\r\nservice of the public?\r\n\r\nAnd then those proposed marriages,--as to which he was beginning to\r\nknow that his children would be too strong for him! Anxious as he was\r\nthat both his sons should be permeated by Liberal politics, studious\r\nas he had ever been to teach them that the highest duty of those high\r\nin rank was to use their authority to elevate those beneath them,\r\nstill he was hardly less anxious to make them understand that their\r\nsecond duty required them to maintain their own position. It was by\r\nfeeling this second duty,--by feeling it and performing it,--that\r\nthey would be enabled to perform the rest. And now both Silverbridge\r\nand his girl were bent upon marriages by which they would depart out\r\nof their own order! Let Silverbridge marry whom he might, he could\r\nnot be other than heir to the honours of his family. But by his\r\nmarriage he might either support or derogate from these honours. And\r\nnow, having at first made a choice that was good, he had altered\r\nhis mind from simple freak, captivated by a pair of bright eyes and\r\nan arch smile; and without a feeling in regard to his family, was\r\nanxious to take to his bosom the granddaughter of an American\r\nday-labourer!\r\n\r\nAnd then his girl,--of whose beauty he was so proud, from whose\r\nmanners, and tastes, and modes of life he had expected to reap those\r\ngood things, in a feminine degree, which his sons as young men seemed\r\nso little fitted to give him! By slow degrees he had been brought\r\nround to acknowledge that the young man was worthy. Tregear\'s conduct\r\nhad been felt by the Duke to be manly. The letter he had written was\r\na good letter. And then he had won for himself a seat in the House of\r\nCommons. When forced to speak of him to this girl he had been driven\r\nby justice to call him worthy. But how could he serve to support and\r\nstrengthen that nobility, the endurance and perpetuation of which\r\nshould be the peculiar care of every Palliser?\r\n\r\nAnd yet as the Duke walked about his room he felt that his opposition\r\neither to the one marriage or to the other was vain. Of course they\r\nwould marry according to their wills.\r\n\r\nThat same night Gerald wrote to his brother before he went to bed, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR SILVER,--I was awfully obliged to you for sending me\r\n   the I.O.U. for that brute Percival. He only sneered when\r\n   he took it, and would have said something disagreeable,\r\n   but that he saw that I was in earnest. I know he did say\r\n   something to Nid, only I can\'t find out what. Nid is an\r\n   easy-going fellow, and, as I saw, didn\'t want to have a\r\n   rumpus.\r\n\r\n   But now what do you think I\'ve done? Directly I got home\r\n   I told the governor all about it! As I was in the train I\r\n   made up my mind that I would. I went slap at it. If there\r\n   is anything that never does any good, it\'s craning. I did\r\n   it all at one rush, just as though I was swallowing a dose\r\n   of physic. I wish I could tell you all that the governor\r\n   said, because it was really tip-top. What is a fellow to\r\n   get by playing high,--a fellow like you and me? I didn\'t\r\n   want any of that beast\'s money. I don\'t suppose he had\r\n   any. But one\'s dander gets up, and one doesn\'t like to be\r\n   done, and so it goes on. I shall cut that kind of thing\r\n   altogether. You should have heard the governor spouting\r\n   Latin! And then the way he sat upon Percival, without\r\n   mentioning the fellow\'s name! I do think it mean to set\r\n   yourself to work to win money at cards,--and it is awfully\r\n   mean to lose more than you have got to pay.\r\n\r\n   Then at the end the governor said he\'d send the beast a\r\n   cheque for the amount. You know his way of finishing up,\r\n   just like two fellows fighting;--when one has awfully\r\n   punished the other he goes up and shakes hands with him.\r\n   He did pitch into me,--not abusing me, nor even saying\r\n   a word about the money, which he at once promised\r\n   to pay, but laying it on to gambling with a regular\r\n   cat-o\'-nine-tails. And then there was an end of it. He\r\n   just asked the fellow\'s address and said that he would\r\n   send him the money. I will say this;--I don\'t think\r\n   there\'s a greater brick than the governor out anywhere.\r\n\r\n   I am awfully sorry about Tregear. I can\'t quite make out\r\n   how it happened. I suppose you were too near him, and\r\n   Melrose always does rush at his fences. One fellow\r\n   shouldn\'t be too near another fellow,--only it so often\r\n   happens that it can\'t be helped. It\'s just like anything\r\n   else, if nothing comes of it then it\'s all right. But if\r\n   anybody comes to grief then he has got to be pitched into.\r\n   Do you remember when I nearly cut over old Sir Simon\r\n   Slobody? Didn\'t I hear about it!\r\n\r\n   I am awfully glad you didn\'t smash up Tregear altogether,\r\n   because of Mary. I am quite sure it is no good anybody\r\n   setting up his back against that. It\'s one of the things\r\n   that have got to be. You always have said that he is a\r\n   good fellow. If so, what\'s the harm? At any rate it has\r\n   got to be.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate Brother,\r\n\r\n   GERALD.\r\n\r\n   I go up in about a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI\r\n\r\nThe Three Attacks\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the following week the communications between Harrington and\r\nMatching were very frequent. There were no further direct messages\r\nbetween Tregear and Lady Mary, but she heard daily of his progress.\r\nThe Duke was conscious of the special interest which existed in his\r\nhouse as to the condition of the young man, but, after his arrival,\r\nnot a word was spoken for some days between him and his daughter on\r\nthe subject. Then Gerald went back to his college, and the Duke made\r\nhis preparations for going up to town and making some attempt at\r\nparliamentary activity.\r\n\r\nIt was by no concert that an attack was made upon him from three\r\nquarters at once as he was preparing to leave Matching. On the Sunday\r\nmorning during church time,--for on that day Lady Mary went to her\r\ndevotions alone,--Mrs. Finn was closeted for an hour with the Duke\r\nin his study. "I think you ought to be aware," she said to the Duke,\r\n"that though I trust Mary implicitly and know her to be thoroughly\r\nhigh principled, I cannot be responsible for her, if I remain with\r\nher here."\r\n\r\n"I do not quite follow your meaning."\r\n\r\n"Of course there is but one matter on which there can, probably,\r\nbe any difference between us. If she should choose to write to Mr.\r\nTregear, or to send him a message, or even to go to him, I could not\r\nprevent it."\r\n\r\n"Go to him!" exclaimed the horrified Duke.\r\n\r\n"I merely suggest such a thing in order to make you understand that I\r\nhave absolutely no control over her."\r\n\r\n"What control have I?"\r\n\r\n"Nay; I cannot define that. You are her father, and she acknowledges\r\nyour authority. She regards me as a friend--and as such treats me\r\nwith the sweetest affection. Nothing can be more gratifying than her\r\nmanner to me personally."\r\n\r\n"It ought to be so."\r\n\r\n"She has thoroughly won my heart. But still I know that if there were\r\na difference between us she would not obey me. Why should she?"\r\n\r\n"Because you hold my deputed authority."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Duke, that goes for very little anywhere. No one can depute\r\nauthority. It comes too much from personal accidents, and too little\r\nfrom reason or law to be handed over to others. Besides, I fear, that\r\non one matter concerning her you and I are not agreed."\r\n\r\n"I shall be sorry if it be so."\r\n\r\n"I feel that I am bound to tell you my opinion."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"You think that in the end Lady Mary will allow herself to be\r\nseparated from Tregear. I think that in the end they will become man\r\nand wife."\r\n\r\nThis seemed to the Duke to be not quite so bad as it might have been.\r\nAny speculation as to results were very different from an expressed\r\nopinion as to propriety. Were he to tell the truth as to his own\r\nmind, he might perhaps have said the same thing. But one is not to\r\nrelax in one\'s endeavours to prevent that which is wrong, because one\r\nfears that the wrong may be ultimately perpetrated. "Let that be as\r\nit may," he said, "it cannot alter my duty."\r\n\r\n"Nor mine, Duke, if I may presume to think that I have a duty in this\r\nmatter."\r\n\r\n"That you should encounter the burden of the duty binds me to you for\r\never."\r\n\r\n"If it be that they will certainly be married one day--"\r\n\r\n"Who has said that? Who has admitted that?"\r\n\r\n"If it be so; if it seems to me that it must be so,--then how can I\r\nbe anxious to prolong her sufferings? She does suffer terribly." Upon\r\nthis the Duke frowned, but there was more of tenderness in his frown\r\nthan in the hard smile which he had hitherto worn. "I do not know\r\nwhether you see it all." He well remembered all that he had seen when\r\nhe and Mary were travelling together. "I see it; and I do not pass\r\nhalf an hour with her without sorrowing for her." On hearing this he\r\nsighed and turned his face away. "Girls are so different! There are\r\nmany who though they be genuinely in love, though their natures are\r\nsweet and affectionate, are not strong enough to support their own\r\nfeelings in resistance to the will of those who have authority over\r\nthem." Had it been so with his wife? At this moment all the former\r\nhistory passed through his mind. "They yield to that which seems to\r\nbe inevitable, and allow themselves to be fashioned by the purposes\r\nof others. It is well for them often that they are so plastic.\r\nWhether it would be better for her that she should be so I will not\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"It would be better," said the Duke doggedly.\r\n\r\n"But such is not her nature. She is as determined as ever."\r\n\r\n"I may be determined too."\r\n\r\n"But if at last it will be of no use,--if it be her fate either to be\r\nmarried to this man or die of a broken heart--"\r\n\r\n"What justifies you in saying that? How can you torture me by such a\r\nthreat?"\r\n\r\n"If I think so, Duke, I am justified. Of late I have been with her\r\ndaily,--almost hourly. I do not say that this will kill her now,--in\r\nher youth. It is not often, I fancy, that women die after that\r\nfashion. But a broken heart may bring the sufferer to the grave after\r\na lapse of many years. How will it be with you if she should live\r\nlike a ghost beside you for the next twenty years, and you should\r\nthen see her die, faded and withered before her time,--all her life\r\ngone without a joy,--because she had loved a man whose position in\r\nlife was displeasing to you? Would the ground on which the sacrifice\r\nhad been made then justify itself to you? In thus performing your\r\nduty to your order would you feel satisfied that you had performed\r\nthat to your child?"\r\n\r\nShe had come there determined to say it all,--to liberate her own\r\nsoul as it were,--but had much doubted the spirit in which the Duke\r\nwould listen to her. That he would listen to her she was sure,--and\r\nthen if he chose to cast her out, she would endure his wrath. It\r\nwould not be to her now as it had been when he accused her of\r\ntreachery. But, nevertheless, bold as she was and independent, he had\r\nimbued her, as he did all those around him, with so strong a sense of\r\nhis personal dignity, that when she had finished she almost trembled\r\nas she looked in his face. Since he had asked her how she could\r\njustify to herself the threats which she was using he had sat still\r\nwith his eyes fixed upon her. Now, when she had done, he was in no\r\nhurry to speak. He rose slowly and walking towards the fireplace\r\nstood with his back towards her, looking down upon the fire. She was\r\nthe first to speak again. "Shall I leave you now?" she said in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it will be better," he answered. His voice, too, was very\r\nlow. In truth he was so moved that he hardly knew how to speak at\r\nall. Then she rose and was already on her way to the door when he\r\nfollowed her. "One moment, if you please," he said almost sternly.\r\n"I am under a debt of gratitude to you of which I cannot express\r\nmy sense in words. How far I may agree with you, and where I may\r\ndisagree, I will not attempt to point out to you now."\r\n\r\n"Oh no."\r\n\r\n"But all that you have troubled yourself to think and to feel in this\r\nmatter, and all that true friendship has compelled you to say to me,\r\nshall be written down in the tablets of my memory."\r\n\r\n"Duke!"\r\n\r\n"My child has at any rate been fortunate in securing the friendship\r\nof such a friend." Then he turned back to the fireplace, and she was\r\nconstrained to leave the room without another word.\r\n\r\nShe had determined to make the best plea in her power for Mary; and\r\nwhile she was making the plea had been almost surprised by her own\r\nvehemence; but the greater had been her vehemence, the stronger, she\r\nthought, would have been the Duke\'s anger. And as she had watched the\r\nworkings of his face she had felt for a moment that the vials of his\r\nwrath were about to be poured out upon her. Even when she left the\r\nroom she almost believed that had he not taken those moments for\r\nconsideration at the fireplace his parting words would have been\r\ndifferent. But, as it was, there could be no question now of her\r\ndeparture. No power was left to her of separating herself from\r\nLady Mary. Though the Duke had not as yet acknowledged himself to\r\nbe conquered, there was no doubt to her now but that he would be\r\nconquered. And she, either here or in London, must be the girl\'s\r\nnearest friend up to the day when she should be given over to Mr.\r\nTregear.\r\n\r\nThat was one of the three attacks which were made upon the Duke\r\nbefore he went up to his parliamentary duties.\r\n\r\nThe second was as follows: Among the letters on the following morning\r\none was brought to him from Tregear. It is hoped that the reader will\r\nremember the lover\'s former letter and the very unsatisfactory answer\r\nwhich had been sent to it. Nothing could have been colder, less\r\npropitious, or more inveterately hostile than the reply. As he lay\r\nin bed with his broken bones at Harrington he had ample time for\r\nthinking over all this. He knew every word of the Duke\'s distressing\r\nnote by heart, and had often lashed himself to rage as he had\r\nrepeated it. But he could effect nothing by showing his anger. He\r\nmust go on and still do something. Since the writing of that letter\r\nhe had done something. He had got his seat in Parliament. And he\r\nhad secured the interest of his friend Silverbridge. This had been\r\npartially done at Polwenning; but the accident in the Brake country\r\nhad completed the work. The brother had at last declared himself\r\nin his friend\'s favour. "Of course I should be glad to see it," he\r\nhad said while sitting by Tregear\'s bedside. "The worst is that\r\neverything does seem to go against the poor governor."\r\n\r\nThen Tregear made up his mind that he would write another letter.\r\nPersonally he was not in the best condition for doing this as he was\r\nlying in bed with his left arm tied up, and with straps and bandages\r\nall round his body. But he could sit up in bed, and his right hand\r\nand arm were free. So he declared to Lady Chiltern his purpose of\r\nwriting a letter. She tried to dissuade him gently and offered to be\r\nhis secretary. But when he assured her that no secretary could write\r\nthis letter for him she understood pretty well what would be the\r\nsubject of the letter. With considerable difficulty Tregear wrote his\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY LORD DUKE,--[On this occasion he left out the epithet\r\n   which he had before used]\r\n\r\n   Your Grace\'s reply to my last letter was not encouraging,\r\n   but in spite of your prohibition I venture to write to you\r\n   again. If I had the slightest reason for thinking that\r\n   your daughter was estranged from me, I would not persecute\r\n   either you or her. But if it be true that she is as\r\n   devoted to me as I am to her, can I be wrong in pleading\r\n   my cause? Is it not evident to you that she is made\r\n   of such stuff that she will not be controlled in her\r\n   choice,--even by your will?\r\n\r\n   I have had an accident in the hunting-field and am now\r\n   writing from Lord Chiltern\'s house, where I am confined to\r\n   bed. But I think you will understand me when I say that\r\n   even in this helpless condition I feel myself constrained\r\n   to do something. Of course I ask for nothing from you on\r\n   my own behalf,--but on her behalf may I not add my prayers\r\n   to hers?\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be,\r\n   Your Grace\'s very faithful Servant,\r\n\r\n   FRANCIS TREGEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis coming alone would perhaps have had no effect. The Duke had\r\ndesired the young man not to address him again; and the young man had\r\ndisobeyed him. No mere courtesy would now have constrained him to\r\nsend any reply to this further letter. But coming as it did while his\r\nheart was still throbbing with the effects of Mrs. Finn\'s words, it\r\nwas allowed to have a certain force. The argument used was a true\r\nargument. His girl was devoted to the man who sought her hand. Mrs.\r\nFinn had told him that sooner or later he must yield,--unless he was\r\nprepared to see his child wither and fade at his side. He had once\r\nthought that he would be prepared even for that. He had endeavoured\r\nto strengthen his own will by arguing with himself that when he saw a\r\nduty plainly before him, he should cleave to that let the results be\r\nwhat they might. But that picture of her face withered and wan after\r\ntwenty years of sorrowing had had its effect upon his heart. He even\r\nmade excuses within his own breast in the young man\'s favour. He\r\nwas in Parliament now, and what may not be done for a young man in\r\nParliament? Altogether the young man appeared to him in a light\r\ndifferent from that through which he had viewed the presumptuous,\r\narrogant, utterly unjustifiable suitor who had come to him, now\r\nnearly a year since, in Carlton Terrace.\r\n\r\nHe went to breakfast with Tregear\'s letter in his pocket, and was\r\nthen gracious to Mrs. Finn, and tender to his daughter. "When do you\r\ngo, papa?" Mary asked.\r\n\r\n"I shall take the 11.45 train. I have ordered the carriage at a\r\nquarter before eleven."\r\n\r\n"May I go to the train with you, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly; I shall be delighted."\r\n\r\n"Papa!" Mary said as soon as she found herself seated beside her\r\nfather in the carriage.\r\n\r\n"My dear."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa!" and she threw herself on to his breast. He put his arm\r\nround her and kissed her,--as he would have had so much delight in\r\ndoing, as he would have done so often before, had there not been this\r\nground of discord. She was very sweet to him. It had never seemed\r\nto him that she had disgraced herself by loving Tregear--but that a\r\ngreat misfortune had fallen upon her. Silverbridge when he had gone\r\ninto a racing partnership with Tifto, and Gerald when he had played\r\nfor money which he did not possess, had--degraded themselves in\r\nhis estimation. He would not have used such a word; but it was\r\nhis feeling. They were less noble, less pure than they might have\r\nbeen, had they kept themselves free from such stain. But this\r\ngirl,--whether she should live and fade by his side, or whether she\r\nshould give her hand to some fitting noble suitor,--or even though\r\nshe might at last become the wife of this man who loved her, would\r\nalways have been pure. It was sweet to him to have something to\r\ncaress. Now in the solitude of his life, as years were coming on him,\r\nhe felt how necessary it was that he should have someone who would\r\nlove him. Since his wife had left him he had been debarred from these\r\ncaresses by the necessity of showing his antagonism to her dearest\r\nwishes. It had been his duty to be stern. In all his words to his\r\ndaughter he had been governed by a conviction that he never ought to\r\nallow the duty of separating her from her lover to be absent from\r\nhis mind. He was not prepared to acknowledge that that duty had\r\nceased;--but yet there had crept over him a feeling that as he\r\nwas half conquered, why should he not seek some recompense in his\r\ndaughter\'s love? "Papa," she said, "you do not hate me?"\r\n\r\n"Hate you, my darling?"\r\n\r\n"Because I am disobedient. Oh, papa, I cannot help it. He should not\r\nhave come. He should not have been let to come." He had not a word\r\nto say to her. He could not as yet bring himself to tell her,--that\r\nit should be as she desired. Much less could he now argue with her\r\nas to the impossibility of such a marriage as he had done on former\r\noccasions when the matter had been discussed. He could only press his\r\narm tightly round her waist, and be silent. "It cannot be altered\r\nnow, papa. Look at me. Tell me that you love me."\r\n\r\n"Have you doubted my love?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa,--but I would do anything to make you happy; anything that\r\nI could do. Papa, you do not want me to marry Lord Popplecourt?"\r\n\r\n"I would not have you marry any man without loving him."\r\n\r\n"I never can love anybody else. That is what I wanted you to know,\r\npapa."\r\n\r\nTo this he made no reply, nor was there anything else said upon the\r\nsubject before the carriage drove up to the railway station. "Do not\r\nget out, dear," he said, seeing that her eyes had been filled with\r\ntears. "It is not worth while. God bless you, my child! You will be\r\nup in London I hope in a fortnight, and we must try to make the house\r\na little less dull for you."\r\n\r\nAnd so he had encountered the third attack.\r\n\r\nLady Mary, as she was driven home, recovered her spirits wonderfully.\r\nNot a word had fallen from her father which she could use hereafter\r\nas a refuge from her embarrassments. He had made her no promise. He\r\nhad assented to nothing. But there had been something in his manner,\r\nin his gait, in his eye, in the pressure of his arm, which made her\r\nfeel that her troubles would soon be at an end.\r\n\r\n"I do love you so much," she said to Mrs. Finn late on that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n"I am glad of that, dear."\r\n\r\n"I shall always love you,--because you have been on my side all\r\nthrough."\r\n\r\n"No, Mary;--that is not so."\r\n\r\n"I know it is so. Of course you have to be wise because you are\r\nolder. And papa would not have you here with me if you were not wise.\r\nBut I know you are on my side,--and papa knows it too. And someone\r\nelse shall know it some day."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII\r\n\r\n"He Is Such a Beast"\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Silverbridge remained hunting in the Brake country till a few\r\ndays before the meeting of Parliament, and had he been left to\r\nhimself he would have had another week in the country and might\r\nprobably have overstayed the opening day; but he had not been left to\r\nhimself. In the last week in January an important despatch reached\r\nhis hands, from no less important a person than Sir Timothy Beeswax,\r\nsuggesting to him that he should undertake the duty of seconding the\r\naddress in the House of Commons. When the proposition first reached\r\nhim it made his hair stand on end. He had never yet risen to his feet\r\nin the House. He had spoken at those election meetings in Cornwall,\r\nand had found it easy enough. After the first or second time he had\r\nthought it good fun. But he knew that standing up in the House of\r\nCommons would be different from that. Then there would be the dress!\r\n"I should so hate to fig myself out and look like a guy," he said to\r\nTregear, to whom of course he confided the offer that was made to\r\nhim. Tregear was very anxious that he should accept it. "A man should\r\nnever refuse anything of that kind which comes in his way," Tregear\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"It is only because I am the governor\'s son," Silverbridge pleaded.\r\n\r\n"Partly so perhaps. But if it be altogether so, what of that? Take\r\nthe goods the gods provide you. Of course all these things which our\r\nambition covets are easier to Duke\'s sons than to others. But not on\r\nthat account should a Duke\'s son refuse them. A man when he sees a\r\nrung vacant on the ladder should always put his feet there."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what," said Silverbridge. "If I thought this was all\r\nfair sailing I\'d do it. I should feel certain that I should come a\r\ncropper, but still I\'d try it. As you say, a fellow should try. But\r\nit\'s all meant as a blow at the governor. Old Beeswax thinks that if\r\nhe can get me up to swear that he and his crew are real first-chop\r\nhands, that will hit the governor hard. It\'s as much as saying to the\r\ngovernor,--\'This chap belongs to me, not to you.\' That\'s a thing I\r\nwon\'t go in for." Then Tregear counselled him to write to his father\r\nfor advice, and at the same time to ask Sir Timothy to allow him\r\na day or two for consideration. This counsel he took. His letter\r\nreached his father two days before he left Matching. In answer to it\r\nthere came first a telegram begging Silverbridge to be in London on\r\nthe Monday, and then a letter, in which the Duke expressed himself\r\nas being anxious to see his son before giving a final answer to the\r\nquestion. Thus it was that Silverbridge had been taken away from his\r\nhunting.\r\n\r\nIsabel Boncassen, however, was now in London, and from her it was\r\npossible that he might find consolation. He had written to her soon\r\nafter reaching Harrington, telling her that he had had it all out\r\nwith the governor. "There is a good deal that I can only tell you\r\nwhen I see you," he said. Then he assured her with many lover\'s\r\nprotestations that he was and always would be till death altogether\r\nher own most loving S. To this he had received an answer by return\r\nof post. She would be delighted to see him up in town,--as would her\r\nfather and mother. They had now got a comfortable house in Brook\r\nStreet. And then she signed herself his sincere friend, Isabel.\r\nSilverbridge thought that it was cold, and remembered certain scraps\r\nin another feminine handwriting in which more passion was expressed.\r\nPerhaps this was the way with American young ladies when they were in\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Duke, "I am glad that you have come up at once, as\r\nSir Timothy should have his answer without further delay."\r\n\r\n"But what shall I say?"\r\n\r\nThe Duke, though he had already considered the matter very seriously,\r\nnevertheless took a few minutes to consider it again. "The offer,"\r\nsaid he, "must be acknowledged as very flattering."\r\n\r\n"But the circumstances are not usual."\r\n\r\n"It cannot often be the case that a minister should ask the son of\r\nhis keenest political opponent to render him such a service. But,\r\nhowever, we will put that aside."\r\n\r\n"Not quite, sir."\r\n\r\n"For the present we will put that on one side. Not looking at the\r\nparty which you may be called upon to support, having for the moment\r\nno regard to this or that line in politics, there is no opening\r\nto the real duties of parliamentary life which I would sooner see\r\naccorded to you than this."\r\n\r\n"But if I were to break down?" Talking to his father he could\r\nnot quite venture to ask what might happen if he were to "come a\r\ncropper."\r\n\r\n"None but the brave deserve the fair," said the Duke slapping his\r\nhands upon the table. "Why, if we fail, \'We fail! But screw your\r\ncourage to the sticking place, And we\'ll not fail.\' What high point\r\nwould ever be reached if caution such as that were allowed to\r\nprevail? What young men have done before cannot you do? I have no\r\ndoubt of your capacity. None."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you, sir?" said Silverbridge, considerably gratified,--and\r\nalso surprised.\r\n\r\n"None in the least. But, perhaps, some of your diligence."\r\n\r\n"I could learn it by heart, sir,--if you mean that."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t mean that; or rather I mean much more than that. You\r\nhave first to realise in your mind the thing to be said, and then\r\nthe words in which you should say it, before you come to learning by\r\nheart."\r\n\r\n"Some of them I suppose would tell me what to say."\r\n\r\n"No doubt with your inexperience it would be unfit that you should be\r\nleft entirely to yourself. But I would wish you to know,--perhaps I\r\nshould say to feel,--that the sentiments to be expressed by you were\r\njust."\r\n\r\n"I should have to praise Sir Timothy."\r\n\r\n"Not that necessarily. But you would have to advocate that course in\r\nParliament which Sir Timothy and his friends have taken and propose\r\nto take."\r\n\r\n"But I hate him like poison."\r\n\r\n"There need be no personal feeling in the matter. I remember that\r\nwhen I moved the address in your house Mr. Mildmay was Prime\r\nMinister,--a man for whom my regard and esteem were unbounded,--who\r\nhad been in political matters the preceptor of my youth, whom as a\r\npatriotic statesman I almost worshipped, whom I now remember as a\r\nman whose departure from the arena of politics left the country very\r\ndestitute. No one has sprung up since like to him,--or hardly second\r\nto him. But in speaking on so large a subject as the policy of a\r\nparty, I thought it beneath me to eulogise a man. The same policy\r\nreversed may keep you silent respecting Sir Timothy."\r\n\r\n"I needn\'t of course say what I think about him."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you do agree with Sir Timothy as to his general policy? On\r\nno other condition can you undertake such a duty."\r\n\r\n"Of course I have voted with him."\r\n\r\n"So I have observed,--not so regularly perhaps as Mr. Roby would have\r\ndesired." Mr. Roby was the Conservative whip.\r\n\r\n"And I suppose the people at Silverbridge expect me to support him."\r\n\r\n"I hardly know how that may be. They used to be contented with my\r\npoor services. No doubt they feel they have changed for the better."\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t say that, sir."\r\n\r\n"I am bound to suppose that they think so, because when the matter\r\nwas left in their own hands they at once elected a Conservative. You\r\nneed not fear that you will offend them by seconding the address.\r\nThey will probably feel proud to see their young member brought\r\nforward on such an occasion; as I shall be proud to see my son."\r\n\r\n"You would if it were on the other side, sir."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Silverbridge, yes; I should be very proud if it were on the\r\nother side. But there is a useful old adage which bids us not cry\r\nfor spilt milk. You have a right to your opinions, though perhaps I\r\nmay think that in adopting what I must call new opinions you were a\r\nlittle precipitate. We cannot act together in politics. But not the\r\nless on that account do I wish to see you take an active and useful\r\npart on that side to which you have attached yourself." As he said\r\nthis he rose from his seat and spoke with emphasis, as though he\r\nwere addressing some imaginary Speaker or a house of legislators\r\naround. "I shall be proud to hear you second the address. If you\r\ndo it as gracefully and as fitly as I am sure you may if you will\r\ngive yourself the trouble, I shall hear you do it with infinite\r\nsatisfaction, even though I shall feel at the same time anxious to\r\nanswer all your arguments and to disprove all your assertions. I\r\nshould be listening no doubt to my opponent;--but I should be proud\r\nto feel that I was listening to my son. My advice to you is to do as\r\nSir Timothy has asked you."\r\n\r\n"He is such a beast, sir," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"Pray do not speak in that way on matters so serious."\r\n\r\n"I do not think you quite understand it, sir."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not. Can you enlighten me?"\r\n\r\n"I believe he has done this only to annoy you."\r\n\r\nThe Duke, who had again seated himself, and was leaning back in his\r\nchair, raised himself up, placed his hands on the table before him,\r\nand looked his son hard in the face. The idea which Silverbridge had\r\njust expressed had certainly occurred to himself. He remembered well\r\nall the circumstances of the time when he and Sir Timothy Beeswax\r\nhad been members of the same government;--and he remembered how\r\nanimosities had grown, and how treacherous he had thought the man.\r\nFrom the moment in which he had read the minister\'s letter to the\r\nyoung member, he had felt that the offer had too probably come from a\r\ndesire to make the political separation between himself and his son\r\ncomplete. But he had thought that in counselling his son he was bound\r\nto ignore such a feeling; and it certainly had not occurred to him\r\nthat Silverbridge would be astute enough to perceive the same thing.\r\n\r\n"What makes you fancy that?" said the Duke, striving to conceal\r\nby his manner, but not altogether successful in concealing, the\r\ngratification which he certainly felt.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, I am not sure that I can explain it. Of course it is\r\nputting you in a different boat from me."\r\n\r\n"You have already chosen your boat."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he thinks I may get out again. I dislike the skipper so\r\nmuch, that I am not sure that I shall not."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Silverbridge,--that is such a fault! So much is included in that\r\nwhich is unstatesmanlike, unpatriotic, almost dishonest! Do you mean\r\nto say that you would be this or that in politics according to your\r\npersonal liking for an individual?"\r\n\r\n"When you don\'t trust the leader, you can\'t believe very firmly in\r\nthe followers," said Silverbridge doggedly. "I won\'t say, sir, what I\r\nmay do. Though I dare say that what I think is not of much account, I\r\ndo think a good deal about it."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of that."\r\n\r\n"And as I think it not at all improbable that I may go back again, if\r\nyou don\'t mind it, I will refuse." Of course after that the Duke had\r\nno further arguments to use in favour of Sir Timothy\'s proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII\r\n\r\nBrook Street\r\n\r\n\r\nSilverbridge had now a week on his hands which he felt he might\r\ndevote to the lady of his love. It was a comfort to him that he need\r\nhave nothing to do with the address. To have to go, day after day,\r\nto the Treasury in order that he might learn his lesson, would have\r\nbeen disagreeable to him. He did not quite know how the lesson\r\nwould have been communicated, but fancied it would have come from\r\n"Old Roby," whom he did not love much better than Sir Timothy. Then\r\nthe speech must have been composed, and afterwards submitted to\r\nsomeone,--probably to old Roby again, by whom no doubt it would\r\nbe cut and slashed, and made quite a different speech than he had\r\nintended. If he had not praised Sir Timothy himself, Roby,--or\r\nwhatever other tutor might have been assigned to him,--would have put\r\nthe praise in. And then how many hours it would have taken to learn\r\n"the horrid thing" by heart. He proudly felt that he had not been\r\nprompted by idleness to decline the task; but not the less was he\r\nglad to have shuffled the burden from off his shoulders.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning he was in Brook Street, having sent a note to\r\nsay he would call, and having even named the hour. And yet when he\r\nknocked at the door, he was told with the utmost indifference by a\r\nLondon footman, that Miss Boncassen was not at home,--also that Mrs.\r\nBoncassen was not at home;--also that Mr. Boncassen was not at home.\r\nWhen he asked at what hour Miss Boncassen was expected home, the man\r\nanswered him, just as though he had been anybody else, that he knew\r\nnothing about it. He turned away in disgust, and had himself driven\r\nto the Beargarden. In his misery he had recourse to game-pie and a\r\npint of champagne for his lunch. "Halloa, old fellow, what is this I\r\nhear about you?" said Nidderdale, coming in and sitting opposite to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you have heard."\r\n\r\n"You are going to second the address. What made them pick you out\r\nfrom the lot of us?"\r\n\r\n"It is just what I am not going to do."\r\n\r\n"I saw it all in the papers."\r\n\r\n"I dare say;--and yet it isn\'t true. I shouldn\'t wonder if they ask\r\nyou." At this moment a waiter handed a large official letter to Lord\r\nNidderdale, saying that the messenger who had brought it was waiting\r\nfor an answer in the hall. The letter bore the important signature\r\nof T. Beeswax on the corner of the envelope, and so disturbed Lord\r\nNidderdale that he called at once for a glass of soda-and-brandy.\r\nWhen opened it was found to be very nearly a counterpart of that\r\nwhich Silverbridge had received down in the country. There was,\r\nhowever, added a little prayer that Lord Nidderdale would at once\r\ncome down to the Treasury Chambers.\r\n\r\n"They must be very hard up," said Lord Nidderdale. "But I shall do\r\nit. Cantrip is always at me to do something, and you see if I don\'t\r\nbutter them up properly." Then having fortified himself with game-pie\r\nand a glass of brown sherry he went away at once to the Treasury\r\nChambers.\r\n\r\nSilverbridge felt himself a little better after his lunch,--better\r\nstill when he had smoked a couple of cigarettes walking about the\r\nempty smoking-room. And as he walked he collected his thoughts.\r\nShe could hardly have meant to slight him. No doubt her letter\r\ndown to him at Harrington had been very cold. No doubt he had been\r\nill-treated in being sent away so unceremoniously from the door. But\r\nyet she could hardly intend that everything between them should be\r\nover. Even an American girl could not be so unreasonable as that. He\r\nremembered the passionate way in which she had assured him of her\r\nlove. All that could not have been forgotten! He had done nothing by\r\nwhich he could have forfeited her esteem. She had desired him to tell\r\nthe whole affair to her father, and he had done so. Mr. Boncassen\r\nmight perhaps have objected. It might be that this American was so\r\nprejudiced against English aristocrats as to desire no commerce with\r\nthem. There were not many Englishmen who would not have welcomed him\r\nas son-in-law, but Americans might be different. Still,--still Isabel\r\nwould hardly have shown her obedience to her father in this way. She\r\nwas too independent to obey her father in a matter concerning her own\r\nheart. And if he had not been the possessor of her heart at that last\r\ninterview, then she must have been false indeed! So he got once more\r\ninto his hansom and had himself taken back to Brook Street.\r\n\r\nMrs. Boncassen was in the drawing-room alone.\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry," said the lady, "but Mr. Boncassen has, I think, just\r\ngone out."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! and where is Isabel?"\r\n\r\n"Isabel is downstairs,--that is if she hasn\'t gone out too. She did\r\ntalk of going with her father to the Museum. She is getting quite\r\nbookish. She has got a ticket, and goes there, and has all the things\r\nbrought to her just like the other learned folks."\r\n\r\n"I am anxious to see her, Mrs. Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"My! If she has gone out it will be a pity. She was only saying\r\nyesterday she wouldn\'t wonder if you shouldn\'t turn up."\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'ve turned up, Mrs. Boncassen. I was here an hour ago."\r\n\r\n"Was it you who called and asked all them questions? My! We couldn\'t\r\nmake out who it was. The man said it was a flurried young gentleman\r\nwho wouldn\'t leave a card,--but who wanted to see Mr. Boncassen most\r\nespecial."\r\n\r\n"It was Isabel I wanted to see. Didn\'t I leave a card? No; I don\'t\r\nthink I did. I felt so--almost at home, that I didn\'t think of a\r\ncard."\r\n\r\n"That\'s very kind of you, Lord Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"I hope you are going to be my friend, Mrs. Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I don\'t know, Lord Silverbridge. Isabel is most used to\r\nhaving her own way, I guess. I think when hearts are joined almost\r\nnothing ought to stand between them. But Mr. Boncassen does have\r\ndoubts. He don\'t wish as Isabel should force herself anywhere. But\r\nhere she is, and now she can speak for herself." Whereupon not only\r\ndid Isabel enter the room, but at the same time Mrs. Boncassen most\r\ndiscreetly left it. It must be confessed that American mothers are\r\nnot afraid of their daughters.\r\n\r\nSilverbridge, when the door was closed, stood looking at the girl\r\nfor a moment and thought that she was more lovely than ever. She was\r\ndressed for walking. She still had on her fur jacket, but had taken\r\noff her hat. "I was in the parlour downstairs," she said, "when you\r\ncame in, with papa; and we were going out together; but when I heard\r\nwho was here, I made him go alone. Was I not good?"\r\n\r\nHe had not thought of a word to say, or a thing to do;--but he felt\r\nas he looked at her that the only thing in the world worth living\r\nfor, was to have her for his own. For a moment he was half abashed.\r\nThen in the next she was close in his arms with his lips pressed\r\nto hers. He had been so sudden that she had been unable, at any\r\nrate thought that she had been unable, to repress him. "Lord\r\nSilverbridge," she said, "I told you I would not have it. You have\r\noffended me."\r\n\r\n"Isabel!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; Isabel! Isabel is offended with you. Why did you do it?"\r\n\r\nWhy did he do it? It seemed to him to be the most unnecessary\r\nquestion. "I want you to know how I love you."\r\n\r\n"Will that tell me? That only tells me how little you think of me."\r\n\r\n"Then it tells you a falsehood;--for I am thinking of you always.\r\nAnd I always think of you as being the best and dearest and sweetest\r\nthing in the world. And now I think you dearer and sweeter than\r\never." Upon this she tried to frown; but her frown at once broke out\r\ninto a smile. "When I wrote to say that I was coming why did you not\r\nstay at home for me this morning?"\r\n\r\n"I got no letter, Lord Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you get it?"\r\n\r\n"That I cannot say, Lord Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"Isabel, if you are so formal, you will kill me."\r\n\r\n"Lord Silverbridge, if you are so forward, you will offend me."\r\nThen it turned out that no letter from him had reached the house;\r\nand as the letter had been addressed to Bruton Street instead of\r\nBrook Street, the failure on the part of the post-office was not\r\nsurprising.\r\n\r\nWhether or no she were offended or he killed he remained with her the\r\nwhole of that afternoon. "Of course I love you," she said. "Do you\r\nsuppose I should be here with you if I did not, or that you could\r\nhave remained in the house after what you did just now? I am not\r\ngiven to run into rhapsodies quite so much as you are,--and being a\r\nwoman perhaps it is as well that I don\'t. But I think I can be quite\r\nas true to you as you are to me."\r\n\r\n"I am so much obliged to you for that," he said, grasping at her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"But I am sure that rhapsodies won\'t do any good. Now I\'ll tell you\r\nmy mind."\r\n\r\n"You know mine," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I will take it for granted that I do. Your mind is to marry me will\r\nye nill ye, as the people say." He answered this by merely nodding\r\nhis head and getting a little nearer to her. "That is all very well\r\nin its way, and I am not going to say but what I am gratified." Then\r\nhe did grasp her hand. "If it pleases you to hear me say so, Lord\r\nSilverbridge--"\r\n\r\n"Not Lord!"\r\n\r\n"Then I shall call you Plantagenet;--only it sounds so horribly\r\nhistorical. Why are you not Thomas or Abraham? But if it will please\r\nyou to hear me say so, I am ready to acknowledge that nothing in all\r\nmy life ever came near to the delight I have in your love." Hereupon\r\nhe almost succeeded in getting his arm round her waist. But she was\r\nstrong, and seized his hand and held it. "And I speak no rhapsodies.\r\nI tell you a truth which I want you to know and to keep in your\r\nheart,--so that you may be always, always sure of it."\r\n\r\n"I never will doubt it."\r\n\r\n"But that marrying will ye nill ye, will not suit me. There is so\r\nmuch wanted for happiness in life."\r\n\r\n"I will do all that I can."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Even though it be hazardous, I am willing to trust you. If you\r\nwere as other men are, if you could do as you please as lower men may\r\ndo, I would leave father and mother and my own country,--that I might\r\nbe your wife. I would do that because I love you. But what will my\r\nlife be here, if they who are your friends turn their backs upon me?\r\nWhat will your life be, if, through all that, you continue to love\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"That will all come right."\r\n\r\n"And what will your life be, or mine," she said, going on with her\r\nown thoughts without seeming to have heard his last words, "if in\r\nsuch a condition as that you did not continue to love me?"\r\n\r\n"I should always love you."\r\n\r\n"It might be very hard:--and if once felt to be hard, then\r\nimpossible. You have not looked at it as I have done. Why should you?\r\nEven with a wife that was a trouble to you--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Isabel!"\r\n\r\nHis arm was now round her waist, but she continued speaking as though\r\nshe were not aware of the embrace. "Yes, a trouble! I shall not be\r\nalways just what I am now. Now I can be bright and pretty and hold my\r\nown with others because I am so. But are you sure,--I am not,--that I\r\nam such stuff as an English lady should be made of? If in ten years\'\r\ntime you found that others did not think so,--that, worse again, you\r\ndid not think so yourself, would you be true to me then?"\r\n\r\n"I will always be true to you."\r\n\r\nShe gently extricated herself, as though she had done so that she\r\nmight better turn round and look into his face. "Oh, my own one, who\r\ncan say of himself that it would be so? How could it be so, when you\r\nwould have all the world against you? You would still be what you\r\nare,--with a clog round your leg while at home. In Parliament, among\r\nyour friends, at your clubs, you would be just what you are. You\r\nwould be that Lord Silverbridge who had all good things at his\r\ndisposal,--except that he had been unfortunate in his marriage! But\r\nwhat should I be?" Though she paused he could not answer her,--not\r\nyet. There was a solemnity in her speech which made it necessary that\r\nhe should hear her to the end. "I, too, have my friends in my own\r\ncountry. It is no disgrace to me there that my grandfather worked on\r\nthe quays. No one holds her head higher than I do, or is more sure\r\nof being able to hold it. I have there that assurance of esteem and\r\nhonour which you have here. I would lose it all to do you a good. But\r\nI will not lose it to do you an injury."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about injuries," he said, getting up and walking about\r\nthe room. "But I am sure of this. You will have to be my wife."\r\n\r\n"If your father will take me by the hand and say that I shall be his\r\ndaughter, I will risk all the rest. Even then it might not be wise;\r\nbut we love each other too well not to run some peril. Do you think\r\nthat I want anything better than to preside in your home, to soften\r\nyour cares, to welcome your joys, to be the mother perhaps of your\r\nchildren, and to know that you are proud that I should be so? No, my\r\ndarling. I can see a Paradise;--only, only, I may not be fit to enter\r\nit. I must use some judgment better than my own, sounder, dear, than\r\nyours. Tell the Duke what I say;--tell him with what language a son\r\nmay use to his father. And remember that all you ask for yourself you\r\nwill ask doubly for me."\r\n\r\n"I will ask him so that he cannot refuse me."\r\n\r\n"If you do I shall be contented. And now go. I have said ever so\r\nmuch, and I am tired."\r\n\r\n"Isabel! Oh, my love!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; Isabel;--your love! I am that at any rate for the present,--and\r\nproud to be so as a queen. Well, if it must be, this once,--as I have\r\nbeen so hard to you." Then she gave him her cheek to kiss, but of\r\ncourse he took more than she gave.\r\n\r\nWhen he got out into the street it was dark and there was still\r\nstanding the faithful cab. But he felt that at the present moment it\r\nwould be impossible to sit still, and he dismissed the equipage. He\r\nwalked rapidly along Brook Street into Park Lane, and from thence to\r\nthe park, hardly knowing whither he went in the enthusiasm of the\r\nmoment. He walked back to the Marble Arch, and thence round by the\r\ndrive to the Guard House and the bridge over the Serpentine, by the\r\nKnightsbridge Barracks to Hyde Park Corner. Though he should give\r\nup everything and go and live in her own country with her, he would\r\nmarry her. His politics, his hunting, his address to the Queen, his\r\nhorses, his guns, his father\'s wealth, and his own rank,--what were\r\nthey all to Isabel Boncassen? In meeting her he had met the one human\r\nbeing in all the world who could really be anything to him either\r\nin friendship or in love. When she had told him what she would do\r\nfor him to make his home happy, it had seemed to him that all other\r\ndelights must fade away from him for ever. How odious were Tifto and\r\nhis racehorses, how unmeaning the noise of his club, how terrible the\r\ntedium of those parliamentary benches! He could not tell his love as\r\nshe had told hers! He acknowledged to himself that his words could\r\nnot be as her words,--nor his intellect as hers. But his heart could\r\nbe as true. She had spoken to him of his name, his rank, and all his\r\noutside world around him. He would make her understand at last that\r\nthey were nothing to him in comparison with her. When he had got\r\nround to Hyde Park Corner, he felt that he was almost compelled to go\r\nback again to Brook Street. In no other place could there be anything\r\nto interest him;--nowhere else could there be light, or warmth, or\r\njoy! But what would she think of him? To go back hot, and soiled with\r\nmud, in order that he might say one more adieu,--that possibly he\r\nmight ravish one more kiss,--would hardly be manly. He must postpone\r\nall that for the morrow. On the morrow of course he would be there.\r\n\r\nBut his work was all before him! That prayer had to be made to his\r\nfather; or rather some wonderful effort of eloquence must be made by\r\nwhich his father might be convinced that this girl was so infinitely\r\nsuperior to anything of feminine creation that had ever hitherto been\r\nseen or heard of, that all ideas as to birth, country, rank, or name\r\nought in this instance to count for nothing. He did believe himself\r\nthat he had found such a pearl, that no question of setting need be\r\ntaken into consideration. If the Duke would not see it the fault\r\nwould be in the Duke\'s eyes, or perhaps in his own words,--but\r\ncertainly not in the pearl.\r\n\r\nThen he compared her to poor Lady Mabel, and in doing so did arrive\r\nat something near the truth in his inward delineation of the two\r\ncharacters. Lady Mabel with all her grace, with all her beauty, with\r\nall her talent, was a creature of efforts, or, as it might be called,\r\na manufactured article. She strove to be graceful, to be lovely, to\r\nbe agreeable and clever. Isabel was all this and infinitely more\r\nwithout any struggle. When he was most fond of Mabel, most anxious\r\nto make her his wife, there had always been present to him a feeling\r\nthat she was old. Though he knew her age to a day,--and knew her to\r\nbe younger than himself, yet she was old. Something had gone of her\r\nnative bloom, something had been scratched and chipped from the first\r\nfair surface, and this had been repaired by varnish and veneering.\r\nThough he had loved her he had never been altogether satisfied with\r\nher. But Isabel was as young as Hebe. He knew nothing of her actual\r\nyears, but he did know that to have seemed younger, or to have seemed\r\nolder,--to have seemed in any way different from what she was,--would\r\nhave been to be less perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX\r\n\r\n"Pert Poppet!"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a Sunday morning,--while Lord Silverbridge was alone in a certain\r\napartment in the house in Carlton Terrace which was called his own\r\nsitting-room, the name was brought him of a gentleman who was anxious\r\nto see him. He had seen his father and had used all the eloquence\r\nof which he was master,--but not quite with the effect which\r\nhe had desired. His father had been very kind, but he, too,\r\nhad been eloquent;--and had, as is often the case with orators,\r\nbeen apparently more moved by his own words than by those of his\r\nadversary. If he had not absolutely declared himself as irrevocably\r\nhostile to Miss Boncassen he had not said a word that might be\r\nsupposed to give token of assent.\r\n\r\nSilverbridge, therefore, was moody, contemplative, and desirous of\r\nsolitude. Nothing that the Duke had said had shaken him. He was\r\nstill sure of his pearl, and quite determined that he would wear it.\r\nVarious thoughts were running through his brain. What if he were to\r\nabdicate the title and become a republican? He was inclined to think\r\nthat he could not abdicate, but he was quite sure that no one could\r\nprevent him from going to America and calling himself Mr. Palliser.\r\nThat his father would forgive him and accept the daughter-in-law\r\nbrought to him, were he in the first place to marry without sanction,\r\nhe felt quite sure. What was there that his father would not forgive?\r\nBut then Isabel would not assent to this. He was turning it all in\r\nhis head and ever and anon trying to relieve his mind by "Clarissa,"\r\nwhich he was reading in conformity with his father\'s advice, when the\r\ngentleman\'s card was put into his hand. "Whatever does he want here?"\r\nhe said to himself; and then he ordered that the gentleman might\r\nbe shown up. The gentleman in question was our old friend Dolly\r\nLongstaff. Dolly Longstaff and Silverbridge had been intimate as\r\nyoung men are. But they were not friends, nor, as far as Silverbridge\r\nknew, had Dolly ever set his foot in that house before. "Well,\r\nDolly," said he, "what\'s the matter now?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose you are surprised to see me?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t think that you were ever up so early." It was at this time\r\nalmost noon.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come now, that\'s nonsense. I can get up as early as anybody\r\nelse. I have changed all that for the last four months. I was at\r\nbreakfast this morning very soon after ten."\r\n\r\n"What a miracle! Is there anything I can do for you?"\r\n\r\n"Well yes,--there is. Of course you are surprised to see me?"\r\n\r\n"You never were here before; and therefore it is odd."\r\n\r\n"It is odd; I felt that myself. And when I tell you what I have come\r\nabout you will think it more odd. I know I can trust you with a\r\nsecret."\r\n\r\n"That depends, Dolly."\r\n\r\n"What I mean is, I know you are good-natured. There are ever so many\r\nfellows that are one\'s most intimate friends, that would say anything\r\non earth they could that was ill-natured."\r\n\r\n"I hope they are not my friends."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, they are. Think of Glasslough, or Popplecourt, or Hindes!\r\nIf they knew anything about you that you didn\'t want to have\r\nknown,--about a young lady or anything of that kind,--don\'t you think\r\nthey\'d tell everybody?"\r\n\r\n"A man can\'t tell anything he doesn\'t know."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true. I had thought of that myself. But then there\'s a\r\nparticular reason for my telling you this. It is about a young lady!\r\nYou won\'t tell; will you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t. But I can\'t see why on earth you should come to me. You\r\nare ever so many years older than I am."\r\n\r\n"I had thought of that too. But you are just the person I must tell.\r\nI want you to help me."\r\n\r\nThese last words were said in a whisper, and Dolly as he said them\r\nhad drawn nearer to his friend. Silverbridge remained in suspense,\r\nsaying nothing by way of encouragement. Dolly, either in love\r\nwith his own mystery or doubtful of his own purpose, sat still,\r\nlooking eagerly at his companion. "What the mischief is it?" asked\r\nSilverbridge impatiently.\r\n\r\n"I have quite made up my own mind."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good thing at any rate."\r\n\r\n"I am not what you would have called a marrying sort of man."\r\n\r\n"I should have said,--no. But I suppose most men do marry sooner or\r\nlater."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I said to myself. It has to be done, you know.\r\nThere are three different properties coming to me. At least one has\r\ncome already."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a lucky fellow."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve made up my mind; and when I say a thing I mean to do it."\r\n\r\n"But what can I do?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I\'m coming to. If a man does marry I think he ought\r\nto be attached to her." To this, as a broad proposition, Silverbridge\r\nwas ready to accede. But, regarding Dolly as a middle-aged sort of\r\nfellow, one of those men who marry because it is convenient to have\r\na house kept for them, he simply nodded his head. "I am awfully\r\nattached to her," Dolly went on to say.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right."\r\n\r\n"Of course there are fellows who marry girls for their money. I\'ve\r\nknown men who have married their grandmothers."\r\n\r\n"Not really!"\r\n\r\n"That kind of thing. When a woman is old it does not much matter who\r\nshe is. But my one! She\'s not old!"\r\n\r\n"Nor rich?"\r\n\r\n"Well; I don\'t know about that. But I\'m not after her money. Pray\r\nunderstand that. It\'s because I\'m downright fond of her. She\'s an\r\nAmerican."\r\n\r\n"A what!" said Silverbridge, startled.\r\n\r\n"You know her. That\'s the reason I\'ve come to you. It\'s Miss\r\nBoncassen." A dark frown came across the young man\'s face. That all\r\nthis should be said to him was disgusting. That an owl like that\r\nshould dare to talk of loving Miss Boncassen was offensive to him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s because you know her that I\'ve come to you. She thinks that\r\nyou\'re after her." Dolly as he said this lifted himself quickly up\r\nin his seat, and nodded his head mysteriously as he looked into his\r\ncompanion\'s face. It was as much as though he should say, "I see you\r\nare surprised, but so it is." Then he went on. "She does, the pert\r\npoppet!" This was almost too much for Silverbridge; but still he\r\ncontained himself. "She won\'t look at me because she has got it into\r\nher head that perhaps some day she may be Duchess of Omnium! That of\r\ncourse is out of the question."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word all this seems to me to be so very--very,--distasteful\r\nthat I think you had better say nothing more about it."\r\n\r\n"It is distasteful," said Dolly; "but the truth is I am so\r\ndownright,--what you may call enamoured--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk such stuff as that here," said Silverbridge, jumping up.\r\n"I won\'t have it."\r\n\r\n"But I am. There is nothing I wouldn\'t do to get her. Of course it\'s\r\na good match for her. I\'ve got three separate properties; and when\r\nthe governor goes off I shall have a clear fifteen thousand a year."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother!"\r\n\r\n"Of course that\'s nothing to you, but it is a very tidy income for a\r\ncommoner. And how is she to do better?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how she could do much worse," said Silverbridge in a\r\ntransport of rage. Then he pulled his moustache in vexation, angry\r\nwith himself that he should have allowed himself to say even a\r\nword on so preposterous a supposition. Isabel Boncassen and Dolly\r\nLongstaff! It was Titania and Bottom over again. It was absolutely\r\nnecessary that he should get rid of this intruder, and he began to be\r\nafraid that he could not do this without using language which would\r\nbe uncivil. "Upon my word," he said, "I think you had better not talk\r\nabout it any more. The young lady is one for whom I have a very great\r\nrespect."\r\n\r\n"I mean to marry her," said Dolly, thinking thus to vindicate\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"You might as well think of marrying one of the stars."\r\n\r\n"One of the stars!"\r\n\r\n"Or a royal princess!"\r\n\r\n"Well! Perhaps that is your opinion, but I can\'t say that I agree\r\nwith you. I don\'t see why she shouldn\'t take me. I can give her a\r\nposition which you may call Al out of the Peerage. I can bring her\r\ninto society. I can make an English lady of her."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t make anything of her,--except to insult her,--and me too\r\nby talking of her."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite understand this," said the unfortunate lover, getting\r\nup from his seat. "Very likely she won\'t have me. Perhaps she has\r\ntold you so."\r\n\r\n"She never mentioned your name to me in her life. I don\'t suppose she\r\nremembers your existence."\r\n\r\n"But I say that there can be no insult in such a one as me asking\r\nsuch a one as her to be my wife. To say that she doesn\'t remember my\r\nexistence is absurd."\r\n\r\n"Why should I be troubled with all this?"\r\n\r\n"Because I think you\'re making a fool of her, and because I\'m honest.\r\nThat\'s why," said Dolly with much energy. There was something in this\r\nwhich partly reconciled Silverbridge to his despised rival. There was\r\na touch of truth about the man, though he was so utterly mistaken in\r\nhis ideas. "I want you to give over in order that I may try again. I\r\ndon\'t think you ought to keep a girl from her promotion, merely for\r\nthe fun of a flirtation. Perhaps you\'re fond of her;--but you won\'t\r\nmarry her. I am fond of her, and I shall."\r\n\r\nAfter a minute\'s pause Silverbridge resolved that he would be\r\nmagnanimous. "Miss Boncassen is going to be my wife," he said.\r\n\r\n"Your wife!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--my wife. And now I think you will see that nothing further can\r\nbe said about this matter."\r\n\r\n"Duchess of Omnium!"\r\n\r\n"She will be Lady Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"Oh; of course she\'ll be that first. Then I\'ve got nothing further\r\nto say. I\'m not going to enter myself to run against you. Only I\r\nshouldn\'t have believed it if anybody else had told me."\r\n\r\n"Such is my good fortune."\r\n\r\n"Oh ah,--yes; of course. That is one way of looking at it. Well;\r\nSilverbridge, I\'ll tell you what I shall do; I shall hook it."\r\n\r\n"No; no, not you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I shall. I dare say you won\'t believe me, but I\'ve got such a\r\nfeeling about me here"--as he said this he laid his hand upon his\r\nheart,--"that if I stayed I should go in for hard drinking. I shall\r\ntake the great Asiatic tour. I know a fellow that wants to go, but\r\nhe hasn\'t got any money. I dare say I shall be off before the end of\r\nnext month. You don\'t know any fellow that would buy half-a-dozen\r\nhunters; do you?" Silverbridge shook his head. "Good-bye," said Dolly\r\nin a melancholy tone; "I am sure I am very much obliged to you for\r\ntelling me. If I\'d known you\'d meant it, I shouldn\'t have meddled, of\r\ncourse. Duchess of Omnium!"\r\n\r\n"Look here, Dolly, I have told you what I should not have told any\r\none, but I wanted to screen the young lady\'s name."\r\n\r\n"It was so kind of you."\r\n\r\n"Do not repeat it. It is a kind of thing that ladies are particular\r\nabout. They choose their own time for letting everybody know." Then\r\nDolly promised to be as mute as a fish, and took his departure.\r\n\r\nSilverbridge had felt, towards the end of the interview, that he\r\nhad been arrogant to the unfortunate man,--particularly in saying\r\nthat the young lady would not remember the existence of such a\r\nsuitor,--and had also recognised a certain honesty in the man\'s\r\npurpose, which had not been the less honest because it was so absurd.\r\nActuated by the consciousness of this, he had swallowed his anger,\r\nand had told the whole truth. Nevertheless things had been said which\r\nwere horrible to him. This buffoon of a man had called his Isabel\r\na--pert poppet! How was he to get over the remembrance of such an\r\noffence? And then the wretch had declared that he was--enamoured!\r\nThere was sacrilege in the term when applied by such a man to Isabel\r\nBoncassen. He had thoughts of days to come, when everything would\r\nbe settled, when he might sit close to her, and call her pretty\r\nnames,--when he might in sweet familiarity tell her that she was a\r\nlittle Yankee and a fierce republican, and "chaff" her about the\r\nstars and stripes; and then, as he pictured the scene to himself in\r\nhis imagination, she would lean upon him and would give him back\r\nhis chaff, and would call him an aristocrat and would laugh at his\r\ntitles. As he thought of all this he would be proud with the feeling\r\nthat such privileges would be his own. And now this wretched man had\r\ncalled her a pert poppet!\r\n\r\nThere was a sanctity about her,--a divinity which made it almost a\r\nprofanity to have talked about her at all to such a one as Dolly\r\nLongstaff. She was his Holy of Holies, at which vulgar eyes should\r\nnot even be allowed to gaze. It had been a most unfortunate\r\ninterview. But this was clear; that, as he had announced his\r\nengagement to such a one as Dolly Longstaff, the matter now would\r\nadmit of no delay. He would explain to his father that as tidings of\r\nthe engagement had got abroad, honour to the young lady would compel\r\nhim to come forward openly as her suitor at once. If this argument\r\nmight serve him, then perhaps this intrusion would not have been\r\naltogether a misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX\r\n\r\n"Love May Be a Great Misfortune"\r\n\r\n\r\nSilverbridge when he reached Brook Street that day was surprised to\r\nfind that a large party was going to lunch there. Isabel had asked\r\nhim to come, and he had thought her the dearest girl in the world\r\nfor doing so. But now his gratitude for that favour was considerably\r\nabated. He did not care just now for the honour of eating his lunch\r\nin the presence of Mr. Gotobed, the American minister, whom he found\r\nthere already in the drawing-room with Mrs. Gotobed, nor with Ezekiel\r\nSevenkings, the great American poet from the far West, who sat silent\r\nand stared at him in an unpleasant way. When Sir Timothy Beeswax was\r\nannounced, with Lady Beeswax and her daughter, his gratification\r\ncertainly was not increased. And the last comer,--who did not arrive\r\nindeed till they were all seated at the table,--almost made him start\r\nfrom his chair and take his departure suddenly. That last comer was\r\nno other than Mr. Adolphus Longstaff. As it happened he was seated\r\nnext to Dolly, with Lady Beeswax on the other side of him. Whereas\r\nhis Holy of Holies was on the other side of Dolly! The arrangement\r\nmade seemed to him to have been monstrous. He had endeavoured to get\r\nnext to Isabel; but she had so manoeuvred that there should be a\r\nvacant chair between them. He had not much regarded this because a\r\nvacant chair may be pushed on one side. But before he had made all\r\nhis calculations Dolly Longstaff was sitting there! He almost thought\r\nthat Dolly winked at him in triumph,--that very Dolly who an hour ago\r\nhad promised to take himself off upon his Asiatic travels!\r\n\r\nSir Timothy and the minister kept up the conversation very much\r\nbetween them, Sir Timothy flattering everything that was American,\r\nand the minister finding fault with very many things that were\r\nEnglish. Now and then Mr. Boncassen would put in a word to soften\r\nthe severe honesty of his countryman, or to correct the euphemistic\r\nfalsehoods of Sir Timothy. The poet seemed always to be biding his\r\ntime. Dolly ventured to whisper a word to his neighbour. It was but\r\nto say that the frost had broken up. But Silverbridge heard it and\r\nlooked daggers at everyone. Then Lady Beeswax expressed to him a hope\r\nthat he was going to do great things in Parliament this Session. "I\r\ndon\'t mean to go near the place," he said, not at all conveying any\r\npurpose to which he had really come, but driven by the stress of the\r\nmoment to say something that should express his general hatred of\r\neverybody. Mr. Lupton was there, on the other side of Isabel, and\r\nwas soon engaged with her in a pleasant familiar conversation. Then\r\nSilverbridge remembered that he had always thought Lupton to be a\r\nmost conceited prig. Nobody gave himself so many airs, or was so\r\ncareful as to the dyeing of his whiskers. It was astonishing that\r\nIsabel should allow herself to be amused by such an antiquated\r\ncoxcomb. When they had finished eating they moved about and changed\r\ntheir places, Mr. Boncassen being rather anxious to stop the flood of\r\nAmerican eloquence which came from his friend Mr. Gotobed. British\r\nviands had become subject to his criticism, and Mr. Gotobed had\r\ndeclared to Mr. Lupton that he didn\'t believe that London could\r\nproduce a dish of squash or tomatoes. He was quite sure you couldn\'t\r\nhave sweet corn. Then there had been a moving of seats in which the\r\nminister was shuffled off to Lady Beeswax, and the poet found himself\r\nby the side of Isabel. "Do you not regret our mountains and our\r\nprairies," said the poet; "our great waters and our green savannahs?"\r\n"I think more perhaps of Fifth Avenue," said Miss Boncassen.\r\nSilverbridge, who at this moment was being interrogated by Sir\r\nTimothy, heard every word of it.\r\n\r\n"I was so sorry, Lord Silverbridge," said Sir Timothy, "that you\r\ncould not accede to our little request."\r\n\r\n"I did not quite see my way," said Silverbridge, with his eye upon\r\nIsabel.\r\n\r\n"So I understood, but I hope that things will make themselves clearer\r\nto you shortly. There is nothing that I desire so much as the support\r\nof young men such as yourself,--the very cream, I may say, of the\r\nwhole country. It is to the young conservative thoughtfulness and the\r\ntruly British spirit of our springing aristocracy that I look for\r\nthat reaction which I am sure will at last carry us safely over the\r\nrocks and shoals of communistic propensities."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder if it did," said Silverbridge. They didn\'t think\r\nthat he was going to remain down there talking politics to an old\r\nhumbug like Sir Timothy when the sun, and moon, and all the stars had\r\ngone up into the drawing-room! For at that moment Isabel was making\r\nher way to the door.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Timothy had buttonholed him. "Of course it is late now to\r\nsay anything further about the address. We have arranged that. Not\r\nquite as I would have wished, for I had set my heart upon initiating\r\nyou into the rapturous pleasure of parliamentary debate. But I\r\nhope that a good time is coming. And pray remember this, Lord\r\nSilverbridge;--there is no member sitting on our side of the House,\r\nand I need hardly say on the other, whom I would go farther to oblige\r\nthan your father\'s son."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure that\'s very kind," said Silverbridge, absolutely using a\r\nlittle force as he disengaged himself. Then he at once followed the\r\nladies upstairs, passing the poet on the stairs. "You have hardly\r\nspoken to me," he whispered to Isabel. He knew that to whisper to her\r\nnow, with the eyes of many upon him, with the ears of many open, was\r\nan absurdity; but he could not refrain himself.\r\n\r\n"There are so many to be,--entertained, as people say! I don\'t think\r\nI ought to have to entertain you," she answered, laughing. No one\r\nheard her but Silverbridge, yet she did not seem to whisper. She left\r\nhim, however, at once, and was soon engaged in conversation with Sir\r\nTimothy.\r\n\r\nA convivial lunch I hold to be altogether bad, but the worst of its\r\nmany evils is that vacillating mind which does not know when to take\r\nits owner off. Silverbridge was on this occasion quite determined not\r\nto take himself off at all. As it was only a lunch the people must\r\ngo, and then he would be left with Isabel. But the vacillation of the\r\nothers was distressing to him. Mr. Lupton went, and poor Dolly got\r\naway apparently without a word. But the Beeswaxes and the Gotobeds\r\nwould not go, and the poet sat staring immovably. In the meanwhile\r\nSilverbridge endeavoured to make the time pass lightly by talking to\r\nMrs. Boncassen. He had been so determined to accept Isabel with all\r\nher adjuncts that he had come almost to like Mrs. Boncassen, and\r\nwould certainly have taken her part violently had any one spoken ill\r\nof her in his presence.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he found that the room was nearly empty. The Beeswaxes\r\nand the Gotobeds were gone; and at last the poet himself, with a\r\nfinal glare of admiration at Isabel, had taken his departure. When\r\nSilverbridge looked round, Isabel also was gone. Then too Mrs.\r\nBoncassen had left the room suddenly. At the same instant Mr.\r\nBoncassen entered by another door, and the two men were alone\r\ntogether. "My dear Lord Silverbridge," said the father, "I want to\r\nhave a few words with you." Of course there was nothing for him but\r\nto submit. "You remember what you said to me down at Matching?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; I remember that."\r\n\r\n"You did me the great honour of expressing a wish to make my child\r\nyour wife."\r\n\r\n"I was asking for a very great favour."\r\n\r\n"That also;--for there is no greater favour I could do to any man\r\nthan to give him my daughter. Nevertheless, you were doing me a great\r\nhonour,--and you did it, as you do everything, with an honest grace\r\nthat went far to win my heart. I am not at all surprised, sir, that\r\nyou should have won hers." The young man as he heard this could only\r\nblush and look foolish. "If I know my girl, neither your money nor\r\nyour title would go for anything."\r\n\r\n"I think much more of her love, Mr. Boncassen, than I do of anything\r\nelse in the world."\r\n\r\n"But love, my Lord, may be a great misfortune." As he said this the\r\ntone of his voice was altered, and there was a melancholy solemnity\r\nnot only in his words but in his countenance. "I take it that young\r\npeople when they love rarely think of more than the present moment.\r\nIf they did so the bloom would be gone from their romance. But others\r\nhave to do this for them. If Isabel had come to me saying that she\r\nloved a poor man, there would not have been much to disquiet me. A\r\npoor man may earn bread for himself and his wife, and if he failed I\r\ncould have found them bread. Nor, had she loved somewhat below her\r\nown degree, should I have opposed her. So long as her husband had\r\nbeen an educated man, there might have been no future punishment to\r\nfear."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she could have done that," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"At any rate she has not done so. But how am I to look upon this that\r\nshe has done?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do my best for her, Mr. Boncassen."\r\n\r\n"I believe you would. But even your love can\'t make her an\r\nEnglishwoman. You can make her a Duchess."\r\n\r\n"Not that, sir."\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t give her a parentage fit for a Duchess;--not fit at\r\nleast in the opinion of those with whom you will pass your life, with\r\nwhom,--or perhaps without whom,--she will be destined to pass her\r\nlife, if she becomes your wife! Unfortunately it does not suffice\r\nthat you should think it fit. Though you loved each other as well as\r\nany man and woman that ever were brought into each other\'s arms by\r\nthe beneficence of God, you cannot make her happy,--unless you can\r\nassure her the respect of those around her."\r\n\r\n"All the world will respect her."\r\n\r\n"Her conduct,--yes. I think the world, your world, would learn to\r\ndo that. I do not think it could help itself. But that would not\r\nsuffice. I may respect the man who cleans my boots. But he would be\r\na wretched man if he were thrown on me for society. I would not give\r\nhim my society. Will your Duchesses and your Countesses give her\r\ntheirs?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly they will."\r\n\r\n"I do not ask for it as thinking it to be of more value than that of\r\nothers; but were she to become your wife she would be so abnormally\r\nplaced as to require it for her comfort. She would have become a lady\r\nof high rank,--not because she loves rank, but because she loves\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, yes," said Silverbridge, hardly himself knowing why he\r\nbecame impetuous.\r\n\r\n"But having removed herself into that position, being as she would\r\nbe, a Countess, or a Duchess, or what not, how could she be happy if\r\nshe were excluded from the community of Countesses and Duchesses?"\r\n\r\n"They are not like that," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I will not say that they are, but I do not know. Having Anglican\r\ntendencies, I have been wont to contradict my countrymen when they\r\nhave told me of the narrow exclusiveness of your nobles. Having found\r\nyour nobles and your commoners all alike in their courtesy,--which\r\nis a cold word; in their hospitable friendships,--I would now not\r\nonly contradict, but would laugh to scorn any such charge,"--so\r\nfar he spoke somewhat loudly, and then dropped his voice as he\r\nconcluded,--"were it anything less than the happiness of my child\r\nthat is in question."\r\n\r\n"What am I to say, sir? I only know this; I am not going to lose\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"You are a fine fellow. I was going to say that I wished you were an\r\nAmerican, so that Isabel need not lose you. But, my boy, I have told\r\nyou that I do not know how it might be. Of all whom you know, who\r\ncould best tell me the truth on such a subject? Who is there whose\r\nage will have given him experience, whose rank will have made him\r\nfamiliar with this matter, who from friendship to you would be least\r\nlikely to decide against your wishes, who from his own native honesty\r\nwould be most sure to tell the truth?"\r\n\r\n"You mean my father," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I do mean your father. Happily he has taken no dislike to the girl\r\nherself. I have seen enough of him to feel sure that he is devoted to\r\nhis own children."\r\n\r\n"Indeed he is."\r\n\r\n"A just and a liberal man;--one I should say not carried away by\r\nprejudices! Well,--my girl and I have just put our heads together,\r\nand we have come to a conclusion. If the Duke of Omnium will tell us\r\nthat she would be safe as your wife,--safe from the contempt of those\r\naround her,--you shall have her. And I shall rejoice to give her to\r\nyou,--not because you are Lord Silverbridge, not because of your rank\r\nand wealth; but because you are--that individual human being whom I\r\nnow hold by the hand."\r\n\r\nWhen the American had come to an end, Silverbridge was too much moved\r\nto make any immediate answer. He had an idea in his own mind that\r\nthe appeal was not altogether fair. His father was a just man,--just,\r\naffectionate, and liberal. But then it will so often happen that\r\nfathers do not want their sons to marry those very girls on whom the\r\nsons have set their hearts. He could only say that he would speak\r\nto his father again on the subject. "Let him tell me that he is\r\ncontented," said Mr. Boncassen, "and I will tell him that I am\r\ncontented. Now, my friend, good-bye." Silverbridge begged that he\r\nmight be allowed to see Isabel before he was turned out; but Isabel\r\nhad left the house in company with her mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI\r\n\r\n"What Am I to Say, Sir?"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Silverbridge left Mr. Boncassen\'s house he was resolved to go to\r\nhis father without an hour\'s delay, and represent to the Duke exactly\r\nhow the case stood. He would be urgent, piteous, submissive, and\r\neloquent. In any other matter he would promise to make whatever\r\narrangements his father might desire. He would make his father\r\nunderstand that all his happiness depended on this marriage. When\r\nonce married he would settle down, even at Gatherum Castle if the\r\nDuke should wish it. He would not think of race-horses, he would\r\ndesert the Beargarden, he would learn blue-books by heart, and only\r\ndo as much shooting and hunting as would become a young nobleman in\r\nhis position. All this he would say as eagerly and as pleasantly as\r\nit might be said. But he would add to all this an assurance of his\r\nunchangeable intention. It was his purpose to marry Isabel Boncassen.\r\nIf he could do this with his father\'s good will,--so best. But at any\r\nrate he would marry her!\r\n\r\nThe world at this time was altogether busy with political rumours;\r\nand it was supposed that Sir Timothy Beeswax would do something very\r\nclever. It was supposed also that he would sever himself from some\r\nof his present companions. On that point everybody was agreed,--and\r\non that point only everybody was right. Lord Drummond, who was the\r\ntitular Prime Minister, and Sir Timothy, had, during a considerable\r\npart of the last Session, and through the whole vacation, so belarded\r\neach other with praise in all their public expressions that it was\r\nquite manifest that they had quarrelled. When any body of statesmen\r\nmake public asseverations by one or various voices, that there is no\r\ndiscord among them, not a dissentient voice on any subject, people\r\nare apt to suppose that they cannot hang together much longer. It is\r\nthe man who has no peace at home that declares abroad that his wife\r\nis an angel. He who lives on comfortable terms with the partner of\r\nhis troubles can afford to acknowledge the ordinary rubs of life. Old\r\nMr. Mildmay, who was Prime Minister for so many years, and whom his\r\nparty worshipped, used to say that he had never found a gentleman who\r\nhad quite agreed with him all round; but Sir Timothy has always been\r\nin exact accord with all his colleagues,--till he has left them, or\r\nthey him. Never had there been such concord as of late,--and men,\r\nclubs, and newspapers now protested that as a natural consequence\r\nthere would soon be a break-up.\r\n\r\nBut not on that account would it perhaps be necessary that Sir\r\nTimothy should resign,--or not necessary that his resignation should\r\nbe permanent. The Conservative majority had dwindled,--but still\r\nthere was a majority. It certainly was the case that Lord Drummond\r\ncould not get on without Sir Timothy. But might it not be possible\r\nthat Sir Timothy should get on without Lord Drummond? If so he must\r\nbegin his action in this direction by resigning. He would have to\r\nplace his resignation, no doubt with infinite regret, in the hands\r\nof Lord Drummond. But if such a step were to be taken now, just as\r\nParliament was about to assemble, what would become of the Queen\'s\r\nspeech, of the address, and of the noble peers and noble and other\r\ncommoners who were to propose and second it in the two Houses of\r\nParliament? There were those who said that such a trick played at the\r\nlast moment would be very shabby. But then again there were those who\r\nforesaw that the shabbiness would be made to rest anywhere rather\r\nthan on the shoulders of Sir Timothy. If it should turn out that he\r\nhad striven manfully to make things run smoothly;--that the Premier\'s\r\nincompetence, or the Chancellor\'s obstinacy, or this or that\r\nSecretary\'s peculiarity of temper had done it all;--might not Sir\r\nTimothy then be able to emerge from the confused flood, and swim\r\nalong pleasantly with his head higher than ever above the waters?\r\n\r\nIn these great matters parliamentary management goes for so much! If\r\na man be really clever and handy at his trade, if he can work hard\r\nand knows what he is about, if he can give and take and be not\r\nthin-skinned or sore-bored, if he can ask pardon for a peccadillo and\r\nseem to be sorry with a good grace, if above all things he be able\r\nto surround himself with the prestige of success, then so much will\r\nbe forgiven him! Great gifts of eloquence are hardly wanted, or a\r\ndeep-seated patriotism which is capable of strong indignation. A\r\nparty has to be managed, and he who can manage it best, will probably\r\nbe its best leader. The subordinate task of legislation and of\r\nexecutive government may well fall into the inferior hands of less\r\nastute practitioners. It was admitted on both sides that there was no\r\nman like Sir Timothy for managing the House or coercing a party, and\r\nthere was therefore a general feeling that it would be a pity that\r\nSir Timothy should be squeezed out. He knew all the little secrets\r\nof the business;--could arrange, let the cause be what it might,\r\nto get a full House for himself and his friends, and empty benches\r\nfor his opponents,--could foresee a thousand little things to which\r\neven a Walpole would have been blind, which a Pitt would not have\r\ncondescended to regard, but with which his familiarity made him a\r\nvery comfortable leader of the House of Commons. There were various\r\nideas prevalent as to the politics of the coming Session; but the\r\nprevailing idea was in favour of Sir Timothy.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was at Longroyston, the seat of his old political ally the\r\nDuke of St. Bungay, and had been absent from Sunday the 6th till the\r\nmorning of Friday the 11th, on which day Parliament was to meet. On\r\nthat morning at about noon a letter came to the son saying that his\r\nfather had returned and would be glad to see him. Silverbridge was\r\ngoing to the House on that day and was not without his own political\r\nanxieties. If Lord Drummond remained in, he thought that he must, for\r\nthe present, stand by the party which he had adopted. If, however,\r\nSir Timothy should become Prime Minister there would be a loophole\r\nfor escape. There were some three or four besides himself who\r\ndetested Sir Timothy, and in such case he might perhaps have company\r\nin his desertion. All this was on his mind; but through all this\r\nhe was aware that there was a matter of much deeper moment which\r\nrequired his energies. When his father\'s message was brought to him\r\nhe told himself at once that now was the time for his eloquence.\r\n\r\n"Well, Silverbridge," said the Duke, "how are matters going on with\r\nyou?" There seemed to be something in his father\'s manner more than\r\nordinarily jocund and good-humoured.\r\n\r\n"With me, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to ask any party secrets. If you and Sir Timothy\r\nunderstand each other, of course you will be discreet."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t be discreet, sir, because I don\'t know anything about him."\r\n\r\n"When I heard," said the Duke smiling, "of your being in close\r\nconference with Sir Timothy--"\r\n\r\n"I, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you. Mr. Boncassen told me that you and he were so deeply taken\r\nup with each other at his house, that nobody could get a word with\r\neither of you."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Mr. Boncassen?" asked the son, whose attention was\r\nimmediately diverted from his father\'s political badinage.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I have seen him. I happened to meet him where I was dining\r\nlast Sunday, and he walked home with me. He was so intent upon what\r\nhe was saying that I fear he allowed me to take him out of his way."\r\n\r\n"What was he talking about?" said Silverbridge. All his preparations,\r\nall his eloquence, all his method, now seemed to have departed from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"He was talking about you," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"He had told me that he wanted to see you. What did he say, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose you can guess what he said. He wished to know what I\r\nthought of the offer you have made to his daughter." The great\r\nsubject had come up so easily, so readily, that he was almost aghast\r\nwhen he found himself in the middle of it. And yet he must speak of\r\nthe matter, and that at once.\r\n\r\n"I hope you raised no objection, sir," he said.\r\n\r\n"The objection came mainly from him; and I am bound to say that every\r\nword that fell from him was spoken with wisdom."\r\n\r\n"But still he asked you to consent."\r\n\r\n"By no means. He told me his opinion,--and then he asked me a\r\nquestion."\r\n\r\n"I am sure he did not say that we ought not to be married."\r\n\r\n"He did say that he thought you ought not to be married, if--"\r\n\r\n"If what, sir?"\r\n\r\n"If there were probability that his daughter would not be well\r\nreceived as your wife. Then he asked me what would be my reception of\r\nher." Silverbridge looked up into his father\'s face with beseeching\r\nimploring eyes as though everything now depended on the next few\r\nwords that he might utter. "I shall think it an unwise marriage,"\r\ncontinued the Duke. Silverbridge when he heard this at once knew that\r\nhe had gained his cause. His father had spoken of the marriage as a\r\nthing that was to happen. A joyous light dawned in his eyes, and the\r\nlook of pain went from his brow, all which the Duke was not slow\r\nto perceive. "I shall think it an unwise marriage," he continued,\r\nrepeating his words; "but I was bound to tell him that were Miss\r\nBoncassen to become your wife she would also become my daughter."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir."\r\n\r\n"I told him why the marriage would be distasteful to me. Whether I\r\nmay be wrong or right I think it to be for the good of our country,\r\nfor the good of our order, for the good of our individual families,\r\nthat we should support each other by marriage. It is not as though we\r\nwere a narrow class, already too closely bound together by family\r\nalliances. The room for choice might be wide enough for you without\r\ngoing across the Atlantic to look for her who is to be the mother\r\nof your children. To this Mr. Boncassen replied that he was to look\r\nsolely to his daughter\'s happiness. He meant me to understand that\r\nhe cared nothing for my feelings. Why should he? That which to me is\r\ndeep wisdom is to him an empty prejudice. He asked me then how others\r\nwould receive her."\r\n\r\n"I am sure that everybody would like her," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I like her. I like her very much."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad."\r\n\r\n"But still all this is a sorrow to me. When however he put that\r\nquestion to me about the world around her,--as to those among whom\r\nher lot would be cast, I could not say that I thought she would be\r\nrejected."\r\n\r\n"Oh no!" The idea of rejecting Isabel!\r\n\r\n"She has a brightness and a grace all her own," continued the Duke,\r\n"which will ensure her acceptance in all societies."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes;--it is just that, sir."\r\n\r\n"You will be a nine days\' wonder,--the foolish young nobleman who\r\nchose to marry an American."\r\n\r\n"I think it will be just the other way up, sir,--among the men."\r\n\r\n"But her place will I think be secure to her. That is what I told Mr.\r\nBoncassen."\r\n\r\n"It is all right with him then,--now?"\r\n\r\n"If you call it all right. You will understand of course that you are\r\nacting in opposition to my advice,--and my wishes."\r\n\r\n"What am I to say, sir?" exclaimed Silverbridge, almost in despair.\r\n"When I love the girl better than my life, and when you tell me that\r\nshe can be mine if I choose to take her; when I have asked her to be\r\nmy wife, and have got her to say that she likes me; when her father\r\nhas given way, and all the rest of it, would it be possible that I\r\nshould say now that I will give her up?"\r\n\r\n"My opinion is to go for nothing,--in anything!" The Duke as he said\r\nthis knew that he was expressing aloud a feeling which should have\r\nbeen restrained within his own bosom. It was natural that there\r\nshould have been such plaints. The same suffering must be encountered\r\nin regard to Tregear and his daughter. In every way he had been\r\nthwarted. In every direction he was driven to yield. And yet now he\r\nhad to undergo rebuke from his own son, because one of those inward\r\nplaints would force itself from his lips! Of course this girl was\r\nto be taken in among the Pallisers and treated with an idolatrous\r\nlove,--as perfect as though "all the blood of all the Howards" were\r\nrunning in her veins. What further inch of ground was there for a\r\nfight? And if the fight were over, why should he rob his boy of\r\none sparkle from off the joy of his triumph? Silverbridge was now\r\nstanding before him abashed by that plaint, inwardly sustained no\r\ndoubt by the conviction of his great success, but subdued by his\r\nfather\'s wailing. "However,--perhaps we had better let that pass,"\r\nsaid the Duke, with a long sigh. Then Silverbridge took his father\'s\r\nhand, and looked up in his face. "I most sincerely hope that she may\r\nmake you a good and loving wife," said the Duke, "and that she may do\r\nher duty by you in that not easy sphere of life to which she will be\r\ncalled."\r\n\r\n"I am quite sure she will," said Silverbridge, whose ideas as to\r\nIsabel\'s duties were confined at present to a feeling that she would\r\nnow have to give him kisses without stint.\r\n\r\n"What I have seen of her personally recommends her to me," said the\r\nDuke. "Some girls are fools--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s quite true, sir."\r\n\r\n"Who think that the world is to be nothing but dancing, and going to\r\nparties."\r\n\r\n"Many have been doing it for so many years," said Silverbridge, "that\r\nthey can\'t understand that there should be an end of it."\r\n\r\n"A wife ought to feel the great responsibility of her position. I\r\nhope she will."\r\n\r\n"And the sooner she begins the better," said Silverbridge stoutly.\r\n\r\n"And now," said the Duke, looking at his watch, "we might as well\r\nhave lunch and go down to the House. I will walk with you if you\r\nplease. It will be about time for each of us." Then the son was\r\nforced to go down and witness the somewhat faded ceremony of seeing\r\nParliament opened by three Lords sitting in commission before the\r\nthrone. Whereas but for such stress as his father had laid upon him,\r\nhe would have disregarded his parliamentary duties and have rushed\r\nat once up to Brook Street. As it was he was so handed over from one\r\npolitical pundit to another, was so buttonholed by Sir Timothy, so\r\nchaffed as to the address by Phineas Finn, and at last so occupied\r\nwith the whole matter that he was compelled to sit in his place till\r\nhe had heard Nidderdale make his speech. This the young Scotch Lord\r\ndid so well, and received so much praise for the doing of it, and\r\nlooked so well in his uniform, that Silverbridge almost regretted the\r\nopportunity he had lost. At seven the sitting was over, the speeches,\r\nthough full of interest, having been shorter than usual. They had\r\nbeen full of interest, but nobody understood in the least what was\r\ngoing to happen. "I don\'t know anything about the Prime Minister,"\r\nsaid Mr. Lupton as he left the House with our hero and another not\r\nvery staunch supporter of the Government, "but I\'ll back Sir Timothy\r\nto be the Leader of the House on the last day of the Session, against\r\nall comers. I don\'t think it much matters who is Prime Minister\r\nnowadays."\r\n\r\nAt half-past seven Silverbridge was at the door in Brook Street. Yes;\r\nMiss Boncassen was at home. The servant thought that she was upstairs\r\ndressing. Then Silverbridge made his way without further invitation\r\ninto the drawing-room. There he remained alone for ten minutes.\r\nAt last the door opened, and Mrs. Boncassen entered. "Dear Lord\r\nSilverbridge, who ever dreamed of seeing you? I thought all you\r\nParliament gentlemen were going through your ceremonies. Isabel had a\r\nticket and went down, and saw your father."\r\n\r\n"Where is Isabel?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s gone."\r\n\r\n"Gone! Where on earth has she gone to?" asked Silverbridge, as though\r\nfearing lest she had been carried off to the other side of the\r\nAtlantic. Then Mrs. Boncassen explained. Within the last three\r\nminutes Mrs. Montacute Jones had called and carried Isabel off to the\r\nplay. Mrs. Jones was up in town for a week, and this had been a very\r\nold engagement. "I hope you did not want her very particularly," said\r\nMrs. Boncassen.\r\n\r\n"But I did,--most particularly," said Lord Silverbridge. The door was\r\nopened and Mr. Boncassen entered the room. "I beg your pardon for\r\ncoming at such a time," said the lover, "but I did so want to see\r\nIsabel."\r\n\r\n"I rather think she wants to see you," said the father.\r\n\r\n"I shall go to the theatre after her."\r\n\r\n"That might be awkward,--particularly as I doubt whether anybody\r\nknows what theatre they are gone to. Can I receive a message for her,\r\nmy lord?" This was certainly not what Lord Silverbridge had intended.\r\n"You know, perhaps, that I have seen the Duke."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--and I have seen him. Everything is settled."\r\n\r\n"That is the only message she will want to hear when she comes home.\r\nShe is a happy girl and I am proud to think that I should live to\r\ncall such a grand young Briton as you my son-in-law." Then the\r\nAmerican took the young man\'s two hands and shook them cordially,\r\nwhile Mrs. Boncassen bursting into tears insisted on kissing him.\r\n\r\n"Indeed she is a happy girl," said she; "but I hope Isabel won\'t be\r\ncarried away too high and mighty."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII\r\n\r\nCarlton Terrace\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days after this it was arranged that Isabel should be taken to\r\nCarlton Terrace to be accepted there into the full good graces of\r\nher future father-in-law, and to go through the pleasant ceremony\r\nof seeing the house in which it was to be her destiny to live as\r\nmistress. What can be more interesting to a girl than this first\r\nvisit to her future home? And now Isabel Boncassen was to make her\r\nfirst visit to the house in Carlton Terrace, which the Duke had\r\nalready declared his purpose of surrendering to the young couple. She\r\nwas going among very grand things,--so grand that those whose affairs\r\nin life are less magnificent may think that her mind should have\r\nsoared altogether above chairs and tables, and reposed itself among\r\ndiamonds, gold and silver ornaments, rich necklaces, the old masters,\r\nand alabaster statuary. But Dukes and Duchesses must sit upon\r\nchairs,--or at any rate on sofas,--as well as their poorer brethren,\r\nand probably have the same regard for their comfort. Isabel was not\r\nabove her future furniture, or the rooms that were to be her rooms,\r\nor the stairs which she would have to tread, or the pillow on which\r\nher head must rest. She had never yet seen even the outside of the\r\nhouse in which she was to live, and was now prepared to make her\r\nvisit with as much enthusiasm as though her future abode was to be\r\nprepared for her in a small house in a small street beyond Islington.\r\n\r\nBut the Duke was no doubt more than the house, the father-in-law\r\nmore than the tables. Isabel, in the ordinary way of society, he had\r\nalready known almost with intimacy. She, the while, had been well\r\naware that if all things could possibly be made to run smoothly with\r\nher, this lordly host, who was so pleasantly courteous to her, would\r\nbecome her father-in-law. But she had known also that he, in his\r\ncourtesy, had been altogether unaware of any such intention on her\r\npart, and that she would now present herself to him in an aspect very\r\ndifferent from that in which she had hitherto been regarded. She\r\nwas well aware that the Duke had not wished to take her into his\r\nfamily,--would not himself have chosen her for his son\'s wife. She\r\nhad seen enough to make her sure that he had even chosen another\r\nbride for his heir. She had been too clever not to perceive that Lady\r\nMabel Grex had been not only selected,--but almost accepted as though\r\nthe thing had been certain. She had learned nearly the whole truth\r\nfrom Silverbridge, who was not good at keeping a secret from one to\r\nwhom his heart was open. That story had been all but read by her with\r\nexactness. "I cannot lose you now," she had said to him, leaning on\r\nhis arm;--"I cannot afford to lose you now. But I fear that someone\r\nelse is losing you." To this he answered nothing, but simply pressed\r\nher closer to his side. "Someone else," she continued, "who perhaps\r\nmay have reason to think that you have injured her." "No," he said\r\nboldly; "no; there is no such person." For he had never ceased to\r\nassure himself that in all that matter with Mabel Grex he had been\r\nguilty of no treachery. There had been a moment, indeed, in which she\r\nmight have taken him; but she had chosen to let it pass from her. All\r\nof which, or nearly all of which,--Isabel now saw, and had seen also\r\nthat the Duke had been a consenting party to that other arrangement.\r\nShe had reason therefore to doubt the manner of her acceptance.\r\n\r\nBut she had been accepted. She had made such acceptance by him a\r\nstipulation in her acceptance of his son. She was sure of the ground\r\non which she trod and was determined to carry herself, if not with\r\npride, yet with dignity. There might be difficulties before her,\r\nbut it should not be her fault if she were not as good a Countess,\r\nand,--when time would have it so,--as good a Duchess as another.\r\n\r\nThe visit was made not quite in the fashion in which Silverbridge\r\nhimself had wished. His idea had been to call for Isabel in his cab\r\nand take her down to Carlton Terrace. "Mother must go with me,"\r\nshe had said. Then he looked blank,--as he could look when he was\r\ndisappointed, as he had looked when she would not talk to him at the\r\nlunch, when she told him that it was not her business to entertain\r\nhim. "Don\'t be selfish," she added, laughing. "Do you think that\r\nmother will not want to have seen the house that I am to live in?"\r\n\r\n"She shall come afterwards as often as she likes."\r\n\r\n"What,--paying me morning visits from New York! She must come now, if\r\nyou please. Love me, love my mother."\r\n\r\n"I am awfully fond of her," said Silverbridge, who felt that he\r\nreally had behaved well to the old lady.\r\n\r\n"So am I,--and therefore she shall go and see the house now. You are\r\nas good as gold,--and do everything just as I tell you. But a good\r\ntime is coming, when I shall have to do everything that you tell me."\r\nThen it was arranged that Mrs. and Miss Boncassen were to be taken\r\ndown to the house in their own carriage, and were to be received at\r\nthe door by Lord Silverbridge.\r\n\r\nAnother arrangement had also been made. Isabel was to be taken to the\r\nDuke immediately upon her arrival and to be left for awhile with him,\r\nalone, so that he might express himself as he might find fit to do to\r\nthis newly-adopted child. It was a matter to him of such importance\r\nthat nothing remaining to him in his life could equal it. It was not\r\nsimply that she was to be the wife of his son,--though that in itself\r\nwas a consideration very sacred. Had it been Gerald who was bringing\r\nto him a bride, the occasion would have had less of awe. But this\r\ngirl, this American girl, was to be the mother and grandmother of\r\nfuture Dukes of Omnium,--the ancestress, it was to be hoped, of all\r\nfuture Dukes of Omnium! By what she might be, by what she might have\r\nin her of mental fibre, of high or low quality, of true or untrue\r\nwomanliness, were to be fashioned those who in days to come might be\r\namongst the strongest and most faithful bulwarks of the constitution.\r\nAn England without a Duke of Omnium,--or at any rate without any\r\nDuke,--what would it be? And yet he knew that with bad Dukes his\r\ncountry would be in worse stress than though she had none at all.\r\nAn aristocracy;--yes; but an aristocracy that shall be of the very\r\nbest! He believed himself thoroughly in his order; but if his order,\r\nor many of his order, should become as was now Lord Grex, then, he\r\nthought, that his order not only must go to the wall but that, in the\r\ncause of humanity, it had better do so. With all this daily, hourly,\r\nalways in his mind, this matter of the choice of a wife for his heir\r\nwas to him of solemn importance.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived Silverbridge was there and led them first of all\r\ninto the dining-room. "My!" said Mrs. Boncassen, as she looked around\r\nher. "I thought that our Fifth Avenue parlours whipped everything in\r\nthe way of city houses."\r\n\r\n"What a nice little room for Darby and Joan to sit down to eat a\r\nmutton-chop in," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a beastly great barrack," said Silverbridge;--"but the best of\r\nit is that we never use it. We\'ll have a cosy little place for Darby\r\nand Joan;--you\'ll see. Now come to the governor. I\'ve got to leave\r\nyou with him."\r\n\r\n"Oh me! I am in such a fright."\r\n\r\n"He can\'t eat you," said Mrs. Boncassen.\r\n\r\n"And he won\'t even bite," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I should not mind that because I could bite again. But if he looks\r\nas though he thought I shouldn\'t do, I shall drop."\r\n\r\n"My belief is that he\'s almost as much in love with you as I am,"\r\nsaid Silverbridge, as he took her to the door of the Duke\'s room.\r\n"Here we are, sir."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said the Duke, rising up and coming to her, "I am very\r\nglad to see you. It is good of you to come to me." Then he took her\r\nin both his hands and kissed her forehead and her lips. She, as she\r\nput her face up to him, stood quite still in his embrace, but her\r\neyes were bright with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"Shall I leave her?" said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"For a few minutes."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t keep her too long, for I want to take her all over the house."\r\n\r\n"A few minutes,--and then I will bring her up to the drawing-room."\r\nUpon this the door was closed, and Isabel was alone with her new\r\nfather. "And so, my dear, you are to be my child."\r\n\r\n"If you will have me."\r\n\r\n"Come here and sit down by me. Your father has already told you\r\nthat;--has he not?"\r\n\r\n"He has told me that you had consented."\r\n\r\n"And Silverbridge has said as much?"\r\n\r\n"I would sooner hear it from you than from either of them."\r\n\r\n"Then hear it from me. You shall be my child. And if you will love me\r\nyou shall be very dear to me. You shall be my own child,--as dear as\r\nmy own. I must either love his wife very dearly, or else I must be an\r\nunhappy man. And she must love me dearly, or I must be unhappy."\r\n\r\n"I will love you," she said, pressing his hand.\r\n\r\n"And now let me say some few words to you, only let there be no\r\nbitterness in them to your young heart. When I say that I take you to\r\nmy heart, you may be sure that I do so thoroughly. You shall be as\r\ndear to me and as near as though you had been all English."\r\n\r\n"Shall I?"\r\n\r\n"There shall no difference be made. My boy\'s wife shall be my\r\ndaughter in very deed. But I had not wished it to be so."\r\n\r\n"I knew that;--but could I have given him up?"\r\n\r\n"He at any rate could not give you up. There were little\r\nprejudices;--you can understand that."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"We who wear black coats could not bring ourselves readily to put on\r\nscarlet garments; nor should we sit comfortably with our legs crossed\r\nlike Turks."\r\n\r\n"I am your scarlet coat and your cross-legged Turk," she said, with\r\nfeigned self-reproach in her voice, but with a sparkle of mirth in\r\nher eye.\r\n\r\n"But when I have once got into my scarlet coat I can be very proud\r\nof it, and when I am once seated in my divan I shall find it of all\r\npostures the easiest. Do you understand me?"\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"Not a shade of any prejudice shall be left to darken my mind. There\r\nshall be no feeling but that you are in truth his chosen wife. After\r\nall neither can country, nor race, nor rank, nor wealth, make a good\r\nwoman. Education can do much. But nature must have done much also."\r\n\r\n"Do not expect too much of me."\r\n\r\n"I will so expect that all shall be taken for the best. You know, I\r\nthink, that I have liked you since I first saw you."\r\n\r\n"I know that you have always been good to me."\r\n\r\n"I have liked you from the first. That you are lovely perhaps\r\nis no merit; though, to speak the truth, I am well pleased that\r\nSilverbridge should have found so much beauty."\r\n\r\n"That is all a matter of taste, I suppose," she said, laughing.\r\n\r\n"But there is much that a young woman may do for herself which I\r\nthink you have done. A silly girl, though she had been a second\r\nHelen, would hardly have satisfied me."\r\n\r\n"Or perhaps him," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Or him; and it is in that feeling that I find my chief\r\nsatisfaction,--that he should have had the sense to have liked such a\r\none as you better than others. Now I have said it. As not being one\r\nof us I did at first object to his choice. As being what you are\r\nyourself, I am altogether reconciled to it. Do not keep him long\r\nwaiting."\r\n\r\n"I do not think he likes to be kept waiting for anything."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not. I dare say not. And now there is one thing else."\r\nThen the Duke unlocked a little drawer that was close to his hand,\r\nand taking out a ring put it on her finger. It was a bar of diamonds,\r\nperhaps a dozen of them, fixed in a little circlet of gold. "This\r\nmust never leave you," he said.\r\n\r\n"It never shall,--having come from you."\r\n\r\n"It was the first present that I gave to my wife, and it is the first\r\nthat I give to you. You may imagine how sacred it is to me. On no\r\nother hand could it be worn without something which to me would be\r\nakin to sacrilege. Now I must not keep you longer or Silverbridge\r\nwill be storming about the house. He of course will tell me when it\r\nis to be; but do not you keep him long waiting." Then he kissed her\r\nand led her up into the drawing-room. When he had spoken a word of\r\ngreeting to Mrs. Boncassen, he left them to their own devices.\r\n\r\nAfter that they spent the best part of an hour in going over\r\nthe house; but even that was done in a manner unsatisfactory to\r\nSilverbridge. Wherever Isabel went, there Mrs. Boncassen went also.\r\nThere might have been some fun in showing even the back kitchens to\r\nhis bride-elect, by herself;--but there was none in wandering about\r\nthose vast underground regions with a stout lady who was really\r\ninterested with the cooking apparatus and the wash-houses. The\r\nbedrooms one after another became tedious to him when Mrs. Boncassen\r\nwould make communications respecting each of them to her daughter.\r\n"That is Gerald\'s room," said Silverbridge. "You have never seen\r\nGerald. He is such a brick." Mrs. Boncassen was charmed with the\r\nwhips and sticks and boxing-gloves in Gerald\'s room, and expressed\r\nan opinion that young men in the States mostly carried their\r\nknick-knacks about with them to the Universities. When she was told\r\nthat he had another collection of "knick-knacks" at Matching, and\r\nanother at Oxford, she thought that he was a very extravagant young\r\nman. Isabel, who had heard all about the gambling in Scotland, looked\r\nround at her lover and smiled.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," said Mrs. Boncassen, as they took their leave, "it\r\nis a very grand house, and I hope with all my heart you may have\r\nyour health there and be happy. But I don\'t know that you\'ll be any\r\nhappier because it\'s so big."\r\n\r\n"Wait till you see Gatherum," said Silverbridge. "That, I own, does\r\nmake me unhappy. It has been calculated that three months at Gatherum\r\nCastle would drive a philosopher mad."\r\n\r\nIn all this there had been a certain amount of disappointment for\r\nSilverbridge; but on that evening, before dinner in Brook Street, he\r\nreceived compensation. As the day was one somewhat peculiar in its\r\nnature he decided that it should be kept altogether as a holiday, and\r\nhe did not therefore go down to the House. And not going to the House\r\nof course he spent the time with the Boncassens. "You know you ought\r\nto go," Isabel said to him when they found themselves alone together\r\nin the back drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Of course I ought."\r\n\r\n"Then go. Do you think I would keep a Briton from his duties?"\r\n\r\n"Not though the constitution should fall in ruins. Do you suppose\r\nthat a man wants no rest after inspecting all the pots and pans in\r\nthat establishment? A woman, I believe, could go on doing that kind\r\nof thing all day long."\r\n\r\n"You should remember at least that the--woman was interesting herself\r\nabout your pots and pans."\r\n\r\n"And now, Bella, tell me what the governor said to you." Then she\r\nshowed him the ring. "Did he give you that?" She nodded her head in\r\nassent. "I did not think he would ever have parted with that."\r\n\r\n"It was your mother\'s."\r\n\r\n"She wore it always. I almost think that I never saw her hand without\r\nit. He would not have given you that unless he had meant to be very\r\ngood to you."\r\n\r\n"He was very good to me. Silverbridge, I have a great deal to do, to\r\nlearn to be your wife."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll teach you."\r\n\r\n"Yes; you\'ll teach me. But will you teach me right? There is\r\nsomething almost awful in your father\'s serious dignity and solemn\r\nappreciation of the responsibilities of his position. Will you ever\r\ncome to that?"\r\n\r\n"I shall never be a great man as he is."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that life to him is a load;--which he does not object\r\nto carry, but which he knows must be carried with a great struggle."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it ought to be so with everyone."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, "but the higher you put your foot on the ladder the\r\nmore constant should be your thought that your stepping requires\r\ncare. I fear that I am climbing too high."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t come down now, my young woman."\r\n\r\n"I have to go on now,--and do it as best I can. I will try to do my\r\nbest. I will try to do my best. I told him so, and now I tell you so.\r\nI will try to do my best."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps after all I am only a \'pert poppet\'," she said half an hour\r\nafterwards, for Silverbridge had told her of that terrible mistake\r\nmade by poor Dolly Longstaff.\r\n\r\n"Brute!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Not at all. And when we are settled down in the real Darby-and-Joan\r\nway I shall hope to see Mr. Longstaff very often. I daresay he won\'t\r\ncall me a pert poppet, and I shall not remind him of the word. But\r\nI shall always think of it; and remembering the way in which my\r\ncharacter struck an educated Englishman,--who was not altogether\r\nill-disposed towards me,--I may hope to improve myself."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII\r\n\r\n"I Have Never Loved You"\r\n\r\n\r\nSilverbridge had now been in town three or four weeks, and Lady Mabel\r\nGrex had also been in London all that time, and yet he had not seen\r\nher. She had told him that she loved him and had asked him plainly to\r\nmake her his wife. He had told her that he could not do so,--that he\r\nwas altogether resolved to make another woman his wife. Then she had\r\nrebuked him, and had demanded from him how he had dared to treat her\r\nas he had done. His conscience was clear. He had his own code of\r\nmorals as to such matters, and had, as he regarded it, kept within\r\nthe law. But she thought that she was badly treated, and had declared\r\nthat she was now left out in the cold for ever through his treachery.\r\nThen her last word had been almost the worst of all, "Who can tell\r\nwhat may come to pass?"--showing too plainly that she would not even\r\nnow give up her hope. Before the month was up she wrote to him as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR LORD SILVERBRIDGE,\r\n\r\n   Why do you not come and see me? Are friends so plentiful\r\n   with you that one so staunch as I may be thrown over?\r\n   But of course I know why you do not come. Put all that\r\n   aside,--and come. I cannot hurt you. I have learned to\r\n   feel that certain things which the world regards as too\r\n   awful to be talked of,--except in the way of scandal, may\r\n   be discussed and then laid aside just like other subjects.\r\n   What though I wear a wig or a wooden leg, I may still be\r\n   fairly comfortable among my companions unless I crucify\r\n   myself by trying to hide my misfortune. It is not the\r\n   presence of the skeleton that crushes us. Not even that\r\n   will hurt us much if we let him go about the house as he\r\n   lists. It is the everlasting effort which the horror makes\r\n   to peep out of his cupboard that robs us of our ease. At\r\n   any rate come and see me.\r\n\r\n   Of course I know that you are to be married to Miss\r\n   Boncassen. Who does not know it? The trumpeters have been\r\n   at work for the last week.\r\n\r\n   Your very sincere friend,\r\n\r\n   MABEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe wished that she had not written. Of course he must go to her. And\r\nthough there was a word or two in her letter which angered him, his\r\nfeelings towards her were kindly. Had not that American angel flown\r\nacross the Atlantic to his arms he could have been well content to\r\nmake her his wife. But the interview at the present moment could\r\nhardly be other than painful. She could, she said, talk of her own\r\nmisfortunes, but the subject would be very painful to him. It was\r\nnot to him a skeleton, to be locked out of sight; but it had been a\r\nmisfortune, and the sooner that such misfortunes could be forgotten\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\nHe knew what she meant about trumpeters. She had intended to signify\r\nthat Isabel in her pride had boasted of her matrimonial prospects.\r\nOf course there had been trumpets. Are there not always trumpets\r\nwhen a marriage is contemplated, magnificent enough to be called an\r\nalliance? As for that he himself had blown the trumpets. He had told\r\neverybody that he was going to be married to Miss Boncassen. Isabel\r\nhad blown no trumpets. In her own straightforward way she had told\r\nthe truth to whom it concerned. Of course he would go and see Lady\r\nMabel, but he trusted that for her own sake nothing would be said\r\nabout trumpets.\r\n\r\n"So you have come at last," Mabel said when he entered the room.\r\n"No;--Miss Cassewary is not here. As I wanted to see you alone I got\r\nher to go out this morning. Why did you not come before?"\r\n\r\n"You said in your letter that you knew why."\r\n\r\n"But in saying so I was accusing you of cowardice;--was I not?"\r\n\r\n"It was not cowardice."\r\n\r\n"Why then did you not come?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you would hardly wish to see me so soon,--after what\r\npassed."\r\n\r\n"That is honest at any rate. You felt that I must be too much ashamed\r\nof what I said to be able to look you in the face."\r\n\r\n"Not that exactly."\r\n\r\n"Any other man would have felt the same, but no other man would be\r\nhonest enough to tell me so. I do not think that ever in your life\r\nyou have constrained yourself to the civility of a lie."\r\n\r\n"I hope not."\r\n\r\n"To be civil and false is often better than to be harsh and true. I\r\nmay be soothed by the courtesy and yet not deceived by the lie. But\r\nwhat I told you in my letter,--which I hope you have destroyed--"\r\n\r\n"I will destroy it."\r\n\r\n"Do. It was not intended for the partner of your future joys. As I\r\ntold you then, I can talk freely. Why not? We know it,--both of us.\r\nHow your conscience may be I cannot tell; but mine is clear from that\r\nsoil with which you think it should be smirched."\r\n\r\n"I think nothing of the sort."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Silverbridge, you do. You have said to yourself this;--That\r\ngirl has determined to get me, and she has not scrupled as to how she\r\nwould do it."\r\n\r\n"No such idea has ever crossed my mind."\r\n\r\n"But you have never told yourself of the encouragement which you gave\r\nme. Such condemnation as I have spoken of would have been just if my\r\nefforts had been sanctioned by no words, no looks, no deeds from you.\r\nDid you give me warrant for thinking that you were my lover?"\r\n\r\nThat theory by which he had justified himself to himself seemed to\r\nfall away from him under her questioning. He could not now remember\r\nhis words to her in those old days before Miss Boncassen had crossed\r\nhis path; but he did know that he had once intended to make her\r\nunderstand that he loved her. She had not understood him;--or,\r\nunderstanding, had not accepted his words; and therefore he had\r\nthought himself free. But it now seemed that he had not been entitled\r\nso to regard himself. There she sat, looking at him, waiting for his\r\nanswer; and he who had been so sure that he had committed no sin\r\nagainst her, had not a word to say to her.\r\n\r\n"I want your answer to that, Lord Silverbridge. I have told you that\r\nI would have no skeleton in the cupboard. Down at Matching, and\r\nbefore that at Killancodlem, I appealed to you, asking you to take me\r\nas your wife."\r\n\r\n"Hardly that."\r\n\r\n"Altogether that! I will have nothing denied that I have done,--nor\r\nwill I be ashamed of anything. I did do so,--even after this\r\ninfatuation. I thought then that one so volatile might perhaps fly\r\nback again."\r\n\r\n"I shall not do that," said he, frowning at her.\r\n\r\n"You need trouble yourself with no assurance, my friend. Let us\r\nunderstand each other now. I am not now supposing that you can fly\r\nback again. You have found your perch, and you must settle on it like\r\na good domestic barn-door fowl." Again he scowled. If she were too\r\nhard upon him he would certainly turn upon her. "No; you will not fly\r\nback again now;--but was I, or was I not, justified when you came to\r\nKillancodlem in thinking that my lover had come there?"\r\n\r\n"How can I tell? It is my own justification I am thinking of."\r\n\r\n"I see all that. But we cannot both be justified. Did you mean\r\nme to suppose that you were speaking to me words in earnest when\r\nthere,--sitting in that very spot,--you spoke to me of your love."\r\n\r\n"Did I speak of my love?"\r\n\r\n"Did you speak of your love! And now, Silverbridge,--for if there\r\nbe an English gentleman on earth I think that you are one,--as a\r\ngentleman tell me this. Did you not even tell your father that I\r\nshould be your wife? I know you did."\r\n\r\n"Did he tell you?"\r\n\r\n"Men such as you and he, who cannot even lie with your eyelids, who\r\nwill not condescend to cover up a secret by a moment of feigned\r\ninanimation, have many voices. He did tell me; but he broke no\r\nconfidence. He told me, but did not mean to tell me. Now you also\r\nhave told me."\r\n\r\n"I did. I told him so. And then I changed my mind."\r\n\r\n"I know you changed your mind. Men often do. A pinker pink, a\r\nwhiter white,--a finger that will press you just half an ounce the\r\ncloser,--a cheek that will consent to let itself come just a little\r\nnearer--!"\r\n\r\n"No; no; no!" It was because Isabel had not easily consented to such\r\napproaches!\r\n\r\n"Trifles such as these will do it;--and some such trifles have done\r\nit with you. It would be beneath me to make comparisons where I might\r\nseem to be the gainer. I grant her beauty. She is very lovely. She\r\nhas succeeded."\r\n\r\n"I have succeeded."\r\n\r\n"But--I am justified, and you are condemned. Is it not so? Tell me\r\nlike a man."\r\n\r\n"You are justified."\r\n\r\n"And you are condemned? When you told me that I should be your wife,\r\nand then told your father the same story, was I to think it all meant\r\nnothing! Have you deceived me?"\r\n\r\n"I did not mean it."\r\n\r\n"Have you deceived me? What; you cannot deny it, and yet have not the\r\nmanliness to own it to a poor woman who can only save herself from\r\nhumiliation by extorting the truth from you!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mabel, I am so sorry it should be so."\r\n\r\n"I believe you are,--with a sorrow that will last till she is again\r\nsitting close to you. Nor, Silverbridge, do I wish it to be longer.\r\nNo;--no;--no. Your fault after all has not been great. You deceived,\r\nbut did not mean to deceive me?"\r\n\r\n"Never; never."\r\n\r\n"And I fancy you have never known how much you bore about with\r\nyou. Your modesty has been so perfect that you have not thought of\r\nyourself as more than other men. You have forgotten that you have had\r\nin your hand the disposal to some one woman of a throne in Paradise."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose you thought of that."\r\n\r\n"But I did. Why should I tell falsehoods now? I have determined that\r\nyou should know everything,--but I could better confess to you my own\r\nsins when I had shown that you too have not been innocent. Not think\r\nof it! Do not men think of high titles and great wealth and power\r\nand place? And if men, why should not women? Do not men try to get\r\nthem;--and are they not even applauded for their energy? A woman has\r\nbut one way to try. I tried."\r\n\r\n"I do not think it was all for that."\r\n\r\n"How shall I answer that without a confession which even I am not\r\nhardened enough to make? In truth, Silverbridge, I have never loved\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nHe drew himself up slowly before he answered her, and gradually\r\nassumed a look very different from that easy boyish smile which was\r\ncustomary to him. "I am glad of that," he said.\r\n\r\n"Why are you glad?"\r\n\r\n"Now I can have no regrets."\r\n\r\n"You need have none. It was necessary to me that I should have my\r\nlittle triumph;--that I should show you that I knew how far you had\r\nwronged me! But now I wish that you should know everything. I have\r\nnever loved you."\r\n\r\n"There is an end of it then."\r\n\r\n"But I have liked you so well,--so much better than all others! A\r\ndozen men have asked me to marry them. And though they might be\r\nnothing till they made that request, then they became--things of\r\nhorror to me. But you were not a thing of horror. I could have become\r\nyour wife, and I think that I could have learned to love you."\r\n\r\n"It is best as it is."\r\n\r\n"I ought to say so too; but I have a doubt I should have liked to\r\nbe Duchess of Omnium, and perhaps I might have fitted the place\r\nbetter than one who can as yet know but little of its duties or its\r\nprivileges. I may, perhaps, think that that other arrangement would\r\nhave been better even for you."\r\n\r\n"I can take care of myself in that."\r\n\r\n"I should have married you without loving you, but I should have done\r\nso determined to serve you with a devotion which a woman who does\r\nlove hardly thinks necessary. I would have so done my duty that you\r\nshould never have guessed that my heart had been in the keeping of\r\nanother man."\r\n\r\n"Another man!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; of course. If there had been no other man, why not you? Am I\r\nso hard, do you think that I can love no one? Are you not such a one\r\nthat a girl would naturally love,--were she not preoccupied? That a\r\nwoman should love seems as necessary as that a man should not."\r\n\r\n"A man can love too."\r\n\r\n"No;--hardly. He can admire, and he can like, and he can fondle and\r\nbe fond. He can admire, and approve, and perhaps worship. He can know\r\nof a woman that she is part of himself, the most sacred part, and\r\ntherefore will protect her from the very winds. But all that will\r\nnot make love. It does not come to a man that to be separated from\r\na woman is to be dislocated from his very self. A man has but one\r\ncentre, and that is himself. A woman has two. Though the second may\r\nnever be seen by her, may live in the arms of another, may do all for\r\nthat other that man can do for woman,--still, still, though he be\r\nhalf the globe asunder from her, still he is to her the half of her\r\nexistence. If she really love, there is, I fancy, no end of it. To\r\nthe end of time I shall love Frank Tregear."\r\n\r\n"Tregear!"\r\n\r\n"Who else?"\r\n\r\n"He is engaged to Mary."\r\n\r\n"Of course he is. Why not;--to her or whomsoever else he might like\r\nbest? He is as true I doubt not to your sister as you are to your\r\nAmerican beauty,--or as you would have been to me had fancy held. He\r\nused to love me."\r\n\r\n"You were always friends."\r\n\r\n"Always;--dear friends. And he would have loved me if a man were\r\ncapable of loving. But he could sever himself from me easily, just\r\nwhen he was told to do so. I thought that I could do the same. But I\r\ncannot. A jackal is born a jackal, and not a lion, and cannot help\r\nhimself. So is a woman born--a woman. They are clinging, parasite\r\nthings, which cannot but adhere; though they destroy themselves by\r\nadhering. Do not suppose that I take a pride in it. I would give one\r\nof my eyes to be able to disregard him."\r\n\r\n"Time will do it."\r\n\r\n"Yes; time,--that brings wrinkles and rouge-pots and rheumatism.\r\nThough I have so hated those men as to be unable to endure them,\r\nstill I want some man\'s house, and his name,--some man\'s bread\r\nand wine,--some man\'s jewels and titles and woods and parks and\r\ngardens,--if I can get them. Time can help a man in his sorrow. If he\r\nbegins at forty to make speeches, or to win races, or to breed oxen,\r\nhe can yet live a prosperous life. Time is but a poor consoler for a\r\nyoung woman who has to be married."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mabel."\r\n\r\n"And now let there be not a word more about it. I know--that I can\r\ntrust you."\r\n\r\n"Indeed you may."\r\n\r\n"Though you will tell her everything else you will not tell her\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"No;--not this."\r\n\r\n"And surely you will not tell your sister!"\r\n\r\n"I shall tell no one."\r\n\r\n"It is because you are so true that I have dared to trust you. I had\r\nto justify myself,--and then to confess. Had I at that one moment\r\ntaken you at your word, you would never have known anything of all\r\nthis. \'There is a tide in the affairs of men--!\' But I let the flood\r\ngo by! I shall not see you again now before you are married; but come\r\nto me afterwards."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV\r\n\r\n"Let Us Drink a Glass of Wine Together"\r\n\r\n\r\nSilverbridge pondered it all much as he went home. What a terrible\r\nstory was that he had heard! The horror to him was chiefly in\r\nthis,--that she should yet be driven to marry some man without even\r\nfancying that she could love him! And this was Lady Mabel Grex, who,\r\non his own first entrance into London life, now not much more than\r\ntwelve months ago, had seemed to him to stand above all other girls\r\nin beauty, charm, and popularity!\r\n\r\nAs he opened the door of the house with his latch-key, who should be\r\ncoming out but Frank Tregear,--Frank Tregear with his arm in a sling,\r\nbut still with an unmistakable look of general satisfaction. "When on\r\nearth did you come up?" asked Silverbridge. Tregear told him that he\r\nhad arrived on the previous evening from Harrington. "And why? The\r\ndoctor would not have let you come if he could have helped it."\r\n\r\n"When he found he could not help it, he did let me come. I am nearly\r\nall right. If I had been nearly all wrong I should have had to come."\r\n\r\n"And what are you doing here?"\r\n\r\n"Well; if you\'ll allow me I\'ll go back with you for a moment. What do\r\nyou think I have been doing?"\r\n\r\n"Have you seen my sister?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have seen your sister. And I have done better than\r\nthat. I have seen your father. Lord Silverbridge,--behold your\r\nbrother-in-law."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say that it is arranged?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"What did he say?"\r\n\r\n"He made me understand by most unanswerable arguments, that I had no\r\nbusiness to think of such a thing. I did not fight the point with\r\nhim,--but simply stood there, as conclusive evidence of my business.\r\nHe told me that we should have nothing to live on unless he gave us\r\nan income. I assured him that I would never ask him for a shilling.\r\n\'But I cannot allow her to marry a man without an income,\' he said."\r\n\r\n"I know his way so well."\r\n\r\n"I had just two facts to go upon,--that I would not give her up, and\r\nthat she would not give me up. When I pointed that out he tore his\r\nhair,--in a mild way, and said that he did not understand that kind\r\nof thing at all."\r\n\r\n"And yet he gave way."\r\n\r\n"Of course he did. They say that when a king of old would consent to\r\nsee a petitioner for his life, he was bound by his royalty to mercy.\r\nSo it was with the Duke. Then, very early in the argument, he forgot\r\nhimself, and called her--Mary. I knew he had thrown up the sponge\r\nthen."\r\n\r\n"How did he give way at last?"\r\n\r\n"He asked me what were my ideas about life in general. I said that\r\nI thought Parliament was a good sort of thing, that I was lucky\r\nenough to have a seat, and that I should take lodgings somewhere\r\nin Westminster till--. \'Till what?\' he asked. \'Till something is\r\nsettled,\' I replied. Then he turned away from me and remained silent.\r\n\'May I see Lady Mary?\' I asked. \'Yes; you may see her,\' he replied,\r\nas he rang the bell. Then when the servant was gone he stopped me.\r\n\'I love her too dearly to see her grieve,\' he said. \'I hope you\r\nwill show that you can be worthy of her.\' Then I made some sort of\r\nprotestation and went upstairs. While I was with Mary there came a\r\nmessage to me, telling me to come to dinner."\r\n\r\n"The Boncassens are all dining here."\r\n\r\n"Then we shall be a family party. So far I suppose I may say it is\r\nsettled. When he will let us marry heaven only knows. Mary declares\r\nthat she will not press him. I certainly cannot do so. It is all a\r\nmatter of money."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t care about that."\r\n\r\n"But he may perhaps think that a little patience will do us good. You\r\nwill have to soften him." Then Silverbridge told all that he knew\r\nabout himself. He was to be married in May, was to go to Matching for\r\na week or two after his wedding, was then to see the Session to an\r\nend, and after that to travel with his wife in the United States. "I\r\ndon\'t suppose we shall be allowed to run about the world together so\r\nsoon as that," said Tregear, "but I am too well satisfied with my\r\nday\'s work to complain."\r\n\r\n"Did he say what he meant to give her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no;--nor even that he meant to give her anything. I should\r\nnot dream of asking a question about it. Nor when he makes any\r\nproposition shall I think of having any opinion of my own."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll make it all right;--for her sake, you know."\r\n\r\n"My chief object as regards him, is that he should not think that I\r\nhave been looking after her money. Well; good-bye. I suppose we shall\r\nall meet at dinner?"\r\n\r\nWhen Tregear left him, Silverbridge went to his father\'s room. He\r\nwas anxious that they should understand each other as to Mary\'s\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\n"I thought you were at the House," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"I was going there, but I met Tregear at the door. He tells me you\r\nhave accepted him for Mary."\r\n\r\n"I wish that he had never seen her. Do you think that a man can be\r\nthwarted in everything and not feel it?"\r\n\r\n"I thought--you had reconciled yourself--to Isabel."\r\n\r\n"If it were that alone I could do so the more easily, because\r\npersonally she wins upon me. And this man, too;--it is not that I\r\nfind fault with himself."\r\n\r\n"He is in all respects a high-minded gentleman."\r\n\r\n"I hope so. But yet, had he a right to set his heart there, where he\r\ncould make his fortune,--having none of his own?"\r\n\r\n"He did not think of that."\r\n\r\n"He should have thought of it. A man does not allow himself to love\r\nwithout any consideration or purpose. You say that he is a gentleman.\r\nA gentleman should not look to live on means brought to him by a\r\nwife. You say that he did not."\r\n\r\n"He did not think of it."\r\n\r\n"A gentleman should do more than not think of it. He should think\r\nthat it shall not be so. A man should own his means or should earn\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"How many men, sir, do neither?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I know," said the Duke. "Such a doctrine nowadays is caviare\r\nto the general. One must live as others live around one, I suppose.\r\nI could not see her suffer. It was too much for me. When I became\r\nconvinced that this was no temporary passion, no romantic love which\r\ntime might banish, that she was of such a temperament that she could\r\nnot change,--then I had to give way. Gerald, I suppose, will bring me\r\nsome kitchen-maid for his wife."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, you should not say that to me."\r\n\r\n"No;--I should not have said it to you. I beg your pardon,\r\nSilverbridge." Then he paused a moment, turning over certain thoughts\r\nwithin his own bosom. "Perhaps, after all, it is well that a pride of\r\nwhich I am conscious should be rebuked. And it may be that the rebuke\r\nhas come in such a form that I should be thankful. I know that I can\r\nlove Isabel."\r\n\r\n"That to me will be everything."\r\n\r\n"And this young man has nothing that should revolt me. I think he has\r\nbeen wrong. But now that I have said it I will let all that pass from\r\nme. He will dine with us to-day."\r\n\r\nSilverbridge then went up to see his sister. "So you have settled\r\nyour little business, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Silverbridge, you will wish me joy?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Papa is so stern with me. Of course he has given way, and of course\r\nI am grateful. But he looks at me as though I had done something to\r\nbe forgiven."\r\n\r\n"Take the good the gods provide you, Mary. That will all come right."\r\n\r\n"But I have not done anything wrong. Have I?"\r\n\r\n"That is a matter of opinion. How can I answer about you when I don\'t\r\nquite know whether I have done anything wrong or not myself? I am\r\ngoing to marry the girl I have chosen. That\'s enough for me."\r\n\r\n"But you did change."\r\n\r\n"We need not say anything about that."\r\n\r\n"But I have never changed. Papa just told me that he would consent,\r\nand that I might write to him. So I did write, and he came. But papa\r\nlooks at me as though I had broken his heart."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what it is, Mary. You expect too much from him. He has\r\nnot had his own way with either of us, and of course he feels it."\r\n\r\nAs Tregear had said, there was quite a family party in Carlton\r\nTerrace, though as yet the family was not bound together by family\r\nties. All the Boncassens were there, the father, the mother, and the\r\npromised bride. Mr. Boncassen bore himself with more ease than any\r\none in the company, having at his command a gift of manliness which\r\nenabled him to regard this marriage exactly as he would have done any\r\nother. America was not so far distant but what he would be able to\r\nsee his girl occasionally. He liked the young man and he believed\r\nin the comfort of wealth. Therefore he was satisfied. But when the\r\nmarriage was spoken of, or written of, as "an alliance," then he\r\nwould say a hard word or two about dukes and lords in general. On\r\nsuch an occasion as this he was happy and at his ease.\r\n\r\nSo much could not be said for his wife, with whom the Duke attempted\r\nto place himself on terms of family equality. But in doing this he\r\nfailed to hide the attempt even from her, and she broke down under\r\nit. Had he simply walked into the room with her as he would have done\r\non any other occasion, and then remarked that the frost was keen or\r\nthe thaw disagreeable, it would have been better for her. But when he\r\ntold her that he hoped she would often make herself at home in that\r\nhouse, and looked, as he said it, as though he were asking her to\r\ntake a place among the goddesses of Olympus, she was troubled as to\r\nher answer. "Oh, my Lord Duke," she said, "when I think of Isabel\r\nliving here and being called by such a name, it almost upsets me."\r\n\r\nIsabel had all her father\'s courage, but she was more sensitive; and\r\nthough she would have borne her honours well, was oppressed by the\r\nfeeling that the weight was too much for her mother. She could not\r\nkeep her ear from listening to her mother\'s words, or her eye from\r\nwatching her mother\'s motions. She was prepared to carry her mother\r\neverywhere. "As other girls have to be taken with their belongings,\r\nso must I, if I be taken at all." This she had said plainly enough.\r\nThere should be no division between her and her mother. But still,\r\nknowing that her mother was not quite at ease, she was hardly at ease\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nSilverbridge came in at the last moment, and of course occupied a\r\nchair next to Isabel. As the House was sitting, it was natural that\r\nhe should come up in a flurry. "I left Phineas," he said, "pounding\r\naway in his old style at Sir Timothy. By-the-bye, Isabel, you must\r\ncome down some day and hear Sir Timothy badgered. I must be back\r\nagain about ten. Well, Gerald, how are they all at Lazarus?" He made\r\nan effort to be free and easy, but even he soon found that it was an\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nGerald had come up from Oxford for the occasion that he might make\r\nacquaintance with the Boncassens. He had taken Isabel in to dinner,\r\nbut had been turned out of his place when his brother came in. He\r\nhad been a little confused by the first impression made upon him by\r\nMrs. Boncassen, and had involuntarily watched his father. "Silver is\r\ngoing to have an odd sort of a mother-in-law," he said afterwards\r\nto Mary, who remarked in reply that this would not signify, as the\r\nmother-in-law would be in New York.\r\n\r\nTregear\'s part was very difficult to play. He could not but feel that\r\nthough he had succeeded, still he was as yet looked upon askance.\r\nSilverbridge had told him that by degrees the Duke would be won\r\nround, but that it was not to be expected that he should swallow at\r\nonce all his regrets. The truth of this could not but be accepted.\r\nThe immediate inconvenience, however, was not the less felt. Each\r\nand everyone there knew the position of each and everyone;--but\r\nTregear felt it difficult to act up to his. He could not play the\r\nwell-pleased lover openly, as did Silverbridge. Mary herself was\r\ndisposed to be very silent. The heart-breaking tedium of her dull\r\nlife had been removed. Her determination had been rewarded. All that\r\nshe had wanted had been granted to her, and she was happy. But she\r\nwas not prepared to show off her happiness before others. And she was\r\naware that she was thought to have done evil by introducing her lover\r\ninto her august family.\r\n\r\nBut it was the Duke who made the greatest efforts, and with the least\r\nsuccess. He had told himself again and again that he was bound by\r\nevery sense of duty to swallow all regrets. He had taken himself to\r\ntask on this matter. He had done so even out loud to his son. He had\r\ndeclared that he would "let it all pass from him." But who does not\r\nknow how hard it is for a man in such matters to keep his word to\r\nhimself? Who has not said to himself at the very moment of his own\r\ndelinquency, "Now,--it is now,--at this very instant of time, that\r\nI should crush, and quench, and kill the evil spirit within me; it\r\nis now that I should abate my greed, or smother my ill-humour, or\r\nabandon my hatred. It is now, and here, that I should drive out the\r\nfiend, as I have sworn to myself that I would do,"--and yet has\r\nfailed?\r\n\r\nThat it would be done, would be done at last, by this man was very\r\ncertain. When Silverbridge assured his sister that "it would come all\r\nright very soon," he had understood his father\'s character. But it\r\ncould not be completed quite at once. Had he been required to take\r\nIsabel only to his heart, it would have been comparatively easy.\r\nThere are men, who do not seem at first sight very susceptible to\r\nfeminine attractions, who nevertheless are dominated by the grace of\r\nflounces, who succumb to petticoats unconsciously, and who are half\r\nin love with every woman merely for her womanhood. So it was with the\r\nDuke. He had given way in regard to Isabel with less than half the\r\neffort that Frank Tregear was likely to cost him.\r\n\r\n"You were not at the House, sir," said Silverbridge when he felt that\r\nthere was a pause.\r\n\r\n"No, not to-day." Then there was a pause again.\r\n\r\n"I think that we shall beat Cambridge this year to a moral," said\r\nGerald, who was sitting at the round table opposite to his father.\r\nMr. Boncassen, who was next to him, asked, in irony probably rather\r\nthan in ignorance, whether the victory was to be achieved by\r\nmathematical or classical proficiency. Gerald turned and looked at\r\nhim. "Do you mean to say that you have never heard of the University\r\nboat-races?"\r\n\r\n"Papa, you have disgraced yourself for ever," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Have I, my dear? Yes, I have heard of them. But I thought Lord\r\nGerald\'s protestation was too great for a mere aquatic triumph."\r\n\r\n"Now you are poking your fun at me," said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"Well he may," said the Duke sententiously. "We have laid ourselves\r\nvery open to having fun poked at us in this matter."\r\n\r\n"I think, sir," said Tregear, "that they are learning to do the same\r\nsort of thing at the American Universities."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed," said the Duke in a solemn, dry, funereal tone. And then\r\nall the little life which Gerald\'s remark about the boat-race had\r\nproduced, was quenched at once. The Duke was not angry with Tregear\r\nfor his little word of defence,--but he was not able to bring himself\r\ninto harmony with this one guest, and was almost savage to him\r\nwithout meaning it. He was continually asking himself why Destiny\r\nhad been so hard upon him as to force him to receive there at his\r\ntable as his son-in-law a man who was distasteful to him. And he\r\nwas endeavouring to answer the question, taking himself to task and\r\ntelling himself that his destiny had done him no injury, and that\r\nthe pride which had been wounded was a false pride. He was making a\r\nbrave fight; but during the fight he was hardly fit to be the genial\r\nfather and father-in-law of young people who were going to be married\r\nto one another. But before the dinner was over he made a great\r\neffort. "Tregear," he said,--and even that was an effort, for he\r\nhad never hitherto mentioned the man\'s name without the formal\r\nMister,--"Tregear, as this is the first time you have sat at my\r\ntable, let me be old-fashioned, and ask you to drink a glass of wine\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\nThe glass of wine was drunk and the ceremony afforded infinite\r\nsatisfaction at least to one person there. Mary could not keep\r\nherself from some expression of joy by pressing her finger for a\r\nmoment against her lover\'s arm. He, though not usually given to such\r\nmanifestations, blushed up to his eyes. But the feeling produced on\r\nthe company was solemn rather than jovial. Everyone there understood\r\nit all. Mr. Boncassen could read the Duke\'s mind down to the last\r\nline. Even Mrs. Boncassen was aware that an act of reconciliation had\r\nbeen intended. "When the governor drank that glass of wine it seemed\r\nas though half the marriage ceremony had been performed," Gerald said\r\nto his brother that evening. When the Duke\'s glass was replaced on\r\nthe table, he himself was conscious of the solemnity of what he had\r\ndone, and was half ashamed of it.\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies had gone upstairs the conversation became political\r\nand lively. The Duke could talk freely about the state of things\r\nto Mr. Boncassen, and was able gradually to include Tregear in the\r\nbadinage with which he attacked the Conservatism of his son. And so\r\nthe half-hour passed well. Upstairs the two girls immediately came\r\ntogether, leaving Mrs. Boncassen to chew the cud of the grandeur\r\naround her in the sleepy comfort of an arm-chair. "And so everything\r\nis settled for both of us," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Of course I knew it was to be settled for you. You told me so at\r\nCustins."\r\n\r\n"I did not know it myself then. I only told you that he had asked me.\r\nAnd you hardly believed me."\r\n\r\n"I certainly believed you."\r\n\r\n"But you knew about--Lady Mabel Grex."\r\n\r\n"I only suspected something, and now I know it was a mistake. It has\r\nnever been more than a suspicion."\r\n\r\n"And why, when we were at Custins, did you not tell me about\r\nyourself?"\r\n\r\n"I had nothing to tell."\r\n\r\n"I can understand that. But is it not joyful that it should all be\r\nsettled? Only poor Lady Mabel! You have got no Lady Mabel to trouble\r\nyour conscience." From which it was evident that Silverbridge had not\r\ntold all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV\r\n\r\nThe Major\'s Story\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of March Isabel was in Paris, whither she had forbidden\r\nher lover to follow her. Silverbridge was therefore reduced to the\r\nshifts of a bachelor\'s life, in which his friends seemed to think\r\nthat he ought now to take special delight. Perhaps he did not\r\ntake much delight in them. He was no doubt impatient to commence\r\nthat steady married life for which he had prepared himself.\r\nBut nevertheless, just at present, he lived a good deal at the\r\nBeargarden. Where was he to live? The Boncassens were in Paris, his\r\nsister was at Matching with a houseful of other Pallisers, and his\r\nfather was again deep in politics.\r\n\r\nOf course he was much in the House of Commons, but that also was\r\nstupid. Indeed everything would be stupid till Isabel came back.\r\nPerhaps dinner was more comfortable at the club than at the House.\r\nAnd then, as everybody knew, it was a good thing to change the scene.\r\nTherefore he dined at the club, and though he would keep his hansom\r\nand go down to the House again in the course of the evening, he spent\r\nmany long hours at the Beargarden. "There\'ll very soon be an end of\r\nthis as far as you are concerned," said Mr. Lupton to him one evening\r\nas they were sitting in the smoking-room after dinner.\r\n\r\n"The sooner the better as far as this place is concerned."\r\n\r\n"This place is as good as any other. For the matter of that I like\r\nthe Beargarden since we got rid of two or three not very charming\r\ncharacters."\r\n\r\n"You mean my poor friend Tifto," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"No;--I was not thinking of Tifto. There were one or two here who\r\nwere quite as bad as Tifto. I wonder what has become of that poor\r\ndevil?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know in the least. You heard of that row about the hounds?"\r\n\r\n"And his letter to you."\r\n\r\n"He wrote to me,--and I answered him, as you know. But whither he\r\nvanished, or what he is doing, or how he is living, I have not the\r\nleast idea."\r\n\r\n"Gone to join those other fellows abroad, I should say. Among them\r\nthey got a lot of money,--as the Duke ought to remember."\r\n\r\n"He is not with them," said Silverbridge, as though he were in some\r\ndegree mourning over the fate of his unfortunate friend.\r\n\r\n"I suppose Captain Green was the leader in all that?"\r\n\r\n"Now it is all done and gone I own to a certain regard for the Major.\r\nHe was true to me till he thought I snubbed him. I would not let him\r\ngo down to Silverbridge with me. I always thought that I drove the\r\npoor Major to his malpractices."\r\n\r\nAt this moment Dolly Longstaff sauntered into the room and came up\r\nto them. It may be remembered that Dolly had declared his purpose\r\nof emigrating. As soon as he heard that the Duke\'s heir had serious\r\nthoughts of marrying the lady whom he loved he withdrew at once from\r\nthe contest, but, as he did so, he acknowledged that there could be\r\nno longer a home for him in the country which Isabel was to inhabit\r\nas the wife of another man. Gradually, however, better thoughts\r\nreturned to him. After all, what was she but a "pert poppet"? He\r\ndetermined that marriage "clips a fellow\'s wings confoundedly,"\r\nand so he set himself to enjoy life after his old fashion. There\r\nwas perhaps a little swagger as he threw himself into a chair and\r\naddressed the happy lover. "I\'ll be shot if I didn\'t meet Tifto at\r\nthe corner of the street."\r\n\r\n"Tifto!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Tifto. He looked awfully seedy, with a greatcoat buttoned up to\r\nhis chin, a shabby hat and old gloves."\r\n\r\n"Did he speak to you?" asked Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"No;--nor I to him. He hadn\'t time to think whether he would speak or\r\nnot, and you may be sure I didn\'t."\r\n\r\nNothing further was said about the man, but Silverbridge was uneasy\r\nand silent. When his cigar was finished he got up, saying that he\r\nshould go back to the House. As he left the club he looked about him\r\nas though expecting to see his old friend, and when he had passed\r\nthrough the first street and had got into the Haymarket there he was!\r\nThe Major came up to him, touched his hat, asked to be allowed to say\r\na few words. "I don\'t think it can do any good," said Silverbridge.\r\nThe man had not attempted to shake hands with him, or affected\r\nfamiliarity; but seemed to be thoroughly humiliated. "I don\'t think I\r\ncan be of any service to you, and therefore I had rather decline."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want you to be of any service, my Lord."\r\n\r\n"Then what\'s the good?"\r\n\r\n"I have something to say. May I come to you to-morrow?"\r\n\r\nThen Silverbridge allowed himself to make an appointment, and an hour\r\nwas named at which Tifto might call in Carlton Terrace. He felt that\r\nhe almost owed some reparation to the wretched man,--whom he had\r\nunfortunately admitted among his friends, whom he had used, and to\r\nwhom he had been uncourteous. Exactly at the hour named the Major was\r\nshown into his room.\r\n\r\nDolly had said that he was shabby,--but the man was altered rather\r\nthan shabby. He still had rings on his fingers and studs in his\r\nshirt, and a jewelled pin in his cravat;--but he had shaven off his\r\nmoustache and the tuft from his chin, and his hair had been cut\r\nshort, and in spite of his jewellery there was a hang-dog look about\r\nhim. "I\'ve got something that I particularly want to say to you, my\r\nLord." Silverbridge would not shake hands with him, but could not\r\nrefrain from offering him a chair.\r\n\r\n"Well;--you can say it now."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--but it isn\'t so very easy to be said. There are some things,\r\nthough you want to say them ever so, you don\'t quite know how to do\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You have your choice, Major Tifto. You can speak or hold your\r\ntongue."\r\n\r\nThen there was a pause, during which Silverbridge sat with his hands\r\nin his pockets trying to look unconcerned. "But if you\'ve got it\r\nhere, and feel it as I do,"--the poor man as he said this put his\r\nhand upon his heart,--"you can\'t sleep in your bed till it\'s out. I\r\ndid that thing that they said I did."\r\n\r\n"What thing?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the nail! It was I lamed the horse."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for it. I can say nothing else."\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t so sorry for it as I am. Oh no; you can never be that, my\r\nLord. After all, what does it matter to you?"\r\n\r\n"Very little. I meant that I was sorry for your sake."\r\n\r\n"I believe you are, my Lord. For though you could be rough you was\r\nalways kind. Now I will tell you everything, and then you can do as\r\nyou please."\r\n\r\n"I wish to do nothing. As far as I am concerned the matter is over.\r\nIt made me sick of horses, and I do not wish to have to think of it\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, my Lord, I\'ve got to tell it. It was Green who put me\r\nup to it. He did it just for the plunder. As God is my judge it was\r\nnot for the money I did it."\r\n\r\n"Then it was revenge."\r\n\r\n"It was the devil got hold of me, my Lord. Up to that I had always\r\nbeen square,--square as a die! I got to think that your Lordship was\r\nupsetting. I don\'t know whether your Lordship remembers, but you did\r\nput me down once or twice rather uncommon."\r\n\r\n"I hope I was not unjust."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say you was, my Lord. But I got a feeling on me that you\r\nwanted to get rid of me, and I all the time doing the best I could\r\nfor the \'orses. I did do the best I could up to that very morning at\r\nDoncaster. Well;--it was Green put me up to it. I don\'t say I was\r\nto get nothing; but it wasn\'t so much more than I could have got by\r\nthe \'orse winning. And I\'ve lost pretty nearly all that I did get.\r\nDo you remember, my Lord,"--and now the Major sank his voice to a\r\nwhisper,--"when I come up to your bedroom that morning?"\r\n\r\n"I remember it."\r\n\r\n"The first time?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I remember it."\r\n\r\n"Because I came twice, my Lord. When I came first it hadn\'t been\r\ndone. You turned me out."\r\n\r\n"That is true, Major Tifto."\r\n\r\n"You was very rough then. Wasn\'t you rough?"\r\n\r\n"A man\'s bedroom is generally supposed to be private."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my Lord,--that\'s true. I ought to have sent your man in first.\r\nI came then to confess it all, before it was done."\r\n\r\n"Then why couldn\'t you let the horse alone?"\r\n\r\n"I was in their hands. And then you was so rough with me! So I said\r\nto myself I might as well do it;--and I did it."\r\n\r\n"What do you want me to say? As far as my forgiveness goes, you have\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s saying a great deal, my Lord,--a great deal," said Tifto, now\r\nin tears. "But I ain\'t said it all yet. He\'s here; in London!"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s here?"\r\n\r\n"Green. He\'s here. He doesn\'t think that I know, but I could lay my\r\nhand on him to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"There is no human being alive, Major Tifto, whose presence or\r\nabsence could be a matter of more indifference to me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do, my Lord. I\'ll go before any judge, or\r\nmagistrate, or police-officer in the country, and tell the truth. I\r\nwon\'t ask even for a pardon. They shall punish me and him too. I\'m\r\nin that state of mind that any change would be for the better. But\r\nhe,--he ought to have it heavy."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t be done by me, Major Tifto. Look here, Major Tifto; you\r\nhave come here to confess that you have done me a great injury?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have."\r\n\r\n"And you say you are sorry for it."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am."\r\n\r\n"And I have forgiven you. There is only one way in which you can show\r\nyour gratitude. Hold your tongue about it. Let it be as a thing done\r\nand gone. The money has been paid. The horse has been sold. The whole\r\nthing has gone out of my mind, and I don\'t want to have it brought\r\nback again."\r\n\r\n"And nothing is to be done to Green!"\r\n\r\n"I should say nothing,--on that score."\r\n\r\n"And he has got they say five-and-twenty thousand pounds clear\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"It is a pity, but it cannot be helped. I will have nothing further\r\nto do with it. Of course I cannot bind you, but I have told you my\r\nwishes." The poor wretch was silent, but still it seemed as though he\r\ndid not wish to go quite yet. "If you have said what you have got to\r\nsay, Major Tifto, I may as well tell you that my time is engaged."\r\n\r\n"And must that be all?"\r\n\r\n"What else?"\r\n\r\n"I am in such a state of mind, Lord Silverbridge, that it would be a\r\nsatisfaction to tell it all, even against myself."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t prevent you."\r\n\r\nThen Tifto got up from his chair, as though he were going. "I wish I\r\nknew what I was going to do with myself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I can help you, Major Tifto."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not, my Lord. I haven\'t twenty pounds left in all the\r\nworld. It\'s the only thing that wasn\'t square that ever I did in all\r\nmy life. Your Lordship couldn\'t do anything for me? We was very much\r\ntogether at one time, my Lord."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Major Tifto, we were."\r\n\r\n"Of course I was a villain. But it was only once; and your Lordship\r\nwas so rough to me! I am not saying but what I was a villain. Think\r\nof what I did for myself by that one piece of wickedness! Master of\r\nhounds! member of the club! And the horse would have run in my name\r\nand won the Leger! And everybody knew as your Lordship and me was\r\ntogether in him!" Then he burst out into a paroxysm of tears and\r\nsobbing.\r\n\r\nThe young Lord certainly could not take the man into partnership\r\nagain, nor could he restore to him either the hounds or his club,--or\r\nhis clean hands. Nor did he know in what way he could serve the man,\r\nexcept by putting his hand into his pocket,--which he did. Tifto\r\naccepted the gratuity, and ultimately became an annual pensioner on\r\nhis former noble partner, living on the allowance made him in some\r\nobscure corner of South Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI\r\n\r\nOn Deportment\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Tregear had come up to town at the end of February. He remained\r\nin London, with an understanding that he was not to see Lady Mary\r\nagain till the Easter holidays. He was then to pay a visit to\r\nMatching, and to enter in, it may be presumed, on the full fruition\r\nof his advantages as accepted suitor. All this had been arranged with\r\na good deal of precision,--as though there had still been a hope left\r\nthat Lady Mary might change her mind. Of course there was no such\r\nhope. When the Duke asked the young man to dine with him, when he\r\ninvited him to drink that memorable glass of wine, when the young\r\nman was allowed, in the presence of the Boncassens, to sit next Lady\r\nMary, it was of course settled. But the father probably found some\r\nrelief in yielding by slow degrees. "I would rather that there\r\nshould be no correspondence till then," he had said both to Tregear\r\nand to his daughter. And they had promised there should be no\r\ncorrespondence. At Easter they would meet. After Easter Mary was to\r\ncome up to London to be present at her brother\'s wedding, to which\r\nalso Tregear had been formally invited; and it was hoped that then\r\nsomething might be settled as to their own marriage. Tregear, with\r\nthe surgeon\'s permission, took his seat in Parliament. He was\r\nintroduced by two leading Members on the Conservative side, but\r\nimmediately afterwards found himself seated next to his friend\r\nSilverbridge on the top bench behind the ministers. The House was\r\nvery full, as there was a feverish report abroad that Sir Timothy\r\nBeeswax intended to make a statement. No one quite knew what the\r\nstatement was to be; but every politician in the House and out of\r\nit thought that he knew that the statement would be a bid for\r\nhigher power on the part of Sir Timothy himself. If there had been\r\ndissensions in the Cabinet, the secret of them had been well kept.\r\nTo Tregear who was not as yet familiar with the House there was no\r\nspecial appearance of activity; but Silverbridge could see that\r\nthere was more than wonted animation. That the Treasury bench should\r\nbe full at this time was a thing of custom. A whole broadside of\r\nquestions would be fired off, one after another, like a rattle of\r\nmusketry down the ranks, when as nearly as possible the report of\r\neach gun is made to follow close upon that of the gun before,--with\r\nthis exception, that in such case each little sound is intended to be\r\nas like as possible to the preceding; whereas with the rattle of the\r\nquestions and answers, each question and each answer becomes a little\r\nmore authoritative and less courteous than the last. The Treasury\r\nbench was ready for its usual responsive firing, as the questioners\r\nwere of course in their places. The opposition front bench was also\r\ncrowded, and those behind were nearly equally full. There were many\r\nPeers in the gallery, and a general feeling of sensation prevailed.\r\nAll this Silverbridge had been long enough in the House to\r\nappreciate;--but to Tregear the House was simply the House.\r\n\r\n"It\'s odd enough we should have a row the very first day you come,"\r\nsaid Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"You think there will be a row?"\r\n\r\n"Beeswax has something special to say. He\'s not here yet, you see.\r\nThey\'ve left about six inches for him there between Roper and Sir\r\nOrlando. You\'ll have the privilege of looking just down on the top of\r\nhis head when he does come. I shan\'t stay much longer after that."\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to-day. But I should not have been here now,--in this\r\nvery place I mean,--but I want to stick to you just at first. I shall\r\nmove down below the gangway; and not improbably creep over to the\r\nother side before long."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean it?"\r\n\r\n"I think I shall. I begin to feel I\'ve made a mistake."\r\n\r\n"In coming to this side at all?"\r\n\r\n"I think I have. After all it is not very important."\r\n\r\n"What is not important? I think it very important."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it may be to you, and perhaps you may be able to keep it\r\nup. But the more I think of it the less excuse I seem to have for\r\ndeserting the old ways of the family. What is there in those fellows\r\ndown there to make a fellow feel that he ought to bind himself to\r\nthem neck and heels?"\r\n\r\n"Their principles."\r\n\r\n"Yes, their principles! I believe I have some vague idea as to\r\nsupporting property and land and all that kind of thing. I don\'t know\r\nthat anybody wants to attack anything."\r\n\r\n"Somebody soon would want to attack it if there were no defenders."\r\n\r\n"I suppose there is an outside power,--the people, or public opinion,\r\nor whatever they choose to call it. And the country will have to\r\ngo very much as that outside power chooses. Here, in Parliament,\r\neverybody will be as Conservative as the outside will let them. I\r\ndon\'t think it matters on which side you sit;--but it does matter\r\nthat you shouldn\'t have to act with those who go against the grain\r\nwith you."\r\n\r\n"I never heard a worse political argument in my life."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not. However, here\'s Sir Timothy. When he looks in that\r\nway, all buckram, deportment, and solemnity, I know he\'s going to\r\npitch into somebody."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Leader of the House came in from behind the\r\nSpeaker\'s chair and took his place between Mr. Roper and Sir Orlando\r\nDrought. Silverbridge had been right in saying that Sir Timothy\'s air\r\nwas solemn. When a man has to declare a solemn purpose on a solemn\r\noccasion in a solemn place, it is needful that he should be solemn\r\nhimself. And though the solemnity which befits a man best will be\r\nthat which the importance of the moment may produce, without thought\r\ngiven by himself to his own outward person, still, who is there\r\ncan refrain himself from some attempt? Who can boast, who that has\r\nbeen versed in the ways and duties of high places, that he has kept\r\nhimself free from all study of grace, of feature, of attitude, of\r\ngait--or even of dress? For most of our bishops, for most of our\r\njudges, of our statesmen, our orators, our generals, for many even of\r\nour doctors and our parsons, even our attorneys, our tax-gatherers,\r\nand certainly our butlers and our coachmen, Mr. Turveydrop, the great\r\nprofessor of deportment, has done much. But there should always be\r\nthe art to underlie and protect the art;--the art that can hide the\r\nart. The really clever archbishop,--the really potent chief justice,\r\nthe man who, as a politician, will succeed in becoming a king of men,\r\nshould know how to carry his buckram without showing it. It was in\r\nthis that Sir Timothy perhaps failed a little. There are men who look\r\nas though they were born to wear blue ribbons. It has come, probably,\r\nfrom study, but it seems to be natural. Sir Timothy did not impose on\r\nthose who looked at him as do these men. You could see a little of\r\nthe paint, you could hear the crumple of the starch and the padding;\r\nyou could trace something of uneasiness in the would-be composed\r\ngrandeur of the brow. "Turveydrop!" the spectator would say to\r\nhimself. But after all it may be a question whether a man be open to\r\nreproach for not doing that well which the greatest among us,--if we\r\ncould find one great enough,--would not do at all.\r\n\r\nFor I think we must hold that true personal dignity should be\r\nachieved,--must, if it be quite true, have been achieved,--without\r\nany personal effort. Though it be evinced, in part, by the carriage\r\nof the body, that carriage should be the fruit of the operation of\r\nthe mind. Even when it be assisted by external garniture such as\r\nspecial clothes, and wigs, and ornaments, such garniture should have\r\nbeen prescribed by the sovereign or by custom, and should not have\r\nbeen selected by the wearer. In regard to speech a man may study all\r\nthat which may make him suasive, but if he go beyond that he will\r\ntrench on those histrionic efforts which he will know to be wrong\r\nbecause he will be ashamed to acknowledge them. It is good to be\r\nbeautiful, but it should come of God and not of the hairdresser. And\r\npersonal dignity is a great possession; but a man should struggle for\r\nit no more than he would for beauty. Many, however, do struggle for\r\nit, and with such success that, though they do not achieve quite the\r\nreal thing, still they get something on which they can bolster\r\nthemselves up and be mighty.\r\n\r\nOthers, older men than Silverbridge, saw as much as did our young\r\nfriend, but they were more complaisant and more reasonable. They,\r\ntoo, heard the crackle of the buckram, and were aware that the last\r\ntouch of awe had come upon that brow just as its owner was emerging\r\nfrom the shadow of the Speaker\'s chair;--but to them it was a thing\r\nof course. A real Caesar is not to be found every day, nor can we\r\nalways have a Pitt to control our debates. That kind of thing, that\r\nlast touch has its effect. Of course it is all paint,--but how would\r\nthe poor girl look before the gaslights if there were no paint? The\r\nHouse of Commons likes a little deportment on occasions. If a special\r\nman looks bigger than you, you can console yourself by reflecting\r\nthat he also looks bigger than your fellows. Sir Timothy probably\r\nknew what he was about, and did himself on the whole more good than\r\nharm by his little tricks.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Sir Timothy had taken his seat, Mr. Rattler got up\r\nfrom the opposition bench to ask him some question on a matter of\r\nfinance. The brewers were anxious about publican licences. Could the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer say a word on the matter? Notice had of\r\ncourse been given, and the questioner had stated a quarter of an hour\r\npreviously that he would postpone his query till the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer was in the House.\r\n\r\nSir Timothy rose from his seat, and in his blandest manner began by\r\napologising for his late appearance. He was sorry that he had been\r\nprevented by public business from being in his place to answer the\r\nhonourable gentleman\'s question in its proper turn. And even now,\r\nhe feared that he must decline to give any answer which could be\r\nsupposed to be satisfactory. It would probably be his duty to make a\r\nstatement to the House on the following day,--a statement which he\r\nwas not quite prepared to make at the present moment. But in the\r\nexisting state of things he was unwilling to make any reply to\r\nany question by which he might seem to bind the government to any\r\nopinion. Then he sat down. And rising again not long afterwards, when\r\nthe House had gone through certain formal duties, he moved that it\r\nshould be adjourned till the next day. Then all the members trooped\r\nout, and with the others Tregear and Lord Silverbridge. "So that is\r\nthe end of your first day of Parliament," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"What does it all mean?"\r\n\r\n"Let us go to the Carlton and hear what the fellows are saying."\r\n\r\nOn that evening both the young men dined at Mr. Boncassen\'s house.\r\nThough Tregear had been cautioned not to write to Lady Mary,\r\nand though he was not to see her before Easter, still it was so\r\ncompletely understood that he was about to become her husband, that\r\nhe was entertained in that capacity by all those who were concerned\r\nin the family. "And so they will all go out," said Mr. Boncassen.\r\n\r\n"That seems to be the general idea," said the expectant son-in-law.\r\n"When two men want to be first and neither will give way, they can\'t\r\nvery well get on in the same boat together." Then he expatiated\r\nangrily on the treachery of Sir Timothy, and Tregear in a more\r\nmoderate way joined in the same opinion.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, young men, I doubt whether you are right," said Mr.\r\nBoncassen. "Whether it can be possible that a man should have risen\r\nto such a position with so little patriotism as you attribute to our\r\nfriend, I will not pretend to say. I should think that in England\r\nit was impossible. But of this I am sure, that the facility which\r\nexists here for a minister or ministers to go out of office without\r\ndisturbance of the Crown, is a great blessing. You say the other\r\nparty will come in."\r\n\r\n"That is most probable," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"With us the other party never comes in,--never has a chance of\r\ncoming in,--except once in four years, when the President is elected.\r\nThat one event binds us all for four years."\r\n\r\n"But you do change your ministers," said Tregear.\r\n\r\n"A secretary may quarrel with the President, or he may have the gout,\r\nor be convicted of peculation."\r\n\r\n"And yet you think yourselves more nearly free than we are."\r\n\r\n"I am not so sure of that. We have had a pretty difficult task, that\r\nof carrying on a government in a new country, which is nevertheless\r\nmore populous than almost any old country. The influxions are so\r\nrapid, that every ten years the nature of the people is changed. It\r\nisn\'t easy; and though I think on the whole we\'ve done pretty well,\r\nI am not going to boast that Washington is as yet the seat of a\r\npolitical Paradise."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII\r\n\r\n"Mabel, Good-Bye"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Tregear first came to town with his arm in a sling, and bandages\r\nall round him,--in order that he might be formally accepted by the\r\nDuke,--he had himself taken to one other house besides the house in\r\nCarlton Terrace. He went to Belgrave Square, to announce his fate to\r\nLady Mabel Grex;--but Lady Mabel Grex was not there. The Earl was ill\r\nat Brighton, and Lady Mabel had gone down to nurse him. The old woman\r\nwho came to him in the hall told him that the Earl was very ill;--he\r\nhad been attacked by the gout, but in spite of the gout, and in spite\r\nof the doctors, he had insisted on being taken to his club. Then he\r\nhad been removed to Brighton, under the doctor\'s advice, chiefly in\r\norder that he might be kept out of the way of temptation. Now he was\r\nsupposed to be very ill indeed. "My Lord is so imprudent!" said the\r\nold woman, shaking her old head in real unhappiness. For though the\r\nEarl had been a tyrant to everyone near him, yet when a poor woman\r\nbecomes old it is something to have a tyrant to protect her. "My\r\nLord" always had been imprudent. Tregear knew that it had been the\r\ntheory of my Lord\'s life that to eat and drink and die was better\r\nthan to abstain and live. Then Tregear wrote to his friend as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MABEL,\r\n\r\n   I am up in town again as you will perceive, although I am\r\n   still in a helpless condition and hardly able to write\r\n   even this letter. I called to-day and was very sorry to\r\n   hear so bad an account of your father. Had I been able to\r\n   travel I should have come down to you. When I am able I\r\n   will do so if you would wish to see me. In the meantime\r\n   pray tell me how he is, and how you are.\r\n\r\n   My news is this. The Duke has accepted me. It is great\r\n   news to me, and I hope will be acceptable to you. I do\r\n   believe that if ever a friend has been anxious for a\r\n   friend\'s welfare you have been anxious for mine,--as I\r\n   have been and ever shall be for yours.\r\n\r\n   Of course this thing will be very much to me. I will not\r\n   speak now of my love for the girl who is to become my\r\n   wife. You might again call me Romeo. Nor do I like to say\r\n   much of what may now be pecuniary prospects. I did not ask\r\n   Mary to become my wife because I supposed she would be\r\n   rich. But I could not have married her or any one else who\r\n   had not money. What are the Duke\'s intentions I have not\r\n   the slightest idea, nor shall I ask him. I am to go down\r\n   to Matching at Easter, and shall endeavour to have some\r\n   time fixed. I suppose the Duke will say something about\r\n   money. If he does not, I shall not.\r\n\r\n   Pray write to me at once, and tell me when I shall see\r\n   you.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate Cousin,\r\n\r\n   F. O. TREGEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn answer to this there came a note in a very few words. She\r\ncongratulated him,--not very warmly,--but expressed a hope that she\r\nmight see him soon. But she told him not to come to Brighton. The\r\nEarl was better but very cross, and she would be up in town before\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the month it became suddenly known in London that\r\nLord Grex had died at Brighton. There was a Garter to be given away,\r\nand everybody was filled with regret that such an ornament to the\r\nPeerage should have departed from them. The Conservative papers\r\nremembered how excellent a politician he had been in his younger\r\ndays, and the world was informed that the family of Grex of Grex was\r\nabout the oldest in Great Britain of which authentic records were in\r\nexistence. Then there came another note from Lady Mabel to Tregear.\r\n"I shall be in town on the 31st in the old house, with Miss\r\nCassewary, and will see you if you can come on the 1st. Come early,\r\nat eleven, if you can."\r\n\r\nOn the day named and at the hour fixed he was in Belgrave Square. He\r\nhad known this house since he was a boy, and could well remember\r\nhow, when he first entered it, he had thought with some awe of the\r\ngrandeur of the Earl. The Earl had then not paid much attention to\r\nhim, but he had become very much taken by the grace and good-nature\r\nof the girl who had owned him as a cousin. "You are my cousin Frank,"\r\nshe had said; "I am so glad to have a cousin." He could remember the\r\nwords now as though they had been spoken only yesterday. Then there\r\nhad quickly grown to be friendship between him and this, as he\r\nthought, sweetest of all girls. At that time he had just gone to\r\nEton; but before he left Eton they had sworn to love each other. And\r\nso it had been and the thing had grown, till at last, just when he\r\nhad taken his degree, two matters had been settled between them;\r\nthe first was that each loved the other irretrievably, irrevocably,\r\npassionately; the second, that it was altogether out of the question\r\nthat they should ever marry each other.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to Tregear to say that this last decision originated\r\nwith the lady. He had told her that he certainly would hold himself\r\nengaged to marry her at some future time; but she had thrown this\r\naside at once. How was it possible, she said, that two such beings,\r\nbrought up in luxury, and taught to enjoy all the good things of the\r\nworld, should expect to live and be happy together without an income?\r\nHe offered to go to the bar;--but she asked him whether he thought it\r\nwell that such a one as she should wait say a dozen years for such a\r\nprocess. "When the time comes, I should be an old woman and you would\r\nbe a wretched man." She released him,--declared her own purpose of\r\nmarrying well; and then, though there had been a moment in which her\r\nown assurance of her own love had been passionate enough, she went\r\nso far as to tell him that she was heart-whole. "We have been two\r\nfoolish children but we cannot be children any longer," she said.\r\n"There must be an end of it."\r\n\r\nWhat had hitherto been the result of this the reader knows,--and\r\nTregear knew also. He had taken the privilege given to him, and had\r\nmade so complete a use of it that he had in truth transferred his\r\nheart as well as his allegiance. Where is the young man who cannot\r\ndo so;--how few are there who do not do so when their first fit of\r\npassion has come on them at one-and-twenty? And he had thought that\r\nshe would do the same. But gradually he found that she had not done\r\nso, did not do so, could not do so! When she first heard of Lady Mary\r\nshe had not reprimanded him,--but she could not keep herself from\r\nshowing the bitterness of her disappointment. Though she would still\r\nboast of her own strength and of her own purpose, yet it was too\r\nclear to him that she was wounded and very sore. She would have\r\nliked him to remain single at any rate till she herself were married.\r\nBut the permission had been hardly given before he availed himself\r\nof it. And then he talked to her not only of the brilliancy of his\r\nprospects,--which she could have forgiven,--but of his love--his\r\nlove!\r\n\r\nThen she had refused one offer after another, and he had known it\r\nall. There was nothing in which she was concerned that she did not\r\ntell him. Then young Silverbridge had come across her, and she\r\nhad determined that he should be her husband. She had been nearly\r\nsuccessful,--so nearly that at moments she had felt sure of success.\r\nBut the prize had slipped from her through her own fault. She knew\r\nwell enough that it was her own fault. When a girl submits to play\r\nsuch a game as that, she should not stand on too nice scruples. She\r\nhad told herself this many a time since;--but the prize was gone.\r\n\r\nAll this Tregear knew, and knowing it almost dreaded the coming\r\ninterview. He could not without actual cruelty have avoided her. Had\r\nhe done so before he could not have continued to do so now, when she\r\nwas left alone in the world. Her father had not been much to her, but\r\nstill his presence had enabled her to put herself before the world as\r\nbeing somebody. Now she would be almost nobody. And she had lost her\r\nrich prize, while he,--out of the same treasury as it were,--had won\r\nhis!\r\n\r\nThe door was opened to him by the same old woman, and he was shown,\r\nat a funereal pace, up into the drawing-room which he had known so\r\nwell. He was told that Lady Mabel would be down to him directly. As\r\nhe looked about him he could see that already had been commenced that\r\nwork of division of spoil which is sure to follow the death of most\r\nof us. Things were already gone which used to be familiar to his\r\neyes, and the room, though not dismantled, had been deprived of many\r\nof its little prettinesses and was ugly.\r\n\r\nIn about ten minutes she came down to him,--with so soft a step that\r\nhe would not have been aware of her entrance had he not seen her\r\nform in the mirror. Then, when he turned round to greet her, he was\r\nastonished by the blackness of her appearance. She looked as though\r\nshe had become ten years older since he had last seen her. As she\r\ncame up to him she was grave and almost solemn in her gait, but there\r\nwas no sign of any tears. Why should there have been a tear? Women\r\nweep, and men too, not from grief, but from emotion. Indeed, grave\r\nand slow as was her step, and serious, almost solemn, as was her\r\ngait, there was something of a smile on her mouth as she gave him her\r\nhand. And yet her face was very sad, declaring to him too plainly\r\nsomething of the hopelessness of her heart. "And so the Duke has\r\nconsented," she said. He had told her that in his letter, but, since\r\nthat, her father had died, and she had been left, he did not as yet\r\nknow how far impoverished, but, he feared, with no pleasant worldly\r\nprospects before her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mabel;--that I suppose will be settled. I have been so shocked\r\nto hear all this."\r\n\r\n"It has been very sad;--has it not? Sit down, Frank. You and I have a\r\ngood deal to say to each other now that we have met. It was no good\r\nyour going down to Brighton. He would not have seen you, and at last\r\nI never left him."\r\n\r\n"Was Percival there?" She only shook her head. "That was dreadful."\r\n\r\n"It was not Percival\'s fault. He would not see him; nor till the\r\nlast hour or two would he believe in his own danger. Nor was he ever\r\nfrightened for a moment,--not even then."\r\n\r\n"Was he good to you?"\r\n\r\n"Good to me! Well;--he liked my being there. Poor papa! It had gone\r\nso far with him that he could not be good to any one. I think that he\r\nfelt that it would be unmanly not to be the same to the end."\r\n\r\n"He would not see Percival."\r\n\r\n"When it was suggested he would only ask what good Percival could do\r\nhim. I did send for him at last, in my terror, but he did not see his\r\nfather alive. When he did come he only told me how badly his father\r\nhad treated him! It was very dreadful!"\r\n\r\n"I did so feel for you."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you did, and will. After all, Frank, I think that the\r\npious godly people have the best of it in this world. Let them be\r\never so covetous, ever so false, ever so hard-hearted, the mere fact\r\nthat they must keep up appearances, makes them comfortable to those\r\naround them. Poor papa was not comfortable to me. A little hypocrisy,\r\na little sacrifice to the feelings of the world, may be such a\r\nblessing."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that you should feel it so."\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is sad. But you;--everything is smiling with you! Let us\r\ntalk about your plans."\r\n\r\n"Another time will do for that. I had come to hear about your own\r\naffairs."\r\n\r\n"There they are," she said, pointing round the room. "I have no other\r\naffairs. You see that I am going from here."\r\n\r\n"And where are you going?" She shook her head. "With whom will you\r\nlive?"\r\n\r\n"With Miss Cass,--two old maids together! I know nothing further."\r\n\r\n"But about money? That is if I am justified in asking."\r\n\r\n"What would you not be justified in asking? Do you not know that I\r\nwould tell you every secret of my heart,--if my heart had a secret?\r\nIt seems that I have given up what was to have been my fortune. There\r\nwas a claim of L12,000 on Grex. But I have abandoned it."\r\n\r\n"And there is nothing?"\r\n\r\n"There will be scrapings they tell me,--unless Percival refuses to\r\nagree. This house is mortgaged, but not for its value. And there are\r\nsome jewels. But all that is detestable,--a mere grovelling among\r\nmean hundreds; whereas you,--you will soar among--"\r\n\r\n"Oh Mabel! do not say hard things to me."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed! why should I,--I who have been preaching that\r\ncomfortable doctrine of hypocrisy? I will say nothing hard. But I\r\nwould sooner talk of your good things than of my evil ones."\r\n\r\n"I would not."\r\n\r\n"Then you must talk about them for my sake. How was it that the Duke\r\ncame round at last?"\r\n\r\n"I hardly know. She sent for me."\r\n\r\n"A fine high-spirited girl. These Pallisers have more courage about\r\nthem than one expects from their outward manner. Silverbridge has\r\nplenty of it."\r\n\r\n"I remember telling you he could be obstinate."\r\n\r\n"And I remember that I did not believe you. Now I know it. He has the\r\nsort of pluck which enables a man to break a girl\'s heart,--or to\r\ndestroy a girl\'s hopes,--without wincing. He can tell a girl to her\r\nface that she can go to the--mischief for him. There are so many men\r\nwho can\'t do that, from cowardice, though their hearts be ever so\r\nwell inclined. \'I have changed my mind.\' There is something great in\r\nthe courage of a man who can say that to a woman in so many words.\r\nMost of them, when they escape, escape by lies and subterfuges. Or\r\nthey run away and won\'t allow themselves to be heard of. They trust\r\nto a chapter of accidents, and leave things to arrange themselves.\r\nBut when a man can look a girl in the face with those seemingly soft\r\neyes, and say with that seemingly soft mouth,--\'I have changed my\r\nmind,\'--though she would look him dead in return if she could, still\r\nshe must admire him."\r\n\r\n"Are you speaking of Silverbridge now?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I am speaking of Silverbridge. I suppose I ought to hide\r\nit all and not to tell you. But as you are the only person I do\r\ntell, you must put up with me. Yes;--when I taxed him with his\r\nfalsehood,--for he had been false,--he answered me with those very\r\nwords! \'I have changed my mind.\' He could not lie. To speak the truth\r\nwas a necessity to him, even at the expense of his gallantry, almost\r\nof his humanity."\r\n\r\n"Has he been false to you, Mabel?"\r\n\r\n"Of course he has. But there is nothing to quarrel about, if you mean\r\nthat. People do not quarrel now about such things. A girl has to\r\nfight her own battle with her own pluck and her own wits. As with\r\nthese weapons she is generally stronger than her enemy, she succeeds\r\nsometimes although everything else is against her. I think I am\r\ncourageous, but his courage beat mine. I craned at the first fence.\r\nWhen he was willing to swallow my bait, my hand was not firm enough\r\nto strike the hook in his jaws. Had I not quailed then I think I\r\nshould have--\'had him\'."\r\n\r\n"It is horrid to hear you talk like this." She was leaning over from\r\nher seat, looking, black as she was, so much older than her wont,\r\nwith something about her of that unworldly serious thoughtfulness\r\nwhich a mourning garb always gives. And yet her words were so\r\nworldly, so unfeminine!\r\n\r\n"I have got to tell the truth to somebody. It was so, just as I have\r\nsaid. Of course I did not love him. How could I love him after what\r\nhas passed? But there need have been nothing much in that. I don\'t\r\nsuppose that Dukes\' eldest sons often get married for love."\r\n\r\n"Miss Boncassen loves him."\r\n\r\n"I dare say the beggar\'s daughter loved King Cophetua. When you come\r\nto distances such as that, there can be love. The very fact that a\r\nman should have descended so far in quest of beauty,--the flattery\r\nof it alone,--will produce love. When the angels came after the\r\ndaughters of men of course the daughters of men loved them. The\r\ndistance between him and me is not great enough to have produced that\r\nsort of worship. There was no reason why Lady Mabel Grex should not\r\nbe good enough wife for the son of the Duke of Omnium."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"And therefore I was not struck, as by the shining of a light from\r\nheaven. I cannot say I loved him. Frank,--I am beyond worshipping\r\neven an angel from heaven!"\r\n\r\n"Then I do not know that you could blame him," he said very\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n"Just so;--and as I have chosen to be honest I have told him\r\neverything. But I had my revenge first."\r\n\r\n"I would have said nothing."\r\n\r\n"You would have recommended--delicacy! No doubt you think that women\r\nshould be delicate, let them suffer what they may. A woman should\r\nnot let it be known that she has any human nature in her. I had him\r\non the hip, and for a moment I used my power. He had certainly done\r\nme a wrong. He had asked for my love,--and with the delicacy which\r\nyou commend, I had not at once grasped at all that such a request\r\nconveyed. Then, as he told me so frankly, \'he changed his mind!\' Did\r\nhe not wrong me?"\r\n\r\n"He should not have raised false hopes."\r\n\r\n"He told me that--he had changed his mind. I think I loved him then\r\nas nearly as ever I did,--because he looked me full in the face.\r\nThen,--I told him I had never cared for him, and that he need have\r\nnothing on his conscience. But I doubt whether he was glad to hear\r\nit. Men are so vain! I have talked too much of myself. And so you\r\nare to be the Duke\'s son-in-law. And she will have hundreds of\r\nthousands."\r\n\r\n"Thousands perhaps, but I do not think very much about it. I feel\r\nthat he will provide for her."\r\n\r\n"And that you, having secured her, can creep under his wing like\r\nan additional ducal chick. It is very comfortable. The Duke will\r\nbe quite a Providence to you. I wonder that all young gentlemen do\r\nnot marry heiresses;--it is so easy. And you have got your seat in\r\nParliament too! Oh, your luck! When I look back upon it all it seems\r\nso hard to me! It was for you,--for you that I used to be anxious.\r\nNow it is I who have not an inch of ground to stand upon." Then he\r\napproached her and put out his hand to her. "No," she said, putting\r\nboth her hands behind her back, "for God\'s sake let there be no\r\ntenderness. But is it not cruel? Think of my advantages at that\r\nmoment when you and I agreed that our paths should be separate. My\r\nfortune then had not been made quite shipwreck by my father and\r\nbrother. I had before me all that society could offer. I was called\r\nhandsome and clever. Where was there a girl more likely to make her\r\nway to the top?"\r\n\r\n"You may do so still."\r\n\r\n"No;--no;--I cannot. And you at least should not tell me so. I did\r\nnot know then the virulence of the malady which had fallen on me. I\r\ndid not know then that, because of you, other men would be abhorrent\r\nto me. I thought that I was as easy-hearted as you have proved\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"How cruel you can be."\r\n\r\n"Have I done anything to interfere with you? Have I said a word even\r\nto that young lad, when I might have said a word? Yes; to him I did\r\nsay something; but I waited, and would not say it, while a word could\r\nhurt you. Shall I tell you what I told him? Just everything that has\r\never happened between you and me."\r\n\r\n"You did?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--because I saw that I could trust him. I told him because I\r\nwanted him to be quite sure that I had never loved him. But, Frank,\r\nI have put no spoke in your wheel. There has not been a moment since\r\nyou told me of your love for this rich young lady in which I would\r\nnot have helped you had help been in my power. Whomever I may have\r\nharmed, I have never harmed you."\r\n\r\n"Am I not as clear from blame towards you?"\r\n\r\n"No, Frank. You have done me the terrible evil of ceasing to love\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"It was at your own bidding."\r\n\r\n"Certainly! but if I were to bid you to cut my throat, would you do\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Was it not you who decided that we could not wait for each other?"\r\n\r\n"And should it not have been for you to decide that you would wait?"\r\n\r\n"You also would have married."\r\n\r\n"It almost angers me that you should not see the difference. A girl\r\nunless she marries becomes nothing, as I have become nothing now. A\r\nman does not want a pillar on which to lean. A man, when he has done\r\nas you had done with me, and made a girl\'s heart all his own, even\r\nthough his own heart had been flexible and plastic as yours is,\r\nshould have been true to her, at least for a while. Did it never\r\noccur to you that you owed something to me?"\r\n\r\n"I have always owed you very much."\r\n\r\n"There should have been some touch of chivalry if not of love to make\r\nyou feel that a second passion should have been postponed for a year\r\nor two. You could wait without growing old. You might have allowed\r\nyourself a little space to dwell--I was going to say on the sweetness\r\nof your memories. But they were not sweet, Frank; they were not sweet\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"These rebukes, Mabel, will rob them of their sweetness,--for a\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"It is gone; all gone," she said, shaking her head,--"gone from me\r\nbecause I have been so easily deserted; gone from you because the\r\nchange has been so easy to you. How long was it, Frank, after you had\r\nleft me before you were basking happily in the smiles of Lady Mary\r\nPalliser?"\r\n\r\n"It was not very long, as months go."\r\n\r\n"Say days, Frank."\r\n\r\n"I have to defend myself, and I will do so with truth. It was not\r\nvery long,--as months go; but why should it have been less long,\r\nwhether for months or days? I had to cure myself of a wound."\r\n\r\n"To put a plaster on a scratch, Frank."\r\n\r\n"And the sooner a man can do that the more manly he is. Is it a sign\r\nof strength to wail under a sorrow that cannot be cured,--or of truth\r\nto perpetuate the appearance of a woe?"\r\n\r\n"Has it been an appearance with me?"\r\n\r\n"I am speaking of myself now. I am driven to speak of myself by the\r\nbitterness of your words. It was you who decided."\r\n\r\n"You accepted my decision easily."\r\n\r\n"Because it was based not only on my unfitness for such a marriage,\r\nbut on yours. When I saw that there would be perhaps some years of\r\nmisery for you, of course I accepted your decision. The sweetness had\r\nbeen very sweet to me."\r\n\r\n"Oh Frank, was it ever sweet to you?"\r\n\r\n"And the triumph of it had been very great. I had been assured of the\r\nlove of her who among all the high ones of the world seemed to me to\r\nbe the highest. Then came your decision. Do you really believe that\r\nI could abandon the sweetness, that I could be robbed of my triumph,\r\nthat I could think I could never again be allowed to put my arm round\r\nyour waist, never again to feel your cheek close to mine, that I\r\nshould lose all that had seemed left to me among the gods, without\r\nfeeling it?"\r\n\r\n"Frank, Frank!" she said, rising to her feet, and stretching out her\r\nhands as though she were going to give him back all these joys.\r\n\r\n"Of course I felt it. I did not then know what was before me." When\r\nhe said this she sank back immediately upon her seat. "I was wretched\r\nenough. I had lost a limb and could not walk; my eyes, and must\r\nalways hereafter be blind; my fitness to be among men, and must\r\nalways hereafter be secluded. It is so that a man is stricken down\r\nwhen some terrible trouble comes upon him. But it is given to him to\r\nretrick his beams."\r\n\r\n"You have retricked yours."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--and the strong man will show his strength by doing it quickly.\r\nMabel, I sorrowed for myself greatly when that word was spoken,\r\npartly because I thought that your love could so easily be taken from\r\nme. And, since I have found that it has not been so, I have sorrowed\r\nfor you also. But I do not blame myself, and--and I will not submit\r\nto have blame even from you." She stared him in the face as he said\r\nthis. "A man should never submit to blame."\r\n\r\n"But if he has deserved it?"\r\n\r\n"Who is to be the judge? But why should we contest this? You do not\r\nreally wish to trample on me!"\r\n\r\n"No;--not that."\r\n\r\n"Nor to disgrace me; nor to make me feel myself disgraced in my own\r\njudgment?" Then there was a pause for some moments as though he had\r\nleft her without another word to say. "Shall I go now?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh Frank!"\r\n\r\n"I fear that my presence only makes you unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Then what will your absence do? When shall I see you again? But,\r\nno; I will not see you again. Not for many days,--not for years. Why\r\nshould I? Frank, is it wicked that I should love you?" He could only\r\nshake his head in answer to this. "If it be so wicked that I must\r\nbe punished for it eternally, still I love you. I can never, never,\r\nnever love another. You cannot understand it. Oh God,--that I had\r\nnever understood it myself! I think, I think, that I would go with\r\nyou now anywhere, facing all misery, all judgments, all disgrace. You\r\nknow, do you not, that if it were possible, I should not say so. But\r\nas I know that you would not stir a step with me, I do say so."\r\n\r\n"I know it is not meant."\r\n\r\n"It is meant, though it could not be done. Frank, I must not see her,\r\nnot for awhile; not for years. I do not wish to hate her, but how\r\ncan I help it? Do you remember when she flew into your arms in this\r\nroom?"\r\n\r\n"I remember it."\r\n\r\n"Of course you do. It is your great joy now to remember that, and\r\nsuch like. She must be very good! Though I hate her!"\r\n\r\n"Do not say that you hate her, Mabel."\r\n\r\n"Though I hate her she must be good. It was a fine and a brave thing\r\nto do. I have done it; but never before the world like that; have I,\r\nFrank? Oh, Frank, I shall never do it again. Go now, and do not touch\r\nme. Let us both pray that in ten years we may meet as passionless\r\nfriends." He came to her hardly knowing what he meant, but purposing,\r\nas though by instinct, to take her hand as he parted from her. But\r\nshe, putting both her hands before her face, and throwing herself on\r\nto the sofa, buried her head among the cushions.\r\n\r\n"Is there not to be another word?" he said. Lying as she did, she\r\nstill was able to make a movement of dissent, and he left her,\r\nmuttering just one word between his teeth, "Mabel, good-bye."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII\r\n\r\nThe Duke Returns to Office\r\n\r\n\r\nThat farewell took place on the Friday morning. Tregear as he walked\r\nout of the Square knew now that he had been the cause of a great\r\nshipwreck. At first when that passionate love had been declared,--he\r\ncould hardly remember whether with the fullest passion by him or by\r\nher,--he had been as a god walking upon air. That she who seemed\r\nto be so much above him should have owned that she was all his own\r\nseemed then to be world enough for him. For a few weeks he lived a\r\nhero to himself, and was able to tell himself that for him the glory\r\nof a passion was sufficient. In those halcyon moments no common human\r\ncare is allowed to intrude itself. To one who has thus entered in\r\nupon the heroism of romance his own daily work, his dinners, clothes,\r\nincome, father and mother, sisters and brothers, his own street\r\nand house are nothing. Hunting, shooting, rowing, Alpine-climbing,\r\neven speeches in Parliament,--if they perchance have been attained\r\nto,--all become leather or prunella. The heavens have been opened to\r\nhim, and he walks among them like a god. So it had been with Tregear.\r\nThen had come the second phase of his passion,--which is also not\r\nuncommon to young men who soar high in their first assaults. He was\r\ntold that it would not do; and was not so told by a hard-hearted\r\nparent, but by the young lady herself. And she had spoken so\r\nreasonably, that he had yielded, and had walked away with that sudden\r\nfeeling of a vile return to his own mean belongings, to his lodgings,\r\nand his income, which not a few ambitious young men have experienced.\r\nBut she had convinced him. Then had come the journey to Italy, and\r\nthe reader knows all the rest. He certainly had not derogated in\r\ntransferring his affections,--but it may be doubted whether in his\r\nsecond love he had walked among the stars as in the first. A man can\r\nhardly mount twice among the stars. But he had been as eager,--and\r\nas true. And he had succeeded, without any flaw on his conscience.\r\nIt had been agreed, when that first disruption took place, that he\r\nand Mabel should be friends; and, as to a friend, he had told her of\r\nhis hopes. When first she had mingled something of sarcasm with her\r\ncongratulations, though it had annoyed him, it had hardly made him\r\nunhappy. When she called him Romeo and spoke of herself as Rosaline,\r\nhe took her remark as indicating some petulance rather than an\r\nenduring love. That had been womanly and he could forgive it. He\r\nhad his other great and solid happiness to support him. Then he had\r\nbelieved that she would soon marry, if not Silverbridge, then some\r\nother fitting young nobleman, and that all would be well. But now\r\nthings were very far from well. The storm which was now howling round\r\nher afflicted him much.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the bitterest feeling of all was that her love should have\r\nbeen so much stronger, so much more enduring than his own. He could\r\nnot but remember how in his first agony he had blamed her because she\r\nhad declared that they should be severed. He had then told himself\r\nthat such severing would be to him impossible, and that had her\r\nnature been as high as his, it would have been as impossible to her.\r\nWhich nature must he now regard as the higher? She had done her best\r\nto rid herself of the load of her passion and had failed. But he had\r\nfreed himself with convenient haste. All that he had said as to the\r\nmanliness of conquering grief had been wise enough. But still he\r\ncould not quit himself of some feeling of disgrace in that he had\r\nchanged and she had not. He tried to comfort himself with reflecting\r\nthat Mary was all his own,--that in that matter he had been\r\nvictorious and happy;--but for an hour or two he thought more of\r\nMabel than of Mary.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came in which he could employ himself he called\r\nfor Silverbridge, and they walked together across the park to\r\nWestminster. Silverbridge was gay and full of eagerness as to the\r\ncoming ministerial statement, but Tregear could not turn his mind\r\nfrom the work of the morning. "I don\'t seem to care very much about\r\nit," he said at last.\r\n\r\n"I do care very much," said Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"What difference will it make?"\r\n\r\n"I breakfasted with the governor this morning, and I have not seen\r\nhim in such good spirits since--, well, for a long time." The date to\r\nwhich Silverbridge would have referred, had he not checked himself,\r\nwas that of the evening on which it had been agreed between him and\r\nhis father that Mabel Grex should be promoted to the seat of highest\r\nhonour in the house of Palliser,--but that was a matter which must\r\nhenceforward be buried in silence. "He did not say as much, but\r\nI feel perfectly sure that he and Mr. Monk have arranged a new\r\ngovernment."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see any matter for joy in that to Conservatives like you and\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"He is my father,--and as he is going to be your father-in-law I\r\nshould have thought that you might have been pleased."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--if he likes it. But I have heard so often of the crushing\r\ncares of office, and I had thought that of all living men he had been\r\nthe most crushed by them."\r\n\r\nAll that had to be done in the House of Commons on that afternoon\r\nwas finished before five o\'clock. By half-past five the House, and\r\nall the purlieus of the House, were deserted. And yet at four,\r\nimmediately after prayers, there had been such a crowd that members\r\nhad been unable to find seats! Tregear and Silverbridge having been\r\nearly had succeeded, but those who had been less careful were obliged\r\nto listen as best they could in the galleries. The stretching out of\r\nnecks and the holding of hands behind the ears did not last long.\r\nSir Timothy had not had much to say, but what he did say was spoken\r\nwith a dignity which seemed to anticipate future exaltation rather\r\nthan present downfall. There had arisen a question in regard to\r\nrevenue,--he need hardly tell them that it was that question in\r\nreference to brewers\' licences to which the honourable gentleman\r\nopposite had alluded on the previous day,--as to which unfortunately\r\nhe was not in accord with his noble friend the Prime Minister. Under\r\nthe circumstances it was hardly possible that they should at once\r\nproceed to business, and he therefore moved that the House should\r\nstand adjourned till Tuesday next. That was the whole statement.\r\n\r\nNot very long afterwards the Prime Minister made another statement\r\nin the House of Lords. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer had very\r\nsuddenly resigned and had thereby broken up the Ministry, he had\r\nfound himself compelled to place his resignation in the hands of\r\nher Majesty. Then that House was also adjourned. On that afternoon\r\nall the clubs were alive with admiration at the great cleverness\r\ndisplayed by Sir Timothy in this transaction. It was not only that\r\nhe had succeeded in breaking up the Ministry, and that he had done\r\nthis without incurring violent disgrace; but he had so done it as\r\nto throw all the reproach upon his late unfortunate colleague. It\r\nwas thus that Mr. Lupton explained it. Sir Timothy had been at the\r\npains to ascertain on what matters connected with the Revenue, Lord\r\nDrummond,--or Lord Drummond\'s closest advisers,--had opinions of\r\ntheir own, opinions strong enough not to be abandoned; and having\r\ndiscovered that, he also discovered arguments on which to found an\r\nexactly contrary opinion. But as the Revenue had been entrusted\r\nspecially to his unworthy hands, he was entitled to his own opinion\r\non this matter. "The majority of the House," said Mr. Lupton,\r\n"and the entire public, will no doubt give him credit for great\r\nself-abnegation."\r\n\r\nAll this happened on the Friday. During the Saturday it was\r\nconsidered probable that the Cabinet would come to terms with itself,\r\nand that internal wounds would be healed. The general opinion was\r\nthat Lord Drummond would give way. But on the Sunday morning it was\r\nunderstood that Lord Drummond would not yield. It was reported that\r\nLord Drummond was willing to purchase his separation from Sir Timothy\r\neven at the expense of his office. That Sir Timothy should give way\r\nseemed to be impossible. Had he done so it would have been impossible\r\nfor him to recover the respect of the House. Then it was rumoured\r\nthat two or three others had gone with Sir Timothy. And on Monday\r\nmorning it was proclaimed that the Prime Minister was not in a\r\ncondition to withdraw his resignation. On the Tuesday the House met\r\nand Mr. Monk announced, still from the Opposition benches, that\r\nhe had that morning been with the Queen. Then there was another\r\nadjournment, and all the Liberals knew that the gates of Paradise\r\nwere again about to be opened to them.\r\n\r\nThis is only interesting to us as affecting the happiness and\r\ncharacter of our Duke. He had consented to assist Mr. Monk in forming\r\na government, and to take office under Mr. Monk\'s leadership. He\r\nhad had many contests with himself before he could bring himself\r\nto this submission. He knew that if anything could once again make\r\nhim contented it would be work; he knew that if he could serve his\r\ncountry it was his duty to serve it; and he knew also that it was\r\nonly by the adhesion of such men as himself that the traditions of\r\nhis party could be maintained. But he had been Prime Minister,--and\r\nhe was sure he could never be Prime Minister again. There are in\r\nall matters certain little, almost hidden, signs, by which we can\r\nmeasure within our own bosoms the extent of our successes and our\r\nfailures. Our Duke\'s friends had told him that his Ministry had been\r\nserviceable to the country; but no one had ever suggested to him that\r\nhe would again be asked to fill the place which he had filled. He\r\nhad stopped a gap. He would beforehand have declared himself willing\r\nto serve his country even in this way; but having done so,--having\r\ndone that and no more than that,--he felt that he had failed. He had\r\nin his soreness declared to himself that he would never more take\r\noffice. He had much to do to overcome this promise to himself;--but\r\nwhen he had brought himself to submit, he was certainly a happier\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThere was no going to see the Queen. That on the present occasion\r\nwas done simply by Mr. Monk. But on the Wednesday morning his name\r\nappeared in the list of the new Cabinet as President of the Council.\r\nHe was perhaps a little fidgety, a little too anxious to employ\r\nhimself and to be employed, a little too desirous of immediate\r\nwork;--but still he was happy and gracious to those around him. "I\r\nsuppose you like that particular office," Silverbridge said to him.\r\n\r\n"Well; yes;--not best of all, you know," and he smiled as he made\r\nthis admission.\r\n\r\n"You mean Prime Minister?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed I don\'t. I am inclined to think that the Premier should\r\nalways sit in your House. No, Silverbridge. If I could have my\r\nway,--which is of course impossible, for I cannot put off my\r\nhonours,--I would return to my old place. I would return to the\r\nExchequer where the work is hard and certain, where a man can do,\r\nor at any rate attempt to do, some special thing. A man there if he\r\nsticks to that and does not travel beyond it, need not be popular,\r\nneed not be a partisan, need not be eloquent, need not be a courtier.\r\nHe should understand his profession, as should a lawyer or a doctor.\r\nIf he does that thoroughly he can serve his country without recourse\r\nto that parliamentary strategy for which I know that I am unfit."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t do that in the House of Lords, sir."\r\n\r\n"No; no. I wish the title could have passed over my head,\r\nSilverbridge, and gone to you at once. I think we both should have\r\nbeen suited better. But there are things which one should not\r\nconsider. Even in this place I may perhaps do something. Shall you\r\nattack us very bitterly?"\r\n\r\n"I am the only man who does not mean to make any change."\r\n\r\n"How so?"\r\n\r\n"I shall stay where I am,--on the Government side of the House."\r\n\r\n"Are you clear about that, my boy?"\r\n\r\n"Quite clear."\r\n\r\n"Such changes should not be made without very much consideration."\r\n\r\n"I have already written to them at Silverbridge and have had three\r\nor four answers. Mr. De Boung says that the borough is more than\r\ngrateful. Mr. Sprout regrets it much, and suggests a few months\'\r\nconsideration. Mr. Sprugeon seems to think it does not signify."\r\n\r\n"That is hardly complimentary."\r\n\r\n"No,--not to me. But he is very civil to the family. As long as a\r\nPalliser represents the borough, Mr. Sprugeon thinks that it does not\r\nmatter much on which side he may sit. I have had my little vagary,\r\nand I don\'t think that I shall change again."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is your republican bride-elect that has done that,"\r\nsaid the Duke, laughing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX\r\n\r\nThe First Wedding\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Easter Sunday fell on the 17th April, and as the arrangement of\r\nthe new Cabinet, with its inferior offices, was not completed till\r\nthe 6th of that month, there was only just time for the new elections\r\nbefore the holidays. Mr. Monk sat on his bench so comfortably that\r\nhe hardly seemed ever to have been off it. And Phineas Finn resumed\r\nthe peculiar ministerial tone of voice just as though he had never\r\nallowed himself to use the free and indignant strains of opposition.\r\nAs to a majority,--nothing as yet was known about that. Some few\r\nbesides Silverbridge might probably transfer themselves to the\r\nGovernment. None of the ministers lost their seats at the new\r\nelections. The opposite party seemed for a while to have been\r\nparalysed by the defection of Sir Timothy, and men who liked a quiet\r\nlife were able to comfort themselves with the reflection that nothing\r\ncould be done this Session.\r\n\r\nFor our lovers this was convenient. Neither of them would have\r\nallowed their parliamentary energies to have interfered at such a\r\ncrisis with his domestic affairs; but still it was well to have time\r\nat command. The day for the marriage of Isabel and Silverbridge had\r\nbeen now fixed. That was to take place on the Wednesday after Easter,\r\nand was to be celebrated by special royal favour in the chapel at\r\nWhitehall. All the Pallisers would be there, and all the relations\r\nof all the Pallisers, all the ambassadors, and of course all the\r\nAmericans in London. It would be a "wretched grind," as Silverbridge\r\nsaid, but it had to be done. In the meantime the whole party,\r\nincluding the new President of the Council, were down at Matching.\r\nEven Isabel, though it must be presumed that she had much to do in\r\nlooking after her bridal garments, was able to be there for a day\r\nor two. But Tregear was the person to whom this visit was of the\r\ngreatest importance.\r\n\r\nHe had been allowed to see Lady Mary in London, but hardly to do more\r\nthan see her. With her he had been alone for about five minutes, and\r\nthen cruel circumstances,--circumstances, however, which were not\r\npermanently cruel,--had separated them. All their great difficulties\r\nhad been settled, and no doubt they were happy. Tregear, though\r\nhe had been as it were received into grace by that glass of wine,\r\nstill had not entered into the intimacies of the house. This he felt\r\nhimself. He had been told that he had better restrain himself from\r\nwriting to Mary, and he had restrained himself. He had therefore no\r\nimmediate opportunity of creeping into that perfect intimacy with\r\nthe house and household which is generally accorded to a promised\r\nson-in-law.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion he travelled down alone, and as he approached the\r\nhouse he, who was not by nature timid, felt himself to be somewhat\r\ncowed. That the Duke should not be cold to him was almost impossible.\r\nOf course he was there in opposition to the Duke\'s wishes. Even\r\nSilverbridge had never quite liked the match. Of course he was to\r\nhave all that he desired. Of course he was the most fortunate of men.\r\nOf course no man had ever stronger reason to be contented with the\r\ngirl he loved. But still his heart was a little low as he was driven\r\nup to the door.\r\n\r\nThe first person whom he saw was the Duke himself, who, as the fly\r\nfrom the station arrived, was returning from his walk. "You are\r\nwelcome to Matching," he said, taking off his hat with something of\r\nceremony. This was said before the servants, but Tregear was then\r\nled into the study and the door was closed. "I never do anything by\r\nhalves, Mr. Tregear," he said. "Since it is to be so you shall be the\r\nsame to me as though you had come under other auspices. Of yourself\r\npersonally I hear all that is good. Consider yourself at home here,\r\nand in all things use me as your friend." Tregear endeavoured to make\r\nsome reply, but could not find words that were fitting. "I think that\r\nthe young people are out," continued the Duke. "Mr. Warburton will\r\nhelp you to find them if you like to go upon the search." The words\r\nhad been very gracious, but still there was something in the manner\r\nof the man which made Tregear find it almost impossible to regard him\r\nas he might have regarded another father-in-law. He had often heard\r\nthe Duke spoken of as a man who could become awful if he pleased,\r\nalmost without an effort. He had been told of the man\'s mingled\r\nsimplicity, courtesy, and self-assertion against which no impudence\r\nor raillery could prevail. And now he seemed to understand it.\r\n\r\nHe was not driven to go under the private secretary\'s escort in\r\nquest of the young people. Mary had understood her business much\r\nbetter than that. "If you please, sir, Lady Mary is in the little\r\ndrawing-room," said a well-arrayed young girl to him as soon as the\r\nDuke\'s door was closed. This was Lady Mary\'s own maid who had been on\r\nthe look-out for the fly. Lady Mary had known all details, as to the\r\narrival of the trains and the length of the journey from the station,\r\nand had not been walking with the other young people when the Duke\r\nhad intercepted her lover. Even that delay she had thought was hard.\r\nThe discreet maid opened the door of the little drawing-room,--and\r\ndiscreetly closed it instantly. "At last!" she said, throwing herself\r\ninto his arms.\r\n\r\n"Yes,--at last."\r\n\r\nOn this occasion time did not envy them. The long afternoons of\r\nspring had come, and as Tregear had reached the house between four\r\nand five they were able to go out together before the sun set.\r\n"No," she said when he came to inquire as to her life during the\r\nlast twelve months; "you had not much to be afraid of as to my\r\nforgetting."\r\n\r\n"But when everything was against me?"\r\n\r\n"One thing was not against you. You ought to have been sure of that."\r\n\r\n"And so I was. And yet I felt that I ought not to have been sure.\r\nSometimes, in my solitude, I used to think that I myself had been\r\nwrong. I began to doubt whether under any circumstances I could have\r\nbeen justified in asking your father\'s daughter to be my wife."\r\n\r\n"Because of his rank?"\r\n\r\n"Not so much his rank as his money."\r\n\r\n"Ought that to be considered?"\r\n\r\n"A poor man who marries a rich woman will always be suspected."\r\n\r\n"Because people are so mean and poor-spirited; and because they think\r\nthat money is more than anything else. It should be nothing at all\r\nin such matters. I don\'t know how it can be anything. They have been\r\nsaying that to me all along,--as though one were to stop to think\r\nwhether one was rich or poor." Tregear, when this was said, could not\r\nbut remember that at a time not very much prior to that at which Mary\r\nhad not stopped to think, neither for a while had he and Mabel. "I\r\nsuppose it was worse for me than for you," she added.\r\n\r\n"I hope not."\r\n\r\n"But it was, Frank; and therefore I ought to have it made up to me\r\nnow. It was very bad to be alone here, particularly when I felt that\r\npapa always looked at me as though I were a sinner. He did not mean\r\nit, but he could not help looking at me like that. And there was\r\nnobody to whom I could say a word."\r\n\r\n"It was pretty much the same with me."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but you were not offending a father who could not keep himself\r\nfrom looking reproaches at you. I was like a boy at school who had\r\nbeen put into Coventry. And then they sent me to Lady Cantrip!"\r\n\r\n"Was that very bad?"\r\n\r\n"I do believe that if I were a young woman with a well-ordered mind,\r\nI should feel myself very much indebted to Lady Cantrip. She had a\r\nterrible task of it. But I could not teach myself to like her. I\r\nbelieve she knew all through that I should get my way at last."\r\n\r\n"That ought to have made you friends."\r\n\r\n"But yet she tried everything she could. And when I told her about\r\nthat meeting up at Lord Grex\'s, she was so shocked! Do you remember\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"Do I remember it!"\r\n\r\n"Were not you shocked?" This question was not to be answered by any\r\nword. "I was," she continued. "It was an awful thing to do; but I was\r\ndetermined to show them all that I was in earnest. Do you remember\r\nhow Miss Cassewary looked?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Cassewary knew all about it."\r\n\r\n"I daresay she did. And so I suppose did Mabel Grex. I had thought\r\nthat perhaps I might make Mabel a confidante, but--" Then she looked\r\nup into his face.\r\n\r\n"But what?"\r\n\r\n"You like Mabel, do you not? I do."\r\n\r\n"I like her very, very much."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you have liked her too well for that, eh, Frank?"\r\n\r\n"Too well for what?"\r\n\r\n"That she should have heard all that I had to say about you with\r\nsympathy. If so, I am so sorry."\r\n\r\n"You need not fear that I have ever for a moment been untrue either\r\nto her or you."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you have not to me. Poor Mabel! Then they took me to\r\nCustins. That was worst of all. I cannot quite tell you what happened\r\nthere." Of course he asked her,--but, as she had said, she could not\r\nquite tell him about Lord Popplecourt.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Duke asked his guest in a playful tone what was\r\nhis Christian name. It could hardly be that he should not have known,\r\nbut yet he asked the question. "Francis Oliphant," said Tregear.\r\n"Those are two Christian names I suppose, but what do they call you\r\nat home?"\r\n\r\n"Frank," whispered Mary, who was with them.\r\n\r\n"Then I will call you Frank, if you will allow me. The use of\r\nChristian names is, I think, pleasant and hardly common enough among\r\nus. I almost forget my own boy\'s name because the practice has grown\r\nup of calling him by a title."\r\n\r\n"I am going to call him Abraham," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Abraham is a good name, only I do not think he got it from his\r\ngodfathers and godmothers."\r\n\r\n"Who can call a man Plantagenet? I should as soon think of calling my\r\nfather-in-law Coeur de Lion."\r\n\r\n"So he is," said Mary. Whereupon the Duke kissed the two girls and\r\nwent his way,--showing that by this time he had adopted the one and\r\nthe proposed husband of the other into his heart.\r\n\r\nThe day before the Duke started for London to be present at the grand\r\nmarriage he sent for Frank. "I suppose," said he, "that you would\r\nwish that some time should be fixed for your own marriage." To this\r\nthe accepted suitor of course assented. "But before we can do that\r\nsomething must be settled about--money." Tregear when he heard this\r\nbecame hot all over, and felt that he could not restrain his blushes.\r\nSuch must be the feeling of a man when he finds himself compelled to\r\nown to a girl\'s father that he intends to live upon her money and not\r\nupon his own. "I do not like to be troublesome," continued the Duke,\r\n"or to ask questions which might seem to be impertinent."\r\n\r\n"Oh no! Of course I feel my position. I can only say that it was not\r\nbecause your daughter might probably have money that I first sought\r\nher love."\r\n\r\n"It shall be so received. And now-- But perhaps it will be best that\r\nyou should arrange all this with my man of business. Mr. Moreton\r\nshall be instructed. Mr. Moreton lives near my place in Barsetshire,\r\nbut is now in London. If you will call on him he shall tell you what\r\nI would suggest. I hope you will find that your affairs will be\r\ncomfortable. And now as to the time."\r\n\r\nIsabel\'s wedding was declared by the newspapers to have been one of\r\nthe most brilliant remembered in the metropolis. There were six\r\nbridesmaids, of whom of course Mary was one,--and of whom poor Lady\r\nMabel Grex was equally of course not another. Poor Lady Mabel was at\r\nthis time with Miss Cassewary at Grex, paying what she believed would\r\nbe a last visit to the old family home. Among the others were two\r\nAmerican girls, brought into that august society for the sake of\r\ncourtesy rather than of personal love. And there were two other\r\nPalliser girls and a Scotch McCloskie cousin. The breakfast was of\r\ncourse given by Mr. Boncassen at his house in Brook Street, where the\r\nbridal presents were displayed. And not only were they displayed; but\r\na list of them, with an approximating statement as to their value,\r\nappeared in one or two of the next day\'s newspapers;--as to which\r\nterrible sin against good taste neither was Mr. or Mrs. Boncassen\r\nguilty. But in these days, in which such splendid things were done\r\non so very splendid a scale, a young lady cannot herself lay out\r\nher friends\' gifts so as to be properly seen by her friends. Some\r\nwell-skilled, well-paid hand is needed even for that, and hence comes\r\nthis public information on affairs which should surely be private.\r\nIn our grandmothers\' time the happy bride\'s happy mother herself\r\ncompounded the cake;--or at any rate the trusted housekeeper.\r\nBut we all know that terrible tower of silver which now stands\r\nniddle-noddling with its appendages of flags and spears on the modern\r\nwedding breakfast-table. It will come to pass with some of us soon\r\nthat we must deny ourselves the pleasure of having young friends,\r\nbecause their marriage presents are so costly.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Boncassen had not perhaps a happy time with her august\r\nguests on that morning; but when she retired to give Isabel her last\r\nkiss in privacy she did feel proud to think that her daughter would\r\nsome day be an English Duchess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX\r\n\r\nThe Second Wedding\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember is not altogether an hymeneal month, but it was not till\r\nNovember that Lady Mary Palliser became the wife of Frank Tregear. It\r\nwas postponed a little, perhaps, in order that the Silverbridges,--as\r\nthey were now called,--might be present. The Silverbridges, who were\r\nnow quite Darby and Joan, had gone to the States when the Session\r\nhad been brought to a close early in August, and had remained there\r\nnearly three months. Isabel had taken infinite pleasure in showing\r\nher English husband to her American friends, and the American friends\r\nhad no doubt taken a pride in seeing so glorious a British husband\r\nin the hands of an American wife. Everything was new to Silverbridge,\r\nand he was happy in his new possession. She too enjoyed it\r\ninfinitely, and so it happened that they had been unwilling to\r\ncurtail their sojourn. But in November they had to return, because\r\nMary had declared that her marriage should be postponed till it could\r\nbe graced by the presence of her elder brother.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Silverbridge had been August. There had been a\r\nmanifest intention that it should be so. Nobody knew with whom this\r\noriginated. Mrs. Boncassen had probably been told that it ought to\r\nbe so, and Mr. Boncassen had been willing to pay the bill. External\r\nforces had perhaps operated. The Duke had simply been passive and\r\nobedient. There had however been a general feeling that the bride\r\nof the heir of the house of Omnium should be produced to the world\r\namidst a blare of trumpets and a glare of torches. So it had been.\r\nBut both the Duke and Mary were determined that this other wedding\r\nshould be different. It was to take place at Matching, and none would\r\nbe present but they who were staying in the house, or who lived\r\naround,--such as tenants and dependants. Four clergymen united their\r\nforces to tie Isabel to her husband, one of whom was a bishop, one a\r\ncanon, and the two others royal chaplains; but there was only to be\r\nthe Vicar of the parish at Matching. And indeed there were no guests\r\nin the house except the two bridesmaids and Mr. and Mrs. Finn. As to\r\nMrs. Finn, Mary had made a request, and then the Duke had suggested\r\nthat the husband should be asked to accompany his wife.\r\n\r\nIt was very pretty. The church itself is pretty, standing in\r\nthe park, close to the ruins of the old Priory, not above three\r\nhundred yards from the house. And they all walked, taking the broad\r\npathway through the ruins, going under that figure of Sir Guy which\r\nSilverbridge had pointed out to Isabel when they had been whispering\r\nthere together. The Duke led the way with his girl upon his arm.\r\nThe two bridesmaids followed. Then Silverbridge and his wife, with\r\nPhineas and his wife. Gerald and the bridegroom accompanied them,\r\nbelonging as it were to the same party! It was very rustic;--almost\r\nimproper! "This is altogether wrong, you know," said Gerald. "You\r\nshould appear coming from some other part of the world, as if you\r\nwere almost unexpected. You ought not to have been in the house at\r\nall, and certainly should have gone under some disguise."\r\n\r\nThere had been rich presents too on this occasion, but they were\r\nshown to none except to Mrs. Finn and the bridesmaids,--and perhaps\r\nto the favoured servants in the house. At any rate there was nothing\r\nsaid of them in the newspapers. One present there was,--given not to\r\nthe bride but to the bridegroom,--which he showed to no one except to\r\nher. This came to him only on the morning of his marriage, and the\r\nenvelope containing it bore the postmark of Sedbergh. He knew the\r\nhandwriting well before he opened the parcel. It contained a small\r\nsignet-ring with his crest, and with it there were but a few words\r\nwritten on a scrap of paper. "I pray that you may be happy. This was\r\nto have been given to you long ago, but I kept it back because of\r\nthat decision." He showed the ring to Mary and told her it had come\r\nfrom Lady Mabel;--but the scrap of paper no one saw but himself.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the matter most remarkable in the wedding was the hilarity of\r\nthe Duke. One who did not know him well might have said that he was a\r\nman with few cares, and who now took special joy in the happiness of\r\nhis children,--who was thoroughly contented to see them marry after\r\ntheir own hearts. And yet, as he stood there on the altar-steps\r\ngiving his daughter to that new son and looking first at his girl,\r\nand then at his married son, he was reminding himself of all that he\r\nhad suffered.\r\n\r\nAfter the breakfast,--which was by no means a grand repast and at\r\nwhich the cake did not look so like an ill-soldered silver castle as\r\nthat other construction had done,--the happy couple were sent away in\r\na modest chariot to the railway station, and not above half-a-dozen\r\nslippers were thrown after them. There were enough for luck,--or\r\nperhaps there might have been luck even without them, for the wife\r\nthoroughly respected her husband, as did the husband his wife. Mrs.\r\nFinn, when she was alone with Phineas, said a word or two about Frank\r\nTregear. "When she first told me of her engagement I did not think it\r\npossible that she should marry him. But after he had been with me I\r\nfelt sure that he would succeed."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," said Silverbridge to the Duke when they were out\r\ntogether in the park that afternoon, "what do you think about him?"\r\n\r\n"I think he is a manly young man."\r\n\r\n"He is certainly that. And then he knows things and understands them.\r\nIt was never a surprise to me that Mary should have been so fond of\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"I do not know that one ought to be surprised at anything. Perhaps\r\nwhat surprised me most was that he should have looked so high. There\r\nseemed to be so little to justify it. But now I will accept that as\r\ncourage which I before regarded as arrogance."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DUKE\'S CHILDREN***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 3622.txt or 3622.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/3/6/2/3622\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
