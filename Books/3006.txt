And for the fifth summer in succession,\r\nStalky, McTurk, and Beetle (this was before they reached the dignity of\r\na study) had built like beavers a place of retreat and meditation, where\r\nthey smoked.\r\n\r\nNow, there was nothing in their characters as known to Mr. Prout,\r\ntheir house-master, at all commanding respect; nor did Foxy, the\r\nsubtle red-haired school Sergeant, trust them. His business was to wear\r\ntennis-shoes, carry binoculars, and swoop hawklike upon evil boys. Had\r\nhe taken the field alone, that hut would have been raided, for Foxy\r\nknew the manners of his quarry; but Providence moved Mr. Prout,\r\nwhose school-name, derived from the size of his feet, was Hoofer, to\r\ninvestigate on his own account; and it was the cautious Stalky who\r\nfound the track of his pugs on the very floor of their lair one peaceful\r\nafternoon when Stalky would fain have forgotten Prout and his works in\r\na volume of Surtees and a new briar-wood pipe. Crusoe, at sight of the\r\nfootprint, did not act more swiftly than Stalky. He removed the pipes,\r\nswept up all loose match-ends, and departed to warn Beetle and McTurk.\r\n\r\nBut it was characteristic of the boy that he did not approach his allies\r\ntill he had met and conferred with little Hartopp, President of the\r\nNatural History Society, an institution which Stalky held in contempt.\r\nHartopp was more than surprised when the boy meekly, as he knew how,\r\nbegged to propose himself, Beetle, and McTurk as candidates; confessed\r\nto a long-smothered interest in first-flowerings, early butterflies, and\r\nnew arrivals, and volunteered, if Mr. Hartopp saw fit, to enter on the\r\nnew life at once. Being a master, Hartopp was suspicious; but he was\r\nalso an enthusiast, and his gentle little soul had been galled by\r\nchance-heard remarks from the three, and specially Beetle. So he was\r\ngracious to that repentant sinner, and entered the three names in his\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nThen, and not till then, did Stalky seek Beetle and McTurk in their\r\nhouse form-room. They were stowing away books for a quiet afternoon in\r\nthe furze, which they called the \xe2\x80\x9cwuzzy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, serenely. \xe2\x80\x9cI spotted Heffy\xe2\x80\x99s fairy feet round our\r\nhut after dinner. \xe2\x80\x99Blessing they\xe2\x80\x99re so big.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCon-found! Did you hide our pipes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. Left \xe2\x80\x99em in the middle of the hut, of course. What a blind ass\r\nyou are, Beetle! D\xe2\x80\x99you think nobody thinks but yourself? Well, we can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nuse the hut any more. Hoofer will be watchin\xe2\x80\x99 it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Bother! Likewise blow!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk thoughtfully, unpacking the\r\nvolumes with which his chest was cased. The boys carried their libraries\r\nbetween their belt and their collar. \xe2\x80\x9cNice job! This means we\xe2\x80\x99re under\r\nsuspicion for the rest of the term.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? All that Heffy has found is a hut. He and Foxy will watch it. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing to do with us; only we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be seen that way for a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and where else are we to go?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou chose that place,\r\ntoo--an\xe2\x80\x99--an\xe2\x80\x99 I wanted to read this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStalky sat on a desk drumming his heels on the form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a despondin\xe2\x80\x99 brute, Beetle. Sometimes I think I shall have to\r\ndrop you altogether. Did you ever know your Uncle Stalky forget you yet?\r\n_His rebus infectis_--after I\xe2\x80\x99d seen Heffy\xe2\x80\x99s man-tracks marchin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nround our hut, I found little Hartopp--_destricto ense_--wavin\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nbutterfly-net. I conciliated Hartopp. \xe2\x80\x99Told him that you\xe2\x80\x99d read papers\r\nto the Bug-hunters if he\xe2\x80\x99d let you join, Beetle. \xe2\x80\x99Told him you liked\r\nbutterflies, Turkey. Anyhow, I soothed the Hartoffles, and we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nBug-hunters now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Turkey, kick him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the interests of science bounds were largely relaxed for the members\r\nof the Natural History Society. They could wander, if they kept clear\r\nof all houses, practically where they chose; Mr. Hartopp holding himself\r\nresponsible for their good conduct.\r\n\r\nBeetle began to see this as McTurk began the kicking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an ass, Stalky!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, guarding the afflicted part. \xe2\x80\x9c_Pax_,\r\nTurkey. I\xe2\x80\x99m an ass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stop, Turkey. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t your Uncle Stalky a great man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same bug-huntin\xe2\x80\x99s a filthy business,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cHow the\r\ndeuce does one begin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, turning to some fags\xe2\x80\x99 lockers behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cFags\r\nare dabs at Natural History. Here\xe2\x80\x99s young Braybrooke\xe2\x80\x99s botany-case.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nflung out a tangle of decayed roots and adjusted the slide. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Gives one\r\nno end of a professional air, I think. Here\xe2\x80\x99s Clay Minor\xe2\x80\x99s geological\r\nhammer. Beetle can carry that. Turkey, you\xe2\x80\x99d better covet a\r\nbutterfly-net from somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m blowed if I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, simply, with immense feeling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeetle, give me the hammer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. _I_\xe2\x80\x99m not proud. Chuck us down that net on top of the\r\nlockers, Stalky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right. It\xe2\x80\x99s a collapsible jamboree, too. Beastly luxurious\r\ndogs these fags are. Built like a fishin\xe2\x80\x99-rod. \xe2\x80\x99Pon my sainted Sam,\r\nbut we look the complete Bug-hunters! Now, listen to your Uncle Stalky!\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 along the cliffs after butterflies. Very few chaps come\r\nthere. We\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to leg it, too. You\xe2\x80\x99d better leave your book behind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be done out of my fun\r\nfor a lot of filthy butterflies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll sweat horrid. You\xe2\x80\x99d better carry my Jorrocks. \xe2\x80\x99Twon\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nyou any hotter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all sweated; for Stalky led them at a smart trot west away along\r\nthe cliffs under the furze-hills, crossing combe after gorzy combe. They\r\ntook no heed to flying rabbits or fluttering fritillaries, and all that\r\nTurkey said of geology was utterly unquotable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we going to Clovelly?\xe2\x80\x9d he puffed at last, and they flung themselves\r\ndown on the short, springy turf between the drone of the sea below and\r\nthe light summer wind among the inland trees. They were looking into a\r\ncombe half full of old, high furze in gay bloom that ran up to a fringe\r\nof brambles and a dense wood of mixed timber and hollies. It was as\r\nthough one-half the combe were filled with golden fire to the cliff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nedge. The side nearest to them was open grass, and fairly bristled with\r\nnotice-boards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFee-rocious old cove, this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, reading the nearest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_Prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law_. _G. M. Dabney, Col.,\r\nJ.P._,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 all the rest of it. \xe2\x80\x99Don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to me that any chap in his\r\nsenses would trespass here, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to prove damage \xe2\x80\x99fore you can prosecute for anything! \xe2\x80\x99Can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nprosecute for trespass,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, whose father held many acres in\r\nIreland. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all rot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad of that, \xe2\x80\x99cause this looks like what we wanted. Not straight\r\nacross, Beetle, you blind lunatic! Anyone could spot us half a mile off.\r\nThis way; and furl up your beastly butterfly-net.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeetle disconnected the ring, thrust the net into a pocket, shut up\r\nthe handle to a two-foot stave, and slid the cane-ring round his waist.\r\nStalky led inland to the wood, which was, perhaps, a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom the sea, and reached the fringe of the brambles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ we can get straight down through the furze, and never show up\r\nat all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tactician. \xe2\x80\x9cBeetle, go ahead and explore. Snf! Snf!\r\nBeastly stink of fox somewhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn all fours, save when he clung to his spectacles, Beetle wormed into\r\nthe gorse, and presently announced between grunts of pain that he had\r\nfound a very fair fox-track. This was well for Beetle, since Stalky\r\npinched him _a tergo_. Down that tunnel they crawled. It was evidently\r\na highway for the inhabitants of the combe; and, to their inexpressible\r\njoy, ended, at the very edge of the cliff, in a few square feet of dry\r\nturf walled and roofed with impenetrable gorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy gum! There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a single thing to do except lie down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky,\r\nreturning a knife to his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe parted the tough stems before him, and it was as a window opened on\r\na far view of Lundy, and the deep sea sluggishly nosing the pebbles a\r\ncouple of hundred feet below. They could hear young jackdaws squawking\r\non the ledges, the hiss and jabber of a nest of hawks somewhere out of\r\nsight; and, with great deliberation, Stalky spat on to the back of a\r\nyoung rabbit sunning himself far down where only a cliff-rabbit could\r\nhave found foot-hold. Great gray and black gulls screamed against the\r\njackdaws; the heavy-scented acres of bloom round them were alive with\r\nlow-nesting birds, singing or silent as the shadow of the wheeling hawks\r\npassed and returned; and on the naked turf across the combe rabbits\r\nthumped and frolicked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew! What a place! Talk of natural history; this is it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky,\r\nfilling himself a pipe. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it scrumptious? Good old sea!\xe2\x80\x9d He spat\r\nagain approvingly, and was silent.\r\n\r\nMcTurk and Beetle had taken out their books and were lying on their\r\nstomachs, chin in hand. The sea snored and gurgled; the birds, scattered\r\nfor the moment by these new animals, returned to their businesses, and\r\nthe boys read on in the rich, warm, sleepy silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, here\xe2\x80\x99s a keeper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, shutting \xe2\x80\x9cHandley Cross\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncautiously, and peering through the jungle. A man with a gun appeared\r\non the sky-line to the east. \xe2\x80\x9cConfound him, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d swear we were poachin\xe2\x80\x99, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of\r\npheasants\xe2\x80\x99 eggs? They\xe2\x80\x99re always addled, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight as well get up to the wood, _I_ think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant G. M. Dabney, Col., J.P., to be bothered about us so soon. Up the\r\nwuzzy and keep quiet! He may have followed us, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeetle was already far up the tunnel. They heard him gasp indescribably:\r\nthere was the crash of a heavy body leaping through the furze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAie! yeou little red rascal. I see yeou!\xe2\x80\x9d The keeper threw the gun to\r\nhis shoulder, and fired both barrels in their direction. The pellets\r\ndusted the dry stems round them as a big fox plunged between Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlegs, and ran over the cliff-edge.\r\n\r\nThey said nothing till they reached the wood, torn, disheveled, hot, but\r\nunseen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNarrow squeak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll swear some of the pellets went\r\nthrough my hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cI almost put my hand on him. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe a wopper! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he stink! Hullo, Turkey, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? Are you\r\nhit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMcTurk\xe2\x80\x99s lean face had turned pearly white; his mouth, generally half\r\nopen, was tight shut, and his eyes blazed. They had never seen him like\r\nthis save once in a sad time of civil war.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that that was just as bad as murder?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a grating\r\nvoice, as he brushed prickles from his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it was rather a lark.\r\nHere, where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going up to the house, if there is one,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, pushing\r\nthrough the hollies. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to tell this Colonel Dabney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you crazy? He\xe2\x80\x99ll swear it served us jolly well right. He\xe2\x80\x99ll report\r\nus. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a public lickin\xe2\x80\x99. Oh, Turkey, don\xe2\x80\x99t be an ass! Think of\r\nus!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, turning savagely. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m thinkin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nof _us_? It\xe2\x80\x99s the keeper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s cracked,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, miserably, as they followed. Indeed, this\r\nwas a new Turkey--a haughty, angular, nose-lifted Turkey--whom they\r\naccompanied through a shrubbery on to a lawn, where a white-whiskered\r\nold gentleman with a cleek was alternately putting and blaspheming\r\nvigorously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you Colonel Dabney?\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk began in this new creaking voice of\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I am, and--\xe2\x80\x9d his eyes traveled up and down the boy--\xe2\x80\x9cwho--what the\r\ndevil d\xe2\x80\x99you want? Ye\xe2\x80\x99ve been disturbing my pheasants. Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to\r\ndeny it. Ye needn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at it.\xe2\x80\x9d (McTurk\xe2\x80\x99s not too lovely features had\r\ntwisted themselves into a horrible sneer at the word pheasant.) \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen birds\xe2\x80\x99-nesting. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t hide your hat. I can see that you\r\nbelong to the College. Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to deny it. Ye do! Your name\r\nand number at once, sir. Ye want to speak to me--Eh? You saw my\r\nnotice-boards? Must have. Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to deny it. Ye did! Damnable, oh\r\ndamnable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe choked with emotion. McTurk\xe2\x80\x99s heel tapped the lawn and he stuttered a\r\nlittle--two sure signs that he was losing his temper. But why should he,\r\nthe offender, be angry?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLo-look here, sir. Do--do you shoot foxes? Because, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, your\r\nkeeper does. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him! I do-don\xe2\x80\x99t care what you call us--but it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan awful thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s the ruin of good feelin\xe2\x80\x99 among neighbors. A ma-man\r\nought to say once and for all how he stands about preservin\xe2\x80\x99. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworse than murder, because there\xe2\x80\x99s no legal remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk was quoting\r\nconfusedly from his father, while the old gentleman made noises in his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d he gurgled at last; Stalky and Beetle quaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sorr, nor do I care if ye belonged to the Castle itself. Answer me\r\nnow, as one gentleman to another. Do ye shoot foxes or do ye not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd four years before Stalky and Beetle had carefully kicked McTurk out\r\nof his Irish dialect! Assuredly he had gone mad or taken a sunstroke,\r\nand as assuredly he would be slain--once by the old gentleman and once\r\nby the Head. A public licking for the three was the least they could\r\nexpect. Yet--if their eyes and ears were to be trusted--the old\r\ngentleman had collapsed. It might be a lull before the storm, but--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not.\xe2\x80\x9d He was still gurgling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must sack your keeper. He\xe2\x80\x99s not fit to live in the same county\r\nwith a God-fearin\xe2\x80\x99 fox. An\xe2\x80\x99 a vixen, too--at this time o\xe2\x80\x99 year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid ye come up on purpose to tell me this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I did, ye silly man,\xe2\x80\x9d with a stamp of the foot. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you\r\nnot have done as much for me if you\xe2\x80\x99d seen that thing happen on my land,\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nForgotten--forgotten was the College and the decency due to elders!\r\nMcTurk was treading again the barren purple mountains of the rainy\r\nWest coast, where in his holidays he was viceroy of four thousand naked\r\nacres, only son of a three-hundred-year-old house, lord of a crazy\r\nfishing-boat, and the idol of his father\xe2\x80\x99s shiftless tenantry. It was\r\nthe landed man speaking to his equal--deep calling to deep--and the old\r\ngentleman acknowledged the cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI apologize,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI apologize unreservedly--to you, and to the\r\nOld Country. Now, will you be good enough to tell me your story?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were in your combe,\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk began, and he told his tale alternately\r\nas a schoolboy and, when the iniquity of the thing overcame him, as an\r\nindignant squire; concluding: \xe2\x80\x9cSo you see he must be in the habit of\r\nit. I--we---one never wants to accuse a neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s man; but I took the\r\nliberty in this case--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. Quite so. For a reason ye had. Infamous---oh, infamous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two had fallen into step beside each other on the lawn, and Colonel\r\nDabney was talking as one man to another. \xe2\x80\x9cThis comes of promoting a\r\nfisherman--a fisherman--from his lobster-pots. It\xe2\x80\x99s enough to ruin the\r\nreputation of an archangel. Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to deny it. It is! Your father\r\nhas brought you up well. He has. I\xe2\x80\x99d much like the pleasure of his\r\nacquaintance. Very much, indeed. And these young gentlemen? English\r\nthey are. Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to deny it. They came up with you, too?\r\nExtraordinary! Extraordinary, now! In the present state of education I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought any three boys would be well enough grounded.\r\nBut out of the mouths of--No--no! Not that by any odds. Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to\r\ndeny it. Ye\xe2\x80\x99re not! Sherry always catches me under the liver, but--beer,\r\nnow? Eh? What d\xe2\x80\x99you say to beer, and something to eat? It\xe2\x80\x99s long since\r\nI was a boy--abominable nuisances; but exceptions prove the rule. And a\r\nvixen, too!\xe2\x80\x9d They were fed on the terrace by a gray-haired housekeeper.\r\nStalky and Beetle merely ate, but McTurk with bright eyes continued a\r\nfree and lofty discourse; and ever the old gentleman treated him as a\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear man, of _course_ ye can come again. Did I not say exceptions\r\nprove the rule? The lower combe? Man, dear, anywhere ye please, so long\r\nas you do not disturb my pheasants. The two are not incompatible. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nattempt to deny it. They\xe2\x80\x99re not! I\xe2\x80\x99ll never allow another gun, though.\r\nCome and go as ye please. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not see you, and ye needn\xe2\x80\x99t see me. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen well brought up. Another glass of beer, now? I tell you a fisherman\r\nhe was and a fisherman he shall be to-night again. He shall! Wish\r\nI could drown him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll convoy you to the Lodge. My people are not\r\nprecisely--ah--broke to boy, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll know you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dismissed them with many compliments by the high Lodge-gate in the\r\nsplit-oak park palings and they stood still; even Stalky, who had played\r\nsecond, not to say a dumb, fiddle, regarding McTurk as one from another\r\nworld. The two glasses of strong home-brewed had brought a melancholy\r\nupon the boy, for, slowly strolling with his hands in his pockets, he\r\ncrooned:--\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Paddy dear, and did ye hear the news that\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 round?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnder other circumstances Stalky and Beetle would have fallen upon him,\r\nfor that song was barred utterly--anathema--the sin of witchcraft. But\r\nseeing what he had wrought, they danced round him in silence, waiting\r\ntill it pleased him to touch earth.\r\n\r\nThe tea-bell rang when they were still half a mile from College. McTurk\r\nshivered and came out of dreams. The glory of his holiday estate had\r\nleft him. He was a Colleger of the College, speaking English once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurkey, it was immense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, generously. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you\r\nhad it in you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got us a hut for the rest of the term, where\r\nwe simply _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ be collared. Fids! Fids! Oh, Fids! I gloat! Hear me\r\ngloat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey spun wildly on their heels, jodeling after the accepted manner of\r\na \xe2\x80\x9cgloat,\xe2\x80\x9d which is not unremotely allied to the primitive man\xe2\x80\x99s song of\r\ntriumph, and dropped down the hill by the path from the gasometer just\r\nin time to meet their house-master, who had spent the afternoon watching\r\ntheir abandoned hut in the \xe2\x80\x9cwuzzy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnluckily, all Mr. Prout\xe2\x80\x99s imagination leaned to the darker side of\r\nlife, and he looked on those young-eyed cherubims most sourly. Boys that\r\nhe understood attended house-matches and could be accounted for at\r\nany moment. But he had heard McTurk openly deride cricket--even\r\nhouse-matches; Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s views on the honor of the house he knew were\r\nincendiary; and he could never tell when the soft and smiling Stalky was\r\nlaughing at him. Consequently--since human nature is what it is--those\r\nboys had been doing wrong somewhere. He hoped it was nothing very\r\nserious, but...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ti-ra-ra-la-i-tu_! I gloat! Hear me!\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky, still on his heels,\r\nwhirled like a dancing dervish to the dining-hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu_! I gloat! Hear me!\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle spun behind him with\r\noutstretched arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu_! I gloat! Hear me!\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk\xe2\x80\x99s voice cracked.\r\n\r\nNow was there or was there not a distinct flavor of beer as they shot\r\npast Mr. Prout?\r\n\r\nHe was unlucky in that his conscience as a house-master impelled him to\r\nconsult his associates. Had he taken his pipe and his troubles to\r\nlittle Hartopp\xe2\x80\x99s rooms he would, perhaps, have been saved confusion, for\r\nHartopp believed in boys, and knew something about them. His fate led\r\nhim to King, a fellow house-master, no friend of his, but a zealous\r\nhater of Stalky & Co.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh-haa!\xe2\x80\x9d said King, rubbing his hands when the tale was told. \xe2\x80\x9cCurious!\r\nNow _my_ house never dream of doing these things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you see I\xe2\x80\x99ve no proof, exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProof? With the egregious Beetle! As if one wanted it! I suppose it\r\nis not impossible for the Sergeant to supply it? Foxy is considered\r\nat least a match for any evasive boy in my house. Of course they were\r\nsmoking and drinking somewhere. That type of boy always does. They think\r\nit manly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99ve no following in the school, and they are\r\ndistinctly--er--brutal to their juniors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout, who had from a\r\ndistance seen Beetle return, with interest, his butterfly-net to a\r\ntearful fag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! They consider themselves superior to ordinary delights.\r\nSelf-sufficient little animals! There\xe2\x80\x99s something in McTurk\xe2\x80\x99s Hibernian\r\nsneer that would make _me_ a little annoyed. And they are so careful\r\nto avoid all overt acts, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s sheer calculated insolence. I am\r\nstrongly opposed, as you know, to interfering with another man\xe2\x80\x99s house;\r\nbut they need a lesson, Prout. They need a sharp lesson, if only to\r\nbring down their over-weening self-conceit. Were I you, I should devote\r\nmyself for a week to their little performances. Boys of that order--and\r\nI may flatter myself, but I think I know boys--don\xe2\x80\x99t join the\r\nBug-hunters for love. Tell the Sergeant to keep his eye open; and, of\r\ncourse, in my peregrinations I may casually keep mine open, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu_! I gloat! Hear me!\xe2\x80\x9d far down the corridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDisgusting!\xe2\x80\x9d said King. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do they pick up these obscene noises?\r\nOne sharp lesson is what they want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys did not concern themselves with lessons for the next few days.\r\nThey had all Colonel Dabney\xe2\x80\x99s estate to play with, and they explored it\r\nwith the stealth of Red Indians and the accuracy of burglars. They could\r\nenter either by the Lodge-gates on the upper road--they were careful to\r\ningratiate themselves with the Lodge-keeper and his wife--drop down into\r\nthe combe, and return along the cliffs; or they could begin at the combe\r\nand climb up into the road.\r\n\r\nThey were careful not to cross the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s path--he had served his\r\nturn, and they would not out-wear their welcome--nor did they show up on\r\nthe sky-line when they could move in cover. The shelter of the gorze\r\nby the cliff-edge was their chosen retreat. Beetle christened it the\r\nPleasant Isle of Aves, for the peace and the shelter of it; and here,\r\nthe pipes and tobacco once cach\xc3\xa9d in a convenient ledge an arm\xe2\x80\x99s length\r\ndown the cliff, their position was legally unassailable.\r\n\r\nFor, observe, Colonel Dabney had not invited them to enter his house.\r\nTherefore, they did not need to ask specific leave to go visiting; and\r\nschool rules were strict on that point. He had merely thrown open his\r\ngrounds to them; and, since they were lawful Bug-hunters, their extended\r\nbounds ran up to his notice-boards in the combe and his Lodge-gates on\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\nThey were amazed at their own virtue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, flat on his back, staring into the\r\nblue. \xe2\x80\x9cEven suppose we were miles out of bounds, no one could get at us\r\nthrough this wuzzy, unless he knew the tunnel. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this better than\r\nlyin\xe2\x80\x99 up just behind the Coll.--in a blue funk every time we had a\r\nsmoke? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t your Uncle Stalky--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle--he was stretched at the edge of the cliff spitting\r\nthoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to thank Turkey for this. Turkey is the Great\r\nMan. Turkey, dear, you\xe2\x80\x99re distressing Heffles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGloomy old ass!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, deep in a book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got us under suspicion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cHoophats _is_ so\r\nsuspicious somehow; and Foxy always makes every stalk he does a sort\r\nof--sort of--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScalp,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cFoxy\xe2\x80\x99s a giddy Chingangook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Foxy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to catch us one of these days.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Said to me in the Gym last night, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my eye on you, Mister\r\nCorkran. I\xe2\x80\x99m only warning you for your good.\xe2\x80\x99 Then I said: \xe2\x80\x98Well, you\r\njolly well take it off again, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll get into trouble. I\xe2\x80\x99m only\r\nwarnin\xe2\x80\x99 you for your good.\xe2\x80\x99 Foxy was wrath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s only fair sport for Foxy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Hefflelinga\r\nthat has the evil mind. \xe2\x80\x99Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if he thought we got tight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never got squiffy but once--that was in the holidays,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky,\r\nreflectively; \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 it made me horrid sick. \xe2\x80\x99Pon my sacred Sam, though,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s enough to drive a man to drink, havin\xe2\x80\x99 an animal like Hoof for\r\nhouse-master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we attended the matches an\xe2\x80\x99 yelled, \xe2\x80\x98Well hit, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 stood on\r\none leg an\xe2\x80\x99 grinned every time Heffy said, \xe2\x80\x98So ho, my sons. Is it thus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98O, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Please, sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlike a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 filthy fa-ags, Heffy \xe2\x80\x99ud think no end of us,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk\r\nwith a sneer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late to begin that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right. The Hefflelinga means well. _But_ he is an ass. _And_\r\nwe show him that we think he\xe2\x80\x99s an ass. An\xe2\x80\x99 _so_ Heffy don\xe2\x80\x99t love us.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Told me last night after prayers that he was _in loco parentis_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Beetle grunted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce he did!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means he\xe2\x80\x99s maturin\xe2\x80\x99 something\r\nunusual dam\xe2\x80\x99 mean. Last time he told me that he gave me three hundred\r\nlines for dancin\xe2\x80\x99 the cachuca in Number Ten dormitory. _Loco parentis_,\r\nby gum! But what\xe2\x80\x99s the odds as long as you\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x99appy? _We\xe2\x80\x99re_ all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were, and their very rightness puzzled Prout, King, and the\r\nSergeant. Boys with bad consciences show it. They slink out past the\r\nFives Court in haste, and smile nervously when questioned. They return,\r\ndisordered, in bare time to save a call-over. They nod and wink and\r\ngiggle one to the other, scattering at the approach of a master. But\r\nStalky and his allies had long out-lived these manifestations of youth.\r\nThey strolled forth unconcernedly, and returned in excellent shape after\r\na light refreshment of strawberries and cream at the Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe Lodge-keeper had been promoted to keeper, _vice_ the murderous\r\nfisherman, and his wife made much of the boys. The man, too, gave them\r\na squirrel, which they presented to the Natural History Society; thereby\r\ncheckmating little Hartopp, who wished to know what they were doing for\r\nScience. Foxy faithfully worked some deep Devon lanes behind a lonely\r\ncross-roads inn; and it was curious that Prout and King, members of\r\nCommon-room seldom friendly, walked together in the same direction--that\r\nis to say, northeast.\r\n\r\nNow, the Pleasant Isle of Aves lay due southwest. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndeep--day-vilish deep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are they drawin\xe2\x80\x99 those\r\ncovers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle sweetly. \xe2\x80\x9cI asked Foxy if he had ever tasted the beer\r\nthere. That was enough for Foxy, and it cheered him up a little. He and\r\nHeffy were sniffin\xe2\x80\x99 round our old hut so long I thought they\xe2\x80\x99d like a\r\nchange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it can\xe2\x80\x99t last forever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cHeffy\xe2\x80\x99s bankin\xe2\x80\x99 up like\r\na thunder-cloud, an\xe2\x80\x99 King goes rubbin\xe2\x80\x99 his beastly hands, an\xe2\x80\x99 grinnin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlike a hyena. It\xe2\x80\x99s shockin\xe2\x80\x99 demoralizin\xe2\x80\x99 for King. He\xe2\x80\x99ll burst some\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat day came a little sooner than they expected--came when the\r\nSergeant, whose duty it was to collect defaulters, did not attend an\r\nafternoon call-over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTired of pubs, eh? He\xe2\x80\x99s gone up to the top of the bill with his\r\nbinoculars to spot us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cWonder he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of that\r\nbefore. Did you see old Heffy cock his eye at us when we answered our\r\nnames? Heffy\xe2\x80\x99s in it, too. _Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu_! I gloat! Hear me! Come\r\non!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAves?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not smokin\xe2\x80\x99 _aujourd\xe2\x80\x99hui_. _Parceque je_ jolly well\r\n_pense_ that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be _suivi_. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go along the cliffs, slow, an\xe2\x80\x99 give\r\nFoxy lots of time to parallel us up above.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey strolled towards the swimming-baths, and presently overtook King.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t let _me_ interrupt you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEngaged in scientific\r\npursuits, of course? I trust you will enjoy yourselves, my young\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, when they were out of earshot. \xe2\x80\x9cHe _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ keep\r\na secret. He\xe2\x80\x99s followin\xe2\x80\x99 to cut off our line of retreat. He\xe2\x80\x99ll wait\r\nat the baths till Heffy comes along. They\xe2\x80\x99ve tried every blessed place\r\nexcept along the cliffs, and now they think they\xe2\x80\x99ve bottled us. No need\r\nto hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked leisurely over the combes till they reached the line of\r\nnotice-boards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen a shake. Foxy\xe2\x80\x99s up wind comin\xe2\x80\x99 down hill like beans. When you\r\nhear him move in the bushes, go straight across to Aves. They want to\r\ncatch us _flagrante delicto_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey dived into the gorse at right angles to the tunnel, openly crossing\r\nthe grass, and lay still in Aves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky carefully put away the pipes and tobacco.\r\nThe Sergeant, out of breath, was leaning against the fence, raking\r\nthe furze with his binoculars, but he might as well have tried to see\r\nthrough a sand-bag. Anon, Prout and King appeared behind him. They\r\nconferred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! Foxy don\xe2\x80\x99t like the notice-boards, and he don\xe2\x80\x99t like the prickles\r\neither. Now we\xe2\x80\x99ll cut up the tunnel and go to the Lodge. Hullo! They\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nsent Foxy into cover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant was waist-deep in crackling, swaying furze, his ears filled\r\nwith the noise of his own progress. The boys reached the shelter of the\r\nwood and looked down through a belt of hollies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHellish noise!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, critically. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Don\xe2\x80\x99t think Colonel Dabney\r\nwill like it. I move we go into the Lodge and get something to eat. We\r\nmight as well see the fun out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly the keeper passed them at a trot. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99m they to combe-bottom\r\nfor Lard\xe2\x80\x99s sake? Master\xe2\x80\x99ll be crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoachers simly,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky replied in the broad Devon that was the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_langue de guerre_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll poach \xe2\x80\x99em to raights!\xe2\x80\x9d He dropped into the funnel-like combe,\r\nwhich presently began to fill with noises, notably King\xe2\x80\x99s voice crying:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Sergeant! Leave him alone, you, sir. He is executing my orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99m yeou to give arders here, gingy whiskers? Yeou come up to the\r\nmaster. Come out o\xe2\x80\x99 that wuzzy! [This is to the Sergeant.] Yiss, I\r\nreckon us knows the boys yeou\xe2\x80\x99m after. They\xe2\x80\x99ve tu long ears an\xe2\x80\x99 vuzzy\r\nbellies, an\xe2\x80\x99 you nippies they in yeour pockets when they\xe2\x80\x99m dead. Come on\r\nup to master! He\xe2\x80\x99ll boy yeou all you\xe2\x80\x99re a mind to. Yeou other folk bide\r\nyour side fence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain to the proprietor. You can explain, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted King.\r\nEvidently the Sergeant had surrendered to the major force.\r\n\r\nBeetle lay at full length on the turf behind the Lodge, literally biting\r\nthe earth in spasms of joy. Stalky kicked him upright. There was nothing\r\nof levity about Stalky or McTurk save a stray muscle twitching on the\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nThey tapped at the Lodge door, where they were always welcome. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nyeou right in an\xe2\x80\x99 set down, my little dearrs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nniver touch my man. He\xe2\x80\x99ll poach \xe2\x80\x99em to rights. Iss fai! Fresh berries\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 cream. Us Dartymoor folk niver forgit their friends. But them\r\nBidevor poachers, they\xe2\x80\x99ve no hem to their garments. Sugar? My man he\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndigged a badger for yeou, my dearrs. \xe2\x80\x99Tis in the linhay in a box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUs\xe2\x80\x99ll take un with us when we\xe2\x80\x99re finished here. I reckon yeou\xe2\x80\x99m busy.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll bide here an\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x99tis washin\xe2\x80\x99 day with yeou, simly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99m no company to make all vitty for. Never yeou mind us. Yiss.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty cream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman withdrew, wiping her pink hands on her apron, and left them\r\nin the parlor. There was a scuffle of feet on the gravel outside the\r\nheavily-leaded diamond panes, and then the voice of Colonel Dabney,\r\nsomething clearer than a bugle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe can read? You\xe2\x80\x99ve eyes in your head? Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to deny it. Ye\r\nhave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeetle snatched a crochet-work antimacassar from the shiny horsehair\r\nsofa, stuffed it into his mouth, and rolled out of sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw my notice-boards. Your duty? Curse your impudence, sir. Your\r\nduty was to keep off my grounds. Talk of duty to _me_! Why--why--why, ye\r\nmisbegotten poacher, ye\xe2\x80\x99ll be teaching me my A B C next! Roarin\xe2\x80\x99 like a\r\nbull in the bushes down there! Boys? Boys? Boys? Keep your boys at home,\r\nthen! I\xe2\x80\x99m not responsible for your boys! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it--I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe a word of it. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ve a furtive look in your eye--a furtive,\r\nsneakin\xe2\x80\x99, poachin\xe2\x80\x99 look in your eye, that \xe2\x80\x99ud ruin the reputation of an\r\narchangel! Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to deny it! Ye have! A sergeant? More shame to\r\nyou, then, an\xe2\x80\x99 the worst bargain Her Majesty ever made! A sergeant, to\r\nrun about the country poachin\xe2\x80\x99--on your pension! Damnable! Oh, damnable!\r\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll be considerate. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be merciful. By gad, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the very\r\nessence o\xe2\x80\x99 humanity! Did ye, or did ye not, see my notice-boards? Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nattempt to deny it! Ye did. Silence, Sergeant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwenty-one years in the army had left their mark on Foxy. He obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow. March!\xe2\x80\x9d The high Lodge gate shut with a clang. \xe2\x80\x9cMy duty! A\r\nsergeant to tell me my duty!\xe2\x80\x9d puffed Colonel Dabney. \xe2\x80\x9cGood Lard! more\r\nsergeants!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s King! It\xe2\x80\x99s King!\xe2\x80\x9d gulped Stalky, his head on the horsehair pillow.\r\nMcTurk was eating the rag-carpet before the speckless hearth, and the\r\nsofa heaved to the emotions of Beetle. Through the thick glass the\r\nfigures without showed blue, distorted, and menacing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I protest against this outrage.\xe2\x80\x9d King had evidently been running\r\nup hill. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man was entirely within his duty. Let--let me give you my\r\ncard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in flannels!\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky buried his head again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately--_most_ unfortunately--I have not one with me, but my\r\nname is King, sir, a house-master of the College, and you will find me\r\nprepared--fully prepared--to answer for this man\xe2\x80\x99s action. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nthree--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Did_ ye see my notice-boards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admit we did; but under the circumstances--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stand _in loco parentis_.\xe2\x80\x9d Prout\xe2\x80\x99s deep voice was added to the\r\ndiscussion. They could hear him pant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cF\xe2\x80\x99what?\xe2\x80\x9d Colonel Dabney was growing more and more Irish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m responsible for the boys under my charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are, are ye? Then all I can say is that ye set them a very bad\r\nexample--a dam\xe2\x80\x99 bad example, if I may say so. I do not own your boys.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen your boys, an\xe2\x80\x99 I tell you that if there was a boy grinnin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nin every bush on the place, _still_ ye\xe2\x80\x99ve no shadow of a right here,\r\ncomin\xe2\x80\x99 up from the combe that way, an\xe2\x80\x99 frightenin\xe2\x80\x99 everything in it.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to deny it. Ye did. Ye should have come to the Lodge an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nseen me like Christians, instead of chasin\xe2\x80\x99 your dam\xe2\x80\x99 boys through the\r\nlength and breadth of my covers. _In loco parentis_ ye are? Well,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve not forgotten my Latin either, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say to you:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Quis custodiet ipsos custodes_.\xe2\x80\x99 If the masters trespass, how can we\r\nblame the boys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I could speak to you privately,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have nothing private with you! Ye can be as private as ye please\r\non the other side o\xe2\x80\x99 that gate an\xe2\x80\x99--I wish ye a very good afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA second time the gate clanged. They waited till Colonel Dabney had\r\nreturned to the house, and fell into one another\xe2\x80\x99s arms, crowing for\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my Soul! Oh, my King! Oh, my Heffy! Oh, my Foxy! Zeal, all zeal,\r\nMr. Simple.\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky wiped his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Oh! Oh!--\xe2\x80\x98I _did_ boil the\r\nexciseman!\xe2\x80\x99 We must get out of this or we\xe2\x80\x99ll be late for tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGe--Ge--get the badger and make little Hartopp happy. Ma--ma--make\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em all happy,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed McTurk, groping for the door and kicking the\r\nprostrate Beetle before him.\r\n\r\nThey found the beast in an evil-smelling box, left two half-crowns for\r\npayment, and staggered home. Only the badger grunted most marvelous like\r\nColonel Dabney, and they dropped him twice or thrice with shrieks of\r\nhelpless laughter. They were but imperfectly recovered when Foxy met\r\nthem by the Fives Court with word that they were to go up to their\r\ndormitory and wait till sent for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, take this box to Mr. Hartopp\xe2\x80\x99s rooms, then. We\xe2\x80\x99ve done something\r\nfor the Natural History Society, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Fraid that won\xe2\x80\x99t save you, young gen\xe2\x80\x99elmen,\xe2\x80\x9d Foxy answered, in an\r\nawful voice. He was sorely ruffled in his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll sereno, Foxibus.\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky had reached the extreme stage of hiccups.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe--we\xe2\x80\x99ll never desert you, Foxy. Hounds choppin\xe2\x80\x99 foxes in cover is\r\nmore a proof of vice, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?... No, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99m--I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve gone a bit too far this time,\xe2\x80\x9d Foxy thought to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\nfar gone, _I\xe2\x80\x99d_ say, excep\xe2\x80\x99 there was no smell of liquor. An\xe2\x80\x99 yet it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t like \xe2\x80\x99em--somehow. King and Prout they \xe2\x80\x99ad their dressin\xe2\x80\x99-down\r\nsame as me. That\xe2\x80\x99s one comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, we must pull up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, rising from the bed on which he had\r\nthrown himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re injured innocence--as usual. _We_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve been sent up here for, do we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo explanation. Deprived of tea. Public disgrace before the house,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said McTurk, whose eyes were running over. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s dam\xe2\x80\x99 serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, hold on, till King loses his temper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlibelous old rip, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a ravin\xe2\x80\x99 paddy-wack. Prout\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nbeastly cautious. Keep your eye on King, and, if he gives us a chance,\r\nappeal to the Head. That always makes \xe2\x80\x99em sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were summoned to their house-master\xe2\x80\x99s study, King and Foxy\r\nsupporting Prout, and Foxy had three canes under his arm. King leered\r\ntriumphantly, for there were tears, undried tears of mirth, on the boys\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncheeks. Then the examination began.\r\n\r\nYes, they had walked along the cliffs. Yes, they had entered Colonel\r\nDabney\xe2\x80\x99s grounds. Yes, they had seen the notice-boards (at this point\r\nBeetle sputtered hysterically). For what purpose had they entered\r\nColonel Dabney\xe2\x80\x99s grounds? \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, there was a badger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere King, who loathed the Natural History Society because he did not\r\nlike Hartopp, could no longer be restrained. He begged them not to add\r\nmendacity to open insolence. But the badger was in Mr. Hartopp\xe2\x80\x99s rooms,\r\nsir. The Sergeant had kindly taken it up for them. That disposed of the\r\nbadger, and the temporary check brought King\xe2\x80\x99s temper to boiling-point.\r\nThey could hear his foot on the floor while Prout prepared his lumbering\r\ninquiries. They had settled into their stride now. Their eyes ceased to\r\nsparkle; their faces were blank; their hands hung beside them without a\r\ntwitch. They were learning, at the expense of a fellow-countryman, the\r\nlesson of their race, which is to put away all emotion and entrap the\r\nalien at the proper time.\r\n\r\nSo far good. King was importing himself more freely into the trial,\r\nbeing vengeful where Prout was grieved. They knew the penalties of\r\ntrespassing? With a fine show of irresolution, Stalky admitted that\r\nhe had gathered some information vaguely bearing on this head, but he\r\nthought--The sentence was dragged out to the uttermost: Stalky did not\r\nwish to play his trump with such an opponent. Mr. King desired no buts,\r\nnor was he interested in Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s evasions. They, on the other hand,\r\nmight be interested in his poor views. Boys who crept--who sneaked--who\r\nlurked--out of bounds, even the generous bounds of the Natural\r\nHistory Society, which they had falsely joined as a cloak for their\r\nmisdeeds--their vices--their villainies--their immoralities--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll break cover in a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll run\r\ninto him before he gets away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch boys, scabrous boys, moral lepers--the current of his words was\r\ncarrying King off his feet--evil-speakers, liars, slow-bellies--yea,\r\nincipient drunkards...\r\n\r\nHe was merely working up to a peroration, and the boys knew it; but\r\nMcTurk cut through the frothing sentence, the others echoing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI appeal to the Head, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI appeal to the head, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI appeal to the Head, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was their unquestioned right. Drunkenness meant expulsion after a\r\npublic flogging. They had been accused of it. The case was the Head\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand the Head\xe2\x80\x99s alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast appealed unto Caesar: unto Caesar shalt thou go.\xe2\x80\x9d They had\r\nheard that sentence once or twice before in their careers. \xe2\x80\x9cNone the\r\nless,\xe2\x80\x9d said King, uneasily, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would be better advised to abide by our\r\ndecision, my young friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we allowed to associate with the rest of the school till we see the\r\nHead, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk to his house-master, disregarding King. This at\r\nonce lifted the situation to its loftiest plane. Moreover, it meant no\r\nwork, for moral leprosy was strictly quarantined, and the Head never\r\nexecuted judgment till twenty-four cold hours later.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--er--if you persist in your defiant attitude,\xe2\x80\x9d said King, with a\r\nloving look at the canes under Foxy\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no alternative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the news was over the whole school. Stalky and Co.\r\nhad fallen at last--fallen by drink. They had been drinking. They had\r\nreturned blind-drunk from a hut. They were even now lying hopelessly\r\nintoxicated on the dormitory floor. A few bold spirits crept up to look,\r\nand received boots about the head from the criminals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got him--got him on the Caudine Toasting-fork!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky,\r\nafter those hints were taken. \xe2\x80\x9cKing\xe2\x80\x99ll have to prove his charges up to\r\nthe giddy hilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much ticklee, him bust,\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle quoted from a book of his reading.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I say he\xe2\x80\x99d go pop if we lat un bide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo prep., either, O ye incipient drunkards,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrig night, too. Hullo! Here\xe2\x80\x99s our dear friend Foxy. More tortures,\r\nFoxibus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve brought you something to eat, young gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant\r\nfrom behind a crowded tray. Their wars had ever been waged without\r\nmalice, and a suspicion floated in Foxy\xe2\x80\x99s mind that boys who allowed\r\nthemselves to be tracked so easily might, perhaps, hold something in\r\nreserve. Foxy had served through the Mutiny, when early and accurate\r\ninformation was worth much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I noticed you \xe2\x80\x99adn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ad anything to eat, an\xe2\x80\x99 I spoke to Gumbly, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said you wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly cut off from supplies. So I brought up this.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s your potted \xe2\x80\x99am tin, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, Mr. Corkran?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Foxibus, you\xe2\x80\x99re a brick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you had\r\nthis much--what\xe2\x80\x99s the word, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBowels,\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle replied, promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Sergeant. That\xe2\x80\x99s young\r\nCarter\xe2\x80\x99s potted ham, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a C on it. I thought it was Mr. Corkran\xe2\x80\x99s. This is a very\r\nserious business, young gentlemen. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\r\nperhaps, but there might be something on your side which you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said\r\nto Mr. King or Mr. Prout, maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is. Heaps, Foxibus.\xe2\x80\x9d This from Stalky through a full mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you see, if that was the case, it seemed to me I might represent\r\nit, quiet so to say, to the \xe2\x80\x99Ead when he asks me about it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\ntake \xe2\x80\x99im the charges to-night, an\xe2\x80\x99--it looks bad on the face of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Trocious bad, Foxy. Twenty-seven cuts in the Gym before all the\r\nschool, and public expulsion. \xe2\x80\x98Wine is a mocker, strong drink is\r\nragin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to make fun of, young gentlemen. I \xe2\x80\x99ave to go to the \xe2\x80\x99Ead\r\nwith the charges. An\xe2\x80\x99--an\xe2\x80\x99 you mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be aware, per\xe2\x80\x99aps, that I was\r\nfollowin\xe2\x80\x99 you this afternoon; havin\xe2\x80\x99 my suspicions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid ye see the notice-boards?\xe2\x80\x9d croaked McTurk, in the very brogue of\r\nColonel Dabney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99ve eyes in your head. Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to deny it. Ye did!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBeetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sergeant! To run about poachin\xe2\x80\x99 on your pension! Damnable, O\r\ndamnable!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, without pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, sitting heavily upon a bed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere--where the devil _was_ you? I might ha\xe2\x80\x99 known it was a\r\ndo--somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you clever maniac!\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be aware you were\r\nfollowin\xe2\x80\x99 us this afternoon, mayn\xe2\x80\x99t we? \xe2\x80\x99Thought you were stalkin\xe2\x80\x99 us,\r\neh? Why, we led you bung into it, of course. Colonel Dabney--don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou think he\xe2\x80\x99s a nice man, Foxy?--Colonel Dabney\xe2\x80\x99s our pet particular\r\nfriend. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been goin\xe2\x80\x99 there for weeks and weeks, he invited us.\r\nYou and your duty! Curse your duty, sir! Your duty was to keep off his\r\ncovers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll never be able to hold up your head again, Foxy. The fags\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhoot at you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of your giddy prestige!\xe2\x80\x9d The Sergeant was thinking--hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook \xe2\x80\x99ere, young gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou aren\xe2\x80\x99t surely\r\never goin\xe2\x80\x99 to tell, are you? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Prout and Mr. King in--in it\r\ntoo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoxibusculus, they _was_. They was--singular horrid. Caught it worse\r\nthan you. We heard every word of it. You got off easy, considerin\xe2\x80\x99. If\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d been Dabney I swear I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 quodded you. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll suggest it to\r\nhim to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s all goin\xe2\x80\x99 up to the \xe2\x80\x99Ead. Oh, Good Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery giddy word of it, my Chingangook,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, dancing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it? _We\xe2\x80\x99ve_ done nothing wrong. _We_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t poachers. _We_\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t cut about blastin\xe2\x80\x99 the characters of poor, innocent boys--saying\r\nthey were drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Foxy. \xe2\x80\x9cI--I only said that you be\xe2\x80\x99aved uncommon\r\nodd when you come back with that badger. Mr. King may have taken the\r\nwrong hint from that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Course he did; an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99ll jolly well shove all the blame on you when\r\nhe finds out he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. We know King, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed of you.\r\nYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t fit to be a sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot with three thorough-goin\xe2\x80\x99 young devils like you, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen had. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been ambuscaded. Horse, foot, an\xe2\x80\x99 guns, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been had,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99--an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no holdin\xe2\x80\x99 the junior forms after this. M\xe2\x80\x99rover,\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x99Ead will send me with a note to Colonel Dabney to ask if what you\r\nsay about bein\xe2\x80\x99 invited was true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99d better go in by the Lodge-gates this time, instead of\r\nchasin\xe2\x80\x99 your dam\xe2\x80\x99 boys--oh, that was the Epistle to King--so it was.\r\nWe-el, Foxy?\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky put his chin on his hands and regarded the victim\r\nwith deep delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu_! I gloat! Hear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cFoxy brought us\r\ntea when we were moral lepers. Foxy has a heart. Foxy has been in the\r\nArmy, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 had you in my company, young gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSergeant from the depths of his heart; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 given you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence at drum-head court-martial,\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m advocate for\r\nthe prisoner; and, besides, this is much too good to tell all the other\r\nbrutes in the Coll. They\xe2\x80\x99d _never_ understand. They play cricket, and\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x98Yes sir,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98O, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that. Go ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Foxy\xe2\x80\x99s a good little chap when he does not esteem himself so as\r\nto be clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Take not out your \xe2\x80\x99ounds on a werry windy day,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky struck in.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you let him off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cHeffy is my only joy--Heffy and King.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x99ad to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, plaintively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, O! Led away by bad companions in the execution of his duty\r\nor--or words to that effect. You\xe2\x80\x99re dismissed with a reprimand, Foxy.\r\n_We_ won\xe2\x80\x99t tell about _you_. I swear we won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cBad\r\nfor the discipline of the school. Horrid bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, gathering up the tea-things, \xe2\x80\x9cknowin\xe2\x80\x99 what I\r\nknow o\xe2\x80\x99 the young dev--gentlemen of the College, I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad to \xe2\x80\x99ear\r\nit. But what am I to tell the \xe2\x80\x99Ead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything you jolly well please, Foxy. _We_ aren\xe2\x80\x99t the criminals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo say that the Head was annoyed when the Sergeant appeared after dinner\r\nwith the day\xe2\x80\x99s crime-sheet would be putting it mildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorkran, McTurk, and Co., I see. Bounds as usual. Hullo! What the deuce\r\nis this? Suspicion of drinking. Whose charge??\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. King\xe2\x80\x99s, sir. I caught \xe2\x80\x99em out of bounds, sir: at least that was \xe2\x80\x99ow\r\nit looked. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot be\xe2\x80\x99ind, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d The Sergeant was evidently\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Head. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us have your version.\xe2\x80\x9d He and the Sergeant\r\nhad dealt with one another for some seven years; and the Head knew that\r\nMr. King\xe2\x80\x99s statements depended very largely on Mr. King\xe2\x80\x99s temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought they were out of bounds along the cliffs. But it come out\r\nthey wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, sir. I saw them go into Colonel Dabney\xe2\x80\x99s woods, and--Mr.\r\nKing and Mr. Prout come along--and the fact was, sir, we was mistook\r\nfor poachers by Colonel Dabney\xe2\x80\x99s people--Mr. King and Mr. Prout and me.\r\nThere were some words, sir, on both sides. The young gentlemen slipped\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ome somehow, and they seemed \xe2\x80\x99ighly humorous, sir. Mr. King was mistook\r\nby Colonel Dabney himself--Colonel Dabney bein\xe2\x80\x99 strict. Then they\r\npreferred to come straight to you, sir, on account of what--what Mr.\r\nKing may \xe2\x80\x99ave said about their \xe2\x80\x99abits afterwards in Mr. Prout\xe2\x80\x99s study.\r\nI only said they was \xe2\x80\x99ighly humorous, laughin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 gigglin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 a bit\r\nabove \xe2\x80\x99emselves. They\xe2\x80\x99ve since told me, sir, in a humorous way, that\r\nthey was invited by Colonel Dabney to go into \xe2\x80\x99is woods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell their house-master that, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey took up Mr. King on appeal just as soon as he spoke about\r\ntheir--\xe2\x80\x99abits. Put in the appeal at once, sir, an\xe2\x80\x99 asked to be sent\r\nto the dormitory waitin\xe2\x80\x99 for you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve since gathered, sir, in their\r\nhumorous way, sir, that some\xe2\x80\x99ow or other they\xe2\x80\x99ve \xe2\x80\x99eard about every word\r\nColonel Dabney said to Mr. King and Mr. Prout when he mistook \xe2\x80\x99em for\r\npoachers. I--I might ha\xe2\x80\x99 known when they led me on so that they \xe2\x80\x99eld\r\nthe inner line of communications. It\xe2\x80\x99s--it\xe2\x80\x99s a plain do, sir, if you\r\nask _me_; an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99re gloatin\xe2\x80\x99 over it in the dormitory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Head saw--saw even to the uttermost farthing--and his mouth twitched\r\na little under his mustache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend them to me at once, Sergeant. This case needn\xe2\x80\x99t wait over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said he when the three appeared under escort. \xe2\x80\x9cI want\r\nyour undivided attention for a few minutes. You\xe2\x80\x99ve known me for five\r\nyears, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve known you for--twenty-five. I think we understand one\r\nanother perfectly. I am now going to pay you a tremendous compliment\r\n(the brown one, please, Sergeant. Thanks. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t wait). I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto execute you without rhyme, Beetle, or reason. I know you went to\r\nColonel Dabney\xe2\x80\x99s covers because you were invited. I\xe2\x80\x99m not even going to\r\nsend the Sergeant with a note to ask if your statement is true; because\r\nI am convinced that on this occasion you have adhered strictly to the\r\ntruth. I know, too, that you were not drinking. (You can take off\r\nthat virtuous expression, McTurk, or I shall begin to fear you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand me.) There is not a flaw in any of your characters. And that\r\nis why I am going to perpetrate a howling injustice. Your reputations\r\nhave been injured, haven\xe2\x80\x99t they? You have been disgraced before the\r\nhouse, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you? You have a peculiarly keen regard for the honor of\r\nyour house, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you? Well, _now_ I am going to lick you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSix apiece was their portion upon that word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this I think\xe2\x80\x9d--the Head replaced the cane, and flung the written\r\ncharge into the waste-paper basket--\xe2\x80\x9ccovers the situation. When you\r\nfind a variation from the normal--this will be useful to you in later\r\nlife--always meet him in an abnormal way. And that reminds me. There are\r\na pile of paper-backs on that shelf. You can borrow them if you put them\r\nback. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll take any harm from being read in the open.\r\nThey smell of tobacco rather. You will go to prep. this evening as\r\nusual. Good-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said that amazing man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, and thank you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear I\xe2\x80\x99ll pray for the Head to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cThose last two\r\ncuts were just flicks on my collar. There\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x98Monte Cristo\xe2\x80\x99 in that\r\nlower shelf. I saw it. Bags I, next time we go to Aves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearr man!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cNo gating. No impots. No beastly questions.\r\nAll settled. Hullo! what\xe2\x80\x99s King goin\xe2\x80\x99 in to him for--King and Prout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhatever the nature of that interview, it did not improve either King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nor Prout\xe2\x80\x99s ruffled plumes, for, when they came out of the Head\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\neyes noted that the one was red and blue with emotion as to his nose,\r\nand that the other was sweating profusely. That sight compensated them\r\namply for the Imperial Jaw with which they were favored by the two. It\r\nseems--and who so astonished as they?--that they had held back material\r\nfacts; were guilty both of _suppressio veri_ and _suggestio falsi_\r\n(well-known gods against whom they often offended); further, that they\r\nwere malignant in their dispositions, untrustworthy in their characters,\r\npernicious and revolutionary in their influences, abandoned to the\r\ndevils of wilfulness, pride, and a most intolerable conceit. Ninthly,\r\nand lastly, they were to have a care and to be very careful.\r\n\r\nThey were careful, as only boys can be when there is a hurt to be\r\ninflicted. They waited through one suffocating week till Prout and\r\nKing were their royal selves again; waited till there was a\r\nhouse-match--their own house, too--in which Prout was taking part;\r\nwaited, further, till he had his pads in the pavilion and stood ready to\r\ngo forth. King was scoring at the window, and the three sat on a bench\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nSaid Stalky to Beetle: \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Beetle, _quis custodet ipsos custodes_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have nothin\xe2\x80\x99 private with you. Ye can\r\nbe as private as ye please the other end of the bench; and I wish ye a\r\nvery good afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMcTurk yawned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ye should ha\xe2\x80\x99 come up to the lodge like Christians instead o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nchasin\xe2\x80\x99 your--a-hem--boys through the length an\xe2\x80\x99 breadth of my covers.\r\n_I_ think these house-matches are all rot. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go over to Colonel\r\nDabney\xe2\x80\x99s an\xe2\x80\x99 see if he\xe2\x80\x99s collared any more poachers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat afternoon there was joy in Aves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVES OF THE LAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe music-room on the top floor of Number Five was filled with the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAladdin\xe2\x80\x9d company at rehearsal. Dickson Quartus, commonly known as Dick\r\nFour, was Aladdin, stage-manager, ballet-master, half the orchestra, and\r\nlargely librettist, for the \xe2\x80\x9cbook\xe2\x80\x9d had been rewritten and filled\r\nwith local allusions. The pantomime was to be given next week, in the\r\ndown-stairs study occupied by Aladdin, Abanazar, and the Emperor of\r\nChina. The Slave of the Lamp, with the Princess Badroulbadour and the\r\nWidow Twankay, owned Number Five study across the same landing, so\r\nthat the company could be easily assembled. The floor shook to the\r\nstamp-and-go of the ballet, while Aladdin, in pink cotton tights, a blue\r\nand tinsel jacket, and a plumed hat, banged alternately on the piano and\r\nhis banjo. He was the moving spirit of the game, as befitted a senior\r\nwho had passed his Army Preliminary and hoped to enter Sandhurst next\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nAladdin came to his own at last, Abanazar lay poisoned on the floor, the\r\nWidow Twankay danced her dance, and the company decided it would \xe2\x80\x9ccome\r\nall right on the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the last song, though?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor, a tallish,\r\nfair-headed boy with a ghost of a mustache, at which he pulled manfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need a rousing old tune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98John Peel\xe2\x80\x99? \xe2\x80\x98Drink, Puppy, Drink\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Abanazar, smoothing his\r\nbaggy lilac pajamas. \xe2\x80\x9cPussy\xe2\x80\x9d Abanazar never looked more than one-half\r\nawake, but he owned a soft, slow smile which well suited the part of the\r\nWicked Uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStale,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aladdin. \xe2\x80\x9cMight as well have \xe2\x80\x98Grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s Clock.\xe2\x80\x99 What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat thing you were humming at prep. last night, Stalky?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStalky, The Slave of the Lamp, in black tights and doublet, a black silk\r\nhalf-mask on his forehead, whistled lazily where he lay on the top of\r\nthe piano. It was a catchy music-hall tune.\r\n\r\nDick Four cocked his head critically, and squinted down a large red\r\nnose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more, and I can pick it up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, strumming. \xe2\x80\x9cSing the words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArrah, Patsy, mind the baby! Arrah, Patsy, mind the child! Wrap him in\r\nan overcoat, he\xe2\x80\x99s surely going wild! Arrah, Patsy, mind the baby! just\r\nyou mind the child awhile! He\xe2\x80\x99ll kick and bite and cry all night! Arrah,\r\nPatsy, mind the child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRippin\xe2\x80\x99! Oh, rippin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly we shan\xe2\x80\x99t have any piano\r\non the night. We must work it with the banjoes--play an\xe2\x80\x99 dance at the\r\nsame time. You try, Tertius.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Emperor pushed aside his pea-green sleeves of state, and followed\r\nDick Four on a heavy nickel-plated banjo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I\xe2\x80\x99m dead all this time. Bung in the middle of the stage, too,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Abanazar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s biznai,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four. \xe2\x80\x9cVamp it up, Beetle. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nkeep us waiting all night. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get Pussy out of the light\r\nsomehow, and bring us all in dancin\xe2\x80\x99 at the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. You two play it again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, who, in a gray skirt\r\nand a wig of chestnut sausage-curls, set slantwise above a pair of\r\nspectacles mended with an old boot-lace, represented the Widow Twankay.\r\nHe waved one leg in time to the hammered refrain, and the banjoes grew\r\nlouder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm! Ah! Er--\xe2\x80\x98Aladdin now has won his wife,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he sang, and Dick Four\r\nrepeated it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Your Emperor is appeased.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Tertius flung out his chest as he\r\ndelivered his line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow jump up, Pussy! Say, \xe2\x80\x98I think I\xe2\x80\x99d better come to life!\xe2\x80\x99 Then we\r\nall take hands and come forward: \xe2\x80\x98We hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve all been pleased.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n_Twiggez-vous_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Nous twiggons_. Good enough. What\xe2\x80\x99s the chorus for the final ballet?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s four kicks and a turn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Er!\r\n\r\n   John Short will ring the curtain down.\r\n   And ring the prompter\xe2\x80\x99s bell;\r\n   We hope you know before you go\r\n   That we all wish you well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRippin\xe2\x80\x99! Rippin\xe2\x80\x99! Now for the Widow\xe2\x80\x99s scene with the Princess. Hurry\r\nup, Turkey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMcTurk, in a violet silk skirt and a coquettish blue turban, slouched\r\nforward as one thoroughly ashamed of himself. The Slave of the Lamp\r\nclimbed down from the piano, and dispassionately kicked him. \xe2\x80\x9cPlay up,\r\nTurkey,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is serious.\xe2\x80\x9d But there fell on the door the\r\nknock of authority. It happened to be King, in gown and mortar-board,\r\nenjoying a Saturday evening prowl before dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLocked doors! Locked doors!\xe2\x80\x9d he snapped with a scowl. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmeaning of this; and what, may I ask, is the intention of this--this\r\nepicene attire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPantomime, sir. The Head gave us leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Abanazar, as the only\r\nmember of the Sixth concerned. Dick Four stood firm in the confidence\r\nborn of well-fitting tights, but Beetle strove to efface himself behind\r\nthe piano. A gray princess-skirt borrowed from a day-boy\xe2\x80\x99s mother and a\r\nspotted cotton bodice unsystematically padded with imposition-paper make\r\none ridiculous. And in other regards Beetle had a bad conscience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs usual!\xe2\x80\x9d sneered King. \xe2\x80\x9cFutile foolery just when your careers, such\r\nas they may be, are hanging in the balance. I see! Ah, I see! The old\r\ngang of criminals--allied forces of disorder--Corkran\xe2\x80\x9d--the Slave of the\r\nLamp smiled politely--\xe2\x80\x9cMcTurk\xe2\x80\x9d--the Irishman scowled--\xe2\x80\x9cand, of course,\r\nthe unspeakable Beetle, our friend Gigadibs.\xe2\x80\x9d Abanazar, the Emperor, and\r\nAladdin had more or less of characters, and King passed them over. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nforth, my inky buffoon, from behind yonder instrument of music! You\r\nsupply, I presume, the doggerel for this entertainment. Esteem yourself\r\nto be, as it were, a poet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s found one of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Beetle, noting the flush on King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheek-bone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just had the pleasure of reading an effusion of yours to\r\nmy address, I believe--an effusion intended to rhyme. So--so you\r\ndespise me, Master Gigadibs, do you? I am quite aware--you need not\r\nexplain--that it was ostensibly not intended for my edification. I\r\nread it with laughter--yes, with laughter. These paper pellets of\r\ninky boys--still a boy we are, Master Gigadibs--do not disturb my\r\nequanimity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonder which it was,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Beetle. He had launched many lampoons on\r\nan appreciative public ever since he discovered that it was possible to\r\nconvey reproof in rhyme.\r\n\r\nIn sign of his unruffled calm, King proceeded to tear Beetle, whom he\r\ncalled Gigadibs, slowly asunder. From his untied shoestrings to his\r\nmended spectacles (the life of a poet at a big school is hard) he held\r\nhim up to the derision of his associates--with the usual result. His\r\nwild flowers of speech--King had an unpleasant tongue---restored him to\r\ngood humor at the last. He drew a lurid picture of Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s latter\r\nend as a scurrilous pamphleteer dying in an attic, scattered a few\r\ncompliments over McTurk and Corkran, and, reminding Beetle that he must\r\ncome up for judgment when called upon, went to Common-room, where he\r\ntriumphed anew over his victims.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the worst of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained in a loud voice over his soup, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nthat I waste such gems of sarcasm on their thick heads. It\xe2\x80\x99s miles above\r\nthem, I\xe2\x80\x99m certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe-ell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the school chaplain slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Corkran\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappreciation of your style may be, but young McTurk reads Ruskin for his\r\namusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! He does it to show off. I mistrust the dark Celt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does nothing of the kind. I went into their study the other night,\r\nunofficially, and McTurk was gluing up the back of four odd numbers of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fors Clavigera.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about their private lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said a mathematical\r\nmaster hotly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned by bitter experience that Number Five\r\nstudy are best left alone. They are utterly soulless young devils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe blushed as the others laughed.\r\n\r\nBut in the music-room there were wrath and bad language. Only Stalky,\r\nSlave of the Lamp, lay on the piano unmoved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat little swine Manders minor must have shown him your stuff. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways suckin\xe2\x80\x99 up to King. Go and kill him,\xe2\x80\x9d he drawled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich one was\r\nit, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDunno,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, struggling out of the skirt. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was one about\r\nhis hunting for popularity with the small boys, and the other one was\r\none about him in hell, tellin\xe2\x80\x99 the Devil he was a Balliol man. I swear\r\nboth of \xe2\x80\x99em rhymed all right. By gum! P\xe2\x80\x99raps Manders minor showed him\r\nboth! _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ correct his caesuras for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe disappeared down two flights of stairs, flushed a small pink and\r\nwhite boy in a form-room next door to King\xe2\x80\x99s study, which, again,\r\nwas immediately below his own, and chased him up the corridor into a\r\nform-room sacred to the revels of the Lower Third. Thence he came\r\nback, greatly disordered, to find McTurk, Stalky, and the others of the\r\ncompany, in his study enjoying an unlimited \xe2\x80\x9cbrew\xe2\x80\x9d--coffee, cocoa, buns,\r\nnew bread hot and steaming, sardine, sausage, ham-and-tongue paste,\r\npilchards, three jams, and at least as many pounds of Devonshire cream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy hat!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, throwing himself upon the banquet. \xe2\x80\x9cWho stumped\r\nup for this, Stalky?\xe2\x80\x9d It was within a month of term end, and blank\r\nstarvation had reigned in the studies for weeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, serenely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound you! You haven\xe2\x80\x99t been popping my Sunday bags, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your hair on. It\xe2\x80\x99s only your watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch! I lost it--weeks ago. Out on the Burrows, when we tried to shoot\r\nthe old ram--the day our pistol burst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt dropped out of your pocket (you\xe2\x80\x99re so beastly careless, Beetle), and\r\nMcTurk and I kept it for you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wearing it for a week, and you\r\nnever noticed. Took it into Bideford after dinner to-day. Got thirteen\r\nand sevenpence. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty average cool,\xe2\x80\x9d said Abanazar behind a slab of\r\ncream and jam, as Beetle, reassured upon the safety of his Sunday\r\ntrousers, showed not even surprise, much less resentment. Indeed, it\r\nwas McTurk who grew angry, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gave him the ticket, Stalky? You _pawned_ it? You unmitigated\r\nbeast! Why, last month you and Beetle sold mine! \xe2\x80\x99Never got a sniff of\r\nany ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that was because you locked your trunk, and we wasted half the\r\nafternoon hammering it open. We might have pawned it if you\xe2\x80\x99d behaved\r\nlike a Christian, Turkey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d said Abanazar, \xe2\x80\x9cyou chaps _are_ communists. Vote of thanks to\r\nBeetle, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s beastly unfair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I took all the trouble to\r\npawn it. Beetle never knew he had a watch. Oh, I say, Rabbits-Eggs gave\r\nme a lift into Bideford this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRabbits-Eggs was the local carrier--an outcrop of the early Devonian\r\nformation. It was Stalky who had invented his unlovely name. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was\r\npretty average drunk, or he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it. Rabbits-Eggs is a\r\nlittle shy of me, somehow. But I swore it was _pax_ between us, and gave\r\nhim a bob. He stopped at two pubs on the way in, so he\xe2\x80\x99ll be howling\r\ndrunk to-night. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t begin reading, Beetle; there\xe2\x80\x99s a council of\r\nwar on. What the deuce is the matter with your collar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Chivied Manders minor into the Lower Third box-room. \xe2\x80\x99Had all his\r\nbeastly little friends on top of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle from behind a jar of\r\npilchards and a book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ass! Any fool could have told you where Manders would bunk to,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, meekly, scooping out pilchards with a\r\nspoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse you didn\xe2\x80\x99t. You never do.\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk adjusted Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s collar with\r\na savage tug. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t drop oil all over my \xe2\x80\x98Fors\xe2\x80\x99 or I\xe2\x80\x99ll scrag you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up, you--you Irish Biddy! \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t your beastly \xe2\x80\x98Fors.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s one of\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe book was a fat, brown-backed volume of the later Sixties, which King\r\nhad once thrown at Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s head that Beetle might see whence the\r\nname Gigadibs came. Beetle had quietly annexed the book, and had\r\nseen--several things. The quarter-comprehended verses lived and ate with\r\nhim, as the bedropped pages showed. He removed himself from all that\r\nworld, drifting at large with wondrous Men and Women, till McTurk\r\nhammered the pilchard spoon on his head and he snarled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeetle! You\xe2\x80\x99re oppressed and insulted and bullied by King. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nfeel it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me alone! I can write some more poetry about him if I am, I\r\nsuppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMad! Quite mad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky to the visitors, as one exhibiting strange\r\nbeasts. \xe2\x80\x9cBeetle reads an ass called Brownin\xe2\x80\x99, and McTurk reads an ass\r\ncalled Ruskin; and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuskin isn\xe2\x80\x99t an ass,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s almost as good as the Opium\r\nEater. He says \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99re children of noble races trained by surrounding\r\nart.\xe2\x80\x99 That means _me_, and the way I decorated the study when you two\r\nbadgers would have stuck up brackets and Christmas cards. Child of a\r\nnoble race, trained by surrounding art, stop reading, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll shove a\r\npilchard down your neck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s two to one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, warningly, and Beetle closed the book,\r\nin obedience to the law under which he and his companions had lived for\r\nsix checkered years.\r\n\r\nThe visitors looked on delighted. Number Five study had a reputation for\r\nmore variegated insanity than the rest of the school put together; and\r\nso far as its code allowed friendship with outsiders it was polite and\r\nopen-hearted to its neighbors on the same landing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat rot do you want now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKing! War!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, jerking his head toward the wall, where hung a\r\nsmall wooden West-African war-drum, a gift to McTurk from a naval uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we shall be turned out of the study again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, who loved\r\nhis flesh-pots. \xe2\x80\x9cMason turned us out for--just warbling on it.\xe2\x80\x9d Mason\r\nwas the mathematical master who had testified in Common-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarbling?--O Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said Abanazar. \xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear ourselves speak in\r\nour study when you played the infernal thing. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of getting\r\nturned out of your study, anyhow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe lived in the form-rooms for a week, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, tragically.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it was beastly cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe-es, but Mason\xe2\x80\x99s rooms were filled with rats every day we were out.\r\nIt took him a week to draw the inference,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cHe loathes\r\nrats. \xe2\x80\x99Minute he let us go back the rats stopped. Mason\xe2\x80\x99s a little shy\r\nof us now, but there was no evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJolly well there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I got out on the roof and\r\ndropped the beastly things down his chimney. But, look here--question\r\nis, are our characters good enough just now to stand a study row?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cKing swears I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not thinking of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky returned scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngoing up for the Army, you old bat. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be expelled--and the\r\nHead\xe2\x80\x99s getting rather shy of us, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRot!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Head never expels except for beastliness or\r\nstealing. But I forgot; you and Stalky _are_ thieves--regular burglars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visitors gasped, but Stalky interpreted the parable with large\r\ngrins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, that little beast Manders minor saw Beetle and me\r\nhammerin\xe2\x80\x99 McTurk\xe2\x80\x99s trunk open in the dormitory when we took his watch\r\nlast month. Of course Manders sneaked to Mason, and Mason solemnly took\r\nit up as a case of theft, to get even with us about the rats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat just put Mason into our giddy hands,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, blandly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nwere nice to him, because he was a new master and wanted to win the\r\nconfidence of the boys. \xe2\x80\x99Pity he draws inferences, though. Stalky went\r\nto his study and pretended to blub, and told Mason he\xe2\x80\x99d lead a new life\r\nif Mason would let him off this time, but Mason wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x99Said it was\r\nhis duty to report him to the Head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVindictive swine!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was all those rats! Then _I_\r\nblubbed, too, and Stalky confessed that he\xe2\x80\x99d been a thief in regular\r\npractice for six years, ever since he came to the school; and that I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ntaught him--_\xc3\xa0 la_ Fagin. Mason turned white with joy. He thought he had\r\nus on toast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGorgeous! Gorgeous!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four. \xe2\x80\x9cWe never heard of this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Course not. Mason kept it jolly quiet. He wrote down all our\r\nstatements on impot-paper. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd handed it all up to the Head, _with_ an extempore prayer. It took\r\nabout forty pages,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cI helped him a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, you crazy idiots?\xe2\x80\x9d said Abanazar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we were sent for; and Stalky asked to have the \xe2\x80\x98depositions\xe2\x80\x99 read\r\nout, and the Head knocked him spinning into a waste-paper basket. Then\r\nhe gave us eight cuts apiece--welters--for--for--takin\xe2\x80\x99 unheard-of\r\nliberties with a new master. I saw his shoulders shaking when we went\r\nout. Do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, pensively, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mason can\xe2\x80\x99t look at us\r\nnow in second lesson without blushing? We three stare at him sometimes\r\ntill he regularly trickles. He\xe2\x80\x99s an awfully sensitive beast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe read \xe2\x80\x98Eric, or Little by Little,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk; \xe2\x80\x9cso we gave him \xe2\x80\x98St.\r\nWinifred\xe2\x80\x99s, _or_ the World of School.\xe2\x80\x99 They spent all their spare time\r\nstealing at St. Winifred\xe2\x80\x99s, when they weren\xe2\x80\x99t praying or getting drunk\r\nat pubs. Well, that was only a week ago, and the Head\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit shy\r\nof us. He called it constructive deviltry. Stalky invented it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least good having a row with a master unless you can make an\r\nass of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, extended at ease on the hearth-rug. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Mason\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know Number Five--well, he\xe2\x80\x99s learnt, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Now, my dearly\r\nbeloved \xe2\x80\x99earers\xe2\x80\x9d--Stalky curled his legs under him and addressed the\r\ncompany--\xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got that strong\xe2\x80\x99, perseverin\xe2\x80\x99 man King on our hands. He\r\nwent miles out of his way to provoke a conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d (Here Stalky snapped\r\ndown the black silk domino and assumed the air of a judge.) \xe2\x80\x9cHe has\r\noppressed Beetle, McTurk, and me, _privatim et seriatim_, one by one,\r\nas he could catch us. But _now_, he has insulted Number Five up in\r\nthe music-room, and in the presence of these--these ossifers of the\r\nNinety-third, wot look like hairdressers. Binjimin, we must make him cry\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Capivi!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStalky\xe2\x80\x99s reading did _not_ include Browning or Ruskin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, besides,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s a Philistine, a basket-hanger. He\r\nwears a tartan tie. Ruskin says that any man who wears a tartan tie\r\nwill, without doubt, be damned everlastingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo, McTurk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius; \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he was only a beast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s that, too, of course, but he\xe2\x80\x99s worse. He has a china basket with\r\nblue ribbons and a pink kitten on it, hung up in his window to grow musk\r\nin. You know when I got all that old oak carvin\xe2\x80\x99 out of Bideford Church,\r\nwhen they were restoring it (Ruskin says that any man who\xe2\x80\x99ll restore a\r\nchurch is an unmitigated sweep), and stuck it up here with glue? Well,\r\nKing came in and wanted to know whether we\xe2\x80\x99d done it with a fret-saw!\r\nYah! He is the King of basket-hangers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDown went McTurk\xe2\x80\x99s inky thumb over an imaginary arena full of bleeding\r\nKings. \xe2\x80\x9c_Placetne_, child of a generous race!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried to Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d began Beetle, doubtfully, \xe2\x80\x9che comes from Balliol, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto give the beast a chance. You see I can always make him hop with\r\nsome more poetry. He can\xe2\x80\x99t report me to the Head, because it makes him\r\nridiculous. (Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s quite right.) But he shall have his chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeetle opened the book on the table, ran his finger down a page, and\r\nbegan at random:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cOr who in Moscow toward the Czar\r\n   With the demurest of footfalls,\r\n   Over the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s pavement white\r\n   With serpentine and syenite,\r\n   Steps with five other generals--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no good. Try another,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on a shake; I know what\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk was reading over\r\nBeetle\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cThat simultaneously take snuff,\r\n   For each to have pretext enough\r\n   And kerchiefwise unfold his sash,\r\n   Which--softness\xe2\x80\x99 self--is yet the stuff\r\n\r\n(Gummy! What a sentence!)\r\n\r\n   To hold fast where a steel chain snaps\r\n   And leave the grand white neck no gash.\r\n\r\n(Full stop.)\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Don\xe2\x80\x99t understand a word of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore fool you! Construe,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cThose six bargees scragged the\r\nCzar, and left no evidence. _Actum est_ with King.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave me that book, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, licking his lips:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a great text in Galatians,\r\n   Once you trip on it entails\r\n   Twenty-nine distinct damnations,\r\n   One sure if another fails.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen irrelevantly:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cSetebos! Setebos! and Setebos!\r\n   Thinketh he liveth in the cold of the moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just come in from dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four, looking through the\r\nwindow. \xe2\x80\x9cManders minor is with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Safest place for Manders minor just now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you chaps had better clear out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky politely to the\r\nvisitors. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t fair to mix you up in a study row. Besides, we can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nafford to have evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to begin at once?\xe2\x80\x99 said Aladdin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmediately, if not sooner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, and turned out the gas.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrong, perseverin\xe2\x80\x99 man--King. Make him cry \xe2\x80\x98Capivi.\xe2\x80\x99 G\xe2\x80\x99way, Binjimin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe company retreated to their own neat and spacious study with\r\nexpectant souls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Stalky blows out his nostrils like a horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aladdin to the\r\nEmperor of China, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s on the war-path. \xe2\x80\x99Wonder what King will get.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeans,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor. \xe2\x80\x9cNumber Five generally pays in full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonder if I ought to take any notice of it officially,\xe2\x80\x9d said Abanazar,\r\nwho had just remembered he was a prefect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s none of your business, Pussy. Besides, if you did, we\xe2\x80\x99d have them\r\nhostile to _us_; and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do any work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aladdin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve begun already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow that West-African war-drum had been made to signal across estuaries\r\nand deltas. Number Five was forbidden to wake the engine within earshot\r\nof the school. But a deep, devastating drone filled the passages as\r\nMcTurk and Beetle scientifically rubbed its top. Anon it changed to the\r\nblare of trumpets--of savage pursuing trumpets. Then, as McTurk slapped\r\none side, smooth with the blood of ancient sacrifice, the roar broke\r\ninto short coughing howls such as the wounded gorilla throws in his\r\nnative forest. These were followed by the wrath of King--three steps\r\nat a time, up the staircase, with a dry whir of the gown. Aladdin and\r\ncompany, listening, squeaked with excitement as the door crashed open.\r\nKing stumbled into the darkness, and cursed those performers by the gods\r\nof Balliol and quiet repose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurned out for a week,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aladdin, holding the study door on the\r\ncrack. \xe2\x80\x9cKey to be brought down to his study in five minutes. \xe2\x80\x98Brutes!\r\nBarbarians! Savages! Children!\xe2\x80\x99 He\xe2\x80\x99s rather agitated. \xe2\x80\x98Arrah, Patsy,\r\nmind the baby,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he sang in a whisper as he clung to the door-knob,\r\ndancing a noiseless war-dance.\r\n\r\nKing went down-stairs again, and Beetle and McTurk lit the gas to confer\r\nwith Stalky. But Stalky had vanished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooks like no end of a mess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, collecting his books and\r\nmathematical instrument case. \xe2\x80\x9cA week in the form-rooms isn\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nadvantage to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but don\xe2\x80\x99t you see that Stalky isn\xe2\x80\x99t here, you owl!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake down the key, and look sorrowful. King\xe2\x80\x99ll only jaw you for half an\r\nhour. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read in the lower form-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s always me,\xe2\x80\x9d mourned Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till we see,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, hopefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know any more than\r\nyou do what Stalky means, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something. Go down and draw King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfire. You\xe2\x80\x99re used to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the key turned in the door than the lid of the coal-box,\r\nwhich was also the window-seat, lifted cautiously. It had been a tight\r\nfit, even for the lithe Stalky, his head between his knees, and his\r\nstomach under his right ear. From a drawer in the table he took a\r\nwell-worn catapult, a handful of buckshot, and a duplicate key of the\r\nstudy; noiselessly he raised the window and kneeled by it, his face\r\nturned to the road, the wind-sloped trees, the dark levels of the\r\nBurrows, and the white line of breakers falling nine-deep along the\r\nPebbleridge. Far down the steep-banked Devonshire lane he heard the\r\nhusky hoot of the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s horn. There was a ghost of melody in it, as\r\nit might have been the wind in a gin-bottle essaying to sing, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nway we have in the Army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStalky smiled a tight-lipped smile, and at extreme range opened fire:\r\nthe old horse half wheeled in the shafts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere he gwaine tu?\xe2\x80\x9d hiccoughed Rabbits-Eggs. Another buckshot tore\r\nthrough the rotten canvas tilt with a vicious zipp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Habet_!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Stalky, as Rabbits-Eggs swore into the patient\r\nnight, protesting that he saw the \xe2\x80\x9cdommed colleger\xe2\x80\x9d who was assaulting\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so,\xe2\x80\x9d King was saying in a high head voice to Beetle, whom he had\r\nkept to play with before Manders minor, well knowing that it hurts\r\na Fifth-form boy to be held up to a fag\xe2\x80\x99s derision, \xe2\x80\x9cand so, Master\r\nBeetle, in spite of all our verses, which we are so proud of, when\r\nwe presume to come into direct conflict with even so humble a\r\nrepresentative of authority as myself, for instance, we are turned out\r\nof our studies, are we not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, with a sheepish grin on his lips and murder in\r\nhis heart. Hope had nearly left him, but he clung to a well-established\r\nfaith that never was Stalky so dangerous as when he was invisible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are _not_ required to criticise, thank you. Turned out of our\r\nstudies, we are, just as if we were no better than little Manders minor.\r\nOnly inky schoolboys we are, and must be treated as such.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeetle pricked up his ears, for Rabbits-Eggs was swearing savagely\r\non the road, and some of the language entered at the upper sash. King\r\nbelieved in ventilation. He strode to the window gowned and majestic,\r\nvery visible in the gaslight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI zee \xe2\x80\x99un! I zee \xe2\x80\x99un!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Rabbits-Eggs, now that he had found a\r\nvisible foe--another shot from the darkness above. \xe2\x80\x9cYiss, yeou, yeou\r\nlong-nosed, fower-eyed, gingy-whiskered beggar! Yeu\xe2\x80\x99m tu old for such\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99s on. Aie! Poultice yeour nose, I tall \xe2\x80\x99ee! Poultice yeour long\r\nnose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeetle\xe2\x80\x99s heart leaped up within him. Somewhere, somehow, he knew, Stalky\r\nmoved behind these manifestations. There were hope and the prospect\r\nof revenge. He would embody the suggestion about the nose in deathless\r\nverse. King threw up the window, and sternly rebuked Rabbits-Eggs. But\r\nthe carrier was beyond fear or fawning. He had descended from the cart,\r\nand was stooping by the roadside.\r\n\r\nIt all fell swiftly as a dream. Manders minor raised his hand to his\r\nhead with a cry, as a jagged flint cannoned on to some rich tree-calf\r\nbindings in the book-shelf. Another quoited along the writing-table.\r\nBeetle made zealous feint to stop it, and in that endeavor overturned\r\na student\xe2\x80\x99s lamp, which dripped, _via_ King\xe2\x80\x99s papers and some choice\r\nbooks, greasily on to a Persian rug. There was much broken glass on the\r\nwindow-seat; the china basket--McTurk\xe2\x80\x99s aversion--cracked to flinders,\r\nhad dropped her musk plant and its earth over the red rep cushions;\r\nManders minor was bleeding profusely from a cut on the cheek-bone; and\r\nKing, using strange words, every one of which Beetle treasured, ran\r\nforth to find the school-sergeant, that Rabbits-Eggs might be instantly\r\ncast into jail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor chap!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, with a false, feigned sympathy. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it\r\nbleed a little. That\xe2\x80\x99ll prevent apoplexy,\xe2\x80\x9d and he held the blind head\r\nskilfully over the table, and the papers on the table, as he guided the\r\nhowling Manders to the door.\r\n\r\nThen did Beetle, alone with the wreckage, return good for evil. How, in\r\nthat office, a complete set of \xe2\x80\x9cGibbon\xe2\x80\x9d was scarred all along the back\r\nas by a flint; how so much black and copying ink came to be mingled with\r\nManders\xe2\x80\x99s gore on the table-cloth; why the big gum-bottle, unstoppered,\r\nhad rolled semicircularly across the floor; and in what manner the white\r\nchina door-knob grew to be painted with yet more of Manders\xe2\x80\x99s young\r\nblood, were matters which Beetle did not explain when the rabid King\r\nreturned to find him standing politely over the reeking hearth-rug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never told me to go, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with the air of Casabianca, and\r\nKing consigned him to the outer darkness.\r\n\r\nBut it was to a boot-cupboard under the staircase on the ground floor\r\nthat he hastened, to loose the mirth that was destroying him. He had\r\nnot drawn breath for a first whoop of triumph when two hands choked him\r\ndumb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the dormitory and get me my things. Bring \xe2\x80\x99em to Number Five\r\nlavatory. I\xe2\x80\x99m still in tights,\xe2\x80\x9d hissed Stalky, sitting on his head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t run. Walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Beetle staggered into the form-room next door, and delegated his\r\nduty to the yet unenlightened McTurk, with an hysterical precis of the\r\ncampaign thus far. So it was McTurk, of the wooden visage, who brought\r\nthe clothes from the dormitory while Beetle panted on a form. Then the\r\nthree buried themselves in Number Five lavatory, turned on all the taps,\r\nfilled the place with steam, and dropped weeping into the baths, where\r\nthey pieced out the war.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Moi_! _Je_! _Ich_! _Ego_!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cI waited till I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear myself think, while you played the drum! Hid in the\r\ncoal-locker--and tweaked Rabbits-Eggs--and Rabbits-Eggs rocked King.\r\nWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it beautiful? Did you hear the glass?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he--he--he,\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked McTurk, one trembling finger pointed at\r\nBeetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I--I--I was through it all,\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle howled; \xe2\x80\x9cin his study, being\r\njawed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky with a yell, disappearing under water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe--the glass was nothing. Manders minor\xe2\x80\x99s head\xe2\x80\x99s cut open.\r\nLa--la--lamp upset all over the rug. Blood on the books and papers. The\r\ngum! The gum! The gum! The ink! The ink! The ink! Oh, Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Stalky leaped out, all pink as he was, and shook Beetle into some\r\nsort of coherence; but his tale prostrated them afresh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bunked for the boot-cupboard the second I heard King go down-stairs.\r\nBeetle tumbled in on top of me. The spare key\xe2\x80\x99s hid behind the loose\r\nboard. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a shadow of evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. They were all\r\nchanting together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he turned us out himself--himself--him_self_!\xe2\x80\x9d This from McTurk.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t begin to suspect us. Oh, Stalky, it\xe2\x80\x99s the loveliest thing\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGum! Gum! Dollops of gum!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Beetle, his spectacles gleaming\r\nthrough a sea of lather. \xe2\x80\x9cInk and blood all mixed. I held the little\r\nbeast\xe2\x80\x99s head all over the Latin proses for Monday. Golly, how the oil\r\nstunk! And Rabbits-Eggs told King to poultice his nose! Did you hit\r\nRabbits-Eggs, Stalky?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I jolly well not? Tweaked him all over. Did you hear him curse? Oh,\r\nI shall be sick in a minute if I don\xe2\x80\x99t stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut dressing was a slow process, because McTurk was obliged to dance\r\nwhen he heard that the musk basket was broken, and, moreover, Beetle\r\nretailed all King\xe2\x80\x99s language with emendations and purple insets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShockin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, collapsing in a helpless welter of half-hitched\r\ntrousers. \xe2\x80\x9cSo dam\xe2\x80\x99 bad, too, for innocent boys like us! Wonder what\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d say at \xe2\x80\x98St. Winifred\xe2\x80\x99s, or the World of School.\xe2\x80\x99--By gum! That\r\nreminds me we owe the Lower Third one for assaultin\xe2\x80\x99 Beetle when he\r\nchivied Manders minor. Come on! It\xe2\x80\x99s an alibi, Samivel; and, besides, if\r\nwe let \xe2\x80\x99em off they\xe2\x80\x99ll be worse next time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lower Third had set a guard upon their form-room for the space of a\r\nfull hour, which to a boy is a lifetime. Now they were busy with their\r\nSaturday evening businesses--cooking sparrows over the gas with\r\nrusty nibs; brewing unholy drinks in gallipots; skinning moles with\r\npocket-knives; attending to paper trays full of silkworms, or discussing\r\nthe iniquities of their elders with a freedom, fluency, and point that\r\nwould have amazed their parents. The blow fell without warning. Stalky\r\nupset a form crowded with small boys among their own cooking utensils,\r\nMcTurk raided the untidy lockers as a terrier digs at a rabbit-hole,\r\nwhile Beetle poured ink upon such heads as he could not appeal to with\r\na Smith\xe2\x80\x99s Classical Dictionary. Three brisk minutes accounted for many\r\nsilkworms, pet larvae, French exercises, school caps, half-prepared\r\nbones and skulls, and a dozen pots of home-made sloe jam. It was a great\r\nwreckage, and the form-room looked as though three conflicting tempests\r\nhad smitten it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhew!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, drawing breath outside the door (amid groans of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you beastly ca-ads! You think yourselves awful funny,\xe2\x80\x9d and so\r\nforth). \xe2\x80\x9c_That\xe2\x80\x99s_ all right. Never let the sun go down upon your wrath.\r\nRummy little devils, fags. Got no notion o\xe2\x80\x99 combinin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix of \xe2\x80\x99em sat on my head when I went in after Manders minor,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBeetle. \xe2\x80\x9cI warned \xe2\x80\x99em what they\xe2\x80\x99d get, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody paid in full--beautiful feelin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk absently, as\r\nthey strolled along the corridor. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99d better say much\r\nabout King, though, do you, Stalky?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot _much_. Our line is injured innocence, of course--same as when the\r\nSergeant reported us on suspicion of smoking in the bunkers. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthought of buyin\xe2\x80\x99 the pepper and spillin\xe2\x80\x99 it all over our clothes,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d have smelt us. King was gha-astly facetious about that. \xe2\x80\x99Called us\r\nbird-stuffers in form for a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, King hates the Natural History Society because little Hartopp is\r\npresident. Mustn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything in the Coll. without glorifyin\xe2\x80\x99 King,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he must be a putrid ass, know, to suppose at our time\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 life we\xe2\x80\x99d go and stuff birds like fags.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor old King!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s unpopular in Common-room, and\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll chaff his head off about Rabbits-Eggs. Golly! How lovely! How\r\nbeautiful! How holy! But you should have seen his face when the first\r\nrock came in! _And_ the earth from the basket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they were all stricken helpless for five minutes.\r\n\r\nThey repaired at last to Abanazar\xe2\x80\x99s study, and were received reverently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, quick to realize new atmospheres.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know jolly well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Abanazar. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be expelled if you get\r\ncaught. King is a gibbering maniac.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? Which? What? Expelled for how? We only played the war-drum. We\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot turned out for that already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you chaps mean to say you didn\xe2\x80\x99t make Rabbits-Eggs drunk and bribe\r\nhim to rock King\xe2\x80\x99s rooms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBribe him? No, that I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear we didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, with a relieved\r\nheart, for he loved not to tell lies. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a low mind you\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\r\nPussy! We\xe2\x80\x99ve been down having a bath. Did Rabbits-Eggs rock King?\r\nStrong, perseverin\xe2\x80\x99 man King? Shockin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwf\xe2\x80\x99ly. King\xe2\x80\x99s frothing at the mouth. There\xe2\x80\x99s bell for prayers. Come\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a sec,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, continuing the conversation in a loud and\r\ncheerful voice, as they descended the stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did Rabbits-Eggs\r\nrock King for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, as they passed King\xe2\x80\x99s open door. \xe2\x80\x9cI was in his\r\nstudy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, you ass!\xe2\x80\x9d hissed the Emperor of China. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone down to\r\nprayers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, watching the shadow of the house-master on the\r\nwall. \xe2\x80\x9cRabbits-Eggs was only a bit drunk, swearin\xe2\x80\x99 at his horse, and\r\nKing jawed him through the window, and then, of course, he rocked King.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, \xe2\x80\x9cthat King began it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKing was behind them, and every well-weighed word went up the staircase\r\nlike an arrow. \xe2\x80\x9cI can only swear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, \xe2\x80\x9cthat King cursed like a\r\nbargee. Simply disgustin\xe2\x80\x99. I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to write to my father about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter report it to Mason,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows our tender\r\nconsciences. Hold on a shake. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to tie my boot-lace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other study hurried forward. They did not wish to be dragged into\r\nstage asides of this nature. So it was left to McTurk to sum up the\r\nsituation beneath the guns of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Irishman, hanging on the banister, \xe2\x80\x9che begins by\r\nbullying little chaps; then he bullies the big chaps; then he bullies\r\nsome one who isn\xe2\x80\x99t connected with the College, and then catches it.\r\nServes him jolly well right... I beg your pardon, sir. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you\r\nwere coming down the staircase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe black gown tore past like a thunder-storm, and in its wake, three\r\nabreast, arms linked, the Aladdin company rolled up the big corridor to\r\nprayers, singing with most innocent intention:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cArrah, Patsy, mind the baby! Arrah, Patsy, mind the child!\r\n   Wrap him up in an overcoat, he\xe2\x80\x99s surely goin\xe2\x80\x99 wild!\r\n   Arrah, Patsy, mind the baby; just ye mind the child awhile!\r\n   He\xe2\x80\x99ll kick an\xe2\x80\x99 bite an\xe2\x80\x99 cry all night! Arrah, Patsy, mind\r\n     the child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNSAVORY INTERLUDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a maiden aunt of Stalky who sent him both books, with the\r\ninscription, \xe2\x80\x9cTo dearest Artie, on his sixteenth birthday;\xe2\x80\x9d it was\r\nMcTurk who ordered their hypothecation; and it was Beetle, returned from\r\nBideford, who flung them on the window-sill of Number Five study with\r\nnews that Bastable would advance but ninepence on the two; \xe2\x80\x9cEric; or,\r\nLittle by Little,\xe2\x80\x9d being almost as great a drug as \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Winifred\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think much of your aunt. We\xe2\x80\x99re nearly out of cartridges,\r\ntoo--Artie, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereupon Stalky rose up to grapple with him, but McTurk sat on Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead, calling him a \xe2\x80\x9cpure-minded boy\xe2\x80\x9d till peace was declared. As they\r\nwere grievously in arrears with a Latin prose, as it was a blazing July\r\nafternoon, and as they ought to have been at a house cricket-match,\r\nthey began to renew their acquaintance, intimate and unholy, with the\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Corporal punishment produced on Eric the\r\nworst effects. He burned _not_ with remorse or regret\xe2\x80\x99--make a note o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat, Beetle--\xe2\x80\x98but with shame and violent indignation. He glared\xe2\x80\x99--oh,\r\nnaughty Eric! Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to where he goes in for drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on half a shake. Here\xe2\x80\x99s another sample. \xe2\x80\x98The Sixth,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98is\r\nthe palladium of all public schools.\xe2\x80\x99 But this lot--\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky rapped the\r\ngilded book--\xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t prevent fellows drinkin\xe2\x80\x99 and stealin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 lettin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfags out of window at night, an\xe2\x80\x99--an\xe2\x80\x99 doin\xe2\x80\x99 what they please. Golly,\r\nwhat we\xe2\x80\x99ve missed--not goin\xe2\x80\x99 to St. Winifred\xe2\x80\x99s!...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to see any boys of my house taking so little interest in\r\ntheir matches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Prout could move very silently if he pleased, though that is\r\nno merit in a boy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. He had flung open the study-door without\r\nknocking--another sin--and looked at them suspiciously. \xe2\x80\x9cVery sorry,\r\nindeed, I am to see you frowsting in your studies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been out ever since dinner, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said. McTurk wearily. One\r\nhouse-match is just like another, and their \xe2\x80\x9cploy\xe2\x80\x9d of that week happened\r\nto be rabbit-shooting with saloon-pistols.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see a ball when it\xe2\x80\x99s coming, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had my\r\ngig-lamps smashed at the Nets till I got excused. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any good even\r\nas a fag, then, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTuck is probably your form. Tuck and brewing. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you three take\r\nany interest in the honor of your house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had heard that phrase till they were wearied. The \xe2\x80\x9chonor of the\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x9d was Prout\xe2\x80\x99s weak point, and they knew well how to flick him on\r\nthe raw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you order us to go down, sir, of course we\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, with\r\nmaddening politeness. But Prout knew better than that. He had tried the\r\nexperiment once at a big match, when the three, self-isolated, stood\r\nto attention for half an hour in full view of all the visitors, to whom\r\nfags, subsidized for that end, pointed them out as victims of Prout\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntyranny. And Prout was a sensitive man.\r\n\r\nIn the infinitely petty confederacies of the Common-room, King and\r\nMacrea, fellow house-masters, had borne it in upon him that by games,\r\nand games alone, was salvation wrought. Boys neglected were boys lost.\r\nThey must be disciplined. Left to himself, Prout would have made\r\na sympathetic house-master; but he was never so left, and with the\r\ndevilish insight of youth, the boys knew to whom they were indebted for\r\nhis zeal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust we go down, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to order you to do what a right-thinking boy should do\r\ngladly. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d And he lurched out with some hazy impression that he\r\nhad sown good seed on poor ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow what does he suppose is the use of that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s cracked. King jaws him in Common-room about not keepin\xe2\x80\x99 us up\r\nto the mark, an\xe2\x80\x99 Macrea burbles about \xe2\x80\x98dithcipline,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 old Heffy sits\r\nbetween \xe2\x80\x99em sweatin\xe2\x80\x99 big drops. I heard Oke (the Common-room butler)\r\ntalking to Richards (Prout\xe2\x80\x99s house-servant) about it down in the\r\nbasement the other day when I went down to bag some bread,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did Oke say?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded McTurk, throwing \xe2\x80\x9cEric\xe2\x80\x9d into a corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he said, \xe2\x80\x98They make more nise nor a nest full o\xe2\x80\x99 jackdaws, an\xe2\x80\x99 half\r\nof it like we\xe2\x80\x99d no ears to our heads that waited on \xe2\x80\x99em. They talks over\r\nold Prout--what he\xe2\x80\x99ve done an\xe2\x80\x99 left undone about his boys. An\xe2\x80\x99 how their\r\nboys be fine boys, an\xe2\x80\x99 his\xe2\x80\x99n be dom bad.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, Oke talked like that,\r\nyou know, and Richards got awf\xe2\x80\x99ly wrathy. He has a down on King for\r\nsomething or other. Wonder why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, King talks about Prout in form-room--makes allusions, an\xe2\x80\x99 all\r\nthat--only half the chaps are such asses they can\xe2\x80\x99t see what he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrivin\xe2\x80\x99 at. And d\xe2\x80\x99you remember what he said about the \xe2\x80\x98Casual House\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlast Tuesday? He meant us. They say he says perfectly beastly things to\r\nhis own house, making fun of Prout\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here to mix up in their rows,\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk said\r\nwrathfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99ll bathe after call-over? King\xe2\x80\x99s takin\xe2\x80\x99 it in the\r\ncricket-field. Come on.\xe2\x80\x9d Turkey seized his straw and led the way.\r\n\r\nThey reached the sun-blistered pavilion over against the gray\r\nPebbleridge just before roll-call, and, asking no questions, gathered\r\nfrom King\xe2\x80\x99s voice and manner that his house was on the road to victory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning to show the light of his countenance. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\r\nwe have the ornaments of the Casual House at last. You consider cricket\r\nbeneath you, I believe\xe2\x80\x9d--the crowd, flannelled, sniggered \xe2\x80\x9cand from\r\nwhat I have seen this afternoon, I fancy many others of your house hold\r\nthe same view. And may I ask what you purpose to do with your noble\r\nselves till tea-time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing down to bathe, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whence this sudden zeal for cleanliness? There is nothing about you\r\nthat particularly suggests it. Indeed, so far as I remember--I may be at\r\nfault--but a short time ago--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive years, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle hotly.\r\n\r\nKing scowled. \xe2\x80\x9c_One_ of you was that thing called a water-funk. Yes,\r\na water-funk. So now you wish to wash? It is well. Cleanliness never\r\ninjured a boy or--a house. We will proceed to business,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\naddressed himself to the call-over board.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the deuce did you say anything to him for, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk\r\nangrily, as they strolled towards the big, open sea-baths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twasn\xe2\x80\x99t fair--remindin\xe2\x80\x99 one of bein\xe2\x80\x99 a water-funk. My first term, too.\r\nHeaps of chaps are--when they can\xe2\x80\x99t swim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you ass; but he saw he\xe2\x80\x99d fetched you. You ought never to answer\r\nKing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fair, Stalky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Hat! You\xe2\x80\x99ve been here six years, and you expect fairness. Well, you\r\nare a dithering idiot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA knot of King\xe2\x80\x99s boys, also bound for the baths, hailed them, beseeching\r\nthem to wash--for the honor of their house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what comes of King\xe2\x80\x99s jawin\xe2\x80\x99 and messin\xe2\x80\x99. Those young animals\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought of it unless he\xe2\x80\x99d put it into their heads. Now\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll be funny about it for weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take any\r\nnotice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys came nearer, shouting an opprobrious word. At last they moved\r\nto windward, ostentatiously holding their noses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be sayin\xe2\x80\x99 our house stinks next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they returned from the baths, damp-headed, languid, at peace with\r\nthe world, Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s forecast came only too true. They were met in the\r\ncorridor by a fag--a common, Lower-Second fag--who at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length\r\nhanded them a carefully wrapped piece of soap \xe2\x80\x9cwith the compliments of\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, checking immediate attack. \xe2\x80\x9cWho put you up\r\nto this, Nixon? Rattray and White? (Those were two leaders in King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse.) Thank you. There\xe2\x80\x99s no answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s too sickening to have this kind o\xe2\x80\x99 rot shoved on to a chap.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the sense of it? What\xe2\x80\x99s the fun of it?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will go on to the end of the term, though,\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle wagged his head\r\nsorrowfully. He had worn many jests threadbare on his own account.\r\n\r\nIn a few days it became an established legend of the school that Prout\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse did not wash and were therefore noisome. Mr. King was pleased to\r\nsmile succulently in form when one of his boys drew aside from Beetle\r\nwith certain gestures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere seems to be some disability attaching to you, my Beetle, or else\r\nwhy should Burton major withdraw, so to speak, the hem of his garments?\r\nI confess I am still in the dark. Will some one be good enough to\r\nenlighten me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNaturally, he was enlightened by half the form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExtraordinary! Most extraordinary! However, each house has its\r\ntraditions, with which I would not for the world interfere.\r\n_We_ have a prejudice in favor of washing. Go on, Beetle--from\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_jugurtha tamen_\xe2\x80\x99--and, if you can, avoid the more flagrant forms of\r\nguessing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProut\xe2\x80\x99s house was furious because Macrea\xe2\x80\x99s and Hartopp\xe2\x80\x99s houses joined\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s to insult them. They called a house-meeting after dinner--an\r\nexcited and angry meeting of all save the prefects, whose dignity,\r\nthough they sympathized, did not allow them to attend. They read\r\nungrammatical resolutions, and made speeches beginning, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, we\r\nhave met on this occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d and ending with, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a beastly shame,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n precisely as houses have done since time and schools began.\r\n\r\nNumber Five study attended, with its usual air of bland patronage. At\r\nlast McTurk, of the lanthorn jaws, delivered himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou jabber and jaw and burble, and that\xe2\x80\x99s about all you can do. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe good of it? King\xe2\x80\x99s house\xe2\x80\x99ll only gloat because they\xe2\x80\x99ve drawn\r\nyou, and King will gloat, too. Besides, that resolution of Orrin\xe2\x80\x99s is\r\nchock-full of bad grammar, and King\xe2\x80\x99ll gloat over _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you an\xe2\x80\x99 Beetle would put it right, an\xe2\x80\x99--an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99d post it in\r\nthe corridor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the composer meekly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Par si je le connai_. I\xe2\x80\x99m not goin\xe2\x80\x99 to meddle with the biznai,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBeetle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a gloat for King\xe2\x80\x99s house. Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s quite right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, won\xe2\x80\x99t Stalky, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Stalky puffed out his cheeks and squinted down his nose in the style\r\nof Panurge, and all he said was, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you abject burblers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re three beastly scabs!\xe2\x80\x9d was the instant retort of the democracy,\r\nand they went out amid execrations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is piffling,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get our sallies, and go and\r\nshoot bunnies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree saloon-pistols, with a supply of bulleted breech-caps, were stored\r\nin Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s trunk, and this trunk was in their dormitory, and\r\ntheir dormitory was a three-bed attic one, opening out of a ten-bed\r\nestablishment, which, in turn, communicated with the great range of\r\ndormitories that ran practically from one end of the College to the\r\nother. Macrea\xe2\x80\x99s house lay next to Prout\xe2\x80\x99s, King\xe2\x80\x99s next to Macrea\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nHartopp\xe2\x80\x99s beyond that again. Carefully locked doors divided house from\r\nhouse, but each house, in its internal arrangements--the College had\r\noriginally been a terrace of twelve large houses--was a replica of the\r\nnext; one straight roof covering all.\r\n\r\nThey found Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s bed drawn out from the wall to the left of the\r\ndormer window, and the latter end of Richards protruding from a\r\ntwo-foot-square cupboard in the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s all this? I\xe2\x80\x99ve never noticed it before. What are you tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\ndo, Fatty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFillin\xe2\x80\x99 basins, Muster Corkran.\xe2\x80\x9d Richards\xe2\x80\x99s voice was hollow and\r\nmuffled. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been savin\xe2\x80\x99 me trouble. Yiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Looks like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cHi! You\xe2\x80\x99ll stick if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\ncare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRichards backed puffing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t rache un. Yiss, \xe2\x80\x99tess a turncock, Muster McTurk. They\xe2\x80\x99ve took\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 runned all the watter-pipes a storey higher in the houses--runned\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em all along under the \xe2\x80\x99ang of the heaves, like. Runned \xe2\x80\x99em in last\r\nholidays. _I_ can\xe2\x80\x99t rache the turncock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me try,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, diving into the aperture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlip \xe2\x80\x99ee to the left, then, Muster Corkran. Slip \xe2\x80\x99ee to the left, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfeel in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the left Stalky wriggled, and saw a long line of lead pipe\r\ndisappearing up a triangular tunnel, whose roof was the rafters and\r\nboarding of the college roof, whose floor was sharp-edged joists, and\r\nwhose side was the rough studding of the lath and plaster wall under the\r\ndormer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRummy show. How far does it go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight along, Muster Corkran--right along from end to end. Her runs\r\nunder the \xe2\x80\x99ang of the heaves. Have \xe2\x80\x99ee rached the stopcock yet? Mr. King\r\ngot un put in to save us carryin\xe2\x80\x99 watter from down-stairs to fill the\r\nbasins. No place for a lusty man like old Richards. I\xe2\x80\x99m tu thickabout to\r\ngo ferritin\xe2\x80\x99. Thank \xe2\x80\x99ee, Muster Corkran.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe water squirted through the tap just inside the cupboard, and, having\r\nfilled the basins, the grateful Richards waddled away.\r\n\r\nThe boys sat round-eyed on their beds considering the possibilities of\r\nthis trove. Two floors below them they could hear the hum of the angry\r\nhouse; for nothing is so still as a dormitory in mid-afternoon of a\r\nmidsummer term.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been papered over till now.\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk examined the little door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99d only known before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI vote we go down and explore. No one will come up this time o\xe2\x80\x99 day. We\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t keep _cav\xc3\xa9_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey crawled in, Stalky leading, drew the door behind them, and on all\r\nfours embarked on a dark and dirty road full of plaster, odd shavings,\r\nand all the raffle that builders leave in the waste room of a house.\r\nThe passage was perhaps three feet wide, and, except for the struggling\r\nlight round the edges of the cupboards (there was one to each dormer),\r\nalmost pitchy dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Macrea\xe2\x80\x99s house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, his eye at the crack of the third\r\ncupboard. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see Barnes\xe2\x80\x99s name on his trunk. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make such a row,\r\nBeetle! We can get right to the end of the Coll. Come on!... We\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s house now--I can see a bit of Rattray\xe2\x80\x99s trunk. How these beastly\r\nboards hurt one\xe2\x80\x99s knees!\xe2\x80\x9d They heard his nails scraping, on plaster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the ceiling below. Look out! If we smashed that the plaster \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nfall down in the lower dormitory,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 be collared first thing? Not much. Why, I can shove my hand ever so\r\nfar up between these boards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStalky thrust an arm to the elbow between the joists.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo good stayin\xe2\x80\x99 here. I vote we go back and talk it over. It\xe2\x80\x99s a crummy\r\nplace. \xe2\x80\x99Must say I\xe2\x80\x99m grateful to King for his water-works.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey crawled out, brushed one another clean, slid the saloon-pistols\r\ndown a trouser-leg, and hurried forth to a deep and solitary Devonshire\r\nlane in whose flanks a boy might sometimes slay a young rabbit. They\r\nthrew themselves down under the rank elder bushes, and began to think\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky at last, sighting at a distant sparrow, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\ncould hide our sallies in there like anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle snorted, choked, and gurgled. He had been silent since\r\nthey left the dormitory. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever read a book called \xe2\x80\x98The History\r\nof a House\xe2\x80\x99 or something? I got it out of the library the other day. A\r\nFrench woman wrote it--Violet somebody. But it\xe2\x80\x99s translated, you know;\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s very interestin\xe2\x80\x99. Tells you how a house is built.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you\xe2\x80\x99re in a sweat to find out that, you can go down to the new\r\ncottages they\xe2\x80\x99re building for the coastguard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Hat! I will.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt in his pockets. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me tuppence, some one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRot! Stay here, and don\xe2\x80\x99t mess about in the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGi\xe2\x80\x99 me tuppence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Beetle, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t stuffy about anything, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk,\r\nhanding over the coppers. His tone was serious, for though Stalky often,\r\nand McTurk occasionally, manoeuvred on his own account, Beetle had never\r\nbeen known to do so in all the history of the confederacy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ll come, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, with a general\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion of his\r\naides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, leave him alone. He\xe2\x80\x99s been taken worse with a poem,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll go burbling down to the Pebbleridge and spit it all up in the\r\nstudy when he comes back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did he want the tuppence, Turkey? He\xe2\x80\x99s gettin\xe2\x80\x99 too beastly\r\nindependent. Hi! There\xe2\x80\x99s a bunny. No, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s a cat, by Jove! You\r\nplug first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later a boy with a straw hat at the back of his head, and\r\nhis hands in his pockets, was staring at workmen as they moved about\r\na half-finished cottage. He produced some ferocious tobacco, and\r\nwas passed from the forecourt into the interior, where he asked many\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s have your beastly epic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Turkey, as they burst into\r\nthe study, to find Beetle deep in Viollet-le-Duc and some drawings.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had no end of a lark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEpic? What epic? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been down to the coastguard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo epic? Then we will slay you, O Beetle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, moving to the\r\nattack. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got something up your sleeve. _I_ know, when you talk in\r\nthat tone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Uncle Beetle\xe2\x80\x9d--with an attempt to imitate Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s war-voice--\xe2\x80\x9cis\r\na great man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; he jolly well isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything of the kind. You deceive yourself,\r\nBeetle. Scrag him, Turkey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great man,\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle gurgled from the floor. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ are futile--look\r\nout for my tie!--futile burblers. I am the Great Man. I gloat. Ouch!\r\nHear me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeetle, de-ah\xe2\x80\x9d--Stalky dropped unreservedly on Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s chest--\xe2\x80\x9cwe love\r\nyou, an\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99re a poet. If I ever said you were a doggaroo, I apologize;\r\nbut you know as well as we do that you can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything by yourself\r\nwithout mucking it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a notion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll spoil the whole show if you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell your Uncle Stalky.\r\nCough it up, ducky, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what we can do. Notion, you fat\r\nimpostor--I knew you had a notion when you went away! Turkey said it was\r\na poem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve found out how houses are built. Le\xe2\x80\x99 me get up. The floor-joists of\r\none room are the ceiling-joists of the room below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so filthy technical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the man told me. The floor is laid on top of those joists--those\r\nboards on edge that we crawled over--but the floor stops at a partition.\r\nWell, if you get behind a partition, same as you did in the attic, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see that you can shove anything you please under the floor between\r\nthe floor-boards and the lath and plaster of the ceiling below? Look\r\nhere. I\xe2\x80\x99ve drawn it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe produced a rude sketch, sufficient to enlighten the allies. There is\r\nno part of the modern school curriculum that deals with architecture,\r\nand none of them had yet reflected whether floors and ceilings were\r\nhollow or solid. Outside his own immediate interests the boy is as\r\nignorant as the savage he so admires; but he has also the savage\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresource.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cI shoved my hand there. An\xe2\x80\x99 then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 then.... They\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling us stinkers, you know. We might shove\r\nsomethin\xe2\x80\x99 under--sulphur, or something that stunk pretty bad--an\xe2\x80\x99 stink\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em out. I know it can be done somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned to Stalky\r\nhandling the diagrams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStinks?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky interrogatively. Then his face grew luminous with\r\ndelight. \xe2\x80\x9cBy gum! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it. Horrid stinks! Turkey!\xe2\x80\x9d He leaped at the\r\nIrishman. \xe2\x80\x9cThis afternoon--just after Beetle went away! _She\xe2\x80\x99s_ the very\r\nthing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to my arms, my beamish boy,\xe2\x80\x9d caroled McTurk, and they fell into\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s arms dancing. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, frabjous day! Calloo, callay! She will!\r\nShe will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearr man! It shall, though. Oh, Artie, my pure-souled youth, let us\r\ntell our darling Reggie about Pestiferous Stinkadores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot until after call-over. Come on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orrin, stiffly, as they fell into their places along the\r\nwalls of the gymnasium. \xe2\x80\x9cThe house are goin\xe2\x80\x99 to hold another meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold away, then.\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s mind was elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about you three this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, give \xe2\x80\x99em my love... _Here, sir_,\xe2\x80\x9d and he tore down the\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\nGamboling like kids at play, with bounds and sidestarts, with caperings\r\nand curvetings, they led the almost bursting Beetle to the rabbit-lane,\r\nand from under a pile of stones drew forth the new-slain corpse of a\r\ncat. Then did Beetle see the inner meaning of what had gone before, and\r\nlifted up his voice in thanksgiving for that the world held warriors so\r\nwise as Stalky and McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell-nourished old lady, ain\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long d\xe2\x80\x99you\r\nsuppose it\xe2\x80\x99ll take her to get a bit whiff in a confined space?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBit whiff! What a coarse brute you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t a poor\r\npussy-cat get under King\xe2\x80\x99s dormitory floor to die without your pursuin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nher with your foul innuendoes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she die under the floor for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, looking to the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they won\xe2\x80\x99t worry about _that_ when they find her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cat may look at a king.\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk rolled down the bank at his own\r\njest. \xe2\x80\x9cPussy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how useful you\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be to three\r\npure-souled, high-minded boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take up the floor for her, same as they did in Number\r\nNine when the rat croaked. Big medicine--heap big medicine! Phew! Oh,\r\nLord, I wish I could stop laughin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStinks! Hi, stinks! Clammy ones!\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk gasped as he regained his\r\nplace. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x9d--the exquisite humor of it brought them sliding down\r\ntogether in a tangle--\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all for the honor of the house, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99re holdin\xe2\x80\x99 another meeting--on us,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky panted, his knees\r\nin the ditch and his face in the long grass. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s get the bullet\r\nout of her and hurry up. The sooner she\xe2\x80\x99s bedded out the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetween them they did some grisly work with a penknife; between them\r\n(ask not who buttoned her to his bosom) they took up the corpse and\r\nhastened back, Stalky arranging their plan of action at the full trot.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon sun, lying in broad patches on the bed-rugs, saw three\r\nboys and an umbrella disappear into a dormitory wall. In five minutes\r\nthey emerged, brushed themselves all over, washed their hands, combed\r\ntheir hair, and descended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you shoved her far enough under?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it, man, I shoved her the full length of my arm and Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrolly. That must be about six feet. She\xe2\x80\x99s bung in the middle of King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbig upper ten-bedder. Eligible central situation, _I_ call it. She\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstink out his chaps, and Hartopp\xe2\x80\x99s and Macrea\xe2\x80\x99s, when she really begins\r\nto fume. I swear your Uncle Stalky is a great man. Do you realize what a\r\ngreat man he is, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I had the notion first, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I--? only--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it without your Uncle Stalky, could you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling us stinkers for a week now,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\n_won\xe2\x80\x99t_ they catch it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStinker! Yah! Stink-ah!\xe2\x80\x9d rang down the corridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she\xe2\x80\x99s there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, a hand on either boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe--is--there, gettin\xe2\x80\x99 ready to surprise \xe2\x80\x99em. Presently she\xe2\x80\x99ll begin\r\nto whisper to \xe2\x80\x99em in their dreams. Then she\xe2\x80\x99ll whiff. Golly, how she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwhiff! Oblige me by thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 of it for two minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went to their study in more or less of silence. There they began to\r\nlaugh--laugh as only boys can. They laughed with their foreheads on the\r\ntables, or on the floor; laughed at length, curled over the backs of\r\nchairs or clinging to a book-shelf; laughed themselves limp.\r\n\r\nAnd in the middle of it Orrin entered on behalf of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind us, Orrin; sit down. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how we respect and admire you.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s something about your pure, high young forehead, full of the\r\ndreams of innocent boyhood, that\xe2\x80\x99s no end fetchin\xe2\x80\x99. It is, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house sent me to give you this.\xe2\x80\x9d He laid a folded sheet of paper on\r\nthe table and retired with an awful front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the resolution! Oh, read it, some one. I\xe2\x80\x99m too silly-sick\r\nwith laughin\xe2\x80\x99 to see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. Stalky jerked it open with a\r\nprecautionary sniff. \xe2\x80\x9cPhew! Phew! Listen. \xe2\x80\x98_The house notices with pain\r\nand contempt the attitude of indiference_\xe2\x80\x99--how many f\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nindifference, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo for choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one here--\xe2\x80\x98_adopted by the occupants of Number Five study in\r\nrelation to the insults offered to Mr. Prout\xe2\x80\x99s house at the recent\r\nmeeting in Number Twelve form-room, and the House hereby pass a\r\nvote of censure on the said study._\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she bled all down my shirt, too!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m catty all over,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I washed twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I nearly broke Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s brolly plantin\xe2\x80\x99 her where she would\r\nblossom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe situation was beyond speech, but not laughter. There was some\r\nattempt that night to demonstrate against the three in their dormitory;\r\nso they came forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle began suavely as he loosened his braces, \xe2\x80\x9cthe trouble\r\nwith you is that you\xe2\x80\x99re a set of unthinkin\xe2\x80\x99 asses. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no more brains\r\nthan spidgers. We\xe2\x80\x99ve told you that heaps of times, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll give the three of you a dormitory lickin\xe2\x80\x99. You always jaw at us\r\nas if you were prefects,\xe2\x80\x9d cried one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, you won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you know that if you did\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d get the worst of it sooner or later. _We_ aren\xe2\x80\x99t in any hurry.\r\n_We_ can afford to wait for our little revenges. You\xe2\x80\x99ve made howlin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nasses of yourselves, and just as soon as King gets hold of your\r\nprecious resolutions to-morrow you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that out. If you aren\xe2\x80\x99t sick\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 sorry by to-morrow night, I\xe2\x80\x99ll--I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat my hat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut or ever the dinner-bell rang the next day Prout\xe2\x80\x99s were sadly aware\r\nof their error. King received stray members of that house with an\r\nexaggerated attitude of fear. Did they purpose to cause him to be\r\ndismissed from the College by unanimous resolution? What were their\r\nviews concerning the government of the school, that he might hasten\r\nto give effect to them? he would not offend them for worlds; but\r\nhe feared--he sadly feared--that his own house, who did not pass\r\nresolutions (but washed), might somewhat deride.\r\n\r\nKing was a happy man, and his house, basking in the favor of his smile,\r\nmade that afternoon a long penance to the misled Prouts. And Prout\r\nhimself, with a dull and lowering visage, tried to think out the rights\r\nand wrongs of it all, only plunging deeper into bewilderment. Why should\r\nhis house be called \xe2\x80\x9cStinkers\xe2\x80\x9d? Truly, it was a small thing, but he had\r\nbeen trained to believe that straws show which way the wind blows, and\r\nthat there is no smoke without fire. He approached King in Common-room\r\nwith a sense of injustice, but King was pleased to be full of airy\r\npersiflage that tide, and brilliantly danced dialectical rings round\r\nProut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky at bedtime, making pilgrimage through the dormitories\r\nbefore the prefects came by, \xe2\x80\x9c_now_ what have you got to say for\r\nyourselves? Foster, Carton, Finch, Longbridge, Marlin, Brett! I heard\r\nyou chaps catchin\xe2\x80\x99 it from King--he made hay of you--an\xe2\x80\x99 all you could\r\ndo was to wriggle an\xe2\x80\x99 grin an\xe2\x80\x99 say, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Please, sir\xe2\x80\x99! You an\xe2\x80\x99 your resolution! Urh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shut up, Stalky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it. You\xe2\x80\x99re a gaudy lot of resolutionists, you are! You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmade a sweet mess of it. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the decency to leave us\r\nalone next time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the house grew angry, and in many voices pointed out how this\r\nblunder would never have come to pass if Number Five study had helped\r\nthem from the first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you chaps are so beastly conceited, an\xe2\x80\x99--an\xe2\x80\x99 you swaggered into\r\nthe meetin\xe2\x80\x99 as if we were a lot of idiots,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Orrin of the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s precisely what you _are_! That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nhammer into your thick heads all this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive you. Cheer up. You can\xe2\x80\x99t help bein\xe2\x80\x99 asses, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand, the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s flank deftly turned, Stalky hopped into bed.\r\n\r\nThat night was the first of sorrow among the jubilant King\xe2\x80\x99s. By some\r\naccident of under-floor drafts the cat did not vex the dormitory beneath\r\nwhich she lay, but the next one to the right; stealing on the air rather\r\nas a pale-blue sensation than as any poignant offense. But the mere\r\nadumbration of an odor is enough for the sensitive nose and clean tongue\r\nof youth. Decency demands that we draw several carbolized sheets over\r\nwhat the dormitory said to Mr. King and what Mr. King replied. He was\r\ngenuinely proud of his house and fastidious in all that concerned their\r\nwell-being. He came; he sniffed; he said things. Next morning a boy in\r\nthat dormitory confided to his bosom friend, a fag of Macrea\xe2\x80\x99s, that\r\nthere was trouble in their midst which King would fain keep secret.\r\n\r\nBut Macrea\xe2\x80\x99s boy had also a bosom friend in Prout\xe2\x80\x99s, a shock-headed\r\nfag of malignant disposition, who, when he had wormed out the secret,\r\ntold--told it in a high-pitched treble that rang along the corridor like\r\na bat\xe2\x80\x99s squeak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99--an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling us \xe2\x80\x98stinkers\xe2\x80\x99 all this week. Why, Harland\r\nminor says they simply can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep in his dormitory for the stink. Come\r\non!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith one shout and with one cry\xe2\x80\x9d Prout\xe2\x80\x99s juniors hurled themselves into\r\nthe war, and through the interval between first and second lesson some\r\nfifty twelve-year-olds were embroiled on the gravel outside King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwindows to a tune whose _leit-motif_ was the word \xe2\x80\x9cstinker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark to the minute-gun at sea!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. They were in their study\r\ncollecting books for second lesson--Latin, with King. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought his\r\nazure brow was a bit cloudy at prayers. \xe2\x80\x98She is comin\xe2\x80\x99, sister Mary. She\r\nis--\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they make such a row now, what _will_ they do when she really begins\r\nto look up an\xe2\x80\x99 take notice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no vulgar repartee, Beetle. All we want is to keep out of this\r\nrow like gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis but a little faded flower.\xe2\x80\x99 Where\xe2\x80\x99s my Horace? Look here, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand what she means by stinkin\xe2\x80\x99 out Rattray\xe2\x80\x99s dormitory first. We\r\nholed in under White\xe2\x80\x99s, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d asked McTurk, with a wrinkled brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSkittish little thing. She\xe2\x80\x99s rompin\xe2\x80\x99 about all over the place, I\r\nsuppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Aunt! King\xe2\x80\x99ll be a cheerful customer at second lesson. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nprepared my Horace one little bit, either,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were outside the form-room door now. It was within five minutes of\r\nthe bell, and King might arrive at any moment.\r\n\r\nTurkey elbowed into a cohort of scuffling fags, cut out Thornton tertius\r\n(he that had been Harland\xe2\x80\x99s bosom friend), and bade him tell his tale.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple one, interrupted by tears. Many of King\xe2\x80\x99s house had\r\nalready battered him for libel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says that King\xe2\x80\x99s house stinks.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStale!\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cWe knew that years ago, only we didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nchoose to run about shoutin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98stinker.\xe2\x80\x99 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got some manners, if they\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t. Catch a fag, Turkey, and make sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurkey\xe2\x80\x99s long arm closed on a hurried and anxious ornament of the Lower\r\nSecond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, McTurk, please let me go. I don\xe2\x80\x99t stink--I swear I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuilty conscience!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cWho said you did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you make of it?\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky punted the small boy into Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSnf! Snf! He does, though. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s leprosy--or thrush. P\xe2\x80\x99raps it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboth. Take it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Master Beetle\xe2\x80\x9d--King generally came to the house-door for a\r\nminute or two as the bell rang--\xe2\x80\x9cwe are vastly indebted to you for your\r\ndiagnosis, which seems to reflect almost as much credit on the natural\r\nunwholesomeness of your mind as it does upon your pitiful ignorance of\r\nthe diseases of which you discourse so glibly. We will, however, test\r\nyour knowledge in other directions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was a merry lesson, but, in his haste to scarify Beetle, King\r\nclean neglected to give him an imposition, and since at the same time\r\nhe supplied him with many priceless adjectives for later use, Beetle was\r\nwell content, and applied himself most seriously throughout third\r\nlesson (algebra with little Hartopp) to composing a poem entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nLazar-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter dinner King took his house to bathe in the sea off the\r\nPebbleridge. It was an old promise; but he wished he could have evaded\r\nit, for all Prout\xe2\x80\x99s lined up by the Fives Court and cheered with\r\nintention. In his absence not less than half the school invaded the\r\ninfected dormitory to draw their own conclusions. The cat had gained in\r\nthe last twelve hours, but a battlefield of the fifth day could not have\r\nbeen so flamboyant as the spies reported.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word, she _is_ doin\xe2\x80\x99 herself proud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever\r\nsmell anything like it? Ah, an\xe2\x80\x99 she isn\xe2\x80\x99t under White\xe2\x80\x99s dormitory at all\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she will be. Give her time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll twine like\r\na giddy honeysuckle. What howlin\xe2\x80\x99 Lazarites they are! No house is\r\njustified in makin\xe2\x80\x99 itself a stench in the nostrils of decent--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh-minded, pure-souled boys. _Do_ you burn with remorse and regret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid McTurk, as they hastened to meet the house coming up from the sea.\r\nKing had deserted it, so speech was unfettered. Round its front played\r\na crowd of skirmishers--all houses mixed--flying, reforming, shrieking\r\ninsults. On its tortured flanks marched the Hoplites, seniors hurling\r\njests one after another--simple and primitive jests of the Stone Age.\r\nTo these the three added themselves, dispassionately, with an air of\r\naloofness, almost sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they look all right, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be Rattray, can\r\nit? Rattray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRattray, dear? He seems stuffy about something or other. Look here, old\r\nman, we don\xe2\x80\x99t bear any malice about your sending that soap to us last\r\nweek, do we? Be cheerful, Rat. You can live this down all right. I dare\r\nsay it\xe2\x80\x99s only a few fags. Your house is so beastly slack, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou aren\xe2\x80\x99t going back to the house, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. The victims\r\ndesired nothing better. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve simply no conception of the reek up\r\nthere. Of course, frowzin\xe2\x80\x99 as you do, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t notice it; but, after\r\nthis nice wash and the clean, fresh air, even _you\xe2\x80\x99d_ be upset. \xe2\x80\x98Much\r\nbetter camp on the Burrows. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get you some straw. Shall we?\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nhouse hurried in to the tune of \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Brown\xe2\x80\x99s body,\xe2\x80\x9d sung by loving\r\nschoolmates, and barricaded themselves in their form-room. Straightway\r\nStalky chalked a large cross, with \xe2\x80\x9cLord, have mercy upon us,\xe2\x80\x9d on the\r\ndoor, and left King to find it.\r\n\r\nThe wind shifted that night and wafted a carrion-reek into Macrea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndormitories; so that boys in nightgowns pounded on the locked door\r\nbetween the houses, entreating King\xe2\x80\x99s to wash. Number Five study went to\r\nsecond lesson with not more than half a pound of camphor apiece in their\r\nclothing; and King, too wary to ask for explanations, gibbered a while\r\nand hurled them forth. So Beetle finished yet another poem at peace in\r\nthe study.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re usin\xe2\x80\x99 carbolic now. Malpas told me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cKing thinks\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the drains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll need a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 carbolic,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cNo harm tryin\xe2\x80\x99, I\r\nsuppose. It keeps King out of mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear I thought he was goin\xe2\x80\x99 to kill me when I sniffed just now. He\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mind Burton major sniffin\xe2\x80\x99 at me the other day, though. He never\r\nstopped Alexander howlin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Stinker!\xe2\x80\x99 into our form-room before--before\r\nwe doctored \xe2\x80\x99em. He just grinned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was he frothing\r\nover you for, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! That, was my subtle jape. I had him on toast. You know he always\r\njaws about the learned Lipsius.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Who at the age of four\xe2\x80\x99--_that_ chap?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Whenever he hears I\xe2\x80\x99ve written a poem. Well, just as I was sittin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndown, I whispered, \xe2\x80\x98How is our learned Lepsius?\xe2\x80\x99 to Burton major. Old\r\nButt grinned like an owl. _He_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what I was drivin\xe2\x80\x99 at; but\r\nKing jolly well did. That was really why he hove us out. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ngrateful? Now shut up. I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to write the \xe2\x80\x98Ballad of the Learned\r\nLipsius.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep clear of anything coarse, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nbe coarse on this happy occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for wo-orlds. What rhymes to \xe2\x80\x98stenches,\xe2\x80\x99 someone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn Common-room at lunch King discoursed acridly to Prout of boys with\r\nprurient minds, who perverted their few and baleful talents to sap\r\ndiscipline and corrupt their equals, to deal in foul imagery and destroy\r\nreverence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to consider this when your house called\r\nus--ah--stinkers. If you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t assured me that you never interfere with\r\nanother man\xe2\x80\x99s house, I should almost believe that it was a few casual\r\nremarks of yours that started all this nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProut had endured much, for King always took his temper to meals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spoke to Beetle yourself, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? Something about not bathing,\r\nand being a water-funk?\xe2\x80\x9d the school chaplain put in. \xe2\x80\x9cI was scoring in\r\nthe pavilion that day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may have--jestingly. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to remember every remark\r\nI let fall among small boys; and full well I know the Beetle has no\r\nfeelings to be hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay be; but he, or they--it comes to to same thing--have the fiend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown knack of discovering a man\xe2\x80\x99s weak place. I confess I rather go out\r\nof my way to conciliate Number Five study. It may be soft, but so far,\r\nI believe, I am the only man here whom they haven\xe2\x80\x99t maddened by\r\ntheir--well--attentions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all beside the point. I flatter myself I can deal with them\r\nalone as occasion arises. But if they feel themselves morally supported\r\nby those who should wield an absolute and open-handed justice, then I\r\nsay that my lot is indeed a hard one. Of all things I detest, I admit\r\nthat anything verging on disloyalty among ourselves is the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Common-room looked at one another out of the corners of their eyes,\r\nand Prout blushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI deny it absolutely,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEr--in fact, I own that I personally\r\nobject to all three of them. It is not fair, therefore, to--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long do you propose to allow it?\xe2\x80\x9d said King.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macrea, deserting his usual ally, \xe2\x80\x9cthe blame, if\r\nthere be any, rests with you, King. You can\xe2\x80\x99t hold them responsible\r\nfor the--you prefer the good old Anglo-Saxon, I believe--stink in your\r\nhouse. My boys are complaining of it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you expect? You know what boys are. Naturally they take\r\nadvantage of what to them is a heaven-sent opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d said little\r\nHartopp. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ the trouble in your dormitories, King?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. King explained that as he had made it the one rule of his life never\r\nto interfere with another man\xe2\x80\x99s house, so he expected not to be too\r\npatently interfered with. They might be interested to learn--here the\r\nchaplain heaved a weary sigh--that he had taken all steps that, in his\r\npoor judgment, would meet the needs of the case. Nay, further, he had\r\nhimself expended, with no thought of reimbursement, sums, the amount of\r\nwhich he would not specify, on disinfectants. This he had done because\r\nhe knew by bitter--by most bitter--experience that the management of the\r\ncollege was slack, dilatory, and inefficient. He might even add, almost\r\nas slack as the administration of certain houses which now thought\r\nfit to sit in judgment on his actions. With a short summary of his\r\nscholastic career, and a precis of his qualifications, including his\r\ndegrees, he withdrew, slamming the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeigho!\xe2\x80\x9d said the chaplain. \xe2\x80\x9cOurs is a dwarfing life--a belittling\r\nlife, my brethren. God help all schoolmasters! They need it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the boys, I own\xe2\x80\x9d--Prout dug viciously with his fork into\r\nthe table-cloth--\xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be a strong man, as you know.\r\nBut I confess I can\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason why I should take steps against\r\nStalky and the others because King happens to be annoyed by--by--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFalling into the pit he has digged,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Hartopp. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\r\nnot, Prout. No one accuses you of setting one house against another\r\nthrough sheer idleness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA belittling life--a belittling life.\xe2\x80\x9d The chaplain rose. \xe2\x80\x9cI go to\r\ncorrect French exercises. By dinner King will have scored off some\r\nunlucky child of thirteen; he will repeat to us every word of his\r\nbrilliant repartees, and all will be well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut about those three. Are they so prurient-minded?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Hartopp. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you thought for a minute, Prout,\r\nyou would see that the \xe2\x80\x98precocious flow of fetid imagery,\xe2\x80\x99 that King\r\ncomplains of, is borrowed wholesale from King. _He_ \xe2\x80\x99nursed the pinion\r\nthat impelled the steel.\xe2\x80\x99 Naturally he does not approve. Come into the\r\nsmoking-room for a minute. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair to listen to boys; but they\r\nshould be now rubbing it into King\xe2\x80\x99s house outside. Little things please\r\nlittle minds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dingy den off the Common-room was never used for anything except\r\ngowns. Its windows were ground glass; one could not see out of it, but\r\none could hear almost every word on the gravel outside. A light and wary\r\nfootstep came up from Number Five.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRattray!\xe2\x80\x9d in a subdued voice--Rattray\xe2\x80\x99s study fronted that way. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you\r\nknow if Mr. King\xe2\x80\x99s anywhere about? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a--\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk discreetly left\r\nthe end of the sentence open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rattray unguardedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! The learned Lipsius is airing himself, is he? His Royal Highness\r\nhas gone to fumigate.\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk climbed on the railings, where he held\r\nforth like the never-wearied rook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow in all the Coll. there was no stink like the stink of King\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nfor it stank vehemently and none knew what to make of it. Save King. And\r\nhe washed the fags _privatim et seriatim_. In the fishpools of Hesbon\r\nwashed he them, with an apron about his loins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up, you mad Irishman!\xe2\x80\x9d There was the sound of a golf-ball spurting\r\nup gravel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good getting wrathy, Rattray. We\xe2\x80\x99ve come to jape with you. Come\r\non, Beetle. They\xe2\x80\x99re all at home. You can wind \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the Pomposo Stinkadore? \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t safe for a pure-souled,\r\nhigh-minded boy to be seen round his house these days. Gone out, has he?\r\nNever mind. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the best I can, Rattray. I\xe2\x80\x99m _in loco parentis_ just\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cOne for you, Prout,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Macrea, for this was Mr. Prout\xe2\x80\x99s pet\r\nphrase.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a few words to impart to you, my young friend. We will discourse\r\ntogether a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the listening Prout sputtered: Beetle, in a strained voice, had\r\nchosen a favorite gambit of King\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI repeat, Master Rattray, we will confer, and the matter of our\r\ndiscourse shall not be stinks, for that is a loathsome and obscene\r\nword. We will, with your good leave--granted, I trust, Master Rattray,\r\ngranted, I trust--study this--this scabrous upheaval of latent\r\ndemoralization. What impresses me most is not so much the blatant\r\nindecency with which you swagger abroad under your load of putrescence\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (you must imagine this discourse punctuated with golf-balls, but old\r\nRattray was ever a bad shot) \xe2\x80\x9cas the cynical immorality with which you\r\nrevel in your abhorrent aromas. Far be it from me to interfere with\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s house--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this _is_ King.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLine for line, letter for letter; listen;\xe2\x80\x9d said little Hartopp.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to say that you stink, as certain lewd fellows of the baser sort\r\naver, is to say nothing--less than nothing. In the absence of your\r\nbeloved house-master, for whom no one has a higher regard than myself,\r\nI will, if you will allow me, explain the grossness--the unparalleled\r\nenormity--the appalling fetor of the stenches (I believe in the good old\r\nAnglo-Saxon word), stenches, sir, with which you have seen fit to infect\r\nyour house... Oh, bother! I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten the rest, but it was very\r\nbeautiful. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you grateful to us for laborin\xe2\x80\x99 with you this way,\r\nRattray? Lots of chaps \xe2\x80\x99ud never have taken the trouble, but we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngrateful, Rattray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99re horrid grateful,\xe2\x80\x9d grunted McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that\r\nsoap. We\xe2\x80\x99re polite. Why ain\xe2\x80\x99t you polite, Rat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo!\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky cantered up, his cap over one eye. \xe2\x80\x9cExhortin\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nWhiffers, eh? I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid they\xe2\x80\x99re too far gone to repent. Rattray!\r\nWhite! Perowne! Malpas! No answer. This is distressin\xe2\x80\x99. This is truly\r\ndistressin\xe2\x80\x99. Bring out your dead, you glandered lepers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think yourself funny, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rattray, stung from his\r\ndignity by this last. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only a rat or something under the floor.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to have it up to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to shuffle it off on a poor dumb animal, and dead, too. I\r\nloathe prevarication. \xe2\x80\x99Pon my soul, Rattray--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on. The Hartoffles never said \xe2\x80\x99Pon my soul\xe2\x80\x99 in all his little\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle critically.\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout to little Hartopp.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, sir, upon my word, sir, I expected better things of you,\r\nRattray. Why can you not own up to your misdeeds like a man? Have _I_\r\never shown any lack of confidence in _you_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not brutality,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured little Hartopp, as though answering a\r\nquestion no one had asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s boy; only boy.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this was the house,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky changed from a pecking, fluttering\r\nvoice to tragic earnestness. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was the--the--open cesspit that dared\r\nto call us \xe2\x80\x98stinkers.\xe2\x80\x99 And now--and now, it tries to shelter itself\r\nbehind a dead rat. You annoy me, Rattray. You disgust me! You irritate\r\nme unspeakably! Thank Heaven, I am a man of equable temper--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cThis is to your address, Macrea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear so, I fear so.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr I should scarcely be able to contain myself before your mocking\r\nvisage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Cav\xc3\xa9_!\xe2\x80\x9d in an undertone. Beetle had spied King sailing down the\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what may you be doing here, my little friends?\xe2\x80\x9d the house-master\r\nbegan. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a fleeting notion--correct me if I am wrong\xe2\x80\x9d (the\r\nlisteners with one accord choked)--\xe2\x80\x9cthat if I found you outside my house\r\nI should visit you with dire pains and penalties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were just goin\xe2\x80\x99 for a walk, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you stopped to speak to Rattray _en route_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been throwing golf-balls,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rattray, coming out of\r\nthe study.\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cOld Rat is more of a diplomat than I thought. So far he is strictly\r\nwithin the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Hartopp. \xe2\x80\x9cObserve the ethics of it,\r\nProut.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you were sporting with them, were you? I must say I do not envy\r\nyou your choice of associates. I fancied they might have been engaged in\r\nsome of the prurient discourse with which they have been so disgustingly\r\nfree of late. I should strongly advise you to direct your steps most\r\ncarefully in the future. Pick up those golf-balls.\xe2\x80\x9d He passed on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext day Richards, who had been a carpenter in the Navy, and to whom odd\r\njobs were confided, was ordered to take up a dormitory floor; for Mr.\r\nKing held that something must have died there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need not neglect all our work for a trumpery incident of this\r\nnature; though I am quite aware that little things please little\r\nminds. Yes, I have decreed the boards to be taken up after lunch under\r\nRichards\xe2\x80\x99s auspices. I have no doubt it will be vastly interesting to\r\na certain type of so-called intellect; but any boy of my house or\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s found on the dormitory stairs will _ipso facto_ render himself\r\nliable to three hundred lines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys did not collect on the stairs, but most of them waited outside\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s. Richards had been bound to cry the news from the attic window,\r\nand, if possible, to exhibit the corpse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a cat, a dead cat!\xe2\x80\x9d Richards\xe2\x80\x99s face showed purple at the window.\r\nHe had been in the chamber of death and on his knees for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCat be blowed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dead fag left over from last\r\nterm. Three cheers for King\xe2\x80\x99s dead fag!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey cheered lustily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow it, show it! Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a squint at it!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled the juniors. \xe2\x80\x9cGive\r\nher to the Bug-hunters.\xe2\x80\x9d (This was the Natural History Society). \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ncat looked at the King--and died of it! Hoosh! Yai! Yaow! Maiow! Ftzz!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n were some of the cries that followed.\r\n\r\nAgain Richards appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ve been\xe2\x80\x9d--he checked himself suddenly--\xe2\x80\x9cdead a long taime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe school roared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, come on out for a walk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky in a well-chosen pause.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very disgustin\xe2\x80\x99, and I do hope the Lazar-house won\xe2\x80\x99t do it\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what?\xe2\x80\x9d a King\xe2\x80\x99s boy cried furiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKill a poor innocent cat every time you want to get off washing. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nawfully hard to distinguish between you as it is. I prefer the cat, I\r\nmust say. She isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite so whiff. What are you goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Je vais gloater. Je vais gloater tout le_ blessed afternoon. _Jamais\r\nj\xe2\x80\x99ai gloat\xc3\xa9 comme je gloaterai aujourd\xe2\x80\x99hui. Nous bunkerons aux_\r\nbunkers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed good to them so to do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDown in the basement, where the gas flickers and the boots stand in\r\nracks, Richards, amid his blacking-brushes, held forth to Oke of the\r\nCommon-room, Gumbly of the dining-halls, and fair Lena of the laundry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYiss. Her were in a shockin\xe2\x80\x99 staate an\xe2\x80\x99 condition. Her nigh made me\r\nsick, I tal \xe2\x80\x99ee. But I rowted un out, and I rowted un out, an\xe2\x80\x99 I made\r\nall shipshape, though her smelt like to bilges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer died mousin\xe2\x80\x99, I reckon, poor thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen her moused different to any made cat o\xe2\x80\x99 God\xe2\x80\x99s world, Lena. I up\r\nwith the top-board, an\xe2\x80\x99 she were lying on her back, an\xe2\x80\x99 I turned un\r\novver with the brume-handle, an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99twas her back was all covered with\r\nthe plaster from \xe2\x80\x99twixt the lathin\xe2\x80\x99. Yiss, I tal \xe2\x80\x99ee. An\xe2\x80\x99 under her\r\nhead there lay, like, so\xe2\x80\x99s to say, a little pillow o\xe2\x80\x99 plaster druv up\r\nin front of her by raison of her slidin\xe2\x80\x99 along on her back. No cat niver\r\nwent mousin\xe2\x80\x99 on her back, Lena. Some one had shoved her along right\r\nunderneath, so far as they could shove un. Cats don\xe2\x80\x99t make theyselves\r\npillows for to die on. Shoved along, she were, when she was settin\xe2\x80\x99 for\r\nto be cold, laike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yeou\xe2\x80\x99m too clever to live, Fatty. Yeou go get wed an\xe2\x80\x99 taught some\r\nsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lena, the affianced of Gumbly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLarned a little \xe2\x80\x99fore iver some maidens was born. Sarved in the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nNavy, I have, where yeou\xe2\x80\x99m taught to use your eyes. Yeou go \xe2\x80\x99tend your\r\nown business, Lena.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo \xe2\x80\x99ee mean what you\xe2\x80\x99m been tellin\xe2\x80\x99 us?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk me no questions, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give \xe2\x80\x99ee no lies. Bullet-hole clane thru from\r\nside to side, an\xe2\x80\x99 tu heart-ribs broke like withies. I seed un when I\r\nturned un ovver. They\xe2\x80\x99re clever, oh, they\xe2\x80\x99m clever, but they\xe2\x80\x99m not too\r\nclever for old Richards! \xe2\x80\x99Twas on the born tip o\xe2\x80\x99 my tongue to tell,\r\ntu, but... he said us niver washed, he did. Let his dom boys call us\r\n\xe2\x80\x98stinkers,\xe2\x80\x99 he did. Sarve un dom well raight, I say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRichards spat on a fresh boot and fell to his work, chuckling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPRESSIONISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had dropped into the chaplain\xe2\x80\x99s study for a Saturday night\r\nsmoke---all four house-masters--and the three briars and the one cigar\r\nreeking in amity proved the Rev. John Gillett\xe2\x80\x99s good generalship. Since\r\nthe discovery of the cat, King had been too ready to see affront\r\nwhere none was meant, and the Reverend John, buffer-state and general\r\nconfidant, had worked for a week to bring about a good understanding.\r\nHe was fat, clean-shaven, except for a big mustache, of an imperturbable\r\ngood temper, and, those who loved him least said, a guileful Jesuit.\r\nHe smiled benignantly upon his handiwork--four sorely tried men talking\r\nwithout very much malice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow remember,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when the conversation turned that way, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nimpute nothing. But every time that any one has taken direct steps\r\nagainst Number Five study, the issue has been more or less humiliating\r\nto the taker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t admit that. I pulverize the egregious Beetle daily for his\r\nsoul\xe2\x80\x99s good; and the others with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said King.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, take your own case, King, and go back a couple of years. Do\r\nyou remember when Prout and you were on their track for--hutting and\r\ntrespass, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Have you forgotten Colonel Dabney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others laughed. King did not care to be reminded of his career as a\r\npoacher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was one instance. Again, when you had rooms below them--I always\r\nsaid that that was entering the lion\xe2\x80\x99s den--you turned them out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor making disgusting noises. Surely, Gillett, you don\xe2\x80\x99t excuse--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I say is that you turned them out. That same evening your study was\r\nwrecked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Rabbits-Eggs--most beastly drunk--from the road,\xe2\x80\x9d said King. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhas that--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Reverend John went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLastly, they conceive that aspersions are cast upon their personal\r\ncleanliness--a most delicate matter with all boys. Ve-ry good. Observe\r\nhow, in each case, the punishment fits the crime. A week after your\r\nhouse calls them \xe2\x80\x98stinkers,\xe2\x80\x99 King, your house is, not to put too fine a\r\npoint on it, stunk out by a dead cat who chooses to die in the one\r\nspot where she can annoy you most. Again the long arm of coincidence!\r\n_Summa_. You accuse them of trespass. Through some absurd chain of\r\ncircumstances--they may or may not be at the other end of it--you and\r\nProut are made to appear as trespassers. You evict them. For a time your\r\nstudy is made untenable. I have drawn the parallel in the last case.\r\nWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was under the centre of White\xe2\x80\x99s dormitory,\xe2\x80\x9d said King. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are\r\ndouble floor-boards there to deaden noise. No boy, even in my own house,\r\ncould possibly have pried up the boards without leaving some trace--and\r\nRabbits-Eggs was phenomenally drunk that other night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are singularly favored by fortune. That is all I ever said.\r\nPersonally, I like them immensely, and I believe I have a little of\r\ntheir confidence. I confess I like being called \xe2\x80\x98Padre.\xe2\x80\x99 They are at\r\npeace with me; consequently I am not treated to bogus confessions of\r\ntheft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean Mason\xe2\x80\x99s case?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cThat always struck me\r\nas peculiarly scandalous. I thought the Head should have taken up the\r\nmatter more thoroughly. Mason may be misguided, but at least he is\r\nthoroughly sincere and means well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess I cannot agree with you, Prout,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend John. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\njumped at some silly tale of theft on their part; accepted another boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevidence without, so far as I can see, any inquiry; and--frankly, I\r\nthink he deserved all he got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey deliberately outraged Mason\xe2\x80\x99s best feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout. \xe2\x80\x9cA word\r\nto me on their part would have saved the whole thing. But they preferred\r\nto lure him on; to play on his ignorance of their characters--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said King, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like Mason. I dislike him for the\r\nvery reason that Prout advances to his credit. He means well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur criminal tradition is not theft--among ourselves, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nlittle Hartopp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the head of a house that raided seven head of cattle from the\r\ninnocent pot-wallopers of Northam, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that rather a sweeping\r\nstatement?\xe2\x80\x9d said Macrea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hartopp, unabashed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat, with gate-lifting, and a\r\nlittle poaching and hawk-hunting on the cliffs, is our salvation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does us far more harm as a school--\xe2\x80\x9d Prout began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThan any hushed-up scandal could? Quite so. Our reputation among the\r\nfarmers is most unsavory. But I would much sooner deal with any amount\r\nof ingenious crime of that nature than--some other offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey may be all right, but they are unboylike, abnormal, and, in\r\nmy opinion, unsound,\xe2\x80\x9d Prout insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe moral effect of their\r\nperformances must pave the way for greater harm. It makes me doubtful\r\nhow to deal with them. I might separate them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might, of course; but they have gone up the school together for six\r\nyears. _I_ shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macrea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey use the editorial \xe2\x80\x98we,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said King, irrelevantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt annoys me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s your prose, Corkran?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well, sir, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite done it\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it in a minute,\xe2\x80\x99 and so on. And the same with the\r\nothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s great virtue in that \xe2\x80\x98we,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said little Hartopp. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I\r\ntake them for trig. McTurk may have some conception of the meaning of\r\nit; but Beetle is as the brutes that perish about sines and cosines. He\r\ncopies serenely from Stalky, who positively rejoices in mathematics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you stop it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt rights itself at the exams. Then Beetle shows up blank sheets, and\r\ntrusts to his \xe2\x80\x98English\xe2\x80\x99 to save him from a fall. I fancy he spends most\r\nof his time with me in writing verse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to Heaven he would transfer a little of his energy in that\r\ndirection to Elegiacs.\xe2\x80\x9d King jerked himself upright. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is, with the\r\nsingle exception of Stalky, the very vilest manufacturer of \xe2\x80\x98barbarous\r\nhexameters\xe2\x80\x99 that I have ever dealt with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe work is combined in that study,\xe2\x80\x9d said the chaplain. \xe2\x80\x9cStalky does\r\nthe mathematics, McTurk the Latin, and Beetle attends to their English\r\nand French. At least, when he was in the sick-house last month--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMalingering,\xe2\x80\x9d Prout interjected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite possibly. I found a very distinct falling off in their \xe2\x80\x98Roman\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99un Jeune Homme Pauvre\xe2\x80\x99 translations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is profoundly immoral,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always been\r\nopposed to the study system.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be hard to find any study where the boys don\xe2\x80\x99t help each\r\nother; but in Number Five the thing has probably been reduced to a\r\nsystem,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Hartopp. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have a system in most things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey confess as much,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend John. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen McTurk being\r\nhounded up the stairs to elegise the \xe2\x80\x98Elegy in a Churchyard,\xe2\x80\x99 while\r\nBeetle and Stalky went to punt-about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt amounts to systematic cribbing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout, his voice growing\r\ndeeper and deeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d little Hartopp returned. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t teach a cow the\r\nviolin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn intention it is cribbing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we spoke under the seal of the confessional, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nReverend John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard them arranging their work in this way, Gillett,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nProut persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heavens! Don\xe2\x80\x99t make _me_ Queen\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, my dear fellow.\r\nHartopp is equally incriminated. If they ever found out that I had\r\nsneaked, our relations would suffer--and I value them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think your attitude in this matter is weak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout, looking\r\nround for support. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be really better to break up the study--for\r\na while--wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, break it up by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macrea. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see then if\r\nGillett\xe2\x80\x99s theory holds water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe wise, Prout. Leave them alone, or calamity will overtake you; and\r\nwhat is much more important, they will be annoyed with me. I am too fat,\r\nalas! to be worried by bad boys. Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! They would not dare---but I am going to think this out,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nProut. \xe2\x80\x9cIt needs thought. In intention they cribbed, and I must think\r\nout my duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly capable of putting the boys on their honor. It\xe2\x80\x99s _I_\r\nthat am a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d The Reverend John looked round remorsefully. \xe2\x80\x9cNever\r\nagain will I forget that a master is not a man. Mark my words,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nReverend John. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   But by the yellow Tiber\r\n   Was tumult and affright.\r\n\r\nOut of the blue sky (they were still rejoicing over the cat war) Mr.\r\nProut had dropped into Number Five, read them a lecture on the enormity\r\nof cribbing, and bidden them return to the form-rooms on Monday. They\r\nhad raged, solo and chorus, all through the peaceful Sabbath, for their\r\nsin was more or less the daily practice of all the studies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of cursing?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky at last. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all in the\r\nsame boat. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go back and consort with the house. A locker\r\nin the form-room, and a seat at prep. in Number Twelve.\xe2\x80\x9d (He looked\r\nregretfully round the cozy study which McTurk, their leader in matters\r\nof Art, had decorated with a dado, a stencil, and cretonne hangings.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! Heffy lurchin\xe2\x80\x99 into the form-rooms like a frowzy old retriever,\r\nto see if we aren\xe2\x80\x99t up to something. You know he never leaves his house\r\nalone, these days,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it will be giddy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy aren\xe2\x80\x99t you down watchin\xe2\x80\x99 cricket? I like a robust, healthy boy. You\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t frowst in a form-room. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take an interest in your\r\nhouse? Yah!\xe2\x80\x9d quoted Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we? Let\xe2\x80\x99s! We\xe2\x80\x99ll take an interest in the house. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake no end of interest in the house! He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had us in the form-rooms\r\nfor a year. We\xe2\x80\x99ve learned a lot since then. Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it a\r\nbe-autiful house before we\xe2\x80\x99ve done! \xe2\x80\x99Member that chap in \xe2\x80\x98Eric\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98St.\r\nWinifred\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99--Belial somebody? I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be Belial,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, with\r\nan ensnaring grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight O,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll be Mammon. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lend money at\r\nusury--that\xe2\x80\x99s what they do at all schools accordin\xe2\x80\x99 to the B.O.P. Penny\r\na week on a shillin\xe2\x80\x99. That\xe2\x80\x99ll startle Heffy\xe2\x80\x99s weak intellect. You can be\r\nLucifer, Turkey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I got to do?\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk also smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHead conspiracies--and cabals--and boycotts. Go in for that \xe2\x80\x98stealthy\r\nintrigue\xe2\x80\x99 that Heffy is always talkin\xe2\x80\x99 about. Come on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe house received them on their fall with the mixture of jest and\r\nsympathy always extended to boys turned out of their study. The known\r\naloofness of the three made them more interesting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite like old times, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky selected a locker and flung in\r\nhis books. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve come to sport with you, my young friends, for a while,\r\nbecause our beloved house-master has hove us out of our diggin\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Serve you jolly well right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orrin, \xe2\x80\x9cyou cribbers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will never do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t maintain our giddy\r\nprestige, Orrin, de-ah, if you make these remarks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey wrapped themselves lovingly about the boy, thrust him to the opened\r\nwindow, and drew down the sash to the nape of his neck. With an equal\r\nswiftness they tied his thumbs together behind his back with a piece of\r\ntwine, and then, because he kicked furiously, removed his shoes. There\r\nMr. Prout happened to find him a few minutes later, guillotined and\r\nhelpless, surrounded by a convulsed crowd who would not assist.\r\n\r\nStalky, in an upper form-room, had gathered himself allies against\r\nvengeance. Orrin presently tore up at the head of a boarding party, and\r\nthe form-room grew one fog of dust through which boys wrestled, stamped,\r\nshouted, and yelled. A desk was carried away in the tumult, a knot of\r\nwarriors reeled into and split a door-panel, a window was broken, and\r\na gas-jet fell. Under cover of the confusion the three escaped to the\r\ncorridor, whence they called in and sent up passers-by to the fray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRescue, Kings! Kings! Kings! Number Twelve form-room! Rescue,\r\nProuts--Prouts! Rescue, Macreas! Rescue, Hartopps!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe juniors hurried out like bees aswarm, asking no questions, clattered\r\nup the staircase, and added themselves to the embroilment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot bad for the first evening\xe2\x80\x99s work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, rearranging his\r\ncollar. \xe2\x80\x9cI fancy Prout\xe2\x80\x99ll be somewhat annoyed. We\xe2\x80\x99d better establish an\r\n_alibi_.\xe2\x80\x9d So they sat on Mr. King\xe2\x80\x99s railings till prep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Stalky, as they strolled up to prep. with the ignoble\r\nherd, \xe2\x80\x9cif you get the houses well mixed up an\xe2\x80\x99 scufflin\xe2\x80\x99, it\xe2\x80\x99s even\r\nbettin\xe2\x80\x99 that some ass will start a real row. Hullo, Orrin, you look\r\nrather metagrobolized.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all your fault, you beast! You started it. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got two hundred\r\nlines apiece, and Heffy\xe2\x80\x99s lookin\xe2\x80\x99 for you. Just see what that swine\r\nMalpas did to my eye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like your saying _we_ started it. Who called us cribbers? Can\xe2\x80\x99t your\r\ninfant mind connect cause and effect yet? Some day you\xe2\x80\x99ll find out that\r\nit don\xe2\x80\x99t pay to jest with Number Five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s that shillin\xe2\x80\x99 you owe me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle suddenly.\r\n\r\nStalky could not see Prout behind him, but returned the lead without a\r\nquaver. \xe2\x80\x9cI only owed you ninepence, you old usurer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten the interest,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cA halfpenny a week per\r\nbob is Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s charge. You must be beastly rich, Beetle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Beetle lent me sixpence.\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky came to a full stop and made as\r\nto work it out on his fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cSixpence on the nineteenth, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten you paid no interest on the other bob--the\r\none I lent you before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you took my watch as security.\xe2\x80\x9d The game was developing itself\r\nalmost automatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. Pay me my interest, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll charge you interest on\r\ninterest. Remember, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got your note-of-hand!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a cold-blooded Jew,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk very loudly indeed, and started as Prout came upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you in that disgraceful affair in the form-room just now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, sir? We\xe2\x80\x99re just come up from Mr. King\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease,\r\nsir, what am I to do about prep.? They\xe2\x80\x99ve broken the desk you told me to\r\nsit at, and the form\xe2\x80\x99s just swimming with ink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind another seat--find another seat. D\xe2\x80\x99you expect me to dry-nurse you?\r\nI wish to know whether you are in the habit of advancing money to your\r\nassociates, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; not as a general rule, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a most reprehensible habit. I thought that my house, at least,\r\nwould be free from it. Even with my opinion of you, I hardly thought it\r\nwas one of your vices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in lending money, sir, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to bandy words with you on your notions of morality. How\r\nmuch have you lent Corkran?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. It is difficult to improvise a\r\ngoing concern on the spur of the minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seemed certain enough just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s two and fourpence,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, with a glance of cold\r\nscorn at Beetle. In the hopelessly involved finances of the study there\r\nwas just that sum to which both McTurk and Beetle laid claim, as their\r\nshare in the pledging of Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s second-best Sunday trousers. But\r\nStalky had maintained for two terms that the money was his \xe2\x80\x9ccommission\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n for effecting the pawn; and had, of course, spent it on a study \xe2\x80\x9cbrew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand this, then. You are not to continue your operations as a\r\nmoney-lender. Two and fourpence, you said, Corkran?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStalky had said nothing, and continued so to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour influence for evil is quite strong enough without buying a hold\r\nover your companions.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt in his pockets, and (oh joy!) produced\r\na florin and fourpence. \xe2\x80\x9cBring me what you call Corkran\xe2\x80\x99s note-of-hand,\r\nand be thankful that I do not carry the matter any further. The money\r\nis stopped from your pocket-money, Corkran. The receipt to my study, at\r\nonce!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle they cared! Two and fourpence in a lump is worth six weekly\r\nsixpences any hungry day of the week.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what the dooce _is_ a note-of-hand?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cI only read\r\nabout it in a book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99ve jolly well got to make one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--but our ink don\xe2\x80\x99t turn black till next day. S\xe2\x80\x99pose he\xe2\x80\x99ll spot\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot him. He\xe2\x80\x99s too worried,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cSign your name on a bit of\r\nimpot-paper, Stalky, and write, \xe2\x80\x98I O U two and fourpence.\xe2\x80\x99 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou grateful to me for getting that out of Prout? Stalky\xe2\x80\x99d never have\r\npaid... Why, you ass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMechanically Beetle had handed over the money to Stalky as treasurer of\r\nthe study. The custom of years is not lightly broken. In return for\r\nthe document, Prout expounded to Beetle the enormity of money-lending,\r\nwhich, like everything except compulsory cricket, corrupted houses and\r\ndestroyed good feeling among boys, made youth cold and calculating,\r\nand opened the door to all evil. Finally, did Beetle know of any\r\nother cases? If so, it was his duty as proof of repentance to let his\r\nhouse-master know. No names need be mentioned.\r\n\r\nBeetle did not know--at least, he was not quite sure, sir. How could he\r\ngive evidence against his friends? The house might, of course--here he\r\nfeigned an anguished delicacy--be full of it. He was not in a position\r\nto say. He had not met with any open competition in his trade; but if\r\nMr. Prout considered it was a matter that affected the honor of\r\nthe house (Mr. Prout did consider it precisely that), perhaps the\r\nhouse-prefects would be better...\r\n\r\nHe spun it out till half-way through prep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d said the amateur Shylock, returning to the form-room and\r\ndropping at Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s side, \xe2\x80\x9cif he don\xe2\x80\x99t think the house is putrid with\r\nit, I\xe2\x80\x99m several Dutch-men--that\xe2\x80\x99s all... I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to Mr. Prout\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstudy, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d This to the prep.-master. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said I could sit where I\r\nliked, sir... Oh, he is just tricklin\xe2\x80\x99 with emotion... Yes, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nonly askin\xe2\x80\x99 Corkran to let me have a dip in his ink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter prayers, on the road to the dormitories, Harrison and Craye,\r\nsenior house-prefects, zealous in their office, waylaid them with great\r\nanger. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing to Heffy this time, Beetle? He\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\njawing us all the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has His Serene Transparency been vexin\xe2\x80\x99 you for?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Beetle lendin\xe2\x80\x99 money to Stalky,\xe2\x80\x9d began Harrison; \xe2\x80\x9cand then Beetle\r\nwent and told him that there was any amount of money-lendin\xe2\x80\x99 in the\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, sitting on a boot-basket. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nwhat I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him. I spoke the giddy truth. He asked me if there\r\nwas much of it in the house; and I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks you\xe2\x80\x99re a set of filthy Shylocks,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just as\r\nwell for you he don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re burglars. You know he never gets a\r\nnotion out of his conscientious old head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell-meanin\xe2\x80\x99 man. Did it all for the best.\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky curled gracefully\r\nround the stair-rail. \xe2\x80\x9cHead in a drain-pipe. Full confession in the left\r\nboot. Bad for the honor of the house--very.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harrison. \xe2\x80\x9cYou chaps always behave as if you were jawin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nus when we come to jaw you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a lot too cheeky,\xe2\x80\x9d said Craye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see where the cheek comes in, except on your part, in\r\ninterferin\xe2\x80\x99 with a private matter between me an\xe2\x80\x99 Beetle after it has\r\nbeen settled by Prout.\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky winked cheerfully at the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of clever little swots,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, addressing the\r\ngas. \xe2\x80\x9cThey get made prefects before they have any tact, and then they\r\nannoy chaps who could really help \xe2\x80\x99em to look after the honor of the\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you to do that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Craye hotly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what are you badgerin\xe2\x80\x99 us for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cOn your own showing,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been so beastly slack, looking after the house, that Prout\r\nbelieves it\xe2\x80\x99s a nest of money-lenders. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told him that I\xe2\x80\x99ve lent\r\nmoney to Stalky, and no one else. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he believes me,\r\nbut that finishes my case. The rest is your business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we find out,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s voice rose, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is apparently an\r\norganized conspiracy throughout the house. For aught we know, the\r\nfags may be lendin\xe2\x80\x99 and borrowin\xe2\x80\x99 far beyond their means. _We_ aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nresponsible for it. We\xe2\x80\x99re only the rank and file.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you surprised we don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to associate with the house?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMcTurk, with dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve kept ourselves to ourselves in our study\r\ntill we were turned out, and now we find ourselves let in for for this\r\nsort of thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s simply disgraceful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you hector and bullyrag us on the stairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, \xe2\x80\x9cabout\r\nmatters that are your business entirely. You know we aren\xe2\x80\x99t prefects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou threatened us with a prefect\xe2\x80\x99s lickin\xe2\x80\x99 just now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle,\r\nboldly inventing as he saw the bewilderment in the faces of the\r\nenemy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll gain anything from us by your way of\r\napproachin\xe2\x80\x99 us, you\xe2\x80\x99re jolly well mistaken. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey clattered upstairs, injured virtue on every inch of their backs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut--but what the dickens have we done?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harrison, amazedly, to\r\nCraye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Only--it always happens that way when one has anything to\r\ndo with them. They\xe2\x80\x99re so beastly plausible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Prout called the good boys into his study anew, and succeeded\r\nin sinking both his and their innocent minds ten fathoms deeper in\r\nblindfolded bedazement. He spoke of steps and measures, of tone and\r\nloyalty in the house and to the house, and urged them to take up the\r\nmatter tactfully.\r\n\r\nSo they demanded of Beetle whether he had any connection with any other\r\nestablishment. Beetle promptly went to his house-master, and wished\r\nto know by what right Harrison and Craye had reopened a matter already\r\nsettled between him and his house-master. In injured innocence no boy\r\nexcelled Beetle.\r\n\r\nThen it occurred to Prout that he might have been unfair to the culprit,\r\nwho had not striven to deny or palliate his offense. He sent for\r\nHarrison and Craye, reprehending them very gently for the tone they had\r\nadopted to a repentant sinner, and when they returned to their study,\r\nthey used the language of despair. They then made headlong inquisition\r\nthrough the house, driving the fags to the edge of hysterics, and\r\nunearthing, with tremendous pomp and parade, the natural and inevitable\r\nsystem of small loans that prevails among small boys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Harrison, Thornton minor lent me a penny last Saturday,\r\nbecause I was fined for breaking the window; and I spent it at Keyte\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know there was any harm in it. And Wray major borrowed twopence\r\nfrom me when my uncle sent me a post-office order--I cashed it at\r\nKeyte\xe2\x80\x99s--for five bob; but he\xe2\x80\x99ll pay me back before the holidays. We\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know there was anything wrong in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey waded through hours of this kind of thing, but found no usury,\r\nor anything approaching to Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s gorgeous scale of interest. The\r\nseniors--for the school had no tradition of deference to prefects\r\noutside compulsory games--told them succinctly to go about their\r\nbusiness. They would not give evidence on any terms. Harrison was one\r\nidiot, and Craye was another; but the greatest of all, they said, was\r\ntheir house-master.\r\n\r\nWhen a house is thoroughly upset, however good its conscience, it breaks\r\ninto knots and coteries--small gatherings in the twilight, box-room\r\ncommittees, and groups in the corridor. And when from group to group,\r\nwith an immense affectation of secrecy, three wicked boys steal, crying\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Cav\xc3\xa9_\xe2\x80\x9d when there is no need of caution, and whispering \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n on the heels of trumpery confidences that instant invented, a very fine\r\nair of plot and intrigue can be woven round such a house.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a few days, it dawned on Prout that he moved in an\r\natmosphere of perpetual ambush. Mysteries hedged him on all sides,\r\nwarnings ran before his heavy feet, and countersigns were muttered\r\nbehind his attentive back. McTurk and Stalky invented many absurd and\r\nidle phrases--catch-words that swept through the house as fire through\r\nstubble. It was a rare jest, and the only practical outcome of the Usury\r\nCommission, that one boy should say to a friend, with awful gravity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think there\xe2\x80\x99s much of it going on in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d The other\r\nwould reply, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, one can\xe2\x80\x99t be too careful, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d The effect on\r\na house-master of humane conscience and good intent may be imagined.\r\nAgain, a man who has sincerely devoted himself to gaining the esteem of\r\nhis charges does not like to hear himself described, even at a distance,\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cPopularity Prout\xe2\x80\x9d by a dark and scowling Celt with a fluent tongue.\r\nA rumor that stories--unusual stories--are told in the form-rooms,\r\nbetween the lights, by a boy who does not command his confidence,\r\nagitates such a man; and even elaborate and tender politeness--for the\r\ncourtesy wise-grown men offer to a bewildered child was the courtesy\r\nthat Stalky wrapped round Prout--restores not his peace of mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tone of the house seems changed--changed for the worse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout\r\nto Harrison and Craye. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you noticed it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t for an instant\r\nimpute--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe never imputed anything; but, on the other hand, he never did anything\r\nelse, and, with the best intentions in the world, he had reduced the\r\nhouse-prefects to a state as nearly bordering on nervous irritation\r\nas healthy boys can know. Worst of all, they began at times to wonder\r\nwhether Stalky & Co. had not some truth in their often-repeated\r\nassertions that Prout was a gloomy ass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you know, I am not the kind of man who puts himself out for every\r\nlittle thing he hears. _I_ believe in letting the house work out their\r\nown salvation--with a light guiding hand on the reins, of course. But\r\nthere is a perceptible lack of reverence---a lower tone in matters that\r\ntouch the honor of the house, a sort of hardness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n   Oh, Prout he is a nobleman, a nobleman, a nobleman!\r\n       Our Heffy is a nobleman--\r\n       He does an awful lot,\r\n   Because his popularity\r\n   Oh, pop-u-pop-u-larity--\r\n   His giddy popularity\r\n       Would suffer did he not!\r\n\r\nThe study door stood ajar; and the song, borne by twenty clear voices,\r\ncame faint from a form-room. The fags rather liked the tune; the words\r\nwere Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a thing no sensible man objects to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout with a lop-sided\r\nsmile; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you know straws show which way the wind blows. Can you trace\r\nit to any direct influence? I am speaking to you now as heads of the\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t the least doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harrison angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nwhat you mean, sir. It all began when Number Five study came to the\r\nform-rooms. There\xe2\x80\x99s no use blinkin\xe2\x80\x99 it, Craye. You know that, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey make things rather difficult for us, sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Craye. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore their manner than anything else, that Harrison means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they hamper you in the discharge of your duties, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no, sir. They only look on and grin--and turn up their noses\r\ngenerally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Craye, plunging into the business boldly, \xe2\x80\x9cit would\r\nbe a great deal better if they were sent back to their study--better for\r\nthe house. They are rather old to be knocking about the form-rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are younger than Orrin, or Flint, and a dozen others that I can\r\nthink of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; but that\xe2\x80\x99s different, somehow. They\xe2\x80\x99re rather influential.\r\nThey have a knack of upsettin\xe2\x80\x99 things in a quiet way that one can\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nhold of. At least, if one does--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you think they would be better in their own study again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmphatically Harrison and Craye were of that opinion. As Harrison said\r\nto Craye, afterwards, \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve weakened our authority. They\xe2\x80\x99re too big\r\nto lick; they\xe2\x80\x99ve made an exhibition of us over this usury business,\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99re a laughing-stock to the rest of the school. I\xe2\x80\x99m going up (for\r\nSandhurst, understood) next term. They\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to knock me out of\r\nhalf my work already with their--their lunacy. If they go back to their\r\nstudy we may have a little peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Harrison.\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk ambled round the corner, with a roving eye on\r\nall possible horizons. \xe2\x80\x9cBearin\xe2\x80\x99 up, old man? That\xe2\x80\x99s right. Live it down!\r\nLive it down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look a little pensive,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cExhaustin\xe2\x80\x99 job superintendin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe honor of the house, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? By the way, how are you off for\r\nmares\xe2\x80\x99-nests?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harrison, hoping for instant reward. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nrecommended Prout to let you go back to your study.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dooce you have! And who under the sun are _you_ to interfere\r\nbetween us and our house-master? Upon my Sam, you two try us very\r\nhard--you do, indeed. Of course we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how far you abuse your\r\nposition to prejudice us with Mr. Prout; but when you deliberately\r\nstop me to tell me you\xe2\x80\x99ve been makin\xe2\x80\x99 arrangements behind our back--in\r\nsecret--with Prout--I--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know really what we ought to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s beastly unfair!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Craye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is.\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk had adopted a ghastly solemnity that sat well on his\r\nlong, lean face. \xe2\x80\x9cHang it all! A prefect\xe2\x80\x99s one thing and an usher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanother; but you seem to combine \xe2\x80\x99em. You recommend this--you recommend\r\nthat! _You_ say how and when we go back to our study!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut--but--we thought you\xe2\x80\x99d like it, Turkey. We did, indeed. You know\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be ever so much more comfortable there.\xe2\x80\x9d Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s voice was\r\nalmost tearful.\r\n\r\nMcTurk turned away as though to hide his emotions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re broke!\xe2\x80\x9d He hunted up Stalky and Beetle in a box-room. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsick! They\xe2\x80\x99ve been beggin\xe2\x80\x99 Heffy to let us go back to Number Five. Poor\r\ndevils! Poor little devils!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the olive branch,\xe2\x80\x9d was Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s comment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the giddy white\r\nflag, by gum! Come to think of it, we _have_ metagrobolized \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust after tea that day, Mr. Prout sent for them to say that if they\r\nchose to ruin their future by neglecting their work, it was entirely\r\ntheir own affair. He wished them, however, to understand that their\r\npresence in the form-rooms could not be tolerated one hour longer.\r\nHe personally did not care to think of the time he must spend in\r\neliminating the traces of their evil influences. How far Beetle had\r\npandered to the baser side of youthful imagination he would ascertain\r\nlater; and Beetle might be sure that if Mr. Prout came across any\r\nsoul-corrupting consequences--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsequences of what, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, genuinely bewildered this\r\ntime; and McTurk quietly kicked him on the ankle for being \xe2\x80\x9cfetched\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n by Prout. Beetle, the house-master continued, knew very well what was\r\nintended. Evil and brief had been their careers under his eye; and as\r\none standing _in loco parentis_ to their yet uncontaminated associates,\r\nhe was bound to take his precautions. The return of the study key closed\r\nthe sermon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what was the baser-side-of-imagination business?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle on\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never knew such an ass as you are for justifyin\xe2\x80\x99 yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMcTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I jolly well skinned your ankle. Why do you let yourself\r\nbe drawn by everybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDraws be blowed! I must have tickled him up in some way I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nabout. If I\xe2\x80\x99d had a notion of that before, of course I could have rubbed\r\nit in better. It\xe2\x80\x99s too late now. What a pity! \xe2\x80\x98Baser side.\xe2\x80\x99 What _was_\r\nhe drivin\xe2\x80\x99 at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew we could make it a happy little\r\nhouse. I said so, remember--but I swear I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99d do it so\r\nsoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout most firmly in Common-room. \xe2\x80\x9cI maintain that Gillett is\r\nwrong. True, I let them return to their study.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith your known views on cribbing, too?\xe2\x80\x9d purred little Hartopp. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nan immoral compromise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend John. \xe2\x80\x9cI--we--all of us have exercised\r\nan absolutely heart-breaking discretion for the last ten days. Now we\r\nwant to know. Confess--have you known a happy minute since--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs regards my house, I have not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are entirely\r\nwrong in your estimate of those boys. In justice to the others--in\r\nself-defence--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! I said it would come to that,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Reverend John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--I was forced to send them back. Their moral influence was\r\nunspeakable--simply unspeakable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd bit by bit he told his tale, beginning with Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s usury, and\r\nending with the house-prefects\xe2\x80\x99 appeal.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cBeetle in the _r\xc3\xb4le_ of Shylock is new to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said King, with\r\ntwitching lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard rumors of it--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, after you had dealt with them; but I was careful not to inquire. I\r\nnever interfere with--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hartopp, \xe2\x80\x9cwould cheerfully give him five shillings\r\nif he could work out one simple sum in compound interest without three\r\ngross errors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--why--why!\xe2\x80\x9d Mason, the mathematical master, stuttered, a fierce joy\r\non his face, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been had--precisely the same as me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you held an inquiry?\xe2\x80\x9d Little Hartopp\xe2\x80\x99s voice drowned Mason\xe2\x80\x99s ere\r\nProut caught the import of the sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy himself hinted at the existence of a deal of it in the house,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Prout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is past master in that line,\xe2\x80\x9d said the chaplain. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, as regards\r\nthe honor of the house--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey lowered it in a week. I have striven to build it up for years.\r\nMy own house-prefects--and boys do not willingly complain of each\r\nother--besought me to get rid of them. You say you have their\r\nconfidence, Gillett: they may tell you another tale. As far as I am\r\nconcerned, they may go to the devil in their own way. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick and tired\r\nof them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prout bitterly.\r\n\r\nBut it was the Reverend John, with a smiling countenance, who went to\r\nthe devil just after Number Five had cleared away a very pleasant little\r\nbrew (it cost them two and fourpence) and was settling down to prep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Padre, come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, thrusting forward the best\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve only met you official-like these last ten days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were under sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend John. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not consort\r\nwith malefactors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but we\xe2\x80\x99re restored again,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Prout has relented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout a stain on our characters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a painful\r\nepisode, Padre, most painful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, consider for a while, and perpend, _mes enfants_. It is about\r\nyour characters that I\xe2\x80\x99ve called to-night. In the language of the\r\nschools, what the dooce _have_ you been up to in Mr. Prout\xe2\x80\x99s house? It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to laugh over. He says that you so lowered the tone of\r\nthe house he had to pack you back to your studies. Is that true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery word of it, Padre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be flippant, Turkey. Listen to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you very often that\r\nno boys in the school have a greater influence for good or evil than\r\nyou have. You know I don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about ethics and moral codes, because I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the young of the human animal realizes what they mean\r\nfor some years to come. All the same, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to think you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nperverting the juniors. Don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt, Beetle. Listen to me. Mr. Prout\r\nhas a notion that you have been corrupting your associates somehow or\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Prout has so many notions, Padre,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich one\r\nis this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he tells me that he heard you telling a story in the twilight in\r\nthe form-room, in a whisper. And Orrin said, just as he opened the door,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shut up, Beetle; it\xe2\x80\x99s too beastly.\xe2\x80\x99 Now then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember Mrs. Oliphant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Beleaguered City\xe2\x80\x99 that you lent me last\r\nterm?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\nThe Padre nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got the notion out of that. Only, instead of a city, I made it the\r\nColl. in a fog--besieged by ghosts of dead boys, who hauled chaps out of\r\ntheir beds in the dormitory. All the names are quite real. You tell it\r\nin a whisper, you know with the names. Orrin didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it one little\r\nbit. None of \xe2\x80\x99em have ever let me finish it. It gets just awful at the\r\nend part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why in the world didn\xe2\x80\x99t you explain to Mr. Prout, instead of\r\nleaving him under the impression--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPadre Sahib,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\xe2\x80\x99t the least good explainin\xe2\x80\x99 to Mr.\r\nProut. If he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t one impression, he\xe2\x80\x99s bound to have another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d do it with the best o\xe2\x80\x99 motives. He\xe2\x80\x99s _in loco parentis_,\xe2\x80\x9d purred\r\nStalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou young demons!\xe2\x80\x9d the Reverend John replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd am I to understand\r\nthat the---the usury business was another of your house-master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpressions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--we helped a little in that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cI did owe Beetle two\r\nand fourpence at least, Beetle says I did, but I never intended to pay\r\nhim. Then we started a bit of an argument on the stairs, and--and Mr.\r\nProut dropped into it accidental. That was how it was, Padre. He paid me\r\ncash down like a giddy Dook (stopped it out of my pocket-money just the\r\nsame), and Beetle gave him my note-of-hand all correct. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat happened after that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was too truthful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cI always am. You see, he was under\r\nan impression, Padre, and I suppose I ought to have corrected that\r\nimpression; but of course I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be _quite_ certain that his\r\nhouse wasn\xe2\x80\x99t given over to money-lendin\xe2\x80\x99, could I? I thought the\r\nhouse-prefects might know more about it than I did. They ought to.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re giddy palladiums of public schools.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey did, too--by the time they\xe2\x80\x99d finished,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cAs nice a\r\npair of conscientious, well-meanin\xe2\x80\x99, upright, pure-souled boys as you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\never want to meet, Padre. They turned the house upside down--Harrison\r\nand Craye---with the best motives in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey said so. \xe2\x80\x98They said it very loud and clear. They went and shouted\r\nin our ear,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own private impression is that all three of you will infallibly be\r\nhanged,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything,\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was all Mr. Prout. Did\r\nyou ever read a book about Japanese wrestlers? My uncle---he\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\nNavy--gave me a beauty once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to change the subject, Turkey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99m givin\xe2\x80\x99 an illustration--same as a sermon. These\r\nwrestler-chaps have got sort sort of trick that lets the other chap do\r\nall the work. Than they give a little wriggle, and he upsets himself.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s called _shibbuwichee_ or _tokonoma_, or somethin\xe2\x80\x99. Mr. Prout\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\n_shibbuwicher_. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t our fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you suppose we went round corruptin\xe2\x80\x99 the minds of the fags?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBeetle. \xe2\x80\x9cThey haven\xe2\x80\x99t any, to begin with; and if they had, they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncorrupted long ago. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a fag, Padre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I fancied I knew the normal range of your iniquities; but if\r\nyou take so much trouble to pile up circumstantial evidence against\r\nyourselves, you can\xe2\x80\x99t blame any one if--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t blame any one, Padre. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t said a word against Mr.\r\nProut, have we?\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky looked at the others. \xe2\x80\x9cWe love him. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nnotion how we love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m! You dissemble your love very well. Have you ever thought who got\r\nyou turned out of your study in the first place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Mr. Prout turned us out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, with significance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I was that man. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it; but some words of mine, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid, gave Mr. Prout the impression--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNumber Five laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see it\xe2\x80\x99s just the same thing with you, Padre,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nis quick to get an impression, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he? But you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlove him, \xe2\x80\x99cause we do. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t an ounce of vice about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA double knock fell on the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Head to see Number Five study in his study at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice\r\nof Foxy, the school sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend John. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that there is a great\r\ndeal of trouble coming for some people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word! Mr. Prout\xe2\x80\x99s gone and told the Head,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmoral double-ender. Not fair, luggin\xe2\x80\x99 the Head into a house-row.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should recommend a copy-book on a--h\xe2\x80\x99m--safe and certain part,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Reverend John disinterestedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh! He licks across the shoulders, an\xe2\x80\x99 it would slam like a beastly\r\nbarn-door,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Padre. We\xe2\x80\x99re in for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more they stood in the presence of the Head--Belial, Mammon, and\r\nLucifer. But they had to deal with a man more subtle than them all. Mr.\r\nProut had talked to him, heavily and sadly, for half an hour; and the\r\nHead had seen all that was hidden from the house-master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been bothering Mr. Prout,\xe2\x80\x9d he said pensively. \xe2\x80\x9cHouse-masters\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t here to be bothered by boys more than is necessary. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nbeing bothered by these things. You are bothering _me_. That is a very\r\nserious offense. You see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, I purpose to bother you, on personal and private grounds,\r\nbecause you have broken into my time. You are much too big to lick, so\r\nI suppose I shall have to mark my displeasure in some other way. Say, a\r\nthousand lines apiece, a week\xe2\x80\x99s gating, and a few things of that kind.\r\nMuch too big to lick, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky cheerfully; for a week\xe2\x80\x99s gating in the summer\r\nterm is serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVe-ry good. Then we will do what we can. I wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bother\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a fair, sustained, equable stroke, with a little draw to it,\r\nbut what they felt most was his unfairness in stopping to talk between\r\nexecutions. Thus: \xe2\x80\x9cAmong the--lower classes this would lay me open to\r\na charge of--assault. You should be more grateful for your--privileges\r\nthan you are. There is a limit--one finds it by experience,\r\nBeetle--beyond which it is never safe to pursue private vendettas,\r\nbecause--don\xe2\x80\x99t move--sooner or later one comes--into collision with\r\nthe--higher authority, who has studied the animal. _Et ego_--McTurk,\r\nplease--_in Arcadia vixi_. There\xe2\x80\x99s a certain flagrant injustice about\r\nthis that ought to appeal to--your temperament. And that\xe2\x80\x99s all! You will\r\ntell your house-master that you have been formally caned by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, wriggling his shoulder-blades all down the\r\ncorridor. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was business! The Prooshan Bates has an infernal\r\nstraight eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it wily of me to ask for the lickin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, \xe2\x80\x9cinstead of\r\nthose impots?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRot! We were in for it from the first. _I_ knew the look of his old\r\neye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cI was within an inch of blubbing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly smile,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go down to the lavatory and have a look at the damage. One of us\r\ncan hold the glass and t\xe2\x80\x99others can squint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey proceeded on these lines for some ten minutes. The wales were very\r\nred and very level. There was not a penny to choose between any of them\r\nfor thoroughness, efficiency, and a certain clarity of outline that\r\nstamps the work of the artist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing down there?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Prout was at the head of the\r\nlavatory stairs, attracted by the noise of splashing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve only been caned by the Head, sir, and we\xe2\x80\x99re washing off the\r\nblood. The Head said we were to tell you. We were coming to report\r\nourselves in a minute, sir. (_Sotto voce_.) That\xe2\x80\x99s a score for Heffy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he deserves to score something, poor devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, putting\r\non his shirt. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve sweated a stone and a half off him since we began.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut look here, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t we wrathy with the Head? He said it was a\r\nflagrant injustice. So it is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear man,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, and vouchsafed no further answer.\r\n\r\nIt was Stalky who laughed till he had to hold on by the edge of a basin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ a funny ass! What\xe2\x80\x99s that for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m--I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of the flagrant injustice of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORAL REFORMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no disguising the defeat. The victory was to Prout, but they\r\ngrudged it not. If he had broken the rules of the game by calling in the\r\nHead, they had had a good run for their money.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend John sought the earliest opportunity of talking things\r\nover. Members of a bachelor Common-room, of a school where masters\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstudies are designedly dotted among studies and form-rooms, can, if they\r\nchoose, see a great deal of their charges. Number Five had spent some\r\ncautious years in testing the Reverend John. He was emphatically a\r\ngentleman. He knocked at a study door before entering; he comported\r\nhimself as a visitor and not a strayed lictor; he never prosed, and he\r\nnever carried over into official life the confidences of idle hours.\r\nProut was ever an unmitigated nuisance; King came solely as an avenger\r\nof blood; even little Hartopp, talking natural history, seldom forgot\r\nhis office; but the Reverend John was a guest desired and beloved by\r\nNumber Five.\r\n\r\nBehold him, then, in their only arm-chair, a bent briar between his\r\nteeth, chin down in three folds on his clerical collar, and blowing like\r\nan amiable whale, while Number Five discoursed of life as it appeared to\r\nthem, and specially of that last interview with the Head--in the matter\r\nof usury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne licking once a week would do you an immense amount of good,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, twinkling and shaking all over; \xe2\x80\x9cand, as you say, you were\r\nentirely in the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRa-ather, Padre! We could have proved it if he\xe2\x80\x99d let us talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nStalky; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. The Head\xe2\x80\x99s a downy bird.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe understands you perfectly. Ho! ho! Well, you worked hard enough for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99s awfully fair. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lick a chap in the morning an\xe2\x80\x99 preach\r\nat him in the afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t; he ain\xe2\x80\x99t in Orders, thank goodness,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. Number Five\r\nheld the very strongest views on clerical head-masters, and were ever\r\nready to meet their pastor in argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost all other schools have clerical Heads,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend John\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair on the chaps,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky replied. \xe2\x80\x9cMakes \xe2\x80\x99em sulky. Of\r\ncourse it\xe2\x80\x99s different with _you_, sir. You belong to the school--same as\r\nwe do. I mean ordinary clergymen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am a most ordinary clergyman; and Mr. Hartopp\xe2\x80\x99s in Orders,\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe--es, but he took \xe2\x80\x99em after he came to the Coll. We saw him go up for\r\nhis exam. That\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cBut just think if the Head\r\nwent and got ordained!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would happen, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the Coll. \xe2\x80\x99ud go to pieces in a year, sir. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you know?\xe2\x80\x9d The Reverend John was smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been here nearly six years now. There are precious few things\r\nabout the Coll. we don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, even you came the\r\nterm after I did, sir. I remember your asking our names in form your\r\nfirst lesson. Mr. King, Mr. Prout, and the Head, of course, are the only\r\nmasters senior to us--in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve changed a good deal--in Common-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle with a grunt. \xe2\x80\x9cThey came here, an\xe2\x80\x99 they went away to\r\nget married. Jolly good riddance, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t our Beetle hold with matrimony?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Padre; don\xe2\x80\x99t make fun of me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve met chaps in the holidays who\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot married house-masters. It\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly awful! They have babies and\r\nteething and measles and all that sort of thing right bung _in_\r\nthe school; and the masters\xe2\x80\x99 wives give tea-parties--tea-parties,\r\nPadre!--and ask the chaps to breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat don\xe2\x80\x99t matter so much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the house-masters let\r\ntheir houses alone, and they leave everything to the prefects. Why, in\r\none school, a chap told me, there were big baize doors and a passage\r\nabout a mile long between the house and the master\xe2\x80\x99s house. They could\r\ndo just what they pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSatan rebuking sin with a vengeance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, larks are right enough; but you know what we mean, Padre. After a\r\nbit it gets worse an\xe2\x80\x99 worse. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s a big bust-up and a row that\r\ngets into the papers, and a lot of chaps are expelled, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways the wrong un\xe2\x80\x99s; don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that. Have a cup of cocoa, Padre?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said McTurk with the kettle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thanks; I\xe2\x80\x99m smoking. Always the wrong \xe2\x80\x99uns? Pro-ceed, my Stalky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then\xe2\x80\x9d--Stalky warmed to the work--\xe2\x80\x9ceverybody says, \xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthought it? Shockin\xe2\x80\x99 boys! Wicked little kids!\xe2\x80\x99 It all comes of havin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmarried house-masters, _I_ think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Daniel come to judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it does,\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve met chaps in the holidays, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve told me the same thing. It looks awfully pretty for one\xe2\x80\x99s people\r\nto see--a nice separate house with a nice lady in charge, an\xe2\x80\x99 all that.\r\nBut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. It takes the house-masters off their work, and it gives\r\nthe prefects a heap too much power, an\xe2\x80\x99--an\xe2\x80\x99--it rots up everything. You\r\nsee, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if we were just an ordinary school. We take crammers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrejections as well as good little boys like Stalky. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do that\r\nto make our name, of course, and we get \xe2\x80\x99em into Sandhurst somehow or\r\nother, don\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, O Turk. Like a book thou talkest, Turkey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so we want rather different masters, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so, to other\r\nplaces? We aren\xe2\x80\x99t like the rest of the schools.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt leads to all sorts of bullyin\xe2\x80\x99, too, a chap told me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you _do_ need most of a single man\xe2\x80\x99s time, I must say.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nReverend John considered his hosts critically. \xe2\x80\x9cBut do you never feel\r\nthat the world--the Common-room--is too much with you sometimes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly--in summer, anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s eye roved contentedly to the\r\nwindow. \xe2\x80\x9cOur bounds are pretty big, too, and they leave us to ourselves\r\na good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor example, here am I sitting in your study, very much in your way,\r\neh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed you aren\xe2\x80\x99t, Padre. Sit down. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go, sir. You know we\xe2\x80\x99re glad\r\nwhenever you come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no doubting the sincerity of the voices. The Reverend John\r\nflushed a little with pleasure and refilled his briar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we generally know where the Common-room are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle\r\ntriumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you come through our lower dormitories last night\r\nafter ten, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to smoke a pipe with your house-master. No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t give him\r\nany impressions. I took a short cut through your dormitories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sniffed a whiff of \xe2\x80\x99baccy, this mornin\xe2\x80\x99. Yours is stronger than Mr.\r\nProut\xe2\x80\x99s. _I_ knew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, wagging his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend John absently. It was some years\r\nbefore Beetle perceived that this was rather a tribute to innocence than\r\nobservation. The long, light, blindless dormitories, devoid of inner\r\ndoors, were crossed at all hours of the night by masters visiting one\r\nanother; for bachelors sit up later than married folk. Beetle had never\r\ndreamed that there might be a purpose in this steady policing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalking about bullying,\xe2\x80\x9d the Reverend John resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou all caught it\r\npretty hot when you were fags, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we must have been rather awful little beasts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle,\r\nlooking serenely over the gulf between eleven and sixteen. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Hat, what\r\nbullies they were then--Fairburn, \xe2\x80\x98Gobby\xe2\x80\x99 Maunsell, and all that gang!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Member when \xe2\x80\x98Gobby\xe2\x80\x99 called us the Three Blind Mice, and we had to get\r\nup on the lockers and sing while he buzzed ink-pots at us?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey _were_ bullies if you like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any of it now,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk soothingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where you make a mistake. We\xe2\x80\x99re all inclined to say that\r\neverything is all right as long we aren\xe2\x80\x99t ourselves hurt. I sometimes\r\nwonder if it is extinct--bullying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFags bully each other horrid; but the upper forms are supposed to be\r\nswottin\xe2\x80\x99 for exams. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got something else to think about,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBeetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky was watching the chaplain\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have my doubts.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, explosively, \xe2\x80\x9cOn my word, for three moderately\r\nintelligent boys you aren\xe2\x80\x99t very observant. I suppose you were too busy\r\nmaking things warm for your house-master to see what lay under your\r\nnoses when you were in the form-rooms last week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, sir? I--I swear we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99d advise you to look. When a little chap is whimpering in a\r\ncorner and wears his clothes like rags, and never does any work, and\r\nis notoriously the dirtiest little \xe2\x80\x98corridor-caution\xe2\x80\x99 in the Coll.,\r\nsomething\xe2\x80\x99s wrong somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Clewer,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk under his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Clewer. He comes to me for his French. It\xe2\x80\x99s his first term, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s almost as complete a wreck as you were, Beetle. He\xe2\x80\x99s not naturally\r\nclever, but he has been hammered till he\xe2\x80\x99s nearly an idiot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. They sham silly to get off more tickings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_\r\nknow that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never actually seen him knocked about,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe genuine article don\xe2\x80\x99t do that in public,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cFairburn\r\nnever touched me when any one was looking on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t swagger about it, Beetle,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all caught it\r\nin our time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I got it worse than any one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want an\r\nauthority on bullyin\xe2\x80\x99, Padre, come to me. Corkscrews--brush-drill\r\nkeys--head-knucklin\xe2\x80\x99--arm-twistin\xe2\x80\x99--rockin\xe2\x80\x99--Ag Ags--and all the rest\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I do want you as an authority, or rather I want your authority to\r\nstop it--all of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Abana and Pharpar, Padre--Harrison and Craye? They are\r\nMr. Prout\xe2\x80\x99s pets,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk a little bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9c_We_ aren\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nsub-prefects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve considered that, but on the other hand, since most bullying is\r\nmere thoughtlessness--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot one little bit of it, Padre,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cBullies like bullyin\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nThey mean it. They think it up in lesson and practise it in the\r\nquarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. If the thing goes up to the prefects it may make another\r\nhouse-row. You\xe2\x80\x99ve had one already. Don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh. Listen to me. I ask\r\nyou--my own Tenth Legion--to take the thing up quietly. I want little\r\nClewer made to look fairly clean and decent--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlowed if _I_ wash him!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecent and self-respecting. As for the other boy, whoever he is,\r\nyou can use your influence\xe2\x80\x9d--a purely secular light flickered in the\r\nchaplain\xe2\x80\x99s eye--\xe2\x80\x9cin any way you please to--to dissuade him. That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to you. Good-night, _mes enfants_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what are we goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do?\xe2\x80\x9d Number Five stared at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Clewer would give his eyes for a place to be quiet in. _I_ know\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we made him a study-fag, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a dirty little brute, and he\xe2\x80\x99d mess up\r\neverything. Besides, we ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 to have any beastly Erickin\xe2\x80\x99. D\xe2\x80\x99you\r\nwant to walk about with your arm round his neck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d clean out the jam-pots, anyhow; an\xe2\x80\x99 the burnt-porridge\r\nsaucepan--it\xe2\x80\x99s filthy now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot good enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, bringing up both heels with a crash on\r\nthe table. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we find the merry jester who\xe2\x80\x99s been bullyin\xe2\x80\x99 him an\xe2\x80\x99 make\r\nhim happy, that\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t we spot him when we were in\r\nthe form-rooms, though?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe a lot of fags have made a dead set at Clewer. They do that\r\nsometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to kick the whole of the lower school in our house--on\r\nspec. Come on,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your hair on! We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t make a fuss about the biznai. Whoever\r\nit is he\xe2\x80\x99s kept quiet or we\xe2\x80\x99d have seen him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll walk\r\nround and sniff about till we\xe2\x80\x99re sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey drew the house form-rooms, accounting for every junior and senior\r\nagainst whom they had suspicions; investigated, at Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion,\r\nthe lavatories and box-rooms, but without result. Everybody seemed to be\r\npresent save Clewer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRum!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, pausing outside a study door. \xe2\x80\x9cGolly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA thin piping mixed with tears came muffled through the panels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98As beautiful Kitty one morning was tripping--\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouder, you young devil, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll buzz a book at you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_With a pitcher of milk--_ Oh, Campbell, _please_ don\xe2\x80\x99t! _To the fair\r\nof--_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA book crashed on something soft, and squeals arose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I never thought it was a study-chap, anyhow. That accounts for\r\nour not spotting him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cSefton and Campbell are rather\r\nhefty chaps to tackle. Besides, one can\xe2\x80\x99t go into their study like a\r\nform-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat swine!\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk listened. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the fun of it? I suppose\r\nClewer\xe2\x80\x99s faggin\xe2\x80\x99 for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey aren\xe2\x80\x99t prefects. That\xe2\x80\x99s one good job,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, with his\r\nwar-grin. \xe2\x80\x9cSefton and Campbell! Um! Campbell and Sefton! Ah! One of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x99s a crammer\xe2\x80\x99s pup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two were precocious hairy youths between seventeen and eighteen,\r\nsent to the school in despair by parents who hoped that six months\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsteady cram might, perhaps, jockey them into Sandhurst. Nominally they\r\nwere in Mr. Prout\xe2\x80\x99s house; actually they were under the Head\xe2\x80\x99s eye;\r\nand since he was very careful never to promote strange new boys to\r\nprefectships, they considered they had a grievance against the school.\r\nSefton had spent three months with a London crammer, and the tale of his\r\nadventures there lost nothing in the telling. Campbell, who had a fine\r\ntaste in clothes and a fluent vocabulary, followed his lead in looking\r\ndown loftily on the rest of the world. This was only their second term,\r\nand the school, used to what it profanely called \xe2\x80\x9ccrammers\xe2\x80\x99 pups,\xe2\x80\x9d had\r\ntreated them with rather galling reserve. But their whiskers--Sefton\r\nowned a real razor--and their mustaches were beyond question impressive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go in an\xe2\x80\x99 dissuade \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never had much to\r\ndo with \xe2\x80\x99em, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet my hat Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s a funk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--o! That\xe2\x80\x99s _oratio directa_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI like\r\n_oratio obliqua_. \xe2\x80\x99Sides, where\xe2\x80\x99d our moral influence be then? Think o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRot! What are you goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do?\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle turned into Lower Number Nine\r\nform-room, next door to the study.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d The lights of war flickered over Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I want to\r\njape with \xe2\x80\x99em. Shut up a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drove his hands into his pockets and stared out of window at the sea,\r\nwhistling between his teeth. Then a foot tapped the floor; one shoulder\r\nlifted; he wheeled, and began the short quick double-shuffle--the\r\nwar-dance of Stalky in meditation. Thrice he crossed the empty\r\nform-room, with compressed lips and expanded nostrils, swaying to the\r\nquick-step. Then he halted before the dumb Beetle and softly knuckled\r\nhis head, Beetle bowing to the strokes. McTurk nursed one knee and\r\nrocked to and fro. They could hear Clewer howling as though his heart\r\nwould break.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeetle is the sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you,\r\nBeetle. \xe2\x80\x99Member Galton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Art of Travel\xe2\x80\x99 [one of the forms had been\r\nstudying that pleasant work] an\xe2\x80\x99 the kid whose bleatin\xe2\x80\x99 excited the\r\ntiger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, curse!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle uneasily. It was not his first season as a\r\nsacrifice. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you get on without me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Fraid not, Beetle, dear. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be bullied by Turkey an\xe2\x80\x99 me.\r\nThe more you howl, o\xe2\x80\x99 course, the better it\xe2\x80\x99ll be. Turkey, go an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncovet a stump and a box-rope from somewhere. We\xe2\x80\x99ll tie him up for a\r\nkill--_\xc3\xa0 la_ Galton. \xe2\x80\x99Member when \xe2\x80\x98Molly\xe2\x80\x99 Fairburn made us cock-fight\r\nwith our shoes off, an\xe2\x80\x99 tied up our knees?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that hurt like sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse it did. What a clever chap you are, Beetle! Turkey\xe2\x80\x99ll knock\r\nyou all over the place. \xe2\x80\x99Member we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a big row all round, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntrapped you into doin\xe2\x80\x99 this. Lend us your wipe.\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle was trussed for\r\ncock-fighting; but, in addition to the transverse stump between elbow\r\nand knee, his knees were bound with a box-rope. In this posture, at a\r\npush from Stalky he rolled over sideways, covering himself with dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuffle his hair, Turkey. Now you get down, too. \xe2\x80\x98The bleatin\xe2\x80\x99 of the\r\nkid excites the tiger.\xe2\x80\x99 You two are in such a sweatin\xe2\x80\x99 wax with me that\r\nyou only curse. \xe2\x80\x99Member that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tickle you up with a stump. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave to blub, Beetle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight O! I\xe2\x80\x99ll work up to it in half a shake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow begin--and remember the bleatin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 the kid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up, you brutes! Let me up! You\xe2\x80\x99ve nearly cut my knees off. Oh, you\r\n_are_ beastly cads! _Do_ shut up. \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t a joke!\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s protest was,\r\nin tone, a work of art.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to him, Turkey! Kick him! Roll him over! Kill him! Don\xe2\x80\x99t funk,\r\nBeetle, you brute. Kick him again, Turkey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not blubbin\xe2\x80\x99 really. Roll up, Beetle, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll kick you into the\r\nfender,\xe2\x80\x9d roared McTurk. They made a hideous noise among them, and the\r\nbait allured their quarry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo! What\xe2\x80\x99s the giddy jest?\xe2\x80\x9d Sefton and Campbell entered to find\r\nBeetle on his side, his head against the fender, weeping copiously,\r\nwhile McTurk prodded him in the back with his toes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only Beetle,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky explained. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s shammin\xe2\x80\x99 hurt. I can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nTurkey to go for him properly.\xe2\x80\x9d Sefton promptly kicked both boys, and\r\nhis face lighted. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll attend to \xe2\x80\x99em. Get up an\xe2\x80\x99 cock-fight,\r\nyou two. Give me the stump. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tickle \xe2\x80\x99em. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a giddy jest! Come\r\non, Campbell. Let\xe2\x80\x99s cook \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen McTurk turned on Stalky and called him very evil names.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you were goin\xe2\x80\x99 to cock-fight too, Stalky. Come on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore ass you for believin\xe2\x80\x99 me, then!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you chaps had a row?\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell. \xe2\x80\x9cRow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cHuh! I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nonly educatin\xe2\x80\x99 them. D\xe2\x80\x99you know anythin\xe2\x80\x99 about cock-fighting, Seffy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I know? Why, at Maclagan\xe2\x80\x99s, where I was crammin\xe2\x80\x99 in town, we used\r\nto cock-fight in his drawing-room, and little Maclagan daren\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nanything. But we were just the same as men there, of course. Do I know?\r\n_I_\xe2\x80\x99ll show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I get up?\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Beetle, as Stalky sat on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t jaw, you fat piffler. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to fight Seffy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll slay me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, lug \xe2\x80\x99em into our study,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nice an\xe2\x80\x99 quiet in\r\nthere. I\xe2\x80\x99ll cock-fight Turkey. This is an improvement on young Clewer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight O! I move it\xe2\x80\x99s shoes-off for them an\xe2\x80\x99 shoes-on for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSefton joyously, and the two were flung down on the study floor. Stalky\r\nrolled them behind an arm-chair. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99ll tie you two up an\xe2\x80\x99 direct the\r\nbull-fight. Golly, what wrists you have, Seffy. They\xe2\x80\x99re too thick for a\r\nwipe; got a box-rope?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLots in the corner,\xe2\x80\x9d Sefton replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHurry up! Stop blubbin\xe2\x80\x99, you\r\nbrute, Beetle. We\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to have a giddy campaign. Losers have to sing\r\nfor the winners--sing odes in honor of the conqueror. You call yourself\r\na beastly poet, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Beetle? I\xe2\x80\x99ll poet you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wriggled into position by Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s side. Swiftly and scientifically\r\nthe stumps were thrust through the natural crooks, and the wrists\r\ntied with well-stretched box-ropes to an accompaniment of insults from\r\nMcTurk, bound, betrayed, and voluble behind the chair. Stalky set away\r\nCampbell and Sefton, and strode over to his allies, locking the door on\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a changed voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil--?\xe2\x80\x9d Sefton began. Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s false tears had ceased;\r\nMcTurk, smiling, was on his feet. Together they bound the knees and\r\nankles of the enemy even more straitly.\r\n\r\nStalky took the arm-chair and contemplated the scene with his blandest\r\nsmile. A man trussed for cock-fighting is, perhaps, the most helpless\r\nthing in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The bleatin\xe2\x80\x99 of the kid excites the tiger.\xe2\x80\x99 Oh, you frabjous asses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He lay back and laughed till he could no more. The victims took in the\r\nsituation but slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the finest lickin\xe2\x80\x99 you ever had\r\nin your young lives when we get up!\xe2\x80\x9d thundered Sefton from the floor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh the other side of your mouth before you\xe2\x80\x99ve done. What the\r\ndeuce d\xe2\x80\x99you mean by this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see in two shakes,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t swear like that. What we\r\nwant to know is, why you two hulkin\xe2\x80\x99 swine have been bullyin\xe2\x80\x99 Clewer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s none of your business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you bully Clewer for?\xe2\x80\x9d The question was repeated with\r\nmaddening iteration by each in turn. They knew their work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we jolly well chose!\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer at last. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Even then they could not realize the game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now we\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to bully you because we jolly well choose. We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99 to be just as fair to you as you were to Clewer. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nanything against you. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to us. Odd, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we? You wait an\xe2\x80\x99 see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle reflectively, \xe2\x80\x9cthat shows you\xe2\x80\x99ve never been properly\r\njested with. A public lickin\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t in it with a gentle jape. Bet a bob\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll weep an\xe2\x80\x99 promise anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, young Beetle, we\xe2\x80\x99ll half kill you when we get up. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npromise you that, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to be half killed first, though. Did you give Clewer\r\nHead-knuckles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you give Clewer Head-knuckles?\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk echoed. At the twentieth\r\nrepetition--no boy can stand the torture of one unvarying query, which\r\nis the essence of bullying--came confession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did, confound you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll be knuckled;\xe2\x80\x9d and knuckled they were, according to ancient\r\nexperience. Head-knuckling is no trifle; \xe2\x80\x9cMolly\xe2\x80\x9d Fairburn of the old\r\ndays could not have done better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you give Clewer Brush-drill?\xe2\x80\x9d This time the question was answered\r\nsooner, and Brush-drill was dealt out for the space of five minutes by\r\nStalky\xe2\x80\x99s watch. They could not even writhe in their bonds. No brush is\r\nemployed in Brush-drill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you give Clewer the Key?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; we didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I swear we didn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d from Campbell, rolling in agony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to you, so you can see what it would be like if you\r\nhad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe torture of the Key--which has no key at all--hurts excessively. They\r\nendured several minutes of it, and their language necessitated the gag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you give Clewer Corkscrews?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Oh, curse your silly souls! Let us alone, you cads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were corkscrewed, and the torture of the Corkscrew--this has\r\nnothing to do with corkscrews--is keener than the torture of the Key.\r\n\r\nThe method and silence of the attacks was breaking their nerves. Between\r\neach new torture came the pitiless, dazing rain of questions, and when\r\nthey did not answer to the point, Isabella-colored handkerchiefs were\r\nthrust into their mouths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow are those all the things you did to Clewer? Take out the gag,\r\nTurkey, and let \xe2\x80\x99em answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I swear that was all. Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re killing us, Stalky!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nCampbell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPre-cisely what Clewer said to you. I heard him. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nshow you what real bullyin\xe2\x80\x99 is. \xe2\x80\x98What I don\xe2\x80\x99t like about you, Sefton,\r\nis, you come to the Coll. with your stick-up collars an\xe2\x80\x99 patent-leather\r\nboots, an\xe2\x80\x99 you think you can teach us something about bullying. _Do_ you\r\nthink you can teach us anything about bullying? Take out the gag and let\r\nhim answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d--ferociously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says no. Rock him to sleep. Campbell can watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt needs three boys and two boxing-gloves to rock a boy to sleep. Again\r\nthe operation has nothing to do with its name. Sefton was \xe2\x80\x9crocked\xe2\x80\x9d till\r\nhis eyes set in his head and he gasped and crowed for breath, sick and\r\ndizzy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell, appalled, from his corner, and turned white.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut him away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cBring on Campbell. Now this _is_ bullyin\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nOh, I forgot! I say, Campbell, what did you bully Clewer for? Take out\r\nhis gag and let him answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Oh, let me off! I swear I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it _pax_. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n\xe2\x80\x98rock\xe2\x80\x99 me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The bleatin\xe2\x80\x99 of the kid excites the tiger.\xe2\x80\x99 He says he don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Set\r\nhim up, Beetle. Give me the glove an\xe2\x80\x99 put in the gag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn silence Campbell was \xe2\x80\x9crocked\xe2\x80\x9d sixty-four times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to die!\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says he is goin\xe2\x80\x99 to die.\r\nPut him away. Now, Sefton! Oh, I forgot! Sefton, what did you bully\r\nClewer for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer is unprintable; but it brought not the faintest flush to\r\nStalky\xe2\x80\x99s downy cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake him an Ag Ag, Turkey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd an Ag Ag was he made, forthwith. The hard-bought experience of\r\nnearly eighteen years was at his disposal, but he did not seem to\r\nappreciate it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says we are sweeps. Put him away! Now, Campbell! Oh, I forgot! I\r\nsay, Campbell, what did you bully Clewer for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen came the tears--scalding tears; appeals for mercy and abject\r\npromises of peace. Let them cease the tortures and Campbell would never\r\nlift hand against them. The questions began again--to an accompaniment\r\nof small persuasions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem hurt, Campbell. Are you hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Awfully!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he is hurt. Are you broke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! I swear I am. Oh, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he is broke. Are you humble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he is humble. Are you devilish humble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he is devilish humble. Will you bully Clewer any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. No--ooh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he won\xe2\x80\x99t bully Clewer. Or any one else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I swear I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr any one else. What about that lickin\xe2\x80\x99 you and Sefton were goin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\ngive us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t! I won\xe2\x80\x99t! I swear I won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he won\xe2\x80\x99t lick us. Do you esteem yourself to know anything about\r\nbullyin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about bullyin\xe2\x80\x99. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t we taught you\r\na lot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says we\xe2\x80\x99ve taught him a lot. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you grateful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he is grateful. Put him away. Oh, I forgot! I say, Campbell,\r\nwhat did you bully Clewer for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wept anew; his nerves being raw. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was a bully. I suppose\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what you want me to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he is a bully. Right he is. Put him in the corner. No more\r\njapes for Campbell. Now, Sefton!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou devils! You young devils!\xe2\x80\x9d This and much more as Sefton was punted\r\nacross the carpet by skilful knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The bleatin\xe2\x80\x99 of the kid excites the tiger.\xe2\x80\x99 We\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to make you\r\nbeautiful. Where does he keep his shaving things? [Campbell told.]\r\nBeetle, get some water. Turkey, make the lather. We\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to shave\r\nyou, Seffy, so you\xe2\x80\x99d better lie jolly still, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll get cut. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever shaved any one before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t! Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t! Please don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGettin\xe2\x80\x99 polite, eh? I\xe2\x80\x99m only goin\xe2\x80\x99 to take off one ducky little\r\nwhisker--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll--I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it _pax_, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t. I swear I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you off your\r\nlickin\xe2\x80\x99 when I get up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_And_ half that mustache we\xe2\x80\x99re so proud of. He says he\xe2\x80\x99ll let us off\r\nour lickin\xe2\x80\x99. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMcTurk laughed into the nickel-plated shaving-cup, and settled Sefton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead between Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s vise-like knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on a shake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t shave long hairs. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nto cut all that mustache short first, an\xe2\x80\x99 then scrape him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not goin\xe2\x80\x99 to hunt about for scissors. Won\xe2\x80\x99t a match do? Chuck\r\nus the match-box. He _is_ a hog, you know; we might as well singe him.\r\nLie still!\xe2\x80\x9d He lit a vesta, but checked his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI only want to take\r\noff half, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle waved the brush. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll lather up to the\r\nmiddle--see? and you can burn off the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thin-haired first mustache of youth fluffed off in flame to the\r\nlather-line in the centre of the lip, and Stalky rubbed away the\r\nburnt stumpage with his thumb. It was not a very gentle shave, but it\r\nabundantly accomplished its purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow the whisker on the other side. Turn him over!\xe2\x80\x9d Between match and\r\nrazor this, too, was removed. \xe2\x80\x9cGive him his shaving-glass. Take the gag\r\nout. I want to hear what he\xe2\x80\x99ll say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut there were no words. Sefton gazed at the lop-sided wreck in horror\r\nand despair. Two fat tears rolled down his cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I forgot! I say, Sefton, what did you bully Clewer for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone! Oh, you infernal bullies, leave me alone! Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I had\r\nenough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says we must leave him alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says we are bullies, an\xe2\x80\x99 we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even begun yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re ungrateful, Seffy. Golly! You _do_ look an atrocity and a half!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he has had enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cHe errs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to work, to work!\xe2\x80\x9d chanted McTurk, waving a stump. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, my\r\ngiddy Narcissus. Don\xe2\x80\x99t fall in love with your own reflection!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let him off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell from his corner; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s blubbing, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSefton cried like a twelve-year-old with pain, shame, wounded vanity,\r\nand utter helplessness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll make it _pax_, Sefton, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? You can\xe2\x80\x99t stand up to those\r\nyoung devils--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be rude, Campbell, de-ah,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, \xe2\x80\x9cor you\xe2\x80\x99ll catch it\r\nagain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ devils, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? for a little bullyin\xe2\x80\x99--same as you\xe2\x80\x99ve been givin\xe2\x80\x99 Clewer! How\r\nlong have you been jestin\xe2\x80\x99 with him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cAll this term?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t always knock him about, though!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did when you could catch him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, cross-legged on the\r\nfloor, dropping a stump from time to time across Sefton\xe2\x80\x99s instep. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI know it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--perhaps we did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you went out of your way to catch him? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I know it! Because he\r\nwas an awful little beast, eh? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I know it! Now, you see, _you_\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nawful beasts, and you\xe2\x80\x99re gettin\xe2\x80\x99 what he got--for bein\xe2\x80\x99 a beast. Just\r\nbecause we choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe never really bullied him--like you\xe2\x80\x99ve done us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cThey never really bully--\xe2\x80\x98Molly\xe2\x80\x99 Fairburn didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nOnly knock \xe2\x80\x99em about a little bit. That\xe2\x80\x99s what they say. Only kick their\r\nsouls out of \xe2\x80\x99em, and they go and blub in the box-rooms. Shove their\r\nheads into the ulsters an\xe2\x80\x99 blub. Write home three times a day--yes,\r\nyou brute, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done that--askin\xe2\x80\x99 to be taken away. You\xe2\x80\x99ve never been\r\nbullied properly, Campbell. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you made _pax_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell, who was a humorist in a way. \xe2\x80\x9cLook out, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nslaying Sefton!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his excitement Beetle had used the stump unreflectingly, and Sefton\r\nwas now shouting for mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 you!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, wheeling where he sat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never been bullied,\r\neither. Where were you before you came here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I had a tutor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYah! You would. You never blubbed in your life. But you\xe2\x80\x99re blubbin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnow, by gum. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you blubbin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you see, you blind beast?\xe2\x80\x9d Sefton fell over sideways, tear-tracks\r\nfurrowing the dried lather. Crack came the cricket-stump on the curved\r\nlatter-end of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlind, am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, \xe2\x80\x9cand a beast? Shut up, Stalky. I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\njape a bit with our friend, _\xc3\xa0 la_ \xe2\x80\x98Molly\xe2\x80\x99 Fairburn. _I_ think I can\r\nsee. Can\xe2\x80\x99t I see, Sefton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe point is well taken,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, watching the strap at work.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better say that he sees, Seffy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do--you can! I swear you do!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled Sefton, for strong arguments\r\nwere coercing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t my eyes lovely?\xe2\x80\x9d The stump rose and fell steadily throughout\r\nthis catechism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentle hazel, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--oh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a liar you are! They\xe2\x80\x99re sky-blue. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t they sky-blue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--oh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know your mind from one minute to another. You must\r\nlearn--you must learn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a bait you\xe2\x80\x99re in!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep your hair on, Beetle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had it done to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cNow--about my being a beast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pax_--oh, _pax_!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sefton; \xe2\x80\x9cmake it _pax_. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give up! Let me\r\noff! I\xe2\x80\x99m broke! I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh! Just when we were gettin\xe2\x80\x99 our hand in!\xe2\x80\x9d grunted McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t let Clewer off, I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfess--apologize--quick!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\nFrom the floor Sefton made unconditional surrender, more abjectly even\r\nthan Campbell. He would never touch any one again. He would go softly\r\nall the days of his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take it, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Sefton.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re broke? Very good. Shut up, Beetle! But before we let you up, you\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 Campbell will kindly oblige us with \xe2\x80\x98Kitty of Coleraine\xe2\x80\x99--_\xc3\xa0 la_\r\nClewer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not fair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve surrendered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Course you have. Now you\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do what we tell you--same as\r\nClewer would. If you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t surrendered you\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 been really bullied.\r\nHavin\xe2\x80\x99 surrendered--do you follow, Seffy?--you sing odes in honor of the\r\nconquerors. Hurry up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey dropped into chairs luxuriously. Campbell and Sefton looked at each\r\nother, and, neither taking comfort from that view, struck up \xe2\x80\x9cKitty of\r\nColeraine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVile bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, as the miserable wailing ended. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsurrendered it would have been our painful duty to buzz books at you for\r\nsingin\xe2\x80\x99 out o\xe2\x80\x99 tune. Now then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe freed them from their bonds, but for several minutes they could not\r\nrise. Campbell was first on his feet, smiling uneasily. Sefton staggered\r\nto the table, buried his head in his arms, and shook with sobs. There\r\nwas no shadow of fight in either--only amazement, distress, and shame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCa--can\xe2\x80\x99t he shave clean before tea, please?\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s ten\r\nminutes to bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStalky shook his head. He meant to escort the half-shaved one to the\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nMcTurk yawned in his chair and Beetle mopped his face. They were all\r\ndripping with excitement and exertion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I knew anything about it, I swear I\xe2\x80\x99d give you a moral lecture,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Stalky severely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t jaw; they\xe2\x80\x99ve surrendered,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cThis moral suasion\r\nbiznai takes it out of a chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see how gentle we\xe2\x80\x99ve been? We might have called Clewer in to\r\nlook at you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The bleatin\xe2\x80\x99 of the tiger excites the kid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut we didn\xe2\x80\x99t. We\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to tell a few chaps in Coll. about this\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99d be hooted all over the shop. Your life wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be worth\r\nhavin\xe2\x80\x99. But we aren\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do that, either. We\xe2\x80\x99re strictly moral\r\nsuasers, Campbell; so, unless you or Seffy split about this, no one\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear you\xe2\x80\x99re a brick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Campbell. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I was rather a brute\r\nto Clewer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looked like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Seffy need come\r\ninto hall with cock-eye whiskers. Horrid bad for the fags if they saw\r\nhim. He can shave. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you grateful, Sefton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe head did not lift. Sefton was deeply asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s rummy,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, as a snore mixed with a sob. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Cheek, _I_\r\nthink; or else he\xe2\x80\x99s shammin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, \xe2\x80\x99tisn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98When \xe2\x80\x98Molly\xe2\x80\x99 Fairburn had attended to me\r\nfor an hour or so I used to go bung off to sleep on a form sometimes.\r\nPoor devil! But he called me a beastly poet, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, come on.\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky lowered his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Campbell. \xe2\x80\x99Member,\r\nif you don\xe2\x80\x99t talk, nobody will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere should have been a war-dance, but that all three were so utterly\r\ntired that they almost went to sleep above the tea-cups in their study,\r\nand slept till prep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most extraordinary letter. Are all parents incurably mad? What do you\r\nmake of it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Head, handing a closely written eight pages to the\r\nReverend John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The only son of his mother, and she a widow.\xe2\x80\x99 That is the least\r\nreasonable sort.\xe2\x80\x9d The chaplain read with pursed lips. \xe2\x80\x9cIf half\r\nthose charges are true he should be in the sick-house; whereas he is\r\ndisgustingly well. Certainly he has shaved. I noticed that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder compulsion, as his mother points out. How delicious! How\r\nsalutary!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t to answer her. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t often I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what has\r\nhappened in the school; but this is beyond me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you asked me I should say seek not to propitiate. When one is forced\r\nto take crammers\xe2\x80\x99 pups--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was perfectly well at extra-tuition--with me--this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Head, absently. \xe2\x80\x9cUnusually well behaved, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--they either educate the school, or the school, as in this case,\r\neducates them. I prefer our own methods,\xe2\x80\x9d the chaplain concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think it was that?\xe2\x80\x9d A lift of the Head\xe2\x80\x99s eye-brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it! And nothing excuses his trying to give the College a\r\nbad name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the line I mean to take with him,\xe2\x80\x9d the Head answered.\r\n\r\nThe Augurs winked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few days later the Reverend John called on Number Five. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe seen you before, Padre?\xe2\x80\x9d said they.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching times and seasons and events and men--and boys,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied. \xe2\x80\x9cI am pleased with my Tenth Legion. I make them my compliments.\r\nClewer was throwing ink-balls in form this morning, instead of doing his\r\nwork. He is now doing fifty lines for--unheard-of audacity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t blame us, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou told us to remove\r\nthe--er--pressure. That\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of a fag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve known boys five years his senior throw ink-balls, Beetle. To such\r\nan one have I given two hundred lines--not so long ago. And now I come\r\nto think of it, were those lines ever shown up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere they, Turkey?\xe2\x80\x99 said Beetle unblushingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think Clewer looks a little cleaner, Padre?\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re no end of moral reformers,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all Stalky, but it was a lark,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have noticed the moral reform in several quarters. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you\r\nyou had more influence than any boys in the Coll. if you cared to use\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a trifle exhaustin\xe2\x80\x99 to use frequent--our kind of moral suasion.\r\nBesides, you see, it only makes Clewer cheeky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of Clewer; I was thinking of--the other people,\r\nStalky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother much about the other people,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cDid\r\nwe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _I_ did--from the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you knew, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA downward puff of smoke. \xe2\x80\x9cBoys educate each other, they say, more than\r\nwe can or dare. If I had used one half of the moral suasion you may or\r\nmay not have employed--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the best motives in the world. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget our pious motives,\r\nPadre,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I should be now languishing in Bideford jail, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\r\nWell, to quote the Head, in a little business which we have agreed to\r\nforget, that strikes me as flagrant injustice... What are you laughing\r\nat, you young sinners? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true? I will not stay to be shouted at.\r\nWhat I looked into this den of iniquity for was to find out if any one\r\ncared to come down for a bathe off the Ridge. But I see you won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t we, though! Half a shake, Padre Sahib, till we get our towels,\r\nand _nous sommes avec vous_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITTLE PREP.\r\n\r\n\r\nEaster term was but a month old when Stettson major, a day-boy,\r\ncontracted diphtheria, and the Head was very angry. He decreed a new and\r\nnarrower set of bounds--the infection had been traced to an out-lying\r\nfarmhouse--urged the prefects severely to lick all trespassers, and\r\npromised extra attentions from his own hand. There were no words bad\r\nenough for Stettson major, quarantined at his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, who had\r\nlowered the school-average of health. This he said in the gymnasium\r\nafter prayers. Then he wrote some two hundred letters to as many anxious\r\nparents and guardians, and bade the school carry on. The trouble did not\r\nspread, but, one night, a dog-cart drove to the Head\xe2\x80\x99s door, and in the\r\nmorning the Head had gone, leaving all things in charge of Mr. King,\r\nsenior house-master. The Head often ran up to town, where the school\r\ndevoutly believed he bribed officials for early proofs of the Army\r\nExamination papers; but this absence was unusually prolonged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDowny old bird!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky to the allies one wet afternoon in the\r\nstudy. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must have gone on a bend and been locked up under a false\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle entered joyously into the libel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForty shillin\xe2\x80\x99s or a month for hackin\xe2\x80\x99 the chucker-out of the Pavvy on\r\nthe shins. Bates always has a spree when he goes to town. Wish he\r\nwas back, though. I\xe2\x80\x99m about sick o\xe2\x80\x99 King\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98whips an\xe2\x80\x99 scorpions\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlectures on public-school spirit--yah!--and scholarship!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Crass an\xe2\x80\x99 materialized brutality of the middle-classes--readin\xe2\x80\x99 solely\r\nfor marks. Not a scholar in the whole school,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk quoted, pensively\r\nboring holes in the mantel-piece with a hot poker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s rather a sickly way of spending an afternoon. Stinks too.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s come out an\xe2\x80\x99 smoke. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a treat.\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky held up a long Indian\r\ncheroot. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Bagged it from my pater last holidays. I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit shy of it\r\nthough; it\xe2\x80\x99s heftier than a pipe. We\xe2\x80\x99ll smoke it palaver-fashion. Hand\r\nit round, eh? Let\xe2\x80\x99s lie up behind the old harrow on the Monkey-farm\r\nRoad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of bounds. Bounds beastly strict these days, too. Besides, we shall\r\ncat.\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle sniffed the cheroot critically. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a regular Pomposo\r\nStinkadore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can; I shan\xe2\x80\x99t. What d\xe2\x80\x99you say, Turkey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, may\xe2\x80\x99s well, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChuck on your cap, then. It\xe2\x80\x99s two to one. Beetle, out you come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey saw a group of boys by the notice-board in the corridor; little\r\nFoxy, the school sergeant, among them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore bounds, I expect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Foxibus, who are you in\r\nmournin\xe2\x80\x99 for?\xe2\x80\x9d There was a broad band of crape round Foxy\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was in my old regiment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Foxy, jerking his head towards the\r\nnotices, where a newspaper cutting was thumb-tacked between call-over\r\nlists.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy gum!\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Stalky, uncovering as he read. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\nDuncan--Fat-Sow Duncan--killed on duty at something or other Kotal.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Rallyin\xe2\x80\x99 his men with conspicuous gallantry._\xe2\x80\x99 He would, of course.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_The body was recovered_.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s all right. They cut \xe2\x80\x99em up sometimes,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t they, Foxy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrid,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant briefly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor old Fat-Sow! I was a fag when he left. How many does that make to\r\nus, Foxy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Duncan, he is the ninth. He come here when he was no bigger\r\nthan little Grey tertius. My old regiment, too. Yiss, nine to us, Mr.\r\nCorkran, up to date.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys went out into the wet, walking swiftly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonder how it feels--to be shot and all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, as they\r\nsplashed down a lane. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did it happen, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, out in India somewhere. We\xe2\x80\x99re always rowin\xe2\x80\x99 there. But look here,\r\nStalky, what _is_ the good o\xe2\x80\x99 sittin\xe2\x80\x99 under a hedge an\xe2\x80\x99 cattin\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbe-eastly cold. It\xe2\x80\x99s be-eastly wet, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be collared as sure as a\r\ngun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up! Did you ever know your Uncle Stalky get you into a mess yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Like many other leaders, Stalky did not dwell on past defeats. They\r\npushed through a dripping hedge, landed among water-logged clods, and\r\nsat down on a rust-coated harrow. The cheroot burned with sputterings\r\nof saltpetre. They smoked it gingerly, each passing to the other between\r\nclosed forefinger and thumb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood job we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t one apiece, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, shivering\r\nthrough set teeth. To prove his words he immediately laid all before\r\nthem, and they followed his example...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you,\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Beetle, sweating clammy drops. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Stalky, you are\r\na fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Je cat_, _tu cat_, _il cat_. _Nous cattons_!\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk handed up his\r\ncontribution and lay hopelessly on the cold iron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with the beastly thing. I say, Beetle, have you been\r\ndroppin\xe2\x80\x99 ink on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Beetle was in no case to answer. Limp and empty, they sprawled\r\nacross the harrow, the rust marking their ulsters in red squares and the\r\nabandoned cheroot-end reeking under their very cold noses. Then--they\r\nhad heard nothing--the Head himself stood before them--the Head who\r\nshould have been in town bribing examiners--the Head fantastically\r\nattired in old tweeds and a deer-stalker!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, fingering his mustache. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good. I might have guessed\r\nwho it was. You will go back to the College and give my compliments to\r\nMr. King and ask him to give you an extra-special licking. You will then\r\ndo me five hundred lines. I shall be back to-morrow. Five hundred lines\r\nby five o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-morrow. You are also gated for a week. This is not\r\nexactly the time for breaking bounds. _Extra_-special, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe disappeared over the hedge as lightly as he had come. There was a\r\nmurmur of women\xe2\x80\x99s voices in the deep lane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you Prooshan brute!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk as the voices died away. \xe2\x80\x9cStalky,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all your silly fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKill him! Kill him!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ca-an\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to cat again... I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that, but King\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngloat over us horrid. Extra-special, ooh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStalky made no answer--not even a soft one. They went to College and\r\nreceived that for which they had been sent. King enjoyed himself most\r\nthoroughly, for by virtue of their seniority the boys were exempt from\r\nhis hand, save under special order. Luckily, he was no expert in the\r\ngentle art.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Strange, how desire doth outrun performance,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle\r\nirreverently, quoting from some Shakespeare play that they were cramming\r\nthat term. They regained their study and settled down to the imposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite right, Beetle.\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky spoke in silky and propitiating\r\ntones. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, if the Head had sent us up to a prefect, we\xe2\x80\x99d have got\r\nsomething to remember!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk began with cold venom, \xe2\x80\x9cwe aren\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 to row you\r\nabout this business, because it\xe2\x80\x99s too bad for a row; but we want you\r\nto understand you\xe2\x80\x99re jolly well excommunicated, Stalky. You\xe2\x80\x99re a plain\r\nass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was I to know that the Head \xe2\x80\x99ud collar us? What was he doin\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nthose ghastly clothes, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to raise a side-issue,\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle grunted severely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was all Stettson major\xe2\x80\x99s fault. If he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone an\xe2\x80\x99 got\r\ndiphtheria \xe2\x80\x99twouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it rather\r\nrummy--the Head droppin\xe2\x80\x99 on us that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up! You\xe2\x80\x99re dead!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve chopped your spurs off your\r\nbeastly heels. We\xe2\x80\x99ve cocked your shield upside down and---and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink you ought to be allowed to brew for a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, stop jawin\xe2\x80\x99 at me. I want--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop? Why--why, we\xe2\x80\x99re gated for a week.\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk almost howled as the\r\nagony of the situation overcame him. \xe2\x80\x9cA lickin\xe2\x80\x99 from King, five hundred\r\nlines, _and_ a gatin\xe2\x80\x99. D\xe2\x80\x99you expect us to kiss you, Stalky, you beast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrop rottin\xe2\x80\x99 for a minute. I want to find out about the Head bein\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhere he was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you have. You found him quite well and fit. Found him makin\xe2\x80\x99 love\r\nto Stettson major\xe2\x80\x99s mother. That was her in the lane--I heard her. And\r\nso we were ordered a lickin\xe2\x80\x99 before a day-boy\xe2\x80\x99s mother. Bony old widow,\r\ntoo,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything else you\xe2\x80\x99d like to find out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I swear I\xe2\x80\x99ll get even with him some day,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky growled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooks like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cExtra-special, week\xe2\x80\x99s gatin\xe2\x80\x99 and five\r\nhundred... and now you\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to row about it! Help scrag him,\r\nBeetle!\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky had thrown his Virgil at them.\r\n\r\nThe Head returned next day without explanation, to find the lines\r\nwaiting for him and the school a little relaxed under Mr. King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nviceroyalty. Mr. King had been talking at and round and over the boys\xe2\x80\x99\r\nheads, in a lofty and promiscuous style, of public-school spirit and the\r\ntraditions of ancient seats; for he always improved an occasion. Beyond\r\nwaking in two hundred and fifty young hearts a lively hatred of all\r\nother foundations, he accomplished little--so little, indeed, that when,\r\ntwo days after the Head\xe2\x80\x99s return, he chanced to come across Stalky &\r\nCo., gated but ever resourceful, playing marbles in the corridor, he\r\nsaid that he was not surprised--not in the least surprised. This was\r\nwhat he had expected from persons of their _morale_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any rule against marbles, sir. Very interestin\xe2\x80\x99 game,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Beetle, his knees white with chalk and dust. Then he received\r\ntwo hundred lines for insolence, besides an order to go to the nearest\r\nprefect for judgment and slaughter.\r\n\r\nThis is what happened behind the closed doors of Flint\xe2\x80\x99s study, and\r\nFlint was then Head of the Games:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I say, Flint. King has sent me to you for playin\xe2\x80\x99 marbles in the\r\ncorridor an\xe2\x80\x99 shoutin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98alley tor\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98knuckle down.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he suppose I have to do with that?\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDunno. Well?\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle grinned wickedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to tell him? He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrather wrathy about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Head chooses to put a notice in the corridor forbiddin\xe2\x80\x99 marbles,\r\nI can do something; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t move on a house-master\xe2\x80\x99s report. He\r\nknows that as well as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sense of this oracle Beetle conveyed, all unsweetened, to King, who\r\nhastened to interview Flint.\r\n\r\nNow Flint had been seven and a half years at the College, counting six\r\nmonths with a London crammer, from whose roof he had returned, homesick,\r\nto the Head for the final Army polish. There were four or five other\r\nseniors who had gone through much the same mill, not to mention\r\nboys, rejected by other establishments on account of a certain\r\noverwhelmingness, whom the Head had wrought into very fair shape. It was\r\nnot a Sixth to be handled without gloves, as King found.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to understand it is your intention to allow board-school games\r\nunder your study windows, Flint? If so, I can only say--\xe2\x80\x9d He said much,\r\nand Flint listened politely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, if the Head sees fit to call a prefects\xe2\x80\x99 meeting we are\r\nbound to take the matter up. But the tradition of the school is that the\r\nprefects can\xe2\x80\x99t move in any matter affecting the whole school without the\r\nHead\xe2\x80\x99s direct order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch more was then delivered, both sides a little losing their temper.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, at an informal gathering of prefects in his study, Flint\r\nrelated the adventure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been playin\xe2\x80\x99 for this for a week, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s got it. You know as\r\nwell as I do that if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been gassing at us the way he has, that\r\nyoung devil Beetle wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have dreamed of marbles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perowne, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the question. On\r\nFlint\xe2\x80\x99s showin\xe2\x80\x99 King has called the prefects names enough to justify\r\na first-class row. Crammers\xe2\x80\x99 rejections, ill-regulated hobble-de-hoys,\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Now it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for prefects--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Flint. \xe2\x80\x9cKing\xe2\x80\x99s the best classical cram we\xe2\x80\x99ve got; and\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tisn\xe2\x80\x99t fair to bother the Head with a row. He\xe2\x80\x99s up to his eyes with\r\nextra-tu and Army work as it is. Besides, as I told King, we _aren\xe2\x80\x99t_ a\r\npublic school. We\xe2\x80\x99re a limited liability company payin\xe2\x80\x99 four per cent.\r\nMy father\xe2\x80\x99s a shareholder, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that got to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Venner, a red-headed boy of\r\nnineteen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, seems to me that we should be interferin\xe2\x80\x99 with ourselves. We\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to get into the Army or--get out, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we? King\xe2\x80\x99s hired by the\r\nCouncil to teach us. All the rest\xe2\x80\x99s gumdiddle. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt might have been because he felt the air was a little thunderous that\r\nthe Head took his after-dinner cheroot to Flint\xe2\x80\x99s study; but he so\r\noften began an evening in a prefect\xe2\x80\x99s room that nobody suspected when he\r\ndrifted in pensively, after the knocks that etiquette demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrefects\xe2\x80\x99 meeting?\xe2\x80\x9d A cock of one wise eye-brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly, sir; we\xe2\x80\x99re just talking things over. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you take the\r\neasy chair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks. Luxurious infants, you are.\xe2\x80\x9d He dropped into Flint\xe2\x80\x99s big\r\nhalf-couch and puffed for a while in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, since you\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nhere, I may confess that I\xe2\x80\x99m the mute with the bowstring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young faces grew serious. The phrase meant that certain of their\r\nnumber would be withdrawn from all further games for extra-tuition. It\r\nmight also mean future success at Sandhurst; but it was present ruin for\r\nthe First Fifteen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve come for my pound of flesh. I ought to have had you out\r\nbefore the Exeter match; but it\xe2\x80\x99s our sacred duty to beat Exeter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t the Old Boys\xe2\x80\x99 match sacred, too, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Perowne. The Old\r\nBoys\xe2\x80\x99 match was the event of the Easter term.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll hope they aren\xe2\x80\x99t in training. Now for the list. First I want\r\nFlint. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Euclid that does it. You must work deductions with me.\r\nPerowne, extra mechanical drawing. Dawson goes to Mr. King for extra\r\nLatin, and Venner to me for German. Have I damaged the First Fifteen\r\nmuch?\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled sweetly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuined it, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Flint. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you let us off till the\r\nend of the term?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible. It will be a tight squeeze for Sandhurst this year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all to be cut up by those vile Afghans, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dawson.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99d be so much competition, would you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that reminds me. Crandall is coming down with the Old Boys--I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nasked twenty of them, but we shan\xe2\x80\x99t get more than a weak team. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll be much use, though. He was rather knocked about,\r\nrecovering poor old Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrandall major--the Gunner?\xe2\x80\x9d Perowne asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the minor--\xe2\x80\x98Toffee\xe2\x80\x99 Crandall--in a native infantry regiment. He was\r\nalmost before your time, Perowne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe papers didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about him. We read about Fat-Sow, of\r\ncourse. What\xe2\x80\x99s Crandall done, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve brought over an Indian paper that his mother sent me. It was\r\nrather a--hefty, I think you say--piece of work. Shall I read it?\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nHead knew how to read. When he had finished the quarter-column of close\r\ntype everybody thanked him politely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood for the old Coll.!\xe2\x80\x9d said Perowne. \xe2\x80\x9cPity he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in time to save\r\nFat-Sow, though. That\xe2\x80\x99s nine to us, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, in the last three years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... And I took old Duncan off all games for extra-tu five years ago\r\nthis term,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Head. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, who do you hand over the Games\r\nto, Flint?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t thought yet. Who\xe2\x80\x99d you recommend, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it casually hinted behind my back that the\r\nProoshan Bates is a downy bird, but he isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to make himself\r\nresponsible for a new Head of the Games. Settle it among yourselves.\r\nGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s the man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Flint, when the door shut, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you want to\r\nbother with a dame\xe2\x80\x99s school row.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only pullin\xe2\x80\x99 your fat leg,\xe2\x80\x9d Perowne returned, hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so\r\neasy to draw, Flint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind that. The Head\xe2\x80\x99s knocked the First Fifteen to bits,\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to pick up the pieces, or the Old Boys will have a\r\nwalk-over. Let\xe2\x80\x99s promote all the Second Fifteen and make Big Side play\r\nup. There\xe2\x80\x99s heaps of talent somewhere that we can polish up between now\r\nand the match.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe case was represented so urgently to the school that even Stalky\r\nand McTurk, who affected to despise football, played one Big-Side game\r\nseriously. They were forthwith promoted ere their ardor had time to\r\ncool, and the dignity of their Caps demanded that they should keep some\r\nshow of virtue. The match-team was worked at least four days out of\r\nseven, and the school saw hope ahead.\r\n\r\nWith the last week of the term the Old Boys began to arrive, and their\r\nwelcome was nicely proportioned to their worth. Gentlemen cadets from\r\nSandhurst and Woolwich, who had only left a year ago, but who carried\r\nenormous side, were greeted with a cheerful \xe2\x80\x9cHullo! What\xe2\x80\x99s the Shop\r\nlike?\xe2\x80\x9d from those who had shared their studies. Militia subalterns had\r\nmore consideration, but it was understood they were not precisely of the\r\ntrue metal. Recreants who, failing for the Army, had gone into business\r\nor banks were received for old sake\xe2\x80\x99s sake, but in no way made too much\r\nof. But when the real subalterns, officers and gentlemen full-blown--who\r\nhad been to the ends of the earth and back again and so carried no\r\nside--came on the scene strolling about with the Head, the school\r\ndivided right and left in admiring silence. And when one laid hands on\r\nFlint, even upon the Head of the Games crying, \xe2\x80\x9cGood Heavens! What do\r\nyou mean by growing in this way? You were a beastly little fag when I\r\nleft,\xe2\x80\x9d visible haloes encircled Flint. They would walk to and fro in\r\nthe corridor with the little red school-sergeant, telling news of old\r\nregiments; they would burst into form-rooms sniffing the well-remembered\r\nsmells of ink and whitewash; they would find nephews and cousins in the\r\nlower forms and present them with enormous wealth; or they would invade\r\nthe gymnasium and make Foxy show off the new stock on the bars.\r\n\r\nChiefly, though, they talked with the Head, who was father-confessor\r\nand agent-general to them all; for what they shouted in their unthinking\r\nyouth, they proved in their thoughtless manhood--to wit, that the\r\nProoshan Bates was \xe2\x80\x9ca downy bird.\xe2\x80\x9d Young blood who had stumbled into an\r\nentanglement with a pastry-cook\xe2\x80\x99s daughter at Plymouth; experience who\r\nhad come into a small legacy but mistrusted lawyers; ambition halting\r\nat cross-roads, anxious to take the one that would lead him farthest;\r\nextravagance pursued by the money-lender; arrogance in the thick of a\r\nregimental row--each carried his trouble to the Head; and Chiron showed\r\nhim, in language quite unfit for little boys, a quiet and safe way\r\nround, out, or under. So they overflowed his house, smoked his cigars,\r\nand drank his health as they had drunk it all the earth over when two or\r\nthree of the old school had foregathered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stop smoking for a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more you\xe2\x80\x99re out\r\nof training the better for us. I\xe2\x80\x99ve demoralized the First Fifteen with\r\nextra-tu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but we\xe2\x80\x99re a scratch lot. Have you told \xe2\x80\x99em we shall need a\r\nsubstitute even if Crandall can play?\xe2\x80\x9d said a Lieutenant of Engineers\r\nwith a D.S.O. to his credit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wrote me he\xe2\x80\x99d play, so he can\xe2\x80\x99t have been much hurt. He\xe2\x80\x99s coming\r\ndown to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrandall minor that was, and brought off poor Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s body?\xe2\x80\x9d The Head\r\nnodded. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to put him? We\xe2\x80\x99ve turned you out of house\r\nand home already, Head Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d This was a Squadron Commander of Bengal\r\nLancers, home on leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go up to his old dormitory. You know old boys\r\ncan claim that privilege. Yes, I think little Crandall minor must bed\r\ndown there once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBates Sahib \xe2\x80\x9c--a Gunner flung a heavy arm round the Head\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck--\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got something up your sleeve. Confess! I know that\r\ntwinkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you see, you cuckoo?\xe2\x80\x9d a Submarine Miner interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cCrandall\r\ngoes up to the dormitory as an object-lesson, for moral effect and so\r\nforth. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that true, Head Sahib?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is. You know too much, Purvis. I licked you for that in \xe2\x80\x9979.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did, sir, and it\xe2\x80\x99s my private belief you chalked the cane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN-no. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve a very straight eye. Perhaps that misled you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat opened the flood-gates of fresh memories, and they all told tales\r\nout of school.\r\n\r\nWhen Crandall minor that was--Lieutenant R. Crandall of an ordinary\r\nIndian regiment--arrived from Exeter on the morning of the match, he\r\nwas cheered along the whole front of the College, for the prefects\r\nhad repeated the sense of that which the Head had read them in Flint\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstudy. When Prout\xe2\x80\x99s house understood that he would claim his Old Boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright to a bed for one night, Beetle ran into King\xe2\x80\x99s house next door\r\nand executed a public \xe2\x80\x9cgloat\xe2\x80\x9d up and down the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s big form-room,\r\ndeparting in a haze of ink-pots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you take any notice of those rotters for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky,\r\nplaying substitute for the Old Boys, magnificent in black jersey, white\r\nknickers, and black stockings. \xe2\x80\x9cI talked to _him_ up in the dormitory\r\nwhen he was changin\xe2\x80\x99. Pulled his sweater down for him. He\xe2\x80\x99s cut about\r\nall over the arms--horrid purply ones. He\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to tell us about it\r\nto-night. I asked him to when I was lacin\xe2\x80\x99 his boots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you _have_ got cheek,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, enviously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlipped out before I thought. But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit angry. He\xe2\x80\x99s no end of\r\na chap. I swear, I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to play up like beans. Tell Turkey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe technique of that match belongs to a bygone age. Scrimmages were\r\ntight and enduring; hacking was direct and to the purpose; and around\r\nthe scrimmage stood the school, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cPut down your heads and shove!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Toward the end everybody lost all sense of decency, and mothers of\r\nday-boys too close to the touch-line heard language not included in the\r\nbills. No one was actually carried off the field, but both sides felt\r\nhappier when time was called, and Beetle helped Stalky and McTurk into\r\ntheir overcoats. The two had met in the many-legged heart of things,\r\nand, as Stalky said, had \xe2\x80\x9cdone each other proud.\xe2\x80\x9d As they swaggered\r\nwoodenly behind the teams--substitutes do not rank as equals of hairy\r\nmen--they passed a pony-carriage near the wall, and a husky voice cried,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell played. Oh, played indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d It was Stettson major, white-checked\r\nand hollow-eyed, who had fought his way to the ground under escort of an\r\nimpatient coachman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Stettson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, checking. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it safe to come near you\r\nyet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. I\xe2\x80\x99m all right. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me out before, but I had to\r\ncome to the match. Your mouth looks pretty plummy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurkey trod on it accidental-done-a-purpose. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nbetter, because we owe you something. You and your membranes got us into\r\na sweet mess, young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, giggling. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Head told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDooce he did! When?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come on up to Coll. My shin\xe2\x80\x99ll stiffen if we stay jawin\xe2\x80\x99 here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up, Turkey. I want to find out about this. Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was stayin\xe2\x80\x99 at our house all the time I was ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for? Neglectin\xe2\x80\x99 the Coll. that way? \xe2\x80\x99Thought he was in town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was off my head, you know, and they said I kept on callin\xe2\x80\x99 for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheek! You\xe2\x80\x99re only a day-boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came just the same, and he about saved my life. I was all bunged up\r\none night--just goin\xe2\x80\x99 to croak, the doctor said--and they stuck a tube\r\nor somethin\xe2\x80\x99 in my throat, and the Head sucked out the stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh! \xe2\x80\x99Shot if _I_ would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to have got diphtheria himself, the doctor said. So he stayed\r\non at our house instead of going back. I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 croaked in another twenty\r\nminutes, the doctor says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the coachman, being under orders, whipped up and nearly ran over\r\nthe three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Hat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s pretty average heroic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty average!\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk\xe2\x80\x99s knee in the small of his back cannoned him\r\ninto Stalky, who punted him back. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be hung!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Head ought to get the V.C.,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he might have\r\nbeen dead _and_ buried by now. But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Ho! ho! He\r\njust nipped through the hedge like a lusty old blackbird. Extra-special,\r\nfive hundred lines, an\xe2\x80\x99 gated for a week--all sereno!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve read o\xe2\x80\x99 somethin\xe2\x80\x99 like that in a book,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cGummy, what\r\na chap! Just think of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk; and he delivered a wild Irish yell that\r\nmade the team turn round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut your fat mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, dancing with impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave it\r\nto your Uncle Stalky, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have the Head on toast. If you say\r\na word, Beetle, till I give you leave, I swear I\xe2\x80\x99ll slay you.\r\n_Habeo Capitem crinibus minimis._ I\xe2\x80\x99ve got him by the short hairs! Now\r\nlook as if nothing had happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no need of guile. The school was too busy cheering the drawn\r\nmatch. It hung round the lavatories regardless of muddy boots while the\r\nteam washed. It cheered Crandall minor whenever it caught sight of him,\r\nand it cheered more wildly than ever after prayers, because the Old Boys\r\nin evening dress, openly twirling their mustaches, attended, and\r\ninstead of standing with the masters, ranged themselves along the\r\nwall immediately before the prefects; and the Head called them over,\r\ntoo--majors, minors, and tertiuses, after their old names.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his guests after dinner, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the\r\nboys are getting a little out of hand. There will be trouble and sorrow\r\nlater, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid. You\xe2\x80\x99d better turn in early, Crandall. The dormitory\r\nwill be sitting up for you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know to what dizzy heights you may\r\nclimb in your profession, but I do know you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get such absolute\r\nadoration as you\xe2\x80\x99re getting now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound the adoration. I want to finish my cigar, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all pure gold. Go where glory waits, Crandall--minor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe setting of that apotheosis was a ten-bed attic dormitory,\r\ncommunicating through doorless openings with three others. The gas\r\nflickered over the raw pine washstands. There was an incessant\r\nwhistling of drafts, and outside the naked windows the sea beat on the\r\nPebbleridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSame old bed--same old mattress, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Crandall, yawning.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSame old everything. Oh, but I\xe2\x80\x99m lame! I\xe2\x80\x99d no notion you chaps could\r\nplay like this.\xe2\x80\x9d He caressed a battered shin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve given us all\r\nsomething to remember you by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt needed a few minutes to put them at their ease; and, in some way they\r\ncould not understand, they were more easy when Crandall turned round and\r\nsaid his prayers--a ceremony he had neglected for some years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I _am_ sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten to put out the gas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t bother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prefect of the dormitory. \xe2\x80\x9cWorthington\r\ndoes that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA nightgowned twelve-year-old, who had been waiting to show off, leaped\r\nfrom his bed to the bracket and back again, by way of a washstand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you manage when he\xe2\x80\x99s asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d said Crandall, chuckling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShove a cold cleek down his neck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a wet sponge when I was junior in the dormitory... Hullo! What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe darkness had filled with whispers, the sound of trailing rugs, bare\r\nfeet on bare boards, protests, giggles, and threats such as:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet, you ass!... _Squattez-vous_ on the floor, then!... I swear\r\nyou aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to sit on _my_ bed!... Mind the tooth-glass,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSta--Corkran said,\xe2\x80\x9d the prefect began, his tone showing his sense of\r\nStalky\xe2\x80\x99s insolence, \xe2\x80\x9cthat perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d tell us about that business\r\nwith Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--yes--yes,\xe2\x80\x9d ran the keen whispers. \xe2\x80\x9cTell us\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to tell. What on earth are you chaps hoppin\xe2\x80\x99 about in\r\nthe cold for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voices. \xe2\x80\x9cTell about Fat-Sow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Crandall turned on his pillow and spoke to the generation he could\r\nnot see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, about three months ago he was commanding a treasure-guard--a cart\r\nfull of rupees to pay troops with--five thousand rupees in silver. He\r\nwas comin\xe2\x80\x99 to a place called Fort Pearson, near Kalabagh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was born there,\xe2\x80\x9d squeaked a small fag. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was called after my\r\nuncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up--you and your uncle! Never mind him, Crandall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ne\xe2\x80\x99er mind. The Afridis found out that this treasure was on the\r\nmove, and they ambushed the whole show a couple of miles before he got\r\nto the fort, and cut up the escort. Duncan was wounded, and the escort\r\nhooked it. There weren\xe2\x80\x99t more than twenty Sepoys all told, and there\r\nwere any amount of Afridis. As things turned out, I was in charge at\r\nFort Pearson. Fact was, I\xe2\x80\x99d heard the firing and was just going to see\r\nabout it, when Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s men came up. So we all turned back together.\r\nThey told me something about an officer, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the hang of\r\nthings till I saw a chap under the wheels of the cart out in the open,\r\npropped up on one arm, blazing away with a revolver. You see, the escort\r\nhad abandoned the cart, and the Afridis--they\xe2\x80\x99re an awfully suspicious\r\ngang--thought the retreat was a trap--sort of draw, you know--and the\r\ncart was the bait. So they had left poor old Duncan alone. \xe2\x80\x99Minute they\r\nspotted how few we were, it was a race across the flat who should reach\r\nold Duncan first. We ran, and they ran, and we won, and after a little\r\nhackin\xe2\x80\x99 about they pulled off. I never knew it was one of us till I was\r\nright on top of him. There are heaps of Duncans in the service, and of\r\ncourse the name didn\xe2\x80\x99t remind me. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed at all hardly. He\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen shot through the lungs, poor old man, and he was pretty thirsty.\r\nI gave him a drink and sat down beside him, and--funny thing, too--he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Hullo, Toffee!\xe2\x80\x99 and I said, \xe2\x80\x98Hullo, Fat-Sow! hope you aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhurt,\xe2\x80\x99 or something of the kind. But he died in a minute or two--never\r\nlifted his head off my knees... I say, you chaps out there will get your\r\ndeath of cold. Better go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. In a minute. But your cuts--your cuts. How did you get\r\nwounded?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was when we were taking the body back to the Fort. They came on\r\nagain, and there was a bit of a scrimmage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you kill any one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night. Thank you, Crandall. Thanks awf\xe2\x80\x99ly, Crandall. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unseen crowds withdrew. His own dormitory rustled into bed and lay\r\nsilent for a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Crandall\xe2\x80\x9d--Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s voice was tuned to a wholly foreign\r\nreverence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose a chap found another chap croaking with diphtheria--all bunged\r\nup with it--and they stuck a tube in his throat and the chap sucked the\r\nstuff out, what would you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Crandall, reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only heard of one case, and\r\nthat was a doctor. He did it for a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a woman. It was just a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMakes it all the finer, then. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the bravest thing a man can\r\ndo. Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I heard of a chap doin\xe2\x80\x99 it. That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he\xe2\x80\x99s a brave man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould _you_ funk it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRa-ather. Anybody would. Fancy dying of diphtheria in cold blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--ah! Er! Look here!\xe2\x80\x9d The sentence ended in a grunt, for Stalky had\r\nleaped out of bed and with McTurk was sitting on the head of Beetle, who\r\nwould have sprung the mine there and then.\r\n\r\nNext day, which was the last of the term and given up to a few wholly\r\nunimportant examinations, began with wrath and war. Mr. King had\r\ndiscovered that nearly all his house--it lay, as you know, next door but\r\none to Prout\xe2\x80\x99s in the long range of buildings--had unlocked the doors\r\nbetween the dormitories and had gone in to listen to a story told by\r\nCrandall. He went to the Head, clamorous, injured, appealing; for\r\nhe never approved of allowing so-called young men of the world to\r\ncontaminate the morals of boyhood. Very good, said the Head, he would\r\nattend to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m awf\xe2\x80\x99ly sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Crandall guiltily. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I told\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em anything they oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to hear. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let them get into trouble on\r\nmy account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTck!\xe2\x80\x9d the Head answered, with the ghost of a wink. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t the boys\r\nthat make trouble; it\xe2\x80\x99s the masters. However, Prout and King don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\napprove of dormitory gatherings on this scale, and one must back up the\r\nhouse-masters. Moreover, it\xe2\x80\x99s hopeless to punish two houses only, so\r\nlate in the term. We must be fair and include everybody. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. They\r\nhave a holiday task for the Easters, which, of course, none of them\r\nwill ever look at. We will give the whole school, except prefects and\r\nstudy-boys, regular prep. to-night; and the Common-room will have to\r\nsupply a master to take it. We must be fair to all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrep. on the last night of the term. Whew!\xe2\x80\x9d said Crandall, thinking of\r\nhis own wild youth. \xe2\x80\x9cI fancy there will be larks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe school, frolicking among packed trunks, whooping down the corridor,\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cgloating\xe2\x80\x9d in form-rooms, received the news with amazement and rage.\r\nNo school in the world did prep. on the last night of the term. This\r\nthing was monstrous, tyrannical, subversive of law, religion, and\r\nmorality. They would go into the form-rooms, and they would take their\r\ndegraded holiday task with them, but--here they smiled and speculated\r\nwhat manner of man the Common-room would send up against them. The lot\r\nfell on Mason, credulous and enthusiastic, who loved youth. No other\r\nmaster was anxious to take that \xe2\x80\x9cprep.,\xe2\x80\x9d for the school lacked the\r\nsteadying influence of tradition; and men accustomed to the ordered\r\nroutine of ancient foundations found it occasionally insubordinate. The\r\nfour long form-rooms, in which all below the rank of study-boys worked,\r\nreceived him with thunders of applause. Ere he had coughed twice they\r\nfavored him with a metrical summary of the marriage laws of Great\r\nBritain, as recorded by the High Priest of the Israelites and commented\r\non by the leader of the host. The lower forms reminded him that it was\r\nthe last day, and that therefore he must \xe2\x80\x9ctake it all in play.\xe2\x80\x9d When he\r\ndashed off to rebuke them, the Lower Fourth and Upper Third began with\r\none accord to be sick, loudly and realistically. Mr. Mason tried, of all\r\nvain things under heaven, to argue with them, and a bold soul at a\r\nback desk bade him \xe2\x80\x9ctake fifty lines for not \xe2\x80\x99olding up \xe2\x80\x99is \xe2\x80\x99and before\r\nspeaking.\xe2\x80\x9d As one who prided himself upon the perfection of his English\r\nthis cut Mason to the quick, and while he was trying to discover the\r\noffender, the Upper and Lower Second, three form-rooms away, turned out\r\nthe gas and threw ink-pots. It was a pleasant and stimulating \xe2\x80\x9cprep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The study-boys and prefects heard the echoes of it far off, and the\r\nCommon-room at dessert smiled.\r\n\r\nStalky waited, watch in hand, till half-past eight. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it goes on much\r\nlonger the Head will come up,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the studies first,\r\nand then the dorm-rooms. Look sharp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe allowed no time for Beetle to be dramatic or McTurk to drawl. They\r\npoured into study after study, told their tale, and went again so soon\r\nas they saw they were understood, waiting for no comment; while the\r\nnoise of that unholy \xe2\x80\x9cprep.\xe2\x80\x9d grew and deepened. By the door of Flint\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstudy they met Mason flying towards the corridor.--\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone to fetch\r\nthe Head. Hurry up! Come on!\xe2\x80\x9d They broke into Number Twelve form-room\r\nabreast and panting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Head! The Head! The Head!\xe2\x80\x9d That call stilled the tumult for a\r\nminute, and Stalky, leaping to a desk, shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cHe went and sucked the\r\ndiphtheria stuff out of Stettson major\xe2\x80\x99s throat when we thought he was\r\nin town. Stop rotting, you asses! Stettson major would have croaked if\r\nthe Head hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done it. The Head might have died himself. Crandall\r\nsays it\xe2\x80\x99s the bravest thing any livin\xe2\x80\x99 man can do, and I\xe2\x80\x9d--his voice\r\ncracked--\xe2\x80\x9cthe Head don\xe2\x80\x99t know we know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMcTurk and Beetle, jumping from desk to desk, drove the news home among\r\nthe junior forms. There was a pause, and then, Mason behind him, the\r\nHead entered. It was in the established order of things that no boy\r\nshould speak or move under his eye. He expected the hush of awe. He was\r\nreceived with cheers--steady, ceaseless cheering. Being a wise man, he\r\nwent away, and the forms were silent and a little frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t do much. \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t as if you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\npulled the desks up like we did when old Carleton took prep. once. Keep\r\nit up! Hear \xe2\x80\x99em cheering in the studies!\xe2\x80\x9d He rocketed out with a yell,\r\nto find Flint and the prefects lifting the roof off the corridor.\r\n\r\nWhen the Head of a limited liability company, paying four per cent., is\r\ncheered on his saintly way to prayers, not only by four form-rooms of\r\nboys waiting punishment, but by his trusted prefects, he can either\r\nask for an explanation or go his road with dignity, while the senior\r\nhouse-master glares like an excited cat and points out to a white and\r\ntrembling mathematical master that certain methods--not his, thank\r\nGod---usually produce certain results. Out of delicacy the Old Boys\r\ndid not attend that call-over; and it was to the school drawn up in the\r\ngymnasium that the Head spoke icily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not often that I do not understand you; but I confess I do not\r\nto-night. Some of you, after your idiotic performances at prep., seem to\r\nthink me a fit person to cheer. I am going to show you that I am not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrash--crash--crash--came the triple cheer that disproved it, and the\r\nHead glowered under the gas. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is enough. You will gain nothing. The\r\nlittle boys (the Lower School did not like that form of address) will do\r\nme three hundred lines apiece in the holidays. I shall take no further\r\nnotice of them. The Upper School will do me one thousand lines apiece in\r\nthe holidays, to be shown up the evening of the day they come back. And\r\nfurther--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGummy, what a glutton!\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor your behavior towards Mr. Mason I intend to lick the whole of the\r\nUpper School to-morrow when I give you your journey-money. This will\r\ninclude the three study-boys I found dancing on the form-room desks when\r\nI came up. Prefects will stay after call-over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe school filed out in silence, but gathered in groups by the gymnasium\r\ndoor waiting what might befall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Flint,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Head, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you be good enough to give me\r\nsome explanation of your conduct?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Flint desperately, \xe2\x80\x9cif you save a chap\xe2\x80\x99s life at the\r\nrisk of your own when he\xe2\x80\x99s dyin\xe2\x80\x99 of diphtheria, and the Coll. finds it\r\nout, wha-what can you expect, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm, I see. Then that noise was not meant for--ah, cheek. I can connive\r\nat immorality, but I cannot stand impudence. However, it does not excuse\r\ntheir insolence to Mr. Mason. I\xe2\x80\x99ll forego the lines this once, remember;\r\nbut the lickings hold good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen this news was made public, the school, lost in wonder and\r\nadmiration, gasped at the Head as he went to his house. Here was a man\r\nto be reverenced. On the rare occasions when he caned he did it\r\nvery scientifically, and the execution of a hundred boys would be\r\nepic--immense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, Head Sahib. _We_ know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Crandall, as the Head\r\nslipped off his gown with a grunt in his smoking-room. \xe2\x80\x9cI found out just\r\nnow from our substitute. He was gettin\xe2\x80\x99 my opinion of your performance\r\nlast night in the dormitory. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know then that it was you he was\r\ntalkin\xe2\x80\x99 about. Crafty young animal. Freckled chap with eyes---Corkran, I\r\nthink his name is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know _him_, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Head, and reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cYe-es,\r\nI should have included them even if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the old Coll. weren\xe2\x80\x99t a little above themselves already, we\xe2\x80\x99d chair\r\nyou down the corridor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bates, how could you?\r\nYou might have caught it yourself, and where would we have been, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always knew you were worth twenty of us any day. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the Squadron Commander, looking round for contradictions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t fit to manage a school, though. Promise you\xe2\x80\x99ll never do it\r\nagain, Bates Sahib. We--we can\xe2\x80\x99t go away comfy in our minds if you take\r\nthese risks,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Gunner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBates Sahib, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t ever goin\xe2\x80\x99 to cane the whole Upper School, are\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d said Crandall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can connive at immorality, as I said, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand impudence.\r\nMason\xe2\x80\x99s lot is quite hard enough even when I back him. Besides, the\r\nmen at the golf-club heard them singing \xe2\x80\x98Aaron and Moses.\xe2\x80\x99 I shall have\r\ncomplaints about that from the parents of day-boys. Decency must be\r\npreserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re coming to help,\xe2\x80\x9d said all the guests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Upper School were caned one after the other, their overcoats over\r\ntheir arms, the brakes waiting in the road below to take them to the\r\nstation, their journey-money on the table. The Head began with Stalky,\r\nMcTurk, and Beetle. He dealt faithfully by them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s your journey-money. Good-by, and pleasant holidays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by. Thank you, sir. Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey shook hands. \xe2\x80\x9cDesire don\xe2\x80\x99t outrun performance--much--this mornin\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nWe got the cream of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cNow wait till a few chaps come\r\nout, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll really cheer him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t wait on our account, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Crandall, speaking for the Old\r\nBoys. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to begin now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was very well so long as the cheering was confined to the corridor,\r\nbut when it spread to the gymnasium, when the boys awaiting their\r\nturn cheered, the Head gave it up in despair, and the remnant flung\r\nthemselves upon him to shake hands. Then they seriously devoted\r\nthemselves to cheering till the brakes were hustled off the premises in\r\ndumb-show.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I say I\xe2\x80\x99d get even with him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky on the box-seat, as\r\nthey swung into the narrow Northam street. \xe2\x80\x9cNow all together--takin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntime from your Uncle Stalky:\r\n\r\n   It\xe2\x80\x99s a way we have in the Army,\r\n   It\xe2\x80\x99s a way we have in the Navy,\r\n   It\xe2\x80\x99s a way we have at the Public Schools,\r\n   Which nobody can deny!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLAG OF THEIR COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was winter and bitter cold of mornings. Consequently Stalky and\r\nBeetle--McTurk being of the offensive type that makes ornate toilet\r\nunder all circumstances--drowsed till the last moment before turning out\r\nto call-over in the gas-lit gymnasium. It followed that they were often\r\nlate; and since every unpunctuality earned them a black mark, and since\r\nthree black marks a week meant defaulters\xe2\x80\x99 drill, equally it followed\r\nthat they spent hours under the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Foxy drilled the\r\ndefaulters with all the pomp of his old parade-ground. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nany pleasure to me\xe2\x80\x9d (his introduction never varied). \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d much sooner\r\nbe smoking a quiet pipe in my own quarters--but I see we \xe2\x80\x99ave the Old\r\nBrigade on our \xe2\x80\x99ands this afternoon. If I only \xe2\x80\x99ad you regular, Muster\r\nCorkran,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, dressing the line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had me for nearly six weeks, you old glutton. Number off from\r\nthe right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot _quite_ so previous, please. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking this drill. Left,\r\nhalf--turn! Slow--march.\xe2\x80\x9d Twenty-five sluggards, all old offenders,\r\nfiled into the gymnasium. \xe2\x80\x9cQuietly provide yourselves with the requisite\r\ndumb-bells; returnin\xe2\x80\x99 quietly to your place. Number off from the right,\r\nin a low voice. Odd numbers one pace to the front. Even numbers stand\r\nfast. Now, leanin\xe2\x80\x99 forward from the \xe2\x80\x99ips, takin\xe2\x80\x99 your time from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dumb-bells rose and fell, clashed and were returned as one. The boys\r\nwere experts at the weary game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVe-ry good. I shall be sorry when any of you resume your \xe2\x80\x99abits of\r\npunctuality. Quietly return dumb-bells. We will now try some simple\r\ndrill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh! I know that simple drill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would he \xe2\x80\x99ighly to your discredit if you did not, Muster Corkran.\r\n_At_ the same time, it is not so easy as it looks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBet you a bob, I can drill as well as you, Foxy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see later. Now try to imagine you ain\xe2\x80\x99t defaulters at all, but\r\nan \xe2\x80\x99arf company on parade, me bein\xe2\x80\x99 your commandin\xe2\x80\x99 officer. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno call to laugh. If you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky, most of you will \xe2\x80\x99ave to take drills\r\n\xe2\x80\x99arf your life. Do me a little credit. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been at it long enough,\r\ngoodness knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were formed into fours, marched, wheeled, and countermarched, the\r\nspell of ordered motion strong on them. As Foxy said, they had been at\r\nit a long time.\r\n\r\nThe gymnasium door opened, revealing McTurk in charge of an old\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant, leading a wheel, did not see. \xe2\x80\x9cNot so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot \xe2\x80\x99arf so bad. The pivot-man of the wheel _honly_ marks time, Muster\r\nSwayne. Now, Muster Corkran, you say you know the drill? Oblige me by\r\ntakin\xe2\x80\x99 over the command and, reversin\xe2\x80\x99 my words step by step, relegate\r\nthem to their previous formation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this? What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the visitor authoritatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA--a little drill, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Foxy, saying nothing of first\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent--excellent. I only wish there were more of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he chirruped.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me interrupt. You were just going to hand over to someone,\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down, breathing frostily in the chill air. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall muck it. I\r\nknow I shall,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Stalky uneasily; and his discomfort was not\r\nlightened by a murmur from the rear rank that the old gentleman was\r\nGeneral Collinson, a member of the College Board of Council.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh--what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Foxy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCollinson, K.C.B.--He commanded the Pompadours--my father\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\nregiment,\xe2\x80\x9d hissed Swayne major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake your time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ know how it feels. Your first\r\ndrill--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d He drew an unhappy breath. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tention. Dress!\xe2\x80\x9d The echo of\r\nhis own voice restored his confidence.\r\n\r\nThe wheel was faced about, flung back, broken into fours, and restored\r\nto line without a falter. The official hour of punishment was long\r\npassed, but no one thought of that. They were backing up Stalky--Stalky\r\nin deadly fear lest his voice should crack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does you credit, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d was the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s comment. \xe2\x80\x9cA good\r\ndrill--and good material to drill. Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s an extraordinary thing:\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been lunching with your head-master and he never told me you had a\r\ncadet-corps in the College.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe \xe2\x80\x99aven\xe2\x80\x99t, sir. This is only a little drill,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut aren\xe2\x80\x99t they keen on it?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, speaking for the first time,\r\nwith a twinkle in his deep-set eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy aren\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ in it, though, Willy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not punctual enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sergeant only takes the\r\npick of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDismiss! Break off!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Foxy, fearing an explosion in the ranks.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I ought to have told you, sir, that--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you should have a cadet-corps.\xe2\x80\x9d The General pursued his own line of\r\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _shall_ have a cadet-corps, too, if my recommendation\r\nin Council is any use. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so pleased. Boys\r\nanimated by a spirit like yours should set an example to the whole\r\nschool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my soul! Can it be so late? I\xe2\x80\x99ve kept my fly waiting half an\r\nhour. Well, I must run away. Nothing like seeing things for one\xe2\x80\x99s self.\r\nWhich end of the buildings does one get out at? Will you show me, Willy?\r\nWho was that boy who took the drill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorkran, I think his name is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to know him. That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of boy you should cultivate.\r\nEvidently an unusual sort. A wonderful sight. Five and twenty boys, who,\r\nI dare say, would much sooner be playing cricket\xe2\x80\x9d--(it was the depth\r\nof winter; but grown people, especially those who have lived long in\r\nforeign parts, make these little errors, and McTurk did not correct\r\nhim)--\xe2\x80\x9cdrilling for the sheer love of it. A shame to waste so much good\r\nstuff; but I think I can carry my point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 who\xe2\x80\x99s your friend with the white whiskers?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Stalky, on\r\nMcTurk\xe2\x80\x99s return to the study.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Collinson. He comes over to shoot with my father sometimes.\r\nRather a decent old bargee, too. He said I ought to cultivate your\r\nacquaintance, Stalky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he tip you?\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk exhibited a blessed whole sovereign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, annexing it, for he was treasurer. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a\r\nhefty brew. You\xe2\x80\x99d pretty average cool cheek, Turkey, to jaw about our\r\nkeenness an\xe2\x80\x99 punctuality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t the old boy know we were defaulters?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot him. He came down to lunch with the Head. I found him pokin\xe2\x80\x99 about\r\nthe place on his own hook afterwards, an\xe2\x80\x99 I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d show him the\r\ngiddy drill. When I found he was so pleased, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 to damp his\r\ngiddy ardor. He mightn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 given me the quid if I had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t old Foxy pleased? Did you see him get pink behind the ears?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an awful score for him. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t we back him\r\nup beautifully? Let\xe2\x80\x99s go down to Keyte\xe2\x80\x99s and get some cocoa and\r\nsassingers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey overtook Foxy, speeding down to retail the adventure to Keyte, who\r\nin his time had been Troop Sergeant-Major in a cavalry regiment, and\r\nnow, war-worn veteran, was local postmaster and confectioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou owe us something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, with meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99ighly grateful, Muster Corkran. I\xe2\x80\x99ve \xe2\x80\x99ad to run against you pretty\r\nhard in the way o\xe2\x80\x99 business, now and then, but I _will_ say that outside\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 business--bounds an\xe2\x80\x99 smokin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 such like--I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to have a\r\nmore trustworthy young gentleman to \xe2\x80\x99elp me out of a hole. The way\r\nyou \xe2\x80\x99andled the drill was beautiful, though I say it. Now, if you come\r\nregular henceforward--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be late three times a week,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect a chap to do that--just to please you, Foxy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. Still, if you could manage it--and you, Muster\r\nBeetle--it would give you a big start when the cadet-corps is formed. I\r\nexpect the General will recommend it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey raided Keyte\xe2\x80\x99s very much at their own sweet will, for the old man,\r\nwho knew them well, was deep in talk with Foxy. \xe2\x80\x9cI make what we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntaken seven and six,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky called at last over the counter; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter count for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--no. I\xe2\x80\x99d take your word any day, Muster Corkran.--In the Pompadours,\r\nwas he, Sergeant? We lay with them once at Umballa, I think it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether this ham-and-tongue tin is eighteen pence or one\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay one an\xe2\x80\x99 fourpence, Muster Corkran... Of course, Sergeant, if it was\r\nany use to give my time, I\xe2\x80\x99d be pleased to do it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m too old. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike to see a drill again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come on, Stalky,\xe2\x80\x9d cried McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t listenin\xe2\x80\x99 to you. Chuck\r\nover the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want the quid changed, you ass. Keyte! Private Keyte! Corporal Keyte!\r\nTerroop-Sergeant-Major Keyte, will you give me change for a quid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--yes, of course. Seven an\xe2\x80\x99 six.\xe2\x80\x9d He stared abstractedly, pushed the\r\nsilver over, and melted away into the darkness of the back room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow those two\xe2\x80\x99ll jaw about the Mutiny till tea-time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Keyte was at Sobraon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cHear him talk about that\r\nsometimes! Beats Foxy hollow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Head\xe2\x80\x99s face, inscrutable as ever, was bent over a pile of letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last to the Reverend John Gillett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that--an estimable idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe concede that much. Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have my doubts about it--that\xe2\x80\x99s all. The more I know of boys the less\r\ndo I profess myself capable of following their moods; but I own I shall\r\nbe very much surprised if the scheme takes. It--it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the temper of\r\nthe school. We prepare for the Army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy business--in _this_ matter--is to carry out the wishes of the\r\nCouncil. They demand a volunteer cadet-corps. A volunteer cadet-corps\r\nwill be furnished. I have suggested, however, that we need not embark\r\nupon the expense of uniforms till we are drilled. General Collinson is\r\nsending us fifty lethal weapons--cut-down Sniders, he calls them--all\r\ncarefully plugged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is necessary in a school that uses loaded saloon-pistols to\r\nthe extent we do.\xe2\x80\x9d The Reverend John smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore there will be no outlay except the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he fails you will be blamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, assuredly. I shall post a notice in the corridor this afternoon,\r\nand--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall watch the result.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly keep your \xe2\x80\x99ands off the new arm-rack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFoxy wrestled with a turbulent crowd in the gymnasium. \xe2\x80\x9cNor it won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo even a condemned Snider any good to be continual snappin\xe2\x80\x99 the lock,\r\nMr. Swayne.--Yiss, the uniforms will come later, when we\xe2\x80\x99re more\r\nproficient; at present we will confine ourselves to drill. I am \xe2\x80\x99ere\r\nfor the purpose o\xe2\x80\x99 takin\xe2\x80\x99 the names o\xe2\x80\x99 those willin\xe2\x80\x99 to join.--Put down\r\nthat Snider, Muster Hogan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had all the drill _I_ want, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! After all you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned? Come on! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be a scab! They\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nyou corporal in a week,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not goin\xe2\x80\x99 up for the Army.\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle touched his spectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on a shake, Foxy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hogan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you goin\xe2\x80\x99 to drill us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere--in the gym--till you are fit an\xe2\x80\x99 capable to be taken out on the\r\nroad.\xe2\x80\x9d The Sergeant threw a chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all the Northam cads to look at? Not good enough, Foxibus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we won\xe2\x80\x99t make a point of it. You learn your drill first, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlater we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ansell of Macrea\xe2\x80\x99s, shouldering through the mob. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall this about a giddy cadet-corps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will save you a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 time at Sandhurst,\xe2\x80\x9d the Sergeant replied\r\npromptly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be dismissed your drills early if you go up with a\r\ngood groundin\xe2\x80\x99 before\xe2\x80\x99and.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm! \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind learnin\xe2\x80\x99 my drill, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not goin\xe2\x80\x99 to ass about the\r\ncountry with a toy Snider. Perowne, what are you goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do? Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njoinin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I\xe2\x80\x99ve the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perowne. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got no end of\r\nextra-tu as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, call this extra-tu,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ansell. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twon\xe2\x80\x99t take us long to mug up\r\nthe drill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s right enough, but what about marchin\xe2\x80\x99 in public?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHogan, not foreseeing that three years later he should die in the\r\nBurmese sunlight outside Minhla Fort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid the uniform won\xe2\x80\x99t suit your creamy complexion?\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk asked\r\nwith a villainous sneer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up, Turkey. You aren\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 up for the Army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to send a substitute. Hi! Morrell an\xe2\x80\x99 Wake! You two\r\nfags by the arm-rack, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to volunteer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlushing deeply--they had been too shy to apply before--the youngsters\r\nsidled towards the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want the little chaps--not at first,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSergeant disgustedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI want--I\xe2\x80\x99d like some of the Old Brigade--the\r\ndefaulters--to stiffen \xe2\x80\x99em a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be ungrateful, Sergeant. They\xe2\x80\x99re nearly as big as you get \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nin the Army now.\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk read the papers of those years and could be\r\ntrusted for general information, which he used as he used his \xe2\x80\x9ctweaker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Yet he did not know that Wake minor would be a bimbashi of the Egyptian\r\nArmy ere his thirtieth year.\r\n\r\nHogan, Swayne, Stalky, Perowne, and Ansell were deep in consultation by\r\nthe vaulting-horse, Stalky as usual laying down the law. The Sergeant\r\nwatched them uneasily, knowing that many waited on their lead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoxy don\xe2\x80\x99t like my recruits,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, in a pained tone, to Beetle.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou get him some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing loath, Beetle pinioned two more fags--each no taller than a\r\ncarbine. \xe2\x80\x9cHere you are, Foxy. Here\xe2\x80\x99s food for powder. Strike for your\r\nhearths an\xe2\x80\x99 homes, you young brutes--an\xe2\x80\x99 be jolly quick about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill he isn\xe2\x80\x99t happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cFor the way we have with our Army\r\n   Is the way we have with our Navy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Beetle joined in. They had found the poem in an old volume of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPunch,\xe2\x80\x9d and it seemed to cover the situation:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 both of \xe2\x80\x99em led to adversity,\r\n   Which nobody can deny!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou be quiet, young gentlemen. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99elp--don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99inder.\xe2\x80\x9d Foxy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye was still on the council by the horse. Carter, White, and Tyrrell,\r\nall boys of influence, had joined it. The rest fingered the rifles\r\nirresolutely. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a shake,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we turn out those\r\nrotters before we get to work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Foxy. \xe2\x80\x9cAny one wishful to join will stay \xe2\x80\x99ere. Those\r\nwho do not so intend will go out, quietly closin\xe2\x80\x99 the door be\xe2\x80\x99ind \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen of the earnest-minded rushed at them, and they had just\r\ntime to escape into the corridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you join?\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle asked, resettling his collar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good? We aren\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 up for the Army. Besides, I know the\r\ndrill--all except the manual, of course. \xe2\x80\x99Wonder what they\xe2\x80\x99re doin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMakin\xe2\x80\x99 a treaty with Foxy. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear Stalky say: \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll do--an\xe2\x80\x99 if he don\xe2\x80\x99t like it he can lump it\xe2\x80\x99? They\xe2\x80\x99ll use Foxy for\r\na cram. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see, you idiot? They\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 up for Sandhurst or the\r\nShop in less than a year. They\xe2\x80\x99ll learn their drill an\xe2\x80\x99 then they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndrop it like a shot. D\xe2\x80\x99you suppose chaps with their amount of extra-tu\r\nare takin\xe2\x80\x99 up volunteerin\xe2\x80\x99 for fun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I thought of doin\xe2\x80\x99 a poem about it--rottin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em,\r\nyou know--\xe2\x80\x98The Ballad of the Dogshooters\xe2\x80\x99--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can, because King\xe2\x80\x99ll be down on the corps like a\r\ncartload o\xe2\x80\x99 bricks. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been consulted, he\xe2\x80\x99s sniffin\xe2\x80\x99 round the\r\nnotice-board now. Let\xe2\x80\x99s lure him.\xe2\x80\x9d They strolled up carelessly towards\r\nthe house-master--a most meek couple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d said King with a start of feigned surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cMethought you\r\nwould be learning to fight for your country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the company\xe2\x80\x99s full, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great pity,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForty valiant defenders, have we, then? How noble! What devotion!\r\nI presume that it is possible that a desire to evade their normal\r\nresponsibilities may be at the bottom of this zeal. Doubtless they will\r\nbe accorded special privileges, like the Choir and the Natural History\r\nSociety--one must not say Bug-hunters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I suppose so, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Head hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said\r\nanything about it yet, but he will, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sure to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just possible, my Beetle,\xe2\x80\x9d King wheeled on the last speaker,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat the house-masters--a necessary but somewhat neglected factor in\r\nour humble scheme of existence--may have a word to say on the matter.\r\nLife, for the young at least, is not all weapons and munitions of war.\r\nEducation is incidentally one of our aims.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a consistent pig he is,\xe2\x80\x9d cooed McTurk, when they were out of\r\nearshot. \xe2\x80\x9cOne always knows where to have him. Did you see how he rose to\r\nthat draw about the Head and special privileges?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound him, he might have had the decency to have backed the scheme.\r\nI could do such a lovely ballad, rottin\xe2\x80\x99 it; and now I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be a\r\ngiddy enthusiast. It don\xe2\x80\x99t bar our pulling Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s leg in the study,\r\ndoes it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; but in the Coll. we must be pro-cadet-corps like anything.\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t you make up a giddy epigram, _\xc3\xa0 la Catullus_, about King\r\nobjectin\xe2\x80\x99 to it?\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle was at this noble task when Stalky returned all\r\nhot from his first drill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, my ramrod-bunger!\xe2\x80\x9d began McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your dead dog? Is it\r\nDefence or Defiance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDefiance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, and leaped on him at that word. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\r\nTurkey, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t rot the corps. We\xe2\x80\x99ve arranged it beautifully. Foxy\r\nswears he won\xe2\x80\x99t take us out into the open till we say we want to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Dis_-gustin\xe2\x80\x99 exhibition of immature infants apin\xe2\x80\x99 the idiosyncrasies\r\nof their elders. Snff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you drawn King, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky asked in a pause of the scuffle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly; but that\xe2\x80\x99s his genial style.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, listen to your Uncle Stalky--who is a great man. Moreover\r\nand subsequently, Foxy\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to let us drill the corps in\r\nturn--_privatim et seriatim_--so that we\xe2\x80\x99ll all know how to handle a\r\nhalf company anyhow. _Ergo_, an\xe2\x80\x99 _propter hoc_, when we go to the Shop\r\nwe shall be dismissed drill early; thus, my beloved \xe2\x80\x99earers, combinin\xe2\x80\x99\r\neducation with wholesome amusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you\xe2\x80\x99d make a sort of extra-tu of it, you cold-blooded brute,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to die for your giddy country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if I can jolly well avoid it. So you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t rot the corps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d decided on that, years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cKing\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nthe rottin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to rot King, my giddy poet. Make up a good catchy\r\nLimerick, and let the fags sing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, you stick to volunteerin\xe2\x80\x99, and don\xe2\x80\x99t jog the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to take hold of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, with dark\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nThey did not know what that meant till, a few days later, they proposed\r\nto watch the corps at drill. They found the gymnasium door locked and a\r\nfag on guard. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is sweet cheek,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, stooping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMustn\xe2\x80\x99t look through the key-hole,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sentry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that. Why, Wake, you little beast, I made you a volunteer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t help it. My orders are not to allow any one to look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99pose we do?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99pose we jolly well slay you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy orders are, I am to give the name of anybody who interfered with\r\nme on my post, to the corps, an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99d deal with him after drill,\r\naccordin\xe2\x80\x99 to martial law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a brute Stalky is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. They never doubted for a moment\r\nwho had devised that scheme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou esteem yourself a giddy centurion, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle,\r\nlistening to the crash and rattle of grounded arms within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy orders are, not to talk except to explain my orders--they\xe2\x80\x99ll lick me\r\nif I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMcTurk looked at Beetle. The two shook their heads and turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear Stalky _is_ a great man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle after a long pause. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\r\nconsolation is that this sort of secret-society biznai will drive King\r\nwild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt troubled many more than King, but the members of the corps were muter\r\nthan oysters. Foxy, being bound by no vow, carried his woes to Keyte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never come across such nonsense in my life. They\xe2\x80\x99ve tiled the lodge,\r\ninner and outer guard, all complete, and then they get to work, keen as\r\nmustard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s it all for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the ex-Troop Sergeant-Major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo learn their drill. You never saw anything like it. They begin after\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve dismissed \xe2\x80\x99em--practisin\xe2\x80\x99 tricks; but out into the open they will\r\n_not_ come--not for ever so. The \xe2\x80\x99ole thing is pre-posterous. If you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na cadet-corps, _I_ say, be a cadet-corps, instead o\xe2\x80\x99 hidin\xe2\x80\x99 be\xe2\x80\x99ind\r\nlocked doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do the authorities say about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat beats me again.\xe2\x80\x9d The Sergeant spoke fretfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI go to the \xe2\x80\x99Ead\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99e gives me no help. There\xe2\x80\x99s times when I think he\xe2\x80\x99s makin\xe2\x80\x99 fun o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nme. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been a Volunteer-sergeant, thank God--but I\xe2\x80\x99ve always had\r\nthe consideration to pity \xe2\x80\x99em. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad o\xe2\x80\x99 that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keyte. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom your statements, Sergeant, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get at what they\xe2\x80\x99re after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me, Major! Ask that freckle-faced young Corkran. He\xe2\x80\x99s their\r\ngeneralissimo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne does not refuse a warrior of Sobraon, or deny the only pastry-cook\r\nwithin bounds. So Keyte came, by invitation, leaning upon a stick,\r\ntremulous with old age, to sit in a corner and watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey shape well. They shape uncommon well,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered between\r\nevolutions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _this_ isn\xe2\x80\x99t what they\xe2\x80\x99re after. Wait till I dismiss \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the \xe2\x80\x9cbreak-off\xe2\x80\x9d the ranks stood fast. Perowne fell out, faced them,\r\nand, refreshing his memory by glimpses at a red-bound, metal-clasped\r\nbook, drilled them for ten minutes. (This is that Perowne who was shot\r\nin Equatorial Africa by his own men.) Ansell followed him, and Hogan\r\nfollowed Ansell. All three were implicitly obeyed. Then Stalky laid\r\naside his Snider, and, drawing a long breath, favored the company with a\r\nblast of withering invective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Old \xe2\x80\x99ard, Muster Corkran. That ain\xe2\x80\x99t in any drill,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Foxy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Sergeant. You never know what you may have to say to your\r\nmen.--For pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, try to stand up without leanin\xe2\x80\x99 against each\r\nother, you blear-eyed, herrin\xe2\x80\x99-gutted gutter-snipes. It\xe2\x80\x99s no pleasure to\r\nme to comb you out. That ought to have been done before you came here,\r\nyou--you militia broom-stealers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old touch--the old touch. _We_ know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keyte, wiping his\r\nrheumy eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cBut where did he pick it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom his father--or his uncle. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me! Half of \xe2\x80\x99em must have been\r\nborn within earshot o\xe2\x80\x99 the barracks.\xe2\x80\x9d (Foxy was not far wrong in his\r\nguess.) \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard more back-talk since this volunteerin\xe2\x80\x99 nonsense\r\nbegan than I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard in a year in the service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a rear-rank man lookin\xe2\x80\x99 as though his belly were in the\r\npawn-shop. Yes, you, Private Ansell,\xe2\x80\x9d and Stalky tongue-lashed the\r\nvictim for three minutes, in gross and in detail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d He returned to his normal tone. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst blood to me. You\r\nflushed, Ansell. You wriggled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help flushing,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think I wriggled,\r\nthough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn now.\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky resumed his place in the ranks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, Lord! It\xe2\x80\x99s as good as a play,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled the attentive Keyte.\r\nAnsell, too, had been blessed with relatives in the service, and slowly,\r\nin a lazy drawl--his style was more reflective than Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s--descended\r\nthe abysmal depths of personality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlood to me!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Stalky was a rich red, and his Snider shook visibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I would,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, struggling for composure, \xe2\x80\x9cbut after\r\na bit I got in no end of a bait. Curious, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood for the temper,\xe2\x80\x9d said the slow-moving Hogan, as they returned arms\r\nto the rack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever?\xe2\x80\x9d said Foxy, hopelessly, to Keyte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about volunteers, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the rummiest show I ever\r\nsaw. I can see what they\xe2\x80\x99re gettin\xe2\x80\x99 at, though. Lord! how often I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen told off an\xe2\x80\x99 dressed down in my day! They shape well--extremely\r\nwell they shape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could get \xe2\x80\x99em out into the open, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x99em, Major. Perhaps when the uniforms come down, they\xe2\x80\x99ll change\r\ntheir mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed it was time that the corps made some concession to the curiosity\r\nof the school. Thrice had the guard been maltreated and thrice had the\r\ncorps dealt out martial law to the offender. The school raged. What was\r\nthe use, they asked, of a cadet-corps which none might see? Mr. King\r\ncongratulated them on their invisible defenders, and they could not\r\nparry his thrusts. Foxy was growing sullen and restive. A few of the\r\ncorps expressed openly doubts as to the wisdom of their course; and the\r\nquestion of uniforms loomed on the near horizon. If these were issued,\r\nthey would be forced to wear them.\r\n\r\nBut, as so often happens in this life, the matter was suddenly settled\r\nfrom without.\r\n\r\nThe Head had duly informed the Council that their recommendation had\r\nbeen acted upon, and that, so far as he could learn, the boys were\r\ndrilling. He said nothing of the terms on which they drilled. Naturally,\r\nGeneral Collinson was delighted and told his friends. One of his friends\r\nrejoiced in a friend, a Member of Parliament--a zealous, an intelligent,\r\nand, above all, a patriotic person, anxious to do the most good in the\r\nshortest possible time. But we cannot answer, alas! for the friends of\r\nour friends. If Collinson\xe2\x80\x99s friend had introduced him to the General,\r\nthe latter would have taken his measure and saved much. But the friend\r\nmerely spoke of his friend; and since no two people in the world see eye\r\nto eye, the picture conveyed to Collinson was inaccurate. Moreover, the\r\nman was an M.P., an impeccable Conservative, and the General had the\r\nEnglish soldier\xe2\x80\x99s lurking respect for any member of the Court of Last\r\nAppeal. He was going down into the West country, to spread light in\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s benighted constituency. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be a good idea if, armed\r\nwith the General\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, he, taking the admirable and newly\r\nestablished cadet-corps for his text, spoke a few words--\xe2\x80\x9cJust talked\r\nto the boys a little--eh? You know the kind of thing that would be\r\nacceptable; and he\xe2\x80\x99d be the very man to do it. The sort of talk that\r\nboys understand, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to \xe2\x80\x99em much in my time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the General,\r\nsuspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but times change--with the spread of education and so on. The boys\r\nof to-day are the men of to-morrow. An impression in youth is likely to\r\nbe permanent. And in these times, you know, with the country going to\r\nthe dogs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite right.\xe2\x80\x9d The island was then entering on five years of Mr.\r\nGladstone\xe2\x80\x99s rule; and the General did not like what he had seen of it.\r\nHe would certainly write to the Head, for it was beyond question that\r\nthe boys of to-day made the men of to-morrow. That, if he might say so,\r\nwas uncommonly well put.\r\n\r\nIn reply, the Head stated that he should be delighted to welcome Mr.\r\nRaymond Martin, M.P., of whom he had heard so much; to put him up for\r\nthe night, and to allow him to address the school on any subject that\r\nhe conceived would interest them. If Mr. Martin had not yet faced an\r\naudience of this particular class of British youth, the Head had no\r\ndoubt that he would find it an interesting experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am very far wrong in that last,\xe2\x80\x9d he confided to the\r\nReverend John. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you happen to know anything of one Raymond Martin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was at College with a man of that name,\xe2\x80\x9d the chaplain replied.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was without form and void, so far as I remember, but desperately\r\nearnest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will address the Coll. on \xe2\x80\x98Patriotism\xe2\x80\x99 next Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is one thing our boys detest more than another it is having\r\ntheir Saturday evenings broken into. Patriotism has no chance beside\r\n\xe2\x80\x98brewing.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor art either. D\xe2\x80\x99you remember our \xe2\x80\x98Evening with Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The Head\xe2\x80\x99s eyes twinkled. \xe2\x80\x9cOr the humorous gentleman with the magic\r\nlantern?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 who the dooce is this Raymond Martin, M.P.?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Beetle, when\r\nhe read the notice of the lecture in the corridor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do the brutes\r\nalways turn up on a Saturday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOuh! Reomeo, Reomeo. Wherefore art thou Reomeo?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk over his\r\nshoulder, quoting the Shakespeare artiste of last term. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe as bad as _her_, I hope. Stalky, are you properly patriotic? Because\r\nif you ain\xe2\x80\x99t, this chap\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to make you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHope he won\xe2\x80\x99t take up the whole of the evening. I suppose we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nlisten to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss him for the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of chaps thought\r\nthat Romeo-Romeo woman was a bore. _I_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I liked her! \xe2\x80\x99Member\r\nwhen she began to hiccough in the middle of it? P\xe2\x80\x99raps he\xe2\x80\x99ll hiccough.\r\nWhoever gets into the Gym first, bags seats for the other two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no nervousness, but a brisk and cheery affability about Mr.\r\nRaymond Martin, M.P., as he drove up, watched by many eyes, to the\r\nHead\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooks a bit of a bargee,\xe2\x80\x9d was McTurk\xe2\x80\x99s comment. \xe2\x80\x9cShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised\r\nif he was a Radical. He rowed the driver about the fare. I heard him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was his giddy patriotism,\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle explained. After tea they joined\r\nthe rush for seats, secured a private and invisible corner, and began\r\nto criticise. Every gas-jet was lit. On the little dais at the far end\r\nstood the Head\xe2\x80\x99s official desk, whence Mr. Martin would discourse, and a\r\nring of chairs for the masters.\r\n\r\nEntered then Foxy, with official port, and leaned something like a\r\ncloth rolled round a stick against the desk. No one in authority was yet\r\npresent, so the school applauded, crying: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that, Foxy? What are\r\nyou stealin\xe2\x80\x99 the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s brolly for?--We don\xe2\x80\x99t birch here. We cane!\r\nTake away that bauble!--Number off from the right\xe2\x80\x9d--and so forth, till\r\nthe entry of the Head and the masters ended all demonstrations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne good job--the Common-room hate this as much as we do. Watch King\r\nwrigglin\xe2\x80\x99 to get out of the draft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the Raymondiferous Martin? Punctuality, my beloved \xe2\x80\x99earers, is\r\nthe image o\xe2\x80\x99 war--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the giddy Dook. Golly, what a dewlap!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Martin,\r\nin evening dress, was undeniably throaty--a tall, generously designed,\r\npink-and-white man. Still, Beetle need not have been coarse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at his back while he\xe2\x80\x99s talkin\xe2\x80\x99 to the Head. Vile bad form to turn\r\nyour back on the audience! He\xe2\x80\x99s a Philistine--a Bopper--a Jebusite--an\xe2\x80\x99\r\na Hivite.\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk leaned back and sniffed contemptuously.\r\n\r\nIn a few colorless words, the Head introduced the speaker and sat\r\ndown amid applause. When Mr. Martin took the applause to himself, they\r\nnaturally applauded more than ever. It was some time before he could\r\nbegin. He had no knowledge of the school--its tradition or heritage. He\r\ndid not know that the last census showed that eighty per cent. of the\r\nboys had been born abroad--in camp, cantonment, or upon the high seas;\r\nor that seventy-five per cent. were sons of officers in one or other of\r\nthe services--Willoughbys, Paulets, De Castros, Maynes, Randalls, after\r\ntheir kind--looking to follow their fathers\xe2\x80\x99 profession. The Head might\r\nhave told him this, and much more; but, after an hour-long dinner in his\r\ncompany, the Head decided to say nothing whatever. Mr. Raymond Martin\r\nseemed to know so much already.\r\n\r\nHe plunged into his speech with a long-drawn, rasping \xe2\x80\x9cWell, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n that, though they were not conscious of it, set every young nerve ajar.\r\nHe supposed they knew--hey?--what he had come down for? It was not often\r\nthat he had an opportunity to talk to boys. He supposed that boys were\r\nvery much the same kind of persons--some people thought them rather\r\nfunny persons--as they had been in his youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis man,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, with conviction, \xe2\x80\x9cis _the_ Gadarene Swine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut they must remember that they would not always be boys. They would\r\ngrow up into men, because the boys of to-day made the men of to-morrow,\r\nand upon the men of to-morrow the fair fame of their glorious native\r\nland depended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this goes on, my beloved \xe2\x80\x99earers, it will be my painful duty to rot\r\nthis bargee.\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky drew a long breath through his nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ain\xe2\x80\x99t chargin\xe2\x80\x99 anything for his\r\nRomeo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so they ought to think of the duties and responsibilities of the\r\nlife that was opening before them. Life was not all--he enumerated a few\r\ngames, and, that nothing might be lacking to the sweep and impact of his\r\nfall, added \xe2\x80\x9cmarbles.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, life was not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9call marbles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was one tense gasp--among the juniors almost a shriek--of\r\nquivering horror, he was a heathen--an outcast---beyond the extremest\r\npale of toleration--self-damned before all men. Stalky bowed his head in\r\nhis hands. McTurk, with a bright and cheerful eye, drank in every word,\r\nand Beetle nodded solemn approval.\r\n\r\nSome of them, doubtless, expected in a few years to have the honor of a\r\ncommission from the Queen, and to wear a sword. Now, he himself had had\r\nsome experience of these duties, as a Major in a volunteer regiment,\r\nand he was glad to learn that they had established a volunteer corps in\r\ntheir midst. The establishment of such an establishment conduced to a\r\nproper and healthy spirit, which, if fostered, would be of great benefit\r\nto the land they loved and were so proud to belong to. Some of those now\r\npresent expected, he had no doubt--some of them anxiously looked\r\nforward to leading their men against the bullets of England\xe2\x80\x99s foes;\r\nto confronting the stricken field in all the pride of their youthful\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\nNow the reserve of a boy is tenfold deeper than the reserve of a maid,\r\nshe being made for one end only by blind Nature, but man for several.\r\nWith a large and healthy hand, he tore down these veils, and trampled\r\nthem under the well-intentioned feet of eloquence. In a raucous voice,\r\nhe cried aloud little matters, like the hope of Honor and the dream of\r\nGlory, that boys do not discuss even with their most intimate equals,\r\ncheerfully assuming that, till he spoke, they had never considered these\r\npossibilities. He pointed them to shining goals, with fingers which\r\nsmudged out all radiance on all horizons. He profaned the most secret\r\nplaces of their souls with outcries and gesticulations, he bade them\r\nconsider the deeds of their ancestors in such a fashion that they were\r\nflushed to their tingling ears. Some of them--the rending voice cut a\r\nfrozen stillness--might have had relatives who perished in defence of\r\ntheir country. They thought, not a few of them, of an old sword in a\r\npassage, or above a breakfast-room table, seen and fingered by stealth\r\nsince they could walk. He adjured them to emulate those illustrious\r\nexamples; and they looked all ways in their extreme discomfort.\r\n\r\nTheir years forbade them even to shape their thoughts clearly to\r\nthemselves. They felt savagely that they were being outraged by a fat\r\nman who considered marbles a game.\r\n\r\nAnd so he worked towards his peroration--which, by the way, he used\r\nlater with overwhelming success at a meeting of electors--while they\r\nsat, flushed and uneasy, in sour disgust. After many, many words, he\r\nreached for the cloth-wrapped stick and thrust one hand in his bosom.\r\nThis--this was the concrete symbol of their land--worthy of all honor\r\nand reverence! Let no boy look on this flag who did not purpose to\r\nworthily add to its imperishable lustre. He shook it before them--a\r\nlarge calico Union Jack, staring in all three colors, and waited for the\r\nthunder of applause that should crown his effort.\r\n\r\nThey looked in silence. They had certainly seen the thing before--down\r\nat the coastguard station, or through a telescope, half-mast high when a\r\nbrig went ashore on Braunton Sands; above the roof of the Golf-club, and\r\nin Keyte\xe2\x80\x99s window, where a certain kind of striped sweetmeat bore it in\r\npaper on each box. But the College never displayed it; it was no part\r\nof the scheme of their lives; the Head had never alluded to it; their\r\nfathers had not declared it unto them. It was a matter shut up, sacred\r\nand apart. What, in the name of everything caddish, was he driving at,\r\nwho waved that horror before their eyes? Happy thought! Perhaps he was\r\ndrunk.\r\n\r\nThe Head saved the situation by rising swiftly to propose a vote of\r\nthanks, and at his first motion, the school clapped furiously, from a\r\nsense of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, the gaslight full on his face, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nwill all join me in a very hearty vote of thanks to Mr. Raymond Martin\r\nfor the most enjoyable address he has given us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this day we shall never know the rights of the case. The Head\r\nvows that he did no such thing; or that, if he did, it must have been\r\nsomething in his eye; but those who were present are persuaded that\r\nhe winked, once, openly and solemnly, after the word \xe2\x80\x9cenjoyable.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nRaymond Martin got his applause full tale. As he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWithout vanity,\r\nI think my few words went to their hearts. I never knew boys could cheer\r\nlike that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left as the prayer-bell rang, and the boys lined up against the wall.\r\nThe flag lay still unrolled on the desk, Foxy regarding it with pride,\r\nfor he had been touched to the quick by Mr. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s eloquence. The\r\nHead and the Common-room, standing back on the dais, could not see the\r\nglaring offence, but a prefect left the line, rolled it up swiftly, and\r\nas swiftly tossed it into a glove and foil locker.\r\n\r\nThen, as though he had touched a spring, broke out the low murmur of\r\ncontent, changing to quick-volleyed hand-clapping.\r\n\r\nThey discussed the speech in the dormitories. There was not one\r\ndissentient voice. Mr. Raymond Martin, beyond question, was born in a\r\ngutter, and bred in a board-school, where they played marbles. He was\r\nfurther (I give the barest handful from great store) a Flopshus Cad,\r\nan Outrageous Stinker, a Jelly-bellied Flag-flapper (this was Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontribution), and several other things which it is not seemly to put\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe volunteer cadet-corps fell in next Monday, depressedly, with a face\r\nof shame. Even then, judicious silence might have turned the corner.\r\n\r\nSaid Foxy: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter a fine speech like what you \xe2\x80\x99eard night before last,\r\nyou ought to take \xe2\x80\x99old of your drill with _re_-newed activity. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee how you can avoid comin\xe2\x80\x99 out an\xe2\x80\x99 marchin\xe2\x80\x99 in the open now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we get out of it, then, Foxy?\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s fine old silky tone\r\nshould have warned him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not with his giving the flag so generously. He told me before he\r\nleft this morning that there was no objection to the corps usin\xe2\x80\x99 it as\r\ntheir own. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handsome flag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStalky returned his rifle to the rack in dead silence, and fell out. His\r\nexample was followed by Hogan and Ansell. Perowne hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\r\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t we--?\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get it out of the locker in a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, his back\r\nturned. \xe2\x80\x9cThen we can--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil are you waiting for? Dismiss!\r\nBreak off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--what the--where the--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rattle of Sniders, slammed into the rack, drowned his voice, as boy\r\nafter boy fell out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I shan\xe2\x80\x99t have to report this to the Head,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nstammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReport, then, and be damned to you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Stalky, white to the lips,\r\nand ran out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRummy thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle to McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cI was in the study, doin\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nsimply lovely poem about the Jelly-Bellied Flag-Flapper, an\xe2\x80\x99 Stalky\r\ncame in, an\xe2\x80\x99 I said \xe2\x80\x98Hullo!\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 he cursed me like a bargee, and then\r\nhe began to blub like anything. Shoved his head on the table and howled.\r\nHadn\xe2\x80\x99t we better do something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMcTurk was troubled. \xe2\x80\x9cP\xe2\x80\x99raps he\xe2\x80\x99s smashed himself up somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey found him, with very bright eyes, whistling between his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I take you in, Beetle? I thought I would. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it a good draw?\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you think I was blubbin\xe2\x80\x99? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I do it well? Oh, you fat old\r\nass!\xe2\x80\x9d And he began to pull Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s ears and checks, in the fashion that\r\nwas called \xe2\x80\x9cmilking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you were blubbin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle replied, composedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy aren\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nat drill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrill! What drill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to be a clever fool. Drill in the Gym.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Cause there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any. The volunteer cadet-corps is broke\r\nup--disbanded--dead--putrid--corrupt---stinkin\xe2\x80\x99. An\xe2\x80\x99 if you look at me\r\nlike that, Beetle, I\xe2\x80\x99ll slay you too... Oh, yes, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be\r\nreported to the Head for swearin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST TERM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was within a few days of the holidays, the term-end examinations,\r\nand, more important still, the issue of the College paper which Beetle\r\nedited. He had been cajoled into that office by the blandishments of\r\nStalky and McTurk and the extreme rigor of study law. Once installed, he\r\ndiscovered, as others have done before him, that his duty was to do\r\nthe work while his friends criticized. Stalky christened it the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwillingford Patriot,\xe2\x80\x9d in pious memory of Sponge--and McTurk compared\r\nthe output unfavorably with Ruskin and De Quincey. Only the Head took\r\nan interest in the publication, and his methods were peculiar. He gave\r\nBeetle the run of his brown-bound, tobacco-scented library; prohibiting\r\nnothing, recommending nothing. There Beetle found a fat arm-chair, a\r\nsilver inkstand, and unlimited pens and paper. There were scores and\r\nscores of ancient dramatists; there were Hakluyt, his voyages; French\r\ntranslations of Muscovite authors called Pushkin and Lermontoff; little\r\ntales of a heady and bewildering nature, interspersed with unusual\r\nsongs--Peacock was that writer\xe2\x80\x99s name; there was Borrow\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLavengro\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nan odd theme, purporting to be a translation of something, called a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuba\xe2\x80\x99iyat,\xe2\x80\x9d which the Head said was a poem not yet come to its own;\r\nthere were hundreds of volumes of verse---Crashaw; Dryden; Alexander\r\nSmith; L. E. L.; Lydia Sigourney; Fletcher and a purple island; Donne;\r\nMarlowe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFaust\xe2\x80\x9d; and--this made McTurk (to whom Beetle conveyed it)\r\nsheer drunk for three days--Ossian; \xe2\x80\x9cThe Earthly Paradise\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cAtalanta in\r\nCalydon\xe2\x80\x9d; and Rossetti--to name only a few. Then the Head, drifting in\r\nunder pretense of playing censor to the paper, would read here a\r\nverse and here another of these poets, opening up avenues. And, slow\r\nbreathing, with half-shut eyes above his cigar, would he speak of great\r\nmen living, and journals, long dead, founded in their riotous youth;\r\nof years when all the planets were little new-lit stars trying to find\r\ntheir places in the uncaring void, and he, the Head, knew them as young\r\nmen know one another. So the regular work went to the dogs, Beetle being\r\nfull of other matters and meters, hoarded in secret and only told to\r\nMcTurk of an afternoon, on the sands, walking high and disposedly round\r\nthe wreck of the Armada galleon, shouting and declaiming against the\r\nlong-ridged seas.\r\n\r\nThanks in large part to their house-master\xe2\x80\x99s experienced distrust, the\r\nthree for three consecutive terms had been passed over for promotion to\r\nthe rank of prefect--an office that went by merit, and carried with it\r\nthe honor of the ground-ash, and liberty, under restrictions, to use it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_But_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, \xe2\x80\x9ccome to think of it, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done more giddy\r\njesting with the Sixth since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been passed over than any one else in\r\nthe last seven years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe touched his neck proudly. It was encircled by the stiffest of\r\nstick-up collars, which custom decreed could be worn only by the Sixth.\r\nAnd the Sixth saw those collars and said no word. \xe2\x80\x9cPussy,\xe2\x80\x9d Abanazar, or\r\nDick Four of a year ago would have seen them discarded in five minutes\r\nor... But the Sixth of that term was made up mostly of young but\r\nbrilliantly clever boys, pets of the house-masters, too anxious for\r\ntheir dignity to care to come to open odds with the resourceful three.\r\nSo they crammed their caps at the extreme back of their heads,\r\ninstead of a trifle over one eye as the Fifth should, and rejoiced\r\nin patent-leather boots on week-days, and marvellous made-up ties on\r\nSundays--no man rebuking. McTurk was going up for Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s Hill, and\r\nStalky for Sandhurst, in the spring; and the Head had told them both\r\nthat, unless they absolutely collapsed during the holidays, they were\r\nsafe. As a trainer of colts, the Head seldom erred in an estimate of\r\nform.\r\n\r\nHe had taken Beetle aside that day and given him much good advice, not\r\none word of which did Beetle remember when he dashed up to the study,\r\nwhite with excitement, and poured out the wondrous tale. It demanded a\r\ngreat belief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou begin on a hundred a year?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk unsympathetically. \xe2\x80\x9cRot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_And_ my passage out! It\xe2\x80\x99s all settled. The Head says he\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nbreaking me in for this for ever so long, and I never knew--I never\r\nknew. One don\xe2\x80\x99t begin with writing straight off, y\xe2\x80\x99know. Begin by\r\nfilling in telegrams and cutting things out o\xe2\x80\x99 papers with scissors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Scissors! What an ungodly mess you\xe2\x80\x99ll make of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, anyhow, this will be your last term, too. Seven years, my dearly\r\nbeloved \xe2\x80\x99earers--though not prefects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot half bad years, either,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be sorry to leave\r\nthe old Coll.; shan\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked out over the sea creaming along the Pebbleridge in the clear\r\nwinter light. \xe2\x80\x9cWonder where we shall all be this time next year?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nStalky absently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time five years,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, \xe2\x80\x9cmy leavin\xe2\x80\x99s between ourselves. The Head hasn\xe2\x80\x99t told\r\nany one. I know he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, because Prout grunted at me to-day that if\r\nI were more reasonable--yah!--I might be a prefect next term. I s\xe2\x80\x99ppose\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s hard up for his prefects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s finish up with a row with the Sixth,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirty little schoolboys!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, who already saw himself a\r\nSandhurst cadet. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoral effect,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave an imperishable tradition, and all\r\nthe rest of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter go into Bideford an\xe2\x80\x99 pay up our debts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nthree quid out of my father--_ad hoc_. Don\xe2\x80\x99t owe more than thirty bob,\r\neither. Cut along, Beetle, and ask the Head for leave. Say you want to\r\ncorrect the \xe2\x80\x98Swillingford Patriot.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be my last issue, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like it to\r\nlook decent. I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch him before he goes to his lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTen minutes later they wheeled out in line, by grace released from\r\nfive o\xe2\x80\x99clock call-over, and all the afternoon lay before them. So also\r\nunluckily did King, who never passed without witticisms. But brigades of\r\nKings could not have ruffled Beetle that day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! Enjoying the study of light literature, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nrubbing his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cCommon mathematics are not for such soaring minds as\r\nyours, are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred a year,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Beetle, smiling into vacancy.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur open incompetence takes refuge in the flowery paths of inaccurate\r\nfiction. But a day of reckoning approaches, Beetle mine. I myself\r\nhave prepared a few trifling foolish questions in Latin prose which\r\ncan hardly be evaded even by your practised acts of deception. Ye-es,\r\nLatin prose. I think, if I may say so--but we shall see when the papers\r\nare set--\xe2\x80\x98Ulpian serves _your_ need.\xe2\x80\x99 Aha! \xe2\x80\x98_Elucescebat_, quoth our\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x99 We shall see! We shall see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill no sign from Beetle. He was on a steamer, his passage paid into\r\nthe wide and wonderful world--a thousand leagues beyond Lundy Island.\r\n\r\nKing dropped him with a snarl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know. He\xe2\x80\x99ll go on correctin\xe2\x80\x99 exercises an\xe2\x80\x99 jawin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshowin\xe2\x80\x99 off before the little boys next term--and next.\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle hurried\r\nafter his companions up the steep path of the furze-clad hill behind the\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nThey were throwing pebbles on the top of the gasometer, and the grimy\r\ngas-man in charge bade them desist. They watched him oil a turncock sunk\r\nin the ground between two furze-bushes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCokey, what\xe2\x80\x99s that for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo turn the gas on to the kitchens,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cokey. \xe2\x80\x9cIf so be I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t turn her on, yeou young gen\xe2\x80\x99lemen \xe2\x80\x99ud be larnin\xe2\x80\x99 your book by\r\ncandlelight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, and was silent for at least a minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo! Where are you chaps going?\xe2\x80\x9d A bend of the lane brought them\r\nface to face with Tulke, senior prefect of King\xe2\x80\x99s house--a smallish,\r\nwhite-haired boy, of the type that must be promoted on account of\r\nits intellect, and ever afterwards appeals to the Head to support its\r\nauthority when zeal has outrun discretion.\r\n\r\nThe three took no sort of notice. They were on lawful pass. Tulke\r\nrepeated his question hotly, for he had suffered many slights from\r\nNumber Five study, and fancied that he had at last caught them tripping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil is that to you?\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky replied with his sweetest smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, I\xe2\x80\x99m not goin\xe2\x80\x99--I\xe2\x80\x99m not goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be sworn at by the Fifth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n sputtered Tulke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen cut along and call a prefects\xe2\x80\x99 meeting,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, knowing\r\nTulke\xe2\x80\x99s weakness.\r\n\r\nThe prefect became inarticulate with rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMustn\xe2\x80\x99t yell at the Fifth that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s vile bad form.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCough it up, ducky!\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk said calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I want to know what you chaps are doing out of bounds?\xe2\x80\x9d This with an\r\nimportant flourish of his ground-ash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99re gettin\xe2\x80\x99 at it. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you ask that\r\nbefore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I ask it now. What are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re admiring you, Tulke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cWe think you\xe2\x80\x99re no end of a\r\nfine chap, don\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do! We do!\xe2\x80\x9d A dog-cart with some girls in it swept round the corner,\r\nand Stalky promptly kneeled before Tulke in the attitude of prayer; so\r\nTulke turned a color.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve reason to believe--\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOyez! Oyez! Oyez!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Beetle, after the manner of Bideford\xe2\x80\x99s town\r\ncrier, \xe2\x80\x9cTulke has reason to believe! Three cheers for Tulke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were given. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all our giddy admiration,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow how we love you, Tulke. We love you so much we think you ought to\r\ngo home and die. You\xe2\x80\x99re too good to live, Tulke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ oblige us by dyin\xe2\x80\x99. Think how lovely you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlook stuffed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTulke swept up the road with an unpleasant glare in his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means a prefects\xe2\x80\x99 meeting--sure pop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cHonor of the\r\nSixth involved, and all the rest of it. Tulke\xe2\x80\x99ll write notes all this\r\nafternoon, and Carson will call us up after tea. They daren\xe2\x80\x99t overlook\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBet you a bob he follows us!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s King\xe2\x80\x99s pet, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nscalps to both of \xe2\x80\x99em if we\xe2\x80\x99re caught out. We must be virtuous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I move we go to Mother Yeo\xe2\x80\x99s for a last gorge. We owe her about\r\nten bob, and Mary\xe2\x80\x99ll weep sore when she knows we\xe2\x80\x99re leaving,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBeetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gave me an awful wipe on the head last time--Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe does if you don\xe2\x80\x99t duck,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she generally kisses one\r\nback. Let\xe2\x80\x99s try Mother Yeo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sought a little bottle-windowed half dairy, half restaurant, a\r\ndark-brewed, two-hundred-year-old house, at the head of a narrow side\r\nstreet. They had patronized it from the days of their fagdom, and were\r\nvery much friends at home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve come to pay our debts, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, sliding his arm\r\nround the fifty-six-inch waist of the mistress of the establishment. \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\npay our debts and say good-by--and--and we\xe2\x80\x99re awf\xe2\x80\x99ly hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mother Yeo, \xe2\x80\x9cmakkin\xe2\x80\x99 love to me! I\xe2\x80\x99m shaamed of \xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Rackon us wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t du no such thing if Mary was here,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk,\r\nlapsing into the broad North Devon that the boys used on their\r\ncampaigns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99m takin\xe2\x80\x99 my name in vain?\xe2\x80\x9d The inner door opened, and Mary,\r\nfair-haired, blue-eyed, and apple-checked, entered with a bowl of cream\r\nin her hands. McTurk kissed her. Beetle followed suit, with exemplary\r\ncalm. Both boys were promptly cuffed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNiver kiss the maid when \xe2\x80\x99e can kiss the mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky,\r\nshamelessly winking at Mother Yeo, as he investigated a shelf of jams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad to see one of \xe2\x80\x99ee don\xe2\x80\x99t want his head slapped no more?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\r\ninvitingly, in that direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeu! Reckon I can get \xe2\x80\x99em give me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, his back turned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by me--yeou little masterpiece!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNiver asked \xe2\x80\x99ee. There\xe2\x80\x99s maids to Northam. Yiss--an\xe2\x80\x99 Appledore.\xe2\x80\x9d An\r\nunreproducible sniff, half contempt, half reminiscence, rounded the\r\nretort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAie! Yeou won\xe2\x80\x99t niver come to no good end. Whutt be \xe2\x80\x99baout, smellin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe cream?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tees bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cZmell \xe2\x80\x99un.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIncautiously Mary did as she was bid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBidevoor kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNiver amiss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, taking it without injury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeou--yeou--yeou--\xe2\x80\x9d Mary began, bubbling with mirth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99m better to Northam--more rich, laike an\xe2\x80\x99 us gets them give back\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, while McTurk solemnly waltzed Mother Yeo out of breath,\r\nand Beetle told Mary the sad news, as they sat down to clotted cream,\r\njam, and hot bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYiss. Yeou\xe2\x80\x99ll niver zee us no more, Mary. We\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be passons an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmissioners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady the Buffs!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, looking through the blind. \xe2\x80\x9cTulke _has_\r\nfollowed us. He\xe2\x80\x99s comin\xe2\x80\x99 up the street now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve niver put us out o\xe2\x80\x99 bounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mother Yeo. \xe2\x80\x9cBide yeou still,\r\nmy little dearrs.\xe2\x80\x9d She rolled into the inner room to make the score.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, suddenly, with tragic intensity. \xe2\x80\x9cDo \xe2\x80\x99ee lov\xe2\x80\x99 me,\r\nMary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIss--fai! Talled \xe2\x80\x99ee zo since yeou was zo high!\xe2\x80\x9d the damsel replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZee \xe2\x80\x99un comin\xe2\x80\x99 up street, then?\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky pointed to the unconscious\r\nTulke. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ve niver been kissed by no sort or manner o\xe2\x80\x99 maid in hees\r\nborned laife, Mary. Oh, \xe2\x80\x99tees shaamful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhutt\xe2\x80\x99s to do with me? \xe2\x80\x99Twill come to \xe2\x80\x99un in the way o\xe2\x80\x99 nature, I\r\nrackon.\xe2\x80\x9d She nodded her head sagaciously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou niver want me to kiss\r\nun--sure-_ly_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive \xe2\x80\x99ee half-a-crown if \xe2\x80\x99ee will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, exhibiting the coin.\r\n\r\nHalf-a-crown was much to Mary Yeo, and a jest was more; but--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeu\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, at the psychological moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAie!\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle echoed, knowing her weak point. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not a maid to\r\nNortham \xe2\x80\x99ud think twice. An\xe2\x80\x99 yeou such a fine maid, tu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMcTurk planted one foot firmly against the inner door lest Mother Yeo\r\nshould return inopportunely, for Mary\xe2\x80\x99s face was set. It was then that\r\nTulke found his way blocked by a tall daughter of Devon--that county of\r\neasy kisses, the pleasantest under the sun. He dodged aside politely.\r\nShe reflected a moment, and laid a vast hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere be \xe2\x80\x99ee gwaine tu, my dearr?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nOver the handkerchief he had crammed into his mouth Stalky could see the\r\nboy turn scarlet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGie I a kiss! Don\xe2\x80\x99t they larn \xe2\x80\x99ee manners to College?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTulke gasped and wheeled. Solemnly and conscientiously Mary kissed him\r\ntwice, and the luckless prefect fled.\r\n\r\nShe stepped into the shop, her eyes full of simple wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cKissed \xe2\x80\x99un?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Stalky, handing over the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIss, fai! But, oh, my little body, he\xe2\x80\x99m no Colleger. \xe2\x80\x99Zeemed tu-minded\r\nto cry, like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we won\xe2\x80\x99t. Yell couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make us cry that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mary cuffed them all round.\r\n\r\nAs they went out with tingling ears, said Stalky generally, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be much of a prefects\xe2\x80\x99 meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t there, just!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here. If he kissed her--which\r\nis our tack--he is a cynically immoral hog, and his conduct is blatant\r\nindecency. _Confer orationes Regis furiosissimi_, when he collared me\r\nreadin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Don Juan.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Course he kissed her,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the middle of the street. With\r\nhis house-cap on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime, 3.57 p.m. Make a note o\xe2\x80\x99 that. What d\xe2\x80\x99you mean, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nStalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! He\xe2\x80\x99s a truthful little beast. He may say he was kissed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then!\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle capered at the mere thought of it. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\r\nThe corollary to the giddy proposition is that the Sixth can\xe2\x80\x99t protect\r\n\xe2\x80\x99emselves from outrages an\xe2\x80\x99 ravishin\xe2\x80\x99s. Want nursemaids to look after\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em! We\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to whisper that to the Coll. Jam for the Sixth! Jam\r\nfor us! Either way it\xe2\x80\x99s jammy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Gum!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cOur last term\xe2\x80\x99s endin\xe2\x80\x99 well. Now you cut along\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 finish up your old rag, and Turkey and me will help. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go in the\r\nback way. No need to bother Randall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t play the giddy garden-goat, then?\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle knew what help meant,\r\nthough he was by no means averse to showing his importance before his\r\nallies. The little loft behind Randall\xe2\x80\x99s printing office was his own\r\nterritory, where he saw himself already controlling the \xe2\x80\x9cTimes.\xe2\x80\x9d Here,\r\nunder the guidance of the inky apprentice, he had learned to find his\r\nway more or less circuitously about the case, and considered himself an\r\nexpert compositor.\r\n\r\nThe school paper in its locked formes lay on a stone-topped table, a\r\nproof by the side; but not for worlds would Beetle have corrected from\r\nthe mere proof. With a mallet and a pair of tweezers, he knocked out\r\nmysterious wedges of wood that released the forme, picked a letter here\r\nand inserted a letter there, reading as he went along and stopping much\r\nto chuckle over his own contributions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t show off like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do it\r\nfor your living. Upside down and backwards, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if I can\r\nread it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and read those formes in the rack there, if\r\nyou think you know so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFormes in a rack! What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Don\xe2\x80\x99t be so beastly professional.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMcTurk drew off with Stalky to prowl about the office. They left little\r\nunturned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here a shake, Beetle. What\xe2\x80\x99s this thing?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, in a few\r\nminutes. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks familiar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaid Beetle, after a glance: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s King\xe2\x80\x99s Latin prose exam. paper.\r\n_In--In Verrem: actio prima_. What a lark!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink o\xe2\x80\x99 the pure-souled, high-minded boys who\xe2\x80\x99d give their eyes for a\r\nsquint at it!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Willie dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky; \xe2\x80\x9cthat would be wrong and painful to our\r\nkind teachers. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t crib, Willie, would you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t read the beastly stuff, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nleavin\xe2\x80\x99 at the end o\xe2\x80\x99 the term, so it makes no difference to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Member what the Considerate Bloomer did to Spraggon\xe2\x80\x99s account of the\r\nPuffin\xe2\x80\x99ton Hounds? We must sugar Mr. King\xe2\x80\x99s milk for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky,\r\nall lighted from within by a devilish joy. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s see what Beetle can do\r\nwith those forceps he\xe2\x80\x99s so proud of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t see now you can make Latin prose much more cock-eye than it is,\r\nbut we\xe2\x80\x99ll try,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, transposing an _aliud_ and _Asiae_ from two\r\nsentences. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s see! We\xe2\x80\x99ll put that full-stop a little further on,\r\nand begin the sentence with the next capital. Hurrah! Here\xe2\x80\x99s three lines\r\nthat can move up all in a lump.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98One of those scientific rests for which this eminent huntsman is so\r\njustly celebrated.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky knew the Puffington run by heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a _vol_--_voluntate quidnam_ all by itself,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMcTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll attend to her in a shake. _Quidnam_ goes after _Dolabella_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood old Dolabella,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t break him. Vile prose\r\nCicero wrote, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he? He ought to be grateful for--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, over another forme. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat price a giddy ode?\r\n_Qui_--_quis_--oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s _Quis multa gracilis_, o\xe2\x80\x99 course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring it along. We\xe2\x80\x99ve sugared the milk here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, after a few\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x99 zealous toil. \xe2\x80\x9cNever thrash your hounds unnecessarily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Quis munditiis_? I swear that\xe2\x80\x99s not bad,\xe2\x80\x9d began Beetle, plying the\r\ntweezers. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t that interrogation look pretty? _Heu quoties fidem_!\r\nThat sounds as if the chap were anxious an\xe2\x80\x99 excited. _Cui flavam religas\r\nin rosa_--Whose flavor is relegated to a rose. _Mutatosque Deos flebit\r\nin antro_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMute gods weepin\xe2\x80\x99 in a cave,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Pon my Sam, Horace\r\nneeds as much lookin\xe2\x80\x99 after as--Tulke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey edited him faithfully till it was too dark to see.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Aha! _Elucescebat_, quoth our friend.\xe2\x80\x99 Ulpian serves my need, does it?\r\nIf King can make anything out of _that_, I\xe2\x80\x99m a blue-eyed squatteroo,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Beetle, as they slid out of the loft window into a back alley of\r\nold acquaintance and started on a three-mile trot to the College. But\r\nthe revision of the classics had detained them too long. They halted,\r\nblown and breathless, in the furze at the back of the gasometer, the\r\nCollege lights twinkling below, ten minutes at least late for tea and\r\nlock-up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good,\xe2\x80\x9d puffed McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cBet a bob Foxy is waiting for defaulters\r\nunder the lamp by the Fives Court. It\xe2\x80\x99s a nuisance, too, because the\r\nHead gave us long leave, and one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to break it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Let me now from the bonded ware\xe2\x80\x99ouse of my knowledge,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d began Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, rot! Don\xe2\x80\x99t Jorrock. Can we make a run for it?\xe2\x80\x9d snapped McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Bishops\xe2\x80\x99 boots Mr. Radcliffe also condemned, an\xe2\x80\x99 spoke \xe2\x80\x99ighly in favor\r\nof tops cleaned with champagne an\xe2\x80\x99 abricot jam.\xe2\x80\x99 Where\xe2\x80\x99s that thing\r\nCokey was twiddlin\xe2\x80\x99 this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey heard him groping in the wet, and presently beheld a great miracle.\r\nThe lights of the Coastguard cottages near the sea went out; the\r\nbrilliantly illuminated windows of the Golf-club disappeared, and were\r\nfollowed by the frontages of the two hotels. Scattered villas dulled,\r\ntwinkled, and vanished. Last of all, the College lights died also. They\r\nwere left in the pitchy darkness of a windy winter\xe2\x80\x99s night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Blister my kidneys. It _is_ a frost. The dahlias are dead!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nStalky. \xe2\x80\x9cBunk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey squattered through the dripping gorse as the College hummed like\r\nan angry hive and the dining-rooms chorused, \xe2\x80\x9cGas! gas! gas!\xe2\x80\x9d till they\r\ncame to the edge of the sunk path that divided them from their study.\r\nDropping that ha-ha like bullets, and rebounding like boys, they dashed\r\nto their study, in less than two minutes had changed into dry trousers\r\nand coat, and, ostentatiously slippered, joined the mob in the\r\ndining-hall, which resembled the storm-centre of a South American\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Hellish dark and smells of cheese.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky elbowed his way into\r\nthe press, howling lustily for gas. \xe2\x80\x9cCokey must have gone for a walk.\r\nFoxy\xe2\x80\x99ll have to find him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProut, as the nearest house-master, was trying to restore order, for\r\nrude boys were flicking butter-pats across chaos, and McTurk had\r\nturned on the fags\xe2\x80\x99 tea-urn, so that many were parboiled and wept with\r\nan unfeigned dolor. The Fourth and Upper Third broke into the school\r\nsong, the \xe2\x80\x9c_Vive la Compagnie_,\xe2\x80\x9d to the accompaniment of drumming\r\nknife-handles; and the junior forms shrilled bat-like shrieks and\r\nraided one another\xe2\x80\x99s victuals. Two hundred and fifty boys in high\r\ncondition, seeking for more light, are truly earnest inquirers.\r\n\r\nWhen a most vile smell of gas told them that supplies had been renewed,\r\nStalky, waistcoat unbuttoned, sat gorgedly over what might have been\r\nhis fourth cup of tea. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHullo! \xe2\x80\x99Ere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPomponius Ego!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Carson, the head of the school, a simple, straight-minded soul,\r\nand a pillar of the First Fifteen, who crossed over from the prefects\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntable and in a husky, official voice invited the three to attend in his\r\nstudy in half an hour. \xe2\x80\x9cPrefects\xe2\x80\x99 meetin\xe2\x80\x99! Prefects\xe2\x80\x99 meetin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d hissed\r\nthe tables, and they imitated barbarically the actions and effects of\r\nthe ground-ash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are we goin\xe2\x80\x99 to jest with \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, turning half-face to\r\nBeetle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your play this time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, \xe2\x80\x9call I want you to do is not to laugh. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99 to take charge o\xe2\x80\x99 young Tulke\xe2\x80\x99s immorality--_\xc3\xa0 la_ King, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99 to be serious. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t help laughin\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me, or\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go pop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. All right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\nMcTurk\xe2\x80\x99s lank frame stiffened in every muscle and his eyelids dropped\r\nhalf over his eyes. That last was a war-signal.\r\n\r\nThe eight or nine seniors, their faces very set and sober, were ranged\r\nin chairs round Carson\xe2\x80\x99s severely Philistine study. Tulke was not\r\npopular among them, and a few who had had experience of Stalky and\r\nCompany doubted that he might, perhaps, have made an ass of himself. But\r\nthe dignity of the Sixth was to be upheld. So Carson began hurriedly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, you chaps, I\xe2\x80\x99ve--we\xe2\x80\x99ve sent for you to tell you you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\ngood deal too cheeky to the Sixth--have been for some time--and--and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve stood about as much as we\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to, and it seems you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ncursin\xe2\x80\x99 and swearin\xe2\x80\x99 at Tulke on the Bideford road this afternoon, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to show you you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it. That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s awfully good of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we happen to have\r\na few rights of our own, too. You can\xe2\x80\x99t, just because you happen to\r\nbe made prefects, haul up seniors and jaw \xe2\x80\x99em on spec., like a\r\nhouse-master. _We_ aren\xe2\x80\x99t fags, Carson. This kind of thing may do for\r\nDavies Tertius, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t do for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only old Prout\xe2\x80\x99s lunacy that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t prefects long ago. You\r\nknow that,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t any tact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cA prefects\xe2\x80\x99 meetin\xe2\x80\x99 has to be reported to the\r\nHead. I want to know if the Head backs Tulke in this business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--well, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a prefects\xe2\x80\x99 meeting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carson. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nonly called you in to warn you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut all the prefects are here,\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndifference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Gum!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you\xe2\x80\x99ve just called us in for\r\na jaw--after comin\xe2\x80\x99 to us before the whole school at tea an\xe2\x80\x99 givin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nthe impression it was a prefects\xe2\x80\x99 meeting? \xe2\x80\x99Pon my Sam, Carson, you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget into trouble, you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHole-an\xe2\x80\x99-corner business--hole-an\xe2\x80\x99-corner business,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk,\r\nwagging his head. \xe2\x80\x9cBeastly suspicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Sixth looked at each other uneasily. Tulke had called three\r\nprefects\xe2\x80\x99 meetings in two terms, till the Head had informed the Sixth\r\nthat they were expected to maintain discipline without the recurrent\r\nmenace of his authority. Now, it seemed that they had made a blunder at\r\nthe outset, but any right-minded boy would have sunk the legality and\r\nbeen properly impressed by the Court. Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s protest was distinct\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccheek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you chaps deserve a lickin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d cried one Naughten incautiously.\r\nThen was Beetle filled with a noble inspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor interferin\xe2\x80\x99 with Tulke\xe2\x80\x99s amours, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d Tulke turned a rich sloe\r\ncolor. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had your innings.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been sent up for cursing and swearing at you, and we\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nbe let off with a warning! _Are_ we? Now then, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to catch\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I--I--\xe2\x80\x9d Tulke began. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let that young devil start jawing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve anything to say you must say it decently,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 said Carson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecently? I will. Now look here. When we went into Bideford we met\r\nthis ornament of the Sixth--is that decent enough?--hanging about on\r\nthe road with a nasty look in his eye. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know _then_ why he was\r\nso anxious to stop us, _but_ at five minutes to four, when we were in\r\nYeo\xe2\x80\x99s shop, we saw Tulke in broad daylight, _with_ his house-cap on,\r\nkissin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 huggin\xe2\x80\x99 a woman on the pavement. Is that decent enough for\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t--I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe saw you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now--I\xe2\x80\x99ll be decent, Carson--you sneak\r\nback with her kisses\xe2\x80\x9d (not for nothing had Beetle perused the later\r\npoets) \xe2\x80\x9chot on your lips and call prefects\xe2\x80\x99 meetings, which aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nprefects\xe2\x80\x99 meetings, to uphold the honor of the Sixth.\xe2\x80\x9d A new and\r\nheaven-cleft path opened before him that instant. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do we know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he shouted--\xe2\x80\x9chow do we know how many of the Sixth are mixed up in this\r\nabominable affair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, with simple dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe meant to come to you about it quietly, Carson, but you _would_ have\r\nthe meeting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky sympathetically.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth were too taken aback to reply. So, carefully modelling\r\nhis rhetoric on King, Beetle followed up the attack, surpassing and\r\nsurprising himself, \xe2\x80\x9cIt--it isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much the cynical immorality of the\r\nbiznai, as the blatant indecency of it, that\xe2\x80\x99s so awful. As far as we\r\ncan see, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for us to go into Bideford without runnin\xe2\x80\x99 up\r\nagainst some prefect\xe2\x80\x99s unwholesome amours. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to snigger\r\nover, Naughten. _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know much about these things--but\r\nit seems to me a chap must be pretty far dead in sin\xe2\x80\x9d (that was a\r\nquotation from the school chaplain) \xe2\x80\x9cwhen he takes to embracing his\r\nparamours\xe2\x80\x9d (that was Hakluyt) \xe2\x80\x9cbefore all the city\xe2\x80\x9d (a reminiscence of\r\nMilton). \xe2\x80\x9cHe might at least have the decency--you\xe2\x80\x99re authorities on\r\ndecency, I believe--to wait till dark. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t! Oh,\r\nTulke. You--you incontinent little animal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, shut up a minute. What\xe2\x80\x99s all this about, Tulke?\xe2\x80\x9d said Carson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--look here. I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry. I never thought Beetle would take this\r\nline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause--you\xe2\x80\x99ve--no decency--you--thought--I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Beetle all\r\nin one breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTried to cover it all up with a conspiracy, did you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirect insult to all three of us,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cA most filthy mind you\r\nhave, Tulke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll shove you fellows outside the door if you go on like this,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCarson angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat proves it\xe2\x80\x99s a conspiracy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, with the air of a virgin\r\nmartyr.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I was goin\xe2\x80\x99 along the street--I swear I was,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tulke, \xe2\x80\x9cand--and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry about it--a woman came up and kissed me. I swear I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t kiss her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, filled by Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s long, liquid whistle of contempt,\r\namazement, and derision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my honor,\xe2\x80\x9d gulped the persecuted one. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, do stop him jawing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk interjected. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are compelled, of course, to accept\r\nyour statement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Naughten. \xe2\x80\x9cYou aren\xe2\x80\x99t head-prefect here, McTurk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Irishman, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know Tulke better than we do. I\r\nam only speaking for ourselves. _We_ accept Tulke\xe2\x80\x99s word. But all I can\r\nsay is that if I\xe2\x80\x99d been collared in a similarly disgustin\xe2\x80\x99 situation,\r\nand had offered the same explanation Tulke has, I--I wonder what you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave said. However, it seems on Tulke\xe2\x80\x99s word of honor--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Tulkus--beg pardon--_kiss_, of course---Tulkiss is an honorable\r\nman,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--that the Sixth can\xe2\x80\x99t protect \xe2\x80\x99emselves from bein\xe2\x80\x99 kissed when they\r\ngo for a walk!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Beetle, taking up the running with a rush. \xe2\x80\x9cSweet\r\nbusiness, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Cheerful thing to tell the fags, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? We aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nprefects, of course, but we aren\xe2\x80\x99t kissed very much. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\r\nsort of thing ever enters our heads; does it, Stalky?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, turning aside to hide his emotions. McTurk\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nmerely expressed lofty contempt and a little weariness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you seem to know a lot about it,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed a prefect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t help it--when you chaps shove it under our noses.\xe2\x80\x9d Beetle dropped\r\ninto a drawling parody of King\xe2\x80\x99s most biting colloquial style--the\r\ngentle rain after the thunder-storm. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s all very sufficiently\r\nvile and disgraceful, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who comes out of it\r\nworst: Tulke, who happens to have been caught; or the other fellows who\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t. And we--\xe2\x80\x9d here he wheeled fiercely on the other two--\xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to stand up and be jawed by them because we\xe2\x80\x99ve disturbed their\r\nintrigues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it! I only wanted to give you a word of warning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carson,\r\nthereby handing himself bound to the enemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarn? You?\xe2\x80\x9d This with the air of one who finds loathsome gifts in his\r\nlocker. \xe2\x80\x9cCarson, _would_ you be good enough to tell us what conceivable\r\nthing there is that you are entitled to warn us about after this\r\nexposure? Warn? Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little too much! Let\xe2\x80\x99s go somewhere where\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s clean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door banged behind their outraged innocence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Beetle! Beetle! Beetle! Golden Beetle!\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Stalky, hurling\r\nhimself on Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s panting bosom as soon as they reached the study.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever did you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear-r man\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, embracing Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s head with both arms, while\r\nhe swayed it to and fro on the neck, in time to this ancient burden--\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cPretty lips--sweeter than--cherry or plum.\r\n   Always look--jolly and--never look glum;\r\n   Seem to say--Come away. Kissy!--come, come!\r\n   Yummy-yum! Yummy-yum! Yummy-yum-yum!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out. You\xe2\x80\x99ll smash my gig-lamps,\xe2\x80\x9d puffed Beetle, emerging. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit glorious? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I \xe2\x80\x98Eric\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em splendidly? Did you spot my cribs\r\nfrom King? Oh, blow!\xe2\x80\x9d His countenance clouded. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one adjective\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t use--obscene. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I forgot that. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npet ones, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be sendin\xe2\x80\x99 ambassadors round in half a shake to\r\nbeg us not to tell the school. It\xe2\x80\x99s a deuced serious business for them,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Sixth--poor old Sixth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmoral young rips,\xe2\x80\x9d Stalky snorted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an example to pure-souled\r\nboys like you and me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the Sixth in Carson\xe2\x80\x99s study sat aghast, glowering at Tulke, who was\r\non the edge of tears. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the head-prefect acidly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve made\r\na pretty average ghastly mess of it, Tulke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you lick that young devil Beetle before he began\r\njawing?\xe2\x80\x9d Tulke wailed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew there\xe2\x80\x99d be a row,\xe2\x80\x9d said a prefect of Prout\xe2\x80\x99s house. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\r\nwould insist on the meeting, Tulke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and a fat lot of good it\xe2\x80\x99s done us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naughten. \xe2\x80\x9cThey come in\r\nhere and jaw our heads off when we ought to be jawin\xe2\x80\x99 them. Beetle talks\r\nto us as if we were a lot of blackguards and--and all that. And\r\nwhen they\xe2\x80\x99ve hung us up to dry, they go out and slam the door like a\r\nhouse-master. All your fault, Tulke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t kiss her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ass! If you\xe2\x80\x99d said you _had_ and stuck to it, it would have been\r\nten times better than what you did,\xe2\x80\x9d Naughten retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cNow they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell the whole school--and Beetle\xe2\x80\x99ll make up a lot of beastly rhymes and\r\nnick-names.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, hang it, she kissed me!\xe2\x80\x9d Outside of his work, Tulke\xe2\x80\x99s mind moved\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not thinking of you. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of us. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go up to their study\r\nand see if I can make \xe2\x80\x99em keep quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTulke\xe2\x80\x99s awf\xe2\x80\x99ly cut up about this business,\xe2\x80\x9d Naughten began,\r\ningratiatingly, when he found Beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s kissed him this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to ask you chaps, and especially you, Beetle, not to\r\nlet the thing be known all over the school. Of course, fellows as senior\r\nas you are can easily see why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, with the cold reluctance of one who foresees an\r\nunpleasant public duty. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I must go and talk to the Sixth\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least need, my dear chap, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naughten hastily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take any message you care to send.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the chance of supplying the missing adjective was too tempting. So\r\nNaughten returned to that still undissolved meeting, Beetle, white, icy,\r\nand aloof, at his heels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere seems,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, with laboriously crisp articulation, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\r\nseems to be a certain amount of uneasiness among you as to the steps\r\nwe may think fit to take in regard to this last revelation of\r\nthe--ah--obscene. If it is any consolation to you to know that we have\r\ndecided--for the honor of the school, you understand--to keep our mouths\r\nshut as to these--ah--obscenities, you--ah--have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wheeled, his head among the stars, and strode statelily back to his\r\nstudy, where Stalky and McTurk lay side by side upon the table wiping\r\ntheir tearful eyes--too weak to move.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Latin prose paper was a success beyond their wildest dreams.\r\nStalky and McTurk were, of course, out of all examinations (they did\r\nextra-tuition with the Head), but Beetle attended with zeal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, I presume, is a par-ergon on your part,\xe2\x80\x9d said King, as he dealt\r\nout the papers. \xe2\x80\x9cOne final exhibition ere you are translated to loftier\r\nspheres? A last attack on the classics? It seems to confound you\r\nalready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeetle studied the print with knit brows. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ can\xe2\x80\x99t make head or tail\r\nof it,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said King, with scholastic coquetry. \xe2\x80\x9cWe depend upon _you_\r\nto give us the meaning. This is an examination, Beetle mine, not a\r\nguessing-competition. You will find your associates have no difficulty\r\nin--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTulke left his place and laid the paper on the desk. King looked, read,\r\nand turned a ghastly green.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStalky\xe2\x80\x99s missing a heap,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Beetle. \xe2\x80\x9cWonder how King\xe2\x80\x99ll get out\r\nof it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere seems,\xe2\x80\x9d King began with a gulp, \xe2\x80\x9ca certain modicum of truth\r\nin our Beetle\xe2\x80\x99s remark. I am--er--inclined to believe that the worthy\r\nRandall must have dropped this in ferule--if you know what that means.\r\nBeetle, you purport to be an editor. Perhaps you can enlighten the form\r\nas to formes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, sir! Whose form! I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that there\xe2\x80\x99s any verb in this\r\nsentence at all, an\xe2\x80\x99--an\xe2\x80\x99--the Ode is all different, somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was about to say, before you volunteered your criticism, that an\r\naccident must have befallen the paper in type, and that the printer\r\nreset it by the light of nature. No--\xe2\x80\x9d he held the thing at arm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlength--\xe2\x80\x9cour Randall is not an authority on Cicero or Horace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather mean to shove it off on Randall,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Beetle to his\r\nneighbor. \xe2\x80\x9cKing must ha\xe2\x80\x99 been as screwed as an owl when he wrote it\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we can amend the error by dictating it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d The answer came pat from a dozen throats at once. \xe2\x80\x9cThat cuts\r\nthe time for the exam. Only two hours allowed, sir. \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t fair. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na printed-paper exam. How\xe2\x80\x99re we goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be marked for it! It\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nRandall\xe2\x80\x99s fault. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t _our_ fault, anyhow. An exam.\xe2\x80\x99s an exam.,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nNaturally Mr. King considered this was an attempt to undermine his\r\nauthority, and, instead of beginning dictation at once, delivered a\r\nlecture on the spirit in which examinations should be approached. As the\r\nstorm subsided, Beetle fanned it afresh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? What? What was that you were saying to MacLagan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only said I thought the papers ought to have been looked at before\r\nthey were given out, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d from a back bench. Mr. King wished to know whether Beetle\r\ntook it upon himself personally to conduct the traditions of the school.\r\nHis zeal for knowledge ate up another fifteen minutes, during which the\r\nprefects showed unmistakable signs of boredom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was a giddy time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beetle, afterwards, in dismantled Number\r\nFive. \xe2\x80\x9cHe gibbered a bit, and I kept him on the gibber, and then he\r\ndictated about a half of Dolabella & Co.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood old Dolabella! Friend of mine. Yes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, pensively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we had to ask him how every other word was spelt, of course, and\r\nhe gibbered a lot more. He cursed me and MacLagan (Mac played up like a\r\ntrump) and Randall, and the \xe2\x80\x98materialized ignorance of the unscholarly\r\nmiddle classes,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98lust for mere marks,\xe2\x80\x99 and all the rest. It was what\r\nyou might call a final exhibition--a last attack--a giddy par-ergon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut o\xe2\x80\x99 course he was blind squiffy when he wrote the paper. I hope you\r\nexplained _that_?\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. I told Tulke so. I said an immoral prefect an\xe2\x80\x99 a drunken\r\nhouse-master were legitimate inferences. Tulke nearly blubbed. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nawfully shy of us since Mary\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTulke preserved that modesty till the last moment--till the\r\njourney-money had been paid, and the boys were filling the brakes that\r\ntook them to the station. Then the three tenderly constrained him to\r\nwait a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Tulke, you may be a prefect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stalky, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve left the\r\nColl. Do you see, Tulke, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I see. Don\xe2\x80\x99t bear malice, Stalky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStalky? Curse your impudence, you young cub,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Stalky,\r\nmagnificent in top-hat, stiff collar, spats, and high-waisted,\r\nsnuff-colored ulster. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to understand that _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ Mister\r\nCorkran, an\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99re a dirty little schoolboy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides bein\xe2\x80\x99 frabjously immoral,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk. \xe2\x80\x9cWonder you aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nashamed to foist your company on pure-minded boys like us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Tulke,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Naughten, from the prefects\xe2\x80\x99 brake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99re comin\xe2\x80\x99. Shove up and make room, you Collegers. You\xe2\x80\x99ve all\r\ngot to be back next term, with your \xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Oh, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No\r\nsir\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Please sir\xe2\x80\x99; but before we say good-by we\xe2\x80\x99re going to tell you\r\na little story. Go on, Dickie\xe2\x80\x9d (this to the driver); \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re quite ready.\r\nKick that hat-box under the seat, an\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t crowd your Uncle Stalky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs nice a lot of high-minded youngsters as you\xe2\x80\x99d wish to see,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMcTurk, gazing round with bland patronage. \xe2\x80\x9cA trifle immoral, but\r\nthen--boys will be boys. It\xe2\x80\x99s no good tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to look stuffy, Carson.\r\n_Mister_ Corkran will now oblige with the story of Tulke an\xe2\x80\x99 Mary Yeo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVES OF THE LAMP.\r\n\r\nPart II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat very Infant who told the story of the capture of Boh Na Ghee\r\n[_A Conference_ _of the Powers_: \xe2\x80\x9cMany Inventions\xe2\x80\x9d] to Eustace Cleaver,\r\nnovelist, inherited an estateful baronetcy, with vast revenues, resigned\r\nthe service, and became a landholder, while his mother stood guard over\r\nhim to see that he married the right girl. But, new to his position, he\r\npresented the local volunteers with a full-sized magazine-rifle range,\r\ntwo miles long, across the heart of his estate, and the surrounding\r\nfamilies, who lived in savage seclusion among woods full of pheasants,\r\nregarded him as an erring maniac. The noise of the firing disturbed\r\ntheir poultry, and Infant was cast out from the society of J.P.\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\ndecent men till such time as a daughter of the county might lure him\r\nback to right thinking. He took his revenge by filling the house\r\nwith choice selections of old schoolmates home on leave--affable\r\ndetrimentals, at whom the bicycle-riding maidens of the surrounding\r\nfamilies were allowed to look from afar. I knew when a troop-ship was in\r\nport by the Infant\xe2\x80\x99s invitations. Sometimes he would produce old friends\r\nof equal seniority; at others, young and blushing giants whom I had left\r\nsmall fags far down in the Lower Second; and to these Infant and the\r\nelders expounded the whole duty of man in the Army.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had to cut the service,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Infant; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s no reason\r\nwhy my vast stores of experience should be lost to posterity.\xe2\x80\x9d He was\r\njust thirty, and in that same summer an imperious wire drew me to his\r\nbaronial castle: \xe2\x80\x9cGot good haul; ex _Tamar_. Come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an unusually good haul, arranged with a single eye to my benefit.\r\nThere was a baldish, broken-down captain of Native Infantry, shivering\r\nwith ague behind an indomitable red nose--and they called him Captain\r\nDickson. There was another captain, also of Native Infantry, with a fair\r\nmustache; his face was like white glass, and his hands were fragile, but\r\nhe answered joyfully to the cry of Tertius. There was an enormously\r\nbig and well-kept man, who had evidently not campaigned for years,\r\nclean-shaved, soft-voiced, and cat-like, but still Abanazar for all that\r\nhe adorned the Indian Political Service; and there was a lean Irishman,\r\nhis face tanned blue-black with the suns of the Telegraph Department.\r\nLuckily the baize doors of the bachelors\xe2\x80\x99 wing fitted tight, for we\r\ndressed promiscuously in the corridor or in each other\xe2\x80\x99s rooms, talking,\r\ncalling, shouting, and anon waltzing by pairs to songs of Dick Four\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown devising.\r\n\r\nThere were sixty years of mixed work to be sifted out between us,\r\nand since we had met one another from time to time in the quick\r\nscene-shifting of India--a dinner, camp, or a race-meeting here; a\r\ndak-bungalow or railway station up country somewhere else--we had never\r\nquite lost touch. Infant sat on the banisters, hungrily and enviously\r\ndrinking it in. He enjoyed his baronetcy, but his heart yearned for the\r\nold days.\r\n\r\nIt was a cheerful babel of matters personal, provincial, and imperial,\r\npieces of old call-over lists, and new policies, cut short by the roar\r\nof a Burmese gong, and we went down not less than a quarter of a mile of\r\nstairs to meet Infant\xe2\x80\x99s mother, who had known us all in our school-days\r\nand greeted us as if those had ended a week ago. But it was\r\nfifteen years since, with tears of laughter, she had lent me a gray\r\nprincess-skirt for amateur theatricals.\r\n\r\nThat was a dinner from the \xe2\x80\x9cArabian Nights,\xe2\x80\x9d served in an eighty-foot\r\nhall full of ancestors and pots of flowering roses, and, what was more\r\nimpressive, heated by steam. When it was ended and the little mother had\r\ngone away--(\xe2\x80\x9cYou boys want to talk, so I shall say good-night now\xe2\x80\x9d)--we\r\ngathered about an apple-wood fire, in a gigantic polished steel grate,\r\nunder a mantel-piece ten feet high, and the Infant compassed us about\r\nwith curious liqueurs and that kind of cigarette which serves best to\r\nintroduce your own pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, bliss!\xe2\x80\x9d grunted Dick Four from a sofa, where he had been packed\r\nwith a rug over him. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been warm since I came home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were all nearly on top of the fire, except Infant, who had been long\r\nenough at home to take exercise when he felt chilled. This is a grisly\r\ndiversion, but much affected by the English of the Island.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you say a word about cold tubs and brisk walks,\xe2\x80\x9d drawled McTurk,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you, Infant. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a liver, too. \xe2\x80\x99Member when we used\r\nto think it a treat to turn out of our beds on a Sunday\r\nmorning--thermometer fifty-seven degrees if it was summer--and bathe off\r\nthe Pebbleridge? Ugh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Thing I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius, \xe2\x80\x9cwas the way we chaps used to\r\ngo down into the lavatories, boil ourselves pink, and then come up with\r\nall our pores open into a young snow-storm or a black frost. Yet none of\r\nour chaps died, that I can remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalkin\xe2\x80\x99 of baths,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, with a chuckle, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99member our bath in\r\nNumber Five, Beetle, the night Rabbits-Eggs rocked King? What wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI give to see old Stalky now! He is the only one of the two Studies not\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStalky is the great man of his Century,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you know?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four, scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been in a\r\ntight place with Stalky you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him since the camp at Pindi in \xe2\x80\x9987,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99 strong then--about seven feet high and four feet through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdequate chap. Infernally adequate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius, pulling his mustache\r\nand staring into the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot dam\xe2\x80\x99 near court-martialed and broke in Egypt in \xe2\x80\x9984,\xe2\x80\x9d the Infant\r\nvolunteered. \xe2\x80\x9cI went out in the same trooper with him--as raw as he was.\r\nOnly _I_ showed it, and Stalky didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, reaching forward absently to twitch\r\nmy dress-tie into position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing. His colonel trusted him to take twenty Tommies out to\r\nwash, or groom camels, or something at the back of Suakin, and Stalky\r\ngot embroiled with Fuzzies five miles in the interior. He conducted a\r\nmasterly retreat and wiped up eight of \xe2\x80\x99em. He knew jolly well he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nno right to go out so far, so he took the initiative and pitched in a\r\nletter to his colonel, who was frothing at the mouth, complaining of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x99paucity of support accorded to him in his operations.\xe2\x80\x99 Gad, it might\r\nhave been one fat brigadier slangin\xe2\x80\x99 another! Then he went into the\r\nStaff Corps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat--is--entirely--Stalky,\xe2\x80\x9d said Abanazar from his arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve come across him, too?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied in his softest tones. \xe2\x80\x9cI was at the tail of\r\nthat--that epic. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you chaps know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe did not--Infant, McTurk, and I; and we called for information very\r\npolitely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius. \xe2\x80\x9cWe got into a mess up in the\r\nKhye-Kheen Hills a couple o\xe2\x80\x99 years ago, and Stalky pulled us through.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMcTurk gazed at Tertius with all an Irishman\xe2\x80\x99s contempt for the\r\ntongue-tied Saxon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s you and your likes govern Ireland.\r\nTertius, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you ashamed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell a yarn. I can chip in when the other fellow starts\r\n_bukhing_. Ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to Dick Four, whose nose gleamed\r\nscornfully over the rug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a whiskey and soda. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen drinking lemon-squash and ammoniated quinine while you chaps were\r\nbathin\xe2\x80\x99 in champagne, and my head\xe2\x80\x99s singin\xe2\x80\x99 like a top.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wiped his ragged mustache above the drink; and, his teeth chattering\r\nin his head, began: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the Khye-Kheen-Mal\xc3\xb4t expedition, when\r\nwe scared the souls out of \xe2\x80\x99em with a field force they daren\xe2\x80\x99t fight\r\nagainst? Well, both tribes--there was a coalition against us--came in\r\nwithout firing a shot; and a lot of hairy villains, who had no more\r\npower over their men than I had, promised and vowed all sorts of things.\r\nOn that very slender evidence, Pussy dear--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was at Simla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Abanazar, hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, you\xe2\x80\x99re tarred with the same brush. On the strength of\r\nthose tuppenny-ha\xe2\x80\x99penny treaties, your asses of Politicals reported the\r\ncountry as pacified, and the Government, being a fool, as usual, began\r\nroad-makin\xe2\x80\x99--dependin\xe2\x80\x99 on local supply for labor. \xe2\x80\x99Member _that_, Pussy?\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Rest of our chaps who\xe2\x80\x99d had no look-in during the campaign didn\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99d be any more of it, and were anxious to get back to India. But\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d been in two of these little rows before, and I had my suspicions.\r\nI engineered myself, _summa ingenio_, into command of a road-patrol--no\r\nshovellin\xe2\x80\x99, only marching up and down genteelly with a guard. They\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwithdrawn all the troops they could, but I nucleused about forty\r\nPathans, recruits chiefly, of my regiment, and sat tight at the\r\nbase-camp while the road-parties went to work, as per Political survey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad some rippin\xe2\x80\x99 sing-songs in camp, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy pup\xe2\x80\x9d--thus did Dick Four refer to his subaltern--\xe2\x80\x9cwas a pious\r\nlittle beast. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the sing-songs, and so he went down with\r\npneumonia. I rootled round the camp, and found Tertius gassing about as\r\na D.A.Q.M.G., which, God knows, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t cut out for. There were six\r\nor eight of the old Coll. at base-camp (we\xe2\x80\x99re always in force for a\r\nfrontier row), but I\xe2\x80\x99d heard of Tertius as a steady old hack, and I told\r\nhim he had to shake off his D.A.Q.M.G. breeches and help _me_. Tertius\r\nvolunteered like a shot, and we settled it with the authorities, and out\r\nwe went--forty Pathans, Tertius, and me, looking up the road-parties.\r\nMacnamara\xe2\x80\x99s--\xe2\x80\x99member old Mac, the Sapper, who played the fiddle so\r\ndamnably at Umballa?--Mac\xe2\x80\x99s party was the last but one. The last was\r\nStalky\xe2\x80\x99s. He was at the head of the road with some of his pet Sikhs. Mac\r\nsaid he believed he was all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStalky _is_ a Sikh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius. \xe2\x80\x9cHe takes his men to pray at the\r\nDurbar Sahib at Amritzar, regularly as clockwork, when he can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt, Tertius. It was about forty miles beyond Mac\xe2\x80\x99s before\r\nI found him; and my men pointed out gently, but firmly, that the country\r\nwas risin\xe2\x80\x99. What kind o\xe2\x80\x99 country, Beetle? Well, _I_\xe2\x80\x99m no word-painter,\r\nthank goodness, but _you_ might call it a hellish country! When we\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t up to our necks in snow, we were rolling down the khud. The\r\nwell-disposed inhabitants, who were to supply labor for the road-making\r\n(don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that, Pussy dear), sat behind rocks and took pot-shots\r\nat us. \xe2\x80\x98Old, old story! We all legged it in search of Stalky. I had a\r\nfeeling that he\xe2\x80\x99d be in good cover, and about dusk we found him and his\r\nroad-party, as snug as a bug in a rug, in an old Mal\xc3\xb4t stone fort, with\r\na watch-tower at one corner. It overhung the road they had blasted\r\nout of the cliff fifty feet below; and under the road things went down\r\npretty sheer, for five or six hundred feet, into a gorge about half a\r\nmile wide and two or three miles long. There were chaps on the other\r\nside of the gorge scientifically gettin\xe2\x80\x99 our range. So I hammered on\r\nthe gate and nipped in, and tripped over Stalky in a greasy, bloody old\r\nposhteen, squatting on the ground, eating with his men. I\xe2\x80\x99d only seen\r\nhim for half a minute about three months before, but I might have met\r\nhim yesterday. He waved his hand all sereno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Hullo, Aladdin! Hullo, Emperor!\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re just in time for the\r\nperformance.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw his Sikhs looked a bit battered. \xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s your command? Where\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour subaltern?\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Here--all there is of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stalky. \xe2\x80\x98If you want young Everett,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s dead, and his body\xe2\x80\x99s in the watch-tower. They rushed our road-party\r\nlast week, and got him and seven men. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been besieged for five days.\r\nI suppose they let you through to make sure of you. The whole country\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nup. \xe2\x80\x99Strikes me you\xe2\x80\x99ve walked into a first-class trap.\xe2\x80\x99 He grinned, but\r\nneither Tertius nor I could see where the deuce the fun was. We hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nany grub for our men, and Stalky had only four days\xe2\x80\x99 whack for his. That\r\ncame of dependin\xe2\x80\x99 upon your asinine Politicals, Pussy dear, who told us\r\nthat the inhabitants were friendly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make us _quite_ comfy, Stalky took us up to the watch-tower to see\r\npoor Everett\xe2\x80\x99s body, lyin\xe2\x80\x99 in a foot o\xe2\x80\x99 drifted snow. It looked like a\r\ngirl of fifteen--not a hair on the little fellow\xe2\x80\x99s face. He\xe2\x80\x99d been shot\r\nthrough the temple, but the Mal\xc3\xb4ts had left their mark on him. Stalky\r\nunbuttoned the tunic, and showed it to us--a rummy sickle-shaped cut on\r\nthe chest. \xe2\x80\x99Member the snow all white on his eyebrows, Tertius? \xe2\x80\x99Member\r\nwhen Stalky moved the lamp and it looked as if he was alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe-es,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius, with a shudder. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Member the beastly look on\r\nStalky\xe2\x80\x99s face, though, with his nostrils all blown out, same as he used\r\nto look when he was bullyin\xe2\x80\x99 a fag? That was a lovely evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe held a council of war up there over Everett\xe2\x80\x99s body. Stalky said the\r\nMal\xc3\xb4ts and Khye-Kheens were up together; havin\xe2\x80\x99 sunk their blood feuds\r\nto settle us. The chaps we\xe2\x80\x99d seen across the gorge were Khye-Kheens. It\r\nwas about half a mile from them to us as a bullet flies, and they\xe2\x80\x99d made\r\na line of sungars under the brow of the hill to sleep in and starve us\r\nout. The Mal\xc3\xb4ts, he said, were in front of us promiscuous. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngood cover behind the fort, or they\xe2\x80\x99d have been there, too. Stalky\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mind the Mal\xc3\xb4ts half as much as he did the Khye-Kheens. He said\r\nthe Mal\xc3\xb4ts were treacherous curs. What I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand was, why\r\nin the world the two gangs didn\xe2\x80\x99t join in and rush us. There must have\r\nbeen at least five hundred of \xe2\x80\x99em. Stalky said they didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust each\r\nother very well, because they were ancestral enemies when they were\r\nat home; and the only time they\xe2\x80\x99d tried a rush he\xe2\x80\x99d hove a couple of\r\nblasting-charges among \xe2\x80\x99em, and that had sickened \xe2\x80\x99em a bit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was dark by the time we finished, and Stalky, always serene, said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You command now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you mind my taking any action I may\r\nconsider necessary to reprovision the fort?\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98Of course not,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand then the lamp blew out. So Tertius and I had to climb down the tower\r\nsteps (we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to stay with Everett) and got back to our men.\r\nStalky had gone off--to count the stores, I supposed. Anyhow, Tertius\r\nand I sat up in case of a rush (they were plugging at us pretty\r\ngenerally, you know), relieving each other till the mornin\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMornin\xe2\x80\x99 came. No Stalky. Not a sign of him. I took counsel with his\r\nsenior native officer--a grand, white-whiskered old chap--Rutton Singh,\r\nfrom Jullunder-way. He only grinned, and said it was all right. Stalky\r\nhad been out of the fort twice before, somewhere or other, accordin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nhim. He said Stalky \xe2\x80\x99ud come back unchipped, and gave me to understand\r\nthat Stalky was an invulnerable _Guru_ of sorts. All the same, I put the\r\nwhole command on half rations, and set \xe2\x80\x99em to pickin\xe2\x80\x99 out loopholes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout noon there was no end of a snow-storm, and the enemy stopped\r\nfiring. We replied gingerly, because we were awfully short of\r\nammunition. Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose we fired five shots an hour, but we generally\r\ngot our man. Well, while I was talking with Rutton Singh I saw Stalky\r\ncoming down from the watch-tower, rather puffy about the eyes, his\r\nposhteen coated with claret-colored ice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No trustin\xe2\x80\x99 these snow-storms,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Nip out quick and snaffle\r\nwhat you can get. There\xe2\x80\x99s a certain amount of friction between the\r\nKhye-Kheens and the Mal\xc3\xb4ts just now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI turned Tertius out with twenty Pathans, and they bucked about in the\r\nsnow for a bit till they came on to a sort of camp about eight hundred\r\nyards away, with only a few men in charge and half a dozen sheep by\r\nthe fire. They finished off the men, and snaffled the sheep and as much\r\ngrain as they could carry, and came back. No one fired a shot at \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nThere didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be anybody about, but the snow was falling pretty\r\nthick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s good enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stalky when we got dinner ready and he was\r\nchewin\xe2\x80\x99 mutton-kababs off a cleanin\xe2\x80\x99 rod. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no sense riskin\xe2\x80\x99 men.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re holding a pow-wow between the Khye-Kheens and the Mal\xc3\xb4ts at\r\nthe head of the gorge. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think these so-called coalitions are much\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what that maniac had done? Tertius and I shook it out of\r\nhim by instalments. There was an underground granary cellar-room below\r\nthe watch-tower, and in blasting the road Stalky had blown a hole into\r\none side of it. Being no one else _but_ Stalky, he\xe2\x80\x99d kept the hole open\r\nfor his own ends; and laid poor Everett\xe2\x80\x99s body slap over the well of the\r\nstairs that led down to it from the watch-tower. He\xe2\x80\x99d had to move and\r\nreplace the corpse every time he used the passage. The Sikhs wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nnear the place, of course. Well, he\xe2\x80\x99d got out of this hole, and dropped\r\non to the road. Then, in the night _and_ a howling snow-storm, he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ndropped over the edge of the khud, made his way down to the bottom of\r\nthe gorge, forded the nullah, which was half frozen, climbed up on the\r\nother side along a track he\xe2\x80\x99d discovered, and come out on the right\r\nflank of the Khye-Kheens. He had then--listen to this!--crossed over a\r\nridge that paralleled their rear, walked half a mile behind that, and\r\ncome out on the left of their line where the gorge gets shallow and\r\nwhere there was a regular track between the Mal\xc3\xb4t and the Khye-Kheen\r\ncamps. That was about two in the morning, and, as it turned out, a man\r\nspotted him--a Khye-Kheen. So Stalky abolished him quietly, and left\r\nhim--_with_ the Mal\xc3\xb4t mark on his chest, same as Everett had.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I was just as economical as I could be,\xe2\x80\x99 Stalky said to us. \xe2\x80\x98If he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nshouted I should have been slain. I\xe2\x80\x99d never had to do that kind of thing\r\nbut once before, and that was the first time I tried that path. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperfectly practicable for infantry, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What about your first man?\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that was the night after they killed Everett, and I went out\r\nlookin\xe2\x80\x99 for a line of retreat for my men. A man found me. I abolished\r\nhim--_privatim_--scragged him. But on thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 it over it occurred to\r\nme that if I could find the body (I\xe2\x80\x99d hove it down some rocks) I might\r\ndecorate it with the Mal\xc3\xb4t mark and leave it to the Khye-Kheens to draw\r\ninferences. So I went out again the next night and did. The Khye-Kheens\r\nare shocked at the Mal\xc3\xb4ts perpetratin\xe2\x80\x99 these two dastardly outrages\r\nafter they\xe2\x80\x99d sworn to sink all bleed feuds. I lay up behind their\r\nsungars early this morning and watched \xe2\x80\x99em. They all went to confer\r\nabout it at the head of the gorge. Awf\xe2\x80\x99ly annoyed they are. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwonder.\xe2\x80\x99 You know the way Stalky drops out his words, one by one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Infant, explosively, as the full depth of the\r\nstrategy dawned on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear-r man!\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, purring rapturously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStalky stalked,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all there is to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember how he insisted\r\nthat he had only applied his luck? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember how Rutton Singh\r\ngrabbed his boots and grovelled in the snow, and how our men shouted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of our Pathans believed that was luck,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius. \xe2\x80\x9cThey swore\r\nStalky ought to have been born a Pathan, and--\xe2\x80\x99member we nearly had a\r\nrow in the fort when Rutton Singh said Stalky was a Pathan? Gad, how\r\nfurious the old chap was with my Jemadar! But Stalky just waggled his\r\nfinger and they shut up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Rutton Singh\xe2\x80\x99s sword was half out, though, and he swore he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncremate every Khye-Kheen and Mal\xc3\xb4t he killed. That made the Jemadar\r\npretty wild, because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind fighting against his own creed, but\r\nhe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to crab a fellow Mussulman\xe2\x80\x99s chances of Paradise. Then\r\nStalky jabbered Pushtu and Punjabi in alternate streaks. Where the deuce\r\ndid he pick up his Pushtu from, Beetle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind his language, Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cGive us the gist of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI flatter myself I can address the wily Pathan on occasion, but, hang\r\nit all, I can\xe2\x80\x99t make puns in Pushtu, or top off my arguments with a\r\nsmutty story, as he did. He played on those two old dogs o\xe2\x80\x99 war like\r\na--like a concertina. Stalky said--and the other two backed up his\r\nknowledge of Oriental nature--that the Khye-Kheens and the Mal\xc3\xb4ts\r\nbetween \xe2\x80\x99em would organize a combined attack on us that night, as\r\na proof of good faith. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t drive it home, though, because\r\nneither side would trust the other on account, as Rutton Singh put it,\r\nof the little accidents. Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s notion was to crawl out at dusk with\r\nhis Sikhs, manoeuvre \xe2\x80\x99em along this ungodly goat-track that he\xe2\x80\x99d found,\r\nto the back of the Khye-Kheen position, and then lob in a few long shots\r\nat the Mal\xc3\xb4ts when the attack was well on. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99ll divert their minds\r\nand help to agitate \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Then you chaps can come out and\r\nsweep up the pieces, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll rendezvous at the head of the gorge.\r\nAfter that, I move we get back to Mac\xe2\x80\x99s camp and have something to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ were commandin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d the Infant suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was about three months senior to Stalky, and two months Tertius\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsenior,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick Four replied. \xe2\x80\x9c_But_ we were all from the same old Coll.\r\nI should say ours was the only little affair on record where some one\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t jealous of some one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_We_ weren\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Tertius broke in, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there was another row between Gul\r\nSher Khan and Rutton Singh. Our Jemadar said--he was quite right--that\r\nno Sikh living could stalk worth a damn; and that Koran Sahib had better\r\ntake out the Pathans, who understood that kind of mountain work. Rutton\r\nSingh said that Koran Sahib jolly well knew every Pathan was a born\r\ndeserter, and every Sikh was a gentleman, even if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t crawl on\r\nhis belly. Stalky struck in with some woman\xe2\x80\x99s proverb or other, that had\r\nthe effect of doublin\xe2\x80\x99 both men up with a grin. He said the Sikhs and\r\nthe Pathans could settle their claims on the Khye-Kheens and\r\nMal\xc3\xb4ts later on, but he was going to take his Sikhs along for this\r\nmountain-climbing job, because Sikhs could shoot. They can, too. Give\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em a mule-load of ammunition apiece, and they\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd out he gat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as it was dark, and he\xe2\x80\x99d had\r\na bit of a snooze, him and thirty Sikhs went down through the staircase\r\nin the tower, every mother\xe2\x80\x99s son of \xe2\x80\x99em salutin\xe2\x80\x99 little Everett where\r\nIt stood propped up against the wall. The last I heard him say was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kubbadar! tumbleinga! [Look out; you\xe2\x80\x99ll fall!] and they tumbleingaed\r\nover the black edge of nothing. Close upon 9 p.m. the combined attack\r\ndeveloped; Khye-Kheens across the valley, and Mal\xc3\xb4ts in front of us,\r\npluggin\xe2\x80\x99 at long range and yellin\xe2\x80\x99 to each other to come along and cut\r\nour infidel throats. Then they skirmished up to the gate, and began the\r\nold game of calling our Pathans renegades, and invitin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em to join the\r\nholy war. One of our men, a young fellow from Dera Ismail, jumped on\r\nthe wall to slang \xe2\x80\x99em back, and jumped down, blubbing like a child. He\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen hit smack in the middle of the hand. \xe2\x80\x98Never saw a man yet who could\r\nstand a hit in the hand without weepin\xe2\x80\x99 bitterly. It tickles up all the\r\nnerves. So Tertius took his rifle and smote the others on the head to\r\nkeep them quiet at the loopholes. The dear children wanted to open the\r\ngate and go in at \xe2\x80\x99em generally, but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t suit our book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last, near midnight, I heard the wop, wop, wop, of Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s Martinis\r\nacross the valley, and some general cursing among the Mal\xc3\xb4ts, whose\r\nmain body was hid from us by a fold in the hillside. Stalky was brownin\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em at a great rate, and very naturally they turned half right and began\r\nto blaze at their faithless allies, the Khye-Kheens--regular volley\r\nfirin\xe2\x80\x99. In less than ten minutes after Stalky opened the diversion they\r\nwere going it hammer and tongs, both sides the valley. When we could\r\nsee, the valley was rather a mixed-up affair. The Khye-Kheens had\r\nstreamed out of their sungars above the gorge to chastise the Mal\xc3\xb4ts,\r\nand Stalky--I was watching him through my glasses--had slipped in behind\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em. Very good. The Khye-Kheens had to leg it along the hillside up to\r\nwhere the gorge got shallow and they could cross over to the Mal\xc3\xb4ts,\r\nwho were awfully cheered to see the Khye-Kheens taken in the rear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it occurred to me to comfort the Khye-Kheens. So I turned out the\r\nwhole command, and we advanced _\xc3\xa0 la pas de charge_, doublin\xe2\x80\x99 up what,\r\nfor the sake of argument, we\xe2\x80\x99ll call the Mal\xc3\xb4ts\xe2\x80\x99 left flank. Even then,\r\nif they\xe2\x80\x99d sunk their differences, they could have eaten us alive;\r\nbut they\xe2\x80\x99d been firin\xe2\x80\x99 at each other half the night, and they went on\r\nfirin\xe2\x80\x99. Queerest thing you ever saw in your born days! As soon as our\r\nmen doubled up to the Mal\xc3\xb4ts, they\xe2\x80\x99d blaze at the Khye-Kheens more\r\nzealously than ever, to show they were on our side, run up the valley\r\na few hundred yards, and halt to fire again. The moment Stalky saw our\r\ngame he duplicated it his side the gorge; and, by Jove! the Khye-Kheens\r\ndid just the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve forgot him playin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99Arrah, Patsy, mind\r\nthe baby\xe2\x80\x99 on the bugle to hurry us up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he?\xe2\x80\x9d roared McTurk. Somehow we all began to sing it, and there was\r\nan interruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius, when we were quiet. No one of the Aladdin\r\ncompany could forget that tune. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he played \xe2\x80\x98Patsy.\xe2\x80\x99 Go on, Dick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four, \xe2\x80\x9cwe drove both mobs into each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms on\r\na bit of level ground at the head of the valley, and saw the whole crew\r\nwhirl off, fightin\xe2\x80\x99 and stabbin\xe2\x80\x99 and swearin\xe2\x80\x99 in a blindin\xe2\x80\x99 snow-storm.\r\nThey were a heavy, hairy lot, and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t follow \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStalky had captured one prisoner--an old pensioned Sepoy of twenty-five\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x99 service, who produced his discharge--an awf\xe2\x80\x99ly sportin\xe2\x80\x99 old card.\r\nHe had been tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to make his men rush us early in the day. He was\r\nsulky--angry with his own side for their cowardice, and Rutton Singh\r\nwanted to bayonet him--Sikhs don\xe2\x80\x99t understand fightin\xe2\x80\x99 against the\r\nGovernment after you\xe2\x80\x99ve served it honestly--but Stalky rescued him, and\r\nfroze on to him tight--with ulterior motives, I believe. When we got\r\nback to the fort, we buried young Everett--Stalky wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of\r\nblowin\xe2\x80\x99 up the place--and bunked. We\xe2\x80\x99d only lost ten men, all told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly ten, out of seventy. How did you lose \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there was a rush on the fort early in the night, and a few Mal\xc3\xb4ts\r\ngot over the gate. It was rather a tight thing for a minute or two, but\r\nthe recruits took it beautifully. Lucky job we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any badly wounded\r\nmen to carry, because we had forty miles to Macnamara\xe2\x80\x99s camp. By Jove,\r\nhow we legged it! Half way in, old Rutton Singh collapsed, so we slung\r\nhim across four rifles and Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat; and Stalky, his prisoner,\r\nand a couple of Sikhs were his bearers. After that I went to sleep. You\r\ncan, you know, on the march, when your legs get properly numbed. Mac\r\nswears we all marched into his camp snoring and dropped where we halted.\r\nHis men lugged us into the tents like gram-bags. I remember wakin\xe2\x80\x99 up\r\nand seeing Stalky asleep with his head on old Rutton Singh\xe2\x80\x99s chest. _He_\r\nslept twenty-four hours. I only slept seventeen, but then I was coming\r\ndown with dysentery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing down? What rot! He had it on him before we joined Stalky in the\r\nfort,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _you_ needn\xe2\x80\x99t talk! You hove your sword at Macnamara and demanded\r\na drum-head court-martial every time you saw him. The only thing that\r\nsoothed you was putting you under arrest every half hour. You were off\r\nyour head for three days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t remember a word of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius, placidly. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember my\r\norderly giving me milk, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did Stalky come out?\xe2\x80\x9d McTurk demanded, purling hard over his pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStalky? Like a serene Brahmini bull. Poor old Mac was at his Royal\r\nEngineers\xe2\x80\x99 wits\xe2\x80\x99 end to know what to do. You see I was putrid with\r\ndysentery, Tertius was ravin\xe2\x80\x99, half the men had frost-bite, and\r\nMacnamara\xe2\x80\x99s orders were to break camp and come in before winter. So\r\nStalky, who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t turned a hair, took half his supplies to save him\r\nthe bother o\xe2\x80\x99 luggin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em back to the plains, and all the ammunition he\r\ncould get at, and, _consilio et auxilio_ Rutton Singhi, tramped back to\r\nhis fort with all his Sikhs and his precious prisoners, _and_ a lot of\r\ndissolute hangers-on that he and the prisoner had seduced into service.\r\nHe had sixty men of sorts--and his brazen cheek. Mac nearly wept with\r\njoy when he went. You see there weren\xe2\x80\x99t any explicit orders to Stalky\r\nto come in before the passes were blocked: Mac is a great man for\r\norders, and Stalky\xe2\x80\x99s a great man for orders--when they suit his book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me he was goin\xe2\x80\x99 to the Engadine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius. \xe2\x80\x9cSat on my cot\r\nsmokin\xe2\x80\x99 a cigarette, and makin\xe2\x80\x99 me laugh till I cried. Macnamara bundled\r\nthe whole lot of us down to the plains next day. We were a walkin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhospital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStalky told me that Macnamara was a simple godsend to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick\r\nFour. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to see him in Mac\xe2\x80\x99s tent listenin\xe2\x80\x99 to Mac playin\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nfiddle, and, between the pieces, wheedlin\xe2\x80\x99 Mac out of picks and shovels\r\nand dynamite cartridges hand-over-fist. Well, that was the last we saw\r\nof Stalky. A week or so later the passes were shut with snow, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think Stalky wanted to be found particularly just then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fair and fat Abanazar. \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Ho, ho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick Four threw up his thin, dry hand with the blue veins at the back of\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cHold on a minute, Pussy; I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you in at the proper time. I went\r\ndown to my regiment, and that spring, five mouths later, I got off\r\nwith a couple of companies on detachment: nominally to look after some\r\nfriends of ours across the border; actually, of course, to recruit.\r\nIt was a bit unfortunate, because an ass of a young Naick carried a\r\nfrivolous blood-feud he\xe2\x80\x99d inherited from his aunt into those hills, and\r\nthe local gentry wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t volunteer into my corps. Of course, the Naick\r\nhad taken short leave to manage the business; that was all regular\r\nenough; _but_ he\xe2\x80\x99d stalked my pet orderly\xe2\x80\x99s uncle. It was an infernal\r\nshame, because I knew Harris of the Ghuznees would be covering that\r\nground three months later, and he\xe2\x80\x99d snaffle all the chaps I had my eyes\r\non. Everybody was down on the Naick, because they felt he ought to\r\nhave had the decency to postpone his--his disgustful amours till our\r\ncompanies were full strength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill the beast had a certain amount of professional feeling left.\r\nHe sent one of his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s clan by night to tell me that, if I\xe2\x80\x99d take\r\nsafeguard, he\xe2\x80\x99d put me on to a batch of beauties. I nipped over the\r\nborder like a shot, and about ten miles the other side, in a nullah,\r\nmy rapparee-in-charge showed me about seventy men variously armed, but\r\nstanding up like a Queen\xe2\x80\x99s company. Then one of \xe2\x80\x99em stepped out and\r\nlugged round an old bugle, just like--who\xe2\x80\x99s the man?--Bancroft, ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?--feeling for his eye-glass in a farce, and played \xe2\x80\x98Arrah, Patsy,\r\nmind the baby. Arrah, Patsy, mind\xe2\x80\x99--that was as for as he could get.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat, also, was as far as Dick Four could get, because we had to sing\r\nthe old song through twice, again and once more, and subsequently, in\r\norder to repeat it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe explained that if I knew the rest of the song he had a note for me\r\nfrom the man the song belonged to. Whereupon, my children, I finished\r\nthat old tune on that bugle, and _this_ is what I got. I knew you\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nto look at it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t grab.\xe2\x80\x9d (We were all struggling for a sight of the\r\nwell-known unformed handwriting.) \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll read it aloud.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Fort Everett, February 19.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Dear Dick, or Tertius: The bearer of this is in charge of seventy-five\r\nrecruits, all pukka devils, but desirous of leading new lives. They have\r\nbeen slightly polished, and after being boiled may shape well. I want\r\nyou to give thirty of them to my adjutant, who, though God\xe2\x80\x99s own ass,\r\nwill need men this spring. The rest you can keep. You will be interested\r\nto learn that I have extended my road to the end of the Mal\xc3\xb4t country.\r\nAll headmen and priests concerned in last September\xe2\x80\x99s affair worked one\r\nmonth each, supplying road metal from their own houses. Everett\xe2\x80\x99s grave\r\nis covered by a forty-foot mound, which should serve well as a base for\r\nfuture triangulations. Rutton Singh sends his best salaams. I am\r\nmaking some treaties, and have given my prisoner--who also sends his\r\nsalaams--local rank of Khan Bahadur.        \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A. L. Cockran.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that was all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four, when the roaring, the shouting,\r\nthe laughter, and, I think, the tears, had subsided. \xe2\x80\x9cI chaperoned the\r\ngang across the border as quick as I could. They were rather homesick,\r\nbut they cheered up when they recognized some of my chaps, who had been\r\nin the Khye-Kheen row, and they made a rippin\xe2\x80\x99 good lot. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather\r\nmore than three hundred miles from Fort Everett to where I picked \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nup. Now, Pussy, tell \xe2\x80\x99em the latter end o\xe2\x80\x99 Stalky as you saw it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbanazar laughed a little nervous, misleading, official laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much. I was at Simla in the spring, when our Stalky, out\r\nof his snows, began corresponding direct with the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the manner of a king,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Dick Four.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy turn now, Dick. He\xe2\x80\x99d done a whole lot of things he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ndone, and constructively pledged the Government to all sorts of action.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Pledged the State\xe2\x80\x99s ticker, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, with a nod to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout that; but the embarrassin\xe2\x80\x99 part was that it was all so thunderin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nconvenient, so well reasoned, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? Came in as pat as if he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhad access to all sorts of information--which he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius, \xe2\x80\x9cI back Stalky against the Foreign Office any\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d done pretty nearly everything he could think of, except strikin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncoins in his own image and superscription, all under cover of buildin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthis infernal road and bein\xe2\x80\x99 blocked by the snow. His report was simply\r\namazin\xe2\x80\x99. Von Lennaert tore his hair over it at first, and then he\r\ngasped, \xe2\x80\x98Who the dooce is this unknown Warren Hastings? He must be\r\nslain. He must be slain officially! The Viceroy\xe2\x80\x99ll never stand it. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunheard of. He must be slain by his Excellency in person. Order him up\r\nhere and pitch in a stinger.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, I sent him no end of an official\r\nstinger, and I pitched in an unofficial telegram at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d This with amazement from the Infant, for Abanazar resembled\r\nnothing so much as a fluffy Persian cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Abanazar. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twasn\xe2\x80\x99t much, but after what you\xe2\x80\x99ve said,\r\nDicky, it was rather a coincidence, because I wired:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Aladdin now has got his wife,\r\n   Your Emperor is appeased.\r\n   I think you\xe2\x80\x99d better come to life:\r\n   We hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve all been pleased.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFunny how that old song came up in my head. That was fairly\r\nnon-committal and encouragin\xe2\x80\x99. The only flaw was that his Emperor\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t appeased by very long chalks. Stalky extricated himself from his\r\nmountain fastnesses and loafed up to Simla at his leisure, to be offered\r\nup on the horns of the altar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d I began, \xe2\x80\x9csurely the Commander-in-Chief is the proper--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Excellency had an idea that if he blew up one single junior\r\ncaptain--same as King used to blow us up--he was holdin\xe2\x80\x99 the reins\r\nof empire, and, of course, as long as he had that idea, Von Lennaert\r\nencouraged him. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure Von Lennaert didn\xe2\x80\x99t put that notion into\r\nhis head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve changed the breed, then, since my time,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99aps. Stalky was sent up for his wiggin\xe2\x80\x99 like a bad little boy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nreason to believe that His Excellency\xe2\x80\x99s hair stood on end. He walked\r\ninto Stalky for one hour--Stalky at attention in the middle of the\r\nfloor, and (so he vowed) Von Lennaert pretending to soothe down His\r\nExcellency\xe2\x80\x99s topknot in dumb show in the background. Stalky didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare\r\nto look up, or he\xe2\x80\x99d have laughed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, wherefore was Stalky not broken publicly?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Infant, with a\r\nlarge and luminous leer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, wherefore?\xe2\x80\x9d said Abanazar. \xe2\x80\x9cTo give him a chance to retrieve his\r\nblasted career, and not to break his father\xe2\x80\x99s heart. Stalky hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nfather, but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. He behaved like a--like the Sanawar\r\nOrphan Asylum, and His Excellency graciously spared him. Then he came\r\nround to my office and sat opposite me for ten minutes, puffing out his\r\nnostrils. Then he said, \xe2\x80\x98Pussy, if I thought that basket-hanger--\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah! He remembered _that_,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That two-anna basket-hanger governed India, I swear I\xe2\x80\x99d become a\r\nnaturalized Muscovite to-morrow. I\xe2\x80\x99m a _femme incomprise_. This thing\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbroken my heart. It\xe2\x80\x99ll take six months\xe2\x80\x99 shootin\xe2\x80\x99-leave in India to mend\r\nit. Do you think I can get it, Pussy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe got it in about three minutes and a half, and seventeen days later\r\nhe was back in the arms of Rutton Singh--horrid disgraced--with orders\r\nto hand over his command, etc., to Cathcart MacMonnie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObserve!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four. \xe2\x80\x9cOne colonel of the Political Department in\r\ncharge of thirty Sikhs, on a hilltop. Observe, my children!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally, Cathcart not being a fool, even if he _is_ a Political, let\r\nStalky do his shooting within fifteen miles of Fort Everett for the\r\nnext six months, and I always understood they and Rutton Singh _and_\r\nthe prisoner were as thick as thieves. Then Stalky loafed back to his\r\nregiment, I believe. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen him since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, swelling with pride.\r\n\r\nWe all turned as one man. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was at the beginning of this hot weather.\r\nI was in camp in the Jullunder doab and stumbled slap on Stalky in\r\na Sikh village; sitting on the one chair of state, with half the\r\npopulation grovellin\xe2\x80\x99 before him, a dozen Sikh babies on his knees,\r\nan old harridan clappin\xe2\x80\x99 him on the shoulder, and a garland o\xe2\x80\x99 flowers\r\nround his neck. Told me he was recruitin\xe2\x80\x99. We dined together that night,\r\nbut he never said a word of the business at the Fort. Told me, though,\r\nthat if I wanted any supplies I\xe2\x80\x99d better say I was Koran Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s _bhai_;\r\nand I did, and the Sikhs wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take my money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! That must have been one of Rutton Singh\xe2\x80\x99s villages,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick\r\nFour; and we smoked for some time in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d said McTurk, casting back through the years, \xe2\x80\x9cdid Stalky ever\r\ntell you _how_ Rabbits-Eggs came to rock King that night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four. Then McTurk told. \xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four,\r\nnodding. \xe2\x80\x9cPractically he duplicated that trick over again. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnobody like Stalky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just where you make the mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIndia\xe2\x80\x99s full of\r\nStalkies--Cheltenham and Haileybury and Marlborough chaps--that we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow anything about, and the surprises will begin when there is really a\r\nbig row on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho will be surprised?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick Four.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other side. The gentlemen who go to the front in first-class\r\ncarriages. Just imagine Stalky let loose on the south side of Europe\r\nwith a sufficiency of Sikhs and a reasonable prospect of loot. Consider\r\nit quietly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something in that, but you\xe2\x80\x99re too much of an optimist, Beetle,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the Infant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to be. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t I responsible for the whole thing? You\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh. Who wrote \xe2\x80\x98Aladdin now has got his wife\xe2\x80\x99--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that got to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tertius.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProve it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Infant.\r\n\r\nAnd I have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Stalky & Co., by Rudyard Kipling\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK STALKY & CO. ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 3006-0.txt or 3006-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/0/3006/\r\n\r\nProduced by A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
