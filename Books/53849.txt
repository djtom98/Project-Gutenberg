Carlyle\r\n\r\nWithout symbolism there can be no literature; indeed, not even\r\nlanguage. What are words themselves but symbols, almost as arbitrary\r\nas the letters which compose them, mere sounds of the voice to which\r\nwe have agreed to give certain significations, as we have agreed to\r\ntranslate these sounds by those combinations of letters? Symbolism\r\nbegan with the first words uttered by the first man, as he named\r\nevery living thing; or before them, in heaven, when God named the\r\nworld into being. And we see, in these beginnings, precisely what\r\nSymbolism in literature really is: a form of expression, at the best\r\nbut approximate, essentially but arbitrary, until it has obtained\r\nthe force of a convention, for an unseen reality apprehended by the\r\nconsciousness. It is sometimes permitted to us to hope that our\r\nconvention is indeed the reflection rather than merely the sign of that\r\nunseen reality. We have done much if we have found a recognisable sign.\r\n\r\n"A symbol," says Comte Goblet d\'Alviella, in his book on _The Migration\r\nof Symbols,_ "might be defined as a representation which does not aim\r\nat being a reproduction." Originally, as he points out, used by the\r\nGreeks to denote "the two halves of the tablet they divided between\r\nthemselves as a pledge of hospitality," it came to be used of every\r\nsign, formula, or rite by which those initiated in any mystery made\r\nthemselves secretly known to one another. Gradually the word extended\r\nits meaning, until it came to denote every conventional representation\r\nof idea by form, of the unseen by the visible. "In a Symbol," says\r\nCarlyle, "there is concealment and yet revelation: hence, therefore, by\r\nSilence and by Speech acting together, comes a double significance."\r\nAnd, in that fine chapter of _Sartor Resartus,_ he goes further,\r\nvindicating for the word its full value: "In the Symbol proper, what we\r\ncan call a Symbol, there is ever, more or less distinctly and directly,\r\nsome embodiment and revelation of the Infinite; the Infinite is made\r\nto blend itself with the Finite, to stand visible, and as it were,\r\nattainable there."\r\n\r\nIt is in such a sense as this that the word Symbolism has been used to\r\ndescribe a movement which, during the last generation, has profoundly\r\ninfluenced the course of French literature. All such words, used\r\nof anything so living, variable, and irresponsible as literature,\r\nare, as symbols themselves must so often be, mere compromises, mere\r\nindications. Symbolism, as seen in the writers of our day, would have\r\nno value if it were not seen also, under one disguise or another, in\r\nevery great imaginative writer. What distinguishes the Symbolism of\r\nour day from the Symbolism of the past; is that it has _now_ become\r\nconscious of itself, in a sense in which it was unconscious even\r\nin G\xc3\xa9rard de Nerval, to whom I trace the particular origin of the\r\nliterature which I call Symbolist. The forces which mould the thought\r\nof men change, or men\'s resistance to them slackens; with the change\r\nof men\'s thought comes a change of literature, alike in its inmost\r\nessence and in its outward form: after the world has starved its soul\r\nlong enough in the contemplation and the re-arrangement of material\r\nthings, comes the turn of the soul; and with it comes the literature of\r\nwhich I write in this volume, a literature in which the visible world\r\nis no longer a reality, and the unseen world no longer a dream.\r\n\r\nThe great epoch in French literature which preceded this epoch was that\r\nof the offshoot of Romanticism which produced Baudelaire, Flaubert, the\r\nGoncourts, Taine, Zola, Leconte de Lisle. Taine was the philosopher\r\nboth of what had gone before him and of what came immediately after;\r\nso that he seems to explain at once Flaubert and Zola. It was the\r\nage of Science, the age of material things; and words, with that\r\nfacile elasticity which there is in them, did miracles in the exact\r\nrepresentation of everything that visibly existed, exactly as it\r\nexisted. Even Baudelaire, in whom the spirit is always an uneasy guest\r\nat the orgie of life, had a certain theory of Realism which tortures\r\nmany of his poems into strange, metallic shapes, and fills them with\r\nimitative odours, and disturbs them with a too deliberate rhetoric of\r\nthe flesh? Flaubert, the one impeccable novelist who has ever lived,\r\nwas resolute to be the novelist of a world in which art, formal art,\r\nwas the only escape from the burden of reality, and in which the soul\r\nwas of use mainly as the agent of fine literature. The Goncourts\r\ncaught at Impressionism to render the fugitive aspects of a world\r\nwhich existed only as a thing of flat spaces, and angles, and coloured\r\nmovement, in which sun and shadow were the artists; as moods, no less\r\nflitting, were the artists of the merely receptive consciousnesses of\r\nmen and women. Zola has tried to build in brick and mortar inside the\r\ncovers of a book; he is quite sure that the soul is a nervous fluid,\r\nwhich he is quite sure some man of science is about to catch for us, as\r\na man of science has bottled the air, a pretty, blue liquid. Leconte\r\nde Lisle turned the world to stone, but saw, beyond the world, only a\r\npause from misery in a Nirvana never subtilised to the Eastern ecstasy.\r\nAnd, with all these writers, form aimed above all things at being\r\nprecise, at saying rather than suggesting, at saying what they had to\r\nsay so completely that nothing remained over, which it might be the\r\nbusiness of the reader to divine. And so they have expressed, finally,\r\na certain aspect of the world; and some of them have carried style to\r\na point beyond which the style that says, rather than suggests, cannot\r\ngo. The whole of that movement comes to a splendid funeral in M. de\r\nHeredia\'s sonnets, in which the literature of form says its last word,\r\nand dies.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, something which is vaguely called Decadence had come into\r\nbeing. That name, rarely used with any precise meaning, was usually\r\neither hurled as a reproach or hurled back as a defiance. It pleased\r\nsome young men in various countries to call themselves Decadents, with\r\nall the thrill of unsatisfied virtue masquerading as uncomprehended\r\nvice. As a matter of fact, the term is in its place only when applied\r\nto style; to that ingenious deformation of the language, in Mallarm\xc3\xa9\r\nfor instance, which can be compared I with what we are accustomed to\r\ncall the Greek and Latin of the Decadence. No doubt perversity of\r\nform and perversity often found together, and, among the lesser men\r\nespecially, experiment was carried far, not only in the direction of\r\nstyle. But a movement which in this sense might be called Decadent\r\ncould but have been a straying aside from the main road of literature.\r\nNothing, not even conventional virtue, is so provincial as conventional\r\nvice and the desire to "bewilder the middle-classes" is itself\r\nmiddle-class. The interlude, half a mock-interlude, of Decadence,\r\ndiverted the attention of the critics while something more serious was\r\nin preparation. That something more serious has crystallised, for the\r\ntime, under the form of Symbolism, in which art returns to the one\r\npathway, leading through beautiful things to the eternal beauty.\r\n\r\nIn most of the writers whom I have dealt with as summing up in\r\nthemselves all that is best in Symbolism, it will be noticed that the\r\nform is very carefully elaborated, and seems to count for at least\r\nas much as in those writers of whose over-possession by form I have\r\ncomplained. Here, however, all this elaboration comes from a very\r\ndifferent motive and leads to other ends. There is such a thing as\r\nperfecting form that form may be annihilated. All the art of Verlaine\r\nis in bringing verse to a bird\'s song, the art of Mallarm\xc3\xa9 in bringing\r\nverse to the song of an orchestra. In Villiers de l\'Isle-Adam drama\r\nbecomes an embodiment of spiritual forces, in Maeterlinck not even\r\ntheir embodiment, but the remote sound of, their voices. It is all\r\nan attempt to spiritualise literature, to evade the old bondage of\r\nrhetoric, the old bondage of exteriority. Description is banished that\r\nbeautiful things may be evoked, magically; the regular beat of verse is\r\nbroken in order that words may fly, upon subtler wings. Mystery is no\r\nlonger feared, as the great mystery in whose midst we are islanded was\r\nfeared by those to whom that unknown sea was only a great void. We are\r\ncoming closer to nature, as we seem to shrink from it with something\r\nof horror, disdaining to catalogue the trees of the forest. And as we\r\nbrush aside the accidents of daily life, in which men and women imagine\r\nthat they are alone touching reality, we come closer to humanity, to\r\neverything in humanity that may have begun before the world and may\r\noutlast it.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in this revolt against exteriority, against rhetoric,\r\nagainst a materialistic tradition; in this endeavour to disengage the\r\nultimate essence, the soul, of whatever, exists and can be realized by\r\nthe consciousness; in this dutiful waiting upon every symbol by which\r\nthe soul of things can be made visible, literature, bowed down by so\r\nmany burdens, may at last attain liberty, and its authentic speech.\r\nIn attaining this liberty, it accepts a heavier burden; for in speaking\r\nto us so intimately, so solemnly, as only religion had hitherto spoken\r\nto us, it becomes itself a kind of religion, with all the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of the sacred ritual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBALZAC\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe first man who has completely understood Balzac is Rodin, and it\r\nhas taken Rodin ten years to realise his own conception. France has\r\nrefused the statue in which a novelist is represented as a dreamer,\r\nto whom Paris is not so much Paris as Patmos: "the most Parisian of\r\nour novelists," Frenchmen assure you. It is more than a hundred years\r\nsince Balzac was born: a hundred years is a long time in which to be\r\nmisunderstood with admiration.\r\n\r\nIn choosing the name of the _Human Comedy_ for a series of novels in\r\nwhich, as he says, there is at once "the history and the criticism\r\nof society, the analysis of its evils, and the discussion of its\r\nprinciples," Balzac proposed to do for the modern world what Dante,\r\nin his _Divine Comedy,_ had done for the world of the Middle Ages.\r\nCondemned to write in prose, and finding his opportunity in that\r\nrestriction, he created for himself a form which is perhaps the nearest\r\nequivalent for the epic or the poetic drama, and the only form in\r\nwhich, at all events, the epic is now possible. The world of Dante was\r\nmaterially simple compared with the world of the nineteenth century;\r\nthe "visible world" had not yet begun to "exist," in its tyrannical\r\nmodern sense; the complications of the soul interested only the\r\nSchoolmen, and were a part of theology; poetry could still represent\r\nan age and yet be poetry. But to-day poetry can no longer represent\r\nmore than the soul of things; it had taken refuge from the terrible\r\nimprovements of civilisation in a divine seclusion, where it sings,\r\ndisregarding the many voices of the street. Prose comes offering its\r\ninfinite capacity for detail; and it is by the infinity of its detail\r\nthat the novel, as Balzac created it, has become the modern epic.\r\n\r\nThere had been great novels, indeed, before Balzac, but no great\r\nnovelist; and the novels themselves are scarcely what we should to-day\r\ncall by that name. The interminable _Astr\xc3\xa9e_ and its companions form\r\na link between the _fabliaux_ and the novel, and from them developed\r\nthe characteristic eighteenth-century _conte,_ in narrative, letters,\r\nor dialogue, as we see it in Marivaux, Laclos, Crebillon _fils,_\r\nCrebillon\'s longer works, including _Le Sopha,_ with their conventional\r\nparaphernalia of Eastern fable, are extremely tedious; but in two\r\nshort pieces, _La Nuit et le Moment_ and _Le Hasard du Coin du Feu,_\r\nhe created a model of witty, naughty, deplorably natural comedy, which\r\nto this day is one of the most characteristic French forms of fiction.\r\nProperly, however, it is a form of the drama rather than of the novel.\r\nLaclos, in _Les Liaisons Dangereuses,_ a masterpiece which scandalised\r\nthe society that adored Crebillon, because its naked human truth left\r\nno room for sentimental excuses, comes much nearer to prefiguring the\r\nnovel (as Stendhal, for instance, is afterward to conceive it), but\r\nstill preserves the awkward traditional form of letters. Marivaux had\r\nindeed already seemed to suggest the novel of analysis, but in a style\r\nwhich has christened a whole manner of writing that precisely which\r\nis least suited to the writing of fiction. Voltaire\'s _contes, La\r\nReligieuse_ of Diderot, are tracts or satires in which the story is\r\nonly an excuse for the purpose. Rousseau, too, has his purpose, even\r\nin _La Nouvelle H\xc3\xa9loise,_ but it is a humanising purpose; and with\r\nthat book the novel of passion comes into existence, and along with it\r\nthe descriptive novel. Yet with Rousseau this result is an accident of\r\ngenius; we cannot call him a novelist; and we find him abandoning the\r\nform he has found, for another, more closely personal, which suits him\r\nbetter. Restif de la Bretonne, who followed Rousseau at a distance, not\r\naltogether wisely, developed the form of half-imaginary autobiography\r\nin _Monsieur Nicolas,_ a book of which the most significant part may be\r\ncompared with Hazlitt\'s _Liber Amoris._ Morbid and even mawkish as it\r\nis, it has a certain uneasy, unwholesome humanity in its confessions,\r\nwhich may seem to have set a fashion only too scrupulously followed\r\nby modern French novelists. Meanwhile, the Abb\xc3\xa9 Pr\xc3\xa9vost\'s one great\r\nstory, _Manon Lescaut,_ had brought for once a purely objective study,\r\nof an incomparable simplicity, into the midst of these analyses of\r\ndifficult souls; and then we return to the confession, in the works of\r\nothers not novelists: Benjamin Constant, Mme. de Sta\xc3\xabl, Chateaubriand,\r\nin _Adolphe, Corinne, Ren\xc3\xa9._ At once we are in the Romantic movement,\r\na movement which begins lyrically among poets, and at first with a\r\ncurious disregard of the more human part of humanity.\r\n\r\nBalzac worked contemporaneously with the Romantic movement, but he\r\nworked outside it, and its influence upon him is felt only in an\r\noccasional pseudo-romanticism, like the episode of the pirate in _La\r\nFemme de Trente Ans._ His vision of humanity was essentially a poetic\r\nvision, but he was a poet whose dreams were facts. Knowing that, as\r\nMme. Necker has said, "the novel should be the better world," he knew\r\nalso that "the novel would be nothing if, in that august lie, it were\r\nnot true in details." And in the _Human Comedy_ he proposed to himself\r\nto do for society more than Buffon had done for the animal world.\r\n\r\n"There is but one animal," he declares, in his _Avant-Propos,_ with\r\na confidence which Darwin has not yet come to justify. But "there\r\nexists, there will always exist, social species, as there are\r\nzoological species." "Thus the work to be done will have a triple\r\nform: men, women, and things; that is to say, human beings and the\r\nmaterial representation which they give to their thought; in short,\r\nman and life." And, studying after nature, "French society will be the\r\nhistorian, I shall need to be no more than the secretary." Thus will be\r\nwritten "the history forgotten by so many historians, the history of\r\nmanners." But that is not all, for "passion is the whole of humanity."\r\n"In realizing clearly the drift of the composition, it will be seen\r\nthat I assign to facts, constant, daily, open, or secret, to the acts\r\nof individual life, to their causes and principles, as much importance\r\nas historians had formerly attached to the events of the public life\r\nof nations." "Facts gathered together and painted as they are, with\r\npassion for element," is one of his definitions of the task he has\r\nundertaken. And in a letter to Mme. de Hanska, he summarises every\r\ndetail of his scheme.\r\n\r\n"The _\xc3\x89tudes des M\xc5\x93urs_ will represent social effects, without a\r\nsingle situation of life, or a physiognomy, or a character of man or\r\nwoman, or a manner of life, or a profession, or a social zone, or a\r\ndistrict of France, or anything pertaining to childhood, old age, or\r\nmaturity, politics, justice, or war, having been forgotten.\r\n\r\n"That laid down, the history of the human heart traced link by link,\r\nthe history of society made in all its details, we have the base....\r\n\r\n"Then, the second stage is the _\xc3\x89tudes philosophiques,_ for after the\r\n_effects_ come the _causes._ In the _\xc3\x89tudes des M\xc5\x93urs_ I shall have\r\npainted the sentiments and their action, life and the fashion of life.\r\nIn the _\xc3\x89tudes philosophiques_ I shall say _why the sentiments, on what\r\nthe life...._\r\n\r\n"Then, after the _effects_ and the _causes,_ come the _\xc3\x89tudes\r\nanalytiques,_ to which the _Physiologie du mariage_ belongs, for, after\r\nthe _effects_ and the _causes,_ one should seek the _principles...._\r\n\r\n"After having done the poetry, the demonstration, of a whole system, I\r\nshall do the science in the _Essai sur les forces humaines._ And, on\r\nthe bases of this palace I shall have traced the immense arabesque of\r\nthe _Cent Contes drolatiques_!"\r\n\r\nQuite all that, as we know, was not carried out; but there, in its\r\nintention, is the plan; and after twenty years\' work the main part of\r\nit, certainly, was carried out. Stated with this precise detail, it\r\nhas something of a scientific air, as of a too deliberate attempt upon\r\nthe sources of life by one of those systematic French minds which are\r\nso much more logical than facts. But there is one little phrase to be\r\nnoted: "La passion est toute l\'humanit\xc3\xa9." All Balzac is in that phrase.\r\n\r\nAnother French novelist, following, as he thought, the example of the\r\n_Human Comedy,_ has endeavoured to build up a history of his own time\r\nwith even greater minuteness. But _Les Rougon-Macquart_ is no more\r\nthan system; Zola has never understood that detail without life is the\r\nwardrobe without the man. Trying to outdo Balzac on his own ground,\r\nhe has made the fatal mistake of taking him only on his systematic\r\nside, which in Balzac is subordinate to a great creative intellect,\r\nan incessant, burning thought about men and women, a passionate human\r\ncuriosity for which even his own system has no limits. "The misfortunes\r\nof the _Birotteaus,_ the priest and the perfumer," he says, in his\r\n_Avant-Propos,_ taking an example at random, "are, for me, those of\r\nhumanity." To Balzac manners are but the vestment of life; it is\r\nlife that he seeks; and life, to him (it is his own word) is but the\r\nvestment of thought. Thought is at the root of all his work, a whole\r\nsystem of thought, in which philosophy is but another form of poetry;\r\nand it is from this root of idea that the _Human Comedy_ springs.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe two books into which Balzac has put his deepest thought, the two\r\nbooks which he himself cared for the most, are _S\xc3\xa9raphita_ and _Louis\r\nLambert._ Of _Louis Lambert_ he said: "I write it for myself and a few\r\nothers"; of _S\xc3\xa9raphita:_ "My life is in it." "One could write _Goriot_\r\nany day," he adds; "_S\xc3\xa9raphita only once_ in a lifetime." I have never\r\nbeen able to feel that _S\xc3\xa9raphita_ is altogether a success. It lacks\r\nthe breadth of life; it is glacial. True, he aimed at producing very\r\nmuch such an effect; and it is, indeed, full of a strange, glittering\r\nbeauty, the beauty of its own snows. But I find in it at the same time\r\nsomething a little factitious, a sort of romanesque, not altogether\r\nunlike the sentimental romanesque of Novalis; it has not done the\r\nimpossible, in humanising abstract speculation, in fusing mysticism and\r\nthe novel. But for the student of Balzac it has extraordinary interest;\r\nfor it is at once the base and the summit of the _Human Comedy._ In a\r\nletter to Mme. de Hanska, written in 1837, four years after _S\xc3\xa9raphita_\r\nhad been begun, he writes: "I am not orthodox, and I do not believe in\r\nthe Roman Church. Swedenborgianism, which is but a repetition, in the\r\nChristian sense, of ancient ideas, is my religion, with this addition:\r\nthat I believe in the incomprehensibility of God." _S\xc3\xa9raphita_ is a\r\nprose poem in which the most abstract part of that mystical system,\r\nwhich Swedenborg perhaps materialised too crudely, is presented in a\r\nwhite light, under a single, superhuman image. In _Louis Lambert_ the\r\nsame fundamental conceptions are worked out in the study of a perfectly\r\nhuman intellect, "an intelligent gulf," as he truly calls it; a sober\r\nand concise history of ideas in their devouring action upon a feeble\r\nphysical nature. In these two books we see directly, and not through\r\nthe coloured veil of human life, the mind in the abstract of a thinker\r\nwhose power over humanity was the power of abstract thought. They show\r\nthis novelist, who has invented the description of society, by whom\r\nthe visible world has been more powerfully felt than by any other\r\nnovelist, striving to penetrate the correspondences which exist between\r\nthe human and the celestial existence. He would pursue the soul to its\r\nlast resting-place before it takes flight from the body; further, on\r\nits disembodied flight; he would find out God, as he comes nearer and\r\nnearer to finding out the secret of life. And realising, as he does\r\nso profoundly, that there is but one substance, but one ever-changing\r\nprinciple of life, "one vegetable, one animal, but a continual\r\nintercourse," the world is alive with meaning for him, a more intimate\r\nmeaning than it has for others. "The least flower is a thought, a life\r\nwhich corresponds to some lineaments of the great whole, of which he\r\nhas the constant intuition." And so, in his concerns with the world, he\r\nwill find spirit everywhere; nothing for him will be inert matter,\r\neverything will have its particle of the universal life. One of those\r\ndivine spies, for whom the world has no secrets, he will be neither\r\npessimist nor optimist; he will accept the world as a man accepts the\r\nwoman whom he loves, as much, for her defects as for her virtues.\r\nLoving the world for its own sake, he will find it always beautiful,\r\nequally beautiful in all its parts. Now let us look at the programme\r\nwhich he traced for the _Human Comedy,_ let us realise it in the light\r\nof this philosophy, and we are at the beginning of a conception of what\r\nthe _Human Comedy_ really is.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThis visionary, then, who had apprehended for himself an idea of God,\r\nset himself to interpret human life more elaborately than any one else.\r\nHe has been praised for his patient observation; people have thought\r\nthey praised him in calling him a realist; it has been discussed how\r\nfar his imitation of life was the literal truth of the photograph.\r\nBut to Balzac the word realism was an insult. Writing his novels at\r\nthe rate of eighteen hours a day, in a feverish solitude, he never had\r\nthe time to observe patiently. It is humanity seen in a mirror, the\r\nhumanity which comes to the great dreamers, the great poets, humanity\r\nas Shakespeare saw it. And so in him, as in all the great artists,\r\nthere is something more than nature, a divine excess. This something\r\nmore than nature should be the aim of the artist, not merely the\r\naccident which happens to him against his will. We require of him a\r\nworld like our own, but a world infinitely more vigorous, interesting,\r\nprofound; more beautiful with that kind of beauty which nature finds\r\nof itself for art. It is the quality of great creative art to give\r\nus so much life that we are almost overpowered by it, as by an air\r\nalmost too vigorous to breathe: the exuberance of creation which makes\r\nthe Sibyl of Michelangelo something more than human, which makes\r\nLear something more than human, in one kind or another of divinity.\r\n\r\nBalzac\'s novels are full of strange problems and great passions turned\r\naside from nothing which presented itself in nature; and his mind was\r\nalways turbulent with the magnificent contrasts and caprices of fate.\r\nA devouring passion of thought burned on all the situations by which\r\nhumanity expresses itself, in its flight from the horror of immobility.\r\nTo say that the situations which he chose are often romantic is but\r\nto say that he followed the soul and the senses faithfully on their\r\nstrangest errands. Our probable novelists of to-day are afraid of\r\nwhatever emotion might be misinterpreted in a gentleman. Believing, as\r\nwe do now, in nerves and a fatalistic heredity, we have left but little\r\nroom for the dignity and disturbance of violent emotion. To Balzac,\r\nhumanity had not changed since the days when \xc5\x92dipus was blind and\r\nPhiloctetes cried in the cave; and equally great miseries were still\r\npossible to mortals, though they were French and of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAnd thus he creates, like the poets, a humanity more logical than\r\naverage life; more typical, more sub-divided among the passions, and\r\nhaving in its veins an energy almost more than human. He realised, as\r\nthe Greeks did, that human life is made up of elemental passions and\r\nnecessity; but he was the first to realise that in the modern world\r\nthe pseudonym of necessity is money. Money and the passions rule the\r\nworld of his _Human Comedy._\r\n\r\nAnd, at the root of the passions, determining their action, he saw\r\n"those nervous fluids, or that unknown substance which, in default of\r\nanother term, we must call the will." No word returns oftener to his\r\npen. For him the problem is invariable. Man has a given quantity of\r\nenergy; each man a different quantity: how will he spend it? A novel\r\nis the determination in action of that problem. And he is equally\r\ninterested in every form of energy, in every egoism, so long as it\r\nis fiercely itself. This pre-occupation with the force, rather than\r\nwith any of its manifestations, gives him his singular impartiality,\r\nhis absolute lack of prejudice; for it gives him the advantage of an\r\nabstract point of view, the unchanging fulcrum for a lever which turns\r\nin every direction; and as nothing once set vividly in motion by any\r\nform of human activity is without interest for him, he makes every\r\npoint of his vast chronicle of human affairs equally interesting to his\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nBaudelaire has observed profoundly that every character in the _Human\r\nComedy_ has something of Balzac, has genius. To himself, his own genius\r\nwas entirely expressed in that word "will." It recurs constantly in his\r\nletters. "Men of will are rare!" he cries. And, at a time when he had\r\nturned night into day for his labour: "I rise every night with a keener\r\nwill than that of yesterday." "Nothing wearies me," he says, "neither\r\nwaiting nor happiness." He exhausts the printers, whose fingers can\r\nhardly keep pace with his brain; they call him, he reports proudly, "a\r\nman-slayer." And he tries to express himself: "I have always had in me\r\nsomething, I know not what, which made me do differently from others;\r\nand, with me, fidelity is perhaps no more than pride. Having only\r\nmyself to rely upon, I have had to strengthen, to build up that self."\r\nThere is a scene in _La Cousine Bette_ which gives precisely Balzac\'s\r\nown sentiment of the supreme value of energy. The Baron Hulot, ruined\r\non every side, and by his own fault, goes to Jos\xc3\xa9pha, a mistress who\r\nhad cast him off in the time of his prosperity, and asks her to lodge\r\nhim for a few days in a garret. She laughs, pities, and then questions\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"\'Est-ce vrai, vieux,\' reprit-elle, \'que tu as tu\xc3\xa9 ton fr\xc3\xa8re et ton\r\noncle, ruin\xc3\xa9 ta famille, surhypoth\xc3\xa9qu\xc3\xa9 la maison de tes enfants et\r\nmang\xc3\xa9 la grenouille du gouvernement en Afrique avec la princesse?\'\r\n\r\n"Le Baron inclina tristement la t\xc3\xaate.\r\n\r\n"\'Eh bien, j\'aime cela!\' s\'\xc3\xa9cria Jos\xc3\xa9pha, qui se leva pleine\r\nd\'enthousiasme. \'C\'est un _br\xc3\xbblage_ g\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9ral! c\'est sardanapale! c\'est\r\ngrand! c\'est complet! On est une canaille, mais on a du c\xc5\x93ur.\'"\r\n\r\nThe cry is Balzac\'s, and it is a characteristic part of his genius to\r\nhave given it that ironical force by uttering it through the mouth\r\nof a Jos\xc3\xa9pha. The joy of the human organism at its highest point of\r\nactivity: that is what interests him supremely. How passionate, how\r\nmoving he becomes whenever he has to speak of a real passion, a mania,\r\nwhether of a lover for his mistress, of a philosopher for his idea,\r\nof a miser for his gold, of a Jew dealer for masterpieces! His style\r\nclarifies, his words become flesh and blood; he is the lyric poet. And\r\nfor him every idealism is equal: the gourmandise of Pons is not less\r\nserious, nor less sympathetic, not less perfectly realised, than the\r\nsearch of Cla\xc3\xabs after the Absolute. "The great and terrible clamour of\r\negoism" is the voice to which he is always attentive; "those eloquent\r\nfaces, proclaiming a soul abandoned to an idea as to a remorse," are\r\nthe faces with whose history he concerns himself. He drags to light the\r\nhidden joys of the _amateur,_ and with especial delight those that are\r\nhidden deepest, under the most deceptive coverings. He deifies them\r\nfor their energy, he fashions the world of his _Human Comedy_ in their\r\nservice, as the real world exists, all but passive, to be the pasture\r\nof these supreme egoists.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nIn all that he writes of life, Balzac seeks the soul; but it is the\r\nsoul as nervous fluid, the executive soul, not the contemplative soul,\r\nthat, with rare exceptions, he seeks. He would surprise the motive\r\nforce of life: that is his _recherche de l\'Absolu;_ he figures it to\r\nhimself as almost a substance, and he is the alchemist on its track.\r\n"Can man by thinking find out God?" Or life, he would have added; and\r\nhe would have answered the question with at least a Perhaps.\r\n\r\nAnd of this visionary, this abstract thinker, it must be said that his\r\nthought translates itself always into terms of life. Pose before him\r\na purely mental problem, and he will resolve it by a scene in which\r\nthe problem literally works itself out. It is the quality proper to\r\nthe novelist, but no novelist ever employed this quality with such\r\npersistent activity, and at the same time subordinated faction so\r\nconstantly to the idea. With him action has always a mental basis, is\r\nnever suffered to intrude for its own sake. He prefers that an episode\r\nshould seem in itself tedious rather than it should have an illogical\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIt may be, for he is a Frenchman, that his episodes are sometimes too\r\nlogical. There are moments when he becomes unreal because he wishes to\r\nbe too systematic, that is, to be real by measure. He would never have\r\nunderstood the method of Tolstoi, a very stealthy method of surprising\r\nlife. To Tolstoi life is always the cunning enemy whom one must lull\r\nasleep, or noose by an unexpected lasso. He brings in little detail\r\nafter little detail, seeming to insist on the insignificance of each,\r\nin order that it may pass almost unobserved, and be realised only after\r\nit has passed. It is his way of disarming the suspiciousness of life.\r\n\r\nBut Balzac will make no circuit, aims at an open and an unconditional\r\ntriumph over nature. Thus, when he triumphs, he triumphs signally; and\r\naction, in his books, is perpetually crystallising into some phrase,\r\nlike the single lines of Dante, or some brief scene, in which a whole\r\nentanglement comes sharply and suddenly to a luminous point. I will\r\ngive no instance, for I should have to quote from every volume. I\r\nwish rather to remind myself that there are times when the last fine\r\nshade of a situation seems to have escaped. Even then, the failure is\r\noften more apparent than real, a slight bungling in the machinery of\r\nillusion. Look through the phrase, and you will find the truth there,\r\nperfectly explicit on the other side of it.\r\n\r\nFor it cannot be denied, Balzac\'s style, as style, is imperfect. It\r\nhas life, and it has an idea, and it has variety; there are moments\r\nwhen it attains a rare and perfectly individual beauty; as when, in _Le\r\nCousin Pons,_ we read of "cette pr\xc3\xa9disposition aux recherches qui fait\r\nfaire \xc3\xa0 un savant germanique cent lieues dans ses gu\xc3\xaatres pour trouver\r\nune v\xc3\xa9rit\xc3\xa9 qui le regard en riant, assise \xc3\xa0 la marge du puits, sous le\r\njasmin de la cour." But I am far less sure that a student of Balzac\r\nwould recognise him in this sentence than that he would recognise the\r\nwriter of this other: "Des larmes de pudeur, qui roul\xc3\xa8rent entre les\r\nbeaux cils de Madame Hulot, arr\xc3\xaat\xc3\xa8rent net le garde national." It is\r\nin such passages that the failure in style is equivalent to a failure\r\nin psychology. That his style should lack symmetry, subordination, the\r\nformal virtues of form, is, in my eyes, a less serious fault. I have\r\noften considered whether, in the novel, perfect form is a good, or even\r\na possible thing, if the novel is to be what Balzac made it, history\r\nadded to poetry. A novelist with style will not look at life with an\r\nentirely naked vision. He sees through coloured glasses. Human life\r\nand human manners are too various, too moving, to be brought into the\r\nfixity of a quite formal order. There will come a moment, constantly,\r\nwhen style must suffer, or the closeness and clearness of narration\r\nmust be sacrificed, some minute exception of action or psychology must\r\nlose its natural place, or its full emphasis. Balzac, with his rapid\r\nand accumulating mind, without the patience oft selection, and without\r\nthe desire to select where selection means leaving out something\r\ngood in itself, if not good in its place, never hesitates, and his\r\nparenthesis comes in. And often it is into these parentheses that he\r\nputs the profoundest part of his thought.\r\n\r\nYet, ready as Balzac is to neglect the story for the philosophy,\r\nwhenever it seems to him necessary to do so, he would never have\r\nadmitted that a form of the novel is possible in which the story shall\r\nbe no more than an excuse for the philosophy. That was because he was\r\na great creator, and not merely a philosophical thinker; because he\r\ndealt in flesh and blood, and knew that the passions in action can\r\nteach more to the philosopher, and can justify the artist more fully,\r\nthan all the unacting intellect in the world. He knew that though life\r\nwithout thought was no more than the portion of a dog, yet thoughtful\r\nlife was more than lifeless thought, and the dramatist more than\r\nthe commentator. And I cannot help feeling assured that the latest\r\nnovelists without a story, whatever other merits they certainly have,\r\nare lacking in the power to create characters, to express a philosophy\r\nin action; and that the form which they have found, however valuable it\r\nmay be, is the result of this failure, and not either a great refusal\r\nor a new vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe novel as Balzac conceived it has created the modern novel, but no\r\nmodern novelist has followed, for none has been able to follow, Balzac\r\non his own lines. Even those who have tried to follow him most closely\r\nhave, sooner or later, branched off in one direction or another, most\r\nin the direction indicated by Stendhal. Stendhal has written one book\r\nwhich is a masterpiece, unique in its kind, _Le Rouge et le Noir;_ a\r\nsecond, which is full of admirable things, _Le Chartreuse de Parme;_\r\na book of profound criticism, _Racine et Shakspeare;_ and a cold and\r\npenetrating study of the physiology of love, _De l\'Amour,_ by the side\r\nof which Balzac\'s _Physiologie du Mariage_ is a mere _jeu d\'esprit._\r\nHe discovered for himself, and for others after him, a method of\r\nunemotional, minute, slightly ironical analysis, which has fascinated\r\nmodern minds, partly because it has seemed to dispense with those\r\ndifficulties of creation, of creation in the block, which the triumphs\r\nof Balzac have only accentuated. Goriot, Val\xc3\xa9rie Marneffe, Pons,\r\nGrandet, Madame de Mortsauf even, are called up before us after the\r\nsame manner as Othello or Don Quixote; their actions express them so\r\nsignificantly that they seem to be independent of their creator; Balzac\r\nstakes all upon each creation, and leaves us no choice but to accept or\r\nreject each as a whole, precisely as we should a human being. We do not\r\nknow all the secrets of their consciousness, any more than we know all\r\nthe secrets of the consciousness of our friends. But we have only so\r\nsay "Val\xc3\xa9rie!" and the woman is before us. Stendhal, on the contrary,\r\nundresses Julien\'s soul in public with a deliberate and fascinating\r\neffrontery. There is not a vein of which he does not trace the course,\r\nnot a wrinkle to which he does not point, not a nerve which he does\r\nnot touch to the quick. We know everything that passed through his\r\nmind, to result probably in some significant inaction. And at the end\r\nof the book we know as much about that particular intelligence as the\r\nanatomist knows about the body which he has dissected. But mean-while\r\nthe life has gone out of the body; and have we, after all, captured a\r\nliving soul?\r\n\r\nI should be the last to say that Julien Sorel is not a creation, but\r\nhe is not a creation after the order of Balzac; it is a difference\r\nof kind; and if we look carefully at Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric Moreau, and Madame\r\nGervaisais, and the Abb\xc3\xa9 Mouret, we shall see that these also,\r\nprofoundly different as Flaubert and Goncourt and Zola are from\r\nStendhal, are yet more profoundly, more radically, different from the\r\ncreations of Balzac. Balzac takes a primary passion, puts it into a\r\nhuman body, and sets it to work itself out in visible action. But since\r\nStendhal, novelists have persuaded themselves that the primary passions\r\nare a little common, or noisy, or a little heavy to handle, and they\r\nhave concerned themselves with passions tempered by reflection, and the\r\nsensations of elaborate brains. It was Stendhal who substituted the\r\nbrain for the heart, as the battle-place of the novel; not the brain\r\nas Balzac conceived it, a motive-force of action, the mainspring of\r\npassion, the force by which a nature directs its accumulated energy;\r\nbut a sterile sort of brain, set at a great distance from the heart,\r\nwhose rhythm is too faint to disturb it. We have been intellectualising\r\nupon Stendhal ever since, until the persons of the modern novel have\r\ncome to resemble those diaphanous jelly-fish, with balloon-like heads\r\nand the merest tufts of bodies, which float up and down in the Aquarium\r\nat Naples.\r\n\r\nThus, coming closer, as it seems, to what is called reality, in this\r\nbanishment of great emotions, and this attention upon the sensations,\r\nmodern analytic novelists are really getting further and further from\r\nthat life which is the one certain thing in the world. Balzac employs\r\nall his detail to call up a tangible world about his men and women,\r\nnot, perhaps, understanding the full power of detail as psychology, as\r\nFlaubert is to understand it; but, after all, his detail is only the\r\nbackground of the picture; and there, stepping out of the canvas, as\r\nthe sombre people of Velazquez step out of their canvases at the Prado,\r\nis the living figure, looking into your eyes with eyes that respond to\r\nyou like a mirror.\r\n\r\nThe novels of Balzac are full of electric fluid. To take up one of\r\nthem is to feel the shock of life, as one feels it on touching certain\r\nmagnetic hands. To turn over volume after volume is like wandering\r\nthrough the streets of a great city, at that hour of the night when\r\nhuman activity is at its full. There is a particular kind of excitement\r\ninherent in the very aspect of a modern city, of London or Paris; in\r\nthe mere sensation of being in its midst, in the sight of all those\r\nactive and fatigued faces which pass so rapidly; of those long and\r\nendless streets, full of houses, each of which is like the body of a\r\nmultiform soul, looking out through the eyes of many windows. There is\r\nsomething intoxicating in the lights, the movement of shadows under the\r\nlights, the vast and billowy sound of that shadowy movement. And there\r\nis something more than this mere unconscious action upon the nerves.\r\nEvery step in a great city is a step into an unknown world. A new\r\nfuture is possible at every street corner. I never know, when I go out\r\ninto one of those crowded streets, but that the whole course of my life\r\nmay be changed before I return to the house I have quitted.\r\n\r\nI am writing these lines in Madrid, to which I have come suddenly,\r\nafter a long quiet in Andalusia; and I feel already a new pulse in my\r\nblood, a keener consciousness of life, and a sharper human curiosity.\r\nEven in Seville I, knew that I should see to-morrow, in the same\r\nstreets, hardly changed since the Middle Ages, the same people that I\r\nhad seen to-day. But here there are new possibilities, all the exciting\r\naccidents of the modern world, of a population always changing, of\r\na city into which civilisation has brought all its unrest. And as\r\nI walk in these broad, windy streets and see these people, whom I\r\nhardly recognise for Spaniards, so awake and so hybrid are they, I\r\nhave felt the sense of Balzac coming back into my veins. At Cordova he\r\nwas unthinkable; at Cadiz I could realise only his large, universal\r\noutlines, vague as the murmur of the sea; here I feel him, he speaks\r\nthe language I am talking, he sums up the life in whose midst I find\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nFor Balzac is the equivalent of great cities. He is bad reading for\r\nsolitude, for he fills the mind with the nostalgia of cities. When a\r\nman speaks to me familiarly of Balzac I know already something of the\r\nman with whom I have to do. "The physiognomy of women does not begin\r\nbefore the age of thirty," he has said; and perhaps before that age no\r\none can really understand Balzac. Few young people care for him, for\r\nthere is nothing in him that appeals to the senses except through the\r\nintellect. Not many women care for him supremely, for it is part of\r\nhis method to express sentiments through facts, and not facts through\r\nsentiments. But it is natural that he should be the favourite reading\r\nof men of the world, of those men of the world who have the distinction\r\nof their kind; for he supplies the key of the enigma which they are\r\nstudying.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe life of Balzac was one long labour, in which time, money, and\r\ncircumstances were all against him. In 1835 he writes: "I have lately\r\nspent twenty-six days in my study without leaving it. I took the air\r\nonly at that window which dominates Paris, which I mean to dominate."\r\nAnd he exults in the labour: "If there is any glory in that, I alone\r\ncould accomplish such a feat." He symbolises the course of his life\r\nin comparing it to the sea beating against a rock: "To-day one flood,\r\nto-morrow another, bears me along with it. I am dashed against a rock,\r\nI recover myself and go on to another reef." "Sometimes it seems to me\r\nthat my brain is on fire. I shall die in the trenches of the intellect."\r\n\r\nBalzac, like Scott, died under the weight of his debts; and it would\r\nseem, if one took him at his word, that the whole of the _Human Comedy_\r\nwas written for money. In the modern world, as he himself realised more\r\nclearly than any one, money is more often a symbol than an entity, and\r\nit can be the symbol of every desire. For Balzac money was the key\r\nof his earthly paradise. It meant leisure to visit the woman whom he\r\nloved, and at the end it meant the possibility of marrying her.\r\n\r\nThere were only two women in Balzac\'s life: one, a woman much older\r\nthan himself, of whom he wrote, on her death, to the other: "She was\r\na mother, a friend, a family, a companion, a counsel, she made the\r\nwriter, she consoled the young man, she formed his taste, she wept like\r\na sister, she laughed, she came every day, like a healing slumber, to\r\nput sorrow to sleep." The other was Mme. de Hanska, whom he married in\r\n1850, three months before his death. He had loved her for twenty years;\r\nshe was married, and lived in Poland; it was only at rare intervals\r\nthat he was able to see her, and then very briefly; but his letters to\r\nher, published since his death, are a simple, perfectly individual,\r\ndaily record of a great passion. For twenty years he existed on a\r\ndivine certainty without a future, and almost without a present. But we\r\nsee the force of that sentiment passing into his work; _S\xc3\xa9raphita_ is\r\nits ecstasy, everywhere is its human shadow; it refines his strength,\r\nit gives him surprising intuitions, it gives him all that was wanting\r\nto his genius. Mme. de Hanska is the heroine of the _Human Comedy,_ as\r\nBeatrice is the heroine of the _Divine Comedy._\r\n\r\nA great lover, to whom love, as well as every other passion and the\r\nwhole visible world, was an idea, a flaming spiritual perception,\r\nBalzac enjoyed the vast happiness of the idealist. Contentedly,\r\njoyously, he sacrificed every petty enjoyment to the idea of love, the\r\nidea of fame, and to that need of the organism to exercise its forces,\r\nwhich is the only definition of genius. I do not know, among the lives\r\nof men of letters, a life better filled, or more appropriate. A young\r\nman who, for a short time, was his secretary, declared: "I would not\r\nlive your life for the fame of Napoleon and of Byron combined!" The\r\nComte de Gramont did not realise, as the world in general does not\r\nrealise, that, to the man of creative energy, creation is at once a\r\nnecessity and a joy, and to the lover, hope in absence is the elixir\r\nof life. Balzac tasted more than all earthly pleasures as he sat there\r\nin his attic, creating the world over again, that he might lay it at\r\nthe feet of a woman. Certainly to him there was no tedium in life, for\r\nthere was no hour without its vivid employment, and no moment in which\r\nto perceive the most desolate of all certainties, that hope is in the\r\npast. His death was as fortunate as his life; he died at the height of\r\nhis powers, at the height of his fame, at the moment of the fulfilment\r\nof his happiness, and perhaps of the too sudden relief of that delicate\r\nburden.\r\n\r\n1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPER M\xc3\x89RIM\xc3\x89E\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nStendhal has left us a picture of M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e as "a young man in a grey\r\nfrock-coat, very ugly, and with a turned-up nose.... This young man\r\nhad something insolent and extremely unpleasant about him. His eyes,\r\nsmall and without expression, had always the same look, and this look\r\nwas ill-natured.... Such was my first impression of the best of my\r\npresent friends. I am not too sure of his heart, but I am sure of his\r\ntalents. It is M. le Comte Gazul, now so well known; a letter from him,\r\nwhich came to me last week, made me happy for two days. His mother has\r\na good deal of French wit and a superior intelligence. Like her son,\r\nit seems to me that she might give way to emotion once a year." There,\r\npainted by a clear-sighted and disinterested friend, is a picture of\r\nM\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e almost from his own point of view, or at least as he would\r\nhimself have painted the picture. How far is it, in its insistence on\r\nthe _attendrissement une fois par an,_ on the subordination of natural\r\nfeelings to a somewhat disdainful aloofness, the real M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e?\r\n\r\nEarly in life, M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e adopted his theory, fixed his attitude, and to\r\nthe end of his life he seemed, to those about him, to have walked along\r\nthe path he had chosen, almost without a deviation. He went to England\r\nat the age of twenty-three, to Spain four years later, and might seem\r\nto have been drawn naturally to those two countries, to which he was\r\nto return so often, by natural affinities of temper and manner. It\r\nwas the English manner that he liked, that came naturally to him; the\r\ncorrect, unmoved exterior, which is a kind of positive strength, not to\r\nbe broken by any onslaught of events or emotions; and in Spain he found\r\nan equally positive animal acceptance of things as they are, which\r\nsatisfied his profound, restrained, really Pagan senusality, Pagan\r\nin the hard, eighteenth-century sense. From the beginning he was a\r\nstudent, of art, of history, of human nature, and we find him enjoying,\r\nin his deliberate, keen way, the studied diversions of the student;\r\nbody and soul each kept exactly in its place, each provided for without\r\npartiality. He entered upon literature by a mystification, _Le Th\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa2tre\r\nde Clara Gazul,_ a book of plays supposed to be translated from a\r\nliving Spanish dramatist; and he followed it by _La Guzla,_ another\r\nmystification, a book of prose ballads supposed to be translated\r\nfrom the Illyrian. And these mystifications, like the forgeries of\r\nChatterton, contain perhaps the most sincere, the most undisguised\r\nemotion which he ever permitted himself to express; so secure did he\r\nfeel of the heart behind the pearl necklace of the _d\xc3\xa9collet\xc3\xa9e_ Spanish\r\nactress, who travesties his own face in the frontispiece to the one,\r\nand so remote from himself did he feel the bearded gentleman to be, who\r\nsits cross-legged on the ground, holding his lyre or _guzla,_ in the\r\nfrontispiece to the other. Then came a historical novel, the _Chronique\r\ndu R\xc3\xa8gne de Charles IX.,_ before he discovered, as if by accident,\r\nprecisely what it was he was meant to do: the short story. Then he\r\ndrifted into history, became Inspector of Ancient Monuments, and helped\r\nto save V\xc3\xa9zelay, among other good deeds toward art, done in his cold,\r\nsystematic, after all satisfactory manner. He travelled at almost\r\nregular intervals, not only in Spain and England, but in Corsica,\r\nin Greece and Asia Minor, in Italy, in Hungary, in Bohemia, usually\r\nwith a definite, scholarly object, and always with an alert attention\r\nto everything that came in his way, to the manners of people, their\r\nnational characters, their differences from one another. An intimate\r\nfriend of the Countess de Montijo, the mother of the Empress Eug\xc3\xa9nie,\r\nhe was a friend, not a courtier, at the court of the Third Empire.\r\nHe was elected to the Academy, mainly for his _\xc3\x89tudes sur l\'Histoire\r\nRomaine,_ a piece of dry history, and immediately scandalised his\r\nsupporters by publishing a story, _Ars\xc3\xa8ne Guillot,_ which was taken for\r\na veiled attack on religion and on morals. Soon after, his imagination\r\nseemed to flag; he abandoned himself, perhaps a little wearily, more\r\nand more to facts, to the facts of history and learning; learned\r\nRussian, and translated Poushkin and Tourguenieff; and died in 1870,\r\nat Cannes, perhaps less satisfied with himself than most men who have\r\ndone, in their lives, far less exactly what they have intended to do.\r\n\r\n"I have theories about the very smallest things--gloves, boots, and the\r\nlike," says M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e in one of his letters; _des id\xc3\xa9es tr\xc3\xa8s-arr\xc3\xaat\xc3\xa9es,_\r\nas he adds with emphasis in another. Precise opinions lead easily to\r\nprejudices, and M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e, who prided himself on the really very logical\r\nquality of his mind, put himself somewhat deliberately into the hands\r\nof his prejudices. Thus he hated religion, distrusted priests, would\r\nnot let himself be carried away by any instinct of admiration, would\r\nnot let himself do the things which he had the power to do, because\r\nhis other, critical self came mockingly behind him, suggesting that\r\nvery few things were altogether worth doing. "There is nothing that I\r\ndespise and even detest so much as humanity in general," he confesses\r\nin a letter; and it is with a certain self-complacency that he defines\r\nthe only kind of society in which he found himself at home: "(1)\r\nWith unpretentious people whom I have known a long time; (2) in a\r\nSpanish _venta,_ with muleteers and peasant women of Andalusia." One\r\nday, as he finds himself in a pensive mood, dreaming of a woman,\r\nhe translates for her some lines of Sophocles, into verse, "English\r\nverse, you understand, for I abhor French verse." The carefulness with\r\nwhich he avoids received opinions shows a certain consciousness of\r\nthose opinions, which in a more imaginatively independent mind would\r\nscarcely have found a place. It is not only for an effect, but more and\r\nmore genuinely, that he sets his acquirements as a scholar above his\r\naccomplishments as an artist. Clearing away, as it seemed to him, every\r\nillusion from before his eyes, he forgot the last illusion of positive\r\npeople: the possibility that one\'s eyes may be short-sighted.\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e realises a type which we are accustomed to associate almost\r\nexclusively with the eighteenth century, but of which our own time can\r\noffer us many obscure examples. It is the type of the _esprit fort:_\r\nthe learned man, the choice, narrow artist, who is at the same time the\r\ncultivated sensualist. To such a man the pursuit of women is part of\r\nhis constant pursuit of human experience, and of the document, which\r\nis the summing up of human experience. To M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e history itself was\r\na matter of detail. "In history, I care only for anecdotes," he says\r\nin the preface to the _Chronique du R\xc3\xa8gne de Charles IX._ And he adds:\r\n"It is not a very noble taste; but I confess to my shame, I would\r\nwillingly give Thucydides for the authentic memoirs of Aspasia or of\r\na slave of Pericles; for only memoirs, which are the familiar talk\r\nof an author with his reader, afford those portraits of _man_ which\r\namuse and interest me." This curiosity of mankind above all things,\r\nand of mankind at home, or in private actions, not necessarily of any\r\nimport to the general course of the world, leads the curious searcher\r\nnaturally to the more privately interesting and the less publicly\r\nimportant half of mankind. Not scrupulous in arriving at any end by the\r\nmost adaptable means, not disturbed by any illusions as to the physical\r\nfacts of the universe, a sincere and grateful lover of variety,\r\ndoubtless an amusing companion with those who amused him, M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e\r\nfound much of his entertainments and instruction, at all events in his\r\nyounger years, in that "half world" which he tells us he frequented\r\n"very much out of curiosity, living in it always as in a foreign\r\ncountry." Here, as elsewhere, M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e played the part of the amateur.\r\nHe liked anecdotes, not great events, in his history; and he was\r\ncareful to avoid any too serious passions in his search for sensations.\r\nThere, no doubt, for the sensualist, is happiness, if he can resign\r\nhimself to it. It is only serious passions which make anybody\r\nunhappy; and M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e was carefully on the lookout against a possible\r\nunhappiness. I can imagine him ending every day with satisfaction, and\r\nbeginning every fresh day with just enough expectancy to be agreeable,\r\nat that period of his life when he was writing the finest of his\r\nstories, and dividing the rest of his leisure between the drawing-rooms\r\nand the pursuit of uneventful adventures.\r\n\r\nOnly, though we are _automates autant qu\'-esprit,_ as Pascal tells us,\r\nit is useless to expect that what is automatic in us should remain\r\ninvariable and unconditioned. If life could be lived on a plan, and\r\nfor such men on such a plan, if first impulses and profound passions\r\ncould be kept entirely out of one\'s own experience, and studied only\r\nat a safe distance, then, no doubt, one could go on being happy, in\r\na not too heroic way. But, with M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e as with all the rest of the\r\nworld, the scheme breaks down one day, just when a reasonable solution\r\nto things seems to have been arrived at. M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e had already entered\r\non a peaceable enough _liaison_ when the first letter came to him from\r\nthe _Inconnue_ to whom he was to write so many letters, for nine years\r\nwithout seeing her, and then for thirty years more after he had met\r\nher, the last letter being written but two hours before his death.\r\nThese letters, which we can now read in two volumes, have a delicately\r\ninsincere sincerity which makes every letter a work of art, not because\r\nhe tried to make it so, but because he could not help seeing the form\r\nsimultaneously with the feeling, and writing genuine love-letters with\r\nan excellence almost as impersonal as that of his stories. He begins\r\nwith curiosity, which passes with singular rapidity into a kind of\r\nself-willed passion; already in the eighth letter, long before he has\r\nseen her, he is speculating which of the two will know best how to\r\ntorture the other: that is, as he views it, love best. "We shall never\r\nlove one another really," he tells her, as he begins to hope for the\r\ncontrary. Then he discovers, for the first time, and without practical\r\nresult, "that it is better to have illusions than to have none at all."\r\nHe confesses himself to her, sometimes reminding her: "You will never\r\nknow either all the good or all the evil that I have in me. I have\r\nspent my life in being praised for qualities which I do not possess,\r\nand calumniated for defects which are not mine." And, with a strange,\r\nweary humility, which is the other side of his contempt for most things\r\nand people, he admits: "To you I am like an old opera, which you are\r\nobliged to forget, in order to see it again with any pleasure." He, who\r\nhas always distrusted first impulses, finds himself telling her (was\r\nshe really so like him, or was he arguing with himself?): "You always\r\nfear first impulses; do not you see that they are the only ones which\r\nare worth anything and which always succeed?" Does he realise, unable\r\nto change the temperament which he has partly made for himself, that\r\njust there has been his own failure?\r\n\r\nPerhaps of all love-letters, these of M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e show us love triumphing\r\nover the most carefully guarded personality. Here the obstacle is\r\nnot duty, nor circumstance, nor a rival; but (on her side as on his,\r\nit would seem) a carefully trained natural coldness, in which action,\r\nand even for the most part feeling, are relinquished to the control\r\nof second thoughts. A habit of repressive irony goes deep: M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e\r\nmight well have thought himself secure against the outbreak of an\r\nunconditional passion. Yet here we find passion betraying itself,\r\noften only by bitterness, together with a shy, surprising tenderness,\r\nin this curious lovers\' itinerary, marked out with all the customary\r\nsign-posts, and leading, for all its wilful deviations, along the\r\ninevitable road.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly supposed that the artist, by the habit of his\r\nprofession, has made for himself a sort of cuirass of phrases against\r\nthe direct attack of emotion, and so will suffer less than most people\r\nif he should fall into love, and things should not go altogether\r\nwell with him. Rather, he is the more laid open to attack, the more\r\nhelplessly entangled when once the net has been cast over him. He lives\r\nthrough every passionate trouble, not merely with the daily emotions of\r\nthe crowd, but with the whole of his imagination. Pain is multiplied\r\nto him by the force of that faculty by which he conceives delight. What\r\nis most torturing in every not quite fortunate love is memory, and the\r\nartist becomes an artist by his intensification of memory. M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e has\r\nhimself defined art as exaggeration _\xc3\xa0 propos._ Well, to the artist his\r\nown life is an exaggeration not _\xc3\xa0 propos,_ and every hour dramatises\r\nfor him its own pain and pleasure, in a tragic comedy of which he is\r\nthe author and actor and spectator. The practice of art is a sharpening\r\nof the sensations, and, the knife once sharpened, does it cut into\r\none\'s hand less deeply because one is in the act of using it to carve\r\nwood?\r\n\r\nAnd so we find M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e, the most impersonal of artists, and one of\r\nthose most critical of the caprices and violences of fate, giving in to\r\nan almost obvious temptation, an anonymous correspondence, a mysterious\r\nunknown woman, and passing from stage to stage of a finally very\r\ngenuine love-affair, which kept him in a fluttering agitation for more\r\nthan thirty years. It is curious to note that the little which we know\r\nof this _Inconnue_ seems to mark her out as the realisation of a type\r\nwhich had always been M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e\'s type of woman. She has the "wicked\r\neyes" of all his heroines, from the Mariquita of his first attempt in\r\nliterature, who haunts the Inquisitor with "her great black eyes, like\r\nthe eyes of a young cat, soft and wicked at once." He finds her at the\r\nend of his life, in a novel of Tourguenieff, "one of those diabolical\r\ncreatures whose coquetry is the more dangerous because it is capable\r\nof passion." Like so many artists, he has invented his ideal before he\r\nmeets it, and must have seemed almost to have fallen in love with his\r\nown creation. It is one of the privileges of art to create nature, as,\r\naccording to a certain mystical doctrine, you can actualise, by sheer\r\nfixity of contemplation, your mental image of a thing into the thing\r\nitself. The _Inconnue_ was one of a series, the rest imaginary; and\r\nher power over M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e, we can hardly doubt, came not only from her\r\nqueer likeness of temperament to his, but from the singular, flattering\r\npleasure which it must have given him to find that he had invented with\r\nso much truth to nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e as a writer belongs to the race of Laclos and of Stendhal,\r\na race essentially French; and we find him representing, a little\r\ncoldly, as it seemed, the claims of mere unimpassioned intellect, at\r\nwork on passionate problems, among those people of the Romantic period\r\nto whom emotion, evident emotion, was everything. In his subjects he\r\nis as "Romantic" as Victor Hugo or Gautier; he adds, even, a peculiar\r\nflavour of cruelty to the Romantic ingredients. But he distinguishes\r\nsharply, as French writers before him had so well known how to do,\r\nbetween the passion one is recounting and the moved or unmoved way\r\nin which one chooses to tell it. To M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e art was a very formal\r\nthing, almost a part of learning; it was a thing to be done with a\r\nclear head, reflectively, with a calm mastery of even the most vivid\r\nmaterial. While others, at that time, were intoxicating themselves\r\nwith strange sensations, hoping that "nature would take the pen out\r\nof their hands and write," just at the moment when their own thoughts\r\nbecame least coherent, M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e went quietly to work over something a\r\nlittle abnormal which he had found in nature, with as disinterested, as\r\nscholarly, as mentally reserved an interest as if it were one of those\r\nGothic monuments which he inspected to such good purpose, and, as it\r\nhas seemed to his biographer, with so little sympathy. His own emotion,\r\nso far as it is roused, seems to him an extraneous thing, a thing to be\r\nconcealed, if not a little ashamed of. It is the thing itself he wishes\r\nto give you, not his feelings about it; and his theory is that if the\r\nthing itself can only be made to stand and speak before the reader, the\r\nreader will supply for himself all the feeling that is needed, all the\r\nfeeling that would be called out in nature by a perfectly clear sight\r\nof just such passions in action. It seems to him bad art to paint the\r\npicture, and to write a description of the picture as well.\r\n\r\nAnd his method serves him wonderfully up to a certain point, and then\r\nleaves him, without his being well aware of it, at the moment even when\r\nhe has convinced himself that he has realised the utmost of his aim. At\r\na time when he had come to consider scholarly dexterity as the most\r\nimportant part of art, M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e tells us that _La V\xc3\xa9nus d\'Ille_ seemed\r\nto him the best story he had ever written. He has often been taken at\r\nhis word, but to take him at his word is to do him an injustice. _La\r\nV\xc3\xa9nus d\'Ille_ is a modern setting of the old story of the Ring given to\r\nVenus, and M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e has been praised for the ingenuity with which he has\r\nobtained an effect of supernatural terror, while leaving the way open\r\nfor a material explanation of the supernatural. What he has really done\r\nis to materialise a myth, by accepting in it precisely what might be a\r\nmere superstition, the form of the thing, and leaving out the spiritual\r\nmeaning of which that form was no more than a temporary expression. The\r\nring which the bridegroom sets on the finger of Venus, and which the\r\nstatue\'s finger closes upon, accepting it, symbolises the pact between\r\nlove and sensuality, the lover\'s abdication of all but the physical\r\npart of love; and the statue taking its place between husband and wife\r\non the marriage-night, and crushing life out of him in an inexorable\r\nembrace, symbolises the merely natural destruction which that granted\r\nprayer brings with it, as a merely human Messalina takes her lover on\r\nhis own terms, in his abandonment of all to Venus. M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e sees a cruel\r\nand fantastic superstition, which he is afraid of seeming to take too\r\nseriously, which he prefers to leave as a story of ghosts or bogies,\r\na thing at which we are to shiver as at a mere twitch on the nerves,\r\nwhile our mental confidence in the impossibility of what we cannot\r\nexplain is preserved for us by a hint at a muleteer\'s vengeance. "Have\r\nI frightened you?" says the man of the world, with a reassuring smile.\r\n"Think about it no more; I really meant nothing."\r\n\r\nAnd yet, does he after all mean nothing? The devil, the old pagan\r\ngods, the spirits of evil incarnated under every form, fascinated him;\r\nit gave him a malign pleasure to set them at their evil work among\r\nmen, while, all the time, he mocks them and the men who believed in\r\nthem. He is a materialist, and yet he believes in at least a something\r\nevil, outside the world, or in the heart of it, which sets humanity\r\nat its strange games, relentlessly. Even then he will not surrender\r\nhis doubts, his ironies, his negations. Is he, perhaps, at times,\r\nthe atheist who fears that, after all, God may exist, or at least who\r\nrealises how much he would fear him if he did exist?\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e had always delighted in mystifications; he was always on his\r\nguard against being mystified himself, either by nature or by his\r\nfellow-creatures. In the early "Romantic" days he had had a genuine\r\npassion for various things: "local colour," for instance. But even then\r\nhe had invented it by a kind of trick, and, later on, he explains what\r\na poor thing "local colour" is, since it can so easily be invented\r\nwithout leaving one\'s study. He is full of curiosity, and will go far\r\nto satisfy it, regretting "the decadence," in our times, "of energetic\r\npassions, in favour of tranquillity and perhaps of happiness." These\r\nenergetic passions he will find, indeed, in our own times, in Corsica,\r\nin Spain, in Lithuania, really in the midst of a very genuine and\r\nprofoundly studied "local colour," and also, under many disguises, in\r\nParisian drawing-rooms. M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e prized happiness, material comfort, the\r\nsatisfaction of one\'s immediate desires, very highly, and it was his\r\nkeen sense of life, of the pleasures of living, that gave him some\r\nof his keenness in the realisation of violent death, physical pain,\r\nwhatever disturbs the equilibrium of things with unusual emphasis.\r\nHimself really selfish, he can distinguish the unhappiness of others\r\nwith a kind of intuition which is not sympathy, but which selfish\r\npeople often have: a dramatic consciousness of how painful pain must\r\nbe, whoever feels it. It is not pity, though it communicates itself to\r\nus, often enough, as pity. It is the clear-sighted sensitiveness of a\r\nman who watches human things closely, bringing them home to himself\r\nwith the deliberate, essaying art of an actor who has to represent a\r\nparticular passion in movement.\r\n\r\nAnd always in M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e there is this union of curiosity with\r\nindifference: the curiosity of the student, the indifference of the\r\nman of the world. Indifference, in him, as in the man of the world,\r\nis partly an attitude, adopted for its form, and influencing the\r\ntemperament just so much as gesture always influences emotion. The\r\nman who forces himself to appear calm under excitement teaches his\r\nnerves to follow instinctively the way he has shown them. In time\r\nhe will not merely seem calm but will be calm, at the moment when he\r\nlearns that a great disaster has befallen him. But, in M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e, was\r\nthe indifference even as external as it must always be when there is\r\nrestraint, when, therefore, there is something to restrain? Was there\r\nnot in him a certain drying up of the sources of emotion, as the man of\r\nthe world came to accept almost the point of view of society, reading\r\nhis stories to a little circle of court ladies, when, once in a while,\r\nhe permitted himself to write a story? And was not this increase of\r\nwell-bred indifference, now more than ever characteristic, almost the\r\nman himself, the chief reason why he abandoned art so early, writing\r\nonly two or three short stories during the last twenty-five years of\r\nhis life, and writing these with a labour which by no means conceals\r\nitself?\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e had an abstract interest in, almost an enthusiasm for,\r\nfacts; facts for their meaning, the light they throw on psychology.\r\nHe declines to consider psychology except through its expression in\r\nfacts, with an impersonality far more real than that of Flaubert. The\r\ndocument, historical or social, must translate itself into sharp action\r\nbefore he can use it; not that he does not see, and appreciate better\r\nthan most others, all there is of significance in the document itself;\r\nbut his theory of art is inexorable. He never allowed himself to write\r\nas he pleased, but he wrote always as he considered the artist should\r\nwrite. Thus he made for himself a kind of formula, confining himself,\r\nas some thought, within too narrow limits, but, to himself, doing\r\nexactly what he set himself to do, with all the satisfaction of one who\r\nis convinced of the justice of his aim and confident of his power to\r\nattain it.\r\n\r\nLook, for instance, at his longest, far from his best work, _La\r\nChronique du R\xc3\xa8gne de Charles IX._ Like so much of his work, it has\r\nsomething of the air of a _tour de force,_ not taken up entirely for\r\nits own sake. M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e drops into a fashion, half deprecatingly, as if\r\nhe sees through it, and yet, as with merely mundane elegance, with\r\na resolve to be more scrupuously exact than its devotees. "Belief,"\r\nsays some one in this book, as if speaking for M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e, "is a precious\r\ngift which has been denied me." Well, he will do better, without\r\nbelief, than those who believe. Written under a title which suggests\r\na work of actual history, it is more than possible that the first\r\nsuggestion of this book really came, as he tells us in the preface,\r\nfrom the reading of "a large number of memoirs and pamphlets relating\r\nto the end of the sixteenth century." "I wished to make an epitome of\r\nmy reading," he tells us, "and here is the epitome." The historical\r\nproblem attracted him, that never quite explicable Massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew, in which there was precisely the violence of action and\r\nuncertainty of motive which he liked to set before him at the beginning\r\nof a task in literature. Probable, clearly defined people, in the dress\r\nof the period, grew up naturally about this central motive; humour\r\nand irony have their part; there are adventures, told with a sword\'s\r\npoint of sharpness, and in the fewest possible words; there is one of\r\nhis cruel and loving women, in whom every sentiment becomes action, by\r\nsome twisted feminine logic of their own. It is the most artistic, the\r\nmost clean-cut, of historical novels; and yet this perfect neatness of\r\nmethod suggests a certain indifference on the part of the writer, as\r\nif he were more interested in doing the thing well than in doing it.\r\n\r\nAnd that, in all but the very best of his stories (even, perhaps,\r\nin _Ars\xc3\xa8ne Guillot_ only not in such perfect things as _Carmen,_ as\r\n_Mateo Falcone),_ is what M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e just lets us see, underneath an\r\nalmost faultless skill of narrative. An incident told by M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e at\r\nhis best gathers about it something of the gravity of history, the\r\ncomposed way in which it is told helping to give it the equivalent of\r\nremoteness, allowing it not merely to be, but, what is more difficult,\r\nto seem classic in its own time. "Magnificent things, things after my\r\nown heart--that is to say, Greek in their truth and simplicity," he\r\nwrites in a letter, referring to the tales of Poushkin. The phrase is\r\nscarcely too strong to apply to what is best in his own work. Made\r\nout of elemental passions, hard, cruel, detached as it were from\r\ntheir own sentiments, the stories that he tells might in other hands\r\nbecome melodramas: _Carmen,_ taken thoughtlessly out of his hands, has\r\nsupplied the libretto to the most popular of modern light operas. And\r\nyet, in his severe method of telling, mere outlines, it seems, told\r\nwith an even stricter watch over what is significantly left out than\r\nover what is briefly allowed to be said in words, these stories sum up\r\nlittle separate pieces of the world, each a little world in itself.\r\nAnd each is a little world which he has made his own, with a labor at\r\nlast its own reward, and taking life partly because he has put into\r\nit more of himself than the mere intention of doing it well. M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e\r\nloved Spain, and _Carmen,_ which, by some caprice of popularity, is\r\nthe symbol of Spain to people in general, is really, to those who\r\nknow Spain well, the most Spanish thing that has been written since\r\n_Gil Blas._ All the little parade of local colour and philology, the\r\nappendix on the _Calo_ of the gipsies, done to heighten the illusion,\r\nhas more significance than people sometimes think. In this story\r\nall the qualities of M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e come into agreement; the student of\r\nhuman passions, the traveller, the observer, the learned man, meet\r\nin harmony; and, in addition, there is the _aficionado,_ the true\r\n_amateur,_ in love with Spain and the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that at the reception of M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e at the Acad\xc3\xa9mie\r\nFran\xc3\xa7aise in 1845, M. Etienne thought it already needful to say:\r\n"Do not pause in the midst of your career; rest is not permitted to\r\nyour talent." Already M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e was giving way to facts, to facts in\r\nthemselves, as they come into history, into records of scholarship.\r\nWe find him writing, a little dryly, on Catiline, on C\xc3\xa6sar, on Don\r\nPedro the Cruel, learning Russian, and translating from it (yet, while\r\nstudying the Russians before all the world, never discovering the\r\nmystical Russian soul), writing learned articles, writing reports. He\r\nlooked around on contemporary literature, and found nothing that he\r\ncould care for. Stendhal was gone, and who else was there to admire?\r\nFlaubert, it seemed to him, was "wasting his talent under the pretence\r\nof realism." Victor Hugo was "a fellow with the most beautiful figures\r\nof speech at his disposal," who did not take the trouble to think, but\r\nintoxicated himself with his own words. Baudelaire made him furious,\r\nRenan filled him with pitying scorn. In the midst of his contempt, he\r\nmay perhaps have imagined that he was being left behind. For whatever\r\nreason, weakness or strength, he could not persuade himself that it\r\nwas worth while to strive for anything any more. He died probably at\r\nthe moment when he was no longer a fashion, and had not yet become a\r\nclassic.\r\n\r\n1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nG\xc3\x89RARD DE NERVAL\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThis is the problem of one who lost the whole world and gained his own\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n"I like to arrange my life as if it were a novel," wrote G\xc3\xa9rard de\r\nNerval, and, indeed, it is somewhat difficult to disentangle the\r\nprecise facts of an existence which was never quite conscious where\r\nbegan and where ended that "overflowing of dreams into real life," of\r\nwhich he speaks. "I do not ask of God," he said, "that he should change\r\nanything in events themselves, but that he should change me in regard\r\nto things, so that I might have the power to create my own universe\r\nabout me, to govern my dreams, instead of enduring them." The prayer\r\nwas not granted, in its entirety; and the tragedy of his life lay in\r\nthe vain endeavour to hold back the irresistible empire of the unseen,\r\nwhich it was the joy of his life to summon about him. Briefly, we\r\nknow that G\xc3\xa9rard Labrunie (the name de Nerval was taken from a little\r\npiece of property, worth some 1500 francs, which he liked to imagine\r\nhad always been in the possession of his family) was born at Paris,\r\nMay 22, 1808. His father was surgeon-major; his mother died before he\r\nwas old enough to remember her, following the _Grande Arm\xc3\xa9e_ on the\r\nRussian campaign; and G\xc3\xa9rard was brought up, largely under the care of\r\na studious and erratic uncle, in a little village called Montagny, near\r\nErmenonville. He was a precocious schoolboy, and by the age of eighteen\r\nhad published six little collections of verses. It was during one of\r\nhis holidays that he saw, for the first and last time, the young girl\r\nwhom he calls Adrienne, and whom, under many names, he loved to the\r\nend of his life. One evening she had come from the ch\xc3\xa2teau to dance\r\nwith the young peasant girls on the grass. She had danced with G\xc3\xa9rard,\r\nhe had kissed her cheek, he had crowned her hair with laurels, he had\r\nheard her sing an old song telling of the sorrows of a princess whom\r\nher father had shut in a tower because she had loved. To G\xc3\xa9rard it\r\nseemed that already he remembered her, and certainly he was never to\r\nforget her. After-wards, he heard that Adrienne had taken the veil;\r\nthen, that she was dead. To one who had realised that it is "we, the\r\nliving, who walk in a world of phantoms," death could not exclude hope;\r\nand when, many years later, he fell seriously and fantastically in love\r\nwith a little actress called Jenny Colon, it was because he seemed to\r\nhave found, in that blonde and very human person, the re-incarnation of\r\nthe blonde Adrienne.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile G\xc3\xa9rard was living in Paris, among his friends the Romantics,\r\nwriting and living in an equally desultory fashion. _Le bon G\xc3\xa9rard_\r\nwas the best loved, and, in his time, not the least famous, of the\r\ncompany. He led, by choice, now in Paris, now across Europe, the life\r\nof a vagabond, and more persistently than others of his friends who\r\nwere driven to it by need. At that time, when it was the aim of every\r\none to be as eccentric as possible, the eccentricities of G\xc3\xa9rard\'s life\r\nand thought seemed, on the whole, less noticeable than those of many\r\nreally quite normal persons. But with G\xc3\xa9rard there was no pose; and\r\nwhen, one day, he was found in the Palais-Royal, leading a lobster\r\nat the end of a blue ribbon (because, he said, it does not bark, and\r\nknows the secrets of the sea), the visionary had simply lost control of\r\nhis visions, and had to be sent to Dr. Blanche\'s asylum at Montmartre.\r\nHe entered March 21, 1841, and came out, apparently well again, on\r\nthe 21st of November. It would seem that this first access of madness\r\nwas, to some extent, the consequence of the final rupture with Jenny\r\nColon; on June 5, 1842, she died and it was partly in order to put as\r\nmany leagues of the earth as possible between him and that memory that\r\nG\xc3\xa9rard set out, at the end of 1842, for the East. It was also in order\r\nto prove to the world, by his consciousness of external things, that\r\nhe had recovered his reason. While he was in Syria, he once more fell\r\nin love with a new incarnation of Adrienne, a young Druse, Sal\xc3\xa9ma, the\r\ndaughter of a Sheikh of Lebanon; and it seems to have been almost by\r\naccident that he did not marry her. He returned to Paris at the end\r\nof 1843 or the beginning of 1844, and for the next few years he lived\r\nmostly in Paris, writing charming, graceful, remarkably sane articles\r\nand books and wandering about the streets, by day and night, in a\r\nperpetual dream from which, now and again, he was somewhat rudely\r\nawakened. When, in the spring of 1853, he went to see Heine, for whom\r\nhe was doing an admirable prose translation of his poems, and told him\r\nhe had come to return the money he had received in advance, because\r\nthe times were accomplished, and the end of the world, announced by\r\nthe Apocalypse, was at hand, Heine sent for a cab, and G\xc3\xa9rard found\r\nhimself at Dr. Dubois\' asylum, where he remained two months. It was on\r\ncoming out of the asylum that he wrote _Sylvie,_ a delightful idyl,\r\nchiefly autobiographical, one of his three actual achievements. On\r\nAugust 27, 1853, he had to be taken to Dr. Blanche\'s asylum at Passy,\r\nwhere he remained till May 27, 1854. Thither, after a month or two\r\nspent in Germany, he returned on August 8, and on October 19 he came\r\nout for the last time, manifestly uncured. He was now engaged on the\r\nnarrative of his own madness, and the first part of _Le R\xc3\xaave et la Vie_\r\nappeared in the _Revue de Paris_ of January I, 1855. On the 20th he\r\ncame into the office of the review, and showed Gautier and Maxime du\r\nCamp an apron-string which he was carrying in his pocket. "It is the\r\ngirdle," he said, "that Madame de Maintenon wore when she had _Esther_\r\nperformed at Saint-Cyr." On the 24th he wrote to a friend: "Come and\r\nprove my identity at the police-station of the Ch\xc3\xa2telet." The night\r\nbefore he had been working at his manuscript in a pot-house of Les\r\nHalles, and had been arrested as a vagabond. He was used to such little\r\nmisadventures, but he complained of the difficulty of writing. "I set\r\noff after an idea," he said, "and lose myself; I am hours in finding\r\nmy way back. Do you know I can scarcely write twenty lines a day, the\r\ndarkness comes about me so close!" He took out the apron-string. "It\r\nis the garter of the Queen of Sheba," he said. The snow was freezing\r\non the ground, and on the night of the 25th, at three in the morning,\r\nthe landlord of a "penny doss" in the Rue de la Vieille-Lanterne, a\r\nfilthy alley lying between the quays and the Rue de Rivoli, heard\r\nsome one knocking at the door, but did not open, on account of the\r\ncold. At dawn, the body of G\xc3\xa9rard de Nerval was found hanging by the\r\napron-string to a bar of the window.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to exaggerate the importance of the half-dozen\r\nvolumes which make up the works of G\xc3\xa9rard de Nerval. He was not a\r\ngreat writer; he had moments of greatness; and it is the particular\r\nquality of these moments which is of interest for us. There is the\r\nentertaining, but not more than entertaining, _Voyage en Orient;_ there\r\nis the estimable translation of _Faust,_ and the admirable versions\r\nfrom Heine; there are the volumes of short stories and sketches, of\r\nwhich even _Les Illumin\xc3\xa9s,_ in spite of the promise of its title, is\r\nlittle more than an agreeable compilation. But there remain three\r\ncompositions: the sonnets, _Le R\xc3\xaave et la Vie,_ and _Sylvie;_ of which\r\n_Sylvie_ is the most objectively achieved, a wandering idyl, full of\r\npastoral delight, and containing some folk-songs of Valois, two of\r\nwhich have been translated by Rossetti; _Le R\xc3\xaave et la Vie_ being the\r\nmost intensely personal, a narrative of madness, unique as madness\r\nitself; and the sonnets, a kind of miracle, which may be held to have\r\ncreated something at least of the method of the later Symbolist. These\r\nthree compositions, in which alone G\xc3\xa9rard is his finest self, all\r\nbelong to the periods when he was, in the eyes of the world, actually\r\nmad. The sonnets belong to two of these periods, _Le R\xc3\xaave et la Vie_ to\r\nthe last; _Sylvie_ was written in the short interval between the two\r\nattacks in the early part of 1853. We have thus the case of a writer,\r\ngraceful and elegant when he is sane, but only inspired, only really\r\nwise, passionate, collected, only really master of himself, when he\r\nis insane. It may be worth looking at a few of the points which so\r\nsuggestive a problem presents to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nG\xc3\xa9rard de Nerval lived the transfigured inner life of the dreamer. "I\r\nwas very tired of life!" he says. And like so many dreamers, who have\r\nall the luminous darkness of the universe in their brains, he found\r\nhis most precious and uninterrupted solitude in the crowded and more\r\nsordid streets of great cities. He who had loved the Queen of Sheba,\r\nand seen the seven Elohims dividing the world, could find nothing more\r\ntolerable in mortal conditions, when he was truly aware of them, than\r\nthe company of the meanest of mankind, in whom poverty and vice, and\r\nthe hard pressure of civilisation, still leave some of the original\r\nvivacity of the human comedy. The real world seeming to be always so\r\nfar from him, and a sort of terror of the gulfs holding him, in spite\r\nof himself, to its flying skirts, he found something at all events\r\nrealisable, concrete, in these drinkers of Les Halles, these vagabonds\r\nof the Place du Carrousel, among whom he so often sought refuge. It was\r\nliterally, in part, a refuge. During the day he could sleep, but night\r\nwakened him, and that restlessness, which the night draws out in those\r\nwho are really under lunar influences, set his feet wandering, if only\r\nin order that his mind might wander the less. The sun, as he mentions,\r\nnever appears in dreams; but, with the approach of night, is not every\r\none a little readier to believe in the mystery lurking behind the world?\r\n\r\n    Crains, dans le mur aveugle, un regard qui t\'\xc3\xa9pie!\r\n\r\nhe writes in one of his great sonnets; and that fear of the invisible\r\nwatchfulness of nature was never absent from him. It is one of the\r\nterrors of human existence that we may be led at once to seek and so\r\nshun solitude; unable to bear the mortal pressure if its embrace,\r\nunable to endure the nostalgia of its absence. "I think man\'s happiest\r\nwhen he forgets himself," says an Elizabethan dramatist; and, with\r\nG\xc3\xa9rard, there was Adrienne to forget, and Jenny Colon the actress,\r\nand the Queen of Sheba. But to have drunk of the cup of dreams is to\r\nhave drunk of the cup of eternal memory. The past, and, as it seemed\r\nto him, the future were continually with him; only the present fled\r\ncontinually from under his feet. It was only by the effort of this\r\ncontact with people who lived so sincerely in the day, the minute,\r\nthat he could find even a temporary foothold. With them, at least, he\r\ncould hold back all the stars, and the darkness beyond them, and the\r\ninterminable approach and disappearance of all the ages, if only for\r\nthe space between tavern and tavern, where he could open his eyes on so\r\nfrank an abandonment to the common drunkenness of most people in this\r\nworld, here for once really living the symbolic intoxication of their\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nLike so many dreamers of illimitable dreams, it was the fate of\r\nG\xc3\xa9rard to incarnate his ideal in the person of an actress. The fatal\r\ntransfiguration of the footlights, in which reality and the artificial\r\nchange places with so fantastic a regularity, has drawn many moths into\r\nits flame, and will draw more, as long as men persist in demanding\r\nillusion of what is real, and reality in what is illusion. The Jenny\r\nColons of the world are very simple, very real, if one will but refrain\r\nfrom assuming them to be a mystery. But it is the penalty of all\r\nimaginative lovers to create for themselves the veil which hides from\r\nthem the features of the beloved. It is their privilege, for it is\r\nincomparably more entrancing to fancy oneself in love with Isis than\r\nto know that one is in love with Manon Lescaut. The picture of G\xc3\xa9rard,\r\nafter many hesitations, revealing to the astonished Jenny that she is\r\nthe incarnation of another, the shadow of a dream, that she has been\r\nAdrienne and is about to be the Queen of Sheba; her very human little\r\ncry of pure incomprehension, _Mais vous ne m\'aimez pas!_ and her\r\nprompt refuge in the arms of the _jeune premier rid\xc3\xa9,_ if it were not\r\nof the acutest pathos, would certainly be of the most quintessential\r\ncomedy. For G\xc3\xa9rard, so sharp an awakening was but like the passage from\r\none state to another, across that little bridge of one step which lies\r\nbetween heaven and hell, to which he was so used in his dreams. It gave\r\npermanency to the trivial, crystallising it, in another than Stendhal\'s\r\nsense; and when death came, changing mere human memory into the terms\r\nof eternity, the darkness of the spiritual world was lit with a new\r\nstar, which was henceforth the wandering, desolate guide of so many\r\nvisions. The tragic figure of Aur\xc3\xa9lia, which comes and goes through\r\nall the labyrinths of dream, is now seen always "as if lit up by a\r\nlightning-flash, pale and dying, hurried away by dark horsemen."\r\n\r\nThe dream or doctrine of the re-incarnation of souls, which has given\r\nso much consolation to so many questioners of eternity, was for\r\nG\xc3\xa9rard (need we doubt?) a dream rather than a doctrine, but one of\r\nthose dreams which are nearer to a man than his breath. "This vague\r\nand hopeless love," he writes in _Sylvie,_ "inspired by an actress,\r\nwhich night by night took hold of me at the hour of the performance,\r\nleaving me only at the hour of sleep, had its germ in the recollection\r\nof Adrienne, flower of the night, unfolding under the pale rays of\r\nthe moon, rosy and blonde phantom, gliding over the green grass, half\r\nbathed in white mist.... To love a nun under the form of an actress!\r\n... and if it were the very same! It is enough to drive one mad!" Yes,\r\n_il y a de quoi devenir fou,_ as G\xc3\xa9rard had found; but there was also,\r\nin this intimate sense of the unity, perpetuity, and harmoniously\r\nrecurring rhythm of nature, not a little of the inner substance\r\nof wisdom. It was a dream, perhaps refracted from some broken,\r\nilluminating angle by which madness catches unseen light, that revealed\r\nto him the meaning of his own superstition, fatality, malady: "During\r\nmy sleep, I had a marvelous vision. It seemed to me that the goddess\r\nappeared before me, saying to me: \'I am the same as Mary, the same as\r\nthy mother, the same also whom, under all forms, thou hast always\r\nloved. At each of thine ordeals I have dropt yet one more of the masks\r\nwith which I veil my countenance, and soon thou shalt see me as I am!\'"\r\nAnd in perhaps his finest sonnet, the mysterious _Art\xc3\xa9mis,_ we have,\r\nunder other symbols, and with the deliberate inconsequence of these\r\nsonnets, the comfort and despair of the same faith.\r\n\r\n    La Treizi\xc3\xa8me revient... C\'est encor la premi\xc3\xa8re;\r\n    Et c\'est toujours la seule,--ou c\'est le seul moment:\r\n    Car es-tu reine, \xc3\xb4 toi! la premi\xc3\xa8re ou derni\xc3\xa8re?\r\n    Es-tu roi, toi le seul ou le dernier amant?...\r\n\r\n    Aimez qui vous aima du berceau dans la bi\xc3\xa8re;\r\n    Celle que j\'aimai seul m\'aime encor tendrement;\r\n    C\'est la mort--ou la morte ... \xc3\x94 d\xc3\xa9lice! \xc3\xb4 tourment!\r\n    La Rose qu\'elle tient, c\'est la Rose tr\xc3\xa9mi\xc3\xa8re.\r\n\r\n    Sainte napolitaine aux mains pleines de feux,\r\n    Rose au c\xc5\x93ur violet, fleur de sainte Gudule;\r\n    As-tu trouv\xc3\xa9 ta croix dans le d\xc3\xa9sert cieux?\r\n\r\n    Roses blanches, tombez! vous insultez nos dieux:\r\n    Tombez, fant\xc3\xb4mes blancs, de votre ciel qui br\xc3\xbble:\r\n    --La Sainte de l\'ab\xc3\xaeme est plus sainte \xc3\xa0 mes yeux!\r\n\r\nWho has not often meditated, above all what artist, on the slightness,\r\nafter all, of the link which holds our faculties together in that sober\r\nhealth of the brain which we call reason? Are there not moments when\r\nthat link seems to be worn down to so fine a tenuity that the wing of\r\na passing dream might suffice to snap it? The consciousness seems,\r\nas it were, to expand and contract at once, into something too wide\r\nfor the universe, and too narrow for the thought of self to find room\r\nwithin it. Is it that the sense of identity is about to evaporate,\r\nannihilating all, or is it that a more profound identity, the identity\r\nof the whole sentient universe, has been at last realised? Leaving the\r\nconcrete world on these brief voyages, the fear is that we may not have\r\nstrength to return, or that we may lose the way back. Every artist\r\nlives a double life, in which he is for the most part conscious of the\r\nillusions of the imagination. He is conscious also of the illusions of\r\nthe nerves, which he shares with every man of imaginative mind. Nights\r\nof insomnia, days of anxious waiting, the sudden shock of an event, and\r\none of these common disturbances may be enough to jangle the tuneless\r\nbells of one\'s nerves. The artist can distinguish these causes of\r\ncertain of his moods from those other causes which come to him because\r\nhe is an artist, and are properly concerned with that invention which\r\nis his own function. Yet is there not some danger that he may come\r\nto confuse one with the other, that he may "lose the thread" which\r\nconducts him through the intricacies of the inner world?\r\n\r\nThe supreme artist, certainly, is the furthest of all men from this\r\ndanger; for he is the supreme intelligence. Like Dante, he can pass\r\nthrough hell unsinged. With him, imagination is vision; when he looks\r\ninto the darkness, he sees. The vague dreamer, the insecure artist and\r\nthe uncertain mystic at once, sees only shadows, not recognising their\r\noutlines. He is mastered by the images which have come at his call; he\r\nhas not the power which chains them for his slaves. "The kingdom of\r\nHeaven suffers violence," and the dreamer who has gone tremblingly into\r\nthe darkness is in peril at the hands of those very real phantoms who\r\nare the reflection of his fear.\r\n\r\nThe madness of G\xc3\xa9rard de Nerval, whatever physiological reasons may\r\nbe rightly given for its outbreak, subsidence, and return, I take to\r\nhave been essentially due to the weakness and not the excess of his\r\nvisionary quality, to the insufficiency of his imaginative energy, and\r\nto his lack of spiritual discipline. He was an unsystematic mystic;\r\nhis "Tower of Babel in two hundred volumes," that medley of books of\r\nreligion, science, astrology, history, travel, which he thought would\r\nhave rejoiced the heart of Pico della Mirandola, of Meursius, or of\r\nNicholas of Cusa, was truly, as he says, "enough to drive a wise man\r\nmad." "Why not also," he adds, "enough to make a madman wise?" But\r\nprecisely because it was this _amas bizarre,_ this jumble of the\r\nperilous secrets in which wisdom is so often folly, and folly so often\r\nwisdom. He speaks vaguely of the Cabbala; the Cabbala would have been\r\nsafety to him, as the Catholic Church would have been, or any other\r\nreasoned scheme of things. Wavering among intuitions, ignorances,\r\nhalf-truths, shadows of falsehood, now audacious, now hesitating,\r\nhe was blown hither and thither by conflicting winds, a prey to the\r\nindefinite.\r\n\r\n_Le R\xc3\xaave et la Vie,_ the last fragments of which were found in his\r\npockets after his suicide, scrawled on scraps of paper, interrupted\r\nwith Cabbalistic signs and "a demonstration of the Immaculate\r\nConception by geometry," is a narrative of a madman\'s visions by the\r\nmadman himself, yet showing, as Gautier says, "cold reason seated\r\nby the bedside of hot fever, hallucination analysing itself by a\r\nsupreme philosophic effort." What is curious, yet after all natural,\r\nis that part of the narrative seems to be contemporaneous with what\r\nit describes, and part subsequent to it; so that it is not as when De\r\nQuincey says to us, such or such was the opium-dream that I had on such\r\na night; but as if the opium-dreamer had begun to write down his dream\r\nwhile he was yet within its coils. "The descent into hell," he calls it\r\ntwice; yet does he not also write: "At times I imagined that my force\r\nand my activity were doubled; it seemed to me that I knew everything,\r\nunderstood everything; and imagination brought me infinite pleasures.\r\nNow that I have recovered what men call reason, must I not regret\r\nhaving lost them?" But he had not lost them; he was still in that state\r\nof double consciousness which he describes in one of his visions,\r\nwhen, seeing people dressed in white, "I was astonished," he says, "to\r\nsee them all dressed in white; yet it seemed to me that this was an\r\noptical illusion." His cosmical visions are at times so magnificent\r\nthat he seems to be creating myths; and it is with a worthy ingenuity\r\nthat he plays the part he imagines to be assigned to him in his astral\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\n"First of all I imagined that the persons collected in the garden (of\r\nthe madhouse) all had some influence on the stars, and that the one who\r\nalways walked round and round in a circle regulated the course of the\r\nsun. An old man, who was brought there at certain hours of the day, and\r\nwho made knots as he consulted his watch, seemed to me to be charged\r\nwith the notation of the course of the hours. I attributed to myself an\r\ninfluence over the course of the moon, and I believed that this star\r\nhad been struck by the thunderbolt of the Most High, which had traced\r\non its face the imprint of the mask which I had observed.\r\n\r\n"I attributed a mystical signification to the conversations of the\r\nwarders and of my companions. It seemed to me that they were the\r\nrepresentatives of all the races of the earth, and that we had\r\nundertaken between us to re-arrange the course of the stars, and to\r\ngive a wider development to the system. An error, in my opinion, had\r\ncrept into the general combination of numbers, and thence came all the\r\nills of humanity. I believed also that the celestial spirits had taken\r\nhuman forms, and assisted at this general congress, seeming though they\r\ndid to be concerned with but ordinary occupations. My own part seemed\r\nto me to be the re-establishment of universal harmony by Cabbalistic\r\nart, and I had to seek a solution by evoking the occult forces of\r\nvarious religions."\r\n\r\nSo far we have, no doubt, the confusions of madness, in which what may\r\nindeed be the symbol is taken for the thing itself. But now observe\r\nwhat follows:\r\n\r\n"I seemed to myself a hero living under the very eyes of the gods;\r\neverything in nature assumed new aspects, and secret voices came to me\r\nfrom the plants, the trees, animals, the meanest insects, to warn and\r\nto encourage me. The words of my companions had mysterious messages,\r\nthe sense of which I alone understood; things without form and without\r\nlife lent themselves to the designs of my mind; out of combinations\r\nof stones, the figures of angles, crevices, or openings, the shape of\r\nleaves, out of colours, odours, and sounds, I saw unknown harmonies\r\ncome forth. \'How is it,\' I said to myself, \'that I can possibly have\r\nlived so long outside Nature, without identifying myself with her!\r\nAll things five, all things are in motion, all things correspond; the\r\nmagnetic rays emanating from myself or others traverse without obstacle\r\nthe infinite chain of created things: a transparent network covers the\r\nworld, whose loose threads communicate more and more closely with the\r\nplanets and the stars. Now a captive upon the earth, I hold converse\r\nwith the starry choir, which is feelingly a part of my joys and\r\nsorrows.\'"\r\n\r\nTo have thus realised that central secret of the mystics, from\r\nPythagoras onwards, the secret which the Smaragdine Tablet of Hermes\r\nbetrays in its "As things are below, so are they above"; which Boehme\r\nhas classed in his teaching of "signatures," and Swedenborg has\r\nsystematised in his doctrine of "correspondences"; does it matter very\r\nmuch that he arrived at it by way of the obscure and fatal initiation\r\nof madness? Truth, and especially that soul of truth which is poetry,\r\nmay be reached by many roads; and a road is not necessarily misleading\r\nbecause it is dangerous or forbidden. Here is one who has gazed at\r\nlight till it has blinded him; and for us all that is important is\r\nthat he has seen something, not that his eyesight has been too weak\r\nto endure the pressure of light overflowing the world from beyond the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nAnd here we arrive at the fundamental principle which is at once\r\nthe substance and the \xc3\xa6sthetics of the sonnets "composed," as he\r\nexplains, "in that state of meditation which the Germans would call\r\nsupernaturalistic.\'" In one, which I will quote, he is explicit, and\r\nseems to state a doctrine.\r\n\r\n    VERS DOR\xc3\x89S\r\n\r\n    Homme, libre penseur! te crois-tu seul pensant\r\n    Dans ce monde o\xc3\xb9 la vie \xc3\xa9clate en toute chose?\r\n    Des forces que tu tiens ta libert\xc3\xa9 dispose,\r\n    Mais de tous tes conseils l\'univers est absent.\r\n    Respecte dans la b\xc3\xaate un esprit agissant:\r\n    Chaque fleur est une \xc3\xa2me \xc3\xa0 la Nature \xc3\xa9close;\r\n    Un myst\xc3\xa8re d\'amour dans le m\xc3\xa9tal repose;\r\n    "Tout est sensible!" Et tout sur ton \xc3\xaatre est puissant.\r\n\r\n    Crains, dans le mur aveugle, un regard qui t\'\xc3\xa9pie!\r\n    A la mati\xc3\xa8re m\xc3\xaame un verbe est attach\xc3\xa9 ...\r\n    Ne la fais pas servir \xc3\xa0 quelque usage impie!\r\n\r\n    Souvent dans l\'\xc3\xaatre obscur habite un Dieu cach\xc3\xa9;\r\n    Et comme un \xc5\x93il naissant couvert par ses paupi\xc3\xa8res,\r\n    Un pur esprit s\'accro\xc3\xaet sous l\'\xc3\xa9corce des pierres!\r\n\r\nBut in the other sonnets, in _Art\xc3\xa9mis,_ which I have quoted, in _El\r\nDesdichado, Myrtho,_ and the rest, he would seem to be deliberately\r\nobscure; or at least, his obscurity results, to some extent, from the\r\nstate of mind which he describes in _Le R\xc3\xaave et la Vie:_ "I then saw,\r\nvaguely drifting into form, plastic images of antiquity, which outlined\r\nthemselves, became definite, and seemed to represent symbols, of which\r\nI only seized the idea with difficulty." Nothing could more precisely\r\nrepresent the impression made by these sonnets, in which, for the first\r\ntime in French, words are used as the ingredients of an evocation, as\r\nthemselves not merely colour and sound, but symbol. Here are words\r\nwhich create an atmosphere by the actual suggestive quality of their\r\nsyllables, as, according to the theory of Mallarm\xc3\xa9, they should do;\r\nas, in the recent attempts of the Symbolists, writer after writer has\r\nendeavoured to lure them into doing. Persuaded, as G\xc3\xa9rard was, of the\r\nsensitive unity of all nature, he was able to trace resemblances where\r\nothers saw only divergences; and the setting together of unfamiliar\r\nand apparently alien things, which comes so strangely upon us in his\r\nverse, was perhaps an actual sight of what it is our misfortune not\r\nto see. His genius, to which madness had come as the liberating, the\r\nprecipitating, spirit, disengaging its finer essence, consisted in a\r\npower of materialising vision, whatever is most volatile and unseizable\r\nin vision and without losing the sense of mystery, or that quality\r\nwhich gives its charm to the intangible. Madness, then, in him, had\r\nlit up, as if by lightning-flashes, the hidden links of distant and\r\ndivergent things; perhaps in somewhat the same manner as that in which\r\na similarly new, startling, perhaps over-true sight of things is gained\r\nby the artificial stimulation of haschisch, opium, and those other\r\ndrugs by which vision is produced deliberately, and the soul, sitting\r\nsafe within the perilous circle of its own magic, looks out on the\r\npanorama which either rises out of the darkness before it, or drifts\r\nfrom itself into the darkness. The very imagery of these sonnets is\r\nthe imagery which is known to all dreamers of bought dreams. _Rose au\r\nc\xc5\x93ur violet, fleur de sainte Gudule; le Temple au p\xc3\xa9ristyle immense;\r\nla grotte o\xc3\xb9 nage la syr\xc3\xa8ne:_ the dreamer of bought dreams has seen\r\nthem all. But no one before G\xc3\xa9rard realised that such things as these\r\nmight be the basis of almost a new \xc3\xa6sthetics. Did he himself realise\r\nall that he had done, or was it left for Mallarm\xc3\xa9 to theorise upon what\r\nG\xc3\xa9rard had but divined?\r\n\r\nThat he made the discovery, there is no doubt; and we owe to the\r\nfortunate accident of madness one of the foundations of what may be\r\ncalled the practical \xc3\xa6sthetics of Symbolism. Look again at that sonnet\r\n_Art\xc3\xa9mis,_ and you will see in it not only the method of Mallarm\xc3\xa9, but\r\nmuch of the most intimate manner of Verlaine. The first four lines,\r\nwith their fluid rhythm, their repetitions and echoes, their delicate\r\nevasions, might have been written by Verlaine; in the later part the\r\nfirmness of the rhythms and the jewelled significance of the words are\r\nlike Mallarm\xc3\xa9 at his finest, so that in a single sonnet we may fairly\r\nclaim to see a fore-shadowing of the styles of Mallarm\xc3\xa9 and Verlaine\r\nat once. With Verlaine the resemblance goes, perhaps, no further; with\r\nMallarm\xc3\xa9 it goes to the very roots, the whole man being, certainly, his\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nG\xc3\xa9rard de Nerval, then, had divined, before all the world, that poetry\r\nshould be a miracle; not a hymn to beauty, nor the description of\r\nbeauty, nor beauty\'s mirror; but beauty itself, the colour, fragrance,\r\nand form of the imagined flower, as it blossoms again out of the page.\r\nVision, the over-powering vision, had come to him beyond, if not\r\nagainst, his will; and he knew that vision is the root out of which the\r\nflower must grow. Vision had taught him symbol, and he knew that it is\r\nby symbol alone that the flower can take visible form. He knew that\r\nthe whole mystery of beauty can never be comprehended by the crowd,\r\nand that while clearness is a virtue of style, perfect explicitness\r\nis not a necessary virtue. So it was with disdain, as well as with\r\nconfidence, that he allowed these sonnets to be overheard. It was\r\nenough for him to say:\r\n\r\n    J\'ai r\xc3\xaav\xc3\xa9 dans la grotte o\xc3\xb9 nage la syr\xc3\xa8ne;\r\n\r\nand to speak, it might be, the siren\'s language, remembering her. "It\r\nwill be my last madness," he wrote, "to believe myself a poet: let\r\ncriticism cure me of it." Criticism, in his own day, even Gautier\'s\r\ncriticism, could but be disconcerted by a novelty so unexampled. It\r\nis only now that the best critics in France are beginning to realise\r\nhow great in themselves, and how great in their influence, are these\r\nsonnets, which, forgotten by the world for nearly fifty years, have all\r\nthe while been secretly bringing new \xc3\xa6sthetics into French poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTH\xc3\x89OPHILE GAUTIER\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nGautier has spoken for himself in a famous passage of _Mademoiselle de\r\nMaupin_: "I am a man of the Homeric age; the world in which I live is\r\nnot my world, and I understand nothing of the society which surrounds\r\nme. For me Christ did not come; I am as much a pagan as Alcibiades or\r\nPhidias. I have never plucked on Golgotha the flowers of the Passion,\r\nand the deep stream that flows from the side of the Crucified and sets\r\na crimson girdle about the world, has never washed me in its flood; my\r\nrebellious body will not acknowledge the supremacy of the soul, and my\r\nflesh will not endure to be mortified. I find the earth as beautiful as\r\nthe sky, and I think that perfection of form is virtue. I have no gift\r\nfor spirituality; I prefer a statue to a ghost, full noon to twilight.\r\nThree things delight me: gold, marble, and purple; brilliance,\r\nsolidity, colour.... I have looked on love in the light of antiquity,\r\nand as a piece of sculpture more or less perfect.... All my life I have\r\nbeen concerned with the form of the flagon, never with the quality of\r\nits contents." That is part of a confession of faith, and it is spoken\r\nwith absolute sincerity. Gautier knew himself, and could tell the truth\r\nabout himself as simply, as impartially, as if he had been describing\r\na work of art. Or is he not, indeed, describing a work of art? Was not\r\nthat very state of mind, that finished and limited temperament, a thing\r\nwhich he had collaborated with nature in making, with an effective\r\nheightening of what was most natural to him, in the spirit of art?\r\n\r\nGautier saw the world as mineral, as metal, as pigment, as rock, tree,\r\nwater, as architecture, costume, under sunlight, gas, in all the\r\ncolours that light can bring out of built or growing things; he saw it\r\nas contour, movement; he saw all that a painter sees, when the painter\r\nsets himself to copy, not to create. He was the finest copyist who ever\r\nused paint with a pen. Nothing that can be expressed in technical terms\r\nescaped him; there were no technical terms which he could not reduce\r\nto an orderly beauty. But he absorbed all this visible world with the\r\nhardly discriminating impartiality of the retina; he had no moods, was\r\nnot to be distracted by a sentiment, heard no voices, saw nothing but\r\ndarkness, the negation of day, in night. He was tirelessly attentive,\r\nhe had no secrets of his own and could keep none of naturels. He could\r\ndescribe every ray of the nine thousand precious stones in the throne\r\nof Ivan the Terrible, in the Treasury of the Kremlin; but he could tell\r\nyou nothing of one of Maeterlinck\'s bees.\r\n\r\nThe five senses made Gautier for themselves, that they might become\r\narticulate. He speaks for them all with a dreadful unconcern. All his\r\nwords are in love with matter, and they enjoy their lust and have no\r\nrecollection. If the body did not dwindle and expand to some ignoble\r\nphysical conclusion; if wrinkles did not creep yellowing up women\'s\r\nnecks, and the fire in a man\'s blood did not lose its heat; he would\r\nalways be content. Everything that he cared for in the world was to be\r\nhad, except, perhaps, rest from striving after it; only, everything\r\nwould one day come to an end, after a slow spoiling. Decrepit,\r\ncolourless, uneager things shocked him, and it was with an acute,\r\nalmost disinterested pity that he watched himself die.\r\n\r\nAll his life Gautier adored life, and all the processes and forms of\r\nlife. A pagan, a young Roman, hard and delicate, with something of\r\ncruelty in his sympathy with things that could be seen and handled,\r\nhe would have hated the soul, if he had ever really apprehended it,\r\nfor its qualifying and disturbing power upon the body. No other modern\r\nwriter, no writer perhaps, has described nakedness with so abstract a\r\nheat of rapture: like d\'Albert when he sees Mlle, de Maupin for the\r\nfirst and last time, he is the artist before he is the lover, and he\r\nis the lover while he is the artist. It was above all things the human\r\nbody whose contours and colours he wished to fix for eternity, in the\r\n"robust art" of "verse, marble, onyx, enamel." And it was not the body\r\nas a frail, perishable thing, and a thing to be pitied, that he wanted\r\nto perpetuate; it was the beauty of life itself, imperishable at least\r\nin its recurrence.\r\n\r\nHe loved imperishable things: the body, as generation after generation\r\nrefashions it, the world, as it is restored and rebuilt, and then\r\ngems, and hewn stone, and carved ivory, and woven tapestry. He loved\r\nverse for its solid, strictly limited, resistant form, which, while\r\nprose melts and drifts about it, remains unalterable, indestructible.\r\nWords, he knew, can build as strongly as stones, and not merely rise\r\nto music, like the walls of Troy, but be themselves music as well as\r\nstructure. Yet, as in visible things he cared only for hard outline\r\nand rich colour, so in words too he had no love of half-tints, and was\r\ncontent to do without that softening of atmosphere which was to be\r\nprized by those who came after him as the thing most worth seeking.\r\nEven his verse is without mystery; if he meditates, his meditation has\r\nall the fixity of a kind of sharp, precise criticism.\r\n\r\nWhat Gautier saw he saw with unparalleled exactitude; he allows himself\r\nno poetic license or room for fine phrases; has his eye always on the\r\nobject, and really uses the words which best describe it, whatever\r\nthey may be. So his books of travel are guide-books, in addition to\r\nbeing other things; and not by any means "states of soul" or states\r\nof nerves. He is willing to give you information, and able to give\r\nit to you without deranging his periods. The little essay on Leonardo\r\nis an admirable piece of artistic divination, and it is also a clear,\r\nsimple, sufficient account of the man, his temperament, and his way of\r\nwork. The study of Baudelaire, reprinted in the _\xc3\xa9dition d\xc3\xa9finitive_\r\nof the "Fleurs du Mal," remains the one satisfactory summing up, it\r\nis not a solution, of the enigma which Baudelaire personified; and it\r\nis almost the most coloured and perfumed thing in words which he ever\r\nwrote. He wrote equally well about cities, poets, novelists, painters,\r\nor sculptors; he did not understand one better than the other, or feel\r\nless sympathy for one than for another. He, the "parfait magicien\r\n\xc3\xa8s lettres fran\xc3\xa7aises," to whom faultless words came in faultlessly\r\nbeautiful order, could realise, against Balzac himself, that Balzac\r\nhad a style: "he possesses, though he did not think so, a style, and a\r\nvery beautiful style, the necessary, inevitable, mathematical style of\r\nhis ideas." He appreciated Ingres as justly as he appreciated El Greco;\r\nhe went through the Louvre, room by room, saying the right thing about\r\neach painter in turn. He did not say the final thing; he said nothing\r\nwhich we have to pause and think over before we see the whole of its\r\ntruth or apprehend the whole of its beauty. Truth, in him, comes to\r\nus almost literally through the eyesight, and with the same beautiful\r\nclearness as if it were one of those visible things which delighted him\r\nmost: gold, marble, and purple; brilliance, solidity, colour.\r\n\r\n1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGUSTAVE FLAUBERT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salammb\xc3\xb4_ is an attempt, as Flaubert, himself his best critic, has\r\ntold us, to "perpetuate a mirage by applying to antiquity the methods\r\nof the modern novel." By the modern novel he means the novel as he\r\nhad reconstructed it; he means _Madame Bovary._ That perfect book is\r\nperfect because Flaubert had, for once, found exactly the subject\r\nsuited to his method, had made his method and his subject one. On his\r\nscientific side Flaubert is a realist, but there is another, perhaps\r\na more intimately personal side, on which he is lyrical, lyrical in\r\na large, sweeping way. The lyric poet in him made _La Tentation de\r\nSaint-Antoine,_ the analyst made _L\'Education Sentimentale;_ but in\r\n_Madame Bovary_ we find the analyst and the lyric poet in equilibrium.\r\nIt is the history of a woman, as carefully observed as any story\r\nthat has ever been written, and observed in surroundings of the most\r\nordinary kind. But Flaubert finds the romantic material which he\r\nloved, the materials of beauty, in precisely that temperament which he\r\nstudies so patiently and so cruelly. Madame Bovary is a little woman,\r\nhalf vulgar and half hysterical, incapable of a fine passion; but her\r\ntrivial desires, her futile aspirations after second-rate pleasures and\r\nsecond-hand ideals, give to Flaubert all that he wants: the opportunity\r\nto create beauty out of reality. What is common in the imagination of\r\nMadame Bovary becomes exquisite in Flaubert\'s rendering of it, and by\r\nthat counterpoise of a commonness in the subject he is saved from any\r\nvague ascents of rhetoric in his rendering of it.\r\n\r\nIn writing _Salammb\xc3\xb4_ Flaubert set himself to renew the historical\r\nnovel, as he had renewed the novel of manners. He would have admitted,\r\ndoubtless, that perfect success in the historical novel is impossible,\r\nby the nature of the case. We are at best only half conscious of\r\nthe reality of the things about us, only able to translate them\r\napproximately into any form of art. How much is left over, in the\r\nclosest transcription of a mere line of houses in a street, of a\r\npassing steamer, of one\'s next-door neighbour, of the point of view\r\nof a foreigner looking along Piccadilly, of one\'s own state of mind,\r\nmoment by moment, as one walks from Oxford Circus to the Marble\r\nArch? Think, then, of the attempts to reconstruct no matter what\r\nperiod of the past, to distinguish the difference in the aspect of\r\na world perhaps bossed with castles and ridged with ramparts, to\r\ntwo individualities encased within chain-armour! Flaubert chose his\r\nantiquity wisely: a period of which we know too little to confuse us,\r\na city of which no stone is left on another, the minds of Barbarians\r\nwho have left us no psychological documents. "Be sure I have made\r\nno fantastic Carthage," he says proudly, pointing to his documents:\r\nAmmianus Marcellinus, who has furnished him with "the _exact_ form of a\r\ndoor"; the Bible and Theophrastus, from which he obtains his perfumes\r\nand his precious stones; Gesenius, from whom he gets his Punic names;\r\nthe _M\xc3\xa9moires de l\'Acad\xc3\xa9mie des Inscriptions._ "As for the temple\r\nof Tanit, I am sure of having reconstructed it as it was, with the\r\ntreatise of the Syrian Goddess, with the medals of the Duc de Luynes,\r\nwith what is known of the temple at Jerusalem, with a passage of St.\r\nJerome, quoted by Seldon (_De Diis Syriis_), with the plan of the\r\ntemple of Gozzo, which is quite Carthaginian, and best of all, with\r\nthe ruins of the temple of Thugga, which I have seen myself, with my\r\nown eyes, and of which no traveller or antiquarian, so far as I know,\r\nhas ever spoken." But that, after all, as he admits (when, that is, he\r\nhas proved point by point his minute accuracy to all that is known of\r\nancient Carthage, his faithfulness to every indication which can serve\r\nfor his guidance, his patience in grouping rather, than his daring in\r\nthe invention of action and details), that is not the question. "I\r\ncare little enough for arch\xc3\xa6ology! If the colour is not uniform, if\r\nthe details are out of keeping, if the manners do not spring from the\r\nreligion and the actions from the passions, if the characters are not\r\nconsistent, if the costumes are not appropriate to the habits and the\r\narchitecture to the climate, if, in a word, there is not harmony, I am\r\nin error. If not, no."\r\n\r\nAnd there, precisely, is the definition of the one merit which can\r\ngive a historical novel the right to exist, and at the same time\r\na definition of the merit which sets _Salammb\xc3\xb4_ above all other\r\nhistorical novels. Everything in the book is strange, some of it\r\nmight easily be bewildering, some revolting; but all is in harmony.\r\nThe harmony is like that of Eastern music, not immediately conveying\r\nits charm, or even the secret of its measure, to Western ears; but a\r\nmonotony coiling perpetually upon itself, after a severe law of its\r\nown. Or rather, it is like a fresco, painted gravely in hard, definite\r\ncolours, firmly detached from a background of burning sky; a procession\r\nof Barbarians, each in the costume of his country, passes across the\r\nwall; there are battles, in which elephants fight with men; an army\r\nbesieges a great city, or rots to death in a defile between mountains;\r\nthe ground is paved with dead men; crosses, each bearing its living\r\nburden, stand against the sky; a few figures of men and women appear\r\nagain and again, expressing by their gestures the soul of the story.\r\n\r\nFlaubert himself has pointed, with his unerring self-criticism, to\r\nthe main defect of his book: "The pedestal is too large for the\r\nstatue." There should have been, as he says, a hundred pages more\r\nabout Salammb\xc3\xb4. He declares: "There is not in my book an isolated or\r\ngratuitous description; all are useful to my characters, and have an\r\ninfluence, near or remote, on the action." This is true, and yet,\r\nall the same, the pedestal is too large for the statue. Salammb\xc3\xb4,\r\n"always surrounded with grave and exquisite things," has something\r\nof the somnambulism which enters into the heroism of Judith; she has\r\na hieratic beauty, and a consciousness as pale and vague as the moon\r\nwhom she worships. She passes before us, "her body saturated with\r\nperfumes," encrusted with jewels like an idol, her head turreted with\r\nviolet hair, the gold chain tinkling between her ankles; and is hardly\r\nmore than an attitude, a fixed gesture, like the Eastern women whom\r\none sees passing, with oblique eyes and mouths painted into smiles,\r\ntheir faces curiously traced into a work of art, in the languid\r\nmovements of a pantomimic dance. The soul behind those eyes? the\r\ntemperament under that at times almost terrifying mask? Salammb\xc3\xb4 is as\r\ninarticulate for us as the serpent, to whose drowsy beauty, capable of\r\nsuch sudden awakenings, hers seems half akin; they move before us in a\r\nkind of hieratic pantomime, a coloured, expressive thing, signifying\r\nnothing. M\xc3\xa2tho, maddened with love, "in an invincible stupor, like\r\nthose who have drunk some draught of which they are to die," has the\r\nsame somnambulistic life; the prey of Venus, he has an almost literal\r\ninsanity, which, as Flaubert reminds us, is true to the ancient view\r\nof that passion. He is the only quite vivid person in the book, and\r\nhe lives with the intensity of a wild beast, a life "blinded alike"\r\nfrom every inner and outer interruption to one or two fixed ideas. The\r\nothers have their places in the picture, fall into their attitudes\r\nnaturally, remain so many coloured outlines for us. The illusion is\r\nperfect; these people may not be the real people of history, but at\r\nleast they have no self-consciousness, no Christian tinge in their\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n"The metaphors are few, the epithets definite," Flaubert tells us,\r\nof his style in this book, where, as he says, he has sacrificed less\r\n"to the amplitude of the phrase and to the period," than in _Madame\r\nBovary._ The movement here is in briefer steps, with a more earnest\r\ngravity, without any of the engaging weakness of adjectives. The style\r\nis never archaic, it is absolutely simple, the precise word being put\r\nalways for the precise thing; but it obtains a dignity, a historical\r\nremoteness, by the large seriousness of its manner, the absence of\r\nmodern ways of thought, which, in _Madame Bovary,_ bring with them an\r\ninstinctively modern cadence.\r\n\r\n_Salammb\xc3\xb4_ is written with the severity of history, but Flaubert notes\r\nevery detail visually, as a painter notes the details of natural\r\nthings. A slave is being flogged under a tree: Flaubert notes the\r\nmovement of the thong as it flies, and tells us: "The thongs, as they\r\nwhistled through the air, sent the bark of the plane trees flying."\r\nBefore the battle of the Macar, the Barbarians are awaiting the\r\napproach of the Carthaginian army. First "the Barbarians were surprised\r\nto see the ground undulate in the distance." Clouds of dust rise and\r\nwhirl over the desert, through which are seen glimpses of horns, and,\r\nas it seems, wings. Are they bulls or birds, or a mirage of the\r\ndesert? The Barbarians watch intently. "At last they made out several\r\ntransverse bars, bristling with uniform points. The bars became denser,\r\nlarger; dark mounds swayed from side to side; suddenly square bushes\r\ncame into view; they were elephants and lances. A single shout, \'The\r\nCarthaginians!\' arose." Observe how all that is seen, as if the eyes,\r\nunaided by the intelligence, had found out everything for themselves,\r\ntaking in one indication after another, instinctively. Flaubert puts\r\nhimself in the place of his characters, not so much to think for them\r\nas to see for them.\r\n\r\nCompare the style of Flaubert in each of his books, and you will\r\nfind that each book has its own rhythm, perfectly appropriate to its\r\nsubject-matter. The style, which has almost every merit and hardly\r\na fault, becomes what it is by a process very different from that\r\nof most writers careful of form. Read Chateaubriand, Gautier, even\r\nBaudelaire, and you will find that the aim of these writers has been\r\nto construct a style which shall be adaptable to every occasion,\r\nbut without structural change; the cadence is always the same. The\r\nmost exquisite word-painting of Gautier can be translated rhythm for\r\nrhythm into English, without difficulty; once you have mastered\r\nthe tune, you have merely to go on; every verse will be the same.\r\nBut Flaubert is so difficult to translate because he has no fixed\r\nrhythm; his prose keeps step with no regular march-music. He invents\r\nthe rhythm of every sentence, he changes his cadence with every mood\r\nor for the convenience of every fact. He has no theory of beauty in\r\nform apart from what it expresses. For him form is a living thing,\r\nthe physical body of thought, which it clothes and interprets. "If I\r\ncall stones blue, it is because blue is the precise word, believe me,"\r\nhe replies to Sainte-Beuve\'s criticism. Beauty comes into his words\r\nfrom the precision with which they express definite things, definite\r\nideas, definite sensations. And in his book, where the material is so\r\nhard, apparently so unmalleable, it is a beauty of sheer exactitude\r\nwhich fills it from end to end, a beauty of measure and order, seen\r\nequally in the departure of the doves of Carthage at the time of their\r\nflight into Sicily, and in the lions feasting on the corpses of the\r\nBarbarians, in the defile between the mountains.\r\n\r\n1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES BAUDELAIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nBaudelaire is little known and much misunderstood in England. Only one\r\nEnglish writer has ever done him justice, or said anything adequate\r\nabout him. As long ago as 1862 Swinburne introduced Baudelaire to\r\nEnglish readers: in the columns of the _Spectator_, it is amusing to\r\nremember. In 1868 he added a few more words of just and subtle praise\r\nin his book on Blake, and in the same year wrote the magnificent elegy\r\non his death, _Ave atque Vale._ There have been occasional outbreaks\'\r\nof irrelevant abuse or contempt, and the name of Baudelaire (generally\r\nmisspelled) is the journalist\'s handiest brickbat for hurling at random\r\nin the name of respectability. Does all this mean that we are waking\r\nup, over here, to the consciousness of one of the great literary forces\r\nof the age, a force which has been felt in every other country but ours?\r\n\r\nIt would be a useful influence for us. Baudelaire desired perfection,\r\nand we have never realised that perfection is a thing to aim at. He\r\nonly did what he could do supremely well, and he was in poverty all\r\nhis life, not because he would not work, but because he would work\r\nonly at certain things, the things which he could hope to do to his\r\nown satisfaction. Of the men of letters of our age he was the most\r\nscrupulous. He spent his whole life in writing one book of verse (out\r\nof which all French poetry has come since his time), one book of prose\r\nin which prose becomes a fine art, some criticism which is the sanest,\r\nsubtlest, and surest which his generation produced, and a translation\r\nwhich is better than a marvellous original. What would French poetry\r\nbe to-day if Baudelaire had never existed? As different a thing from\r\nwhat it is as English poetry would be without Rossetti. Neither of\r\nthem is quite among the greatest poets, but they are more fascinating\r\nthan the greatest, they influence more minds. And Baudelaire was an\r\nequally great critic. He discovered Poe, Wagner, and Manet. Where\r\neven Sainte-Beuve, with his vast materials, his vast general talent\r\nfor criticism, went wrong in contemporary judgments, Baudelaire was\r\ninfallibly right. He wrote neither verse nor prose with ease, but\r\nhe would not permit himself to write either without inspiration. His\r\nwork is without abundance, but it is without waste. It is made out\r\nof his whole intellect and all his nerves. Every poem is a train of\r\nthought and every essay is the record of sensation. This "romantic"\r\nhad something classic in his moderation, moderation which becomes at\r\ntimes as terrifying as Poe\'s logic. To "cultivate one\'s hysteria" so\r\ncalmly, and to affront the reader _(Hypocrite lecteur, mon semblable,\r\nmon fr\xc3\xa8re)_ as a judge rather than as a penitent; to be a casuist in\r\nconfession; to be so much a moralist, with so keen a sense of the\r\necstasy of evil: that has always bewildered the world, even in his\r\nown country, where the artist is allowed to live as experimentally as\r\nhe writes. Baudelaire lived and died solitary, secret, a confessor of\r\nsins who has never told the whole truth, _le mauvais moine_ of his own\r\nsonnet, an ascetic of passion, a hermit of the brothel.\r\n\r\nTo understand, not Baudelaire, but what we can of him, we must read,\r\nnot only the four volumes of his collected works, but every document\r\nin Cr\xc3\xa9pet\'s _\xc5\x92uvres Posthumes,_ and above all, the letters, and\r\nthese have only now been collected into a volume, under the care of\r\nan editor who has done more for Baudelaire than any one since Cr\xc3\xa9pet.\r\nBaudelaire put into his letters only what he cared to reveal of himself\r\nat a given moment: he has a different angle to distract the sight of\r\nevery observer; and let no one think that he knows Baudelaire when he\r\nhas read the letters to Poulet-Malassis, the friend and publisher, to\r\nwhom he showed his business side, or the letters to la Pr\xc3\xa9sidente, the\r\ntouchstone of his _spleen et id\xc3\xa9al,_ his chief experiment in the higher\r\nsentiments, Some of his carefully hidden virtues peep out at moments,\r\nit is true, but nothing that everybody has not long been aware of.\r\nWe hear of his ill-luck with money, with proof-sheets, with his own\r\nhealth. The tragedy of the life which he chose, as he chose all things\r\n(poetry, Jeanne Duval, the "artificial paradises") deliberately, is\r\nmade a little clearer to us; we can moralise over it if we like. But\r\nthe man remains baffling, and will probably never be discovered.\r\n\r\nAs it is, much of the value of the book consists in those glimpses\r\ninto his mind and intentions which he allowed people now and then to\r\nsee. Writing to Sainte-Beuve, to Flaubert, to Soulary, he sometimes\r\nlets out, through mere sensitiveness to an intelligence capable of\r\nunderstanding him, some little interesting secret. Thus it is to\r\nSainte-Beuve that he defines and explains the origin and real meaning\r\nof the _Petits Po\xc3\xa8mes en Prose: Faire cent bagatelles laborieuses qui\r\nexigent une bonne humeur constante (bonne humeur n\xc3\xa9cessaire, m\xc3\xaame\r\npour traiter des sujets tristes), une excitation bizarre qui a besoin\r\nde spectacles, de foules, de musiques, de r\xc3\xa9verb\xc3\xa8res m\xc3\xaame, voil\xc3\xa0 ce\r\nque j\'ai voulu faire!_ And, writing to some obscure person, he will\r\ntake the trouble to be even more explicit, _us_ in this symbol of\r\nthe sonnet: _Avez-vous observ\xc3\xa9 qu\'un morceau de ciel aper\xc3\xa7u par un\r\nsoupirail, ou entre deux chemin\xc3\xa9es, deux rochers, ou par une arcade,\r\ndonnait une id\xc3\xa9e plus profonde de l\'infini que le grand panorama vu du\r\nhaut d\'une montagne?_ It is to another casual person that he speaks out\r\nstill more intimately (and the occasion of his writing is some thrill\r\nof gratitude towards one who had at last done "a little justice," not\r\nto himself, but to Manet): _Eh bien! on m\'accuse, moi, d\'imiter Edgar\r\nPoe! Savez-vous pourquoi j\'ai si patiemment traduit Poe? Parce qu\'il\r\nme resemblait. La premi\xc3\xa8re fois que j\'ai ouvert un livre de lui, j\'ai\r\nvu avec \xc3\xa9pouvante et ravissement, non seulement des sujets r\xc3\xaav\xc3\xa9s par\r\nmoi, mais des phrases, pens\xc3\xa9es par moi, et \xc3\xa9crites par lui, vingt ans\r\nauparavant._ It is in such glimpses as these that we see something of\r\nBaudelaire in his letters.\r\n\r\n1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMOND AND JULES DE GONCOURT\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first visit to Edmond de Goncourt was in May, 1892. I remember my\r\nimmense curiosity about that "House Beautiful," at Auteuil, of which I\r\nhad heard so much, and my excitement as I rang the bell, and was shown\r\nat once into the garden, where Goncourt was just saying good-bye to\r\nsome friends. He was carelessly dressed, without a collar, and with\r\nthe usual loosely knotted large white scarf rolled round his neck.\r\nHe was wearing a straw hat, and it was only afterwards that I could\r\nsee the fine sweep of the white hair, falling across the forehead. I\r\nthought him the most distinguished-looking man of letters I had ever\r\nseen; for he had at once the distinction of race, of fine breeding, and\r\nof that delicate artistic genius which, with him, was so intimately\r\na part of things beautiful and distinguished. He had the eyes of an\r\nold eagle; a general air of dignified collectedness; a rare, and a\r\nrarely charming, smile, which came out, like a ray of sunshine, in the\r\ninstinctive pleasure of having said a witty or graceful thing to which\r\none\'s response had been immediate. When he took me indoors, into that\r\nhouse which was a museum, I noticed the delicacy of his hands, and the\r\ntenderness with which he handled his treasures, touching them as if he\r\nloved them, with little, unconscious murmurs: _Quel go\xc3\xbbt! quel go\xc3\xbbt!_\r\nThese rose-coloured rooms, with their embroidered ceilings, were filled\r\nwith cabinets of beautiful things, Japanese carvings, and prints (the\r\nmiraculous "Plongeuses"!), always in perfect condition (_Je cherche le\r\nbeau_); albums had been made for him in Japan, and in these he inserted\r\nprints, mounting others upon silver and gold paper, which formed a sort\r\nof frame. He showed me his eighteenth-century designs, among which I\r\nremember his pointing out one (a Chardin, I think) as the first he had\r\never bought; he had been sixteen at the time, and he bought it for\r\ntwelve francs.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the study, the room in which he worked, he showed me\r\nall of his own first editions, carefully bound, and first editions\r\nof Flaubert, Baudelaire, Gautier, with those, less interesting to me,\r\nof the men of later generations. He spoke of himself and his brother\r\nwith a serene pride, which seemed to me perfectly dignified and\r\nappropriate; and I remember his speaking (with a parenthetic disdain\r\nof the _brouillard Scandinave,_ in which it seemed to him that France\r\nwas trying to envelop herself; at the best it would be but _un mauvais\r\nbrouillard_) of the endeavour which he and his brother had made to\r\nrepresent the only thing worth representing, _le vie v\xc3\xa9cue, la vraie\r\nv\xc3\xa9rit\xc3\xa9._ As in painting, he said, all depends on the way of seeing,\r\n_l\'optique:_ out of twenty-four men who will describe what they have\r\nall seen, it is only the twenty-fourth who will find the right way of\r\nexpressing it. "There is a true thing I have said in my journal," he\r\nwent on. "The thing is, to find a lorgnette" (and he put up his hands\r\nto his eyes, adjusting them carefully) "through which to see things.\r\nMy brother and I invented a lorgnette, and the young men have taken it\r\nfrom us."\r\n\r\nHow true that is, and how significantly it states just what is most\r\nessential in the work of the Goncourts! It is a new way of seeing,\r\nliterally a new way of seeing, which they have invented; and it is in\r\nthe invention of this that they have invented that "new language" of\r\nwhich purists have so long, so vainly, and so thanklessly complained.\r\nYou remember that saying of Masson, the mask of Gautier, in _Charles\r\nDemailly:_ "I am a man for whom the visible world exists." Well, that\r\nis true, also, of the Goncourts; but in a different way.\r\n\r\n"The delicacies of fine literature," that phrase of Pater always comes\r\ninto my mind when I think of the Goncourts; and indeed Pater seems to\r\nme the only English writer who has ever handled language at all in\r\ntheir manner or spirit. I frequently heard Pater refer to certain of\r\ntheir books, to _Madame Gervaisais,_ to _L\'Art du XVIIIe\r\nSi\xc3\xa8cle,_ to _Ch\xc3\xa9rie;_ with a passing objection to what he called the\r\n"immodesty" of this last book, and a strong emphasis in the assertion\r\nthat "that was how it seemed to him a book should be written." I\r\nrepeated this once to Goncourt, trying to give him some idea of what\r\nPatera work was like; and he lamented that his ignorance of English\r\nprevented him from what he instinctively realised would be so intimate\r\nan enjoyment. Pater was of course far more scrupulous, more limited, in\r\nhis choice of epithet, less feverish in his variations of cadence; and\r\nnaturally so, for he dealt with another subject-matter and was careful\r\nof another kind of truth. But with both there was that passionately\r\nintent preoccupation with "the delicacies of fine literature"; both\r\nachieved a style of the most personal sincerity: _tout grand \xc3\xa9crivain\r\nde tous les temps,_ said Goncourt, _ne se reconna\xc3\xaet absolument qu\'\xc3\xa0\r\ncela, c\'est qu\'il a une langue personnelle, une langue dont chaque\r\npage, chaque ligne, est sign\xc3\xa9e, pour le lecteur lettr\xc3\xa9, comme si son\r\nnom \xc3\xa9tait au has de cette page, de cette ligne:_ and this style, in\r\nboth, was accused, by the "literary" criticism of its generation, of\r\nbeing insincere, artificial, and therefore reprehensible.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, in speaking of Edmond de Goncourt, to avoid\r\nattributing to him the whole credit of the work which has so long borne\r\nhis name alone. That is an error which he himself would never have\r\npardoned. _Mon fr\xc3\xa8re et moi_ was the phrase constantly on his lips, and\r\nin his journal, his prefaces, he has done full justice to the vivid and\r\nadmirable qualities of that talent which, all the same, would seem to\r\nhave been the lesser, the more subservient, of the two. Jules, I think,\r\nhad a more active sense of life, a more generally human curiosity;\r\nfor the novels of Edmond, written since his brother\'s death, have, in\r\neven that excessively specialised world of their common observation,\r\na yet more specialised choice and direction. But Edmond, there is no\r\ndoubt, was in the strictest sense the writer; and it is above all for\r\nthe qualities of its writing that the work of the Goncourts will live.\r\nIt has been largely concerned with truth--truth to the minute details\r\nof human character, sensation, and circumstance, and also of the\r\ndocument, the exact words, of the past; but this devotion to fact, to\r\nthe curiosities of fact, has been united with an even more persistent\r\ndevotion to the curiosities of expression. They have invented a new\r\nlanguage: that was the old reproach against them; let it be their\r\ndistinction. Like all writers of an elaborate carefulness, they have\r\nbeen accused of sacrificing both truth and beauty to deliberate\r\neccentricity. Deliberate their style certainly was; eccentric it may,\r\nperhaps, sometimes have been; but deliberately eccentric, no. It was\r\ntheir belief that a writer should have a personal style, a style as\r\npeculiar to himself as his handwriting; and indeed I seem to see\r\nin the handwriting of Edmond de Goncourt just the characteristics\r\nof his style. Every letter is formed carefully, separately, with a\r\ncertain elegant stiffness; it is beautiful, formal, too regular in the\r\n"continual slight novelty" of its form to be quite clear at a glance:\r\nvery personal, very distinguished writing.\r\n\r\nIt may be asserted that the Goncourts are not merely men of genius,\r\nbut are perhaps the typical men of letters of the close of our\r\ncentury. They have all the curiosities and the acquirements, the new\r\nweaknesses and the new powers, that belong to our age; and they sum\r\nup in themselves certain theories, aspirations, ways of looking at\r\nthings, notions of literary duty and artistic conscience, which have\r\nonly lately become at all actual, and some of which owe to them their\r\nvery origin. To be not merely novelists (inventing a new kind of\r\nnovel), but historians; not merely historians, but the historians of\r\na particular century, and of what was intimate and what is unknown in\r\nit; to be also discriminating, indeed innovating critics of art, but\r\nof a certain section of art, the eighteenth century, in France and in\r\nJapan; to collect pictures and _bibelots,_ beautiful things, always\r\nof the French and Japanese eighteenth century: these excursions in so\r\nmany directions, with their audacities and their careful limitations,\r\ntheir bold novelty and their scrupulous exactitude in detail, are\r\ncharacteristic of what is the finest in the modern conception of\r\nculture and the modern ideal in art. Look, for instance, at the\r\nGoncourts\' view of history. _Quand les civilisations commencent, quand\r\nles peuples se forment, l\'histoire est drame ou geste.... Les si\xc3\xa8cles\r\nqui out pr\xc3\xa9c\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9 notre si\xc3\xa8cle ne demandaient \xc3\xa0 l\'historien que le\r\npersonnage de l\'homme, et le portrait de son g\xc3\xa9nie.... Le XIXe si\xc3\xa8cle\r\ndemande l\'homme qui \xc3\xa9tait cet homme d\'\xc3\x89tat, cet homme de guerre, ce\r\npo\xc3\xa8te, ce peintre, ce grand homme de science ou de m\xc3\xa9tier. L\'\xc3\xa2me qui\r\n\xc3\xa9tait en cet acteur, le c\xc5\x93ur qui a v\xc3\xa9cu derri\xc3\xa8re cet esprit, il les\r\nexige et les r\xc3\xa9clame; et s\'il ne peut recueillir tout cet \xc3\xaatre moral,\r\ntoute la vie int\xc3\xa9rieure, il commande du moins qu\'on lui en apporte\r\nune trace, un jour, un lambeau, une relique._ From this theory, this\r\nconviction, came that marvellous series of studies in the eighteenth\r\ncentury in France (_ La Femme au XVIIIe Si\xc3\xa8cle, Portraits intimes du\r\nXVIIIe Si\xc3\xa8cle, La du Barry,_ and the others), made entirely out of\r\ndocuments, autograph letters, scraps of costume, engravings, songs,\r\nthe unconscious self-revelations of the time, forming, as they justly\r\nsay, _l\'histoire intime; c\'est ce roman vrai que la post\xc3\xa9rit\xc3\xa9 appellera\r\npeut-\xc3\xaatre un jour l\'histoire humaine._ To be the bookworm and the\r\nmagician; to give the actual documents, but not to set barren fact by\r\nbarren fact; to find a soul and a voice in documents, to make them more\r\nliving and more charming than the charm of life itself: that is what\r\nthe Goncourts have done. And it is through this conception of history\r\nthat they have found their way to that new conception of the novel\r\nwhich has revolutionised the entire art of fiction.\r\n\r\n_Aujourd\'hui,_ they wrote, in 1864, in the preface to _Germinie\r\nLacerteux, que le Roman s\'\xc3\xa9largit et grandit, qu\'il commence \xc3\xa0 \xc3\xaatre la\r\ngrande forme s\xc3\xa9rieuse, passionn\xc3\xa9e, vivante, de l\'\xc3\xa9tude litt\xc3\xa9raire et\r\nde l\'enqu\xc3\xaate sociale, qu\'il devient, par l\'analyse et par la recherche\r\npsychologique, l\'Histoire morale contemporaine, aujourd\'hui que le\r\nRoman s\'est impos\xc3\xa9 les devoirs de la science, il peut en revendiquer\r\nles libert\xc3\xa9s et les franchises. Te public aime les romans faux,_ is\r\nanother brave declaration in the same preface; _ce roman est un roman\r\nvrai._ But what, precisely, is it that the Goncourts understood by\r\n_un roman vrai?_ The old notion of the novel was that it should be\r\nan entertaining record of incidents or adventures told for their own\r\nsake; a plain, straightforward narrative of facts, the aim being to\r\nproduce as nearly as possible an effect of continuity, of nothing\r\nhaving been omitted, the statement, so to speak, of a witness on\r\noath; in a word, it is the same as the old notion of history, _drame\r\nou geste._ That is not how the Goncourts apprehend life, or how they\r\nconceive it should be rendered. As in the study of history they seek\r\nmainly the _in\xc3\xa9dit,_ caring only to record that, so it is the _in\xc3\xa9dit_\r\nof life that they conceive to be the main concern, the real "inner\r\nhistory." And for them the _in\xc3\xa9dit_ of life consists in the noting of\r\nthe sensations; it is of the sensations that they have resolved to\r\nbe the historians; not of action, nor of emotion, properly speaking,\r\nnor of moral conceptions, but of an inner life which is all made up\r\nof the perceptions of the senses. It is scarcely too paradoxical to\r\nsay that they are psychologists for whom the soul does not exist. One\r\nthing, they know, exists: the sensation flashed through the brain,\r\nthe image on the mental retina. Having found that, they bodily omit\r\nall the rest as of no importance, trusting to their instinct of\r\nselection, of retaining all that really matters. It is the painter\'s\r\nmethod, a selection made almost visually; the method of the painter who\r\naccumulates detail on detail, in his patient, many-sided observation\r\nof his subject, and then omits everything which is not an essential\r\npart of the _ensemble_ which he sees. Thus the new conception of what\r\nthe real truth of things consist in has brought with it, inevitably,\r\nan entirely new form, a breaking up of the plain, straightforward\r\nnarrative into chapters, which are generally quite disconnected, and\r\nsometimes of less than a page in length. A very apt image of this new,\r\ncurious manner of narrative has been found, somewhat maliciously, by\r\nM. Lema\xc3\xaetre. _Un homme qui marche \xc3\xa0 l\'int\xc3\xa9rieur d\'une maison, si nous\r\nregardons du dehors, appara\xc3\xaet successivement \xc3\xa0 chaque fen\xc3\xaatre, et dans\r\nles intervalles nous \xc3\xa9chappe. Ces fen\xc3\xaatres, ce sont les chapitres de\r\nMM. de Goncourt. Encore,_ he adds, _y a-t-il plusieurs de ces fen\xc3\xaatres\r\no\xc3\xb9 l\'homme que nous attendions ne passe point._ That, certainly, is\r\nthe danger of the method. No doubt the Goncourts, in their passion\r\nfor the _in\xc3\xa9dit,_ leave out certain things because they are obvious,\r\neven if they are obviously true and obviously important; that is the\r\ndefect of their quality. To represent life by a series of moments,\r\nand to choose these moments for a certain subtlety and rarity in\r\nthem, is to challenge grave perils. Nor are these the only perils\r\nwhich the Goncourts have constantly before them. There are others,\r\nessential to their natures, to their preferences. And, first of all,\r\nas we may see on every page of that miraculous _Journal,_ which will\r\nremain, doubtless, the truest, deepest, most poignant piece of human\r\nhistory that they have ever written, they are sick men, seeing life\r\nthrough the medium of diseased nerves. _Notre \xc5\x93uvre entier,_ writes\r\nEdmond de Goncourt, _reposa sur la maladie nerveuse; les peintures\r\nde la maladie, nous les avons tir\xc3\xa9es de nous-m\xc3\xaames, et, \xc3\xa0 force de\r\nnous diss\xc3\xa9quer, nous sommes arriv\xc3\xa9s \xc3\xa0 une sensitivit\xc3\xa9 supra-aigu\xc3\xab\r\nque blessaient les infiniment petits de la vie._ This unhealthy\r\nsensitiveness explains much, the singular merits as well as certain\r\nshortcomings or deviations, in their work. The Goncourts\' vision of\r\nreality might almost be called an exaggerated sense of the truth of\r\nthings; such a sense as diseased nerves inflict upon one, sharpening\r\nthe acuteness of every sensation; or somewhat such a sense as one\r\nderives from haschisch, which simply intensifies, yet in a veiled and\r\nfragrant way, the charm or the disagreeableness of outward things, the\r\nnotion of time, the notion of space. What the Goncourts paint is the\r\nsubtler poetry of reality, its unusual aspects, and they evoke it,\r\nfleetingly, like Whistler; they do not render it in hard outline, like\r\nFlaubert, like Manet. As in the world of Whistler, so in the world\r\nof the Goncourts, we see cities in which there are always fire-works\r\nat Cremorne, and fair women reflected beautifully and curiously in\r\nmirrors. It is a world which is extraordinarily real; but there is\r\nchoice, there is curiosity, in the aspect of reality which it presents.\r\n\r\nCompare the descriptions, which form so large a part of the work of the\r\nGoncourts, with those of Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier, who may reasonably be said\r\nto have introduced the practice of eloquent writing about places, and\r\nalso the exact description of them. Gautier describes miraculously, but\r\nit is, after all, the ordinary observation carried to perfection, or,\r\nrather, the ordinary pictorial observation. The Goncourts only tell you\r\nthe things that Gautier leaves out; they find new, fantastic points of\r\nview, discover secrets in things, curiosities of beauty, often acute,\r\ndistressing, in the aspects of quite ordinary places. They see things\r\nas an artist, an ultra-subtle artist of the impressionist kind, might\r\nsee them; seeing them indeed always very consciously with a deliberate\r\nattempt upon them, in just that partial, selecting, creative way\r\nin which an artist looks at things for the purpose of painting a\r\npicture. In order to arrive at their effects, they shrink from no\r\nsacrifice, from no excess; slang, neologism, forced construction,\r\narchaism, barbarous epithet, nothing comes amiss to them, so long as\r\nit tends to render a sensation. Their unique care is that the phrase\r\nshould live, should palpitate, should be alert, exactly expressive,\r\nsuper-subtle in expression; and they prefer indeed a certain perversity\r\nin their relations with language, which they would have not merely a\r\npassionate and sensuous thing, but complex with all the curiosities of\r\na delicately depraved instinct. It is the accusation of the severer\r\nsort of French critics that the Goncourts have invented a new language;\r\nthat the language which they use is no longer the calm and faultless\r\nFrench of the past. It is true; it is their distinction; it is the most\r\nwonderful of all their inventions: in order to render new sensations, a\r\nnew vision of things, they have invented a new language.\r\n\r\n1894, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVILLIERS DE L\'ISLE-ADAM\r\n\r\n\r\n_A chacun son infini_\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nCount Philippe Auguste Mathias de Villiers de L\'Isle-Adam was born at\r\nSt. Brieuc, in Brittany, November 28, 1838; he died at Paris, under the\r\ncare of the Fr\xc3\xa8res Saint-Jean-de-Dieu, August 19, 1889. Even before\r\nhis death, his life had become a legend, and the legend is even now\r\nnot to be disentangled from the actual occurrences of an existence so\r\nheroically visionary. The Don Quixote of idealism, it was not only in\r\nphilosophical terms that life, to him, was the dream, and the spiritual\r\nworld the reality; he lived his faith, enduring what others called\r\nreality with contempt, whenever, for a moment, he becomes conscious of\r\nit. The basis of the character of Villiers was pride, and it was pride\r\nwhich covered more than the universe. And this pride, first of all,\r\nwas the pride of race.\r\n\r\nDescendant of the original Rodolphe le Bel, Seigneur de Villiers\r\n(1067), through Jean de Villiers and Maria de l\'Isle and their son\r\nPierre the first Villiers de l\'Isle-Adam, a Villiers de l\'Isle-Adam,\r\nborn in 1384, had been Marshal of France under Jean-sans-Peur, Duke\r\nof Burgundy; he took Paris during the civil war, and after being\r\nimprisoned in the Bastille, reconquered Pontoise from the English,\r\nand helped to reconquer Paris. Another Villiers de l\'Isle-Adam, born\r\nin 1464, Grand Master of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, defended\r\nRhodes against 200,000 Turks for a whole year, in lone of the most\r\nfamous sieges in history; it was he who obtained from Charles V. the\r\nconcession of the isle of Malta for his Order, henceforth the Order of\r\nthe Knights of Malta.\r\n\r\nFor Villiers, to whom time, after all, was but a metaphysical\r\nabstraction, the age of the Crusaders had not passed. From a descendant\r\nof the Grand Master of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, the\r\nnineteenth century demanded precisely the virtues which the sixteenth\r\ncentury had demanded of that ancestor. And these virtues were all\r\nsummed up in one word, which, in its double significance, single to\r\nhim, covered the whole attitude of life: the word "nobility." No word\r\nreturns oftener to the lips in speaking of what is most characteristic\r\nin his work, and to Villiers moral and spiritual nobility seemed but\r\nthe inevitable consequence of that other kind of nobility by which he\r\nseemed to himself still a Knight of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.\r\nIt was his birthright.\r\n\r\nTo the aristocratic conception of things, nobility of soul is indeed a\r\nbirthright, and the pride with which this gift of nature is accepted\r\nis a pride of exactly the opposite kind to that democratic pride\r\nto which nobility of soul is a conquest, valuable in proportion to\r\nits difficulty. This duality, always essentially aristocratic and\r\ndemocratic, typically Eastern and Western also, finds its place in\r\nevery theory of religion, philosophy, and the ideal life. The pride\r\nof _being,_ the pride of _becoming:_ these are the two ultimate\r\ncontradictions set before every idealist. Villiers\' choice, inevitable\r\nindeed, was significant. In this measure, it must always be the choice\r\nof the artist, to whom, in his contemplation of life, the means is\r\noften so much more important than the end. That nobility of soul which\r\ncomes without effort, which comes only with an unrelaxed diligence over\r\noneself, that I should be I: there can at least be no comparison of its\r\nbeauty with the stained and dusty onslaught on a never quite conquered\r\nfort of the enemy, in a divided self. And, if it be permitted to choose\r\namong degrees of sanctity, that, surely, is the highest in which a\r\nnatural genius for such things accepts its own attainment with the\r\nsimplicity of a birthright.\r\n\r\nAnd the Catholicism of Villiers was also a part of his inheritance.\r\nHis ancestors had fought for the Church, and Catholicism was still\r\na pompous flag, under which it was possible to fight on behalf of\r\nthe spirit, against that materialism which is always, in one way or\r\nanother, atheist. Thus he dedicates one of his stories to the Pope,\r\nchooses ecclesiastical splendours by preference among the many\r\nsplendours of the world which go to make up his stage-pictures, and is\r\nlearned in the subtleties of the Fathers. The Church is his favourite\r\nsymbol of austere intellectual beauty; one way, certainly, by which the\r\ntemptations of external matter may be vanquished, and a way, also, by\r\nwhich the desire of worship may be satisfied.\r\n\r\nBut there was also, in his attitude towards the mysteries of the\r\nspiritual world, that "forbidden" curiosity which had troubled the\r\nobedience of the Templars, and which came to him, too, as a kind of\r\nknightly quality. Whether or not he was actually a Cabbalist, questions\r\nof magic began, at an early age, to preoccupy him, and, from the first\r\nwild experiment of _Isis_ to the deliberate summing up of _Ax\xc3\xabl,_ the\r\n"occult" world finds its way into most of his pages.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, the belief of Villiers is the belief common to all\r\nEastern mystics.[1] "Know, once for all, that there is for thee no\r\nother universe than that conception thereof which is reflected at\r\nthe bottom of thy thoughts." "What is knowledge but a recognition?"\r\nTherefore, "forgetting for ever that which was the illusion of\r\nthyself," hasten to become "an intelligence freed from the bonds and\r\nthe desires of the present moment." "Become the flower of thyself! Thou\r\nart but what thou thinkest: therefore think thyself eternal." "Man, if\r\nthou cease to limit in thyself a thing, that is, to desire it, if, so\r\ndoing, thou withdraw thyself from it, it will follow thee, woman-like,\r\nas the water fills the place that is offered to it in the hollow of the\r\nhand. For thou possessest the real being of all things, in thy pure\r\nwill, and thou art the God that thou art able to become."\r\n\r\nTo have accepted the doctrine which thus finds expression in _Ax\xc3\xabl,_\r\nis to have accepted this among others of its consequences: "Science\r\nstates, but does not explain: she is the oldest offspring of the\r\nchimeras; all the chimeras, then, on the same terms as the world (the\r\noldest of them!), are _something more_ than nothing!" And in _El\xc3\xabn_\r\nthere is a fragment of conversation between two young students, which\r\nhas its significance also:\r\n\r\n    _"Goetze._ There\'s my philosopher in full flight to the\r\n    regions of the sublime! Happily we have Science, which is a\r\n    torch, dear mystic; we will analyse your sun, if the planet\r\n    does not burst into pieces sooner than it has any right to!\r\n\r\n    _Samuel._ Science will not suffice. Sooner or later you will\r\n    end by coming to your knees.\r\n\r\n    _Goetze._ Before what?\r\n\r\n    _Samuel._ Before the darkness!"\r\n\r\nSuch avowals of ignorance are possible only from the height of a great\r\nintellectual pride. Villiers\' revolt against Science, so far as Science\r\nis materialistic, and his passionate curiosity in that chimera\'s flight\r\ntowards the invisible, are one and the same impulse of a mind to which\r\nonly mind is interesting. _Toute cette vieille Ext\xc3\xa9riorit\xc3\xa9, maligne,\r\ncompiqu\xc3\xa9e, inflexible,_ that illusion which Science accepts for the one\r\nreality: it must be the whole effort of one\'s consciousness to escape\r\nfrom its entanglements, to dominate it, or to ignore it, and one\'s art\r\nmust be the building of an ideal world beyond its access, from which\r\none may indeed sally out, now and again, in a desperate enough attack\r\nupon the illusions in the midst of which men live.\r\n\r\nAnd just that, we find, makes up the work of Villiers, work which\r\ndivides itself roughly into two divisions: one, the ideal world, or the\r\nideal in the world (_Ax\xc3\xabl, El\xc3\xabn, Morgane, Isis,_ some of the _contes,_\r\nand, intermediary, _La R\xc3\xa9volte_); the other, satire, the mockery of\r\nreality (_L\'Eve Future,_ the _Contes Cruels, Tribulat Bonhomet_). It is\r\npart of the originality of Villiers that the two divisions constantly\r\nflow into one another; the idealist being never more the idealist than\r\nin his buffooneries.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] "I am far from sure," wrote Verlaine, "that the philosophy of\r\nVilliers will not one day become the formula of our century."\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n_Ax\xc3\xabl_ is the Symbolist drama, in all its uncompromising conflict with\r\nthe "modesty" of Nature and the limitations of the stage. It is the\r\ndrama of the soul, and at the same time it is the most pictorial of\r\ndramas; I should define its manner as a kind of spiritual romanticism.\r\nThe earlier dramas, _El\xc3\xabn, Morgane,_ are fixed at somewhat the same\r\npoint in space; _La R\xc3\xa9volte,_ which seems to anticipate _The Doll\'s\r\nHouse,_ shows us an aristocratic Ibsen, touching reality with a certain\r\ndisdain, certainly with far less skill, certainly with far more beauty.\r\nBut _Ax\xc3\xabl,_ meditated over during a lifetime, shows us Villiers\' ideal\r\nof his own idealism.\r\n\r\nThe action takes place, it is true, in this century, but it takes\r\nplace in corners of the world into which the modern spirit has not\r\nyet passed; this _Monast\xc3\xa8re de Religieuses-trinitaires, le clo\xc3\xaetre de\r\nSainte Appolodora, situ\xc3\xa9 sur les confins du littoral de l\'ancienne\r\nFlandre fran\xc3\xa7aise,_ and the _tr\xc3\xa8s vieux ch\xc3\xa2teau fort, le burg\r\ndes margraves d\'Au\xc3\xabrsperg, isol\xc3\xa9 au milieu du Schwartzwald._ The\r\ncharacters, Ax\xc3\xabl d\'Au\xc3\xabrsperg, Eve Sara Emmanu\xc3\xa8le de Maupers, Ma\xc3\xaetre\r\nJanus, the Archidiacre, the Commandeur Kaspar d\'Au\xc3\xabrsperg, are at\r\nonce more and less than human beings: they are the types of different\r\nideals, and they are clothed with just enough humanity to give form to\r\nwhat would otherwise remain disembodied spirit. The religious ideal,\r\nthe occult ideal, the worldly ideal, the passionate ideal, are all\r\npresented, one after the other, in these dazzling and profound pages;\r\nAx\xc3\xabl is the disdainful choice from among them, the disdainful rejection\r\nof life itself, of the whole illusion of life, "since infinity alone is\r\nnot a deception." And Sara? Sara is a superb part of that life which is\r\nrejected, which she herself comes, not without reluctance, to reject.\r\nIn that motionless figure, during the whole of the first act silent but\r\nfor a single "No," and leaping into a moment\'s violent action as the\r\nact closes, she is the haughtiest woman in literature. But she is a\r\nwoman, and she desires life, finding it in Ax\xc3\xabl. Pride, and the woman\'s\r\ndevotion to the man, aid her to take the last cold step with Ax\xc3\xabl, in\r\nthe transcendental giving up of life at the moment when life becomes\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nAnd the play is written, throughout, with a curious solemnity, a\r\nparticular kind of eloquence, which makes no attempt to imitate the\r\nlevel of the speech of every day, but which is a sort of ideal language\r\nin which beauty is aimed at as exclusively as if it were written in\r\nverse. The modern drama, under the democratic influence of Ibsen,\r\nthe positive influence of Dumas _fils,_ has limited itself to the\r\nexpression of temperaments in the one case, of theoretic intelligences\r\nin the other, in as nearly as possible the words which the average man\r\nwould use for the statement of his emotions and ideas. The form, that\r\nis, is degraded below the level of the characters whom it attempts to\r\nexpress; for it is evident that the average man can articulate only a\r\nsmall enough part of what he obscurely feels or thinks; and the theory\r\nof Realism is that his emotions and ideas are to be given only in so\r\nfar as the words at his own command can give them. Villiers, choosing\r\nto concern himself only with exceptional characters, and with them\r\nonly in the absolute, invents for them a more elaborate and a more\r\nmagnificent speech than they would naturally employ, the speech of\r\ntheir thoughts, of their dreams.\r\n\r\nAnd it is a world thought or dreamt in some more fortunate atmosphere\r\nthan that in which we live, that Villiers has created for the final\r\nachievement of his abstract ideas. I do not doubt that he himself\r\nalways lived in it, through all the poverty of the precipitous Rue\r\ndes Martyrs. But it is in _Ax\xc3\xabl,_ and in _Ax\xc3\xabl_ only, that he has made\r\nus also inhabitants of that world. Even in _El\xc3\xabn_ we are spectators,\r\nwatching a tragical fairy play (as if _Fantasio_ became suddenly in\r\ndeadly earnest), watching some one else\'s dreams. _Ax\xc3\xabl_ envelops us in\r\nits own atmosphere; it is as if we found ourselves on a mountain top on\r\nthe other side of the clouds, and without surprise at finding ourselves\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe ideal, to Villiers, being the real, spiritual beauty being\r\nthe essential beauty, and material beauty its reflection, or its\r\nrevelation, it is with a sort of fury that he attacks the materialising\r\nforces of the world: science, progress, the worldly emphasis on\r\n"facts," on what is "positive," "serious," "respectable." Satire, with\r\nhim, is the revenge of beauty upon ugliness, the persecution of the\r\nugly; it is not merely social satire, it is a satire on the material\r\nuniverse by one who believes in a spiritual universe. Thus it is the\r\nonly laughter of our time which is fundamental, as fundamental as that\r\nof Swift or Rabelais. And this lacerating laughter of the idealist\r\nis never surer in its aim than when it turns the arms of science\r\nagainst itself, as in the vast buffoonery of _L\'Eve Future._ A Parisian\r\nwit, sharpened to a fineness of irony such as only wit which is also\r\nphilosophy can attain, brings in another method of attack; humour,\r\nwhich is almost English, another; while again satire becomes tragic,\r\nfantastic, macabre. In those enigmatic "tales of the grotesque and\r\narabesque," in which Villiers rivals Poe on his own ground, there is,\r\nfor the most part, a multiplicity of meaning which is, as it is meant\r\nto be, disconcerting. I should not like to say how far Villiers does\r\nnot, sometimes, believe in his own magic.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of him, at all events, that he employs what we\r\ncall the supernatural alike in his works of pure idealism and in his\r\nworks of sheer satire. The moment the world ceased to be the stable\r\nobject, solidly encrusted with houses in brick and stone, which it is\r\nto most of its so temporary inhabitants, Villiers was at home. When\r\nhe sought the absolute beauty, it was beyond the world that he found\r\nit; when he sought horror, it was a breath blowing from an invisible\r\ndarkness which brought it to his nerves; when he desired to mock the\r\npretensions of knowledge of or ignorance, it was always with the unseen\r\nthat his tragic buffoonery made familiar.\r\n\r\nThere is, in everything which Villiers wrote, a strangeness, certainly\r\nboth instinctive and deliberate, which seems to me to be the natural\r\nconsequence of that intellectual pride which, as I have pointed out,\r\nwas at the basis of his character. He hated every kind of mediocrity:\r\ntherefore he chose to analyse exceptional souls, to construct\r\nexceptional stories, to invent splendid names, and to evoke singular\r\nlandscapes. It was part of his curiosity in souls to prefer the complex\r\nto the simple, the perverse to the straightforward, the ambiguous to\r\neither. His heroes are incarnations of spiritual pride, and their\r\ntragedies are the shock of spirit against matter, the invasion of\r\nspirit by matter, the temptation of spirit by spiritual evil. They seek\r\nthe absolute, and find death; they seek wisdom, find love, and fall\r\ninto spiritual decay; they seek reality, and find crime; they seek\r\nphantoms, and find themselves. They are on the borders of a wisdom too\r\ngreat for their capacity; they are haunted by dark powers, instincts\r\nof ambiguous passions; they are too lucid to be quite sane in their\r\nextravagances; they have not quite systematically transposed their\r\ndreams into actions And his heroines, when they are not, like _L\'Eve\r\nFuture,_ the vitalised mechanism of an Edison, have the solemnity of\r\ndead people, and a hieratic speech. _Songe, des c\xc5\x93urs condamn\xc3\xa9s \xc3\xa0 ce\r\nsupplice, de ne pas m\'aimer!_ says Sara, in _Ax\xc3\xabl. Je ne l\'aime pas,\r\nce jeune homme. Qu\'ai-je donc fait \xc3\xa0 Dieu?_ says El\xc3\xabn. And their voice\r\nis always like the voice of El\xc3\xabn: "I listened attentively to the sound\r\nof her voice; it was tactiturn, subdued, like the murmur of the river\r\nLethe, flowing through the region of shadows." They have the immortal\r\nweariness of beauty, they are enigmas to themselves, they desire, and\r\nknow not why they refrain, they do good and evil with the lifting of an\r\neyelid, and are innocent and guilty of all the sins of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd these strange inhabitants move in as strange a world. They are the\r\nprinces and ch\xc3\xa2telaines of ancient castles lost in the depths of the\r\nBlack Forest; they are the last descendants of a great race about to\r\ncome to an end; students of magic, who have the sharp and swift swords\r\nof the soldier; enigmatic courtesans, at the table of strange feasts;\r\nthey find incalculable treasures, _tonnantes et sonnantes cataractes\r\nd\'or liquide,_ only to disdain them. All the pomp of the world\r\napproaches them, that they may the better abnegate it, or that it may\r\nruin them to a deeper degree of their material hell. And we see them\r\nalways at the moment of a crisis, before the two ways of a decision,\r\nhesitating in the entanglements of a great temptation. And this casuist\r\nof souls will drag forth some horribly stunted or horribly overgrown\r\nsoul from under its obscure covering, setting it to dance naked before\r\nour eyes. He has no mercy on those who have no mercy on themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the sense in which that word is ordinarily used, Villiers has no\r\npathos. This is enough to explain why he can never, in the phrase he\r\nwould have disliked so greatly, "touch the popular heart." His mind is\r\ntoo abstract to contain pity, and it is in his lack of pity that he\r\nseems to put himself outside humanity. _A chacun son infini,_ he has\r\nsaid, and in the avidity of his search for the infinite he has no mercy\r\nfor the blind weakness which goes stumbling over the earth, without so\r\nmuch as knowing that the sun and stars are overhead. He sees only the\r\ngross multitude, the multitude which has the contentment of the slave.\r\nHe cannot pardon stupidity, for it is incomprehensible to him. He sees,\r\nrightly, that stupidity is more criminal than vice; if only because\r\nvice is curable, stupidity incurable. But he does not realise, as the\r\ngreat novelists have realised, that stupidity can be pathetic, and that\r\nthere is not a peasant, nor even a self-satisfied bourgeois, in whom\r\nthe soul has not its part, in whose existence it is not possible to be\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nContempt, noble as it may be, anger, righteous though it may be, cannot\r\nbe indulged in without a certain lack of sympathy; and lack of sympathy\r\ncomes from a lack of patient understanding. It is certain that the\r\ndestiny of the greater part of the human race is either infinitely\r\npathetic or infinitely ridiculous. Under which aspect, then, shall\r\nthat destiny, and those obscure fractions of humanity, be considered?\r\nVilliers was too sincere an idealist, too absolute in his idealism, to\r\nhesitate. "As for living," he cries, in that splendid phrase of _Ax\xc3\xabl,_\r\n"our servants will do that for us!" And, in the _Contes Cruels,_ there\r\nis this not less characteristic expression of what was always his\r\nmental attitude: "As at the play, in a central stall, one sits out, so\r\nas not to disturb one\'s neighbours--out of courtesy, in a word--some\r\nplay written in a wearisome style and of which one does not like the\r\nsubject, so I lived, out of politeness": _je vivais par politesse._\r\nIn this haughtiness towards life, in this disdain of ordinary human\r\nmotives and ordinary human beings, there is at once the distinction and\r\nthe weakness of Villiers. And he has himself pointed the moral against\r\nhimself in these words of the story which forms the epilogue to the\r\n_Contes Cruels:_ "When the forehead alone contains the existence of a\r\nman, that man is enlightened only from above his head; then his jealous\r\nshadow, prostrate under him, draws him by the feet, that it may drag\r\nhim down into the invisible."\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nAll his life Villiers was a poor man; though, all his life, he was\r\nawaiting that fortune which he refused to anticipate by any mean\r\nemployment. During most of his life, he was practically an unknown man.\r\nGreatly loved, ardently admired, by that inner circle of the men who\r\nhave made modern French literature, from Verlaine to Maeterlinck, he\r\nwas looked upon by most people as an amusing kind of madman, a little\r\ndangerous, whose ideas, as they floated freely over the caf\xc3\xa9-table, it\r\nwas at times highly profitable to steal. For Villiers talked his works\r\nbefore writing them, and sometimes he talked them instead of writing\r\nthem, in his too royally spendthrift way. To those who knew him he\r\nseemed genius itself, and would have seemed so if he had never written\r\na line; for he had the dangerous gift of a personality which seems to\r\nhave already achieved all that it so energetically contemplates. But\r\npersonality tells only within hands\' reach; and Villiers failed even\r\nto startle, failed even to exasperate, the general reader. That his\r\n_Premi\xc3\xa8res Po\xc3\xa9sies,_ published at I the age of nineteen, should have\r\nbrought him fame was hardly to be expected, remarkable, especially in\r\nits ideas, as that book is. Nor was it to be expected of the enigmatic\r\nfragment of a romance, _Isis_ (1862), anticipating, as it does, by so\r\nlong a period, the esoteric and spiritualistic romances which were to\r\nhave their vogue. But _El\xc3\xabn_ (1864) and _Morgane_ (1865), those two\r\npoetic dramas in prose, so full of distinction, of spiritual rarity;\r\nbut two years later, _Claire Lenoir_ (afterwards incorporated in one\r\nof his really great books, _Tribulat Bonhomet_), with its macabre\r\nhorror; but _La R\xc3\xa9volte_ (1870), for Villiers so "actual," and which\r\nhad its moments of success when it was revived in 1896 at the Od\xc3\xa9on;\r\nbut _Le Nouveau Monde_ (1880), a drama which, by some extraordinary\r\ncaprice, won a prize; but _Les Contes Cruels_ (1880), that collection\r\nof masterpieces, in which the essentially French _conte_ is outdone\r\non its own ground! It was not till 1886 that Villiers ceased to be an\r\nunknown writer, with the publication of that phosphorescent buffoonery\r\nof science, that vast parody of humanity, _L\'Eve Future. Tribulat\r\nBonhomet_ (which he himself denned as _bouffonnerie \xc3\xa9norme et sombre,\r\ncouleur du si\xc3\xa8cle_) was to come, in its final form, and the superb poem\r\nin prose _Ak\xc3\xabdyss\xc3\xa9ril;_ and then, more and more indifferent collections\r\nof stories, in which Villiers, already dying, is but the shadow of\r\nhimself: _L\'Amour Supr\xc3\xaame_ (1886), _Histoires Insolites_ (1888),\r\n_Nouveaux Contes Cruels_ (1888). He was correcting the proofs of _Ax\xc3\xabl_\r\nwhen he died; the volume was published in 1890, followed by _Propos\r\nd\'au-del\xc3\xa0,_ and a series of articles, _Chez les Passants._ Once dead,\r\nthe fame which had avoided him all his life began to follow him; he had\r\n_une belle presse_ at his funeral.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he had been preparing the spiritual atmosphere of the new\r\ngeneration. Living among believers in the material world, he had been\r\ndeclaring, not in vain, his belief in the world of the spirit; living\r\namong Realists and Parnassians, he had been creating a new form of art,\r\nthe art of the Symbolist drama, and of Symbolism in fiction. He had\r\nbeen lonely all his life, for he had been living in his own lifetime,\r\nthe life of the next generation. There was but one man among his\r\ncontemporaries to whom he could give, and from whom he could receive,\r\nperfect sympathy. That man was Wagner. Gradually the younger men came\r\nabout him; at the end he was not lacking in disciples.\r\n\r\nAnd after all, the last word of Villiers is faith; faith against the\r\nevidence of the senses, against the negations of materialistic science,\r\nagainst the monstrous paradox of progress, against his own pessimism\r\nin the face of these formidable enemies. He affirms; he "believes in\r\nsoul, is very sure of God"; requires no witness to the spiritual world\r\nof which he is always the inhabitant; and is content to lose his way\r\nin the material world, brushing off its mud from time to time with a\r\ndisdainful gesture, as he goes on his way (to apply a significant word\r\nof Pater) "like one on a secret errand."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL\xc3\x89ON CLADEL\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope that the life of L\xc3\xa9on Cladel by his daughter Judith, which\r\nLemerre has brought out in a pleasant volume, will do something for the\r\nfame of one of the most original writers of our time. Cladel had the\r\ngood fortune to be recognised in his lifetime by those whose approval\r\nmattered most, beginning with Baudelaire, who discovered him before\r\nhe had printed his first book, and helped to teach him the craft of\r\nletters. But so exceptional an artist could never be popular, though he\r\nworked in living stuff and put the whole savour of his countryside into\r\nhis tragic and passionate stories. A peasant, who writes about peasants\r\nand poor people, with a curiosity of style which not only packs his\r\nvocabulary with difficult words, old or local, and with unheard of\r\nrhythms, chosen to give voice to some never yet articulated emotion,\r\nbut which drives him into oddities of printing, of punctuation, of the\r\nvery shape of his accents! A page of Cladel has a certain visible\r\nuncouthness, and at first this seems in keeping with his matter; but\r\nthe uncouthness, when you look into it, turns out to be itself a\r\nrefinement, and what has seemed a confused whirl, an improvisation, to\r\nbe the result really of reiterated labour, whose whole aim has been to\r\nbring the spontaneity of the first impulse back into the laboriously\r\nfinished work.\r\n\r\nIn this just, sensitive, and admirable book, written by one who has\r\ninherited a not less passionate curiosity about life, but with more\r\npatience in waiting upon it, watching it, noting its surprises, we\r\nhave a simple and sufficient commentary upon the books and upon the\r\nman. The narrative has warmth and reserve, and is at once tender and\r\nclear-sighted. _J\'entrevois nettement,_ she says with truth, _combien\r\nseront pr\xc3\xa9cieux pour les futurs historiens de la litt\xc3\xa9rature du XIXe\r\nsi\xc3\xa8cle, les m\xc3\xa9moires trac\xc3\xa9s au contact imm\xc3\xa9diat de l\'artiste, expos\xc3\xa9s\r\nde ses faits et gestes particuliers, de ses origines, de la germination\r\nde ses croyances et de son talent; ses critiques \xc3\xa0 venir y trouveront\r\nde solides mat\xc3\xa9riaux, ses admirateurs un aliment \xc3\xa0 leur pi\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 et les\r\nphilosophes un des aspects de l\'Ame fran\xc3\xa7aise._\r\n\r\nThe man is shown to us, _les \xc3\xa9lans de cette \xc3\xa2me toujours grondante\r\net fulgurante comme une forge, et les nuances de ce fi\xc3\xa9vreux visage\r\nd\'ap\xc3\xb4tre, brun, fin et sinueux,_ and we see the inevitable growth,\r\nout of the hard soil of Quercy and out of the fertilising contact of\r\nParis and Baudelaire, of this whole literature, these books no less\r\nastonishing than their titles: _Ompdrailles-le-Tombeau-des-Lutteurs,\r\nCelui de la Croix-aux-B\xc5\x93ufs, La F\xc3\xaate Votive de\r\nSaint-Bartholom\xc3\xa9e-Porte-Glaive._ The very titles are an excitement. I\r\ncan remember how mysterious and alluring they used to seem to me when\r\nI first saw them on the cover of what was perhaps his best book, _Les\r\nVa-Nu-Pieds._\r\n\r\nIt is by one of the stories, and the shortest, in _Les Va-Nu-Pieds,_\r\nthat I remember Cladel. I read it when I was a boy, and I cannot think\r\nof it now without a shiver. It is called _L\'Hercule,_ and it is about\r\na Sandow of the streets, a professional strong man, who kills himself\r\nby an overstrain; it is not a story at all, it is the record of an\r\nincident, and there is only the strong man in it and his friend the\r\nzany, who makes the jokes while the strong man juggles with bars and\r\ncannon-balls. It is all told in a breath, without a pause, as if\r\nsomeone who had just seen it poured it out in a flood of hot words.\r\nSuch vehemence, such pity, such a sense of the cruelty of the spectacle\r\nof a man driven to death like a beast, for a few pence and the pleasure\r\nof a few children; such an evocation of the sun and the streets and\r\nthis sordid tragic thing happening to the sound of drum and cymbals;\r\nsuch a vision in sunlight of a barbarous and ridiculous and horrible\r\naccident, lifted by the telling of it into a new and unforgettable\r\nbeauty, I have never felt or seen in any other story of a like\r\ngrotesque tragedy. It realises an ideal, it does for once what many\r\nartists have tried and failed to do; it wrings the last drop of agony\r\nout of that subject which it is so easy to make pathetic and effective.\r\nDickens could not have done it, Bret Harte could not have done it,\r\nKipling could not do it: Cladel did it only once, with this perfection.\r\n\r\nSomething like it he did over and over again, with unflagging\r\nvehemence, with splendid variations, in stories of peasants and\r\nwrestlers and thieves and prostitutes. They are all, as his daughter\r\nsays, epic; she calls them Homeric, but there is none of the Homeric\r\nsimplicity in this tumult of coloured and clotted speech, in which the\r\nlanguage is tortured to make it speak. The comparison with Rabelais\r\nis nearer. _La recherche du terme vivant, sa mise en valeur et en\r\nsaveur, la surabondance des vocables puis\xc3\xa9s \xc3\xa0 toutes sources ... la\r\ncondensation de l\'action autour de ces quelques motifs \xc3\xa9ternels de\r\nl\'\xc3\xa9pop\xc3\xa9e: combat, ripaille, palabre et luxure,_ there, as she sees\r\njustly, are links with Rabelais. Goncourt, himself always aiming at an\r\nimpossible closeness of written to spoken speech, noted with admiration\r\n_la vraie photographie de la parole avec ses tours, ses abbreviations\r\nses ellipses, son essoufflement presque._ Speech out of breath, that\r\nis what Cladel\'s is always; his words, never the likely ones, do not\r\nso much speak as cry, gesticulate, overtake one another. _L\'\xc3\xa2me de\r\nL\xc3\xa9on Cladel,_ says his daughter, _\xc3\xa9tait dans un constant et flamboyant\r\nautomne._ Something of the colour and fever of autumn is in all he\r\nwrote. Another writer since Cladel, who has probably never heard of\r\nhim, has made heroes of peasants and vagabonds. But Maxim Gorki makes\r\nheroes of them, consciously, with a mental self-assertion, giving them\r\nideas which he has found in Nietzsche. Cladel put into all his people\r\nsome of his own passionate way of seeing "scarlet," to use Barbey\r\nd\'Aurevilly\'s epithet: _un rural \xc3\xa9carlate._ Vehement and voluminous,\r\nhe overflowed: his whole aim as an artist, as a pupil of Baudelaire,\r\nwas to concentrate, to hold himself back; and the effort added impetus\r\nto the checked overflow. To the realists he seemed merely extravagant;\r\nhe saw certainly what they could not see; and his romance was always a\r\nfruit of the soil. The artist in him, seeming to be in conflict with\r\nthe peasant, fortified, clarified the peasant, extracted from that hard\r\nsoil a rare fruit. You see in his face an extraordinary mingling of the\r\npeasant, the visionary, and the dandy: the long hair and beard, the\r\nsensitive mouth and nose, the fierce brooding eyes, in which wildness\r\nand delicacy, strength and a kind of stealthiness, seem to be grafted\r\non an inflexible peasant stock.\r\n\r\n1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NOTE ON ZOLA\'S METHOD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of Zola is based on certain theories, on a view of humanity\r\nwhich he has adopted as his formula. As a deduction from his formula,\r\nhe takes many things in human nature for granted, he is content to\r\nobserve at second-hand; and it is only when he comes to the filling-up\r\nof his outlines, the _mise-en-sc\xc3\xa8ne,_ that his observation becomes\r\npersonal, minute, and persistent. He has thus succeeded in being at\r\nonce unreal where reality is most essential, and tediously real where a\r\npoint-by-point reality is sometimes unimportant. The contradiction is\r\nan ingenious one, which it may be interesting to examine in a little\r\ndetail, and from several points of view.\r\n\r\nAnd, first of all, take L\'_Assommoir,_ no doubt the most characteristic\r\nof Zola\'s novels, and probably the best; and, leaving out for the\r\npresent the broader question of his general conception of humanity,\r\nlet us look at Zola\'s manner of dealing with his material, noting by\r\nthe way certain differences between his manner and that of Goncourt,\r\nof Flaubert, with both of whom he has so often been compared, and\r\nwith whom he wishes to challenge comparison. Contrast _L\'Assommoir_\r\nwith _Germinie Lacerteux,_ which, it must be remembered, was written\r\nthirteen years earlier. Goncourt, as he incessantly reminds us, was\r\nthe first novelist in France to deliberately study the life of the\r\npeople, after precise documents; and _Germinie Lacerteux_ has this\r\ndistinction, among others, that it was a new thing. And it is done\r\nwith admirable skill; I as a piece of writing, as a work of art, it is\r\nfar superior to Zola. But, certainly, Zola\'s work has a mass and bulk,\r\na _fougue,_ a _port\xc3\xa9e,_ which Goncourt\'s lacks; and it has a savour\r\nof plebeian flesh which all the delicate art of Goncourt could not\r\nevoke. Zola sickens you with it; but there it is. As in all his books,\r\nbut more than in most, there is something greasy, a smear of eating\r\nand drinking; the pages, to use his own phrase, _grasses des lichades\r\ndu lundi._ In _Germinie Lacerteux_ you never forget that Goncourt\r\nis an aristocrat; in _L\'Assommoir_ you never forget that Zola is a\r\nbourgeois. Whatever Goncourt touches becomes, by the mere magic of his\r\ntouch, charming, a picture; Zola is totally destitute of charm. But\r\nhow, in _L\'Assommoir,_ he drives home to you the horrid realities of\r\nthese narrow, uncomfortable lives! Zola has made up his mind that he\r\nwill say everything, without omitting a single item, whatever he has\r\nto say; thus, in _L\'Assommoir,_ there is a great feast which lasts for\r\nfifty pages, beginning with the picking of the goose, the day before,\r\nand going on to the picking of the goose\'s bones, by a stray marauding\r\ncat, the night after. And, in a sense, he does say everything; and\r\nthere, certainly, is his novelty, his invention. He observes with\r\nimmense persistence, but his observation, after all, is only that of\r\nthe man in the street; it is simply carried into detail, deliberately.\r\nAnd, while Goncourt wanders away sometimes into arabesques, indulges in\r\nflourishes, so finely artistic is his sense of words and of the things\r\nthey represent, so perfectly can he match a sensation or an impression\r\nby its figure in speech, Zola, on the contrary, never finds just the\r\nright word, and it is his persistent fumbling for it which produces\r\nthese miles of description; four pages describing how two people went\r\nupstairs, from the ground floor to the sixth story, and then two pages\r\nafterwards to describe how they came downstairs again. Sometimes, by\r\nhis prodigious diligence and minuteness, he succeeds in giving you the\r\nimpression; often, indeed; but at the cost of what _ennui_ to writer\r\nand reader alike! And so much of it all is purely unnecessary, has\r\nno interest in itself and no connection with the story: the precise\r\ndetails of Lorilleux\'s chain-making, bristling with technical terms:\r\nit was _la colonne_ that he made, and only that particular kind of\r\nchain; Goujet\'s forge, and the machinery in the shed next door; and\r\njust how you cut out zinc with a large pair of scissors. When Goncourt\r\ngives you a long description of anything, even if you do not feel\r\nthat it helps on the story very much, it is such a beautiful thing in\r\nitself, his mere way of writing it is so enchanting, that you find\r\nyourself wishing it longer, at its longest. But with Zola, there is no\r\nliterary interest in the--writing, apart from its clear and coherent\r\nexpression of a given thing; and these interminable descriptions have\r\nno extraneous, or, if you will, implicit interest, to save them from\r\nthe charge of irrelevancy; they sink by their own weight. Just as\r\nZola\'s vision is the vision of the average man, so his vocabulary,\r\nwith all its technicology, remains mediocre, incapable of expressing\r\nsubtleties, incapable of a really artistic effect. To find out in a\r\nslang dictionary that a filthy idea can be expressed by an ingeniously\r\nfilthy phrase in _argot,_ and to use that phrase, is not a great feat,\r\nor, on purely artistic grounds, altogether desirable. To go to a\r\nchainmaker and learn the trade name of the various kinds of chain which\r\nhe manufactures, and of the instruments with which he manufactures\r\nthem, is not an elaborate process, or one which can be said to pay you\r\nfor the little trouble which it no doubt takes. And it is not well to\r\nbe too cer\xc3\xafain after all that Zola is always perfectly accurate in his\r\nuse of all this manifold knowledge. The slang, for example; he went to\r\nbooks for it, in books he found it, and no one will ever find some of\r\nit but in books. However, my main contention is that Zola\'s general\r\nuse of words is, to be quite frank, somewhat ineffectual. He tries\r\nto do what Flaubert did, without Flaubert\'s tools, and without the\r\ncraftsman\'s hand at the back of the tools. His fingers are too thick;\r\nthey leave a blurred line. If you want merely weight, a certain kind of\r\nforce, you get it; but no more.\r\n\r\nWhere a large part of Zola\'s merit lies, in his persistent attention\r\nto detail, one finds also one of his chief defects. He cannot leave\r\nwell alone; he cannot omit; he will not take the most obvious fact\r\nfor granted. _Il marcha le premier, elle le suivit,_ well, of course,\r\nshe followed him, if he walked first: why mention the fact? That\r\nbeginning of a sentence is absolutely typical; it is impossible for\r\nhim to refer, for the twentieth time, to some unimportant character,\r\nwithout giving name and profession, not one or the other, but both,\r\ninvariably both. He tells us particularly that a room is composed of\r\nfour walls, that a table stands on its four legs. And he does not\r\nappear to see the difference between doing that and doing as Flaubert\r\ndoes, namely, selecting precisely the detail out of all others which\r\nrenders or consorts with the scene in hand, and giving that detail\r\nwith an ingenious exactness. Here, for instance, in _Madame Bovary,_\r\nis a characteristic detail in the manner of Flaubert: _Huit jours\r\napr\xc3\xa8s, comme elle \xc3\xa9tendait du linge dans sa cour, elle fut prise d\'un\r\ncrachement de sang, et le lendemain, tandis que Charles avait le dos\r\ntourn\xc3\xa9 pour fermer le rideau de la fen\xc3\xaatre, elle dit: "Ah! mon Dieu!"\r\npoussa un soupir et s\'\xc3\xa9vanouit. Elle \xc3\xa9tait morte._ Now that detail,\r\nbrought in without the slightest emphasis, of the husband turning his\r\nback at the very instant that his wife dies, is a detail of immense\r\npsychological value; it indicates to us, at the very opening of the\r\nbook, just the character of the man about whom we are to read so much.\r\nZola would have taken at least two pages to say that, and, after all,\r\nhe would not have said it. He would have told you the position of the\r\nchest of drawers in the room, what wood the chest of drawers was made\r\nof, and if it had a little varnish knocked off at the corner of the\r\nlower cornice, just where it would naturally be in the way of people\'s\r\nfeet as they entered the door. He would have told you how Charles leant\r\nagainst the other corner of the chest of drawers, and that the edge of\r\nthe upper cornice left a slight dent in his black frock-coat, which\r\nremained visible half an hour afterwards. But that one little detail,\r\nwhich Flaubert selects from among a thousand, that, no, he would never\r\nhave given us that!\r\n\r\nAnd the language in which all this is written, apart from the\r\nconsideration of language as a medium, is really not literature at\r\nall, in any strict sense. I am not, for the moment, complaining of\r\nthe colloquialism and the slang. Zola has told us that he has, in\r\n_L\'Assommoir,_ used the language of the people in order to render the\r\npeople with a closer truth. Whether he has done that or not is not\r\nthe question. The question is, that he does not give one the sense of\r\nreading good literature, whether he speaks in Delvau\'s _langue verte,_\r\nor according to the Academy\'s latest edition of classical French. His\r\nsentences have no rhythm; they give no pleasure to the ear; they carry\r\nno sensation to the eye. You hear a sentence of Flaubert, and you see a\r\nsentence of Goncourt, like living things, with forms and voices. But a\r\npage of Zola lies dull and silent before you; it draws you by no charm,\r\nit has no meaning until you have read the page that goes before and the\r\npage that comes after. It is like cabinet-makers\' work, solid, well\r\nfitted together, and essentially made to be used.\r\n\r\nYes, there is no doubt that Zola writes very badly, worse than any\r\nother French writer of eminence. It is true that Balzac, certainly one\r\nof the greatest, does, in a sense, write badly; but his way of writing\r\nbadly is very different from Zola\'s, and leaves you with the sense of\r\nquite a different result. Balzac is too impatient with words; he cannot\r\nstay to get them all into proper order, to pick and choose among them.\r\nNight, the coffee, the wet towel, and the end of six hours\' labour\r\nare often too much for him; and his manner of writing his novels on\r\nthe proof-sheets, altering and expanding as fresh ideas came to him\r\non each re-reading, was not a way of doing things which can possibly\r\nresult in perfect writing. But Balzac sins from excess, from a feverish\r\nhaste, the very extravagance of power; and, at all events, he "sins\r\nstrongly." Zola sins meanly, he is penuriously careful, he does the\r\nbest he possibly can; and he is not aware that his best does not answer\r\nall requirements. So long as writing is clear and not ungrammatical, it\r\nseems to him sufficient. He has not realised that without charm there\r\ncan be no fine literature, as there can be no perfect flower without\r\nfragrance.\r\n\r\nAnd it is here that I would complain, not as a matter of morals,\r\nbut as a matter of art, of Zola\'s obsession by what is grossly,\r\nuninterestingly filthy. There is a certain simile in _L\'Assommoir,_\r\nused in the most innocent connection, in connection with a bonnet,\r\nwhich seems to me the most abjectly dirty phrase which I have ever\r\nread. It is one thing to use dirty words to describe dirty things:\r\nthat may be necessary, and thus unexceptionable. It is another thing\r\nagain, and this, too, may well be defended on artistic grounds, to be\r\ningeniously and wittily indecent. But I do not think a real man of\r\nletters could possibly have used such an expression as the one I am\r\nalluding to or could so meanly succumb to certain kinds of prurience\r\nwhich we find in Zola\'s work. Such a scene as the one in which Gervaise\r\ncomes home with Lantier, and finds per husband lying drunk asleep in\r\nhis own vomit, might certainly be explained and even excused, though\r\nfew more disagreeable things were ever written, on the ground of the\r\npsychological importance which it undoubtedly has, and the overwhelming\r\nway in which it drives home the point which it is the writer\'s business\r\nto make. But the worrying way in which _le derri\xc3\xa8re_ and _le ventre_\r\nare constantly kept in view, without the slightest necessity, is quite\r\nanother thing. I should not like to say how often the phrase "sa nudit\xc3\xa9\r\nde jolie fille" occurs in Zola. Zola\'s nudities always remind me of\r\nthose which you can see in the _Foire au pain d\'\xc3\xa9pice_ at Vincennes, by\r\npaying a penny and looking through a peep-hole. In the laundry scenes,\r\nfor instance in _L\'Assommoir,_ he is always reminding you that the\r\nlaundresses have turned up their sleeves, or undone a button or two of\r\ntheir bodices. His eyes seem eternally fixed on the inch or two of bare\r\nflesh that can be seen; and he nudges your elbow at every moment, to\r\nmake sure that you are looking too. Nothing may be more charming than a\r\nfrankly sensuous description of things which appeal to the senses; but\r\ncan one imagine anything less charming, less like art, than this prying\r\neye glued to the peep-hole in the Gingerbread Fair?\r\n\r\nYet, whatever view may be taken of Zola\'s work in literature, there is\r\nno doubt that the life of Zola is a model lesson, and might profitably\r\nbe told in one of Dr. Smiles\'s edifying biographies. It may even be\r\nbrought as a reproach against the writer of these novels, in which\r\nthere are so many offences against the respectable virtues, that he\r\nis too good a bourgeois, too much the incarnation of the respectable\r\nvirtues, to be a man of genius. If the finest art comes of the\r\nintensest living, then Zola has never had even a chance of doing the\r\ngreatest kind of work. It is his merit and his misfortune to have lived\r\nentirely in and for his books, with a heroic devotion to his ideal of\r\nliterary duty which would merit every praise if we had to consider\r\nsimply the moral side of the question. So many pages of copy a day, so\r\nmany hours of study given to mysticism, or Les Halles; Zola has always\r\nhad his day\'s work marked out before him, and he has never swerved\r\nfrom it. A recent life of--Zola tells us something about his way of\r\ngetting up a subject. "Immense preparation had been necessary for the\r\n_Faute de l\'Abb\xc3\xa9 Mouret._ Mountains of note-books were heaped up on\r\nhis table, and for months Zola was plunged in the study of religious\r\nworks. All the mystical part of the book, and notably the passages\r\nhaving reference to the cultus of Mary, was taken from the works of\r\nthe Spanish Jesuits. The _Imitation of Jesus Christ_ was largely\r\ndrawn upon, many passages being copied almost word for word into\r\nthe novel--much as in _Clarissa Harlowe,_ that other great realist,\r\nRichardson, copied whole passages from the Psalms. The description\r\nof life in a grand seminary was given him by a priest who had been\r\ndismissed from ecclesiastical service. The little church of Sainte\r\nMarie des Batignolles was regularly visited."\r\n\r\nHow commendable all that is, but, surely, how futile! Can one conceive\r\nof a more hopeless, a more ridiculous task, than that of setting to\r\nwork on a novel of ecclesiastical life as if one were cramming for\r\nan examination in religious knowledge? Zola apparently imagines that\r\nhe can master mysticism in a fortnight, as he masters the police\r\nregulations of Les Halles. It must be admitted that he does wonders\r\nwith his second-hand information, alike in regard to mysticism and Les\r\nHalles. But he succeeds only to a certain point, and that point lies\r\non the nearer side of what is really meant by success. Is not Zola\r\nhimself, at his moments, aware of this? A letter written in 1881, and\r\nprinted in Mr. Sherard\'s life of Zola, from which I have just quoted,\r\nseems to me very significant.\r\n\r\n"I continue to work in a good state of mental equilibrium. My novel\r\n_(Pot-Bouille)_ is certainly only a task requiring precision and\r\nclearness. No _bravoura,_ not the least lyrical treat. It does not\r\ngive me any warm satisfaction, but it amuses me like a piece of\r\nmechanism with a thousand wheels, of which it is my duty to regulate\r\nthe movements with the most minute care. I ask myself the question: Is\r\nit good policy, when one feels that one has passion in one, to check\r\nit, or even to bridle it? If one of my books is destined to become\r\nimmortal, it will, I am sure, be the most passionate one."\r\n\r\n_Est-elle en marbre ou non, la V\xc3\xa9nus de Milo?_ said the Parnassians,\r\npriding themselves on their muse with her _peplum bien sculpt\xc3\xa9._ Zola\r\nwill describe to you the exact shape and the exact smell of the rags\r\nof his naturalistic muse; but has she, under the tatters, really a\r\nhuman heart? In the whole of Zola\'s works, amid all his exact and\r\nimpressive descriptions of misery, all his endless annals of the poor,\r\nI know only one episode which brings tears to the eyes, the episode\r\nof the child-martyr Lalie in L\'_Assommoir._ "A piece of mechanism\r\nwith a thousand wheels," that is indeed the image of this immense and\r\nwonderful study of human life, evolved out of the brain of a solitary\r\nstudent who knows life only by the report of his documents, his\r\nfriends, and, above all, his formula.\r\n\r\nZola has denned art, very aptly, as nature seen through a temperament.\r\nThe art of Zola is nature seen through a formula. This professed\r\nrealist is a man of theories who studies life with a conviction that\r\nhe will find there such and such things which he has read about in\r\nscientific books. He observes, indeed, with astonishing minuteness, but\r\nhe observes in support of preconceived ideas. And so powerful is his\r\nimagination that he has created a whole world which has no existence\r\nanywhere but in his own brain, and he has placed there imaginary\r\nbeings, so much more logical than life, in the midst of surroundings\r\nwhich are themselves so real as to lend almost a semblance of reality\r\nto the embodied formulas who inhabit them.\r\n\r\nIt is the boast of Zola that he has taken up art at the point where\r\nFlaubert left it, and that he has developed that art in its logical\r\nsequence. But the art of Flaubert, itself a development from Balzac,\r\nhad carried realism, if not in _Madame Bovary,_ at all events in\r\n_L\'Education Sentimentale,_ as far as realism can well go without\r\nceasing to be art. In the grey and somewhat sordid history of Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric\r\nMoreau there is not \xc3\xa0 touch of romanticism, not so much as a concession\r\nto style, a momentary escape of the imprisoned lyrical tendency.\r\nEverything is observed, everything is taken straight from life: realism\r\nsincere, direct, implacable, reigns from end to end of the book. But\r\nwith what consummate art all this mass of observation is disintegrated,\r\narranged, composed! with what infinite delicacy it is manipulated in\r\nthe service of an unerring sense of construction! And Flaubert has no\r\ntheory, has no prejudices, has only a certain impatience with human\r\nimbecility. Zola, too, gathers his documents, heaps up his mass of\r\nobservation, and then, in this unhappy "development" of the principles\r\nof art which produced _L\'Education Sentimentale,_ flings everything\r\npell-mell into one overflowing _pot-au-feu._ The probabilities of\r\nnature and the delicacies of art are alike drowned beneath a flood of\r\nturbid observation, and in the end one does not even feel convinced\r\nthat Zola really knows his subject. I remember once hearing M.\r\nHuysmans, with his look and tone of subtle, ironical malice, describe\r\nhow Zola, when he was writing _La Terre,_ took a drive into the country\r\nin a victoria, to see the peasants. The English papers once reported\r\nan interview in which the author of _Nana,_ indiscreetly questioned\r\nas to the amount of personal observation he had put into the book,\r\nreplied that he had lunched with an actress of the Vari\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9s. The reply\r\nwas generally taken for a joke, but the lunch was a reality, and it\r\nwas assuredly a rare experience in the life of solitary diligence to\r\nwhich we owe so many impersonal studies in life. Nor did Zola, as he\r\nsat silent by the side of Mlle. X., seem to be making much use of\r\nthe opportunity. The language of the miners in _Germinal,_ how much\r\nof local colour is there in that? The interminable additions and\r\ndivisions, the extracts from a financial gazette, in _L\'Argent,_ how\r\nmuch of the real temper and idiosyncrasy of the financier do they\r\ngive us? In his description of places, in his _mise-en-sc\xc3\xa8ne,_ Zola\r\nputs down what he sees with his own eyes, and, though it is often\r\ndone at utterly disproportionate length, it is at all events done\r\nwith exactitude. But in the far more important observation of men and\r\nwomen, he is content with second-hand knowledge, the knowledge of a man\r\nwho sees the world through a formula. Zola sees in humanity _la b\xc3\xaate\r\nhumaine._ He sees the beast in all its transformations, but he sees\r\nonly the beast. He has never looked at life impartially, he has never\r\nseen it as it is. His realism is a distorted idealism, and the man who\r\nconsiders himself the first to paint humanity as it really is will be\r\nremembered in the future as the most idealistic writer of his time.\r\n\r\n1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST\xc3\x89PHANE MALLARM\xc3\x89\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nSt\xc3\xa9phane Mallarm\xc3\xa9 was one of those who love literature too much to\r\nwrite it except by fragments; in whom the desire of perfection brings\r\nits own defeat. With either more or less ambition he would have done\r\nmore to achieve himself; he was always divided between an absolute aim\r\nat the absolute, that is, the unattainable, and a too logical disdain\r\nfor the compromise by which, after all, literature is literature.\r\nCarry the theories of Mallarm\xc3\xa9 to a practical conclusion, multiply\r\nhis powers in a direct ratio, and you have Wagner. It is his failure\r\nnot to be Wagner. And, Wagner having existed, it was for him to be\r\nsomething more, to complete Wagner. Well, not being able to be that, it\r\nwas a matter of sincere indifference to him whether he left one or two\r\nlittle, limited masterpieces of formal verse and prose, the more or\r\nthe less. It was "the work" that he dreamed of, the new art, more than\r\na new religion, whose precise form in the world he was never quite able\r\nto settle.\r\n\r\n_Un auteur difficile,_ in the phrase of M. Catulle Mend\xc3\xa8s, it has\r\nalways been to what he himself calls "a labyrinth illuminated by\r\nflowers" that Mallarm\xc3\xa9 has felt it due to their own dignity to invite\r\nhis readers. To their own dignity, and also to his. Mallarm\xc3\xa9 was\r\nobscure, not so much because he wrote differently, as because he\r\nthought differently, from other people. His mind was elliptical, and,\r\nrelying with undue confidence on the intelligence of his readers, he\r\nemphasised the effect of what was unlike other people in his mind by\r\nresolutely ignoring even the links of connection that existed between\r\nthem. Never having aimed at popularity, he never needed, as most\r\nwriters need, to make the first advances. He made neither intrusion\r\nupon nor concession to those who, after all, were not obliged to read\r\nhim. And when he spoke, he considered it neither needful nor seemly\r\nto listen in order to hear whether he was heard. To the charge of\r\nobscurity he replied, with sufficient disdain, that there are many\r\nwho do not know how to read--except the newspaper, he adds, in one of\r\nthose disconcerting, oddly-printed parentheses, which make his work,\r\nto those who rightly apprehend it, so full of wise limitations, so\r\nsafe from hasty or seemingly final conclusions. No one in our time\r\nhas more significantly vindicated the supreme right of the artist in\r\nthe aristocracy of letters; wilfully, perhaps, not always wisely, but\r\nnobly, logically. Has not every artist shrunk from that making of\r\nhimself "a motley to the view," that handing over of his naked soul\r\nto the laughter of the multitude? But who, in our time, has wrought\r\nso subtle a veil, shining on this side, where the few are, a thick\r\ncloud on the other, where are the many? The oracles have always had\r\nthe wisdom to hide their secrets in the obscurity of many meanings, or\r\nof what has seemed meaningless; and might it not, after all, be the\r\nfinest epitaph for a self-respecting man of letters to be able to say,\r\neven after the writing of many books: I have kept my secret, I have not\r\nbetrayed myself to the multitude?\r\n\r\nBut to Mallarm\xc3\xa9, certainly, there might be applied the significant\r\nwarning of Rossetti:\r\n\r\n    Yet woe to thee if once thou yield\r\n    Unto the act of doing nought!\r\n\r\nAfter a life of persistent devotion to literature, he has left enough\r\npoems to make a single small volume (less, certainly, than a hundred\r\npoems in all), a single volume of prose, a few pamphlets, and a prose\r\ntranslation of the poems of Poe. It is because among these there are\r\nmasterpieces, poems which are among the most beautiful poems written in\r\nour time, prose which has all the subtlest qualities of prose, that,\r\nquitting the abstract point of view, we are forced to regret the fatal\r\nenchantments, fatal for him, of theories which are so greatly needed\r\nby others, so valuable for our instruction, if we are only a little\r\ncareful in putting them into practice.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the significance of St\xc3\xa9phane Mallarm\xc3\xa9, it is necessary\r\nto take into account not only his verse and prose, but, almost more\r\nthan these, the Tuesdays of the Rue de Rome, in which he gave himself\r\nfreely to more than one generation. No one who has ever climbed\r\nthose four flights of stairs will have forgotten the narrow, homely\r\ninterior, elegant with a sort of scrupulous Dutch comfort; the heavy,\r\ncarved furniture, the tall clock, the portraits, Manet\'s, Whistler\'s,\r\non the walls; the table on which the china bowl, odorous with\r\ntobacco, was pushed from hand to hand; above all, the rocking-chair,\r\nMallarm\xc3\xa9\'s, from which he would rise quietly, to stand leaning his\r\nelbow on the mantelpiece, while one hand, the hand which did not\r\nhold the cigarette, would sketch out one of those familiar gestures:\r\n_un peu de pr\xc3\xaatre, un peu de danseuse_ (in M. Rodenbach\'s admirable\r\nphrase), _avec lesquels il avait l\'air chaque fois d\'entrer dans la\r\nconversation, comme on entre en sc\xc3\xa8ne._ One of the best talkers of\r\nour time, he was, unlike most other fine talkers, harmonious with his\r\nown theories in giving no monologues, in allowing every liberty to\r\nhis guests, to the conversation; in his perfect readiness to follow\r\nthe slightest indication, to embroider upon any frame, with any\r\nmaterial presented to him. There would have been something almost of\r\nthe challenge of the improvisatore in this, easily moved alertness of\r\nmental attitude, had it not been for the singular gentleness with\r\nwhich Mallarm\xc3\xa9\'s intelligence moved, in these considerable feats, with\r\nthe half-apologetic negligence of the perfect acrobat. He seemed to be\r\nno more than brushing the dust off your own ideas, settling, arranging\r\nthem a little, before he gave them back to you, surprisingly luminous.\r\nIt was only afterwards that you realised how small had been your own\r\npart in the matter, as well as what it meant to have enlightened\r\nwithout dazzling you. But there was always the feeling of comradeship,\r\nthe comradeship of a master, whom, while you were there at least,\r\nyou did not question; and that very feeling lifted you, in your own\r\nestimation, nearer to art.\r\n\r\nInvaluable, it seems to me, those Tuesdays must have been to the young\r\nmen of two generations who have been making French literature; they\r\nwere unique, certainly, in the experience of the young Englishman\r\nwho was always so cordially received there, with so flattering a\r\ncordiality. Here was a house in which art, literature, was the very\r\natmosphere, a religious atmosphere; and the master of the house, in his\r\njust a little solemn simplicity, a priest. I never heard the price\r\nof a book mentioned, or the number of thousand francs which a popular\r\nauthor had been paid for his last volume; here, in this one literary\r\nhouse, literature was unknown as a trade. And, above all, the questions\r\nthat were discussed were never, at least, in Mallarm\xc3\xa9\'s treatment, in\r\nhis guidance of them, other than essential questions, considerations\r\nof art in the abstract of literature before it coagulates into a book,\r\nof life as its amusing and various web spins the stuff of art. When,\r\nindeed, the conversation, by some untimely hazard, drifted too near to\r\none, became for a moment, perhaps inconveniently, practical, it was\r\nMallarm\xc3\xa9\'s solicitous politeness to wait, a little constrained, almost\r\nuneasy, rolling his cigarette in silence, until the disturbing moment\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\nThere were other disturbing moments, sometimes. I remember one night,\r\nrather late, the sudden irruption of M. de Heredia, coming on after a\r\ndinner-party, and seating himself in his well-filled evening dress,\r\nprecisely in Mallarm\xc3\xa9\'s favourite chair. He was intensely amusing,\r\nvoluble, floridly vehement; Mallarm\xc3\xa9, I am sure, was delighted to see\r\nhim; but the loud voice was a little trying to his nerves, and then he\r\ndid not know what to do without his chair. He was like a cat that has\r\nbeen turned out of its favourite corner, as he roamed uneasily about\r\nthe room, resting an unaccustomed elbow on the sideboard, visibly at a\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\nFor the attitude of those young men, some of them no longer exactly\r\nyoung, who frequented the Tuesdays, was certainly the attitude of\r\nthe disciple. Mallarm\xc3\xa9 never exacted it, he seemed never to notice\r\nit; yet it meant to him, all the same, a good deal; as it meant, and\r\nin the best sense, a good deal to them. He loved art with a supreme\r\ndisinterestedness, and it was for the sake of art that he wished to\r\nbe really a master. For he knew that he had something to teach, that\r\nhe had found out some secrets worth knowing, that he had discovered a\r\npoint of view which he could to some degree perpetuate in those young\r\nmen who listened to him. And to them this free kind of apprenticeship\r\nwas, beyond all that it gave in direct counsels, in the pattern of\r\nwork, a noble influence. Mallarm\xc3\xa9\'s quiet, laborious life was for\r\nsome of them the only counterpoise to the Bohemian example of the\r\n_d\'Harcourt_ or the _Taverne,_ where art is loved, but with something\r\nof haste, in a very changing devotion. It was impossible to come away\r\nfrom Mallarm\xc3\xa9\'s without some tranquillising influence from that quiet\r\nplace, some impersonal ambition towards excellence, the resolve, at\r\nleast, to write a sonnet, a page of prose, that should be in its own\r\nway as perfect as one could make it, worthy of Mallarm\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n"Poetry," said Mallarm\xc3\xa9, "is the language of a state of crisis"; and\r\nall his poems are the evocation of a passing ecstasy, arrested in\r\nmid-flight. This ecstasy is never the mere instinctive cry of the\r\nheart, the simple human joy or sorrow, which, like the Parnassians,\r\nbut for not quite the same reason, he did not admit in poetry. It is a\r\nmental transposition of emotion or sensation, veiled with atmosphere,\r\nand becoming, as it becomes a poem, pure beauty. Here, for instance,\r\nin a poem, which I have translated line for line, and almost word\r\nfor word, a delicate emotion, a figure vaguely divined, a landscape\r\nmagically evoked, blend in a single effect.\r\n\r\n    SIGH\r\n\r\n    My soul, calm sister, towards thy brow, whereon scarce grieves\r\n    An autumn strewn already with its russet leaves,\r\n    And towards the wandering sky of thine angelic eye,\r\n    Mounts, as in melancholy gardens may arise\r\n    Some faithful fountain sighing whitely towards the blue!\r\n    --Towards the blue pale and pure that sad October knew,\r\n    When, in those depths, it mirrored languors infinite,\r\n    And agonising leaves upon the waters white,\r\n    Windily drifting, traced a furrow cold and dun,\r\n    Where, in one long last ray, lingered the yellow sun.\r\n\r\nAnother poem comes a little closer to nature, but with what exquisite\r\nprecautions, and with what surprising novelty in its unhesitating touch\r\non actual things!\r\n\r\n    SEA-WIND\r\n\r\n    The flesh is sad, alas! and all the books are read.\r\n    Flight, only flight! I feel that birds are wild to tread\r\n    The floor of unknown foam, and to attain the skies!\r\n    Nought, neither ancient gardens mirrored in the eyes,\r\n    Shall hold this heart that bathes in waters its delight,\r\n    O nights! nor yet my waking lamp, whose lonely light\r\n    Shadows the vacant paper, whiteness profits best,\r\n    Nor the young wife who rocks her baby on her breast.\r\n    I will depart. O steamer, swaying rope and spar,\r\n    Lift anchor for exotic lands that lie afar!\r\n    A weariness, outworn by cruel hopes, still clings\r\n    To the last farewell handkerchief\'s last beckonings!\r\n    And are not these, the masts inviting storms, not these\r\n    That an awakening wind bends over wrecking seas,\r\n    Lost, not a sail, a sail, a flowering isle, ere long?\r\n    But, O my heart, hear thou, hear thou the sailors\' song!\r\n\r\nThese (need I say?) belong to the earlier period, in which Mallarm\xc3\xa9\r\nhad not yet withdrawn his light into the cloud; and to the same period\r\nbelong the prose-poems, one of which, perhaps the most exquisite, I\r\nwill translate here.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTUMN LAMENT\r\n\r\n"Ever since Maria left me, for another star--which? Orion, Altair, or\r\nthou, green Venus?--I have always cherished solitude. How many long\r\ndays I have passed, alone with my cat! By _alone,_ I mean without a\r\nmaterial being, and my cat is a mystical companion, a spirit. I may\r\nsay, then, that I have passed long days alone with my cat, and alone,\r\nwith one of the last writers of the Roman decadence; for since the\r\nwhite creature is no more, strangely and singularly, I have loved\r\nall that may be summed up in the word: fall. Thus, in the year, my\r\nfavourite season is during those last languid summer days which come\r\njust before the autumn; and, in the day, the hour when I take my\r\nwalk is the hour when the sun lingers before fading, with rays of\r\ncopper-yellow on the grey walls, and of copper-red on the window-panes.\r\nAnd, just so, the literature from which my soul demands delight\r\nmust be the poetry dying out of the last moments of Rome, provided,\r\nnevertheless, that it breathes nothing of the rejuvenating approach of\r\nthe Barbarians, and does not stammer the infantile Latin of the first\r\nChristian prose.\r\n\r\n"I read, then, one of those beloved poems (whose streaks of rouge have\r\nmore charm for me than the fresh cheek of youth), and buried my hand\r\nin the fur of the pure animal, when a barrel-organ began to sing,\r\nlanguishingly and melancholy, under my window. It played in the long\r\nalley of poplars, whose leaves seem mournful to me even in spring,\r\nsince Maria passed that way with the tapers, for the last time. Yes,\r\nsad people\'s instrument, truly: the piano glitters, the violin brings\r\none\'s torn fibres to the light, but the barrel-organ, in the twilight\r\nof memory, has set me despairingly dreaming. While it murmured a gaily\r\nvulgar air, such as puts mirth into the heart of the suburbs, an\r\nold-fashioned, an empty air, how came it that its refrain went to my\r\nvery soul, and made me weep like a romantic ballad? I drank it in, and\r\nI did not throw a penny out of the window, for fear of disturbing my\r\nown impression, and of perceiving that the instrument was not singing\r\nby itself."\r\n\r\nBetween these characteristic, clear and beautiful poems, in verse and\r\nin prose, and the opaque darkness of the later writings, come one or\r\ntwo poems, perhaps the finest of all, in which already clearness is\r\n"a secondary grace," but in which a subtle rapture finds incomparable\r\nexpression. _L\'Apr\xc3\xa8s-midi d\'un Faune_ and _H\xc3\xa9rodiade_ have already\r\nbeen introduced, in different ways, to English readers: the former by\r\nMr. Gosse, in a detailed analysis; the latter by a translation into\r\nverse. And Debussy, in his new music, has taken _L\'Apr\xc3\xa8s-midi d\'un\r\nFaune_ almost for his new point of departure, interpreting it, at\r\nall events, faultlessly. In these two poems I find Mallarm\xc3\xa9 at the\r\nmoment when his own desire achieves itself; when he attains Wagner\'s\r\nideal, that "the most complete work of the poet should be that which,\r\nin its final achievement, becomes a perfect music": every word is a\r\njewel, scattering and recapturing sudden fire, every image is a symbol,\r\nand the whole poem is visible music. After this point began that\r\nfatal "last period" which comes to most artists who have thought too\r\ncuriously, or dreamed too remote dreams, or followed a too wandering\r\nbeauty. Mallarm\xc3\xa9 had long been too conscious that all publication is\r\n"almost a speculation, on one\'s modesty, for one\'s silence"; that "to\r\nunclench the fists, breaking one\'s sedentary dream, for a ruffling face\r\nto face with the idea," was after all unnecessary to his own conception\r\nof himself, a mere way of convincing the public that one exists; and\r\nhaving achieved, as he thought, "the right to abstain from doing\r\nanything exceptional," he devoted himself, doubly, to silence. Seldom\r\ncondescending to write, he wrote now only for himself, and in a manner\r\nwhich certainly saved him from intrusion. Some of Meredith\'s poems,\r\nand occasional passages of his prose, can alone give in English some\r\nfaint idea of the later prose and verse of Mallarm\xc3\xa9. The verse could\r\nnot, I think, be translated; of the prose, in which an extreme lucidity\r\nof thought comes to us but glimmeringly through the entanglements of a\r\nconstruction, part Latin, part English, I shall endeavour to translate\r\nsome fragments, in speaking of the theoretic writings, contained in the\r\ntwo volumes of _Vers et Prose_ and _Divagations._\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nIt is the distinction of Mallarm\xc3\xa9 to have aspired after an impossible\r\nliberation of the soul of literature from what is fretting and\r\nconstraining in "the body of that death," which is the mere literature\r\nof words. Words, he has realised, are of value only as a notation of\r\nthe free breath of the spirit; words, therefore, must be employed with\r\nan extreme care, in their choice and adjustment, in setting them to\r\nreflect and chime upon one another; yet least of all for their own\r\nsake, for what they can never, except by suggestion, express. "Every\r\nsoul is a melody," he has said, "which needs to be readjusted; and for\r\nthat are the flute or viol of each." The word, treated indeed with\r\na kind of "adoration," as he says, is so regarded in a magnificent\r\nsense, in which it is apprehended as a living thing, itself the vision\r\nrather than the reality; at least the philtre of the evocation. The\r\nword, chosen as he chooses it, is for him a liberating principle, by\r\nwhich the spirit is extracted from matter; takes form, perhaps assumes\r\nimmortality. Thus an artificiality, even, in the use of words, that\r\nseeming artificiality which comes from using words as if they had\r\nnever been used before, that chimerical search after the virginity of\r\nlanguage, is but the paradoxical outward sign of an extreme discontent\r\nwith even the best of their service. Writers who use words fluently,\r\nseeming to disregard their importance, do so from an unconscious\r\nconfidence in their expressiveness, which the scrupulous thinker, the\r\nprecise dreamer, can never place in the most carefully chosen among\r\nthem. To evoke, by some elaborate, instantaneous magic of language,\r\nwithout the formality of an after all impossible description; to be,\r\nrather than to express: that is what Mallarm\xc3\xa9 has consistently, and\r\nfrom the first, sought in verse and prose. And he has sought this\r\nwandering, illusive, beckoning butterfly, the soul of dreams, over\r\nmore and more entangled ground; and it has led him into the depths of\r\nmany forests, far from the sunlight. To say that he has found what he\r\nsought is impossible; but (is it possible to avoid saying?) how heroic\r\na search, and what marvellous discoveries by the way!\r\n\r\nI think I understand, though; I cannot claim his own authority for my\r\nsupposition, the way in which Mallarm\xc3\xa9 wrote verse, and the reason\r\nwhy it became more and more abstruse, more and more unintelligible.\r\nRemember his principle: that to name is to destroy, to suggest is to\r\ncreate. Note, further, that he condemns the inclusion in verse of\r\nanything but, "for example, the horror of the forest, or the silent\r\nthunder afloat in the leaves; not the intrinsic, dense wood of the\r\ntrees." He has received, then, a mental sensation: let it be the\r\nhorror of the forest. This sensation begins to form in his brain,\r\nat first probably no more than a rhythm, absolutely without words.\r\nGradually thought begins to concentrate itself (but with an extreme\r\ncare, lest it should break the tension on which all depends) upon\r\nthe sensation, already struggling to find its own consciousness.\r\nDelicately, stealthily, with infinitely timid precaution, words present\r\nthemselves, at first in silence. Every word seems like a desecration,\r\nseems, the clearer it is, to throw back the original sensation farther\r\nand farther into the darkness. But, guided always by the rhythm,\r\nwhich is the executive soul (as, in Aristotle\'s definition, the soul\r\nis the form of the body), words come slowly, one by one, shaping the\r\nmessage. Imagine the poem already written down, at least composed. In\r\nits very imperfection, it is clear, it shows the links by which it\r\nhas been riveted together; the whole process of its construction can\r\nbe studied. Now most writers would be content; but with Mallarm\xc3\xa9 the\r\nwork has only begun. In the final result there must be no sign of the\r\nmaking, there must be only the thing made. He works over it, word by\r\nword, changing a word here, for its colour, which is not precisely the\r\ncolour required, a word there, for the break it makes in the music. A\r\nnew image occurs to him, rarer, subtler, than the one he has used; the\r\nimage is transferred. By the time the poem has reached, as it seems\r\nto him, a flawless unity, the steps of the progress have been only\r\ntoo effectually effaced; and while the poet, who has seen the thing\r\nfrom the beginning, still sees the relation of point to point, the\r\nreader, who comes to it only in its final stage, finds himself in a not\r\nunnatural bewilderment. Pursue this manner of writing to its ultimate\r\ndevelopment; start with an enigma, and then withdraw the key of the\r\nenigma; and you arrive, easily at the frozen impenetrability of those\r\nlatest sonnets, in which the absence of all punctuation is scarcely a\r\nrecognisable hindrance.\r\n\r\nThat, I fancy to myself, was his actual way of writing; here, in what\r\nI prefer to give as a corollary, is the theory. "Symbolist, Decadent,\r\nor Mystic, the schools thus called by themselves, or thus hastily\r\nlabelled by our information-press, adopt, for meeting-place, the point\r\nof an Idealism which (similarly as in fugues, in sonatas) rejects\r\nthe \'natural\' materials, and, as brutal, a direct thought ordering\r\nthem; to retain no more than suggestion. To be instituted, a relation\r\nbetween images, exact; and that therefrom should detach itself a third\r\naspect, fusible and clear, offered to the divination. Abolished, the\r\npretension, \xc3\xa6sthetically an error, despite its dominion over almost all\r\nthe masterpieces, to enclose within the subtle paper other than, for\r\nexample, the horror of the forest, or the silent thunder afloat in the\r\nleaves; not the intrinsic, dense wood of the trees. Some few bursts of\r\npersonal pride, veridically trumpeted, awaken the architecture of the\r\npalace, alone habitable; not of stone, on which the pages would close\r\nbut ill." For example (it is his own): "I say: a flower! and out of the\r\noblivion to which my voice consigns every contour, so far as anything\r\nsave the known calyx, musically arises, idea, and exquisite, the one\r\nflower absent from all bouquets." "The pure work," then, "implies the\r\nelocutionary disappearance of the poet, who yields place to the words,\r\nimmobilised by the shock of their inequality; they take light from\r\nmutual reflection, like an actual trail of fire over precious stones,\r\nreplacing the old lyric afflatus or the enthusiastic personal direction\r\nof the phrase." "The verse which out of many vocables remakes an entire\r\nword, new, unknown to the language, and as if magical, attains this\r\nisolation of speech." Whence, it being "music which rejoins verse,\r\nto form, since Wagner, Poetry," the final conclusion: "That we are\r\nnow precisely at the moment of seeking, before that breaking up of\r\nthe large rhythms of literature, and their scattering in articulate,\r\nalmost instrumental, nervous waves, an art which shall complete the\r\ntransposition, into the Book, of the symphony or simply recapture\r\nour own: for, it is not in elementary sonorities of brass, strings,\r\nwood, unquestionably, but in the intellectual word at its utmost,\r\nthat, fully and evidently, we should find, drawing to itself all the\r\ncorrespondences of the universe, the supreme Music."\r\n\r\nHere, literally translated, in exactly the arrangement of the original,\r\nare some passages out of the theoretic writings, which I have brought\r\ntogether, to indicate what seem to me the main lines of Mallarm\xc3\xa9\'s\r\ndoctrine. It is the doctrine which, as I have already said, had been\r\ndivined by G\xc3\xa9rard de Nerval; but what, in G\xc3\xa9rard, was pure vision,\r\nbecomes in Mallarm\xc3\xa9 a logical sequence of meditation. Mallarm\xc3\xa9 was\r\nnot a mystic, to whom anything came unconsciously; he was a thinker,\r\nin whom an extraordinary subtlety of mind was exercised on always\r\nexplicit, though by no means the common, problems. "A seeker after\r\nsomething in the world, that is there in no satisfying measure, or not\r\nat all," he pursued his search with unwearying persistence with a sharp\r\nmental division of dream and idea, certainly very lucid to himself,\r\nhowever he may have failed to render his expression clear to others.\r\nAnd I, for one, cannot doubt that he was, for the most part, entirely\r\nright in his statement and analysis of the new conditions under which\r\nwe are now privileged or condemned to write. His obscurity was partly\r\nhis failure to carry out the spirit of his own directions; but, apart\r\nfrom obscurity, which we may all be fortunate enough to escape, is it\r\npossible for a writer, at the present day, to be quite simple, with\r\nthe old, objective simplicity, in either thought or expression? To be\r\n_naif,_ to be archaic, is not to be either natural or simple; I affirm\r\nthat it is not natural to be what is called "natural" any longer. We\r\nhave no longer the mental attitude of those to whom a story was but a\r\nstory, and all stories good; we have realised since it was proved to\r\nus by Poe, not merely that the age of epics is past, but that no long\r\npoem was ever written; the finest long poem in the world being but a\r\nseries of short poems linked together by prose. And, naturally, we can\r\nno longer write what we can no longer accept. Symbolism, implicit in\r\nall literature from the beginning, as it is implicit in the very words\r\nwe use, comes to us now, at last quite conscious of itself, offering us\r\nthe only escape from our many imprisonments. We find a new, an older,\r\nsense in the so worn-out forms of things; the world, which we can no\r\nlonger believe in as the satisfying material object it was to our\r\ngrandparents, becomes transfigured with a new light; words, which long\r\nusage had darkened almost out of recognition, take fresh lustre. And\r\nit is on the lines of that spiritualising of the word, that perfecting\r\nof form in its capacity for allusion and suggestion, that confidence\r\nin the eternal correspondences between the visible and the invisible\r\nuniverse, which Mallarm\xc3\xa9 taught, and too intermittently practised, that\r\nliterature must now move, if it is in any sense to move forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAUL VERLAINE\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n_"Bien affectueusement_ ... yours, P. Verlaine." So, in its gay and\r\nfriendly mingling of French and English, ended the last letter I had\r\nfrom Verlaine. A few days afterwards came the telegram from Paris\r\ntelling me of his death, in the Rue Descartes, on that 8th January,\r\n1896.\r\n\r\n"Condemned to death," as he was, in Victor Hugo\'s phrase of men in\r\ngeneral, "with a sort of indefinite reprieve," and gravely ill as I\r\nhad for some time known him to be, it was still with a shock, not only\r\nof sorrow, but of surprise, that I heard the news of his death. He had\r\nsuffered and survived so much, and I found it so hard to associate the\r\nidea of death with one who had always been so passionately in love with\r\nlife, more passionately in love with life than any man I ever knew.\r\nRest was one of the delicate privileges of life which he never loved:\r\nhe did but endure it with grumbling gaiety when a hospital-bed claimed\r\nhim. And whenever he spoke to me of the long rest which has now sealed\r\nhis eyelids, it was with a shuddering revolt from the thought of ever\r\ngoing away into the cold, out of the sunshine which had been so warm\r\nto him. With all his pains, misfortunes, and the calamities which\r\nfollowed him step by step all his life, I think few men ever got so\r\nmuch out of their lives, or lived so fully, so intensely, with such a\r\ngenius for living. That, indeed, is why he was a great poet. Verlaine\r\nwas a man who gave its full value to every moment, who got out of\r\nevery moment all that that moment had to give him. It was not always,\r\nnot often, perhaps, pleasure. But it was energy, the vital force of a\r\nnature which was always receiving and giving out, never at rest, never\r\npassive, or indifferent, or hesitating. It is impossible for me to\r\nconvey to those who did not know him any notion of how sincere he was.\r\nThe word "sincerity" seems hardly to have emphasis enough to say, in\r\nregard to this one man, what it says, adequately enough, of others.\r\nHe sinned, and it was with all his humanity; he repented, and it was\r\nwith all his soul. And to every occurrence of the day, to every mood\r\nof the mind, to every impulse of the creative instinct, he brought the\r\nsame unparalleled sharpness of sensation. When, in 1894, he was my\r\nguest in London, I was amazed by the exactitude of his memory of the\r\nmere turnings of the streets, the shapes and colours of the buildings,\r\nwhich he had not seen for twenty years. He saw, he felt, he remembered,\r\neverything, with an unconscious mental selection of the fine shades,\r\nthe essential part of things, or precisely those aspects which most\r\nother people would pass by.\r\n\r\nFew poets of our time have been more often drawn, few have been easier\r\nto draw, few have better repaid drawing, than Paul Verlaine. A face\r\nwithout a beautiful line, a face all character, full of somnolence\r\nand sudden fire, in which every irregularity was a kind of aid to\r\nthe hand, could not but tempt the artist desiring at once to render\r\na significant likeness and to have his own part in the creation of a\r\npicture. Verlaine, like all men of genius, had something of the air\r\nof the somnambulist: that profound slumber of the face, as it was in\r\nhim, with its startling awakenings. It was a face devoured by dreams,\r\nfeverish and somnolent; it had earthly passion, intellectual pride,\r\nspiritual humility; the air of one who remembers, not without an\r\neffort, who is listening, half distractedly to something which other\r\npeople do not hear; coming back so suddenly, and from so far, with the\r\nrelief of one who steps out of that obscure shadow into the noisier\r\nforgetfulness of life. The eyes, often half closed, were like the eyes\r\nof a cat between sleeping and waking; eyes in which contemplation was\r\n"itself an act." A remarkable lithograph by Mr. Rothenstein (the face\r\nlit by oblique eyes, the folded hands thrust into the cheek) gives with\r\nsingular truth the sensation of that restless watch on things which\r\nthis prisoner of so many chains kept without slackening. To Verlaine\r\nevery corner of the world was alive with tempting and consoling and\r\nterrifying beauty. I have never known any one to whom the sight of the\r\neyes was so intense and imaginative a thing. To him, physical sight and\r\nspiritual vision, by some strange alchemical operation of the brain,\r\nwere one. And in the disquietude of his face, which seemed to take\r\nsuch close heed of things, precisely because it was sufficiently apart\r\nfrom them to be always a spectator, there was a realisable process of\r\nvision continually going on, in which all the loose ends of the visible\r\nworld were being caught up into a new mental fabric.\r\n\r\nAnd along with this fierce subjectivity, into which the egoism of\r\nthe artist entered so unconsciously, and in which it counted for so\r\nmuch, there was more than the usual amount of childishness, always\r\nin some measure present in men of genius. There was a real, almost\r\nblithe, childishness in the way in which he would put on his "Satanic"\r\nexpression, of which it was part of the joke that every one should not\r\nbe quite in the secret. It was a whim of this kind which made him put\r\nat the beginning of _Romances sans Paroles_ that very criminal image\r\nof a head which had so little resemblance with even the shape, indeed\r\ncurious enough, of his actual head. "Born under the sign of Saturn,"\r\nas he no doubt was, with that "old prisoner\'s head" of which he tells\r\nus, it was by his amazing faculty for a simple kind of happiness that\r\nhe always impressed me. I have never seen so cheerful an invalid as\r\nhe used to be at that hospital, the H\xc3\xb4pital Saint-Louis, where at one\r\ntime I used to go and see him every week. His whole face seemed to\r\nchuckle as he would tell me, in his emphatic, confiding way, everything\r\nthat entered into his head; the droll stories cut short by a groan, a\r\nlamentation, a sudden fury of reminiscence, at which his face would\r\ncloud or convulse, the wild eyebrows slanting up and down; and then,\r\nsuddenly, the good laugh would be back, clearing the air. No one was\r\never so responsive to his own moods as Verlaine, and with him every\r\nmood had the vehemence of a passion. Is not his whole art a delicate\r\nwaiting upon moods, with that perfect confidence in them as they are,\r\nwhich it is a large part of ordinary education to discourage in us,\r\nand a large part of experience to repress? But to Verlaine, happily,\r\nexperience taught nothing; or rather, it taught him only to cling the\r\nmore closely to those moods in whose succession lies the more intimate\r\npart of our spiritual life. It is no doubt well for society that man\r\nshould learn by experience; for the artist the benefit is doubtful.\r\nThe artist, it cannot be too clearly understood, has no more part in\r\nsociety than a monk in domestic life: he cannot be judged by its rules,\r\nhe can be neither praised not blamed for his acceptance or rejection\r\nof its conventions. Social rules are made by normal people for normal\r\npeople, and the man of genius is fundamentally abnormal. It is the poet\r\nagainst society, society against the poet, a direct antagonism; the\r\nshock of which, however, it is often possible to avoid by a compromise.\r\nSo much licence is allowed on the one side, so much liberty foregone\r\non the other. The consequences are not always of the best, art being\r\ngenerally the loser. But there are certain natures to which compromise\r\nis impossible; and the nature of Verlaine was one of these natures.\r\n\r\n"The soul of an immortal child," says one who has understood him better\r\nthan others, Charles Morice, "that is the soul of Verlaine, with\r\nall the privileges and all the perils of so being; with the sudden\r\ndespair so easily distracted, the vivid gaieties without a cause,\r\nthe excessive suspicions and the excessive confidences, the whims so\r\neasily outwearied, the deaf and blind infatuations, with, especially,\r\nthe unceasing renewal of impressions in the incorruptible integrity\r\nof personal vision and sensation. Years, influences, teachings, may\r\npass over a temperament such as this, may irritate it, may fatigue\r\nit; transform it, never--never so much as to alter that particular\r\nunity which consists in a dualism, in the division of forces between\r\nthe longing after what is evil and the adoration of what is good; or\r\nrather, in the antagonism of spirit and flesh. Other men \'arrange\'\r\ntheir lives, take sides, follow one direction; Verlaine hesitates\r\nbefore a choice, which seems to him monstrous, for, with the integral\r\n_na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9_ of irrefutable human truth, he cannot resign himself, however\r\nstrong may be the doctrine, however enticing may be the passion, to the\r\nnecessity of sacrificing one to the other, and from one to the other he\r\noscillates without a moment\'s repose."\r\n\r\nIt is in such a sense as this that Verlaine may be said to have\r\nlearnt nothing from experience, in the sense that he learnt everything\r\ndirect from life, and without comparing day with day. That the\r\nexquisite artist of the _F\xc3\xaates Galantes_ should become the great\r\npoet of _Sagesse,_ it was needful that things should have happened\r\nas disastrously as they did: the marriage with the girl-wife, that\r\nbrief idyl, the passion for drink, those other forbidden passions,\r\nvagabondage, an attempted crime, the eighteen months of prison,\r\nconversion; followed, as it had to be, by relapse, bodily sickness,\r\npoverty, beggary almost, a lower and lower descent into mean\r\ndistresses. It was needful that all this should happen, in order that\r\nthe spiritual vision should eclipse the material vision; but it was\r\nneedful that all this should happen in vain, so far as the conduct of\r\nlife was concerned. Reflection, in Verlaine, is pure waste; it is the\r\nspeech of the soul and the speech of the eyes, that we must listen to\r\nin his verse, never the speech of the reason. And I call him fortunate\r\nbecause, going through life with a great unconsciousness of what most\r\nmen spend their lives in considering, he was able to abandon himself\r\nentirely to himself, to his unimpeded vision, to his unchecked emotion,\r\nto the passionate sincerity which in him was genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nFrench poetry, before Verlaine, was an admirable vehicle for a really\r\nfine, a really poetical, kind of rhetoric. With Victor Hugo, for the\r\nfirst time since Ronsard (the two or three masterpieces of Ronsard\r\nand his companions) it had learnt to sing; with Baudelaire it had\r\ninvented a new vocabulary for the expression of subtle, often perverse,\r\nessentially modern emotion and sensation. But with Victor Hugo,\r\nwith Baudelaire, we are still under the dominion of rhetoric. "Take\r\neloquence, and wring its neck!" said Verlaine in his _Art Po\xc3\xa9tique;_\r\nand he showed, by writing it, that French verse could be written\r\nwithout rhetoric. It was partly from his study of English models that\r\nhe learnt the secret of liberty in verse, but it was much more a secret\r\nfound by the way, in the mere endeavour to be absolutely sincere, to\r\nexpress exactly what he saw, to give voice to his own temperament, in\r\nwhich intensity of feeling seemed to find its own expression, as if by\r\naccident. _L\'art, mes enfants, c\'est d\'\xc3\xaatre absolument soi-m\xc3\xaame,_ he\r\ntells us in one of his later poems; and, with such a personality as\r\nVerlaine\'s to express, what more has art to do, if it would truly, and\r\nin any interesting manner, hold the mirror up to nature?\r\n\r\nFor, consider the natural qualities which this man had for the task of\r\ncreating a new poetry. "Sincerity, and the impression of the moment\r\nfollowed to the letter": that is how he defined his theory of style, in\r\nan article written about himself.\r\n\r\n    Car nous voulons la nuance encor,\r\n    Pas la couleur, rien que la nuance!\r\n\r\nas he cries, in his famous _Art Po\xc3\xa9tique._ Take, then, his\r\nsusceptibility of the senses, an emotional susceptibility not less\r\ndelicate; a life sufficiently troubled to draw out every emotion of\r\nwhich he was capable, and, with it, that absorption in the moment,\r\nthat inability to look before or after; the need to love and the need\r\nto confess, each a passion; an art of painting the fine shades of\r\nlandscape, of evoking atmosphere, which can be compared only with the\r\nart of Whistler; a simplicity of language which is the direct outcome\r\nof a simplicity of temperament, with just enough consciousness of\r\nitself for a final elegance; and, at the very depth of his being, an\r\nalmost fierce humility, by which the passion of love, after searching\r\nfuriously through all his creatures, finds God by the way, and kneels\r\nin the dust before him. Verlaine was never a theorist: he left theories\r\nto Mallarm\xc3\xa9. He had only his divination; and he divined that poetry,\r\nalways desiring that miracles should happen, had never waited patiently\r\nenough upon the miracle. It was by that proud and humble mysticism of\r\nhis temperament that he came to realise how much could be done by, In a\r\nsense, trying to do nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd then: _De la musique avant toute chose; De la musique encore et\r\ntoujours!_ There are poems of Verlaine which go as far as verse can\r\ngo to become pure music, the voice of a bird with a human soul. It\r\nis part of his simplicity, his divine childishness, that he abandons\r\nhimself, at times, to the song which words begin to sing in the air,\r\nwith the same wise confidence with which he abandons himself to the\r\nother miracles about him. He knows that words are living things, which\r\nwe have not created, and which go their way without demanding of us\r\nthe right to live. He knows that words are suspicious, not without\r\ntheir malice, and that they resist mere force with the impalpable\r\nresistance of fire or water. They are to be caught only with guile or\r\nwith trust. Verlaine has both, and words become Ariel to him. They\r\nbring him not only that submission of the slave which they bring to\r\nothers, but all the soul, and in a happy bondage. They transform\r\nthemselves for him into music, colour, and shadow; a disembodied music,\r\ndiaphanous colours, luminous shadow. They serve him with so absolute a\r\nself-negation that he can write _romances sans paroles,_ songs almost\r\nwithout words, in which scarcely a sense of the interference of human\r\nspeech remains. The ideal of lyric poetry, certainly, is to be this\r\npassive, flawless medium for the deeper consciousness of things, the\r\nmysterious voice of that mystery which lies about us, out of which we\r\nhave come, and into which we shall return. It is not without reason\r\nthat we cannot analyse a perfect lyric.\r\n\r\nWith Verlaine the sense of hearing and the sense of sight are almost\r\ninterchangeable: he paints with sound, and his line and atmosphere\r\nbecome music. It was with the most precise accuracy that Whistler\r\napplied the terms of music to his painting, for painting, when it aims\r\nat being the vision of reality, _pas la couleur, rien que la nuance,_\r\npasses almost into the condition of music. Verlaine\'s landscape\r\npainting is always an evocation, in which outline is lost in atmosphere.\r\n\r\n    C\'est des beaux yeux derri\xc3\xa8re des voiles,\r\n    C\'est le grand jour tremblant de midi,\r\n    C\'est, par un ciel d\'automne atti\xc3\xa9di,\r\n    Le bleu fouillis des claires \xc3\xa9toiles!\r\n\r\nHe was a man, certainly, "for whom the visible world existed," but for\r\nwhom it existed always as a vision. He absorbed it through all his\r\nsenses, as the true mystic absorbs the divine beauty. And so he created\r\nin verse a new voice for nature, full of the humble ecstasy with which\r\nhe saw, listened, accepted.\r\n\r\n    Cette \xc3\xa2me qui se lamente\r\n    En cette plaine dormante\r\n      C\'est la n\xc3\xb4tre, n\'est-ce pas?\r\n    La mienne, dis, et la tienne,\r\n    Dont s\'exhale l\'humble antienne\r\n      Par ce ti\xc3\xa8de soir, tout has?\r\n\r\nAnd with the same attentive simplicity with which he found words\r\nfor the sensations of hearing and the sensations of sight, he found\r\nwords for the sensations of the soul, for the fine shades of feeling.\r\nFrom the moment when his inner life may be said to have begun, he\r\nwas occupied with the task of an unceasing confession, in which one\r\nseems to overhear him talking to himself, in that vague, preoccupied\r\nway which he often had. Here again are words which startle one by\r\ntheir delicate resemblance to thoughts, by their winged flight from\r\nso far, by their alighting so close. The verse murmurs, with such\r\nan ingenuous confidence, such intimate secrets. That "setting free"\r\nof verse, which is one of the achievements of Verlaine, was itself\r\nmainly an attempt to be more and more sincere, a way of turning poetic\r\nartifice to new account, by getting back to nature itself, hidden away\r\nunder the eloquent rhetoric of Hugo, Baudelaire, and the Parnassians.\r\nIn the devotion of rhetoric to either beauty or truth, there is a\r\ncertain consciousness of an audience, of an external judgment: rhetoric\r\nwould convince, be admired. It is the very essence of poetry to be\r\nunconscious of anything between its own moment of flight and the\r\nsupreme beauty which it will never attain. Verlaine taught French\r\npoetry that wise and subtle unconsciousness. It was in so doing that\r\nhe "fused his personality," in the words of Verhaeren, "so profoundly\r\nwith beauty, that he left upon it the imprint of a new and henceforth\r\neternal attitude."\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n_J\'ai la fureur d\'aimer,_ says Verlaine, in a passage of very personal\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n    J\'ai la fureur d\'aimer. Mon c\xc5\x93ur si faible est fou.\r\n    N\'importe quand, n\'importe quel et n\'importe o\xc3\xb9,\r\n    Qu\'un \xc3\xa9clair de beaut\xc3\xa9, de vertu, de vaillance,\r\n    Luise, il s\'y pr\xc3\xa9cipite, il y vole, il y lance,\r\n    Et, le temps d\'une \xc3\xa9treinte, il embrasse cent fois\r\n    L\'\xc3\xaatre ou l\'objet qu\'il a poursuivi de son choix;\r\n    Puis, quand l\'illusion a repli\xc3\xa9 son aile,\r\n    Il revient triste et seul bien souvent, mais fid\xc3\xa8le,\r\n    Et laissant aux ingrats quelque chose de lui,\r\n    Sang ou chair....\r\n    J\'ai la fureur d\'aimer. Qu\'y faire? Ah, laissez faire!\r\n\r\nAnd certainly this admirable, and supremely dangerous, quality was\r\nat the root of Verlaine\'s nature. Instinctive, unreasoning as he\r\nwas, entirely at the mercy of the emotion or impression which, for\r\nthe moment, had seized upon him, it was inevitable that he should\r\nbe completely at the mercy of the most imperious of instincts, of\r\npassions, and of intoxications. And he had the simple and ardent\r\nnature, in this again consistently childlike, to which love, some kind\r\nof affection, given or returned, is not the luxury, the exception,\r\nwhich it is to many natures, but a daily necessity. To such a\r\ntemperament there may or may not be the one great passion; there\r\nwill certainly be many passions. And in Verlaine I find that single,\r\nchildlike necessity of loving and being loved, all through his life\r\nand on every page of his works; I find it, unchanged in essence, but\r\nconstantly changing form, in his chaste and unchaste devotions to\r\nwomen, in his passionate friendships with men, in his supreme mystical\r\nadoration of God.\r\n\r\nTo turn from _La Bonne Chanson,_ written for a wedding present to a\r\nyoung wife, to _Chansons pour Elle,_ written more than twenty years\r\nlater, in dubious honour of a middle-aged mistress, is to travel a long\r\nroad, the hard, long road which Verlaine had travelled during those\r\nyears. His life was ruinous, a disaster, more sordid perhaps than the\r\nlife of any other poet; and he could write of it, from a hospital-bed,\r\nwith this quite sufficient sense of its deprivations. "But all the\r\nsame, it is hard," he laments, in _Mes H\xc3\xb4pitaux,_ "after a life of\r\nwork, set off, I admit, with accidents in which I have had a large\r\nshare, catastrophes perhaps vaguely premeditated--it is hard, I say, at\r\nforty-seven years of age, in full possession of all the reputation (of\r\nthe _success,_ to use the frightful current phrase) to which my highest\r\nambitions could aspire--hard, hard, hard indeed, worse than hard, to\r\nfind myself--good God!--to find myself _on the streets,_ and to have\r\nnowhere to lay my head and support an ageing body save the pillows and\r\nthe _menus_ of a public charity, even now uncertain, and which might at\r\nany moment be withdrawn--God forbid!--without, apparently, the fault of\r\nany one, oh! not even, and above all, not mine." Yet, after all, these\r\nsordid miseries, this poor man\'s vagabondage, all the misfortunes of\r\none certainly "irreclaimable," on which so much stress has been laid,\r\nalike by friends and by foes, are externalities; they are not the man;\r\nthe man, the eternal lover, passionate and humble, remains unchanged,\r\nwhile only his shadow wanders, from morning to night of the long day.\r\n\r\nThe poems to Rimbaud, to Lucien L\xc3\xa9tinois, to others, the whole volume\r\nof _D\xc3\xa9dicaces,_ cover perhaps as wide a range of sentiment as _La Bonne\r\nChanson_ and _Chansons pour Elle._ The poetry of friendship has never\r\nbeen sung with such plaintive sincerity, such simple human feeling, as\r\nin some of these poems, which can only be compared, in modern poetry,\r\nwith a poem for which Verlaine had a great admiration, Tennyson\'s _In\r\nMemoriam._ Only with Verlaine, the thing itself, the affection or the\r\nregret, is everything; there is no room for meditation over destiny,\r\nor search for a problematical consolation. Other poems speak a more\r\ndifficult language, in which, doubtless, _l\'ennui de vivre avec les\r\ngens et dans les choses_ counts for much, and _la fureur d\'aimer_ for\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the general impression to the contrary, an impression\r\nwhich by no means displeased him himself, I must contend that the\r\nsensuality of Verlaine, brutal as it could sometimes be, was after\r\nall simple rather than complicated, instinctive rather than perverse,\r\nin the poetry of Baudelaire, with which the poetry of Verlaine is so\r\noften compared, there is a deliberate science of sensual perversity\r\nwhich has something almost monachal in its accentuation of vice with\r\nhorror, in its passionate devotion to passions. Baudelaire brings every\r\ncomplication of taste, the exasperation of; perfumes, the irritant of\r\ncruelty, the very odours and colours of corruption, to the creation and\r\nadornment of a sort of religion, in which an eternal mass is served\r\nbefore a veiled altar. There is no confession, no absolution, not a\r\nprayer is permitted which is not set down in the ritual. With Verlaine,\r\nhowever often love may pass into sensuality, to whatever length\r\nsensuality may be hurried, sensuality is never more than the malady\r\nof love. It is love desiring the absolute, seeking in vain, seeking\r\nalways, and, finally, out of the depths, finding God.\r\n\r\nVerlaine\'s conversion took place while he was in prison, during those\r\nsolitary eighteen months in company with his thoughts, that enforced\r\nphysical inactivity, which could but concentrate his whole energy on\r\nthe only kind of sensation then within his capacity, the sensations of\r\nthe soul and of the conscience. With that promptitude of abandonment\r\nwhich was his genius, he grasped feverishly at the succour of God and\r\nthe Church, he abased himself before the immaculate purity of the\r\nVirgin. He had not, like others who have risen from the same depths to\r\nthe same height of humiliation, to despoil his nature of its pride, to\r\nconquer his intellect, before he could become _l\'enfant v\xc3\xaatu de laine\r\net d\'innocence._ All that was simple, humble, childlike in him accepted\r\nthat humiliation with the loving child\'s joy in penitence; all that was\r\nardent, impulsive, indomitable in him burst at once into a flame of\r\nadoration.\r\n\r\nHe realised the great secret of the Christian mystics: that it is\r\npossible to love God with an extravagance of the whole being, to which\r\nthe love of the creature cannot attain. All love is an attempt to break\r\nthrough the loneliness of individuality, to fuse oneself with something\r\nnot oneself, to give and to receive, in all the warmth of natural\r\ndesire, that inmost element which remains, so cold and so invincible,\r\nin the midst of the soul. It is a desire of the infinite in humanity,\r\nand, as humanity has its limits, it can but return sadly upon itself\r\nwhen that limit is reached. Thus human love is not only an ecstasy but\r\na despair, and the more profound a despair the more ardently it is\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nBut the love of God, considered only from its human aspect, contains at\r\nleast the illusion of infinity. To love God is to love the absolute,\r\nso far as the mind of man can conceive the absolute, and thus, in a\r\nsense, to love God is to possess the absolute, for love has already\r\npossessed that which it apprehends. What the earthly lover realises to\r\nhimself as the image of his beloved is, after all, his own vision of\r\nlove, not her. God must remain _deus absconditus,_ even to love; but\r\nthe lover, incapable of possessing infinity, will have possessed all\r\nof infinity of which he is capable. And his ecstasy will be flawless.\r\nThe human mind, meditating on infinity, can but discover perfection\r\nbeyond perfection; for it is impossible to conceive of limitation in\r\nany aspect of that which has once been conceived as infinite. In place\r\nof that deception which comes from the shock of a boundary-line beyond\r\nwhich humanity cannot conceive of humanity, there is only a divine rage\r\nagainst the limits of human perception, which by their own failure\r\nseem at last to limit for us the infinite itself. For once, love finds\r\nitself bounded only by its own capacity; so far does the love of God\r\nexceed the love of the creature, and so far would it exceed that love\r\nif God did not exist.\r\n\r\nBut if He does exist! if, outside humanity, a conscient, eternal\r\nperfection, who has made the world in his image, loves the humanity He\r\nhas made, and demands love in return! If the spirit of his love is as\r\na breath over the world, suggesting, strengthening, the love which it\r\ndesires, seeking man that man may seek God, itself the impulse which it\r\nhumbles itself to accept at man\'s hands; if indeed,\r\n\r\n    Mon Dieu m\'a dit: mon fils, il faut m\'aimer;\r\n\r\nhow much more is this love of God, in its inconceivable acceptance\r\nand exchange, the most divine, the only unending intoxication, in\r\nthe world! Well, it is this realised sense of communion, point by\r\npoint realised, and put into words, more simple, more human, more\r\ninstinctive than any poet since the medi\xc3\xa6val mystics has found for the\r\ndelights of this intercourse, that we find in _Sagesse,_ and in the\r\nother religious poems of Verlaine.\r\n\r\nBut, with Verlaine, the love of God is not merely a rapture, it is\r\na thanksgiving for forgiveness. Lying in wait behind all the fair\r\nappearances of the world, he remembers the old enemy, the flesh; and\r\nthe sense of sin (that strange paradox of the reason) is childishly\r\nstrong in him. He laments his offence, he sees not only the love but\r\nthe justice of God, and it seems to him, as in a picture, that the\r\nlittle hands of the Virgin are clasped in petition for him. Verlaine\'s\r\nreligion is the religion of the Middle Ages. _Je suis catholique,_ he\r\nsaid to me, _mais ... catholique du moyen-\xc3\xa2ge!_ He might have written\r\nthe ballad which Villon made for his mother, and with the same visual\r\nsense of heaven and hell. Like a child, he tells his sins over,\r\npromises that he has put them behind him, and finds such _na\xc3\xafve,_ human\r\nwords to express his gratitude. The Virgin is really, to him, mother\r\nand friend; he delights in the simple, peasant humanity, still visible\r\nin her who is also the Mystical Rose, the Tower of Ivory, the Gate of\r\nHeaven, and who now extends her hands, in the gesture of pardon, from a\r\nthrone only just lower than the throne of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nExperience, I have said, taught Verlaine nothing; religion had no more\r\nstable influence upon his conduct then experience. In that apology for\r\nhimself which he wrote under the anagram of "Pauvre Lelian," he has\r\nstated the case with his usual sincerity. "I believe," he says, "and I\r\nsin in thought as in action; I believe, and I repent in thought, if no\r\nmore. Or again, I believe, and I am a good Christian at this moment; I\r\nbelieve, and I am a bad Christian the instant after. The remembrance,\r\nthe hope, the invocation of a sin delights me, with or without remorse,\r\nsometimes under the very form of sin, and hedged with all its natural\r\nconsequences; more often--so strong, so natural and _animal,_ are\r\nflesh and blood--just in the same manner as the remembrances, hopes,\r\ninvocations of any carnal freethinker. This delight, I, you, some one\r\nelse, writers, it pleases us to put to paper and publish more or less\r\nwell expressed: we consign it, in short, into literary form, forgetting\r\nall religious ideas, or not letting one of them escape us. Can any one\r\nin good faith condemn us as poet? A hundred times no." And, indeed, I\r\nwould echo, a hundred times no! It is just this apparent complication\r\nof what is really a great simplicity which gives its singular value to\r\nthe poetry of Verlaine, permitting it to sum up in itself the whole\r\nparadox of humanity, and especially the weak, passionate, uncertain,\r\ntroubled century to which we belong, in which so many doubts,\r\nnegations, and distresses seem, now more than ever, to be struggling\r\ntowards at least an ideal of spiritual consolation. Verlaine is the\r\npoet of these weaknesses and of that ideal.\r\n\r\n[_See also account given in "Bibliography and Notes" page_ 351.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. JORIS-KARL HUYSMANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe novels of Huysmans, however we may regard them as novels,\r\nare, at all events, the sincere and complete expression of a very\r\nremarkable personality. From _Marthe_ to _L\xc3\xa0-Bas_ every story, every\r\nvolume, disengages the same atmosphere--the atmosphere of a London\r\nNovember, when mere existence is a sufficient burden, and the little\r\nmiseries of life loom up through the fog into a vague and formidable\r\ngrotesqueness. Here, for once, is a pessimist whose philosophy is\r\nmere sensation--and sensation, after all, is the one certainty in\r\na world which may be well or ill arranged, for ultimate purposes,\r\nbut which is certainly, for each of us, what each of us feels it to\r\nbe. To Huysmans the world appears to be a profoundly uncomfortable,\r\nunpleasant, ridiculous place, with a certain solace in various forms\r\nof art, and certain possibilities of at least temporary escape. Part\r\nof his work presents to us a picture of ordinary life as he conceives\r\nit, in its uniform trivial wretchedness; in another part he has\r\nmade experiment in directions which have seemed to promise escape,\r\nrelief; in yet other portions he has allowed himself the delight of\r\nhis sole enthusiasm, the enthusiasm of art. He himself would be the\r\nfirst to acknowledge--indeed, practically, he has acknowledged that\r\nthe particular way in which he sees life is a matter of personal\r\ntemperament and constitution, a matter of nerves. The Goncourts have\r\nnever tired of insisting on the fact of their _n\xc3\xa9vrose,_ of pointing\r\nout its importance in connection with the form and structure of their\r\nwork, their touch on style, even. To them the _maladie fin de si\xc3\xa8cle_\r\nhas come delicately, as to the chlorotic fine ladies of the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Germain: it has sharpened their senses to a point of morbid\r\nacuteness, it has given their work a certain feverish beauty. To\r\nHuysmans it has given the exaggerated horror of whatever is ugly and\r\nunpleasant, with the fatal instinct of discovering, the fatal necessity\r\nof contemplating, every flaw and every discomfort that a somewhat\r\nimperfect world can offer for inspection. It is the transposition\r\nof the ideal. Relative values are lost, for it is the sense of the\r\ndisagreeable only that is heightened; and the world, in this strange\r\ndisorder of vision, assumes an aspect which can only be compared with\r\nthat of a drop of impure water under the microscope. "Nature seen\r\nthrough a temperament" is Zola\'s definition of all art. Nothing,\r\ncertainly, could be more exact and expressive as a definition of the\r\nart of Huysmans.\r\n\r\nTo realise how faithfully and how completely Huysmans has revealed\r\nhimself in all he has written, it is necessary to know the man. "He\r\ngave me the impression of a cat," some interviewer once wrote of him;\r\n"courteous, perfectly polite, almost amiable, but all nerves, ready to\r\nshoot out his claws at the least word." And indeed, there is something\r\nof his favourite animal about him. The face is grey, wearily alert,\r\nwith a look of benevolent malice. At first sight it is commonplace,\r\nthe features are ordinary, one seems to have seen it at the Bourse or\r\nthe Stock Exchange. But gradually that strange, unvarying expression,\r\nthat look of benevolent malice, grows upon you as the influence of the\r\nman makes itself felt. I have seen Huysmans in his office--he is an\r\nemploy\xc3\xa9 in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a model employ\xc3\xa9; I have\r\nseen him in a caf\xc3\xa9, in various houses; but I always see him in memory\r\nas I used to see him at the house of the bizarre Madame X. He leans\r\nback on the sofa, rolling a cigarette between his thin, expressive\r\nfingers, looking at no one and at nothing, while Madame X moves about\r\nwith solid vivacity in the midst of her extraordinary menagerie of\r\n_bric-\xc3\xa0-brac._ The spoils of all the world are there, in that ncredibly\r\ntiny _salon;_ they lie underfoot, they climb up walls, they cling to\r\nscreens, brackets, and tables; one of your elbows menaces a Japanese\r\ntoy, the other a Dresden china shepherdess; all the colours of the\r\nrainbow clash in a barbaric discord of notes. And in a corner of this\r\nfantastic room, Huysmans lies back indifferently on the sofa, with the\r\nair of one perfectly resigned to the boredom of life. Something is\r\nsaid by my learned friend who is to write for the new periodical, or\r\nperhaps it is the young editor of the new periodical who speaks, or\r\n(if that were not impossible) the taciturn Englishman who accompanies\r\nme; and Huysmans, without looking up, and without taking the trouble\r\nto speak very distinctly, picks up the phrase, transforms it, more\r\nlikely transpierces it, in a perfectly turned sentence, a phrase of\r\nimpromptu elaboration. Perhaps it is only a stupid book that some one\r\nhas mentioned, or a stupid woman; as he speaks, the book looms up\r\nbefore one, becomes monstrous in its dulness, a masterpiece and miracle\r\nof imbecility; the unimportant little woman grows into a slow horror\r\nbefore your eyes. It is always the unpleasant aspect of things that he\r\nseizes, but the intensity of his revolt from that unpleasantness brings\r\na touch of the sublime into the very expression of his disgust. Every\r\nsentence is an epigram, and every epigram slaughters a reputation or an\r\nidea. He speaks with an accent as of pained surprise, an amused look of\r\ncontempt, so profound that it becomes almost pity, for human inbecility.\r\n\r\nYes, that is the true Huysmans, the Huysmans of _A Rebours,_ and it is\r\njust such surroundings that seem to bring out his peculiar quality.\r\nWith this contempt for humanity, this hatred of mediocrity, this\r\npassion for a somewhat exotic kind of modernity, an artist who is so\r\nexclusively an artist was sure, one day or another, to produce a work\r\nwhich, being produced to please himself, and being entirely typical\r\nof himself, would be, in a way, the quintessence of contemporary\r\nDecadence. And it is precisely such a book that Huysmans has written,\r\nin the extravagant, astonishing _A Rebours._ All his other books\r\nare a sort of unconscious preparation for this one book, a sort of\r\ninevitable and scarcely necessary sequel to it. They range themselves\r\nalong the line of a somewhat erratic development, from Baudelaire,\r\nthrough Goncourt, by way of Zola, to the surprising originality of so\r\ndisconcerting an exception to any and every order of things.\r\n\r\nThe descendant of a long line of Dutch painters--one of whom, Cornelius\r\nHuysmans, has a certain fame among the lesser landscape men of the\r\ngreat period--Joris-Karl Huysmans was born at Paris, February 5, 1848.\r\nHis first book, _Le Drageoir \xc3\xa0 Epices,_ published at the age of\r\ntwenty-six, is a _pasticcio_ of prose poems, done after Baudelaire, of\r\nlittle sketches, done after Dutch artists, together with a few studies\r\nof Parisian landscape, done after nature. It shows us the careful,\r\nlaboured work of a really artistic temperament; it betrays here and\r\nthere, the spirit of acrimonious observation which is to count for so\r\nmuch with Huysmans--in the crude malice of _L\'Extase,_ for example, in\r\nthe notation of the "richness of tone," the "superb colouring," of an\r\nold drunkard. And one sees already something of the novelty and the\r\nprecision of his description, the novelty and the unpleasantness of the\r\nsubjects which he chooses to describe, in this vividly exact picture\r\nof the carcass of a cow hung up outside a butcher\'s shop: "As in a\r\nhothouse, a marvellous vegetation flourished in the carcass. Veins shot\r\nout on every side like trails of bind-weed; dishevelled branch-work\r\nextended itself along the body, an efflorescence of entrails unfurled\r\ntheir violet-tinted corollas, and big clusters of fat stood out, a\r\nsharp white, against the red medley of quivering flesh."\r\n\r\nIn _Marthe: histoire d\'une fille,_ which followed in 1876, two years\r\nlater, Huysmans is almost as far from actual achievement as in _Le\r\nDrageoir \xc3\xa0 Epices,_ but the book, in its crude attempt to deal\r\nrealistically, and somewhat after the manner of Goncourt, with the life\r\nof a prostitute of the lowest depths, marks a considerable advance upon\r\nthe somewhat casual experiments of his earlier manner. It is important\r\nto remember that _Marthe_ preceded _La Fille \xc3\x89lisa_ and _Nana._ "I\r\nwrite what I see, what I feel, and what I have experienced," says the\r\nbrief and defiant preface, "and I write it as well as I can: that is\r\nall. This explanation is not an excuse, it is simply the statement of\r\nthe aim that I pursue in art." Explanation or excuse notwithstanding,\r\nthe book was forbidden to be sold in France. It is Naturalism in its\r\nearliest and most pitiless stage--Naturalism which commits the error\r\nof evoking no sort of interest in this unhappy creature who rises a\r\nlittle from her native gutter, only to fall back more woefully into the\r\ngutter again. Goncourt\'s \xc3\x89lisa at least interests us; Zola\'s Nana at\r\nall events appeals to our senses. But Marthe is a mere document, like\r\nher story. Notes have been taken--no doubt _sur le vif_--they have been\r\nstrung together, and here they are with only an interesting brutality,\r\na curious sordidness to note, in these descriptions that do duty for\r\npsychology and incident alike, in the general flatness of character,\r\nthe general dislocation of episode.\r\n\r\n_Les S\xc5\x93urs Vatard,_ published in 1879, and the short story _Sac au\r\nDos,_ which appeared in 1880 in the famous Zolaist manifesto, _Les\r\nSoir\xc3\xa9es de M\xc3\xa9dan,_ show the influence of _Les Rougon-Macquart_ rather\r\nthan of _Germinie Lacerteux._ For the time the "formula" of Zola\r\nhas been accepted: the result is, a remarkable piece of work, but a\r\nstory without a story, a frame without a picture. With Zola, there\r\nis at all events a beginning and an end, a chain of events, a play\r\nof character upon incident. But in _Les S\xc5\x93urs Vatard_ there is no\r\nreason for the narrative ever beginning or ending; there are miracles\r\nof description--the workroom, the rue de S\xc3\xa8vres, the locomotives, the\r\n_Foire du pain d\'\xc3\xa9pice_--which lead to nothing; there are interiors,\r\nthere are interviews, there are the two work-girls, C\xc3\xa9line and D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e,\r\nand their lovers; there is what Zola himself described as _tout\r\nce milieu ouvrier, ce coin de mis\xc3\xa8re et d\'ignorance, de tranquille\r\nordure et d\'air naturellement empest\xc3\xa9._ And with it all there is a\r\nheavy sense of stagnancy, a dreary lifelessness. All that is good in\r\nthe book reappears, in vastly better company, in _En M\xc3\xa9nage_ (1881),\r\na novel which is, perhaps, more in the direct line of heritage from\r\n_L\'Education Sentimentale_--the starting-point of the Naturalistic\r\nnovel--than any other novel of the Naturalists.\r\n\r\n_En M\xc3\xa9nage_ is the story of _"Monsieur Tout-le-monde,_ an insignificant\r\npersonality, one of those poor creatures who have not even the\r\nsupreme consolation of being able to complain of any injustice in\r\ntheir fate, for an injustice supposes at all events a misunderstood\r\nmerit, a force." Andr\xc3\xa9 is the reduction to the bourgeois formula of\r\nthe invariable hero of Huysmans. He is just enough removed from the\r\ncommonplace to suffer from it with acuteness. He cannot get on either\r\nwith or without a woman in his establishment. Betrayed by his wife, he\r\nconsoles himself with a mistress, and finally goes back to the wife.\r\nAnd the moral of it all is: "Let us be stupidly comfortable, if we\r\ncan, in any way we can: but it is almost certain that we cannot." In\r\n_A Vau-l\'Eau,_ a less interesting story which followed _En M\xc3\xa9nage,_\r\nthe daily misery of the respectable M. Folantin, the government\r\nemploy\xc3\xa9, consists in the impossible search for a decent restaurant,\r\na satisfactory dinner: for M. Folantin, too, there is only the same\r\ncounsel of a desperate, an inevitable resignation. Never has the\r\nintolerable monotony of small inconveniences been so scrupulously, so\r\nunsparingly chronicled, as in these two studies in the heroic degree\r\nof the commonplace. It happens to Andr\xc3\xa9, at a certain epoch in his\r\nlife, to take back an old servant who had left him many years before.\r\nHe finds that she has exactly the same defects as before, and "to find\r\nthem there again," comments the author, "did not displease him. He had\r\nbeen expecting them all the time, he saluted them as old acquaintances,\r\nyet with a certain surprise, notwithstanding, to see them neither\r\ngrown nor diminished. He noted for himself with satisfaction that\r\nthe stupidity of his servant had remained stationary." On another\r\npage, referring to the inventor of cards, Huysmans defines him as one\r\nwho "did something towards suppressing the free exchange of human\r\nimbecility." Having to say in passing that a girl has returned from a\r\nball, "she was at home again," he observes, "after the half-dried sweat\r\nof the waltzes." In this invariably sarcastic turn of the phrase, this\r\nabsoluteness of contempt, this insistence on the disagreeable, we find\r\nthe note of Huysmans, particularly at this point in his career, when,\r\nlike Flaubert, he forced himself to contemplate and to analyse the more\r\nmediocre manifestations of _la b\xc3\xaatise humaine._\r\n\r\nThere is a certain perversity in this furious contemplation of\r\nstupidity, this fanatical insistence on the exasperating attraction of\r\nthe sordid and the disagreeable; and it is by such stages that we come\r\nto _A Rebours._ But on the way we have to note a volume of _Croquis\r\nParisiens_ (1880), in which the virtuoso who is a part of the artist\r\nin Huysmans has executed some of his most astonishing feats; and a\r\nvolume on L\'_Art Moderne_ (1883), in which the most modern of artists\r\nin literature has applied himself to the criticism--the revelation,\r\nrather--of modernity in art. In the latter, Huysmans was the first\r\nto declare the supremacy of Degas--"the greatest artist that we\r\npossess to-day in France"--while announcing with no less fervour the\r\nremote, reactionary, and intricate genius of Gustave Moreau. He was\r\nthe first to discover Raffa\xc3\xablli, "the painter of poor people and the\r\nopen sky--a sort of Parisian Millet," as he called him; the first to\r\ndiscover Forain, _"le v\xc3\xa9ritable peintre de la fille"_; the first to\r\ndiscover Odilon Redon, to do justice to Pissaro and Paul Gauguin. No\r\nliterary artist since Baudelaire has made so valuable a contribution\r\nto art criticism, and the _Curiosit\xc3\xa9s Esth\xc3\xa9tiques_ are, after all,\r\nless exact in their actual study, less revolutionary, and less really\r\nsignificant in their critical judgments, than L\'_Art Moderne._ The\r\n_Croquis Parisiens,_ which, in its first edition, was illustrated\r\nby etchings of Forain and Raffa\xc3\xablli, is simply the attempt to do in\r\nwords what those artists have done in aquafortis or in pastel. There\r\nare the same Parisian types--the omnibus-conductor, the washerwoman,\r\nthe man who sells hot chestnuts--the same impressions of a sick and\r\nsorry landscape, La Bi\xc3\xa8vre, for preference, in all its desolate and\r\nlamentable attraction; there is a marvellously minute series of\r\nstudies of that typically Parisian music-hall, the Folies-Berg\xc3\xa8re.\r\nHuysmans\' faculty of description is here seen at its fullest stretch of\r\nagility; precise, suggestive, with all the outline and colour of actual\r\nbrush-work, it might even be compared with the art of Degas, only there\r\nis just that last touch wanting, that breath of palpitating life, which\r\nis what we always get in Degas, what we never get in Huysmans.\r\n\r\nIn _L\'Art Moderne,_ speaking of the water-colours of Forain, Huysmans\r\nattributes to them "a specious and _cherch\xc3\xa9_ art, demanding, for its\r\nappreciation, a certain initiation, a certain special sense." To\r\nrealise the full value, the real charm, of _A Rebours,_ some such\r\ninitiation might be deemed necessary. In its fantastic unreality, its\r\nexquisite artificiality, it is the natural sequel of _En M\xc3\xa9nage_ and\r\n_A Vau-l\'Eau,_ which are so much more acutely sordid than the most\r\nsordid kind of real life; it is the logical outcome of that hatred\r\nand horror of human mediocrity, of the mediocrity of daily existence,\r\nwhich we have seen to be the special form of Huysmans\' _n\xc3\xa9vrose._ The\r\nmotto, taken from a thirteenth-century mystic, Ruysbroeck the Admirable,\r\nis a cry for escape, for the "something in the world that is there in\r\nno satisfying measure, or not at all": _Il faut que je me r\xc3\xa9jouisse\r\nau-dessus du temps ... quoique le monde ait horreur de ma joie et\r\nque sa grossi\xc3\xa8ret\xc3\xa9 ne sache pas ce que je veux dire._ And the book\r\nis the history of a _Theba\xc3\xafde raffin\xc3\xa9e_--a voluntary exile from the\r\nworld in a new kind of "Palace of Art." Des Esseintes, the vague but\r\ntypical hero, is one of those half-pathological cases which help us to\r\nunderstand the full meaning of the word _d\xc3\xa9cadence,_ which they partly\r\nrepresent. The last descendant of an ancient family, his impoverished\r\nblood tainted by all sorts of excesses, Des Esseintes finds himself\r\nat thirty _sur le chemin, d\xc3\xa9gris\xc3\xa9, seul, abominablement lass\xc3\xa9._ He\r\nhas already realised that "the world is divided, in great part, into\r\nswaggerers and simpletons." His one desire is to "hide himself away,\r\nfar from the world, in some retreat, where he might deaden the sound\r\nof the loud rumbling of inflexible life, as one covers the street with\r\nstraw, for sick people." This retreat he discovers, just far enough\r\nfrom Paris to be safe from disturbance, just near enough to be saved\r\nfrom the nostalgia of the unattainable. He succeeds in making his house\r\na paradise of the artificial, choosing the tones of colour that go\r\nbest with candle-light, for it need scarcely be said that Des Esseintes\r\nhas effected a simple transposition of night and day. His disappearance\r\nfrom the world has been complete; it seems to him that the "comfortable\r\ndesert" of his exile need never cease to be just such a luxurious\r\nsolitude; it seems to him that he has attained his desire, that he has\r\nattained to happiness.\r\n\r\nDisturbing physical symptoms harass him from time to time, but they\r\npass. It is an effect of nerves that now and again he is haunted by\r\nremembrance; the recurrence of a perfume, the reading of a book, brings\r\nback a period of life when his deliberate perversity was exercised\r\nactively in matters of the senses. There are his fantastic banquets,\r\nhis fantastic amours: the _repas de deuil,_ Miss Urania the acrobat,\r\nthe episode of the ventriloquist-woman and the reincarnation of the\r\nSphinx and the Chim\xc3\xa6ra of Flaubert, the episode of the boy _chez_\r\nMadame Laure. A casual recollection brings up the schooldays of his\r\nchildhood with the Jesuits, and with that the beliefs of childhood,\r\nthe fantasies of the Church, the Catholic abnegation of the _Imitatio_\r\njoining so strangely with the final philosophy of Schopenhauer.\r\nAt times his brain is haunted by social theories--his dull hatred\r\nof the ordinary in life taking form in the region of ideas. But in\r\nthe main he feeds himself, with something of the satisfaction of\r\nsuccess, on the strange food for the sensations with which he has so\r\nlaboriously furnished himself. There are his books, and among these a\r\nspecial library of the Latin writers of the Decadence. Exasperated by\r\nVirgil, profoundly contemptuous of Horace, he tolerates Lucan (which\r\nis surprising), adores Petronius (as well he might), and delights\r\nin the neologisms and the exotic novelty of Apuleius. His curiosity\r\nextends to the later Christian poets--from the coloured verse of\r\nClaudian down to the verse which is scarcely verse of the incoherent\r\nninth century. He is, of course, an amateur of exquisite printing, of\r\nbeautiful bindings, and possesses an incomparable Baudelaire _(\xc3\xa9dition\r\ntir\xc3\xa9e \xc3\xa0 un exemplaire),_ a unique Mallarm\xc3\xa9. Catholicism being the\r\nadopted religion of the Decadence--for its venerable age, valuable in\r\nsuch matters as the age of an old wine, its vague excitation of the\r\nsenses, its mystical picturesqueness--Des Esseintes has a curious\r\ncollection of the later Catholic literature, where Lacordaire and\r\nthe Comte de Falloux, Veuillot and Ozanam, find their place side by\r\nside with the half-prophetic, half-ingenious Hello, the amalgam of a\r\nmonstrous mysticism and a casuistical sensuality, Barbey d\'Aurevilly.\r\nHis collection of "profane" writers is small, but it is selected for\r\nthe qualities of exotic charm that have come to be his only care in\r\nart--for the somewhat diseased, or the somewhat artificial beauty\r\nthat alone can strike, a responsive thrill from his exacting nerves.\r\n"Considering within himself, he realised that a work of art, in order\r\nto attract him, must come to him with that quality of strangeness\r\ndemanded by Edgar Poe; but he fared yet further along this route,\r\nand sought for all the Byzantine flora of the brain, for complicated\r\ndeliquescences of style; he required a troubling indecision over which\r\nhe could muse, fashioning it after his will to more of vagueness or\r\nof solid form, according to the state of his mind at the moment. He\r\ndelighted in a work of art both for what it was in itself and for\r\nwhat it could lend him; he would fain go along with it, thanks to it,\r\nas though sustained by an adjuvant, as though borne in a vehicle,\r\ninto a sphere where his sublimated sensations would wake in him an\r\nunaccustomed stir, the cause of which he would long and vainly seek\r\nto determine." So he comes to care supremely for Baudelaire, "who,\r\nmore than any other, possessed the marvellous power of rendering,\r\nwith a strange sanity of expression, the most fleeting, the most\r\nwavering morbid states of exhausted minds, of desolate souls." In\r\nFlaubert he prefers _La Tentation de Saint-Antoine;_ in Goncourt, _La\r\nFaustin;_ in Zola, _La Faute de l\'Abb\xc3\xa9 Mouret-_ the exceptional, the\r\nmost remote and _recherch\xc3\xa9_ outcome of each temperament. And of the\r\nthree it is the novel of Goncourt that appeals to him with special\r\nintimacy--that novel which, more than any other, seems to express, in\r\nits exquisitely perverse charm, all that decadent civilisation of which\r\nDes Esseintes is the type and symbol. In poetry he has discovered the\r\nfine perfume, the evanescent charm, of Paul Verlaine, and near that\r\ngreat poet (forgetting, strangely, Arthur Rimbaud) he places two poets\r\nwho are curious--the disconcerting, tumultuous Tristan Corbi\xc3\xa8re, and\r\nthe painted and bejewelled Th\xc3\xa9odore Hannon. With Edgar Poe he has\r\nthe instinctive sympathy which drew Baudelaire to the enigmatically\r\nperverse Decadent of America; he delights, sooner than all the world,\r\nin the astonishing, unbalanced, unachieved genius of Villiers de\r\nl\'Isle-Adam. Finally, it is in St\xc3\xa9phane Mallarm\xc3\xa9 that he finds the\r\nincarnation of "the decadence of a literature, irreparably affected in\r\nits organism, weakened in its ideas by age, exhausted by the excesses\r\nof syntax, sensitive only to the curiosity which fevers sick people,\r\nand yet hastening to say everything, now at the end, torn by the wish\r\n_to_ atone for all its omissions of enjoyment, to bequeath its subtlest\r\nmemories of sorrow on its death-bed."\r\n\r\nBut it is not on books alone that Des Esseintes nurses his sick and\r\ncraving fancy. He pushes his delight in the artificial to the last\r\nlimits, and diverts himself with a bouquet of jewels, a concert of\r\nflowers, an orchestra of liqueurs, an orchestra of perfumes. In flowers\r\nhe prefers the real flowers that imitate artificial ones. It is the\r\nmonstrosities of nature, the offspring of unnatural adulteries, that\r\nhe cherishes in the barbarically coloured flowers, the plants with\r\nbarbaric names, the carnivorous plants of the Antilles--morbid horrors\r\nof vegetation, chosen, not for their beauty, but for their strangeness.\r\nAnd his imagination plays harmonies on the sense of taste, like\r\ncombinations of music, from the flute-like sweetness of anisette, the\r\ntrumpet-note of kirsch, the eager yet velvety sharpness of cura\xc3\xa7ao, the\r\nclarionet. He combines scents, weaving them into odorous melodies, with\r\neffects like those of the refrains of certain poems, employing, for\r\nexample, the method of Baudelaire in _L\'Irr\xc3\xa9parable_ and _Le Balcon,_\r\nwhere the last line of the stanza is the echo of the first, in the\r\nlanguorous progression of the melody. And above all he has his few,\r\ncarefully chosen pictures, with their diverse notes of strange beauty\r\nand strange terror--the two Salom\xc3\xa9s of Gustave Moreau, the "Religious\r\nPersecutions" of Jan Luyken, the opium-dreams of Odilon Redon. His\r\nfavourite artist is Gustave Moreau, and it is on this superb and\r\ndisquieting picture that he cares chiefly to dwell.\r\n\r\nA throne, like the high altar of a cathedral, rose beneath innumerable\r\narches springing from columns, thick-set as Roman pillars, enamelled\r\nwith vari-coloured bricks, set with mosaics, incrusted with lapis\r\nlazuli and sardonyx, In a palace like the basilica of an architecture\r\nat once Mussulman and Byzantine. In the centre of the tabernacle\r\nsurmounting the altar, fronted with rows of circular steps, sat the\r\nTetrarch Herod, the tiara on his head, his legs pressed together, his\r\nhands on his knees. His face was yellow, parchment-like, annulated\r\nwith wrinkles, withered with age; his long beard floated like a white\r\ncloud on the jewelled stars that constellated the robe of netted old\r\nacross his breast. Around this statue, motionless, frozen in the\r\nsacred pose of a Hindu god, perfumes burned, throwing out clouds of\r\nvapour, pierced, as by the phosphorescent eyes of animals, by the fire\r\nof precious stones set in the sides of the throne; then the vapour\r\nmounted, unrolling itself beneath arches where the blue smoke mingled\r\nwith the powdered gold of great sunrays, fallen jrom the domes.\r\n\r\nIn the perverse odour of perfumes, in the overheated atmosphere of this\r\nchurch, Salom\xc3\xa9, her left arm extended in a gesture of command, her bent\r\nright arm holding at the level of the face a great lotus, advances\r\nslowly to the sound of a guitar, thrummed by a woman who crouches on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nWith collected, solemn, almost august countenance, she begins the\r\nlascivious dance that should waken the sleeping senses of the aged\r\nHerod; her breasts undulate, become rigid at the contact of the\r\nwhirling necklets; diamonds sparkle on the dead whiteness of her skin,\r\nher bracelets, girdles, rings, shoot sparks; on her triumphal robe,\r\nsewn with pearls, flowered with silver, sheeted with gold, the jewelled\r\nbreastplate, whose every stitch is a precious stone, bursts into flame,\r\nscatters in snakes of fire, swarms on the ivory-toned, tea-rose flesh,\r\nlike splendid insects with dazzling wings, marbled with carmine,\r\ndotted with morning gold, diapered with steel-blue, streaked with\r\npeacock-green. . . . . . . . . In the work of Gustave Moreau, conceived\r\non no Scriptural data, Des Esseintes saw at last the realisation of the\r\nstrange, superhuman Salom\xc3\xa9 that he had dreamed. She was no more the\r\nmere dancing-girl who, with the corrupt torsion of her limbs, tears\r\na cry of desire from an old man; who, with her eddying breasts, her\r\npalpitating body, her quivering thighs, breaks the energy, melts the\r\nwill, of a king; she has become the symbolic deity of indestructible\r\nLust, the goddess of immortal Hysteria, the accursed Beauty, chosen\r\namong, many by the catalepsy that has stiffened her limbs, that has\r\nhardened her muscles; the monstrous, indifferent, irresponsible,\r\ninsensible Beast, poisoning, like Helen of old, all that go near to\r\nher, all that look upon her, all that she touches.\r\n\r\nIt is in such a "Palace of Art" that Des Esseintes would recreate his\r\nalready over-wrought body and brain, and the monotony of its seclusion\r\nis only once broken by a single excursion into the world without. This\r\none episode of action, this one touch of realism in a book given over\r\nto the artificial, confined to a record of sensation, is a projected\r\nvoyage to London, a voyage that never occurs. Des Esseintes has been\r\nreading Dickens, idly, to quiet his nerves, and the violent colours\r\nof those ultra-British scenes and characters have imposed themselves\r\nupon his imagination. Days of rain and fog complete the picture of\r\nthat _pays de brume et de bone,_ and suddenly, stung by the unwonted\r\ndesire for change, he takes the train to Paris, resolved to distract\r\nhimself by a visit to London. Arrived in Paris before his time, he\r\ntakes a cab to the office of _Galignani\'s Messenger,_ fancying himself,\r\nas the rain-drops rattle on the roof and the mud splashes against the\r\nwindows, already in the midst of the immense city, its smoke and dirt.\r\nHe reaches _Galignani\'s Messenger,_ and there, turning over Baedekers\r\nand Mur-rays, loses himself in dreams of an imagined London. He buys a\r\nBaedeker, and, to pass the time, enters the "Bod\xc3\xa9ga" at the corner of\r\nthe Rue de Rivoli and the Rue Castiglione. The wine-cellar is crowded\r\nwith Englishmen: he sees, as he drinks his port, and listens to the\r\nunfamiliar accents, all the characters of Dickens--a whole England\r\nof caricature; as he drinks his Amontillado, the recollection of Poe\r\nputs a new horror into the good-humoured faces about him. Leaving the\r\n"Bod\xc3\xa9ga," he steps out again into the rain-swept street, regains his\r\ncab, and drives to the English tavern of the Rue d\'Amsterdam. He has\r\njust time for dinner, and he finds a place beside the _insulaires,_\r\nwith "their porcelain eyes, their crimson cheeks," and orders a heavy\r\nEnglish dinner, which he washes down with ale and porter, seasoning\r\nhis coffee, as he imagines we do in England, with gin. As time passes,\r\nand the hour of the train draws near, he begins to reflect vaguely on\r\nhis project; he recalls the disillusion of the visit he had once paid\r\nto Holland. Does not a similar disillusion await him in London? "Why\r\ntravel, when one can travel so splendidly in a chair? Was he not at\r\nLondon already, since its odours, its atmosphere, its inhabitants, its\r\nfood, its utensils, were all about him?" The train is due, but he does\r\nnot stir. "I have felt and seen," he says to himself, "what I wanted\r\nto feel and see. I have been saturated with English life all this\r\ntime; it would be madness to lose, by a clumsy change of place, these\r\nimperishable sensations." So he gathers together his luggage, and goes\r\nhome again, resolving never to abandon the "docile phantasmagoria of\r\nthe brain" for the mere realities of the actual world. But his nervous\r\nmalady, one of whose symptoms had driven him forth and brought him back\r\nso spasmodically, is on the increase. He is seized by hallucinations,\r\nhaunted by sounds: the hysteria of Schumann, the morbid exaltation of\r\nBerlioz, communicate themselves to him in the music that besieges his\r\nbrain. Obliged at last to send for a doctor, we find him, at the end\r\nof the book, ordered back to Paris, to the normal life, the normal\r\nconditions, with just that chance of escape from death or madness.\r\nSo suggestively, so instructively, closes the record of a strange,\r\nattractive folly--in itself partly a serious ideal (which indeed is\r\nHuysmans\' own), partly the caricature of that ideal. Des Esseintes,\r\nthough studied from a real man, who is known to those who know a\r\ncertain kind of society in Paris, is a type rather than a man: he is\r\nthe offspring of the Decadent art that he adores, and this book a\r\nsort of breviary for its worshippers. It has a place of its own in\r\nthe literature of the day, for it sums up, not only a talent, but a\r\nspiritual epoch.\r\n\r\n_A Rebours_ is a book that can only be written once, and since that\r\ndate Huysmans has published a short story, _Un Dilemme_ (1887), which\r\nis merely a somewhat lengthy anecdote; two novels, _En Rade_(1887)\r\nand _L\xc3\xa0-Bas_(1891), both of which are interesting experiments, but\r\nneither of them an entire success; and a volume of art criticism,\r\n_Certains_ (1890), notable for a single splendid essay, that on\r\nF\xc3\xa9licien Rops, the etcher of the fantastically erotic. _En Rade_ is a\r\nsort of deliberately exaggerated record--vision rather then record--of\r\nthe disillusions of a country sojourn, as they affect the disordered\r\nnerves of a town _n\xc3\xa9vrose._ The narrative is punctuated by nightmares,\r\nmarvellously woven out of nothing, and with no psychological value--the\r\nhuman part of the book being a sort of picturesque pathology at best,\r\nthe representation of a series of states of nerves, sharpened by the\r\ntragic ennui of the country. There is a cat which becomes interesting\r\nin its agonies; but the long boredom of the man and woman is only\r\ntoo faithfully shared with the reader. _L\xc3\xa0-Bas_ is a more artistic\r\ncreation, on a more solid foundation. It is a study of Satanism,\r\na dexterous interweaving of the history of Gilles de Retz (the\r\ntraditional Bluebeard) with the contemporary manifestations of the\r\nBlack Art. "The execration of impotence, the hate of the mediocre--that\r\nis perhaps one of the most indulgent definitions of Diabolism," says\r\nHuysmans, somewhere in the book, and it is on this side that one finds\r\nthe link of connection with the others of that series of pessimist\r\nstudies in life. _Un naturalisme spiritualiste,_ he defines his own\r\nart at this point in its development; and it is in somewhat the\r\n"documentary" manner that he applies himself to the study of these\r\nstrange problems, half of hysteria, half of a real mystical corruption\r\nthat does actually exist in our midst. I do not know whether the\r\nmonstrous tableau of the Black Mass--so marvellously, so revoltingly\r\ndescribed in the central episode of the book--is still enacted in our\r\ndays, but I do know that all but the most horrible practices of the\r\nsacrilegious magic of the Middle Ages are yet performed, from time\r\nto time, in a secrecy which is all but absolute. The character of\r\nMadame Chantelouve is an attempt, probably the first in literature,\r\nto diagnose a case of Sadism in a woman. To say that it is successful\r\nwould be to assume that the thing is possible, which one hesitates to\r\ndo. The book is even more disquieting, to the normal mind, than _A\r\nRebours._ But it is not, like that, the study of an exception which has\r\nbecome a type. It is the study of an exception which does not profess\r\nto be anything but a disease.\r\n\r\nHuysmans\' place in contemporary literature is not quite easy to\r\nestimate. There is a danger of being too much attracted, or too much\r\nrepelled, by those qualities of deliberate singularity which make\r\nhis work, sincere expression as it is of his own personality, so\r\nartificial and _recherch\xc3\xa9_ in itself. With his pronounced, exceptional\r\ncharacteristics, it would have been impossible for him to write fiction\r\nimpersonally, or to range himself, for long, in any school, under any\r\nmaster. Interrogated one day as to his opinion of Naturalism, he had\r\nbut to say in reply: _Au fond, il y a des \xc3\xa9crivains qui out du talent\r\net d\'autres qui n\'en out pas, qu\'ils soient naturalistes, romantiques,\r\nd\xc3\xa9cadents, tout ce que vous voudrez, \xc3\xa7a m\'est \xc3\xa9gal! il s\'agit pour\r\nmoi d\'avoir du talent, et voil\xc3\xa0 tout!_ But, as we have seen, he has\r\nundergone various influences, he has had his periods. From the first\r\nhe has had a style of singular pungency, novelty, and colour; and,\r\neven in _Le Drageoir \xc3\xa0 Epices,_ we find such daring combinations as\r\nthis _(Cama\xc3\xafeu Rouge)--Cette fanfare de rouge m\'\xc3\xa9tourdissait; cette\r\ngamme d\'une intensit\xc3\xa9 furieuse, d\'une violence inou\xc3\xafe, m\'aveuglait._\r\nWorking upon the foundation of Flaubert and of Goncourt, the two\r\ngreat modern stylists, he has developed an intensely personal style\r\nof his own, in which the sense of rhythm is entirely dominated by the\r\nsense of colour. He manipulates the French language with a freedom\r\nsometimes barbarous, "dragging his images by the heels or the hair"\r\n(in the admirable phrase of L\xc3\xa9on Bloy) "up and down the worm-eaten\r\nstaircase of terrified syntax," gaining, certainly, the effects at\r\nwhich he aims. He possesses, in the highest degree, that _style tachet\xc3\xa9\r\net faisand\xc3\xa9_--high-flavoured and spotted with corruption--that he\r\nattributes to Goncourt and Verlaine. And with this audacious and\r\nbarbaric profusion of words--chosen always for their colour and their\r\nvividly expressive quality--he is able to describe the essentially\r\nmodern aspects of things as no one had ever described them before. No\r\none before him had ever so realised the perverse charm of the sordid,\r\nthe perverse charm of the artificial. Exceptional always, it is for\r\nsuch qualities as these, rather than for the ordinary qualities of the\r\nnovelist, that he is remarkable. His stories are without incident,\r\nthey are constructed to go on until they stop, they are almost without\r\ncharacters. His psychology is a matter of the sensations, and chiefly\r\nthe visual sensations. The moral nature is ignored, the emotions\r\nresolve themselves for the most part into a sordid ennui, rising at\r\ntimes into a rage at existence. The protagonist of every book is not\r\nso much a character as a bundle of impressions and sensations--the\r\nvague outline of a single consciousness, his own. But it is that single\r\nconsciousness--in this morbidly personal writer--with which we are\r\nconcerned. For Huysmans\' novels, with all their strangeness, their\r\ncharm, their repulsion, typical too, as they are, of much beside\r\nhimself, are certainly the expression of a personality as remarkable as\r\nthat of any contemporary writer.\r\n\r\n1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE LATER HUYSMANS\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his first novel, _Marthe: histoire d\'une fille,_\r\nthirty years ago, Huysmans defined his theory of art in this defiant\r\nphrase: "I write what I see, what I feel, and what I have experienced,\r\nand I write it as well as I can: that is all." Ten or twelve years\r\nago, he could still say, in answer to an interviewer who asked him his\r\nopinion of Naturalism: "At bottom, there are writers who have talent\r\nand others who have not; let them be Naturalists, Romantics, Decadents,\r\nwhat you will, it is all the same to me: I only want to know if they\r\nhave talent." Such theoretical liberality, in a writer of original\r\ntalent, is a little disconcerting: it means that he is without a theory\r\nof his own, that he is not yet conscious of having chosen his own way.\r\nAnd, indeed, it is only with _En Route_ that Huysmans can be said to\r\nhave discovered the direction in which he had really been travelling\r\nfrom the beginning.\r\n\r\nIn a preface written not long since for a limited edition of _A\r\nRebours,_ Huysmans confessed that he had never been conscious of the\r\ndirection in which he was travelling. "My life and my literature,"\r\nhe affirmed, "have undoubtedly a certain amount of passivity, of the\r\nincalculable, of a direction not mine. I have simply obeyed; I have\r\nbeen led by what are called \'mysterious ways.\'" He is speaking of the\r\nconversion which took him to La Trappe in 1892, but the words apply\r\nto the whole course of his career as a man of letters. In _L\xc3\xa0-Bas,_\r\nwhich is a sort of false start, he had, indeed, realised, though for\r\nhimself at that time ineffectually, that "it is essential to preserve\r\nthe veracity of the document, the precision of detail, the fibrous and\r\nnervous language of Realism, but it is equally essential to become\r\nthe well-digger of the soul, and not to attempt to explain what is\r\nmysterious by mental maladies.... It is essential, in a word, to follow\r\nthe great road so deeply dug out by Zola, but it is necessary also to\r\ntrace a parallel pathway in the air, and to grapple with the within\r\nand the after, to create, in a word, a spiritual Naturalism." This\r\nis almost a definition of the art of _En Route,_ where this spiritual\r\nrealism is applied to the history of a soul, a consciousness; in _La\r\nCath\xc3\xa9drale_ the method has still further developed, and Huysmans\r\nbecomes, in his own way, a Symbolist.\r\n\r\nTo the student of psychology few more interesting cases could be\r\npresented than the development of Huysmans. From the first he has\r\nbeen a man "for whom the visible world existed," indeed, but as the\r\nscene of a slow martyrdom. The world has always appeared to him to\r\nbe a profoundly uncomfortable, unpleasant, and ridiculous place; and\r\nit has been a necessity of his temperament to examine it minutely,\r\nwith all the patience of disgust, and a necessity of his method to\r\nrecord it with an almost ecstatic hatred. In his first book, _Le\r\nDrageoir \xc3\xa0 Epices,_ published at the age of twenty-six, we find him\r\nseeking his colour by preference in a drunkard\'s cheek or a carcase\r\noutside a butcher\'s shop. _Marthe,_ published at Brussels in 1876,\r\nanticipates _La Fille \xc3\x89lisa_ and _Nana,_ but it has a crude brutality\r\nof observation in which there is hardly a touch of pity. _Les S\xc5\x93urs\r\nVatard_ is a frame without a picture, but in _En M\xc3\xa9nage_ the dreary\r\ntedium of existence is chronicled in all its insignificance with a kind\r\nof weary and aching hate. "We, too," is its conclusion, "by leave of\r\nthe everlasting stupidity of things, may, like our fellow-citizens,\r\nlive stupid and respected." The fantastic unreality, the exquisite\r\nartificiality of _A Rebours,_ the breviary of the decadence, is the\r\nfirst sign of that possible escape which Huysmans has always foreseen\r\nin the direction of art, but which he is still unable to make into\r\nmore than an artificial paradise, in which beauty turns to a cruel\r\nhallucination and imprisons the soul still more fatally. The end is\r\na cry of hopeless hope, in which Huysmans did not understand the\r\nmeaning till later: "Lord, have pity of the Christian who doubts, of\r\nthe sceptic who would fain believe, of the convict of life who sets\r\nsail alone by night, under a firmament lighted only by the consoling\r\nwatch-lights of the old hope."\r\n\r\nIn _L\xc3\xa0-Bas_ we are in yet another stage of this strange pilgrim\'s\r\nprogress. The disgust which once manifested itself in the merely\r\nexternal revolt against the ugliness of streets, the imbecility of\r\nfaces, has become more and more internalised, and the attraction of\r\nwhat is perverse in the unusual beauty of art has led, by some obscure\r\nroute, to the perilous halfway house of a corrupt mysticism. The book,\r\nwith its monstrous pictures of the Black Mass and of the spiritual\r\nabominations of Satanism, is one step further in the direction of\r\nthe supernatural; and this, too, has its desperate, unlooked-for\r\nconclusion: "Christian glory is a laughing-stock to our age; it\r\ncontaminates the supernatural and casts out the world to come." In\r\n_L\xc3\xa0-Bas_ we go down into the deepest gulf; _En Route_ sets us one stage\r\nalong a new way, and at this turning-point begins the later Huysmans.\r\n\r\nThe old conception of the novel as an amusing tale of adventures,\r\nthough it has still its apologists in England, has long since ceased\r\nin France to mean anything more actual than powdered wigs and lace\r\nruffles. Like children who cry to their elders for "a story, a story,"\r\nthe English public still wants its plot, its heroine, its villain.\r\nThat the novel should be psychological was a discovery as early as\r\nBenjamin Constant, whose _Adolphe_ anticipates _Le Rouge et le Noir,_\r\nthat rare, revealing, yet somewhat arid masterpiece of Stendhal.\r\nBut that psychology could be carried so far into the darkness of\r\nthe soul, that the flaming walls of the world themselves faded to a\r\nglimmer, was a discovery which had been made by no novelist before\r\nHuysmans wrote _En Route._ At once the novel showed itself capable\r\nof competing, on their own ground, with poetry, with the great\r\n"confessions," with philosophy. _En Route_ is perhaps the first novel\r\nwhich does not et out with the aim of amusing its readers. It offers\r\nyou no more entertainment than _Paradise Lost_ or the _Confessions_\r\nof St. Augustine, and it is possible to consider it on the same\r\nlevel. The novel, which, after having chronicled the adventures of\r\nthe Vanity Fairs of this world, has set itself with admirable success\r\nto analyse the amorous and ambitious and money-making intelligence of\r\nthe conscious and practical self, sets itself at last to the final\r\nachievement: the revelation of the sub-conscious self, no longer the\r\nintelligence, but the soul. Here, then, purged of the distraction of\r\nincident, liberated from the bondage of a too realistic conversation,\r\nin which the aim had been to convey the very gesture of breathing\r\nlife, internalised to a complete liberty, in which, just because it is\r\nso absolutely free, art is able to accept, without limiting itself,\r\nthe expressive medium of a convention, we have in the novel a new\r\nform, which may be at once a confession and a decoration, the soul\r\nand a pattern. This story of a conversion is a new thing in modern\r\nFrench; it is a confession, a self-auscultation of the soul; a kind\r\nof thinking aloud. It fixes, in precise words, all the uncertainties,\r\nthe contradictions, the absurd unreasonableness and not less absurd\r\nlogic, which distract man\'s brain in the passing over him of sensation\r\nand circumstance. And all this thinking is concentrated on one end,\r\nis concerned with the working out, in his own singular way, of one\r\nman\'s salvation. There is a certain dry hard casuistry, a subtlety and\r\ncloseness almost ecclesiastical, in the investigation of an obscure and\r\nyet definite region, whose intellectual passions are as varied and as\r\ntumultuous as those of the heart. Every step is taken deliberately,\r\nis weighed, approved, condemned, viewed from this side and from that,\r\nand at the same time one feels behind all this reasoning an impulsion\r\nurging a soul onward against its will. In this astonishing passage,\r\nthrough Satanism to faith, in which the cry, "I am so weary of myself,\r\nso sick of my miserable existence," echoes through page after page,\r\nuntil despair dies into conviction, the conviction of "the uselessness\r\nof concerning oneself about anything but mysticism and the liturgy,\r\nof thinking about anything but about, God," it is impossible not to\r\nsee the sincerity of an actual, unique experience. The force of mere\r\ncuriosity can go far, can penetrate to a certain depth; yet there is a\r\npoint at which mere curiosity, even that of genius, comes to an end;\r\nand we are left to the individual soul\'s apprehension of what seems\r\nto it the reality of spiritual things. Such a personal apprehension\r\ncomes to us out of this book, and at the same time, just as in the days\r\nwhen he forced language to express, in a more coloured and pictorial\r\nway than it had ever expressed before, the last escaping details of\r\nmaterial things, so, in this analysis of the aberrations and warfares,\r\nthe confessions and trials of the soul in penitence, Huysmans has found\r\nwords for even the most subtle and illusive aspects of that inner life\r\nwhich he has come, at the last, to apprehend.\r\n\r\nIn _La Cath\xc3\xa9drale_ we are still occupied with this sensitive,\r\nlethargic, persevering soul, but with that soul in one of its longest\r\nhalts by the way, as it undergoes the slow, permeating influence of\r\n_"la Cath\xc3\xa9drale mystique par excellence,"_ the cathedral of Chartres.\r\nAnd the greater part of the book is taken up with a study of this\r\ncathedral, of that elaborate and profound symbolism by which "the soul\r\nof sanctuaries" slowly reveals itself _(quel laconisme herm\xc3\xa9tique!)_\r\nwith a sort of parallel interpretation of the symbolism which the\r\nChurch of the Middle Ages concealed or revealed in colours, precious\r\nstones, plants, animals, numbers, odours, and in the Bible itself, in\r\nthe setting together of the Old and New Testaments.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, to some extent this book is less interesting than _En\r\nRoute,_ in the exact proportion in which everything in the world is\r\nless interesting than the human soul. There are times when Durtal is\r\nalmost forgotten, and, unjustly enough, it may seem as if we are given\r\nthis arch\xc3\xa6ology, these bestiaries, for their own sake. To fall into\r\nthis error is to mistake the whole purpose of the book, the whole\r\nextent of the discovery in art which Huysmans has been one of the first\r\nto make.\r\n\r\nFor in _La Cath\xc3\xa9drale_ Huysmans does but carry further the principle\r\nwhich he had perceived in _En Route,_ showing, as he does, how inert\r\nmatter, the art of stones, the growth of plants, the unconscious life\r\nof beasts, may be brought under the same law of the soul, may obtain,\r\nthrough symbol, a spiritual existence. He is thus but extending the\r\ndomain of the soul while he may seem to be limiting or ignoring it;\r\nand Durtal may well stand aside for a moment, in at least the energy\r\nof contemplation, while he sees, with a new understanding, the very\r\nsight of his eyes, the very staff of his thoughts, taking life before\r\nhim, a life of the same substance as his own. What is Symbolism if\r\nnot an establishing of the links which hold the world together, the\r\naffirmation of an eternal, minute, intricate, almost invisible life,\r\nwhich runs through the whole universe? Every age has its own symbols;\r\nbut a symbol once perfectly expressed, that symbol remains, as Gothic\r\narchitecture remains the very soul of the Middle Ages. To get at that\r\ntruth which is all but the deepest meaning of beauty, to find that\r\nsymbol which is its most adequate expression, is in itself a kind of\r\ncreation; and that is what Huysmans does for us in _La Cath\xc3\xa9drale._\r\nMore and more he has put aside all the profane and accessible and\r\noutward pomp of writing for an inner and more severe beauty of perfect\r\ntruth. He has come to realise that truth can be reached and revealed\r\nonly by symbol. Hence, all that description, that heaping up of detail,\r\nthat passionately patient elaboration: all means to an end, not, as you\r\nmay hastily incline to think, ends in themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe how often an artist perfects a particular\r\nmeans of expression long before he has any notion of what to do with\r\nit. Huysmans began by acquiring so astonishing a mastery of description\r\nthat he could describe the inside of a cow hanging in a butcher\'s shop\r\nas beautifully as if it were a casket of jewels. The little work-girls\r\nof his early novels were taken for long walks, in which they would\r\nhave seen nothing but the arm on which they leant and the milliners\'\r\nshops which they passed; and what they did not see was described,\r\nmarvellously, in twenty pages.\r\n\r\nHuysmans is a brain all eye, a brain which sees even ideas as if they\r\nhad a superficies. His style is always the same, whether he writes of\r\na butcher\'s shop or of a stained-glass window; it is the immediate\r\nexpression of a way of seeing, so minute and so intense that it\r\nbecomes too emphatic for elegance and too coloured for atmosphere\r\nor composition, always ready to sacrifice euphony to either fact or\r\ncolour. He cares only to give you the thing seen, exactly as he sees\r\nit, with all his love or hate, and with all the exaggeration which\r\nthat feeling brings into it. And he loves beauty as a bulldog loves\r\nits mistress: by growling at all her enemies. He honours wisdom by\r\nannihilating stupidity. His art of painting in words resembles Monet\'s\r\nart of painting With his brush: there is the same power of rendering\r\na vivid effect, almost deceptively, with a crude and yet sensitive\r\nrealism. _"C\'est pour la gourmandise de l\'\xc5\x93il un gala de teintes"_\r\nhe says of the provision cellars at Hamburg; and this greed of the eye\r\nhas eaten up in him almost every other sense. Even of music he writes\r\nas a deaf man with an eye for colour might write, to whom a musician\r\nhad explained certain technical means of expression in music. No one\r\nhas ever invented such barbarous and exact metaphors for the rendering\r\nof visual sensations. Properly, there is no metaphor; the words say\r\nexactly what they mean; they become figurative, as we call it, in their\r\ninsistence on being themselves! fact.\r\n\r\nHuysmans knows that the motive force of, the sentence lies in the\r\nverbs, and his verbs: are the most singular, precise, and expressive in\r\nany language. But in subordinating, as he does, every quality to that\r\nof sharp, telling truth, the truth of extremes, his style loses charm;\r\nyet it can be dazzling; it has the solidity of those walls encrusted\r\nwith gems which are to be seen in a certain chapel in Prague; it blazes\r\nwith colour, and arabesques into a thousand fantastic patterns.\r\n\r\nAnd now all that laboriously acquired mastery finds at last its use,\r\nlending itself to the new spirit with a wonderful docility. At last the\r\nidea which is beyond reality has been found, not where Des Esseintes\r\nsought it, and a new meaning comes into what had once been scarcely\r\nmore than patient and wrathful observation. The idea is there, visible,\r\nin his cathedral, like the sun which flashes into unity, into meaning,\r\ninto intelligible beauty the bewildering lozenges of colour, the\r\ninextricable trails of lead, which go to make up the picture in one\r\nof its painted windows. What, for instance, could be more precise in\r\nits translation of the different aspects under which the cathedral of\r\nChartres can be seen, merely as colour, than this one sentence: "Seen\r\nas a whole, under a clear sky, its grey silvers, and, if the sun shines\r\nupon it, turns pale yellow and then golden; seen close, its skin is\r\nlike that of a nibbled biscuit, with its silicious limestone, eaten\r\ninto holes; sometimes, when the sun is setting, it turns crimson, and\r\nrises up like a monstrous and delicate shrine, rose and green; and, at\r\ntwilight, turns blue, then seems to evaporate as it fades into violet."\r\nOr, again, in a passage which comes nearer to the conventional idea\r\nof eloquence, how absolute an avoidance of a conventional phrase, a\r\nword used for its merely oratorical value: "High up, in space, like\r\nsalamanders, human beings, with burning faces and flaming robes, lived\r\nin a firmament of fire; but these conflagrations were circumscribed,\r\nlimited by an incombustible frame of darker glass, which beat back the\r\nclear young joy of the flames; by that kind of melancholy, that more\r\nserious and more aged aspect, which is taken by the duller colours.\r\nThe hue and cry of reds, the limpid security of whites, the reiterated\r\nhalleluias of yellows, the virginal glory of blues, all the quivering\r\nhearth-glow of painted glass, dies away as it came near this border\r\ncoloured with the rust of iron, with the russet of sauce, with the\r\nharsh violet of sandstone, with bottle-green, with the brown of\r\ntouchwood, with sooty black, with ashen grey."\r\n\r\nThis, in its excess of exactitude (how medi\xc3\xa6val a quality!)\r\nbecomes, on one page, a comparison of the tower without a spire to\r\nan unsharpened pencil which cannot write the prayers of earth upon\r\nthe sky. But for the most part it is a consistent humanising of too\r\nobjectively visible things a disengaging of the sentiment which\r\nexists in them, which is one of the secrets of their appeal to us,\r\nbut which for the most part we overlook as we set ourselves to add\r\nup the shapes and colours which have enchanted us. To Huysmans this\r\nartistic discovery has come, perhaps in the most effectual way, but\r\ncertainly in the way least probable in these days, through faith, a\r\ndefinite religious faith; so that, beginning tentatively, he has come,\r\nat last, to believe in the Catholic Church as a monk of the Middle Ages\r\nbelieved in it. And there is no doubt that to Huysmans this abandonment\r\nto religion has brought, among other gifts, a certain human charity\r\nin which he was notably lacking, removing at once one of his artistic\r\nlimitations. It has softened his contempt of humanity; it has broadened\r\nhis outlook on the world. And the sense, diffused through the whole of\r\nthis book, of the living and beneficent reality of the Virgin, of her\r\nreal presence in the cathedral built in her honour and after her own\r\nimage, brings a strange and touching kind of poetry into these closely\r\nand soberly woven pages.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward, until his death, Huysmans is seen purging\r\nhimself of his realism, coming closer and closer to that spiritual\r\nNaturalism which he had invented, an art made out of an apprehension\r\nof the inner meaning of those things which he still saw with the old\r\ntenacity of vision. Nothing is changed in him and yet all is changed.\r\nThe disgust of the world deepens through _L\'Oblat,_ which is the last\r\nstage but one in the pilgrimage which begins with _En Route._ It\r\nseeks an escape in poring, with a dreadful diligence, over a saint\'s\r\nrecorded miracles, in the life of _Sainte Lydwine de Schiedam,_ which\r\nis medi\xc3\xa6val in its precise acceptance of every horrible detail of the\r\nstory. _Les Foules de Lourdes_ has the same minute attentiveness to\r\nhorror, but with a new pity in it, and a way of giving thanks to the\r\nVirgin, which is in Huysmans yet another escape from his disgust of\r\nthe world. But it is in the great chapter on Satan as the creator of\r\nugliness that his work seems to end where it had begun, in the service\r\nof art, now come from a great way off to join itself with the service\r\nof God, And the whole soul of Huysmans characterises itself in the turn\r\nof a single phrase there: that "art is the only clean thing on earth,\r\nexcept holiness."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR RIMBAUD\r\n\r\n\r\nThat story of the Arabian Nights, which is at the same time a true\r\nstory, the life of Rimbaud, has been told, for the first time, in\r\nthe extravagant but valuable book of an anarchist of letters, who\r\nwrites under the name of Paterne Berrichon, and who has since married\r\nRimbaud\'s sister. _La Vie de Jean-Arthur Rimbaud_ is full of curiosity\r\nfor those who have been mystified by I know not what legends, invented\r\nto give wonder to a career itself more wonderful than any of the\r\ninventions. The man who died at Marseilles, at the Hospital of the\r\nConception, on March 10 1891, at the age of thirty-seven, _n\xc3\xa9gociant,_\r\nas the register of his death describes him, was a writer of genius,\r\nan innovator in verse and prose, who had written all his poetry by\r\nthe age of nineteen, and all his prose by a year or two later. He had\r\ngiven up literature to travel hither and thither, first in Europe, then\r\nin Africa; he had been an engineer, a leader of caravans, a merchant\r\nof precious merchandise. And this man, who had never written down a\r\nline after those astonishing early experiments, was heard, in his last\r\ndelirium, talking of precisely such visions as those which had haunted\r\nhis youth, and using, says his sister, "expressions of a singular and\r\npenetrating charm" to render these sensations of visionary countries.\r\nHere certainly is one of the most curious problems of literature: is it\r\na problem of which we can discover the secret?\r\n\r\nJean-Nicolas-Arthur Rimbaud was born at Charleville, in the Ardennes,\r\nOctober 28, 1854. His father, of whom he saw little, was a captain\r\nin the army; his mother, of peasant origin, was severe, rigid and\r\nunsympathetic. At school he was an unwilling but brilliant scholar,\r\nand by his fifteenth year was well acquainted with Latin literature\r\nand intimately with French literature. It was in that year that he\r\nbegan to write poems from the first curiously original: eleven poems\r\ndating from that year are to be found in his collected works. When he\r\nwas sixteen he decided that he had had enough of school, and enough\r\nof home. Only Paris existed: he must go to Paris. The first time he\r\nwent without a ticket; he spent, indeed, fifteen days in Paris, but\r\nhe spent them in Mazas, from which he was released and restored to\r\nhis home by his schoolmaster. The second time, a few days later, he\r\nsold his watch, which paid for his railway ticket. This time he threw\r\nhimself on the hospitality of Andr\xc3\xa9 Gill, a painter and verse-writer,\r\nof some little notoriety then, whose address he had happened to come\r\nacross. The uninvited guest was not welcomed, and after some penniless\r\ndays in Paris he tramped back to Charleville. The third time (he had\r\nwaited five months, writing poems, and discontented to be only writing\r\npoems) he made his way to Paris on foot, in a heat of revolutionary\r\nsympathy, to offer himself to the insurgents of the Commune. Again he\r\nhad to return on foot. Finally, having learnt with difficulty that a\r\nman is not taken at his own valuation until he has proved his right to\r\nbe so accepted, he sent up the manuscript of his poems to Verlaine.\r\nThe manuscript contained _Le Bateau Ivre, Les Premi\xc3\xa8res Communions, Ma\r\nBoh\xc3\xa8me, Roman, Les Effar\xc3\xa9s,_ and, indeed, all but a few of the poems\r\nhe ever wrote. Verlaine was overwhelmed with delight, and invited him\r\nto Paris. A local admirer lent him the money to get there, and from\r\nOctober, 1871, to July, 1872, he was Verlaine\'s guest.\r\n\r\nThe boy of seventeen, already a perfectly original poet, and beginning\r\nto be an equally original prose-writer, astonished the whole Parnasse,\r\nBanville, Hugo himself. On Verlaine his influence was more profound.\r\nThe meeting brought about one of those lamentable and admirable\r\ndisasters which make and unmake careers. Verlaine has told us in his\r\n_Confessions_ that, "in the beginning, there was no question of any\r\nsort of affection or sympathy between two natures so different as\r\nthat of the poet of the _Assis_ and mine, but simply of an extreme\r\nadmiration and astonishment before this boy of sixteen, who had already\r\nwritten things, as F\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9on has excellently said, \'perhaps outside\r\nliterature.\'" This admiration and astonishment passed gradually into\r\na more personal feeling, and it was under the influence of Rimbaud\r\nthat the long vagabondage of Verlaine\'s life began. The two poets\r\nwandered together through Belgium, England, and again Belgium, from\r\nJuly, 1872, to August, 1873, when there occurred that tragic parting at\r\nBrussels which left Verlaine a prisoner for eighteen months, and sent\r\nRimbaud back to his family. He had already written all the poetry and\r\nprose that he was ever to write, and in 1873 he printed at Brussels\r\n_Une Saison en Enfer._ It was the only book he himself ever gave to\r\nthe press, and no sooner was it printed than he destroyed the whole\r\nedition, with the exception of a few copies, of which only Verlaine\'s\r\ncopy, I believe, still exists. Soon began new wanderings, with their\r\ninvariable return to the starting-point of Charleville: a few days\r\nin Paris, a year in England, four months in Stuttgart (where he was\r\nvisited by Verlaine), Italy, France again, Vienna, Java, Holland,\r\nSweden, Egypt, Cyprus, Abyssinia, and then nothing but Africa, until\r\nthe final return to France. He had been a teacher of French in England,\r\na seller of key-rings in the streets of Paris, had unloaded vessels\r\nin the ports, and helped to gather in the harvest in the country;\r\nhe had been a volunteer in the Dutch army, a military engineer, a\r\ntrader; and now physical sciences had begun to attract his insatiable\r\ncuriosity, and dreams of the fabulous East began to resolve themselves\r\ninto dreams of a romantic commerce with the real East. He became a\r\nmerchant of coffee, perfumes, ivory, and gold, in the interior of\r\nAfrica; then an explorer, a predecessor, and in his own regions, of\r\nMarchand. After twelve years\' wandering and exposure in Africa he was\r\nattacked by a malady of the knee, which rapidly became worse. He was\r\ntransported first to Aden, then to Marseilles, where, in May, 1891, his\r\nleg was amputated. Further complications set in. He insisted, first,\r\non being removed to his home, then on being taken back to Marseilles.\r\nHis sufferings were an intolerable torment, and more cruel to him was\r\nthe torment of his desire to live. He died inch by inch, fighting\r\nevery inch; and his sister\'s quiet narrative of those last months is\r\nagonising. He died at Marseilles in November, "prophesying," says his\r\nsister, and repeating, "Allah Kerim! Allah Kerim!"\r\n\r\nThe secret of Rimbaud, I think, and the reason why he was able to do\r\nthe unique thing in literature which he did, and then to disappear\r\nquietly and become a legend in the East, is that his mind was not\r\nthe mind of the artist but of the man of action. He was a dreamer,\r\nbut all his dreams were discoveries. To him it was an identical act\r\nof his temperament to write the sonnet of the _Vowels_ and to trade\r\nin ivory and frankincense with the Arabs. He lived with all his\r\nfaculties at every instant of his life, abandoning himself to himself\r\nwith a confidence which was at once his strength and (looking at\r\nthings less absolutely) his weakness. To the student of success, and\r\nwhat is relative in achievement, he illustrates the danger of one\'s\r\nover-possession by one\'s own genius, just as aptly as the saint in the\r\ncloister does, or the mystic too full of God to speak intelligibly to\r\nthe world, or the spilt wisdom of the drunkard. The artist who is above\r\nall, things an artist cultivates a little choice corner of himself\r\nwith elaborate care; he brings miraculous flowers to growth there, but\r\nthe rest of the garden is but mown grass or tangled bushes. That is\r\nwhy many excellent writers very many painters, and most musicians are\r\nso tedious on any subject but their own. Is it not tempting, does it\r\nnot seem a devotion rather than a superstition, to worship the golden\r\nchalice in which the wine has been made God, as if the chalice were the\r\nreality, and the Real Presence the symbol? The artist, who is only an\r\nartist, circumscribes his intelligence into almost such a fiction, as\r\nhe reverences the work of his own hands. But there are certain natures\r\n(great or small, Shakespeare or Rimbaud, it makes no difference) to\r\nwhom the work is nothing; the act of working, everything. Rimbaud was\r\na small, narrow, hard, precipitate nature, which had the will to live,\r\nand nothing but the will to live; and his verses, and his follies,\r\nand his wanderings, and his traffickings were but the breathing of\r\ndifferent hours in his day.\r\n\r\nThat is why he is so swift, definite, and quickly exhausted in vision;\r\nwhy he had his few things to say, each an action with consequences.\r\nHe invents new ways of saying things, not because he is a learned\r\nartist, but because he is burning to say them, and he has none of\r\nthe hesitations of knowledge. He leaps right over or through the\r\nconventions that had been standing in everybody\'s way; he has no time\r\nto go round, and no respect for trespass-boards, and so he becomes the\r\n_enfant terrible_ of literature, playing pranks (as in that sonnet of\r\nthe _Vowels),_ knocking down barriers for the mere amusement of the\r\nthing, getting all the possible advantage of his barbarisms in mind\r\nand conduct. And so, in life, he is first of all conspicuous as a\r\ndisorderly liver, a r\xc3\xa9volter against morals as against prosody, though\r\nwe may imagine that, in his heart, morals meant as little to him, one\r\nway or the other, as prosody. Later on, his revolt seems to be against\r\ncivilisation itself, as he disappears into the deserts of Africa. And\r\nit is, if you like, a revolt against civilisation, but the revolt is\r\ninstinctive, a need of the organism; it is not doctrinal, cynical, a\r\nconviction, a sentiment.\r\n\r\nAlways, as he says _r\xc3\xaavant univers fantastiques,_ he is conscious\r\nof the danger as well as the ecstasy of that divine imitation; for\r\nhe says: "My life will always be too vast to be given up wholly to\r\nforce and beauty." _J\'attends Dieu avec gourmandise,_ he cries, in a\r\nfine rapture; and then, sadly enough: "I have created all the feasts,\r\nall the triumphs, all the dramas of the world. I have set myself to\r\ninvent new flowers, a new flesh, a new language. I have fancied that\r\nI have attained supernatural power. Well, I have now only to put my\r\nimagination and my memories in the grave. What a fine artist\'s and\r\nstory-teller\'s fame thrown away!" See how completely he is conscious,\r\nand how completely he is at the mercy, of that hallucinatory rage of\r\nvision, vision to him being always force, power, creation, which, on\r\nsome of his pages, seems to become sheer madness, and on others a\r\nkind of wild but absolute insight. He will be silent, he tells us,\r\nas to all that he contains within his mind, "greedy as the sea," for\r\notherwise poets and visionaries would envy him his fantastic wealth.\r\nAnd, in that _Nuit d\'Enfer,_ which does not bear that title in vain,\r\nhe exalts himself as a kind of saviour; he is in the circle of pride\r\nin Dante\'s hell, and he has lost all sense of limit, really believes\r\nhimself to be "no one and some one." Then, in the _Alchimie du Verbe,_\r\nhe becomes the analyst of his own hallucinations. "I believe in all\r\nthe enchantments," he tells us; "I invented the colour of the vowels;\r\nA, black; E, white; I, red; O, blue; U, green. I regulated the form\r\nand the movement of every consonant, and, with instinctive rhythms, I\r\nflattered myself that I had invented a poetic language accessible, one\r\nday or another, to every shade of meaning. I reserved to myself the\r\nright of translation."[1]\r\n\r\nCoincidence or origin, it has lately been pointed out that Rimbaud may\r\nformerly have seen an old ABC book in which the vowels are coloured\r\nfor the most part as his are (A, black; E, white; I, red; O, blue; U,\r\ngreen). In the little illustrative pictures around them some are oddly\r\nin keeping with the image of Rimbaud.\r\n\r\n"... I accustomed myself to simple hallucination: I saw, quite frankly,\r\na mosque in place of a factory, a school of drums kept by the angels,\r\npost-chaises on the roads of heaven, a drawing-room at the bottom of a\r\nlake; monsters, mysteries; the title of a vaudeville raised up horrors\r\nbefore me. Then I explained my magical sophisms by the hallucination of\r\nwords! I ended by finding something sacred in the disorder of my mind."\r\nThen he makes the great discovery. Action, one sees, this fraudulent\r\nand insistent will to live, has been at the root of all these mental\r\nand verbal orgies, in which he has been wasting the "very substance of\r\nhis thought." Well, "action," he discovers, "is not life, but a way of\r\nspoiling something." Even this is a form of enervation, and must be\r\nrejected from the absolute. _Mon devoir m\'est remis. Il ne faut plus\r\nsonger \xc3\xa0 cela. Je suis r\xc3\xa9ellement d\'outre-tombe, et pas de commissions._\r\n\r\nIt is for the absolute that he seeks, always; the absolute which the\r\ngreat artist, with his careful wisdom, has renounced seeking. And,\r\nhe is content with nothing less; hence his own contempt for what he\r\nhas done, after all, so easily; for what has come to him, perhaps\r\nthrough his impatience, but imperfectly. He is a dreamer in whom dream\r\nis swift, hard in outline, coming suddenly and going suddenly, a real\r\nthing, but seen only in passing. Visions rush past him, he cannot\r\narrest them; they rush forth from him, he cannot restrain their haste\r\nto be gone, as he creates them in the mere indiscriminate idleness\r\nof energy. And so this seeker after the absolute leaves but a broken\r\nmedley of fragments, into each of which he has put a little of his\r\npersonality, which he is forever dramatising, by multiplying one facet,\r\nso to speak, after another. Very genuinely, he is now a beaten and\r\nwandering ship, flying in a sort of intoxication before the wind, over\r\nundiscovered seas; now a starving child outside a baker\'s window, in\r\nthe very ecstasy of hunger; now _la victime et la petite \xc3\xa9pouse_ of the\r\nfirst communion; now:\r\n\r\n    Je ne parlerai pas, je ne penserai rien;\r\n    Mais l\'amour infini me montera dans l\'\xc3\xa2me,\r\n    Et j\'irai loin, bien loin, comme un boh\xc3\xa9mien,\r\n    Par la Nature, heureux comme avec une femme!\r\n\r\nHe catches at verse, at prose, invents a sort of _vers libre_ before\r\nany one else, not quite knowing what to do with it, invents a quite\r\nnew way of writing prose, which Laforgue will turn to account later on;\r\nand having suggested, with some impatience, half the things that his\r\nown and the next generation are to busy themselves with developing, he\r\ngives up writing, as an inadequate form, to which he is also inadequate.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the actual value of Rimbaud\'s work, in verse and prose,\r\napart from its relative values of so many kinds? I think, considerable;\r\nthough it will probably come to rest on two or three pieces of verse,\r\nand a still vaguer accomplishment in prose. He brought into French\r\nverse something of that "gipsy way of going with nature, as with a\r\nwoman"; a very young, very crude, very defiant and sometimes very\r\nmasterly sense of just these real things which are too close to us to\r\nbe seen by most people with any clearness. He could render physical\r\nsensation, of the subtlest kind, without making any compromise with\r\nlanguage, forcing language to speak straight, taming it as one would\r\ntame a dangerous animal. And he kneaded prose as he kneaded verse,\r\nmaking it a disarticulated, abstract, mathematically lyrical thing. In\r\nverse, he pointed the way to certain new splendours, as to certain new\r\n_na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9s;_ there is the _Bateau Ivre,_ without which we might never\r\nhave had Verlaine\'s _Crimen Amoris._ And, intertangled with what is\r\ningenuous, and with what is splendid, there is a certain irony, which\r\ncomes into that youthful work as if youth were already reminiscent\r\nof itself, so conscious is it that youth is youth, and that youth is\r\npassing.\r\n\r\nIn all these ways, Rimbaud had his influence upon Verlaine, and his\r\ninfluence upon Verlaine was above all the influence of the man of\r\naction upon the man of sensation; the influence of what is simple,\r\nnarrow, emphatic, upon what is subtle, complex, growing. Verlaine\'s\r\nrich, sensitive nature was just then trying to realise itself. Just\r\nbecause it had such delicate possibilities, because there were so many\r\ndirections in which it could grow, it was not at first quite sure of\r\nits way. Rimbaud came into the life and, art of Verlaine, troubling\r\nboth, with that trouble which reveals a man to himself. Having helped\r\nto make Verlaine a great poet, he could go. Note that he himself could\r\nnever have developed: writing had been one of his discoveries; he could\r\nbut make other discoveries, personal ones. Even in literature he had\r\nhis future; but his future was Verlaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Here is the famous sonnet, which must be taken, as it was meant,\r\nwithout undue seriousness, and yet as something more than a mere joke.\r\n\r\n    VOYELLES\r\n\r\n    A noir, E blanc, I rouge, U vert, O bleu, voyelles,\r\n      Je dirai quelque jour vos naissances latentes.\r\n      A, noir corset velu des mouches \xc3\xa9clatantes\r\n    Qui bombillent autour des puanteurs cruelles,\r\n\r\n    Golfe d\'ombre; E, candeur des vapeurs et des tentes,\r\n      Lance des glaciers fiers, rois blancs, frissons d\'ombelles;\r\n      I, pourpres, sang crach\xc3\xa9, rire des l\xc3\xa8vres belles\r\n    _I_ Dans la col\xc3\xa8re ou les ivresses p\xc3\xa9nitentes;\r\n\r\n    U, cycles, vibrements divins des mers virides,\r\n    Paix des p\xc3\xa2tis sem\xc3\xa9s d\'animaux, paix des rides\r\n    Que l\'alchemie imprime aux grands fronts studieux;\r\n\r\n    O, supr\xc3\xaame clairon plein de strideurs \xc3\xa9tranges,\r\n    Silences travers\xc3\xa9s des mondes et des Anges;\r\n    --O l\'Om\xc3\xa9ga, rayon violet de Ses Yeux!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULES LAFORGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nJules Laforgue was born at Montevideo, of Breton parents, August 20,\r\n1860. He died in Paris in 1887, two days before his twenty-seventh\r\nbirthday. From 1880 to 1886 he had been reader to the Empress Augusta\r\nat Berlin. He married only a few months before his death. _D\'allures?_\r\nsays M. Gustave Kahn, _fort correctes, de hauts gibus, des cravates\r\nsobres, des vestons anglais, des pardessus clergymans, et de par\r\nles n\xc3\xa9cessit\xc3\xa9s, un parapluie immuablement plac\xc3\xa9 sous le bras._ His\r\nportraits show us a clean-shaved, reticent face, betraying little. With\r\nsuch a personality anecdotes have but small chance of appropriating\r\nthose details by which expansive natures express themselves to the\r\nworld. We know nothing about Laforgue which his work is not better\r\nable to tell us, even now that we have all his notes, unfinished\r\nfragments, and the letters of an almost virginal _na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9_ which he\r\nwrote to the woman whom he was going to marry. His entire work, apart\r\nfrom these additions, is contained in two small volumes, one of prose,\r\nthe _Moralit\xc3\xa9s L\xc3\xa9gendaires,_ the other of verse, _Les Complaintes,\r\nLimitation de Notre-Dame la Lune,_ and a few other pieces, all\r\npublished during the last three years of his life.\r\n\r\nThe prose and verse of Laforgue, scrupulously correct, but with a\r\nnew manner of correctness, owe more than any one has realised to the\r\nhalf-unconscious prose and verse of Rimbaud. Verse and prose are\r\nalike a kind of travesty, making subtle use of colloquialism, slang,\r\nneologism, technical terms, for their allusive, their factitious, their\r\nreflected meanings, with which one can play, very seriously. The verse\r\nis alert, troubled, swaying, deliberately uncertain, hating rhetoric so\r\npiously that it prefers, and finds its piquancy in, the ridiculously\r\nobvious. It is really _vers libre,_ but at the same time correct verse,\r\nbefore _vers libre_ had been invented. And it carries, as far as that\r\ntheory has ever been carried, the theory which demands an instantaneous\r\nnotation (Whistler, let us say) of the figure or landscape which one,\r\nhas been accustomed to define with such rigorous exactitude. Verse,\r\nalways elegant, is broken up into a kind of mockery of prose.\r\n\r\n    Encore un de mes pierrots mort;\r\n      Mort d\'un chronique orphelinisme;\r\n      C\'\xc3\xa9tait un c\xc5\x93ur plein de dandysme\r\n    Lunaire, en un dr\xc3\xb4le de corps;\r\n\r\nhe will say to us, with a familiarity of manner, as of one talking\r\nlanguidly, in a low voice, the lips always teased into a slightly\r\nbitter smile; and he will pass suddenly into the ironical lilt of\r\n\r\n    Hotel garni\r\n    De l\'infini,\r\n\r\n    Sphinx et Joconde\r\n    Des d\xc3\xa9funts mondes;\r\n\r\nand from that into this solemn and smiling end of one of his last\r\npoems, his own epitaph, if you will:\r\n\r\n    Il prit froid l\'autre automne,\r\n    S\'\xc3\xa9tant attardi vers les peines des cors,\r\n    Sur la fin d\'un beau jour.\r\n    Oh! ce fut pour vos cors, et ce fut pour l\'automne,\r\n    Qu\'il nous montra qu\' "on meurt d\'amour!"\r\n    On ne le verra plus aux f\xc3\xaates nationales,\r\n    S\'enfermer dans l\'Histoire et tirer les verrous,\r\n    Il vint trop tard, il est reparti sans scandale;\r\n    O vous qui m\'\xc3\xa9coutez, rentrez chacun chez vous.\r\n\r\nThe old cadences, the old eloquence, the ingenuous seriousness of\r\npoetry, are all banished, on a theory as self-denying as that which\r\npermitted Degas to dispense with recognisable beauty in his figures.\r\nHere, if ever, is modern verse, verse which dispenses with so many of\r\nthe privileges of poetry, for an ideal quite of its own. It is, after\r\nall, a very self-conscious ideal, becoming artificial through its\r\nextreme naturalness; for in poetry it is not "natural" to say things\r\nquite so much in the manner of the moment, with however ironical an\r\nintention.\r\n\r\nThe prose of the _Moralit\xc3\xa9s L\xc3\xa9gendaires_ is perhaps even more of\r\na discovery. Finding its origin, as I have pointed out, in the\r\nexperimental prose of Rimbaud, it carries that manner to a singular\r\nperfection. Disarticulated, abstract, mathematically lyrical, it\r\ngives expression, in its icy ecstasy, to a very subtle criticism of\r\nthe universe, with a surprising irony of cosmical vision. We learn\r\nfrom books of medi\xc3\xa6val magic that the embraces of the devil are of a\r\ncoldness so intense that it may be called, by an allowable figure of\r\nspeech, fiery. Everything may be as strongly its opposite as itself,\r\nand that is why this balanced, chill, colloquial style of Laforgue\r\nhas, in the paradox of its intensity, the essential heat of the most\r\nobviously emotional prose. The prose is more patient than the verse,\r\nwith its more compassionate laughter at universal experience. It can\r\nlaugh as seriously, as profoundly, as in that graveyard monologue of\r\nHamlet, Laforgue\'s Hamlet, who, Maeterlinck ventures to say, "is at\r\nmoments more Hamlet than the Hamlet of Shakespeare." Let me translate a\r\nfew sentences from it.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I have still twenty or thirty years to live, and I shall pass\r\nthat way like the others. Like the others? O Totality, the misery of\r\nbeing there no longer! Ah! I would like to set out to-morrow, and\r\nsearch all through the world for the most adamantine processes of\r\nembalming. They, too, were, the little people of History, learning to\r\nread, trimming their nails, lighting the dirty lamp every evening, in\r\nlove, gluttonous, vain, fond of compliments, handshakes, and kisses,\r\nliving on bell-tower gossip, saying, \'What sort of weather shall we\r\nhave to-morrow? Winter has really come.... We have had no plums this\r\nyear.\' Ah! everything is good, if it would not come to an end. And\r\nthou, Silence, pardon the Earth; the little madcap hardly knows what\r\nshe is doing; on the day of the great summing-up of consciousness\r\nbefore the Ideal, she will be labelled with a pitiful _idem_ in the\r\ncolumn of the miniature evolutions of the Unique Evolution, in the\r\ncolumn of n\xc3\xa9gligeable quantities ...". "To die! Evidently, one dies\r\nwithout knowing it, as, every night, one enters upon sleep. One has no\r\nconsciousness of the passing of the last lucid thought into sleep, into\r\nswooning, into death. Evidently. But to be no more, to be here no more,\r\nto be ours no more! Not even to be able, any more, to press against\r\none\'s human heart, some idle afternoon, the ancient sadness contained\r\nin one little chord on the piano!"\r\n\r\nIn these always "lunar" parodies, _Salom\xc3\xa9, Lohengrin, Fils de Parsifal,\r\nPers\xc3\xa9e et Androm\xc3\xa8de,_ each a kind of metaphysical myth, he realises\r\nthat _la cr\xc3\xa9ature va hardiment \xc3\xa0 \xc3\xaatre c\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9brale, anti-naturelle,_ and\r\nhe has invented these fantastic puppets with an almost Japanese art of\r\nspiritual dislocation. They are, in part, a way of taking one\'s revenge\r\nupon science, by an ironical borrowing of its very terms, which dance\r\nin his prose and verse, derisively, at the end of a string.\r\n\r\nIn his acceptance of the fragility of things as actually a principle\r\nof art, Laforgue is a sort of transformed Watteau, showing his disdain\r\nfor the world which fascinates him, in quite a different way. He\r\nhas constructed his own world, lunar and actual, speaking slang and\r\nastronomy, with a constant disengaging of the visionary aspect, under\r\nwhich frivolity becomes an escape from the arrogance of a still more\r\ntemporary mode of being, the world as it appears to the sober majority.\r\nHe is terribly conscious of daily life, cannot omit, mentally, a single\r\nhour of the day; and his flight to the moon is in sheer desperation.\r\nHe sees what he calls l\'_Inconscient_ in every gesture, but he cannot\r\nsee it without these gestures. And he sees, not only as an imposition,\r\nbut as a conquest, the possibilities for art which come from the sickly\r\nmodern being, with his clothes, his nerves: the mere fact that he\r\nflowers from the soil of his epoch.\r\n\r\nIt is an art of the nerves, this art of Laforgue, and it is what all\r\nart would tend towards if we followed our nerves on all their journeys.\r\nThere is in it all the restlessness of modern life, the haste to escape\r\nfrom whatever weighs too heavily on the liberty of the moment, that\r\ncapricious liberty which demands only room enough to hurry itself\r\nweary. It is distressingly conscious of the unhappiness of mortality,\r\nbut it plays, somewhat uneasily, at a disdainful indifference. And it\r\nis out of these elements of caprice, fear, contempt, linked together by\r\nan embracing laughter, that it makes its existence.\r\n\r\n_Il n\'y a pas de type, il y a la vie,_ Laforgue replies to those\r\nwho come to him with classical ideals. _Votre id\xc3\xa9al est bien vite\r\nmagnifiquement submerg\xc3\xa9,_ in life itself, which should form its\r\nown art, an art deliberately ephemeral, with the attaching pathos\r\nof passing things. There is a great pity at the root of this art\r\nof Laforgue: self-pity, which extends, with the artistic sympathy,\r\nthrough mere clearness of vision, across the world. His laughter,\r\nwhich Maeterlinck has defined so admirably as "the laughter of the\r\nsoul," is the laughter of Pierrot, more than half a sob, and shaken out\r\nof him with a deplorable gesture of the thin arms, thrown wide. He is a\r\nmetaphysical Pierrot, _Pierrot lunaire,_ and it is of abstract notions,\r\nthe whole science of the unconscious, that he makes his showman\'s\r\npatter. As it is part of his manner not to distinguish between irony\r\nand pity, or even belief, we need not attempt to do so. Heine should\r\nteach us to understand at least so much of a poet who could not\r\notherwise resemble him less. In Laforgue, sentiment is squeezed out of\r\nthe world before one begins to play at ball with it.\r\n\r\nAnd so, of the two, he is the more hopeless. He has invented a new\r\nmanner of being Ren\xc3\xa9 or Werther: an inflexible politeness towards man,\r\nwoman, and destiny. He composes love-poems hat in hand, and smiles with\r\nan exasperating tolerance before all the transformations of the eternal\r\nfeminine. He is very conscious of death, but his _blague_ of death is,\r\nabove all things, gentlemanly. He will not permit himself, at any\r\nmoment, the luxury of dropping the mask: not at any moment.\r\n\r\nRead this _Autre Complainte de Lord Pierrot,_ with the singular pity of\r\nits cruelty, before such an imagined dropping of the mask:\r\n\r\n    Celle qui doit me mettre au courant de la Femme!\r\n      Nous lui dirons d\'abord, de mon air le moins froid:\r\n    "La somme des angles d\'un triangle, ch\xc3\xa8re \xc3\xa2me,\r\n            Est \xc3\xa9gale \xc3\xa0 deux droits."\r\n\r\n    Et si ce cri lui part: "Dieu de Dieu que je t\'aime!"\r\n      "Dieu reconna\xc3\xaetra les siens." Ou piqu\xc3\xa9e au vif:\r\n    "Mes claviers out du c\xc5\x93ur, tu sera mon seul th\xc3\xa8me."\r\n            Moi\' "Tout est relatif."\r\n\r\n    De tous ses yeux, alors! se sentant trop banale:\r\n      "Ah! tu ne m\'aime pas; tant d\'autres sont jaloux!"\r\n    Et moi, d\'un \xc5\x93il qui vers l\'Inconscient s\'emballe:\r\n            "Merci, pas mal; et vous?\r\n\r\n    "Jouons au plus fid\xc3\xa8le!"--A quoi bon, \xc3\xb4 Nature!\r\n      "Autant \xc3\xa0 qui perd gagne." Alors, autre couplet.\r\n    "Ah! tu te lasseras le premier, j\'en suis s\xc3\xbbre."\r\n            "Apr\xc3\xa8s vous, s\'il vous pla\xc3\xaet."\r\n\r\n    Enfins, si, par un soir, elle meurt dans mes livres,\r\n      Douce; feignant de n\'en pas croire encor mes yeux,\r\n    J\'aurai un: "Ah \xc3\xa7\xc3\xa0, mais, nous avions De Quoi vivre!\r\n            C\'\xc3\xa9tait donc s\xc3\xa9rieux?"\r\n\r\nAnd yet one realises, if one but reads him attentively enough, how\r\nmuch suffering and despair, and resignation to what is, after all,\r\nthe inevitable, are hidden away under this disguise, and also why this\r\ndisguise is possible. Laforgue died at twenty-seven: he had been a\r\ndying man all his life, and his work has the fatal evasiveness of those\r\nwho shrink from remembering the one thing which they are unable to\r\nforget. Coming as he does after Rimbaud, turning the divination of the\r\nother into theories, into achieved results, he is the eternally grown\r\nup, mature to the point of self-negation, as the other is the eternal\r\n_enfant terrible._ He thinks intensely about life, seeing what is\r\nautomatic, pathetically ludicrous in it, almost as one might who has no\r\npart in the comedy. He has the double advantage, for his art, of being\r\ncondemned to death, and of being, in the admirable phrase of Villiers,\r\n"one of those who come into the world with a ray of moonlight in their\r\nbrains."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAETERLINCK AS A MYSTIC\r\n\r\n\r\nThe secret of things which is just beyond the most subtle words,\r\nthe secret of the expressive silences, has always been clearer to\r\nMaeterlinck than to most people; and, in his plays, he has elaborated\r\nan art of sensitive, taciturn, and at the same time highly ornamental\r\nsimplicity, which has come nearer than any other art to being the voice\r\nof silence. To Maeterlinck the theatre has been, for the most part,\r\nno more than one of the disguises by which he can express himself,\r\nand with his book of meditations on the inner life, _Le Tr\xc3\xa9sor des\r\nHumbles,_ he may seem to have dropped his disguise.\r\n\r\nAll art hates the vague; not the mysterious, but the vague; two\r\nopposites very commonly confused, as the secret with the obscure, the\r\ninfinite with the indefinite. And the artist who is also a mystic\r\nhates the vague with a more profound hatred than any other artist.\r\nThus Maeterlinck, endeavouring to clothe mystical conceptions in\r\nconcrete form, has invented a drama so precise, so curt, so arbitrary\r\nin its limits, that it can safely be confided to the masks and feigned\r\nvoices of marionettes. His theatre of artificial beings, who are at\r\nonce more ghostly and more mechanical than the living actors whom we\r\nare accustomed to see, in so curious a parody of life, moving with a\r\ncertain freedom of action across the stage, may be taken as itself a\r\nsymbol of the aspect under which what we fantastically term "real life"\r\npresents itself to the mystic. Are we not all puppets, in a theatre\r\nof marionettes, in which the parts we play, the dresses we wear, the\r\nvery emotion whose dominance gives its express form to our faces, have\r\nall been chosen for us; in which I, it may be, with curled hair and a\r\nSpanish cloak, play the romantic lover, sorely against my will, while\r\nyou, a "fair penitent" for no repented sin, pass quietly under a nun\'s\r\nhabit? And as our parts have been chosen for us, cur motions controlled\r\nfrom behind the curtain, so the words we seem to speak are but spoken\r\nthrough us, and we do but utter fragments of some elaborate invention,\r\nplanned for larger ends than our personal display or convenience,\r\nbut to which, all the same, we are in a humble degree necessary.\r\nThis symbolical theatre, its very existence being a symbol, has\r\nperplexed many minds, to some of whom it has seemed puerile, a child\'s\r\nmystification of small words and repetitions, a thing of attitudes\r\nand omissions; while others, yet more unwisely, have compared it with\r\nthe violent, rhetorical, most human drama of the Elizabethans, with\r\nShakespeare himself, to whom all the world was a stage, and the stage\r\nall this world, certainly. A sentence, already famous, of the _Tr\xc3\xa9sor\r\ndes Humbles,_ will tell you what it signifies to Maeterlinck himself.\r\n\r\n"I have, come to believe," he writes, in _Le Tragique Quotidien,_ "that\r\nan old man seated in his armchair, waiting quietly under the lamplight,\r\nlistening without knowing it to all the eternal laws which reign about\r\nhis house, interpreting without understanding it all that there is in\r\nthe silence of doors and windows, and in the little voice of light,\r\nenduring the presence of his soul and of his destiny, bowing his head a\r\nlittle, without suspecting that all the powers of the earth intervene\r\nand stand on guard in the room like attentive servants, not knowing\r\nthat the sun itself suspends above the abyss the little table on which\r\nhe rests his elbow, and that there is not a star in the sky nor a force\r\nin the soul which is indifferent to the motion of a falling eyelid or\r\na rising thought--I have come to believe that this motionless old man\r\nlived really a more profound, human, and universal life than the lover\r\nwho strangles his mistress, the captain who gains a victory, or the\r\nhusband who \'avenges his honour.\'"\r\n\r\nThat, it seems to me, says all there is to be said of the intention of\r\nthis drama which Maeterlinck has evoked; and, of its style, this other\r\nsentence, which I take from the same essay: "It is only the words that\r\nat first sight seem useless which really count in a work."\r\n\r\nThis drama, then, is a drama founded on philosophical ideas,\r\napprehended emotionally; on the sense of the mystery of the universe,\r\nof the weakness of humanity, that sense which Pascal expressed when\r\nhe said: _Ce qui m\'\xc3\xa9tonne le plus est de voir que tout le monde n\'est\r\npas \xc3\xa9tonn\xc3\xa9 de sa faiblesse;_ with an acute feeling of the pathetic\r\nignorance in which the souls nearest to one another look out upon\r\ntheir neighbours. It is a drama in which the interest is concentrated\r\non vague people, who are little parts of the universal consciousness,\r\ntheir strange names being but the pseudonyms of obscure passions,\r\nintimate emotions. They have the fascination which we find in the eyes\r\nof certain pictures, so much more real and disquieting, so much more\r\npermanent with us, than living people. And they have the touching\r\nsimplicity of children; they are always children in their ignorance\r\nof themselves, of one another, and of fate. And, because they are so\r\ndisembodied of the more trivial accidents of life, they give themselves\r\nwithout limitation to whatever passionate instinct possesses them. I\r\ndo not know a more passionate love-scene than that scene in the wood\r\nbeside the fountain, where Pell\xc3\xa9as and M\xc3\xa9lisande confess the strange\r\nburden which has come upon them. When the soul gives itself absolutely\r\nto love, all the barriers of the world are burnt away, and all its\r\nwisdom and subtlety are as incense poured on a flame. Morality, too,\r\nis burnt away, no longer exists, any more than it does for children or\r\nfor God.\r\n\r\nMaeterlinck has realised, better than any one else, the significance,\r\nin life and art, of mystery. He has realised how unsearchable is the\r\ndarkness out of which we have but just stepped, and the darkness\r\ninto which we are about to pass. And he has realised how the thought\r\nand sense of that twofold darkness invade the little space of light\r\nin which, for a moment, we move; the depth to which they shadow our\r\nsteps, even in that moment\'s partial escape. But in some of his plays\r\nhe would seem to have apprehended this mystery as a thing merely or\r\nmainly terrifying; the actual physical darkness sur-rounding blind men,\r\nthe actual physical approach of death as the intruder; he has shown\r\nus people huddled at a window, out of which they are almost afraid\r\nto look, or beating at a door, the opening of which they dread. Fear\r\nshivers through these plays, creeping across our nerves like a damp\r\nmist coiling up out of a valley. And there is beauty, certainly, in\r\nthis "vague spiritual fear"; but a less obvious kind of beauty than\r\nthat which gives its profound pathos to _Aglavaine et S\xc3\xa9lysette,_ the\r\none play written since the writing of the essays. Here is mystery,\r\nwhich is also pure beauty, in these delicate approaches of intellectual\r\npathos, in which suffering and death and error become transformed into\r\nsomething almost happy, so full is it of strange light.\r\n\r\nAnd the aim of Maeterlinck, in his plays, is not only to render the\r\nsoul and the soul\'s atmosphere, but to reveal this strangeness, pity,\r\nand beauty through beautiful pictures. No dramatist has ever been so\r\ncareful that his scenes should be in themselves beautiful, or has\r\nmade the actual space of forest, tower, or seashore so emotionally\r\nsignificant. He has realised, after Wagner, that the art of the stage\r\nis the art of pictorial beauty, of the correspondence in rhythm between\r\nthe speakers, their words, and their surroundings. He has seen how, in\r\nthis way, and in this way alone, the emotion, which it is but a part of\r\nthe poetic drama to express, can be at once intensified and purified.\r\n\r\nIt is only after hinting at many of the things which he had to say\r\nin these plays, which have, after all, been a kind of subterfuge,\r\nthat Maeterlinck has cared, or been able, to speak with the direct\r\nutterance of the essays. And what may seem curious is that this prose\r\nof the essays, which is the prose of a doctrine, is incomparably more\r\nbeautiful than the prose of the plays, which was the prose of an art.\r\nHolding on this point a different opinion from one who was, in many\r\nsenses, his master, Villiers de l\'Isle-Adam, he did not admit that\r\nbeauty of words, or even any expressed beauty of thoughts, had its\r\nplace in spoken dialogue, even though it was not two living actors\r\nspeaking to one another on the stage, but a soul speaking to a soul and\r\nimagined speaking through the mouths of marionettes. But that beauty of\r\nphrase which makes the profound and sometimes obscure pages of _Ax\xc3\xabl_\r\nshine as with the crossing fire of jewels, rejoices us, though with\r\na softer, a more equable, radiance, in the pages of these essays, in\r\nwhich every sentence has the in-dwelling beauty of an intellectual\r\nemotion, preserved at the same height of tranquil ecstasy from first\r\npage to last. There is a sort of religious calm in these deliberate\r\nsentences, into which the writer has known how to introduce that divine\r\nmonotony which is one of the accomplishments of great style. Never has\r\nsimplicity been more ornate or a fine beauty more visible through its\r\nself-concealment.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the claim upon us of this book is not the claim of\r\na work of art, but of a doctrine, and more than that, of a system.\r\nBelonging, as he does, to the eternal hierarchy, the unbroken\r\nsuccession, of the mystics, Maeterlinck has apprehended what is\r\nessential in the mystical doctrine with a more profound comprehension,\r\nand thus more systematically, than any mystic of recent times. He\r\nhas many points of resemblance with Emerson, on whom he has written\r\nan essay which is properly an exposition of his own personal ideas;\r\nbut Emerson, who proclaimed the supreme guidance of the inner light,\r\nthe supreme necessity of trusting instinct, of honouring emotion, did\r\nbut proclaim all this, not without a certain anti-mystical vagueness:\r\nMaeterlinck has systematised it. A more profound mystic than Emerson,\r\nhe has greater command of that which comes to him unawares, is less at\r\nthe mercy of visiting angels.\r\n\r\nAlso, it may be said that he surrenders himself to them more\r\nabsolutely, with less reserve and discretion; and, as he has infinite\r\nleisure, his contemplation being subject to no limits of time, he\r\nis ready to follow them on unknown rounds, to any distance, in any\r\ndirection, ready also to rest in any wayside inn, without fearing that\r\nhe will have lost the road on the morrow.\r\n\r\nThis old gospel, of which Maeterlinck is the new voice, has been\r\nquietly waiting until certain bankruptcies, the bankruptcy of\r\nScience, of the Positive Philosophies, should allow it full credit.\r\nConsidering the length even of time, it has not had an unreasonable\r\nspace of waiting; and remember that it takes time but little into\r\naccount. We have seen many little gospels demanding of every emotion,\r\nof every instinct, "its certificate at the hand of some respectable\r\nauthority." Without confidence in themselves or in things, and led by\r\nScience, which is as if one were led by one\'s note-book, they demand a\r\nreasonable explanation of every mystery. Not finding that explanation,\r\nthey reject the mystery; which is as if the fly on the wheel rejected\r\nthe wheel because it was hidden from his eyes by the dust of its own\r\nraising.\r\n\r\nThe mystic is at once the proudest and the humblest of men. He is as\r\na child who resigns himself to the guidance of an unseen hand, the\r\nhand of one walking by his side; he resigns himself with the child\'s\r\nhumility. And he has the pride of the humble, a pride manifesting\r\nitself in the calm rejection of every accepted map of the roads, of\r\nevery offer of assistance, of every painted signpost pointing out the\r\nsmoothest ways on which to travel. He demands no authority for the\r\nunseen hand whose fingers he feels upon his wrist. He conceives of\r\nlife, not, indeed, so much as a road on which one walks, very much at\r\none\'s own discretion, but as a blown and wandering ship, surrounded by\r\na sea from which there is no glimpse of land; and he conceives that to\r\nthe currents of that sea he may safely trust himself. Let his hand,\r\nindeed, be on the rudder, there will be no miracle worked for him; it\r\nis enough miracle that the sea should be there, and the ship, and he\r\nhimself. He will never know why his hand should turn the rudder this\r\nway rather than that.\r\n\r\nJacob Boehme has said, very subtly, "that man does not perceive the\r\ntruth but God perceives the truth in man"; that is, that whatever\r\nwe perceive or do is not perceived or done consciously by us, but\r\nunconsciously through us. Our business, then, is to tend that "inner\r\nlight" by which most mystics have symbolised that which at once\r\nguides us in time and attaches us to eternity. This inner light is\r\nno miraculous descent of the Holy Spirit, but the perfectly natural,\r\nthough it may finally be overcoming, ascent of the spirit within us.\r\nThe spirit, in all men, being but a ray of the universal fight, it can,\r\nby careful tending, by the removal of all obstruction, the cleansing of\r\nthe vessel, the trimming of the wick, as it were, be increased, made\r\nto burn with a steadier, a brighter flame. In the last rapture it may\r\nbecome dazzling, may blind the watcher with excess of light, shutting\r\nhim in within the circle of transfiguration, whose extreme radiance\r\nwill leave all the rest of the world henceforth one darkness.\r\n\r\nAll mystics being concerned with what is divine in life, with the\r\nlaws which apply equally to time and eternity, it may happen to one to\r\nconcern himself chiefly with time seen under the aspect of eternity, to\r\nanother to concern himself rather with eternity seen under the aspect\r\nof time. Thus many mystics have occupied themselves, very profitably,\r\nwith showing how natural, how explicable on their own terms, are\r\nthe mysteries of life; the whole aim of Maeterlinck is to show how\r\nmysterious all life is, "what an astonishing thing it is, merely to\r\nlive." What he had pointed out to us, with certain solemn gestures,\r\nin his plays, he sets himself now to affirm, slowly, fully, with that\r\n"confidence in mystery" of which he speaks. Because "there is not an\r\nhour without its familiar miracles and its ineffable suggestions," he\r\nsets himself to show us these miracles and these meanings where others\r\nhave not always sought or found them, in women, in children, in the\r\ntheatre. He seems to touch, at one moment or another, whether he is\r\ndiscussing _La Beaut\xc3\xa9 Int\xc3\xa9rieure_ or _Le Tragique Quotidien,_ on all\r\nof these hours, and there is no hour so dark that his touch does not\r\nilluminate it.\r\n\r\nAnd it is characteristic of him, of his "confidence in mystery,"\r\nthat he speaks always without raising his voice, without surprise or\r\ntriumph, or the air of having said anything more than the simplest\r\nobservation. He speaks, not as if he knew more than others, or had\r\nsought out more elaborate secrets, but as if he had listened more\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\nLoving most those writers "whose works are nearest to silence,"\r\nhe begins his book, significantly, with an essay on Silence, an\r\nessay which, like all these essays, has the reserve, the expressive\r\nreticence, of those "active silences" of which he succeeds in revealing\r\na few of the secrets. "Souls," he tells us, "are weighed in silence,\r\nas gold and silver are weighed in pure water, and the words which we\r\npronounce have no meaning except through the silence in which they are\r\nbathed. We seek to know that we may learn not to know"; knowledge, that\r\nwhich can be known by the pure reason, metaphysics, "indispensable"\r\non this side of the "frontiers," being after all precisely what is\r\nleast essential to us, since least essentially ourselves. "We possess\r\na self more profound and more boundless than the self of the passions\r\nor of pure reason.... There comes a moment when the phenomena of our\r\ncustomary consciousness, what we may call the consciousness of the\r\npassions or of our normal relationships, no longer mean anything to\r\nus, no longer touch our real life. I admit that this consciousness is\r\noften interesting in its way, and that it is often necessary to know\r\nit thoroughly. But it is a surface plant, and its roots fear the great\r\ncentral fire of our being. I may commit a crime without the least\r\nbreath stirring the tiniest flame of this fire; and, on the other hand,\r\nthe crossing of a single glance, a thought which never comes into\r\nbeing, a minute which passes without the utterance of a word, may rouse\r\nit into terrible agitations in the depths of its retreat, and cause\r\nit to overflow upon my life. Our soul does not judge as we judge; it\r\nis a capricious and hidden thing. It can be reached by a breath and\r\nunconscious of a tempest. Let us find out what reaches it; everything\r\nis there, for it is there that we ourselves are."\r\n\r\nAnd it is towards this point that all the words of this book tend.\r\nMaeterlinck, unlike most men ("What is man but a God who is afraid?"),\r\nis not "miserly of immortal things." He utters the most divine secrets\r\nwithout fear, betraying certain hiding-places of the soul in those most\r\nnearly inaccessible retreats which lie nearest to us. All that he says\r\nwe know already; we may deny it, but we know it. It is what we are not\r\noften at leisure enough with ourselves, sincere enough with ourselves,\r\nto realise; what we often dare not realise; but, when he says it, we\r\nknow that it is true, and our knowledge of it is his warrant for saying\r\nit. He is what he is precisely because he tells us nothing which we do\r\nnot already know, or it may be, what we have known and forgotten. The\r\nmystic, let it be remembered, has nothing in common with the moralist.\r\nHe speaks only to those who are already prepared to listen to him, and\r\nhe is indifferent to the "practical" effect which these or others may\r\ndraw from his words. A young and profound mystic of our day has figured\r\nthe influence of wise words upon the foolish and headstrong as "torches\r\nthrown into a burning city." The mystic knows well that it is not\r\nalways the soul of the drunkard or the blasphemer which is farthest\r\nfrom the eternal beauty. He is concerned only with that soul of the\r\nsoul, that life of life, with which the day\'s doings have so little to\r\ndo; itself a mystery, and at home only among those supreme mysteries\r\nwhich surround it like an atmosphere. It is not always that he cares\r\nthat his message, or his vision, may be as clear to others as it is\r\nto himself. But, because he is an artist, and not only a philosopher,\r\nMaeterlinck has taken especial pains that not a word of his may go\r\nastray, and there is not a word of this book which needs to be read\r\ntwice, in order that it may be understood, by the least trained of\r\nattentive readers. It is, indeed, as he calls it, "The Treasure of the\r\nLowly."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nOur only chance, in this world, of a complete happiness, lies in the\r\nmeasure of our success in shutting the eyes of the mind, and deadening\r\nits sense of hearing, and dulling the keenness of its apprehension of\r\nthe unknown. Knowing so much less than nothing, for we are entrapped\r\nin smiling and many-coloured appearances, our life may seem to be but\r\na little space of leisure, in which it will be the necessary business\r\nof each of us to speculate on what is so rapidly becoming the past\r\nand so rapidly becoming the future, that scarcely existing present\r\nwhich is after all our only possession. Yet, as the present passes\r\nfrom us, hardly to be enjoyed except as memory or as hope, and only\r\nwith an at best partial recognition of the uncertainty or inutility\r\nof both, it is with a kind of terror that we wake up, every now and\r\nthen, to the whole knowledge of our ignorance, and to some perception\r\nof where it is leading us. To live through a single day with that\r\noverpowering consciousness of our real position, which, in the moments\r\nin which alone it mercifully comes, is like blinding light or the\r\nthrust of a flaming sword, would drive any man out of his senses. It\r\nis our hesitations, the excuses of our hearts, the compromises of\r\nour intelligence, which save us. We can forget so much, we can bear\r\nsuspense with so fortunate an evasion of its real issues; we are so\r\nadmirably finite.\r\n\r\nAnd so there is a great, silent conspiracy between us to forget death;\r\nall our lives are spent in busily forgetting death. That is why we\r\nare active about so many things which we know to be unimportant; why\r\nwe are so afraid of solitude, and so thankful for the company of our\r\nfellow-creatures. Allowing ourselves, for the most part, to be but\r\nvaguely conscious of that great suspense in which we live, we find\r\nour escape from its sterile, annihilating reality in many dreams,\r\nin religion, passion, art; each a forgetfulness, each a symbol of\r\ncreation; religion being the creation of a new heaven, passion the\r\ncreation of a new earth, and art, in its mingling of heaven and\r\nearth, the creation of heaven out of earth. Each is a kind of sublime\r\nselfishness, the saint, the lover, and the artist having each an\r\nincommunicable ecstasy which he esteems as his ultimate attainment,\r\nhowever, in his lower moments, he may serve God in action, or do the\r\nwill of his mistress, or minister to men by showing them a little\r\nbeauty. But it is, before all things, an escape: and the prophets\r\nwho have redeemed the world, and the artists who have made the world\r\nbeautiful, and the lovers who have quickened the pulses of the world,\r\nhave really, whether they knew it or not, been fleeing from the\r\ncertainty of one thought: that we have, all of us, only our one day;\r\nand from the dread of that other thought: that the day, however used,\r\nmust after all be wasted.\r\n\r\nThe fear of death is not cowardice; it is, rather, an intellectual\r\ndissatisfaction with an enigma which has been presented to us, and\r\nwhich can be solved only when its solution is of no further use. All\r\nwe have to ask of death is the meaning of life, and we are waiting\r\nall through life to ask that question. That life should be happy or\r\nunhappy, as those words are used, means so very little; and the\r\nheightening or lessening of the general felicity of the world means\r\nso little to any individual. There is something almost vulgar in\r\nhappiness which does not become joy, and joy is an ecstasy which can\r\nrarely be maintained in the soul for more than the moment during which\r\nwe recognize that it is not sorrow. Only very young people want to be\r\nhappy. What we all want is to be quite sure that there is something\r\nwhich makes it worth while to go on living, in what seems to us our\r\nbest way, at our finest intensity; something beyond the mere fact that\r\nwe are satisfying a sort of inner logic (which may be quite faulty)\r\nand that we get our best makeshift for happiness on that so hazardous\r\nassumption.\r\n\r\nWell, the doctrine of Mysticism, with which all this symbolical\r\nliterature has so much to do, of which it is all so much the\r\nexpression, presents us, not with a guide for conduct, not with a plan\r\nfor our happiness, not with an explanation of any mystery, but with a\r\ntheory of life which makes us familiar with mystery, and which seems to\r\nharmonise those instincts which make for religion, passion, and art,\r\nfreeing us at once of a great bondage. The final uncertainty remains,\r\nbut we seem to knock less helplessly at closed doors, coming so much\r\ncloser to the once terrifying eternity of things about us, as we come\r\nto look upon these things as shadows, through which we have our shadowy\r\npassage. "For in the particular acts of human life," Plotinus tells us,\r\n"it is not the interior soul and the true man, but the exterior shadow\r\nof the man alone, which laments and weeps, performing his part on the\r\nearth as in a more ample and extended scene, in which many shadows\r\nof souls and phantom scenes appear." And as we realise the identity\r\nof a poem, a prayer, or a kiss, in that spiritual universe which we\r\nare weaving for ourselves, each out of a thread of the great fabric;\r\nas we realise the infinite insignificance of action, its immense\r\ndistance from the current of life; as we realise the delight of feeling\r\nourselves carried onward by forces which it is our wisdom to obey; it\r\nis at least with a certain relief that we turn to an ancient doctrine,\r\nso much the more likely to be true because it has so much the air of\r\na dream. On this theory alone does all life become worth living, all\r\nart worth making, all worship worth offering. And because it might\r\nslay as well as save, because the freedom of its sweet captivity might\r\nso easily become deadly to the fool, because that is the hardest path\r\nto walk in where you are told only, walk well; it is perhaps the only\r\ncounsel of perfection which can ever really mean much to the artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY AND NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe essays contained in this book are not intended to give information.\r\nThey are concerned with ideas rather than with facts; each is a study\r\nof a problem, only in part a literary one, in which I have endeavoured\r\nto consider writers as personalities under the action of spiritual\r\nforces, or as themselves so many forces. But it has seemed to me that\r\nreaders have a right to demand information in regard to writers who are\r\nso often likely to be unfamiliar to them. I have, therefore, given a\r\nbibliography of the works of each writer with whom I have dealt, and\r\nI have added a number of notes, giving various particulars which I\r\nthink are likely to be useful in fixing more definitely the personal\r\ncharacteristics of these writers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONOR\xc3\x89 DE BALZAC\r\n\r\n(1799-1850)\r\n\r\nLa Com\xc3\xa9die Humaine\r\n\r\n_Sc\xc3\xa8nes de la Vie Priv\xc3\xa9e_\r\n\r\n_Pr\xc3\xa9face.

The first\r\nEnglish translation in verse from Verlaine is Arthur O\'Shaughnessy\'s\r\nrendering of "Clair de Lune" in _F\xc3\xaates Galantes,_ under the title\r\n"Pastel," in _Songs of a Worker,_ 1881. A volume of translations\r\nin verse, _Poems of Verlaine,_ by Gertrude Hall, was published in\r\nAmerica in 1895. In Mr. John Gray\'s _Silverpoints,_ 1893, there are\r\ntranslations of "Parsifal," "A Crucifix," "Le Chevalier Malheur,"\r\n"Spleen," "Clair de Lune," "Mon Dieu m\'a dit," and "Green."\r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned, there have been many portraits of Verlaine. The\r\nthree portraits drawn on lithographic paper by Mr. Rothenstein, and\r\npublished in 1898, are but the latest, if also among the best, of a\r\nlong series, of which Mr. Rothenstein himself has done two or three\r\nothers, one of which was reproduced in the _Pall Mall Gazette_ in 1894,\r\nwhen Verlaine was in London. M. F. A. Cazals, a young artist who was\r\none of Verlaine\'s most intimate friends, has done I should not like to\r\nsay how many portraits, some of which he has gathered together in a\r\nlittle book, _Paul Verlaine: ses Portraits,_ 1898. There are portraits\r\nin nine of Verlaine\'s own books, several of them by M. Cazals (roughly\r\njotted, expressive notes of moments), one by M. Anquetin (a strong\r\npiece of thinking flesh and blood), and in the _Choix de Po\xc3\xa9sies_ there\r\nis a reproduction of the cloudy, inspired poet of M. Eug\xc3\xa8ne Carri\xc3\xa8re\'s\r\npainting. Another portrait, which I have not seen, but which Verlaine\r\nhimself calls, in the _D\xc3\xa9dicaces, un portrait enfin repos\xc3\xa9,_ was done\r\nby M. Aman-Jean. M. Niederhausern has done a bust in bronze, Mr.\r\nRothenstein a portrait medallion. A new edition of the _Confessions,_\r\n1899, contains a number of sketches; _Verlaine Dessinateur,_ 1896, many\r\nmore; and there are yet others in the extremely objectionable book of\r\nM. Charles Donos, _Verlaine Intime,_ 1898. The _Hommes d\'Aujourd\'hui_\r\ncontains a caricature-portrait, many other portraits have appeared in\r\nFrench and English and German and Italian magazines, and there is yet\r\nanother portrait in the admirable little book of Charles Morice, _Paul\r\nVerlaine,_ 1888, which contains by far the best study that has ever\r\nbeen made of Verlaine as a poet. I believe Mr. George Moore\'s article,\r\n"A Great Poet," reprinted in _Impressions and Opinions,_ 1891, was the\r\nfirst that was written on Verlaine in England; my own article in the\r\n_National Review_ in 1892 was, I believe, the first detailed study of\r\nthe whole of his work up to that date. At last, in the _Vie de Paul\r\nVerlaine,_ of Edmund Lepelletier, there has come the authentic record.\r\n\r\nAn honest and instructed life of Verlaine has long been wanted, if only\r\nas an antidote to the defamatory production called _Verlaine Intime,_\r\nmade up out of materials collected by the publisher L\xc3\xa9on Vanier in\r\nhis own defense, in order that a hard taskmaster might be presented\r\nto the world in the colours of a benefactor. A "legend" which may\r\nwell have seemed plausible to those who knew Verlaine only at the\r\nend of his life, has obtained currency; and a comparison of Verlaine\r\nwith Villon, not only as a poet (which is to his honour), but also as\r\na man, has been made, and believed. Lepelletier\'s book is an exact\r\nchronicle of a friendship which lasted, without a break, for thirty-six\r\nyears--that is, from the time when Verlaine was sixteen to the time\r\nof his death; and a more sane, loyal and impartial chronicle of any\r\nman\'s life we have never read. It is written with full knowledge of\r\nevery part of the career which it traces; and it is written by a man\r\nwho puts down whatever he knows exactly as he believes it to have\r\nbeen. His conclusion is that "on peut fouiller sa vie au microscope:\r\non y reconna\xc3\xaetra des fautes, des folies, des faiblesses, bien des\r\nsouffrances aussi, avec de la fatalit\xc3\xa9 au fond, pas de honte v\xc3\xa9ritable,\r\npas une vile et indigne action. Les vrais amis du po\xc3\xa8te peuvent donc\r\nrevendiquer pour lui l\'\xc3\xa9pithete d\'honn\xc3\xaate homme, sans doute tr\xc3\xa8s\r\nvulgaire, mais qui, aux yeux de certains, a encore du prix."\r\n\r\nIn 1886 Verlaine dedicated _Les M\xc3\xa9moires d\'un Veuf_ to Lepelletier,\r\naffirming the resolve, on his part, to "garder intacte la vielle amiti\xc3\xa9\r\nsi forte et si belle." The compact has been kept nobly by the survivor.\r\n\r\nIt may, indeed, be questioned whether Lepelletier does not insist a\r\nlittle too much on the bourgeois element which he finds in Verlaine.\r\nWhen a man has suffered under unjust accusations, it is natural for\r\nhis friends to defend him under whatever aspect seems to them most\r\ngenerally convincing. So it is interesting to know that for seven years\r\nVerlaine was in a municipal office, the Bureau des Budgets et Comptes,\r\nand that later, in 1882, he made an application, which was refused,\r\nfor leave to return to his former post. Lepelletier reproaches the\r\nauthorities for an action which he takes to have precipitated Verlaine\r\ninto the final misery of his vagabondage. He would have lived quietly,\r\nhe says, and written in security. Both assumptions may be doubted. What\r\nwas bourgeois, and contented with quiet, was a small part of the nature\r\nof one who was too strong as well as too weak to remain within limits.\r\nThe terrible force of Verlaine\'s weakness would always, in the process\r\nof making him a poet, have carried him far from that "tranquilit\xc3\xa9 d\'une\r\nsin\xc3\xa9cure bureaucratique" which Lepelletier strangely regrets for him.\r\nIt is hardly permitted, in looking back over a disastrous life which\r\nhas expressed itself in notable poetry, to regret that the end should\r\nhave been attained, by no matter what means.\r\n\r\nOn moral questions Lepelletier speaks with the authority of an intimate\r\nfriendship, and from a point of view which seems wholly without\r\nprejudice. He defends Verlaine with evident conviction against the\r\nmost serious charges brought against him, and he shows at least, on\r\ndocumentary evidence, that nothing of the darker part of his "legend"\r\nwas ever proved against him in any of his arrests and imprisonments.\r\nDrink, and mad rages let loose by drink, account, ignobly enough, for\r\nall of them. In the famous quarrel with Rimbaud, which brought him into\r\nprison for eighteen months, the accusation reads:\r\n\r\n"Pour avoir, \xc3\xa0 Bruxelles, le 10 juillet, 1873, volontairement port\xc3\xa9s\r\ndes coups et fait des blessures ayant entra\xc3\xaen\xc3\xa9 une incapacit\xc3\xa9 de\r\ntravail personnel \xc3\xa0 Arthur Rimbaud."\r\n\r\nThe whole account of this episode is given by M. Lepelletier in great\r\ndetail, and from this we learn that it was by the merest change of\r\nmind on the part of Rimbaud, or by sudden treachery, that the matter\r\ncame into the courts at all. Lepelletier supplies an unfavourable\r\naccount of Rimbaud, whom he looks upon as the evil counsellor of\r\nVerlaine--probably with justice. There is little doubt that Rimbaud,\r\napart from his genuine touch of precocious power, which had its\r\ninfluence on the genius of Verlaine, was a "mauvais sujet" of a selfish\r\nand mischievous kind. He was destructive and pitiless; and having done\r\nhis worst, he went off carelessly into Africa.\r\n\r\nIt will surprise some readers to learn that Verlaine took his degree\r\nof "bachelier-\xc3\xa8s-lettres," and that on leaving the Lyc\xc3\xa9e Bonaparte he\r\nreceived a certificate placing him "au nombre des sujets distingu\xc3\xa9s\r\nque compte l\'\xc3\xa9tablissement." He was well grounded in Latin, and fairly\r\nwell in English, and at several intervals in his life attempted to\r\nmaster Spanish, with the vague desire of translating Calderon. At an\r\nearly period he read French literature, classical and modern, with\r\navidity; translations of English, German and Eastern classics; books of\r\ncriticism and philosophy.\r\n\r\n"Il admirait beaucoup Joseph de Ma\xc3\xaestre. _Le Rouge et le Noir_\r\nde Stendhal avait produce sur lui une forte impression. Il avait\r\nd\xc3\xa9nich\xc3\xa9, on ne sait o\xc3\xb9, une Vie de sainte Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se, qu\'il lisait avec\r\nravissement."\r\n\r\nHe was absorbed in Baudelaire, Gautier, Leconte de Lisle, Banville; he\r\nread P\xc3\xa9trus Borel and Aloysius Bertrand. The only poem that remains\r\nof this early period is the "Nocturne Parisien" of the _Po\xc3\xa8mes\r\nSaturniens,_ which dates from about his twentieth year. Jules de\r\nGoncourt defined it as "un beau po\xc3\xa8me sinistre m\xc3\xaalant comme une Morgue\r\n\xc3\xa0 Notre-Dame." Baudelaire, as Sainte-Beuve, in a charming letter of\r\nreal appreciation, pointed out, is here the evident "point de d\xc3\xa9part,\r\npour aller au del\xc3\xa0."\r\n\r\nThe chapter in which Lepelletier tells the story of the origin of the\r\nmost famous literary movement since that of 1830, the "Parnasse," is\r\none of the most entertaining in the book, and gives, in its narrative\r\nof the receptions "chez Nina" (a _salon_ which Lepelletier describes\r\nas the ancestor of the "Chat Noir"), a vivid picture of the days when\r\nVilliers de l\'Isle-Adam and Fran\xc3\xa7ois Copp\xc3\xa9e were beginners together.\r\nNina de Villars was one of the oddest people of her time: she made a\r\nkind of private Bohemia for poets, musicians, all kinds of artists and\r\neccentric people, herself the most eccentric of them all. It was at her\r\nhouse that the members of the "Parnasse" gathered, while they selected\r\nas their more formal meeting-place the _salon_ of Madame Ricard. It is\r\nnot generally known that Verlaine\'s _Po\xc3\xa8mes Saturniens_ was the third\r\nvolume to be issued by the house of Lemerre, afterwards to become a\r\nfamous "publisher of poets," and it was in this volume that the new\r\nlaws of the Parnasse were first formulated--that impassivity, that\r\n"marble egoism," which Verlaine was so soon to reject for a more living\r\nimpulse, but which neither Leconte de Lisle nor H\xc3\xa9redia was ever to\r\nabandon. When one thinks of the later Verlaine, it is curious to turn\r\nto that first formula:\r\n\r\n    Est-elle en marvre o\xc3\xb9 non, le V\xc3\xa9nus de Milo?\r\n\r\nVerlaine\'s verse suddenly becomes human with _La Bonne Chanson,_ though\r\nthe humanity in it is not yet salted as with fire. It is the record of\r\nthe event which, as Lepelletier says, dominated his whole life; the\r\nmarriage with Mathilde Maute, the young girl with whom he had fallen in\r\nlove at first sight, and whose desertion of him, however explicable,\r\nhe never forgot nor forgave. Nothing could be more just or delicate\r\nthan Lepelletier\'s treatment of the whole situation and there is no\r\ndoubt that he is right in saying that the young wife "e\xc3\xbbt une grande\r\nresponsabilit\xc3\xa9 dans les d\xc3\xa9sordres de l\'existence d\xc3\xa9sorbit\xc3\xa9e du po\xc3\xa8te."\r\nVerlaine, as he says, "\xc3\xa9tait bon, aimant, et c\'\xc3\xa9tait comme un souffrant\r\nqu\'il fallait le traiter." "Vous n\'avez rien compris \xc3\xa0 ma simplicit\xc3\xa9,"\r\nhe wrote long afterwards, addressing the woman of whom Lepelletier\r\nsays, "Il l\'aima toujours, il n\'aima qu\'elle."\r\n\r\nWith his marriage Verlaine\'s disasters begin. Rimbaud enters his life\r\nand turns the current of it; the vagabondage begins, in France and\r\nEngland, and the letters written from London are among the most vivid\r\ndocuments in the book: thumbnail sketches full of keen observation.\r\nThen comes his imprisonment and conversion to Catholicism. Here\r\nLepelletier, while he gives us an infinity of details which he alone\r\ncould give, adopts an attitude which we cannot think to be justified,\r\nand which, as a matter of fact, Verlaine protested against during\r\nhis lifetime. "Cette conversion fut-elle profonde et v\xc3\xa9ridique?" he\r\nasks; and he answers, "Je ne le crois pas." That his conversion had\r\nmuch influence on Verlaine\'s conduct cannot be contended, but conduct\r\nand belief are two different things. Sincerity of the moment was his\r\nfundamental characteristic, but the moments made and remade his moods\r\nin their passing. The religion of _Sagesse_ is not the less genuine\r\nbecause that grave and sacred book was followed by the revolt of\r\n_Parall\xc3\xa8ment._ Verlaine tried to explain--in the poems themselves, in\r\nprefaces, and in conversation with friends--how natural it was to sin\r\nand to repent, and to use the same childlike words in the immediate\r\nrendering of sin and of repentance. This _na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9,_ which made any\r\nregular existence an impossibility, was a part of him which gave a\r\nquality to his work unlike that of any other poet of our time. At\r\nthe end of his life hardly anything but the _na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xaa_ was left, and\r\nthe poems became mere outcries and gestures. Lepelletier is justly\r\nindignant at the action of Vanier in publishing after Verlaine\'s\r\ndeaths the collection called _Invectives,_ made up of scraps and\r\nimpromptus which the poet certainly never intended to publish. Here we\r\nsee part of the weakness of a great man, who becomes petty when he puts\r\noff his true character and tries to be angry. "J\'ai la fureur d\'aimer,"\r\nhe says somewhere, and there is no essential part of his work which is\r\nnot the expression of some form of love, grotesque or heroic, human or\r\ndivine.\r\n\r\nOf all this later, more and more miserable part of the life of\r\nVerlaine, Lepelletier has less to tell us. It has been sufficiently\r\ncommented on, not always by friendly or understanding witnesses. What\r\nwe get in this book, for the first time, is a view of the life as a\r\nwhole, with all that is beautiful, tragic, and desperate in it. It is\r\nnot an apology: it is a statement. It not only does honor to a great\r\nand unhappy man of genius; it does him justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJORIS-KARL HUYSMANS\r\n\r\n(1848-1907)\r\n\r\nLe _Drageoir \xc3\xa0 \xc3\xa9pices,_ 1874; _Marthe: Histoire d\'une Fille,_ 1876;\r\n_Les S\xc5\x93urs Vatard,_ 1879; _Croquis Parisiens,_ 1880; _En M\xc3\xa9nage,_\r\n1881; _A Vau-l\'Eau,_ 1882; _L\'Art Moderne,_ 1883; _A Rebours,_ 1884;\r\n_Un Dilemme,_ 1887; _En Rade,_ 1887; _Certains,_1889; _La Bi\xc3\xa8vre,_1890;\r\n_L\xc3\xa0-Bas,_ 1891; _En Route,_ 1895; La _Cath\xc3\xa9drale,_ 1898; _La Bi\xc3\xa8vre\r\nSaint-S\xc3\xa9verin,_ 1898; Pages _Catholiques,_ 1900; Sainte _Lydwine de\r\nSchiedam,_ 1901; De Tout, 1902; L\'Oblat, 1903; Trois _Primitifs,_\r\n1905; Les Foules de _Lourdes,_ 1906; See also the short story, _Sac\r\nau Dos,_ in the _Soir\xc3\xa9es de M\xc3\xa9dan,_ 1880, and the pantomime, _Pierrot\r\nSceptique,_ 1881, in collaboration with L\xc3\xa9on Hennique. _En Route_ was\r\ntranslated into English by Mr. Kegan Paul, in 1896; and _La Cath\xc3\xa9drale_\r\nby Miss Clara Bell, in 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR RIMBAUD\r\n\r\n(1854-1891)\r\n\r\n_Une Saison en Enfer,_ 1873; _Les Illuminations,_ 1886; _Reliquaire,_\r\n1891 (containing several poems falsely attributed to Rimbaud); _Les\r\nIlluminations: Une Saison en Enfer,_ 1892; _Po\xc3\xa9sies Compl\xc3\xa8tes,_ 1895;\r\n_\xc5\x92uvres,_ 1898.\r\n\r\nSee also Paterne Berrichon, _La Vie de Jean-Arthur Rimbaud,_ 1898,\r\nand _Lettres de Jean-Arthur Rimbaud,_ 1899; Paul Verlaine, _Les\r\nPo\xc3\xa8tes Maudits,_1884, and the biography by Verlaine in _Les Hommes\r\nd\'Aujourd\'hui._ Mr. George Moore was the first to write about\r\nRimbaud in England, in "Two Unknown Poets" (Rimbaud and Laforgue) in\r\n_Impressions and Opinions,_ 1891.

Maeterlinck has had the good or bad fortune to be more promptly,\r\nand more violently, praised at the beginning of his career than at all\r\nevents any other writer of whom I have spoken in this volume. His fame\r\nin France was made by a flaming article of M. Octave Mirbeau in the\r\n_Figaro_ of August 24, 1890. M. Mirbeau greeted him as the "Belgian\r\nShakepeare," and expressed his opinion of _La Princesse Maleine_ by\r\nsaying "M. Maeterlinck has given us the greatest work of genius that\r\nhas been produced in our time, and the most extraordinary and the most\r\nna\xc3\xafve too, comparable (dare I say?) superior in beauty to what is\r\nmost beautiful in Shakespeare ... more tragic than _Macbeth,_ more\r\nextraordinary in thought than _Hamlet."_ Mr. William Archer introduced\r\nM. Maeterlinck to England in an article called "A Pessimist Playwright"\r\nin the _Fortnightly Review,_ September, 1891. Less enthusiastic than\r\nM. Mirbeau, he defined the author of _La Princesse Maleine_ as "a\r\nWebster who had read Alfred de Musset." A freely adapted version of\r\n_L\'Intruse_ was given by Mr. Tree at the Haymarket Theatre, January\r\n27, 1892, and since that time many of M. Maeterlinck\'s plays have been\r\nacted, without cuts, or with but few cuts, at various London theatres.\r\nSeveral of his books have also been translated into English: _The\r\nPrincesse Maleine_ (by Gerard Harry) and _The Intruder_ (by William\r\nWilson), 1892; _Pell\xc3\xa9as and M\xc3\xa9lisande_ and _The Sightless_ (by Laurence\r\nAlma-Tadema), 1892; _Ruysbroeck and the Mystics_ (by J. T. Stoddart),\r\n1894; _The Treasure of the Humble_ (by A. Sutro), 1897; _Aglavaine and\r\nS\xc3\xa9lysette_ (by A. Sutro), 1897; _Wisdom and Destiny_ (by A. Sutro),\r\n1898; _Alladine and Palomides_ (by A. Sutro), _Interior_ (by William\r\nArcher), and _The Death of Tintagiles_ (by A. Sutro), 1899.\r\n\r\nI have spoken, in this volume, chiefly of Maeterlinck\'s essays, and\r\nbut little of his plays, and I have said all that I had to say without\r\nspecial reference to the second volume of essays, _La Sagesse et la\r\nDestin\xc3\xa9e._ Like _Le Tr\xc3\xa9sor des Humbles,_ that book is a message, a\r\ndoctrine, even more than it is a piece of literature. It is a treatise\r\non wisdom and happiness, on the search for happiness because it is\r\nwisdom, not for wisdom because it is happiness. It is a book of patient\r\nand resigned philosophy, a very Flemish philosophy, more resigned than\r\neven _Le Tr\xc3\xa9sor des Humbles._ In a sense it seems to aim less high.\r\nAn ecstatic mysticism has given way to a kind of prudence. Is this\r\ncoming nearer to the earth really an intellectual ascent or descent?\r\nAt least it is a divergence, and it probably indicates a divergence in\r\nart as well as in meditation. Yet, while it is quite possible to at\r\nleast indicate Maeterlinck\'s position as a philosopher, it seems to me\r\npremature to attempt to define his position as a dramatist. Interesting\r\nas his dramatic work has always been, there is, in the later dramas,\r\nso singular an advance in all the qualities that go to make great\r\nart, that I find it impossible at this stage of his development,\r\nto treat his dramatic work as in any sense the final expression of\r\na personality. What the next stage of his development may be it is\r\nimpossible to say. He will not write more beautiful dramas than he has\r\nwritten in _Aglavaine et S\xc3\xa9lysette_ and in _Pell\xc3\xa9as et M\xc3\xaalisande._\r\nBut he may, and he probably will, write something which will move\r\nthe general world more profoundly, touching it more closely, in the\r\nmanner of the great writers, in whom beauty has not been more beautiful\r\nthan in writers less great, but has come to men with a more splendid\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From St\xc3\xa9phane Mallarm\xc3\xa9_\r\n\r\n\r\n    I.

Know\'st not a land\r\n    Where, in the pestilent sky, men see the hand\r\n    Of Venus, and her shadow in dark leaves?\r\n    Thither I go.\r\n    Light thou the wax that grieves\r\n    In the swift flame, and sheds an alien tear\r\n    Over the vain gold; wilt not say in mere\r\n    Childishness?\r\n\r\n    Nurse.\r\n    Now?\r\n\r\n    Herodiade.\r\n    Farewell.

SIGH\r\n\r\n    My soul, calm sister, towards thy brow, whereon scarce grieves\r\n    An autumn strewn already with its russet leaves,\r\n    And towards the wandering sky of thine angelic eyes,\r\n    Mounts, as in melancholy gardens may arise\r\n    Some faithful fountain sighing whitely towards the blue!\r\n    Towards the blue pale and pure that sad October knew,\r\n    When, in those depths, it mirrored languors infinit\xc3\xa9,\r\n    And agonising leaves upon the waters white,\r\n    Windily drifting, traced a furrow cold and dun,\r\n    Where, in one long last ray, lingered the yellow sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n    III. SEA-WIND\r\n\r\n    The flesh is sad, alas! and all the books are read.\r\n    Flight, only flight! I feel that birds are wild to tread\r\n    The floor of unknown foam, and to attain the skies!\r\n    Nought, neither ancient gardens mirrored in the eyes,\r\n    Shall hold this heart that bathes in waters its delight,\r\n    O nights! nor yet my waking lamp, whose lonely light\r\n    Shadows the  vacant paper, whiteness profits best,\r\n    Nor the young wife who rocks her baby on her breast.\r\n    I will depart! O steamer, swaying rope and spar,\r\n    Lift anchor for exotic lands that lie afar!\r\n    A weariness, outworn by cruel hopes, still clings\r\n    To the last farewell handkerchief\'s last beckonings!\r\n    And are not these, the masts inviting storms, not these\r\n    That an awakening wind bends over wrecking seas,\r\n    Lost, not a sail, a sail, a flowering isle, ere long?\r\n    But, O my heart, hear thou, hear thou the sailors\' song!\r\n\r\n\r\n    IV. ANGUISH\r\n\r\n    To-night I do not come to conquer thee,\r\n    O Beast that dost the sins of the whole world bear,\r\n    Nor with my kisses\' weary misery\r\n    Wake a sad tempest in thy wanton hair;\r\n    It is that heavy and that dreamless sleep\r\n    I ask of the close curtains of thy bed,\r\n    Which, after all thy treacheries, folds thee deep,\r\n    Who knowest oblivion better than the dead.\r\n    For Vice, that gnaws with keener tooth than Time,\r\n    Brands me as thee, of barren conquest proud;\r\n    But while thou guardest in thy breast of stone\r\n    A heart that fears no fang of any crime,\r\n    I wander palely, haunted by my shroud,\r\n    Fearing to die if I but sleep alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Paul Verlaine: F\xc3\xaates Galantes_\r\n\r\n    I.

DANS LA GROTTE\r\n\r\n    Stay, let me die, since I am true,\r\n    For my distress will not delay,\r\n    And the Hyrcanian tigress ravening for prey\r\n    Is as a little lamb to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Yes, here within, cruel Clym\xc3\xa8ne,\r\n    This steel which in how many wars\r\n    How many a Cyrus slew, or Scipio, now prepares\r\n    To end my life and end my pain.\r\n\r\n    But nay, what need of steel have I\r\n    To haste my passage to the shades?\r\n    Did not Love pierce my heart, beyond all mortal aids,\r\n    With the first arrow of your eye?\r\n\r\n\r\n    VII. LES INGENUS\r\n\r\n    High heels and long skirts intercepting them,\r\n    So that, according to the wind or way,\r\n    An ankle peeped and vanished as in play;\r\n    And well we loved the malice of the game.\r\n\r\n    Sometimes an insect with its jealous sting\r\n    Some fair one\'s whiter neck disquieted,\r\n    From which the gleams of sudden whiteness shed\r\n    Met in our eyes a frolic welcoming.\r\n\r\n    The stealthy autumn evening faded out,\r\n    And the fair creatures dreaming by our side\r\n    Words of such subtle savour to us sighed\r\n    That since that time our souls tremble and doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n    VIII. CORT\xc3\x88GE\r\n\r\n    A silver-vested monkey trips\r\n    And pirouettes before the face\r\n    Of one who twists a kerchief\'s lace\r\n    Between her well-gloved finger-tips.\r\n\r\n    A little negro, a red elf,\r\n    Carries her dropping train, and holds\r\n    At arm\'s length all the heavy folds,\r\n    Watching each fold displace itself.\r\n\r\n    The monkey never lets his eyes\r\n    Wander from the fair woman\'s breast,\r\n    White wonder that to be possessed\r\n    Would call a god out of the skies.\r\n\r\n    Sometimes the little negro seems\r\n    To lift his sumptuous burden up\r\n    Higher than need be, in the hope\r\n    Of seeing what all night he dreams.\r\n\r\n    She goes by corridor and stair,\r\n    Still to the insolent appeals\r\n    Of her familiar animals\r\n    Indifferent or unaware.\r\n\r\n\r\n    IX. LES COQUILLAGES\r\n\r\n    Each shell incrusted in the grot\r\n    Where we two loved each other well\r\n    An aspect of its own has got.\r\n\r\n    The purple of a purple shell\r\n    Is our souls\' colour when they make\r\n    Our burning heart\'s blood visible.\r\n\r\n    This pallid shell affects to take\r\n    Thy languors, when thy love-tired eyes\r\n    Rebuke me for my mockery\'s sake.\r\n\r\n    This counterfeits the harmonies\r\n    Of thy pink ear, and this might be\r\n    Thy plump short nape with rosy dyes.\r\n\r\n    But one, among these, troubled me.\r\n\r\n\r\n    X. EN PATINANT\r\n\r\n    We were the victims, you and I,\r\n    Madame, of mutual self deceits;\r\n    And that which set our brains awry\r\n    May well have been the summer heats.\r\n\r\n    And the spring too, if I recall,\r\n    Contributed to spoil our play,\r\n    And yet its share, I think, was small\r\n    In leading you and me astray.\r\n\r\n    For air in springtime is so fresh\r\n    That rose-buds Love has surely meant\r\n    To match the roses of the flesh\r\n    Have odours almost innocent;\r\n\r\n    And even the lilies that outpour\r\n    Their biting odours where the sun\r\n    Is new in heaven, do but the more\r\n    Enliven and enlighten one,\r\n\r\n    So stealthily the zephyr blows\r\n    A mocking breath that renders back\r\n    The heart\'s rest and the soul\'s repose\r\n    And the flower\'s aphrodisiac,\r\n\r\n    And the five senses, peeping out,\r\n    Take up their station at the feast,\r\n    But, being by themselves, without\r\n    Troubling the reason in the least.\r\n\r\n    That was the time of azure skies,\r\n    (Madame, do you remember it?)\r\n    And sonnets to my lady\'s eyes,\r\n    And cautious kisses not too sweet.\r\n\r\n    Free from all passion\'s idle pother,\r\n    Full of mere kindliness, how long,\r\n    How well we liked not loved each other,\r\n    Without one rapture or one wrong!\r\n\r\n    Ah, happy hours! But summer came:\r\n    Farewell, fresh breezes of the spring!\r\n    A wind of pleasure like a flame\r\n    Leapt on our senses wondering.\r\n\r\n    Strange flowers, fair crimson-hearted flowers\r\n    Poured their ripe odours over us,\r\n    And evil voices of the hours\r\n    Whispered above us in the boughs.\r\n\r\n    We yielded to it all, ah me!\r\n    What vertigo of fools held fast\r\n    Our senses in its ecstasy\r\n    Until the heat of summer passed?\r\n\r\n    There were vain tears and vainer laughter,\r\n    And hands indefinitely pressed,\r\n    Moist sadnesses, and swoonings after,\r\n    And what vague void within the breast?\r\n\r\n    But autumn came to our relief,\r\n    Its light grown cold, its gusts grown rough,\r\n    Came to remind us, sharp and brief,\r\n    That we had wantoned long enough,\r\n\r\n    And led us quickly to recover\r\n    The elegance demanded of\r\n    Every quite irreproachable lover\r\n    And every seemly lady-love.\r\n\r\n    Now it is winter, and, alas,\r\n    Our backers tremble for their stake;\r\n    Already other sledges pass\r\n    And leave us toiling in their wake.\r\n\r\n    Put both your hands into your muff,\r\n    Sit back, now, steady! off we go.\r\n    Fanchon will tell us soon enough\r\n    Whatever news there is to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n    XI. FANTOCHES\r\n\r\n    Scaramouche waves a threatening hand\r\n    To Pulcinella, and they stand,\r\n    Two shadows, black against the moon.\r\n\r\n    The old doctor of Bologna pries\r\n    For simples with impassive eyes,\r\n    And mutters o\'er a magic rune.\r\n\r\n    The while his daughter, scarce half-dressed,\r\n    Glides slyly \'neath the trees, in quest\r\n    Of her bold pirate lover\'s sail;\r\n\r\n    Her pirate from the Spanish main,\r\n    Whose passion thrills her in the pain\r\n    Of the loud languorous nightingale.\r\n\r\n\r\n    XII. CYTH\xc3\x88RE\r\n\r\n    By favourable breezes fanned,\r\n    A trellised harbour is at hand\r\n    To shield us from the summer airs;\r\n\r\n    The scent of roses, fainting sweet,\r\n    Afloat upon the summer heat,\r\n    Blends with the perfume that she wears.\r\n\r\n    True to the promise her eyes gave,\r\n    She ventures all, and her mouth rains\r\n    A dainty fever through my veins;\r\n\r\n    And, Love fulfilling all things, save\r\n    Hunger, we \'scape, with sweets and ices,\r\n    The folly of Love\'s sacrifices.\r\n\r\n\r\n    XIII. EN BATEAU\r\n\r\n    The shepherd\'s star with trembling glint\r\n    Drops in black water; at the hint\r\n    The pilot fumbles for his flint.\r\n\r\n    Now is the time or never, sirs.\r\n    No hand that wanders wisely errs:\r\n    I touch a hand, and is it hers?\r\n\r\n    The knightly Atys strikes the strings,\r\n    And to the faithless Chloris flings\r\n    A look that speaks of many things.\r\n\r\n    The abb\xc3\xa9 has absolved again\r\n    Egl\xc3\xa9, the viscount all in vain\r\n    Has given his hasty heart the rein.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile the moon is up and streams\r\n    Upon the skiff that flies and seems\r\n    To float upon a tide of dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n    XIV. LE FAUNE\r\n\r\n    An aged faun of old red clay-Laughs\r\n    from the grassy bowling-green,\r\n    Foretelling doubtless some decay\r\n    Of mortal moments so serene\r\n\r\n    That lead us lightly on our way\r\n    (Love\'s piteous pilgrims have we been!)\r\n    To this last hour that runs away\r\n    Dancing to the tambourine.\r\n\r\n\r\n    XV. MANDOLINE\r\n\r\n    The singers of serenades\r\n    Whisper their faded vows\r\n    Unto fair listening maids\r\n    Under the singing boughs.\r\n\r\n    Tircis, Aminte, are there,\r\n    Clitandre has waited long,\r\n    And Damis for many a fair\r\n    Tyrant makes many a song.\r\n\r\n    Their short vests, silken and bright,\r\n    Their long pale silken trains,\r\n    Their elegance of delight,\r\n    Twine soft blue silken chains.\r\n\r\n    And the mandolines and they,\r\n    Faintlier breathing, swoon\r\n    Into the rose and grey\r\n    Ecstasy of the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n    XVI. A CLYM\xc3\x88NE\r\n\r\n    Mystical strains unheard,\r\n    A song without a word,\r\n    Dearest, because thine eyes,\r\n    Pale as the skies,\r\n\r\n    Because thy voice, remote\r\n    As the far clouds that float\r\n    Veiling for me the whole\r\n    Heaven of the soul,\r\n\r\n    Because the stately scent\r\n    Of thy swan\'s whiteness, blent\r\n    With the white lily\'s bloom\r\n    Of thy perfume,\r\n\r\n    Ah! because thy dear love,\r\n    The music breathed above\r\n    By angels halo-crowned,\r\n    Odour and sound,\r\n\r\n    Hath, in my subtle heart,\r\n    With some mysterious art\r\n    Transposed thy harmony,\r\n    So let it be!\r\n\r\n\r\n    XVII. LETTRE\r\n\r\n    Far from your sight removed by thankless cares\r\n    (The gods are witness when a lover swears)\r\n    I languish and I die, Madame, as still\r\n    My use is, which I punctually fulfil,\r\n    And go, through heavy-hearted woes conveyed,\r\n    Attended ever by your lovely shade,\r\n    By day in thought, by night in dreams of hell,\r\n    And day and night, Madame, adorable!\r\n    So that at length my dwindling body lost\r\n    In very soul, I too become a ghost,\r\n    I too, and in the lamentable stress\r\n    Of vain desires remembering happiness,\r\n    Remembered kisses, now, alas, unfelt,\r\n    My shadow shall into your shadow melt.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile, dearest, your most obedient slave.\r\n\r\n    How does the sweet society behave,\r\n    Thy cat, thy dog, thy parrot? and is she\r\n    Still, as of old, the black-eyed Silvanie\r\n    (I had loved black eyes if thine had not been blue)\r\n    Who ogled me at moments, palsambleu!\r\n\r\n    Thy tender friend and thy sweet confidant?\r\n    One dream there is, Madame, long wont to haunt\r\n    This too impatient heart: to pour the earth\r\n    And all its treasures (of how little worth!)\r\n    Before your feet as tokens of a love\r\n    Equal to the most famous flames that move\r\n    The hearts of men to conquer all but death.\r\n    Cleopatra was less loved, yes, on my faith,\r\n    By Antony or C\xc3\xa6sar than you are,\r\n    Madame, by me, who truly would by far\r\n    Out-do the deeds of C\xc3\xa6sar for a smile,\r\n    O Cleopatra, queen of word and wile,\r\n    Or, for a kiss, take flight with Antony\r\n\r\n    With this, farewell, dear, and no more from me;\r\n    How can the time it takes to read it, quite\r\n    Be worth the trouble that it took to write?\r\n\r\n\r\n    XVIII. LES INDOLENTS\r\n\r\n    Bah! spite of Fate, that says us nay,\r\n    Suppose we die together, eh?\r\n    --A rare conclusion you discover\r\n\r\n    --What\'s rare is good. Let us die so,\r\n    Like lovers in Boccaccio.\r\n    --Ha! ha! ha! you fantastic lover!\r\n\r\n    --Nay, not fantastic. If you will,\r\n    Fond, surely irreproachable.\r\n    Suppose, then, that we die together?\r\n\r\n    --Good sir, your jests are fitlier told\r\n    Than when you speak of love or gold.\r\n    Why speak at all, in this glad weather?\r\n\r\n    Whereat, behold them once again,\r\n    Tircis beside his Dorim\xc3\xa8ne,\r\n    Not far from two blithe rustic rovers,\r\n\r\n    For some caprice of idle breath\r\n    Deferring a delicious death.\r\n    Ha! ha! ha! what fantastic lovers!\r\n\r\n\r\n    XIX.

L\'AMOUR PAR TERRE\r\n\r\n    The other night a sudden wind laid low\r\n    The Love, shooting an arrow at a mark,\r\n    In the mysterious corner of the park,\r\n    Whose smile disquieted us long ago.\r\n\r\n    The wind has overthrown him, and above\r\n    His scattered dust, how sad it is to spell\r\n    The artist\'s name still faintly visible\r\n    Upon the pedestal without its Love,\r\n\r\n    How sad it is to see the pedestal\r\n    Still standing! as in dream I seem to hear\r\n    Prophetic voices whisper in my ear\r\n    The lonely and despairing end of all.\r\n\r\n    How sad it is! Why, even you have found\r\n    A tear for it, although your frivolous eye\r\n    Laughs at the gold and purple butterfly\r\n    Poised on the piteous litter on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n    XXI. EN SOURDINE\r\n\r\n    Calm where twilight leaves have stilled\r\n    With their shadow light and sound,\r\n    Let our silent love be filled\r\n    With a silence as profound.\r\n\r\n    Let our ravished senses blend\r\n    Heart and spirit, thine and mine,\r\n    With vague languors that descend\r\n    From the branches of the pine.\r\n\r\n    Close thine eyes against the day,\r\n    Fold thine arms across thy breast,\r\n    And for ever turn away\r\n    All desire of all but rest.\r\n\r\n    Let the lulling breaths that pass\r\n    In soft wrinkles at thy feet,\r\n    Tossing all the tawny grass,\r\n    This and only this repeat.\r\n\r\n    And when solemn evening\r\n    Dims the forest\'s dusky air,\r\n    Then the nightingale shall sing\r\n    The delight of our despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n    XXII. COLLOQUE SENTIMENTAL\r\n\r\n    In the old park, solitary and vast,\r\n    Over the frozen ground two forms once passed.\r\n\r\n    Their lips were languid and their eyes were dead,\r\n    And hardly could be heard the words they said.\r\n\r\n    In the old park, solitary and vast,\r\n    Two ghosts once met to summon up the past.\r\n\r\n    --Do you remember our old ecstasy?\r\n    --Why would you bring it back again to me?\r\n\r\n    --Do you still dream as you dreamed long ago?\r\n    Does your heart beat to my heart\'s beating?\r\n      --No.\r\n\r\n    --Ah, those old days, what joys have those days seen\r\n    When your lips met my lips!--It may have been.\r\n\r\n    --How blue the sky was, and our hope how light!\r\n    --Hope has flown helpless back into the night.\r\n\r\n    They walked through weeds withered and grasses dead,\r\n    And only the night heard the words they said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Po\xc3\xa8mes Saturniens_\r\n\r\n    I. SOLEILS COUCHANTS\r\n\r\n    Pale dawn delicately\r\n    Over earth has spun\r\n    The sad melancholy\r\n    Of the setting sun.\r\n    Sad melancholy\r\n    Brings oblivion\r\n    In sad songs to me\r\n    With the setting sun.\r\n    And the strangest dreams,\r\n    Dreams like suns that set\r\n    On the banks of the streams,\r\n    Ghost and glory met,\r\n    To my sense it seems,\r\n    Pass, and without let,\r\n    Like great suns that set\r\n    On the banks of streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. CHANSON D\'AUTOMNE\r\n\r\n    When a sighing begins\r\n    In the violins\r\n    Of the autumn-song,\r\n    My heart is drowned\r\n    In the slow sound\r\n    Languorous and long.\r\n\r\n    Pale as with pain,\r\n    Breath fails me when\r\n    The hour tolls deep.\r\n    My thoughts recover\r\n    The days that are over,\r\n    And I weep.\r\n\r\n    And I go\r\n\r\n    Where the winds know,\r\n    Broken and brief,\r\n    To and fro,\r\n    As the winds blow\r\n    A dead leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n    III. FEMME ET CHATTE\r\n\r\n    They were at play, she and her cat,\r\n    And it was marvellous to mark\r\n    The white paw and the white hand pat\r\n    Each other in the deepening dark.\r\n\r\n    The stealthy little lady hid\r\n    Under her mittens\' silken sheath\r\n    Her deadly agate nails that thrid\r\n    The silk-like dagger-points of death.\r\n\r\n    The cat purred primly and drew in\r\n    Her claws that were of steel filed thin:\r\n    The devil was in it all the same.\r\n\r\n    And in the boudoir, while a shout\r\n    Of laughter in the air rang out,\r\n    Four sparks of phosphor shone like flame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From La Bonne Chanson_\r\n\r\n    I\r\n\r\n    The white moon sits\r\n    And seems to brood\r\n    Where a swift voice flits\r\n    From each branch in the wood\r\n    That the tree-tops cover....\r\n\r\n    O lover, my lover!\r\n\r\n    The pool in the meadows\r\n    Like a looking-glass\r\n    Casts back the shadows\r\n    That over it pass\r\n    Of the willow-bower....\r\n\r\n    Let us dream: \'tis the hour....\r\n\r\n    A tender and vast\r\n    Lull of content\r\n    Like a cloud is cast\r\n    From the firmament\r\n    Where one planet is bright....\r\n\r\n    \'Tis the hour of delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II\r\n\r\n    The fireside, the lamp\'s little narrow light;\r\n    The dream with head on hand, and the delight\r\n    Of eyes that lose themselves in loving looks;\r\n    The hour of steaming tea and of shut books;\r\n    The solace to know evening almost gone;\r\n    The dainty weariness of waiting on\r\n    The nuptial shadow and night\'s softest bliss;\r\n    Ah, it is this that without respite, this\r\n    That without stay, my tender fancy seeks,\r\n    Mad with the months and furious with the weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Romances sans Paroles_\r\n\r\n    I\r\n\r\n    \'Tis the ecstasy of repose,\r\n    \'Tis love when tired lids close,\r\n    \'Tis the wood\'s long shuddering\r\n    In the embrace of the wind,\r\n    \'Tis, where grey boughs are thinned,\r\n    Little voices that sing.\r\n\r\n    O fresh and frail is the sound\r\n    That twitters above, around,\r\n    Like the sweet tiny sigh\r\n    That lies in the shaken grass;\r\n    Or the sound when waters pass\r\n    And the pebbles shrink and cry.\r\n\r\n    What soul is this that complains\r\n    Over the sleeping plains,\r\n    And what is it that it saith?\r\n    Is it mine, is it thine,\r\n    This lowly hymn I divine\r\n    In the warm night, low as a breath?\r\n\r\n\r\n    II\r\n\r\n    I divine, through the veil of a murmuring,\r\n    The subtle contour of voices gone,\r\n    And I see, in the glimmering lights that sing,\r\n    The promise, pale love, of a future dawn.\r\n\r\n    And my soul and my heart in trouble\r\n    What are they but an eye that sees,\r\n    As through a mist an eye sees double,\r\n    Airs forgotten of songs like these?\r\n\r\n    O to die of no other dying,\r\n    Love, than this that computes the showers\r\n    Of old hours and of new hours flying:\r\n    O to die of the swing of the hours!\r\n\r\n\r\n    III\r\n\r\n    Tears in my heart that weeps,\r\n    Like the rain upon the town.\r\n    What drowsy languor steeps\r\n    In tears my heart that weeps?\r\n\r\n    O sweet sound of the rain\r\n    On earth and on the roofs!\r\n    For a heart\'s weary pain\r\n    O the song of the rain!\r\n\r\n    Vain tears, vain tears, my heart!\r\n    What, none hath done thee wrong?\r\n    Tears without reason start\r\n    From my disheartened heart.\r\n\r\n    This is the weariest woe,\r\n    O heart, of love and hate\r\n    Too weary, not to know\r\n    Why thou hast all this woe.\r\n\r\n\r\n    IV\r\n\r\n    A frail hand in the rose-grey evening\r\n    Kisses the shining keys that hardly stir,\r\n    While, with the light, small flutter of a wing,\r\n    And old song, like an old tired wanderer,\r\n    Goes very softly, as if trembling,\r\n    About the room long redolent of Her.\r\n\r\n    What lullaby is this that comes again\r\n    To dandle my poor being with its breath?\r\n    What wouldst thou have of me, gay laughing strain?\r\n    What hadst thou, desultory faint refrain\r\n    That now into the garden to thy death\r\n    Floatest through the half-opened window-pane?\r\n\r\n\r\n    V\r\n\r\n    O sad, sad was my soul, alas!\r\n    For a woman, a woman\'s sake it was.\r\n\r\n    I have had no comfort since that day,\r\n    Although my heart went its way,\r\n\r\n    Although my heart and my soul went\r\n    From the woman into banishment.\r\n\r\n    I have had no comfort since that day,\r\n    Although my heart went its way.\r\n\r\n    And my heart, being sore in me,\r\n    Said to my soul: How can this be,\r\n\r\n    How can this be or have been thus,\r\n    This proud, sad banishment of us?\r\n\r\n    My soul said to my heart: Do I\r\n    Know what snare we are tangled by,\r\n\r\n    Seeing that, banished, we know not whether\r\n    We are divided or together?\r\n\r\n\r\n    VI\r\n\r\n    Wearily the plain\'s\r\n    Endless length expands;\r\n    The snow shines like grains\r\n    Of the shifting sands.\r\n\r\n    Light of day is none,\r\n    Brazen is the sky;\r\n    Overhead the moon\r\n    Seems to live and die.\r\n\r\n    Where the woods are seen,\r\n    Grey the oak-trees lift\r\n    Through the vaporous screen\r\n    Like the clouds that drift.\r\n\r\n    Light of day is none,\r\n    Brazen is the sky;\r\n    Overhead the moon\r\n    Seems to live and die.\r\n\r\n    Broken-winded crow,\r\n    And you, lean wolves, when\r\n    The sharp north-winds blow,\r\n    What do you do then?\r\n\r\n    Wearily the plain\'s\r\n    Endless length expands;\r\n    The snow shines like grains\r\n    Of the shifting sands.\r\n\r\n\r\n    VII\r\n\r\n    There\'s a flight of green and red\r\n    In the hurry of hills and rails,\r\n    Through the shadowy twilight shed\r\n    By the lamps as daylight pales.\r\n\r\n    Dim gold light flushes to blood\r\n    In humble hollows far down;\r\n    Birds sing low from a wood\r\n    Of barren trees without crown.\r\n\r\n    Scarcely more to be felt\r\n

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
