A._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARBOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\n"You chump," I thought contemptuously. I was seven years old at the\r\ntime, and the gentleman to whom I referred was Henry Ward Beecher. What\r\nit was that aroused my contempt for the man will be more fully\r\nunderstood if I tell first of the grudge that I bore him.\r\n\r\nI was sitting in my mother\'s pew in the old church in Brooklyn. I was\r\naltogether too small for the pew, it was much too wide for the bend at\r\nmy knees; and my legs, which were very short and fat, stuck straight out\r\nbefore me. I was not allowed to move, I was most uncomfortable, and for\r\nthis Sabbath torture I laid all the blame on the preacher. For my mother\r\nhad once told me that I was brought to church so small in order that\r\nwhen I grew up I could say I had heard the great man preach before he\r\ndied. Hence the deep grudge that I bore him. Sitting here this morning,\r\nit seemed to me for hours and hours, I had been meditating upon my hard\r\nlot. From time to time, as was my habit when thinking or feeling deeply,\r\none hand would unconsciously go to my head and slowly stroke my bang. My\r\nhair was short and had no curls, its only glory was this bang, which was\r\ndeliciously soft to my hand and shone like a mirror from much reflective\r\nstroking. Presently my mother would notice and with a smile she would\r\nput down my hand, but a few moments later up it would come and would\r\ncontinue its stroking. For I felt both abused and puzzled. What was\r\nthere in the talk of the large white-haired old man in the pulpit to\r\nmake my mother\'s eyes so queer, to make her sit so stiff and still? What\r\ngood would it do me when I grew up to say that I had heard him?\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe I will ever say it," I reasoned doggedly to myself.\r\n"And even if I do, I don\'t believe any other man will care whether I say\r\nit to him or not." I felt sure my father wouldn\'t. He never even came to\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nAt the thought of my strange silent father, my mind leaped to his\r\nwarehouse, his dock, the ships and the harbor. Like him, they were all\r\nso strange. And my hands grew a little cold and moist as I thought of\r\nthe terribly risky thing I had planned to do all by myself that very\r\nafternoon. I thought about it for a long time with my eyes tight shut.\r\nThen the voice of the minister brought me back, I found myself sitting\r\nhere in church and went on with this less shivery thinking.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t care myself," I decided. "If I were a man and another man\r\nmet me on the street and said, \'Look here. When I was a boy I heard\r\nHenry Ward Beecher before he died,\' I guess I would just say to him,\r\n\'You mind your business and I\'ll mind mine.\'" This phrase I had heard\r\nfrom the corner grocer, and I liked the sound of it. I repeated it now\r\nwith an added zest.\r\n\r\nAgain I opened my eyes and again I found myself here in church. Still\r\nhere. I heaved a weary sigh.\r\n\r\n"If you were dead already," I thought as I looked up at the preacher,\r\n"my mother wouldn\'t bring me here." I found this an exceedingly cheering\r\nthought. I had once overheard our cook Anny describe how her old father\r\nhad dropped dead. I eyed the old minister hopefully.\r\n\r\nBut what was this he was saying! Something about "the harbor of life."\r\nThe harbor! In an instant I was listening hard, for this was something I\r\nknew about.\r\n\r\n"Safe into the harbor," I heard him say. "Home to the harbor at last to\r\nrest." And then, while he passed on to something else, something I\r\n_didn\'t_ know about, I settled disgustedly back in the pew.\r\n\r\n"You chump," I thought contemptuously. To hear him talk you would have\r\nthought the harbor was a place to feel quite safe in, a place to snuggle\r\ndown in, a nice little place to come home to at night. "I guess he has\r\nnever seen it much," I snorted.\r\n\r\nFor I had. From our narrow brownstone house on the Heights, ever since I\r\ncould remember (and let me tell you that seems a long time when you are\r\nseven years old), I had looked down from our back windows upon a harbor\r\nthat to me was strange and terrible.\r\n\r\nI was glad that our house was up so high. Its front was on a sedate old\r\nstreet, and within it everything felt safe. My mother was here, and Sue,\r\nmy little sister, and old Belle, our nurse, our nursery, my games, my\r\nanimals, my fairy books, the small red table where I ate my supper, and\r\nthe warm fur rug by my bed, where I knelt for "Now I lay me."\r\n\r\nBut from the porch at the back of our house you went three steps down to\r\na long narrow garden--at least the garden seemed long to me--and if you\r\nwalked to the end of the garden and peered through the ivy-covered bars\r\nof the fence, as I had done when I was so little that I could barely\r\nwalk alone, you had the first mighty thrill of your life. For you found\r\nthat through a hole in the ivy you could see a shivery distance straight\r\ndown through the air to a street below. You found that the two iron\r\nposts, one at either end of the fence, were warm when you touched them,\r\nhad holes in the top, had smoke coming out--were chimneys! And slowly it\r\ndawned upon your mind that this garden of yours was nothing at all but\r\nthe roof of a gray old building--which your nurse told you vaguely had\r\nbeen a "warehouse" long ago when the waters of the harbor had come \'way\r\nin to the street below. The old "wharves" had been down there, she said.\r\nWhat was a "wharf?" It was a "dock," she told me. And she said that a\r\nfamily of "dockers" lived in the building under our garden. They were\r\nall that was left in it now but "old junk." Who was Old Junk, a man or a\r\nwoman? And what in the world were Dockers?\r\n\r\nPursuing my adventurous ways, I found at one place in the garden, hidden\r\nby flowers near a side wall, a large heavy lid which was painted brown\r\nand felt like tin. But how much heavier than tin. Tug as I might, I\r\ncould not budge it. Then I found it had an iron hook and was hooked down\r\ntight to the garden. Yes, it was true, our whole garden was a roof! I\r\nput my ear down to the lid and listened scowling, both eyes shut. I\r\nheard nothing then, but I came back and tried it many times, until once\r\nI jumped up and ran like mad. For faintly from somewhere deep down under\r\nthe flower beds I had heard a baby crying! What was this baby, a Junk or\r\na Docker? And who were these people who lived under flowers? To me they\r\nsounded suspiciously like the goblins in my goblin book. Once when I was\r\nsick in bed, Sue came shrieking into the house and said that a giant had\r\nheaved up that great lid from below. Up had come his shaggy head, his\r\ndirty face, his rolling eyes, and he had laughed and laughed at the\r\nflowers. He was a drunken man, our old nurse Belle had told her, but Sue\r\nwas sure he was a giant.\r\n\r\n"You are wrong," I said with dignity. "He is either a Junk or a Docker."\r\n\r\nThe lid was spiked down after that, and our visitor never appeared\r\nagain. But I saw him vividly in my mind\'s eye--his shaggy wild head\r\nrising up among our flowers. Vaguely I felt that he came from the\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\nAs the exciting weeks of my life went on I discovered three good holes\r\nin that ivy-covered fence of ours. These all became my secret holes, and\r\nthrough them I watched the street below, a bleak bare chasm of a street\r\nwhich when the trucks came by echoed till it thundered. Across the\r\nstreet rose the high gray front of my father\'s warehouse. It was part\r\nof a solid line of similar gray brick buildings, and it was like my\r\nfather, it was grim and silent, you could not see inside. Over its five\r\ntiers of windows black iron shutters were fastened tight. From time to\r\ntime a pair of these shutters would fly open, disclosing a dark cave\r\nbehind, out of which men brought barrels and crates and let them down by\r\nropes into the trucks on the street below. How they spun round and round\r\nas they came! But most of the trucks drove rumbling into a tunnel which\r\nled through the warehouse out to my father\'s dock, out to the ships and\r\nthe harbor. And from that mysterious region long lines of men came\r\nthrough the tunnel at noontime, some nearly naked, some only in shirts,\r\nmen with the hairiest faces. They sat on the street with their backs to\r\nthe warehouse wall, eating their dinners out of pails, and from other\r\npails they took long drinks of a curious stuff all white on top. Some of\r\nthem were always crossing the street and disappearing from my view into\r\na little store directly underneath me. Belle spoke of this store as a\r\n"vile saloon" and of these men as "dockers." So I knew what Dockers were\r\nat last! In place of the one who lived under our garden and had burst up\r\namong the flowers, I saw now that there were hundreds and thousands of\r\nmen like him down there on the docks. And all belonged to the harbor.\r\n\r\nTheir work I learned was to load the ships whose masts and spars peeped\r\nup at me over the warehouse roofs. From my nursery window above I could\r\nsee them better. Sometimes they had large white sails and then they\r\nmoved off somewhere. I could see them go, these tall ships, with their\r\nsails making low, mysterious sounds, flappings, spankings and deep\r\nboomings. The men on them sang the weirdest songs as they pulled all\r\ntogether at the ropes. Some of these songs brought a lump in your\r\nthroat. Where were they going? "To heathen lands," Belle told me. What\r\ndid she mean? I was just going to ask her. But then I stopped--I did not\r\ndare! From up the river, under the sweeping arch of that Great Bridge\r\nwhich seemed high as the clouds, came more tall ships, and low\r\n"steamers" belching smoke and "tugs" and "barges" and "ferry boats." The\r\nnames of all these I learned from Belle and Anny the cook and my mother.\r\nAnd all were going "to heathen lands." What in the world did Belle mean\r\nby that?\r\n\r\nOnce I thought I had it. I saw that some of these smaller boats were\r\njust going across the river and stopping at the land over there, a land\r\nso crowded with buildings you could barely see into it at all. "Is that\r\na heathen land?" I asked her. "Yes!" said Belle. And she laughed. She\r\nwas Scotch and very religious. But later I heard her call it "New York"\r\nand say she was going there herself to buy herself some corsets. And so\r\nI was even more puzzled than ever. For some deep instinct told me you\r\ncould buy no corsets in "heathen land"--least of all Belle\'s corsets.\r\n\r\nShe often spoke of "the ocean," too, another place where the tall ships\r\nwent. But what was the ocean? "It\'s like a lake, but mightier," Belle\r\nhad said. But what was a lake? It was all so vague and confusing. Always\r\nit came back to this, that I had no more seen the "ocean" than I had\r\nseen a "heathen land," and so I did not know them.\r\n\r\nBut I knew the harbor by day and by night, on bright sunny days and in\r\nfogs and rains, in storms of wind, in whirling snow, and under the\r\nrestful stars at night that twinkled down from so far above, while the\r\nshadowy region below twinkled back with stars of its own, restless,\r\nmany-colored stars, yellow, green and red and blue, moving, dancing,\r\nflaring, dying. And all these stars had voices, too. By night in my bed\r\nI could hear them--hoots and shrieks from ferries and tugs, hoarse\r\ncoughs from engines along the docks, the whine of wheels, the clang of\r\nbells, deep blasts and bellows from steamers. And closer still, from\r\nthat "vile saloon" directly under the garden, I could hear wild shouts\r\nand songs and roars of laughter that came, I learned, not only from\r\ndockers, but from "stokers" and "drunken sailors," men who lived right\r\ninside the ships and would soon be starting for heathen lands!\r\n\r\n"I wonder how I\'d feel," I would think, "if I were out in the garden\r\nnow--out in the dark all by myself--right above that vile saloon!"\r\n\r\nThis would always scare me so that I would bury my head in the covers\r\nand shake. But I often did this, for I liked to be scared. It was a game\r\nI had all by myself with the harbor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd yet this old man in the pulpit called it a place where you went to\r\nrest!\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years have gone since then, and all that I can remember now\r\nof anything Henry Ward Beecher said was this--that once, just once, I\r\nheard him speak of something that I knew about, and that when he did he\r\nwas wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd though all the years since then have been for me one long story of a\r\nharbor, restless, heaving, changing, always changing--it has never\r\nchanged for me in this--it has never seemed a haven where ships come to\r\ndock, but always a place from which ships start out--into the storms and\r\nthe fogs of the seas, over the "ocean" to "heathen lands." For so I saw\r\nit when I was a child, the threshold of adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I walked home from church with my mother that day the streets seemed\r\nas quiet and safe as her eyes. How suddenly tempting it seemed to me,\r\nthis quiet and this safety, compared to the place where I was going. For\r\nI had decided to run away from my home and my mother that afternoon,\r\ndown to the harbor to see the world. What would become of me \'way down\r\nthere? What would she do if I never came back? A lump rose in my throat\r\nat the thought of her tears. It was terrible.\r\n\r\n"All the same I am going to do it," I kept thinking doggedly. And yet\r\nsuddenly, as we reached our front steps, how near I came to telling her.\r\nBut no, she would only spoil it all. She wanted me always up in the\r\ngarden, she wanted me never to have any thrills.\r\n\r\nMy mother knew me so well. She had seen that when she read stories of\r\nfairies, witches and goblins out of my books to Sue and me, while Sue,\r\nthough two years younger, would sit there like a little dark imp, her\r\nblack eyes snapping over the fights, I would creep softly out of the\r\nroom, ashamed and shaken, and would wait in the hall outside till the\r\nhappy ending was in plain view. So my mother had gradually toned down\r\nall the fights and the killings, the witches and the monsters, and much\r\nto my disappointment had wholly shut out the gory pirates who were for\r\nme the most frightfully fascinating of all. Sometimes I felt vaguely\r\nthat for this she had her own reason, too--that my mother hated\r\neverything that had to do with the ocean, especially my father\'s dock\r\nthat made him so gloomy and silent. But of this I could never be quite\r\nsure. I would often watch her intently, with a sudden sharp anxiety,\r\nfor I loved my mother with all my soul and I could not bear to see her\r\nunhappy.\r\n\r\n"Never on any account," I heard her say to Belle, "are the children to\r\ngo down the street toward the docks."\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," said Belle. "I\'ll see to it."\r\n\r\nAt once I wanted to go there. The street in front of our house sloped\r\nabruptly down at the next corner two blocks through poorer and smaller\r\nhouses to a cobblestone space below, over which trucks clattered,\r\nplainly on their way to the docks. So I could go down and around by that\r\nway. How tempting it all looked down there. Above the roofs of the\r\nhouses, the elevated railroad made a sharp bend on its way to the\r\nBridge, trains roared by, high over all the Great Bridge swept across\r\nthe sky. And below all this and more thrilling than all, I caught\r\nglimpses of strange, ragged boys. "Micks," Belle sometimes called them,\r\nand sometimes, "Finian Mickies." Up here I had no playmates.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, our garden lost its charms. Up the narrow courtway which\r\nran along the side of the house I would slip stealthily to the front\r\ngate and often get a good look down the street before Belle sharply\r\ncalled me back. The longest looks, I found, were always on Sunday\r\nafternoons, when Belle would sit back there in the garden, close to the\r\nbed of red tulips which encircled a small fountain made of two white\r\nangels. Belle, who was bony, tall and grim, would sit by the little\r\nangels reading her shabby Bible. Her face was wrinkled and almost brown,\r\nher eyes now kind, now gloomy. She had a song she would sing now and\r\nthen. "For beneath the Union Jack we will drive the Finians back"--is\r\nall I can remember. She told me of witches in the Scotch hills. At her\r\ntouch horrible monsters rose in the most surprising places. In the\r\nbathtub, for example, when I stayed in the bath too long she would jerk\r\nout the stopper, and as from the hole there came a loud gurgle--"It\'s\r\nthe Were-shark," Belle would mutter. And I would leap out trembling.\r\n\r\nThis old "Were-shark" had his home in the very middle of the ocean. In\r\none gulp he could swallow a boy of my size, and this he did three times\r\neach day. The boys were brought to him by the "Condor," a perfectly\r\nhideous bird as large as a cow and as fierce as a tiger. If ever I dared\r\ngo down that street and disobey my mother, the Condor would "swoop" down\r\nover the roofs, snatch me up in his long yellow beak with the blood of\r\nthe last boy on it, and with thunder and lightning would carry me off\r\nfar over the clouds and drop me into the Were-shark\'s mouth.\r\n\r\nThen Belle would sit down to her Bible.\r\n\r\nSunday after Sunday passed, and still in fascinated dread I would steal\r\nquietly out to the gate and watch this street forbidden. Pointing to it\r\none day, Belle had declared in awful tones, "Broad is the way that\r\nleadeth to destruction." But it was not broad. In that at least she was\r\nall wrong. It was in fact so narrow that a Condor as big as a cow might\r\neasily bump himself when he "swooped." Besides, there were good strong\r\nlamp-posts where a little boy could cling and scream, and almost always\r\nsomewhere in sight was a policeman so fat and heavy that even two\r\nCondors could hardly lift him from the ground. This policeman would come\r\nrunning. My mother had said I must never be scared by policemen, because\r\nthey were really good kind men. In fact, she said, it was foolish to be\r\nscared by anything ever. She never knew of Belle\'s methods with me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo at last I had decided to risk it, and now the fearful day had come. I\r\ncould barely eat my dinner. My courage was fast ebbing away. In the\r\ndining-room the sunlight was for a time wiped out by clouds, and I grew\r\nsuddenly happy. It might rain and then I could not go. But it did not\r\nrain nor did anything I hoped for happen to prevent my plan. Belle sat\r\ndown by the angels and was soon so deep in her Bible that it was plain I\r\ncould easily slip up the path. Sue never looked up from her sand-pile\r\nto say, "Stop Billy! He\'s running away from home!" With a gulp I passed\r\nmy mother\'s window. She did not happen to look out. Now I had reached\r\nthe very gate. "I can\'t go! I can\'t open the gate!" But the old gate\r\nopened with one push. "I can\'t go! There is no policeman!" But yes,\r\nthere he was on my side of the street slowly walking toward me. My heart\r\nthumped, I could hardly breathe. In a moment with a frantic rush I had\r\nreached the nearest lamp-post and was clinging breathless. I could not\r\nscream, I shut my eyes in sickening fear and waited for the rushing of\r\nenormous wings.\r\n\r\nBut there came no Condor swooping.\r\n\r\nAnother rush--another post--another and another!\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with you, little feller?"\r\n\r\nI looked up at the big safe policeman and laughed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m playing a game," I almost shouted, and ran without touching another\r\npost two blocks to the cobblestone space below. I ran blindly around it\r\nseveral times, I bumped into a man who said, "Heigh there! Look out!"\r\nAfter that I strutted proudly, then turned and ran back with all my\r\nmight up the street, and into our house and up to my room. And there on\r\nmy bed to my great surprise I found myself sobbing and sobbing. It was a\r\nlong time before I could stop. I had had my first adventure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI made many Sunday trips after that, and on no one of them was I caught.\r\nFor delighted and proud at what I had done I kept asking Belle to talk\r\nof the Condor, gloomily she piled on the terrors, and seeing the awed\r\nlook in my eyes (awe at my own courage in defying such a bird), she felt\r\nso sure of my safety that often she would barely look up from her Bible\r\nthe whole afternoon. Even on workdays over her sewing she would forget.\r\nAnd so I went "to destruction."\r\n\r\nAt first I stayed but a little while and never left the cobblestone\r\nspace, only peering up into the steep little streets that led to the\r\nfearsome homes of the "Micks." But then I made the acquaintance of Sam.\r\nIt happened through a small toy boat which I had taken down there with\r\nthe purpose of starting it off for "heathen lands." As I headed across\r\nthe railroad tracks that led to the docks, suddenly Sam and his gang\r\nappeared from around a freight car. I stood stock-still. They were\r\ncertainly "Micks"--ragged and dirty, with holes in their shoes and soot\r\non their faces. Sam was smoking a cigarette.\r\n\r\n"Heigh, fellers," he said, "look at Willy\'s boat."\r\n\r\nI clutched my boat tighter and turned to run. But the next moment Sam\r\nhad me by the arm.\r\n\r\n"Look here, young feller," he growled. "You\'ve got the wrong man to do\r\nbusiness with this time."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to do any business," I gasped.\r\n\r\n"Smash him, Sam--smash in his nut for him," piped the smallest Micky\r\ncheerfully. And this Sam promptly proceeded to do. It was a wild and\r\npainful time. But though Sam was two years older, he was barely any\r\nlarger than I, and when he and his gang had gone off with my boat, as I\r\nstood there breathing hard, I was filled with a grim satisfaction. For\r\nonce when he tried to wrench the boat from me I had hit him with it\r\nright on the face, and I had had a glimpse of a thick red mark across\r\nhis cheek. I tasted something new in my mouth and spit it out. It was\r\nblood. I did this several times, slowly and impressively, till it made a\r\ngood big spot on the railroad tie at my feet. Then I walked with dignity\r\nback across the tracks and up "the way of destruction" home. I walked\r\nslowly, planning as I went. At the gate I climbed up on it and swung.\r\nThen with a sudden loud cry I fell off and ran back into the garden\r\ncrying, "I fell off the gate! I fell on my face!" So my cut and swollen\r\nlip was explained, and my trips were not discovered.\r\n\r\nI felt myself growing older fast. For I knew that I could both fight and\r\ntell lies, besides defying the Condor.\r\n\r\nIn the next years, for weeks at a time my life was centered on Sam and\r\nhis gang. How we became friends, how often we met, by just what means I\r\nevaded my nurse, all these details are vague to me now. I am not even\r\nsure I was never caught. But it seems to me that I was not. For as I\r\ngrew to be eight years old, Belle turned her attention more and more to\r\nthat impish little sister of mine who was always up to some mischief or\r\nother. There was the corner grocer, too, with whom I pretended to be\r\nstaunch friends. "I\'m going to see the grocer," I would say, when I\r\nheard Sam\'s cautious whistle in front of the house--and so presently I\r\nwould join the gang. I followed Sam with a doglike devotion, giving up\r\nmy weekly twenty-five cents instead of saving it for Christmas, and in\r\nreturn receiving from him all the world-old wisdom stored in that\r\nbullet-shaped head of his which sat so tight on his round little\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nAnd though I did not realize it then, in my tense crowded childhood,\r\nthrough Sam and his companions I learned something else that was to\r\nstand me in good stead years later on. I learned how to make friends\r\nwith "the slums." I discovered that by making friends with "Micks" and\r\n"Dockers" and the like, you find they are no fearful goblins, giants\r\nbursting savagely up among the flowers of your life, but people as human\r\nas yourself, or rather, much more human, because they live so close to\r\nthe harbor, close to the deep rough tides of life.\r\n\r\nInto these tides I was now drawn down--and it did me some good and a\r\ngreat deal of harm. For I was too little those days for the harbor.\r\n\r\nSam had the most wonderful life in the world. He could go wherever he\r\nliked and at any hour day or night. Once, he said, when a "feller" was\r\ndrowned, he had stayed out on the docks all night. His mother always let\r\nhim alone. An enormous woman with heavy eyes, I was in awe of her from\r\nthe first. The place that she kept with Sam\'s father was called "The\r\nSailor\'s Harbor." It stood on a corner down by the docks, a long, low\r\nwooden building painted white, with twelve tight-shuttered, mysterious\r\nwindows along the second story, and below them a "Ladies\' Entrance." In\r\nfront was a small blackboard with words in white which Sam could read.\r\n"Ten Cent Dinners" stood at the top. Below came, "Coffee and rolls."\r\nNext, "Ham and eggs." Then "Bacon and eggs." And then, "To-day"--with a\r\nspace underneath where Sam\'s fat father wrote down every morning still\r\nmore delicious eatables. You got whiffs of these things and they made\r\nyour mouth water, they made your stomach fairly turn against your\r\nnursery supper.\r\n\r\nBut most of our time we spent on the docks. All were roofed, and\r\nexploring the long dock sheds and climbing down into the dark holds of\r\nthe square-rigged ships called "clippers," we found logs of curious\r\nmottled wood, huge baskets of sugar, odorous spices, indigo, camphor,\r\ntea, coffee, jute and endless other things. Sam knew their names and the\r\nnames of the wonder-places they came from--Manila, Calcutta, Bombay,\r\nCeylon. He knew besides such words as "hawser," "bulkhead" and\r\n"ebb-tide." And Sam knew how to swear. He swore with a fascinating ease\r\nsuch words as made me shiver and stare. And then he would look at me and\r\nchuckle.\r\n\r\n"You think I\'ll go to hell for this, don\'t you," he asked me once. And\r\nmy face grew hot with embarrassment, for I thought that he assuredly\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nI asked him what were heathen lands, and he said they were countries\r\nwhere heathen lived. And what were heathen? Cannibals. And what were\r\nthey?\r\n\r\n"Fellers that eat fellers," he said.\r\n\r\n"Alive?" I inquired. He turned to the gang:\r\n\r\n"Listen to the kid! He wants to know if they eat \'em alive!" Sam spat\r\ndisgustedly. "Naw," he said. "First they roast \'em like any meat. They\r\nroast \'em," he added reflectively, "until their skin gets brown and\r\nbubbles out and busts."\r\n\r\nOne afternoon a carriage brought three travelers for one of the ships, a\r\nman, his wife and a little girl with shining yellow pig-tails. "To be\r\net," Sam whispered as we stood close beside them. And then, pointing to\r\nsome of the half-naked brown men that made the crew of the ship near\r\nby--"cannibals," he muttered. For a long time I stared at these eaters,\r\nespecially at their lean brown stomachs.\r\n\r\n"We\'re safe enough," Sam told me. "They ain\'t allowed to come ashore." I\r\nfound this very comforting.\r\n\r\nBut what a frightful fate lay in store for the little girl with\r\npig-tails. As I watched her I felt worse and worse. Why couldn\'t\r\nsomebody warn her in time? At last I decided to do it myself. Procuring\r\na scrap of paper I retired behind a pile of crates and wrote in my\r\nlarge, clumsy hand, "You look out--you are going to be et." Watching my\r\nchance, I slipped this into her satchel and hoped that she would read it\r\nsoon. Then I promptly forgot all about her and ran off into a warehouse\r\nwhere the gang had gone to slide.\r\n\r\nThese warehouses had cavernous rooms, so dark you could not see to the\r\nends, and there from between the wooden columns the things from the\r\nships loomed out of the dark like so many ghosts. There were strange\r\nsweet smells. And from a hole in the ceiling there was a twisting chute\r\nof steel down which you could slide with terrific speed. We used to\r\nslide by the hour.\r\n\r\nOutside were freight cars in long lines, some motionless, some suddenly\r\nlurching forward or back, with a grinding and screeching of wheels and a\r\npuffing and coughing from engines ahead. Sam taught me how to climb on\r\nthe cars and how to swing off while they were going. He had learned from\r\nwatching the brakemen that dangerous backward left-hand swing that lands\r\nyou stock-still in your tracks. It is a splendid feeling. Only once\r\nSam\'s left hand caught, I heard a low cry, and after I jumped I found\r\nhim standing there with a white face. His left hand hung straight down\r\nfrom the wrist and blood was dripping from it.\r\n\r\n"Shut up, you damn fool!" he said fiercely.\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t saying nothing," I gasped.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you was--you was startin\' to cry! Holy Christ!" He sat down\r\nsuddenly, then rolled over and lay still. Some one ran for his mother,\r\nand after a time he was carried away. I did not see him again for some\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nWe did things that were bad for a boy of my size, and I saw things that\r\nI shouldn\'t have seen--a docker crushed upon one of the docks and\r\nbrought out on a stretcher dead, a stoker as drunk as though he were\r\ndead being wheeled on a wheelbarrow to a ship by the man called a\r\n"crimp," who sold this drunken body for an advance on its future pay.\r\nSam told me in detail of these things. There came a strike, and once in\r\nthe darkness of a cold November twilight I saw some dockers rush on a\r\n"scab," I heard the dull sickening thumps as they beat him.\r\n\r\nAnd one day Sam took me to the door of his father\'s saloon and pointed\r\nout a man in there who had an admiring circle around him.\r\n\r\n"He\'s going to jump from the Bridge on a bet," Sam whispered. I saw the\r\nman go. For what seemed to me hours I watched the Great Bridge up there\r\nin the sky, with its crawling processions of trolleys and wagons, its\r\nwhole moving armies of little black men. Suddenly one of these tiny\r\nspecks shot out and down, I saw it fall below the roofs, I felt Sam\'s\r\nhand like ice in mine. And this was not good for a boy of ten.\r\n\r\nBut the sight that ended it all for me was not a man, but a woman. It\r\nhappened one chilly March afternoon when I fell from a dock into water\r\ncovered with grease and foam, came up spluttering and terrified, was\r\nquickly hauled to the dock by a man and then hustled by Sam and the gang\r\nto his home, to have my clothes dried and so not get caught by my\r\nmother. Scolded by Sam\'s mother and given something fiery hot to drink,\r\nstripped naked and wrapped in an old flannel nightgown and told to sit\r\nby the stove in the kitchen--I was then left alone with Sam. And then\r\nSam with a curious light in his eyes took me to a door which he opened\r\njust a crack. Through the crack he showed me a small back room full of\r\nround iron tables. And at one of these a man, stoker or sailor I don\'t\r\nknow which, his face flushed red under dirt and hair, held in his lap a\r\nbig fat girl half dressed, giggling and queer, quite drunk. And then\r\nwhile Sam whispered on and on about the shuttered rooms upstairs, I felt\r\na rush of such sickening fear and loathing that I wanted to scream--but\r\nI turned too faint.\r\n\r\nI remember awakening on the floor, Sam\'s mother furiously slapping Sam,\r\nthen dressing me quickly, gripping me tight by both my arms and saying,\r\n\r\n"You tell a word of this to your pa and we\'ll come up and kill you!"\r\n\r\nThat night at home I did not sleep. I lay in my bed and shivered and\r\nburned. My first long exciting adventure was over. Ended were all the\r\nthrills, the wild fun. It was a spree I had had with the harbor, from\r\nthe time I was seven until I was ten. It had taken me at seven, a plump\r\nsturdy little boy, and at ten it had left me wiry, thin, with quick,\r\nnervous movements and often dark shadows under my eyes. And it left a\r\ndeep scar on my early life. For over all the adventures and over my\r\nwhole childhood loomed this last thing I had seen, hideous, disgusting.\r\nFor years after that, when I saw or even thought of the harbor, I felt\r\nthe taste of foul, greasy water in my mouth and in my soul.\r\n\r\nSo ended the first lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning as I started for school, suddenly in the hallway I\r\nthought of what my mother had told me--always when I was frightened to\r\nshut my eyes and speak to Jesus and he would be sure to make everything\r\nright. I had not spoken to Jesus of late except to say "Holy Christ!"\r\nlike Sam. But now, so sickened by Sam and his docks, my head throbbing\r\nfrom the sleepless night, on the impulse I kneeled quickly with my face\r\non a chair right there in the hall. But I found I was too ashamed to\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\n"If he would only ask me," I thought. Why didn\'t he ask me, "What\'s the\r\nmatter, little son?" or say, "Now, you must tell me and then you\'ll feel\r\nbetter"--as my mother always did. But Jesus did not help me out. I could\r\nnot even feel him near me. "I will never tell anyone," I thought. And I\r\nfelt myself horribly alone.\r\n\r\nHelp came from a quite different source.\r\n\r\n"There he is! Look!"\r\n\r\nI heard Sue\'s eager whisper. Jumping quickly to my feet, I saw in the\r\nlibrary doorway Sue\'s dark little figure and her mocking, dancing eyes\r\nas she pointed me out to our father, her chum, whose face wore a smile\r\nof amusement. In a moment I had rushed out of doors and was running\r\nangrily to school, furious at myself for praying, furious at Sue for\r\nspying and at my father for that smile. My terror was forgotten. No more\r\ntelling Jesus things! I retreated deep inside of myself and worked out\r\nof my troubles as best I could.\r\n\r\nFrom that day the harbor became for me a big grim place to be let\r\nalone--like my father. A place immeasurably stronger than I--like my\r\nfather--and like him harsh and indifferent, not caring whether when I\r\nfell into it I was pulled up to safety or drawn far down into grease and\r\nslime. It made no difference. I was nothing to it one way or the other.\r\nAnd I was nothing to my father.\r\n\r\nOf course this was by no means true. As I look back now I know that\r\noften he must have tried to be kind, that in the jar and worry of his\r\nown absorbing troubled life he must have often turned to me and tried to\r\nmake himself my friend. But children pass hard judgments. And if my\r\nfather was friendly at times it did no good. For he was a man--big and\r\nstrong--and I was a small boy craving his love.\r\n\r\nWhy couldn\'t he really love me? Why couldn\'t he ask me how I felt or\r\npull my ear and say "Hello, Puss?" He was always saying these things to\r\nSue, and caring about her very hard and trying to understand her,\r\nalthough she was nothing but a girl, two years younger and smaller than\r\nI and far less interesting. And yet with her he was kind and tender,\r\ncurious and smiling, he watched her with wholly different eyes. My\r\nfather was a short, powerful man, and though he was nearly fifty years\r\nold his hair was black and thick and coarse. At night he would rub his\r\nunshaven cheek on Sue\'s small cheek and tickle her. She would chuckle\r\nand wriggle as though it were fun. I used to watch this hungrily, and\r\nonce I awkwardly drew close and offered my cheek to be tickled. My\r\nfather at once grew as awkward as I, and he gave me a rub so rough it\r\nstung. And this wasn\'t fair--I had hoped for a cuddle. Besides, he was\r\nalways praising Sue when I knew she didn\'t deserve it. He called her\r\nbrave. Once when he took us duck shooting together a squall came up and\r\nhe rowed hard, and Sue sat with her eyes on his, smiling and quite\r\nunafraid. At home that night I heard him tell my mother how wonderfully\r\nbrave she had been, and of how I, on the other hand, had gripped the\r\nboat and turned white with fear, while little Sue just sat and smiled.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll see how brave she is," I thought, and the next day I hit her in\r\nSam\'s best style, fairly "knocked her nut off," in fact, with one quick\r\nblow. "There," I said to myself while she screamed. "I guess that shows\r\nhow brave you are. I didn\'t scream when Sam hit me."\r\n\r\nHe said she was quicker than I at her lessons. And this rankled the\r\ndeeper because it was true. But I would never admit it.\r\n\r\n"Of course she\'s quick, when he\'s always helping her. Why doesn\'t he\r\never come and help me?" I would burst into tears of vexation. My father\r\nwas unfair!\r\n\r\nMore than that, it was he and his dock and his warehouse, in the years\r\nthat followed my thrills with Sam, that stripped all these thrills away.\r\nA great ship with her spreading, booming white sails might move up the\r\nriver from heathen lands as wonderful and strange as you please. But the\r\nmoment she reached my father\'s dock she became a dirty, spotted thing,\r\njust a common every-day part of his business.\r\n\r\nHe himself was nothing but business. His business was with ships and the\r\nsea, and yet he had never once in his life taken a long sea voyage. "Why\r\ndoesn\'t he? Why does he like only tiresome things?" I argued secretly to\r\nmyself. "Why does he always come ashore?" He always did. In my memories\r\nof ships sailing I see him always there on deck talking to the captain,\r\nscowling, wrinkling his eyes over the smoke of his cigar, but always\r\ncoming down the gang-plank at the end, unconcernedly turning his back on\r\nall the excitement and going back to his warehouse.\r\n\r\nHe could get excited about ships, but only in the queerest way that had\r\nsomething to do with his business. Late one night from my bed I heard\r\nhis voice downstairs, cutting and snarling through other voices. I got\r\nout of bed and stole downstairs and along the half-lit hall to the\r\nlibrary door, and there from behind the curtain I watched what was going\r\non inside. The library was full of men, grave, courteous-looking\r\ngentlemen, some of them angry, some merely amused. My father was leaning\r\nover his table talking of ships, of mysterious things that he said must\r\nbe done with battleships and tariffs.\r\n\r\n"And mark me, gentlemen," he cried. "If we don\'t do these things in time\r\nAmerican sails will be swept from the seas!"\r\n\r\nListening, I got a picture of an immense broom reaching out of the\r\nclouds and sweeping American ships off the ocean. But I could make\r\nnothing of this at the time. I only watched his face and eyes and his\r\nfist that came down with a crash on the table. And I was afraid of my\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nWhen ships lay at his dock the captains often came up to dinner. But\r\neven these marvelous creatures lost in my father\'s presence all that Sam\r\nhad given them in my eyes. They did not like my mother, they ate in\r\nuneasy silence, or spoke gruffly of their dull affairs. Once or twice I\r\nheard talk of mutinies, of sailors shot down or put in irons, but all in\r\na matter-of-fact sort of way. Mere grunts came from my father. Steadily\r\ndrearier grew the ocean, flatter all the heathen lands.\r\n\r\nOne stout, red-faced captain, jovial even in spite of my mother, would\r\nannoy me frightfully by joking about my going to sea. He was always\r\nasking me when I meant to run away and be "a bloody pirate." He took it\r\nfor granted I liked the sea, was thrilled by the sea, when the truth of\r\nit was that I hated the sea! It was business now, only business!\r\n\r\nMy father\'s warehouse, too, lost its mystery as I grew older. For\r\nexploring into its darkness I found that of course it did have walls\r\nlike any common building. The things in it, too, lost their wonder. It\r\nwas as though my father had packed all the rich and romantic Far East\r\ninto common barrels and crates and then nailed down the covers. And he\r\nhimself became for me as common as his warehouse. For in his case, too,\r\nI could see the walls.\r\n\r\n"I know you now," I thought to myself. He could sit through supper\r\nnight after night and not utter a word in his gloom. But the mystery in\r\nhim was gone. Business, nothing but business. A man and a place to be\r\nlet alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it was my mother more than anyone else who drew me away from the\r\nharbor. All through those early years she was the one who never changed,\r\nthe strong sure friend I could always come back to. My mother was as\r\nsafe as our house.\r\n\r\nShe was a small, slender woman grown bodily stronger year by year by the\r\nsheer force of her spirit. I remember her smoothly parted hair, brown\r\nbut showing gray at forty, the strong, lined face and the kindly eyes\r\nwhich I saw so often lighted by that loving smile of hers for me. If my\r\nfather didn\'t care for me, I was always sure she did. I could feel her\r\nalways watching, trying to understand what I was thinking and feeling.\r\nAs when I was very small she toned down the stories she read, so she did\r\nin everything else for me, even in her religion. Though she was a strong\r\nchurch woman, I heard little from her of the terrors of hell. But I\r\nheard much of heaven and more still of a heaven on earth. "Thy will be\r\ndone on earth as it is in heaven." I can never forget how she spoke\r\nthose words as I knelt and repeated them after her--not so much in the\r\ntone of a prayer to a higher being as in one of quiet resolve to\r\nherself. To do her share, through church and hospital and charity work\r\nand the bringing up of her children, her share in the establishment of a\r\nheaven upon the earth, this was her religion.\r\n\r\nAnd this heaven on earth of my mother\'s was made up of all that was\r\n"fine" in humanity past and present. "Fine, fine!" she would say of some\r\nkind deed, of some new plan for bettering life, or of some book she was\r\nreading, some music she had heard, or of a photograph of some great\r\npainting over in Europe. All her life she had wanted to go abroad.\r\n\r\nMy mother was one of those first American women who went to college, and\r\none of that army sent out from college as school teachers all over the\r\nland. She had taught school in frontier hamlets far out West, homesick\r\nshe had looked back on the old college town in New England, and those\r\nten years of her life out West had been bare and hard, an exile. At last\r\nshe had secured a position in an expensive girls\' school in New York,\r\nand from there a few years later she had married my father. I think they\r\nhad been happy at first, I think that his work with the ships had seemed\r\nto her a gateway leading out to Europe, to all the very "finest" things.\r\nBut later, as he set his whole mind upon his warehouse worries, upon his\r\nfight for Yankee ships, a navy, subsidies, tariffs, and shut out all\r\nthought of travel, culture, friends, all but the bare, ugly business of\r\nlife--my mother had rebelled against this, had come to hate his harbor,\r\nand had determinedly set herself to help me get what she had missed.\r\n\r\nI don\'t mean that she babied me. She was too good a teacher for that. I\r\nmean she steered me through hard work away from what she saw in the\r\nharbor up toward what she felt was fine. She began when I was very\r\nlittle giving me daily lessons at home in the brief time she had to\r\nspare from her house and charity work. She made me study and she studied\r\nme. My mother, sooner or later, seemed to find out all I did or felt.\r\n\r\nOften I would hold stubbornly back. While I was going with Sam to the\r\ndocks I never once gave her a hint of my rovings. It was not until two\r\nyears after that drunken woman disaster that I suddenly told my mother\r\nabout it. I remember then she did not chide. Instead she caught the\r\nchance to draw out of me all I had learned from the harbor. I talked to\r\nher long that night, but she said little in reply. I can vividly\r\nremember, though, how she came to me a few days later and placed a "book\r\nfor young men" in my hands.\r\n\r\n"You are only twelve," she said. "It\'s a pity. But after what you have\r\nseen, my son, it is better that you know."\r\n\r\nShe did this twenty years ago. It was far in advance of what most\r\nparents did then or are doing even now for their children. And it threw\r\na flood of light into the darkest place in my mind, swept away endless\r\nforebodings, secret broodings over what until then had seemed to me the\r\nugliest, the dirtiest, the most frightening thing I had found in life.\r\n\r\n"When you meet anything ugly or bad," she told me, "I don\'t want you to\r\nturn away at once, I want you to face it and see what it is. Understand\r\nit and then leave it, and then it won\'t follow you in the dark."\r\n\r\n"Keep clean," she said. And understanding me as she did, I think she\r\nadded to herself, "And I must keep you quiet." She once told me she\r\nhoped that when I grew up I might become a professor in one of those\r\ncollege towns she loved, where I might work all my life in peace.\r\n\r\nAlthough she never said anything to me against the harbor, I knew that\r\nmy mother put all the ugliest things in life down there. And the things\r\nthat were fine were all up here.\r\n\r\n"I always like the front door of a house," she used to say, "to be wide\r\nand low with only a step or two leading up. I like it to look\r\nhospitable, as though always waiting for friends to come in."\r\n\r\nOur front door was like that, and the neighborhood it waited for was one\r\nof the quietest, the cleanest and the finest, according to her view, of\r\nany in the country. The narrow little street had wide, leisurely\r\nsidewalks and old-fashioned houses on either side, a few of red brick,\r\nbut more of brown stone with spotless white-sashed windows which were\r\ntall and narrow and rounded at the top. There were no trees, but there\r\nwere many smooth, orderly vines. Almost all the houses had wide,\r\ninviting doorways like ours, but the people they invited in were only\r\nthose who lived quietly here, shutting out New York and all the toots\r\nand rumblings of the ships and warehouses and docks below, of which they\r\nthemselves were the owners.\r\n\r\nThese people in their leisurely way talked of literature and music, of\r\nsculpture and painting and travel abroad, as their fathers and even\r\ngrandfathers had done--in times when the rest of the country, like one\r\ncolossal harbor, changing, heaving, seething, had had time for only the\r\ncrudest things, for railroads, mining camps, belching mills, vast herds\r\nof cattle and droves of sheep, for the frontier towns my mother had\r\nloathed, for a Civil War, for a Tweed Ring, for the Knights of Labor, a\r\nHaymarket riot, for the astounding growth of cities, slums, corporations\r\nand trusts, in this deep turbulent onward rush, this peopling of a\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nAnd because my father, crude and self-made and come out of the West, was\r\nof this present country, he was an intruder politely avoided by these\r\npeople of the past. The men would come sometimes at night, but they came\r\nonly on business. They went straight through to the library, whence I\r\ncould hear my father\'s voice, loud, impatient, angry, talking of what\r\nmust be done soon, or Germany and England would drive the American flag\r\nfrom the ocean and make us beggars on the seas, humbly asking the ships\r\nof our rivals to give us a share in the trade of the world. To such\r\ndisturbing meetings these grave and courteous gentlemen came less and\r\nless as the years went by.\r\n\r\nAnd so that hospitable front door of ours waited long for neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if my father was an intruder, a disturber of the peace of these\r\ncontented gentlemen, my mother was more and more liked by their wives.\r\nAs time wore on they came to our house in the afternoons, upon hospital\r\nand church affairs. And first in the church and then in a private school\r\nnear by I grew to be friends with their children.\r\n\r\nAcross the street from us at the corner there stood a huge, square\r\nbrownstone house with a garden and a wide yard around it. Two boys and a\r\nlittle girl lived here, and about them our small circle centered. Here\r\nwe played hockey in winter, part of the yard being flooded for our use;\r\nand in Spring and Autumn, ball, tag, I spy, prisoner\'s base and other\r\ngames. They were all well enough as far as they went, but all were so\r\nvery young and tame compared to my former adventures with Sam.\r\nAdventures, that was the difference. These were only games.\r\n\r\nI felt poor beside these boys, in this ample yard by their grandfather\'s\r\nhouse. I often saw his great carriage roll out of the stable behind the\r\nyard. "Coach," they called it. It had rich silver trimmings and a red\r\nthing called a "crest," and a footman and coachman in top boots. Inside\r\nthe house was a butler who was still more imposing, and a lofty room\r\nwith spacious windows called the picture gallery. But by far the most\r\nawesome of all was the white-headed grandfather of these boys, who had\r\nbeen to Europe twenty-eight times and could read and speak "every\r\nlanguage on earth," as I was told in whispers while we peeped in through\r\nhis library door. There he sat with all his books, a man so rich he\r\nnever even went to his office, a man who had owned not only warehouses\r\nbut hundreds of ships and had sent them to every land in the world!\r\nWhile, as for me, my grandfather was not even alive. I felt poor and\r\nsmall, and I did not like it.\r\n\r\nBesides, these unadventurous boys all put me down as "a queer kid." I\r\nwas middling good at most of their games and would get sudden spurts\r\nwhen I would become almost a leader. But at other times, often right in\r\nthe middle of a game, I would suddenly forget where I was and would\r\nthink of Sam, of the cannibals that I had seen, of the man who had\r\njumped from the Great Bridge, or of that drunken woman. They would catch\r\nme at it and call me queer. And I would grow hot and feel ashamed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, poor and queer as I felt at times, at others I would\r\nswell with my wisdom and importance. For what did they know, these\r\nrespectable boys, about the docks and the gangs of "Micks" deep down\r\nthere below us all as we played about in our nice little gardens. When\r\nthey called me queer, sometimes I would retort with dark hints, all\r\ngames would stop, they would gather close, and then I would tell these\r\nintense eager boys the things I had learned from the harbor. And I had\r\nthe more pleasure in the telling from the feeling of relief that now I\r\nwas safe away from it all.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the real thing, that is," I would declare impressively. But how\r\ngood it felt to me to be free of such reality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt such times we made "the Chips" stay over on their side of the yard.\r\n"The Chips" were three small admiring girls. One was my young sister\r\nSue, who was then about nine years old, long-legged, skinny and quick as\r\na flash, her black hair always flying. The second, a plump freckled\r\ngirl, was the younger sister of the boys who lived here. And the third\r\nwas a quiet little thing who lived around the corner. We called them\r\n"Chips" to annoy them. We got the term from the stout coachman in the\r\nbarn who used it with a fine sweeping contempt that included all his\r\nlady friends. We ourselves had the most profound contempt for these\r\ngirls who kept poking into our games. At times we would stop everything\r\nand take the utmost pains to explain to them that they were nothing\r\nwhatever but girls. And this would make Sue furious. She would screw up\r\nher snapping black eyes and viciously stick out her tongue and stamp her\r\nfoot and say "darn!" to show she could swear like a regular kid. And\r\nstill they hung around us.\r\n\r\nBut as time wore on we grew more indulgent, we included them more and\r\nmore. And this was largely due to me. For I took a vague curious\r\ninterest in the one who lived around the corner.\r\n\r\nHer name was Eleanore Dillon and her age was eight, and she had\r\nattractions that slowly grew. To begin with, as I became gradually\r\naware, she was much the prettiest of the three. She had light curly hair\r\ntied up in red ribbons, always _fresh_ red ribbons. Everything about her\r\nwas always fresh and clean. She had the most serious blue eyes, which at\r\ntimes would grow intent on what a tall chap of twelve like myself\r\ncondescended to tell her, and at other times wondrously confiding.\r\n\r\nEleanore first attracted me by making me a hero. It was a warm May\r\nafternoon and she was sitting on the grass with her doll and her two\r\ncompanions. Sue had stolen some matches and was using them as\r\nJackstraws. Suddenly I heard a scream, then I saw Sue racing like mad\r\ntoward the garden hose, and I saw that the white skirt of Eleanore\'s\r\ndress had caught fire. As yet there was only a little flame. She was\r\nsitting still motionless on the grass, hugging her doll, with scared\r\nround eyes. I got to her first and with my cap I beat out the flame. I\r\nwas suddenly panting, my hands were cold. But a few moments later, when\r\nSue and two of the boys came tugging the hose, it as suddenly flashed\r\nupon me that I had done a heroic thing.\r\n\r\n"Get out!" I shouted scornfully, as they started to play the hose on\r\nher. "Can\'t you see the whole fire is out?"\r\n\r\nAnd then while the plump freckled girl came screeching out of the\r\nkitchen with half the servants behind her, and presently these servants\r\nall called me "a little heero"--the one whom I had rescued looked up at\r\nme very gratefully and said,\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Boy, for not letting them squirt water on my dolly\'s clean\r\ndress."\r\n\r\n"Aw, what do I care for a doll?" I retorted ungraciously.\r\n\r\nBut I liked her from that day. She was not at all like Sue. She was\r\nquiet and knew her place. She knew that she was only a girl, how\r\nthoroughly well she knew it. And yet, although so feminine, so\r\ndeliberate and sedate, she had "a pile of ginger" deep down inside of\r\nher. In our games, whenever allowed to play, with a dogged resolution\r\nshe would come pegging along in the rear, she was a sticker, she never\r\ngave up. In winter when they flooded the yard she was the poorest skater\r\nof all, but patiently plodding along on the ice, each time she fell down\r\nshe would pick herself up with such determination that at last with a\r\njerk at her arm I said,\r\n\r\n"Here, Chip, come on and I\'ll teach you."\r\n\r\nShe came on. I can still feel her soft determined clutch on my elbow.\r\nWhen I said, "That\'s enough," she said, "Thank you, Boy," and went\r\nquietly on alone.\r\n\r\nAfter that I taught her many times. One afternoon when there was a thaw,\r\nI said,\r\n\r\n"Gee, but this ice is rotten." And then Eleanore asked me placidly,\r\n\r\n"Do you like my pretty new shoes?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that got to do with it?" I demanded indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, I guess," she said meekly.\r\n\r\nThis girl was full of mysteries. One great point in her favor was that\r\nshe had a mother "at death\'s door." This appealed to me tremendously.\r\nIt was so unusual.\r\n\r\n"How\'s your mother?" I would ask her often, just for the pleasure of\r\nhearing her answer softly,\r\n\r\n"She\'s at death\'s door, thank you."\r\n\r\nShe soon learned to skate much better, and I remember quite vividly\r\nstill the January afternoon when as the darkness deepened a silvery moon\r\nappeared overhead. I had not skated with her for a week, but now we\'d\r\nbeen skating for nearly an hour. One by one the others went home, and\r\nthe plump girl turned at the kitchen door to call back to Eleanore\r\ntauntingly,\r\n\r\n"You\'ll catch it, going home so late!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said a gentle voice at my side, and round and round we\r\nskated. The moon grew steadily brighter. Still that soft steady clutch\r\non my arm.\r\n\r\n"Now you\'d better go home," I said gruffly at last.\r\n\r\n"What time is it?" she asked me. I looked at my watch.\r\n\r\n"Gee! It\'s nearly seven o\'clock!"\r\n\r\n"What a pretty watch that is," she said in a pleased, quiet voice, but I\r\nwas not to be diverted.\r\n\r\n"Go on home, I tell you. Sit down and I\'ll take off your skates." She\r\nsighed regretfully but obeyed.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll they do to you?" I asked her when we stopped in front of her\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll try to punish me," she answered. I looked down at her\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n"Hard?" I inquired. She smiled at me.\r\n\r\n"What time is it now?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Ten minutes after seven."\r\n\r\n"Then they won\'t punish me," she said. "My father always comes home at\r\nseven." And she went placidly into the house.\r\n\r\n"A mighty smart Chip," I said to myself.\r\n\r\nI had told her a little about the docks, and one day she asked me to\r\ntake her there. I promptly refused, but patiently from time to time she\r\nrepeated her request. She wanted me to take her "just for a little\r\nwalk" down there, or she would run if I preferred. She wanted to come\r\nout after supper into her garden, which was only the third from ours,\r\nand then she would sing and I would whistle. Then I would come around by\r\nthe street and she would meet me at her front gate. I don\'t know how she\r\never persuaded me, but she did, and the plan worked splendidly. At the\r\ngate without a word I took her hand and ran down the street. Soon we\r\nwere flying. Down to the open space we came, and around across the\r\nrailroad tracks. In and out among grimy freight cars we sped. I would\r\nnot stop.\r\n\r\n"Christ!" I thought in terror. "Suppose Sam and the gang come around\r\nthis way!" I had not seen them now for years. What might not they do to\r\nher?\r\n\r\nBut she made me stop by my father\'s dock. She was gasping and her face\r\nwas red, but with her hand like a little vise on mine she stood there\r\nstaring at the ship.\r\n\r\n"Where are the heathen?" she asked at last, in a queer choking voice.\r\n\r\n"There." I pointed to a small brown man with a white skull-cap on his\r\nhead. "There\'s one. See him? Now come home!"\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute, please," she begged very softly. A moment longer she\r\nstared at him. "All right, now we\'ll go," she said.\r\n\r\nWhen I got her safe inside my gate I was in a cold sweat. This\r\nadventure, to my surprise, had been one of the most thrilling of all.\r\nAnd who\'d have thought _her_ an adventurer?\r\n\r\nHer mother died that summer while we were up in the mountains, and when\r\nwe came back we found the house empty. Her father had taken her out\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nI remember being distinctly relieved when I heard that she had gone\r\naway. For now there was something uncanny about her. It was one thing to\r\nhave a mother "at death\'s door." That had been quite exciting. But to\r\nhave one dead! There was something too awful about it. I would not have\r\nknown what to say to the girl. And, besides, the thought suddenly\r\nentered my mind--suppose my own mother were to die!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had been splendid chums, my mother and I, that long delightful summer\r\nup in the White Mountains. The mountains, we had decided together, were\r\nour favorite place to live in. "I will lift up mine eyes unto the\r\nhills," was the part of the Bible which she liked best. She loved these\r\nhills for their quiet, I loved them for the exciting adventures I had\r\nwith Sue and "Stouty," the son of the farmer with whom we stayed. But\r\nthese adventures were of a kind that my mother warmly approved of for\r\nme. They were not like those on the harbor.\r\n\r\nAn adventure to climb with Stouty and Sue up through the resinous\r\nbranches of an enormous pine on the mountainside to the hawk\'s nest in\r\nthe bare top branches, snatch the eggs and smash them, while Stouty with\r\na big thick stick would beat off the mother hawk. An adventure to\r\nclamber half the day up a bouldery path through firs and birches,\r\nlooking into black caves, peeping over steep cliffs, and at last\r\nreaching the wind-swept summit to look off through miles of emptiness.\r\nAn adventure, coming home from a picnic as evening was falling, to sit\r\nsnug in that creaking capacious wagon which belonged to Stouty\'s father,\r\nand to watch the lights and shadows that darted in and out of the pines\r\nas the lantern swung beneath our wheels.\r\n\r\nBut even up here in the mountains the harbor reached with its cold\r\nembrace. For at night it was an adventure hurriedly to undress and bury\r\nmyself in the covers in time to hear the first low rumble of "the night\r\nfreight" that went by some five miles distant. It made me think of the\r\ntrains on the docks, whose voices I had heard at night, and of the\r\nthings I had done with Sam. I would hear the mountain engine come\r\npanting impatiently up the grade. As it reached the top I would rise\r\nfrom my bed and soar off into space, in one swift rushing flight through\r\nthe darkness I would be there in the nick of time, I would swing on to a\r\nfreight car in the way Sam had shown me, climb to the top and crouching\r\nthere I would watch the dark roadway open ahead through the silent\r\nforest. Lower would sink the voice of the engine until it became a faint\r\nconfused mutter. And the rest was dreamland.\r\n\r\nThis was one of those secret games I never told my mother about--until,\r\nto my own surprise, in one of those long talks at night when she seemed\r\ndrawing me to her right out through my eyes, I blurted this out. My\r\nmother wanted to know all about it. Did my hands get cold? Yes, colder\r\nand colder, as listening here in bed I heard the first muttering of the\r\ntrain and knew that in a few moments more I would take that five-mile\r\nflight, right through the window and over the trees to the distant\r\ntrack, to be there just ahead of the on-puffing engine. My voice\r\nquivered excitedly as I spoke.\r\n\r\n"I see--I see," she said soothingly. "And when you are riding on top of\r\na car--aren\'t you ever frightened?"\r\n\r\n"No--because all the time I know that I am back there at home in my bed.\r\nI can see myself back there behind me."\r\n\r\n"Do you fall asleep in bed--or are you still on the top of the car the\r\nlast thing you can remember?"\r\n\r\n"Most always on the top of the car."\r\n\r\n"And when you sleep--do you always dream?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--that\'s the finest part of it."\r\n\r\n"Do you ever dream of Sam?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And all those things you did on the harbor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--all."\r\n\r\nFor some moments she sat by my bedside quietly stroking one of my hands.\r\n\r\n"Billy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, mother." I was growing impatient, I wished she would go, for now\r\nit was nearly time for the train.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever played other games like that? I mean where you leave\r\nyourself and look back--and see your own body behind you."\r\n\r\n"Yes--in bed in Brooklyn when I was quite little."\r\n\r\n"Where did you go from your bed?"\r\n\r\n"I went to the end of the garden. I heard drunken sailors and dockers\r\nshouting in that vile saloon below." This was not true. What I had\r\nreally done was to lie in bed and whisper, "_Suppose_ I were out\r\nthere"--which is very different. I was too young then to have learned\r\nthe real trick. But now I was so proud of it that I honestly thought I\r\nhad always known how. "It was a game I had with the harbor," I said.\r\n\r\n"With the harbor." I felt her hand slowly tighten on mine. Then all at\r\nonce as we heard the first low grumble of the freight train coming, my\r\nmother\'s hold grew tighter and tighter. "Open your eyes." I opened them\r\nquickly, for her voice was sharp and stern. She held me until the sound\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear it any longer?" she asked quietly at last.\r\n\r\n"No," I whispered. My breath still came fast.\r\n\r\n"Neither do I." There was another silence. "Let\'s go and sit by the\r\nwindow," she said.\r\n\r\nAnd there she talked to me of the stars. How great they were and how\r\nvery quiet. She said that the greatest men in the world were almost\r\nalways quiet like that. They never let their hands get cold.\r\n\r\nOften after that in the evenings just before I went to bed we had these\r\ntalks about the stars. And not only in the mountains. On sparkling\r\nfrosty winter nights we watched them over the harbor. And the things she\r\nsaid about them were so utterly absorbing that I would never think to\r\nlook down, would barely hear the toots and the puffings and grinding of\r\nwheels from that infernal region below. For always when she spoke of\r\nthe stars my mother spoke of great men too, the men who had done the\r\n"finest" things--a few in the clash and jar of life like Washington and\r\nLincoln, but most of them more quietly, by preaching, writing, painting,\r\ncomposing, sermons, books, pictures and music so "fine" that all the\r\nbest people on earth had known about them and loved them.\r\n\r\nAs I grew older she read to me more and more about these men. And\r\nsometimes I would feel deeply content as though I had found what I\r\nwanted. But more often I would feel myself swell up big inside of me,\r\nrestless, worrying, groping for something. I didn\'t know what I wanted\r\nthen, but I do know now as I look back, and I think there are thousands\r\nof children like me, the kind who are called "queer kids" by their\r\nplaymates, who are all groping for much the same thing.\r\n\r\n"Where is the Golden Age to-day?" they are asking. "We hear of all this\r\nfrom our mothers. We hear of brave knights and warriors, of God and\r\nChrist as they walked around on earth like regular people, of saints and\r\npreachers, writers and painters. But where are the great men living now?\r\nNot in our house nor on our street, nor in school nor in our church on\r\nthe corner. There is nothing there that thrills us. Why isn\'t there?\r\nWhat is the matter? We are no longer babies, we are becoming big boys\r\nand girls. What will we do when we are grown up? Has everything fine\r\nalready been done? Is there no chance for us to be great and to do\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\nIt was to questionings like these that my mother had led me up from the\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd to such questionings I believe that for many children of my kind\r\nthere is often some familiar place--a schoolroom or a commonplace\r\nstreet, or a dreary farm in winter, a grimy row of factories or the ugly\r\nmouth of a mine--that mutely answers,\r\n\r\n"No. There are no more great men for you, nor any fine things left to be\r\ndone. There is nothing else left in the world but me. And you\'d better\r\nstop trying to find it."\r\n\r\nIn my case this message came from the harbor, that one part of the\r\nmodern world which looked up at me steadily day after day. Vaguely\r\nstruggle as I would to build up fine things in the present from all that\r\nmy mother brought out of the past, the harbor would not let me. For what\r\nI clothed it soon stripped naked, what I built it soon tore down.\r\n\r\n"When you were little," it seemed to say, "for you I was filled with\r\nthrilling idols--cannibals and condors, Sam, strange wonder-ships and\r\nsailors adventuring to heathen lands. But then I dragged these idols\r\ndown and made you see me as I am. And as I showed myself to you, so I\'ll\r\nshow up all other wonderful places or men that your mother would have\r\nyou believe in."\r\n\r\nIt did this, as I remember it, in the easiest most trivial ways, like\r\nsome huge beast that flicks off a fly and then lumbers unconcernedly on.\r\n\r\nMy mother by years of patient work had built up my religion, filling it\r\nwith the grand figures of God and Christ and his followers down to the\r\npresent time, ending with Henry Ward Beecher. When this man died I felt\r\nawe at her silent grief. All at once the idea popped into my head that I\r\ntoo might become a great preacher. And still greater, I soon learned, I\r\nmight become a preacher who went far off to heathen lands, braving\r\ncannibals and death and giving to thousands of heathen eternal happiness\r\nand life. Our church was sending out such a man. I heard him described\r\nas a hero of God, and I thought of pictures I had seen of saints and\r\nmartyrs with soft haloes around their heads.\r\n\r\nBut this hero of God came down to the harbor. He was to sail for China\r\nfrom my father\'s dock. He wore, I remember, a brown derby hat and a\r\nlittle top coat. He was thin, with stooping shoulders, he was flustered\r\nin the excitement of leaving, nervously laughing as he shook hands with\r\nadmiring women and talking fast in his high jerky voice. Two big dockers\r\ntrundled his trunks. I saw them grin at the little man and spit tobacco\r\njuice his way. My father came by, shot one contemptuous glance, and then\r\nwent on board to his business. I looked back at the hero. Off fell the\r\nhalo from his head.\r\n\r\n"No," I said gloomily to myself, "I never want to be like you." And\r\ndrearily I looked around. What heaps and heaps of business here. What an\r\nimmense gray harbor. I found no more thrills in church after that.\r\n\r\nAnd as with religion, so with love. In reading of men of the Golden Age\r\nI came upon stories of high romance that made me strangely happy. But I\r\nsaw no love of this kind in our house. I saw my mother and father living\r\nsharply separate lives, and I saw few kisses between them. I saw my\r\nfather absorbed in his business, with little time for my mother. And I\r\nblamed this on the harbor. Long ago the same grim place had taught me\r\nsomething else about this many-sided passion between men and women, and\r\none day it rose suddenly up in my mind:\r\n\r\nI must have been about fifteen when my little friend Eleanore Dillon\r\ncame back. Soon she and Sue were intimate chums, they went to school\r\ntogether. My mother invited her up to the mountains, and there I was\r\nwith her a good deal. She was now nearly twelve years old, and the life\r\nin the West with her father had left her sturdy as you please. And yet\r\nsomehow she still seemed to me the same feminine little creature, and as\r\nshe told me stories of the life out West, where her father, who was an\r\nengineer, had built bridges, planned out harbors and new cities, I would\r\nwonder vaguely about her. What a fresh, clean little person to be\r\ntalking of such places.\r\n\r\nShe was talking to me in this way one drowsy August afternoon. We had\r\nbeen fishing down on the river, and now on our way home up the long hot\r\nslope of the meadow we had stopped to cool ourselves in the shadow of a\r\nhaystack. It was fragrant there. Presently, from the top of the stack\r\nclose over our heads, a bird poured forth a ravishing song. And Eleanore\r\nwith a deep "Oh-h" of delight threw both her hands behind her head, sank\r\nback in the hay and lay there close beside me. Her eyes were shut and\r\nshe was smiling to herself. Then as the song of the bird bubbled on, I\r\nfelt suddenly a little shock, a new disturbing feeling. Breathlessly I\r\nwatched her face. The song stopped and Eleanore opened her eyes, met\r\nmine, and closed them quickly. I saw a slight tightening of her\r\nfeatures. I grew anxious at once and awkward. I wanted to get away.\r\n\r\nBut as I made a first uneasy movement, a bit of bright color caught my\r\neye. It was one of her red garters which had slipped down from beneath\r\nher skirt. And all at once out of my memory rose a picture of years ago,\r\na picture from the harbor, of that fat drunken girl I had seen. She too\r\nhad worn red garters--in fact, little else! With disgusting vividness up\r\nshe came! And I jumped trembling to my feet.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going home," I said roughly, and left my small companion.\r\n\r\nI kept away from her after that. And even the following winter, when\r\nshe came over often to our house to spend the night with Sue, I did my\r\nbest to avoid her. I avoided all Sue\'s friends. I did not keep girls\r\nquite out of my thoughts, I had spells now and then when I would read\r\nabout them in novels, papers and magazines, anything I could lay hands\r\non. I would read hungrily, at times almost wistfully. But all the\r\nstories that I read, however romantic, could never quite overbalance for\r\nme that giggling woman I had seen.\r\n\r\n"This is what love can be these days, foul as two pigs in a sty," said\r\nthe harbor.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened again with war and the great idea of giving\r\none\'s life for one\'s country.\r\n\r\nBy countless eager questionings I had forced my mother to include among\r\nour heroes men like Napoleon, Nelson and Grant, and after I gave up\r\nhopes of the church these men for a time became greatest of all. You\r\nneeded no mother to help you here. It was the easiest thing in the world\r\nto picture yourself leading charges or standing high up on a hill like\r\nGrant, quietly smoking a black cigar and sending your orderlies on the\r\nmad gallop out to all corners of the field. My hill grew very real to\r\nme. It had three wind-swept trees on top and I stood just in front of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen the war with Spain broke out I was still in my \'teens, still rather\r\nthin and by no means tall, but I made up my mind to try to enlist. Even\r\nnow I can shut my eyes and see again that long night on the docks when I\r\nwatched two regiments embark on ships which were to sail at dawn. With\r\nthe uniforms, the crash of bands, the flags, the cheers, the women\r\nlaughing and crying, the harbor seemed all on my side that night.\r\n\r\n"This is certainly what I want!" I thought.\r\n\r\nBut my father forbade my going. He was not only stern, he was savage.\r\nFor once he came out of himself and talked. And his talk was not only\r\nagainst this war but against all wars. The Civil War was the worst of\r\nall. This was the more a surprise to me because I knew that he himself\r\nhad been with the Boys of Sixty One, I had often boasted about it. But\r\nnow I learned he had not fought at all, he had been a mere commissary\r\nclerk moving rations and blankets on freight trains!\r\n\r\n"The business side of war," he said. "And when you\'ve seen that side of\r\nit you know how rotten a big war is! Men in the North made millions by\r\nsending such rotten meat to the front that we had to live on the people\r\ndown South, we had to go into their farms and plantations and plunder\r\ndefenseless women and children of all they had to eat! That\'s war! And\r\nwar is filthy stinking camps where men die of fever and scurvy like\r\nflies--and war is field hospitals so rotten in their management that you\r\nsee the wounded in long lines--packed together like bloody\r\nsardines--bleeding to death for the lack of care! When they\'re dead you\r\ndig big trenches and you pile \'em in like dogs! In time of war remember\r\npeace--and then you\'ll be ashamed you\'re there!"\r\n\r\nFor a moment I was struck dumb with surprise. What was this strange fire\r\ndeep down within my father\'s soul that could give out such a flash?\r\nConfusedly I wondered. A sudden idea crossed my mind.\r\n\r\n"But if that\'s how you feel," I retorted, "why are you always talking\r\nabout the battleships we need? You want a big navy----"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he snapped, "to keep this country _out_ of war! If you live long\r\nenough you\'ll see what I mean--remember then what I\'m telling you! This\r\ncountry needs a navy so big she can trade wherever she likes and make\r\nother nations leave her alone! But she doesn\'t want war! Sixty One was\r\nenough! Some day when you get a man\'s eyes in your head you\'ll see what\r\nthat did to this harbor!"\r\n\r\nI had it now, the cause of all his curious wrath! War had hurt his\r\nharbor! How or why I did not care. Could this harbor of his stand\r\nnothing heroic? Patriotism, religion, love--must they all be shoved\r\naside to make way for his dull business?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout a year later I was torn for months between two careers. Should I\r\nbecome a great musician or a famous writer? The idea of writing came to\r\nme first, I got it from "Pendennis," and for a time it took hold so hard\r\nI thought I was nicely settled for life. But then my mother read aloud\r\n"The Lives of Great Musicians," and within a few weeks the piano lessons\r\nwhich for years I had thought so dull became an absorbing passion. My\r\nmother bought me a photograph of one of the Beethoven portraits, and\r\naround it over my desk I tacked up pictures of famous pianists that I\r\ncut from magazines. I went to concerts in New York. Better still, my\r\nteacher secured me admittance to some orchestra rehearsals, where like a\r\nreal professional, all mere amateurs shut out, I could sit in the dark\r\nand listen, and shut my eyes and hold my head between my hands. I was\r\ncomposing! After a month or two of this feverish life I remember the\r\npride with which I wrote "Opus 38" over my last composition. My rapidity\r\nwas astounding!\r\n\r\nBut one day my teacher, a kind tactful German, told me that Beethoven,\r\nwhen he was composing, had not always shut himself up in a room and\r\nscowled with both hands to his head, as in the portrait of him I had,\r\nbut had rather gone out into the world.\r\n\r\n"The Master found his music," he said, "by listening to the life close\r\naround him."\r\n\r\n"He did?" I became uneasy at once, for again I felt myself being pushed\r\ntoward that eternal harbor.\r\n\r\n"If I were you," my relentless monitor went on, "and desired to become\r\nin music the great voice of my country"--I looked at him quickly but saw\r\nno smile--"I should watch the great ships down there below, I should\r\nlisten to them with an artist\'s ears. They are here from all over the\r\nworld, these ships, they are manned by men of all nations. I should\r\nlisten to the songs of these men. I have heard," he added reflectively,\r\n"that some of their songs are centuries old. Beethoven gathered only the\r\nfolk songs of his country. But you in your city of all nations might\r\ngather the folk songs of all the seas."\r\n\r\nI turned quickly. I had been walking the room.\r\n\r\n"I have heard the sailors sing," I said, "ever since I was a little kid\r\nout there in the garden." I scowled in the effort to search my soul, my\r\nartist\'s soul. "Yes," I added triumphantly, "and sometimes it brought a\r\nlump in my throat!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! Now you are a musician!"\r\n\r\n"I will see what I can do," I said.\r\n\r\nSo again I tackled the harbor. By day it was quite impossible, all toots\r\nand blares, the most frightful discords--but at night its vulgar\r\nloudness was toned down sufficiently so that a fellow with artist\'s ears\r\ncould really stand listening to its life, especially if I did not go too\r\nclose but listened from my window. Here with uglier sounds subdued I\r\ncould catch low voices, snatches of song and now and then a chorus. "The\r\nfolk songs of the Seven Seas!" How that phrase took hold of me!\r\n\r\nI went for information to an old dock watchman who had been a sailor.\r\n\r\n"Songs? Why sure!" he answered. "It must be the chanties ye mean."\r\n\r\n"Chanties?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it. I\'ve been told the word\'s French."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Chanter!"\r\n\r\n"No--chanty. An\' the man that sings the verses, he\'s called the\r\nchantyman. He sings while the crew heaves on the ropes an\' they all come\r\nin on the chorus. If he\'s a real good chantyman he makes up new verses\r\nevery time, a kind of a yarn he spins while he sings."\r\n\r\nSoon after this, toward the end of a warm, windy April night, I awoke\r\nand heard them singing. I jumped up and went to my window. From the dock\r\nnext to my father\'s, over the line of warehouse roofs, I could see the\r\nimmense white sails already slowly rising into the starlit night.\r\nQuickly I threw on some clothes and hurried down to the docks. The\r\nwaterfront was empty, swept clean of all that I disliked. Only overhead\r\na few billowy clouds, the soft rush of the wind, a slight flush in the\r\neast, it was almost dawn. Here and there gleamed a light, red, green or\r\nyellow, with a phantom tug or barge around it, moving over the black of\r\nthe water. Not silence but something richer was here--the confused\r\nmysterious murmuring, the creaking and the breathing of the sleeping\r\nport. And out of this those voices singing.\r\n\r\nI drew nearer slowly. Hungrily I tried to take in the details of color\r\nand sound. And I felt suddenly such a deep delight as I had never\r\ndreamed of. To look around and listen and gather it into me and\r\nremember. This was great, no doubt about it--it fitted into all that was\r\nfine!\r\n\r\n"This is really what I want to do--I\'d like to learn to do it well--I\'d\r\nlike to do it all my life!"\r\n\r\nSlower, more fearfully, I drew near. Would anything happen to spoil it\r\nall? There she lay, the long white ship, laden deep, settled low in the\r\nwater. I could see the lines of little dark men heaving together at the\r\nropes. Each time they hove they sang the refrain, which, no doubt, was\r\ncenturies old, a song of the winds, the big bullies of the ocean,\r\ncalling to each other as in some wild storm at sea they buffeted the\r\ntiny men who clung to the masts and spars of ships:\r\n\r\n    "Blow the man down, bullies,\r\n    Blow him right down!\r\n    Hey! Hey! Blow the man down!\r\n    Give us the time to blow the man down!"\r\n\r\nBut what were the verses? I could hear the plaintive tenor voice of the\r\nchantyman who sang them--now low and almost mournful, now passionate,\r\nthrilling up into the night, as though yearning for all that was hid in\r\nthe heavens. Could a man like that feel things like that? But what were\r\nthe words he was singing, this yarn he was spinning in his song?\r\n\r\nI came around by the foot of the slip and walked rapidly up the dockshed\r\ntoward one of its wide hatchways. The singing had stopped, but as I drew\r\nclose a rough voice broke the silence:\r\n\r\n"Sing it again, Paddy!"\r\n\r\nI looked out. Close by on the deck, in the hard blue glare of an\r\narc-light, were some twenty men, dirty, greasy, ragged, sweating, all\r\ngripping the ropes and waiting for Paddy, who rolled his quid in his\r\nmouth, spat twice, and then began:\r\n\r\n    "As I went awalking down Paradise Street\r\n    A pretty young maiden I chanced for to meet."\r\n\r\nA heave on the ropes and a deafening roar:\r\n\r\n    "Blow the man down, bullies,\r\n    Blow him right down!\r\n    Hey! Hey! Blow the man down!"\r\n\r\nAgain the solo voice, plaintiff and tender:\r\n\r\n    "By her build I took her for Dutch.\r\n    She was square in the stuns\'l and bluff in the bow."\r\n\r\nThe rest was a detailed account of the night spent with the maiden. Roar\r\non roar rose the boisterous chorus: "Blow the man down, bullies, blow\r\nhim right down!" The big patched, dirty sails went jerking and flapping\r\nup toward the stars, which from here were so faint they could barely be\r\nseen. And the ship moved out on the harbor.\r\n\r\n"There go the folk songs of the seas," I thought disgustedly, looking\r\nout on the water now showing itself grease-mottled in the first raw\r\nlight of day.\r\n\r\nI tried other songs with my artist\'s ears and found them all much like\r\nthe first, the music like the very stars, the words like the grease and\r\nscum on the water. I was about giving up my search when I met my old\r\nfriend, the watchman.\r\n\r\n"Well, did ye find the chanties?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said. "They can\'t be printed." His old eyes twinkled merrily:\r\n\r\n"Of course they can\'t. An\' _most_ songs an\' stories can\'t. But I\'ll give\r\nye a nice little song ye can print. It\'s the oldest chanty of \'em all.\r\nI\'ll try to remember an\' write it down."\r\n\r\nHere is the song he gave me:\r\n\r\nROLLING HOME\r\n\r\n    To Australia\'s fair-haired maidens\r\n    We will bid our last good-bye.\r\n    We are going home to England,\r\n    We may never more see you.\r\n\r\n          Rolling home, rolling home,\r\n          Rolling home across the sea,\r\n          Rolling home to merry England,\r\n          Rolling home dear land to thee.\r\n\r\n    We will leave you our best wishes\r\n    As we leave your rocky shores,\r\n    We are going home to England,\r\n    We may never see you more.\r\n          Rolling home....\r\n\r\n    Up aloft amidst her rigging\r\n    Spreading out her snow white sails,\r\n    Like a bird with outstretched pinions,\r\n    On we speed before the gale.\r\n          Rolling home....\r\n\r\n    And the wild waves, as we leave them,\r\n    Seem to murmur as they roll;\r\n    There are hands and hearts to greet thee\r\n    In that land to which you go.\r\n          Rolling home....\r\n\r\n    Cheer up, Jack, fond hearts await thee,\r\n    And kind welcomes everywhere;\r\n    There are hands and hearts to greet thee,\r\n    Kind caresses from the fair.\r\n\r\n          Rolling home, rolling home,\r\n          Rolling home across the sea,\r\n          Rolling home to merry England,\r\n          Rolling home dear land to thee.\r\n\r\n"Do they ever sing those words?" I asked suspiciously. The old Irishman\r\nlooked steadily back.\r\n\r\n"Sure they sing \'em--sometimes," he said. "It\'s the same thing as them\r\nother songs--only nicer put. Put to be printed," he added.\r\n\r\nHe found me others "put to be printed." Soon I had quite a collection.\r\nAnd with the help of my German teacher I wrote down the music.\r\n\r\n"There are not enough for a book," he said. "Why don\'t you write an\r\narticle, tell where you found them, put them in, and send it to a paper?\r\nSo you can give them to the world."\r\n\r\nThis I at once set out to do. In the writing I found again that deep\r\ndelight I had had on the dock, just far enough off to miss the dirt, the\r\nsweat and the words of the song. I showed the article to my mother, and\r\nshe was surprised and delighted. Working together, in less than a week\r\nwe had polished it off. I heard her read it aloud to my father, I\r\nwatched his face, and I saw the grim smile that came over it as he asked\r\nme,\r\n\r\n"Are those the words you heard them sing?"\r\n\r\n"Not all of them are," I answered. And suddenly, somehow or other, I\r\nfelt guilty, as though I had done something wrong. But angrily I shook\r\nit off. Why should I always give in to his harbor? This that I had\r\nwritten was fine! This was Art! At last in spite of him and his docks I\r\nhad found something great that I could do!\r\n\r\nWhen the article was taken by a Sunday paper in New York and a check for\r\neight dollars was sent me with a brief but flattering letter, my pride\r\nand hopes rose high. The eight dollars I spent on a pin for my mother,\r\nas "Pendennis" or some other boy genius had done. When the article\r\nappeared in the paper my mother bought fifty copies and gave them out to\r\nour neighbors. There was nothing to shock such neighbors here, and they\r\npraised me highly for what they called my "real descriptive power."\r\n\r\n"That boy will go far," I heard one cultured old gentleman say. And I\r\nlost no time in starting out. No musical career for me, down came\r\nBeethoven from my wall, for I was now a writer. And not of mere\r\narticles, either. Inside of six months I had written a dozen short\r\nstories, and when each of these in turn was rejected I began to plan out\r\na five-act play. But here my mother stopped me.\r\n\r\n"You\'re trying to go too fast," she said. "Think of it, you are barely\r\nnineteen. You must give up everything else just now and spend all your\r\ntime getting ready for college. For if you are going to be a strong\r\nwriter, as I hope, you need to learn so many things first. And you will\r\nfind them all in college--as I did once when I was young," she added a\r\nlittle wistfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing I needed in college was a good thorough dressing down.\r\nAnd this I got without any delay. In the first few weeks my artist\'s\r\nears and eyes and soul were hazed to a frazzle. From "that boy who will\r\ngo far" I became "you damn young freshman." I was told to make love to a\r\nhorse\'s hind leg, I was made to perch on a gatepost and read the\r\ntenderest passages of "Romeo and Juliet," replacing Romeo\'s name by my\r\nown, and Juliet\'s by that of stout Mrs. Doogan, who scrubbed floors in a\r\ndormitory close by. Refusals only made matters painful. Besides, I was\r\ntold by a freshman friend that I\'d better fit in or I\'d "queer" myself.\r\n\r\nThis dread of "queering" myself at first did me a world of good. Dumped\r\nin this community of over a thousand callow youths, three hundred in my\r\nclass alone and each one absorbed in getting acquainted, fitting in,\r\nmaking friends and a place for himself, I was soon struggling for a\r\nfoothold as hard as the rest. Within a month the thing I wanted above\r\nall else was to shed my genius and become "a good mixer" in the crowd.\r\n\r\nThis drew me at first from books to athletics. Though still slight of\r\nbuild I was wiry, high-strung and quick of movement. I had a snub nose\r\nand sandy hair, and I was tough, with a hard-set jaw. And I now went\r\ninto the football world with a passion and a patience that landed me at\r\nthe end of the season--one of the substitute quarterbacks on the\r\nfreshman team. I did not get into a single game, I was only used on the\r\n"scrub" in our practice. This made for a wholesome humility and a real\r\nlove of my college.\r\n\r\nThe football season over, I tried for the daily paper. One of the\r\nfreshman candidates for the editorial Spring elections, I became a daily\r\nreporter slave. Here at first I drew on my "queer" past, turning all my\r\n"descriptive powers" to use. But a fat senior editor called "Pop"\r\ninquired one day with a sneer, "For God\'s sake, Freshman, why these\r\nflowers?" And the flowers forthwith dropped out of my style. At all\r\nhours, day and night, to the almost entire neglect of studies, I went\r\nabout college digging up news--not the trivial news of the faculty\'s\r\ndull, puny plans for the development of our minds, but the real vital\r\nnews of our college life, news of the things we were here for, the\r\nthings by which a man got on, news of all the athletic teams, of the\r\nglee, mandolin and banjo clubs, of "proms," of class and fraternity\r\nelections, mass meetings and parades. Ferreting my way into all nooks\r\nand crannies of college life, ears keen for hints and rumors, alert to\r\n"scoop" my eighteen reporter rivals--the more I learned the better I\r\nloved. And when in the Spring I was one of the five freshman editors\r\nchosen, the conquest was complete. No more artist\'s soul for me. I was\r\npart and parcel of college life.\r\n\r\nTogether with my companions I assumed a genial tolerance toward all\r\nthose poor dry devils known to us as "profs." I remember the weary sighs\r\nof our old college president as he monotoned through his lectures on\r\nethics to the tune of the cracking of peanuts, which an old darky sold\r\nto us at the entrance to the hall. It was a case of live and let live.\r\nHe let us eat and we let him talk. With the physics prof, who was known\r\nas "Madge the Scientist," our indulgence went still further. We took no\r\ndisturbing peanuts there and we let him drone his hour away without an\r\ninterruption, except perhaps an occasional snore. We were so good to\r\nhim, I think, because of his sense of humor. He used to stop talking now\r\nand then and with a quizzical hopeless smile he would look about the\r\nhall. And we would all smile broadly back, enjoying to the full with\r\nhim the droll farce of our presence there. "Go to it, Madge," someone\r\nwould murmur. And the work of revealing the wonders of this material\r\nuniverse would limp quietly along. In examinations Madge gave no marks,\r\nat least not to the mass of us. If he had, over half of us would have\r\nbeen dropped, so he "flunked" the worst twenty and let the rest through.\r\n\r\nThe faculty, as a whole, appeared to me no less fatigued. Most of them\r\nlectured as though getting tired, the others as though tired out. There\r\nwere a few lonely exceptions but they had to fight against heavy odds.\r\n\r\nThe hottest fighter of all against this classic torpor was a tall,\r\njoyous Frenchman who gestured not only with his hands but with his\r\neloquent knees as well. His subject was French literature, but from this\r\nat a moment\'s notice he would dart off into every phase of French life.\r\nThere was nothing in life, according to him, that was not a part of\r\nliterature. In college he was considered quite mad.\r\n\r\nI met him not long ago in New York. We were both hanging to straps in\r\nthe subway and we had but a moment before he got off.\r\n\r\n"I have read you," he said, "in the magazines. And from what you write I\r\nthink you can tell me. What was the trouble with me at college?" I\r\nlooked into his black twinkling eyes.\r\n\r\n"Great Scott!" I said suddenly. "You were alive!"\r\n\r\n"Merci! Au revoir, monsieur!"\r\n\r\nWhat a desert of knowledge it was back there. Our placid tolerance of\r\nthe profs included the books they gave us. The history prof gave us ten\r\nbooks of collateral reading. Each book, if we could pledge our honor as\r\ngentlemen that we had read it, counted us five in examination. On the\r\nnight before the examination I happened to enter the room of one of our\r\nfootball giants, and found him surrounded by five freshmen, all of whom\r\nwere reading aloud. One was reading a book on Russia, another the life\r\nof Frederick the Great, a third was patiently droning forth Napoleon\'s\r\nwar on Europe, while over on the window-seat the other two were racing\r\nthrough volumes one and two of Carlyle\'s French Revolution. The room was\r\na perfect babel of sound. But the big man sat and smoked his pipe, his\r\nhonor safe and the morrow secure. In later years, whatever might happen\r\nacross the sea would find this fellow fully prepared, a wise,\r\nintelligent judge of the world, with a college education.\r\n\r\n"This reminds me," he said, "of last summer--when I did Europe in three\r\nweeks with Dad."\r\n\r\nThe main idea in all courses was to do what you had to but no more. One\r\nday an English prof called upon me to define the difference between a\r\nnovel and a book of science.\r\n\r\n"About the same difference," I replied, "as between an artist\'s painting\r\nand a mathematical drawing."\r\n\r\n"Bootlick, bootlick," I heard in murmurs all over the hall. I had\r\nanswered better than I had to. Hence I had licked the professor\'s boots.\r\nI did not offend in this way again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut early in my sophomore year, when the novelty had worn away, I began\r\nto do some thinking. Was there nothing else here? My mother and I had\r\nhad talks at home, and she had told me plainly that unless I sent home\r\nbetter reports I could not finish my four years\' course. And after all,\r\nshe wasn\'t a fool, there was something in that idea of hers--that here\r\nin this quiet old town, so remote from the harbor and business, a fellow\r\nought to be getting "fine" things, things that would help him all his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"But look what I\'ve got!" I told myself. "When I came here what was I? A\r\nlittle damn prig! And look at me now!"\r\n\r\n"All right, look ahead. I\'m toughened up, I\'ve had some good things\r\nknocked into me and a lot of fool things knocked out of me. But that\'s\r\njust it. Are all the fine things fool things? Don\'t I still want to\r\nwrite? Sure I do. Well, what am I going to write about? What do I know\r\nof the big things of life? I was always hunting for what was great. I\'m\r\nnever hunting for it now, and unless I get something mighty quick my\r\nfather will make me go into his business. What am I going to do with my\r\nlife?"\r\n\r\nAt first I honestly tried to "pole," to find whether, after all, I\r\ncouldn\'t break through the hard dry crust of books and lectures down\r\ninto what I called "the real stuff." But the deeper I dug the drier it\r\ngrew. Vaguely I felt that here was crust and only crust, and that for\r\nsome reason or other it was meant that this should be so, because in the\r\nfresh bubbling springs and the deep blazing fires whose presence I could\r\nfeel below there was something irritating to profs and disturbing to\r\nthose who paid them. These profs, I thought confusedly, had about as\r\nmuch to do with life as had that little "hero of God" who had cut such a\r\npitiful figure when he came close to the harbor. And more pitiful still\r\nwere the "polers," the chaps who were working for high marks. They\r\nthought of marks and little else. They thrived on crust, these fellows,\r\ncramming themselves with words and rules, with facts, dates, theorems\r\nand figures, in order to become professors themselves and teach the same\r\nstuff to other "polers." There was a story of one of them who stayed in\r\nhis room and crammed all through the big football game of the season,\r\nand at night when told we had won remarked blithely,\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s splendid! I think I\'ll go out and have a pretzel!"\r\n\r\nGod, what a life, I thought to myself! None of that for me! And so I\r\nleft the "polers."\r\n\r\nBut now in my restless groping around for realities in life that would\r\nthrill me, things that I could write about, I began trying to test\r\nthings out by talking about them with my friends. What did a fellow want\r\nmost in life--what to do, what to get and to be? What was there really\r\nin business beside the making of money? In medicine, law and the other\r\nprofessions, in art, in getting married, in this idea of God and a\r\nheaven, or in the idea I vaguely felt now filtering through the nation,\r\nthat a man owed his life to his country in time of peace as in time of\r\nwar. The harbor with rough heavy jolts had long ago started me thinking\r\nabout questions of this kind. Now I tackled them again and tried to talk\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nAnd at once I found I was "queering" myself. For these genial companions\r\nof mine had laid a most decided taboo upon all topics of this kind. They\r\ndid so because to discuss them meant to openly think and feel, and to\r\nthink or feel intensely, about anything but athletics and other things\r\nprescribed by the crowd, was bad form to say the least.\r\n\r\nBad form to talk in any such fashion of what we were going to make of\r\nour lives. Nobody cared to warm up on the subject. Many had nothing at\r\nall in sight and put off the whole idea as a bore. Others were already\r\nfixed, they had positions waiting in law and business offices, in\r\nfactories, mines, mills and banks, and they took these positions as\r\nsettled and sure.\r\n\r\n"Why?" I would argue impatiently. "How do you know it\'s what you want\r\nmost?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I guess it\'ll do as well as another."\r\n\r\n"But damn it all, why not have a look? We can have a big look now, we\'ve\r\ngot a chance to broaden out before we jump into our little jobs--to see\r\nall the jobs and size \'em up and look at \'em as a part of the world!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, biff." I got little or no response. The greater part of these\r\ndecent likable fellows could not warm up to anything big, they simply\r\nhadn\'t it in them.\r\n\r\n"Why in hell do you want me to get all hot?" drawled one fat sluggard of\r\na friend. "I\'ll keep alive when the time comes." And he and his kind set\r\nthe standard for all. Sometimes a chap who could warm up, who had the\r\nreal stuff in him, would "loosen up" about his life on some long tramp\r\nwith me alone. But back in college his lips were sealed. It was not\r\nexactly that he was ashamed, it was simply that with his college friends\r\nsuch talk seemed utterly out of place.\r\n\r\n"Look out, Bill," said one affectionately. "You\'ll queer yourself if you\r\nkeep on."\r\n\r\nThe same held true of religion. An upper classman, if he felt he had to,\r\nmight safely become a leader of freshmen in the Y. M. C. A. But when one\r\nSunday evening I disturbed a peaceful pipe-smoking crowd by wondering\r\nwhy it was that we were all so bored in chapel, there fell an\r\nembarrassing silence--until someone growled good-humoredly, "Don\'t bite\r\noff more\'n you can chew." Nobody wanted to drop his religion, he simply\r\nwanted to let it alone. I remember one Sunday in chapel, in the midst of\r\na long sermon, how our sarcastic old president woke us up with a start.\r\n\r\n"I was asked," he said, "if we had any free thinkers here. \'No,\' I\r\nreplied. \'We have not yet advanced that far. For it takes half as much\r\nthinking to be a free thinker as it does to believe in God.\'"\r\n\r\nAnd I remember the night in our sophomore club when the news came like a\r\nthunderclap that one of our members had been killed pole-vaulting at a\r\ntrack meet in New York. It was our habit, in our new-found manliness, to\r\neat with our hats on, shout and sing, and speak of our food as\r\n"tapeworm," "hemorrhage," and the like. I remember how we sat that\r\nnight, silent, not a word from the crowd--one starting to eat, then\r\nseeing it wasn\'t the thing to do, and staring blankly like the rest.\r\nThey were terrible, those stares into reality. That clutching pain of\r\ngrief was real, so real it blotted everything out. Later some of us in\r\nmy room began to talk in low voices of what a good fellow he had been.\r\nThen some chap from the Y. M. C. A. proposed timidly to lead us in\r\nprayer. What a glare he got from all over the room! "Damn fool," I heard\r\nsomeone mutter. Bad form!\r\n\r\nPolitics also were tabooed. Here again there were exceptions. A still\r\nfiery son of the South could rail about niggers, rapes and lynchings and\r\nthe need for disenfranchising the blacks. It was good fun to hear him.\r\nMoreover, a fellow who was a good speaker, and needed the money, might\r\nstump the state for either political party, and his accounts were often\r\namusing. But to sit down and talk about the trusts, graft, trade unions,\r\nstrikes, or the tariff or the navy, the Philippines, "the open door," or\r\nany other of the big questions that even then, ten years ago, were\r\nbeginning to shake the country, and that we would all be voting on soon?\r\nNo. The little Bryan club was a joke. And one day when a socialist\r\nspeaker struck town the whole college turned out in parade, waving red\r\nsweaters and firing "bombs" and roaring a wordless Marseillaise! We\r\nwanted no solemn problems here!\r\n\r\nFinally, it was distinctly bad form to talk about sex. Not to tell\r\n"smutty stories," they were welcomed by the average crowd. But to look\r\nat it squarely, as I tried to do, and get some light upon what would be\r\ndoubtless the most vital part of our future lives--this simply wasn\'t\r\ndone. What did women mean to us, I asked. What did prostitutes mean at\r\npresent? What would wives mean later on? And all this talk about\r\nmistresses and this business of free love, and easy divorces and\r\nmarriage itself--what did they all amount to? Was love really what it\r\nwas cracked up to be, or had the novelists handed us guff? When I came\r\nout with questions like these, the chaps called "clean" looked rather\r\npained; the ones who weren\'t, distinctly bored.\r\n\r\nFor this whole intricate subject was kept in the cellars of our minds,\r\ncellars often large but dark. Because "sex" was wholly rotten. It had\r\nnothing to do, apparently, with the girls who came chaperoned to the\r\n"proms," it had to do only with certain women in a little town close by.\r\nPlenty of chaps went there at times, and now and then women from over\r\nthere would come to us on the quiet at night. But one afternoon I saw a\r\nbig crowd on the front campus. It grew every moment, became a mob,\r\nshoving and surging, shouting and jeering. I climbed some steps to look\r\ninto the center, and saw two painted terrified girls, hysterical,\r\nsobbing, swearing and shrieking. So they were shoved, a hidden\r\nspectacle, to the station and put on the train. Nothing like that on our\r\nfront campus! Nothing like "sex" in the front rooms of our minds. The\r\ncrowd returned chuckling. Immoral? Hell, no. Simply bad form.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"What am I going to write about?"\r\n\r\n"Games," said the college. "Only games. Don\'t go adventuring down into\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I found Joe Kramer.\r\n\r\nHe had "queered" himself at the beginning in college. I had barely known\r\nhim. He belonged to no fraternity, and except on the athletic field he\r\nkept out of all our genial life. And this life of ours, for all its\r\nthoughtlessness, was so rich in genuine friendships, so filled and\r\nbubbling over with the joy of being young, that we could not understand\r\nhow any decent sort of chap could deliberately keep out of it. We put\r\nJoe Kramer down as a "grouch."\r\n\r\nBut now that I too was "queering" myself, our queerness drew us\r\ntogether, or rather, Joe\'s drew mine. In the ten years that have gone\r\nsince then I have never met any man who drew me harder than he did, than\r\nhe is drawing me even still--and this often in spite of my efforts to\r\nshake him off, and later of his quite evident wish to be rid of me. For\r\nJoe had what is so hard to find among us comfortable mortals, a\r\nsincerity so real and deep that it absolutely ruled his life, that it\r\nkept him exploring into things, kept him adventuring always.\r\n\r\nIn long tramps over the neighboring hills, on our backs in the grass\r\nstaring up at the clouds, or in winter hugging a bonfire in the shelter\r\nof a boulder, or back in college over our beer or over countless pipes\r\nin our rooms, together we adventured through books and long hungry talks\r\ndown into life--and of the paths we discovered I see even now no end.\r\n\r\nJoe was tall and lean, with heavy shoulders stooping slightly. He was\r\nsallow, he never took care of himself. He ate his meals at all hours at\r\na small cheap restaurant, where he bought a bunch of meal tickets each\r\nweek. His face was obstinate, honest, kindly, his features were as blunt\r\nas his talk. He was the first to understand what I was so vaguely\r\nlooking for, and to say, "All right, Kid, you come right along." And as\r\nhe was farther along than I, he pulled me after him on the hunt after\r\nwhat he called "the genuine article" in this bewildering modern life.\r\n\r\nHis own life, to begin with, was a tie with this real modern world that\r\nhad forced itself on me long ago through the harbor. For Joe had been\r\n"up against it" hard. Though blunt and frank about most things he talked\r\nlittle about himself, but I got his story bit by bit. "Graft" had come\r\ninto it at the start. In a town of the Middle West his father had been a\r\nphysician with a good practice, until when Joe was eleven years old a\r\ncase of smallpox was discovered. Joe\'s father vaccinated about a score\r\nof children that week. The "dope" he used was mailed to him by a drug\r\nfirm in Chicago. It was "rotten." Over half the children were\r\ndesperately ill and seven of them died. Joe\'s father, his mother and\r\nboth older sisters did duty as nurses day and night. After that they\r\nleft town, moved from town to town, that story always following, and\r\nfinally both parents died. Since then Joe had been a teamster, a clerk\r\nin a hardware store, a brakeman, a telegrapher, and last, the assistant\r\neditor of a paper in a small town. He had scraped and slaved and studied\r\nthroughout with the idea of coming East to college. He had come at\r\ntwenty-two, beating his way on freight trains. On the top of a car one\r\nnight he had fallen asleep and been knocked on the head by a steel beam\r\njutting down under a bridge. Then, after two weeks on a hospital bed, he\r\nhad arrived at college.\r\n\r\nHere he had earned a meager way by writing football and baseball news\r\nfor a string of western papers. Here he had looked for an education, and\r\nhere "a bunch of dead ones" had handed him "news from the graveyard"\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nI can still see him in classroom, head cocked to one side, grimly\r\nwatching the prof. And once during a Bible course lecture I heard his\r\nvoice blandly ironic behind me:\r\n\r\n"Will somebody ask Mister Charley Darwin to be so good as to step this\r\nway?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been cheated, Bill," he told me. "We\'ve been cheated right along.\r\nTake history, for instance, the kind of stuff we were handed in school.\r\nI got onto it first when I was fourteen. It was a rainy Saturday and my\r\nmother told me to go and clean out an old closet up in the attic. Well,\r\nI found my German grandfather\'s diary there, written when he was in\r\ncollege in Leipsic, in 1848. The way those kids jumped into things! The\r\nway they got themselves mixed up in the Revolution of Forty Eight! To\r\nhear my young grandfather talk, that year was one of the biggest times\r\nin European history. Our school history gave it five pages and then\r\ndruled on about courts and kings. \'I\'ll go to college,\' I made up my\r\nmind. \'College will put me next to the truth.\' So I saved my little\r\nnickels and came. But college," he added moodily, "ain\'t advanced as far\r\nas it was in my young grandfather\'s time."\r\n\r\n"Do you know who\'s to blame for this stuff?" he said. "It\'s not the\r\nprofs, I\'ve nothing against them, all they need is to be kicked out. No,\r\nit\'s us, because we stand for their line of drule. If we got right up on\r\nour honkeys and howled, all of us, for a real education, we\'d get it by\r\nnext Saturday night. But we don\'t care a damn. Why don\'t we? Are we all\r\nof us dubs? No we\'re not. Go down to the football field and see. There\'s\r\nas much brains in figuring out those plays as there is in mathematics.\r\nWould we stand for coaches like our profs? But that\'s just it. It\'s the\r\nthing to be alive in athletics and a dub in everything else. And because\r\nit\'s the thing, every fellow fits in. On the whole," he added\r\nreflectively, "I think it\'s this \'dear old college\' feeling that\'s to\r\nblame for it all."\r\n\r\n"My God, Joe!" This was high treason!\r\n\r\n"Sure it is," he retorted. "It _is_ your god and the god of us all. This\r\ndear old college feeling. It\'s got us all stuck together so close that\r\nnobody dares to be himself and buck against its standards."\r\n\r\nThis from Joe Kramer! How often, in a football game, have I seen him on\r\nthe reporter\'s bench, his sallow face now all a-scowl, now beaming\r\nsatisfaction as he pounded his neighbor on the back.\r\n\r\nIn pursuit of "a real education" we got into the habit of spending\r\nalmost every evening in the college library, where except at examination\r\ntimes there was nobody but a few silent "polers."\r\n\r\nI grew to love this place. It was so huge and shadowy, with only shaded\r\nlights here and there. It had such tempting crannies. I loved its deep\r\nquiet, so pleasantly broken now and then by a step, a whisper, the sound\r\nof a book being moved from its shelf where perhaps it had stood unread\r\nfor years, or occasional voices passing outside or snatches of song from\r\nthe campus. And here I thought I was finding myself. That French prof\r\nhad introduced me to Voltaire, Hugo, Balzac, Maupassant and others who\r\nwere becoming my new idols. This was art, this was beauty and truth,\r\nthis was getting at life in a way that thrilled.\r\n\r\nBut now and then looking up from my book I would see Joe prowling about\r\nthe place, taking down a book, then shoving it back and scowling as he\r\nran his eyes along whole rows of titles.\r\n\r\n"This darned library shut its doors," he would growl to himself, "just\r\nas the real dope was coming along. But there\'s been such a flood of it\r\never since that some leaked in in spite of \'em."\r\n\r\nJoe would search and search until he found "it" on back shelves or stuck\r\naway in corners. Angrily he would blow off the dust and then settle\r\nhimself with a sigh to read. There was always something wistful to me in\r\nthe way Joe opened each new book. But what a joy when he found\r\n"it"--Darwin, Nietzsche, Henry George, Walt Whitman, Zola, Samuel\r\nButler. What a sudden sort of glee the night he discovered Bernard Shaw!\r\n\r\nWhen the library closed we adjourned for beer and a smoke, and often we\r\nwould argue long about what we had been reading. Joe had little use for\r\nthe stuff I liked. Beauty and form were nothing to him, it was "the\r\nmeat" he was after. My mother\'s idols he laid low.\r\n\r\n"The first part was big," he said one night of a recent English novel.\r\n"But the last part was the kind of thing that poor old Thackeray might\r\nhave done."\r\n\r\nIn an instant I was up in arms, for to my mother and me the author of\r\n"Pendennis" had been like a great lovable patron saint, a refuge from\r\nall we abhorred in the harbor. To slight him was a sacrilege. But\r\nreverence to Joe Kramer was a thing unknown. "Show me," he said, in\r\nreply to my outburst, "a single thing he ever wrote that wasn\'t\r\nsentimental bosh!" And we went at it hammer and tongs.\r\n\r\nIt was so in all our talks. Nothing was too sacred. Joe always insisted\r\non "being shown."\r\n\r\nHe had a keen liking but little respect for the nation built by our\r\nfathers. From his own father\'s tragedy, caused by graft, his own hard\r\nstruggles in the West and the Populist doctrines he had imbibed, he had\r\ncome East with a deep conviction that "things in this country are one\r\nbig mess with the Constitution sitting on top." And when the term\r\n"muckraker" came into use, I remember his deep satisfaction. "Now I know\r\nmy name," he said.\r\n\r\nHe was equally hard on the church. How he kicked against our compulsory\r\nchapel. "Broad, isn\'t it, scientific," he growled, "to yank a man out of\r\nbed every morning, throw him into his seat in chapel and tell him,\r\n\'Here. This is what you believe. Be good now, take your little dose and\r\nthen you can go to breakfast.\'"\r\n\r\n"I\'m no atheist," he remarked. "I\'m only a poor young fellah who asks,\r\n\'Say, Mister, if you _are_ up there why is it that no big scientist has\r\nbrains enough to see you?\'"\r\n\r\n"Look here, J. K., that isn\'t so!"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it? Show me!" And we would start in. I had a deep repugnance for\r\nhis whole materialistic view. But I liked the way he jarred me.\r\n\r\n"What I want to do," he said, "is to bust every hold that any creed ever\r\nhad on me. I don\'t mean only creeds in churches, I mean creeds in\r\npolitics, business and everywhere else. I want to get \'em all out of my\r\neyes so I can see what\'s really here--because I\'m so sure there\'s an\r\nawful lot here and an awful lot more that\'s coming. If I make a noise\r\nlike a knocker at times you don\'t want to put me down as any\r\nSchopenhauer fan. None of that pessimistic dope for little Joey Kramer.\r\nI never open a new book without hoping I\'ll find the real stuff I want,\r\nand I never open a paper without hoping that some more of it will be\r\nright here in the news of the day. Kid," he ended intensely, "you can\r\ntake it from me there are going to be big doings soon in this little old\r\nworld, big doings and great big ideas, as big as what caused the Civil\r\nWar and a damn sight more scientific. And the thing for you and me to do\r\nis to get ourselves in some kind of shape so we can shake hands with \'em\r\nwhen they arrive, and say, \'Hello, fellahs, come right in. You\'re just\r\nwhat we\'ve been waiting for.\'"\r\n\r\nWhen Joe gave up college at the end of the junior year, he left a small\r\ngroup of us behind. "The Ishmaelites," we called ourselves. For though\r\nmost of us "couldn\'t quite go Joe," we had all "queered" ourselves in\r\ncollege through the influence on us he had had.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of Joe Kramers now in colleges scattered all over\r\nthe land. Each year their numbers grow, each year more deep their vague\r\nconviction that somehow they\'ve been cheated, more harsh and insistent\r\nevery year their questioning of all "news from the graveyard," whether\r\nit comes from old fogey professors or from parents or preachers, eminent\r\nlawyers or business men, great politicians or writers of books. Arrogant\r\nand sweeping, sparing nothing sacred--young. Ignorant, confused and\r\ngroping, almost wistful--new. They are becoming no insignificant part in\r\nthis swiftly changing national life.\r\n\r\nJoe Kramer was one of the pioneers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with an unpleasant shock of surprise that I found Joe liked the\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\nWhen I took him home for Christmas he spent half his time down there on\r\nthe docks. He explored the whole region for miles around, in a week he\r\nspoke in familiar terms of slips and bays and rivers that to me were\r\nstill nothing but names. Moreover, he liked my father. And my father,\r\nopening up by degrees, showed an unmistakable relish for Joe.\r\n\r\nThey had long talks in the study at night, where I could hear them\r\narguing about the decline of our shipping, the growth of our trusts and\r\nrailroads, graft and high finance and strikes, the swift piling up of\r\nour troubles at home--and about the great chance we were losing abroad,\r\nthe blind weak part we were playing in this eager ocean world where\r\nevery nation that was alive was rushing in to get a place. As their\r\nvoices rose loud and excited, even my young sister Sue, who was just out\r\nof high school now and doing some groping about of her own, would go\r\ninto the study to listen at times. But I kept out. For already I was\r\ntired again of all these harbor problems, I wanted to get at life\r\nthrough Art! And I felt besides that if I entered into long talks with\r\nmy father, sooner or later he would be sure to bring up the dreaded\r\nquestion of my going into his business. And this I was firmly resolved\r\nnot to do. For my dislike of all his work, his deepening worries, his\r\ndogged absorption in his tiresome hobby of ships, was even sharper than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"That dad of yours," Joe told me, "is a mighty interesting old boy. He\r\nhas had a big life with a big idea."\r\n\r\n"Has he?" said I. "Then he\'s lost it."\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t! That\'s just the trouble. He thinks he\'s a comer when he\'s a\r\ngoer--he can\'t see his idea is out of date. It\'s a pity," he added\r\nsadly. "When a man can spend his days and nights hating the trusts and\r\nthe railroads as he does, it\'s a pity he\'s so darned old in his views of\r\nwhat ought to be done about it. Your father believes that if only we\'d\r\nget a strong navy and a large mercantile marine----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, cut it, J. K.," I said pettishly. "I tell you I don\'t care what he\r\nbelieves! The next thing you\'ll be telling me is that I ought to take a\r\njob in his warehouse!"\r\n\r\n"You might do worse," said Joe.\r\n\r\n"What?" I demanded indignantly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I said. If you\'d go on a paper and learn to write like\r\na regular man I\'d be tickled to death. But if all you want to be in life\r\nis a young Guy de Maupassant and turn out little gems for the girls,\r\nthen I say you\'d be a lot better off if you went into your father\'s\r\nwarehouse and began telling Wall Street to get off the roof!"\r\n\r\n"Thank you," I said stiffly.\r\n\r\nFrom that talk Joe and I began drifting apart. I never brought him home\r\nagain, I saw less of him at college. And at the end of the college year\r\nhe went to New York, where he found a job on a paper.\r\n\r\nAnd so all through my senior year I was left undisturbed to "queer"\r\nmyself in my own sweet way, which was to slave for hours over Guy de\r\nMaupassant and other foreign authors, write stories and sketches by the\r\nscore, and with two other "Ishmaelites" plan for a year\'s work in Paris.\r\nThe French prof was delighted and spurred us on with glowing accounts of\r\nlife in "the Quarter." One of us wanted to be a painter. No place for\r\nthat like Paris! Another an architect--Paris! Myself a writer--Paris!\r\nFor what could American writers to-day, with their sentimental little\r\nyarns covering with a laugh or a tear all the big deep facts of life,\r\nshow to compare to the unflinching powerful work of the best writers\r\nover in France? In Paris they were training men to write of life as it\r\nreally is! How that prof did drum it in. Better still, how he talked it\r\nup to my mother--the last time she came to college.\r\n\r\nI soon found she was on my side. If only she could bring father around.\r\n\r\nI still remember vividly that exciting night in June when the three of\r\nus, back there at home, sat on the terrace and fought it out. I remember\r\nthe beauty of the night, I mean of the night up there in the garden\r\nunder the stars, my mother\'s garden and her stars, and of the hideous\r\nshowing put up by my father\'s harbor below.\r\n\r\nOf course he opposed my going abroad. His old indifference to me had\r\nvanished, I saw he regarded me now as worth while, grown up, a business\r\nasset worth fighting for. And my father fought. He spoke abruptly,\r\npassionately of the great chance on the docks down there. I remember\r\nbeing surprised at his talk, at the bigness and the intensity of this\r\nhunger of his for ships. But of what he said I remembered nothing, I did\r\nnot hear, for I was eyeing my mother.\r\n\r\nI saw she was watching him pityingly. Why? What argument had she still\r\nto use? I waited in increasing suspense.\r\n\r\n"So that\'s all there is to it," I heard him end. "You might as well get\r\nit right out of your head. You\'re not going over to Europe to fool away\r\nany more of your time. You\'re going to buckle down right here."\r\n\r\n"Billy, leave us alone," said my mother.\r\n\r\nWhat in the name of all the miracles did she do to him that night--my\r\nmother so frail (she had grown so of late), my father so strong? The\r\nnext day she told me he had consented.\r\n\r\nI saw little of him in the next two weeks. He left me alone with her\r\nevery evening. But when I watched him he looked changed--beaten and\r\nbroken, older. In spite of myself I pitied him now, and a confused\r\nuneasiness, almost remorse, came over me at the way I had opposed him.\r\n"What\'s come over Dad?" I wondered. Once I saw him look at my mother,\r\nand his look was frightened, crushed. What was it she had told him?\r\n\r\nThose evenings I read "Pendennis" aloud for the third time to my mother.\r\nIt had been our favorite book, and I took anxious pains to show her how\r\nI loved it still. But once chancing to look quickly up, I caught my\r\nmother watching me with a hungriness and an utter despair such as I\'d\r\nnever seen before. It struck me cold, I looked away--and suddenly I\r\nrealized what a selfish little beast I was, beside this woman who loved\r\nme so and whom I was now leaving. My throat contracted sharply. But when\r\nI looked back the look was gone, and in its place was a quiet smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my boy, you must do fine work," she said. "I want it so much more\r\nthan anything else in my whole life. In my whole life," she repeated. I\r\ncame over to her chair, bent over her and kissed her hard.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry I\'m going! I\'m sorry!" I whispered. "But mammy! It\'s only for\r\na year!"\r\n\r\nWhy did that make her cling to me so? If only she had told me.\r\n\r\nBut what young egotists we sons are. It was only a few days later that\r\nwith my two college chums, from the deck of an ocean liner, I said\r\ngood-by to the harbor.\r\n\r\n"Thank God I\'m through with you at last."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nI was in Paris for two years.\r\n\r\nIn those first weeks of deep delight I called it, "The Beautiful City of\r\nGrays." For this town was certainly mellowed down. No jar of an ugly\r\npresent here, no loud disturbing harbor. But on the other hand, no\r\ndullness of a fossilized past. What college had been supposed to do this\r\ncity did, it took the past and made it alive, richly, thrillingly alive,\r\nand wove it in with the present. In the first Sorbonne lectures, even\r\nwith my meager French, I felt this at once, I wanted to feel it. These\r\nprofs were brilliant, sparkling, gay. They talked as though Rousseau and\r\nVoltaire, Hugo, Balzac and Flaubert, Maupassant and all the rest were\r\nstill vital dazzling news to the world, because these men were still\r\nmolding the world. And from here exploring out over the town, I was\r\nsmilingly greeted everywhere by such affable gracious old places, that\r\nseemed to say:\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been written about for a thousand years, and now you also wish to\r\nwrite. How charming of you. Please sit down. Garcon, un bock."\r\n\r\nAnd I sat down. Scenes from the books of my great idols rose around\r\nevery corner, or if they didn\'t I made them rise. There was pride in the\r\nprocess. To go to the Place de la Republique, take a seat before some\r\ncheap, jolly cafe, squint out at the Place with an artist\'s eye,\r\nreconstruct the Bastille, the Great Revolution, dream back of that to\r\nRousseau and Voltaire and the way they shook the world by their\r\nwritings--and then wake up and find that I had been at it for three\r\nmortal hours! What a chap I was for dreams. I must be quite a genius.\r\nThere were hours with Hugo in Notre Dame in one of its most shadowy\r\ncorners; with Zola on top of a \'bus at night as it lumbered up into the\r\nBelleville slums; with Balzac in an old garden I found; with Guy de\r\nMaupassant everywhere, in the gay hum and lights of those endless cafes,\r\nfrom bridges at sunset over the Seine, or far up the long rich dusk of\r\nthe Champs Elysees, lights twinkling out, and _his_ women laughing,\r\nchattering by.\r\n\r\nNothing left in this rich old world but the harbor? Nothing beautiful,\r\nfine or great for an eager, hungry, happy young man? I could laugh! I\r\nknew now that the harbor had lied! For into this radiant city not only\r\nthe past but the whole present of the earth appeared to me to be pouring\r\nin. Painters, sculptors, writers and builders were here from all\r\nnations, with even some Hindus and Japs thrown in, young, bringing all\r\ntheir dreams and ambitions, their gaiety, their vigor and zest.\r\n\r\n"Young men are lucky. They will see great things."\r\n\r\nVoltaire had said that about thirty years before the French Revolution.\r\nIt had been true then, true ever since, it was true to-day and\r\nhere--though _our_ great things I felt very sure were not to come in\r\nviolence--the world had gone beyond all that. No, these immense\r\nsurprises that were lurking just before us, these astounding miracles\r\nthat were to rise before our eyes, would come in the unfolding of the\r\npowers in men\'s minds, working free and ranging wide, with a deep\r\nresistless onward rush--in the stirring times of peace!\r\n\r\nAnd we were not only to see great things but we were all to do them!\r\nThat was the very keynote of the place. Here a fellow could certainly\r\nwrite if only he had it in him. Impatiently I slaved at my French. Five\r\nhours sleep was plenty.\r\n\r\nIn the small apartment we had taken just on the edge of the Luxembourg\r\nGardens, on the nights when we were working at home, one of us at his\r\neasel, another at his drafting board, myself at my desk, we would knock\r\noff at about eleven o\'clock and come down for beer and a long smoke in\r\nfront of the cafe below. A homely little place it was, with two rows of\r\nsmall iron tables in front, and at one of these we would seat ourselves.\r\nBehind us in the window was a long glass tank of gold fish, into which\r\nfrom time to time a huge cat would reach an omnivorous paw. Often from\r\nwithin the cafe we would hear Russian folk songs played on balalaikas by\r\na group of Russian students there. And between the songs a low hubbub\r\nrose, in French and many other tongues, for here were French and\r\nGermans, English and Bohemians, Russians and Italians, all gathered here\r\nwhile they were young.\r\n\r\nHow serene the old city seemed those nights. The street outside was\r\nquiet. The motor \'bus, that pest of Paris, had not yet appeared. Only an\r\noccasional cab would come tinkling on its way. Our street was absurdly\r\nshort. At one end was a gay cluster of lights from the crowded cafes of\r\nthe "Boul\' Mich\'," at the other were the low lighted arches at the back\r\nof the Odeon, from which when the play was over fluffy feminine figures\r\nwould emerge from the stage entrance; we would hear their low musical\r\nvoices as they came merrily by us in cabs. Other figures would pass.\r\nAcross the street before us rose the trees and the lofty iron fence of\r\nthe Gardens, with a rich gloom of shrubs behind, and against this\r\nbackground figures in groups and alone and in couples would come\r\nstrolling by with their happiness or hurrying eagerly toward it. Or to\r\nwhat else were they hurrying? From what were they coming so slowly away?\r\n\r\nThese strangers in this setting thrilled me. Comedy, tragedy, character,\r\nplot--there seemed nothing in life but the writing of tales--watching,\r\nlistening, dreaming, finding, then becoming deeply excited, feeling them\r\ngrow inside of you, planning them out and writing them off, then working\r\nthem over and over and over, little by little building them up. What a\r\nrich absorbing life for a fellow, and for me it still lay all ahead. I\r\nhad used but twenty-two years of my life, there were fifty left to write\r\nin, and what couldn\'t you write in fifty years!\r\n\r\nOften, sitting here at night, I would get an idea and begin to work, and\r\nI would keep on until at last the enormous old woman who kept the\r\ncafe--we called her "The Blessed Damozel"--would come lumbering out and\r\ngood humoredly growl,\r\n\r\n"Couches-toi donc. Une heure vient de sonner."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere came a brief interruption. Into our street\'s procession one\r\nevening, over its round cobblestones on a bicycle that wearily wobbled,\r\nthere came a lean dusty figure with something distinctly familiar in the\r\nstoop of the big shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Hello, boys," said a deep gruff voice.\r\n\r\n"J. K.!"\r\n\r\nIt was. Joe Kramer arriving in Paris at midnight on a punctured tire,\r\nand cursing the cobblestone pavements over which he had hunted us out.\r\n\r\nA hot supper, a bottle of wine, a genial beam on all three of us, and\r\nJoe told his story. After leaving college, from New York he had gone to\r\nKansas City, and by the "livest paper" there he had been sent abroad\r\nwith a bike to do a series of "Sunday specials." He had come over\r\nsteerage and written an expose of his passage. He had two weeks for\r\nParis and then was off to Berlin and Vienna.\r\n\r\n"I\'m just breaking ground this time, boys," he said. "I want to get the\r\nhang of the countries and a start in their infernal languages."\r\n\r\nThe next day he began to break ground in our city. Early the next\r\nmorning I found Joe propped up in bed scowling into _Le Matin_ as he\r\ntried to butt his way through the language into the news events of the\r\nday. What I tried to tell him of the Paris I had found made no appeal\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n"All right, Kid," he said indulgently. "If I had a dozen lifetimes I\r\nmight be a poet. But I haven\'t, so I\'ll just be a reporter."\r\n\r\nAnd he and his bike plunged into the town. He found its "newspaper row"\r\nthat day and a Frenchman to whom he had a letter. With this man Joe went\r\nto the Bourse and that night to the Chamber of Deputies. He got "Sunday\r\nspecials" out of them both, and then went on to the Bourse de Travail.\r\nAnd in the few spare moments he had, Joe told us of the things he had\r\nseen. Rumors of war and high finance, trade unions, strikes and sabotage\r\nburst on my startled artist\'s ears. It made me think of the harbor!\r\n_This_ was not my Paris!\r\n\r\n"It is," said J. K. stoutly. "There\'s no place like a newspaper office\r\nto put you right next to the heart of a town."\r\n\r\nHe would not hear to our seeing him off. I remember him that last night\r\nafter supper strapping his bag onto his bike and starting off down our\r\nquiet old street on his way to the station.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow," he said, "I\'ll stop off in Leipsic. I want to have a look\r\nat the college that stirred my young grandfather up for life. I\'ve got\r\nhis diary with me."\r\n\r\nAgain, in spite of the gruffness, I felt that wistful quality in him.\r\nJ. K. was hunting for something too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what a relief to see him go, to forget his loud disturbing Paris and\r\nagain drink deep of mine, the city of great writers.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll never really know them," I thought, "until I can not only talk but\r\nthink and feel in their language."\r\n\r\nSo I drudged for hours a day in my room. I inflicted my French on my\r\nchums at meals, on defenseless drivers of \'buses who could not rise and\r\ngo away, and on the Blessed Damozel, who said:\r\n\r\n"Va donc, cherches-toi une fille. C\'est la seule maniere d\'apprendre le\r\nFrancais."\r\n\r\nI was vaguely thrilled by this idea, the more because so far in my life\r\nI had had no experience of the kind. On the streets, in cabs, and in\r\ncafes I began watching women with different eyes, more eagerly selecting\r\neyes that picked out of the throng the one _her_ of the moment so that\r\nfor me she was quite alone. She was alone for a thousand reasons,\r\ndifferent ones in every case. She was of many ages, rich and poor, now\r\ngorgeous and now simply dressed, now a ravishing creature that took your\r\nbreath and again just funny and very French with a saucy way of wearing\r\nher clothes. Her fascinations were always new. I watched her twinkling\r\nearrings, her trick of using her lips when she smiled, her hands, her\r\nsilk clad ankles, her swelling young bust, the small coquettish hat she\r\nwore, her shoulders, their expressive shrugs, her quick vivacious\r\nmovements--and I watched her eyes. Her eyes would meet mine now and\r\nthen, often with only a challenging smile but again in an intimate\r\ndazzling way that gave me a deep swift shock of delight and left me\r\nconfused and excited.\r\n\r\n"In a little while," I thought. I decided to wait till I knew more\r\nFrench. "She\'ll be strange enough, God knows," I thought half\r\napprehensively, "even when I can talk her language." And with a feeling\r\nalmost of relief I would plunge back into my work and forget her. For me\r\nshe was only an incident in this teeming radiant life.\r\n\r\nI must learn French! I strained my ears at lectures, at plays from the\r\ntop gallery, I hired a tutor to hurry it on. Years later in New York I\r\nmet a Russian revolutionist come to raise money for his cause. "Three\r\nweeks have I been in this country," he said in utter exasperation. "And\r\nnot yet do I speak fluently the English!" That was how I felt about\r\nFrench. What a delight to begin to feel easy, to catch the fine\r\nshadings, the music and color of words and of phrases. How much more\r\npliant and smooth and brilliant than English. How remote from the\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\nI could study my models now, not only their construction but their small\r\ncharacter touches as well. De Maupassant was still first for me. So\r\nsimple and sure, with so few strokes but each stroke counting to the\r\nfull, one suggestive sentence making you imagine the rest, everything\r\nelse in the world shut out, your mind gripped suddenly and held,\r\nfocussed on this man and this woman who a moment before had been nothing\r\nto you but were now more real than life itself. Especially this woman,\r\nwhat an absorbing creature he made her--and the big human ideas he\r\ninjected into these petites histoires.\r\n\r\nI wrote short stories by the score. Each one had a perfectly huge idea\r\nbut each seemed worse than the one before. I took to myself the advice\r\nof Flaubert, and from a table before a cafe I would watch the people\r\naround me and jot down the minutest details, I filled whole pages with\r\nmy strokes. But which to choose to make this person or this scene like\r\nno other in the world? There came the rub. How had De Maupassant done\r\nit? The answer came to me one night:\r\n\r\n"Not only by watching people. He talked to \'em, lived with \'em, knew\r\ntheir lives!"\r\n\r\nThe very thing my music teacher had said about Beethoven. How uneasy I\r\nhad been then, how absurdly young and priggish then in the gingerly way\r\nI had gone at the harbor. Thank heaven there was no harbor here. I could\r\nenter this life with a wholehearted zest.\r\n\r\nI began with one of my roommates. He was to be an architect. A\r\nhard-working little chap, his days were filled with sharp suspense. The\r\nBeaux Arts entrance examinations were close ahead. If he did not pass,\r\nhe told me, his parents in Ohio were too poor to give him another\r\nchance.\r\n\r\n"If I have to go back to Ohio now," he said in that soft reflective\r\nvoice of his, "I\'ll put up cowsheds--later on, barns--and maybe when I\'m\r\nfifty, a moving picture theater. If I stay here and go back a Beaux Arts\r\nman, I can go to New York or Chicago and get right into the center of\r\nthe big things being done."\r\n\r\nWith a wet towel bound around his head he used to sit at his work half\r\nthe night. I watched the lines tighten about his thin lips and between\r\nhis gray eyes, grew to know the long weariness in them over some\r\nproblem, the sudden grim joy when the problem worked out. One day he\r\ncame home early.\r\n\r\n"Queer," he said simply. "I can see one side of your face, one side of\r\nyour body, one leg and one arm. But the other side don\'t seem to be\r\nthere." I looked up at him a moment.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go out for a walk," I suggested. We went for a stroll in the\r\nGardens. And here I was surprised and just a bit ashamed to find that\r\nwhile I had a real sympathy for him I had just as real curiosity. For\r\nhere was a living illustration of the horror of going blind. I could see\r\nhis jaws set like a vise, I could hear his low voice talking steadily on\r\nas though to keep from thinking. What was he thinking? What was he\r\nfeeling? We talked of the most commonplace things. But moment by moment,\r\nthrough his voice and his grip on my arm, those sudden waves now of\r\nsickening fear, now of keen suspense, now of angry groping around for a\r\nfoothold, seemed pouring from him right into me, became part of\r\nme--while the other part of me stood off and listened.\r\n\r\n"By God, this is life!" said one part of me. "No, it isn\'t; it\'s hell,"\r\ngrowled the other part. "This thing has got to be settled!"\r\n\r\nI took him to an oculist, and there I had another close view, this time\r\nof intense relief.\r\n\r\n"Blind? Why, no, you\'re not going blind," said the oculist kindly. "All\r\nyou need is"--I heard nothing more. I had never had any idea before of\r\nhow swift and deep relief could be. On the street outside I heard it not\r\nonly in his unsteady laugh but in my own as well. We celebrated long\r\nthat night, and very late he took me to his favorite place down on the\r\nlower quay of the river, where with the lights and the sounds of the\r\ncity far off it felt like some old dungeon. But just over our heads hung\r\nthe heavy black arch of a stone bridge, and looking up through this arch\r\nas a frame we could see close above a gray, luminous mass rising and\r\nrising in great sweeping lines till it filled half the sky--silent,\r\ntremendous, Notre Dame. From down here the old edifice seemed alive. And\r\nthough my friend talked little here, I felt him again coming into me.\r\nAnd this time it was his religion that came, his curious passion for\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nWhen at last we went home he could see my whole body, and I felt as\r\nthough I had seen his whole soul.\r\n\r\nThen I carefully wrote this down on paper. I put in every touch that I\r\ncould remember. I rewrote it to make it big, and I made it so big I\r\nspoiled it all. I tore this up and began again. For about two weeks I\r\nwrote nothing else. But at last I tore up everything. After all, he was\r\na friend of mine.\r\n\r\n"But where\'s the harm," I argued, "so long as I always tear it up? This\r\nis real stuff. I\'ll get somewhere this way if I keep on."\r\n\r\nAnd I did keep on. Shamelessly I wormed my way into friends by the\r\ndozen. I found it such an absorbing pursuit I could hardly wait to\r\nfinish up one before I went on to another. There were such a bewildering\r\nlot of them, now that I had pried open my eyes. Would-be painters,\r\nsculptors, poets, dramatists, novelists, rich and poor, tragic ones and\r\ncomic ones, with the meanest pettiest jealousies, the most bumptious\r\nself-conceits, the blindest worship of masters, the most profound\r\nhumility, ambition so savage it made men inhuman. Many were starving\r\nthemselves to death.\r\n\r\nThere was a little Hungarian Jew, an ardent follower of Matisse.\r\n\r\n"Technique?" he cried. "It is nothing! To grip your soul in your two\r\nhands and press it on your canvas--that is art, that is Matisse!"\r\n\r\nHe took me night after night through old buildings up in Montparnasse,\r\nimmense and dismal rookeries crowded with Poles, Bohemians and God knows\r\nwhat other races, all feverish post-impressionists. Often we would find\r\nthree together close around one candle, scowling and squinting at their\r\neasels, gaunt, silent, eager. Matisse--Matisse!\r\n\r\n"Most of them," said my guide, "are just mad. They cannot paint. All\r\nthink they are going to do great things, but all they are going to do is\r\nto die."\r\n\r\nIt was through this little Hungarian that I made my first study of\r\nfemale life.\r\n\r\nWhy delay any longer? I had been in Paris over six months, and I had\r\nqualms almost of guilt at the thought of this chastity of mine. At first\r\nI said, "Art is a jealous mistress." And this did splendidly for a time.\r\nBut then a stout German youth came along and laid it down as an absolute\r\nlaw that no writer could do a woman right until he had lived with a\r\ndozen. Hence that scented little cat with whom he had lived for the past\r\nyear. She was the first of the dozen, eh? Damn the fellow, how much was\r\nthere in it? De Maupassant certainly hadn\'t held off. In fact there were\r\nfew of my idols who had. Why not be brave and take the plunge? It need\r\nnot be such a terrific plunge; no doubt if I went at it right I could\r\nfind a safe, easy kind of a _her_, friendly and confiding, a thoroughly\r\ngood fellow with none of these wild ups and downs. The less temperament\r\nthe better; she must have a good quiet head on her shoulders; no doubt\r\nwe would need it. And she must not be too young. Let her have had\r\naffairs enough to know that ours was only one more and would probably be\r\nas brief as the rest--the briefer the better.\r\n\r\nSo tamely I pictured my first love. And the gay old city of Paris\r\nsmiled, and in that bantering way of hers she brought to me in a cafe\r\none night a perfect young tigress of a girl, a lithe, dusky beauty with\r\nsmouldering eyes, and said:\r\n\r\n"Without doubt this one is better for you. Regard what loveliness, what\r\nfire! Oh, my son, why not be brave?"\r\n\r\nI was not brave, I barely spoke, and my friend the little Hungarian Jew\r\nwho had brought her to my table was forced to do the talking. For she,\r\ntoo, was silent. But how different was her silence from the quiet I had\r\npictured. Presently, however, I became a little easier, and by degrees\r\nwe began to talk. She told me she was a painter. An Armenian by birth,\r\nshe had run away from home at eighteen, and here for two years in\r\nJulien\'s she had tried to paint till she felt she\'d go mad. She talked\r\nin abrupt, eager sentences, breaking off to watch people around us. How\r\nher big eyes fastened upon them. "To watch faces until you are sure--and\r\nthen paint! There is nothing else in the world!" she said. And I found\r\nthis reassuring.\r\n\r\nAfter that I saw her many nights. And from time to time breaking that\r\nsilence of hers, she became so fiercely confiding, not only about her\r\npainting, but about what she called her innermost soul, that soon I\r\ncould look my De Maupassant square in the face, man to man, for I was\r\nlearning a lot about women. As yet we were friends and nothing more, but\r\nI could feel both of us changing fast. "In a little while," I thought.\r\n\r\nBut alas. One night she took me up to her room and showed me her\r\npaintings. They were bad. They were fearfully bad, and my face must have\r\nshown the impression they made.\r\n\r\n"You consider them frightful!" she exclaimed. I stoutly denied it, but\r\nthings only went from bad to worse. Here was that temperament I had\r\ndreaded. Now she was clutching both my arms.\r\n\r\n"Mon dieu! Why not say it? Why cannot you say it?"\r\n\r\n"No," I replied. "You have done some extremely powerful work!" Anything\r\nto quiet her nerves. "Especially this one--look--over here!" And I\r\npointed to one of her pictures.\r\n\r\n"I will show you how I shall look at it!" she cried in a perfect frenzy\r\nof tears. She snatched up a knife that lay on her table, a very old,\r\ncurved, Armenian knife, and went at the painting and slashed it to\r\nshreds, and then scattered the shreds all over the room.\r\n\r\nAnd watching this little festival, I thought to myself excitedly,\r\n\r\n"I know enough about this girl!"\r\n\r\nMy retreat was so precipitate as to appear almost a flight.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said to myself, outside, "De Maupassant knew women. And he went\r\ninsane at forty-five."\r\n\r\nAnd so my next case was a chap from Detroit, whose aim, he told me, was\r\nno less than to make himself "by the sheer force of my will a perfect,\r\nall-round, modern man."\r\n\r\nIt was over his case that I lost what was left of my sense of honor. For\r\nI not only wrote him down, I kept what I had written. "Ten years from\r\nnow," I said in excuse, "I won\'t believe him unless he\'s on paper." But\r\nhaving kept this, I began keeping others, until my locked drawer was\r\nfilled with the dreams and ambitions and even the loves of my confiding,\r\ninnocent friends. At last I was a writer.\r\n\r\nWhat a relief when my mother wrote that my father had consented to a\r\nsecond year abroad for me. In my gratitude I even grew just a trifle\r\nhomesick.\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t I better come home for the summer?" I wrote her.\r\n\r\n"No," she replied, "we cannot afford it. I want you to keep right on\r\nwith your work. I feel so sure you are working hard and will do things I\r\nshall be proud of."\r\n\r\nI was not only working, but living, feeling, listening hard, under the\r\nstimulus day and night of the tense, rich life around me. About this\r\ntime I made a friend of a gaunt, bearded Russian chap, whose dream for\r\nyears had been, like mine, to become a writer of fiction. His god had\r\nbeen Turgenief. And a year ago, leaving his home, a little town near\r\nMoscow, with forty roubles in his purse he had set out on foot with a\r\npack on his back to tramp the long and winding road that stretched away\r\ntwo thousand miles to the distant city of Paris, the place where his\r\nidol had lived and studied and written for so many years. Through this\r\nyoung Russian pilgrim I came to know the books of some of his\r\ncountrymen, and through him I caught glimpses down into the vast,\r\nmysterious soul of that people in the North.\r\n\r\nThrough other chaps I met those days, other deep, tremendous vistas\r\nopened up as backgrounds for these Paris friends of mine. Half the\r\nnight, in that cafe endeared to so many youths of all nations under its\r\nname of "The Dirty Spoon," I heard talk about all things under the sun,\r\ntalk that was a merry war of words, ideas and points of view as wide\r\napart as that of a Jap and a German. For every land upon the earth had\r\nsent its army of ideas, and they all charged together here, and the\r\nwalls of the Dirty Spoon resounded with the battle--with roars of\r\nlaughter and applause. For we were of free, tolerant minds. We were gay,\r\nyoung dogs of war who had left our tails behind us--our tails of\r\nprejudice, distrust--and our emancipated souls had only scorn for\r\nhatreds born of race or creed. Like J. K., we had rid ourselves of all\r\ncreeds past and present--but J. K. had always been free with a scowl,\r\nhis feet set grimly on the ground--we here were free with a verve and a\r\ndash that took us careering up into the stars to laugh at the very\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nThere was breadth in our very manner of speech. For here were we from\r\nall over the earth, all speaking one tongue, the language in which half\r\nthe things that had moved the world had been said by men before us. And\r\nwhat sparkling things there were still to be said, what dazzling things\r\nwe would see and do, in this prodigious onward march of the armies of\r\npeace, out of all dark ages into a glad new world for men, where our\r\ngreat smiling goddess of all the arts would reign supreme, where we\r\nwould dream mighty visions of life and all these visions would come\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nSo we saw the world those days in the radiant city on the Seine.\r\n\r\nAnd meanwhile far up in the North, the Russian Czar, having started with\r\nloud ostentation the movement for a world-wide peace, was swiftly\r\ncompleting his preparations to strike with his armies at Japan. And the\r\nother nations of Europe, jealous and suspicious of each other\'s every\r\nsecret plan--they, too, were making ready for what the future years\r\nmight bring.\r\n\r\n"Young men are lucky. They will see great things."\r\n\r\nAnd these young men have seen great things. But they have not been\r\nlucky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about a year after this that again Joe Kramer broke in on my\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nHe arrived early on a raw, wet morning in the following winter. His\r\nall-night ride from Cherbourg had left him disheveled, unshaven and\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\n"Well, boys," he asked when our greetings were over, "what do you think\r\nof the news?"\r\n\r\n"What news?"\r\n\r\nJoe gave us a grim, fatherly smile.\r\n\r\n"Say. Do I have to come all the way from Chicago to tell you what\'s\r\nhappening down the street? Well, you young beauty boosters, there\'s a\r\npanic on the Bourse this week that\'s got your fair city flat on her\r\nback. And the cause of the said panic is that France is in deep on\r\nRussian bonds, which are now worth about a cent to the dollar. Because\r\nthe Russian people--already dead sick of the war with Japan--have risen\r\nin a howling mob against their government. See?"\r\n\r\n"I did hear of that," said the painter among us. "A Polish chap in the\r\nstudio said something about it yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Now, did he?" said the ironical Joe. "Just kind of murmured it, I\r\nsuppose, while bending reverently over his art." He rose. "Well, boys,\r\nI\'m sorry for you, but I\'ve only got a day in this town, I\'m off for\r\nRussia on the night train. Bill, I wish you\'d help me here. I\'ve got an\r\nawful lot to do and my French is still a little weak."\r\n\r\nIt was not at all weak, it was strong and loud. I can hear it still, Joe\r\nKramer\'s French, and it is a fitting memory of that devastating day.\r\n\r\nThe day began so splendidly, so big with promise of great ideas. I grew\r\nquite excited about it. Here was Joe on his way to a real revolution.\r\nSent out by his Chicago paper, he was going to Russia to see a whole\r\npeople fight to be free--a struggle prophesied long ago by Turgenief,\r\nTolstoy and other big Russians whose work I admired. And now it was\r\nactually coming off--and Joe, the lucky devil, was going to be right on\r\nhand! From some mysterious source in New York he had secured a letter to\r\na Russian revolutionist leader who for many years had been an exile here\r\nin Paris. Joe was anxious to see him at once.\r\n\r\n"All right," I said eagerly. "Give me his address."\r\n\r\n"Hold on," J. K. retorted. "It\'s not so easy as all that. I want to get\r\ninto Russia. This man\'s house in Paris is watched day and night by the\r\nRussian secret police, and nobody who\'s seen with him has a chance of\r\ncrossing the frontier. We\'ve got to go slow."\r\n\r\n"What\'ll we do?"\r\n\r\n"I want you to steer me first to a Frenchman. He\'s an anarchist. Here\'s\r\nhis address."\r\n\r\nThe anarchist was a bit disappointing. A mild little man, we found him\r\nin an attic room receiving a vigorous scolding from the huge blonde with\r\nwhom he lived. But after reading Joe\'s letter, he, too, took on a\r\nmysterious air. He came with us in our cab, and off we went over Paris\r\nuntil I thought we should never end. Again and again the cab would stop\r\nand our guide would darkly disappear. But from one of these trips he\r\nreturned triumphant.\r\n\r\n"I have found his wife," he announced. "But she says she must have a\r\nlook at you first." The cab rattled off, and the next stop was in front\r\nof a public library.\r\n\r\n"Now," said our guide, "go in and sit down at a table and pretend you\r\nare reading."\r\n\r\nWe went in and did as he said. Soon a middle-aged woman in black sat\r\ndown at the other side of the table. She stared at us gloomily a\r\nmoment; then with a yawn she opened a book and calmly started making\r\nnotes. Presently, scowling over her work, she began muttering to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n"You must not look up," I heard in French. "A Russian spy sits over\r\nthere. You wish to see my husband. Come to-night at nine o\'clock to the\r\nsecond floor of the Cafe Voltaire. He will be at the top of the stairs.\r\nGood-by." And she yawned again over her writing.\r\n\r\n"Now, this," I thought, "is a revolution!" I thoroughly approved of\r\nthis. The Cafe Voltaire was an excellent choice, an almost perfect\r\nmise-en-scene. It had long been one of my favorite haunts. A tall white\r\nwooden building, so toned down, so tumbled down, so heavy laden with\r\nmemories of poets, dramatists, pamphleteers and fiery young orators, who\r\nhad sat here and conspired and schemed and exhorted over human rights.\r\nIt had well lived up to its glorious name. What great ideas had started\r\nfrom here! Here French history had been made!\r\n\r\nBut alas! Into this hallowed spot that night, at nine o\'clock on his way\r\nto his train, came Joe in a yellow mackintosh with a brand-new suitcase\r\nin his hand--and showed me history in the making. It was made in a\r\nsmall, stuffy room upstairs. On the one side J. K. with a million\r\nAmerican readers behind him, on the other this revolutionist whose name\r\nthat week had been in newspapers all over the world. So far, so good.\r\nBut look at him, look at this history maker. Tall, sallow and dyspeptic,\r\na professor of economics. Romance, liberty, history, thrill? Not at all.\r\nThey talked of factories, wages, strikes, of railroads, peasants\' taxes,\r\nof plows and wheat and corn and hay! They got quite excited over hay.\r\n\r\nAnd all this had to come through their defenseless interpreter--me. My\r\nhead ached, one foot fell asleep. The Social Democratic Party, the\r\nSocial Revolutionist Party, the Constitutional Democrats, in and out of\r\nmy head they trooped. If this be revolution, then God save the king!\r\nCrushed to earth, as we left at last, my head still buzzing with\r\neconomics, I looked dismally back on my poor cafe, on liberty, justice\r\nand human rights. There was something as bad as the harbor in Joe; he\r\nwas always spoiling everything.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you take Carlyle\'s French Revolution along?" I suggested\r\nforlornly. "You might read it on the train."\r\n\r\n"Because, you poor kid, he\'s way out of date."\r\n\r\nIt took me days to get into my work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout two months later, back he came. From one of our front windows he\r\nlooked down into the old Gardens, into all the loveliness the April\r\ntwilight was bringing there, and,\r\n\r\n"Where can I get a typewriter?" he asked. "I\'ve got such an awful lot of\r\nstuff that I want to dictate it right off the bat."\r\n\r\nThis was _literature_ in the making. For hours in Joe\'s room that week I\r\nsat and heard him make it. In one corner lay a heap of dirty shirts and\r\ncollars, in another a stack of papers and books. An English stenographer\r\nsat at the window, J. K. strode up and down and talked. It was real\r\nenough, this narrative. Facts and figures, he had them down cold, to\r\nback up with a crushing force the points he was making against the Czar.\r\nPoverty, tyranny, bloody oppression, wholesale slaughter of a people in\r\na half-mad monarch\'s war--Joe pounded them in with sledgehammer blows.\r\nHe not only made you sure they were true, he made you sure that these\r\nthings must be stopped and that you as a decent American certainly\r\nwanted to help with your money. And as for the revolution itself, he\r\nleft no doubt in your mind about that. It was there all right, Joe had\r\nseen people give up their lives, he had seen men and women clubbed and\r\nshot down, he had been so near he had seen the blood. (But he made human\r\nblood so darned commonplace, curse him!) And in Petersburg for two long\r\nnights he had gone about a city in darkness, every street light put out\r\nby the strikers, the streets filled with surging black masses of\r\nfigures. Yes, Joe had certainly seen big things.\r\n\r\nThen what was the matter with me, I thought, that all this did not\r\nthrill me? "Young men are lucky. They will see great things." All right,\r\nhere was one of _my_ great things, a whole nation rising to throw off\r\nits chains, to show the world that wars must cease--and to me it didn\'t\r\nseem great at all, it seemed only big, and there was a world of\r\ndifference. Big? It was enormous, not only what Joe had seen up there,\r\nbut what he was doing right here in this room. He was talking to a\r\nmillion people, damn him, and doubtless this was just the kind of\r\nwriting that would appeal to them. Thousands of his commonplace readers\r\nwould send their dollars to Russia, where dyspeptic professors of\r\neconomics would use the money to hire halls, into which millions of\r\ncommonplace Russians would crowd to hear about strikes, wages, taxes and\r\nhay! And then some more commonplace blood would be shed, the dyspeptic\r\nprofessors would be put in office--and this was a modern revolution!\r\n\r\nWas everything modern only big? Must I always have that feeling the\r\nharbor used to give me?\r\n\r\n"No!" I decided angrily. The fault didn\'t lie in me nor in Russia, but\r\nin J. K. and the way he was writing. As I followed that blunt narrative\r\nof his journey through cities and factory towns, into deep forests,\r\nacross snowy plains and through little hamlets half buried in snow and\r\nfilled with the starving families of the men who had gone to the war, I\r\ntried to picture it all to myself--not as he described it, confound him,\r\nbut with all the beauty which must have been there. Ye Gods of the Road,\r\nwhat a journey! What tremendous canvases teeming with life, such\r\nstrange, dramatic significant life! What a chance for a writer!\r\n\r\nOne night on a train whose fifth-class cars, cattle cars and nothing\r\nmore, were packed with wounded men from the front, out of one of those\r\ntraveling hells Joe had pulled a peasant boy half drunk, and by the\r\ndisplay of a bottle of vodka had enticed him into his own compartment in\r\na second-class car ahead. The boy\'s right arm was a loathsome sight,\r\nfestering from a neglected wound. Amputation was plainly a matter of\r\ndays. But it was not to forget that grim event that the boy had jumped\r\noff at each little station to spend his few kopecks on vodka. No, he was\r\nstolidly getting drunk because, as he confided to Joe, at dawn he would\r\ncome to his home town and there he knew he was going to tell twenty-six\r\nwives that their men had been killed. He laboriously counted them off on\r\nhis fingers--each wife and each husband by their long, homely Russian\r\nnames. Then he burst into half-drunken sobs and pounded the window ledge\r\nwith his fist. It was the fist of his right arm, and the kid gave a\r\nqueer, sharp scream of pain.\r\n\r\nIf Voltaire had been there he would have come back and described that\r\npeasant boy he\'d seen in a way that would have gripped men\'s souls and\r\nsent a great shudder over the world at war and what it meant to\r\nmankind--while Joe was simply slapping it down like some hustling, keen\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Joe; you make me sick!" I exploded at last. "You ought to\r\nstick right here for months and work on this wonderful stuff you\'ve got\r\ntill there\'s nothing left you can possibly do!"\r\n\r\n"Be an artist, eh, a poet, a great writer." He gave me one of those\r\nfatherly smiles. "I\'ve got some things to say to _you_, Kid. I don\'t\r\nlike the life you\'re leading."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you? Why don\'t you?" I rejoined. And so began a fight that lasted\r\nas long as he was in Paris.\r\n\r\nNothing that I had been doing here made any appeal whatever to Joe. I\r\nshowed him my sketch of Notre Dame from under that old bridge at night.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "this is fine writing, awful fine. But it has about as\r\nmuch meaning to me as a woman\'s left ear. What\'s the use of sitting down\r\nunder a bridge and looking up at an ancient church and trying to feel\r\nlike a two-spot? For God\'s sake, Bill, get it out of your system, quit\r\ngetting reverent over the past. You\'re sitting here at the feet of the\r\nMasters, fellahs who were all right in their day, but are now every one\r\nof \'em out of date. And you\'re so infernally busy copying their\r\ntechnique and style and trying to learn just how to write, that you\'re\r\ngetting nothing to write about. Why can\'t you go to life for your\r\nstuff?"\r\n\r\n"Go to life?" I said indignantly. "I\'ve done nothing else for over a\r\nyear!"\r\n\r\n"Show me."\r\n\r\n"Here!"\r\n\r\nHe read more of my sketches.\r\n\r\n"But damn it, Bill, these people aren\'t alive. They\'re only a bunch of\r\nartist kids as reverent over the past as yourself, they have about as\r\nmuch connection with anything live and vital to-day as so many mediaeval\r\nmonks. You fellahs think you\'re free of creeds. You\'re the creediest\r\nkids I ever saw, your religion is style, technique and form. For God\'s\r\nsake lose it and use your own eyes, forget you\'re an artist and be a\r\nreporter, come out in the world and have a try. You\'ll find so much\r\nstuff you won\'t need any plots, you\'ll simply report events as they\r\nhappen. And you won\'t have any time for technique, the next event will\r\nbe tuning up before you\'ve got to the end of the last. With a big daily\r\npaper behind him a good reporter can follow the front page around the\r\nworld. Russia\'s on the front page now. All right, you can go to Russia.\r\nBy June it may be Hindustan, or Pittsburgh, Turkey or China. Believe me,\r\nBill, the nations of this planet are working themselves into a state\r\nwhere they\'re ready to do things you never dreamed of. I\'m not talking\r\nof kings and governments, I\'m talking of the people themselves, the\r\npeople in such excited crowds that nobody knows who\'s who or what\'s\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n"I saw my first crowd in Petersburg the very day I got off the train.\r\nThey filled a street from wall to wall and as far as you could see. They\r\nweren\'t saying a word or singing a song, and there wasn\'t even a drum to\r\nkeep time. But they moved along with their wives and kids as though\r\nthey\'d left home, job and church, and were looking for something else so\r\nhard they didn\'t care for bullets. I saw \'em shot down like so many\r\nsheep. But bullets won\'t stop what I saw in their eyes. God knows I\r\ndon\'t want a religion. I\'m no socialist nor anarchist. But if there\'s\r\none thing I want to hang on to it\'s my belief in the common crowd.\r\nThey\'ve had a raw deal since the world began. They can have the whole\r\nearth whenever they want it. And they\'re beginning to want it hard!\r\n\r\n"Forget your own name and jump into the crowd, write and don\'t stop to\r\nremember you\'re writing! The place _you_ need is the U. S. A.--and the\r\nwork you need is a job on a paper!"\r\n\r\n"Are you through?" I snapped.\r\n\r\n"I am!"\r\n\r\n"All right," said I. "I\'m going to stay just where I am! I\'m not going\r\nto be yanked by you all over the earth, to write news articles on the\r\nrun! I\'m going to stick in one place--right here--and take my time and\r\nlearn my job. I don\'t want to write news, I want to write books. I\'d\r\nrather write one good novel than all the headline stuff in the world.\r\nIt\'s books that make the headlines."\r\n\r\n"_Books?_" Joe\'s look was funny.\r\n\r\n"Sure they do. Take Russia. What started this whole revolution! Books.\r\nIt didn\'t start with your common crowds--they were all eating fried\r\nonions. It started with a few writers of novels!"\r\n\r\n"Who left their little mahogany desks," said Joe, "got into peasant\r\nclothes and went to live with the peasants!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no they didn\'t. Only a few. Turgenief didn\'t. Tchernichefsky didn\'t.\r\nDostoiefsky----"\r\n\r\n"Say. Are they Russians? I never heard their names up there."\r\n\r\nI looked at J. K. thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"No," I said. "You wouldn\'t. As yet they\'re not quite crowdy enough. But\r\nthey are Russians and their ideas made most of the first revolutionists.\r\nThe whole revolution was started by books."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t," snapped Joe. "It was taxes. Their taxes were doubled\r\nbecause of the war, and----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, damn your war taxes, and damn your plows and your corn and hay!\r\nYou\'ve got a hay mind, that\'s the trouble with you! You\'ve got so you\r\nthink that hay and bread and pork and beans are all men live and die\r\nfor! They don\'t, Mister Reporter, they die for ideals--freedom,\r\ndemocracy, human rights--which are in \'em so deep that when a big writer\r\nsees \'em there and brings \'em out and holds \'em up and says, \'Here! This\r\nis you, this is what you want, this is what you believe in!\'--your crowd\r\nsays, \'Sure! Why didn\'t we see it long ago?\' And then they do things that\r\ngo into headlines! But to be able to write like that a man can\'t go\r\nchasing all over the earth, he\'s got to quit sneering at art and\r\ntechnique, he\'s got to learn how to make characters real and build plots\r\nthat make readers sit up all night to see what becomes of the people\r\nhe\'s made! If believing that is a creed, then I\'m creedy! I\'m willing to\r\nthrow over everything else, but I\'ll hang on to this one thing all my\r\nlife--the fact that big art means working like hell!"\r\n\r\n"Gee," said J. K. "What an artist."\r\n\r\nThese fights of ours left me weak and sore, as though I\'d been back on\r\nthe terrace at home, listening to my father talk and looking at his\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Joe left me in peace at last, just for the sake of the rest and\r\nchange I turned my attention to music, or, rather, to a musical friend,\r\na young Bohemian composer who lived wholly in a world of his own. I\r\nexplored this musical world of his, by his side in dark top galleries,\r\nin the Cafe Rouge on concert nights, in his room at his piano. How\r\ndeliciously far away from hay was this chap\'s feeling for Mozart. With\r\nhim I could feel sure of myself, of the way I was living for my art, of\r\nwhat my mother way back at the start had called the "fine things" in\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nI remember the night we heard "Boheme" from the gallery of the Opera\r\nComique. I remember the talk we had late that night, and my walk by the\r\nedge of the Gardens home--and the letter and the cable that I found\r\nwaiting on my desk. The letter was from my father and told me that my\r\nmother was dying. The cable told me she was dead.\r\n\r\nI remember learning that letter by heart on that long ocean voyage home.\r\nThis was no sudden illness, I learned, my mother had known of it while I\r\nwas home, known that she had it and that it was fatal. That was the news\r\nshe had told my father alone that night on the terrace! That was why she\r\nhad been so eager to get me away to Paris; that was why she had kept me\r\nabroad!\r\n\r\n"She did not want you to see how she looked," my father wrote. "She\r\nwanted you to remember her always as she was when you saw her last."\r\n\r\nI remembered her now. What a young beast I had been to forget her, to\r\ndrop her so utterly out of my thoughts in that selfish happy Paris life,\r\nwhen it was she who had sent me there, when it was she who had set me\r\nfree for a time from the harbor which was now dragging me back, when it\r\nwas she from the very start who had fostered this passion for "all that\r\nis fine." I remembered her now--remembered and remembered--until her\r\ndear image filled me.\r\n\r\nMy father\'s letter went on to tell how she had fought for her life.\r\nThree operations, all three of them failures, but still she had held\r\nbravely on in hopes of some new discovery which science might make and\r\nso bring her a cure. A thought suddenly gripped me and struck me cold.\r\nIt had all depended on science, on men working calmly and coldly along\r\nin laboratories all over the world, while my mother had held to her\r\nthread of life and hoped that these laboratory gods would hurry, hurry\r\nwhile yet there was time! How many thousands like her every day, every\r\nhour all over the world were watching those gods with that awful\r\nsuspense. For they were the only gods that were left, and a comfortless\r\nset of gods they were! They were like J. K., they had hay minds! They\r\nwere businesslike, relentless, cold, they belonged to the world of the\r\nharbor! My mother\'s kind god was a myth and a joke, with no power here\r\none way or the other. I _felt_ that now, I had _thought_ it before, only\r\nthought it, with that gay freedom of thought we had aired back there in\r\nParis. But I knew now that deep underneath I had believed all along in\r\nthis god of hers, as I had in my beautiful goddess of art and in all the\r\nthings that were fine. It had taken this news from the harbor to bring\r\nhim tottering, crashing down. For no god like hers would have let her\r\ndie! And I felt fear now, the fear of Death, whom I\'d never really\r\nnoticed before and who now seemed to say to me,\r\n\r\n"She is nothing--has gone nowhere--she is only dead!"\r\n\r\nAnd fiercely in a bewildered way I rebelled against this emptiness. I\r\nrebelled against this world of hay that was so abruptly dragging me back\r\nto a sense of its almighty grip on my life. When my ship came up the\r\nBay, the world looked harsh and gray to me, though there was a bright\r\nand sunny glare on the muddy waves of the harbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nMy mother had been buried several days before I reached home.\r\n\r\nI found Sue waiting on the dock, and I saw with a little shock of\r\nsurprise that my young sister was grown up. I had never noticed her much\r\nbefore. Sue and I had never got on from the start. She had been my\r\nfather\'s chum and I had been my mother\'s. I had always felt her mocking\r\nsmile toward me and all my solemn thoughts. And after that small\r\ncatastrophe which I had had with Eleanore, I had more than ever avoided\r\nSue and her girl friends. Then I had gone to college, and each time that\r\nI came home she had seemed to me all arms and legs, fool secrets and\r\nfool giggles--a most uninteresting kid. I remember being distinctly\r\nsurprised when I brought Joe home for Christmas to find that he thought\r\nher quite a girl. But now she was all different. She had grown tall and\r\ngraceful, lithe, and in her suit of mourning she looked so much older,\r\nher face thin and worn, subdued and softened by all she\'d been through.\r\nFor the weight of all those weary weeks had been upon her shoulders.\r\nThere was something pitiful about her. I came up and kissed her\r\nawkwardly, then found myself suddenly holding her close. She clung to me\r\nand trembled a little. I found it hard to speak.\r\n\r\n"I wish I\'d been here, too," I said gruffly.\r\n\r\n"I wish you had, Billy--it\'s been a long time."\r\n\r\nAll at once Sue and I had become close friends.\r\n\r\nWe had a long talk, at home that day, and she told me how our parents\r\nhad drawn together in the last years, of how my poor mother had wanted\r\nmy father close by her side and of how he had responded, neglecting his\r\nbusiness and spending his last dollar on doctors, consultations and\r\ntrips to sanitariums, anything to keep up her strength. He had even read\r\n"Pendennis" aloud. How changed he must have been to do that. I knew why\r\nshe had wanted to hear it again. It had been our favorite book. I\r\nremembered how I had read it to her just before I went abroad, and how I\r\nhad caught her watching me with that hungry despairing look in her eyes.\r\nWhat a young brute I had been to go!... For a time Sue\'s voice seemed\r\nfar away. Then I heard her telling how over that story of a young author\r\nmy mother had talked to my father of me.\r\n\r\n"He\'s going to try to know you, Billy, and help you," said Sue. "He\r\npromised her that before she died. And I hope you\'re going to help him,\r\ntoo. He needs you very badly. You never understood father, you know. I\r\ndon\'t believe you have any idea of what he has gone through in his\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? Have things gone wrong?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand it very well. He hardly ever speaks of it. I think\r\nhe\'d better tell you himself."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat evening in his library, from my seat by the table, I furtively\r\nwatched my father\'s face. He sat in a huge chair against the wall, with\r\na smaller chair in front for his feet, his vest unbuttoned, his short\r\nheavy body settled low as he grimly kept his eyes on his book. The\r\nstrong overhead light which shone on his face showed me the deeper\r\nlines, all the wrinkles, the broad loose pouch of skin on the throat,\r\nthe gray color, the pain, the weakness and the age in his motionless\r\neyes. What was going on in there? Sometimes it would seem an hour before\r\nhe turned another page. All afternoon he had been at her grave.\r\n\r\nHe had given her no happy life. Was it of that he was thinking? I felt\r\nashamed to be wondering, for he seemed so weak and old in his grief. Two\r\nyears ago his hair had been gray, but he had still looked strong and\r\nhale. I could hardly feel now that he was the same man. I felt drawn to\r\nhim now, I wished he would put down his book and talk and tell me\r\neverything about her.\r\n\r\nBut what an embarrassing job it is to get acquainted with one\'s father.\r\nWhen Sue had left us after dinner, there had been a few brief remarks\r\nand then this long tense silence. I, too, pretended to be reading.\r\n\r\n"Your mother thought a lot of you, boy." He spoke at last so abruptly\r\nthat I looked up at him with a start, and saw him watching me anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir." I looked quickly down, and our eyes did not meet again after\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n"It was her pluck that kept you in Paris--while she was dying."\r\n\r\nI choked:\r\n\r\n"I know."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know--not how she wanted you back--you\'ll never know. I\r\nwanted to write you to come home."\r\n\r\n"I wish you had!"\r\n\r\n"She wouldn\'t hear of it!"\r\n\r\n"I see." Another silence. Why couldn\'t I think of something to say?\r\n\r\n"She kept every letter you wrote her. They\'re up there in her bureau\r\ndrawer. She was always reading \'em--over and over. She thought a lot of\r\nyour writing, boy--of what you would do when--when she was dead." The\r\nlast came out almost fiercely. I waited a moment, got hold of myself.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," I brought out at last.\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ll make it all worth while."\r\n\r\n"I will. I\'ll try. I\'ll do my best." I did not look up, for I could\r\nstill feel his anxious eyes upon my face.\r\n\r\n"Do you want to go back to Paris?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir! I want to stay right here!" What was the matter with my fool\r\nvoice?\r\n\r\n"Have you got any plans for your writing here? How are you going about\r\nit to start?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, to begin with--I\'ve got some stuff I did abroad."\r\n\r\n"Stories?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly----"\r\n\r\n"Poems?" My father\'s look was tragic.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nAnd I tried to explain what I had been doing. But my attempts to tell\r\nhim of my work in Paris were as forced and as pathetic as his efforts to\r\nattend. More and more halting grew our talk, and it ended in a silence\r\nthat seemed to have no end. Then I went to the fireplace, knocked the\r\nashes out of my pipe, refilled it and relit it. When I returned he was\r\nreading his book, and with deep relief I took up mine. That much of it\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nBut again I found myself watching him. What was in my father\'s mind? Why\r\nthis anxious almost humble tone? It made me wince, it made me ashamed. I\r\nsat there all evening pretending to read and feeling that he was doing\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n"Good night, dad--I think I\'ll go to bed." Even this little came\r\nclumsily. I had never called him "dad" before.\r\n\r\n"Good night, my boy. See you at breakfast."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\nI glanced back as I turned down the hall and saw him staring after me.\r\n\r\nWhat was it he was thinking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n"I\'m closing out my business, son," he told me the next morning. Here\r\nwas another sharp surprise. I did not look at him as I asked:\r\n\r\n"Why are you doing that, sir?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a long story. Times have changed and I\'m getting old."\r\n\r\nAgain I felt suddenly drawn to him. He was old and no mistake. Why had I\r\nnever known him till now?\r\n\r\n"Look here--Dad." The last word still came awkwardly. "Can\'t I possibly\r\nbe any help down there?" He shot an anxious look at me:\r\n\r\n"Why, yes. Glad to have you. I still have a young clerk, but I\'d rather\r\nhave you."\r\n\r\nOnly one clerk! What had gone wrong with his business?\r\n\r\nBut that day in his warehouse, which was empty now and silent, the mere\r\nghost of what it had been, he seemed in no hurry to show me. On the\r\ncontrary, he went back to the ledgers of his earliest years in business,\r\non the flimsy pretext of looking up certain figures and dates. He did\r\nnot need me here, the work he gave me was absurd, I was simply taking\r\nthe musty books from their piles in the closet and arranging them by\r\nyears on the floor. "To save time," he said. But he himself was still on\r\nthat first ledger, stopping to talk, to ramble off from the pages before\r\nhim. What did it mean? As the days wore on and he still delayed and at\r\nnight that strange humility crept again into his eyes, with a slowly\r\ndeepening suspense I came to feel that instead of saving time my father\r\nwas trying to make it, to go far back into his vigorous past for\r\nstrength to meet his present--because he dreaded what we would find at\r\nthe end of our work on these dusty books, the last grim figure in\r\ndollars and cents that would stand there as the result of his life, as\r\nthe stepping-stone for Sue\'s and mine. And that was why he wanted me\r\nhere, this was his way of telling me the story of his business\r\nlife--before I saw what lay at the end. And as in our work that story\r\nunfolded, though at times it cast its spell on me hard, revealing what a\r\nman he had been, there were other times when from somewhere deep inside\r\nof me a small selfish voice would ask:\r\n\r\n"What is left? How much has he saved from the wreck? What is this going\r\nto mean to my life?"\r\n\r\nIn the ledgers his story was still alive. Yellow and dusty as they were,\r\nfor me day by day they revivified that still odorous old warehouse until\r\nI saw it as it had been, a huge dim caravansary for the curious products\r\nof all the earth. And that trick of feeling a man, which I had learned\r\nin Paris, made me keenly sensitive now to this lonely old stranger by my\r\nside with whom I was becoming acquainted. I could feel the pull of these\r\nbooks upon him, pulling him out of his cramped old age back to his glad\r\nboundless youth. How suddenly spacious they became as he slowly turned\r\nthe pages. Palm oil from Africa, cotton from Bombay, coffee from Arabia,\r\npepper from Sumatra. Turn the page. Ivory from Zanzibar, salt from Cadiz\r\nand wines from Bordeaux. Turn the page. Whale oil from the Arctic, iron\r\nfrom the Baltic, tortoise shell from the Fiji Islands. Turn the page!\r\nIndia silks and rugs and shawls, indigo, spices! Turn the page!\r\n\r\nI began to see the sails speed out along those starlit ocean roads. I\r\nbegan to feel the forces that had shaped my father\'s life. And little by\r\nlittle I saw in those days what not even my mother had understood, that\r\nin my father\'s business life there had been more than dollars, that what\r\nto us had seemed only a hobby, a dull obstinate fixed idea, had been for\r\nhim a glorious vision--the white sails of American clippers dotting all\r\nthe seven seas.\r\n\r\nSo they were in the late Fifties, when leaving the farm in Illinois he\r\ncame at sixteen to New York and found a job as time clerk in one of the\r\nship yards along the East River. They are all gone now, but then they\r\nwere humming and teeming with work. And my young father was deeply\r\nexcited. He told me of his first day here, when he stood on the deck of\r\na ferry and watched three great clippers go out with the tide, bound for\r\nCalcutta. There were pictures of these vessels on the walls of his\r\noffice, stately East Indiamen bearing such names as _Star of Empire_,\r\n_Daniel Webster_, _Ocean Monarch_, _Flying Cloud_--ships known in every\r\nport of the world for their speed. He told how a British vessel, her\r\ntopsails reefed in a gale of wind, would see a white tower of swelling\r\ncanvas come out of the spray behind her, come booming, staggering,\r\nplunging by--a Yankee clipper under royals. Press of sail? No other\r\nnation knew what it meant! Our owners took big chances, it was no trade\r\nfor nervous men!\r\n\r\nHe found a harbor that welcomed young men, where cabin boys rose to be\r\ncaptains, and clerks became owners of hundreds of ships. To work! To\r\nrise! To own yards like these, build ships like these and send them\r\nrushing on their courses out to all parts of the ocean world! This had\r\nbeen his vision, at the time when it was bright and clear. And as now he\r\nmade me feel it, the crude vital force that had been in his dream poured\r\ninto me deep, made me feel how shut in and one-sided had been my own\r\nvision and standards of life, gave me that profound surprise which many\r\nsons, I suppose, never have:\r\n\r\n"My father was once young like me--wiry, straight and tough like me, and\r\nas full of dreams of the things he would do."\r\n\r\nBut then had come the Civil War. Although only nineteen when the war\r\nbroke out, he was already the head clerk in his office. "But like every\r\nother young fool those days," he said, "I was caught by the noise of a\r\nbrass band!" Down South as a commissary clerk he found himself a tiny\r\npawn in that gigantic game of graft which made fat fortunes in the North\r\nand cost tens of thousands of soldiers their lives. He himself took\r\ntyphoid, and when the war was over he returned to New York, weak,\r\npenniless, to find his old work gone.\r\n\r\n"For the war," he said, "had busted American shipping sky high. Even\r\nbefore it began it had made the South so bitter that just for the sake\r\nof attacking the North the Solid South in congress had joined the damn\r\nfool Farmer West and attacked our mail subventions. \'No more of the\r\nnation\'s money,\' they said, \'for ship subsidies for New York and New\r\nEngland!\' And so all government protection of our shipping was\r\nwithdrawn. And when the war ended, with forty per cent of our ships\r\ngrabbed, sunk or sold, it was ruination to build any more, for the\r\nBritish and German governments were pouring millions of dollars a year\r\ninto the Cunard and the North German Lloyd, and we couldn\'t compete\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n"Still a few of the ship yards kept on, and in one of these at last I\r\ngot a job at eight dollars a week. \'The war is over,\' we told ourselves,\r\n\'and the government can\'t stay blind forever. They\'ll see what they\'ve\r\ndone, and within a few months they\'ll go back to the old policy.\'\r\nMonths? I stuck to that job and waited five years--and still no news\r\nfrom Washington. \'My boy,\' said a doddering Brooklynite, \'the nation has\r\nturned her face westward.\'"\r\n\r\nThen he left the ship yards and went into a warehouse, where the work\r\nlay mainly in handling cargoes of foreign ships. And starting life all\r\nover again he tried to make up for lost time. The first year he was a\r\nshipping clerk; the second, a bookkeeper; the third, he kept two sets of\r\nbooks for two different docks, one by day and the other at night. And by\r\nforty he had become a part owner in the old warehouse in which he now\r\nsat grimly reading the record of his life--of a long stubborn losing\r\nfight, for he stuck to his dream of Yankee sails.\r\n\r\nHe married my mother when he was still strong and full of hope. He must\r\nhave been so much kindlier then and brighter, more human to live with.\r\nThey bought that pleasant house of ours with its hospitable front door.\r\nMy father\'s doddering Brooklynites seemed wonderful neighbors to his\r\nyoung wife. And so that front door waited for friends. As the years\r\ndragged on and they did not come, she blamed it all on the harbor. She\r\nsaw what it was making him, jealous of every dollar and every hour spent\r\nat home. He worked all day and half the night. It took him into\r\npolitics, on countless trips to Washington, and she knew he spent\r\nthousands of dollars there in ways that were by no means "fine." It made\r\nhim morose and gloomy, a man of one idea, to be shunned.\r\n\r\nAnd she no more saw behind all this than I did when I was a boy. For his\r\nvision was neither of pirates nor of bringing the heathen to Christ, but\r\nof imports and of exports. He dreamed in terms of battleships and of a\r\nmercantile marine. Each year he watched the chances grow, vast\r\ncontinents opening up to commerce with hints of such riches as staggered\r\nthe mind. He saw the ocean world an arena into which rushed all nations\r\nbut ours.\r\n\r\n"Everyone but us," he said, "had learned the big lesson--that you can\r\nget nothing on land or sea unless you\'re ready to fight for it hard!"\r\n\r\nHe saw other nations get ready to fight. He watched them build huge\r\nnavies and grant heavy subsidies to their fast growing merchant fleets,\r\nsend vessels by thousands over the seas. He saw their shipowners draw\r\nswiftly together in great corporations. Here was an age for immense\r\nadventures in this growing trade of the world. To wait, to hold on\r\ngrimly, to keep up the fight at Washington for that miracle, Protection,\r\nwhich would start the boom. To see the shipping yards teeming again with\r\nthe building of ships by the hundreds and thousands, to see them go out\r\nagain over the seas with our flag at the mast and our sailors below. To\r\nfeel the new call go over the nation--"Young men, come east and west,\r\ncome out! The first place on the oceans can still be yours!" This was my\r\nfather\'s great idea.\r\n\r\nShip subsidies and battleships, discriminating tariffs. What a religion.\r\nBut it was his. Of the miracles these things would work my father was\r\nmore sure than of a god in heaven. For he had thought very little about\r\na god, and all his life he had thought about this. For this he had spent\r\nat least half his wealth on the congressmen that he despised. Bribery?\r\nYes. But for a religion.\r\n\r\n"Go all around South America and to the Far East," he told me. "And\r\nyou\'ll see the flags at sea of England, Germany, Austria, France, of\r\nRussia, Norway, Spain, Japan. But if you see the American flag you\'ll\r\nsee it waved by a little girl from the deck of a British liner. This\r\nmeans that we are losing in marine freights and foreign trade billions\r\nof dollars every year. And it means more and worse than that. For it\'s\r\nship building and ship sailing that take a nation\'s men out of their\r\nruts, whip up their minds and imaginations, make \'em broad as the seven\r\nseas. And we\'ve lost all that, we\'ve thrown it away, to breed a race of\r\nfarmers--of factory hands and miners and anarchists in slums. We\'ve\r\nbuilt a nation of high finance--and graft--and a rising angry mob. But\r\nsooner or later, boy, this country will wake up to what it has done. And\r\nwith our grip on both oceans and the blood we\'ve still got in our veins,\r\nwe\'ll reach out and take what is ours--as soon as we\'re ready to fight\r\nfor it hard--the mastery of the ocean world!"\r\n\r\nFor this idea he had lived his life. For this he had neglected his\r\nbusiness, for this he had lost favor with the usurping foreign\r\nships--until his dock and his warehouse were often idle for weeks at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAnd the very bigness of things, the era of big companies which at forty\r\nhad thrilled him by the first signs of its coming, now crushed down\r\nupon his old age. Vaguely he knew that the harbor had changed and that\r\nhe was too old to change with it. An era no longer of human adventures\r\nfor young men but of financial adventures for mammoth corporations,\r\ngreat foreign shipping companies combining in agreements with the\r\nAmerican railroads to freeze out all the little men and take to\r\nthemselves the whole port of New York. My father was one of these little\r\nmen. The huge company to which he was selling owned the docks and\r\nwarehouses for over two miles, and this was only a part of their\r\nholdings.\r\n\r\n"Nothing without fighting." That had been his motto. And he had fought\r\nand he had lost. And so in this new harbor of big companies my father\r\nwas now closing out. Too late for any business here, too late for life\r\nup there in his home. He had kept my mother waiting too long, he was\r\nready at last but she was dead. Too late. He had been born too late, had\r\ndreamed his dream of sails too late, and now he was too late in dying.\r\nThere was nothing left to live for. How much better for him to be dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried to tell his story as my father felt it, at the times when\r\nit took him out of himself and made him forget himself and me. But there\r\nwere other times when he remembered himself and me, and those were the\r\ntimes that hurt the most. For in that new humility in his eyes and in\r\nhis voice I could feel him then preparing us both--me to see why it was\r\nthat he could not do for me what _she_ had wished; himself to hold on\r\ngrimly, to find a new job for his old age, to keep from becoming a\r\nburden--on me.\r\n\r\nAt last we were coming to the end--to that last figure in dollars and\r\ncents. I caught his suspense and we talked little now. I knew the price\r\nat which he was selling, and toward that figure I watched the debts\r\ncreep slowly up. I saw them creep over, and knew that we had not a\r\ndollar left to live on. And still the debts kept mounting. How small\r\nthey were, these last ones, a coil of rope, two kegs of paint--the irony\r\nof it compared to the bigness of his life. Still these little figures\r\nclimbed. At last he handed me his balance. He was in debt four thousand,\r\none hundred and forty-six dollars and seventeen cents.\r\n\r\nHe had risen from his old office chair:\r\n\r\n"Well, son, I guess that ends our work."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\nHe went out of the office.\r\n\r\nI sat there dully for some time. Then I remember there came a harsh\r\nscream from a freight engine close outside. And I looked out of the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nThe harbor of big companies, uglier than I had ever seen it, no longer\r\ndotted with white sails, but clouded with the smoke and soot of an age\r\nof steam, and iron, lay sprawled out there like a thing alive. Always\r\nchanging, always growing, it had crushed the life out of my father and\r\nmother, and now it was ready for Sue and me.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to stay here and make money."\r\n\r\nGood-by to the Beautiful City of Grays. A clock in an outer room struck\r\nfive. In Paris it was ten o\'clock, and those friends of mine from all\r\ncountries were crowding into "The Dirty Spoon." I could see them\r\nsauntering one by one on that summer\'s night down the gay old Boulevard\r\nSaint Michel and dropping into their seats at the table in the corner.\r\n\r\n"How am I to make money? By writing?"\r\n\r\nI thought of De Maupassant and the rest, and the two years I had spent\r\nin trying to make vivid and real the life I had seen. In these last\r\nanxious weeks I had sent some of my Paris sketches to magazine offices\r\nin New York. They had all been returned with printed slips of rejection,\r\nexcept in one case where the editor wrote, "This is a good piece of\r\nwriting, but the subject is too remote. Why not try something nearer\r\nhome?"\r\n\r\n"All right," I thought, "what\'s near me here? Let\'s see. There\'s a cloud\r\nof yellow smoke I can do, with a brand-new tug below it dragging a\r\nstring of good big barges. What are they loaded with? Standard Oil. Wait\r\ntill they get closer and I can even describe the smell! No," I concluded\r\nsavagely. "Let\'s keep my writing clean out of this hole and get the\r\nmoney some other way!"\r\n\r\nThen suddenly I forgot myself and thought of my stern brave old dad.\r\nWhat under the sun was he going to do?\r\n\r\nThat week he mortgaged our house on the Heights for five thousand\r\ndollars. With this he paid off all his debts and put the balance in the\r\nbank. Then from the big dock company he got a job in his own warehouse\r\nat a hundred dollars a month.\r\n\r\n"Kind of \'em," he said gruffly. He was sixty-five years old. They were\r\neven kind enough to add to that a job for me. I sat at the desk next to\r\nhis and I was paid ten dollars a week.\r\n\r\nSue let the servants go, hired one green German girl and said she knew\r\nshe could run the house on a hundred and twenty dollars a month. But the\r\nAugust bills went over that, so we drew money out of the bank. My father\r\nhad bronchitis that week. We managed to keep him in bed for three days,\r\nbut then he struggled up and dressed and went back to his desk in the\r\nwarehouse.\r\n\r\n"Keep your eye on him down there," said Sue. "He\'s so terribly feeble."\r\n\r\n"This can\'t go on," I told her.\r\n\r\nI must make more than ten dollars a week. Again I sent out some of my\r\nsketches, again the magazines sent them back. I went to a newspaper\r\noffice, but there an ironical office boy, with the aid of the city\r\neditor, made me feel that reporting was not in my line. What other work\r\ncould I find to do? How much time did I have? How long was my father\r\ngoing to last? I watched his face and our bank account. I studied the\r\n"want ads" in the press. But the more I studied the smaller I felt, for\r\nthis was one of the years of depression. "Two Hundred Thousand In New\r\nYork Idle," I read in a headline. Here was literature that gripped!\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'ll stay right where I am. It\'s safer," I thought anxiously.\r\n"Perhaps if I work hard enough they\'ll give me a raise at Christmas.\r\nWhen Dad was my age he kept two sets of books, one by day and the other\r\nat night. How can I make my evenings pay?"\r\n\r\nI took long walks in Brooklyn and picked up night work here and there.\r\nIt was monotonous clerical work, and being slow at figures I was often\r\nat it till midnight. Very late one evening, while making out bills in a\r\nhardware store, I suddenly came to a customer whose initials were J. K.\r\nIt started me thinking of Joe Kramer and our last long talk--about hay.\r\n\r\n"So this is hay," I told myself. "How long will it take me to get a hay\r\nmind, back here by this damned harbor?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Sue began to take me in hand. From the subdued and weary girl that\r\nI had found when I came home, in the last few weeks she had blossomed\r\nout. The color had come into her cheeks, a new animation into her voice,\r\na resolute brightness into her eyes.\r\n\r\n"This thing has got to stop, Billy," she said determinedly. "This house\r\nhas been like a tomb for months, you and Dad are so gloomy and tired\r\nyou\'re sights. He needs a change, and so do you. You\'re getting into a\r\nlittle rut and throwing away your chance to write. You need friends who\r\nare writers, you need a lot of fresh ideas to tone you up. There\'s\r\nplenty of money in writing. And I need a change myself. I can\'t stand\r\nthis house any longer. After all, I\'ve got my own life to live. I\'m\r\ngoing to get a job before long. In the meantime I\'m going to see my\r\nfriends. And what\'s more, I\'m going to have them here to the house---\r\njust as often as they\'ll come! Let\'s brighten things up a little!"\r\n\r\nI looked at her with interest. Here was _another_ sister of mine--risen\r\nout of her sorrow and eager to live, and talking of running our lives as\r\nwell, of curing us both by large, firm doses of "fresh ideas," while she\r\nherself looked around for a job that would help her to "live her own\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Sue," I argued vaguely. "You don\'t want to take a job----"\r\n\r\n"I certainly do----"\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t! Dad wouldn\'t hear to it!"\r\n\r\n"He\'ll have to--when I\'ve found it. No poor feeble old man supporting\r\nme, thank you--quite probably no man at all--ever! But you needn\'t\r\nworry. I won\'t take any old job that comes along. And I won\'t bother\r\nDad till I\'ve found just what I really want--something I can grow in."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, take it easy," I said.\r\n\r\n"Where have you been!" I thought as I watched her. It came over me as a\r\ndistinct surprise that Sue had been in all sorts of places and had been\r\nmaking all sorts of friends, had been having ambitions and dreams of her\r\nown--all the time I had been having mine. Most older brothers, I\r\nsuppose, at some time or another have felt this same bewilderment. "Look\r\nhere, Sis," they wonder gravely, "where in thunder have you been?"\r\n\r\nI took a keen interest in her now. In the evenings when I wasn\'t out\r\nworking we had long talks about our lives, which to my satisfaction\r\nbecame almost entirely talks about _her_ life, her needs, her growth.\r\nHer delight in herself, her intensity over plans for herself, her\r\nenthusiasm for all the new "movements," reforms and ideas that she had\r\nheard of God-knows-where and felt she must gather into herself to expand\r\nherself--it was wonderful! She was like that chap from Detroit, that\r\nwould-be perfect all-round man. But Sue was so much less solemn about\r\nit, one minute in art and the next in social settlements, so little\r\nhampered by ever putting through what she planned.\r\n\r\n"In short, a woman," I thought sagely.\r\n\r\nI felt I knew a lot about women, although I had had no more intimate\r\ntalks since that affair in Paris. I had felt that would last me for\r\nquite a while. But here was something perfectly safe. A sister, decent\r\nbut far from dull, well stocked with all the feminine points and only\r\ntoo glad to be confidential. She wanted to study for the stage! Of\r\ncourse that was the kind of thing that Dad and I would stop darned\r\nquick. Still--I could see Sue on the stage. She was not at all like me.\r\nI was middling small, with a square jaw, snub nose and sandy hair. Sue\r\nwas tall and easy moving, with an abundance of soft brown hair worn low\r\nover large and irregular features. She had fascinating eyes. She could\r\nsprawl on a rug or a sofa as lazy and indolent as you please--all but\r\nher eyes, they were always doing something or other, letting this out or\r\nkeeping that back, practicing on me!\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, she\'ll marry soon enough," I thought. "This talk of a job for\r\nlife is a joke."\r\n\r\nSome nights I would listen to her for hours. It was so good to come back\r\nto life, to feel younger than my worries, to forget for a little while\r\nthat stark heavy certainty that poor old Dad would soon be a burden in\r\nspite of himself, and that with a family on my hands I\'d have to spend\r\nthe best years of my life slaving for a little hay.\r\n\r\nI took the same delight in her friends.\r\n\r\nStarting with her classmates in a Brooklyn high school, most of whom\r\nwere working over in New York, Sue had followed in their trail, and at\r\nsettlements, in studios and in girl bachelor flats she had picked up an\r\namazing assortment of friends. "Radicals," they called themselves.\r\nNothing was too wild or new for these friends of Sue\'s to jump into--and\r\nwhat was more, to tie themselves to by a regular job in some queer\r\nirregular office. "Votes for Women" was just starting up, and one of\r\nthis group, a stenographer in a suffragette office, had been in the\r\nfirst small parade. Another, a stout florid youth who wrote poems for\r\nmagazines, had paraded bravely in her wake. Here were two girls who\r\nlived in a tenement, did their own cooking and pushed East Side\r\ninvestigations that they said would soon "shake up the town." There were\r\nseveral rising muckrakers, too, some of whom did free work on the side\r\nfor socialist papers. There was one real socialist, a painter, who had a\r\nred membership card in his pocket to prove that he belonged to "the\r\nParty." Others were spreading music and art and dramatics through the\r\ntenements--new music, new art and new dramatics. One young husband and\r\nwife, intensely in love with one another, were working together night\r\nand day for easier divorces which would put an end to the old-fashioned\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThese people seemed to me to be laughing at a different old thing every\r\ntime. But when they weren\'t laughing they were scowling, over some new\r\nattack upon life--and when they did that they were laughable. At least\r\nso they were to me. Not that I minded attacking things, I had done\r\nplenty of that myself in Paris. But how different we had been back\r\nthere. We, too, had thrown old creeds to the winds, but with how much\r\nmore finesse and art. And there had been a large remoteness about it.\r\nEach one had tossed his far-away country into the cosmopolitan pot, our\r\ntalk had been on a world-wide scale. But this crude crowd, except for\r\noccasional mental flights, kept all its attention, its laughs and its\r\njeers, its attacks and exposures centered on this one mammoth town,\r\nagainst which as a background they seemed the merest pigmies. Three\r\nlittle muckrakers loomed against Wall Street, one small, scoffing\r\nsuffragette against a hundred and eighty thousand solid stolid Brooklyn\r\nwives. They had posed themselves so absurdly close to the world of\r\nthings as they are.\r\n\r\nAnd they were in such a rush about their work. Over there in Paris, with\r\nall our smashing of idols, we had at least held fast to our one great\r\ngoddess of art, we had slaved like dogs at the hard daily labor of\r\nhonestly learning our various crafts. But here they stopped for nothing\r\nat all. The magazine writers were "tearing off copy," the painters were\r\nsimply "slapping it down." One of them told me he "painted the real\r\nstuff right out of life"--dashed it off with one hand, so to speak,\r\nwhile he shook his fist at the town with the other. Everyone wanted to\r\nsee something done--and done damn quick--about this, that or the other.\r\n\r\nMy artist\'s eyes surveyed this group and twinkled with amused surprise.\r\nBut I could sit by the hour and listen to their talk. I found it mighty\r\nrefreshing, after those bills in the hardware shop, that monotonous\r\nmartyr feeling of mine and those worries down by the harbor.\r\n\r\nBut I felt the harbor always there, slowly closing in on my father, who\r\nlooked older day by day, slowly bringing things to a crisis. In the\r\ngarden behind our house on warm September evenings when these pigmies\r\ngathered to chatter reforms, the harbor hooted at their little plans as\r\nit had hooted at my own. One evening, I remember, when the talk had\r\nwaxed hot and loud in favor of labor unions and strikes, Sue left the\r\ngroup and with a friend strolled to the lower end of the garden. There I\r\nsaw them peer over the edge and listen to the drunken stokers singing in\r\nthe barrooms deep under all these flower beds and all this adventurous\r\nchatter of ours. I thought of the years I had spent with Sam--and Sue,\r\ntoo, seemed to me to be having a spree. Poor kid, what a jolt she would\r\nget some day. She called me "our dreamer imported from France." But I\r\nwas far from dreaming.\r\n\r\nPresently the harbor just opened one of its big eyes and sent up by a\r\nmessenger a little grim reality.\r\n\r\nA Russian revolutionist had appeared among us with a letter to Sue from\r\nJoe Kramer. Joe, I found to my surprise, had seen quite a little of Sue\r\nover here while I had been in Paris--and from the various ships and\r\nhotels that had been his "home" of late, he had written her now and\r\nthen. Through him Sue had joined a society known as "The Friends of\r\nRussian Freedom," and Joe wrote now from Moscow urging her to "stir up\r\nthe crowd and lick this fellow into shape to talk at big meetings and\r\nraise some cash. He has the real goods," Joe added. "All he needs is the\r\nEnglish language and a few points about making it yellow. If handled\r\nright he\'ll be a scream."\r\n\r\nHe was handled right and he was a scream. Three months later he finished\r\na tour that had netted over ten thousand dollars. Now to buy guns and\r\nship them to Russia--where in the awful poverty bequeathed to them by\r\nthe war with Japan, a bitter people was still fighting hard to make an\r\nend of autocracy.\r\n\r\n"I think I can help you, Puss," said Dad.\r\n\r\nI looked at him with interest. I knew he had been as tickled as I by\r\nthese astonishing friends of hers. "Revolooters," he called them. He was\r\na great favorite with the girls.\r\n\r\n"I once knew a man in a business way who dealt in guns," he explained to\r\nSue. "He shipped some to Bolivia from my dock. I\'ll have him up to meet\r\nyour friend."\r\n\r\nSo this messenger from the harbor, a keen lean man of business, gave one\r\nhour of his time to the problem in which the Russian dreamer had been\r\nabsorbed for fifteen years. And the hour made the fifteen years look\r\ndecidedly dreamy.\r\n\r\n"Guns for Russia, eh?" he said. "How\'ll you get \'em into your country?\r\nWhere\'s your frontier weakest? You don\'t know? Then I\'ll tell you." And\r\nthe man of business did. "Now what kind of guns do you want? You hadn\'t\r\nthought? Well, my friend, you want Mausers. They happen to be cheap just\r\nnow in Vienna. You should have looked into that before you traipsed way\r\nover here. You can get \'em there for three twenty apiece--they dropped\r\nthree cents last Tuesday."\r\n\r\nThe dreamer dreamed hard and fast for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Then," he cried triumphantly, "wit\' ten t\'ousand dollairs I can buy\r\nover t\'ree t\'ousand guns!"\r\n\r\nThe gunman\'s look was patient.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want to shoot \'em off?" he inquired. "Because if you do\r\nyou\'ll need ammunition. You ought to have a thousand rounds, which will\r\ncome to a little over three times the actual cost of the guns\r\nthemselves. You see when you shoot off a gun at an army you want to have\r\nplenty of cartridges or else be ready to run like hell.\r\n\r\n"On second thought," he added, "I advise you to give up the Mausers and\r\ngo in for Springfields over here--old ones--you can get \'em cheap.\r\nThey\'re no good at over a mile, but for the first few months your\r\nfellahs will be lucky if they hit a man at a hundred yards. And there\'s\r\none good point about Springfields, they make a devil of a noise--and\r\nthat\'s all you need for a starter, noise enough to break into headlines\r\nall over the world as a \'Brave Little Rebel Army.\' If you can do that,\r\nand the word goes around on the quiet that you\'re using American\r\nrifles--well, there\'s a kind of a sentiment in our trade--you\'ll find us\r\nall behind you. We\'ll even _lose_ money. We\'re a queer bunch."\r\n\r\n"But wait!" cried the Russian. "Dere ees a trouble! Your tr-reaty wit\'\r\nRussia! Have you not a tr-reaty which makes it forbidden to sell to me\r\nguns?"\r\n\r\nAgain that look of patience:\r\n\r\n"Yes, General, we have a tr-reaty. But we\'ll ship your guns as grand\r\npianos to Naples, from there by slow boat down to Brazil and then up to\r\nthe Baltic, where they\'ll arrive with their pedigrees lost. Our agent\r\nwill be there ahead, he\'ll have found a customhouse man he can fix,\r\nhe\'ll cable us where--and when those fifty pianos are landed the said\r\nofficial will open the box marked twenty-two. It\'ll take him over an\r\nhour to do it, the boards will be nailed so cussedly tight. And he\'ll\r\nfind a real piano inside. Then he\'ll look at the other forty-nine crates\r\nand say, \'Oh, Hell!\' in Russian. Then they\'ll go on to wherever you want\r\n\'em--and you\'ll revolute. But don\'t forget that what you need most is\r\nthe livest press agent you can find. I\'ve got to go now. Think it over.\r\nAnd if you want to do business with me come to my office to-morrow at\r\nten."\r\n\r\nThe man of business left us. And while the dreamer talked like mad and\r\nfinally decided that as Mausers were "shoot farther guns" he had better\r\ngo to Vienna, I watched the twinkle in Dad\'s gray eyes and thought of\r\nthe cool contempt in his friend\'s. And from being amused I became rather\r\nsore. For, after all, this little Russian cuss had risked his life for\r\nfifteen years and expected to lose it shortly. (As a matter of fact, he\r\nwas stood up against a wall and shot the following April.) Why make him\r\nlook so small?\r\n\r\nWas there nothing under the heavens that this infernal harbor didn\'t\r\nknow all about, and "do business with" so thoroughly that it could\r\nalways smile?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I drudged on down there in the warehouse, my bitterness became an\r\nobsession. I even talked about it to Sue.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Billy, you make me tired," she said. "Here I\'ve taken the trouble\r\nto bring to the house every magazine writer I know. And they\'re all\r\nready to help you break in--but you won\'t write, you won\'t even try!"\r\n\r\n"How do you know I haven\'t tried?" I retorted hotly. "But I\'m working\r\nall day as it is--and four nights a week besides. And the other three\r\nnights, when I try to think of the kind of thing that I could sell to\r\nthe magazines--well, I simply can\'t do it, that\'s all--it\'s not my way\r\nof writing!"\r\n\r\n"Then your way is just plain morbid," she said, "and it\'s about time you\r\ndropped it." She seemed to get a sudden idea. "I know the person _you_\r\nought to meet----"\r\n\r\n"Do you? What\'s his name?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"Eleanore Dillon," she answered. I looked up at her with a start.\r\n\r\n"Eleanore Dillon? Is she still around?"\r\n\r\nI hadn\'t thought of that girl in years.\r\n\r\n"She is--and she\'s just what you need," said Sue, with that know-it-all\r\nsmile of hers. Her head was now cocked a bit to one side. "Your little\r\nfriend of long ago," she added sympathetically. I eyed Sue for a moment.\r\nI did not care at all for her tone.\r\n\r\n"What do I need _her_ for?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"To talk to you of the harbor, of course--that\'s her especial line these\r\ndays."\r\n\r\n"The harbor?" I demanded. "That girl?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--the harbor, that girl." Sue seemed to be having quite a good time.\r\nMy jaw set tight.\r\n\r\n"What does she do down there?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"She worships her father. Don\'t you remember? An engineer. He\'s doing a\r\nbig piece of work on the harbor and Eleanore is wrapped up in his work,\r\nshe\'s a beautiful case of how a fond parent can literally swallow up his\r\nchild. There used to be nothing whatever that Eleanore Dillon wasn\'t\r\ngoing to do in life. Don\'t you remember, when she was small, that little\r\ndetermined air she had in the way she went at every game? Well, she grew\r\neven more like that. From school she went to college and worked herself\r\nto a frazzle. Then she broke down and had to drop out, and now that\r\nshe\'s strong again she\'s changed. She used to go in for everything. Now\r\nshe goes in for nothing at all except her father and his work. She\r\nthinks we\'re all a lot of young fools."\r\n\r\n"Oh, now, Sue," I put in derisively. "You people fools? How could she?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see," my sister sweetly replied, "for she\'ll probably think\r\nyou\'re another. She detests morbid people, they\'re not her kind. But if\r\nshe\'ll give you a talking to it may do you a lot of good."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe did give me a talking to and it did do me a lot of good, although\r\nwhen I came to think of it I found she had barely talked at all.\r\n\r\nShe wasn\'t the sort who liked to talk, she was just as quiet as before.\r\nWhen she arrived rather late one evening and Sue brought her out on the\r\nverandah into a group of those radical friends who were a committee for\r\nsomething or other, after the general greetings were over she settled\r\nback in a corner with the air of one who likes just to listen to people,\r\nno matter whether they\'re fools or not. But as I watched her I decided\r\nshe did not consider these people fools. That quiet smile that came on\r\nher face showed a comfortable curiosity and now and then a gleam of\r\namusement, but no contempt whatever. She seemed a girl so well pleased\r\nwith her life that she could be pleased with the world besides and keep\r\nher eyes open for all there was in it. Although she was still rather\r\nsmall and still demurely feminine, with the same grave sweetness in her\r\neyes, that same enchanting freshness about everything she wore, she\r\nstruck me at once as having changed, as having grown tremendously, as\r\nhaving somehow filled herself deep with a quiet abundant vitality.\r\n"Where have _you_ been," I wondered.\r\n\r\nThere came a loud blast from the harbor. At once I saw her turn in her\r\nchair and look down to the point below where a river boat was just\r\nleaving her slip, sweeping silently out of the darkness into the moonlit\r\nwater. My curiosity deepened. Where _had_ she been, and what was she\r\ndoing, what queer kind of a girl was this? I took a seat beside her.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you remember me?" I asked. She turned her head with a quiet\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Of course I do," she answered. Her low voice had a frankly intimate\r\ntone. "I did the moment I saw you. Besides, Sue told me about you."\r\n\r\n"She\'s been telling me quite a lot about _you_."\r\n\r\n"Has she? What?"\r\n\r\n"That you know all about the harbor these days."\r\n\r\n"Sue\'s wonderful," Eleanore murmured. "She\'s so sure her friends know\r\neverything."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s stick to the harbor."\r\n\r\n"All right, let\'s. I know enough about it to like it. Sue says you know\r\nenough to hate it. I wonder which of us knows more."\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"How do you know you do?"\r\n\r\n"Because I\'ve been here longer," I said. "I\'ve hated it for twenty odd\r\nyears."\r\n\r\nShe looked at me with interest. Her eyes were not at all like Sue\'s.\r\nSue\'s eyes were always wrapped up in herself; Eleanore\'s in somebody\r\nelse. They were as intimate as her voice.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you remember the evening when you took me down to the docks?" she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"I do--very well," I said.\r\n\r\n"And do you mean to tell me you didn\'t like the harbor then?"\r\n\r\n"I do--I hated the harbor then. I was scared to death that Sam and his\r\ngang would appear around the end of a car."\r\n\r\n"Who was Sam?" she asked me. "He sounds like a very dreadful small boy."\r\n\r\nSoon she had me telling her of Sam and his gang and the harbor of\r\nthrills, from the time of old Belle and the Condor.\r\n\r\n"I was a toy piano," I said. "And the harbor was a giant who played on\r\nme till I rattled inside. We had a big spree together."\r\n\r\n"Not a very healthy spree, was it?" she said quietly, turning her\r\ngray-blue eyes on mine. For some reason we suddenly smiled at each\r\nother. "You\'re a good deal like your father--aren\'t you?" she said. "The\r\nsame nice twinkle in your eyes. Please go on. What did the harbor do to\r\nyou next?"\r\n\r\nI thought all at once of the August day when she had lain, a girl of\r\ntwelve, in the fragrant meadow beside me. And as then, so now, the\r\ndrunken woman\'s image rose for an instant in my mind.\r\n\r\n"It wiped the thrills all out," I said abruptly. I told how the place\r\ngrew harsh and bare, how I could always feel it there stripping\r\neverything naked like itself, and how finally when later in Paris I felt\r\nI had shaken it off for life, it had now suddenly jerked me back, let me\r\nsee what my father had really been, and had then repeated its same old\r\ntrick, closing in on his great idea and making it look like an old man\'s\r\nhobby, crowding him out and handing us grimly two dull little jobs--one\r\nto live on and one to die on.\r\n\r\n"It\'s getting monotonous," I ended.\r\n\r\nWhile I talked she had been watching it, now a bustling ferry crossing,\r\nnow a tug with a string of barges working up against the tide.\r\n\r\n"How do you know it\'s so bad for you to be brought back from Paris?" she\r\nasked me, without looking around.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever been in Paris?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--and I want to go again. But I don\'t believe it will ever feel as\r\nreal to me as this place does. And I shouldn\'t think it would to you.\r\nBecause you were born here, weren\'t you--and you\'ve been so close to it\r\nmost of the time that you\'re all mixed into it, aren\'t you? I mean\r\nyou\'ve got your roots here. Why don\'t you write about _them_ for a\r\nwhile?"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Your roots."\r\n\r\nShe turned and again her eyes met mine, and again for some reason or\r\nother we smiled.\r\n\r\n"All right," I assented gravely, "I\'ll buy a hoe and start right in."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, hoe yourself all up. Get as far down as you can remember.\r\nDig up Belle and Sam, and Sue and your mother and father. Then take a\r\nhoe to Paris and find out why you loved it so, and why you hate the\r\nharbor. Be sure you get all the hate there is, it makes such interesting\r\nreading. Besides, it may be just what you need--it may take the hate all\r\nout of your system."\r\n\r\n"Who\'ll print it?" I demanded.\r\n\r\n"Oh, some magazine," she said.\r\n\r\n"Do you think this kind of thing would interest their readers?"\r\n\r\n"It would interest _me_----"\r\n\r\n"Thank you. I\'ll tell the editors that."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll do no such thing," she said severely. "You\'ll tell the magazine\r\neditors, please, that I\'m only one of thousands of girls who are\r\ngetting sick and tired of the happy, cheery little tales they print for\r\nour special benefit. It\'s just about time they got over the habit of\r\nthinking of us as sweet, young things and gave us some roots we can grow\r\non."\r\n\r\nAnother modern girl, I thought.\r\n\r\n"Do you, too, want to vote?" I asked her, with a fine, indulgent irony.\r\n\r\n"Some day I do," she answered. And then she added with placid scorn,\r\n"When I\'ve learned all the political wisdom that _you_ have to teach\r\nme." And as if that were a good place to stop, she rose from her seat.\r\n\r\n"The others seem to have left us," she said. "I think I\'d better be\r\ngoing home."\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute, please," I cried. "When am I going to hear about\r\nyou--and your side of this dismal body of water?"\r\n\r\nShe looked back at me serenely.\r\n\r\n"Wait till you\'ve got yours all written down," she replied. "You see\r\nmine might only mix you up. Mine is so much pleasanter. Good night," she\r\nadded softly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil late that night, and again the next day at my desk down in the\r\nwarehouse, my thoughts kept drifting back to our talk. With a glow of\r\nsurprise I found I remembered not only every word she had said, but the\r\ntones of her voice as she said it, the changing expressions on her face\r\nand in her smiling gray-blue eyes. Her picture rose so vividly at times\r\nit was uncanny.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of her?" asked Sue.\r\n\r\n"Mighty little," I replied. I did not care to discuss her with Sue, for\r\nI had not liked Sue\'s tone at all.\r\n\r\nBut how little I\'d learned about Eleanor\'s life. Where did she live? I\r\ndidn\'t know. When I had hinted at coming to see her she had smilingly\r\nput me off. What was this pleasant harbor of hers? "Wait till you\'ve got\r\nyours all written down," she had said, and had told me nothing whatever.\r\nYes, I thought disgustedly, I was quite a smart young man. Here I had\r\nspent two years in Paris learning how to draw people out. What had she\r\nlet me draw out of her? What hadn\'t I let her draw out of me? I wondered\r\nhow much I had told that girl.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, in the next few days, my thoughts drifted about with\r\nastonishing ease and made prodigious journeys. I roved far back to my\r\nchildhood, and there the most tempting incidents rose, and solemn little\r\nthoughts and terrors, hopes and plans, some I was proud of, some mighty\r\nashamed of. Roots, roots, up they came, as though they\'d just been\r\nwaiting, down there deep inside of me, for that girl and her hoeing.\r\n\r\nPresently, just to get rid of them all, I began writing some of them\r\ndown. And again I was surprised to find that I was in fine writing\r\ntrim. The words seemed to come of themselves from my pen and line\r\nthemselves up triumphantly into scenes of amazing vividness. At least so\r\nthey looked to me. How good it felt to be at it again. Often up in my\r\nroom at night I kept on working till nearly dawn. I was getting on\r\nfamously now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so now, as was his habit, Joe Kramer came crashing into my life and\r\nas usual put a stop to my work.\r\n\r\nHaving just landed from Russia, he had "breezed over" to our house, had\r\nhad a talk with Sue downstairs and had then come up to my room to\r\nsurprise me--just as I had a good firm grip on one of my most entrancing\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Bill," he cried. "What are you up to?"\r\n\r\n"Hello, J. K. How are you?"\r\n\r\nI knew that I ought to be genial, and for a few moments I did my best. I\r\nwent through all the motions. I grabbed his hand, I smiled, I talked, I\r\ntold him I was tickled to death, I even tried pounding him on the back.\r\nBut it was quite useless.\r\n\r\n"Kid," he said with that grin of his, "you\'re up to something idealistic\r\nand don\'t want to be disturbed. But I\'m here and it can\'t be helped. So\r\nout with it--what have you gone and done?"\r\n\r\nAnd he jerked my story out of me.\r\n\r\n"All right," he declared, "this has got to stop!"\r\n\r\n"I knew it," I said. I had known it the minute he came in the room.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to throw up your ten-dollar job, quit working all night on\r\nstuff that won\'t sell, and come on a paper and make some real money."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do it," I snapped.\r\n\r\n"You can," said J. K.\r\n\r\n"But I tell you I tried! I went to a paper----"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll go to a dozen before I get through!"\r\n\r\n"J. K.--I won\'t do it"\r\n\r\n"Kid--you will!"\r\n\r\nAnd he kept at me night after night. He was working for a New York paper\r\nnow as a special correspondent. He had a talk with his editor and got me\r\na chance to go on as a "cub" and write about weddings, describing the\r\ncostume of the bride. At least it was a starter, he said, and would lead\r\nto divorces later on, and from there I might be promoted to graft. He\r\ntalked to Sue and my father about it, persuading them both to take his\r\nside. Day by day the pressure increased. I set my young jaw doggedly and\r\nkept on writing about my roots.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Joe one evening. "Your sister tells me you\'re sore on\r\nthe harbor. Then have a look at this." And he showed me a newspaper\r\nclipping headed, "Padrone System Under the Dumps."\r\n\r\n"Well, what about it?" I asked him.\r\n\r\n"What about it? My God! Here\'s a chance to show up the harbor on one of\r\nits ugliest, rottenest ideas! A dump is a pier that sticks out in the\r\nriver. We\'ll go there at night, get down underneath it and look at the\r\nkids--Dago child-slaves working like hell. You say that weddings are not\r\nin your line--all right, here\'s just the opposite--stuff that\'ll make\r\nyour women readers sit right up and sob out aloud! I don\'t care for\r\ntear-jerkers myself," he added. "But even tear-jerkers are better than\r\nArt."\r\n\r\n"All right," I muttered savagely, "let\'s go and get a tear-jerker to\r\nwrite!"\r\n\r\nIf I must write of this modern harbor, at least it was some satisfaction\r\nto write about one of its ugliest sides.\r\n\r\nWe went the next night.\r\n\r\nJoe had chosen a dump which jutted out from the Manhattan side of the\r\nriver just about opposite our house. A huge, long, shadowy pile of city\r\nrefuse of all kinds, we caught the sour breath of it as we drew near in\r\nthe darkness. There was not a sound nor a light. We climbed down onto a\r\ngreenish beam that ran along by the side underneath, about a foot from\r\nthe water, and cautiously working our way outward for a hundred yards\r\nor more, we stopped abruptly and drew back.\r\n\r\nFor just before us under the dump was a cave with walls of papers and\r\nrags. A lantern hung from overhead, swung gently in the raw salt breeze,\r\nand by its light we could see a half dozen swarthy small boys. Five were\r\nintent on a game of dice, whispering fiercely while they played. Their\r\nboss lay asleep in a corner. The sixth, the smallest of them all, sat\r\nsmoking in the mouth of the cave, his knees drawn up and his big dilated\r\nblack eyes roving hungrily out over the water. All at once around the\r\nend of the pier, a dark, tall shadow like a spook swept silently out\r\nbefore him. He sprang back and fervently crossed himself, then grinned\r\nand drew on his cigarette hard. For the shadow was only a scow with a\r\nderrick. The imp continued his watching.\r\n\r\n"Now," said J. K. a few minutes later back on shore, "you want to get\r\ntheir hours and wages. You want to look up the fire law about lighted\r\ncigarettes and a lantern----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, damn your fire law," I growled. "I want to know where that kid with\r\nthe cigarette was born, and what he thinks of the harbor!" Joe gave me\r\none of his cheerful grins.\r\n\r\n"You might get his views on the tariff," he said.\r\n\r\n"Look here, J. K.," I implored him; "go home. Go on home and leave me\r\nalone. It\'s all right, I\'m glad you brought me here--darned good of you,\r\nand I\'ll get a story. Only for God\'s sake leave me alone!"\r\n\r\n"Sure," said Joe. "Only don\'t try to talk to those little Guineys. Their\r\nboss wouldn\'t let \'em say a word and you\'d lose your chance of watching\r\n\'em. Make it a kind of a mystery story."\r\n\r\nAnd a mystery story I made it.\r\n\r\nWhere had he been a year ago, this imp who had fervently crossed\r\nhimself? In Naples, Rome or Venice, or poking his toes into the dust of\r\na street in some dull little town in the hills? What great condor of\r\nto-day had picked him up and dropped him here? How did it look to him?\r\nWhat did he feel?\r\n\r\nI came back to the dump night after night, and writing blindly in the\r\ndark I tried to jot down what he saw--gigantic shapes and shadows, some\r\nmotionless, some rushing by with their dim spectral little lights, and\r\nover all the great arch of the Bridge rearing over half the sky. The\r\nlantern in the cave behind threw a patch of light on the water below,\r\nand across that patch from under the pier where the water was slapping,\r\nslapping, there came an endless bobbing procession--a whisky bottle, a\r\nbroken toy horse, a bit of a letter, a pink satin slipper, a dirty white\r\nglove--things tossed out of people\'s lives. On and on they came. And I\r\nknew there were miles of black water like this all covered with tiny\r\nprocessions like this moving slowly out with the ebb tide, out from the\r\nturbulent city toward the silent ocean. One night the watchman on the\r\ndump showed me a heavy paper bag with what would have been a baby\r\ninside. Where had it come from? He didn\'t know. Tossed out of some\r\nwoman\'s life, in a day it would be far out on the ocean, bobbing,\r\nbobbing with the rest. Water from here to Naples, water from here to\r\nheathen lands. Just here a patch of light from a lantern. That imp from\r\nItaly looking down--into something immense and dark and unknown.\r\n\r\nHe was having a spree with the harbor, as I had had when as small as he.\r\nI saw him watch the older boys and listen thrilled to their wonderful\r\ntalk--as once I, too, had been thrilled by Sam. I watched him over a\r\ngame of dice, quarreling, scowling, grabbing at pennies, slapped by some\r\none, whimpering, then eagerly getting back to the game. It was "craps,"\r\nI had played it with Sam and the gang. One night he dropped a cigarette\r\nstill lighted into the rags and was given a blow by his boss that\r\nknocked him into a corner. But presently he crawled cautiously forth,\r\nand again with both hands hugging his knees he sat and watched the\r\nharbor. What a big spree for a little boy.\r\n\r\nI put my own childhood into this imp, into him my first feelings toward\r\nthis place. And so I came again to my roots. How the memories rose up\r\nnow--the fascinations and terrors that I, too, had felt before something\r\nimmense and dark and unknown.\r\n\r\nThank heaven J. K. had given me up and gone to Colorado--so I was left\r\nto work in peace. I called my sketch "A Patch of Light," and sent it to\r\na magazine. It came back with a note explaining that, while this was a\r\nfine little thing in its way, its way wasn\'t theirs, it was neither an\r\narticle full of facts nor a story full of romance. In short, I told\r\nmyself savagely, it was neither hay nor tears! Again it went forth and\r\nagain back it came. Then Sue gave it to one of her writer friends who\r\nsaid he knew just the place for it.\r\n\r\n"No, you don\'t," I thought drearily. "Nobody knows--in this whole\r\ndamnable desolate land."\r\n\r\nBut Sue\'s friend sold my story--for twenty-two dollars and fifty cents!\r\nAnd he said that the editor wanted some more!\r\n\r\nIt was curious, from my window that night, what a different harbor I saw\r\nbelow. Ugly still? Of course it was. But what a _rich mine_ of ugliness\r\nfor the pen of a rising young author like me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nNow for something bigger. I would have a whack at the place by day. No\r\nmystery now, just ugliness. I would show it up in broad daylight,\r\nbringing out every detail in the glare. I would do this by comparing it\r\nto the harbor of long ago, and the snowy white sails of my father\'s\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nHis youth was gone. A thick-set and gray-headed old figure, he bent over\r\nhis desk by my side, putting up a fierce, silent fight for his strength,\r\nand now slowly getting enough of it back to keep him at his job as a\r\nclerk in what had been his warehouse. Only once, coming suddenly into\r\nthe room, I found him settled deep down in his chair, heavy, inert, his\r\ncigar gone out, staring vacantly out of the window.\r\n\r\nThe sails were gone. Down there at his dock, where even in days that I\r\ncould remember the tall clippers had lain for weeks, I saw now a German\r\nwhaleback. She had slipped in but three days before and was already\r\nsnorting to get away. She was black and she wallowed deep, and she had\r\nan enormous bulging belly into which I descended one day and explored\r\nits metallic compartments that echoed to the deafening din of some\r\nriveters at work on her sides. Though short and stout, she was nine\r\nthousand tons. Hideous, she was practical, as practical as a factory. In\r\nher the romance of the sea was buried and choked in smoke and steam, in\r\ngrime, dirt, noise and a regular haste. One morning as her din increased\r\nand the black, sooty breath of her came drifting in through our window,\r\nmy father rose abruptly and slammed the window down.\r\n\r\n"The damn sea hog!" he muttered.\r\n\r\nGone, too, were the American sailors. All races of men on the earth but\r\nours seemed gathered around this hog of the sea. From barges filled with\r\nher cargo, the stuff was being heaved up on the dock by a lot of Irish\r\nbargemen. Italian dockers rolled it across to this German ship, and on\r\ndeck a Jap under-officer was bossing a Coolie crew. These Coolies were\r\ndwarfs with big white teeth and stooping, round little shoulders. They\r\nhad strange, nervous faces, long and narrow with high cheek bones and no\r\nforeheads at all to speak of. Their black eyes gleamed. Back and forth\r\nthey scurried to the sound of that guttural Japanese voice.\r\n\r\n"The cheapest sea labor there is," growled Dad. "Good-by to Yankee\r\nsailors."\r\n\r\nThe Old East with its riches was no longer here. For what were these\r\nCoolies doing? Handling silks and spices? Oh, no. They were hoisting and\r\nletting down into the hold an automobile from Dayton, Ohio, bound for\r\nNew South Wales. Gone were the figs and almonds, the indigo, ivory,\r\ntortoise shells. Into the brand-new ledgers over which my father worked,\r\nhe was entering such items as barbed wire, boilers, car wheels and gas\r\nengines, baby carriages, kegs of paint. I reveled in the commonplace\r\nstuff, contrasting it vividly in my mind with the starlit ocean roads it\r\nwould travel, the picturesque places it would help spoil.\r\n\r\nI filled in the scene with all its details, the more accurate, glaring\r\nand real the better--the brand-new towering skyline risen of late on\r\nManhattan, the new steel bridge, an ugly one this, and all the modern\r\nsteam craft, tugs, river boats, Sound steamers, each one of them panting\r\nand spewing up smoke. I sat there like a stenographer and took down the\r\nharbor\'s dictation, noting the rasping tones of its voice, recording\r\neagerly all its smells. And all this and more that I gathered, I\r\nfocussed on the sea hog.\r\n\r\nAnd then toward the end of a winter\'s day we looked out of our window\r\nand saw her "sail." She sailed in a nervous, worrying haste to the\r\ngrunts and shrieks of a lot of steam winches. Up rattled her anchor, out\r\nshe waddled, tugs puffing their smoke and steam in her face. She didn\'t\r\ndepart. Who ever heard of a hog departing? She just went. There were no\r\nsongs, no last good-byes--except from a man in his shirt sleeves who\r\ncalled from the deck to a man on the pier, "So long, Mac, see you next\r\nSpring," and then went into the factory.\r\n\r\nWhen the work of the day was over, I went down into the dock shed. My\r\nfather\'s old place was at peace for a time, the desecration done with.\r\nShe was empty, dark and silent. In her long, inward-sloping walls the\r\neight wide sliding doors were closed. Only through the dusty skylights\r\nhere and there fell great masses of soft light. Big bunches of canvas\r\nhung from above, ropes dangled out of the shadows. And there were huge\r\nrhythmic creakings that made you feel the ocean still here, an old ocean\r\nunder an old, old dock. The place grew creepy with its past.\r\n\r\n"Faint, spicy odors," I jotted down, as I stood there in the dimness,\r\n"ghosts of long ago--low echoes of old chanties sung by Yankee\r\nsailors--romance--mystery----"\r\n\r\nI broke off writing and drew back behind a crate. My father had entered\r\nthe dock shed and was coming slowly up the dock. Presently I saw him\r\nstop and look into the shadows around him. I saw a frown come on his\r\nface, I saw his features tighten. So he stood for some moments. Then he\r\nturned and walked quickly out. A lump had risen in my throat, for I\r\nthought I knew what he had seen.\r\n\r\n"The Phantom Ship" became my title. A fine contrast to the sea hog, I\r\nthought. I asked Dad endless questions at night about the old days not\r\nonly here, but all up along the coast of New England, and hungrily I\r\nlistened while he glorified the rich life and color of those seaport\r\ntowns now gray, those wharves now rotting and covered with moss. He\r\nglorified the spacious homes of the men who had ordered their captains\r\nto search the Far East for the rugs and the curtains, the chairs and the\r\ntables, the dishes, the vase, the silks and the laces, the silver and\r\ngold and precious stones with which those audacious old houses were\r\nstored. He glorified the ships themselves. From the quarter decks of our\r\nclippers, those marvels of cleanliness and speed, he told how those\r\nmiraculous captains had issued their orders to Yankee sailors, brawny,\r\ndeep-chested, keen-eyed and strong-limbed. He told what perils they had\r\nfaced far out on the Atlantic--"the Roaring Forties" those waters were\r\ncalled!\r\n\r\n"Yes, boy, in those days ships had men!"\r\n\r\nIn my room I eagerly wrote it all down and added what I myself could\r\nremember. Here from my bedroom window I tried to see what I had seen as\r\na boy, the immaculate white of the tall sails, the fresh blue and green\r\nof the dancing waves. Oh, I was romancing finely those nights! And there\r\ncame no Blessed Damozel to say to me gruffly, "Couches-toi. Il est\r\ntard."\r\n\r\nWhen the sketch was completed at last I gave it to my father to read and\r\nthen went out for a long walk. It was nearly midnight when I returned,\r\nbut he was still reading. He cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n"Son," he said very huskily, "this is a strong piece of work!" His eyes\r\nwere moist as they moved rapidly down the page. He looked up with a\r\njerk. "Who\'ll print it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew, Dad----"\r\n\r\nI mailed it that night to a magazine. In the next two weeks my father\'s\r\nsuspense was even deeper than my own, though he tried hard to joke about\r\nit, calling me "Pendennis." One day in his office chair he wheeled with\r\na nervous sharpness, and I could feel his eyes fixed on the envelope\r\nwhich the postman had just thrown on my desk. God help me, it was heavy\r\nand long, it had my manuscript inside. Dismally I searched for a letter.\r\nStill I could feel those anxious eyes.\r\n\r\n"Hold on!" I cried. "They\'ve taken it! All they want me to do is to cut\r\nit down!"\r\n\r\n"Then do it!" My radiant father snarled. "It ought to be cut to half its\r\nlength! That\'s the way with beginners, a mass of details! Some day maybe\r\nyou\'ll learn to write!"\r\n\r\nI smiled happily back. He came suddenly over and gripped my hand.\r\n\r\n"My boy, I\'m glad, I\'m very glad! I\'m"--he cleared his throat and went\r\nback to his desk and tried to scowl over what he was doing.\r\n\r\n"Dad."\r\n\r\n"Huh?"\r\n\r\n"They say they\'ll give me a hundred dollars. Pretty good for one month\'s\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"Huh."\r\n\r\n"And they want me to do some more on the harbor. They say it\'s a new\r\nfield. Never been touched."\r\n\r\n"Then touch it," he said gruffly. "Leave me alone. I\'m busy."\r\n\r\nBut coming in late after luncheon that day, I found him reading the\r\neditor\'s letter.\r\n\r\n"Boy," he said that evening, "you ought to read Thackeray for style, and\r\nWashington Irving, and see what a whippersnapper you are. Work--work! If\r\nyour mother were only alive she could help you!"\r\n\r\nAnd just before bedtime, taking a bottle of beer with my pipe, I caught\r\nhis disapproving eye.\r\n\r\n"Worst thing you can put in your stomach," he growled. He said this\r\nregularly each night, and added, "Why can\'t you keep up your health for\r\nyour work?"\r\n\r\nHis own health had improved astonishingly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the winter air that has done it," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMy work, as my father saw it now, was to write "strong, practical\r\narticles" presenting the respective merits of free ships, ship subsidies\r\nand discriminating tariffs to build up our mercantile marine.\r\n\r\nBut I was growing tired these days of my father\'s idea, his miracle and\r\nhis endless talk of the past. On walks along the waterfront he would\r\ntreat it all like a graveyard. But while he pointed out the tombs I felt\r\nthe swift approach of Spring. It was March, and in a crude way of its\r\nown the harbor was expressing the season--in warm, salty breezes, the\r\nodor of fish and the smell of tar on the bottoms of boats being\r\noverhauled for the Summer. Our Italian dockers sang at their work, and\r\none day the dock was a bright-hued mass of strawberries and early Spring\r\nflowers landed by a boat from the South. Everywhere things seemed\r\nstarting--starting like myself.\r\n\r\nI had given up my warehouse job, and free at last from that tedious desk\r\nto which I once thought I was tied for years, with two sketches sold and\r\nideas for others, so many others, rising daily in my mind, I went about\r\nwatching the life of the port. Poor Dad. He was old. Could I help being\r\nyoung?\r\n\r\nWithout exactly meaning to, I drew away from my father to Sue. We felt\r\nourselves vividly young in that house. We quarreled intensely over her\r\nfriends and were pleased with ourselves in the process. We had long\r\ntalks about ourselves. Sue let me talk to her by the hour about my work\r\nand my ideas, while she sat and thought about her own.\r\n\r\n"If you\'re planning to write up the harbor," she said sleepily late one\r\nnight, "you ought to cruise around a bit in Eleanore Dillon\'s motor\r\nboat."\r\n\r\nI looked at her in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Does that girl run a motor boat?"\r\n\r\n"Her father\'s." Sue yawned and gave me a curious smile. "I\'ll see if I\r\ncan\'t arrange it," she said. And about a week later she told me,\r\n"Eleanore\'s coming to take us out to-night."\r\n\r\nSome of Sue\'s friends came to supper that evening and later we all went\r\ndown to the dock. There was no moon but the stars were out and the night\r\nwas still, the slip was dark and empty. Suddenly with a rush and a swirl\r\na motor boat rounded the end of the pier, turned sharply in and came\r\nshooting toward us. A boiling of water, she seemed to rear back, then\r\ndrifted unconcernedly in to the bottom of the ladder.\r\n\r\nIn the small circle of light down there I saw Eleanore Dillon smiling\r\nup. She sat at her wheel, a trim figure in white--a white Jersey,\r\nsomething red at her throat and a soft white hat crushed a bit to one\r\nside. Beneath it the breeze played tricks with her hair.\r\n\r\nWe scrambled down into the cock-pit. It was a deep, cozy little place,\r\nwith the wide open doors of a cabin in front, in which I caught a\r\nglimpse of two bunks, a table, a tiny electric cooking stove and a\r\nshaded reading light over the one small easy chair. There were impudent\r\ncurtains of blue at the port holes. There was a shelf of books and\r\nanother of blue and white cups and saucers and dishes. And what was\r\nthat? A monkey crouching under the table, paws clutching the two\r\nenormous brass buttons on the gay blue jacket he wore, eyes watching us\r\nangrily as he chattered.\r\n\r\n"Buttons," commanded his mistress, "come out here this minute and stop\r\nyour noise. There\'s nothing for you to be peevish about, the water\'s\r\nlike glass. When it\'s rough," she explained, "he gets fearfully seasick.\r\nCome here now, pass the cigarettes." And this her Buttons proceeded to\r\ndo--very grumpily.\r\n\r\nThen as a small, quiet hand pulled a lever, I felt a leap of power\r\nbeneath me, the boat careened as she turned, then righted, there was a\r\nsecond pull on the lever, another surging leap of speed, and as we\r\nrushed out on the river now up rose her bow higher and higher, a huge\r\nwhite wave on either side. The spray dashed in our faces. Everyone began\r\ntalking excitedly. Only the Buttons kept his monkey eyes fixed anxiously\r\non his captain\'s face while he clasped the pit of his stomach.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Buttons, don\'t be such a coward," she said. "I tell you it\'s smooth\r\nand you won\'t be sick! Go out there and stop being silly!"\r\n\r\nSlowly and with elaborate caution the monkey crept forward over the\r\ncabin. For a moment up at the bow he paused, a ridiculous little\r\ndark-jacketed figure between the two white crests of our waves. Then\r\nwith a spring he was up to his place on the top of the light, and there\r\nwith gay gesticulations he greeted every vessel we passed.\r\n\r\nI had taken a seat by Eleanore\'s side. She was driving her boat with\r\neyes straight ahead. Now and then she would close them, draw in a deep\r\nbreath of the rough salt air, and smile contentedly to herself. After a\r\ntime I heard her voice, low and intimate as before:\r\n\r\n"Finished up that hideous harbor of yours?"\r\n\r\n"No," I answered hungrily, "I think I\'ve just begun." I caught a gleam\r\nin her eyes.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be out of your rut in a moment," she said.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, my rut?" I demanded.\r\n\r\n"The East River, Stupid--wait and see."\r\n\r\nFrom the little East River corner I\'d lived in, we sped far out on the\r\nUpper Bay, a rushing black speck on a dim expanse, with dark, empty\r\nfields of water around us, long, luminous paths stretching off to the\r\nshores, where the lights twinkled low for miles and miles and there were\r\nsudden bursts of flame from distant blast furnace fires.\r\n\r\n"Tell me what you\'ve been writing about this hideous place," she said.\r\n\r\n"Who said it was hideous at night? Of course if you wrap it all up in\r\nthe dark, so that you can see none of its sea hogs----"\r\n\r\n"What\'s a sea hog?"\r\n\r\n"A sea hog is a wallowing boat with a long, black, heavy snout." And\r\nmustering all that was left of my hatred I plunged into my picture. "The\r\nwhole place is like that," I ended. "Full of smoke and dirt and\r\ndisorder, everything rushing and jamming together. That\'s how it looks\r\nto me in the daytime!"\r\n\r\n"Are you sure it does--still?"\r\n\r\n"I am," I answered firmly. "And I\'m going to write it just as it looks."\r\n\r\n"Then look back of you," she suggested.\r\n\r\nBehind us, at the tip of Manhattan, the tall buildings had all melted\r\ntogether into one tremendous mass, with only a pin point of light here\r\nand there, a place of shadowy turrets and walls, like some mediaeval\r\nfortress. Out of it, in contrast to its dimness, rose a garish tower of\r\nlights that seemed to be keeping a vigilant watch over all the dark\r\nwaters, the ships and the docks. The harbor of big companies.\r\n\r\n"My father works up in that tower," she said. "He can see the whole\r\nharbor spread out below. But he keeps coming down to see it all close,\r\nand I\'ve steered him up close to everything in it. You\'ve no idea how\r\nmuch there is." She threw me a glance of pitying scorn. "There are over\r\nseven hundred miles of waterfront in this small port, and I\'m not going\r\nto have you trudging around and getting lost and tired and cross and\r\nworking off your grudge in your writing. You come with me some afternoon\r\nand I\'ll do what I can to open your eyes."\r\n\r\n"Please do it," I said quickly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe took me down, to the sea gate at the end of a warm, still, foggy\r\nday. There in the deepening twilight we drifted without a sign of a\r\nworld around us--till in from the ocean there came a deep billow, then\r\nanother and another, and as our small craft darted off to one side a\r\ngigantic gray shadow loomed through the fog with four black towers of\r\nsmoke overhead, lights gleaming from a thousand eyes.\r\n\r\n"Another sea hog," murmured a voice.\r\n\r\n"I said in the daytime," I replied.\r\n\r\nWe went out on another afternoon to watch the fisherman fleets at their\r\nwork or scudding before a strong wind home with a great, round, radiant\r\nsun behind. She showed me fishers in the air, lonely fish hawks one by\r\none flying in the late afternoon back to their nests on the Atlantic\r\nHighlands. And far out on the Lower Bay she knew where to stir up whole\r\narmies of gulls, till there seemed to be thousands wheeling in air with\r\nthe bright sunshine on all the wings. The sunshine, too, with the help\r\nof the breeze, stole glinting deep into her hair. She watched me out of\r\nhalf-closed eyes.\r\n\r\n"Is this daylight enough?" she demanded.\r\n\r\n"This is simply absurd," I answered. "You know very well that this\r\nharbor is ugly in places----"\r\n\r\n"Only in places. That\'s better," she said.\r\n\r\n"In a great _many_ places," I rejoined. "Please take me to Bayonne some\r\nday--at two p. m.," I added.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a good, safe, unmysterious hour, and as we neared the place\r\nnext day my hopes mounted high, for there was a leaden sky overhead and\r\nloathsome blotches and streaks of oil on the gray water around us--while\r\nahead on the Jersey shore, from two chimneys that rose halfway to the\r\nclouds, poured two foul, sluggish columns of smoke.\r\n\r\n"Still New York harbor, I believe?" I inquired maliciously. But Eleanore\r\nwas smiling. "What\'s the joke?" I demanded.\r\n\r\n"The southwest wind," she softly replied. I could feel it coming as she\r\nspoke. As I watched I saw it take that sky and tear jagged rifts in it\r\nfor the sun, and then as those two columns of smoke began twisting and\r\nwrithing like monster snakes they took on purple and greenish hues and\r\nthrew ghostly reflections of themselves down on the oily water around\r\nus, filled with blue and gold shimmerings now.\r\n\r\n"What a strange, wonderful purple," murmured a quiet voice by my side.\r\n\r\nStubbornly I resisted conversion. I wanted more afternoons in that boat.\r\n\r\n"Now it\'s blowing that oily odor our way," I declared in sudden\r\nannoyance. "I no sooner get to enjoying myself when along comes one of\r\nthe smells of this place. And where\'s the beauty in _them_? Can you show\r\nme? Here\'s a place that should be a great storehouse of pure fresh air\r\nfor the city to breathe, and----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, hush up!" said Eleanore.\r\n\r\nBut I doggedly found other blemishes here--swamps, railroad yards and\r\nsooty tracks that filled the waterfront for miles where there should\r\nhave been parks and boulevards. At the same time I assumed the tone of\r\none who tries to be fair and patient. Whenever she showed me some new\r\nbeauty in water or sky I took great pains to look at it well. When an\r\nangry little squall of wind came ruffling over the sunny waves in\r\nsweeping bands of deep, soft blues, I gazed and gazed at its wonder as\r\nthough I could never have enough. And so gazing I spied floating there a\r\nsodden old mattress, a fleet of tin cans. And I said that it seemed an\r\nunhealthy thing to dump all our refuse so close to the city.\r\n\r\n"They don\'t!" she retorted indignantly. "They take it out miles beyond\r\nthe Hook!"\r\n\r\nIn short, I considered myself mighty clever. Day by day I prolonged my\r\nconversion, holding obstinately back--while Eleanore revealed to me the\r\nmiracles worked by the sunset here, and by the clouds, the winds, the\r\ntides, the very smoke and the ships themselves, all playing weird\r\ntricks on each other. Slowly the crude glory of it stole upon me\r\nunawares--until to my own intense surprise the harbor now became for me\r\na breathing, heaving, gleaming thing filled deep with the rush and the\r\nvigor of life. A thing no longer sinister, crushing down on a man\'s old\r\nage--but strangely deeply stirring.\r\n\r\n"Look out, my friend," I warned myself. "This is no harbor you\'re\r\nfalling in love with."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough at such lucid moments I would sometimes go a-soaring up into\r\nthe most dazzling dreams, more often I would plunge in gloom. For\r\nEleanore\'s dreams and all her thoughts seemed centered on her father.\r\nFrom each corner of that watery world, no matter how far we wandered,\r\nthe high tower from which he looked down on it all would suddenly loom\r\nabove the horizon. Over the dreariest marshes it peeped and into all our\r\ntalk he came. A marsh was a place that he was to transform, oily odors\r\nwere things he would sweep away. For every abuse that I could discover\r\nher father was working out some cure. With a whole corps of engineers\r\ndrafting his dreams into practicable plans, there was no end to the\r\nthings he could do.\r\n\r\n"Here is a girl," I told myself, "so selfishly wrapped up in her father\r\nshe hasn\'t a thought for anyone else. She\'s using me to boom his work,\r\nas she has doubtless used writers before me and will use dozens more\r\nwhen I\'m gone. No doubt she would like to have _dozens of me_ sitting\r\nright here beside her now! It\'s not at all a romantic thought, but think\r\nhow she could use me then!" And I would glower at her.\r\n\r\nBut it is a lonely desolate job to sit and glower at a girl who appears\r\nso placidly unaware of the fact that you are glowering. And slowly\r\nemerging from my gloom I would wonder about this love that was in her.\r\nAt times when she talked she made me feel small. My own love for my\r\nmother, how utterly selfish it had been. Here was a passion so deep and\r\nreal it made her almost forget I was there, asking questions, hungrily\r\nwatching her, trying to learn about her life.\r\n\r\n"While I was in school," she said, in that low deliberate voice of hers,\r\n"my father and I went abroad every summer. We tramped in the Alps for\r\nweeks at a time, keeping way off the beaten paths to watch the work of\r\nthe Swiss engineers. One of them was a woman. We saw the bridge she\'d\r\nbuilt over a gorge, and I became deeply excited. Until then I had never\r\nhad any idea that I could go into my father\'s work. But now I wondered\r\nif I could. That winter in school I really worked. I was dreadfully dull\r\nat mathematics, but I wouldn\'t see it. I made up my mind to go to\r\nCornell for the course on engineering. I worked like a slave for two\r\nyears to get ready and just succeeded in getting in.\r\n\r\n"Then toward the middle of Freshman year I realized that I was becoming\r\na quite absurdly solemn young grind. There were over a hundred girls in\r\ncollege but I had made barely any friends. And so I firmly resolved to\r\nbe gay. I made a regular business of it and worked my way into clubs and\r\ndances, hunting for the girls I liked and scheming to make them like me\r\ntoo. By May I was way behind in my work. I tried to make up, I began\r\ncramming every night until one or two in the morning. And I passed my\r\nexaminations--but that summer I broke down. My father had to drop his\r\nwork and take me abroad for an operation, and by the time we got back he\r\nhad lost nearly six months of his time. I decided that as an engineer I\r\nwas a dismal failure. I\'d much better give my father a chance.\r\n\r\n"So when he took up this work in New York I spent all my time on our new\r\napartment. I loved fussing with it, I shopped like a bee, and this kept\r\nme busy all Autumn. Besides I was going about with Sue. She had managed\r\nme long ago at school and I was glad to let her now, for I was hunting\r\nfor new ideas. But Sue put me on so many committees that by Spring my\r\nnerves were in shreds, and again for weeks I was flat on my back.\r\n\r\n"One evening then--when my father came home and sat down by my\r\nbedside--it came over me all of a sudden--the wonderful quiet strength\r\nin his hand, in the look of his eyes.\r\n\r\n"\'Where have you been?\' I asked him.\r\n\r\n"\'Down on the harbor,\' he told me. Since eight in the morning he\'d been\r\nin a launch exploring it all. I shut my eyes--my wretched eyelids\r\nquivering--and I made him describe the whole day\'s trip while I tried to\r\nsee it all in my mind. Soon I was feeling deliciously quiet. \'I\'m going\r\ndown there too,\' I thought.\r\n\r\n"By the next evening I had the idea for this boat. When I told him he\r\nwas delighted, and we both grew excited over the plans--which he drew by\r\nmy bed, I made him draw dozens. At last it was built and lay at its\r\ndock, and I packed all I needed into a trunk and we came down in a taxi.\r\nIt was a lovely May afternoon and we had a beautiful ride up the Hudson.\r\nAnd from then on through the Summer I hardly went ashore at all, I knew\r\nif I did it would spoil it all.\r\n\r\n"Every night we slept on board in those two cozy little bunks. I learned\r\nto cook here. Soon I was able to run the boat and even to help my father\r\na little. I knew just enough about his work to go places for him and\r\nsave his time. I\'d forgotten I ever had any nerves, for I felt I\r\nbelonged to something now that got way down to the roots of things. Do\r\nyou see what I mean? This harbor isn\'t like a hotel, or an evening gown\r\nor Weber and Fields. I love pretty gowns, and my father and I wouldn\'t\r\nmiss Weber and Fields for worlds. But they\'re all on top, this is down\r\nat the bottom, it\'s one of those deep places that seem to make the world\r\ngo \'round. It\'s right where the ocean bumps into the land. You can get\r\nyour roots here, you can feel you are real.\r\n\r\n"You see what my father is doing is to take this whole harbor and study\r\nit hard--not just the water, the shipping and docks, for when he says\r\n\'the port of New York\' he means all the railroads too--and he\'s\r\nstudying how they all come in and why it is that everything has become\r\nso frightfully snarled. A lot of big shipping men are behind him, and\r\nhe\'s to draw up a plan for it all which they\'re going to give to the\r\ncity to use, to make this port what it\'s got to be, the very first in\r\nthe ocean world. It\'s one of those slow tremendous pieces of work, it\r\nwill take years to carry it out and hundreds of millions of dollars. My\r\nfather thinks there\'s hardly a chance that he\'ll ever live to see it all\r\ndone. I know he will, I\'m sure he will, he\'s the kind of a man who keeps\r\nhimself young. But whether he really sees it or not, or gets any credit,\r\nhe doesn\'t care.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the kind of a person my father is," Eleanore added softly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"My father wants to meet you," she told me toward the end of June, at\r\none of those times when she let the boat drift while we had long\r\nabsorbing talks. "He has read that thing you wrote about the German sea\r\nhog, and he thinks it\'s awfully well done."\r\n\r\n"That\'s good of him," I said gruffly.\r\n\r\nSomehow or other it always makes me uncomfortable when people talk about\r\nmy work. When they criticize I am annoyed and when they praise I am\r\nuneasy. What do they know about it? They spent an hour reading what it\r\ntook me weeks to write. They don\'t know what I _tried_ to do, nor do\r\nthey care, they haven\'t time. I never feel so cut off from people, so\r\nutterly alone in the world, as when some benevolent person says, "I\r\nliked that little story of yours." Instantly I shut up like a clam.\r\n\r\n"I liked it too," said Eleanore.\r\n\r\n"Did you?" I asked delightedly. Far from retiring into my shell, I\r\nwanted at once to open up and make her feel how much I had missed in\r\nthat crude effort. Soon she had me talking about it. And while I talked\r\non eagerly, I tried to guess from her questions whether she\'d read it\r\nmore than once. Finally I guessed she had. And, glancing at her now and\r\nthen, I wondered how much she could ever know about me or I about\r\nher--really know. And the intimacy I saw ahead loomed radiant and\r\nboundless. I strained every nerve to show her myself, to show her the\r\nvery best of myself.\r\n\r\nBut then I heard her ask me,\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t you like to talk to my father?"\r\n\r\nHere was a fine end to it all.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," I answered gloomily. I could see already those engineer\r\neyes moving amusedly down my pages. I could see her watching his face\r\nand getting to feel as he did about me. "What good would it do?" I\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n"What good would it do?" Her sharply offended tone brought me back with\r\na jerk to try to explain.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see what I mean!" I asked eagerly. "Why should a man as busy\r\nas he is waste his time on a kid like me? After all that you\'ve told me\r\nabout him, I feel sometimes as though all the writers on earth don\'t\r\ncount any more, because all the really big things are being done by men\r\nlike your father."\r\n\r\n"That\'s much better," said Eleanore. "Only of course it isn\'t true. If\r\nyou poor little writers want to get big and really count," she went on\r\nserenely, "all you have to do is to write about my father."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll begin the minute you say so," I told her.\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s arranged," said my companion, with an exceedingly comfortable\r\nsigh. "We\'ve taken a cottage up on the Sound for the summer," she\r\ncontinued. "And we\'re moving up to-morrow. Suppose you come up over\r\nSunday."\r\n\r\n"Thanks. I\'d love to," I replied.\r\n\r\n"So she\'s to be away for months," I added dismally to myself. "No more\r\nof these long afternoons."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following Saturday, when I met her boat at an East River dock, at\r\nonce I felt a difference. We were waiting for her father. The moments\r\ndragged and I grew glum, try as I would to be pleasant.\r\n\r\n"Here he is," she said at last.\r\n\r\nTall, rather lank and loosely clothed, Dillon was coming down the pier\r\nin easy leisurely fashion, talking to a man by his side. His face\r\nlighted up when he saw us.\r\n\r\n"Just a minute," he said.\r\n\r\nHis voice was low but it had a peculiar carrying quality. His rugged\r\nface was deeply lined, and I noticed a little gray in his hair. He was\r\nsmiling straight down into the eyes of his companion, a much younger\r\nman, thin and poorly dressed, whose face looked drawn and tired.\r\n\r\n"When I was your age," I heard Dillon remark, "I got into just the same\r\nkind of a snarl." And he began telling about it. A frightfully technical\r\nstory it was, full of engineer slang that was Greek to me, but I saw the\r\nyounger man listen absorbed, his thin lips parting in a smile. I saw him\r\ncome out from under his worries, I saw his chief watching him, pulling\r\nhim out.\r\n\r\n"All right, Jim," he ended. "See what you can do."\r\n\r\n"Say, Chief, just you forget this, will you?" the other said intensely.\r\n"Don\'t give it a thought. It\'s go\'n\' to be done!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s forgotten."\r\n\r\nAnother easy smile at his man, and then Eleanore\'s father turned to us.\r\nI could feel him casually take me in.\r\n\r\n"The thing I liked most in that sketch of yours," he was saying a few\r\nminutes later, when our boat was on her course, "was the way you listed\r\nthat Dutchman\'s cargo. \'One baby carriage--to Lahore.\' A very large\r\npicture in five little words. I can see that Hindu baby now--being\r\nwheeled in its carriage to Crocodile Park and wondering where the devil\r\nthis queer new wagon came from. I\'ve been nosing around these docks for\r\nyears, but I missed that part of \'em right along--that human part--till\r\nyou came along with your neat writer\'s trick. \'One baby carriage--to\r\nLahore.\' You ought to be proud, young man, at your age to have written\r\none sentence so long that it goes half way around the world."\r\n\r\nAs he talked in that half bantering tone I tried to feel cross, but it\r\nwouldn\'t do. That low voice and those gray eyes were not making fun of\r\nme, they were making friends with me, they were so kindly, curious, so\r\nopen and sincere. Soon he had lighted a cigar and was telling Eleanore\r\ngravely just how she ought to run her boat.\r\n\r\n"Why be so busy about it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you be quiet!" she replied, as she sharply spun her wheel. Like an\r\nautomobile in a crowded street our craft was lurching its way in short\r\ndashes in and out of the rush hour traffic. The narrow East River was\r\nblack with boats. Ferries, tugs and steamers seemed to be coming at us\r\nfrom every side. Now with a leap we would be off, then abruptly churning\r\nthe water behind us we would hold back drifting, watching our chance for\r\nanother rush. Eleanore\'s face was glowing now, her hat was off, her neck\r\nwas tense--and her blue-gray eyes, wide open, fixed on the chaos ahead,\r\nwere shining with excitement. Now and then a long curling wisp of her\r\nhair would get in her eyes and savagely she would blow it back. And her\r\nlank quiet father puffed his cigar, with his gray eyes restfully on her.\r\n"The serenity of her," he murmured to me.\r\n\r\n"Oh, now, my dear," he said gently, as we careened to starboard, "_that_\r\nwas a slip. I can\'t say I would have done it like that."\r\n\r\n"Have you ever run a boat in your life?" came back the fierce rejoinder.\r\n\r\n"No," said Dillon calmly, "I can\'t exactly say I have. Still"--he\r\nrelapsed and enjoyed his cigar.\r\n\r\nJust a short time after this, we had the only ugly moment that I had\r\nbeen through in all our rides. A huge Sound steamer was ahead. Dashing\r\nclose along under her port, we came suddenly out before her and met a\r\ntug whose fool of a captain had made a rush to cross her bow. It was one\r\nof those sickening instants when you see nothing at all to do. But\r\nEleanore saw. A quick jerk on her lever, a swift spinning of her wheel,\r\nand with a leap we were right under the steamer\'s bow. It missed our\r\nstern by a foot as it passed and then we were safe on the other side.\r\nShe made a low sound, in a moment her face went deathly white, her eyes\r\nshut and she nearly let go the wheel. But then, her slight form\r\ntightening, slowly opening her eyes she turned toward her father.\r\n\r\n"Now?" he asked very softly. And there passed a look between them.\r\n\r\n"All right," she breathed, and turned back to her wheel. And for some\r\ntime very little was said.\r\n\r\nBut I understood her love for him now. These two were such companions as\r\nI had never seen before. And though I myself felt quite out of it all,\r\nthis did not bother me in the least. For watching her father and feeling\r\nthe abounding reserve of force deep under his quiet, I told myself that\r\nhere was a big man, the first really big one I\'d ever come close to. And\r\nI was so eager to know him and see just what he was like inside, that I\r\nhad no room for myself or his daughter--because I wanted to write him\r\nup. What a weird, curious feeling it is, this passion for writing up\r\npeople you meet.\r\n\r\nOn the remainder of the ride, and at supper that night on the porch of\r\ntheir cottage, a little house perched on a rocky point directly\r\noverlooking the water, I did my best to draw him out, and Eleanore\r\nseemed quite ready to help me. And later, when he went inside to do\r\nsome work, I went on with the same eagerness, obliterating my own small\r\nself, exploring this feeling of hers for him and his dream of a future\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\nSoon she was doing all the talking, her voice growing lower and more\r\nintense as she tried to make me feel all he meant when he said, "It\'s\r\ngoing to be the first port in the world." She told how up in his tower\r\nhe made you see the commerce of this whole mighty world of peace\r\nconverging slowly on this port. She told of the night two years before\r\nwhen he had come home "all shaken and queer" and had said to her\r\nhuskily, "Eleanore, child, at last it\'s sure. There\'s to be a Panama\r\nCanal." Of other nights when he didn\'t come home and at last she went\r\ndown to his office to fetch him and found him at midnight there with his\r\nmen, "all working like mad and gay as larks!"\r\n\r\n"When it comes to millions of dollars for his work," she said, "he\'s so\r\nvery keen that he makes you feel like a little child. But when it\'s\r\nmerely a question of dollars for himself to live on, he\'s a perfect\r\nbaby. He won\'t look at a bill, he always turns them over to me. He won\'t\r\nenter a shop, he won\'t go to a tailor. One ready-made clothing store has\r\nhis measure and twice a year I order his clothes and then have a fight\r\nto get him to wear them. He never knows what he eats except steak. One\r\nnight when we had been having steak six evenings in succession I tried\r\nchicken for a change. At first he didn\'t know what was wrong. Every now\r\nand then he would seem to notice something. \'What\'s the matter with me?\'\r\nI could see he was asking. Then all at once he had it. \'My dear,\' he\r\nsaid, very coaxingly, \'could we have a nice juicy porterhouse steak for\r\nsupper to-morrow evening?\'"\r\n\r\nFrom these and many other details slowly I got the feel of my man.\r\nCloser, more intimate he grew. All the work I had done in Paris,\r\nquestioning, drawing out my friends until I could feel their inner\r\nselves coming out of them into me, was counting now. I had never done so\r\nwell before, I was sliding my questions in just right, very cautiously\r\nturning her memory this way and that on her father\'s life, watching her\r\ngrow more and more unaware of my presence beside her, although now I had\r\nher bending toward me, eagerly, close.\r\n\r\n"And she thinks she\'s doing it all by herself," I thought exultingly.\r\n\r\nBut as there came a pause in our talk, she turned slightly in her seat\r\nand glanced in through the window into the lighted room behind. And\r\ninstantly her expression changed. A swift look of surprise, a puzzled\r\nfrown and a moment of hard thinking--and then with a murmured excuse she\r\nrose and went away quickly into the house. In the meantime I had\r\nfollowed her look. Sitting close by the lamp, in the room inside, Dillon\r\nwas staring straight at this spot where I was invisible in the dark. And\r\nhe looked old--and rigid, as though he\'d been staring like that for some\r\ntime. I caught just a glimpse. Then he heard her step and turned hastily\r\nback to his work. I looked at my watch. It was after twelve.\r\n\r\n"And he never knew it was all about him," I said to myself disgustedly.\r\n"I hope this doesn\'t spoil it all."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut that is precisely what it did. The next morning she was coolly\r\npolite and Dillon determinedly genial. I could feel a silent struggle\r\nbetween them as to what should be done with me. She wanted to get rid of\r\nme, he wanted to keep us together. Gone was all his quiet strength, in\r\nits place was an anxious friendliness. He made me tell him what I was\r\nwriting. He said he was glad that his press agent daughter had taken me\r\n\'round and opened my eyes. And as soon as she got through with me he\r\nhimself would do all he could.\r\n\r\n"I\'m through with him," said Eleanore cheerfully. "I\'ve shown him all I\r\npossibly can. What you need now," she added, turning to me in her old\r\neasy manner, "is to watch the harbor all by yourself and get your own\r\nfeelings about it. You might begin at the North River docks."\r\n\r\nI spent a wretched afternoon. All my plans for my work and my life\r\nassumed the most gray and desolate hues. Eleanore was taking a nap. At\r\nlast she came down and gave me some tea.\r\n\r\n"May I come out and see you now and then?" I asked her very humbly. "It\r\nwould help me so much to talk over my work."\r\n\r\n"No," she answered kindly, "I think you\'d better not."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" I blurted. "What have I done?"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, then looked at me squarely.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve made my absurd young father," she said, "think that he is no\r\nlonger young."\r\n\r\nI lost just a moment in admiration. There wasn\'t one girl in a hundred\r\nwho would have come out with it like that. Then I seized my chance.\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s perfectly idiotic," I cried. "Here\'s a man so big he\'s a\r\ngiant beside me, so full of some queer magnetic force that on the way up\r\nhere in the boat he made me forget that I was there. I forgot that _you_\r\nwere there," I threw in, and I caught just the sign of a gleam in her\r\neyes. "No longer young?" I continued. "That man will be young when you\r\nand I are blinking in our dull old age! He\'s the biggest man I ever met!\r\nAnd I want to know him, I want to know how he thinks and feels, I want\r\nthat more than anything else! And now you come between us!"\r\n\r\n"Are you real?" asked Eleanore. I looked back unflinchingly.\r\n\r\n"Just you try me," I retorted.\r\n\r\n"No," she replied with a quiet smile.\r\n\r\nShe said good-by to me that night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning at seven o\'clock I met her father down at the boat. We\r\nhad a quick swim together and then climbed on board. And the next\r\nminute, with a sober old seaman called "Captain Arty" at the wheel, the\r\nboat was speeding for New York while we dressed and cooked and\r\nbreakfasted.\r\n\r\n"This was Eleanore\'s idea," Dillon said. "It gets me to town by nine\r\no\'clock and takes me back each day at five. So I hardly miss a night at\r\nhome.... Did she ever tell you," he went on, "about the first week she\r\nspent in this boat?"\r\n\r\n"She said it was a wonderful time."\r\n\r\n"It was a nightmare," Dillon said. I looked at him quickly:\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Her fight for her strength. She looked like a ghost--with a stiff upper\r\nlip. She fainted twice. But she wouldn\'t give up. She said she knew she\r\ncould do it if I\'d only let her stick it out. She has quite a will, that\r\ndaughter of mine," he added quietly.\r\n\r\n"You know," he went on, "that idea of hers that you tackle the North\r\nRiver piers isn\'t bad. Why don\'t you put in the whole Summer there,\r\nwatching the big liners? I won\'t ask you to come to my office now, for\r\nour work is still in that early stage where we don\'t want any\r\npublicity." I could feel his casual glance, and I wondered whether he\r\nnoticed my sharp disappointment. "When we are ready," he resumed, "we\'re\r\nsure to be flooded with writers. I hope there\'ll be one man in the lot\r\nwho\'ll stick to the work for a year or more, a man with a kind of a\r\npassion in him for the thing we\'re trying to do. There\'s nothing we\r\nwouldn\'t do for that man. I hope he\'s going to be you."\r\n\r\nAt once a vision opened of work with Eleanore\'s father, of long talks\r\nwith Eleanore.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try to get ready for it," I said.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve made a fine start," he continued, "and I think you\'re going to\r\nmake good. But first let\'s see what you\'ll do by yourself. Get your own\r\nview of this place as it is to-day before we talk about plans for\r\nto-morrow. And don\'t hurry. Take your time."\r\n\r\nAs he said this quietly, I suddenly awoke to the fact that we were\r\ntearing down the river at a perfectly gorgeous speed. The river was\r\ncrowding with traffic ahead, all was a rushing chaos of life and we were\r\nrushing worst of all. And yet we did not seem to hurry. Old Captain Arty\r\nsat at the wheel with the most resigned patient look in his eyes. And\r\ndrawing lazily on his cigar Dillon was watching a new line of wharves.\r\n\r\n"You know I\'ve found," he was saying, "the only way to live in this age\r\nand get any pleasure out of life is to always take more time than you\r\nneed for every job you tackle. I\'m taking at least seven years to this\r\njob. I might possibly do it as well in five, but I\'d miss half the fun\r\nof it all, I\'d be glaring at separate parts of it, each one as it came\r\nalong, and I\'d never have time to see it full size and let it carry me\r\n\'round the world--to that baby carriage, for instance, over in Lahore."\r\n\r\nWe were rounding the Battery now. And in that sparkling morning light,\r\nwith billowy waves of sea green all around us, sudden snowy clouds of\r\nspray, we watched for a moment the skyscraper group, the homes of the\r\nBig Companies. The sunshine was reflected from thousands of dazzling\r\nwindow eyes, little streamers of steam were flung out gaily overhead,\r\nstreets suddenly opened to our view, narrow cuts revealing the depths\r\nbelow. And there came to our ears a deep humming.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the brains of it all," said Dillon. "In all you\'ll see while\r\nexploring the wharves you\'ll find some string that leads back here. And\r\nyou don\'t want to let that worry you. Let the muckrakers worry and plan\r\nall they please for a sea-gate and a nation that\'s to run with its\r\nbrains removed. You want to remember it can\'t be done. You want to look\r\nharder and harder--until you find out for yourself that there are men up\r\nthere on Wall Street without whose brains no big thing can be done in\r\nthis country. I\'m working under their orders and some day I hope you\'ll\r\nbe doing the same. For they don\'t need _less_ publicity but _more_."\r\n\r\nHe left me at the Battery, and as I stood looking after him I found\r\nmyself feeling somewhat dazed. A question flashed into my mind. What\r\nwould Joe Kramer say to this? I remembered what he had said to me once:\r\n"Tell Wall Street to get off the roof." Well, that was _his_ view. Here\r\nwas another. And this man was certainly just as sincere and decidedly\r\nmore wise and sane, altogether a larger size.\r\n\r\nBesides, I was in love with his daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Manhattan side of the North River, from Twenty-third Street down\r\nfor a mile there stretches a deafening region of cobblestones and\r\nasphalt over which trucks by thousands go clattering each day. There are\r\nlong lines of freight cars here and snorting locomotives. Along the\r\nshore side are many saloons, a few cheap decent little hotels and some\r\nthat are far from decent. And along the water side is a solid line of\r\ndocksheds. Their front is one unbroken wall of sheet iron and concrete.\r\n\r\nI came up against this wall. Over the top I could see here and there the\r\ngreat round funnels of the ships, but at every passenger doorway and at\r\nevery wide freight entrance I found a sign, "No Visitors Admitted," and\r\nunder the sign a watchman who would ungraciously take a cigar and then\r\ngo right on being a watchman. There seemed no way to get inside. The\r\nold-fashioned mystery of the sea was replaced by the inscrutability of\r\nwhat some muckrakers called "The Pool."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t hurry," Eleanore\'s father had said. All very well, but I needed\r\nmoney. While I had been making with Eleanore those long and delightful\r\nexplorations of the harbor and ourselves, at home my father\'s bank\r\naccount had been steadily dwindling, and all that I had been able to\r\nmake had gone into expenses.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what to do," said Sue, alone with me that evening. "The\r\nbutcher says he won\'t wait any longer. He has simply got to be paid this\r\nweek."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see what I can do," I said.\r\n\r\nI came back to my new hunting ground and all night long I prowled\r\nabout. I sipped large schooners of beer at bars, listening to the burly\r\ndockers crowded close around me. I watched the waterfront, empty and\r\nstill, with acres of spectral wagons and trucks and here and there a\r\nlantern. I had a long talk with a broken old bum who lay on his back in\r\nan empty truck looking up at the stars and spun me yarns of his life as\r\na cook on ships all up and down the world. Now and again in the small\r\nwee hours I met hurrying groups of men, women and children poorly clad,\r\nand following them to one of the piers I heard the sleepy watchman\r\ngrowl, "Steerage passengers over there." I saw the dawn break slowly and\r\neverything around me grow bluish and unreal. I watched the teamsters\r\ncome tramping along leading horses, and harness them to the trucks. I\r\nheard the first clatter of the day. I saw the figures of dockers appear,\r\nmore and more, I saw some of them drift to the docks. Soon there were\r\ncrowds of thousands, and as stevedores there began bawling out names,\r\ngang after gang of men stepped forward, until at last the chosen throngs\r\nwent marching in past the timekeepers. Hungrily I peered after them up\r\nthe long cavernous docksheds. "No Visitors Admitted."\r\n\r\nThen I went into a lunchroom for ham and eggs and a huge cup of coffee.\r\nI ate an enormous breakfast. On the floor beside me a cross and weary\r\nlooking old woman was scrubbing the dirty oil cloth there. But I myself\r\nfelt no weariness. While all was still vivid and fresh in my mind,\r\nsitting there I wrote down what I had seen. A magazine editor said it\r\nwould do. And so we paid the butcher.\r\n\r\nThe same editor gave me a sweeping letter of introduction to all ocean\r\nliners. This I showed to a dock watchman, who directed me upstairs. In\r\nthe office above I showed it to a clerk, who directed me to the dock\r\nsuperintendent, who read it and told me to go downtown. I recalled what\r\nDillon had said about strings. Here was string number one, I reflected,\r\nand I followed it down Manhattan into the tall buildings, only to be\r\nasked down there just what it was I wanted to know.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to know anything," I replied. "I just want permission to\r\nwatch the work."\r\n\r\n"We can\'t allow that," was the answer of this harbor of big companies.\r\n\r\nAt every pier that I approached I received about the same reply. At home\r\nSue spoke of other bills. And now that I was in trouble, hard pressed\r\nfor money and groping my way about alone, I found myself missing\r\nEleanore to a most desperate degree. Her face, her smiling blue-gray\r\neyes, kept rising in my mind, sometimes with memories and hopes that\r\npermeated my whole view both of the harbor and my work with a warm glad\r\nexpectant glow, but more often with no feeling at all but one of\r\nsickening emptiness. She was not here. The only way to get back to her\r\nwas to make good with her father. And so I would not ask his aid or even\r\ngo to him for advice. Testing me, was he? All right, I would show him.\r\n\r\nAnd I returned to my editor, whom my intensity rather amused.\r\n\r\n"The joke of it is," he said, "that they think down there you\'re a\r\nmuckraker."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be one soon if this keeps on."\r\n\r\n"But it won\'t," he replied. "As soon as you\'ve once broken in, and they\r\nsee it\'s a glory story you want, you can\'t imagine how nice they\'ll be."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t broken in," I said.\r\n\r\n"You will to-morrow," he told me, "because Abner Bell will be with you.\r\nHe\'s our star photographer. Wait till you see little Ab go to work. The\r\nplace he can\'t get into hasn\'t been invented. Besides," the editor\r\nadded, "Abner is just the sort of chap to take hold of an author from\r\nParis and turn him into a writer."\r\n\r\nAnd this Abner Bell proceeded to do. He was a cheerful, rotund little\r\nman with round simple eyes and a smile that went all over his face.\r\n\r\n"You see," he said, when I met him the next day down at the docks, "you\r\ncan\'t ask a harbor to hold up her chin and look into your camera while\r\nyou count. She\'s such a big fat noisy slob she wouldn\'t even hear you.\r\nYou\'ve got to run right at her and bark."\r\n\r\n"Look here, old man," he was asking a watchman a few moments later.\r\n"What\'s the name of the superintendent on the next pier down the line!"\r\n\r\n"Captain Townes."\r\n\r\n"Townes, Townes? Is that Bill Townes?"\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s Ed."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what\'s become of Bill. All right, brother, much obliged. See\r\nyou again." And he went on.\r\n\r\n"Say," he asked the next watchman. "Is Eddy--I mean Captain--Townes\r\nupstairs?"\r\n\r\n"Sure he is. Go right up."\r\n\r\n"Thank you." Up we went to the office. "Captain Townes? Good-morning."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, what can I do for you?" The captain was an Englishman with a\r\nvoice as heavy and deep as his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Why, Captain, I\'m sent here by the firm that\'s putting Peevey\'s Paris\r\nPerfume on the market out in the Middle West. They\'re going in heavy on\r\nads this Fall and I\'ve got an order to hang around here until I can get\r\na photo of one of your biggest liners. The idea is to run it as an ad,\r\nwith a caption under it something like this: \'_The Kaiser Wilhelm_\r\nreaching New York with twenty thousand bottles of Peevey\'s Best, direct\r\nfrom Paris.\'"\r\n\r\n"_The Kaiser Wilhelm_," said the captain ponderously, "is a German boat.\r\nShe docks in Hoboken, my friend."\r\n\r\n"Of course she does," said Abner. "And I can lug this heavy camera way\r\nover there if you say so, and hand ten thousand dollars worth of free\r\nads to a German line, stick up pictures of their boat in little\r\ndrugstore windows all up and down the Middle West. Do you know how to\r\ntell me to go away?"\r\n\r\nCaptain Townes smiled heavily.\r\n\r\n"No," he said, "I guess I don\'t. Here\'s a pass that\'ll give you the run\r\nof the dock."\r\n\r\n"Make it two," said Abner, "and fix it so my friend and I can stick\r\naround for quite a while."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a pretty good liar," I told him as we went downstairs.\r\n\r\n"Oh, hell," he answered modestly. "Let\'s go out on the porch and get\r\ncool."\r\n\r\nWe went out on the open end of the pier and sat down on a wooden beam\r\nwhich Abner called a bulkhead.\r\n\r\n"If we don\'t begin calling things names," he remarked, "we\'ll never get\r\nto feeling we\'re here. Let\'s just sit and feel for a while."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve begun," I replied.\r\n\r\nWe sat in the shade of two wooden piles with the glare of a midsummer\r\nsun all around us. The East River had been like a crowded creek compared\r\nto this wide expanse of water slapping and gleaming out there in the sun\r\nwith smoke shadows chasing over it all. There was the rough odor of\r\nsmoke in the air from craft of all kinds as they skurried about. The\r\nhigh black bow of a Cunarder loomed at the end of the dock next ours.\r\nFar across the river the stout German liners lay at their berths--and\r\nthey did not look like sea hogs. What a change had come over the harbor\r\nsince I had met that motorboat. How all the hogs had waddled away, and\r\nthe very smoke and the oil on the waves had taken on deep, vivid\r\nhues--as I had seen through Eleanore\'s eyes. "What a strange wonderful\r\npurple," her low voice seemed to murmur at my side.\r\n\r\n"She\'s going away from here," said Ab. I started:\r\n\r\n"Who is?"\r\n\r\n"That Cunarder. Look at the smoke pour out of her stacks. Got a\r\ncigarette about you?"\r\n\r\n"No," I answered gruffly.\r\n\r\n"Damn."\r\n\r\nIn the slip on our other side a large freight boat was loading, and a\r\nherd of scows and barges were pressing close around her. These clumsy\r\ncraft had cabins, and in some whole families lived. "Harbor Gypsies." A\r\ngood title. I had paid the butcher, but the grocer was still waiting. So\r\nI dismissed my motorboat and grimly turned to scows instead. Children by\r\nthe dozen were making friends from barge to barge. Dogs were all about\r\nus and they too were busy visiting. High up on the roof of a coal\r\nlighter\'s cabin an impudent little skye-terrier kept barking at the\r\nsooty men who were shoveling down below. One of these from time to time\r\nwould lift his black face and good-humoredly call, "Oh, you go to\r\nhell"--which would drive the small dog into frenzies. Most of the barges\r\nhad derrick masts, and all these masts were moving. They rose between me\r\nand the sky, bobbing, tossing and criss-crossing, filling the place with\r\nthe feeling of life, the unending, restless life of the sea.\r\n\r\nAn ear-shattering roar broke in on it all. Our Cunarder was starting.\r\nSmoke belching black from her funnels, the monster was beginning to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nBut what was this woman doing close by us? Out of the cabin of a barge\r\nshe had dragged a little rocking chair, and now she had brought out a\r\nbaby, all dressed up in its Sunday best, and was rocking expectantly,\r\nwatching the ship. Thundering to the harbor, the Cunarder now moved\r\nslowly out. As she swept into the river the end of the pier was revealed\r\nto our eyes all black with people waving. They waved until she was out\r\nin midstream. Then, as they began to turn away, one plump\r\nmotherly-looking woman happened to glance toward us.\r\n\r\n"Why, the cute little baby," we heard her exclaim. And the next minute\r\nhundreds of people were looking. The barge mother rocked serenely.\r\n\r\nAbner grabbed his camera and jumped nimbly down on the barge, where he\r\ntook the baby\'s picture, with the amused crowd for a background.\r\n\r\n"The kid\'s name," he remarked on his return, "is Violetta Rosy. She was\r\nborn at two a. m. at Pier Forty-nine." He was silent for a moment and\r\nthen went on sententiously, "Think what it\'ll mean to her, through all\r\nthe storm and stress of life, to be able to look fondly back upon the\r\ndear old homestead. There\'s a punch to Violetta. Better run her in."\r\n\r\n"I will," I said.\r\n\r\n"And that little thing of mine," he queried modestly, "about the dear\r\nold homestead."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got it," I replied.\r\n\r\n"I hand quite a few little things to writers," Ab continued cheerfully.\r\n"If you\'ll just give me some idea of what it is you\'re looking for----"\r\n\r\n"I\'m looking for the punch," I answered promptly.\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll get on fine," he said. "The editor got me worried some. He\r\nsaid you\'d trained in Paris."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that was only a starter," I told him.\r\n\r\nPresently he went into the dockshed on his unending quest of "the\r\npunch." And left to myself I got thinking. What did Paris know about us?\r\nDe Maupassant\'s methods wouldn\'t do here. I noticed two painters in\r\noveralls at work on that large freighter. With long brooms that they\r\nheld in both hands they were slapping a band of crude yellow paint along\r\nher scarred and rusted side. That was what I needed, the broom! All at\r\nonce the harbor took hold of me hard. And exulting in its bigness, the\r\nbold raw splattering bigness of my native Yankee land, "Now for some\r\nglory stories," I said.\r\n\r\nI went into the dockshed, and there I stayed right through until night,\r\ntill my mind was limp and battered from the rush of new impressions. For\r\nin this long sea station, under the blue arc-lights, in boxes, barrels,\r\ncrates and bags, tumbling, banging, crashing, came the products of this\r\nmodern land. You could feel the pulse of a continent here. From the\r\nfactories, the mines and mills, the prairies and the forests, the\r\nplantations and the vineyards, there flowed a mighty tide of\r\nthings--endlessly, both day and night--you could shut your eyes and see\r\nthe long brown lines of cars crawl eastward from all over the land, you\r\ncould see the stuff converging here to be gathered into coarse rope nets\r\nand swept up to the liners. The pulse beat fast and furious. In gangs at\r\nevery hatchway you saw men heaving, sweating, you heard them swearing,\r\npanting. That day they worked straight through the night. For the pulse\r\nkept beating, beating, and the ship must sail on time!\r\n\r\nAnd now I too worked day and night. In the weeks that followed, Abner\r\nBell came and went many times, but for me it was my entire life. Though\r\nsmall of build I was tough and hard, I had not been sick for a day in\r\nyears, and now I easily stood the strain. Day by day my story grew, my\r\nglory story of world trade. Watching, questioning, listening here,\r\nmaking notes, writing hasty sketches to help keep us going at\r\nhome--slowly I could feel this place yielding up its inner self, its\r\npunch and bigness, endless rush, its feeling of a nation young and\r\npiling up prodigious wealth. From the customhouse came fabulous tales of\r\nmillionaires ransacking the world. Rare old furniture, rugs and\r\ntapestries, paintings, jewels, gorgeous gowns poured in a dazzling\r\ntorrent all that summer through the docks. One day on a Mediterranean\r\nship, in their immaculate "stalls de luxe," came two black Arab horses,\r\nglistening, quivering creatures, valued by the customhouse at twenty\r\nthousand dollars each. And into the same ship that week, as though in\r\npayment for these two, in dust and heavy smell of sweat I saw a thousand\r\ncattle driven, bellowing and lowing.\r\n\r\nI exulted in these symptoms of our crude and lusty youth. I watched my\r\ncountrymen going abroad. Not only through the Summer but straight on\r\ninto the Fall they came by tens of thousands out of the West, people who\r\nhad made some money and were going to blow it in, to buy things and to\r\nsee things, to learn things and to eat things. One day at noon, on the\r\nend of a dock, when the ship was already far out in midstream and all\r\nthe crashing music and cheers had died away, a meek old lady wiped her\r\neyes and murmured very tearfully, "I suppose they\'ll be eating their\r\nluncheon soon." And then the loud voice of her daughter replied:\r\n\r\n"Eat? Why, ma, God bless their hearts, they\'ll sit on that boat and eat\r\nall day!"\r\n\r\nAnd I echoed her wish with a keen delight. God bless their hearts and\r\nstomachs. Oh, hungry vigorous Yankee land, so mightily young--eat on,\r\neat on!\r\n\r\nAnd the land ate on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy work here rose to a climax a week or two before Christmas, when the\r\nnewest liner of them all pulled off a new world\'s record for speed. With\r\nthe company\'s publicity man, who had become a friend of mine, I went on\r\nthe health officer\'s tug down the Bay to meet her, on the coldest,\r\ndarkest night I\'ve ever known on water. Shortly after nine o\'clock the\r\nbig boat\'s light gleamed off the Hook and she bore down upon us. She\r\ncame close, slowed down and towered by our side, weird as a ghost with\r\nsnow and ice in glimmering sheets on her steel sides. She did not stop.\r\nWe caught a rope ladder and scrambled up, and at once we felt her\r\nspeeding on.\r\n\r\nAnd she was indeed a story that night. Bellowing hoarsely now in warning\r\nto all small craft to get out of her way, she was rushing into the\r\nharbor. Suddenly she slowed again, and three dark mail tugs ranged\r\nalongside, and through canvas chutes four thousand sacks of Christmas\r\nmail began to pour down while the ship moved on. Up her other side came\r\nclimbing gangs of men who began to make ready her winches and open up\r\nher hatches. Now we were moving in close to the pier, with a whole fleet\r\nof tugs around us. Faint shouts rose in the zero night, toots and sharp\r\nwhistles. One of the gang-planks was down at last and two hundred\r\ndockers came up on the run. Off went the passengers and the luggage,\r\nreporters skurrying through the crowds. But the ship did not rest. For\r\nshe was to sail again the next night. This was to be a world\'s record\r\nfor speed!\r\n\r\nAll night long the work went on, and I watched it from a deck above,\r\ngoing in now and then for food and hot drinks. On her dock side,\r\nforward, Christmas boxes, bales and packages were being whipped up out\r\nof her hold to the rattle of her winches. One sharp whistle and up they\r\nshot into the air till they swung some seventy feet above. Another\r\nwhistle and down they whirled into the dockshed far below from which a\r\nblaze of light poured up. At the same time she was coaling. Along the\r\nblack wall of her other side, as I peered over the rail above, I saw far\r\nbelow a row of barges crowded with Italians. Powerful lights swung over\r\ntheir heads in the freezing wind, swung above black coal heaps and the\r\nlapping water. It was an inferno of shifting lights and long leaping\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nI watched till daylight blotted out the yellow glare of the lanterns.\r\nThen I went home to get some sleep. And late that night when I came back\r\nI found her almost ready to sail.\r\n\r\nOut of taxis and automobiles chugging down in front of the pier, the\r\npassengers were pouring in. Many were in evening clothes, some just come\r\nfrom dinners and others from box parties. The theaters had just let out.\r\nThe rich warm hues of the women\'s cloaks, the gay head dresses here and\r\nthere and the sparkling earrings, immaculate gloves and dainty wanton\r\nslippered feet, kept giving flashes of color to this dark freezing ocean\r\nplace. Most of these people went hurrying up into the warm, gorgeous\r\ncafe of the ship, which was run from a hotel in Paris. What had all this\r\nto do with the sea?\r\n\r\n"Come on," said the genial press agent. "You\'re the company\'s\r\nguest-to-night."\r\n\r\nAnd while we ate and drank and smoked, and the tables around us filled\r\nwith people whose ripples and bursts of laughter rose over the\r\norchestra\'s festive throb, and corks kept popping everywhere, he told me\r\nwhere they were going, these gay revellers, for their Christmas Day--to\r\nLondon, Brussels, Berlin and Vienna, Paris, Nice, Monte Carlo, Algiers.\r\n\r\n"Now come with me," he said at last, and he took me along warm\r\npassageways to the row of cabins de luxe.\r\n\r\nFirst we looked into the Bridal Suite, to which one of the Pittsburgh\r\nmakers of steel, having just divorced a homely old wife, was presently\r\nto bring his new bride, a ravishing young creature of musical comedy\r\nfame. They had been married that afternoon. A French maid was unpacking\r\ndainty shimmering little gowns, soft furry things and other things of\r\nsilk and lace, and hanging them up in closets. It was a large room, and\r\nthere were other rooms adjoining and two big luxurious baths. The cost\r\nof it all was four thousand dollars for the five days. There were tall\r\nmirrors and dressing tables, there were capacious easy chairs. Low\r\nsubdued lights were here and there, and a thick rug was on the floor.\r\nOver in one corner was a huge double bed of cream colored wood with rich\r\nsoft quilts upon it. Beside the bed in a pink satin cradle there lay a\r\ntiny Pekinese dog.\r\n\r\n"Next," he whispered. We peeped into the next stateroom, and there\r\ndivided from her neighbors by only one thin partition, a sober, wrinkled\r\nlittle old lady in black velvet sat quietly reading her Bible. Soon she\r\nwould be saying her prayers.\r\n\r\n"Next," he whispered. And in the cabin on her other side we caught a\r\nglimpse of two jovial men playing cards in gay pajamas with a bottle of\r\nScotch between them.\r\n\r\n"Next." And as we went on down the row he gave me the names of an\r\nEnglish earl, a Jewish clothing merchant, a Minnesota ranchman, a\r\nbanker\'s widow from Boston, a Tammany politician, a Catholic bishop from\r\nBaltimore, a millionaire cheese maker from Troy and a mining king from\r\nMontana.\r\n\r\n"How about that," he asked at the end, "for an American row de luxe?"\r\n\r\n"My God, it\'s great," I whispered.\r\n\r\n"There\'s only one big question here," he added. "Your long respectable\r\npedigrees and your nice little Puritanical codes can all go to\r\nblazes--this big boat will throw \'em all overboard for you--if you can\r\nanswer, \'I\'ve got the price.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the late Autumn, Eleanore had come back to town. I had a\r\nnote from her one day.\r\n\r\n"Come and tell me what you are writing," she said.\r\n\r\nI went to see her that afternoon, and I was deeply excited. I had often\r\nfelt her by my side when I was watching the harbor life and as often\r\nbehind me while I wrote. We had had long talks together, absorbing talks\r\nabout ourselves. And though now in her easy welcome and through all her\r\ncheerful questions there was not a suggestion that we two had been or\r\never would be anything but genial friends, this did not discourage me in\r\nthe least. No fellow, I thought, could be happy as I and have nothing\r\nbetter than friendship ahead. The Fates could never be so hard, for\r\ncertainly now they were smiling.\r\n\r\nHere was her apartment, just the place I had felt it would be, only\r\ninfinitely more attractive. High up above the Manhattan jungle, it was\r\nquiet and sunny and charming here. From the low, wide living-room\r\nwindows you could see miles out over the harbor where my work was going\r\nso splendidly, and all around the room itself I saw what I was working\r\nfor. Eleanore\'s touch was everywhere. An intimate, lovable feminine home\r\nwith man-sized views from its windows--just like Eleanore herself, from\r\nwhom I found it difficult to keep my hungry eyes away. To that soft\r\nbewildering hair of hers she had done something different--I couldn\'t\r\ntell what, but I loved it. I loved the changing tones of her voice--I\r\nhate monotonous voices. I watched the smiling lights in her eyes. She\r\nwas at her small tea table now. Her motorboat, thank Heaven, was laid\r\nup for the winter, and I had her right here in a room, with nothing to\r\ndo with her eyes but pay a decent amount of attention to me. Then by\r\nsome chance remark I learned that she had been reading what I wrote,\r\nalmost all of it, in fact. And at the slight exclamation I made I saw\r\nher color slightly and bite her lip as though she were angry with\r\nherself for having let that secret out.\r\n\r\n"What do you want to write," she asked, "when you get through with the\r\nharbor?"\r\n\r\n"Fiction," I said. "I want it so hard sometimes that it seems like a\r\nlong way ahead. It seems sometimes," I added, "like a girl I\'d fallen in\r\nlove with--but I couldn\'t even ask her--because I\'m so infernally\r\npoor."\r\n\r\nOver the tea cup at her lips Eleanore looked thoughtfully straight into\r\nand through and behind my eyes.\r\n\r\n"Fiction is such a broad field," she remarked. "What kind do you think\r\nyou\'re going to try?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," I answered. "It still seems so far ahead. You see, I\r\nhave no name at all, and this harbor at least is a good safe start. I\'m\r\nafraid I\'m rather a cautious sort. When I find what I want--and want so\r\nhard that it\'s the deepest part of me--I like to go slow. I\'m afraid to\r\nrisk losing it all--deciding my life one way or the other--by taking a\r\nchance." I made a restless movement. "I wasn\'t speaking of my work just\r\nthen," I added gruffly.\r\n\r\nI suddenly caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror back of Eleanore\'s\r\nchair. And I glared at myself for the fool that I was to have said all\r\nthat. I hadn\'t meant to--not in the least! What a paltry looking cuss I\r\nwas--small, tough and wiry, hair sandy, eyes of no color at all, snub\r\nnose and a jaw shut tight as in pain.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a queer person," said a voice.\r\n\r\n"I am," I agreed forlornly. "I\'m the queerest fellow I ever met." I\r\ncaught a grim twinkle in my eyes. Thank God for a sense of humor.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes," she went on, reflectively, "you seem to me as old as the\r\nhills--and again so young and obvious. I\'m so sorry to hear you say that\r\nyou weren\'t talking of your work. I like to hear men talk of their\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"I know you do," I said hungrily. "And that\'s one of the reasons why\r\nyou\'re going to mean so much some day--to somebody\'s work--and to his\r\nwhole life."\r\n\r\nWhy couldn\'t I stop? Had I gone insane? I rose and moved about the room.\r\nA low rippling laugh brought me back to my senses.\r\n\r\n"But how about _me_ and _my_ life?" she asked. "That ought to be thought\r\nof a little, you know."\r\n\r\nI came close beside her:\r\n\r\n"Let me say this. Won\'t you? I\'ll promise never to say it again. Your\r\nlife is going to be all right. It\'s going to be quite wonderful--you\'ll\r\nbe tremendously happy. I\'m sure of that. It\'s not only the way you\r\nalways--look--it\'s the way you always think and feel. It\'s everything\r\nabout you."\r\n\r\nShe had looked down at her hands for a moment. Now she looked up\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," she said smiling, in a way that told me to smile too. I\r\nobeyed.\r\n\r\n"I did that rather badly, didn\'t I," I said.\r\n\r\n"No, you did that rather well. Especially the first part--I think I\r\nliked that best of all--the part where you promised so solemnly that\r\nyou\'d never do it again."\r\n\r\nI went indignantly back to my chair.\r\n\r\n"Do you know," I said, "I feel sometimes when I\'m with you as though I\r\nwere being managed! Absolutely managed!"\r\n\r\n"I should think you wouldn\'t like that," she replied. Her hands were\r\npeacefully folded now and she looked at me serenely: "I should think\r\nyou\'d rather manage yourself."\r\n\r\nI took the hint. From, that day on, each time I came to see her, I\r\nmanaged myself severely. And this apparently pleased her so much that\r\nshe seemed no longer the least afraid to let me know her as well as I\r\nliked. Her father, too, when I met him now and then in the evenings, was\r\nmost kindly in his welcome. And as winter wore on, my hopes rose high.\r\n\r\nBut one evening, after Dillon had read my story about the Christmas\r\nBoat, he gave me a bitter disappointment.\r\n\r\n"I like it," he said, as he handed it back. "It\'s a fine dramatic piece\r\nof work. But it\'s only a starter here. To get any idea of our problem\r\nyou\'ll have to go all over the harbor. When you\'ve done that for a few\r\nmonths more, and I get back from my trip abroad, I\'ll be glad to help\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"You\'re going abroad?" I asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Next month," he said, "with Eleanore. She seems to think I need a\r\nrest."\r\n\r\nBack came the old feeling of emptiness. And gloomily at home that night\r\nI wondered if it was because she knew she was leaving so soon that she\r\nhad been so intimate lately. How outrageous women are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThey sailed the middle of March.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to look back now and smile at my small desolate self as I was\r\nin the months that followed. But at the time it was no smiling matter. I\r\nwas intensely wretched and I had a right to be, for I could see nothing\r\nwhatever ahead but the most dire uncertainties. Did Eleanore really care\r\nfor me? I didn\'t know. When could I ask her? I didn\'t know. For when\r\nwould I be earning enough to ask any girl to marry me? At present nearly\r\nall I earned was swallowed up by expenses at home, and I knew that in\r\nall likelihood this drain would soon grow heavier.\r\n\r\nFor we could not count much longer on my father\'s salary. Already I had\r\ndone my best to make him give up his position. He stubbornly resisted.\r\n\r\n"I\'m strong as I ever was," he declared, and he took great pains to\r\nprove it. He would sit down to dinner, his face heavy and gray with\r\nfatigue, but by a hard visible effort slowly he would throw it off,\r\nkeenly questioning me about my work, more often quizzing me about it, or\r\nSue about her "revolooters." He had a stock of these dry remarks and he\r\nused them over and over. When the same jokes came night after night we\r\nknew he was very tired. After dinner on such evenings, when I went with\r\nhim into his study to smoke, he would invariably settle back in his\r\nchair with the same loud "Ah!" of comfort, and he would follow this up\r\nas he lit his cigar with the most obvious grunts expressive of health to\r\nprove to me how strong he was. He was always grimly delighted when I\r\nspent these evenings with him, but always before his cigar was out his\r\nhead would sink slowly over his book and soon he would be sound asleep.\r\nThen as I sat at my writing I would glance over from time to time. I\r\ncould tell when he was waking, and at once I would grow absorbed in my\r\nwork. Soon I would hear a slight snort of surprise, I would hear him\r\nstealthily feel for his book, and then presently out of the silence----\r\n\r\n"This is a devilish good piece of writing, boy," he would announce\r\nabruptly. "When _you_ learn to hold your reader like this I\'ll begin to\r\nthink you\'re a writer."\r\n\r\nYes, my father was aging fast, I would soon be the only breadwinner\r\nhere. Sue fought hard against this idea, she was still set on finding\r\nwork for herself, but each time she proposed it Dad would rise so\r\nindignantly, with such evident pain in his glaring old eyes, that she\r\nwould be forced to give up her plan. In such talks I supported him, and\r\nin return when we two were alone Sue would revenge herself on me by the\r\nmost cutting comments on "this inane habit of looking at girls as fit\r\nfor nothing better than marriage."\r\n\r\nThese comments, I was well aware, were aimed at my feeling for Eleanore,\r\nfor whom Sue had no longer any good word but only a smiling derision.\r\nHer remarks were straight out of Bernard Shaw\'s most ribald works, and\r\nthey left me miserably wondering whether any man had ever loved in any\r\nway that wasn\'t the curse or the joke of his life. Sue dwelt on this\r\nglorious age of deep radical changes going on, she spoke of Joe Kramer,\r\nwith whom she still corresponded, and enlarged on the wonderful freedom\r\nhe had to go anywhere at any time. Thank a merciful heaven _he_ wasn\'t\r\ntied down! And if Joe would only keep his head and not marry, not get a\r\nhuge family on his hands----\r\n\r\nSue made me perfectly wretched.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind I again tackled the harbor. Dillon had told me to\r\ncover it all, and this I now set out to do. On warm muggy April days I\r\ntramped what appeared to me hundreds of miles. But the regions that from\r\nEleanore\'s boat had somehow had a feeling of being one great living\r\nthing, now on these dreary trudging days fell apart into remote bays and\r\nslips and rivers, hours of weary travel apart and each without any\r\nconnection with any other that I could see. Railroad tracks wound in and\r\nout with no apparent purpose, dirty freight boats crawled helter-skelter\r\nthis way and that. All seemed a meaningless chaos and jam.\r\n\r\nAnd still worse, as I wrestled with this confusion I found it was\r\ngrowing stale to me. In those Spring days I was fagged and dull, my\r\nimagination would not work. And this gave me a scare. I must _not_ grow\r\nstale, I must keep right on making money to meet the bills that were\r\nstill piling up at home. And so for a Sunday paper I undertook a series\r\non "The Harbor from a Police Boat." This sounded rather exciting and I\r\nhoped that it might restore the lost thrill. The harbor that it showed\r\nme made fine Sunday reading. Out of its grim waters dead bodies bobbed,\r\ndead faces leered, the sodden ends of mysteries. I wrote them and got\r\npaid for them. And I felt no thrill but only disgust. I made some more\r\nmoney out of rats--rats in countless ravenous hordes that had a harbor\r\nworld of their own. This world extended for hundreds of miles in the\r\ndark chill places under the wharves. And the rats kept gnawing, gnawing,\r\nand slowly with the help of the waves they wore away to splinters and\r\npulp the millions of beams and planks and piles. I found that entire\r\nmountains were denuded each year of their forests to supply food for the\r\nrats and the ocean here. I was almost a muckraker now.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I had gone in June to the South Brooklyn waterfront and had\r\ntaken a room in a tenement near the end of a dock peninsula which jutted\r\nout into the bay. For I wanted to live in the very heart of the big\r\nport\'s confusion, to grapple alone with the chaos out of which Dillon\'s\r\nengineers were striving to bring order. Here I lived for weeks by\r\nmyself, taking my meals in a barroom below.\r\n\r\nThere were no stately liners here. The North River piers with their rich\r\nlife had been like a show room. I had come down into the factory now. I\r\ncould see them still, those liners, but only in the distance steaming\r\nthrough the Narrows. Eleanore had gone that way. Here close around me\r\nwere grimy yards with heaps of coal, enormous sheds, and inland one of\r\nthe two narrow mouths of the crowded Erie Basin, out of which slid ugly\r\nfreighters through the dirty water.\r\n\r\nLike the Ancient Mariner I sat there dully on the pier watching the life\r\nof the ocean go past, and I would try to jot it down. But soon I would\r\nstop. "All right--who cares?" The punch was gone. It grew hot and the\r\nwater smelt. And I was as blue a reporter of life as ever chewed his\r\npencil.\r\n\r\nBut life has a way of punching up even a stale young writer. In the\r\nrooms above mine lived a man and wife who quarreled half way through the\r\nnight. Night after night they railed at each other, until one horrible\r\nnight of screams, in the middle of which I heard the man come running\r\ndownstairs. He banged at my door.\r\n\r\n"Come in," I cried morosely. A big figure entered the dark room.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said a rough frightened voice. "Get up and get dressed and\r\nrun for a doctor. Will you, son? I\'m in a hell of a hole!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter!"\r\n\r\n"My woman is havin\' a baby, that\'s what," he answered fiercely. "We\r\nwasn\'t expectin\' it so soon! An\' there ain\'t a single doctor in miles!\r\nBut there\'s a night watchman with a \'phone down there in the dockshed!"\r\n\r\n"All right, old man, I\'ll do my best."\r\n\r\n"Say!" he shouted after me, as I hurried down the stairs. "If you know a\r\ndamn thing about this business come back here the minute you\'ve\r\n\'phoned! I\'m in a hole, brother, a hell of a hole!"\r\n\r\nI came back soon, and within a few minutes after I came I saw a baby\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nI did not sleep that night. My mind was curiously clear. I had had the\r\njolt that I needed from life--its agony and bloody sweat, its mystery.\r\nIt was not dull, it was not stale. The only trouble lay in me. I must\r\nfind a new angle from which to write.\r\n\r\nWhy not try becoming one of the workers? The man upstairs was a tug\r\ncaptain, and grateful to me for what help I had given; he now agreed to\r\ntake me on his tug, where there was plenty of simple work which I did\r\nfor a dollar a day and my board. And at once I felt a difference. The\r\nlight work steadied my overwrought nerves and unlocked my mind which had\r\nset tight. And now at last I began to see my way out of the jungle.\r\n\r\nFor the tug belonged to a row of piers about a mile to the southward.\r\nBrand new gigantic piers they were, with solid rows of factory buildings\r\non the shore behind them, all owned by one great company, which rented\r\nfloors or parts of floors to hundreds of manufacturers here. The raw\r\nmaterials they required were landed from barges or ships at the piers\r\nand delivered to their doors at once, and their finished products were\r\nconveyed in the same way to all parts of the world. Here was a key to\r\nthe future port of ordered combination that Eleanore\'s father was\r\nworking toward. Here was the place I must write up before he came back\r\nfrom abroad, to show him that I had found it.\r\n\r\nAnd the very certainty of this increased my exasperation. For even still\r\nI could not write. Doggedly I worked at night up there in my room in the\r\ntenement, but I wrote the most tedious dismal stuff which I would tear\r\nup savagely. Inanely I would pound my head as though to put punch into\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut another miracle happened to me.\r\n\r\nOn one of those enormous piers, roofed over, dim and cool inside, I\r\nstood one day looking out on the deck of an East Indian freighter, where\r\ntwo half-naked Malays were polishing the brasswork. One of them was a\r\nboy of ten. His small face was uncouth and primitive almost as some\r\nlittle ape\'s, but I saw him look up again and again with a sudden\r\ngleaming expectancy. I grew curious and waited. Now the looks came\r\noftener, his every move was restless. And after a time another boy, a\r\nlittle New York "newsie," with a pack of evening papers, came loitering\r\nalong the pier. Unconcernedly up the gang-plank he went, while the Malay\r\ncrouched in his corner, rigid and tense, his black eyes fixed. The white\r\nboy took no notice. Climbing up a ladder he sold a couple of papers to\r\nsome officers on a deck above, and then he went down again to the dock.\r\nPresently one of the officers yawned and threw his paper over the rail,\r\nand as it fell to the lower deck in an instant the Malay boy was upon\r\nit, devouring its headlines and its pictures with his animal eyes, with\r\none of his small bare brown feet upon the jeweled bosom of the latest\r\nFifth Avenue divorcee.\r\n\r\n"Where does that kid sleep?" I asked an officer. I was shown his bunk\r\nbelow, and there I found I had guessed right. For the side and the top\r\nand both ends of his bunk were lined with red headlines and newspaper\r\npictures all carefully cut and pasted on. Five of the New York "Giants"\r\nwere there.\r\n\r\nAnd as though the fresh fierce hungriness had passed from that small\r\nheathen\'s soul into my own, that day I again became a reporter of things\r\nto be seen in the port of New York.\r\n\r\nBack into the dockshed I went, and all up and down and in and out among\r\npiles of strange and odorous stuffs. And once more I felt the wonder of\r\nthis modern ocean world. I followed this raw produce of Mother Earth\'s\r\nfour corners back into those factory buildings ashore. I saw it made\r\ninto chewing-gum, toys, sofas, glue, curled hair and wall-paper. I saw\r\nit made into ladles\' hats, corks, carpets, dynamos, stuffed dates. I saw\r\nit made into dirt-proof collars and shirt bosoms, salad dressing,\r\nblackboards, corsets and the like. Again I fairly reveled in lists of\r\nthings and the places they came from and the places to which they were\r\ngoing. I saw chewing-gum start for Rio and Quaker Oats for Shanghai,\r\npatent medicine for Nabat, curled hair for Yokohama, "movy" theater\r\nseats for Sydney, tomato soup for Cape Town and corsets for Rangoon.\r\n\r\n"From Everywhere to Anywhere" was the title of my article. It took only\r\na week to write, and was ready when the Dillons came home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThey landed toward the end of July and I went to the dock to meet them.\r\n\r\nElated over my finished story, which I had in my pocket, and made\r\nabsurdly happy by the sight of Eleanore smiling down at me over the\r\nrail, I was surprised at the greeting she gave me.\r\n\r\n"Why, you poor boy. How terribly hard you\'ve been working," she said.\r\nAnd she looked at me as though I were sick and worn to the bone. The end\r\nof it was that I accepted delightedly an invitation to spend a week up\r\nat their cottage on the Sound.\r\n\r\nThose were seven vivid glowing days. I could not relax, I was too\r\nintensely happy, I had too much to tell her, not only about my work but\r\nabout a host of other things that without rhyme or reason popped into my\r\nmind and had to be said. The range of our talk was tremendous, and the\r\nwider we ranged the closer we drew. For she too was telling things, and\r\nher things were as unexpected as mine and infinitely more absorbing. Her\r\nmanner toward me had quite changed. It was that of a nurse with an\r\ninvalid, she frankly ordered me about.\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t you lie back on those cushions?" she asked one morning when\r\nwe were out in her boat. "You ought to be dozing half the day--and\r\ninstead you\'re as wide awake as an owl."\r\n\r\n"I am," I admitted happily. "I\'m trying to see everything." The chic\r\nlittle hat and the blouse she wore were adorably fresh from Paris, and\r\nas I watched her run her boat I could feel flowing into my body and soul\r\na perfectly boundless store of new life.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been thinking you over," she said.\r\n\r\n"Have you?" I asked delightedly. I had often wondered if she had. "What\r\ndo you think?" I inquired.\r\n\r\nEleanore frowned perplexedly.\r\n\r\n"You\'re such a queer combination," she said. "You have such ridiculous\r\nups and downs. To-day you\'re way up, aren\'t you."\r\n\r\n"I am," I said very earnestly. She looked off placidly over the Sound.\r\n\r\n"You\'re so very sensitive," she went on. "You let things take hold of\r\nyou so hard. And yet on the other hand you seem to be so very----" she\r\nhesitated for a word.\r\n\r\n"Tough," I suggested cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"No--hungry," Eleanore said. "You\'re always reaching out for things--you\r\njump right into them so hard. And even when they hurt you--and you\'re\r\nhurt quite easily--you hang on and won\'t let go. Look at the way you\'ve\r\ngone at the harbor right from the start. And you\'re doing it\r\nstill--you\'ve done it all summer until it has made you look like a\r\nghost. And I guess you\'ll keep on all your life. There are harbors\r\neverywhere, you know--in a way the whole world is a harbor--and unless\r\nyou change a lot you\'re going to be hurt a good deal."\r\n\r\n"My mother agreed with you," I said. "She wanted me to be a professor in\r\na quiet college town."\r\n\r\n"Please stop twinkling your eyes," Eleanore commanded. "Your mother knew\r\nyou very well. You might have done that--and settled down--with some\r\nnice quiet college girl--if you had done it years ago. As it is, of\r\ncourse you\'re hopeless."\r\n\r\n"I am not hopeless," I declared indignantly. "If I can only get what I\r\nwant I\'ll be the happiest fellow alive!"\r\n\r\n"I know," she answered thoughtfully. "You told me that before. You want\r\nfiction, don\'t you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, fiction," I said wrathfully. "I want that more than anything\r\nelse. But I don\'t want any quiet kind, and I don\'t want any quiet town,"\r\nI went on, leaning forward intensely. "I want the harbor and the city--I\r\nwant it thick and heavy, and just as fast as it will come. I want all\r\nthe life there is in the world--all the beauty--all the happiness! And I\r\ncan\'t wait--I want it soon!"\r\n\r\nFrom under the brim of her soft white hat her blue-gray eyes were fixed\r\nintently on the shore, which was miles away. But watching her I saw she\r\nknew that all the time I was saying desperately, "I want you."\r\n\r\nI knew she did not want me to say anything like that out loud, and I\r\nfelt myself that I had no right--not until I had done so much more in my\r\nwriting. But I kept circling around it. Half the time on purpose and as\r\noften quite unconsciously, in all we talked about those days I kept\r\neagerly filling in the picture of the life we two might lead. When in\r\none of her cool hostile moods--moods which came over her suddenly--she\r\ntold me almost jealously how happy she\'d been with her father abroad and\r\nhow together they had planned to go to India, China, Japan in the years\r\nto come, I brought her back to my subject by saying: "I mean to travel a\r\nlot myself."\r\n\r\n"That\'s one advantage I have as a writer," I continued earnestly. "I\'ll\r\nnever be tied down to one place. All my life--whenever I choose--I can\r\npick up my work and go anywhere."\r\n\r\nShe looked straight back into my eyes.\r\n\r\n"I wish my father could," she said.\r\n\r\n"Look here," I said indignantly. "Your father has been four months\r\nabroad while I have been in Brooklyn! Isn\'t it only fair and square to\r\nlet _me_ travel this afternoon?" She looked at me reluctantly.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she agreed. "I suppose it is."\r\n\r\n"Come along," I urged, and off we went. While our boat drifted idly that\r\nlong, lazy afternoon, we went careering all over the world and I kept\r\ndoggedly by her side. Every now and then I would make her stop while we\r\nhad a good look at each other, exploring deep into the old questions,\r\n"What are you and what do you want?"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t run a motorboat all your life," I reminded her. "What are you\r\ngoing to tackle next?"\r\n\r\n"Our living-room," she answered. "I\'m going to have it done over next\r\nmonth."\r\n\r\nThat took us into house furnishings, and I gave her ideas by the score.\r\nI had never thought about this before, but now I thought hard and\r\neagerly--until she brought me up with a jerk, by pityingly murmuring:\r\n\r\n"What perfectly frightful taste you have. It\'s funny--because you\'re an\r\nartist--you really write quite beautiful things."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," I answered grimly. "I can see that living-room----"\r\n\r\n"So can I," she said cheerfully. "But so long as you like it, that\'s all\r\nthere is to be said. You\'re the one who has to live in it, you know. Now\r\nmy father likes a room----"\r\n\r\nAnd while I looked gloomily over the water she told me what her father\r\nliked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe came out from the city each evening by train. He refused to use the\r\nboat these days, he said he was so infernally busy that he could not\r\nspare the time. He brought out stacks of papers and plans which had\r\npiled up while he was abroad, and with these he busied himself at night.\r\nAnd though Eleanore from the veranda glanced in at him frequently, she\r\nnever again caught him looking old. And when she went in to make him\r\nstop working he smilingly told her to leave him alone. He smoked many\r\ncigars with apparent enjoyment, his lean face wrinkling over the smoke\r\nas he turned over plan after plan for the harbor. His manner to me was\r\nif anything even kindlier than before. He began calling me "Billy" now.\r\n\r\nOn the last night of my stay he said:\r\n\r\n"I think you\'re the man I\'ve been looking for. I\'ve just read your story\r\nand you\'ve done exactly what I hoped. You\'ve pictured one spot of\r\nefficiency in a whole dreary desert of waste. Come up to my office\r\nto-morrow at ten."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nSo at last I went up to the tower.\r\n\r\nHis office took up an entire floor near the tapering top of the\r\nbuilding, and as we walked slowly around the narrow steel balcony\r\noutside, a tremendous panorama unrolled down there before our eyes. We\r\ncould see every part of the port below stretching away to the horizon,\r\nand through Dillon\'s powerful field glass I saw pictures of all I had\r\nseen before in my weary weeks of trudging down there in the haze and\r\ndust. Down there I had felt like a little worm, up here I felt among the\r\ngods. There all had been matter and chaos, here all was mind and a will\r\nto find a way out of confusion. The glass gave me the pictures in swift\r\nsuccession, in a moment I made a leap of ten miles, and as I listened on\r\nand on to the quiet voice at my elbow, the pictures all came sweeping\r\ntogether as parts of one colossal whole. The first social vision of my\r\nlife I had through Dillon\'s field glass.\r\n\r\n"To see any harbor or city or state as a whole," he said, "is what most\r\nAmericans cannot do. And it\'s what they\'ve got to learn to do."\r\n\r\nAnd while I looked where he told me to, like a surgeon about to operate\r\nhe talked of his mighty patient, a giant struggling to breathe, with\r\nswollen veins and arteries. He made me see the Hudson, the East River\r\nand the railroad lines all pouring in their traffic, to be shifted and\r\nreloaded onto the ocean vessels in a perfect fever of confusion and\r\ndelay. Far below us you could see long lines of tiny trucks and wagons\r\nwaiting hours for a chance to get into the docksheds. New York, he\r\nsaid, in true Yankee style had developed its waterfront pell mell, each\r\nrailroad and each ship line grabbing sites for its own use, until the\r\nport was now so clogged, so tangled and congested that it was able to\r\ngrow no more.\r\n\r\n"And it\'s got to grow," he said. The old helter-skelter method had\r\nserved well enough in years gone by, for this port had been like this\r\nwhole bountiful land, its natural advantages had been so prodigious it\r\ncould stand all our blind and hoggish mistakes. But now we were rapidly\r\nnearing the time when every mistake we made would cost us tens of\r\nmillions of dollars. For within a few years the Big Ditch would open\r\nacross Panama, and the commerce of South America, together with that of\r\nthe Orient, would pour into the harbor here to meet the westbound\r\ncommerce of Europe. Ships of all nations would steam through the\r\nNarrows, and we must be ready to welcome them all, with an ample\r\ngenerous harbor worthy of the world\'s first port.\r\n\r\n"To get ready," he said, "what we\'ve got to do is to organize this port\r\nas a whole, like the big industrial plant it is."\r\n\r\nHe began to show me some of the plans in blue-print maps and sketches. I\r\nsaw tens of thousands of freight cars gathered in great central yards at\r\na few main strategic points connected by long tunnels with all the minor\r\ncenters. I saw the port no longer as a mere body of water, but with a\r\nwhole region deep beneath of these long winding tunnels through which\r\nflowed the traffic unseen and unheard. I saw along the waterfronts\r\ncontinuous lines of docksheds where by huge cranes and other devices the\r\nloading and unloading could be done with enormous saving of time. Along\r\nthe heavy roofs of steel of these continuous lines of buildings\r\nstretched wide ocean boulevards with trees and shrubs and flowers to\r\nshut out the clamorous life below. Warehouses and factory buildings rose\r\nin solid rows behind. The city was to build them all, and the city as\r\nthe landlord was to invite the ships and railroads, and the\r\nmanufacturers too, to come in and get together, to stop their fighting\r\nand grabbing and work with each other in one great plan.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what we mean nowadays by a port," he told me at the end of our\r\ntalk. "A complicated industrial organ, the heart of a country\'s\r\ncirculation, pumping in and out its millions of tons of traffic as\r\nquickly and cheaply as possible. That\'s efficiency, scientific\r\nmanagement or just plain engineering, whatever you want to call it. But\r\nit\'s got to be done for us all in a plan instead of each for himself in\r\na blind struggling chaos."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI came down from the tower with a dazed, excited feeling which lasted\r\nall the rest of the day. That harbor of confusion had been for months my\r\nentire world, it had baffled and beaten me till I was weak. And now this\r\nman had swept together all its parts and showed me one immense design.\r\n\r\nHe had promised me the first use of his plans. With this to go on I\r\ndrafted a scheme for a series of magazine articles on "The First Port of\r\nthe World," and I soon placed it in advance at four hundred dollars an\r\narticle. At last I was coming up in life, my first big story had begun!\r\n\r\nI went with Dillon each week-end up to the cottage on the Sound. Here he\r\ntalked in detail of his dreams, and Eleanore with her old passion and\r\npride delighted to draw him out for me. And not only her father--for to\r\nhelp me in my work she invited out here in the evenings many of his\r\nengineer friends.\r\n\r\n"It has always been awfully hard for me," she confided, "to understand\r\nbig questions by reading about them out of books. But I love to hear\r\nabout them from men who are living and working right in them. I love to\r\nfeel a little how it must be to be living their lives."\r\n\r\nShe was a wonderful listener, for she had quietly studied each man until\r\nnow she had a kind of an instinct for drawing the very best of him out.\r\nWhile he talked she would sit with her sewing, now and then putting in a\r\nquestion to help. Often I would glance at her there and see in her\r\nslightly frowning face how intently she was listening, thinking and\r\nplanning to help me. Sometimes she would meet my look. I would grow\r\ntremendously happy.\r\n\r\n"In a little while," I thought. But then I would pull myself up with a\r\njerk: "Stop looking at her, you young fool, keep your mind on this\r\nengineer. You\'ve got the chance of your life right now to make good in\r\nyour work and be happy. Don\'t fall down! Get busy!"\r\n\r\nAnd I did. I threw myself into the lives of these men who were the\r\nliving embodiments of all that bigness, boldness, punch that had so\r\ngripped and thrilled me. The harbor had drawn them around it out of the\r\nhum and rush of the country, and here they were in its service, watching\r\nit, studying, planning for its even more stupendous growth. One night I\r\nheard them discuss the idea of moving the East River, making it flow\r\nacross Long Island, filling in its old water bed and making New York and\r\nBrooklyn one. They talked of this scheme in a hard-headed Yankee way\r\nthat made me forget for the moment its boldness, until some cool remark\r\nopened my eyes to the fact that this change would shift vast\r\npopulations, plant millions of people this way and that.\r\n\r\nBut against these men of the tower, with their wide, deliberate views\r\nahead, embracing and binding together not only this port but the whole\r\nwestern world depending upon it, I found in the city jungle innumerable\r\npetty men, who could see only their own narrow interests of to-day, and\r\nwho fought blindly any change for a to-morrow--fellows in such mortal\r\nfear of some possible benefit to their rivals that they could see none\r\nfor themselves. They were hopelessly used to fighting each other. And I\r\ncame to feel that all these men, though many were still young in years,\r\nbelonged to a generation gone by, to the age of individual strife that\r\nmy father had lived and worked in--and that like him they were all soon\r\nto be swept to one side by the inexorable harbor of to-day, which had no\r\nfurther use for them.\r\n\r\nIt needed bigger men. It needed men like Dillon and behind him those\r\nmysterious powers downtown, the men he had called the brains of the\r\nnation, who read the signs of the new times, who saw that the West was\r\nnow fast filling up, that the eyes of the nation were once more turning\r\noutward, and that untold resources of wealth were soon to be available\r\nfor mighty sea adventures, a vast fleet of Yankee ships that should\r\ndrive the surplus output of our teeming industries into all markets of\r\nthe world. And the men who saw these things coming were the only ones\r\nwho were big enough to prepare the country to meet them. My father\'s\r\ndream was at last coming true--too late for him to play a part. He had\r\nbeen but a prophet, a lonely pioneer.\r\n\r\nMy view of the harbor was different now. I had seen it before as a vast\r\nmachine molding the lives of all people around it. But now behind the\r\nmachine itself I felt the minds of its molders. I saw its ponderous\r\nmasses of freight, its multitudes of people, all pushed and shifted this\r\nway and that by these invisible powers. And by degrees I made for myself\r\na new god, and its name was Efficiency.\r\n\r\nHere at last was a god that I felt could stand! I had made so many in\r\nyears gone by, I had been making them all my life--from those first\r\nfearful idols, the condors and the cannibals, to the kind old god of\r\ngoodness in my mother\'s church and the radiant goddess of beauty and art\r\nover there in Paris. One by one I had raised them up, and one by one the\r\nharbor had flowed in and dragged them down. But now in my full manhood\r\n(for remember I was twenty-five!) I had found and taken to myself a god\r\nthat I felt sure of. No harbor could make it totter and fall. For it was\r\narmed with Science, its feet stood firm on mechanical laws and in its\r\nhead were all the brains of all the strong men at the top.\r\n\r\nAnd all the multitudes below seemed mere pigmies to me now. I remember\r\none late twilight, coming back from a talk with an engineer, I boarded a\r\nferry at the rush hour and watched the people herd on like sheep. How\r\nsmall they seemed, how petty their thoughts compared to mine, how blind\r\ntheir views of the harbor.\r\n\r\nHere was a little Italian bride, just landed, by the looks of her. She\r\nkept her face close to her lover\'s, smiling dazedly into his eyes. And\r\nshe saw no harbor. Here near by was a fat old gentleman with a highly\r\npainted young lady who laughed and swore softly at him as I passed. I\r\nsat down beside them a moment and listened. The old gentleman seemed\r\nquite mad with desire. He was pleading eagerly, whining. And he saw no\r\nharbor. Close by sat two tall serious men. One was deep in a socialist\r\nbook, the other in news of the Giants. Both seemed equally absorbed. And\r\nthey saw no harbor. I moved on to another spot, and sitting down by a\r\nthin seedy-looking Irish girl I heard her talk to her husband about\r\nhaving their baby\'s life insured according to a wonderful plan an agent\r\nhad described to her. As she spoke she was frowning anxiously--and she\r\nsaw no harbor. Not far away a plump flashy young creature was smiling\r\ndown on the bootblack who was busily shining her small patent leather\r\nshoes. Her bright blue petticoat lifted high displayed the most enticing\r\ncharms, and as now she turned to look off toward the lights of the city\r\nahead, she smiled gaily to herself. And she saw no harbor. And alone up\r\nat the windy bow I found a squat husky laborer with his dirty coat and\r\nshirt thrown open wide, the wind on his bare hairy chest, hungrily\r\nwatching the dock ahead as though for his supper--seeing no harbor, no\r\nworld\'s first port, no plans for vast fleets or a great canal, none of\r\nthe big things shaping his life.\r\n\r\nBut I saw. Orders had gone out from the tower east and west and south\r\nand north to show me every courtesy. And with a miraculous youthful ease\r\nI understood all that I saw and heard. The details all fitted right into\r\nthe whole, or if they didn\'t I made them fit. Here was a splendid end to\r\nchaos and blind wrestling with life. And feeling stronger and more sure\r\nthan ever in my life before, I set out to build my series of glory\r\nstories about it all, laying on the color thick to reach a million pigmy\r\nreaders, grip them, pull them out of their holes, make them sit up and\r\nrub their eyes.\r\n\r\nFor I was now a success in life! The exuberant joy of youth and success\r\nfilled the whole immense region for me. In those Fall days there was\r\nnothing too hard to try, no queer hours too exhausting, no deep corner\r\ntoo remote, in the search for my material. I saw the place from an old\r\nfisherman\'s boat and from a revenue launch at night, with its\r\nsearchlight combing the waters far and wide for smugglers. I saw it from\r\nbig pilot boats that put far out to sea to meet the incoming liners. I\r\nate many good suppers and slept long nights on a stout jolly tug called\r\n_The Happy_, where from my snug bunk at the stern through the open door\r\nI could watch the stars. I went down into tunnels deep beneath the\r\nwaters. I went often to the Navy Yard. I dined many nights on\r\nbattleships, where the talk of the naval officers recalled my father\'s\r\npicture of a fighting ocean world. They too talked of the Big Canal, but\r\nin terms of war instead of peace. I went out to the coast defenses, and\r\nwith an army major I made a tour of the lights and buoys.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps more often than anywhere else, I went to a rude log cabin on\r\nthe side of a wooded hill high up on Staten Island, where lived a\r\nNorwegian engineer. He had a cozy den up there, with book-shelves set\r\ninto the logs, two deep bunks, a few bright rugs on the rough floor,\r\nsome soft, ponderous leather chairs and a crackling little stove on\r\nwhich we cooked delicious suppers. Later out on the narrow porch we\r\nwould puff lazy smoke wreaths and watch the vast valley of lights below,\r\nfrom the distant twinkling arch of the Bridge to the sparkling towers of\r\nold Coney. Down there like swarms of fire-flies were countless darting\r\nskurrying lights, red and blue and green and white. Far off to the south\r\nflashed the light of the Hook, and still other signals gleamed low from\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nHere I came often with Eleanore, for she had now come back to town. In\r\nher boat we went to many new spots and back to all the old ones. We\r\nfound new beauties in them all. At home in the evenings we had long\r\ntalks. And all the time I could feel that we two both knew what was\r\ncoming, that steadily we were drawing together, that all my work and my\r\nview of the harbor took its joy and its glory from this.\r\n\r\n"In a little while," I thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been little at home those days, for the house in Brooklyn\r\ndisturbed me now. Poor old Dad. Since I had secured my contract he had\r\ntried so hard to help me, to be eager, interested, alive, to talk it all\r\nover with me at night. And this I did not like to do. A vague feeling of\r\nguilt and disloyalty would creep into my now boundless zest for the\r\nharbor that had crowded him out. And I think that he suspected this. One\r\nnight, when with this feeling I stupidly tried to talk as though I still\r\nhated all its ugliness, its clamor, smoke and grime, I caught a twinkle\r\nof pain in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Boy," he broke in roughly, "I hope you\'ll always talk and write what\r\nyou believe and nothing else! I wouldn\'t give a picayune for any chap\r\nwho didn\'t!"\r\n\r\nI could feel him watching anxiously my affair with Eleanore. In the days\r\nwhen she had come to the house he had grown very fond of her, and now by\r\nfrequent questions, slipped in with a studied indifference, he showed an\r\ninterest which in time became a deep suspense.\r\n\r\n"Out again this evening, son?" he called in one night from the bathroom\r\nwhere he was washing his hands and face before going down to supper. In\r\nmy room adjoining I was dressing to go out.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Dad."\r\n\r\n"What for?"\r\n\r\n"Some work."\r\n\r\n"Be out for dinner too?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Who with?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, a pilot," I answered abstractedly. I was wondering if she would\r\nwear her blue gown. She had asked quite a number of people that night.\r\nThen I saw Dad in the doorway. Briskly rubbing his gray head with a\r\ntowel, he was eyeing my evening clothes.\r\n\r\n"Devilish polished chaps these days--pilots," he commented. I heard a\r\nlow snort of glee from his room.\r\n\r\nMy sister, on the other hand, had no more patience than before with this\r\nfast deepening love of mine, which had drawn me away from her radical\r\nfriends up to the men of the tower who worked for the big companies. By\r\nthe most vigorous ironies, the most industrious witty remarks, she made\r\nme feel how thoroughly she disapproved of anything so deadening as\r\nmarriage, home and settling down, in this glorious age of new ideas.\r\n\r\nOne morning at breakfast, when I remarked as I commonly did that I would\r\nbe out for dinner that night,\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?" she asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n"To Eleanore Dillon\'s," I replied. Our eyes met squarely for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what it means to go there so often, almost every night?"\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n"I do," I answered bluntly. I would finish this meddling once and for\r\nall. But Sue did not look finished.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better stay home to-night, Billy," she said.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Joe Kramer is coming."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"He telephoned me late last night. He\'s just come from Colorado and he\r\nsails to-morrow for England. He\'s awfully anxious to see you."\r\n\r\nOf course he was, and I knew what about! I saw at once by the look on\r\nher face that Sue had told him all about me and had begged him to see\r\nwhat he could do. Why couldn\'t they leave a fellow alone, I said\r\nwrathfully to myself.\r\n\r\nBut my ire softened when I met Joe. In the year and a half since I had\r\nseen him the lines in his face had deepened, the stoop of his big\r\nshoulders had grown even more pronounced, and again I felt that wistful,\r\nfrowning, searching quality in him. Beneath his gruffness and his jeers\r\nhe was so honestly pushing on for what he could find most real in life.\r\nA wave of the old affection came over me suddenly without warning.\r\nVaguely I wondered about it. Why did he always grip me so?\r\n\r\nMy father too appeared at first delighted to see him. He had shown a\r\nkeen relish for J. K. from that first time in college when I had brought\r\nhim home for Christmas. Since then, whenever Joe had come, he and Dad\r\nhad always managed to retreat to the study together and smoke and have\r\nlong dogged arguments. But to-night it was not the same. For in his\r\ngrowth as a radical, Joe had gone beyond all arguing now. Lines of deep\r\ndispleasure slowly tightened on Dad\'s face. All through dinner he kept\r\nattempting to turn the talk from Joe\'s work to mine. But this I would\r\nhave none of, I wanted to be let alone. So I nervously kept the\r\nconversation on what Joe was up to. And Sue seemed more than eager to\r\nlearn.\r\n\r\nJ. K. was up to a good deal.\r\n\r\n"This muckraking game is played out," he said. "We all know how rotten\r\nthings are. All we want to know now is what\'s to be done." And he\r\nhimself had become absorbed in what the working class was doing. As a\r\nreporter in the West he had been to strike after strike, ending with a\r\nlong ugly struggle in the Colorado mines. He talked about it intensely,\r\nthe greed of the mine owners, the brutality of the militia, the "bull\r\npens" into which strikers were thrown. Vaguely I felt he was giving us a\r\nmost distorted picture, and glancing now and then at my father I saw\r\nthat he thought it a pack of lies. Joe made all the strikers the most\r\nheroic figures, and he spoke of their struggle as only a part of a great\r\nlabor war that was soon to sweep the entire land.\r\n\r\nSue excitedly drew him out, and I felt it was all for my benefit. Joe\r\nsaid that he was going abroad in order that he might write the truth\r\nabout the labor world over there. The American papers and magazines\r\nwould let you write the truth, he said, about labor over in Europe,\r\nbecause it was at a safe distance. But they wouldn\'t allow it here. And\r\nthen Sue looked across at me as though to say, "It\'s only stuff like\r\n_yours_ they allow."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you two go out for a walk?" she suggested sweetly after\r\ndinner. And I consented gladly, for there are times when nothing on\r\nearth can be worse than your own sister.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe went down to the old East River docks and walked for some time with\r\nlittle said. Then Joe turned on me abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Well, Bill," he said, "I\'ve read your stuff. It\'s damn well written."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," I replied.\r\n\r\n"If I\'ve got any knocking to do," he went on with a visible effort, "I\r\nknow you\'ll give me credit for not knocking out of jealousy. I\'m not\r\njealous, I\'m honestly tickled to death. I was wrong about you in Paris.\r\nYou and me were different kinds. What you got over there was just what\r\nyou needed, it has put you already way out of my class, and it\'s going\r\nto give you a lot of power as a spreader of ideas. That\'s why I hate so\r\nlike the devil to see you starting out like this, with what I\'m so sure\r\nare the wrong ideas."\r\n\r\n"How are they wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Think a minute. Why is your magazine pushing you so? The first story of\r\nyour series is only just out and they\'ve already boomed you all over the\r\ncountry. Why, Bill, I saw your picture in a trolley car in Denver--and\r\nyou\'re only twenty-five years old! It\'s damn fine writing, I\'ll say it\r\nagain, but that\'s not reason enough for this. You\'ve got to go down\r\ndeeper and look into your magazine\'s policy--which is to strike a\r\nbalance for all kinds of middle-class readers and for their advertisers\r\ntoo. They\'ve run some radical stuff this year, and they\'re booming you\r\nnow to balance off, to show how \'safe and sane\' they can be in the way\r\nthey look at life, at big business and at industry--as you do here in\r\nthe harbor. You\'re making gods out of the men at the top, you\'ve seen\r\n\'em as they see themselves, and you\'ve only seen what they see here.\r\nYou\'ve missed all the millions of people here who depend on the place\r\nfor their jobs and their lives. They don\'t count for you----"\r\n\r\n"That\'s not true at all!" I interrupted hotly. "It\'s just for them and\r\ntheir children that fellows like Dillon are on the job--to make a better\r\nharbor!"\r\n\r\n"_For_ them, _for_ the people!" said Joe. "That\'s what I\'m kicking at in\r\nyou, Bill--you treat us all like a mass of dubs that need gods above to\r\ndo everything _for_ us because we can\'t do it all by ourselves!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe the people can," I retorted. "From what I\'ve seen I\r\nhonestly don\'t believe they count. The fellows that count in a job like\r\nthis are the fellows with punch and grit enough to fight their way up\r\nout of the ranks----"\r\n\r\n"I know, and be lieutenants and captains in a regular army of peace,\r\nwith your friend Dillon in command and Wall Street in command of him!\r\nIsn\'t that your view?"\r\n\r\n"All right, it is! I don\'t see any harm in that. It\'s the only safe way\r\nthat I can see out of this mess of a harbor we\'ve got. These men are the\r\nefficient ones--they\'re the fellows that have the brains and that know\r\nhow to work--to use science, money, everything--to get a decent world\r\nahead. What\'s the matter with efficiency?"\r\n\r\n"Your latest god," sneered J. K.\r\n\r\n"Suppose it is! What\'s wrong with it? What\'s the matter with Dillon? Is\r\nhe a crook?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Joe, "that\'s just the worst of him. He\'s so damned honest,\r\nhe\'s such a hard worker. I\'ve met men like him all over the country,\r\nand they\'re the most dangerous men we\'ve got. Because they\'re the real\r\nstrength of Wall Street--just as thousands of clean hard working priests\r\nare the strength of the Catholic church! They keep their church going\r\nand Dillon keeps his--he\'s a regular priest of big business! And he\r\ntakes hold of kids like you and molds your views like his for life. Look\r\nat what he has done with you here. Does he say a word to you about\r\nGraft? Does he talk of the North Atlantic Pool or any one of the other\r\npools and schemes by which they keep up rates? Does he make you think\r\nabout low wages and long hours and all the fellows hurt or killed on the\r\ndocks and in the stoke holes? Does he give you any feeling at all of\r\nthis harbor as a city of four million people, most of \'em getting a raw\r\ndeal and getting mad about it? That\'s more important to you and me than\r\nall the efficiency gods on earth. You\'ve got to decide which side you\'re\r\non. And that\'s what\'s got me talking now. I see so plain which way\r\nyou\'re letting yourself be pulled. I\'ve seen so many pulled the same\r\nway. It\'s so pleasant up there at the top, there\'s so much money and\r\nbrains up there and refinement--such women to get married to, such homes\r\nto settle down in. Sometimes I wish every promising radical kid in the\r\ncountry could get himself into some scandal that would cut him off for\r\nlife from any chance of being received by this damned respectable upper\r\nclass!"\r\n\r\nHe stopped for a moment, and then with a gruff intensity:\r\n\r\n"We need you, Bill," he ended. "We need you bad. We don\'t want you to\r\nmarry a girl at the top. We don\'t want you anchored up there for life."\r\n\r\nWe were standing still now, and I was looking out on the river. Through\r\nthe grip of his hand on my arm I could feel his body taut and quivering,\r\nhis whole spirit hot with revolt. The same old Joe, but tenser now,\r\nstrained almost to the breaking point. But I myself was different. In\r\ncollege he had appealed to me because there I was groping and had found\r\nnothing. But now I had found something sure. And so, though to my own\r\nsurprise a deep emotional part of me rose up in sudden response to Joe\r\nand made me feel guilty to hold back, it was only for a moment, and then\r\nmy mind told me he was wrong. Poor old J. K. What a black distorted view\r\nhe had--grown out of a distorted life of traveling continually from one\r\ncenter of trouble to another. How could he be any judge of life?\r\n\r\n"Look here, Joe," I said. "I\'m a kid, as you say, and some day I may see\r\nyour side of this. But I don\'t now, I can\'t--for since I left Paris I\'ve\r\nbeen through enough to make me feel what a job living is, I mean really\r\nliving and growing. And I know what a difference Dillon has made. He has\r\nbeen to my life what he is to this harbor. And I\'m not old enough nor\r\nstrong enough to throw over a man as big as that and as honest and clean\r\nin his thinking, and throw myself in with your millions of people, who\r\nseem to me either mighty poor thinkers or fellows who don\'t think at\r\nall. They\'re not in my line. I believe in men who can think clean, who\r\nhave trained their minds by years of hard work, who don\'t try to tear\r\ndown and bring things to a smash, but are always building, building! You\r\ntalk about this upper class. But they\'re my people, aren\'t they, that\'s\r\nwhere I was born. And I\'m going on with them. I believe they\'re right\r\nand I know they\'re strong--I mean strong enough to handle all this--make\r\nit better."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll make it worse," Joe answered. And then as he turned to me once\r\nmore he added very bitterly, "You\'ll see strength enough in the people\r\nsome day."\r\n\r\nA few moments later he left me.\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch and found it was not yet nine o\'clock. I went to\r\nEleanore Dillon. And within an hour Joe and his world of crowds and\r\nconfusion were swept utterly out of my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nI had often told Eleanore of Joe. She had asked me about him many times.\r\n"It\'s queer," she had said, "what a hold he must have had on you. I feel\r\nsure he\'s just the kind of a person I wouldn\'t like and who wouldn\'t\r\nlike me. I don\'t think he\'s really your kind either, and yet he has a\r\nhold on you still. Yes, he has, I can feel he has."\r\n\r\nAnd to-night when I told her that I had been with him,\r\n\r\n"What did he want of you?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"He wants me to drop everything," I answered. And I tried to give her\r\nsome idea of what he had said.\r\n\r\nBut as I talked, the thought came suddenly into my mind that here at\r\nlast was the very time to settle my life one way or the other, to ask\r\nher if she would be my wife. I grew excited and confused, my voice\r\nsounding unnatural to my ears. And as I talked on about Joe, my heart\r\npounding, I could barely keep the thoughts in line.\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t want what he wants," I ended desperately. "That nor\r\nanything like it. I want just what I\'ve been getting--just this kind of\r\nwork and life. And I want _you_--for life, I mean--if you can ever feel\r\nlike that."\r\n\r\nEleanore said nothing. In an instant the world and everything in it had\r\nnarrowed to the two of us. The intensity was unbearable. I rose abruptly\r\nand turned away. I felt suddenly far out of my depth. Confusedly and\r\nfuriously I felt that I had bungled things, that here was something in\r\nlife so strange I could do nothing with it. What a young fool I was to\r\nhave thought she could ever care for a fellow like me! I felt she must\r\nbe smiling. Despairingly I turned to see.\r\n\r\nAnd Eleanore was smiling--in a way that steadied me in a flash. For her\r\nsmile was so plainly a quick, strong effort to steady herself.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you want me like that," she said, in a voice that did not\r\nsound like hers. "I don\'t believe in hiding things.... I\'m--very happy."\r\nShe looked down at her hands in her lap and they slowly locked together.\r\n"But of course it means our whole lives, you see--and we mustn\'t hurry\r\nor make a mistake. Now that we know--this much--we can talk about it\r\nquite openly--about each other and what we want--what kinds of\r\nlives--what we believe in--whether we\'d be best for each other. It\'s\r\nwhat we ought to talk about--a good many times--it may be weeks."\r\n\r\n"All right," I agreed. I was utterly changed. At her first words I had\r\nfelt a deep rush of relief, and seeing her tremendous pluck and the\r\neffort she was making, I pitied, worshiped and loved her all in the same\r\nmoment. And as we talked on for a few minutes more in that grave and\r\nunnaturally sensible way about the pros and cons of it all, these\r\nfeelings within me mounted so swiftly that all at once I again broke\r\noff.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe there\'s any use in this," I declared. "It\'s perfectly\r\nidiotic!"\r\n\r\n"Of course it is," she promptly agreed.\r\n\r\nAnd then after a rigid instant when each of us looked at the other as\r\nthough asking, "Quick! What are we going to do?"--she burst out laughing\r\nexcitedly. So did I, and that carried her into my arms and--I remember\r\nnothing--until after a while she asked me to go, because she wanted to\r\nbe by herself. And I noticed how bright and wet were her eyes.\r\n\r\nI saw them still in the darkness down along the river front, where I\r\nwalked for half the rest of the night, stopping to draw a deep breath\r\nof the sea and laugh excitedly and go on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLife changed rapidly after that night. I grew so absorbed in Eleanore\r\nand in all that was waiting just ahead, that it was hard not to shut out\r\neverything else, most of all impersonal things. It was hard to write,\r\nand for days I wrote nothing. I remember only intimate talks. Everyone I\r\ntalked to seemed to be deeply personal.\r\n\r\nI told my father about it the next evening before supper. I found him in\r\nhis old chair in the study buried deep in his paper.\r\n\r\n"Say, Dad--would you mind coming up to your room?" He smote his paper to\r\none side.\r\n\r\n"What the devil," he asked, "do I want to come up to my room for?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve--the fact is I\'ve something you ought to know." I could hear Sue\r\nin the other room.\r\n\r\n"All right, my boy," he said nervously. As he followed me he kept\r\nclearing his throat. Sue must have guessed and prepared him. In his room\r\nhe fussed about, grunted hard over getting off his shoes and, finding\r\nhis slippers, then lay back on his sofa with his hands behind his head\r\nand uttered an explosive sigh.\r\n\r\n"All right, son, now fire ahead," he said jocosely. I loved him at that\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"You know Eleanore Dillon," I began.\r\n\r\n"She turned you down!"\r\n\r\n"No! She took me!"\r\n\r\n"The devil you say!" He sat bolt upright, staring. "Well, my boy, I\'m\r\nvery glad," he said thickly. His eyes were moist. "I\'m glad--glad! She\'s\r\na fine girl--strong character--strong! I wish your poor mother were\r\nalive--she\'d be happy--this girl will make a good wife--you must bring\r\nher right here to live with us!"\r\n\r\nAnd so he talked on, his voice trembling. Then out of his confusion rose\r\nthe money question, and at once his mind grew clear. And to my surprise\r\nhe urged me to lose no time in looking around for "some good, steady\r\nposition" in a magazine office. My writing I could do at night.\r\n\r\n"It\'s so uncertain at best," he said. "It\'s nothing you can count on.\r\nAnd you\'ve got to think of a wife and children. _Her_ father has no\r\nmoney saved."\r\n\r\nI found he\'d been looking Dillon up, and this jarred on me horribly. But\r\nstill worse was his lack of faith in my writing. I was making four\r\nhundred dollars a month, and it was a most unpleasant jolt to have it\r\ntaken so lightly.\r\n\r\nI went down to Sue. As I came into the living room she met me suddenly\r\nat the door. In a moment her arms were about my neck and she was saying\r\nsoftly:\r\n\r\n"I know what it is, dear, and I\'m glad--I\'m awfully glad. If I\'ve been\r\nhorrid about it ever, please forgive me. I\'m sure now it\'s just the life\r\nyou want!"\r\n\r\nAnd that evening, while Dad slept in his chair, Sue and I had a long\r\naffectionate talk. We drew closer than we had been for months. She was\r\neager to hear everything, she wanted to know all our plans. When I tried\r\nat last to turn our talk to herself and our affairs at home, at first\r\nshe would not hear to it.\r\n\r\n"My dear boy," she said affectionately, "you\'ve had these worries long\r\nenough. You\'re to run along now and be happy and leave this house to Dad\r\nand me."\r\n\r\nI slipped my arm around her:\r\n\r\n"Look here, Sis, let\'s see this right. You can\'t run here on what Dad\r\nearns, and if you try to work yourself you\'ll only hurt him terribly. My\r\nidea is to help as before, without letting him know that I\'m doing it.\r\nMake him think you\'ve cut expenses."\r\n\r\nIt took a long time to get her consent.\r\n\r\nThe next night I went to Eleanore\'s father. He received me quietly, and\r\nwith a deep intensity under that steady smile of his, which reminded me\r\nso much of hers, he spoke of all she had meant to him and of her brave\r\nsearch for a big, happy life. He told how he had watched her with me\r\nslowly making up her mind.\r\n\r\n"It took a long time, but it\'s made up now," he said. "And now that it\r\nis, she\'s the kind that will go through anything for you that can ever\r\ncome up in your life." He looked at me squarely, still smiling a little,\r\nfrankly letting his new affection come into his eyes. "I wish I knew all\r\nthat\'s going to happen," he added, almost sadly. "I hope you\'ll get used\r\nto telling me things--talking things over--anything--no matter\r\nwhat--where I can be of the slightest help."\r\n\r\nThen he, too, spoke of money. He meant to keep up her allowance, he\r\nsaid, and he had insured his life for her. Again, as with my father, I\r\nfelt that disturbing lack of faith in my work. I spoke of it to Eleanore\r\nand she looked at me indignantly.\r\n\r\n"You must never think of it like that," she said. "I won\'t have you\r\nwriting for money. Dad has never worked that way and you\'re not to do it\r\non any account--least of all on account of me. Whatever you make we\'ll\r\nlive on, and that\'s all there is to be said--except that we\'ll live\r\nsplendidly," she added very gaily, "and we won\'t spend the finest part\r\nof our lives saving up for rainy days. We\'ll take care of the rain when\r\nit rains, and we\'ll have some wonderful times while we can."\r\n\r\nWe decided at once on a trip abroad as soon as I had finished my work.\r\nAnd I remember writing hard, and reading it aloud to her and rewriting\r\nover and over again, for Eleanore could be severe. But I remember, too,\r\nmore trips in her boat to gather the last odds and ends. I remember how\r\nthe big harbor took on a new glory to our eyes, mingled with all the\r\ndeep personal joys and small troubles and crises we went through, the\r\npuzzles and the questionings and the glad discoveries that made up the\r\nswift growth of our love.\r\n\r\nAnd though I never once thought of Joe Kramer, he had prophesied\r\naright. I belonged wholly now to Dillon\'s world, a world of clean\r\nvigorous order that seemed to welcome me the more as I wrote in praise\r\nof its power. And happy over my success, and in love and starting life\r\nanew with all the signs so bright--how could I have any doubts of my\r\nharbor?\r\n\r\nWe were married very quietly late one April afternoon. It rained, I\r\nremember, all that day, but the next was bright and clear for our\r\nsailing. In our small stateroom on the ship we found a note from the\r\ncompany, a large, engraved impressive affair, presenting their best\r\nwishes and asking us to accept for the voyage one of their most\r\nluxurious cabins.\r\n\r\n"This is what comes," said Eleanore gaily, "of being the wife of a\r\nwriter."\r\n\r\n"Or the daughter," I said softly, "of a very wonderful engineer."\r\n\r\n"You darling boy!"\r\n\r\nWe moved up to a large sunny cabin. I remember her swiftly reading the\r\ntelegrams and letters there as though to get them all out of the way. I\r\nremember her unpacking and taking possession of our first home.\r\n\r\n"We\'re married, aren\'t we," said a voice.\r\n\r\nThere was only one more good-by to be said. On the deck, as we went out\r\nof the harbor, Eleanore stood by the rail. I felt her hand close tight\r\non mine and I saw her eyes glisten a little with tears.\r\n\r\n"What a splendid place it has been," she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWe found every place splendid in those weeks as we let the wanderlust\r\ncarry us on. And as though emerging from some vivid dream, various\r\nplaces and faces of people stand out in my memory now, as then they\r\nloomed in upon our absorption.\r\n\r\nI remember the little old harbor of Cherbourg, gleaming in the\r\nmoonlight, where when we landed Eleanore said, "Let\'s stay here awhile."\r\nSo of course we did, and then went on to Paris. We took an apartment,\r\nvery French and absurdly small, from a former Beaux Arts friend of mine.\r\nI remember the kindly face of the maid who took such beaming care of us,\r\nthe cafe in front of which late at night we sat and watched the huge\r\nshadowy carts go by on their way to the market halls, the sunrise flower\r\nmarket, where we filled our cab with moss roses and plants, Polin\'s\r\nsongs in the "Ambassadeurs," delicious petites allees in the Bois, our\r\nfavorite rides on the tops of the \'buses, that old religious place of\r\nmine down under the bridge by Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nAll these and more we saw in fragments, now and then, looking out with\r\nvivid interest on all the life around us, only to return to each other,\r\n_into_ each other I should say, for the exploring was quite different\r\nnow, there had been such hours between us that nothing intimate could be\r\nheld back. Nothing? Well, nothing that I thought of then. For somehow or\r\nother, in those glad, eager afternoons and evenings, in those nights,\r\nnothing disturbingly ugly in me so much as thought of showing its head.\r\nThree years before in this stirring town I had felt guilty at being a\r\nmonk. But now I felt no guilt at all. For down the Champs Elysees our\r\ncab rolled serenely now, and even our driver\'s white hat wore an air as\r\nthough it had a place in life.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris we started for Munich, but we did not stop there, we happened\r\nto feel like going on. So we went through to Constantinople, whence we\r\ntook a boat to Batoum and went up into the Caucasus, which Eleanore had\r\nheard about once from an engineer friend of her father\'s. I remember\r\nKoutais, a little town by a mountain torrent with gray vine-covered\r\nwalls around it. Shops opened into the walls like stalls. There we would\r\nbuy things for our supper and then in a crazy vehicle we would drive\r\nmiles out on the broad mountainside to an orchard pink with blossoms,\r\nwhere we would build a fire and cook, and an old man in a long yellow\r\nrobe and with a turban on his head would come out of his cabin and bring\r\nus wine. And the stars would appear and the frogs tune up in the marshes\r\nfar down in the valley below, and the filmy mists would rise and the\r\nmountains would tower overhead. And the effect of this place upon us was\r\nto make us feel it was only one of innumerable such vacation places that\r\nlay ahead, festival spots in long, radiant lives. We felt this vaguely,\r\nsilently. So often we talked silently.\r\n\r\nThen there would come the most serious times, when with the deepest\r\nthoughtfulness we would survey the years ahead and very solemnly place\r\nourselves, our views and beliefs. Miraculous how agreed we were! We\r\nbelieved, we found, in good workmanship, in honest building, in getting\r\nthings done. We believed in Eleanore\'s father and all those around and\r\nabove him that could help his kind of work. We were impatient of\r\nsoft-headedness in rich people who had nothing to do, and of heavy\r\nmuddle-headedness in the millions who had too much to do, and of\r\nmuckraking of every kind which only got in the way of the builders. For\r\nthe building of a new, clean vigorous world was our religion. And it did\r\nnot seem cold to us, because our lives were in it and because we were\r\nin love.\r\n\r\nThere was no end to the plans for ourselves, for my writing, our home,\r\nthe friends we wanted, the trips, the books and the music. And through\r\nit all and from under it all there kept bursting up that feeling which\r\nwe knew was the most important of all, the exultant realization that we\r\ntwo were just starting out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen at last we came back home this feeling took a deeper turn. I\r\nnoticed a change in Eleanore. She had far less thought and time for me\r\nnow, she seemed to be strangely absorbed in herself. Nearly all her time\r\nand strength were given to our small apartment, in the same building as\r\nthat of her father. By countless feminine touches she was making it look\r\nlike the home she had planned. She was getting all in order. And then\r\none night she told me why. Her arms were close around me and her voice\r\nwas so low I could barely hear:\r\n\r\n"There\'s going to be another soon--another one _of us_--do you hear?--a\r\nvery tiny blessed one."\r\n\r\nI held her slowly tighter.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my darling girl," I whispered.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I relaxed my hold, for I was afraid of hurting her now. In a\r\nmoment all was so utterly changed. And as in that brave, quiet way of\r\nhers she looked smiling steadily into my eyes, my throat contracted\r\nsharply. For into my mind leaped the memory of what the harbor had shown\r\nto me on that sultry hideous summer night in the tenement over in\r\nBrooklyn. And _that_ must happen to _my wife_!\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear," she whispered, "if you only knew how much strength I\r\nstored up way over there in the mountains."\r\n\r\nSo she had been thinking of this even then, and yet had told me nothing!\r\n\r\nHere was the beginning of a long anxious period. Month after month I\r\nwatched her quietly preparing. Slowly we drew into ourselves, while her\r\nfather and mine and Sue and our friends came and went, but mattered\r\nlittle. I wondered if Dillon ever felt this. As he came down to us in\r\nthe evenings from the apartment upstairs, where he and Eleanore had\r\nmeant so much to each other only a year before, he gave no sign that he\r\nsaw any change. But one night after he had gone, Eleanore happened to\r\npick up the evening paper which had dropped from his bulging overcoat\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n"Billy, come here," she said presently.\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Look at this."\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States had gone with Eleanore\'s father that\r\nday in a revenue cutter over the harbor and had spoken of Dillon\'s great\r\ndream in vigorous terms of approval.\r\n\r\n"And father was here this evening," said Eleanore very slowly, "and yet\r\nhe never told me a word. He saw that I\'d heard nothing and he thought I\r\ndidn\'t care. Oh, Billy, I feel so ashamed."\r\n\r\nBut she soon forgot the incident.\r\n\r\nMy suspense grew sharp as the time drew near. I had a good doctor, I was\r\nsure of that, and he told me he had an excellent nurse. But what good\r\nwere all these puny precautions? The tenement room in Brooklyn kept\r\nrising in my mind.\r\n\r\nShe sat by the window that last night, and looking down on the far-away\r\nlights of the river we planned another trip abroad.\r\n\r\nA few hours later I stood over her, holding her hand, and with her white\r\nlips pressed close together and her eyes shut, she went through one of\r\nthose terrible spasms. Then she looked up in the moment\'s relief. And\r\nsuddenly here was that smile of hers. And she said low, between clenched\r\nteeth,\r\n\r\n"Well, dearie, another starting out----"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after the rush of relief at the news of Eleanore\'s\r\nsafety and the strange sight of our tiny son, I felt keyed gloriously\r\nhigh, ready for anything under the sun. But there seemed to be nothing\r\nwhatever to do, I felt in the way each time that I moved, so I took to\r\nmy old refuge, work. And then into my small workroom came Eleanore\'s\r\nfather for a long talk. He too had been up all night, his lean face was\r\nheavily marked from the strain, but their usual deep serenity had come\r\nback into his quiet eyes.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s take a day off," he said, smiling. "We\'re both so tired we don\'t\r\nknow it."\r\n\r\n"Tired?" I demanded.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "you\'re tired--more than you\'ve ever been in your life.\r\nYou\'ll feel like a rag by to-morrow, and then I hope you\'ll take a good\r\nrest. But to-day, while you are still way up, I want to talk about your\r\nwork. Do you mind?"\r\n\r\n"Mind? No," I replied, a bit anxiously. "It\'s just what I\'m trying to\r\nfigure out."\r\n\r\n"I know you are. You\'ve figured for months and you\'ve worked yourself\r\nthin. I don\'t mind that, I like it, because I know the reason. But I\r\ndon\'t think the result has been good. It seems to me you\'ve been so\r\nanxious to get on, because of this large family of yours, that you\'ve\r\nshut yourself up and written too fast, you\'ve gotten rather away from\r\nlife. Shall I go right on?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, watching intently.\r\n\r\n"Well," he continued, "you\'ve been using what name you\'ve already made\r\nand writing short stories of harbor life."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what the editors want," I said. "When a man makes a hit in one\r\nvein of writing they want that and nothing else."\r\n\r\n"At this rate you\'ll soon work out the vein," he said. "I\'d like to see\r\nyou stop writing now, take time to find new ground--and dig."\r\n\r\n"There\'s not an awful lot of time," I remarked.\r\n\r\n"My plan won\'t stop your making money," he replied. "I want you to write\r\nless, but get more pay."\r\n\r\n"That sounds attractive. How shall I do it?"\r\n\r\n"By writing about big men," he said. "I suggest that you try a series of\r\nportraits of some of the big Americans and the America they know."\r\n\r\nI jumped up so suddenly he started.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" he asked with a glance at the door. "Did you hear\r\nanything?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said excitedly. "I heard a stunning title! The America They\r\nKnow!"\r\n\r\nWe discussed it all that morning and it appealed to me more and more.\r\nLater on, with Eleanore\'s help (for she grew stronger fast those days),\r\nI prevailed upon her father to let me practice upon himself as my first\r\nsubject. I worked fast, my material right at hand, and within a few\r\nweeks I had written the story of those significant incidents out of\r\nthirty years of work and wanderings east and west that showed the\r\nAmerica he had known, his widening view. I did his portrait, so to\r\nspeak, with his back to the reader, letting the reader see what he saw.\r\nThis story I sold promptly, and under the tonic of that success I went\r\ninto the work with zest and vim.\r\n\r\nIt filled the next four years of my life. It took the view I had had of\r\nthe harbor and widened it to embrace the whole land, which I now saw\r\naltogether through the eyes of the men at the top.\r\n\r\nThe most central figure of them all, and by far the most difficult to\r\nattack, was a powerful New York banker, one of those invisible gods\r\nwhose hand I had felt on the harbor.\r\n\r\n"The value of him to you," Dillon said, "is that if you can only make\r\nhim talk you\'ll find him a born storyteller. The secret scandal of his\r\nlife is that once in a short vacation he tried to write a play."\r\n\r\nIt was weeks before he would see me, and I had my first interview at\r\nlast only by getting on a night train which he had taken for Cleveland.\r\nThere in his stateroom, cornered, he received me with a grim reluctance.\r\nAnd with a humorous glint in his eyes,\r\n\r\n"How much do you know about banking?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," I said frankly. And then I took a sudden chance. "What do you\r\nknow about writing?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," he said placidly.\r\n\r\n"Is that true? I thought you once wrote a play." He sat up very quickly.\r\n"If you did," I went on, "you\'ve probably read some of Shakespeare\'s\r\nstuff. It was strong stuff about strong men. If he were alive he\'d write\r\nabout you, but I\'m sure that he wouldn\'t know about banking. That\'s only\r\nyour job."\r\n\r\n"What do you want of me, young man?" he inquired. "Is it my soul?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," I answered. "It\'s the America you know, expressed in such\r\nsimple human terms that even a young ignoramus like me will be able to\r\nunderstand it. Out of this big country a good many thousands of men, I\r\nsuppose, have come to you for money. Which are the most significant\r\nones?"\r\n\r\nAnd I went on to explain my idea. Soon it began to take hold of him. We\r\ntalked until after midnight, and later we had other talks. It was hard\r\nat first in the questioning to dodge the technical side of it all, the\r\nwidely intricate workings of that machine of credit of which he was\r\nchief engineer. But as he saw how eager I was to feel his view and\r\nbecome enthused, by degrees he humanized it all. And not only that, he\r\ntrusted me, he gave me the most intimate glimpses into this life of big\r\nmoney, although when I dared to include such bits in the story that I\r\nshowed him he calmly scratched them out and said:\r\n\r\n"You\'re mistaken, young man. I didn\'t say that."\r\n\r\nAs he talked I saw again that vision I had had on the North River docks.\r\nFor into this man\'s office had come the men of the mines, the factories\r\nand the mills, the promoters of vast irrigations on prairies, builders\r\nof railroads, real estate plungers, street traction promoters,\r\ndepartment store owners, newspaper proprietors, politicians--the\r\nbuilders and boomers, the strong energetic men of the land. He showed me\r\ntheir power and made me feel it was still but in its infancy. He made me\r\nfeel a dazzling future rushing upon us, a future of plenty still more\r\ncontrolled by the keen minds and wide visions of the powerful men at the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nOf all these men and the rushing world of power they lived in, I have\r\nonly a jumble of memories now. For my own life was a jumble--irregular,\r\ncrowded and intense. In their offices, clubs and homes, in their motors,\r\non yachts and trains, in Chicago and Pittsburgh and other cities, I\r\nfollowed them, making my time suit theirs. Some had no use for me at\r\nall, but I found others delighted to talk--like the great Dakota\r\nranchman who ordered twenty thousand copies of the issue in which his\r\nstory appeared and scattered them like seeds of fame over the various\r\ncounties of wheat, corn and alfalfa he owned. And in the main I had\r\nlittle trouble. I met often that curious respect which so many men of\r\naffairs seem to have, God knows why, for a successful writer.\r\n\r\nI got in where men with ten times my knowledge were barred. I remember\r\nwith a touch of shame the institute of scientific research where the\r\nchief of the place took a whole afternoon to show me around, and while I\r\nlooked wise and tried to feel thrilled over glass tubes and jars and\r\nmicroscopes through which I peered at microbes, a simple old country\r\ndoctor, one of the thousands of _common_ visitors, by my invitation\r\nfollowed humbly in my wake, murmuring from time to time,\r\n\r\n"Miraculous, by George, astounding!" And gratefully pressing my hand at\r\nthe end, "This has been the chance of a lifetime," he said.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the principal reason why I got so warm a welcome was the name I\r\nhad already made as a writer of glory stories. I liked these men; I\r\nliked to enthuse over all the big things they were doing. And still true\r\nto my efficiency god, the immense importance of getting things done\r\nloomed so high in my view of life as to overshadow everything else. My\r\nsense of moral values changed.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange unmoral world.\r\n\r\nIn the institute of science these keen laboratory gods (who had seemed\r\nso cold and comfortless to me but a few short years ago) were perfecting\r\na cure for syphilis. Strong men were removing the wages of sin!\r\n\r\nIn Chicago I met the president of a huge industrial company who had\r\nfound it necessary at times to use money on politicians. For this he had\r\nbeen sent to jail, but later his influence got him out. Promptly he was\r\nmade treasurer of another company. In one year, through his energy, now\r\nmore intense than ever, the business of that company increased some\r\nthirty-five per cent., whereupon the directors of the original\r\ncorporation, after a stormy meeting in which two church deacon directors\r\nfussed and fumed considerably, unanimously decided to ask him to come\r\nback. He did. He told me the story quite frankly himself. I admired him\r\ntremendously.\r\n\r\nThe head of a mining company sat in his office one afternoon and talked\r\nof the labor problem. There was no right or wrong involved, he said, it\r\nwas simply a matter of force. Once when a strike threatened he had\r\ncalled in a "labor expert" who had used money wholesale and there had\r\nbeen no strike.\r\n\r\n"Well?" he asked, smiling. "What do you think of it?"\r\n\r\n"I think I can\'t print it." He still smiled.\r\n\r\n"Naturally not. But what do you think? If you yourself were responsible\r\nto several hundred stockholders, what would you do? Risk a strike that\r\nmight wipe out their dividends? Or would you resort to bribery"--his\r\nsmile slowly deepened--"which is a penal offense in this State?"\r\n\r\nI found such questions cropping up almost everywhere I went. In their\r\ndealings with the public and still more with their rivals, there was a\r\nruthless vigor that swept old-fashioned maxims aside. And I liked this,\r\nfor it got things done! I was bored to find, as I often did, these men\r\nin their homes quite old-fashioned again to suit sober old wives who\r\nstill went to church. I remember one such elderly lady and the shock I\r\nunwittingly gave her. She had deplored the decline of churches; her own,\r\nshe said, was barely half full. And I then tried to cheer her by an\r\naccount of my last story, which was of an advertising man, a genius who\r\nin the last two years had made churches his especial line and by his\r\nup-to-date methods had packed church after church on a commission basis.\r\nHer burst of disapproval almost drove me from the house. And there were\r\nso many homes like that. Men who were perfect giants by day would become\r\nthe gentlest babies at night, allowing their wives to read to them such\r\nsentimental drivel as would have been kicked from the office by day.\r\n\r\n"But God knows they need such vacuous homes," I reflected, "to rest in."\r\n\r\nI had never dreamed before how strenuous men\'s lives could be. One day\r\nin the New York office of a big plunger in real estate I pointed to a\r\nmap on the wall.\r\n\r\n"What are all those lots marked \'vacant\' for?" I asked him. "I never saw\r\nmany vacant lots in that part of town." He grinned cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"Anything under four stories is vacant to us," he answered, "because it\r\npays to buy it, tear it down and build something higher."\r\n\r\nThat was the way they crowded their cities, and as with their cities, so\r\nwith their lives. One story that interested me most was of the weird\r\nAmerica which a renowned nerve specialist knew. To him came these men\r\nbroken down, some on the verge of insanity. He gave me stories of their\r\nlives, of his glimpses into their straining minds, he described their\r\npathetic efforts to rest, their strenuous attempts to relax. He himself\r\nhad some mysterious ailment, his hands kept trembling while he talked.\r\nHis wife said he hadn\'t had a vacation of over a week in eleven years.\r\n\r\nFrom such men I would turn to exuberant lives, like that of the Tammany\r\nleader now dead, who gave a ten-thousand-dollar banquet one night, in\r\nthe Ten Eyck in Albany, in honor of the newsboy who every morning for\r\ntwenty-two winters had brought morning papers to him in bed in his hotel\r\nroom. Or like that of the millionaire merchant who told me with the most\r\nnaive pride of the eleven hundred electric lights in his new home on\r\nFifth Avenue, and of how the bathrooms of both his large daughters were\r\nfitted in solid silver throughout.\r\n\r\n"Not plated, understand," he said. "I told the architect while he was at\r\nit to put in the real solid stuff--and plenty of it!"\r\n\r\nThrough this varied throng of successes, this rich abundance of types, I\r\nranged with an ever deepening zest. As a hunter of game I watched that\r\nendless human procession on and off the front pages of papers, the men\r\nwho were for the moment news. Often small people too would be\r\nthere--like the telephone girl from a suburb, who for one day, as the\r\nmost important witness in a sensational case of graft, was suddenly\r\nbefore the whole country and then as suddenly dropped out of sight. In\r\nfact, that was now my view of the land, figures emerging from dark\r\nobscure multitudes up into a bright circle of light.\r\n\r\nAnd I took this front-page view of New York. I saw it as a city where\r\nbig exceptional people were endlessly doing sensational things, both in\r\nthe making and spending of money. I saw it not only as a cluster of tall\r\nbuildings far downtown, but uptown as well a towering pile of rich\r\nhotels and apartments, a region that sparkled gaily at night, lights\r\nflashing from tens of thousands of rooms, in and out of which, I felt\r\ndelightedly, millions of people had passed through the years. I loved to\r\nlook up at these windows at night, at the sheer inscrutability of them.\r\nFor behind these twinkling masses I knew were all things tragic,\r\ncomic--people laughing, fighting, hating, scheming, dreaming, loving,\r\nliving. I thought of that row of cabins de luxe that I had seen on the\r\nChristmas boat. Here was the same thing magnified, a monstrous\r\ncaravansary with but one question over its doors: "Have You Got the\r\nPrice?"\r\n\r\nOnce I had seen a harbor. Then it had grown into a port. And now I saw a\r\nmetropolis, the hub of a successful land.\r\n\r\nAnd through this gay city of triumph I moved, myself a success, and my\r\nview of the whole was colored by that. My life as an observer was\r\nsprinkled with personal moments that made me see everything in high\r\nlights. I would watch the life of a street full of people, and I myself\r\nwould be on my way to an interview with some noted man or coming away\r\nfrom one who had given me stuff that I knew would write up big--I knew\r\njust how! Or at a corner newsstand I would catch a glimpse of my name on\r\nthe cover of some magazine. Again I would be hurrying home, or into a\r\nneighboring florist\'s or a theater ticket office, or diving into the\r\njolly whirl of the large Fifth Avenue toy shop in which I took an\r\nunflagging delight. In my mind would be thoughts of a pillow fight or a\r\nlong evening with Eleanore, or we would be having friends to dine or\r\ngoing out to dinner.\r\n\r\nFor Eleanore had been swift to use my success to broaden both our lives.\r\nYoung and adorably happy, eagerly alive, she did for me what she had\r\ndone for her father, filling my life with other lives. She was an artist\r\nin living. It was a joy to see her make out a list of people to be asked\r\nto dine. Her father, once watching the process, remarked to me in low,\r\nsolemn tones:\r\n\r\n"She\'s a regular social chemist--who has never had an explosion."\r\n\r\nHe was often on the list, and through him and his many friends and the\r\nones I made through my writing, by degrees our circle widened. We met\r\nall kinds of people, for Eleanore hated "sets" and "cliques." We met not\r\nonly successful men but (God help us sometimes) we also met their wives.\r\nWe met successful writers, artists and musicians, and a few people of\r\nthe stage. We met visitors from the West and from half the big cities of\r\nEurope. We furbished up our French and German, our knowledge of books\r\nand pictures and plays--_successful_ books and pictures and plays.\r\n\r\nThrough Eleanore\'s father and his work our minds were still held to the\r\npast, to the harbor which had taken me, bruised and blind and petty, and\r\nlifted me up and taught me to live, had given me my work, my home and my\r\nnew god. I was grateful, I was proud, I was in love and I felt strong.\r\nAnd my view of the harbor in those days was of a glorious symbol of the\r\npower of mind over matter, and of the mighty speeding up of a world of\r\ncivilization and peace, a successful world, strong, broad, tolerant,\r\nsweeping on and bearing us with it.\r\n\r\nSo we adventured gaily, not deeper down, but higher and higher up into\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had been married four years.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a crisp November day I was just about starting home. I\r\nremember how keenly alive I felt, how tingling with bodily health, and\r\nabove all how successful.\r\n\r\nI had had such a successful day. I had written hard all morning and my\r\nwork had been going splendidly. I had lunched downtown with the man\r\nwhose life I was writing that month, a man of astounding fertility, who\r\nhad started fifteen years ago with a small hotel in a western town, had\r\nmade money, had built a larger hotel, had made money, had moved to a\r\nlarger town and bought a still larger hotel, had made money, had moved\r\nto Chicago, New York, had made money. And the America he knew was made\r\nup of people who themselves had made their money so suddenly they had to\r\ncome to hotels to spend it. The stories that he told me, both scandalous\r\nand otherwise, of these men and women who shot up rich and diamondy out\r\nof this booming country of ours, had a range and a richness of color\r\nthat had held me delighted through many long talks. During luncheon he\r\nhad told some of his best, and had given me permission to print, with a\r\ndiscreet twist or so to disguise them, certain intimate episodes in the\r\nfirst fat years of men whose names were by-words now all over the land.\r\nI could already see that story selling on the newsstands.\r\n\r\nFrom this man I had come uptown to a branch of the Y. M. C. A., where\r\nafter an hour of hand-ball and a plunge in the swimming tank I had gone\r\nto a room downstairs, to which ambitious youngsters came for free advice\r\nfrom an expert who told them how to get on in life. His room was a\r\nconfessional. He would cross-examine each suppliant hard, make a\r\ndiagnosis of each one and then give him advice as to what to do--whether\r\nor not to throw over his job, what kind of work he was suited for best.\r\nThe America he knew was made up of these small human units, some\r\npitiably or absurdly small, but all anxiously straining upward. And they\r\ntoo appealed to me.\r\n\r\nFor I was so successful now that I was growing mellow. From certain big\r\nmen I had written about I had taken a spacious breadth of view that\r\nincluded a deep indulgence for all these skurrying pigmies. Poor little\r\ndevils, give \'em a chance, especially those among them who had "bim"\r\nenough to want a chance, to wonder why they were not getting on and want\r\nto do something about it. And so I had formed the habit of dropping in\r\noften at this room, hearing its confessions and now and then helping get\r\nsomeone a job. As the swimming tank made my body tingle, so this place\r\naffected my soul. It warmed me to do all I could for some fellow, some\r\ndecent kid who was down on his luck. Besides, some confessions were gems\r\nof their kind, glimpses into human lives, hard struggles, wild\r\nambitions. I meant to write them up some day. In fact, I meant to write\r\neverything up, I felt everything waiting for my pen.\r\n\r\nAnd as I went down to the coat-room, the thought I had had so often\r\nlately came again into my mind. I too would soon throw over my job,\r\nleave articles and write fiction--my old Paris dream. But what a wide\r\nand varied experience of life I had gathered since those ingenuous Paris\r\ndays. Yes, I would do it real and big, out of the big life I had known.\r\nAnd my heroes would no longer be watching at my elbow to point to the\r\nchoicest bits and say, "You\'re mistaken, young man, I never said that."\r\nNo, all those lifelike human touches would stay in. Stories kept coming\r\nup in my mind, one especially of late. As I stood in line for my hat and\r\ncoat I thought of it now and grew so absorbed I forgot that I was\r\nstanding in a line of insignificant clerks--until the one ahead of me,\r\nwho had just come in from the street, asked the chap in front of him:\r\n\r\n"Say, Gus, did you see the suffragettes? Their parade\'s just going by."\r\n\r\nThis brought me down from the clouds with a jerk. For I had meant to see\r\nthat parade. Sue was in it, in it hard. Suffrage was her latest fad.\r\n\r\n"Naw," growled Gus. "If I was the mayor and they came to me for a permit\r\nto march I\'d tell \'em to go and buy corsets. That\'s their complaint.\r\nThey can\'t get kissed so they want to vote." The other one chuckled:\r\n\r\n"I saw one who can have my vote--and all I\'ll ask is a better look.\r\nBelieve me, some silk stockings!"\r\n\r\nAs they went away I glared after them. "Damn little muts," I thought. I\r\nwas rather in favor of suffrage, at least I felt indulgent about it. Why\r\nshouldn\'t I be? The great thing was to keep your mind open and kindly,\r\nto feel contempt for nothing whatever. And because I felt contempt for\r\nno thing or person in all the world, I now glared with the most utter\r\ncontempt on these narrow-minded little clerks.\r\n\r\nThen I hurried out and over to Fifth Avenue, where the throb of the\r\ndrums was still to be heard. And there I found to my surprise that in a\r\nvery real sense this parade was different from anything that I had ever\r\nseen before. I was more than indulgent, I was excited. And by what? Not\r\nby the marching lines of figures, fluttering banners, booming bands, nor\r\njust by the fact that these marchers were women, and women quite frankly\r\ndressed for effect, so that the whole rhythmic mass had a feminine color\r\nand dash that made it all gay and delightful. No, there was something\r\ndeeper. And that something, I finally made out, was this. These women\r\nand girls were all deeply thrilled by the feeling that for the first\r\ntime in their lives they were doing something all together--for an idea\r\nthat each one of them had thought rather big and stirring before, but\r\nnow, as each felt herself a part of this moving, swinging multitude, she\r\nfelt the idea suddenly loom so infinitely larger and more compelling\r\nthan before that she herself was astounded. Here for the first time in\r\nmy life I felt the power of mass action.\r\n\r\nAnd as presently I started home and the intensity of it was gone, there\r\nwas an added pleasure to me in remembering how I had felt it. Another\r\nproof of my breadth of mind. I hurried home to dinner.\r\n\r\nAs I entered our apartment I gave a long, low mysterious whistle. And\r\nafter a moment another whistle, which tried hard to be mysterious,\r\nanswered mine from another room. Then there were stealthy footsteps\r\nwhich ended in a sudden charge, and my wee son, "the Indian," hurled me\r\nonto a sofa, where, to use his expression, we "rush-housed" each other.\r\nWe did this almost every night.\r\n\r\nWhen the big time was about over Eleanore appeared:\r\n\r\n"Come, Indian, it\'s time for bed." She led him off protesting and blew\r\nme back a kiss from the door.\r\n\r\nShe had developed wonderfully, this bewitching wife of mine, this quiet\r\nable one in her work, this smiling humorous one in her life, this\r\nwatchful, joyous, intimate one in the hours that shut everything out.\r\nSue said I idolized my wife, that I saw her all perfection, "without one\r\nredeeming vice." Not at all. I knew her vices well enough. I knew she\r\ncould get distinctly cross when a new gown came home all wrong. I knew\r\nthat she could lie to me, I had caught her at it several times when she\r\nsaid she was feeling finely and then confessed to me the next day, "I\r\nhad a splitting headache last night." In fact, she had any number of\r\nvices--queer, mysterious feminine moods when she quite shamelessly shut\r\nme out. She didn\'t half take care of herself, she went places when she\r\nshould have stayed at home. And finally, she was slow at dressing.\r\nPlacidly seated in front of her mirror she could spend an entire hour in\r\ndoing her soft luxuriant hair.\r\n\r\nI went over all these vices now as I lay back on the sofa. Idolize her?\r\nNot at all. I knew her. We were married, thank God.\r\n\r\nThen she came back into the room. She was smiling in rather a curious\r\nway, an expectant way, and I noticed that her color was unusually high.\r\nEleanore always dressed so well, but to-night she had outdone herself.\r\nFrom her trim blue satin slippers to the demure little band of blue at\r\nher throat she was more enchantingly fresh than ever. Suffragettes and\r\nthat sort of thing were all very well on the Avenue. Give me Eleanore at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n"Did you see the parade?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Did you see me?"\r\n\r\nI fairly jumped!\r\n\r\n"You?" I demanded. "Were you in that march?"\r\n\r\n"I most certainly was," she said quietly. Having shot her bolt she was\r\nregarding me gravely now, with the merest glint of amused delight\r\nsomewhere in her gray-blue eyes. "Why not?" she asked. "I believe in it,\r\nI want the vote. Why shouldn\'t I march? I paraded," she added serenely,\r\n"in the college section right up near the head of the line. That\'s why\r\nI\'m home so early. I\'m afraid I was quite conspicuous, for you see I\'m\r\nrather small and I had to take long swinging strides to keep in step.\r\nBut I soon got used to it, and I thoroughly enjoyed the cheers. We waved\r\nback at them with our flags."\r\n\r\n"But," I cried, "my darling wife! Why didn\'t you tell me about it\r\nahead?"\r\n\r\n"Because"--she came close up to me and said quite confidentially, "we\r\ndo these things all by ourselves. You don\'t mean to say that you mind\r\nit, dear?"\r\n\r\nI lost about five seconds and then I did exactly right. I took her in my\r\narms and laughed and called my wife by many names and said she couldn\'t\r\nworry me, that I didn\'t mind it in the least, was proud of her and so\r\non. In short, to use a slang expression, I distinctly got away with it.\r\nMoreover, I soon felt what I said. I was honestly rather proud of my\r\nwife for having had the nerve to march. It must have been quite a\r\nstruggle, for she was no born marcher.\r\n\r\nAnd I was glad that I was proud. Another proof of my tolerance--which\r\nwas the more grateful to me just now because a magazine man I admired\r\nhad genially hinted the other day that I was rather narrow.\r\n\r\n"Did you see Sue?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"Only for a moment," she said. "Sue was one of the marshals and she was\r\nall up and down the lines. She\'s coming to supper with many paraders."\r\n\r\n"A crowd of women here? I\'m off!"\r\n\r\n"No you\'re not. She\'s bringing some men paraders too."\r\n\r\nMen paraders! Now I could smile. I had earned the right, I had been\r\nbroad. But after all, there are limits. I could see those chaps parading\r\nwith women. I knew them, I had seen them before, for Sue had often\r\nbrought them here. I enjoyed myself immensely--till Eleanore shot\r\nanother bolt.\r\n\r\n"Smile on, funny one," she said. "You\'ll be in line yourself in a year."\r\n\r\n"I will not be in line!"\r\n\r\n"I wonder." She looked at me in a curious way. The mirth went slowly out\r\nof her eyes. "There are so many queer new ideas crowding in all around\r\nus," she said. "And I know you, Billy, oh, so well--so much better than\r\nyou know yourself. I know that when you once feel a thing you\'re just\r\nthe kind to go into it hard. I\'m not speaking of suffrage now--that\'s\r\nonly one nice little part. I mean this whole big radical movement--all\r\nthe kind of thing your friend Joe Kramer stood for." She put her arms\r\nabout my neck. "Don\'t get too radical, husband mine--you\'re so nice and\r\nfunny now, my love."\r\n\r\nI regarded her anxiously:\r\n\r\n"Has this parade gone to your head--or has Sue been talking to you\r\nagain?"\r\n\r\n"I lunched with Sue----"\r\n\r\n"I knew it! And now she\'s coming here to supper--bringing men paraders!"\r\n\r\n"And they\'ll all be rabidly hungry," said Eleanore with a sudden change.\r\nShe went quickly in to see the cook and left me to grim meditation.\r\n\r\nI a radical? I smiled. And my slight uneasiness passed away, as I\r\nthought about my sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor old Sue. What queer friends she had, what a muddled life compared\r\nto ours. What a vague confused development, jumping from one idea to\r\nanother, never seeing any job through, forever starting all over again\r\nwith the same feverish absorption in the next new radical fad. High-brow\r\ndramatics, the settlement movement, the post-impressionists, socialism,\r\nvotes for women, one thing after the other pell mell. She would work\r\nherself all up, live hard, talk, organize, think and feel till her\r\nnerves went all to pieces, and then she would come to us for a rest and\r\nlaugh at us for our restfulness and at herself for the state she was in.\r\nThat was one thing at least she had learned--to laugh at herself--she\r\ncould be deliciously humorous. And Eleanore, meeting her on that ground,\r\nwould quiet her and steady her down.\r\n\r\nWe had grown very fond of Sue. We knew her life was not easy at home.\r\nAlone over there with poor old Dad and feeling herself anchored down,\r\nshe would still at intervals rebel--against his sticking to his dull\r\njob, against her own dependence, against the small monthly allowance\r\nwhich without my father\'s knowledge they still had from me.\r\n\r\n"Let me earn my own living!" she would exclaim. "Why shouldn\'t I? I\'m\r\ntwenty-six--and I\'m working hard enough as it is--the Lord knows! I\'m\r\norganizing every day and making speeches half my nights. Other girls\r\ntake pay for that. Now Father, please be sensible. I\'m going to take a\r\ngood salaried job."\r\n\r\nBut then Dad, whose mind was so old and rigid, so much less tolerant\r\nthan mine, would grow excited or, still worse, ashamed that he couldn\'t\r\nmake money enough to give her all she wanted. And that desperate hungry\r\nlove with which he clung to her these latter days would in the end make\r\nher give in. For under all her radical talk Sue had the kindest heart in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nEleanore did her best to help. She was always having Dad over to dinner,\r\nand we had a room which she called his, where he would come and stay the\r\nweek-end. At six o\'clock each Saturday night he would arrive with his\r\nsatchel.\r\n\r\n"Daughter-in-law," he would announce, "my other daughter\'s _agin_ the\r\nlaw, she\'s gone off revolooting. Can you take a decent old gentleman in\r\nout of the last century? Don\'t change any plans on my account. If you\'re\r\ngoing out to dinner just tell the cook to give me a snack and a cup of\r\ntea, and then I\'ll light a good cigar and read the works of my great\r\nson. Go right ahead as if I wasn\'t here."\r\n\r\nIf we had he would have been furious. Eleanore always made it his\r\nnight--and no quiet evening, either. When we didn\'t take him out to a\r\nplay she invited people to dinner--young people, for he liked them best.\r\nAnd late on Sunday morning the "Indian" would wake him up, would watch\r\nhim shave and dress and breakfast, and then they would be off to the\r\nPark. We had named our small son after Dad and they were the most\r\nsplendid chums. They had any number of secrets.\r\n\r\nEleanore too had made Sue use our apartment. Sue called it her Manhattan\r\nclub and brought her friends here now and then--"to stir you people up,"\r\nshe said. But this did not disturb me, I felt too secure in life. And\r\nwith a safe, amused and slightly curious attitude I found Sue quite a\r\ntonic. I liked to hear her knock my big men in her cocksure superior\r\nway. It was mighty good fun. And every now and then by mistake she would\r\nhit on something that was true.\r\n\r\nI found something too in her ideas. This suffrage business, for\r\nexample. She had stuck to this hobby quite a while, and through it she\r\nhad reached the conviction that women would never get the vote until the\r\ngreat mass of working girls were drawn into the movement. So she had\r\ngone in for working girls\' clubs, and from clubs into trade unions and\r\nfrom trade unions into strikes. There had been a strike of laundry girls\r\nwhich for a week was the talk of the town. Sue and some of her suffrage\r\nfriends had organized meetings every night, and in a borrowed automobile\r\nshe had rushed from meeting to meeting with two laundry women, meager\r\nforlorn-looking creatures who stood up much embarrassed and awkwardly\r\ntold about their lives. One of them, a young widow, had gone home from\r\nwork one night at eleven and found that her small baby had died of\r\nconvulsions during her absence. It was grim, terrible stuff of its kind,\r\nand Sue was so intensely wrought up you\'d have thought there was nothing\r\nelse in the world. But the strike stopped as suddenly as it began, and\r\nthe two women whose names she had brought into headlines were refused\r\njobs wherever they went. Sue tried to help them for a while, until this\r\nsuffrage parade came along, when she went into this equally hard and\r\nquite forgot their existence.\r\n\r\nAnd then Eleanore took them up. Quietly and as a matter of course, she\r\ntook their troubles on her hands, sent one to a hospital and got the\r\nother work, looked into their wretched home affairs and had them come\r\noften to see her. And this kind of thing was happening often, Sue taking\r\nup and dropping what Eleanore then took up and put through. I compared\r\nthem with a glow of pride.\r\n\r\nEleanore\'s way was so sane and sure. She looked upon society much as she\r\ndid upon our son, who had frequent little ailments but through them all\r\nwhat a glorious growth, to watch it was a perpetual joy. I remember\r\nonce, when in his young stomach there were some fearful goings on,\r\nEleanore\'s remarking:\r\n\r\n"Now if Sue had a child with a stomach in trouble, I suppose her way\r\nwould be to quickly remove the entire stomach and put some new radical\r\nthing in its place."\r\n\r\nAnd then she went to the medicine chest, and a vastly comforted Indian\r\nwas soon cheerfully sitting up in bed.\r\n\r\nEleanore could help others, I felt, because she had first helped\r\nherself, had tackled the mote in her own eye, from the time when she had\r\ngone down to the harbor to get her roots, as she called it. She was a\r\nwonderful manager, our budget was carefully worked out. And she had\r\nherself so well in hand she could put herself behind herself and smile\r\nclearly out on life.\r\n\r\n"When Eleanore takes up a charity case," said her father, "she turns it\r\ninto a person at once, and later into an intimate friend."\r\n\r\nHe himself took a quiet interest in all her charity cases. They would\r\noften talk them over at night, and in his easy careless way he would\r\nturn over all his spare money to help in the work. Eleanore would\r\nprotest at times, and tell him how utterly foolish he was in not putting\r\nmoney aside for himself. But soon, deep in another case of poignant\r\nhuman misery, she would throw all caution to the winds and use her\r\nfather\'s money--every dollar he could spare. That was another vice she\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nHow she hated all the red tape in that huge network of institutions by\r\nwhich New York City provides "relief." She never dropped a case of hers\r\ninto that cumbrous relief machine and then let it slip out of her sight.\r\nShe did the hard thing, she followed it up. She had learned, as I had in\r\nmy work, to "get on the inside" of this secretive city, to go to the\r\ngods behind it all and so have her cases shoved. One day when one of\r\nthem, a woman, was in a hospital so desperately ill that her very life\r\ndepended on being moved to a private room--"It can\'t be done," said the\r\nsuperintendent. Eleanore took the subway downtown to the Wall Street\r\noffice of the man who was the hospital\'s principal backer. She found\r\nhis outer office crowded with men who were waiting to see him on\r\nbusiness. "He can\'t see you," she was told. Then she scribbled this on\r\nher card:\r\n\r\n"I want none of your money, a little of your influence and one minute of\r\nyour time on behalf of a woman who is dying."\r\n\r\nAbout twenty minutes later that woman was in a private room.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to stop talking about my wife. But to return to my sister:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInto my reverie that night Sue burst with a dozen radical friends.\r\nOthers kept arriving, and our small rooms were soon a riot of color and\r\nchatter. Banners were stacked against the wall, bright yellow ribbons\r\nwere everywhere, faces were flushed and happily tired. Eleanore sat at\r\nher coffee urn, cups and saucers and plates went around, and people\r\nstill too excited to rest stood about eating hungrily. The talking was\r\nfast and furious now. I listened, watched their faces.\r\n\r\nThese "radicals," it seemed to me, had talked straight on both day and\r\nnight ever since the evenings years ago when one of their earliest\r\ncoteries had gathered in our Brooklyn home. And talking they had\r\nmultiplied and ramified all over the town. There was nothing under\r\nheaven their fingers did not itch to change. Here close by my side were\r\nthree of them, two would-be Ibsen actresses and one budding playwright\r\nwho had had two Broadway failures and one Berkeley Lyceum success. But\r\nwere they talking of plays? Not at all. They talked of the Russian\r\nRevolution. It had died down in the last few years, and they wanted to\r\nhelp stir it up again by throwing some more American money into the\r\nsmoldering embers. To do this they planned to whip into new life "The\r\nFriends of Russian Freedom."\r\n\r\nThat was it, I told myself, these people were all friends of\r\nrevolutions. Vaguely as I watched them now I felt I was seeing the\r\nparlor side, the light and fluffy outer fringe, of something rather\r\ndangerous. I thought again of that parade and my impression of mass\r\nforce. No danger in that, it was dressy and safe. But some of these\r\nyoungsters did not stop there, they went in for stirring up people in\r\nrags, mass force of a very different kind. Here was a sculptor socialist\r\nwho openly bragged that he\'d had a hand in filling Union Square one day\r\nwith a seething mass of unemployed, and then when some poor crazed\r\nfanatic threw a bomb, our socialist friend, as he himself smilingly put\r\nit, never once stopped running until he reached his studio.\r\n\r\nIt was this kind of thing that got on my nerves. For I pitied the\r\nunwieldy poor, the numberless muddle-headed crowds down there in the\r\ntenements, and it seemed to me perfectly criminal that a lot of these\r\nyoung high-brows should be allowed to stir them up. Their own thinking\r\nwas so muddled, their views of life so out of gear.\r\n\r\nI a radical? No chance!\r\n\r\nWhile they chattered on excitedly, I thought of my trip uptown on the\r\n"El" that afternoon, a trip that I had made hundreds of times. Coming as\r\nI usually was from some big man or other, whose busy office and whose\r\nmind was a clean, brilliant illustration of what efficiency can be, I\r\nwould sit in the car and idly watch the upper story windows we passed,\r\nwith yellow gas jets flaring in the cave-like rooms behind them. There I\r\nhad glimpses of men and girls at long crowded tables making coats,\r\npants, vests, paper flowers, chewing-gum, five-cent cigars. I saw\r\ncountless tenement kitchens, dirty cooking, unmade beds. These glimpses\r\nfollowed one on the other in such a dizzying torrent they merged into\r\none moving picture for me. And that picture was of crowds, crowds,\r\ncrowds--of people living frowzily.\r\n\r\nThis was poverty. And it was like some prodigious swamp. What could you\r\ndo about it? You could pull out individuals here and there, as Eleanore\r\ndid. I considered that a mighty fine job--for a woman or a clergyman.\r\nBut to go at it and drain the swamp was a very different matter. You\r\ncouldn\'t do it by easy preaching of patent cure-alls, nor by stirring up\r\nclass hatred through rabid attacks upon big men. No, this was a job for\r\nthe big men themselves, men who would go at this human swamp as\r\nEleanore\'s father had gone at the harbor--quietly and slowly, with an\r\nengineer\'s precision. He had been at it six solid years, but he still\r\nremarked humbly, "We\'ve only begun."\r\n\r\nThen from thinking of big men I thought of the one I had seen that day,\r\nand of my story about him. It was just in the stage I liked, where I\r\ncould feel it all coming together. Incidents, bits of character and neat\r\nlittle turns of speech rose temptingly before my mind.\r\n\r\nPresently, through the clamor around me, I heard "the Indian" crying.\r\nAll this chatter had waked him up. I saw Eleanore go in to him and soon\r\nI heard the crying stop, and I knew she was telling him a story, a nice\r\nsleepy one to quiet him down.\r\n\r\nWhat an infernal racket these people were making about the world. I went\r\non thinking about my work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n"You two," said Sue, when at last her friends had gone away, "have built\r\nup a wall of contentment around you a person couldn\'t break through with\r\nan axe."\r\n\r\n"Have a little," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"Stay all night," said Eleanore.\r\n\r\n"No, thanks," said Sue. "I promised Dad that I\'d be home."\r\n\r\nAnd then instead of going home she sprawled lazily on the sofa with her\r\nhead upon one elbow, and settled in for some more talk. But her talk was\r\ndifferent to-night. She usually talked about herself, but to-night she\r\ntalked of us instead, of our contemptible content. And presently through\r\nher talk I felt that she had some surprise to spring. In a few moments\r\nEleanore felt it too, I could tell that by the vigilant way she kept\r\nglancing up from her knitting.\r\n\r\n"I think," I was remarking, "we\'re a pretty liberal-minded pair."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it," said Sue. "You\'re liberals!" What utter disdain she threw\r\ninto the word. "And what\'s more you\'re citizens. In all these\r\nmovements," she went on, "you always find two classes--citizens and\r\ncriminals. You two are both born citizens."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the difference?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"Citizens," said Sue impressively, "are ready to _vote_ for what they\r\nbelieve in. Criminals are ready to get arrested and go to jail."\r\n\r\nEleanore looked up at her.\r\n\r\n"Who gave you that?" she asked. Sue looked a little taken back, but only\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\n"One of the criminals," she said. Her voice was carefully casual now but\r\nher eyes were a little excited. "He\'s a man who made up his mind that he\r\nwanted to get way down to the bottom, and see how it feels to be down\r\nthere. So he took the very worst job he could find. For two years he was\r\na stoker--on ships of all kinds all over the world. And now that he\r\nknows just how it feels, he has an office down on the docks where he\'s\r\ngetting the stokers and dockers together--getting them ready for a\r\nstrike--on your beloved harbor."\r\n\r\n"Joe Kramer," said Eleanore quietly. Sue gave a sudden, nervous start.\r\n\r\n"Eleanore," she severely rejoined, "sometimes you\'re simply uncanny--the\r\nway you quietly jump at a thing!"\r\n\r\nEleanore had gone on with her knitting. I rose and lit a cigarette. I\r\ncould feel Sue\'s eyes upon me. So _this_ was her infernal surprise! J.\r\nK. banging into my life again!\r\n\r\n"How long has Joe been here?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"About five months," Sue answered.\r\n\r\n"He might have looked me up," I said.\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t want to look anyone up, I\'ve only seen him once myself. He\r\nhas simply buried himself down there. Why don\'t you go and see him,\r\nBilly?" she added, with a quick glance at Eleanore. "He won\'t amuse you\r\nthe way we do. He\'s one of the real criminals now."\r\n\r\nStill Eleanore did not look up.\r\n\r\n"What\'s his address?" I asked gruffly. Sue gave it to me and\r\ngood-humoredly yawned and said she must be getting home.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, dear," said Eleanore. She had risen and come to the door.\r\n"What a love of a hat you\'re wearing. It\'s a new one, isn\'t it? I caught\r\nsight of it in the parade."\r\n\r\nBut the smile which my tall sister threw back at us from the doorway\r\nhad nothing whatever to do with hats. It said as plainly as in words:\r\n\r\n"Now, you cozy liberals, go over and touch _that_ spot if you dare."\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone I took up a book and tried to read. But I soon\r\ngloomily relapsed. Would J. K. never leave me alone? What was he doing\r\nwith my harbor? Why should I look him up, confound him--he hadn\'t\r\nbothered his head about me. But I knew that I _would_ look him up and\r\nwould find him more disturbing than ever. How he did keep moving on. No,\r\nnot on, but down, down--until now he had bumped the bottom!\r\n\r\n"Are you going to see him?"\r\n\r\nGlancing sharply up, I saw Eleanore carefully watching my face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I suppose so," I replied. She bent again to her knitting.\r\n\r\n"He must be a strange kind of a person," she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nI slept little that night, and my work the next morning went badly. So,\r\nafter wasting an hour or two, I decided to stop. I would go and see Joe\r\nand be done with it.\r\n\r\nWhat was he doing with my harbor? The address Sue had given me was down\r\non the North River, my old hunting ground. The weather had turned cold\r\nover-night, and when I came to the waterfront I felt the big raw breath\r\nof the sea. I had hardly been near the harbor in years. It had become\r\nfor me a deep invisible corner-stone upon which my vigorous world was\r\nbuilt. I had climbed up into the airy heights, I had been writing of\r\nmillionaires. And coming so abruptly now from my story of life in rich\r\nhotels, the place I had once glorified looked bleak and naked,\r\nelemental. Down to the roots of things again.\r\n\r\nI came to a bare wooden building, climbed some stairs and entered a\r\nlarge, low-ceilinged room which was evidently a meeting hall. Chairs\r\nwere stacked along the walls and there was a low platform at one end. As\r\nI lingered there a moment, by habit my eyes took in the details. The\r\nlocal color was lurid enough. On the walls were foreign pictures, one of\r\nthe anarchist Ferrer being executed in Spain, and another of an Italian\r\nmob shaking their fists and yelling like demons at a bloated hideous\r\npriest. There were posters in which flaming torches, blood-red flags and\r\nbarricades and cannon belching clouds of smoke stood out in heavy blacks\r\nand reds. And all this foreign violence was made grimly real in its\r\npurpose here by the way these pictures centered around the largest\r\nposter, which was of an ocean liner with all its different kinds of\r\nworkers gathered together in one mass and staring fixedly up at the\r\nship.\r\n\r\nThrough a door in a board partition I went into a narrow room from which\r\ntwo dirty windows looked out upon the docks below. This room was cramped\r\nand crowded. Newspapers and pamphlets lay heaped on the floor, and in\r\nthe corners were four desks, at one of which three men, whom I learned\r\nlater to be an Italian, an Englishman and a Spaniard, were talking\r\ntogether intensely. They took no notice of my entrance, for many other\r\nvisitors, burly, sooty creatures, were constantly straggling in and out.\r\n\r\nI saw Joe at a desk in one corner. Looking doubly tall and lean and\r\nstooped, and with a tired frown on his face, he sat there with his\r\nsleeves rolled up slowly pounding out a letter on the typewriter before\r\nhim. On top of his desk were huge ledgers, and over them upon hooks on\r\nthe wall hung bunches of letters from other ports. It all gave me a\r\nheavy impression of dull daily drudgery. And in this Joe was so absorbed\r\nthat he took no notice of my presence, although I now stood close behind\r\nhim. When at last he did look up and I got a full view of his face, with\r\nits large, familiar features, tight-set jaw and deep-set eyes, I was\r\nstartled at its gauntness.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Joe----"\r\n\r\n"Hello." A dullish red came into his face and then a slight frown. He\r\nhalf rose from his seat. "Hello, Bill," he repeated. "What\'s brought you\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\nHe appeared a little dazed at first, then anything but glad to see me.\r\nThe thought of our old college days flashed for a moment into my mind.\r\nHow far away they seemed just now. Through our first few awkward remarks\r\nhe lapsed back into such a tired, worn indifference that I was soon on\r\nthe point of leaving. But that bony gauntness in his face, and all it\r\nshowed me he had been through, gave him some right to his rudeness, I\r\nthought. So I changed my mind and stuck to my purpose of having it all\r\nout with Joe and learning what he was about. Persisting in my\r\nfriendliness my questions slowly drew him out.\r\n\r\nSince I had seen him five years ago he had continued his writing, but as\r\nhe had grown steadily more set on writing only what he called "the truth\r\nabout things," the newspapers had closed their doors. While I had gone\r\nup he had gone down, until finally throwing up in disgust "this whole\r\nfool game of putting words on paper," he had made up his mind to throw\r\nin his life with the lives of the men at the bottom. So for two years he\r\nhad shoveled coal in the stokeholes of ships by day and by night, he had\r\nmixed with stokers of every race, from English, French and Germans to\r\nRussians and Italians, Spaniards, Hindus, Coolies, Greeks. He had worked\r\nand eaten and slept in their holes, he had ranged the slums of all the\r\nseas. And of all this he spoke in short, commonplace phrases, still in\r\nthat indifferent tone, as though personal stories were a bore.\r\n\r\n"But look here, Joe," I asked at the end, "what\'s the good of living\r\nlike this? What the devil can you do?"\r\n\r\nI still remember the look he gave me, the weary remoteness of it. But\r\nall he said was,\r\n\r\n"Organize strikes."\r\n\r\n"Here?"\r\n\r\n"Everywhere."\r\n\r\n"Of stokers?"\r\n\r\n"No, of all industries."\r\n\r\n"For higher pay, eh, and shorter hours."\r\n\r\nAnother brief look.\r\n\r\n"No, for revolution," he said.\r\n\r\nBriefly, in reply to my questions, he explained how he and his friends\r\nhad already induced some twelve thousand stokers and dockers to leave\r\ntheir old trade unions and enroll themselves as members of this new\r\ninternational body, which was to embrace not only one trade but all the\r\nlabor connected with ships--ships of all nations. He was here doing the\r\nadvance work. As soon as the ground was made ready, he said, some of the\r\nbigger leaders would come. Then there would be mass meetings here and\r\npresently a general strike. And as the years went on there would be\r\nsimilar strikes in all trades and in all countries, until at some time\r\nnot many years off there would be such labor rebellions as would\r\nparalyze the industrial world. And out of this catastrophe the workers\r\nwould emerge into power to build up a strange new world of their own.\r\n\r\nThis was what Joe saw ahead. He seemed to be seeing it while he spoke,\r\nwith a hard, clear intensity that struck me rather cold. Here was no\r\nmere parlor talk, here was a man who lived what he said.\r\n\r\n"You comfortable people," he said, "are so damn comfortable you\'re\r\nblind. You see nothing ahead but peace on earth and a nice smooth\r\nevolution--with a lot of steady little reforms. You\'ve got so you\r\nhonestly can\'t believe there\'s any violence left in the world. You\'re as\r\nblind as most folks were five years before the Civil War. But what\'s the\r\nuse talking?" he ended. "You can\'t understand all this." Again my\r\nirritation rose.\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t say I do," I replied. "To stir up millions of men of that\r\nkind and then let \'em loose upon the world strikes me as absolutely\r\nmad!"\r\n\r\n"I knew it would."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Joe, how are _you_ so sure about all this? Hasn\'t it ever\r\nstruck you that you\'re getting damnably narrow?" He smiled.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care much if I\'m narrow," he said.\r\n\r\n"You think it\'s good for you, being like this?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care if it\'s good for me."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want to see anything else?"\r\n\r\n"Not in your successful world."\r\n\r\n"Well, J. K., I\'m sorry," I retorted hotly. "Because I\'d like to see\r\nyour world, I honestly would! I\'m not like you, I\'m always ready to be\r\nshown!"\r\n\r\n"All right, come and see it. Why don\'t you write up Jim Marsh?" He\r\nsmiled as he named the notorious leader of the whole organization.\r\n"He\'ll be here soon, and in his line he has been a mighty successful\r\nman. All up and down the U. S. A. Jim\'s name has been in headlines and\r\nJim himself has been in jail. A successful revolutionist. So why not add\r\nhim to your list? Write up the America _he_ knows." There was a\r\nchallenge in Joe\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"All right, perhaps I will," I said. At least I had him talking now.\r\n"Come out to lunch and tell me some more."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any lunch."\r\n\r\nSomething in the way he said that made me look at him quickly. He\r\nappeared to me now not only thin but tense and rather feverish. His\r\nnerves were plainly all on edge. He had smoked one cigarette after\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a lot of work to-day," he added restlessly. "Not only these\r\ndamn letters to write--I\'ve got to make up our paper besides--it goes to\r\nthe printer to-morrow. Here, take a copy with you."\r\n\r\nAnd he handed me the last week\'s issue. It was a crude and flimsy\r\naffair, with its name, in scarehead letters, "WAR SURE." I glanced it\r\nover in silence a moment. What a drop for Joe, from what he had been, to\r\nthis wretched violent little sheet, this muckraker of the ocean world.\r\n\r\n"Not like the harbor _you_ painted," he said.\r\n\r\n"No," I answered shortly.\r\n\r\n"Do you want another look at your harbor?"\r\n\r\nI eyed him for a moment:\r\n\r\n"All right--I\'ll look----"\r\n\r\n"Fine business." He had risen now, and a gleam of the old likable Joe\r\ncame for a moment into his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Meet me to-morrow at seven a. m. And let\'s look at some of its\r\nfailures," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\n"Did you see him?" Eleanore asked that night.\r\n\r\n"Yes--I saw him----"\r\n\r\nI could feel her waiting, but I could not bring myself to talk. Eleanore\r\nwouldn\'t like J. K. She wouldn\'t like what I had told him I\'d do. I was\r\nsorry now that I had, it was simply looking for trouble. I damned that\r\nchallenge in Joe\'s voice. Why did he always get hold of me so?\r\n\r\n"How did he look? Is he much changed?" Eleanore asked me quietly.\r\n\r\n"Yes. He looks half sick--and old. He\'s been through a good deal," I\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n"Did he talk about that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes"--I hesitated--"and of what he wants to show me," I said. Eleanore\r\nlooked quickly up.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to see him soon again?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--to-morrow morning--to have a look at his stoker friends. I want to\r\nhave just one good look at the life that has made him what he is. That\'s\r\nall--that\'s all it amounts to----"\r\n\r\nThere was another silence. Then she came over behind my chair and I felt\r\nthe cool quiet of her hand as she slowly stroked my forehead.\r\n\r\n"You look tired, dear," she said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJust before daylight the next morning I rose and dressed, swallowed some\r\ncoffee and set out. I took a surface car downtown.\r\n\r\nI had not been out at this hour in years. And as in my present mood,\r\ntroubled and expectant, I watched the streets in the raw half-light,\r\nthey looked as utterly changed to me as though they were streets of a\r\ndifferent world. The department store windows looked unreal. Their soft\r\nrich lights had been put out, and in this cold hard light of dawn all\r\ntheir blandishing ladies of wax appeared like so many buxom ghosts. Men\r\nwere washing the windows. Women and girls were hurrying by, and as some\r\nof them stopped for a moment to peer in at these phantoms of fashion,\r\ntheir own faces looked equally waxen to me. A long, luxurious motor\r\npassed with a man and a woman in evening clothes half asleep in each\r\nother\'s arms. An old man with a huge pack of rags turned slowly and\r\nstared after them. The day\'s work was beginning. Peddlers trundled\r\npush-carts along, newspaper vendors opened their stands, milk wagons and\r\ntrucks from the markets came by, some on the gallop. Our car had filled\r\nwith people now. Men and boys clung to the steps behind and women and\r\ngirls were packed inside, most of them hanging to the straps. How badly\r\nand foolishly dressed were these girls. There must be thousands of them\r\nout. Two kept tittering inanely. All the rest were silent.\r\n\r\nBy the time that I reached the docksheds the day was breaking over their\r\nroofs. It was freezing cold, and the chill was worse in the dock that I\r\nentered. I buttoned my ulster tighter. The big place was dark and empty.\r\nThe dockers, I learned from the watchman, had quit work at three\r\no\'clock, for a few tons of fruit was all the freight that remained to be\r\nloaded. The ship was to sail at nine o\'clock.\r\n\r\nThe stokers had not yet gone aboard. I found about a hundred of them\r\nhuddled along the steel wall of the shed. Some of them had old leather\r\ngrips or canvas bags, but many had no luggage at all. A few wore seedy\r\novercoats, but the greater part had none, they stood with their hands in\r\ntheir ragged pockets, shivering and stamping. Most of them were\r\nundersized, some tough, some rather sickly. A dull-eyed, wretched,\r\nsodden lot. I got the liquor on their breaths. A fat old Irish stoker\r\ncame drifting half-drunk up the pier with a serene and waggish smile.\r\n\r\n"Hello," said Joe at my elbow.\r\n\r\nHe looked more fagged than the day before. I noticed that his lips were\r\nblue and that his teeth were chattering.\r\n\r\n"Joe," I said abruptly, "you\'re not fit to be here. Let\'s get out of\r\nthis, you belong in bed." He glanced at me impatiently.\r\n\r\n"I\'m fit enough," he muttered. "We\'ll stay right here and see this\r\nshow--unless you feel you want to quit----"\r\n\r\n"Did I say I did? I\'m ready enough----"\r\n\r\n"All right, then wait a minute. They\'re about ready to go on board."\r\n\r\nBut as we stood and watched them, I still felt the chattering teeth by\r\nmy side, and a wave of pity and anger and of disgust swept over me. Joe\r\nwouldn\'t last long at this kind of thing!\r\n\r\n"What do you think of my friends?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I think you\'re throwing your life away!"\r\n\r\n"Do you? How do you make it out?"\r\n\r\n"Because they\'re an utterly hopeless crowd! Look at \'em--poor\r\ndevils--they look like a lot of Bowery bums!"\r\n\r\n"Yes--they look like a lot of bums. And they feed all the fires at sea."\r\n\r\n"Are they all like these?" I demanded.\r\n\r\n"No better dressed," he answered. "A million lousy brothers of Christ."\r\n\r\n"And you think you can build a new world _with them_?"\r\n\r\n"No--I think they can do it themselves."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what I think they\'ll do themselves? If they ever do win in\r\nany strike and get a raise in wages--they\'ll simply blow it in on\r\ndrink!"\r\n\r\nJoe looked at me a moment.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll do so much more than drink," he said. "Come on," he added.\r\n"They\'re going aboard."\r\n\r\nThey were forming in a long line now before the third-class gang-plank.\r\nAs they went up with their packs on their shoulders, a man at the top\r\ngave each a shove and shouted out a number, which another official\r\nchecked off in a book. The latter I learned was the chief engineer. He\r\nwas a lean, powerful, ruddy-faced man with a plentiful store of\r\nprofanity which he poured out in a torrent:\r\n\r\n"Come on! For Christ\'s sake! Do you want to freeze solid, you ---- human\r\nbunch of stiffs?"\r\n\r\nWe came up the plank at the end of the line, and I showed him a letter\r\nwhich I had procured admitting us to the engine rooms. He turned us over\r\npromptly to one of his junior engineers, and we were soon climbing down\r\noily ladders through the intricate parts of the engines, all polished,\r\nglistening, carefully cleaned. And then climbing down more ladders until\r\nwe were, as I was told, within ten feet of the keel of the ship, we came\r\ninto the stokers\' quarters.\r\n\r\nAnd here nothing at all was carefully cleaned. The place was foul, its\r\npainted steel walls and floor and ceiling were heavily encrusted with\r\ndirt. The low chamber was crowded with rows of bunks, steel skeleton\r\nbunks three tiers high, the top tier just under the ceiling. In each was\r\na thin, dirty mattress and blanket. In some of these men were already\r\nasleep, breathing hard, snoring and wheezing. Others were crowded around\r\ntheir bags intent on something I could not see. Many were smoking, the\r\nair was blue. Some were almost naked, and the smells of their bodies\r\nfilled the place. It was already stifling.\r\n\r\n"Had enough?" asked our young guide, with a grin.\r\n\r\n"No," I said, with an answering superior smile. "We\'ll stay a while and\r\nget it all."\r\n\r\nAnd after a little more talk he left us.\r\n\r\n"How do you like our home?" asked Joe.\r\n\r\n"I\'m here now," I said grimly. "Go ahead and show me. And try to believe\r\nthat I want to be shown."\r\n\r\n"All right, here comes our breakfast."\r\n\r\nTwo stokers were bringing in a huge boiler. They set it down on the\r\ndirty floor. It was full of a greasy, watery soup with a thick, yellow\r\nscum on the top, through which chunks of pork and potato bobbed up here\r\nand there.\r\n\r\n"This is scouse," Joe told me. Men eagerly dipped tin cups in this and\r\ngulped it down. The chunks of meat they ate with their hands. They ate\r\nsitting on bunks or standing between them. Some were wedged in close\r\naround a bunk in which lay a sleeper who looked utterly dead to the\r\nworld. His face was white.\r\n\r\n"He reminds me," said Joe, "of a fellow whose bunk was once next to\r\nmine. He was shipped at Buenos Ayres, where the crimps still handle the\r\nbusiness. A crimp had carried this chap on board, dumped him, got his\r\nten dollars and left. The man was supposed to wake up at sea and shovel\r\ncoal. But this one didn\'t. The second day out some one leaned over and\r\ntouched him and yelled. The crimp had sold us a dead one."\r\n\r\nAs Joe said this he stared down at the sleeper, a curious tensity in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Joe, how did you ever stand this life?"\r\n\r\nMy own voice almost startled me, it sounded so suddenly tense and\r\nstrained. Joe turned and looked at me searchingly, with a trace of that\r\nold affection of his.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t, Kid," he said gruffly. "The two years almost got me. And\r\nthat\'s what happens to most of \'em here. Half of \'em," he added, "are\r\ndown-and-outers when they start. They\'re what the factories and mills\r\nand all the rest of this lovely modern industrial world throw out as no\r\nmore wanted. So they drift down here and take a job that nobody else\r\nwill take, it\'s so rotten, and here they have one week of hell and\r\nanother week\'s good drunk in port. And when the barrooms and the women\r\nand all the waterfront sharks have stripped \'em of their last red cent,\r\nthen the crimps collect an advance allotment from their future wages to\r\nship \'em off to sea again."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not true in _this_ port," I retorted, eagerly catching him up on\r\nthe one point that I knew was wrong. "They don\'t allow crimps in New\r\nYork any more."\r\n\r\n"No," Joe answered grimly. "The port of New York has got reformed, it\'s\r\nbecome all for efficiency now. The big companies put up money for a kind\r\nof a seamen\'s Y. M. C. A. where they try to keep men sober ashore, and\r\nso get \'em back quick into holes like these, in the name of Christ.\r\n\r\n"But there\'s one thing they forget," he added bitterly. "The age of\r\nsteam has sent the old-style sailors ashore and shipped these fellows in\r\ntheir places. And that makes all the difference. These chaps didn\'t grow\r\nup on ships and get used to being kicked and cowed and shot for mutiny\r\nif they struck. No, they\'re all grown up on land, in factories where\r\nthey\'ve been in strikes, and they bring their factory views along into\r\nthese floating factories. And they don\'t like these stinking holes! They\r\ndon\'t like their jobs, with no day and no night, only steel walls and\r\nelectric light! You hear a shout at midnight and you jump down into the\r\nstokehole and work like hell till four a. m., when you crawl up all\r\nsoaked in sweat and fall asleep till the next shout. And you do this,\r\nnot as the sailor did for a captain he knew and called \'the old man,\'\r\nbut for a corporation so big it has rules and regulations for you like\r\nwhat they have in the navy. You\'re nothing but a number. Look here."\r\n\r\nHe took me to a bulletin that had just been put up on the wall. Around\r\nit men were eagerly crowding.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s where you find by your number what shift you\'re to work in," he\r\nsaid, "and what other number you have to replace if he goes down. Heart\r\nfailure is damn common here, and if your man gives out it means you\r\ndouble up for the rest of the voyage. So you get his number and hunt for\r\nhim and size him up. You hope he\'ll last. I\'ll show you why."\r\n\r\nHe crawled down a short ladder and through low passageways dripping wet\r\nand so came into the stokehole.\r\n\r\nThis was a long, narrow chamber with a row of glowing furnace doors. Wet\r\ncoal and coal-dust lay on the floor. At either end a small steel door\r\nopened into bunkers that ran along the sides of the ship, deep down near\r\nthe bottom, containing thousands of tons of soft coal, which the men\r\ncalled "trimmers" kept shoveling out to the stokers. As the voyage went\r\non, Joe told me, these trimmers had to go farther and farther back into\r\nthe long, black bunkers, full of stifling coal-dust, in which if the\r\nship were rolling the masses of coal kept crashing down. Hundreds of men\r\nhad been killed that way. In the stokehole the fires were not yet up,\r\nbut by the time the ship was at sea the furnace mouths would be white\r\nhot and the men at work half naked. They not only shoveled coal into the\r\nflames, they had to spread it out as well and at intervals rake out the\r\n"clinkers" in fiery masses on the floor. On these a stream of water\r\nplayed, filling the chamber with clouds of steam. In older ships, like\r\nthis one, a "lead stoker" stood at the head of the line and set the pace\r\nfor the others to follow. He was paid more to keep up the pace. But on\r\nthe fast new liners this pacer was replaced by a gong.\r\n\r\n"And at each stroke of the gong you shovel," said Joe. "You do this till\r\nyou forget your name. Every time the boat pitches, the floor heaves you\r\nforward, the fire spurts at you out of the doors and the gong keeps on\r\nlike a sledgehammer coming down on top of your mind. And all you think\r\nof is your bunk and the time when you\'re to tumble in."\r\n\r\nFrom the stokers\' quarters presently there came a burst of singing.\r\n\r\n"Now let\'s go back," he ended, "and see how they\'re getting ready for\r\nthis."\r\n\r\nAs we crawled back the noise increased, and it swelled to a roar as we\r\nentered. The place was pandemonium now. Those groups I had noticed\r\naround the bags had been getting out the liquor, and now at eight\r\no\'clock in the morning half the crew were already well soused. Some\r\nmoved restlessly about. One huge bull of a creature with large, limpid,\r\nshining eyes stopped suddenly with a puzzled stare, then leaned back on\r\na bunk and laughed uproariously. From there he lurched over the shoulder\r\nof a thin, wiry, sober man who, sitting on the edge of a bunk, was\r\nslowly spelling out the words of a newspaper aeroplane story. The big\r\nman laughed again and spit, and the thin man jumped half up and snarled.\r\n\r\nLouder rose the singing. Half the crew was crowded close around a little\r\nred-faced cockney. He was the modern "chanty man." With sweat pouring\r\ndown his cheeks and the muscles of his neck drawn taut, he was jerking\r\nout verse after verse about women. He sang to an old "chanty" tune, one\r\nthat I remembered well. But he was not singing out under the stars, he\r\nwas screaming at steel walls down here in the bottom of the ship. And\r\nalthough he kept speeding up his song the crowd were too drunk to wait\r\nfor the chorus, their voices kept tumbling in over his, and soon it was\r\nonly a frenzy of sound, a roar with yells rising out of it. The singers\r\nkept pounding each other\'s backs or waving bottles over their heads. Two\r\nbottles smashed together and brought a still higher burst of glee.\r\n\r\n"I\'m tired!" Joe shouted. "Let\'s get out!"\r\n\r\nI caught a glimpse of his strained, frowning face. Again it came over me\r\nin a flash, the years he had spent in holes like this, in this hideous,\r\nrotten world of his, while I had lived joyously in mine. And as though\r\nhe had read the thought in my disturbed and troubled eyes,\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go up where _you_ belong," he said.\r\n\r\nI followed him up and away from his friends. As we climbed ladder after\r\nladder, fainter and fainter on our ears rose that yelling from below.\r\nSuddenly we came out on deck and slammed an iron door behind us.\r\n\r\nAnd I was where I belonged. I was in dazzling sunshine and keen frosty\r\nAutumn air. I was among gay throngs of people. Dainty women brushed me\r\nby. I felt the softness of their furs, I breathed the fragrant scent of\r\nthem and of the flowers that they wore, I saw their fresh immaculate\r\nclothes, I heard the joyous tumult of their talking and their laughing\r\nto the regular crash of the band--all the life of the ship I had known\r\nso well.\r\n\r\nAnd I walked through it all as though in a dream. On the dock I watched\r\nit spellbound--until with handkerchiefs waving and voices calling down\r\ngood-bys, that throng of happy travelers moved slowly out into\r\nmidstream.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew that deep below all this, down in the bottom of the ship, the\r\nstokers were still singing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same day I had an appointment to lunch with the owner of rich\r\nhotels whose story I was writing. And the interview dragged. For the\r\nAmerica he knew was like what I\'d seen on the upper decks of the ship\r\nthat had sailed a few hours before. And I could not get back my old zest\r\nfor it all, I kept thinking of what I had seen underneath. The faces of\r\nindividual stokers, some fiery red, some sodden gray, kept bobbing up in\r\nmy memory. Angrily trying to keep them down, I went on with my\r\nquestions. But I caught the hotel millionaire throwing curious looks at\r\nme now and then.\r\n\r\nI went home worried and depressed and shut myself up in my workroom.\r\nThis business had to be thought out. It wasn\'t only stokers; it was\r\nsomething deep, world-wide. I had come up against the slums. What had I\r\nto do with it all?\r\n\r\nI was in my room all afternoon. I heard "the Indian" at my door, but I\r\nsat still and silent, and presently he went away.\r\n\r\nLate in the twilight Eleanore came. How beautiful she was to-night. She\r\nwas wearing a soft gown of silk, blue with something white at her throat\r\nand a brooch that I had given her. As she bent over my shoulder I felt\r\nher clean, fresh loveliness.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want to tell me, love, just what it was he showed you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather not, my dear one, it was something so terribly ugly," I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like being so far away from you, dear. Please tell me. Suppose\r\nyou begin at the start."\r\n\r\nIt took a long time, for she would let me keep nothing back.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t have thought it could hit me so hard," I said at the end.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not surprised," said Eleanore.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t be simply angry at Joe," I went on. "He\'s so intensely and\r\ngauntly sincere. It isn\'t just talk with him, you see, as it is with\r\nSue\'s parlor radical friends. Think of the life he\'s been leading, think\r\nof it compared to mine. Joe and I were mighty close once"--I broke off\r\nand got up restlessly. "I hate to think of him," I said.\r\n\r\n"It\'s funny," said Eleanore quietly. "I knew this was coming sooner or\r\nlater. Ever since we\'ve been married I\'ve known that Joe Kramer still\r\nmeans more to you than any man you\'ve ever met."\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t," I said sharply. "Where on earth did you get that idea?"\r\n\r\n"From you, my love," she answered. "You can\'t dream how often you\'ve\r\nspoken about him."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know I had!" It is most disquieting at times, the things\r\nEleanore tells me about myself.\r\n\r\n"I know you don\'t," she continued, "you do it so unconsciously. That\'s\r\nwhy I\'m so sure he has a real place in the deep unconscious part of you.\r\nHe worries you. He gets you to think you\'ve no right to be happy!" There\r\nwas a bitterness in her voice that I had never heard before. "I believe\r\nin helping people--of course--whenever I get a chance," she said. "But I\r\ndon\'t believe in this--I hate it! It\'s simply an insane attempt to pull\r\nevery good thing down! It\'s too awful even to think of!"\r\n\r\n"We\'re not going to," I told her. "I\'m sorry for Joe and I wish I could\r\nhelp him out of his hole. But I can\'t--it\'s too infernally deep. He\r\nwon\'t listen to any talk from me--and as long as he won\'t I\'ll leave him\r\nalone. It\'s hideous enough--God knows. But if I ever tackle poverty and\r\nlabor and that sort of thing it\'ll be along quite different lines."\r\n\r\nThe door-bell rang.\r\n\r\n"Oh Billy," she said, "I forgot to tell you. Father\'s coming to dinner\r\nto-night." I looked at her a moment:\r\n\r\n"Did you ask him here on my account?" Eleanore smiled frankly.\r\n\r\n"Yes--I thought I might need him," she said.\r\n\r\nI did not talk to her father of Joe--his plans for a strike were his\r\nsecret, not mine. But with Eleanore pushing me on, I described the hell\r\nI had seen in the stokehole.\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, it\'s hell," her father agreed. "But in time we\'ll do away\r\nwith it."\r\n\r\n"I knew it," Eleanore put in.\r\n\r\n"How?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"By using oil instead of coal. Or if we can\'t get oil cheap enough by\r\nautomatic stokers--machines to do the work of men."\r\n\r\nI thought hard and fast for a moment, and suddenly I realized that I had\r\nnever given any real thought to matters of this kind before.\r\n\r\n"Then what will become of the stokers?" I asked him.\r\n\r\n"One thing at a time." I caught Dillon keenly watching me over his\r\ncigar. "Don\'t give up your faith in efficiency, Bill. If they\'ll only\r\ngive us time enough we\'ll be able to do so much for men."\r\n\r\nThere was something so big and sincere in his voice and in his clear and\r\nkindly eyes.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you will," I answered. "If you don\'t, there\'s nobody else who\r\ncan."\r\n\r\nIn a week or two, by grinding steadily on at my work and by a few more\r\nquiet talks with Eleanore and her father, I could feel myself safely\r\nback on my ground.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut one morning Sue broke in on me.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just heard from a friend of Joe Kramer\'s," she said, "that he is\r\ndangerously ill. And there\'s no one to look after him. Hadn\'t you better\r\ngo yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," I assented gruffly. "I\'ll go down at once."\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though the Fates and Sue were in league to keep Joe in my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nI went to Joe\'s office and found the address of the room where he slept.\r\nIt was over a German saloon close by. It was a large, low-ceilinged\r\nroom, bare and cheaply furnished, with dirty curtains at the windows,\r\ndirty collars and shirts on the floor. It was cold. In the high\r\nold-fashioned fireplace the coal fire had gone out. Joe was lying\r\ndressed on the bed. He jumped up as I entered and came to me with his\r\nface flushed and his eyes dilated. He gripped my hand.\r\n\r\n"Why, hello, Kid," he cried. "Glad to see you!" And then with a quick\r\ndrop of his voice: "Hold on, we mustn\'t talk so loud, we\'ve got to be\r\nquiet here, you know." He turned away from me restlessly. "I\'ve been\r\nhunting for hours for that damn book. Their cataloguing system here is\r\nrotten, Kid, it\'s rotten!" As he spoke he was slowly feeling his way\r\nalong the dirty white wall of his room. "They\'ve cheated us, Bill, I\'m\r\non to \'em now! That\'s what college is really for these days, to hide the\r\nbooks we ought to read!"\r\n\r\nIt came over me suddenly that Joe was back in college, on one of those\r\nlibrary evenings of ours. I felt a tightening at my throat.\r\n\r\n"Say, Joe." I drew him toward the bed. "The chapel bell has just struck\r\nten. Time for beer and pretzels."\r\n\r\n"Fine business! Gee, but I\'ve got a thirst! But where\'s the door? God\r\ndamn it all--I can\'t find anything to-night!" He laughed unsteadily.\r\n\r\n"Right over here," I answered. "Steady, old man----"\r\n\r\nAnd so I got him to his bed. He fell down on it breathing hard and I\r\nbrought him a drink of water. He began to shiver violently. I covered\r\nhim up with dirty blankets, went down to the barroom and telephoned to\r\nEleanore. Too deeply disturbed to think very clearly, acting on an\r\nimpulse, I told her of Joe\'s condition and asked if I might bring him\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n"Why of course," came the answer, a little sharp. "Wait a moment. Let me\r\nthink." There was a pause, and then she added quietly, "Go back to his\r\nroom and keep him in bed. I\'ll see that an ambulance comes right down."\r\n\r\nWithin an hour after that Joe was installed in our guest room with a\r\ntrained nurse to attend to him. The doctor pronounced it typhoid and he\r\nwas with us for nine weeks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe effect upon our lives was sharp. In our small crowded apartment all\r\nentertaining was suddenly stopped, and with the sole exception of Sue no\r\none came to see us. Even our little Indian learned to be quiet as a\r\nmouse. Our whole home became intense.\r\n\r\nThrough the thin wall of my workroom I could hear Joe in his delirium.\r\nNow he was busily writing letters, now in a harsh excited voice he was\r\ntalking to a crowd of men, again he was furiously shoveling coal. All\r\nthis was incoherent, only mutterings most of the time. But when the\r\nvoice rose suddenly it was so full of a stern pain, so quivering with\r\nrevolt against life, and it poured out such a torrent of commonplace\r\nminute details that showed this was Joe\'s daily life and the deepest\r\npart of his being--that as I listened at my desk the ghost I thought I\r\nhad buried deep, that vague guilty feeling over my own happiness, came\r\nstealing up in me again. And it was so poignant now, that struggle\r\nangrily as I would to plunge again into my work, I found it impossible\r\nto describe the life in those rich gay hotels with the zest and the dash\r\nI needed to make my story a success.\r\n\r\nBut it had to be a success, for we needed money badly, the expenses of\r\nJoe\'s sickness were already rolling in. So I did finish it at last and\r\ntook it to my successful man, who read it with evident disappointment.\r\nIt was not the glory story that I had led him to expect. My magazine\r\neditor said he would use it, but he, too, appeared surprised.\r\n\r\n"You weren\'t up to your usual form," was his comment. "What\'s the\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\n"A sick friend."\r\n\r\nI started another story at once, one I had already planned, about a man\r\nwho was to build a string of gorgeous opera houses in the leading\r\nAmerican cities. This story, too, went slowly. Joe Kramer\'s voice kept\r\nbreaking in. From time to time as I struggled on I could feel Eleanore\r\nwatching me.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t try to hurry it," she said. "We can always borrow from father,\r\nyou know--and besides, I\'m going to cut our expenses."\r\n\r\nShe was as good as her word. She dismissed the nurse, and through the\r\nlast weeks of delirium and the first of returning consciousness she\r\nplaced herself in Joe\'s borderland as the one whose presence he vaguely\r\nfelt pulling him back into comfort and strength.\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t talk," I heard her say to him one evening. "I don\'t want to\r\nhear you. All I want is to get you well. That\'s the only thing you and I\r\nhave to talk of."\r\n\r\nBut having so thrown him off his guard, as his mind grew clearer she\r\nbegan cautiously drawing him out, despite his awakening hostility to\r\nthis woman who had made me a success. From my room I heard snatches of\r\ntheir talk. She surprised J. K. by the intimate bits of knowledge about\r\nhim that she had collected both from me and from his own sick ramblings.\r\nShe had just enough of his point of view to rouse him from his\r\nindifference, to annoy him by her mistakes and her refusals to\r\nunderstand. I remember one afternoon when I went in to sit with him, his\r\nstaring grimly up at my face and saying:\r\n\r\n"Bill, that wife of yours is such a born success she scares me.\r\nEverything she touches, everything she brings me to drink, everything\r\nshe does to this bed, is one thundering success. And she won\'t listen to\r\nanything _but_ success. Your case is absolutely hopeless."\r\n\r\nThey became grim enemies, and both of them enjoyed it. She let our\r\nsmall son come and sit by the bed. The Indian promptly worshiped Joe as\r\nthe "longest" man he had ever seen, and they became boon companions.\r\n\r\n"It\'s pathetic," Eleanore told me, "the little things that appeal to him\r\nhere. Poor boy, he has forgotten what a decent home is like."\r\n\r\nAs he grew stronger she read the paper to him each morning, and they\r\nquarreled with keen relish over the news events of the day. And as at\r\nthe start, so now, she kept giving him little shocks of surprise by her\r\nintimate glimpses into his views. On one of these occasions, after she\r\nhad come out from his room and was sitting by me reading,\r\n\r\n"You\'re a wonder, Eleanore," I said. "I don\'t see how you\'ve done it."\r\n\r\n"Done what, my love?" asked Eleanore.\r\n\r\n"Wormed all his views out of poor old Joe."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t done anything of the sort. I\'ve learned over half of it from\r\nSue. She comes here often nowadays and we have long talks about him. Sue\r\nseems to know him rather well."\r\n\r\nThis did not interest me much, so I switched our talk to something that\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n"What bothers me," I said with a scowl, "is this infernal work of mine.\r\nWhat are you smiling at?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," she murmured, beginning to read. "But if I were you I\'d stick\r\nat my work. You\'re good at that."\r\n\r\n"Not now I\'m not," I retorted. "This story about the opera man isn\'t\r\ncoming on at all! The more I work the worse it gets!"\r\n\r\n"It will get better soon," she said.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure. Do you know what I think is the matter with me? I was\r\nin to-day looking at Joe asleep, and watching the lines in that face of\r\nhis it came over me all of a sudden what a wretched coward I\'ve been."\r\nEleanore looked up suddenly. "I know there\'s something in all his talk,\r\nI\'ve known it every time we\'ve met. His view\'s so distorted it makes me\r\nmad, but there\'s something in it you can\'t get away from. Poverty,\r\nthat\'s what it is, and I\'ve always steered way clear of it as though I\r\nwere afraid to look. I\'ve taken your father\'s point of view and left the\r\nslums for him and his friends to tackle when they get the time. I was\r\nonly too glad to be left out. But that hour with J. K. and his stokers\r\ngave me a jolt. I can feel it still. I can\'t seem to shake it off. And\r\nI\'m beginning to wonder now why I shouldn\'t get up the nerve to see for\r\nmyself, to have a good big look at it all--and write about it for a\r\nwhile."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t!" said Eleanore. "Leave it alone!" Her voice was so sharp it\r\nstartled me.\r\n\r\n"Why?" I rejoined. "You\'ve tackled poverty often enough. I guess I can\r\nstand it if you can."\r\n\r\n"You\'re different," she answered. "You leave poverty alone and force\r\nyourself to go on with your work. You\'ve made a very wonderful start.\r\nYou\'ll be ready to take up fiction soon. When you have, and when you\r\nhave gone so far that you can feel sure of your name and yourself, then\r\nyou can look at whatever you like."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what Joe would say to that."\r\n\r\n"I know what he\'ll say--he\'ll agree with me. Why don\'t you ask him and\r\nsee for yourself? I\'m beginning to like Joe Kramer," she added with a\r\nquiet smile, "because now that I understand him I know that his life and\r\nyours are so far apart you\'ve hardly a point in common."\r\n\r\nAnd in the talks I had with Joe this soon proved to be the case.\r\nEleanore brought us together now and listened with deep satisfaction as\r\nwe clashed and jarred each other apart.\r\n\r\nHis old indifferent manner was gone, he was softened, grateful for what\r\nwe had done--but he held to that view of his like a rock, and the view\r\nentirely shut me out. Joe saw society wholly as "War Sure" between two\r\nclasses, and I was hopelessly on the wrong side. My work, my home and my\r\nwhole life were bound in with the upper class. And there could be no\r\nmiddle ground. My boasted tolerance, breadth of mind, my readiness to\r\nsee both sides, my passion for showing up all men as human--this to Joe\r\nwas utter piffle. He had no use for such writing, or in fact for art of\r\nany kind. "Propaganda" was all that he wanted, and that could be as\r\ncheap as Nick Carter, as sentimental as Uncle Tom\'s Cabin, if only it\r\nhad the kind of "punch" that would reach to the mass of ignorant workers\r\nand stir their minds and their passions into swift and bitter revolt.\r\nRevolution! That was the thing. The world had come to a time, he said,\r\nwhen talking and writing weren\'t going to count. We were entering into\r\nan age of force--of "direct action"--strikes and the like--by prodigious\r\nmasses of men. All I could do was worthless.\r\n\r\nThese talks made me so indignant and sore, so sure that Joe and all his\r\nwork were utterly wild and that only in Dillon and his kind lay any hope\r\nof solving the dreary problems of the slums--that within a few days more\r\nI was delving into my opera man with a most determined approval. He at\r\nleast was a builder, he didn\'t want to tear everything down! In his\r\nevery scheme for a huge success I took now an aggravated delight. All my\r\nrecent tolerance gone, I threw into my work an intensity that I had not\r\nfelt in months.\r\n\r\nAnd Eleanore smiled contentedly, as though she knew what she was about.\r\nWhen at last the time came for Joe to leave, she was twice as friendly\r\nto him as I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nBut on coming home one evening two or three weeks later, I found\r\nEleanore reading aloud to our son with a most preoccupied look on her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Joe Kramer is coming to dinner," she said. "He called up this morning\r\nand said he\'d like to see us again. Sue is coming, too, as it happens.\r\nShe dropped in this afternoon."\r\n\r\nSue arrived a few minutes later, and at once I thought to myself I had\r\nnever seen her look so well. For once she had taken time to dress. She\r\nhad done her dark hair in a different way. Her color, which had been\r\npoor of late, to-night was most becomingly high, and those fascinating\r\neyes of hers were bright with a new animation.\r\n\r\n"She has found a fine new hobby," I thought.\r\n\r\nHer whole attitude to us was one of eager friendliness. She made much of\r\nwhat we had done for Joe.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no idea," she told me, "how he feels about you both." She was\r\nspeaking of this when Joe came in.\r\n\r\nHe, too, appeared to me different. Into his blunt manner had crept a\r\ncertain awkwardness, his gruff voice had an anxious note at times and\r\nhis eyes a hungry gleam. Poor old Joe, I thought. It must be hard,\r\ndespite all his talk, to see what he had missed in life, to feel what a\r\nsacrifice he had made. He had thrown everything aside, love, marriage,\r\nhome, all personal ties--to tackle this bleak business of slums. The\r\nmore pity he had such a twisted view. And as presently, in reply to\r\nSue\'s questions, he talked about the approaching strike, my irritation\r\nat his talk grew even sharper than before.\r\n\r\n"Your stokers and dock laborers," I interrupted hotly, "are about as\r\nfit to build up a mew world as they are to build a Brooklyn Bridge! When\r\nI compare them to Eleanore\'s father and his way of going to work"--I\r\nbroke off in exasperation. "Can\'t you see you\'re all just floundering in\r\na perfect swamp of ignorance?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Joe. "I don\'t see that----"\r\n\r\n"I\'m mighty glad you don\'t," said Sue. Eleanore turned on her abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Why are _you_ glad, Sue?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Because," Sue answered warmly, "he\'s where every one of us ought to be!\r\nHe\'s doing the work we all ought to be doing!"\r\n\r\n"Then why don\'t you do it?" said Joe. His voice was low but sharp as in\r\npain. The next instant he turned from Sue to me. "I mean all of you," he\r\nadded. I looked at him in astonishment. What had worked this change in\r\nJoe? In our last talk he had shut me out so completely. He seemed to\r\nfeel this at once himself, for he hastened to explain his remark. He had\r\nturned his back on Sue and was talking hard at me:\r\n\r\n"Of course I don\'t mean you can do it, Bill, unless you change your\r\nwhole view of life. But why shouldn\'t you change? You\'re young enough.\r\nThat look at a stokehole got hold of you hard. And if you\'re able to\r\nfeel like that why not do some thinking, too?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m thinking," I said grimly. "I told you before that I wanted to help.\r\nBut you said----"\r\n\r\n"I say it still," J. K. cut in. "If you want to help the people you\'ve\r\ngot to drop your efficiency gods. You\'ve got to believe in the people\r\nfirst--that all they need is waking up to handle this whole job\r\nthemselves. You\'ve got to see that they\'re waking up fast--all over the\r\nworld--that they\'re getting tired of gods above \'em slowly planning out\r\ntheir lives--that they don\'t want to wait till they\'re dead to be\r\nhappy--that they feel poverty every day like a million tons of brick on\r\ntheir chests--it\'s got so they can\'t even breathe without thinking! And\r\nyou\'ve got to see that what they\'re thinking is, \'Do it yourself and do\r\nit quick!\' The only thing that\'s keeping them back is that in these\r\ntimes of peace men get out of the habit of violence!\r\n\r\n"But the minute you get this clear in your mind, then I say you can help\r\n\'em. Because what\'s needed is so big. It\'s not only more pay and shorter\r\nhours and homes where they needn\'t die off like flies--they need more\r\nthan that--they need a change as much as you--in their whole way of\r\nlooking at things. They\'ve got to learn that they are a crowd--and can\'t\r\nget anywhere at all until all pull together. Ignorant? Of course they\r\nare! But that\'s where you and me come in--we can help \'em get together\r\nfaster than they would if left to themselves! You can help that way a\r\nlot--by writing to the tenements! _That\'s_ what I meant!"\r\n\r\nJoe stopped short. And after his passionate outburst, Eleanore spoke up\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n"This sounds funny from you," she said. "A few weeks ago you were just\r\nas sure that Billy could do nothing. What has made you change so?"\r\n\r\nJoe reddened and looked down at his hands.\r\n\r\n"I suppose," he said gruffly after a moment, "it\'s because I\'m still\r\nweak from typhoid--weak enough to want to see some one but stokers get\r\ninto the job that\'s become my life. You see," he muttered, "I was raised\r\namong people like you. It\'s a kind of a craving, I suppose--like\r\ncigarettes." Again he stopped short and there was a pause.\r\n\r\n"Rather natural," Sue murmured. Again he turned sharply from her to me.\r\n\r\n"I say you can help by your writing," he said. "You call my friends an\r\nignorant mob. But thousands of \'em have read your stuff!"\r\n\r\nI looked up at Joe with a start.\r\n\r\n"Oh they don\'t like it," he went on. "It only makes \'em sore and mad.\r\nBut if you ever see things right, and get into their side of this fight\r\nwith that queer fountain-axe of yours, you\'ll be surprised at the\r\ntenement friends who\'ll pop up all around you. The first thing you know\r\nthey\'ll be calling you \'Bill.\' That\'s the kind they are--they don\'t want\r\nto shut anyone out--all they want to know is whether he means business.\r\nIf he doesn\'t he\'s no use, because they know that sooner or later\r\nthey\'ll do it anyhow themselves. It\'s going to be the biggest fight\r\nthat\'s happened since the world began! No cause has ever been so fine,\r\nso worth a man\'s giving his life to aid! And all you\'ve got to decide is\r\nthis--whether you\'re to get in now, and help make it a little easier,\r\nhelp make it come without violence--or wait till it all comes to a crash\r\nand then be yanked in like a sack of meal!"\r\n\r\nBefore I could speak, Sue drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how there\'s any choice about that," she said.\r\n\r\nEleanore turned to her again:\r\n\r\n"Do you mean for Billy?"\r\n\r\n"I mean for us all," Sue answered. "Even for a person like me!" Sue was\r\nbeautiful just then--her cheeks aglow, her features tense, a radiant\r\neagerness in her eyes. "I\'ve felt it, oh so long," she said. "It\'s gone\r\nall through my suffrage work--through every speech that I have\r\nmade--that the suffragists need the working girls and ought to help them\r\nwin their strikes!"\r\n\r\n"And what do _you_ think, Joe?" Eleanore persisted. "Were you speaking\r\nof Billy alone just now or did you have Sue, too, in mind?"\r\n\r\nJoe looked back at her steadily.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to shut out the women," he said. "I\'ve seen too many girls\r\njump in and make a big success of it. Not only working girls, but plenty\r\nof college girls like you." He turned from Eleanore to Sue--and with a\r\ngruff intensity, "You may think you can\'t do it, Sue," he said. "But I\r\nknow you can. I\'ve seen it done, I tell you, all the way from here to\r\nthe Coast--girls like you as speakers, as regular organizers--forgetting\r\nthemselves and sinking themselves--ready for any job that comes."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way I should want to do it," said Sue, her voice a little\r\nbreathless.\r\n\r\n"But how about wives?" asked Eleanore. "For some of these girls marry, I\r\nsuppose," she added thoughtfully. "At least I hope they do. I hope Sue\r\nwill."\r\n\r\n"I never said anything against that," Joe answered shortly.\r\n\r\n"But if they marry and have children," Eleanore continued, "aren\'t they\r\napt to get sick of it then, even bitter about it, this movement you\r\nspeak of that takes you in and sinks you down, swallows up every dollar\r\nyou have and all your thoughts and feelings?"\r\n\r\n"It needn\'t do as much as that," Joe muttered as though to himself.\r\n\r\n"Still--I\'d like to see it work out," Eleanore persisted. "Do you happen\r\nto know the wives of any labor leaders?"\r\n\r\n"I do," Joe answered quickly. "The wife of the biggest man we\'ve got.\r\nJim Marsh arrived in town last night. His wife is with him. She always\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"Now are you satisfied, dear?" Sue asked. But Eleanore smiled and shook\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n"Is Mrs. Marsh a radical, too--I mean an agitator?" she asked. Joe\'s\r\nface had clouded a little.\r\n\r\n"Not exactly," he replied. Eleanore\'s eyes were attentive now:\r\n\r\n"Do you know her well, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve met her----"\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to meet her, too," she said. "And find out how she likes her\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"I think I know what you\'d find," said Sue, in her old cocksure,\r\nsuperior manner. "I guess she likes it well enough----"\r\n\r\n"Still, dear," Eleanore murmured, "instead of taking things for granted\r\nit would be interesting, I think, in all this talk to have one look at a\r\nlittle real life."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you just a little afraid of real life, Eleanore?" Sue demanded,\r\nin a quick challenging tone.\r\n\r\n"Am I?" asked Eleanore placidly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLong after Joe had left us, Sue kept up that challenging tone. But she\r\ndid not speak to Eleanore now, her talk like Joe\'s was aimed at me.\r\n\r\n"Why not think it over, Billy?" she urged. "You\'re not happy now, I\r\nnever saw you so worried and blue."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not in the least!" I said stoutly. But Sue did not seem to hear me.\r\nShe went on in an eager, absorbed sort of way:\r\n\r\n"Why not try it a little? You needn\'t go as far as Joe Kramer. He may\r\neven learn to go slower himself--now that he has had typhoid----"\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?" Eleanore put in.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" cried Sue impatiently. "If he keeps on at this pace it will\r\nkill him! Has he no right to some joy in life? Why should you two have\r\nit all? Just think of it, Billy, you have a name, success and a lot of\r\npower! Why not use it here? Suppose it is harder! Oh, I get so out of\r\npatience with myself and all of us! Our easy, lazy, soft little lives!\r\nWhy can\'t we _give_ ourselves a little?" And she went back over all Joe\r\nhad said. "It\'s all so real. So tremendously real," she ended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I wonder what\'s going to happen," said Eleanore when we were alone.\r\n\r\n"God knows," I answered gloomily. That hammering from Joe and Sue had\r\nstirred me up all over again. I had doggedly resisted, I had told Sue\r\nalmost angrily that I meant to keep right on as before. But now she was\r\ngone, I was not so sure. "I still feel certain Joe\'s all wrong," I said\r\naloud. "But he and his kind are so dead in earnest--so ready for any\r\nsacrifice to push their utterly wild ideas--that they may get a lot of\r\npower. God help the country if they do."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t speaking of the country, my love," my wife informed me\r\ncheerfully. "I was speaking of Sue and Joe Kramer."\r\n\r\n"Joe," I replied, "will slam right ahead. You can be sure of that, I\'ve\r\ngot him down cold."\r\n\r\n"Have you?" she asked. "And how about Sue?"\r\n\r\n"Oh Sue," I replied indifferently, "has been enthused so many times."\r\n\r\n"Billy."\r\n\r\nI turned and saw my wife regarding her husband thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," she said, "how long it will be before you can write a love\r\nstory."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Sue and Joe Kramer, you idiot."\r\n\r\nI stared at her dumfounded.\r\n\r\n"Did you think all that talk was aimed at you?" my pitiless spouse\r\ncontinued. "Did you think all that change in Joe\'s point of view was on\r\nyour account?"\r\n\r\nI watched her vigilantly for a while.\r\n\r\n"If there\'s anything in what you say," I remarked carefully at last,\r\n"I\'ll bet at least that Joe doesn\'t know it. He doesn\'t even suspect\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"There are so many things," said Eleanore, "that men don\'t even suspect\r\nin themselves. I\'m sorry," she added regretfully. "But that summer\r\nvacation we\'d planned is off."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, we\'ll stay right here in town. I see anything but a pleasant\r\nsummer."\r\n\r\n"Suppose," I said excitedly, "you tell me exactly what you _do_ see!"\r\n\r\n"I see something," Eleanore answered, "which unless we can stop it may\r\nbe a very tragic affair. Tragic for Sue because I feel sure that she\'d\r\nnever stand Joe\'s impossible life. And even worse for your father. He\'s\r\nnot only old and excitable, and very weak and feeble, too, but he\'s so\r\nconservative besides that if Sue married Joe Kramer he\'d consider her\r\nutterly damned."\r\n\r\n"But I tell you you\'re wrong, all wrong!" I broke in. "Joe isn\'t that\r\nkind of an idiot!"\r\n\r\n"Joe," said my wife decidedly, "is like every man I\'ve ever met. I found\r\nthat out when he was sick. He has the old natural longing for a wife and\r\na home of his own. His glimpse of it here may have started it rising.\r\nI\'m no more sure than you are that he admits it to himself. But it\'s\r\nthere all the same in the back of his mind, and in that same mysterious\r\nregion he\'s trying to reconcile marrying Sue to the work which he\r\nbelieves in--even with this strike coming on. It\'s perfectly pathetic.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it funny," she added, "how sometimes everything comes all at\r\nonce? Do you know what this may mean to us? I don\'t, I haven\'t the least\r\nidea. I only know that you yourself are horribly unsettled--and that now\r\nthrough this affair of Sue\'s we\'ll have to see a good deal of Joe--and\r\nnot only Joe but his friends on the docks--and not even the quiet ones.\r\nNo, we\'re to see all the wild ones. We\'re to be drawn right into this\r\nstrike--into what Joe calls revolution."\r\n\r\n"You may be right," I said doggedly. "But I don\'t believe it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later Joe called me up and asked me to come down to his\r\noffice. His reason for wanting to see me, he said, he\'d rather not give\r\nme over the \'phone.\r\n\r\n"You\'re right," I told Eleanore dismally. "He\'s going to talk to me\r\nabout Sue."\r\n\r\nI dreaded this talk, and I went to see Joe in no easy frame of mind. But\r\nit was not about Sue. I saw that in my first glimpse of his face. He sat\r\nhalf around in his office chair listening intensely to a man by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n"I want you to meet Jim Marsh," he said.\r\n\r\nI felt a little electric shock. So here was the great mob agitator, the\r\nnotorious leader of strikes. Eleanore\'s words came into my mind: "We\'re\r\nto meet all the wild ones. We\'re to be drawn right into this\r\nstrike--into what Joe calls revolution." Well, here was the\r\narch-revolutionist, the prime mover of them all. Of middle size, about\r\nforty years old, angular and wiry, there was a lithe easy force in his\r\nlimbs, but he barely moved as he spoke to me now. He just turned his\r\nnarrow bony face and gave me a glance with his keen gray eyes.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve known your work for quite a while," he said in a low drawling\r\nvoice, "Joe says you\'re thinking of writing me up."\r\n\r\nSo this was why Joe had sent for me. I had quite forgotten this idea,\r\nbut I took to it eagerly now. My work was going badly. Here was\r\nsomething I could do, the life story of a man whose picture would soon\r\nbe on the front page of every paper in New York. It would interest my\r\nmagazine, it would give me a chance to get myself clear on this whole\r\nugly business of labor, poverty and strikes. I had evaded it long\r\nenough, I would turn and face it squarely now.\r\n\r\n"Why yes, I\'d like to try," I said.\r\n\r\n"He wants to do your picture with the America you know," said Joe. "He\r\nsays he\'s ready to be shown."\r\n\r\nMarsh glanced out at the harbor.\r\n\r\n"If he\'ll trail around with us for a while we may show him some of it\r\nhere," he drawled. And then quietly ignoring my presence he continued\r\nhis talk with Joe, as though taking it for granted that I was an\r\ninterested friend. I listened there all afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe thing that struck me most at first was the cool effrontery of the\r\nman in undertaking such a struggle. The old type of labor leader had at\r\nleast stuck to one industry, and had known by close experience what he\r\nhad to face. But here was a mere outsider, a visitor strolling into a\r\nplace and saying, "I guess I\'ll stop all this." Vaguely I knew what he\r\nhad to contend with. Sitting here in this cheap bare room, the thought\r\nof other rooms rose in my mind, spacious, handsomely furnished rooms\r\nwhere at one time or another I had interviewed heads of foreign ship\r\ncompanies, railroad presidents, bankers and lawyers, newspaper editors,\r\nmen representing enormous wealth. All these rooms had been parts of my\r\nharbor--a massed array of money and brains. He would have all this\r\nagainst him. And to such a struggle I could see no end for him but jail.\r\n\r\nFor against all this, on his side, was a chaotic army of ignorant men,\r\nstokers, dockers, teamsters, scattered all over this immense region,\r\npractically unorganized. What possible chance to bring them together?\r\nHow could he feel that he had a chance? How much did he already know?\r\n\r\nI asked him what he had seen of the harbor. For days, I learned, he had\r\ntold no one but Joe of his coming, he had wandered about the port by\r\nhimself. And as a veteran tramp will in some mysterious fashion get the\r\nfeel of a new town within a few short hours there, so Marsh had got the\r\nfeel of this place--of a harbor different from mine, for he felt it from\r\nthe point of view of its hundred thousand laborers. He felt it with its\r\nhuman fringe, he saw its various tenement borders like so many camps and\r\nbivouacs on the eve of a battle.\r\n\r\nHe told a little incident of how the harbor learned he was here. About\r\nnine o\'clock one morning, as he was waiting his chance to get into one\r\nof the North River docks, a teamster recognized him there from a picture\r\nof him he had once seen. The news traveled swiftly along the docks, out\r\nonto piers and into ships. And at noon, way over in Hoboken, Marsh had\r\noverheard a German docker say to the man eating lunch beside him,\r\n\r\n"I hear dot tamn fool anarchist Marsh is raising hell ofer dere in New\r\nYork."\r\n\r\n"But I wasn\'t raising hell," he drawled. "I was over here studying\r\nliterature." And he drew out from his pocket a tattered copy of a\r\nreport, the result of a careful investigation of work on the docks, made\r\nrecently by a most conservative philanthropic organization.\r\n\r\n"\'In all the fierce rush of American industry,\'" he read, with a quiet\r\nsmile of derision, "\'no work is so long, so irregular or more full of\r\ndanger. Seven a. m. until midnight is a common work day here, and in the\r\nrush season of winter when ships are often delayed by storms and so must\r\nmake up time in port, the same men often work all day and night and even\r\non into the following day, with only hour and half-hour stops for\r\ncoffee, food or liquor. This strain makes for accidents. From police\r\nreports and other sources we find that six thousand killed and injured\r\nevery year on the docks is a conservative estimate.\'"\r\n\r\nMarsh glanced dryly up at me:\r\n\r\n"Here\'s the America I know."\r\n\r\nI said nothing. I was appalled. Six thousand killed and injured! I could\r\nfeel his sharp gray eyes boring down into my soul:\r\n\r\n"You wrote up this harbor once."\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said.\r\n\r\n"Did you write this?"\r\n\r\n"No. I would have said it was a lie."\r\n\r\n"Do you say so now? These people are a careful crowd." I took the\r\npamphlet from his hands.\r\n\r\n"Queer," I muttered vaguely. "I never saw this report before."\r\n\r\n"Not so queer," he answered. "I\'m told that it wasn\'t _meant_ to be\r\nseen--by you and the general public. That\'s the way this society works.\r\nThey spend half a dead old lady\'s cash investigating poverty and the\r\nother half in keeping the public from learning what they\'ve discovered.\r\nBut we\'re going to furnish publicity to this secluded work of art.\r\n\r\n"On Saturday afternoon," he continued, "I went along the North River\r\ndocks. I found long lines of dockers there--they were waiting for their\r\npay. At every pay window one of \'em stood with an empty cigar box in his\r\nhands--and into that box every man as he passed dropped a part of his\r\npay--for the man who had been hurt that week--for him or for his widow.\r\n\r\n"And over across the way," he went on, "I saw something on the\r\nwaterfront that fitted right into the scenery. It was a poster on a high\r\nfence, and it had a black border around it. On one side of it was a\r\npicture of a tall gent in a swell frock suit. He was looking squarely at\r\nthe docks and pointing to the sign beside him, which said, \'_Certainly_\r\nI\'m talking to you! Money saved is money earned. Read what I will\r\nfurnish you for seventy-five dollars--cash. Black cloth or any color you\r\nlike--plush or imitation oak--casket with a good white or cream\r\nlining--pillow--burial suit or brown habit--draping and embalming\r\nroom--chairs--hearse--three coaches--complete care and attendance--also\r\nhandsome candelabra and candles if requested.\'"\r\n\r\nAs Marsh read this grisly list from his notebook, it suddenly came into\r\nmy mind that in my explorations years ago I had seen this poster at many\r\npoints, all along the waterfront. It had made no impression on me then,\r\nfor it had not fitted into my harbor. But Marsh had caught its meaning\r\nat once and had promptly jotted it down for use. For it fitted his\r\nharbor exactly.\r\n\r\nVaguely, in this and a dozen ways, I could feel him taking my harbor to\r\npieces, transforming each piece into something grim and so building a\r\nharbor all his own. Disturbedly and angrily I struggled to find the\r\nflaws in his building, eagerly I caught at distortions here and there,\r\ntwisted facts and wrong conclusions. But in all the terrible stuff which\r\nhe had so hastily gathered here, there was so much that I could not\r\ndeny. And he gave no chance for argument. Quickly jumping from point to\r\npoint he pictured a harbor of slaves overburdened, driven into fierce\r\nrevolt. It was hard to keep my footing.\r\n\r\nFor his talk was not only of this harbor. It ranged out over an ocean\r\nworld which was all in a state of ferment and change. Men of every race\r\nand creed, from English, Germans, Russians to Coolies, Japs and Lascars,\r\nhad crowded into the stokeholes, mixing bowls for all the world. And the\r\nmixing process had begun. At Copenhagen, two years before, in a great\r\nmarine convention that followed the socialist congress there, Marsh had\r\nseen the delegates from seventeen different countries representing\r\nmillions of seamen. And this crude world parliament, this international\r\nbrotherhood, had placed itself on record as against wars of every kind,\r\nexcept the one deepening bitter war of labor against capital. To further\r\nthis they had proposed to paralyze by strikes the whole international\r\ntransport world. The first had followed promptly, breaking out in\r\nEngland. The second was to take place here.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t see how it can happen," said Marsh, with one of those keen\r\nsudden looks that showed he was aware of my presence. "You admit this\r\nplace is a watery hell, but you don\'t believe we can change it. You\r\ndon\'t see how ignorant mobs of men can rise up and take the whole game\r\nin their hands. Do I get you right?"\r\n\r\n"You do," I said.\r\n\r\n"Look over there."\r\n\r\nI followed his glance to the doorway. It was filled with a group of big\r\nragged men. Some of the faces were black with soot, some were smiling\r\nstolidly, some scowling in the effort to hear. All eyes were intent on\r\nthe face of the man who had never been known to lose a strike.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the beginning," Marsh told me. "You keep your eyes on their\r\nfaces--from now on right into the strike--and you may see something grow\r\nthere that\'ll give you a new religion."\r\n\r\nAs the day wore into evening the crowd from outside pressed into the\r\nroom until they were packed all around us.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s get out of this," said Joe at last. We went to a neighboring\r\nlunchroom and ate a hasty supper. But as here, too, the crowd pressed in\r\nto get a look at Marsh, Joe asked us to come up to his room.\r\n\r\n"They _know_ your room," Marsh answered. His tone was grim, as though he\r\nhad been accustomed for years to this ceaselessly curious pressing mass,\r\npressing, pressing around him tight. "Suppose we go up to mine," he\r\nsaid. "I want you fellows to meet my wife. She has never met any writers\r\nbefore," he added to me, "and she\'s interested in that kind of thing.\r\nShe was a music teacher once."\r\n\r\nI was about to decline and start for home, but suddenly I recalled\r\nEleanore\'s saying that she would like to meet Mrs. Marsh. So I accepted\r\nhis invitation. And what I saw a few minutes later brought me down\r\nabruptly from these world-wide schemes for labor.\r\n\r\nWe entered a small, cheap hotel, climbed a flight of stairs and came\r\ninto the narrow bedroom which was for the moment this notorious\r\nwanderer\'s home. A little girl about six years old lay asleep on a cot\r\nin one corner, and under the one electric light a woman sat reading a\r\nmagazine. She had a strong rather clever face which would have been\r\nappealing if it were not for the bitter impatient glance she gave us as\r\nwe entered.\r\n\r\n"Talk low, boys, our little girl\'s asleep," Marsh said. "Say, Sally," he\r\ncontinued, with his faint, derisive smile, "here\'s a writer come to see\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Pleased to meet you, I\'m sure," she said, then relapsed into a stiff\r\nsilence. I tried to break through her awkwardness but entirely without\r\navail. I grew more and more sure of my first impression, that this woman\r\nhated her husband\'s friends, his strikes, his "proletariate." She was\r\nsmart, pushing, ambitious, I thought, just the kind that would have got\r\non in any middle western town. Eleanore must meet her.\r\n\r\nThen presently I noticed that only Marsh was talking. I glanced at Joe\r\nand was startled by the intensity in his eyes.\r\n\r\nFor Joe was watching his leader\'s wife. And watching, he appeared to me\r\nto be seeing her in a dreary succession of rooms like these, in cities,\r\ntowns and mining camps, wherever her husband was leading a strike--and\r\nthen trying to see his own home in such rooms, and Sue in his home, a\r\nwife like this. The picture struck me suddenly cold. Sue pulled into\r\nthis for life! Again I remembered Eleanore\'s words--"Drawn into\r\nrevolution."\r\n\r\n"Say, Joe," drawled Marsh, with a sharp look at him. "Got any of that\r\ntyphoid left?"\r\n\r\nJoe laughed quickly, confusedly.\r\n\r\nSoon after that I left them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day I went to the editor for whom I was doing most of my work.\r\nWhen I told him I wanted to try Jim Marsh, the editor looked at me\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n"Why?" he asked.\r\n\r\nI spoke of the impending strike.\r\n\r\n"Have you met Marsh?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Do you like him?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"But he struck you as big."\r\n\r\n"Yes--he did."\r\n\r\n"Are you getting interested in strikes?"\r\n\r\n"I want to see a big one close."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Why not?" I retorted. "They\'re getting to be significant, aren\'t they?\r\nI want to see what they\'re like inside." The editor smiled:\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find them rather hot inside. Don\'t get overheated."\r\n\r\n"Oh you needn\'t think I\'ll lose my head."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," he said quietly. "Go ahead with your story about Marsh.\r\nI\'ll be interested to see what you do."\r\n\r\nI went out of the office in no easy frame of mind. The editor\'s\r\ninquisitive tone had started me thinking of how J. K. had been shut out\r\nby the papers because he wrote "the truth about things."\r\n\r\n"Oh that\'s all rot," I told myself. "Joe\'s case and mine are not the\r\nsame. The magazines aren\'t like the papers and I\'m not like Joe. His\r\nidea of the truth and mine will never be anywhere near alike."\r\n\r\nBut what would Eleanore think of it? I went home and told her of my\r\nplan. To my surprise she made no objection.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the best thing you can do," she said. "We\'re in this now--on\r\naccount of Sue--we can\'t keep out. And so long as we are, you might as\r\nwell write about it, too. You think so much better when you\'re at\r\nwork--more clearly--don\'t you--and that\'s what I want." She was looking\r\nat me steadily out of those gray-blue eyes of hers. "I want you to think\r\nyourself all out--as clearly as you possibly can--and then write just\r\nwhat you think," she said. "I want you to feel that I\'m never afraid of\r\nanything you may ever write--so long as you\'re really sure it\'s true."\r\n\r\nI held her a moment in my arms and felt her tremble slightly. And then\r\nshe said with her old quiet smile:\r\n\r\n"Sue has asked us over to Brooklyn to-night--Joe Kramer is to be there,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"That affair is moving rather fast."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, quite fast," she said cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"How will Dad look at it?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"As you did," said Eleanore dryly. "He\'ll look at it and see nothing at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve half a mind to tell him!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t," she said. "If you did he would only get excited, become the\r\nold-fashioned father and order Sue to leave Joe alone--which would be\r\nall that is needed now to make Sue marry Joe in a week."\r\n\r\n"Sue is about as selfish," I said hotly, "about as wrapped up in her own\r\nlittle self----"\r\n\r\n"As any girl is who thinks she\'s in love but isn\'t sure," said Eleanore.\r\n"Sue isn\'t sure--poor thing--she\'s frightfully unsettled."\r\n\r\n"But why drag Joe way over there?"\r\n\r\n"Because she wants to look at him there. It\'s her home, you know, her\r\nwhole past life, all that she has been used to. It\'s the place where she\r\nhas breakfast. She wants to see how Joe fits in."\r\n\r\n"But they\'d never live _there_ if they married!"\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless," said Eleanore, "that\'s one of the ways a girl makes up\r\nher mind." She looked pityingly into my eyes. "Women are beyond\r\nyou--aren\'t they, dear?" she murmured.\r\n\r\n"J. K. isn\'t," I rejoined. "And I can\'t see him in _any_ home!"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you! Then watch him a little closer the next time he comes to\r\nours."\r\n\r\nI went out for a walk along the docks and tried to picture the coming\r\nstrike. When I came home I found Joe there, he had come to go with us to\r\nBrooklyn. He was sitting on the floor with our boy gravely intent on a\r\ntoy circus. Neither one was saying a word, but as Joe carefully poised\r\nan elephant on the top of a tall red ladder, I recalled my wife\'s\r\ninjunction. By Jove, he did fit into a home, here certainly was a\r\ndifferent Joe. He did not see me at the door. Later I called to him from\r\nour bedroom:\r\n\r\n"Say, Joe. Don\'t you want to come in and wash?"\r\n\r\nHe came in, and presently watching him I noticed his glances about our\r\nroom. It was most decidedly Eleanore\'s room, from the flowered curtains\r\nto the warm soft rug on the floor. It was gay, it was quiet and restful,\r\nit was intimately personal. Here was her desk with a small heap of\r\nletters and photographs of our son and of me, and here close by was her\r\ndressing-table strewn with all its dainty equipment. A few invitations\r\nwere stuck in the mirror. Eleanore\'s hat and crumpled white gloves lay\r\non our bed. I had thrown my coat beside them. There were such things in\r\nthis small room as Joe had never dreamed of.\r\n\r\n"Oh Joe," said Eleanore from the hall. "Don\'t you want to come into the\r\nnursery? Somebody wants a pillow fight."\r\n\r\n"Sure," said Joe, with a queer little start.\r\n\r\n"By the way," I heard her add outside. "Billy told me he saw Mrs. Marsh,\r\nand I should so like to meet her, too. Couldn\'t you have us all down to\r\nyour room some evening?"\r\n\r\n"If you like," he answered gruffly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m honestly curious," Eleanore said, "to see what kind of a person she\r\nis. And I\'m sure that Sue is, too. May we bring her with us?"\r\n\r\n"Of course you may--whenever you like."\r\n\r\n"Would Friday evening be too soon?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see if I can fix it."\r\n\r\nWhen Eleanore came in to me, her lips were set tight as though something\r\nhad hurt her.\r\n\r\n"That was pretty tough," I muttered.\r\n\r\n"Yes, wasn\'t it," she said quickly. "I don\'t care, I\'m not going to have\r\nhim marrying Sue. I\'m too fond of both of them. Besides, your father has\r\nto be thought of. It would simply kill him!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Yes," I thought to myself that night. "No doubt about that, it would\r\nkill him."\r\n\r\nHow much older he looked, in the strong light of the huge old-fashioned\r\ngas lamp that hung over the dining-room table. He was making a visible\r\neffort to be young and genial. He had not seen Joe in several years, and\r\nhe evidently knew nothing whatever of what Joe was up to, except that he\r\nhad been ill at our home. Joe spoke of what we had done for him, and Sue\r\neagerly took up the cue, keeping the talk upon us and "the Indian," to\r\nmy father\'s deep satisfaction. From this she turned to our childhood and\r\nthe life in this old house. Dad pictured it all in such glowing colors I\r\nrecognized almost nothing as real. But watching Sue\'s face as she\r\nlistened, she seemed to me trying to feel again as she had felt here\r\nlong ago when she had been his only chum. Every few moments she would\r\nbreak off to throw a quick, restless glance at Joe.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for us to go, my father assured us warmly that he had\r\nnot felt so young in years. He said we had so stirred him up that he\r\nmust take a book and read or he wouldn\'t sleep a wink all night. Joe did\r\nnot come away with us. As we stood all together at the door, I saw\r\nEleanore glance into Dad\'s study where his heavy leather chair was\r\nwaiting, and then into the room across the hall where Sue had drawn up\r\ntwo chairs to the fire. And I thought of the next hour or two. My father\r\nalready had under his arm a book on American shipping, which told about\r\nthe old despotic sea world of his day, in which there had been no\r\nstrikers but only mutineers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"There\'s very little time to lose," said Eleanore on the way home.\r\n\r\n"Look here," I suggested. "Why don\'t you talk this out with Sue, and\r\ntell her just what you think of it all?"\r\n\r\n"Because," said Eleanore, "what I think and what you think has nothing\r\nwhatever to do with the case. Sue would say it was none of our business.\r\nAnd she\'d be quite right. It isn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t we making it our business?" My wife at times gets me so\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not _telling_ them anything," she rejoined. "I\'m only trying to\r\n_show_ them something and let the poor idiots see for themselves. If\r\nthey won\'t see, it\'s hopeless."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Friday evening Sue sent word that she would be late and that she\r\nwould meet us at Joe\'s room. So we went down without her.\r\n\r\nHis room had changed since I\'d seen it last, I took in at once his\r\npathetic attempts to fix it up for our coming. Gone were the dirty\r\ncurtains, the dirty collars and shirts, and the bed was concealed by an\r\nold green screen borrowed from his landlady, the German saloon-keeper\'s\r\nwife below. The same woman had scrubbed the floor and put down a faded\r\nrag carpet in front of the old fireplace, in which now a coal fire was\r\nburning. Poor Joe had turned up all the lights to make things bright and\r\ncheerful, but it only showed things up as they were. The room was\r\nglaringly forlorn.\r\n\r\nAnd now that Eleanore had come, her presence made him feel at once what\r\na wretchedly dreary place it was. Eleanore knew what she wanted to do\r\nand she had dressed herself for the part. And as Joe took in the effect\r\nof her smart little suit, and waited for Sue and Mrs. Marsh, he became\r\nso anxious and gloomy that he could only speak with an effort. He kept\r\nglancing uneasily at the door.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like the idea," said Eleanore, "of Sue\'s coming down here alone\r\nat night through this part of town." Joe looked around at her quickly.\r\n"But I suppose," she added thoughtfully, "that she\'d have to get used to\r\nqueer parts of towns if she ever took up the life you spoke of."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that would bother her," Joe answered gruffly.\r\n\r\nPresently there was a step on the stairs. He jumped up and went to the\r\ndoor, and a moment later Sue entered the room.\r\n\r\nImmediately its whole atmosphere changed. Sue was plainly excited. She,\r\ntoo, had dressed herself with care--or rather with a careful neglect.\r\nShe wore the oldest suit she had and a simple blouse with a gay red tie.\r\nWith one sharp glance at Eleanore, she took in the strained situation\r\nand set about to ease it.\r\n\r\n"What a nice old fireplace," she exclaimed. "Let\'s turn down the lights\r\nand draw \'round the fire. You need more chairs, Joe; go down and get\r\nsome."\r\n\r\nAnd soon with the lights turned low and the coals stirred into a ruddy\r\nglow, we were sitting in quite a dramatic place, the scene was set for\r\n"revolution." The curtainless windows were no longer bleak, for through\r\nthem from the now darkened room we looked out on the lights of the\r\nharbor. Sue thought the view thrilling, and equally thrilling she found\r\nthe last issue of Joe\'s weekly paper, _War Sure_, which lay on the\r\ntable. It was called "Our Special Sabotage Number," and in it various\r\nstokers and dockers, in response to an appeal from Joe, had crudely\r\nwritten their ideas upon just how the engines of a ship or the hoisting\r\nwinches on a dock could be most effectively put out of order in time of\r\nstrike. "So that the scabs," wrote one contributor, "can see how they\r\nlike it."\r\n\r\n"Why not have blue-penciled some of this?" I asked, with a faint\r\npremonition of trouble ahead.\r\n\r\n"Because Joe believes in free speech, I suppose," Sue answered for him\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not much of a lawyer, Joe," I said. "But this stuff looks to me a\r\ngood deal like incitement to violence."\r\n\r\n"Possibly," J. K replied.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t look horribly frightened," laughed Sue. And she wanted to\r\nhear all the latest strike news. The time was rapidly drawing near. It\r\nwas now close to the end of March and the strike was expected in April.\r\n\r\nWhen Marsh arrived about nine o\'clock, there was an awkward moment. For\r\nbehind him came his wife and their small daughter, both of whom were\r\nstiffly dressed, and with one glance at Eleanore they felt immediately\r\nout of place. Mrs. Marsh was even more hostile and curt than when I had\r\nseen her last. She was angry at having been dragged into this and took\r\nlittle pains to hide it.\r\n\r\n"My husband would have me come," she said. "And I couldn\'t leave my\r\nlittle girl, so I had to bring her along." And she stopped abruptly with\r\na look that asked us plainly, "Now that I\'m here, what do you want?"\r\n\r\n"How old is your little girl?" Eleanore inquired.\r\n\r\n"Six last month."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to put her in school in New York?"\r\n\r\nAnd in spite of short suspicious replies she soon had Mrs. Marsh and her\r\nchild talking of kindergartens and parks and other parts of the town\r\nthey must see. Sue was now eagerly talking to Marsh, Joe was beside her\r\nhelping her out, and both seemed wholly to have forgotten the disturbing\r\nwoman behind them. But by the quick looks that Eleanore gave them now\r\nand then, I could see she was only holding back until she should have\r\nMrs. Marsh in a mood where she could be brought into the talk and made\r\nto tell about her life.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you ever want to settle down?" she asked when there had come a\r\npause. Marsh turned abruptly to Eleanore.\r\n\r\n"Of course she does," he answered. "Did you ever know a woman who\r\ndidn\'t, the minute that she got a kid? But my wife can\'t, if she sticks\r\nto me. She has had to make up her mind to live in any old place that\r\ncomes along, from a dollar room in a cheap hotel to a shanty in a mining\r\ncamp." And his look at Eleanore seemed to add, "That\'s the kind she is,\r\nyou little doll."\r\n\r\nEleanore quickly made herself look as much like a doll as possible. She\r\nplacidly folded her dainty gloved hands.\r\n\r\n"I should think," she murmured in ladylike tones, "Mrs. Marsh would find\r\nthat rather difficult."\r\n\r\n"She does," said Marsh aggressively. "But my wife has nerve enough to\r\nstand up to the rough side of life--as the wives of most workingmen\r\nhave to--in this rich and glorious land."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you tell us about it?" asked Eleanore sweetly. "I should be so\r\ninterested to hear. It\'s so different, you see, from all I\'ve been\r\naccustomed to."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Marsh answered grimly, "I\'ve no doubt it is. Go ahead, Sally, and\r\ntell them about it."\r\n\r\nAnd Sally did. Gladly taking her husband\'s aggressive tone, she started\r\nout almost with a sneer. Her remarks at first were disjointed and brief,\r\nbut I told her I was writing the story of her husband\'s life, that I\r\nwanted her side of it from the start. I promised to show her what I\r\nwrote and let her cut anything she had told me if she did not want it in\r\nprint. And so in scattered incidents, with bits thrown in now and then\r\nby Marsh, the lives of these two began to come out. And we understood\r\nher bitterness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Mr. Marsh was born," she said, "in one of the poorest little towns in\r\nSouthern Iowa. It was nothing but a hole of a place about six miles from\r\nthe county seat where my father was a lawyer. But even in that little\r\nhole his family was the poorest there. I\'ve been all over the States\r\nsince then, and I\'ve seen poor people, the Lord knows--but I want to say\r\nI\'ve never seen people anywhere that were any worse off than my husband\r\nwas when he was a boy. And yet he got out of it all by himself. He\r\ndidn\'t need any strikes to help him."\r\n\r\n"But of course," Sue put in smoothly, "your husband was an exceptional\r\nman." Mrs. Marsh threw her a bitter glance.\r\n\r\n"He might have been," she answered.\r\n\r\n"What was he like as a boy?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"A fighter," she said. For a moment her sharp voice grew proud. "His\r\nfather took diabetes and died, and they went into debt to bury him. Jim\r\nhelped his mother run the farm and missed half his schooling. But his\r\nteacher loaned him text-books--and at home they had no candles, so he\r\nused to work with his back to the fire--half the night. My father used\r\nto call him a regular little Honest Abe. That\'s a surprise to you, isn\'t\r\nit," she added with a hard little laugh.\r\n\r\n"But then the town had a sudden boom. A new branch of the railroad came\r\nthrough that way and houses and stores went up over night. Jim was only\r\nsixteen then, but he grabbed the chance to get into the building. In\r\nless than a year he had earned enough money so he could quit and go to\r\nschool. He came over to high school in our town, walking his six miles\r\ntwice a day. And that\'s where I met him.\r\n\r\n"My father took a shine to him right off and promised to make him a\r\nlawyer. He loaned him law books the first year, and the second Jim\r\nworked in his office." She looked for a moment at the wall. "I expect\r\nit\'s not a love story you\'re after--so I\'ll leave that part of it out.\r\nPapa was mad when I broke the news--and I can\'t say I blame him. He was\r\nthe richest man in town, the railroad lawyer of the place--and he had\r\nmeant that I should go to a polishing school in St. Louis.\r\n\r\n"Well, I did go to St. Louis, but I was eloping at the time and I became\r\nJim\'s wife. We had a hard fight for a year or two, but we made up our\r\nminds we\'d make it go. Jim got a job on a skyscraper which was going up\r\nat that time. I got him his breakfast at six every morning and he got\r\nhome about seven at night, and right after supper he went at his\r\nBlackstone and dug into it all evening. As a rule he got to bed at one,\r\nand five hours\' sleep was all he had--with a few hours extra Sundays.\r\n\r\n"I knew a girl from home in St. Louis whose husband was making money\r\nfast. But Jim was too proud to make use of my friends or go to her home\r\nwhen we were invited. We missed three card parties on that account. But\r\nshe helped me get some pupils and I gave piano lessons. When my baby was\r\nborn I had to quit--but I thought we were out of the woods by then, for\r\nJim was made foreman of his gang and was raised to a hundred dollars a\r\nmonth. We moved from our boarding house into a flat. I hired a young\r\nSwedish girl and began to feel that I knew where I was.\r\n\r\n"But then the building workers struck. Jim had always been popular with\r\nhis men, and now he wanted his boss to give them half of what they asked\r\nfor. But his boss didn\'t see it that way at all, and he and Jim had\r\ntrouble. The next week Jim decided he wouldn\'t manage what he called\r\n\'scabs.\' So he left his employment, went in with the men and made the\r\nstrike a great success. That left him leader of their union. The salary\r\nthey paid him was eighty dollars instead of a hundred--so I let our\r\nSwedish girl go.\r\n\r\n"He said his new position would give him more time to study law. But it\r\ndidn\'t turn out quite that way. He got so wrapped up in his union\r\naffairs that he had no time for his law books. One day I put them up on\r\na shelf and found he didn\'t notice it."\r\n\r\nEleanore suddenly tightened at this, a quick sympathy came into her\r\neyes. Sue gave a restless little sigh.\r\n\r\n"He\'d be out at meetings most every night," Mrs. Marsh continued. "At\r\nthe end of the year he was one of three leaders in a strike of all the\r\nbuilding trades in town. All work of that kind in the city was stopped\r\nand things got very ugly. One night a man came to our flat and informed\r\nme that my husband was in jail. I went to the jail the next morning and\r\nsaw him. We had quite a talk. And that afternoon I gave up our flat."\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked Eleanore softly.\r\n\r\n"I presumed the landlord wished it," said Mrs. Marsh without looking\r\naround. "I took a room in a cheap hotel. Mr. Marsh came out of jail with\r\nideas that were all new to me. He had left his old trade union and gone\r\nin with a new crowd of men who stood for out-and-out revolution--which I\r\ncouldn\'t understand. But we made the best of it. We went to the theater\r\nthat night and then he took the midnight train on one of his first\r\nlabor trips. At first these trips were only for a week or so, but as\r\ntime went on they grew longer. As a rule I never wrote him because I\r\nnever knew his address. On one trip he was away five weeks--and before\r\nhe got back there was time enough for my second baby, a little boy, to\r\nbe born and die of pneumonia."\r\n\r\nEleanore flinched as though that had hurt. I saw her turn and look at\r\nSue, who seemed even more restless than before.\r\n\r\n"You decided to travel with him then--didn\'t you?" Eleanore murmured.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the other gruffly. "We used to try to figure out what city\r\nhe would likely be in, or at least not far away from--and then my little\r\ngirl and I would find a place to board there. It has been like that for\r\nthe past four years. In that time we\'ve lived in fourteen places all the\r\nway between here and the Coast."\r\n\r\n"Have you lived all the time at hotels?" Eleanore inquired.\r\n\r\n"We have," said the woman curtly, "but hardly the kind you\'re accustomed\r\nto. As a rule, as soon as we reach a town my husband\'s name appears in\r\nthe papers, and on that account the more refined houses wouldn\'t care to\r\nkeep us long."\r\n\r\nEleanore leaned forward, her eyes troubled and intent. She seemed to\r\nhave forgotten Sue.\r\n\r\n"How do you know they wouldn\'t?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I found out by trying--twice."\r\n\r\nI heard a sudden angry creak in the battered old chair in which Sue was\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\n"So my little girl Lucy and I," the embittered voice went on, "go to\r\nhotels that don\'t ask many questions. We pass the time going to parks or\r\nmuseums--or now and then to a concert--where I try to give her a taste\r\nfor good music."\r\n\r\n"Do you find time to keep up your music?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"There\'s time enough," came the quick reply. "You see as a rule I\'m just\r\nwaiting around. One night in Pittsburgh it was my birthday, and as the\r\nGrand Opera was there for a week and I had never been to one, I got Mr.\r\nMarsh to take me. We made it a regular celebration, with dinner in a\r\nfirst-class restaurant just for once. But my husband is generally\r\nwatched, and the papers all took it up the next day. \'Marsh and wife\r\ndine and see opera after his speech to starving strikers,\' or similar\r\nwords to that effect."\r\n\r\n"Do you see anything of the strikers?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Not much," she replied. "We used to be invited to go to parties at\r\ntheir homes. But most of them, even the leaders, were Irish, Germans,\r\nItalians or Jews whose wives could barely speak English. I found them\r\nnot very pleasant affairs. Some of the wives drank a good deal of beer\r\nand most of them had very little to say. Strike dances were no better.\r\nThe wives as a rule sat with their children around the walls--while a\r\nlot of young factory girls, Jewesses for the most part, danced turkey\r\ntrots around the hall."\r\n\r\n"There were speeches, I suppose?" Sue put in impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Yes--Mr. Marsh and others made speeches between dances. They weren\'t\r\nthe kind of affairs I\'d been used to in our home town," said Mrs. Marsh.\r\n"I\'ve lost track of the folks at home. I never write and they don\'t\r\nwrite me. Only once when my mother knew where I was she sent me a box at\r\nChristmas. Lucy and I got quite excited over that box, it was all the\r\npresents we\'d had from outside in quite a line of Christmases. So we\r\nthought we\'d celebrate."\r\n\r\n"How did you celebrate Christmas?" Eleanore asked softly.\r\n\r\n"We went out and bought a tree and candles, some gold balls and popcorn\r\nand all the other fixings. And we popped the corn over the gas that\r\nnight. The next day we bought things for each other\'s stockings. Lucy\r\nwas then only four years old, but I\'d leave her at a counter and tell\r\nthe clerk to let her have all she wanted to buy for me up to a dollar.\r\nThat was how we worked it. The next night we had the tree in our room. I\r\ngot Mr. Marsh to help me trim it. At last we lit the candles and let\r\nLucy in from the hotel hall, where she\'d nearly caught her death of\r\ncold. Then we opened the box from home. There was a doll for Lucy and a\r\nframed photograph of my mother for me--and for Mr. Marsh a Bible. He got\r\nlaughing over that and so did I. And that ended Christmas.\r\n\r\n"We had another Christmas last year," she said in a slow, intense sort\r\nof way as though seeing the place as she spoke, "in a mining town in\r\nMontana, where Jim had been in jail five days and the whole place was\r\nunder martial law. A major of the militia came to me on Christmas Eve.\r\nHe claimed that Jim had been seen by detectives traveling with another\r\nwoman and that I was not his wife. They locked me up for two hours that\r\nnight as an immoral woman."\r\n\r\nSue was sitting rigid now, her lips pressed tight. And Joe with a\r\nstrained unnatural face was staring into the fire.\r\n\r\n"But of course," Mrs. Marsh concluded, "most of the time it isn\'t like\r\nthat. As a rule when we come to a city nothing especial happens at all.\r\nWe just take a room like the one we have now and wait till the strike is\r\nover. I\'ve got so I have a queer view of towns. I\'m always there at the\r\ntime of a strike, when crowds of Italians and Poles and Jews fill the\r\nstreets on parade or jam into halls and talk about running the world by\r\nthemselves. And I guess they\'re going to do it some day--but I presume\r\nnot by to-morrow."\r\n\r\nFor some time while she was speaking her eyes had been fixed steadily\r\nupon Joe\'s only picture. It stood on the mantel, a big charcoal sketch\r\nof a crowd of immigrants just leaving Ellis Island. They were of all\r\nraces. Uncouth, heavy, stolid, with that hungry hope in all their eyes\r\nfor more of the good things of the earth, they seemed like some barbaric\r\nhorde about to pour in over the land. With her eyes upon their faces in\r\ndeep, quiet hatred this woman from the Middle West had told the story of\r\nher life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Well, Sally," said her husband, who had grown restive toward the end,\r\n"I guess that\'ll do. Let\'s go on home."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I\'m ready," she quickly replied. Now that she had come out of\r\nherself she seemed angry at having told so much.\r\n\r\nWhen they had left there was a silence, which Sue broke with a breath of\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n"What a frightful thing it must be for a man in this work," she\r\nexclaimed, "to have a wife like that! A woman so hard and narrow, so\r\nwrapped up in her own little life, with not a spark of sympathy for any\r\nof his big ideals!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose it\'s the life that has done it," said Eleanore quietly,\r\nlooking at Sue.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to see some women," Sue retorted angrily, "who have been in\r\nthat life for years and years, and _have_ sympathy, have _everything_,\r\ndon\'t care for anything else in the world!" She turned suddenly to Joe.\r\n"You said there were hundreds, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\nJoe looked back at her a moment. There was a startled, groping,\r\nsearching expression in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said. "There are hundreds."\r\n\r\n"Are many of them married?" Eleanore inquired.\r\n\r\n"Some of them are," he answered.\r\n\r\n"When a woman who, as Sue has just said, throws herself into this heart\r\nand soul, marries a man who is in it, too, how much of their time can\r\nthey spend together?"\r\n\r\n"That depends on the kind of work," he said. Eleanore held his eyes with\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n"In some cases, I suppose," she went on, "like yours, for example, where\r\nthe man\'s work keeps him moving--if the woman\'s work wouldn\'t let her\r\ngo with him they would have to be half their time apart."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"As Mrs. Marsh and her husband were at the time when her second baby was\r\nborn."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Joe, still watching her.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t there a good many, too, who don\'t exactly marry--but marry just\r\na little--one woman here, another there, and so on?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Joe, "there are some who do that."\r\n\r\n"I should think," said Eleanore thoughtfully, "that in a movement of\r\nthis kind a man ought not to marry at all--or else marry a little a good\r\nmany times--so as always to be free for the Cause."\r\n\r\n"Unless," said Joe, quite steadily, "he finds a woman like some I\'ve\r\nknown, whose feeling for a man, one man, seems to be planted in her for\r\nlife--who can easily stand not being with him because she herself is\r\ndeep in her own job, and her job is about the same as his--and because\r\nthe two of them have decided to see the whole job through to the end."\r\n\r\nHis eyes went up to the charcoal sketch.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a job worth seeing through," he said.\r\n\r\nSue was leaning forward now.\r\n\r\n"Where did you get that picture, Joe?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"It was an illustration," he said, "for a thing I once had in a\r\nmagazine." And then as though almost forgetting us all, his eyes still\r\nupon those immigrant faces, he said with a slow, rough intensity:\r\n\r\n"I know every figure in it. I know just where they\'re strong and where\r\neach one of \'em is weak. I\'ve never made gods out of \'em. But I know\r\nthey do all the real work in the world. They\'re the ones who get all the\r\nrotten deals, the ones who get shot down in wars and worked like dogs in\r\ntime of peace. They\'re the ones who are ready to go out on strike and\r\nrisk their lives to change all this. They\'re the people worth spending\r\nyour life with. But it\'s a job for your whole life--and before a man or\r\na woman jumps in they want to be sure they\'re ready."\r\n\r\nHe did not look at Sue as he spoke. He seemed barely able to hold\r\nhimself in. His relief was plain when we took her away.\r\n\r\nSue took a car to Brooklyn and we started homeward. Eleanore wanted to\r\nwalk for a while. She walked quickly, her face set.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of it?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t thinking of Sue," she said. "I was thinking of Mrs. Marsh.\r\nI\'ve never tormented a woman like that and I never will again in my\r\nlife--not for Sue or anyone else--she can marry anybody she likes!"\r\n\r\n"Well, she won\'t marry Joe," I said. "Did you see his face--poor devil?\r\nYou\'ve certainly settled that affair."\r\n\r\n"Have I?" she asked sharply. And then her curious feminine mind took a\r\nlong leap. "And what are _you_ going to be," she asked, "in a year from\r\nnow?" I smiled at her.\r\n\r\n"Not a second Marsh," I said. "But even if I were the man in the moon,\r\nyou\'d make a success of being my wife."\r\n\r\n"I think I would," said Eleanore. "It must be so quiet up there in the\r\nmoon."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n"Come over here at once." My father\'s voice over the telephone, one\r\nmorning a few days later, sounded thick and unnatural.\r\n\r\n"What about?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Your sister."\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the house in Brooklyn he came himself to let me in and\r\ntook me into the library. I was shocked by his face, it was terribly\r\nworn, quite plainly he had been up all night. As he began speaking his\r\nvoice shook and he leaned forward, every inch of him tense.\r\n\r\nSue had told him the night before that she was going to marry Joe\r\nKramer. In reply to his anxious questions she had given him some of the\r\nfacts about what Joe was doing. And Dad had stormed at her half the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n"She wants to marry him, Billy," he cried. "She\'s got her mind set on a\r\nman like that! What has he got to support her with? Not a cent, not even\r\na decent job! He\'s not writing now. Do you know what he\'s doing?\r\nStirring up strikes--of the ugliest kind--of the most ignorant class of\r\nmen--foreigners! I know such strikes--I\'ve fought \'em myself and I know\r\nhow they\'re handled! That young man will land in jail! And it\'s where he\r\nbelongs! Do you know what he\'s up to right here on the docks?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know----"\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you tell me? Why did you let him come to the house?"\r\n\r\n"I was doing my best to stop it, Dad."\r\n\r\n"You were, eh--well, you\'ll stop it now! Understand me, Billy, he\'s\r\nyour friend--you brought him here--way back at the start. You\'ve got to\r\nput a stop to this----"\r\n\r\n"But how?" I asked, trying to steady my voice. "What do you think that I\r\ncan do?"\r\n\r\n"You can talk to her, can\'t you? God Almighty! Make her see this will\r\nruin her life!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do that."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you?" He rose and bent over me gripping my arms, and I felt his\r\nviolent trembling. "If you don\'t, it\'s the end of me," he said.\r\n\r\n"Steady, Dad--now steady--this is coming out all right, you know----" I\r\ngot him back into his chair. "I\'m going to do all I possibly can. I\'m\r\ngoing to see Joe Kramer now--he\'s the only one who can influence her.\r\nI\'m going to get him to come to Sue and help me make her feel what\'s\r\nahead--the hardest, ugliest parts of his life. Now promise you\'ll keep\r\nout of it, promise you\'ll leave her alone while I\'m gone."\r\n\r\nHe agreed to this at last and I left him. But as I went into the hall\r\nSue came to me from the other room. Her face was white and strained.\r\n\r\n"Well, Billy?" she said. My throat tightened. She looked so pitifully\r\nworn.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Sue----"\r\n\r\n"Is that all you have to say to me?" she cut in with a quick catch of\r\nher breath.\r\n\r\n"No, no." I took her in my arms. "Dear old Sue--don\'t you know how I\r\nfeel? I want to see you happy. I\'m trying to see what on earth we can\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t you all leave me alone?" she demanded, in low broken tones.\r\n"That\'s all I want--I\'m old enough! I love him! Isn\'t that enough? To be\r\ntreated like this--like a bad little child! If you\'d been here and heard\r\nhim--Dad, I mean--I tell you he\'s half out of his mind! I\'m afraid to be\r\nleft alone with him!"\r\n\r\n"Sue?" It was our father\'s voice. He had come out close behind us.\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone!" Sue started back, but he caught her arm:\r\n\r\n"You\'ll stay right here with me till he comes."\r\n\r\n"Till who comes?"\r\n\r\n"Kramer."\r\n\r\n"Who said he was coming?"\r\n\r\n"Your brother."\r\n\r\n"Billy!"\r\n\r\n"Now, Sis, I\'m going to talk to Joe and try to persuade him to see you\r\nand me together, that\'s all--quietly--over in our apartment."\r\n\r\n"No," said our father. "He\'ll see her right here!"\r\n\r\n"Now, Dad----"\r\n\r\n"Careful, son, don\'t get in my way. I\'m standing about as much as I can.\r\nKramer is to come right here. If there\'s any seeing Sue to be done it\'s\r\nto be in her home, where she belongs. I won\'t let her out of it--not for\r\nan hour out of my sight!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll lock me in here?" she panted. He turned on her.\r\n\r\n"You can call the police if you want to." He let go his hold and turned\r\nto me. "I\'m thinking of her mother. If she sees this man at all again\r\nI\'ll see him too."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you leave us?" I implored her. "Sue--please! Go up to your room!"\r\n\r\nWhen she\'d gone I tried to quiet him. And now that Sue was out of the\r\nway I partly succeeded. But he stuck to his purpose. Joe must come and\r\nsee Sue here.\r\n\r\n"I want to be on hand when she sees him," he insisted. "I don\'t want to\r\ntalk--I\'ve done all that--I won\'t say a word--but I want to be here. You\r\nthink you know her better than I do because you\'re younger--but you\r\ndon\'t. We\'ve lived right here together--she\'s been my chum for\r\ntwenty-five years, and I know things about her you don\'t know. She\'s\r\nwilful, she\'s as wild as a hawk--but she can\'t hold out, she hasn\'t it\r\nin her."\r\n\r\n"She will if you act as you did just now----"\r\n\r\n"But I won\'t," he said sharply. "That was a mistake--and I won\'t let it\r\nhappen again. When he comes you do the talking, boy--and if we\'re beaten\r\nI won\'t try to keep her, she goes and it\'s ended, I promise you that.\r\nBut, son, don\'t make any mistake about this--I have an influence over\r\nthis girl that you haven\'t got and nobody has. I want her to feel me\r\nbeside her."\r\n\r\nHe went over this again and again, and with this I had to leave him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI found Joe in his office. He rose abruptly when I came in, and reached\r\nfor his hat.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go out for a walk," he said. Down in the street he turned on me:\r\n"Sue has just \'phoned me you were there. She thought you were going to\r\nhelp her, Bill, she thought that you\'d stand by her. She didn\'t get any\r\nsleep last night--she\'s been through hell with that father of hers----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve been all through Sue\'s sufferings, Joe. Don\'t give me any more\r\nof that."\r\n\r\n"You mean you think she\'s faking?"\r\n\r\n"No. But to be good and brutally frank about it, what she suffers just\r\nnow doesn\'t count with me. It\'s what her whole life may be with you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not exactly your business, is it?"\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t be if I didn\'t know Sue."\r\n\r\n"What do you know?"\r\n\r\n"I know that in spite of all her talk and the way she acts and honestly\r\nfeels whenever she\'s with you," I replied, "Sue wants to hang on to her\r\nhome and us. She isn\'t the heroic kind. She can\'t just follow along with\r\nyou and leave all this she\'s used to."\r\n\r\nJoe\'s face clouded a little.\r\n\r\n"She\'ll get over that," he muttered.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she will and perhaps she won\'t. How do you know? You want to\r\nknow, don\'t you? You want her to be happy?"\r\n\r\n"No, that\'s not what I want most. Being happy isn\'t the only thing----"\r\n\r\n"Then tell her so. That\'s all I ask. I\'ll tell you what I\'ve come for,\r\nJoe. You\'ve always been more honest, more painfully blunt and open than\r\nany man I\'ve ever known. Be that way now with Sue. Give her the\r\nplainest, hardest picture you can of the life you\'re getting her into."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve tried to do that already."\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t! If you want to know what you\'ve done I can tell you.\r\nYou\'ve painted up this life of yours--and all these things you believe\r\nin--with power enough and smash enough to knock holes through all I\r\nbelieve in myself. And I\'m stronger than Sue--you\'ve done more to her.\r\nWhat I ask of you now is to drop all the fire and punch of your dreams,\r\nand line out the cold facts of your life on its personal side--what it\'s\r\ngoing to be. I\'ll help draw it out by asking you questions."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of that? I know it won\'t change her!"\r\n\r\n"Maybe it won\'t. But if it won\'t, at least it\'ll make my father give up.\r\nCan\'t you see? If you and I together--I asking and you answering--paint\r\nyour life the way it\'s to be, and she says, \'Good, that\'s what I\r\nwant\'--he\'ll feel she\'s so far away from him then that he\'ll throw up\r\nhis hands and let her go. He can rest then, we can help him\r\nthen--Eleanore and I can--it may save the last years of his life. And\r\nSue will be free to come to you."\r\n\r\n"You mean the more ugly we make it the better."\r\n\r\n"Just that. Let\'s end this one way or the other."\r\n\r\n"All right. I agree to that."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Joe and I came into the library my father rose slowly from his\r\nchair and the two stood looking at one another. And by some curious\r\nmental process two memories flashed into my mind. One was of the\r\ntowering sails that my father had told me he had seen on his first day\r\non the harbor, when coming here a crude boy from the inland he had\r\nthrilled to the vision of owning such ships with crews to whom his word\r\nshould be law, and of sending them over the ocean world. Such was the\r\nage he had lived in. The other was of the stokers down in the bottom of\r\nthe ship, and Joe\'s tired frowning face as he said, "Yes, they look like\r\na lot of bums--and they feed all the fires at sea." What was there in\r\ncommon between these two? To each age a harbor of its own.\r\n\r\n"Well, young man, what have you to say to me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing."\r\n\r\nSue came into the room. Briefly I explained to her what our father had\r\nagreed upon, that she was to do the deciding and that he would abide by\r\nher decision. Then I began my questions to Joe. I felt awkward,\r\npainfully the intruder into two other people\'s lives. And I felt as\r\nthough I were operating upon the silent old man close by. "The uglier\r\nthe better," I kept repeating to myself.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s take up first the money side, Joe. Have you any regular salary?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Such as it is, where does it come from?"\r\n\r\n"Out of the stokers."\r\n\r\n"How much do you get?"\r\n\r\n"One week twenty dollars and another ten or five," he said. "One week I\r\ngot three dollars and eighty-seven cents."\r\n\r\n"Is that likely to grow steadier?"\r\n\r\n"Possibly--more likely worse."\r\n\r\n"But can two of you live on pay like that--say an average of ten dollars\r\na week?"\r\n\r\n"I know several millions of people that have to. And most of them have\r\nchildren too."\r\n\r\n"And you\'d expect to live like that?"\r\n\r\n"No better," was his answer. My father turned to him slowly as though he\r\nhad not heard just right.\r\n\r\n"But as a matter of fact," I went on, "you wouldn\'t have to, would you?\r\nYou\'d expect Sue to earn money as well as yourself."\r\n\r\n"I hope so--if she wants to--it\'s my idea of a woman\'s life."\r\n\r\n"And the work you hope she\'ll enter will be the kind you believe\r\nin--organizing labor and taking an active part in strikes?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. She\'s a good speaker----"\r\n\r\n"I see. And if you were out of a job at times you\'d be willing to let\r\nher support you?"\r\n\r\nSue angrily half rose from her chair, but Joe with a grim move of his\r\nhand said softly, "Sit down and try to stand this. Let\'s get it over and\r\ndone with." Then he turned quietly back to me.\r\n\r\n"Why yes--I\'d let her support me," he said.\r\n\r\n"You mean you don\'t care one way or the other. You\'d both be working for\r\nwhat you believe in, and how you lived wouldn\'t especially count?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s about it."\r\n\r\n"What do you believe in, Joe? Just briefly, what\'s your main idea in\r\nstirring up millions of ignorant men?"\r\n\r\n"Mainly to pull down what\'s on top."\r\n\r\n"As for instance?"\r\n\r\n"All of it. Business, industry and finance as it\'s being run at\r\npresent."\r\n\r\n"A clean sweep. And in place of that?"\r\n\r\n"Everything run by the workers themselves."\r\n\r\n"For example?" I asked. "The ships by the stokers?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the ships by the stokers," he said. And I felt Dad stiffen in his\r\nchair. "As they will be when the time comes," Joe added.\r\n\r\n"How soon will that be?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see it," he said.\r\n\r\n"The working people in full control. No restraints whatever from above."\r\n\r\n"There won\'t be anyone left above. No more gods," he answered.\r\n\r\n"Not even one?"\r\n\r\n"Is there one?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"You\'re an atheist, aren\'t you," I said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, when I happen to think of it."\r\n\r\n"And Sue would likely be the same."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t she now?" he inquired. I dropped the point and hurried on.\r\n\r\n"How about Sue\'s friends, Joe? In a life like that--always in\r\nstrikes--she\'d have to give them up, wouldn\'t she?"\r\n\r\n"Probably. Some of \'em think they\'re radicals, but I doubt if they\'d\r\ncome far out of the parlor."\r\n\r\n"So her new friends would be either strikers or the people who lead in\r\nstrikes. Her life would be practically sunk in the mass."\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"You may be in jail at times."\r\n\r\n"Quite probably."\r\n\r\n"Sue too?"\r\n\r\n"Possibly."\r\n\r\nI caught the look in my father\'s face and knew that I had but a few\r\nmoments more.\r\n\r\n"Do you want to marry her, Joe?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll go down to City Hall--if a large fat Tammany alderman can\r\nmake our love any cleaner."\r\n\r\n"You mean you don\'t believe in marriage."\r\n\r\n"Not especially," he said.\r\n\r\n"And so if either gets sick of the other he just leaves without any\r\nfuss."\r\n\r\n"Naturally."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. And then Joe spoke again.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a better interviewer than I thought you were," he said. "You\'ve\r\nmade the picture quite complete--as far as you can see it. Of course\r\nyou\'ve left all the real stuff out----"\r\n\r\n"What is the real stuff, as you call it, young man?" My father\'s voice\r\nhad a deadly ring. Joe turned and looked at him as before.\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t understand," he said.\r\n\r\n"I think I understand enough." Dad rose abruptly and turned to Sue.\r\n"Sue," he said. "Shall I ask your anarchist friend to go?"\r\n\r\nI could feel Sue gather herself. She was white.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have to go with him," she managed to say. A slight spasm shot over\r\nour father\'s face. For a moment there was silence.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve heard all he said of this life of his?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And what he wants and expects you to do?"\r\n\r\n"I heard it."\r\n\r\n"And just how he wants you to live--with nothing you\'ve been used\r\nto--nothing? No money but what a few drunken stokers throw your way, no\r\ndecent ideals, no religion, no home?"\r\n\r\nAgain a pause.\r\n\r\n"I want to go with him," she brought out at last.\r\n\r\nDad turned sharply and left the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI heard a deep breath behind me. It came from Joe Kramer, whose face was\r\nset in a frown of pain.\r\n\r\n"He\'s so damn old," Joe muttered. "You operated on him hard."\r\n\r\nSuddenly Sue threw herself on the lounge. She huddled there shaking and\r\nmotioned us off.\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone, can\'t you, go away!" we heard between her sobs. "It\'s\r\nall right--I\'m ready--I\'ll come to you, Joe--but not now--not just now!\r\nGo away, both of you--leave me alone!"\r\n\r\nJoe left the house. Soon after that Eleanore arrived and I told her what\r\nhad happened. She went in to Sue, I left them together and went up to\r\nmy father\'s room. He lay on the bed breathing quickly.\r\n\r\n"You did splendidly, son," he said. "You slashed into her hard. It hurt\r\nme to listen--but it\'s all right. Let her suffer--she had to. It hit\r\nher, I tell you--she\'ll break down! If we can only keep her here! Get\r\nEleanore!"\r\n\r\nHe stopped with a jerk, his hand went to his heart, and he panted and\r\nscowled with pain.\r\n\r\n"I sent for her," I told him. "She\'s come and she\'s in Sue\'s room now.\r\nLet\'s leave them alone. It\'s going to be all right, Dad."\r\n\r\nI sent for a doctor who was an old friend of my father\'s. He came and\r\nspent a long time in the room, and I could hear them talking. At last he\r\ncame out.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t do," he said. "We can\'t have any more of this. We must keep\r\nyour sister out of his sight. She can\'t stay alone with him in this\r\nhouse, and she can\'t go now to your anarchist friend. If she does it may\r\nbe the end of your father. Suppose you persuade her to come to you."\r\n\r\nBut here Eleanore joined us.\r\n\r\n"I have a better plan," she said. "I\'ve been talking to Sue and she has\r\nagreed. She\'s to stay--and we\'ll move over here and try to keep Sue and\r\nher father apart."\r\n\r\n"What about Joe?" I asked her.\r\n\r\n"Sue has promised me not to see Joe until the strike is over. It will\r\nonly be a matter of weeks--perhaps even days--it may break out\r\nto-morrow. It\'s not much of a time for Joe to get married--besides, it\'s\r\nthe least she can do for her father--to wait that long. And she has\r\nagreed. So that much is settled."\r\n\r\nShe went home to pack up a few things for the night. When she came back\r\nit was evening. She spent some time with Sue in her room, while I stayed\r\nin with father. I gave him a powder the doctor had left and he was soon\r\nsleeping heavily.\r\n\r\nAt last in my old bedroom Eleanore and I were alone. It was a long time\r\nbefore we could sleep.\r\n\r\n"Funny," said Eleanore presently, "how thoroughly selfish people can be.\r\nHere\'s Sue and your father going through a perfectly ghastly crisis. But\r\nI haven\'t been thinking of them--not at all. I\'ve been thinking of\r\nus--of you, I mean--of what this strike will do to you. You\'re getting\r\nso terribly tense these days."\r\n\r\nI reached over and took her hand:\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want me to run away from it now?"\r\n\r\n"No," she said quickly. "I don\'t want that. I\'ve told you that I\'m not\r\nafraid----"\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll have to wait and see, won\'t we, dear? We can\'t help\r\nourselves now. I\'ve got to keep on writing, you know--we depend on that\r\nfor our living. And I can\'t write what I did before--I don\'t seem to\r\nhave it in me. So I\'m going into this strike as hard as I can--I\'m going\r\nto watch it as hard as I can and think it out as clearly. I know I\'ll\r\nnever be like Joe--but I do feel now I\'m going to change. I\'ve got\r\nto--after what I\'ve been shown. The harbor is so different now. Don\'t\r\nyou understand?"\r\n\r\nI felt her hand slowly tighten on mine.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear," she said, "I understand----"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe events of that day dropped out of my mind in the turbulent weeks\r\nthat followed. For day by day I felt myself sink deeper and deeper into\r\nthe crowd, into surging multitudes of men--till something that I found\r\ndown there lifted me up and swept me on--into a strange new harbor.\r\n\r\nOf the strike I can give only one man\'s view, what I could see with my\r\none pair of eyes in that swiftly spreading confusion that soon embraced\r\nthe whole port of New York and other ports both here and abroad. War\r\ncorrespondents, I suppose, must feel the same chaos around them, but in\r\nmy case it rose from within me as well. I was like a war correspondent\r\nwho is trying to make up his mind about war. What was good in this labor\r\nrebellion? What was bad? Where was it taking me?\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning I could feel that it meant for me a breaking of ties\r\nwith the safe strong world that had been my life. I felt this first\r\nbefore the strike, when I went to my magazine editor. He had taken my\r\nstory about Jim Marsh, but when I came to him now and told him that I\r\nwanted to cover the strike,\r\n\r\n"Go ahead if you like," he answered, a weary indulgence in his tone, "I\r\ndon\'t want to interfere in your work. But I can\'t promise you now that\r\nwe\'ll buy it. If you feel you must write up this strike you\'ll have to\r\ndo it at your own risk."\r\n\r\n"Why?" I asked. For years my work had been ordered ahead. I thought of\r\nthat small apartment of ours, of my father sick at home--and I felt\r\nmyself suddenly insecure.\r\n\r\n"Because," he answered coolly, "I\'m not quite sure that what you write\r\nwill be a fair unbiassed presentation of the facts. I\'ve seen so many\r\ngood reporters utterly spoiled in strikes like this. They lose their\r\nwhole sense of proportion and never seem to get it quite back."\r\n\r\nThis little talk left me deeply disturbed. But I was unwilling to give\r\nup my plan, and so, after some anxious thinking, I decided to free-lance\r\nit. After all, if this one story didn\'t sell I could borrow until I\r\nwrote something that did. And I set to work with an angry vim. The very\r\nthought that my old world was closing up behind me made my mind the more\r\nready now for the new world opening ahead.\r\n\r\nFrom the old house in Brooklyn I once more explored my harbor. All day\r\nand the greater part of each night I went back over my old ground. Old\r\nmemories rose in sharp contrast to new views I was getting. From the top\r\nI had come to the bottom. Crowds of sweating laborers rose everywhere\r\nbetween me and my past. And as between me and my past, and between these\r\nmasses and their rulers, I felt the struggle drawing near, the whole\r\nimmense region took on for me the aspect of a battlefield, with puffs\r\nand clouds and darting lines of smoke and steam from its ships and\r\ntrains and factories. Through it I moved confusedly, troubled and\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\nI saw the work of the harbor go now with an even mightier rush, because\r\nof the impending strike. The rumor of its coming had spread far over the\r\ncountry, and shippers were hurrying cargoes in. I saw boxes and barrels\r\nby thousands marked "Rush." And they were rushed! On one dock I saw the\r\ndockers begin at seven in the morning and when I came back late in the\r\nevening the same men were there. At midnight I went home to sleep. When\r\nI came back at daybreak the same men were there, and I watched them\r\nstraining through the last rush until the ship sailed that day at noon.\r\nThey had worked for twenty-nine hours. In that last hour I drew\r\nclose--so close that I could feel them heaving, sweating, panting, feel\r\ntheir laboring hearts and lungs. Long ago I had watched them thus, but\r\nthen I had seen from a different world. I had felt the pulse of a nation\r\nbeating and I had gloried in its speed. But now I felt the pulse-beats\r\nof exhausted straining men, I saw that undertaker\'s sign staring fixedly\r\nfrom across the way. "_Certainly_ I\'m talking to you!" Six thousand\r\nkilled and injured!\r\n\r\nI saw accidents that week. I saw a Polish docker knocked on the head by\r\nthe end of a heavy chain that broke. I saw a little Italian caught by\r\nthe foot in a rope net, swung yelling with terror into the air, then\r\ndropped--his leg was broken. And toward the end of a long night\'s work I\r\nsaw a tired man slip and fall with a huge bag on his shoulders. The bag\r\ncame down on top of him, and he lay there white and still. Later I\r\nlearned that his spine had been broken, that he would be paralyzed for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut what I saw was only a part. From the policemen\'s books alone I found\r\na record for that week of six dockers killed and eighty-seven injured. I\r\ntraced about a score of these cases back into their tenement homes, and\r\nthere I found haggard, crippled men and silent, anxious women, the\r\nmothers of small children. Curious and deeply thrilled, these children\r\nlooked at the man on the bed, between his groans of pain I heard their\r\neager questions, they kept getting in their mother\'s way. One thin\r\nItalian mother, whose nerves were plainly all on edge, suddenly slapped\r\nthe child at her skirts, and then when it began to cry she herself burst\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\nThese tragic people gripped me hard. The stokers down in their foul hole\r\nin the bottom of the ship had only disturbed and repelled me. But these\r\ncrippled dockers in their homes, with their women and their children,\r\ntheir shattered lives, their agony, starvation looming up ahead--they\r\nbrought a tightening at my throat--nor was it all of pity. For these\r\nlabor victims were not dumb, I heard the word "strike!" spoken bitterly\r\nhere, and now I felt that they had a right to this bitter passion of\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\nBut still I felt their way was wrong. How could any real good, any sure\r\nintelligent remedies for all this fearful misery, come out of the minds\r\nof such people as these, who were rushing so blindly into revolt? I went\r\ninto saloons full of dockers and stokers, and out of the low harsh\r\nhubbub there the word "strike!" came repeatedly to my ears, recklessly\r\nfrom drunken tongues. Wherever I went I heard that word. I heard it\r\nspoken in many languages, in many tones. Anxious old women said\r\n"strike!" with fear. Little street urchins shouted it joyously. Even the\r\ngreenest foreigner understood its meaning. A little Greek, who had\r\nbroken his arm and was one of the cases I traced home, understood none\r\nof my questions. "You speak no English?" He shook his head. "Strike!" I\r\nventured. Up he leaped. "Yo\' bet!" he cried emphatically.\r\n\r\nWhat was it deep within me that leaped up then as though to meet that\r\nburning passion in his eyes?\r\n\r\n"Keep your head," I warned myself. "To change all this means years of\r\nwork--thinking of the clearest kind. And what clear thinking can these\r\nmen do? The ships have got them down so low they\'ve no minds left to get\r\nout of their holes!"\r\n\r\nAnd yet--as now on every dock, that "strike feeling" in the air kept\r\ngrowing tenser, tenser--its tensity crept into me. What was it that lay\r\njust ahead? I felt like a man starting out on a journey--a journey from\r\nwhich when he comes back he will find nothing quite the same.\r\n\r\nI had a talk about the strike one day with Eleanore\'s father. I can\r\nstill see the affectionate smile on his face, he looked as though he\r\nwere seeing me off.\r\n\r\n"My dear boy," he said, in his kind quiet voice, "don\'t forget for even\r\na minute that the men who stand behind my work are going to stamp out\r\nthis strike. This modern world is too complex to allow brute force and\r\nviolence to wreck all that civilization has done. I\'m sorry you\'ve gone\r\ninto this--but so long as you have, as Eleanore\'s father, I want you now\r\nto promise you won\'t write a line until the strike is over and you have\r\nhad plenty of time to get clear. Don\'t let yourself get swamped in\r\nthis--remember that you have a wife and a small son to think of."\r\n\r\nMy father had put it more sharply. He was out of bed now and he seemed\r\nto take strength from the news reports that he eagerly read of the\r\nstruggle so fast approaching.\r\n\r\n"At sea," he said, "when stokers try to quit their jobs and force their\r\nway on deck, they\'re either put in irons or shot down as mutineers.\r\nYou\'ll see your friend Kramer dead or in jail. No danger to your sister\r\nnow. Only see that _you_ keep out of it!"\r\n\r\nI did not tell him of my work, for I knew it would only excite him\r\nagain, and excitement would be dangerous.\r\n\r\n"Now you and Eleanore must go home," said Sue that night. "You\'ll have\r\nenough to think of. I\'ll be all right with father--he knows there\'s\r\nnothing to do but wait, and he\'s so kind to me now that it hurts. Poor\r\nold Dad--how well he means. But he\'s the old and we\'re the new--and\r\nthat\'s the whole trouble between us." A sudden light came in her eyes.\r\n"The new are bound to win!" she said.\r\n\r\nBut I was not so sure of the new. To me it was still very vague and\r\nchaotic. After we had moved back to New York, at the times when I came\r\nhome to sleep, Eleanore was silent or quietly casual in her remarks, but\r\nI felt her always watching me. One night when I came in very late and\r\nthought her asleep, being too tired to sleep myself, I went to our\r\nbedroom window and stood looking off down, into the distant expanse of\r\nthe harbor. How quiet and cool it seemed down there. But presently out\r\nof the darkness behind, Eleanore\'s arm came around me.\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether the harbor will ever let us alone," she said. "It was\r\nso good to us at first--we were getting on so splendidly. But it\'s\r\ntaking hold of us now again--as though we had wandered too far away and\r\nwere living too smoothly and needed a jolt. Never mind, we\'re not\r\nafraid. Only let\'s be very sure we know what we are doing."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be very sure," I whispered, and I held her very close.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s try to be sure together," she said. "Don\'t leave me out--I want\r\nto be in. I want to see as much as I can--and help in any way I can. If\r\nyou make any friends I want to know them. Remember that whatever comes,\r\nthy people shall be mine, my dear."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day the strike began.\r\n\r\nOut of the docks at nine in the morning I saw dockers pour in crowds.\r\nThey moved on to other docks, merged themselves in other crowds,\r\nscattered here and gathered there, until at last a black tide of men,\r\nhere straggling wide, here densely massed, moved slowly along the\r\nwaterfront.\r\n\r\nIn and out of these surging throngs I moved, so close that in the quiver\r\nof muscles, the excited movements of big limbs, the rough eagerness of\r\nvoices that spoke in a babel of many tongues, such a storm of emotions\r\nbeat in upon me that I felt I had suddenly dived into an ocean of human\r\nbeings, each one of whom was as human as I. I caught a glimpse of Joe\r\nhurrying by. And I thought of Sue, and of Joe\'s appeal to her and to me\r\nto throw in our lives with such strangers as these whose coarse heavy\r\nfaces were pressing so close. And I thought of Eleanore at home. "Thy\r\npeople shall be mine, my dear."\r\n\r\nTeamsters drove clattering trucks through the crowds. Some of them did\r\nnot unload, but others dumped piles of freight by the docks. The dam had\r\nbegun. All day long the freight piled up, and by evening the light of a\r\npale moon shone down upon acres of barrels and boxes. Then the teamsters\r\nunharnessed their teams, left the empty trucks with poles in air, and\r\nthe teamsters and their horses and all the crowds of strikers scattered\r\nby degrees up into the tenement regions. Bursts of laughter and singing\r\ncame now and then out of the saloons.\r\n\r\nSilence settled down over the docks. Walking now down the waterfront I\r\nmet only a figure here and there. A taxi came tearing and screeching by,\r\nand later down the long empty space came a single wagon slowly. A smoky\r\nlantern swung under its wheels, and its old white horse with his shaggy\r\nhead down came plodding wearily along. He alone had no strike feeling.\r\n\r\nBattered and worn from the day\'s impressions I wanted to be alone and to\r\nthink. I made my way in and out among trucks and around a dockshed out\r\nto a slip. It was filled with barges, tugs and floats jammed in between\r\nthe two big vessels that loomed one at either pier. It was a dark jumble\r\nof spars and masts, derricks, funnels and cabin roofs, all shadowy and\r\nsilent. A single light gleamed here and there from the long dark deck of\r\nthe Morgan coaster close to my right. She was heavily loaded still, for\r\nshe had come to dock too late. Smoke still drifted from her stout\r\nfunnel, steam puffed now and then from her side. Behind her, reaching a\r\nmile to the North, were ships by the dozen, coasters and great ocean\r\nliners, loaded and waiting to discharge or empty and waiting to reload.\r\nAnd to the South were miles of railroad sheds already packed to\r\nbursting. I thought of the trains from all over the land still rushing a\r\nnation\'s produce here, and of the starlit ocean roads, of ships coming\r\nfrom all over the world, the men in their fiery caverns below feeding\r\nfaster the fires to quicken their speed, all bringing cargoes to this\r\nport. More barrels, boxes, crates and bags to be piled high up on the\r\nwaterfront. For the workers had gone away from their work, and the great\r\nwhite ships were still.\r\n\r\n"What has all this to do with me?"\r\n\r\nThere came into my mind the picture of a little man I had seen that day,\r\na suburban commuter by his looks, frowning from a ferryboat upon a\r\ncheering crowd of strikers. I laughed to myself as I thought of him. He\r\nhad seemed so ludicrously small.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my friend," I thought, "you and I are a couple of two-spots here,\r\nswallowed up in the scenery."\r\n\r\nI thought of what Joe had said that day: "When you see the crowd, in a\r\nstrike like this, loosen up and show all it could be if it had the\r\nchance--that sight is so big it blots you out--you sink--you melt into\r\nthe crowd."\r\n\r\nSomething like that happened to me. I had seen the multitudes "loosen\r\nup," I had felt myself melt into the crowd. But I had not seen what they\r\ncould be nor did I see what they could do. Far to the south, high over\r\nall the squalid tenement dwellings, rose that tower of lights I had\r\nknown so well, the airy place where Eleanore\'s father had dreamed and\r\nplanned his clean vigorous world. It was lighted to-night as usual, as\r\nthough nothing whatever had happened. I thought of the men I had seen\r\nthat day. How crassly ignorant they seemed. And yet in a few brief hours\r\nthey had paralyzed all that the tower had planned, reduced it all to\r\nsilence, nothing. Could it be that such upheavals as these meant an end\r\nto the rule of the world from above, by the keen minds of the men at the\r\ntop? Was that great idol which had been mine for so many glad years,\r\nthat last of my gods, Efficiency, beginning to rock a little now upon\r\nits deep foundations?\r\n\r\nWhat could these men ever put in its place? I recalled the words of an\r\nold dock watchman with whom I had talked the evening before. From the\r\ndays of the Knights of Labor he had been through many strikes, and all\r\nhad failed, he told me. His dog sat there beside him, a solemn old red\r\nspaniel, looking wistfully into his master\'s face. And with somewhat the\r\nsame expression, looking out on the moonlit Hudson, the old striker had\r\nsaid slowly:\r\n\r\n"Before these labor leaders will do half of what they say--a pile of\r\nwater will have to go by."\r\n\r\nA sharp slight sound behind me jerked me suddenly out of my thoughts. I\r\njumped as though at a shot. How infernally tight my nerves were getting.\r\nThe sound had come from a mere piece of paper blown by the wind--a rough\r\nsalt wind which now blew in from the ocean as though impatient of all\r\nthis stillness. From below came a lapping and slapping of waves. Above\r\nme a derrick mast growled and whined as it rocked. And now as I looked\r\nabout me all those densely crowded derricks moved to and fro against the\r\nsky. I had never felt in this watery world such deep restlessness as\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if you\'ll ever stop heaving," I thought half angrily. "I\r\nwonder what I\'ll be like when you finally get through with me. When will\r\nyou ever let me stand pat and get things settled for good and all? When\r\nstop this endless starting out?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat could such men as these raise up in place of the mighty life they\r\nhad stilled?\r\n\r\nAt first only chaos.\r\n\r\nAs I went along the waterfront I felt a confused disappointment. Deep\r\nunder all my questioning there had been a vague subconscious hope that I\r\nwould see a miracle here. I had looked for an army. I saw only mobs of\r\nangry men. They were "picketing" the docks, here making furious rushes\r\nat men suspected of being "scabs," there clustering quickly around some\r\ntalker or some man who was reading a paper, again drifting up into the\r\nstreets of teeming foreign quarters, jamming into barrooms, voicing\r\nwildest rumors, talking, shouting, pounding tables with huge fists. And\r\nto me there was nothing inspiring but only something terrible here, an\r\nappalling force turned loose, sightless and unguided. What a fool I had\r\nbeen to hope. The harbor held no miracles.\r\n\r\nThe strike leaders seemed to have little control. Headquarters were in\r\nthe wildest disorder. Into the big bare meeting hall and through the\r\nrooms adjoining drifted multitudes of men. There were no inner private\r\nrooms and Marsh saw everyone who came. He was constantly shaking hands\r\nor drawling casual orders, more like suggestions than commands. I caught\r\nsight of Joe Kramer\'s face at his desk, where he was signing and giving\r\nout union cards to a changing throng that kept pressing around him.\r\nJoe\'s face was set and haggard. He had been at that desk all night.\r\n\r\n"It\'s hopeless. They can do nothing," I thought.\r\n\r\nBut when I came back the next morning I felt a sudden shock of\r\nsurprise. For in some mysterious fashion a crude order had appeared. The\r\nstriker throng had poured into the hall, filled all the seats and then\r\nwedged in around the walls. They were silent and attentive now. On the\r\nstage sat Marsh and his fellow leaders. Before them in the first three\r\nrows of seats was the Central Committee, a rough parliament sprung up\r\nover night. Each member, I found, had been elected the night before by\r\nhis "district committee." These district bodies had somehow formed in\r\nthe last two days and in them leaders had arisen. The leaders were here\r\nto plan together, the mass was here to make sure they planned right. And\r\nwatching the deep rough eagerness on all those silent faces, that vague\r\nhope stirred again in my breast.\r\n\r\nPresently I caught Joe\'s eye. At once he left his platform seat and came\r\nto me in the rear of the hall.\r\n\r\n"Come on, Bill," he said. "We want you up here." And we made our way up\r\nto the platform. There Marsh reached over and gripped my hand.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Bill, glad you\'re with us," he said. I tingled slightly at his\r\ntone and at a thousand friendly eyes that met mine for an instant. Then\r\nit was over. The work went on.\r\n\r\nWhat they did at first seemed haphazard enough. Reports from the\r\ndistricts were being read with frequent interruptions, petty corrections\r\nand useless discussions that strayed from the point and made me\r\nimpatient. And yet wide vistas opened here. Telegrams by the dozen were\r\nread from labor unions all over the country, from groups of socialists\r\nEast and West, there were cables from England, Germany, France, from\r\nRussia, Poland, Norway, from Italy, Spain and even Japan. "Greetings to\r\nour comrades!" came pouring in from all over the earth. What measureless\r\narmy of labor was this? All at once the dense mass in the rear would\r\npart to let a new body of men march through. These were new strikers to\r\nswell the ranks, and at their coming all business would stop, there\r\nwould be wild cheers and stamping of feet, shrill whistles, pandemonium!\r\n\r\nGradually I began to feel what was happening in this hall. That first\r\n"strike feeling"--diffused, shifting and uncertain--was condensing as in\r\na storm cloud here, swelling, thickening, whirling, attracting swiftly\r\nto itself all these floating forces. Here was the first awakening of\r\nthat mass thought and passion, which swelling later into full life was\r\nto give me such flashes of insight into the deep buried resources of the\r\ncommon herd of mankind, their resources and their power of vision when\r\nthey are joined and fused in a mass. Here in a few hours the great\r\nspirit of the crowd was born.\r\n\r\nFor now the crowd began to question, think and plan. Ideas were thrown\r\nout pell mell. I found that every plan of action, everything felt and\r\nthought and spoken, though it might start from a single man, was at once\r\ntransformed by the feeling of all, expressed in fragments of speech, in\r\napplause, or in loud bursts of laughter, or again by a chilling silence\r\nin which an unwelcome thought soon died. The crowd spoke its will\r\nthrough many voices, through men who sprang up and talked hard a few\r\nmoments, then sat down and were lost to sight--some to rise later again\r\nand again and grow in force of thought and expression, others not to be\r\nseen again, they had simply been parts of the crowd, and the crowd had\r\nmade them rise and speak.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of this labor parliament, up rose a stolid Pole. He was\r\nno committeeman but simply a member of the throng.\r\n\r\n"Yo\' sand a spickair to my dock," he said. "Pier feefty-two--East\r\nReever. I t\'ink he make de boys come out." He sat down breathing\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t need any speaker, go yourself," an Irishman called from\r\nacross the hall.\r\n\r\n"I no spick," said the Pole emphatically.\r\n\r\n"You\'re spicking now, ain\'t you?" There was a burst of laughter, and\r\nthe big man\'s face grew red. "You don\'t need to talk," the voice went\r\non. "Just go into your dock and yell \'Strike!\' You\'ve got chest enough,\r\nyou Pollock."\r\n\r\nThe big Pole made his way out of the hall. In the rear I saw him light\r\nhis pipe and puff and scowl in a puzzled way. Then he disappeared. The\r\nnext day, in the midst of some discussion, he rose from another part of\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\n"I want to say I strike my dock," he shouted. Nobody seemed to hear him,\r\nit had nothing whatever to do with the subject, but he sat down with a\r\nglow of pride.\r\n\r\nA Norwegian had arisen and was speaking earnestly, but his English was\r\nso wonderful that no one could understand.\r\n\r\n"Shut up, you big Swede, go and learn English," somebody said.\r\n\r\n"He don\'t have to shut up." The voice of Marsh cut in, and the mass\r\nbacked up his curt rebuke by a murmur of approval. He had risen and come\r\nforward, and now waited till there was absolute silence. "Everyone gets\r\na hearing here," he said. "We\'ve got nine nationalities, but each one\r\nchecks his race at the door. Every man is to have a fair show. What we\r\nneed is an interpreter. Where\'s someone who can help this Swede?"\r\n\r\nThere was a quick stirring in the mass and then a man was shoved out of\r\nit. He went over to the speaker, who at once began talking intensely.\r\n\r\n"The first thing he wants to say," said the interpreter at the end of\r\nthe torrent, "is that he\'d rather be dead than a Swede. He says he\'s a\r\nNorwegian. His second point is that all bad feeling between\r\nnationalities ought to be stopped if the strike\'s to be won. He says\r\nhe\'s seen fights already between Irish and Eyetalians."\r\n\r\nUp leaped an enormous negro docker who sounded as though he preached\r\noften on Sundays.\r\n\r\n"Yes, brothers," he boomed, "let us stop our fights. Let us desist--let\r\nus refrain. We are men from all countries, black and white. The last\r\nspeaker came from Norway--he came from way up there in the North. My\r\nfather came from Africa----"\r\n\r\n"He must have come last Monday," said a dry, thin voice from the back of\r\nthe hall, and there was a laugh.\r\n\r\n"Brothers," cried the black man, "I come here from the colored race. At\r\nmy dock I got over sixty negroes to walk out. Is there no place for us\r\nin this strike? If my father was a slave, is my color so against me?"\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t your color, it\'s your scabbing," a sharp voice interrupted.\r\n"They broke the last strike with coons like you. They brought you up in\r\nboats from the South. And you scabbed--you scabbed yourself! Didn\'t you?\r\nYou did! You ---- of a nigger!"\r\n\r\nA little Italian sprang up in reply. He did not look like a docker. He\r\nwas gaily dressed in a neat blue suit with a bright red tie:\r\n\r\n"Fellow workers--I am Italian man! You call me Guinney, Dago, Wop--you\r\ncall another man Coon, Nigger--you call another man a Sheeny! Stop\r\ncalling names--call men fellow workers! We are on strike--let us not\r\nfight each other--let us have peace--let us have a good time! I know a\r\nman who has a big boat--and he say now we can have it for nothing--to\r\ntake our wives and children and make excursions every day. On the boat\r\nwe will have a good time. I am a musician--I play the violin on a boat\r\ntill I strike--so now I will get you the music. And we shall run that\r\nboat ourselves! We have our own dockers to start it from dock--we have\r\nour own stokers, our own engineers--we have our own pilots--we have all!\r\nAnd it will be easy to steer that boat--for we have made the harbor\r\nempty--we shall have the whole place to ourselves! Some day maybe soon\r\nwe have all the boats in the world for ourselves--and we shall be free!\r\nAll battle boats we shall sink in the sea--we stop all wars! So now we\r\nbegin--we stop all our fighting--we take out this boat--all our\r\ncomrades on board! No coons, no niggers, no sheenies, no wops! Fellow\r\nworkers--I tell you the name of our boat! _The Internationale!_"\r\n\r\nThe little man\'s speech was greeted with a sudden roar of applause. For\r\nthe crowd had seen at once this danger of race hatred and was eager to\r\nput it down. _The Internationale_ made her first trip on the following\r\nday, and after that her daily cruise became the gala event of the\r\nstrike. Both decks of the clumsy craft were packed with strikers, their\r\nwives and their children, and all up and down the harbor she went. The\r\nlittle Italian and his friends had had printed a red pamphlet,\r\n"Revolutionary Songs of the Sea," the solos of which he sang on the boat\r\nwhile the rest came in on the chorus. A new kind of a "chanty man" was\r\nhe, voicing the wrongs and the fierce revolt and the surging hopes and\r\nlongings of all the toilers on the sea--while this ship that was run by\r\nthe workers themselves plowed over a strange new harbor. I watched it\r\none day from the end of a pier. It approached with a swelling volume of\r\nsong. It drew so near I could see the flushed faces of those who were\r\nsinging, some with their eyes on their leader\'s face, others singing out\r\nover the water as though they were spreading far and wide the exultant\r\nprophecy of that song. It passed, the singing died away--and still I sat\r\nthere wondering.\r\n\r\n"We shall have all the boats in the world for ourselves--and we shall be\r\nfree! All battle boats we shall sink in the sea! We stop all wars! So\r\nnow we begin!"\r\n\r\nWas it indeed a beginning? Was this the opening measure of music that\r\nwould be heard round the world? My mind rejected the idea, I thought it\r\nmerest madness. But still that song rang in my ears. What deep\r\ncompelling force was here--this curious power of the crowd that had so\r\nsuddenly gripped hold of this simple Italian musician, this fiddler on\r\nexcursion boats, and in a few short days and nights had made him pour\r\ninto music the fire of its world-wide dreams?\r\n\r\nI saw it seize on others. One day a young girl rose up in the hall. A\r\nstenographer on one of the docks, she was neatly, rather sprucely\r\ndressed, but her face was white and scared. She had never made a speech\r\nbefore. She was speaking now as though impelled by something she could\r\nnot control.\r\n\r\n"Comrades--fellow workers." Her voice trembled violently. She paused and\r\nset her teeth, went on. "How about the women and babies?" she asked. "I\r\nknow of one who was born last night. And that\'s only one of a lot. We\r\nhave thousands of kids and old people--sick people too, and cripples and\r\ndrunks--all that these lovely jobs of ours have left on our backs.\r\nThey\'ve got to be carried. Who\'s to take care of \'em, feed \'em, doctor\r\n\'em? If we\'re going to run the earth let\'s begin at home. What does\r\nanyone know about that?"\r\n\r\nShe sat down with a kind of a gasp of relief. Her seat was close to the\r\nplatform, and I could see her bright excited eyes as she listened to\r\nwhat she had started here. For the crowd, as though it had only been\r\nwaiting for this girl to speak its thought, now seized upon her\r\nquestion. Sharp voices were heard all over the hall. Some said they\r\ncould get doctors, others knew of empty stores that could be had for\r\nnothing and used as free food stations. An assistant cook from an ocean\r\nliner told where his chief bought wholesale supplies. And the girl who\r\nhad roused this discussion, her nervousness forgotten now, rose up again\r\nand again with so many quick, eager suggestions, that when the first\r\nrelief station was opened that evening she was one of those placed in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nI saw her grow amazingly, for now I came to know her well. Her name was\r\nNora Ganey. At home that night when Eleanore said, "Remember, dear, I\r\nwant something to do that will let me see the strike for myself"--I\r\nthought at once of this work of relief. Eleanore would be good at this,\r\nshe had trained herself in just such work. And it appealed to her at\r\nonce. She went down with me the next morning, and she and Nora Ganey,\r\nthough their lives had been so different, yet proved at once to be\r\nkindred souls. Eleanore gave half her time to the work, and these two\r\nbecame fast friends.\r\n\r\nBefore the strike Nora had sat all day in an office pounding a\r\ntypewriter, several nights a week she had gone to dances in public\r\nhalls, and that had made her entire life. In the strike she was at her\r\nfood station all day, and each evening till late she visited homes,\r\nlooking into appeals for aid and if need be issuing tickets for food.\r\nShe heard the bitterest stories from wives of harbor victims, and she\r\nbegan telling these stories in speeches. Soon she was sent out over the\r\ncity to speak at meetings and ask for aid. With Eleanore I went one\r\nnight to hear this young stenographer speak to twenty thousand in\r\nMadison Square Garden. And the strike leader who made that speech was\r\nnot the girl of two weeks before. Her life had been as utterly changed\r\nas though she had jumped to another world.\r\n\r\nThrough Marsh and Joe, in those tense days, I was fast making striker\r\nfriends. With some I had long intimate talks, I ate many kitchen suppers\r\nand spent many evenings in tenement homes. But though by degrees I felt\r\nmyself drawn to these men who called me "Bill," when alone with each one\r\nI felt little or none of that passion born of the crowd as a whole. With\r\na sharp drop, a sudden reaction, I would feel this new world gone. Its\r\nstrength and its wide vision would seem like mere illusions now. What\r\ncould we little pigmies do with the world? Its guidance was for Dillon\r\nand all the big men I had known. Often in those days of groping, knotty\r\nproblems all unsolved, with a sickening hunger I would think of those\r\nmen at the top, of their keen minds so thoroughly trained, their vast\r\nexperience in affairs. I would feel myself in a hopeless mob, a dense,\r\nheavy jungle of ignorant minds. And groping for a foothold here I would\r\nfind only chaos.\r\n\r\nBut back we would go into the crowd, and there in a twinkling we would\r\nbe changed. Once more we were members of the whole and took on its huge\r\npersonality. And again the vision came to me, the dream of a weary world\r\nset free, a world where poverty and pain and all the bitterness they\r\nbring might in the end be swept away by this awakening giant here--which\r\nday by day assumed for me a personality of its own. Slowly I began to\r\nfeel what It wanted, what It hated, how It planned and how It acted. And\r\nthis to me was a miracle, the one great miracle of the strike. For years\r\nI had labored to train myself to concentrate on one man at a time, to\r\nshut out all else for weeks on end, to feel this man so vividly that his\r\nself came into mine. Now with the same intensity I found myself striving\r\nday and night to feel not one but thousands of men, a blurred\r\nbewildering multitude. And slowly in my striving I felt them fuse\r\ntogether into one great being, look at me with two great eyes, speak to\r\nme with one deep voice, pour into me with one tremendous burning passion\r\nfor the freedom of mankind.\r\n\r\nWas this another god of mine?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great voice of the crowd--incessant, demanding of me and of all\r\nwithin hearing to throw in our lives, to join in this march to a new\r\nfree world regardless of all risk to ourselves--grew clear to me now.\r\n\r\nI felt myself drawn in with the rest. I was helping in the publicity\r\nwork, each day I met with the leaders to draw up statements for the\r\npress. And these messages to the outside world that I wrote to the slow\r\nand labored dictation of some burly docker comrade, or again by myself\r\nat dawn to express the will of a meeting that had lasted half the\r\nnight--slowly became for me my own. Almost unawares I had taken the\r\nhabit of asking:\r\n\r\n"How much can _we_ do? How sane and vigilant can _we_ be to keep clear\r\nof violence, bloodshed, mobs and a return to chaos? How long can we hold\r\ntogether fast? How far can we march toward this promised land?"\r\n\r\nIn order to see ourselves as a whole and feel our swiftly swelling\r\nstrength, having now burst the confines of our hall, we began to hold\r\nmeetings out on "the Farm." There are many "farms" on the waterfront,\r\nfor a "farm" is simply the open shore space in front of a dock. But\r\nthis, which was one of the widest of all, now came to be spoken of as\r\n"the Farm," and took on an atmosphere all its own. For there were scenes\r\nhere which will long endure in the memories of thousands of people. For\r\nthem it will be a great bright spot in the times gone by--in one of\r\nthose times behind the times, as this strange world keeps rushing on.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of a pile of sand, where I stood with the speakers at the\r\nend of a soft April day, I saw the whole Farm massed solid with people.\r\nThis mass rose in hummocks and hills of humanity over the piles of brick\r\nand sand and of crates and barrels dumped by the trucks, and out over\r\nthe water they covered the barges and the tugs, and there were even\r\nhundreds upon the roofs of docksheds. The yelp of a dog was heard now\r\nand then and the faint cries of children. But the mass as a whole stood\r\nmotionless, without a sound. They had stood thus since two o\'clock, and\r\nnow the sun was setting. To the west the harbor was empty, no smoke from\r\nships obscured the sun, and it shone with radiant clearness upon eleven\r\nraces of men, upon Italians, Germans, French, on English, Poles and\r\nRussians, on Negroes and Norwegians, Lascars, Malays, Coolies, on\r\nfigures burly, figures puny, faces white and faces swarthy, yellow,\r\nbrown and black. The sun shone upon all alike--except where that Morgan\r\nliner, still lying unloaded at her dock, threw a long dark creeping\r\nshadow out across the throng.\r\n\r\nThirty thousand people were here. Thirty thousand intensely alive. As I\r\neagerly watched their faces it was not their poverty now but their\r\nboundless fresh vitality that took hold of me so hard. I had read many\r\nradical books of late, in my groping for a foothold, and I had found\r\nmost of them dry affairs. But now the crowd through its leaders had laid\r\nhold upon the thoughts in these books, had made them its own and so\r\ngiven them life. In the process the thoughts had been twisted and bent,\r\nsome parts ignored and others brought out of all their nice proportions.\r\nExaggeration, sentiment, all kinds of crudity were here. But it was\r\ncrudity alive, a creed was here in action. Out of all the turmoil, the\r\ntake and give, the jar and clash back there in the meeting hall, had\r\ncome certain thoughts and passions, hopes and plans, that the multitude\r\nhad not ignored or hooted but had caught up and cheered into life. And\r\nthese ideas that they had cheered were now being pounded back into their\r\nminds. Monotonous repetition, you say? Yes, monotonous repetition--slow\r\nsledgehammer blows upon something red hot--pounding, pounding,\r\npounding--that when it cooled its shape might be changed.\r\n\r\nNora Ganey was speaking.\r\n\r\n"Look at those ocean liners!" she cried. Her voice was sharp and\r\nstrident. "They\'re paralyzed now, and because they are they\'re costing\r\nthe big companies millions of dollars every day. That\'s what their time\r\nis worth to their owners. But what are those ships worth to you? Ten\r\ndollars a week and a broken arm--or a leg or a skull, you can take your\r\nchoice. Six thousand of you men were crippled or crushed to death last\r\nyear--and that, let me remind you, was only in the port of New York. Why\r\nwas it? Why did it have to be? And why will it always have to be until\r\nyou make these ships your own? Because, fellow workers, the time of the\r\nships is worth so much to their owners that the work has got to be\r\nrushed day and night--and in that rush somebody\'s bound to get hurt--if\r\nhe isn\'t killed he\'s lucky! And as for the rest, when at last you\'re\r\nthrough and dead tired--they point to the saloons and say, \'Now have a\r\nfew drinks! We won\'t need you again till next Tuesday\'! Do you know what\r\nall this means in your homes? It means drunks, cripples, sick and poor!\r\nIt means such sights as I\'ll never forget. I\'ve seen \'em all--just\r\nlately!\r\n\r\n"I never thought of such things before. I liked my office job on the\r\ndock and all the jobs around me--and when sailing time drew near I liked\r\nthe last excitement. I liked the rich furs and dresses and the cute\r\nlittle earrings and slippers and dogs that were attached to the women\r\nwho came. I liked to see them pile out of their motors and laugh and\r\nmake eyes at the men they belonged to. I liked to peep into the cabins\r\nthey had--get on to all the luxuries there.\r\n\r\n"But out of all this magnificence, friends, and this work that keeps it\r\ngoing--I saw one day a man come on a stretcher. He was dead. And that\r\nstarted me thinking. That\'s why I came out when the strike was called.\r\nAnd in the strike I\'ve gone into your homes. I\'ve seen what those soft\r\nexpensive female dolls and all the work that makes them costs. And I\'ve\r\ngot a thrill of another kind! It\'s a thrill that\'ll last for the rest of\r\nmy life! And in yours, too, fellow workers! For I believe that you\'ll go\r\nright on--that you\'ll strike and strike and strike again--till you make\r\nthese tenements own these ships--and a life won\'t be thrown away for a\r\ndollar!"\r\n\r\nShe stopped sharply and stepped back, and there burst out a frenzy of\r\napplause, which died down to be caught up and prolonged and deepened\r\ninto a steady roar, as Marsh came slowly forward. He stood there\r\nbareheaded, impassive and quiet, listening to the great voice of the\r\nmass. At last he turned to the chairman. The latter picked up a whistle,\r\nand at that piercing call to order slowly the cheering began to subside.\r\nFaces pressed eagerly closer. Marsh looked all around him.\r\n\r\n"Fellow workers," he began, "it\'s hard for a man to be understood when\r\nhe\'s talking to men from all over the world." He pointed down to a\r\ncluster of Lascars with white turbans on their heads. "_You_ don\'t\r\nunderstand me. But some of your comrades will give you my speech, for we\r\nare all strike brothers here. On the ship there is no flag--on the ship\r\nthere is no nation--on the ship there is only work--on the ship there\r\nare only the workers!\r\n\r\n"For a ship may be equipped with the most powerful engines to drive\r\nher--she may have the best brains to direct her course--but the ship\r\ncan\'t sail until you go aboard! You\'re the men who make the ships of\r\nuse, you\'re the men who give value to the stock of all the big ship\r\ncompanies! You are the ship industry--and to you the ship industry\r\nshould belong!\r\n\r\n"I want you now to think of a tombstone. Out in the Atlantic, two miles\r\ndown they tell me, a big ship is stuck with her bow in the ooze of the\r\nocean floor and her stern six hundred feet up in the water. In the cold\r\ngreen light down there she looks like a tombstone--and she is packed\r\nwith dead people inside. She is there because where she should have had\r\nlifeboats she had French cafes instead, and sun parlors for the ladies.\r\nSome of these ladies went down with the ship, and we heard a lot about\r\ntheir screams. But we haven\'t heard much of the cries for help of the\r\nthousands of men who go down every year in rotten old ships upon the\r\nseas! Nor have we heard of the millions more who are killed on land--on\r\nthe railroads, in the mines and mills and stinking slums of cities!\r\n\r\n"But now we\'ve decided that cries like these are to be heard all over\r\nthe world. For we\'ve only got one life apiece--we\'re not quite sure of\r\nanother. And because we do all the work that is done we want all the\r\nlife there is to be had! All the life there is to be had--that\'s what we\r\nare striking for! That is our share of the life in this world! And until\r\nwe get our share this labor war will have no end! Other wars may come\r\nand go--but under them all on land and sea this war of ours will go\r\nsteadily on--will swallow up all other wars--will swallow up in all your\r\nminds all hatred of your brother men! For you they will be workers all!\r\nWith them you will rise--and the world will be free!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the long stormy din of cheers had little by little died away Joe\r\nKramer began the last speech of the day. He had eaten and slept little,\r\nhe had lived on coffee and cigarettes, and there was a strained look in\r\nhis deep eyes as he rose up lean and gaunt by my side.\r\n\r\n"I\'m here to-day to speak to the men who work in stokeholes naked," he\r\nsaid. "I\'m here to talk of the lives you lead--the lives that millions\r\nbefore you have led--for a few brief years--and then they have died. For\r\nlives in stokeholes are not long. And before I begin I propose that we\r\nstand for a moment with uncovered heads." He looked out over the\r\nmultitude as though seeing far beyond them, and his voice was as harsh\r\nas the look in his eyes. "As a tribute to all the dead stokers," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nAnd in a breathless silence the multitude did what he had asked. Joe\r\nbroke this silence sharply.\r\n\r\n"Now for life and the living," he said. "Why was it that those men all\r\ndied? What has the change from sails to steam done to the lives of the\r\nmen at sea?\r\n\r\n"The old sailor at least had air to breathe. But what you breathe is red\r\nhot gas--I know because I\'ve been there. There is a gong upon the wall,\r\nand when it clangs you heave in coal, and if when it clangs faster you\r\ndon\'t keep quite up to its pace, a white light flashes out of the wall,\r\nand that light is the Chief Engineer\'s way of saying, \'God damn you,\r\nkeep up those fires down there! Time is money! Who are you?\'\r\n\r\n"The old-time sailor lived on deck. He had the winds, the sun and the\r\nstars. But you live down between steel walls--with only the glare of\r\nelectric lights in which you sleep and eat and sweat. You work at all\r\nkinds of irregular hours, for you there is no day or night. You don\'t\r\nknow whether the millionaire and his last and loveliest wife are\r\ndrinking champagne before going to bed, in their cabin de luxe above\r\nyou, or taking their coffee the next day at noon. You don\'t know about\r\nanything way up there--unless you go up as I\'ve seen you do, half out of\r\nyour senses from the heat, and make a sudden jump for the rail. The cry\r\nis heard--\'Man overboard!\'--then shrieks and a chorus of \'Oh-my-God\'s!\'\r\nAnd then somebody says, \'It\'s only a stoker.\'"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, and at the sudden roar of the crowd I saw him frown\r\nand quiver. He drew a deep, slow breath and went on:\r\n\r\n"They threw off all the good in the ship with sails--but they carefully\r\nkept all that was bad. The old mutiny laws--they kept all that.\r\nUndermanning of crews--they kept all that. The waterfront sharks--they\r\nkept all that. But there was one thing they couldn\'t keep--the old\r\nsailor\'s habit of standing all this! He had run away to sea as a boy,\r\nhe\'d been kicked all his life by the bucko mate into a state where he\r\ncouldn\'t kick back. But with you men it is not so. Among all the\r\nthousands standing here most were on shore a few years ago, and you took\r\nyour land views with you on board. You organized seamen\'s unions. The\r\none in this country was meek and mild. It did not strike, it went on its\r\nknees to Congress instead, and here\'s part of the written petition it\r\nmade. \'We raise our manacled hands in humble supplication--and we pray\r\nthat the nations of the earth issue a decree for our emancipation--restore\r\nus our rights as brother men.\' But Congress had no ear for you then.\r\nSailors are men who have no votes. And so you failed in your pleading.\r\n\r\n"But in the labor movement there seems to be no such word as fail! You\r\nhave not given up your union--instead you have formed one of a kind more\r\ndangerous to your masters! You have not made smaller your requests--no,\r\nyou are now demanding more! And instead of asking for merciful laws you\r\nare saying, \'We are done with your laws, will have none of your laws,\r\nwill break your laws when they come in our way!\'\r\n\r\n"And what do your masters answer? Here are thousands of deserters--every\r\nman here has broken the law by leaving his ship! But have they tried to\r\narrest you? No! They\'re afraid to arrest twenty thousand men, they\'re\r\nafraid of this strike, they\'re afraid of you! They\'re so almighty scared\r\ndowntown that though we\'ve been only a week on strike they\'ve already\r\nsent their commands to their Congress to give us what merciful laws we\r\nlike. They\'re scared because we\'ve thrown over their laws--because they\r\nknow that we now see our power--to stop all their ships and the trade of\r\ntheir land and send their stock market into a panic!\r\n\r\n"And now do you know what I want you to do? I want you to look at their\r\nships, at their docks, at their harbor, men--and laugh--laugh! Don\'t you\r\nsee there\'s no need of violence? Laugh! In old times the people built\r\nbarricades. You don\'t need barricades nor any guns--all you\'ve got to do\r\nis to stand here and laugh! Look at all you have done to your\r\nbosses--and laugh! To this town, to this nation--and laugh, laugh!\r\nLook--and think--of what you _can_ do--all you--and you--and you--and\r\nyou--by just folding your arms! Think of all you _will_ do! And\r\nlaugh--laugh! Laugh! Laugh!"\r\n\r\nHe broke off with both arms raised, and there followed one moment\r\nwithout a sound. Then suddenly, quick and hard and clear, from a corner\r\nof this human ocean, I heard a single peal of laughter. In an instant\r\nscores joined in. Rising in outbursts here and there, deepening, rushing\r\nout over the Farm, it gathered and rolled in wave on wave, rising,\r\nalways rising. And it swelled into such a laugh that I saw the police\r\nfeel for their clubs. Reporters scrambled for high places, turned their\r\nkodaks on it all. Women snatched up their babies in terror and ran.\r\nMarsh stepped forward, caught Joe by the arm and jerked him back to\r\nwhere I was standing. I gripped Joe\'s hand, it was icy cold.\r\n\r\nMarsh shouted to the chairman, and the piercing whistle for order was\r\nheard. But it took a long time for that laugh to die. Long after the\r\nmeeting had broken up I saw groups gather together, and presently they\r\nwould begin to laugh, and their laughter would take on again that same\r\nconvulsive tensity. I heard small clusters laughing, and dense throngs\r\nin hot saloons where the low rooms would echo and double the roar.\r\n\r\nLate at night out on the waterfront, under the bow of that Morgan ship,\r\nI found two strikers smoking their pipes, and I sat down and lighted\r\nmine. One was a Lascar, the other a Pole. In the strike these wanderers\r\nover the earth had met on the waterfront under a wagon where each had\r\ncome to sleep the night. Since then they had become good friends. Each\r\nspoke a little English, each one had caught bits here and there from the\r\nspeeches made that afternoon--and they had been trying to pool what\r\nthey\'d heard, trying to find why it was they had laughed. As now I tried\r\nto give them the gist of what Joe Kramer had said, from time to time\r\nthey would glance up at the big ship they had paralyzed and chuckle\r\nsoftly to themselves.\r\n\r\nThen I went on to Marsh\'s speech. And out there in the darkness I could\r\nfeel their rough faces, one white and one brown, grow deeply, eagerly\r\nintent, as these strike brothers listened to the voice that had spoken\r\nthe dream of the crowd:\r\n\r\n"Other wars may come and go--but under them all on land and sea this war\r\nof ours will go steadily on--will swallow up all other wars--will\r\nswallow up in all your minds all hatred of your brother men. For you\r\nthey will be workers all. With them you will rise--and the world will be\r\nfree."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nTo all this, from the buildings far downtown that loomed like tall grim\r\nshadows, the big companies said nothing.\r\n\r\nBut that same night, while I sat talking to those two men, we heard a\r\nsharp excited cry. We saw a man behind us running along the line of\r\nsaloons. From these and from the tenements came pouring angry throngs of\r\nmen. And out of the hubbub I caught the words,\r\n\r\n"They\'re bringing in the scabs! By boat!"\r\n\r\nPast a watchman that I knew I ran into a dockshed and out to the open\r\nend of the dock. And there I saw a weird ominous scene. Up the empty\r\nharbor, under a dark and cloudy sky, came four barges, black with negro\r\nlaborers, and ahead and around and behind them came police boats\r\nthrowing their searchlights upon an angry swarm of union picket dories,\r\nfrom which as they drew nearer I heard furious voices shouting, "Scab!"\r\nOne of the barges docked where I stood and the negroes quickly slunk\r\ninside. I drew back from them as they passed, for to me too they were\r\n"scabs" that night. Afraid to face the men outside, whose jobs they had\r\ntaken, these strike-breakers were to live on the dock, under cover of\r\npolice. Soon half of them lay snoring on long crowded rows of cots. Food\r\nand hot coffee were served to the rest. Then I heard the harsh rattle of\r\nwinches, I saw these negroes trundling freight, the cargo went swooping\r\nup into the ship--and with a deep dismay, a sharp foreboding of trouble\r\nahead, I felt the work of the harbor begun.\r\n\r\nI heard a quick voice at my elbow:\r\n\r\n"Say. What the hell are _you_ doing here!" I turned to the Pinkerton man\r\nby my side:\r\n\r\n"I\'m reporting this strike."\r\n\r\n"No you\'re not, you\'re in here to report what you see to the strikers.\r\nNow don\'t let\'s have any words, my friend, we\'ve seen you in their\r\nmeeting-hall and we\'ve all got your number. Go on out where you belong!"\r\n\r\nSo I went out where I belonged.\r\n\r\nI went out to the crowd--but I found it changed, split up into furious\r\nswarms of men, I found the beginning of chaos here. And the world that I\r\nhad left behind, the old world of order and rule from above, which I had\r\nall but forgotten of late, now sharply made its presence felt. For the\r\ngod I had once known so well was neither dead nor sleeping. Behind\r\nclosed doors, the doors that had flown open once to show me every\r\ncourtesy, it had been silently laying plans and sending forth orders or\r\n"requests" to all those in its service.\r\n\r\nThe next day the newspapers changed their tone. Until now they had given\r\nus half the front page. Every statement I had written had been printed\r\nword for word. The reporters had been free to dig columns of "human\r\ninterest stuff" out of the rich mine of color here, and they had gone at\r\nit hungrily, many with real sympathy. You would have thought the entire\r\npress was on the side of the strikers, at times it had almost seemed to\r\nme as though the entire country had risen in revolt. But now all this\r\nwas suddenly stopped, and in its place the front pages were filled with\r\nnews of a very different kind. "Big Companies Move at Last," were the\r\nheadlines, "Work of Breaking Strike Begun." The first ship would sail\r\nthat evening, three more would be ready to start the next day, and\r\nwithin a week the big companies hoped to resume the regular service.\r\nThey regretted the loss to shippers of all the perishable produce which\r\nto the value of millions of dollars had been rotting away at the docks.\r\nThey deplored the inconvenience and ruin which had been brought on the\r\ninnocent public by these bodies of rough, irresponsible men who had\r\nopenly defied the law. With such men there could be no arbitration, and\r\nin fact there was no need. The port would be open inside of a week.\r\n\r\nSo the big companies spoke at last. And as I read the papers, at home\r\nthat day at breakfast, I remembered what Eleanore\'s father had said:\r\n"Don\'t let yourself forget for one minute that the men behind me are\r\ngoing to stamp out this strike." Not without a fight, I thought. But I\r\nwas anxious and depressed. Dillon had not come of late, he had felt that\r\nwe wanted to be alone. As now I glanced at Eleanore, whose eyes were\r\nintent on the news of the day, I saw with a rush of pity and love how\r\nalone she suddenly felt in all this. A moment later she looked up.\r\n\r\n"Pretty bad, isn\'t it, dear?" she said.\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t look very fine just now."\r\n\r\n"Are you going down to the docks?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, they\'ll want me," I replied, "to write some answer to this stuff."\r\n\r\n"Can you wait a few moments?" Eleanore rose. "I\'ll get on my hat. I\r\npromised Nora Ganey I\'d run her relief station for her to-day." I took\r\nher a moment in my arms:\r\n\r\n"You\'re no quitter, are you?" I said.\r\n\r\n"We\'re in this now," she answered, just a little breathlessly. "And so\r\nof course we\'ll see it through."\r\n\r\nSo we went down together.\r\n\r\nThe waterfront looked different now. In front of the docks where work\r\nhad begun a large space had been roped off. Inside the rope was an\r\nunbroken cordon of police. And without, but pressing close, the\r\nmultitude of people for whom in a day so much had been changed, moved\r\nrestlessly, no longer sure of its power, no longer sure of anything but\r\na fast rising hatred of the men who had taken their jobs. As at times\r\nthe police lines tightened and the negroes came out for more freight,\r\nthousands of ominous eyes looked on. Standing here at one such time, I\r\nsaw a negro striker pass. His head was down and he walked quickly--for\r\nrace feeling had begun.\r\n\r\nThe first ship sailed that evening. Tens of thousands watched her sail.\r\nAnd a bitter voice beside me said,\r\n\r\n"Laughing ain\'t going to be enough."\r\n\r\nAmong men on strike there are two kinds of attitudes toward those who\r\ntake their places. The first is the scorn of the man who is winning.\r\n"You are a dirty scab," it says. "You\'re a Judas to the working class\r\nand a thief who is trying to steal my job. But you won\'t get it, we\'re\r\nbound to win, and you\'re barely worth kicking out of the way." The\r\nsecond is quite a different feeling. In this is the fear of the man who\r\nis losing--and fear, as an English writer has said, is the great mother\r\nof violence. "You _may keep_ my job! And if you do I\'ll be left with\r\nnothing to live on!" It is this second attitude which is dreaded by\r\nstrike leaders, for it leads to a loss of all control, to machine guns\r\nand defeat.\r\n\r\nWith a deepening uneasiness I saw this feeling now appear. Starting in\r\nsmall groups of men, I saw it spread out over the mass with the speed of\r\na prairie fire. I felt it that afternoon on the Farm, changing with a\r\nstartling speed that sure and mighty giant, the crowd, into a blind\r\ndisordered throng, a mottled mass of groups of men angrily discussing\r\nthe news. Threats against "scabs" were shouted out, the word "scab"\r\narose on every side. Bitter things were said against "coons," not only\r\n"scabs" but "all of \'em, God damn \'em!" There were hints of violence and\r\nopen threats of sabotage, things done to dock machinery.\r\n\r\nBut presently, by slow degrees, as though by a deep instinct groping for\r\nthe giant spirit that had been its life and soul, I felt the crowd now\r\ngather itself. Slowly the cries all died away and all eyes turned to the\r\nleader. Facing them with arms upraised, Marsh stood on the speakers\'\r\npile, his own face imperturbable, his own voice absolutely sure.\r\n\r\n"Boys," he said, when silence had come, "one lonesome ship has gone to\r\nsea--so badly loaded, they tell me, that she ain\'t got even a chance in\r\na storm. She was loaded by scabs."\r\n\r\nA savage storm of "booh\'s" burst forth. He waited until it subsided and\r\nthen continued quietly:\r\n\r\n"We have no use for scabs, black or white. But we have use for strikers,\r\n_both_ black and white--our negro brothers are with us still, and we\'ll\r\nshow them we know that they are our brothers. We\'re going to stand\r\ntogether, we won\'t let the bosses split us apart. And when we read the\r\npapers to-morrow we\'re going to ask if the news is all there--not the\r\nlittle news in big headlines about a ship or two leaving port, but the\r\nbig news in a little paragraph, that you have so stopped this nation\'s\r\ntrade that now its Congress is demanding that your masters come to\r\nterms! And as for this lonesome ship that has sailed, if you want to see\r\njust how much that means, go down and look at Wall Street. They say down\r\nthere, \'We\'re all right now.\' But their market prices say, \'We\'re all\r\nwrong!\'"\r\n\r\nSuddenly out of the multitude there came a high, clear voice:\r\n\r\n"You seem to know Wall Street, Brother Marsh. Have you been selling\r\nshort down there? Who\'s your private broker?"\r\n\r\nInstantly there was a rush toward the questioner, but a group of police\r\nformed quickly around him and he was hurried out of the way.\r\n\r\n"Get after that, Jim, get after it quick!" said Joe by my side. And\r\nMarsh lost not a moment.\r\n\r\n"Let that man go!" he shouted. "He was sent here to try to stir up a\r\nriot. That lie was framed up \'way downtown! But it is a lie and you all\r\nknow it--you know how I live and how my wife lives--we don\'t exactly\r\nroll in wealth! But even if I were a crook, or if I were dead, this\r\nstrike would go on exactly the same--for think a minute and you\'ll see\r\nthat whatever has been done in this struggle has been done each time by\r\nyou. It\'s you who have decided each point. It\'s you who have been called\r\nhere to-day to decide the one big question. Congress has said,\r\n\'Arbitrate.\' It\'s for you all to decide on our answer. This is no\r\none-man union, there is no one man they can fix, nor even a small\r\ncommittee. We\'re a committee of fifty thousand here to make our own laws\r\nfor ourselves. As you lift up your hands and vote, so it will be\r\ndecided. But before you do I want to say this. I care so little for Wall\r\nStreet and I am so sure we\'ll win this strike, that with all the\r\nstrength I have in me I beg you to answer, \'No arbitration, nothing half\r\nway! All or nothing!\' If this is your answer, hold up your hands!"\r\n\r\nUp went the hands by thousands, the crowd was all together now and again\r\nit spoke in one great roar. And with a sudden rush of hope I told\r\nmyself, "It\'s still alive! This fight has only just begun!"\r\n\r\n"That is our answer to Congress," said Marsh, when again quiet had been\r\nrestored. "That is the law which we have enacted. This strike is to be\r\nfought through to the end. We are not to be scared by Wall Street or\r\nworked upon by their hired thugs and so resort to violence. I am not\r\nafraid of violence," he continued sharply, "I am here to preach it. But\r\nthe only violence I preach is the violence of folded arms. You have\r\nfolded your arms and their ships are dead. No other kind is so deadly as\r\nthat. Only hold to this kind of violence, and though they may send out a\r\nship here and there, this great port of New York will stay\r\nclosed--bringing ruin all over the land--till the nation turns to Wall\r\nStreet and says, \'We cannot wait! You will have to give in!\'"\r\n\r\nAs he ended his speech, it seemed to me as though he were reaching far\r\nout, gripping that throng and holding it in. But for how long could he\r\nhold them?\r\n\r\nEvery paper that they read had suddenly turned against them and\r\nprophesied their swift defeat. Two more ships sailed that night. And as\r\nMarsh had foretold, their sailing was played up in pictures and huge\r\nheadlines, while the statement that I wrote was cut to one small\r\nparagraph and put upon the second page.\r\n\r\nThat night, with the eager aid of strikers of five nationalities, I\r\nwrote a message to the crowd, translated it into German and French,\r\nSpanish, Italian and Polish. A socialist paper loaned us their press,\r\nand by noon our message was scattered in leaflets all up and down the\r\nwaterfront. This message went out daily now. For the greater part of\r\neach night I sat in strike headquarters and wrote direct to the\r\ntenements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day Marsh proposed a parade, and the Farm took it up with\r\nprompt acclaim. He challenged the mayor of the city to stop it. To\r\nfriends who came to him later he said:\r\n\r\n"You tell the mayor that I\'m doing my best to give these men something\r\npeaceful to do. If he wants to help me, all well and good. If he don\'t,\r\nlet him try to stop this parade."\r\n\r\nAnd the mayor granted a permit.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon the Fifth Avenue shops all closed their doors, and\r\nover the rich displays in their windows heavy steel shutters were rolled\r\ndown. The long procession of motors and cabs with their gaily dressed\r\nshoppers had disappeared, and in their place was another procession,\r\nmen, women and children, old and young. All around me as I marched I\r\nheard an unending torrent of voices speaking many languages, uniting in\r\nstrange cheers and songs brought from all over the ocean world.\r\nBright-colored turbans bobbed up here and there, for there was no\r\nseparation of races, all walked together in dense crowds, the whole\r\nstrike family was here. And listening and watching I felt myself a\r\nmember now. Behind me came a long line of trucks packed with sick or\r\ncrippled men. At their head was a black banner on which was painted,\r\n"Our Wounded." Behind the wagons a small cheap band came blaring forth a\r\nfuneral dirge, and behind the band, upon men\'s shoulders, came eleven\r\ncoffins, in which were those dock victims who had died in the last few\r\ndays. This section had its banner too, and it was marked, "Our Dead."\r\n\r\nBut at one point, late in the afternoon, some marcher just ahead of me\r\nsuddenly started to laugh. At first I thought he was simply in fun. But\r\nhe kept on. Those near him then caught the look on his face and they all\r\nbegan to laugh with him. Each moment louder, uglier, it swept up the\r\nAvenue. And as it swelled in volume, like the menace of some furious\r\nbeast, the uncontrollable passion I heard filled me again with a sharp\r\nforeboding of violence in the crisis ahead.\r\n\r\n"Why are you here?" I asked myself. "You can\'t join in a laugh like\r\nthat--you\'re no real member of this crowd--their world is not where you\r\nbelong!"\r\n\r\nBut from somewhere deep inside me a voice rose up in answer:\r\n\r\n"If the crowd is growing blind--is this the time to leave it? Wait."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nFive more vessels sailed that day. And in the evening Eleanore said:\r\n\r\n"The women who came to our station to-day kept asking, \'Why can\'t they\r\nclose up the saloons? They\'re just the places for trouble to start.\'"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll try," I said, and that same night Marsh sent word through a\r\nfriend to the mayor asking him to close all barrooms on the waterfront\r\nduring the strike. The mayor sent back a refusal. He said he had no\r\npower.\r\n\r\nLate that night I went down the line and found each barroom packed with\r\nmen who were talking of those ships that had sailed. And they talked of\r\n"scabs." Speakers I had not heard before were now shouting and pounding\r\nthe bar with their fists. The papers the next morning ran lurid accounts\r\nof these saloons and the open threats of violence there. They censured\r\nthe mayor for his weakness and called for the militia. Why wait for mobs\r\nand bloodshed?\r\n\r\nTo that challenge I heard the reply of the crowd, on the Farm that\r\nafternoon, in their applause of the fiery speech of a swarthy little\r\nSpaniard. Francesco Vasca was his name.\r\n\r\n"They are sending hired murderers who will come here to shoot us down!\r\nBut when they come," he shouted, "I want you to remember this! A jail\r\ncell is no smaller than our holes in the bottoms of their ships, the\r\nfood is no worse than the scouse we shall eat if we give in and go back\r\nto our jobs! And so we shall not be driven back! When the militia come\r\nagainst us, armed with guns and bayonets, then let us go to meet them\r\narmed----"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, and from one end to the other of that motionless mass\r\nof men there fell a death-like silence. Then he grimly ended his speech:\r\n\r\n"Armed with patience, courage and a deep belief in our cause."\r\n\r\nIn the sudden storm of cheers and "booh\'s" I leaned over to Joe at my\r\nside:\r\n\r\n"Why did you let that man speak?"\r\n\r\nThe frown tightened on Joe\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Because he\'s one of us," he said.\r\n\r\nSeven more ships had sailed by that night.\r\n\r\nIn front of the docksheds, outside the double line of police, the throng\r\nhad grown denser day by day, and each time the "scabs" came out there\r\nhad been a burst of imprecations, a fierce pressing forward. The police\r\nhad repeatedly used their clubs. Now late in the afternoon a red\r\nhospital ambulance came clanging down the waterfront. It was greeted by\r\ntriumphant shouts. "Some black bastard hurt at last!" There was a quick\r\ngathering of police and a lane was formed reaching into the dock.\r\nThrough this lane drove the ambulance, and as presently it emerged it\r\nwas greeted by tumultuous cheers.\r\n\r\nThe papers the next morning said that a raging, howling mob had tried to\r\nreach the injured man. Cries of "Sabotage!" had been heard. Two men,\r\nthey said, had been injured and one killed on the docks the day before.\r\nWas this Sabotage? Had the strikers fixed the winches with the purpose\r\nof killing strike-breakers? Why not? Their leaders had openly preached\r\nit. Not only the Spaniard but Marsh himself was quoted as favoring\r\nviolence, and from that special Sabotage Issue of Joe Kramer\'s paper\r\nlong extracts were reprinted. Were not these three leaders responsible\r\nfor the death of that innocent black man? And should leaders such as\r\nthese be allowed to go on preaching murder? Put them in jail! Quell this\r\ninsurrection while still there was time! So spoke the press.\r\n\r\nThe rumor quickly spread about that Marsh and the Spaniard and Joe\r\nKramer were to be arrested that day. All three remained at strike\r\nheadquarters, and a dozen burly strikers kept the throng from pouring\r\nin. "Go on home," I could hear them shouting. But far from going, the\r\nthrong increased until it filled the whole street outside. Suddenly we\r\nheard their cries rise into a raging din.\r\n\r\n"Well, boys," said Marsh, "I guess they\'re here." He gave a few more\r\nsharp directions to his aides and then went out into the hall. A dozen\r\nCentral Office police in plain clothes were just coming in at the door.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Marsh, "we\'re ready. But unless you men were sent here\r\nwith the idea of starting trouble, suppose you leave here now without\r\nus. Each one of us will meet you at any place and time you say."\r\n\r\n"We can\'t take your orders, Mr. Marsh."\r\n\r\n"You mean you _were_ sent here for trouble?"\r\n\r\n"I mean I have warrants for the arrest of yourself, Joseph Kramer and\r\nFrancesco Vasca on a charge of incitement to murder."\r\n\r\nAnd in less than a minute I saw Marsh, the Spaniard and Joe Kramer each\r\nhandcuffed to two men, one on either side. As they left the hall I came\r\nclose behind with a score of eager reporters.\r\n\r\nThe crowd, to my excited eyes, was like a crouching tiger now, glaring\r\nout of countless eyes. Through the solid mass of men that packed the\r\nstreet from wall to wall, the police had forced a narrow lane from the\r\npatrol wagon to the door. On either side of this lane I saw a line of\r\nfaces, eyes. Some looked anxious, frightened, and were trying to press\r\nback, but at the sight of their leaders now with a roar the multitude\r\nswept in. In a moment the lane was gone, and some fifty police had\r\nformed in a circle around the prisoners. Quickly their clubs rose and\r\nfell, and men dropped all around them. But furious hundreds kept rushing\r\nin from every side, women and children caught in the tide were swept\r\nhelplessly forward, came under the clubs and went down with the rest,\r\nand still the mass poured over them. Now at last the circle of bluecoats\r\nwas broken, policemen alone and in small clusters were rushed and\r\nwhirled this way and that. Outnumbered twenty to one, they began to go\r\ndown in the scrimmage.\r\n\r\nThen I heard a quick shout:\r\n\r\n"Use your guns!"\r\n\r\nAfter that, two pistol shots. Then more in a sharp, steady crackle. The\r\nmass began breaking, out on the edges I could see men starting to run.\r\nBut down the street came a troop of mounted police on the gallop, and\r\nstraight through the multitude they rode. I saw the three prisoners\r\nseized and surrounded and thrown into the wagon. I saw it go rapidly\r\naway. The police were now making wholesale arrests. That deep strident\r\nroar of the crowd had died down and broken into panting voices,\r\neverywhere were struggling forms.\r\n\r\nJust before me the throng opened and I saw a woman at my feet. Her face\r\nwas bleeding from a club. As I stooped to lift her, I felt a big hand\r\ngrip my arm and then a heavy, crushing weight press down upon my head. I\r\nfelt myself sink down and down into an empty darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to, I was being half pushed and half thrown by police up\r\ninto one of their wagons. I remember a blurred glimpse of more fighting\r\nforms around me. Then a gong clanged and our wagon was off. And in a few\r\nmoments we had emerged out of all this turbulence into the quiet\r\ncommonplace streets of a city of every-day business life.\r\n\r\nIn the wagon a voice began singing. I looked up and saw our Italian\r\nmusician, the leader of those gay excursions on _The Internationale_.\r\nNow he was singing the song of that name. And as all came in on the\r\nchorus, I caught a glimpse of his face. One cheek was bleeding profusely\r\nand with one hand he was keeping the blood from trickling down. With\r\nthe other hand he was beating time. And his black eyes were blazing.\r\n\r\nSoon after, we came to Jefferson Market and stopped at the entrance of\r\nthe jail. As we were hustled out of the wagon, and in the stronger light\r\nour cuts and swelling bruises came suddenly in view, two young girls\r\namong us began to laugh hysterically. In a moment we were inside the\r\njail and shoved into a striker group that had come in wagons ahead of\r\nours. A grim old sergeant at the desk was taking down names and\r\naddresses and sending the prisoners to their cells.\r\n\r\nI found my cell a cool relief after all that fever of cries. With\r\nsurprise I noticed it was clean. I had thought all cells were filthy\r\nholes. Still in a daze, I sat down on my cot and felt the big bruise on\r\nmy head.\r\n\r\n"Where am I? What has happened? What has all this to do with me? What is\r\nit going to mean in my life?"\r\n\r\nI heard a nasal voice from somewhere say:\r\n\r\n"I know this pen. They\'re putting the girls with the prostitutes."\r\n\r\nI heard clanging gongs outside and soon the banging of steel doors as\r\nmore prisoners were put into cells. And little by little, through it\r\nall, I made out a low, eager murmur.\r\n\r\n"Say," inquired a drunken old voice. "Who are all you damn fools? What\r\nis this party, anyhow?"\r\n\r\n"It is a revolution!" a sharp little voice replied. And at that, from\r\nall sides other voices broke out. Then from his cell our musical friend\r\nagain started up the singing, his strained tenor voice rising high over\r\nall. The song rose in volume, grew more intense.\r\n\r\n"Heigh! Quit that noise!" a policeman shouted.\r\n\r\n"Aw, let \'em alone," said another. "They\'ll soon work it off."\r\n\r\nBut we seemed to be only working it up. Up and up, song followed song,\r\nand then short impassioned speeches came out of cells, and there was\r\napplause. A voice asked each one of us to name his nationality, and we\r\nfound we were Americans, Irish, Scotch and Germans, Italians and\r\nNorwegians, and three of us were Lascars and one of us was a Coolie.\r\nThen there were cheers for the working class all over the world, and\r\nafter that a call for more singing. And now, as one of the songs died\r\naway, we heard from the woman\'s part of the jail the young girls singing\r\nin reply.\r\n\r\nAnd slowly as I listened to those songs that rose and swelled and beat\r\nagainst those walls of steel, I felt once more the presence of that\r\ngreat spirit of the crowd.\r\n\r\n"That spirit will go on," I thought. "No jail can stop the thing it\r\nfeels!"\r\n\r\nAnd at last with a deep, warm certainty I felt myself where I belonged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the evening I was taken out to the visitor\'s room, and there I\r\nfound Eleanore\'s father. When he saw me, Dillon smiled.\r\n\r\n"Do you know where you are?" he asked. "You\'re not in the Bastille--or\r\neven Libby Prison. You\'re in the Jefferson Market Jail."\r\n\r\n"It hasn\'t felt that way," I said.\r\n\r\n"Probably not. But it is that way, and there\'s Eleanore to be thought\r\nof."\r\n\r\n"Eleanore will understand."\r\n\r\nI saw his features tighten. I noticed now that his face was drawn, as\r\nthough he, too, had been through a good deal.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "she understands. But it\'s a bit tough on her, isn\'t it?\r\nJail is not quite in her line."\r\n\r\nI felt my throat contracting:\r\n\r\n"I know all that. I\'m sorry enough--on her account----"\r\n\r\n"Then let\'s get out of this," he said. "I\'ve brought you bail. No use\r\nstaying in here all night."\r\n\r\n"None at all," I agreed. "I want to get back to the waterfront. We\'re\r\ngoing to issue an answer to this. They\'ll need me for the writing."\r\n\r\nDillon watched me a moment.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t be allowed to do that," he said. "They\'re under martial law\r\ndown there."\r\n\r\nI looked up at him quickly:\r\n\r\n"The troops are here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied, and there was a pause.\r\n\r\n"These arrests, this riot," I said a little huskily. "Weren\'t they all\r\nframed up ahead? They needed the riot to get in the troops."\r\n\r\n"The troops are here."\r\n\r\n"Rather damnable. Do you think the people on the docks will just sit\r\nback and take it all?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ll have to," he said gently. "The world\'s work has been clogged up\r\na little. It\'s to go on again now."\r\n\r\nOn the street outside he took my hand:\r\n\r\n"My boy, when this is over we\'ll get together, you and I."\r\n\r\n"All right--when it\'s over," I said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Farm that night again changed to my eyes. It was now an orderly\r\nvillage of tents, two regiments of militia were here, and their sentries\r\nreached for a mile to the north watching the big companies\' docks.\r\n\r\nI walked up along the line and had talks with some of the sentries. I\r\nremember one in particular, a thin, nervous little man, a shoe-clerk in\r\na department store. Every work-day for six years he had fitted shoes on\r\nladies\' feet; he had been doing it all that morning. And now here he was\r\ndown on the waterfront with only the stars above him and great shadowy\r\nspaces all around, out of which at any moment he expected rushes by\r\nstrikers. These strikers to him were not human, they were "foreigners,"\r\nfor the moment gone mad, to be treated very much as mad dogs. And here\r\nhe was all by himself, his nerves on edge, with a gun in his hands. The\r\nabsurdity of that gun in his hands! And the serious danger.\r\n\r\nI went into many tenements, into homes I had come to know in the strike.\r\nAnd they, too, were different now. Their principal leaders taken away\r\nand their headquarters closed by the police, the disorganization was\r\ncomplete. That spirit they had relied upon, that strange new spirit of\r\nthe mass which they had created by coming together, was now dead--and\r\neach one felt the weakness of being alone, the weakness of his separate\r\nself. Blindly they fought against their despair. I found them packing\r\ntenement rooms, gathering instinctively in search of their great friend,\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\nBut from such gatherings as these, the weaker, the more timid and the\r\nwiser kept away. Rash spirits led these meetings, and here was the same\r\nhot passion that I had felt back in the jail. These people did not want\r\nto think, the time for thinking had gone by. They wanted to act, to do\r\nsomething quick. Their minds were fiercely set on the "scabs," the\r\npolice and the militia.\r\n\r\nTheir strike was not yet lost. Their friends and sympathizers were\r\nworking hard that very night to get their leaders out on bail. In\r\nWashington a House committee was striving still to compel arbitration.\r\nEverywhere the more moderate spirits were drawing together, trying to\r\nwork out something safe.\r\n\r\nBut these people did not know this. They were in their tenements, they\r\nwere scattered far apart. They only knew how they had been clubbed, that\r\nthree had been killed and many more wounded, and that now the troops\r\nwere here. And the more fiery ones among them were feeling only one\r\nthing now, that when you are hit you must hit back, you must show you\'re\r\nnot scared, you must show you\'re a man.\r\n\r\nAnd so on the next morning, no women and no children but huge, silent\r\nthrongs of men drifted out of the tenements down to the docks and moved\r\nslowly along the sentry lines.\r\n\r\nThe chance to show they were not afraid came late in the afternoon. The\r\nclear, sweet call of a bugle came floating gaily on the air, then the\r\nlong, hard roll of drums, and from their camp on the Farm the troops\r\ncame on the double-quick up along the waterfront. Now thousands of\r\nstrikers were running that way. From the foot of a city street across\r\nthe wide open space to a pier the militia formed in two double lines,\r\neach line facing outward. Then down that street came mounted police and\r\nbehind them a score of trucks loaded with freight.\r\n\r\nAt first I had hopes that the mass would not move. But out of the\r\nsilence came angry shouts and those behind pushed forward. Those in\r\nfront were pressed close up to the sharp lines of bayonets, were prodded\r\nsavagely by the troops. Militia youngsters but half trained, in two thin\r\nlines opposing what appeared to them a furious sea of faces, fists and\r\nangry cries--no wonder they were nervous. Bricks came flying from all\r\nsides and even heavy paving-stones, and then a few pistol shots out of\r\nthe mass. I saw a militia man drop on one knee and slowly topple over. I\r\nsaw an excited young officer shout at his men and wave his sword. I saw\r\nlong rows of guns make quick rhythmic movements, then level straight\r\nout, and there were two long flashes of fire.\r\n\r\nDisordered throngs were running now. Only a few men here and there\r\nturned to fire their pistols or to shout back frenzied, quivering oaths.\r\nBehind them a few soldiers were still shooting without orders. Near the\r\nsand-pile on which I stood I saw a young militia man enough like that\r\nlittle shoe-clerk to have been his brother. His face was white and his\r\neyes wild, he was panting, pumping his lever and blindly firing shot\r\nafter shot.\r\n\r\n"God damn \'em, slaughter \'em, slaughter \'em!"\r\n\r\nAn officer knocked up his gun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night the waterfront was still. Only the long, slow moving line of\r\nthe figures of sentries was to be seen. The troops were back in their\r\ncamp on the Farm. Bivouac fires were burning down there, but up here was\r\nonly a dark, empty space.\r\n\r\nHere scattered about on the pavement, after the firing had ceased, I had\r\nseen the dark inert bodies of men. Most of them had begun to move, until\r\nfully half were crawling about. They had been picked up and counted.\r\nThirty-nine wounded, fourteen dead. These, too, had all been taken away.\r\n\r\nFrom the high steel docksheds there came a deep, harsh murmur made up of\r\nfaint whistles, the rattle of winches, the shouts of the foremen, the\r\nheavy jar and crash of crates. A tug puffed smoothly into a slip with\r\nthree barges in her wake. I walked slowly out that way. The tugmen and\r\nthe bargemen talked in quiet voices as they made fast their craft to the\r\npier. Below them the water was lapping and slapping.\r\n\r\n"The world\'s work has been clogged up a little. It\'s to go on again\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day three heavy battleships steamed sluggishly through the\r\nNarrows and came to anchor in the bay. When interviewed by reporters,\r\ntheir commanders were vastly amused. No, they said, the United States\r\nNavy was not governed as to its movements by strikes. They simply\r\nhappened to be here through orders issued weeks ago. But their coming\r\nwas featured in headlines.\r\n\r\nI saw something else in the papers that night, a force greater than all\r\nbattleships. As a week before I had felt a whole country in revolt, I\r\nfelt now a country of law and order, a whole nation of angry tradesmen\r\nimpatiently demanding an end to all this "foreign anarchy."\r\n\r\n"We want no more of your strikes," it said. "None of your new crowd\r\nspirit, none of your wild talk and dreams! We want no change in this\r\ncountry of ours!"\r\n\r\nThe authorities obeyed this will. Bail was denied to Marsh, Vasca and\r\nJoe, and for them a speedy trial was urged. The press now held them\r\nresponsible not only for that first negro\'s death, but for all the\r\ndeaths since their arrest. Let them pay the full penalty! Let them be\r\nmade an example of! Let this business of anarchy be dealt with and\r\nsettled once and for all!\r\n\r\nThe work of crushing the strike went on. More troops were brought to the\r\nharbor. On the docks there were not only negroes now, thousands of\r\nimmigrant laborers were brought from Ellis Island and put to work at\r\ndouble pay, and on every incoming vessel the stokers were all kept on\r\nboard. Among the strikers there was a break that swiftly spread and\r\nbecame a stampede. And in the following week the work of the harbor went\r\non as before, with its regular commonplace weekly toll of a hundred\r\nkilled and injured. Peace had come again at last.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Saturday morning of that week I stood on the deck of a ferryboat\r\npacked with little commuters who waved and cheered a huge ocean liner\r\nbound for Europe. Lying deep in the water, her hold laden heavy with the\r\nproducts of this teeming land, her decks thronged with travelers with\r\nmoney in their pockets, her band playing, her flags streaming out, and\r\nover all on the captain\'s bridge the officers up there in command--she\r\nwas a mighty symbol of order and prosperity and of that Efficiency which\r\nto me had been a religion for so many years. We all followed the great\r\nship with our eyes as, gathering headway, she steamed out past the\r\nStatue of Liberty toward the battleships beyond.\r\n\r\n"Well," said an amused little man close by me, "I guess that\'ll be about\r\nall from the strikers."\r\n\r\n"Oh my smiling little citizen--you\'ve only seen the beginning," I\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nWhat were the strikers thinking now, and what would they be thinking\r\nsoon? They had wanted easier lives, they had wanted to feel themselves\r\npowers here. Caught up in the tide of democracy now sweeping all around\r\nthe earth, they had wanted to feel themselves running themselves in all\r\nthis work they were doing. So they had come out on strike and become a\r\ncrowd, and in the crowd they had suddenly found such strength as they\r\nnever dreamed could be theirs. And they would not easily forget. The\r\nharbor was already seeing to that, for already its work had gone on with\r\na rush, and all its heavy labor was weighing down upon them--"like a\r\nmillion tons of brick on their chests." I remembered what Joe Kramer had\r\nsaid: "It\'s got so they can\'t even breathe without thinking."\r\n\r\nWas the defeat of this one strike the end?\r\n\r\nThe grim battleships answered, "Yes, it is the end."\r\n\r\nBut the restless harbor answered, "No."\r\n\r\nWhat change was coming in my life? I did not know. Of one thing only I\r\nwas sure. The last of my gods, Efficiency, whose feet had stood firm on\r\nmechanical laws and in whose head were all the brains of all the big men\r\nat the top, had now come tottering crashing down. And in its place a\r\nhuge new god, whose feet stood deep in poverty and in whose head were\r\nall the dreams of all the toilers of the earth, had called to me with\r\none deep voice, with one tremendous burning passion for the freedom of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce I saw the harbor in a February storm. And in the wind and skurrying\r\nsnow I saw it all together like one whirling thing alive. But the next\r\nmorning the storm had died away, and a wind from the south had brought\r\nbanks of fog that moved sluggishly low down on the water dividing the\r\nwhole region into many separate parts. And from above, a dazzling sun\r\nshone down upon three objects near me, a ferryboat, a puffing tug, and a\r\ntramp which lay at anchor, shone so brightly on these three they seemed\r\nalone, with nothing but mist all about them.\r\n\r\nSo it was now for a time with me. The strike, which had so suddenly\r\ndrawn me into its whirling crowd-life, now as suddenly dropped away. And\r\npersonal troubles piled one on the other. In place of that mass of\r\nthousands, I saw only a few people I loved, and I saw them so intensely\r\nthat for a time we were quite alone, with nothing but mist all around\r\nus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSue sent for me one morning and I went over to our house. I was startled\r\nby the change in her face. It looked not only tired, it looked so\r\ndisillusioned, done, so through with all the absorbing ideas and warm\r\nenthusiasms that had given it abundant life.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to marry Joe Kramer," she said. "And I want you to tell\r\nhim so."\r\n\r\nI stared at her blankly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," I said.\r\n\r\n"Are you?" There was just a worn shadow of her old smile.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why I said that," I replied. "My head\'s rather dull this\r\nmorning. All right, Sis, I\'ll tell him." Still I watched her pityingly.\r\nPoor old Sue. What a crash in her life.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like you to tell him the whole truth," my sister went on sharply,\r\n"just why I\'ve decided as I have. Don\'t say it\'s because of father. When\r\nI wanted Joe, Dad didn\'t count, he was nothing to me but a back number.\r\nBut I _don\'t_ want him now--Joe, I mean--I don\'t love him any more. If I\r\nwent to him to-day in his cell and said I\'d stick by him no matter what\r\nhappened because he was the man I loved--I\'d be lying--that wouldn\'t be\r\nme. The real me is a much smaller person than that. I don\'t love Joe\r\nbecause I\'ve been scared--because he\'s in a common jail--waiting to be\r\ntried for murder." Her face contracted slightly. "I suppose it\'s the way\r\nI\'ve been brought up."\r\n\r\n"But Sue----"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stop me, Billy, let me talk!" And she talked on intensely, so\r\nabsorbed in this fierce impulsive confession that she seemed to forget I\r\nwas there. "I\'ve been thinking what\'s to become of me. I\'ve been\r\nthinking about all the things I\'ve been in, and none seem real any\r\nlonger--I wanted a thrill and I got it--that\'s all. Then I met Joe and I\r\ngot it again, I got a thrill out of all his life and the big things it\r\nwas made of. I got a _great_ thrill out of the strike. Don\'t you\r\nremember how I talked three weeks ago when you were here? Dad was the\r\nOld and I was the New. I saw everything beginning. I read Walt Whitman\'s\r\n\'Open Road\' and I felt like Joe\'s \'camarado.\' Well, and I kept on like\r\nthat. And like a little idiot I couldn\'t keep it to myself, I went and\r\ntold some of my friends. That\'s what\'s really the hardest now, what\r\nhurts the most--I told my friends. I posed as a young Joan of Arc. I\r\nwas going to marry, give up everything, chuck myself into this fight for\r\nthe people, into revolution! Thrills, I tell you, thrills and thrills!\r\n\r\n"But then Joe got arrested. I knew he was in a cell in the Tombs, in\r\nMurderers\' Row. And that drove all the thrills away. That was real. Dad\r\nmade it worse. He talked about the coming trial, Sing Sing and the death\r\nhouse there. One morning he tried to read to me an account of an\r\nexecution. I ran away, but I came back and read it myself, I read all\r\nthe hideous details right up to the iron chair. And just because there\r\nwas a chance of Joe\'s being like that, all at once I stopped loving him.\r\nNot just because I was frightened, it wasn\'t so simple as a scare. It\r\nwas something inside of me shuddering, and saying \'how revolting!\' I\r\ntried to shake it out of me, I tried to keep on loving him! But I\r\ncouldn\'t shake it out of me! Joe had become--revolting, too! It\'s\r\nbecause of the way I\'ve been brought up and because of the way I\'ve\r\nalways lived! I can\'t stand what\'s real--if it\'s ugly! That\'s me!"\r\n\r\nShe broke off and looked down. I came and sat beside her, and took her\r\ncold, quivering hands in mine:\r\n\r\n"I guess I _am_ sorry, Sue old girl----"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be," she retorted. "I\'m too sorry for myself as it is! That\'s\r\nanother part of me!" Again she broke off with a hard little laugh.\r\n"Let\'s forget me for a minute. What has this sweet strike done to\r\n_you_?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure yet," I answered. "Where is Dad?"\r\n\r\n"Up in his room."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about him," I said. Sue drew an anxious little breath:\r\n\r\n"Oh Billy, he has been getting so queer. It has all been such a strain\r\non his mind. Every day he kept reading the news of the strike--and some\r\ndays he would stamp and rage about till I was afraid to be with him. He\r\ntalked about that death cell until I thought that I\'d go mad. Sometimes\r\nwhen we were talking I thought that we had both gone mad."\r\n\r\nI went upstairs and found him in a chair by the window. With unnatural,\r\nclumsy motions he rose and came to meet me.\r\n\r\n"I\'m all right, my boy." His voice had a mumbling quality and I noticed\r\nthe strangeness in his eyes. "I\'m all right. I\'m glad to see you." Then\r\nhis face clouded and hardened a little, and he tried to speak to me\r\nsternly:\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you\'re clean out of that strike and its notions--glad you\'ve\r\ncome to your senses," he said. "You\'re lucky in having such a wife.\r\nShe\'s been over here often lately--and she\'s worth a dozen like you and\r\nSue. Have you seen Sue?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, _she\'s_ all right."\r\n\r\nI said nothing to this, and he shot a sidelong look at me:\r\n\r\n"I had quite a time, my boy--I had to keep right at her." Another quick\r\nlook. "I suppose she\'s told you how I went at her."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Dad, it\'s over now."\r\n\r\n"I had to make her feel the noose, I mean the chair," he went on in\r\nthose thick, mumbling tones, "and that she\'d have to choose between that\r\nand a decent Christian home--like the home her mother had. She was a\r\nwonderful woman, your mother," he wandered off abruptly. "If she\'d only\r\nunderstood me--seen what it was I was trying to do--for American\r\nshipping--Yankee sails!" He sank down in his chair exhausted, and I\r\nnoticed he was breathing hard. "I\'m all right, my boy, I\'m quite all\r\nright----"\r\n\r\nWith a sudden rush of pity and of love and deep alarm, I bent gently\r\nover him:\r\n\r\n"Of course you are--why Dad, old boy--just take it easy--quiet, you\r\nknow--we\'re going to pull right out of this----"\r\n\r\nThe tears welled suddenly up in his eyes:\r\n\r\n"I\'m lonely, boy--I\'m glad you\'re here!"\r\n\r\nPresently I went down to Sue:\r\n\r\n"When is the doctor coming next?"\r\n\r\n"Not till this afternoon," she said.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be home to-night for supper. Phone me what he says."\r\n\r\n"All right--where are you going now? To Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sis," I said.\r\n\r\nShe turned and went quickly out of the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Tombs, when Joe was brought out to me, I saw that he, too, had\r\nbeen through a deep change. He had been quiet enough all through the\r\nstrike, except for that one big speech of his--but he had been _tensely_\r\nquiet. Now the tension appeared to be gone. He seemed wrapped up in\r\nthoughts of his own.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Sue?" he asked me at once.\r\n\r\n"Yes Joe, I\'ve just been with her."\r\n\r\n"What did she say?"\r\n\r\nI began to tell him.\r\n\r\n"I knew it," he interrupted me. "I made up my mind to this the first\r\nnight I spent here in my cell. It couldn\'t have happened, it wouldn\'t\r\nhave worked. Tell her I understand all about it, tell her that I\'m sure\r\nshe\'s right. Tell her--it\'s funny but it\'s true--tell her this infernal\r\npen has worked the same way on me as on her. I mean it has made me not\r\nwant her now. I feel sorry for her and that\'s all--deeply and infernally\r\nsorry. I was a fool to have let her into it. My only excuse for being so\r\nblind was that damned fever that left me so weak. At any other time I\r\nwould have seen what a farce it was. I wasn\'t booked for a life like\r\nthat. It doesn\'t fit in with this job of mine." He smiled a little\r\nbitterly. "I used to say," he continued, "that if I had time I\'d like to\r\ndo something yellow enough so that I\'d be cut off for life from any\r\nchance of church bells. And I guess I\'ve done it this time--no danger\r\nof getting respectable now."\r\n\r\n"How do you look at this, Joe?" I asked him. "What do you think they\'ll\r\ndo to you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know." Again he smiled slightly and wearily. "And I can\'t say I\r\n_care_ a damn. I feel like those fellows over in Russia, the\r\nrevolutionist chaps I met, who didn\'t know if they\'d croak in a month\r\nand didn\'t care one way or the other. But as a matter of fact," he\r\nadded, "I think this time it\'s mainly bluff. They wanted to get us away\r\nfrom the crowd and keep us away while they broke the strike. Now that\r\nit\'s over you\'ll probably find they\'ll let us all off with light\r\nsentences. Of course the murder charge can\'t hold.... By the way," he\r\nadded, smiling, "I hear they got you, too."\r\n\r\n"Yes," I answered, smiling back. "The Judge fined me ten dollars and let\r\nme go. He said he hoped this would be a lesson."\r\n\r\nJoe looked at me curiously:\r\n\r\n"How much of a lesson, Kid, do you think this strike has been to you?"\r\n\r\n"Quite a big one, Joe," I said.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do about it?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t decided."\r\n\r\n"How is Eleanore taking it all?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s not saying much and neither am I. We\'re both doing some thinking\r\nbefore we talk."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a quiet pair," J. K. remarked. "I shouldn\'t wonder if you\'d nose\r\nalong quite a distance before you get through--I mean in our direction."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what we\'re thinking about," I replied. Again he turned to me\r\ncuriously:\r\n\r\n"You two can think together--without talking--can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--sometimes we can."\r\n\r\n"I never got that far with Sue." All at once he came closer, his whole\r\nmanner changed: "Say, Bill--tell her all I\'ve said--will you? I\'m\r\nsorry! Honest Injun! Make her feel how damnably sorry I am that I ever\r\nlet her in for this!"\r\n\r\nWhen I left him I went off for a walk, for I wanted to be alone awhile.\r\nI wondered just how sure Joe felt about his fast approaching trial. It\r\nseemed to me that he had a good chance of going where Sue had pictured\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening I learned that my father was worse, and I spent the next\r\nday by his bedside. He had had a stroke in the morning and was not\r\nexpected to live through the night.\r\n\r\nI found him mumbling fast to himself and making slight, restless efforts\r\nto move. At last he grew quiet, and presently his half-open gnarled\r\nright hand came groping out over the covers. I took it in mine, and at\r\nonce I felt it close on mine with a quick, convulsive strength. His hand\r\nwas moist, his eyes saw nothing. I sat there thus for a long time. Then\r\nsuddenly,\r\n\r\n"Good boy," he muttered thickly. "Good boy--good--always good to your\r\nmother!" He kept repeating this over and over, with pauses between, then\r\nagain with an effort, fiercely, as though from a distance his mind were\r\nset on getting this message over to me, over from an age that was dying\r\ninto an age that was coming to life, a last good-by to hold me back.\r\n\r\nSoon he was only mumbling figures, names of ships and distant ports,\r\nfreight consignments. Now and then his finger would go to his lips, as\r\nhe turned phantom pages in feverish haste. Again, in gasping whispers,\r\nhe would break out into arguments for the protection of Yankee sails.\r\n\r\n"Protection!" he would whisper. "Damn fools not to see it!\r\nDiscriminating tariffs! Subsidies! A Navy!... Don\'t forget the Navy!\r\nRemember War of 1812!... Nothing without fighting!"\r\n\r\n"Nothing without fighting." He had been learning this all his life--and\r\nafter he had said it now, he stopped speaking and grew still. Little by\r\nlittle his movements grew weaker. Finally he lay like a log, and the\r\ndoctor said he would be so until dead.\r\n\r\nI went up to my old bedroom and sat down by the open window. It was a\r\nbeautiful night. From the garden below, where long ago I had felt such\r\nshivers over the ocean and heathen lands, a graceful poplar rose. Behind\r\nit from the river the huge, dim funnel of a steamer rose over the roof\r\nof the warehouse. Overhead to the right swept the Great Bridge of my\r\nchildhood. But behind it were other bridges now, and off across the\r\nriver the buildings of Manhattan loomed in loftier masses to their apex\r\nin the tower of lights. How changed it all was since I was a boy. And\r\nyet how like. On the harbor still the hurrying lights, yellow, blue and\r\ngreen and red. The same deep, restless hum of labor. And from the\r\nwaterfront below the same puffs and coughs of engines, the same sharp\r\ntoots and treble pantings, the same raucous whine of wheels.\r\n\r\nThere came a rough salt breeze from the sea, and it made me think of\r\nbillowy sails and the days of my father\'s boundless youth, and of the\r\nharbor of long ago that had so gripped and molded him--as I felt mine\r\nnow molding me. And for what? I asked. To what were we both\r\nadventuring--out of these little harbors of ours?\r\n\r\nToward dawn a tramp came down the river. Dimly as she passed below I\r\ncould see how old she was, how worn and battered by the waves. A\r\ndesolate and lonely craft, the smoke draggled out of her funnel. I\r\nwatched her steam into the Upper Bay and pass around Governor\'s Island.\r\nI watched till in the first raw light of day I could see only her smoke\r\nthrough the Narrows. Then even this became but a blur, which crept away\r\nin that strange dawn light out into the wide ocean.\r\n\r\nA few hours later my father died.\r\n\r\nOne by one, from different parts of the port, the queerest old men came\r\ninto our house on the day of my father\'s funeral--men who still\r\nbelieved in American ships, still thrilled to the dream of the Stars and\r\nStripes wherever there is an ocean breeze; men who still believed in\r\nships that had sails and moved along with the force of the winds; who\r\nstill believed that cabin boys could rise by the sheer force of their\r\nwills to be powers in the ocean world; men who had for the common crowd\r\nonly the iron discipline, the old brute tyranny of the sea. These\r\nstrange old men stood with their white heads bowed, a little group,\r\nlooking down into my father\'s grave.\r\n\r\n"He was a magnificent fighter," I heard one of them say as we left. "He\r\nwrecked his own business for what he believed in. How many of us would\r\ngo that far?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the grave Sue came to our apartment. Eleanore had packed her trunk.\r\n\r\n"Sue must keep out of that dreary old house," she told me. "Luckily she\r\nhas a friend out of town whom she\'s going to visit. When she comes back\r\nwe must have the house closed, and I hope she\'ll live with us for a\r\nwhile."\r\n\r\nWe talked of this that evening, for Sue seemed to want to talk. We\r\nstayed up until late and planned and planned. Many different kinds of\r\nwork for Sue were taken up and discussed by us all. She surprised me by\r\nthe brave effort she made.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to want something--that\'s sure," she said. "I can\'t just yet.\r\nI\'ve wanted so many things so hard, one after the other for nearly eight\r\nyears, that now I feel as though I\'d used up all the wanting that I\'ve\r\ngot. But of course I haven\'t. If I have I\'m a back number--and I\'d a\r\ngreat deal rather be dead. So don\'t you people worry. Depend upon it, in\r\nless than a year I\'ll be all wrapped up in something new. I\'ll be\r\ntremendously enthused," she ended, smiling wearily.\r\n\r\nShe agreed with me that the house be sold, and after she had left us I\r\nmade every effort to sell it at once. I found it was heavily mortgaged\r\nnow, but when at last I made a sale there was enough to clear off all\r\ndebts and leave about two thousand dollars for Sue. She would have at\r\nleast something to start on.\r\n\r\nAs we set about to dismantle the house, various things thickly covered\r\nwith dust came out of closets, drawers and shelves. And these objects\r\nbrought near again to me my mother\'s life and that hunger of hers for\r\nthe things that were "fine," that hospitable door which had waited for\r\nfriends from the handsome old homes all around us. These homes all along\r\nthe street had now lost their quiet dignity. Some were empty and marked\r\nfor sale, others that had already been sold were cheerless boarding\r\nhouses. The most handsome home of all, with its ample yard where I used\r\nto play, was gone, and in its place rose an apartment building which\r\nmade the old houses all seem dwarfs.\r\n\r\nHer world and his were both slipping away. Her life and his, her creed\r\nand his, were little now but memories--memories which in Sue and in me\r\nmust take their chance with the warm, new feelings, the cravings, hopes,\r\nloves, doubts and dreams of this absorbing world of our own. For the\r\nharbor was still molding lives.\r\n\r\nHow anxious Eleanore seemed to be through, I thought a little\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Eleanore had good reason. When at last the house had been closed,\r\nback at home one evening she told me what she had known for weeks but\r\nhad kept to herself until I should be free from other things. We were to\r\nhave another child.\r\n\r\nThe news was a shock, it frightened me. "Where\'s the money to come\r\nfrom?" flashed into my mind. In an instant it had passed and I was\r\nholding her tight in my arms. But she must have caught that look in my\r\nface, for I could feel her trembling.\r\n\r\n"The same funny old world, my dearest one," she whispered, "with its\r\nsame old trick of starting out. But oh my dear, in spite of it all--or\r\nbecause of it all--how good it is to be alive! More than ever--a hundred\r\ntimes!"\r\n\r\n"You darling girl," I whispered back, "you\'re the bravest one of all!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHer father came to us the next night, and after Eleanore went to bed he\r\nand I talked long together. He looked worn and tired, but the same quiet\r\naffection was in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see where we are," he said, "and what we\'ve got to go on. To\r\nbegin with, thank God, you and I are still friends. Then there\'s\r\nEleanore and your small son and the smaller one that\'s coming. We\'re\r\njust starting in on a long, hot summer. She must of course be got out of\r\ntown. How much have you in the bank?"\r\n\r\n"Thirty-seven dollars," I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked thoughtfully at his cigar.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve never yet taken money from me," he continued, after a moment.\r\n"Still, you\'d do it if you had to--because this is _our_ affair. But\r\nunluckily, just at present, I\'m nearly as high and dry as yourself. The\r\nmen who have backed my harbor work have lost so heavily in the strike\r\nthat they feel now they must recoup. I\'ve already proposed to them a\r\nplan which they have as good as accepted. They\'ll provide enough money\r\nto pay the rent of a smaller office. I can borrow enough to pay half my\r\nmen. The rest I\'ll have to let go for a time."\r\n\r\n"And _your_ salary?" I ventured.\r\n\r\n"Is left out," he answered. "I mean it is if I stay here. I want to stay\r\nhere, I want to put through this job if I can, you see it has taken six\r\nyears of my life. And besides," he added wistfully, "in a very few weeks\r\nthey\'ll finish the work at Panama--and the ships of the world will begin\r\nto crowd into a harbor that isn\'t ready here--we haven\'t even completed\r\nour plans. It\'s not a good time to stop our work. But of course if you\r\nand Eleanore get into a hole that is serious--as I said before and\r\nyou\'ll agree, you\'d have to let me help you--even if to do it I should\r\nhave to give up my work for a while and take up something that will\r\npay."\r\n\r\n"No sir!"\r\n\r\n"Yes sir," he replied. "Unless you can earn enough money yourself."\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other a moment.\r\n\r\n"You know how to bring pressure, don\'t you?" I said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m bringing pressure. I want to see you go on as before."\r\n\r\n"That won\'t be easy," I remarked.\r\n\r\n"Shall we talk it over a little?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"All right," he said. "Since that talk we had together the day\r\nEleanore\'s first child was born, what a splendid start you made in your\r\nwriting. You were not only earning big pay, you were doing fine work,\r\nwork that was leading somewhere. I could see you learning to use your\r\ntools, getting a broad, sane view of life--and of yourself--training\r\nyourself and building yourself. You were right on the threshold of big\r\nresults. But then your friend Kramer came along. He had not built\r\nhimself, he had chucked himself over, neglected himself, his health\r\nincluded. So he took typhoid and came to your home. His being there was\r\na drain on your pocket and a heavy strain on your nerves. He got you\r\nunsettled. Then came the strike. And what has it done? It has taken your\r\ntime, health, money. It has left two good workmen stranded--you and me.\r\nAnd I don\'t see that it\'s done the crowd any good. What has the strike\r\ngiven you in return for all it has taken away?"\r\n\r\n"A deeper view of life," I said. "I saw something in that strike so much\r\nbigger than Marsh or Joe or that crude organization of theirs--something\r\ndeep down in the people themselves that rises up out of each one of them\r\nthe minute they get together. And I believe that power has such\r\npossibilities that when it comes into full life not all the police and\r\nbattleships and armies on earth can stop it."\r\n\r\nThe look in Dillon\'s eyes was more anxious than impatient.\r\n\r\n"Billy," he said, "I\'ve lived a good deal closer than you have to the\r\nbig jobs of this world. And I know those jobs are to get still bigger,\r\neven more complex. They\'re to require even bigger men." I smiled a bit\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n"Still the one man in a million," I said.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Dillon, "his day isn\'t over, it has only just begun. He may\r\nhave his bad points--I\'ll admit he has--but compared to all the little\r\nmen his vision is wide and it goes deep. And if they\'ll only leave him\r\nalone and give him a chance, he\'ll take me and the other engineers, and\r\nthe chemists and doctors and lawyers, and he\'ll make a world--he\'s doing\r\nit now--where ignorance and poverty will in time be wiped completely\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"They\'re not going to leave him alone," I said. "I\'m sure of that now.\r\nWhether he grafts or whether he\'s honest won\'t make any difference. The\r\ncrowd is going to pull him down. Because it\'s not democracy. The trouble\r\nwith all your big men at the top is that they\'re trying to do for the\r\ncrowd what the crowd wants to do for itself. And it may not do it half\r\nso well--but all the time it will be learning--gathering closer every\r\nyear--and getting a spirit compared to which your whole clean clear\r\nefficiency world is only cold and empty!"\r\n\r\nHe must have caught the look in my eyes.\r\n\r\n"You\'re thinking that I\'m getting old," he said softly. "I and all the\r\nmen like me who have been building up this country. You\'re thinking that\r\nwe\'re all following on after your father into the past." As I looked\r\nback I felt suddenly humble. Dillon\'s voice grew appealing and kind.\r\n"But you belong with us, Billy," he said. "It was under us you won your\r\nstart. And what I want now," he added, "is not only for Eleanore\'s sake,\r\nbut your own. I want you to try to write again about all the work we are\r\ndoing and see what it will do for you. Why not give it another chance?\r\nYou\'re not afraid of it, are you?"\r\n\r\n"No," I said, "I\'m not afraid--and I\'ll give it another chance if you\r\nlike--I don\'t want to be narrow about it, God knows. But before I tackle\r\nanything else I\'ll finish my story of the strike."\r\n\r\n"All right," he agreed. "That\'s all I ask. Now suppose you take Eleanore\r\nup to the mountains and write your strike article up there. Let me loan\r\nyou a little just at the start."\r\n\r\n"How much money have _you_ in the bank?"\r\n\r\n"Enough to send Eleanore where she belongs."\r\n\r\n"Eleanore belongs right here," said a voice from the other room, and\r\npresently Eleanore appeared. She surveyed us both with a scorn in her\r\neyes that made us quake a little. "I never heard," she went on calmly,\r\n"of anything quite so idiotic. Go home, Dad, and go to bed, and please\r\ndrop this insane idea that I\'m afraid of July in New York, or of August\r\nor September. Do you know what you\'re going to do to-morrow, both of you\r\npoor foolish boys? You\'re going sensibly to work and worry about nothing\r\nat all. And to-morrow night we\'re all three of us going to forget how it\r\nfeels to work or think, and get on an open trolley and go down and hear\r\nHarry Lauder. Thank Heaven he happens to be in town. To hear you talk\r\nyou\'d think the whole American people had forgotten how to laugh.\r\n\r\n"Now Billy," she ended smoothly, "go to the icebox and get two bottles\r\nof nice cool beer--and make me a tall glass of lemonade. And don\'t use\r\ntoo much sugar."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day and the next evening Eleanore\'s program was carried out.\r\nBut after that night the laughing stopped. For Joe Kramer was coming to\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nI had not seen Joe for over two weeks, and I had taken his view of his\r\ncase, that there was no serious danger. But now I learned from a good\r\nsource that Joe and both his colleagues were to be brought to trial at\r\nonce, while the public feeling was still hot against them. As the time\r\nof the trials drew near every paper in town took up the cry. Let these\r\nmen be settled once and for all, they demanded. Let them not be set free\r\nfor other strikes, for wholesale murder and pillage. Let them pay the\r\nfull penalty for their crimes!\r\n\r\nIn the face of this storm, I found myself on Joe\'s defense committee,\r\nthe best part of my time each day and evening taken up with raising\r\nmoney, helping to find witnesses and doing the press work for parades\r\nand big mass meetings of labor.\r\n\r\nThrough this work, in odd hours, I finished my story of the strike. It\r\nall came back to me vividly now and I tried to tell what I had seen. I\r\ntook it to my editor.\r\n\r\n"Print that?" he said when he\'d read it. "You\'re mad."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the truth," I remarked.\r\n\r\n"As you see it," he said. "And you\'ve seen it only from one side. If\r\nthis story had been written and signed by Marsh or your friend Kramer,\r\nwe might have run it, with a reply from the companies. But I don\'t want\r\nto see _you_ stand for this--in our magazine or anywhere else--it means\r\ntoo much to you as a writer. Look out, my boy," he added, with a\r\nreturn to the old brusque kindliness which he had always shown me in the\r\nyears I had worked under him. "We think a lot of you in this office. For\r\nGod\'s sake don\'t lose your head. Don\'t be one more good reporter\r\nspoiled."\r\n\r\nI took my story of the strike to every editor I knew, and it was\r\nrejected by each in turn. They thought it all on the side of the crowd,\r\nan open plea for revolution. Then I took it to Joe in the Tombs.\r\n\r\n"Will you sign this, Joe?" I asked, when he had read it.\r\n\r\n"No," he replied. "It\'s too damn mild. You\'ve given too much to the\r\nother side. All these bouquets to efficiency and all this about the weak\r\npoints of the crowd. The average stoker reading this would think that\r\nthe revolution won\'t come till we are all white-haired."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it will," I said.\r\n\r\n"I know you don\'t. That\'s why you\'re no good to us," he said. "We want\r\nour stuff written by men who are sure that a big revolution is just\r\nahead, men who are certain that a strike, to take in half the civilized\r\nworld, is coming in the next ten years."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe that."\r\n\r\n"I know. You can\'t. You\'re still too soaked in the point of view of your\r\nefficiency father-in-law."\r\n\r\n"So you don\'t feel you can sign this?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nThat day I sent my story to a small magazine in New England, which from\r\nthe time of the Civil War had retained its traditions of breadth of\r\nview. Within a week the editor wrote that he would be glad to publish\r\nit. "Our modest honorarium will follow shortly," he said at the end. The\r\nmodest honorarium did. Meanwhile I had sent him a sketch of Nora Ganey\r\nwhich I had written just after the strike. I received a letter equally\r\nkind, and another honorarium. I began to see a future of modest\r\nhonoraria.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, to meet our expenses at home, I had borrowed money and\r\ngiven my note. And the note would soon fall due. Those were far from\r\npleasant days. On the one side Joe in his cell waiting to be tried for\r\nhis life; on the other, Eleanore at home waiting for a new life to be\r\nborn. By a lucky chance for me, Joe\'s trial was again postponed, so I\r\ncould return to my own affairs. I had to have some money quick. I went\r\nback to my magazine editor and asked for a job in his office.\r\n\r\n"I\'m ready now to be sane," I said.\r\n\r\n"Glad to hear it," he replied. "I\'ll give you a steady routine job where\r\nyou can grind till you get yourself right."\r\n\r\n"Till I get back where I was, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you can," he answered.\r\n\r\nI went for a walk that afternoon to think over the proposition he\'d\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n"I have seen three harbors," I said to myself. "My father\'s harbor which\r\nis now dead, Dillon\'s harbor of big companies which is very much alive,\r\nand Joe Kramer\'s harbor which is struggling to be born. It\'s an\r\ninteresting age to live in. I should like to write the truth as I see it\r\nabout each kind of harbor. But I need the money--my wife is going to\r\nhave a child. So I\'ll take that steady position and try to grind part of\r\nthe truth away."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"What have you been doing?" Eleanore asked when I came home. "You look\r\nlike a ghost."\r\n\r\n"Not at all," I replied. "I\'ve been getting a job."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about it."\r\n\r\nI told her part. She went and got her sewing, and settled herself\r\ncomfortably for a quiet evening\'s work. Eleanore loved baby clothes.\r\n\r\n"Now begin again and tell me all," she ordered. And she persisted until\r\nI did.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t do," she said, when I had finished.\r\n\r\n"It will do," I replied decidedly. "It\'s the best thing in sight. It\r\nwill see us through till the baby is born. After all, it\'s only for a\r\nyear."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a mighty important year for you, my love," said Eleanore. She\r\nthoughtfully held up and surveyed a tiny infant\'s nightgown. "If you do\r\nthis you\'ll be giving up. It\'s not writing your best. It\'s giving up\r\nwhat you think is the truth. And that\'s a bad habit to get into."\r\n\r\n"It\'s settled now. Please leave it alone."\r\n\r\n"Oh very well," she said placidly. "Let\'s talk of what I\'ve been doing."\r\n\r\n"What _you\'ve_ been doing?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely. I\'ve taken a little apartment downtown, over by the river.\r\nThe rent is twenty-eight dollars a month. It\'s on the top floor and has\r\nplenty of air, and there\'s a nice roof for hot summer evenings. You\'re\r\nto carry two wicker chairs up there each night after supper."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do nothing of the kind," I rejoined indignantly. "You\'re going to\r\npack up at once and go to the mountains! And when you come back you\'re\r\ncoming right here!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no I\'m not," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be an idiot, Eleanore! Think of moving out of here now! In your\r\ncondition!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s better than moving out of your work. Dad has kept right on with\r\nhis, even when they stopped his pay. Well, now they\'ve stopped your pay,\r\nthat\'s all, and we\'ve got to do the best we can. We\'ve simply got to\r\nlive for a while on modest honorariums. Now don\'t talk, wait till I get\r\nthrough. You\'ve got to work harder than ever before but for much less\r\nmoney. But with less money than before we\'re going to be happier than\r\nwe\'ve ever been in all our lives. And you can\'t do a thing to stop it.\r\nIf you do take that office work and bring a lot of money home, do you\r\nknow what I\'ll do? I\'ll move to that little flat just the same, and all\r\nthe extra money you bring will go to Mrs. Bealey."\r\n\r\n"Who in God\'s name is Mrs. Bealey?"\r\n\r\n"One of my oldest charity cases. She was here this afternoon. The\r\ntrouble with you is, my dear," my wife continued smoothly, "that you\'ve\r\nbeen so wrapped up in your own little changes you haven\'t given a\r\nthought to mine. Well, I\'ve done some changing, too. Every time that Sue\r\nor you have taken up a new idea I\'ve taken up a Mrs. Bealey. I did the\r\nsame thing in the strike. I went with Nora Ganey into the very poorest\r\nof all the tenements down by the docks. I saw the very worst of it\r\nall--and I tried to do what I could to help. But I felt like a drop in\r\nthe ocean. And that\'s how I\'ve changed. Things are so wrong in the\r\ntenements that big reforms are needed. I don\'t know what they are and\r\nI\'m not sure anyone else does. But I\'m sure that if any reforms worth\r\nwhile are to be made, we\'ve got to see just where we are. And that means\r\nthat quite a number of people--you for instance--have got to tell the\r\ntruth exactly as they see it. So I\'d rather put our money in that and\r\nlet old Mrs. Bealey forget our address. That\'s another reason for\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing noble about it at all," she said as she threaded her\r\nneedle. "I mean to be perfectly comfortable. I saw this coming long ago,\r\nand since the strike was over I\'ve spent weeks picking out a nice place\r\nwhere we can get the most for our money. About thirty thousand babies,\r\nI\'m told, are to be born in the city this summer--and their mothers\r\naren\'t going first to the mountains or even for a walk in the Park. I\r\ndon\'t see why I shouldn\'t be one. As a matter of fact I won\'t be one, my\r\nbaby won\'t be born until Fall, and I\'ll have a clean, comfortable flat\r\nwith one maid instead of a dirty tenement with all the cooking and\r\nwashing to do. You\'ll probably find magazines who\'ll pay enough\r\nhonorariums to make a hundred dollars a month, which is just about three\r\ntimes as much as Mrs. Bealey lives on. So that\'s settled and we move\r\nthis week."\r\n\r\nWe moved that week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nOne night about a month later, when we had ensconced ourselves for the\r\nevening out on the roof of our new home, where the summer\'s night was\r\ncooled by a slight breeze from the river, our maid came up and told me\r\nthere was a strange gentleman below. I went down and brought him up, I\r\nwas deeply pleased and excited. For he was the English novelist whom I\r\nmost admired these days. He had come to me during the strike and had\r\nbeen deeply interested in the great crowd spirit I had found. He was\r\ngoing back to England now.\r\n\r\n"I\'m curious," he told me, "to see how much your striker friends have\r\nkept of what they got in the strike--what new ideas and points of view.\r\nHow much are they really changed? That, I should think, is by far the\r\nmost valuable part of it all."\r\n\r\n"It\'s just what I\'ve been trying to find out for myself," I replied.\r\n\r\n"Really? Will you tell me?"\r\n\r\nI told him how on docks, on tugs and barges, in barrooms and in\r\ntenements, I was having talks with various types of men who had been\r\nstrikers, how I was finding some dull and hopeless, others bitter, but\r\nmore who simply felt that they had bungled this first attempt and were\r\nalready looking forward to more and greater struggles. The socialists\r\namong them were already hard at work, urging them to carry their strike\r\non into the political field, vote together in one solid mass and build\r\nup a government all their own. Through this ceaseless ferment I had gone\r\nin search of significant characters, incidents, new points of view. I\r\nwas writing brief sketches of it all.\r\n\r\n"How did you feel about all this," the Englishman asked, "before you\r\nwere drawn into the strike?" And turning from me to Eleanore, "And you?"\r\nhe added.\r\n\r\nGradually he got the stories of our lives. I told how all my life I had\r\nbeen raising up gods to worship, and how the harbor had flowed silently\r\nin beneath, undermining each one and bringing it down.\r\n\r\n"It seems to have such a habit of changing," I ended, "that it won\'t let\r\na fellow stop."\r\n\r\n"Lucky people," he answered, smiling, "to have found that out so\r\nsoon--to have had all this modern life condensed so cozily into your\r\nharbor before your eyes--and to have discovered, while you are still\r\nyoung, that life is growth and growth is change. I believe the age we\r\nlive in is changing so much faster than any age before it, that a man if\r\nhe\'s to be vital at all must give up the idea of any fixed creed--in his\r\noffice, his church or his home--that if he does not, he will only wear\r\nhimself out butting his indignant head against what is stronger and\r\nprobably better than he. But if he does, if he holds himself open to\r\nchange and knows that change is his very life, then he can get a\r\nserenity which is as much better than that of the monk as living is\r\nbetter than dying."\r\n\r\nWe talked of books being written in England and France, in Germany and\r\nRussia, all dealing with deep changes in the views and beliefs and\r\ndesires of men.\r\n\r\n"Any man," he said, "who thinks that modern Europe will go smoothly,\r\nquietly on, needs a dose of your harbor to open his eyes."\r\n\r\nHe turned to me with a sudden thought.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you write a book," he asked, "about this harbor you have\r\nknown!"\r\n\r\nEleanore made a quick move in her chair.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what you ought to do!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if I could," I said. "It would be hard to see it now, as it\r\nlooked at all the different times."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll hardly be able to do that," the Englishman answered quietly.\r\n"Because to each one of us, I suppose, not only his present but his past\r\nis constantly changing to his view. But I wouldn\'t let that bother you.\r\nWhat would interest me as a reader would be your view of your life as\r\nyou look back upon it to-day--in this present stage of your growth.\r\n\r\n"I was raised in the Alps myself," he went on. "So _my_ picture of life\r\nis the mountain path. As I climb and turn now and then to look back, the\r\ntwisting little path below appears quite different each time. But still\r\nI keep on writing--my changing view of the slope behind and of the\r\nrising peaks ahead. And now and then by working my hardest I\'ve felt the\r\ngreat joy of writing the truth. As you know, it isn\'t easy. But year by\r\nyear I\'ve felt my readers grow in number. I believe they are going to\r\ngrow and grow, not mine nor yours but the readers of all the chaps like\r\nourselves, the readers who pick up each new book with the hope that one\r\nmore fellow has done his best--not to please them but to please\r\nhimself--by telling of life as he has seen it--his changing life through\r\nhis changing eyes."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter he left us there was a long silence. Both of us were thinking\r\nhard. And as Eleanore looked up to the stars I saw their brightness in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said at last, "I\'m sure. I\'m sure you\'d better take his\r\nadvice--and write as truthfully as you can the whole story as you see it\r\nnow--of this strange harbor you have known."\r\n\r\nWe talked long and eagerly that night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nI began my story of the harbor. Every hour that I could spare from the\r\nstories and sketches of tenement life by which I made a scant living\r\nthose days, I spent in gathering memories of my long struggle with this\r\nplace, arranging and selecting and setting them in order for this record\r\nof the great life I had seen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut this wide world has many such lives, many heaving forces. And ever\r\nsince I had been born, while I had been building for myself one after\r\nthe other these gods of civilization and peace--all unheeded by my eyes\r\na black shadow had been silently creeping over the whole ocean world.\r\nNow from across the water there came the first low grumble of war.\r\nWithin one short portentous week that grumble had become a roar, and\r\nbefore all the startled peoples had time to realize what was here, vast\r\narmies were being rushed over the lands, all Europe was in chaos--and\r\nthe world was on the eve of the most prodigious change of all.\r\n\r\nAnd like the mirror of the world that it had always been to me, the\r\nharbor at once reflected this change. Only a little time before, I had\r\nseen it almost empty, except for that crude boat of the crowd; the\r\n_Internationale_, with its songs of brotherhood and of a world where\r\nwars should cease. Now I saw it jammed with ships from whose masts flew\r\nevery flag on the seas, and from the men who came ashore I heard of how\r\nthey had been chased, some fired upon, by battleships--I heard of war\r\nupon the seas. I felt my father\'s world reborn, an ocean world where\r\nthere was nothing without fighting, and where every nation fought.\r\nOurs had already entered the lists, with a loud clamor for ships of our\r\nown in which to seize this sudden chance for our share of the trade of\r\nthe world. The great canal was open at last, and Europe in her turmoil\r\nhad had not even a moment to look. The East and South lay open to\r\nus--rush in and get our share at last! Make our nation strong at sea!\r\n\r\nAnd while in blind confusion I groped for some new footing here, strove\r\nto see what it was going to mean to that fair world of brotherhood which\r\nI had seen struggling to be born--suddenly as though in reply there came\r\na sharp voice out of the crowd.\r\n\r\nJoe Kramer came to trial for his life. Before his case went to the jury,\r\nJoe rose up and addressed them. And he spoke of war and violence. He\r\nspoke of how in times of peace this present system murders men--on ships\r\nand docks and railroads, in the mills and down in the mines. And as\r\nthough these lives were not enough, the powers above in this scramble\r\nfor theirs for all the profits in the world, all the sweated labor they\r\ncould wring out of humankind, had now flown at each others\' throats. And\r\nthe blood of the common people was pouring out upon the earth.\r\n\r\n"My comrades over the water," he said, "saw this coming years ago. They\r\nworked day and night to gather the workers of Europe together against\r\nthis war that will blacken the world. For that they were called\r\nanti-patriots, fiends, men without a country. And some were imprisoned\r\nand others were shot. And over here--where in times of peace the number\r\nof killed and wounded is over five hundred thousand a year--for\r\nrebelling against this murder they have called me murderer--and have\r\nplaced me here on trial for my life.\r\n\r\n"And what I want to ask you now is that you take no halfway course.\r\nEither send me out of this dock a free man or up the river to the chair.\r\nFor this is no year for compromise. Am I a murderer? Yes or no. Decide\r\nwith your eyes wide open. If you set me free I shall still rebel. I\r\nshall join my comrades over the sea who already are going about in the\r\ncamps and saying to the rank and file--\'You can stop this slaughter! You\r\ncan save this world gone mad! You can end this murder--both in time of\r\nwar and peace!\'"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd the jury set Joe free.\r\n\r\nEarly in the following week I went down to his room by the docks for a\r\nlast evening with him there. Joe was sailing that same night. Under a\r\nname not his own he had taken passage in the steerage of the big fast\r\nliner which was to sail at one o\'clock. Into his room all evening poured\r\nhis revolutionist friends, and the chance of revolution abroad was\r\ntalked of in cool practical terms. Nothing could be done, they said, in\r\nthe first few months to stop this war. Years ago the man in France, who\r\nhad led the anti-war movement, had predicted that if war broke out every\r\ngovernment rushing in would force on its people the belief that this was\r\nno war of aggression but one of defense of the fatherland from a fierce\r\nonrushing foe. And so in truth it had come about, and against that\r\nappeal to fight for their homes no voice of reason could stem the tide.\r\n\r\nThe socialists had been swept on with the rest. By tens and hundreds of\r\nthousands they had already gone to the front. But it was upon this very\r\nfact that Joe and his friends now rested their hopes. For just so soon\r\nas in the camps the first burst of enthusiasm had begun to die away, as\r\nthe millions in the armies began to grow sick of the sight of blood, the\r\ngroans and the shrieks of the wounded and dying, the stench of the\r\ndead--and themselves weary of fighting, worn by privation and disease,\r\nbegan to think of their distant homes, their wives and children starving\r\nthere--then these socialists in their midst, one at every bivouack fire,\r\nwould begin to ask them:\r\n\r\n"Why is it that we are at war? What good is all this blood to us? Is it\r\nto make our toil any lighter, life any brighter in our homes--or were we\r\nsent out by our rulers to die only in order that they in their scramble\r\nmight take more of the earth for themselves? And if this is true why not\r\nrise like men and end this fearful carnage?"\r\n\r\nAlready these thousands were in the camps. Into Joe\'s room that evening\r\ncame men to give him the names and regiments of those comrades he could\r\ntrust. Joe with a few hundred others was to make his dangerous way into\r\nthe camps and the barracks, wherever that was possible, of French and\r\nRussians and Germans alike, to carry news from one to the other, to make\r\nready and to plan.\r\n\r\nNow and then, in the talk that night, I felt the thrilling presence of\r\nthat rising god, that giant spirit of the crowd, not dead but only\r\nsleeping now to gain new strength for what it must do. And again in\r\ngleams and flashes I saw the vision of the end--the world for all the\r\nworkers. For in this crowded tenement room, forgotten now by\r\ngovernments, this rough earnest group of men seemed so sure of this\r\nworld of theirs, so sure that it was now soon to be born.\r\n\r\nOne by one they went away, and Joe and I were left alone. Slowly he\r\nrefilled his pipe. I thought of the talks we had had in ten years.\r\n\r\n"Well Bill," he inquired at last, "what are you going to do with\r\nyourself?"\r\n\r\n"Write what I see in the crowd," I said, "from my new point of\r\nview--this year\'s point of view," I added. I went on to tell him what\r\nthe English writer had said. And I told of my book on the harbor.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Joe when I was through, "I guess it\'s about the best you\r\ncan do. You\'ve got a wife to think of."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know her," I rejoined, and I told him how she had changed our\r\nhome in order not to stop my work.\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you see what she\'s up to?" said Joe.\r\n\r\n"What the devil do you mean?" I asked indignantly. Joe blew a pitying\r\npuff of smoke.\r\n\r\n"You poor blind dub of a husband," he said with his old affectionate\r\nsmile, "she\'s making you love her all the more. You\'re anchored worse\r\nthan ever. _You_ can\'t go over to Europe and take a chance at being\r\nshot. Don\'t you see the hole you\'re in? You\'ve got to care what happens\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure of that, Joe," I said. "Things in this world are\r\nchanging so fast that it\'s hard for any man in it to tell where he\'ll be\r\nin a year from now--or even a few short months from now. It\'s the year\r\nthat no man can see beyond."\r\n\r\n"You mean you\'re coming over?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure. Just now I\'m going to finish this book. I\'m going to see\r\nEleanore through till the baby is born. But after that--if over in\r\nEurope the people rise against this war--I don\'t just see how I can keep\r\nout."\r\n\r\nJoe looked at me queerly. And with a curious gruffness,\r\n\r\n"I hope you will keep out," he said. "There aren\'t many women like your\r\nwife."\r\n\r\nHe pulled an old grip from under his bed and began throwing in a few\r\nbooks and clothes. From a drawer he swept a few colored shirts, some\r\nunderclothes and a small revolver.\r\n\r\n"J. K.," I said, "I\'ve been thinking about us. And I think our youth is\r\ngone."\r\n\r\n"What\'s youth?" asked Joe indifferently.\r\n\r\n"Youth," I replied, "is the time when you can think anything, feel\r\nanything and go anywhere."\r\n\r\n"I\'m still going anywhere," he remarked.\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t think anything," I rejoined. "You say I\'m tied to a wife\r\nand home. All right, I\'m glad I am. But you\'re tied, too. You\'re tied to\r\na creed, Mister Syndicalist--a creed so stiff that you can\'t think of\r\nanything else."\r\n\r\n"All right, I\'m glad I am," he echoed. "I\'m sorry youth lasted as long\r\nas it did."\r\n\r\nHe closed his grip and strapped it. Then he took up his hat and coat and\r\nthrew a last look about the room where he had lived for a year or more.\r\n\r\n"Breaking up home ties," he said with a grin. "Don\'t come to the boat,"\r\nhe added downstairs. "She don\'t sail for an hour or two and I\'ll be\r\nasleep in my bunk long before."\r\n\r\n"All right. Good-by, J. K.--remember we may meet over there----"\r\n\r\nAgain that gruffness came into his voice:\r\n\r\n"If you do, you\'ll be taking a mighty big chance," he said. "Good-by,\r\nBill--it\'s just possible we may never meet again. Glad to have made your\r\nacquaintance, Kid. Here\'s wishing you luck."\r\n\r\nHe turned and went off down the Farm with that long swinging walk of\r\nhis, his big heavy shoulders bent rather more than before. And as I\r\nstood looking after him I thought of the lonely winding road that he was\r\nto travel day and night, into slums of cities and in and out among the\r\ncamps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI walked slowly back through the tenements toward the new home among\r\nthem that Eleanore had made.\r\n\r\nIn the summer\'s night the city streets were still alive with people. I\r\npassed brightly lighted thoroughfares where I saw them in crowds, and I\r\nknew that this tide of people flowed endlessly through the hundreds of\r\nmiles of streets that made up the port of New York. Hurrying, idling,\r\ntalking and laughing, quarreling, fighting, here stopping to look at\r\ndisplays in shop windows, there pouring into "Movies"--and walking,\r\nwalking, walking on. Going up into their tenement homes to eat and\r\ndrink, love, breed and sleep, to wake up and come down to another day.\r\n\r\nSo the crowd moved on and on, while the great harbor surrounding their\r\nlives and shaping their lives, went on with its changes unheeded.\r\n\r\nI tried to think of this harbor as being run by this common crowd--of\r\nthe railroads, mines and factories, of the colleges, hospitals and all\r\ninstitutions of research, and the theaters and concert halls, the\r\npicture galleries, all the books--all in the power of the crowd.\r\n\r\n"It will be a long time," I thought. "Before it comes the crowd must\r\nchange. But they will change--and fast or slow, I belong with them while\r\nthey\'re changing."\r\n\r\nSomething Joe had once said came into my mind:\r\n\r\n"They\'re the ones who get shot down in wars and worked like dogs in time\r\nof peace."\r\n\r\nAnd I thought of the crowds across the sea--of men being rushed over\r\nEurope on trains, or marching along starlit roads, or tramping across\r\nmeadows. And I thought of long lines of fire at dawn spurting from the\r\nmouths of guns--from mountainsides, from out of woods, from trenches in\r\nfast blackening fields--and of men in endless multitudes pitching on\r\ntheir faces as the fire mowed them down.\r\n\r\nAnd with those men, it seemed to me, went all the great gods I had\r\nknown--gods of civilization and peace--the kind god in my mother\'s\r\nchurch and the smiling goddess in Paris, the clear-eyed god of\r\nefficiency and the awakening god of the crowd--all plunging into this\r\nfurnace of war with the men in whose spirits all gods dwell--to shrivel\r\nand melt in seething flame and emerge at last in strange new forms. What\r\nwould come out of the furnace?\r\n\r\nI thought of Joe and his comrades going about in towns and camps,\r\nspeaking low and watching, waiting, hoping to bring a new dawn, a new\r\norder, out of this chaotic night.\r\n\r\nAnd I heard them say to these governments:\r\n\r\n"Your civilization is crashing down. For a hundred years, in all our\r\nstrikes and risings, you preached against our violence--you talked of\r\nyour law and order, your clear deliberate thinking. In you lay the hope\r\nof the world, you said. You were Civilization. You were Mind and\r\nScience, in you was all Efficiency, in you was Art, Religion, and you\r\nkept the Public Peace. But now you have broken all your vows. The\r\nworld\'s treasures of Art are as safe with you as they were in the Dark\r\nAges. Your Prince of Peace you have trampled down. And all your Science\r\nyou have turned to the efficient slaughter of men. In a week of your\r\nboasted calmness you have plunged the world into a violence beside which\r\nall the bloodshed in our strikes and revolutions seems like a pool\r\nbeside the sea. And so you have failed, you powers above, blindly and\r\nstupidly you have failed. For you have let loose a violence where you\r\nare weak and we are strong. We are these armies that you have called\r\nout. And before we go back to our homes we shall make sure that these\r\nhomes of ours shall no more become ashes at your will. For we shall stop\r\nthis war of yours and in our minds we shall put away all hatred of our\r\nbrother men. For us they will be workers all. With them we shall rise\r\nand rise again--until at last the world is free!"\r\n\r\nThe voice had ceased--and again I was walking by myself along a crowded\r\ntenement street. Immigrants from Europe, brothers, sons and fathers of\r\nthe men now in the camps, kept passing me along the way. As I looked\r\ninto their faces I saw no hope for Europe there. Such men could take and\r\nhold no world. But then I remembered how in the strike, out of just such\r\nmen as these, I had seen a giant slowly born. Would that crowd spirit\r\nrise again? Could it be that the time was near when this last and\r\nmightiest of the gods would rise and take the world in his hands?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt home I found Eleanore asleep. For a time I sat at my desk and made\r\nsome notes for my writing. I read and smoked for a little, then\r\nundressed and went to bed. But still I lay there wide awake--thinking of\r\nthis home of mine and of where I might be in a few months more, in this\r\nyear that no man can see beyond. For all the changes in the world seemed\r\ngathering in a cyclone now.\r\n\r\nI was nearly asleep when I was roused by a thick voice from the harbor.\r\nLow in the distance, deep but now rising blast on blast, its waves of\r\nsound beat into the city--into millions of ears of sleepers and\r\nwatchers, the well, the sick and the dying, the dead, the lovers, the\r\nschemers, the dreamers, the toilers, the spenders and wasters. I shut my\r\neyes and saw the huge liner on which Joe was sailing moving slowly out\r\nof its slip. Down at its bottom men shoveling coal to the clang of its\r\ngong. On the decks above them, hundreds of cabins and suites de\r\nluxe--most of them dark and empty now. Bellowing impatiently as it swept\r\nout into the stream, it seemed to be saying:\r\n\r\n"Make way for me. Make way, all you little men. Make way, all you habits\r\nand all you institutions, all you little creeds and gods. For I am the\r\nstart of the voyage--over the ocean to heathen lands! And I am always\r\nstarting out and always bearing you along! For I am your molder, I am\r\nstrong--I am a surprise, I am a shock--I am a dazzling passion of\r\nhope--I am a grim executioner! I am reality--I am life! I am the book\r\nthat has no end."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN FOX, JR\'S.\r\n\r\nSTORIES OF THE KENTUCKY MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nMay be had wherever books are sold.

Yohn.\r\n\r\nThe "lonesome pine" from which the story takes its name was a tall tree\r\nthat stood in solitary splendor on a mountain top. The fame of the pine\r\nlured a young engineer through Kentucky to catch the trail, and when he\r\nfinally climbed to its shelter he found not only the pine but the\r\n_foot-prints of a girl_.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
