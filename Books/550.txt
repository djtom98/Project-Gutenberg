The\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s dog barked fiercely when one of these alien-looking men\r\nappeared on the upland, dark against the early winter sunset; for what\r\ndog likes a figure bent under a heavy bag?\xe2\x80\x94and these pale men rarely\r\nstirred abroad without that mysterious burden. The shepherd himself,\r\nthough he had good reason to believe that the bag held nothing but\r\nflaxen thread, or else the long rolls of strong linen spun from that\r\nthread, was not quite sure that this trade of weaving, indispensable\r\nthough it was, could be carried on entirely without the help of the\r\nEvil One. In that far-off time superstition clung easily round every\r\nperson or thing that was at all unwonted, or even intermittent and\r\noccasional merely, like the visits of the pedlar or the knife-grinder.\r\nNo one knew where wandering men had their homes or their origin; and\r\nhow was a man to be explained unless you at least knew somebody who\r\nknew his father and mother? To the peasants of old times, the world\r\noutside their own direct experience was a region of vagueness and\r\nmystery: to their untravelled thought a state of wandering was a\r\nconception as dim as the winter life of the swallows that came back\r\nwith the spring; and even a settler, if he came from distant parts,\r\nhardly ever ceased to be viewed with a remnant of distrust, which would\r\nhave prevented any surprise if a long course of inoffensive conduct on\r\nhis part had ended in the commission of a crime; especially if he had\r\nany reputation for knowledge, or showed any skill in handicraft. All\r\ncleverness, whether in the rapid use of that difficult instrument the\r\ntongue, or in some other art unfamiliar to villagers, was in itself\r\nsuspicious: honest folk, born and bred in a visible manner, were mostly\r\nnot overwise or clever\xe2\x80\x94at least, not beyond such a matter as knowing\r\nthe signs of the weather; and the process by which rapidity and\r\ndexterity of any kind were acquired was so wholly hidden, that they\r\npartook of the nature of conjuring. In this way it came to pass that\r\nthose scattered linen-weavers\xe2\x80\x94emigrants from the town into the\r\ncountry\xe2\x80\x94were to the last regarded as aliens by their rustic neighbours,\r\nand usually contracted the eccentric habits which belong to a state of\r\nloneliness.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of this century, such a linen-weaver, named Silas\r\nMarner, worked at his vocation in a stone cottage that stood among the\r\nnutty hedgerows near the village of Raveloe, and not far from the edge\r\nof a deserted stone-pit. The questionable sound of Silas\xe2\x80\x99s loom, so\r\nunlike the natural cheerful trotting of the winnowing-machine, or the\r\nsimpler rhythm of the flail, had a half-fearful fascination for the\r\nRaveloe boys, who would often leave off their nutting or birds\xe2\x80\x99-nesting\r\nto peep in at the window of the stone cottage, counterbalancing a\r\ncertain awe at the mysterious action of the loom, by a pleasant sense\r\nof scornful superiority, drawn from the mockery of its alternating\r\nnoises, along with the bent, tread-mill attitude of the weaver. But\r\nsometimes it happened that Marner, pausing to adjust an irregularity in\r\nhis thread, became aware of the small scoundrels, and, though chary of\r\nhis time, he liked their intrusion so ill that he would descend from\r\nhis loom, and, opening the door, would fix on them a gaze that was\r\nalways enough to make them take to their legs in terror. For how was it\r\npossible to believe that those large brown protuberant eyes in Silas\r\nMarner\xe2\x80\x99s pale face really saw nothing very distinctly that was not\r\nclose to them, and not rather that their dreadful stare could dart\r\ncramp, or rickets, or a wry mouth at any boy who happened to be in the\r\nrear? They had, perhaps, heard their fathers and mothers hint that\r\nSilas Marner could cure folks\xe2\x80\x99 rheumatism if he had a mind, and add,\r\nstill more darkly, that if you could only speak the devil fair enough,\r\nhe might save you the cost of the doctor. Such strange lingering echoes\r\nof the old demon-worship might perhaps even now be caught by the\r\ndiligent listener among the grey-haired peasantry; for the rude mind\r\nwith difficulty associates the ideas of power and benignity. A shadowy\r\nconception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to refrain\r\nfrom inflicting harm, is the shape most easily taken by the sense of\r\nthe Invisible in the minds of men who have always been pressed close by\r\nprimitive wants, and to whom a life of hard toil has never been\r\nilluminated by any enthusiastic religious faith. To them pain and\r\nmishap present a far wider range of possibilities than gladness and\r\nenjoyment: their imagination is almost barren of the images that feed\r\ndesire and hope, but is all overgrown by recollections that are a\r\nperpetual pasture to fear. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything you can fancy that you\r\nwould like to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d I once said to an old labouring man, who was in his\r\nlast illness, and who had refused all the food his wife had offered\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been used to nothing but common\r\nvictual, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t eat that.\xe2\x80\x9d Experience had bred no fancies in him\r\nthat could raise the phantasm of appetite.\r\n\r\nAnd Raveloe was a village where many of the old echoes lingered,\r\nundrowned by new voices. Not that it was one of those barren parishes\r\nlying on the outskirts of civilization\xe2\x80\x94inhabited by meagre sheep and\r\nthinly-scattered shepherds: on the contrary, it lay in the rich central\r\nplain of what we are pleased to call Merry England, and held farms\r\nwhich, speaking from a spiritual point of view, paid highly-desirable\r\ntithes. But it was nestled in a snug well-wooded hollow, quite an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s journey on horseback from any turnpike, where it was never\r\nreached by the vibrations of the coach-horn, or of public opinion. It\r\nwas an important-looking village, with a fine old church and large\r\nchurchyard in the heart of it, and two or three large brick-and-stone\r\nhomesteads, with well-walled orchards and ornamental weathercocks,\r\nstanding close upon the road, and lifting more imposing fronts than the\r\nrectory, which peeped from among the trees on the other side of the\r\nchurchyard:\xe2\x80\x94a village which showed at once the summits of its social\r\nlife, and told the practised eye that there was no great park and\r\nmanor-house in the vicinity, but that there were several chiefs in\r\nRaveloe who could farm badly quite at their ease, drawing enough money\r\nfrom their bad farming, in those war times, to live in a rollicking\r\nfashion, and keep a jolly Christmas, Whitsun, and Easter tide.\r\n\r\nIt was fifteen years since Silas Marner had first come to Raveloe; he\r\nwas then simply a pallid young man, with prominent short-sighted brown\r\neyes, whose appearance would have had nothing strange for people of\r\naverage culture and experience, but for the villagers near whom he had\r\ncome to settle it had mysterious peculiarities which corresponded with\r\nthe exceptional nature of his occupation, and his advent from an\r\nunknown region called \xe2\x80\x9cNorth\xe2\x80\x99ard\xe2\x80\x9d. So had his way of life:\xe2\x80\x94he invited\r\nno comer to step across his door-sill, and he never strolled into the\r\nvillage to drink a pint at the Rainbow, or to gossip at the\r\nwheelwright\xe2\x80\x99s: he sought no man or woman, save for the purposes of his\r\ncalling, or in order to supply himself with necessaries; and it was\r\nsoon clear to the Raveloe lasses that he would never urge one of them\r\nto accept him against her will\xe2\x80\x94quite as if he had heard them declare\r\nthat they would never marry a dead man come to life again. This view of\r\nMarner\xe2\x80\x99s personality was not without another ground than his pale face\r\nand unexampled eyes; for Jem Rodney, the mole-catcher, averred that one\r\nevening as he was returning homeward, he saw Silas Marner leaning\r\nagainst a stile with a heavy bag on his back, instead of resting the\r\nbag on the stile as a man in his senses would have done; and that, on\r\ncoming up to him, he saw that Marner\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were set like a dead man\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand he spoke to him, and shook him, and his limbs were stiff, and his\r\nhands clutched the bag as if they\xe2\x80\x99d been made of iron; but just as he\r\nhad made up his mind that the weaver was dead, he came all right again,\r\nlike, as you might say, in the winking of an eye, and said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night\xe2\x80\x9d, and walked off. All this Jem swore he had seen, more by\r\ntoken that it was the very day he had been mole-catching on Squire\r\nCass\xe2\x80\x99s land, down by the old saw-pit. Some said Marner must have been\r\nin a \xe2\x80\x9cfit\xe2\x80\x9d, a word which seemed to explain things otherwise incredible;\r\nbut the argumentative Mr. Macey, clerk of the parish, shook his head,\r\nand asked if anybody was ever known to go off in a fit and not fall\r\ndown. A fit was a stroke, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? and it was in the nature of a\r\nstroke to partly take away the use of a man\xe2\x80\x99s limbs and throw him on\r\nthe parish, if he\xe2\x80\x99d got no children to look to. No, no; it was no\r\nstroke that would let a man stand on his legs, like a horse between the\r\nshafts, and then walk off as soon as you can say \xe2\x80\x9cGee!\xe2\x80\x9d But there might\r\nbe such a thing as a man\xe2\x80\x99s soul being loose from his body, and going\r\nout and in, like a bird out of its nest and back; and that was how\r\nfolks got over-wise, for they went to school in this shell-less state\r\nto those who could teach them more than their neighbours could learn\r\nwith their five senses and the parson. And where did Master Marner get\r\nhis knowledge of herbs from\xe2\x80\x94and charms too, if he liked to give them\r\naway? Jem Rodney\xe2\x80\x99s story was no more than what might have been expected\r\nby anybody who had seen how Marner had cured Sally Oates, and made her\r\nsleep like a baby, when her heart had been beating enough to burst her\r\nbody, for two months and more, while she had been under the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncare. He might cure more folks if he would; but he was worth speaking\r\nfair, if it was only to keep him from doing you a mischief.\r\n\r\nIt was partly to this vague fear that Marner was indebted for\r\nprotecting him from the persecution that his singularities might have\r\ndrawn upon him, but still more to the fact that, the old linen-weaver\r\nin the neighbouring parish of Tarley being dead, his handicraft made\r\nhim a highly welcome settler to the richer housewives of the district,\r\nand even to the more provident cottagers, who had their little stock of\r\nyarn at the year\xe2\x80\x99s end. Their sense of his usefulness would have\r\ncounteracted any repugnance or suspicion which was not confirmed by a\r\ndeficiency in the quality or the tale of the cloth he wove for them.\r\nAnd the years had rolled on without producing any change in the\r\nimpressions of the neighbours concerning Marner, except the change from\r\nnovelty to habit. At the end of fifteen years the Raveloe men said just\r\nthe same things about Silas Marner as at the beginning: they did not\r\nsay them quite so often, but they believed them much more strongly when\r\nthey did say them. There was only one important addition which the\r\nyears had brought: it was, that Master Marner had laid by a fine sight\r\nof money somewhere, and that he could buy up \xe2\x80\x9cbigger men\xe2\x80\x9d than himself.\r\n\r\nBut while opinion concerning him had remained nearly stationary, and\r\nhis daily habits had presented scarcely any visible change, Marner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninward life had been a history and a metamorphosis, as that of every\r\nfervid nature must be when it has fled, or been condemned, to solitude.\r\nHis life, before he came to Raveloe, had been filled with the movement,\r\nthe mental activity, and the close fellowship, which, in that day as in\r\nthis, marked the life of an artisan early incorporated in a narrow\r\nreligious sect, where the poorest layman has the chance of\r\ndistinguishing himself by gifts of speech, and has, at the very least,\r\nthe weight of a silent voter in the government of his community. Marner\r\nwas highly thought of in that little hidden world, known to itself as\r\nthe church assembling in Lantern Yard; he was believed to be a young\r\nman of exemplary life and ardent faith; and a peculiar interest had\r\nbeen centred in him ever since he had fallen, at a prayer-meeting, into\r\na mysterious rigidity and suspension of consciousness, which, lasting\r\nfor an hour or more, had been mistaken for death. To have sought a\r\nmedical explanation for this phenomenon would have been held by Silas\r\nhimself, as well as by his minister and fellow-members, a wilful\r\nself-exclusion from the spiritual significance that might lie therein.\r\nSilas was evidently a brother selected for a peculiar discipline; and\r\nthough the effort to interpret this discipline was discouraged by the\r\nabsence, on his part, of any spiritual vision during his outward\r\ntrance, yet it was believed by himself and others that its effect was\r\nseen in an accession of light and fervour. A less truthful man than he\r\nmight have been tempted into the subsequent creation of a vision in the\r\nform of resurgent memory; a less sane man might have believed in such a\r\ncreation; but Silas was both sane and honest, though, as with many\r\nhonest and fervent men, culture had not defined any channels for his\r\nsense of mystery, and so it spread itself over the proper pathway of\r\ninquiry and knowledge. He had inherited from his mother some\r\nacquaintance with medicinal herbs and their preparation\xe2\x80\x94a little store\r\nof wisdom which she had imparted to him as a solemn bequest\xe2\x80\x94but of late\r\nyears he had had doubts about the lawfulness of applying this\r\nknowledge, believing that herbs could have no efficacy without prayer,\r\nand that prayer might suffice without herbs; so that the inherited\r\ndelight he had in wandering in the fields in search of foxglove and\r\ndandelion and coltsfoot, began to wear to him the character of a\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\nAmong the members of his church there was one young man, a little older\r\nthan himself, with whom he had long lived in such close friendship that\r\nit was the custom of their Lantern Yard brethren to call them David and\r\nJonathan. The real name of the friend was William Dane, and he, too,\r\nwas regarded as a shining instance of youthful piety, though somewhat\r\ngiven to over-severity towards weaker brethren, and to be so dazzled by\r\nhis own light as to hold himself wiser than his teachers. But whatever\r\nblemishes others might discern in William, to his friend\xe2\x80\x99s mind he was\r\nfaultless; for Marner had one of those impressible self-doubting\r\nnatures which, at an inexperienced age, admire imperativeness and lean\r\non contradiction. The expression of trusting simplicity in Marner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, heightened by that absence of special observation, that\r\ndefenceless, deer-like gaze which belongs to large prominent eyes, was\r\nstrongly contrasted by the self-complacent suppression of inward\r\ntriumph that lurked in the narrow slanting eyes and compressed lips of\r\nWilliam Dane. One of the most frequent topics of conversation between\r\nthe two friends was Assurance of salvation: Silas confessed that he\r\ncould never arrive at anything higher than hope mingled with fear, and\r\nlistened with longing wonder when William declared that he had\r\npossessed unshaken assurance ever since, in the period of his\r\nconversion, he had dreamed that he saw the words \xe2\x80\x9ccalling and election\r\nsure\xe2\x80\x9d standing by themselves on a white page in the open Bible. Such\r\ncolloquies have occupied many a pair of pale-faced weavers, whose\r\nunnurtured souls have been like young winged things, fluttering\r\nforsaken in the twilight.\r\n\r\nIt had seemed to the unsuspecting Silas that the friendship had\r\nsuffered no chill even from his formation of another attachment of a\r\ncloser kind. For some months he had been engaged to a young\r\nservant-woman, waiting only for a little increase to their mutual\r\nsavings in order to their marriage; and it was a great delight to him\r\nthat Sarah did not object to William\xe2\x80\x99s occasional presence in their\r\nSunday interviews. It was at this point in their history that Silas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncataleptic fit occurred during the prayer-meeting; and amidst the\r\nvarious queries and expressions of interest addressed to him by his\r\nfellow-members, William\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion alone jarred with the general\r\nsympathy towards a brother thus singled out for special dealings. He\r\nobserved that, to him, this trance looked more like a visitation of\r\nSatan than a proof of divine favour, and exhorted his friend to see\r\nthat he hid no accursed thing within his soul. Silas, feeling bound to\r\naccept rebuke and admonition as a brotherly office, felt no resentment,\r\nbut only pain, at his friend\xe2\x80\x99s doubts concerning him; and to this was\r\nsoon added some anxiety at the perception that Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s manner towards\r\nhim began to exhibit a strange fluctuation between an effort at an\r\nincreased manifestation of regard and involuntary signs of shrinking\r\nand dislike. He asked her if she wished to break off their engagement;\r\nbut she denied this: their engagement was known to the church, and had\r\nbeen recognized in the prayer-meetings; it could not be broken off\r\nwithout strict investigation, and Sarah could render no reason that\r\nwould be sanctioned by the feeling of the community. At this time the\r\nsenior deacon was taken dangerously ill, and, being a childless\r\nwidower, he was tended night and day by some of the younger brethren or\r\nsisters. Silas frequently took his turn in the night-watching with\r\nWilliam, the one relieving the other at two in the morning. The old\r\nman, contrary to expectation, seemed to be on the way to recovery, when\r\none night Silas, sitting up by his bedside, observed that his usual\r\naudible breathing had ceased. The candle was burning low, and he had to\r\nlift it to see the patient\xe2\x80\x99s face distinctly. Examination convinced him\r\nthat the deacon was dead\xe2\x80\x94had been dead some time, for the limbs were\r\nrigid. Silas asked himself if he had been asleep, and looked at the\r\nclock: it was already four in the morning. How was it that William had\r\nnot come? In much anxiety he went to seek for help, and soon there were\r\nseveral friends assembled in the house, the minister among them, while\r\nSilas went away to his work, wishing he could have met William to know\r\nthe reason of his non-appearance. But at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, as he was\r\nthinking of going to seek his friend, William came, and with him the\r\nminister. They came to summon him to Lantern Yard, to meet the church\r\nmembers there; and to his inquiry concerning the cause of the summons\r\nthe only reply was, \xe2\x80\x9cYou will hear.\xe2\x80\x9d Nothing further was said until\r\nSilas was seated in the vestry, in front of the minister, with the eyes\r\nof those who to him represented God\xe2\x80\x99s people fixed solemnly upon him.\r\nThen the minister, taking out a pocket-knife, showed it to Silas, and\r\nasked him if he knew where he had left that knife? Silas said, he did\r\nnot know that he had left it anywhere out of his own pocket\xe2\x80\x94but he was\r\ntrembling at this strange interrogation. He was then exhorted not to\r\nhide his sin, but to confess and repent. The knife had been found in\r\nthe bureau by the departed deacon\xe2\x80\x99s bedside\xe2\x80\x94found in the place where\r\nthe little bag of church money had lain, which the minister himself had\r\nseen the day before. Some hand had removed that bag; and whose hand\r\ncould it be, if not that of the man to whom the knife belonged? For\r\nsome time Silas was mute with astonishment: then he said, \xe2\x80\x9cGod will\r\nclear me: I know nothing about the knife being there, or the money\r\nbeing gone. Search me and my dwelling; you will find nothing but three\r\npound five of my own savings, which William Dane knows I have had these\r\nsix months.\xe2\x80\x9d At this William groaned, but the minister said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe proof\r\nis heavy against you, brother Marner. The money was taken in the night\r\nlast past, and no man was with our departed brother but you, for\r\nWilliam Dane declares to us that he was hindered by sudden sickness\r\nfrom going to take his place as usual, and you yourself said that he\r\nhad not come; and, moreover, you neglected the dead body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have slept,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas. Then, after a pause, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cOr I\r\nmust have had another visitation like that which you have all seen me\r\nunder, so that the thief must have come and gone while I was not in the\r\nbody, but out of the body. But, I say again, search me and my dwelling,\r\nfor I have been nowhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe search was made, and it ended\xe2\x80\x94in William Dane\xe2\x80\x99s finding the\r\nwell-known bag, empty, tucked behind the chest of drawers in Silas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber! On this William exhorted his friend to confess, and not to\r\nhide his sin any longer. Silas turned a look of keen reproach on him,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cWilliam, for nine years that we have gone in and out\r\ntogether, have you ever known me tell a lie? But God will clear me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother,\xe2\x80\x9d said William, \xe2\x80\x9chow do I know what you may have done in the\r\nsecret chambers of your heart, to give Satan an advantage over you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilas was still looking at his friend. Suddenly a deep flush came over\r\nhis face, and he was about to speak impetuously, when he seemed checked\r\nagain by some inward shock, that sent the flush back and made him\r\ntremble. But at last he spoke feebly, looking at William.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember now\xe2\x80\x94the knife wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in my pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilliam said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing of what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d The other persons\r\npresent, however, began to inquire where Silas meant to say that the\r\nknife was, but he would give no further explanation: he only said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam sore stricken; I can say nothing. God will clear me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn their return to the vestry there was further deliberation. Any\r\nresort to legal measures for ascertaining the culprit was contrary to\r\nthe principles of the church in Lantern Yard, according to which\r\nprosecution was forbidden to Christians, even had the case held less\r\nscandal to the community. But the members were bound to take other\r\nmeasures for finding out the truth, and they resolved on praying and\r\ndrawing lots. This resolution can be a ground of surprise only to those\r\nwho are unacquainted with that obscure religious life which has gone on\r\nin the alleys of our towns. Silas knelt with his brethren, relying on\r\nhis own innocence being certified by immediate divine interference, but\r\nfeeling that there was sorrow and mourning behind for him even\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94that his trust in man had been cruelly bruised. _The lots declared\r\nthat Silas Marner was guilty._ He was solemnly suspended from\r\nchurch-membership, and called upon to render up the stolen money: only\r\non confession, as the sign of repentance, could he be received once\r\nmore within the folds of the church. Marner listened in silence. At\r\nlast, when everyone rose to depart, he went towards William Dane and\r\nsaid, in a voice shaken by agitation\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last time I remember using my knife, was when I took it out to cut\r\na strap for you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember putting it in my pocket again. _You_\r\nstole the money, and you have woven a plot to lay the sin at my door.\r\nBut you may prosper, for all that: there is no just God that governs\r\nthe earth righteously, but a God of lies, that bears witness against\r\nthe innocent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a general shudder at this blasphemy.\r\n\r\nWilliam said meekly, \xe2\x80\x9cI leave our brethren to judge whether this is the\r\nvoice of Satan or not. I can do nothing but pray for you, Silas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Marner went out with that despair in his soul\xe2\x80\x94that shaken trust in\r\nGod and man, which is little short of madness to a loving nature. In\r\nthe bitterness of his wounded spirit, he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9c_She_ will\r\ncast me off too.\xe2\x80\x9d And he reflected that, if she did not believe the\r\ntestimony against him, her whole faith must be upset as his was. To\r\npeople accustomed to reason about the forms in which their religious\r\nfeeling has incorporated itself, it is difficult to enter into that\r\nsimple, untaught state of mind in which the form and the feeling have\r\nnever been severed by an act of reflection. We are apt to think it\r\ninevitable that a man in Marner\xe2\x80\x99s position should have begun to\r\nquestion the validity of an appeal to the divine judgment by drawing\r\nlots; but to him this would have been an effort of independent thought\r\nsuch as he had never known; and he must have made the effort at a\r\nmoment when all his energies were turned into the anguish of\r\ndisappointed faith. If there is an angel who records the sorrows of men\r\nas well as their sins, he knows how many and deep are the sorrows that\r\nspring from false ideas for which no man is culpable.\r\n\r\nMarner went home, and for a whole day sat alone, stunned by despair,\r\nwithout any impulse to go to Sarah and attempt to win her belief in his\r\ninnocence. The second day he took refuge from benumbing unbelief, by\r\ngetting into his loom and working away as usual; and before many hours\r\nwere past, the minister and one of the deacons came to him with the\r\nmessage from Sarah, that she held her engagement to him at an end.\r\nSilas received the message mutely, and then turned away from the\r\nmessengers to work at his loom again. In little more than a month from\r\nthat time, Sarah was married to William Dane; and not long afterwards\r\nit was known to the brethren in Lantern Yard that Silas Marner had\r\ndeparted from the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEven people whose lives have been made various by learning, sometimes\r\nfind it hard to keep a fast hold on their habitual views of life, on\r\ntheir faith in the Invisible, nay, on the sense that their past joys\r\nand sorrows are a real experience, when they are suddenly transported\r\nto a new land, where the beings around them know nothing of their\r\nhistory, and share none of their ideas\xe2\x80\x94where their mother earth shows\r\nanother lap, and human life has other forms than those on which their\r\nsouls have been nourished. Minds that have been unhinged from their old\r\nfaith and love, have perhaps sought this Lethean influence of exile, in\r\nwhich the past becomes dreamy because its symbols have all vanished,\r\nand the present too is dreamy because it is linked with no memories.\r\nBut even _their_ experience may hardly enable them thoroughly to\r\nimagine what was the effect on a simple weaver like Silas Marner, when\r\nhe left his own country and people and came to settle in Raveloe.\r\nNothing could be more unlike his native town, set within sight of the\r\nwidespread hillsides, than this low, wooded region, where he felt\r\nhidden even from the heavens by the screening trees and hedgerows.\r\nThere was nothing here, when he rose in the deep morning quiet and\r\nlooked out on the dewy brambles and rank tufted grass, that seemed to\r\nhave any relation with that life centring in Lantern Yard, which had\r\nonce been to him the altar-place of high dispensations. The whitewashed\r\nwalls; the little pews where well-known figures entered with a subdued\r\nrustling, and where first one well-known voice and then another,\r\npitched in a peculiar key of petition, uttered phrases at once occult\r\nand familiar, like the amulet worn on the heart; the pulpit where the\r\nminister delivered unquestioned doctrine, and swayed to and fro, and\r\nhandled the book in a long accustomed manner; the very pauses between\r\nthe couplets of the hymn, as it was given out, and the recurrent swell\r\nof voices in song: these things had been the channel of divine\r\ninfluences to Marner\xe2\x80\x94they were the fostering home of his religious\r\nemotions\xe2\x80\x94they were Christianity and God\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom upon earth. A weaver\r\nwho finds hard words in his hymn-book knows nothing of abstractions; as\r\nthe little child knows nothing of parental love, but only knows one\r\nface and one lap towards which it stretches its arms for refuge and\r\nnurture.\r\n\r\nAnd what could be more unlike that Lantern Yard world than the world in\r\nRaveloe?\xe2\x80\x94orchards looking lazy with neglected plenty; the large church\r\nin the wide churchyard, which men gazed at lounging at their own doors\r\nin service-time; the purple-faced farmers jogging along the lanes or\r\nturning in at the Rainbow; homesteads, where men supped heavily and\r\nslept in the light of the evening hearth, and where women seemed to be\r\nlaying up a stock of linen for the life to come. There were no lips in\r\nRaveloe from which a word could fall that would stir Silas Marner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbenumbed faith to a sense of pain. In the early ages of the world, we\r\nknow, it was believed that each territory was inhabited and ruled by\r\nits own divinities, so that a man could cross the bordering heights and\r\nbe out of the reach of his native gods, whose presence was confined to\r\nthe streams and the groves and the hills among which he had lived from\r\nhis birth. And poor Silas was vaguely conscious of something not unlike\r\nthe feeling of primitive men, when they fled thus, in fear or in\r\nsullenness, from the face of an unpropitious deity. It seemed to him\r\nthat the Power he had vainly trusted in among the streets and at the\r\nprayer-meetings, was very far away from this land in which he had taken\r\nrefuge, where men lived in careless abundance, knowing and needing\r\nnothing of that trust, which, for him, had been turned to bitterness.\r\nThe little light he possessed spread its beams so narrowly, that\r\nfrustrated belief was a curtain broad enough to create for him the\r\nblackness of night.\r\n\r\nHis first movement after the shock had been to work in his loom; and he\r\nwent on with this unremittingly, never asking himself why, now he was\r\ncome to Raveloe, he worked far on into the night to finish the tale of\r\nMrs. Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s table-linen sooner than she expected\xe2\x80\x94without\r\ncontemplating beforehand the money she would put into his hand for the\r\nwork. He seemed to weave, like the spider, from pure impulse, without\r\nreflection. Every man\xe2\x80\x99s work, pursued steadily, tends in this way to\r\nbecome an end in itself, and so to bridge over the loveless chasms of\r\nhis life. Silas\xe2\x80\x99s hand satisfied itself with throwing the shuttle, and\r\nhis eye with seeing the little squares in the cloth complete themselves\r\nunder his effort. Then there were the calls of hunger; and Silas, in\r\nhis solitude, had to provide his own breakfast, dinner, and supper, to\r\nfetch his own water from the well, and put his own kettle on the fire;\r\nand all these immediate promptings helped, along with the weaving, to\r\nreduce his life to the unquestioning activity of a spinning insect. He\r\nhated the thought of the past; there was nothing that called out his\r\nlove and fellowship toward the strangers he had come amongst; and the\r\nfuture was all dark, for there was no Unseen Love that cared for him.\r\nThought was arrested by utter bewilderment, now its old narrow pathway\r\nwas closed, and affection seemed to have died under the bruise that had\r\nfallen on its keenest nerves.\r\n\r\nBut at last Mrs. Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s table-linen was finished, and Silas was paid\r\nin gold. His earnings in his native town, where he worked for a\r\nwholesale dealer, had been after a lower rate; he had been paid weekly,\r\nand of his weekly earnings a large proportion had gone to objects of\r\npiety and charity. Now, for the first time in his life, he had five\r\nbright guineas put into his hand; no man expected a share of them, and\r\nhe loved no man that he should offer him a share. But what were the\r\nguineas to him who saw no vista beyond countless days of weaving? It\r\nwas needless for him to ask that, for it was pleasant to him to feel\r\nthem in his palm, and look at their bright faces, which were all his\r\nown: it was another element of life, like the weaving and the\r\nsatisfaction of hunger, subsisting quite aloof from the life of belief\r\nand love from which he had been cut off. The weaver\xe2\x80\x99s hand had known\r\nthe touch of hard-won money even before the palm had grown to its full\r\nbreadth; for twenty years, mysterious money had stood to him as the\r\nsymbol of earthly good, and the immediate object of toil. He had seemed\r\nto love it little in the years when every penny had its purpose for\r\nhim; for he loved the _purpose_ then. But now, when all purpose was\r\ngone, that habit of looking towards the money and grasping it with a\r\nsense of fulfilled effort made a loam that was deep enough for the\r\nseeds of desire; and as Silas walked homeward across the fields in the\r\ntwilight, he drew out the money and thought it was brighter in the\r\ngathering gloom.\r\n\r\nAbout this time an incident happened which seemed to open a possibility\r\nof some fellowship with his neighbours. One day, taking a pair of shoes\r\nto be mended, he saw the cobbler\xe2\x80\x99s wife seated by the fire, suffering\r\nfrom the terrible symptoms of heart-disease and dropsy, which he had\r\nwitnessed as the precursors of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death. He felt a rush of\r\npity at the mingled sight and remembrance, and, recalling the relief\r\nhis mother had found from a simple preparation of foxglove, he promised\r\nSally Oates to bring her something that would ease her, since the\r\ndoctor did her no good. In this office of charity, Silas felt, for the\r\nfirst time since he had come to Raveloe, a sense of unity between his\r\npast and present life, which might have been the beginning of his\r\nrescue from the insect-like existence into which his nature had shrunk.\r\nBut Sally Oates\xe2\x80\x99s disease had raised her into a personage of much\r\ninterest and importance among the neighbours, and the fact of her\r\nhaving found relief from drinking Silas Marner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d became a\r\nmatter of general discourse. When Doctor Kimble gave physic, it was\r\nnatural that it should have an effect; but when a weaver, who came from\r\nnobody knew where, worked wonders with a bottle of brown waters, the\r\noccult character of the process was evident. Such a sort of thing had\r\nnot been known since the Wise Woman at Tarley died; and she had charms\r\nas well as \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d: everybody went to her when their children had fits.\r\nSilas Marner must be a person of the same sort, for how did he know\r\nwhat would bring back Sally Oates\xe2\x80\x99s breath, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know a fine\r\nsight more than that? The Wise Woman had words that she muttered to\r\nherself, so that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear what they were, and if she tied a\r\nbit of red thread round the child\xe2\x80\x99s toe the while, it would keep off\r\nthe water in the head. There were women in Raveloe, at that present\r\ntime, who had worn one of the Wise Woman\xe2\x80\x99s little bags round their\r\nnecks, and, in consequence, had never had an idiot child, as Ann\r\nCoulter had. Silas Marner could very likely do as much, and more; and\r\nnow it was all clear how he should have come from unknown parts, and be\r\nso \xe2\x80\x9ccomical-looking\xe2\x80\x9d. But Sally Oates must mind and not tell the\r\ndoctor, for he would be sure to set his face against Marner: he was\r\nalways angry about the Wise Woman, and used to threaten those who went\r\nto her that they should have none of his help any more.\r\n\r\nSilas now found himself and his cottage suddenly beset by mothers who\r\nwanted him to charm away the whooping-cough, or bring back the milk,\r\nand by men who wanted stuff against the rheumatics or the knots in the\r\nhands; and, to secure themselves against a refusal, the applicants\r\nbrought silver in their palms. Silas might have driven a profitable\r\ntrade in charms as well as in his small list of drugs; but money on\r\nthis condition was no temptation to him: he had never known an impulse\r\ntowards falsity, and he drove one after another away with growing\r\nirritation, for the news of him as a wise man had spread even to\r\nTarley, and it was long before people ceased to take long walks for the\r\nsake of asking his aid. But the hope in his wisdom was at length\r\nchanged into dread, for no one believed him when he said he knew no\r\ncharms and could work no cures, and every man and woman who had an\r\naccident or a new attack after applying to him, set the misfortune down\r\nto Master Marner\xe2\x80\x99s ill-will and irritated glances. Thus it came to pass\r\nthat his movement of pity towards Sally Oates, which had given him a\r\ntransient sense of brotherhood, heightened the repulsion between him\r\nand his neighbours, and made his isolation more complete.\r\n\r\nGradually the guineas, the crowns, and the half-crowns grew to a heap,\r\nand Marner drew less and less for his own wants, trying to solve the\r\nproblem of keeping himself strong enough to work sixteen hours a-day on\r\nas small an outlay as possible. Have not men, shut up in solitary\r\nimprisonment, found an interest in marking the moments by straight\r\nstrokes of a certain length on the wall, until the growth of the sum of\r\nstraight strokes, arranged in triangles, has become a mastering\r\npurpose? Do we not wile away moments of inanity or fatigued waiting by\r\nrepeating some trivial movement or sound, until the repetition has bred\r\na want, which is incipient habit? That will help us to understand how\r\nthe love of accumulating money grows an absorbing passion in men whose\r\nimaginations, even in the very beginning of their hoard, showed them no\r\npurpose beyond it. Marner wanted the heaps of ten to grow into a\r\nsquare, and then into a larger square; and every added guinea, while it\r\nwas itself a satisfaction, bred a new desire. In this strange world,\r\nmade a hopeless riddle to him, he might, if he had had a less intense\r\nnature, have sat weaving, weaving\xe2\x80\x94looking towards the end of his\r\npattern, or towards the end of his web, till he forgot the riddle, and\r\neverything else but his immediate sensations; but the money had come to\r\nmark off his weaving into periods, and the money not only grew, but it\r\nremained with him. He began to think it was conscious of him, as his\r\nloom was, and he would on no account have exchanged those coins, which\r\nhad become his familiars, for other coins with unknown faces. He\r\nhandled them, he counted them, till their form and colour were like the\r\nsatisfaction of a thirst to him; but it was only in the night, when his\r\nwork was done, that he drew them out to enjoy their companionship. He\r\nhad taken up some bricks in his floor underneath his loom, and here he\r\nhad made a hole in which he set the iron pot that contained his guineas\r\nand silver coins, covering the bricks with sand whenever he replaced\r\nthem. Not that the idea of being robbed presented itself often or\r\nstrongly to his mind: hoarding was common in country districts in those\r\ndays; there were old labourers in the parish of Raveloe who were known\r\nto have their savings by them, probably inside their flock-beds; but\r\ntheir rustic neighbours, though not all of them as honest as their\r\nancestors in the days of King Alfred, had not imaginations bold enough\r\nto lay a plan of burglary. How could they have spent the money in their\r\nown village without betraying themselves? They would be obliged to \xe2\x80\x9crun\r\naway\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a course as dark and dubious as a balloon journey.\r\n\r\nSo, year after year, Silas Marner had lived in this solitude, his\r\nguineas rising in the iron pot, and his life narrowing and hardening\r\nitself more and more into a mere pulsation of desire and satisfaction\r\nthat had no relation to any other being. His life had reduced itself to\r\nthe functions of weaving and hoarding, without any contemplation of an\r\nend towards which the functions tended. The same sort of process has\r\nperhaps been undergone by wiser men, when they have been cut off from\r\nfaith and love\xe2\x80\x94only, instead of a loom and a heap of guineas, they have\r\nhad some erudite research, some ingenious project, or some well-knit\r\ntheory. Strangely Marner\xe2\x80\x99s face and figure shrank and bent themselves\r\ninto a constant mechanical relation to the objects of his life, so that\r\nhe produced the same sort of impression as a handle or a crooked tube,\r\nwhich has no meaning standing apart. The prominent eyes that used to\r\nlook trusting and dreamy, now looked as if they had been made to see\r\nonly one kind of thing that was very small, like tiny grain, for which\r\nthey hunted everywhere: and he was so withered and yellow, that, though\r\nhe was not yet forty, the children always called him \xe2\x80\x9cOld Master\r\nMarner\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nYet even in this stage of withering a little incident happened, which\r\nshowed that the sap of affection was not all gone. It was one of his\r\ndaily tasks to fetch his water from a well a couple of fields off, and\r\nfor this purpose, ever since he came to Raveloe, he had had a brown\r\nearthenware pot, which he held as his most precious utensil among the\r\nvery few conveniences he had granted himself. It had been his companion\r\nfor twelve years, always standing on the same spot, always lending its\r\nhandle to him in the early morning, so that its form had an expression\r\nfor him of willing helpfulness, and the impress of its handle on his\r\npalm gave a satisfaction mingled with that of having the fresh clear\r\nwater. One day as he was returning from the well, he stumbled against\r\nthe step of the stile, and his brown pot, falling with force against\r\nthe stones that overarched the ditch below him, was broken in three\r\npieces. Silas picked up the pieces and carried them home with grief in\r\nhis heart. The brown pot could never be of use to him any more, but he\r\nstuck the bits together and propped the ruin in its old place for a\r\nmemorial.\r\n\r\nThis is the history of Silas Marner, until the fifteenth year after he\r\ncame to Raveloe. The livelong day he sat in his loom, his ear filled\r\nwith its monotony, his eyes bent close down on the slow growth of\r\nsameness in the brownish web, his muscles moving with such even\r\nrepetition that their pause seemed almost as much a constraint as the\r\nholding of his breath. But at night came his revelry: at night he\r\nclosed his shutters, and made fast his doors, and drew forth his gold.\r\nLong ago the heap of coins had become too large for the iron pot to\r\nhold them, and he had made for them two thick leather bags, which\r\nwasted no room in their resting-place, but lent themselves flexibly to\r\nevery corner. How the guineas shone as they came pouring out of the\r\ndark leather mouths! The silver bore no large proportion in amount to\r\nthe gold, because the long pieces of linen which formed his chief work\r\nwere always partly paid for in gold, and out of the silver he supplied\r\nhis own bodily wants, choosing always the shillings and sixpences to\r\nspend in this way. He loved the guineas best, but he would not change\r\nthe silver\xe2\x80\x94the crowns and half-crowns that were his own earnings,\r\nbegotten by his labour; he loved them all. He spread them out in heaps\r\nand bathed his hands in them; then he counted them and set them up in\r\nregular piles, and felt their rounded outline between his thumb and\r\nfingers, and thought fondly of the guineas that were only half-earned\r\nby the work in his loom, as if they had been unborn children\xe2\x80\x94thought of\r\nthe guineas that were coming slowly through the coming years, through\r\nall his life, which spread far away before him, the end quite hidden by\r\ncountless days of weaving. No wonder his thoughts were still with his\r\nloom and his money when he made his journeys through the fields and the\r\nlanes to fetch and carry home his work, so that his steps never\r\nwandered to the hedge-banks and the lane-side in search of the once\r\nfamiliar herbs: these too belonged to the past, from which his life had\r\nshrunk away, like a rivulet that has sunk far down from the grassy\r\nfringe of its old breadth into a little shivering thread, that cuts a\r\ngroove for itself in the barren sand.\r\n\r\nBut about the Christmas of that fifteenth year, a second great change\r\ncame over Marner\xe2\x80\x99s life, and his history became blent in a singular\r\nmanner with the life of his neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe greatest man in Raveloe was Squire Cass, who lived in the large red\r\nhouse with the handsome flight of stone steps in front and the high\r\nstables behind it, nearly opposite the church. He was only one among\r\nseveral landed parishioners, but he alone was honoured with the title\r\nof Squire; for though Mr. Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s family was also understood to be of\r\ntimeless origin\xe2\x80\x94the Raveloe imagination having never ventured back to\r\nthat fearful blank when there were no Osgoods\xe2\x80\x94still, he merely owned\r\nthe farm he occupied; whereas Squire Cass had a tenant or two, who\r\ncomplained of the game to him quite as if he had been a lord.\r\n\r\nIt was still that glorious war-time which was felt to be a peculiar\r\nfavour of Providence towards the landed interest, and the fall of\r\nprices had not yet come to carry the race of small squires and yeomen\r\ndown that road to ruin for which extravagant habits and bad husbandry\r\nwere plentifully anointing their wheels. I am speaking now in relation\r\nto Raveloe and the parishes that resembled it; for our old-fashioned\r\ncountry life had many different aspects, as all life must have when it\r\nis spread over a various surface, and breathed on variously by\r\nmultitudinous currents, from the winds of heaven to the thoughts of\r\nmen, which are for ever moving and crossing each other with\r\nincalculable results. Raveloe lay low among the bushy trees and the\r\nrutted lanes, aloof from the currents of industrial energy and Puritan\r\nearnestness: the rich ate and drank freely, accepting gout and apoplexy\r\nas things that ran mysteriously in respectable families, and the poor\r\nthought that the rich were entirely in the right of it to lead a jolly\r\nlife; besides, their feasting caused a multiplication of orts, which\r\nwere the heirlooms of the poor. Betty Jay scented the boiling of Squire\r\nCass\xe2\x80\x99s hams, but her longing was arrested by the unctuous liquor in\r\nwhich they were boiled; and when the seasons brought round the great\r\nmerry-makings, they were regarded on all hands as a fine thing for the\r\npoor. For the Raveloe feasts were like the rounds of beef and the\r\nbarrels of ale\xe2\x80\x94they were on a large scale, and lasted a good while,\r\nespecially in the winter-time. After ladies had packed up their best\r\ngowns and top-knots in bandboxes, and had incurred the risk of fording\r\nstreams on pillions with the precious burden in rainy or snowy weather,\r\nwhen there was no knowing how high the water would rise, it was not to\r\nbe supposed that they looked forward to a brief pleasure. On this\r\nground it was always contrived in the dark seasons, when there was\r\nlittle work to be done, and the hours were long, that several\r\nneighbours should keep open house in succession. So soon as Squire\r\nCass\xe2\x80\x99s standing dishes diminished in plenty and freshness, his guests\r\nhad nothing to do but to walk a little higher up the village to Mr.\r\nOsgood\xe2\x80\x99s, at the Orchards, and they found hams and chines uncut,\r\npork-pies with the scent of the fire in them, spun butter in all its\r\nfreshness\xe2\x80\x94everything, in fact, that appetites at leisure could desire,\r\nin perhaps greater perfection, though not in greater abundance, than at\r\nSquire Cass\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nFor the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s wife had died long ago, and the Red House was without\r\nthat presence of the wife and mother which is the fountain of wholesome\r\nlove and fear in parlour and kitchen; and this helped to account not\r\nonly for there being more profusion than finished excellence in the\r\nholiday provisions, but also for the frequency with which the proud\r\nSquire condescended to preside in the parlour of the Rainbow rather\r\nthan under the shadow of his own dark wainscot; perhaps, also, for the\r\nfact that his sons had turned out rather ill. Raveloe was not a place\r\nwhere moral censure was severe, but it was thought a weakness in the\r\nSquire that he had kept all his sons at home in idleness; and though\r\nsome licence was to be allowed to young men whose fathers could afford\r\nit, people shook their heads at the courses of the second son, Dunstan,\r\ncommonly called Dunsey Cass, whose taste for swopping and betting might\r\nturn out to be a sowing of something worse than wild oats. To be sure,\r\nthe neighbours said, it was no matter what became of Dunsey\xe2\x80\x94a spiteful\r\njeering fellow, who seemed to enjoy his drink the more when other\r\npeople went dry\xe2\x80\x94always provided that his doings did not bring trouble\r\non a family like Squire Cass\xe2\x80\x99s, with a monument in the church, and\r\ntankards older than King George. But it would be a thousand pities if\r\nMr. Godfrey, the eldest, a fine open-faced good-natured young man who\r\nwas to come into the land some day, should take to going along the same\r\nroad with his brother, as he had seemed to do of late. If he went on in\r\nthat way, he would lose Miss Nancy Lammeter; for it was well known that\r\nshe had looked very shyly on him ever since last Whitsuntide\r\ntwelvemonth, when there was so much talk about his being away from home\r\ndays and days together. There was something wrong, more than\r\ncommon\xe2\x80\x94that was quite clear; for Mr. Godfrey didn\xe2\x80\x99t look half so\r\nfresh-coloured and open as he used to do. At one time everybody was\r\nsaying, What a handsome couple he and Miss Nancy Lammeter would make!\r\nand if she could come to be mistress at the Red House, there would be a\r\nfine change, for the Lammeters had been brought up in that way, that\r\nthey never suffered a pinch of salt to be wasted, and yet everybody in\r\ntheir household had of the best, according to his place. Such a\r\ndaughter-in-law would be a saving to the old Squire, if she never\r\nbrought a penny to her fortune; for it was to be feared that,\r\nnotwithstanding his incomings, there were more holes in his pocket than\r\nthe one where he put his own hand in. But if Mr. Godfrey didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn\r\nover a new leaf, he might say \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye\xe2\x80\x9d to Miss Nancy Lammeter.\r\n\r\nIt was the once hopeful Godfrey who was standing, with his hands in his\r\nside-pockets and his back to the fire, in the dark wainscoted parlour,\r\none late November afternoon in that fifteenth year of Silas Marner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife at Raveloe. The fading grey light fell dimly on the walls\r\ndecorated with guns, whips, and foxes\xe2\x80\x99 brushes, on coats and hats flung\r\non the chairs, on tankards sending forth a scent of flat ale, and on a\r\nhalf-choked fire, with pipes propped up in the chimney-corners: signs\r\nof a domestic life destitute of any hallowing charm, with which the\r\nlook of gloomy vexation on Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s blond face was in sad accordance.\r\nHe seemed to be waiting and listening for some one\xe2\x80\x99s approach, and\r\npresently the sound of a heavy step, with an accompanying whistle, was\r\nheard across the large empty entrance-hall.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and a thick-set, heavy-looking young man entered, with\r\nthe flushed face and the gratuitously elated bearing which mark the\r\nfirst stage of intoxication. It was Dunsey, and at the sight of him\r\nGodfrey\xe2\x80\x99s face parted with some of its gloom to take on the more active\r\nexpression of hatred. The handsome brown spaniel that lay on the hearth\r\nretreated under the chair in the chimney-corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Master Godfrey, what do you want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunsey, in a\r\nmocking tone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re my elders and betters, you know; I was obliged to\r\ncome when you sent for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this is what I want\xe2\x80\x94and just shake yourself sober and listen,\r\nwill you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, savagely. He had himself been drinking more\r\nthan was good for him, trying to turn his gloom into uncalculating\r\nanger. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you, I must hand over that rent of Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nthe Squire, or else tell him I gave it you; for he\xe2\x80\x99s threatening to\r\ndistrain for it, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll all be out soon, whether I tell him or not.\r\nHe said, just now, before he went out, he should send word to Cox to\r\ndistrain, if Fowler didn\xe2\x80\x99t come and pay up his arrears this week. The\r\nSquire\xe2\x80\x99s short o\xe2\x80\x99 cash, and in no humour to stand any nonsense; and you\r\nknow what he threatened, if ever he found you making away with his\r\nmoney again. So, see and get the money, and pretty quickly, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunsey, sneeringly, coming nearer to his brother and looking\r\nin his face. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose, now, you get the money yourself, and save me the\r\ntrouble, eh? Since you was so kind as to hand it over to me, you\xe2\x80\x99ll not\r\nrefuse me the kindness to pay it back for me: it was your brotherly\r\nlove made you do it, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey bit his lips and clenched his fist. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t come near me with\r\nthat look, else I\xe2\x80\x99ll knock you down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, you won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunsey, turning away on his heel, however.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99m such a good-natured brother, you know. I might get you\r\nturned out of house and home, and cut off with a shilling any day. I\r\nmight tell the Squire how his handsome son was married to that nice\r\nyoung woman, Molly Farren, and was very unhappy because he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlive with his drunken wife, and I should slip into your place as\r\ncomfortable as could be. But you see, I don\xe2\x80\x99t do it\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m so easy and\r\ngood-natured. You\xe2\x80\x99ll take any trouble for me. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get the hundred\r\npounds for me\xe2\x80\x94I know you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I get the money?\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, quivering. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nshilling to bless myself with. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a lie that you\xe2\x80\x99d slip into my\r\nplace: you\xe2\x80\x99d get yourself turned out too, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. For if you begin\r\ntelling tales, I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow. Bob\xe2\x80\x99s my father\xe2\x80\x99s favourite\xe2\x80\x94you know that\r\nvery well. He\xe2\x80\x99d only think himself well rid of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunsey, nodding his head sideways as he looked out\r\nof the window. \xe2\x80\x9cIt \xe2\x80\x99ud be very pleasant to me to go in your\r\ncompany\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re such a handsome brother, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve always been so fond\r\nof quarrelling with one another, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do without\r\nyou. But you\xe2\x80\x99d like better for us both to stay at home together; I know\r\nyou would. So you\xe2\x80\x99ll manage to get that little sum o\xe2\x80\x99 money, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbid you good-bye, though I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDunstan was moving off, but Godfrey rushed after him and seized him by\r\nthe arm, saying, with an oath\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, I have no money: I can get no money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBorrow of old Kimble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, he won\xe2\x80\x99t lend me any more, and I shan\xe2\x80\x99t ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, sell Wildfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s easy talking. I must have the money directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to ride him to the hunt to-morrow. There\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nBryce and Keating there, for sure. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get more bids than one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay, and get back home at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, splashed up to the\r\nchin. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Mrs. Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s birthday dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunsey, turning his head on one side, and trying to speak\r\nin a small mincing treble. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s sweet Miss Nancy coming; and we\r\nshall dance with her, and promise never to be naughty again, and be\r\ntaken into favour, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue about Miss Nancy, you fool,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, turning\r\nred, \xe2\x80\x9celse I\xe2\x80\x99ll throttle you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunsey, still in an artificial tone, but taking a whip\r\nfrom the table and beating the butt-end of it on his palm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\nvery good chance. I\xe2\x80\x99d advise you to creep up her sleeve again: it \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nbe saving time, if Molly should happen to take a drop too much laudanum\r\nsome day, and make a widower of you. Miss Nancy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being a\r\nsecond, if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it. And you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good-natured brother,\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99ll keep your secret well, because you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so very obliging to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, quivering, and pale again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy patience is pretty near at an end. If you\xe2\x80\x99d a little more sharpness\r\nin you, you might know that you may urge a man a bit too far, and make\r\none leap as easy as another. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know but what it is so now: I may\r\nas well tell the Squire everything myself\xe2\x80\x94I should get you off my back,\r\nif I got nothing else. And, after all, he\xe2\x80\x99ll know some time. She\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nthreatening to come herself and tell him. So, don\xe2\x80\x99t flatter yourself\r\nthat your secrecy\xe2\x80\x99s worth any price you choose to ask. You drain me of\r\nmoney till I have got nothing to pacify _her_ with, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll do as\r\nshe threatens some day. It\xe2\x80\x99s all one. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell my father everything\r\nmyself, and you may go to the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDunsey perceived that he had overshot his mark, and that there was a\r\npoint at which even the hesitating Godfrey might be driven into\r\ndecision. But he said, with an air of unconcern\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a draught of ale first.\xe2\x80\x9d And ringing the\r\nbell, he threw himself across two chairs, and began to rap the\r\nwindow-seat with the handle of his whip.\r\n\r\nGodfrey stood, still with his back to the fire, uneasily moving his\r\nfingers among the contents of his side-pockets, and looking at the\r\nfloor. That big muscular frame of his held plenty of animal courage,\r\nbut helped him to no decision when the dangers to be braved were such\r\nas could neither be knocked down nor throttled. His natural\r\nirresolution and moral cowardice were exaggerated by a position in\r\nwhich dreaded consequences seemed to press equally on all sides, and\r\nhis irritation had no sooner provoked him to defy Dunstan and\r\nanticipate all possible betrayals, than the miseries he must bring on\r\nhimself by such a step seemed more unendurable to him than the present\r\nevil. The results of confession were not contingent, they were certain;\r\nwhereas betrayal was not certain. From the near vision of that\r\ncertainty he fell back on suspense and vacillation with a sense of\r\nrepose. The disinherited son of a small squire, equally disinclined to\r\ndig and to beg, was almost as helpless as an uprooted tree, which, by\r\nthe favour of earth and sky, has grown to a handsome bulk on the spot\r\nwhere it first shot upward. Perhaps it would have been possible to\r\nthink of digging with some cheerfulness if Nancy Lammeter were to be\r\nwon on those terms; but, since he must irrevocably lose _her_ as well\r\nas the inheritance, and must break every tie but the one that degraded\r\nhim and left him without motive for trying to recover his better self,\r\nhe could imagine no future for himself on the other side of confession\r\nbut that of \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99listing for a soldier\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the most desperate step, short of\r\nsuicide, in the eyes of respectable families. No! he would rather trust\r\nto casualties than to his own resolve\xe2\x80\x94rather go on sitting at the\r\nfeast, and sipping the wine he loved, though with the sword hanging\r\nover him and terror in his heart, than rush away into the cold darkness\r\nwhere there was no pleasure left. The utmost concession to Dunstan\r\nabout the horse began to seem easy, compared with the fulfilment of his\r\nown threat. But his pride would not let him recommence the conversation\r\notherwise than by continuing the quarrel. Dunstan was waiting for this,\r\nand took his ale in shorter draughts than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just like you,\xe2\x80\x9d Godfrey burst out, in a bitter tone, \xe2\x80\x9cto talk\r\nabout my selling Wildfire in that cool way\xe2\x80\x94the last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\ncall my own, and the best bit of horse-flesh I ever had in my life. And\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99d got a spark of pride in you, you\xe2\x80\x99d be ashamed to see the\r\nstables emptied, and everybody sneering about it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s my belief\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d sell yourself, if it was only for the pleasure of making somebody\r\nfeel he\xe2\x80\x99d got a bad bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunstan, very placably, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do me justice, I see. You\r\nknow I\xe2\x80\x99m a jewel for \xe2\x80\x99ticing people into bargains. For which reason I\r\nadvise you to let _me_ sell Wildfire. I\xe2\x80\x99d ride him to the hunt\r\nto-morrow for you, with pleasure. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look so handsome as you\r\nin the saddle, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the horse they\xe2\x80\x99ll bid for, and not the rider.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I daresay\xe2\x80\x94trust my horse to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunstan, rapping the window-seat again with an\r\nair of great unconcern. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _you_ have got to pay Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s money;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s none of my business. You received the money from him when you went\r\nto Bramcote, and _you_ told the Squire it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t paid. I\xe2\x80\x99d nothing to\r\ndo with that; you chose to be so obliging as to give it me, that was\r\nall. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pay the money, let it alone; it\xe2\x80\x99s all one to\r\nme. But I was willing to accommodate you by undertaking to sell the\r\nhorse, seeing it\xe2\x80\x99s not convenient to you to go so far to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey was silent for some moments. He would have liked to spring on\r\nDunstan, wrench the whip from his hand, and flog him to within an inch\r\nof his life; and no bodily fear could have deterred him; but he was\r\nmastered by another sort of fear, which was fed by feelings stronger\r\neven than his resentment. When he spoke again, it was in a\r\nhalf-conciliatory tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you mean no nonsense about the horse, eh? You\xe2\x80\x99ll sell him all\r\nfair, and hand over the money? If you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you know, everything \xe2\x80\x99ull\r\ngo to smash, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing else to trust to. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nless pleasure in pulling the house over my head, when your own skull\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto be broken too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunstan, rising; \xe2\x80\x9call right. I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d come\r\nround. I\xe2\x80\x99m the fellow to bring old Bryce up to the scratch. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nyou a hundred and twenty for him, if I get you a penny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99ll perhaps rain cats and dogs to-morrow, as it did yesterday,\r\nand then you can\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, hardly knowing whether he wished\r\nfor that obstacle or not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot _it_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunstan. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m always lucky in my weather. It might\r\nrain if you wanted to go yourself. You never hold trumps, you know\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nalways do. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got the beauty, you see, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the luck, so\r\nyou must keep me by you for your crooked sixpence; you\xe2\x80\x99ll _ne_-ver get\r\nalong without me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound you, hold your tongue!\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, impetuously. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd take\r\ncare to keep sober to-morrow, else you\xe2\x80\x99ll get pitched on your head\r\ncoming home, and Wildfire might be the worse for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake your tender heart easy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunstan, opening the door. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nnever knew me see double when I\xe2\x80\x99d got a bargain to make; it \xe2\x80\x99ud spoil\r\nthe fun. Besides, whenever I fall, I\xe2\x80\x99m warranted to fall on my legs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, Dunstan slammed the door behind him, and left Godfrey to\r\nthat bitter rumination on his personal circumstances which was now\r\nunbroken from day to day save by the excitement of sporting, drinking,\r\ncard-playing, or the rarer and less oblivious pleasure of seeing Miss\r\nNancy Lammeter. The subtle and varied pains springing from the higher\r\nsensibility that accompanies higher culture, are perhaps less pitiable\r\nthan that dreary absence of impersonal enjoyment and consolation which\r\nleaves ruder minds to the perpetual urgent companionship of their own\r\ngriefs and discontents. The lives of those rural forefathers, whom we\r\nare apt to think very prosaic figures\xe2\x80\x94men whose only work was to ride\r\nround their land, getting heavier and heavier in their saddles, and who\r\npassed the rest of their days in the half-listless gratification of\r\nsenses dulled by monotony\xe2\x80\x94had a certain pathos in them nevertheless.\r\nCalamities came to _them_ too, and their early errors carried hard\r\nconsequences: perhaps the love of some sweet maiden, the image of\r\npurity, order, and calm, had opened their eyes to the vision of a life\r\nin which the days would not seem too long, even without rioting; but\r\nthe maiden was lost, and the vision passed away, and then what was left\r\nto them, especially when they had become too heavy for the hunt, or for\r\ncarrying a gun over the furrows, but to drink and get merry, or to\r\ndrink and get angry, so that they might be independent of variety, and\r\nsay over again with eager emphasis the things they had said already any\r\ntime that twelvemonth? Assuredly, among these flushed and dull-eyed men\r\nthere were some whom\xe2\x80\x94thanks to their native human-kindness\xe2\x80\x94even riot\r\ncould never drive into brutality; men who, when their cheeks were\r\nfresh, had felt the keen point of sorrow or remorse, had been pierced\r\nby the reeds they leaned on, or had lightly put their limbs in fetters\r\nfrom which no struggle could loose them; and under these sad\r\ncircumstances, common to us all, their thoughts could find no\r\nresting-place outside the ever-trodden round of their own petty\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThat, at least, was the condition of Godfrey Cass in this\r\nsix-and-twentieth year of his life. A movement of compunction, helped\r\nby those small indefinable influences which every personal relation\r\nexerts on a pliant nature, had urged him into a secret marriage, which\r\nwas a blight on his life. It was an ugly story of low passion,\r\ndelusion, and waking from delusion, which needs not to be dragged from\r\nthe privacy of Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s bitter memory. He had long known that the\r\ndelusion was partly due to a trap laid for him by Dunstan, who saw in\r\nhis brother\xe2\x80\x99s degrading marriage the means of gratifying at once his\r\njealous hate and his cupidity. And if Godfrey could have felt himself\r\nsimply a victim, the iron bit that destiny had put into his mouth would\r\nhave chafed him less intolerably. If the curses he muttered half aloud\r\nwhen he was alone had had no other object than Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s diabolical\r\ncunning, he might have shrunk less from the consequences of avowal. But\r\nhe had something else to curse\xe2\x80\x94his own vicious folly, which now seemed\r\nas mad and unaccountable to him as almost all our follies and vices do\r\nwhen their promptings have long passed away. For four years he had\r\nthought of Nancy Lammeter, and wooed her with tacit patient worship, as\r\nthe woman who made him think of the future with joy: she would be his\r\nwife, and would make home lovely to him, as his father\xe2\x80\x99s home had never\r\nbeen; and it would be easy, when she was always near, to shake off\r\nthose foolish habits that were no pleasures, but only a feverish way of\r\nannulling vacancy. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s was an essentially domestic nature, bred\r\nup in a home where the hearth had no smiles, and where the daily habits\r\nwere not chastised by the presence of household order. His easy\r\ndisposition made him fall in unresistingly with the family courses, but\r\nthe need of some tender permanent affection, the longing for some\r\ninfluence that would make the good he preferred easy to pursue, caused\r\nthe neatness, purity, and liberal orderliness of the Lammeter\r\nhousehold, sunned by the smile of Nancy, to seem like those fresh\r\nbright hours of the morning when temptations go to sleep and leave the\r\near open to the voice of the good angel, inviting to industry,\r\nsobriety, and peace. And yet the hope of this paradise had not been\r\nenough to save him from a course which shut him out of it for ever.\r\nInstead of keeping fast hold of the strong silken rope by which Nancy\r\nwould have drawn him safe to the green banks where it was easy to step\r\nfirmly, he had let himself be dragged back into mud and slime, in which\r\nit was useless to struggle. He had made ties for himself which robbed\r\nhim of all wholesome motive, and were a constant exasperation.\r\n\r\nStill, there was one position worse than the present: it was the\r\nposition he would be in when the ugly secret was disclosed; and the\r\ndesire that continually triumphed over every other was that of warding\r\noff the evil day, when he would have to bear the consequences of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s violent resentment for the wound inflicted on his family\r\npride\xe2\x80\x94would have, perhaps, to turn his back on that hereditary ease and\r\ndignity which, after all, was a sort of reason for living, and would\r\ncarry with him the certainty that he was banished for ever from the\r\nsight and esteem of Nancy Lammeter. The longer the interval, the more\r\nchance there was of deliverance from some, at least, of the hateful\r\nconsequences to which he had sold himself; the more opportunities\r\nremained for him to snatch the strange gratification of seeing Nancy,\r\nand gathering some faint indications of her lingering regard. Towards\r\nthis gratification he was impelled, fitfully, every now and then, after\r\nhaving passed weeks in which he had avoided her as the far-off\r\nbright-winged prize that only made him spring forward and find his\r\nchain all the more galling. One of those fits of yearning was on him\r\nnow, and it would have been strong enough to have persuaded him to\r\ntrust Wildfire to Dunstan rather than disappoint the yearning, even if\r\nhe had not had another reason for his disinclination towards the\r\nmorrow\xe2\x80\x99s hunt. That other reason was the fact that the morning\xe2\x80\x99s meet\r\nwas near Batherley, the market-town where the unhappy woman lived,\r\nwhose image became more odious to him every day; and to his thought the\r\nwhole vicinage was haunted by her. The yoke a man creates for himself\r\nby wrong-doing will breed hate in the kindliest nature; and the\r\ngood-humoured, affectionate-hearted Godfrey Cass was fast becoming a\r\nbitter man, visited by cruel wishes, that seemed to enter, and depart,\r\nand enter again, like demons who had found in him a ready-garnished\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nWhat was he to do this evening to pass the time? He might as well go to\r\nthe Rainbow, and hear the talk about the cock-fighting: everybody was\r\nthere, and what else was there to be done? Though, for his own part, he\r\ndid not care a button for cock-fighting. Snuff, the brown spaniel, who\r\nhad placed herself in front of him, and had been watching him for some\r\ntime, now jumped up in impatience for the expected caress. But Godfrey\r\nthrust her away without looking at her, and left the room, followed\r\nhumbly by the unresenting Snuff\xe2\x80\x94perhaps because she saw no other career\r\nopen to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDunstan Cass, setting off in the raw morning, at the judiciously quiet\r\npace of a man who is obliged to ride to cover on his hunter, had to\r\ntake his way along the lane which, at its farther extremity, passed by\r\nthe piece of unenclosed ground called the Stone-pit, where stood the\r\ncottage, once a stone-cutter\xe2\x80\x99s shed, now for fifteen years inhabited by\r\nSilas Marner. The spot looked very dreary at this season, with the\r\nmoist trodden clay about it, and the red, muddy water high up in the\r\ndeserted quarry. That was Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s first thought as he approached it;\r\nthe second was, that the old fool of a weaver, whose loom he heard\r\nrattling already, had a great deal of money hidden somewhere. How was\r\nit that he, Dunstan Cass, who had often heard talk of Marner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmiserliness, had never thought of suggesting to Godfrey that he should\r\nfrighten or persuade the old fellow into lending the money on the\r\nexcellent security of the young Squire\xe2\x80\x99s prospects? The resource\r\noccurred to him now as so easy and agreeable, especially as Marner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhoard was likely to be large enough to leave Godfrey a handsome surplus\r\nbeyond his immediate needs, and enable him to accommodate his faithful\r\nbrother, that he had almost turned the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head towards home again.\r\nGodfrey would be ready enough to accept the suggestion: he would snatch\r\neagerly at a plan that might save him from parting with Wildfire. But\r\nwhen Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s meditation reached this point, the inclination to go on\r\ngrew strong and prevailed. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to give Godfrey that\r\npleasure: he preferred that Master Godfrey should be vexed. Moreover,\r\nDunstan enjoyed the self-important consciousness of having a horse to\r\nsell, and the opportunity of driving a bargain, swaggering, and\r\npossibly taking somebody in. He might have all the satisfaction\r\nattendant on selling his brother\xe2\x80\x99s horse, and not the less have the\r\nfurther satisfaction of setting Godfrey to borrow Marner\xe2\x80\x99s money. So he\r\nrode on to cover.\r\n\r\nBryce and Keating were there, as Dunstan was quite sure they would\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94he was such a lucky fellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeyday!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bryce, who had long had his eye on Wildfire, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re on\r\nyour brother\xe2\x80\x99s horse to-day: how\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve swopped with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunstan, whose delight in lying,\r\ngrandly independent of utility, was not to be diminished by the\r\nlikelihood that his hearer would not believe him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWildfire\xe2\x80\x99s mine now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! has he swopped with you for that big-boned hack of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBryce, quite aware that he should get another lie in answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there was a little account between us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunsey, carelessly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand Wildfire made it even. I accommodated him by taking the horse,\r\nthough it was against my will, for I\xe2\x80\x99d got an itch for a mare o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nJortin\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94as rare a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 blood as ever you threw your leg across. But\r\nI shall keep Wildfire, now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got him, though I\xe2\x80\x99d a bid of a hundred\r\nand fifty for him the other day, from a man over at Flitton\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s buying\r\nfor Lord Cromleck\xe2\x80\x94a fellow with a cast in his eye, and a green\r\nwaistcoat. But I mean to stick to Wildfire: I shan\xe2\x80\x99t get a better at a\r\nfence in a hurry. The mare\xe2\x80\x99s got more blood, but she\xe2\x80\x99s a bit too weak\r\nin the hind-quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBryce of course divined that Dunstan wanted to sell the horse, and\r\nDunstan knew that he divined it (horse-dealing is only one of many\r\nhuman transactions carried on in this ingenious manner); and they both\r\nconsidered that the bargain was in its first stage, when Bryce replied\r\nironically\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder at that now; I wonder you mean to keep him; for I never heard\r\nof a man who didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to sell his horse getting a bid of half as\r\nmuch again as the horse was worth. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be lucky if you get a\r\nhundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKeating rode up now, and the transaction became more complicated. It\r\nended in the purchase of the horse by Bryce for a hundred and twenty,\r\nto be paid on the delivery of Wildfire, safe and sound, at the\r\nBatherley stables. It did occur to Dunsey that it might be wise for him\r\nto give up the day\xe2\x80\x99s hunting, proceed at once to Batherley, and, having\r\nwaited for Bryce\xe2\x80\x99s return, hire a horse to carry him home with the\r\nmoney in his pocket. But the inclination for a run, encouraged by\r\nconfidence in his luck, and by a draught of brandy from his\r\npocket-pistol at the conclusion of the bargain, was not easy to\r\novercome, especially with a horse under him that would take the fences\r\nto the admiration of the field. Dunstan, however, took one fence too\r\nmany, and got his horse pierced with a hedge-stake. His own\r\nill-favoured person, which was quite unmarketable, escaped without\r\ninjury; but poor Wildfire, unconscious of his price, turned on his\r\nflank and painfully panted his last. It happened that Dunstan, a short\r\ntime before, having had to get down to arrange his stirrup, had\r\nmuttered a good many curses at this interruption, which had thrown him\r\nin the rear of the hunt near the moment of glory, and under this\r\nexasperation had taken the fences more blindly. He would soon have been\r\nup with the hounds again, when the fatal accident happened; and hence\r\nhe was between eager riders in advance, not troubling themselves about\r\nwhat happened behind them, and far-off stragglers, who were as likely\r\nas not to pass quite aloof from the line of road in which Wildfire had\r\nfallen. Dunstan, whose nature it was to care more for immediate\r\nannoyances than for remote consequences, no sooner recovered his legs,\r\nand saw that it was all over with Wildfire, than he felt a satisfaction\r\nat the absence of witnesses to a position which no swaggering could\r\nmake enviable. Reinforcing himself, after his shake, with a little\r\nbrandy and much swearing, he walked as fast as he could to a coppice on\r\nhis right hand, through which it occurred to him that he could make his\r\nway to Batherley without danger of encountering any member of the hunt.\r\nHis first intention was to hire a horse there and ride home forthwith,\r\nfor to walk many miles without a gun in his hand, and along an ordinary\r\nroad, was as much out of the question to him as to other spirited young\r\nmen of his kind. He did not much mind about taking the bad news to\r\nGodfrey, for he had to offer him at the same time the resource of\r\nMarner\xe2\x80\x99s money; and if Godfrey kicked, as he always did, at the notion\r\nof making a fresh debt from which he himself got the smallest share of\r\nadvantage, why, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kick long: Dunstan felt sure he could worry\r\nGodfrey into anything. The idea of Marner\xe2\x80\x99s money kept growing in\r\nvividness, now the want of it had become immediate; the prospect of\r\nhaving to make his appearance with the muddy boots of a pedestrian at\r\nBatherley, and to encounter the grinning queries of stablemen, stood\r\nunpleasantly in the way of his impatience to be back at Raveloe and\r\ncarry out his felicitous plan; and a casual visitation of his\r\nwaistcoat-pocket, as he was ruminating, awakened his memory to the fact\r\nthat the two or three small coins his forefinger encountered there were\r\nof too pale a colour to cover that small debt, without payment of which\r\nthe stable-keeper had declared he would never do any more business with\r\nDunsey Cass. After all, according to the direction in which the run had\r\nbrought him, he was not so very much farther from home than he was from\r\nBatherley; but Dunsey, not being remarkable for clearness of head, was\r\nonly led to this conclusion by the gradual perception that there were\r\nother reasons for choosing the unprecedented course of walking home. It\r\nwas now nearly four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and a mist was gathering: the sooner he\r\ngot into the road the better. He remembered having crossed the road and\r\nseen the finger-post only a little while before Wildfire broke down;\r\nso, buttoning his coat, twisting the lash of his hunting-whip compactly\r\nround the handle, and rapping the tops of his boots with a\r\nself-possessed air, as if to assure himself that he was not at all\r\ntaken by surprise, he set off with the sense that he was undertaking a\r\nremarkable feat of bodily exertion, which somehow and at some time he\r\nshould be able to dress up and magnify to the admiration of a select\r\ncircle at the Rainbow. When a young gentleman like Dunsey is reduced to\r\nso exceptional a mode of locomotion as walking, a whip in his hand is a\r\ndesirable corrective to a too bewildering dreamy sense of unwontedness\r\nin his position; and Dunstan, as he went along through the gathering\r\nmist, was always rapping his whip somewhere. It was Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s whip,\r\nwhich he had chosen to take without leave because it had a gold handle;\r\nof course no one could see, when Dunstan held it, that the name\r\n_Godfrey Cass_ was cut in deep letters on that gold handle\xe2\x80\x94they could\r\nonly see that it was a very handsome whip. Dunsey was not without fear\r\nthat he might meet some acquaintance in whose eyes he would cut a\r\npitiable figure, for mist is no screen when people get close to each\r\nother; but when he at last found himself in the well-known Raveloe\r\nlanes without having met a soul, he silently remarked that that was\r\npart of his usual good luck. But now the mist, helped by the evening\r\ndarkness, was more of a screen than he desired, for it hid the ruts\r\ninto which his feet were liable to slip\xe2\x80\x94hid everything, so that he had\r\nto guide his steps by dragging his whip along the low bushes in advance\r\nof the hedgerow. He must soon, he thought, be getting near the opening\r\nat the Stone-pits: he should find it out by the break in the hedgerow.\r\nHe found it out, however, by another circumstance which he had not\r\nexpected\xe2\x80\x94namely, by certain gleams of light, which he presently guessed\r\nto proceed from Silas Marner\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. That cottage and the money\r\nhidden within it had been in his mind continually during his walk, and\r\nhe had been imagining ways of cajoling and tempting the weaver to part\r\nwith the immediate possession of his money for the sake of receiving\r\ninterest. Dunstan felt as if there must be a little frightening added\r\nto the cajolery, for his own arithmetical convictions were not clear\r\nenough to afford him any forcible demonstration as to the advantages of\r\ninterest; and as for security, he regarded it vaguely as a means of\r\ncheating a man by making him believe that he would be paid. Altogether,\r\nthe operation on the miser\xe2\x80\x99s mind was a task that Godfrey would be sure\r\nto hand over to his more daring and cunning brother: Dunstan had made\r\nup his mind to that; and by the time he saw the light gleaming through\r\nthe chinks of Marner\xe2\x80\x99s shutters, the idea of a dialogue with the weaver\r\nhad become so familiar to him, that it occurred to him as quite a\r\nnatural thing to make the acquaintance forthwith. There might be\r\nseveral conveniences attending this course: the weaver had possibly got\r\na lantern, and Dunstan was tired of feeling his way. He was still\r\nnearly three-quarters of a mile from home, and the lane was becoming\r\nunpleasantly slippery, for the mist was passing into rain. He turned up\r\nthe bank, not without some fear lest he might miss the right way, since\r\nhe was not certain whether the light were in front or on the side of\r\nthe cottage. But he felt the ground before him cautiously with his\r\nwhip-handle, and at last arrived safely at the door. He knocked loudly,\r\nrather enjoying the idea that the old fellow would be frightened at the\r\nsudden noise. He heard no movement in reply: all was silence in the\r\ncottage. Was the weaver gone to bed, then? If so, why had he left a\r\nlight? That was a strange forgetfulness in a miser. Dunstan knocked\r\nstill more loudly, and, without pausing for a reply, pushed his fingers\r\nthrough the latch-hole, intending to shake the door and pull the\r\nlatch-string up and down, not doubting that the door was fastened. But,\r\nto his surprise, at this double motion the door opened, and he found\r\nhimself in front of a bright fire which lit up every corner of the\r\ncottage\xe2\x80\x94the bed, the loom, the three chairs, and the table\xe2\x80\x94and showed\r\nhim that Marner was not there.\r\n\r\nNothing at that moment could be much more inviting to Dunsey than the\r\nbright fire on the brick hearth: he walked in and seated himself by it\r\nat once. There was something in front of the fire, too, that would have\r\nbeen inviting to a hungry man, if it had been in a different stage of\r\ncooking. It was a small bit of pork suspended from the kettle-hanger by\r\na string passed through a large door-key, in a way known to primitive\r\nhousekeepers unpossessed of jacks. But the pork had been hung at the\r\nfarthest extremity of the hanger, apparently to prevent the roasting\r\nfrom proceeding too rapidly during the owner\xe2\x80\x99s absence. The old staring\r\nsimpleton had hot meat for his supper, then? thought Dunstan. People\r\nhad always said he lived on mouldy bread, on purpose to check his\r\nappetite. But where could he be at this time, and on such an evening,\r\nleaving his supper in this stage of preparation, and his door\r\nunfastened? Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s own recent difficulty in making his way suggested\r\nto him that the weaver had perhaps gone outside his cottage to fetch in\r\nfuel, or for some such brief purpose, and had slipped into the\r\nStone-pit. That was an interesting idea to Dunstan, carrying\r\nconsequences of entire novelty. If the weaver was dead, who had a right\r\nto his money? Who would know where his money was hidden? _Who would\r\nknow that anybody had come to take it away?_ He went no farther into\r\nthe subtleties of evidence: the pressing question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere _is_ the\r\nmoney?\xe2\x80\x9d now took such entire possession of him as to make him quite\r\nforget that the weaver\xe2\x80\x99s death was not a certainty. A dull mind, once\r\narriving at an inference that flatters a desire, is rarely able to\r\nretain the impression that the notion from which the inference started\r\nwas purely problematic. And Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s mind was as dull as the mind of a\r\npossible felon usually is. There were only three hiding-places where he\r\nhad ever heard of cottagers\xe2\x80\x99 hoards being found: the thatch, the bed,\r\nand a hole in the floor. Marner\xe2\x80\x99s cottage had no thatch; and Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst act, after a train of thought made rapid by the stimulus of\r\ncupidity, was to go up to the bed; but while he did so, his eyes\r\ntravelled eagerly over the floor, where the bricks, distinct in the\r\nfire-light, were discernible under the sprinkling of sand. But not\r\neverywhere; for there was one spot, and one only, which was quite\r\ncovered with sand, and sand showing the marks of fingers, which had\r\napparently been careful to spread it over a given space. It was near\r\nthe treddles of the loom. In an instant Dunstan darted to that spot,\r\nswept away the sand with his whip, and, inserting the thin end of the\r\nhook between the bricks, found that they were loose. In haste he lifted\r\nup two bricks, and saw what he had no doubt was the object of his\r\nsearch; for what could there be but money in those two leathern bags?\r\nAnd, from their weight, they must be filled with guineas. Dunstan felt\r\nround the hole, to be certain that it held no more; then hastily\r\nreplaced the bricks, and spread the sand over them. Hardly more than\r\nfive minutes had passed since he entered the cottage, but it seemed to\r\nDunstan like a long while; and though he was without any distinct\r\nrecognition of the possibility that Marner might be alive, and might\r\nre-enter the cottage at any moment, he felt an undefinable dread laying\r\nhold on him, as he rose to his feet with the bags in his hand. He would\r\nhasten out into the darkness, and then consider what he should do with\r\nthe bags. He closed the door behind him immediately, that he might shut\r\nin the stream of light: a few steps would be enough to carry him beyond\r\nbetrayal by the gleams from the shutter-chinks and the latch-hole. The\r\nrain and darkness had got thicker, and he was glad of it; though it was\r\nawkward walking with both hands filled, so that it was as much as he\r\ncould do to grasp his whip along with one of the bags. But when he had\r\ngone a yard or two, he might take his time. So he stepped forward into\r\nthe darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWhen Dunstan Cass turned his back on the cottage, Silas Marner was not\r\nmore than a hundred yards away from it, plodding along from the village\r\nwith a sack thrown round his shoulders as an overcoat, and with a horn\r\nlantern in his hand. His legs were weary, but his mind was at ease,\r\nfree from the presentiment of change. The sense of security more\r\nfrequently springs from habit than from conviction, and for this reason\r\nit often subsists after such a change in the conditions as might have\r\nbeen expected to suggest alarm. The lapse of time during which a given\r\nevent has not happened, is, in this logic of habit, constantly alleged\r\nas a reason why the event should never happen, even when the lapse of\r\ntime is precisely the added condition which makes the event imminent. A\r\nman will tell you that he has worked in a mine for forty years unhurt\r\nby an accident as a reason why he should apprehend no danger, though\r\nthe roof is beginning to sink; and it is often observable, that the\r\nolder a man gets, the more difficult it is to him to retain a believing\r\nconception of his own death. This influence of habit was necessarily\r\nstrong in a man whose life was so monotonous as Marner\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94who saw no new\r\npeople and heard of no new events to keep alive in him the idea of the\r\nunexpected and the changeful; and it explains simply enough, why his\r\nmind could be at ease, though he had left his house and his treasure\r\nmore defenceless than usual. Silas was thinking with double complacency\r\nof his supper: first, because it would be hot and savoury; and\r\nsecondly, because it would cost him nothing. For the little bit of pork\r\nwas a present from that excellent housewife, Miss Priscilla Lammeter,\r\nto whom he had this day carried home a handsome piece of linen; and it\r\nwas only on occasion of a present like this, that Silas indulged\r\nhimself with roast-meat. Supper was his favourite meal, because it came\r\nat his time of revelry, when his heart warmed over his gold; whenever\r\nhe had roast-meat, he always chose to have it for supper. But this\r\nevening, he had no sooner ingeniously knotted his string fast round his\r\nbit of pork, twisted the string according to rule over his door-key,\r\npassed it through the handle, and made it fast on the hanger, than he\r\nremembered that a piece of very fine twine was indispensable to his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csetting up\xe2\x80\x9d a new piece of work in his loom early in the morning. It\r\nhad slipped his memory, because, in coming from Mr. Lammeter\xe2\x80\x99s, he had\r\nnot had to pass through the village; but to lose time by going on\r\nerrands in the morning was out of the question. It was a nasty fog to\r\nturn out into, but there were things Silas loved better than his own\r\ncomfort; so, drawing his pork to the extremity of the hanger, and\r\narming himself with his lantern and his old sack, he set out on what,\r\nin ordinary weather, would have been a twenty minutes\xe2\x80\x99 errand. He could\r\nnot have locked his door without undoing his well-knotted string and\r\nretarding his supper; it was not worth his while to make that\r\nsacrifice. What thief would find his way to the Stone-pits on such a\r\nnight as this? and why should he come on this particular night, when he\r\nhad never come through all the fifteen years before? These questions\r\nwere not distinctly present in Silas\xe2\x80\x99s mind; they merely serve to\r\nrepresent the vaguely-felt foundation of his freedom from anxiety.\r\n\r\nHe reached his door in much satisfaction that his errand was done: he\r\nopened it, and to his short-sighted eyes everything remained as he had\r\nleft it, except that the fire sent out a welcome increase of heat. He\r\ntrod about the floor while putting by his lantern and throwing aside\r\nhis hat and sack, so as to merge the marks of Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s feet on the\r\nsand in the marks of his own nailed boots. Then he moved his pork\r\nnearer to the fire, and sat down to the agreeable business of tending\r\nthe meat and warming himself at the same time.\r\n\r\nAny one who had looked at him as the red light shone upon his pale\r\nface, strange straining eyes, and meagre form, would perhaps have\r\nunderstood the mixture of contemptuous pity, dread, and suspicion with\r\nwhich he was regarded by his neighbours in Raveloe. Yet few men could\r\nbe more harmless than poor Marner. In his truthful simple soul, not\r\neven the growing greed and worship of gold could beget any vice\r\ndirectly injurious to others. The light of his faith quite put out, and\r\nhis affections made desolate, he had clung with all the force of his\r\nnature to his work and his money; and like all objects to which a man\r\ndevotes himself, they had fashioned him into correspondence with\r\nthemselves. His loom, as he wrought in it without ceasing, had in its\r\nturn wrought on him, and confirmed more and more the monotonous craving\r\nfor its monotonous response. His gold, as he hung over it and saw it\r\ngrow, gathered his power of loving together into a hard isolation like\r\nits own.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was warm he began to think it would be a long while to\r\nwait till after supper before he drew out his guineas, and it would be\r\npleasant to see them on the table before him as he ate his unwonted\r\nfeast. For joy is the best of wine, and Silas\xe2\x80\x99s guineas were a golden\r\nwine of that sort.\r\n\r\nHe rose and placed his candle unsuspectingly on the floor near his\r\nloom, swept away the sand without noticing any change, and removed the\r\nbricks. The sight of the empty hole made his heart leap violently, but\r\nthe belief that his gold was gone could not come at once\xe2\x80\x94only terror,\r\nand the eager effort to put an end to the terror. He passed his\r\ntrembling hand all about the hole, trying to think it possible that his\r\neyes had deceived him; then he held the candle in the hole and examined\r\nit curiously, trembling more and more. At last he shook so violently\r\nthat he let fall the candle, and lifted his hands to his head, trying\r\nto steady himself, that he might think. Had he put his gold somewhere\r\nelse, by a sudden resolution last night, and then forgotten it? A man\r\nfalling into dark waters seeks a momentary footing even on sliding\r\nstones; and Silas, by acting as if he believed in false hopes, warded\r\noff the moment of despair. He searched in every corner, he turned his\r\nbed over, and shook it, and kneaded it; he looked in his brick oven\r\nwhere he laid his sticks. When there was no other place to be searched,\r\nhe kneeled down again and felt once more all round the hole. There was\r\nno untried refuge left for a moment\xe2\x80\x99s shelter from the terrible truth.\r\n\r\nYes, there was a sort of refuge which always comes with the prostration\r\nof thought under an overpowering passion: it was that expectation of\r\nimpossibilities, that belief in contradictory images, which is still\r\ndistinct from madness, because it is capable of being dissipated by the\r\nexternal fact. Silas got up from his knees trembling, and looked round\r\nat the table: didn\xe2\x80\x99t the gold lie there after all? The table was bare.\r\nThen he turned and looked behind him\xe2\x80\x94looked all round his dwelling,\r\nseeming to strain his brown eyes after some possible appearance of the\r\nbags where he had already sought them in vain. He could see every\r\nobject in his cottage\xe2\x80\x94and his gold was not there.\r\n\r\nAgain he put his trembling hands to his head, and gave a wild ringing\r\nscream, the cry of desolation. For a few moments after, he stood\r\nmotionless; but the cry had relieved him from the first maddening\r\npressure of the truth. He turned, and tottered towards his loom, and\r\ngot into the seat where he worked, instinctively seeking this as the\r\nstrongest assurance of reality.\r\n\r\nAnd now that all the false hopes had vanished, and the first shock of\r\ncertainty was past, the idea of a thief began to present itself, and he\r\nentertained it eagerly, because a thief might be caught and made to\r\nrestore the gold. The thought brought some new strength with it, and he\r\nstarted from his loom to the door. As he opened it the rain beat in\r\nupon him, for it was falling more and more heavily. There were no\r\nfootsteps to be tracked on such a night\xe2\x80\x94footsteps? When had the thief\r\ncome? During Silas\xe2\x80\x99s absence in the daytime the door had been locked,\r\nand there had been no marks of any inroad on his return by daylight.\r\nAnd in the evening, too, he said to himself, everything was the same as\r\nwhen he had left it. The sand and bricks looked as if they had not been\r\nmoved. _Was_ it a thief who had taken the bags? or was it a cruel power\r\nthat no hands could reach, which had delighted in making him a second\r\ntime desolate? He shrank from this vaguer dread, and fixed his mind\r\nwith struggling effort on the robber with hands, who could be reached\r\nby hands. His thoughts glanced at all the neighbours who had made any\r\nremarks, or asked any questions which he might now regard as a ground\r\nof suspicion. There was Jem Rodney, a known poacher, and otherwise\r\ndisreputable: he had often met Marner in his journeys across the\r\nfields, and had said something jestingly about the weaver\xe2\x80\x99s money; nay,\r\nhe had once irritated Marner, by lingering at the fire when he called\r\nto light his pipe, instead of going about his business. Jem Rodney was\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x94there was ease in the thought. Jem could be found and made to\r\nrestore the money: Marner did not want to punish him, but only to get\r\nback his gold which had gone from him, and left his soul like a forlorn\r\ntraveller on an unknown desert. The robber must be laid hold of.\r\nMarner\xe2\x80\x99s ideas of legal authority were confused, but he felt that he\r\nmust go and proclaim his loss; and the great people in the village\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nclergyman, the constable, and Squire Cass\xe2\x80\x94would make Jem Rodney, or\r\nsomebody else, deliver up the stolen money. He rushed out in the rain,\r\nunder the stimulus of this hope, forgetting to cover his head, not\r\ncaring to fasten his door; for he felt as if he had nothing left to\r\nlose. He ran swiftly, till want of breath compelled him to slacken his\r\npace as he was entering the village at the turning close to the\r\nRainbow.\r\n\r\nThe Rainbow, in Marner\xe2\x80\x99s view, was a place of luxurious resort for rich\r\nand stout husbands, whose wives had superfluous stores of linen; it was\r\nthe place where he was likely to find the powers and dignities of\r\nRaveloe, and where he could most speedily make his loss public. He\r\nlifted the latch, and turned into the bright bar or kitchen on the\r\nright hand, where the less lofty customers of the house were in the\r\nhabit of assembling, the parlour on the left being reserved for the\r\nmore select society in which Squire Cass frequently enjoyed the double\r\npleasure of conviviality and condescension. But the parlour was dark\r\nto-night, the chief personages who ornamented its circle being all at\r\nMrs. Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s birthday dance, as Godfrey Cass was. And in consequence\r\nof this, the party on the high-screened seats in the kitchen was more\r\nnumerous than usual; several personages, who would otherwise have been\r\nadmitted into the parlour and enlarged the opportunity of hectoring and\r\ncondescension for their betters, being content this evening to vary\r\ntheir enjoyment by taking their spirits-and-water where they could\r\nthemselves hector and condescend in company that called for beer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nThe conversation, which was at a high pitch of animation when Silas\r\napproached the door of the Rainbow, had, as usual, been slow and\r\nintermittent when the company first assembled. The pipes began to be\r\npuffed in a silence which had an air of severity; the more important\r\ncustomers, who drank spirits and sat nearest the fire, staring at each\r\nother as if a bet were depending on the first man who winked; while the\r\nbeer-drinkers, chiefly men in fustian jackets and smock-frocks, kept\r\ntheir eyelids down and rubbed their hands across their mouths, as if\r\ntheir draughts of beer were a funereal duty attended with embarrassing\r\nsadness. At last Mr. Snell, the landlord, a man of a neutral\r\ndisposition, accustomed to stand aloof from human differences as those\r\nof beings who were all alike in need of liquor, broke silence, by\r\nsaying in a doubtful tone to his cousin the butcher\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome folks \xe2\x80\x99ud say that was a fine beast you druv in yesterday, Bob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe butcher, a jolly, smiling, red-haired man, was not disposed to\r\nanswer rashly. He gave a few puffs before he spat and replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nthey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be fur wrong, John.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this feeble delusive thaw, the silence set in as severely as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it a red Durham?\xe2\x80\x9d said the farrier, taking up the thread of\r\ndiscourse after the lapse of a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe farrier looked at the landlord, and the landlord looked at the\r\nbutcher, as the person who must take the responsibility of answering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRed it was,\xe2\x80\x9d said the butcher, in his good-humoured husky treble\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand\r\na Durham it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell _me_ who you bought it of,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farrier,\r\nlooking round with some triumph; \xe2\x80\x9cI know who it is has got the red\r\nDurhams o\xe2\x80\x99 this country-side. And she\xe2\x80\x99d a white star on her brow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbet a penny?\xe2\x80\x9d The farrier leaned forward with his hands on his knees as\r\nhe put this question, and his eyes twinkled knowingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; yes\xe2\x80\x94she might,\xe2\x80\x9d said the butcher, slowly, considering that he\r\nwas giving a decided affirmative. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say contrairy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farrier, throwing himself backward\r\nagain, and speaking defiantly; \xe2\x80\x9cif _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know Mr. Lammeter\xe2\x80\x99s cows,\r\nI should like to know who does\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all. And as for the cow you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbought, bargain or no bargain, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the drenching of\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94contradick me who will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe farrier looked fierce, and the mild butcher\xe2\x80\x99s conversational spirit\r\nwas roused a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not for contradicking no man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m for peace and\r\nquietness. Some are for cutting long ribs\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m for cutting \xe2\x80\x99em short\r\nmyself; but _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t quarrel with \xe2\x80\x99em. All I say is, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely\r\ncarkiss\xe2\x80\x94and anybody as was reasonable, it \xe2\x80\x99ud bring tears into their\r\neyes to look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s the cow as I drenched, whatever it is,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the\r\nfarrier, angrily; \xe2\x80\x9cand it was Mr. Lammeter\xe2\x80\x99s cow, else you told a lie\r\nwhen you said it was a red Durham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell no lies,\xe2\x80\x9d said the butcher, with the same mild huskiness as\r\nbefore, \xe2\x80\x9cand I contradick none\xe2\x80\x94not if a man was to swear himself black:\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s no meat o\xe2\x80\x99 mine, nor none o\xe2\x80\x99 my bargains. All I say is, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlovely carkiss. And what I say, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick to; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll quarrel wi\xe2\x80\x99 no\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farrier, with bitter sarcasm, looking at the company\r\ngenerally; \xe2\x80\x9cand p\xe2\x80\x99rhaps you aren\xe2\x80\x99t pig-headed; and p\xe2\x80\x99rhaps you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay the cow was a red Durham; and p\xe2\x80\x99rhaps you didn\xe2\x80\x99t say she\xe2\x80\x99d got a\r\nstar on her brow\xe2\x80\x94stick to that, now you\xe2\x80\x99re at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord; \xe2\x80\x9clet the cow alone. The truth lies\r\natween you: you\xe2\x80\x99re both right and both wrong, as I allays say. And as\r\nfor the cow\xe2\x80\x99s being Mr. Lammeter\xe2\x80\x99s, I say nothing to that; but this I\r\nsay, as the Rainbow\xe2\x80\x99s the Rainbow. And for the matter o\xe2\x80\x99 that, if the\r\ntalk is to be o\xe2\x80\x99 the Lammeters, _you_ know the most upo\xe2\x80\x99 that head, eh,\r\nMr. Macey? You remember when first Mr. Lammeter\xe2\x80\x99s father come into\r\nthese parts, and took the Warrens?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Macey, tailor and parish-clerk, the latter of which functions\r\nrheumatism had of late obliged him to share with a small-featured young\r\nman who sat opposite him, held his white head on one side, and twirled\r\nhis thumbs with an air of complacency, slightly seasoned with\r\ncriticism. He smiled pityingly, in answer to the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, and\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye; I know, I know; but I let other folks talk. I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid by\r\nnow, and gev up to the young uns. Ask them as have been to school at\r\nTarley: they\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt pernouncing; that\xe2\x80\x99s come up since my day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re pointing at me, Mr. Macey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the deputy clerk, with an\r\nair of anxious propriety, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m nowise a man to speak out of my place.\r\nAs the psalm says\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what\xe2\x80\x99s right, nor only so,\r\nBut also practise what I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d keep hold o\xe2\x80\x99 the tune, when it\xe2\x80\x99s set for you;\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99re for prac_tis_ing, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d prac_tise_ that,\xe2\x80\x9d said a large\r\njocose-looking man, an excellent wheelwright in his week-day capacity,\r\nbut on Sundays leader of the choir. He winked, as he spoke, at two of\r\nthe company, who were known officially as the \xe2\x80\x9cbassoon\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckey-bugle\xe2\x80\x9d, in the confidence that he was expressing the sense of the\r\nmusical profession in Raveloe.\r\n\r\nMr. Tookey, the deputy-clerk, who shared the unpopularity common to\r\ndeputies, turned very red, but replied, with careful moderation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nWinthrop, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll bring me any proof as I\xe2\x80\x99m in the wrong, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the\r\nman to say I won\xe2\x80\x99t alter. But there\xe2\x80\x99s people set up their own ears for\r\na standard, and expect the whole choir to follow \xe2\x80\x99em. There may be two\r\nopinions, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey, who felt very well satisfied with this\r\nattack on youthful presumption; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re right there, Tookey: there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nallays two \xe2\x80\x99pinions; there\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x99pinion a man has of himsen, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x99pinion other folks have on him. There\xe2\x80\x99d be two \xe2\x80\x99pinions\r\nabout a cracked bell, if the bell could hear itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Macey,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Tookey, serious amidst the general\r\nlaughter, \xe2\x80\x9cI undertook to partially fill up the office of parish-clerk\r\nby Mr. Crackenthorp\xe2\x80\x99s desire, whenever your infirmities should make you\r\nunfitting; and it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the rights thereof to sing in the choir\xe2\x80\x94else\r\nwhy have you done the same yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but the old gentleman and you are two folks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Winthrop.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s got a gift. Why, the Squire used to invite him to\r\ntake a glass, only to hear him sing the \xe2\x80\x9cRed Rovier\xe2\x80\x9d; didn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Mr.\r\nMacey? It\xe2\x80\x99s a nat\xe2\x80\x99ral gift. There\xe2\x80\x99s my little lad Aaron, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a\r\ngift\xe2\x80\x94he can sing a tune off straight, like a throstle. But as for you,\r\nMaster Tookey, you\xe2\x80\x99d better stick to your \xe2\x80\x9cAmens\xe2\x80\x9d: your voice is well\r\nenough when you keep it up in your nose. It\xe2\x80\x99s your inside as isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nright made for music: it\xe2\x80\x99s no better nor a hollow stalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis kind of unflinching frankness was the most piquant form of joke to\r\nthe company at the Rainbow, and Ben Winthrop\xe2\x80\x99s insult was felt by\r\neverybody to have capped Mr. Macey\xe2\x80\x99s epigram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see what it is plain enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tookey, unable to keep cool\r\nany longer. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a consperacy to turn me out o\xe2\x80\x99 the choir, as I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t share the Christmas money\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s where it is. But I shall\r\nspeak to Mr. Crackenthorp; I\xe2\x80\x99ll not be put upon by no man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, Tookey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Winthrop. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you your share to\r\nkeep out of it\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do. There\xe2\x80\x99s things folks \xe2\x80\x99ud pay to be\r\nrid on, besides varmin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, who felt that paying people for their\r\nabsence was a principle dangerous to society; \xe2\x80\x9ca joke\xe2\x80\x99s a joke. We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall good friends here, I hope. We must give and take. You\xe2\x80\x99re both right\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99re both wrong, as I say. I agree wi\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Macey here, as there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntwo opinions; and if mine was asked, I should say they\xe2\x80\x99re both right.\r\nTookey\xe2\x80\x99s right and Winthrop\xe2\x80\x99s right, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to split the\r\ndifference and make themselves even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe farrier was puffing his pipe rather fiercely, in some contempt at\r\nthis trivial discussion. He had no ear for music himself, and never\r\nwent to church, as being of the medical profession, and likely to be in\r\nrequisition for delicate cows. But the butcher, having music in his\r\nsoul, had listened with a divided desire for Tookey\xe2\x80\x99s defeat and for\r\nthe preservation of the peace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, following up the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s conciliatory view,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re fond of our old clerk; it\xe2\x80\x99s nat\xe2\x80\x99ral, and him used to be such a\r\nsinger, and got a brother as is known for the first fiddler in this\r\ncountry-side. Eh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity but what Solomon lived in our village,\r\nand could give us a tune when we liked; eh, Mr. Macey? I\xe2\x80\x99d keep him in\r\nliver and lights for nothing\xe2\x80\x94that I would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey, in the height of complacency; \xe2\x80\x9cour family\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen known for musicianers as far back as anybody can tell. But them\r\nthings are dying out, as I tell Solomon every time he comes round;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no voices like what there used to be, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody\r\nremembers what we remember, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the old crows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, you remember when first Mr. Lammeter\xe2\x80\x99s father come into these\r\nparts, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mr. Macey?\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, who had now gone through that\r\ncomplimentary process necessary to bring him up to the point of\r\nnarration; \xe2\x80\x9cand a fine old gentleman he was\xe2\x80\x94as fine, and finer nor the\r\nMr. Lammeter as now is. He came from a bit north\xe2\x80\x99ard, so far as I could\r\never make out. But there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody rightly knows about those parts: only\r\nit couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be far north\xe2\x80\x99ard, nor much different from this country, for\r\nhe brought a fine breed o\xe2\x80\x99 sheep with him, so there must be pastures\r\nthere, and everything reasonable. We heared tell as he\xe2\x80\x99d sold his own\r\nland to come and take the Warrens, and that seemed odd for a man as had\r\nland of his own, to come and rent a farm in a strange place. But they\r\nsaid it was along of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s dying; though there\xe2\x80\x99s reasons in things\r\nas nobody knows on\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much what I\xe2\x80\x99ve made out; yet some\r\nfolks are so wise, they\xe2\x80\x99ll find you fifty reasons straight off, and all\r\nthe while the real reason\xe2\x80\x99s winking at \xe2\x80\x99em in the corner, and they\r\nniver see\xe2\x80\x99t. Howsomever, it was soon seen as we\xe2\x80\x99d got a new parish\xe2\x80\x99ner\r\nas know\xe2\x80\x99d the rights and customs o\xe2\x80\x99 things, and kep a good house, and\r\nwas well looked on by everybody. And the young man\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the Mr.\r\nLammeter as now is, for he\xe2\x80\x99d niver a sister\xe2\x80\x94soon begun to court Miss\r\nOsgood, that\xe2\x80\x99s the sister o\xe2\x80\x99 the Mr. Osgood as now is, and a fine\r\nhandsome lass she was\xe2\x80\x94eh, you can\xe2\x80\x99t think\xe2\x80\x94they pretend this young lass\r\nis like her, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the way wi\xe2\x80\x99 people as don\xe2\x80\x99t know what come\r\nbefore \xe2\x80\x99em. _I_ should know, for I helped the old rector, Mr. Drumlow\r\nas was, I helped him marry \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Macey paused; he always gave his narrative in instalments,\r\nexpecting to be questioned according to precedent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, and a partic\xe2\x80\x99lar thing happened, didn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Mr. Macey, so as you\r\nwere likely to remember that marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, in a\r\ncongratulatory tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think there did\xe2\x80\x94a _very_ partic\xe2\x80\x99lar thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey,\r\nnodding sideways. \xe2\x80\x9cFor Mr. Drumlow\xe2\x80\x94poor old gentleman, I was fond on\r\nhim, though he\xe2\x80\x99d got a bit confused in his head, what wi\xe2\x80\x99 age and wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntaking a drop o\xe2\x80\x99 summat warm when the service come of a cold morning.\r\nAnd young Mr. Lammeter, he\xe2\x80\x99d have no way but he must be married in\r\nJaniwary, which, to be sure, \xe2\x80\x99s a unreasonable time to be married in,\r\nfor it isn\xe2\x80\x99t like a christening or a burying, as you can\xe2\x80\x99t help; and so\r\nMr. Drumlow\xe2\x80\x94poor old gentleman, I was fond on him\xe2\x80\x94but when he come to\r\nput the questions, he put \xe2\x80\x99em by the rule o\xe2\x80\x99 contrairy, like, and he\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cWilt thou have this man to thy wedded wife?\xe2\x80\x9d says he, and then\r\nhe says, \xe2\x80\x9cWilt thou have this woman to thy wedded husband?\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\nBut the partic\xe2\x80\x99larest thing of all is, as nobody took any notice on it\r\nbut me, and they answered straight off \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d, like as if it had been me\r\nsaying \xe2\x80\x9cAmen\xe2\x80\x9d i\xe2\x80\x99 the right place, without listening to what went\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _you_ knew what was going on well enough, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mr. Macey?\r\nYou were live enough, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the butcher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey, pausing, and smiling in pity at the\r\nimpotence of his hearer\xe2\x80\x99s imagination\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy, I was all of a tremble: it\r\nwas as if I\xe2\x80\x99d been a coat pulled by the two tails, like; for I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstop the parson, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take upon me to do that; and yet I said to\r\nmyself, I says, \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be fast married, \xe2\x80\x99cause the\r\nwords are contrairy?\xe2\x80\x9d and my head went working like a mill, for I was\r\nallays uncommon for turning things over and seeing all round \xe2\x80\x99em; and I\r\nsays to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cIs\xe2\x80\x99t the meanin\xe2\x80\x99 or the words as makes folks fast i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwedlock?\xe2\x80\x9d For the parson meant right, and the bride and bridegroom\r\nmeant right. But then, when I come to think on it, meanin\xe2\x80\x99 goes but a\r\nlittle way i\xe2\x80\x99 most things, for you may mean to stick things together\r\nand your glue may be bad, and then where are you? And so I says to\r\nmysen, \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t the meanin\xe2\x80\x99, it\xe2\x80\x99s the glue.\xe2\x80\x9d And I was worreted as if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d got three bells to pull at once, when we went into the vestry, and\r\nthey begun to sign their names. But where\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 talking?\xe2\x80\x94you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t think what goes on in a \xe2\x80\x99cute man\xe2\x80\x99s inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you held in for all that, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mr. Macey?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlandlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, I held in tight till I was by mysen wi\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Drumlow, and then I\r\nout wi\xe2\x80\x99 everything, but respectful, as I allays did. And he made light\r\non it, and he says, \xe2\x80\x9cPooh, pooh, Macey, make yourself easy,\xe2\x80\x9d he says;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s neither the meaning nor the words\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the re_ges_ter does\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the glue.\xe2\x80\x9d So you see he settled it easy; for parsons and\r\ndoctors know everything by heart, like, so as they aren\xe2\x80\x99t worreted wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthinking what\xe2\x80\x99s the rights and wrongs o\xe2\x80\x99 things, as I\xe2\x80\x99n been many and\r\nmany\xe2\x80\x99s the time. And sure enough the wedding turned out all right, on\xe2\x80\x99y\r\npoor Mrs. Lammeter\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Osgood as was\xe2\x80\x94died afore the lasses was\r\ngrowed up; but for prosperity and everything respectable, there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nfamily more looked on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery one of Mr. Macey\xe2\x80\x99s audience had heard this story many times, but\r\nit was listened to as if it had been a favourite tune, and at certain\r\npoints the puffing of the pipes was momentarily suspended, that the\r\nlisteners might give their whole minds to the expected words. But there\r\nwas more to come; and Mr. Snell, the landlord, duly put the leading\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, old Mr. Lammeter had a pretty fortin, didn\xe2\x80\x99t they say, when he\r\ncome into these parts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I daresay it\xe2\x80\x99s as much as this Mr.\r\nLammeter\xe2\x80\x99s done to keep it whole. For there was allays a talk as nobody\r\ncould get rich on the Warrens: though he holds it cheap, for it\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nthey call Charity Land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, and there\xe2\x80\x99s few folks know so well as you how it come to be\r\nCharity Land, eh, Mr. Macey?\xe2\x80\x9d said the butcher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should they?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old clerk, with some contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my\r\ngrandfather made the grooms\xe2\x80\x99 livery for that Mr. Cliff as came and\r\nbuilt the big stables at the Warrens. Why, they\xe2\x80\x99re stables four times\r\nas big as Squire Cass\xe2\x80\x99s, for he thought o\xe2\x80\x99 nothing but hosses and\r\nhunting, Cliff didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94a Lunnon tailor, some folks said, as had gone mad\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 cheating. For he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ride; lor bless you! they said he\xe2\x80\x99d got\r\nno more grip o\xe2\x80\x99 the hoss than if his legs had been cross-sticks: my\r\ngrandfather heared old Squire Cass say so many and many a time. But\r\nride he would, as if Old Harry had been a-driving him; and he\xe2\x80\x99d a son,\r\na lad o\xe2\x80\x99 sixteen; and nothing would his father have him do, but he must\r\nride and ride\xe2\x80\x94though the lad was frighted, they said. And it was a\r\ncommon saying as the father wanted to ride the tailor out o\xe2\x80\x99 the lad,\r\nand make a gentleman on him\xe2\x80\x94not but what I\xe2\x80\x99m a tailor myself, but in\r\nrespect as God made me such, I\xe2\x80\x99m proud on it, for \xe2\x80\x9cMacey, tailor\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen wrote up over our door since afore the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s heads went out on\r\nthe shillings. But Cliff, he was ashamed o\xe2\x80\x99 being called a tailor, and\r\nhe was sore vexed as his riding was laughed at, and nobody o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\ngentlefolks hereabout could abide him. Howsomever, the poor lad got\r\nsickly and died, and the father didn\xe2\x80\x99t live long after him, for he got\r\nqueerer nor ever, and they said he used to go out i\xe2\x80\x99 the dead o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nnight, wi\xe2\x80\x99 a lantern in his hand, to the stables, and set a lot o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlights burning, for he got as he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep; and there he\xe2\x80\x99d stand,\r\ncracking his whip and looking at his hosses; and they said it was a\r\nmercy as the stables didn\xe2\x80\x99t get burnt down wi\xe2\x80\x99 the poor dumb creaturs\r\nin \xe2\x80\x99em. But at last he died raving, and they found as he\xe2\x80\x99d left all his\r\nproperty, Warrens and all, to a Lunnon Charity, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how the\r\nWarrens come to be Charity Land; though, as for the stables, Mr.\r\nLammeter never uses \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re out o\xe2\x80\x99 all charicter\xe2\x80\x94lor bless you! if\r\nyou was to set the doors a-banging in \xe2\x80\x99em, it \xe2\x80\x99ud sound like thunder\r\nhalf o\xe2\x80\x99er the parish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, but there\xe2\x80\x99s more going on in the stables than what folks see by\r\ndaylight, eh, Mr. Macey?\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye; go that way of a dark night, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey,\r\nwinking mysteriously, \xe2\x80\x9cand then make believe, if you like, as you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t see lights i\xe2\x80\x99 the stables, nor hear the stamping o\xe2\x80\x99 the hosses,\r\nnor the cracking o\xe2\x80\x99 the whips, and howling, too, if it\xe2\x80\x99s tow\xe2\x80\x99rt\r\ndaybreak. \xe2\x80\x9cCliff\xe2\x80\x99s Holiday\xe2\x80\x9d has been the name of it ever sin\xe2\x80\x99 I were a\r\nboy; that\xe2\x80\x99s to say, some said as it was the holiday Old Harry gev him\r\nfrom roasting, like. That\xe2\x80\x99s what my father told me, and he was a\r\nreasonable man, though there\xe2\x80\x99s folks nowadays know what happened afore\r\nthey were born better nor they know their own business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say to that, eh, Dowlas?\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, turning to\r\nthe farrier, who was swelling with impatience for his cue. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nnut for _you_ to crack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Dowlas was the negative spirit in the company, and was proud of his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay? I say what a man _should_ say as doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shut his eyes to look at\r\na finger-post. I say, as I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to wager any man ten pound, if he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstand out wi\xe2\x80\x99 me any dry night in the pasture before the Warren\r\nstables, as we shall neither see lights nor hear noises, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe blowing of our own noses. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I say, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it many\r\na time; but there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody \xe2\x80\x99ull ventur a ten-pun\xe2\x80\x99 note on their ghos\xe2\x80\x99es\r\nas they make so sure of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Dowlas, that\xe2\x80\x99s easy betting, that is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Winthrop. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmight as well bet a man as he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t catch the rheumatise if he stood\r\nup to \xe2\x80\x99s neck in the pool of a frosty night. It \xe2\x80\x99ud be fine fun for a\r\nman to win his bet as he\xe2\x80\x99d catch the rheumatise. Folks as believe in\r\nCliff\xe2\x80\x99s Holiday aren\xe2\x80\x99t agoing to ventur near it for a matter o\xe2\x80\x99 ten\r\npound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Master Dowlas wants to know the truth on it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey, with\r\na sarcastic smile, tapping his thumbs together, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s no call to lay\r\nany bet\xe2\x80\x94let him go and stan\xe2\x80\x99 by himself\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody \xe2\x80\x99ull hinder him;\r\nand then he can let the parish\xe2\x80\x99ners know if they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you! I\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farrier, with a snort of\r\nscorn. \xe2\x80\x9cIf folks are fools, it\xe2\x80\x99s no business o\xe2\x80\x99 mine. _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nmake out the truth about ghos\xe2\x80\x99es: I know it a\xe2\x80\x99ready. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nagainst a bet\xe2\x80\x94everything fair and open. Let any man bet me ten pound as\r\nI shall see Cliff\xe2\x80\x99s Holiday, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and stand by myself. I want no\r\ncompany. I\xe2\x80\x99d as lief do it as I\xe2\x80\x99d fill this pipe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but who\xe2\x80\x99s to watch you, Dowlas, and see you do it? That\xe2\x80\x99s no fair\r\nbet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the butcher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fair bet?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Dowlas, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to hear any\r\nman stand up and say I want to bet unfair. Come now, Master Lundy, I\r\nshould like to hear you say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery like you would,\xe2\x80\x9d said the butcher. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s no business o\xe2\x80\x99 mine.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re none o\xe2\x80\x99 my bargains, and I aren\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to try and \xe2\x80\x99bate your\r\nprice. If anybody \xe2\x80\x99ll bid for you at your own vallying, let him. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nfor peace and quietness, I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what every yapping cur is, when you hold a stick up at\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farrier. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid o\xe2\x80\x99 neither man nor ghost, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m ready to lay a fair bet. _I_ aren\xe2\x80\x99t a turn-tail cur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, but there\xe2\x80\x99s this in it, Dowlas,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, speaking in a\r\ntone of much candour and tolerance. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s folks, i\xe2\x80\x99 my opinion, they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t see ghos\xe2\x80\x99es, not if they stood as plain as a pike-staff before\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em. And there\xe2\x80\x99s reason i\xe2\x80\x99 that. For there\xe2\x80\x99s my wife, now, can\xe2\x80\x99t smell,\r\nnot if she\xe2\x80\x99d the strongest o\xe2\x80\x99 cheese under her nose. I never see\xe2\x80\x99d a\r\nghost myself; but then I says to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cVery like I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the\r\nsmell for \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d I mean, putting a ghost for a smell, or else\r\ncontrairiways. And so, I\xe2\x80\x99m for holding with both sides; for, as I say,\r\nthe truth lies between \xe2\x80\x99em. And if Dowlas was to go and stand, and say\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d never seen a wink o\xe2\x80\x99 Cliff\xe2\x80\x99s Holiday all the night through, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nback him; and if anybody said as Cliff\xe2\x80\x99s Holiday was certain sure, for\r\nall that, I\xe2\x80\x99d back _him_ too. For the smell\xe2\x80\x99s what I go by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord\xe2\x80\x99s analogical argument was not well received by the\r\nfarrier\xe2\x80\x94a man intensely opposed to compromise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut, tut,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, setting down his glass with refreshed irritation;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the smell got to do with it? Did ever a ghost give a man a\r\nblack eye? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I should like to know. If ghos\xe2\x80\x99es want me to\r\nbelieve in \xe2\x80\x99em, let \xe2\x80\x99em leave off skulking i\xe2\x80\x99 the dark and i\xe2\x80\x99 lone\r\nplaces\xe2\x80\x94let \xe2\x80\x99em come where there\xe2\x80\x99s company and candles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs if ghos\xe2\x80\x99es \xe2\x80\x99ud want to be believed in by anybody so ignirant!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Macey, in deep disgust at the farrier\xe2\x80\x99s crass incompetence to\r\napprehend the conditions of ghostly phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nYet the next moment there seemed to be some evidence that ghosts had a\r\nmore condescending disposition than Mr. Macey attributed to them; for\r\nthe pale thin figure of Silas Marner was suddenly seen standing in the\r\nwarm light, uttering no word, but looking round at the company with his\r\nstrange unearthly eyes. The long pipes gave a simultaneous movement,\r\nlike the antennae of startled insects, and every man present, not\r\nexcepting even the sceptical farrier, had an impression that he saw,\r\nnot Silas Marner in the flesh, but an apparition; for the door by which\r\nSilas had entered was hidden by the high-screened seats, and no one had\r\nnoticed his approach. Mr. Macey, sitting a long way off the ghost,\r\nmight be supposed to have felt an argumentative triumph, which would\r\ntend to neutralize his share of the general alarm. Had he not always\r\nsaid that when Silas Marner was in that strange trance of his, his soul\r\nwent loose from his body? Here was the demonstration: nevertheless, on\r\nthe whole, he would have been as well contented without it. For a few\r\nmoments there was a dead silence, Marner\xe2\x80\x99s want of breath and agitation\r\nnot allowing him to speak. The landlord, under the habitual sense that\r\nhe was bound to keep his house open to all company, and confident in\r\nthe protection of his unbroken neutrality, at last took on himself the\r\ntask of adjuring the ghost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a conciliatory tone, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s lacking to\r\nyou? What\xe2\x80\x99s your business here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobbed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, gaspingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been robbed! I want the\r\nconstable\xe2\x80\x94and the Justice\xe2\x80\x94and Squire Cass\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Crackenthorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLay hold on him, Jem Rodney,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, the idea of a ghost\r\nsubsiding; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s off his head, I doubt. He\xe2\x80\x99s wet through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJem Rodney was the outermost man, and sat conveniently near Marner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstanding-place; but he declined to give his services.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and lay hold on him yourself, Mr. Snell, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve a mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJem, rather sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been robbed, and murdered too, for what I\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a muttering tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJem Rodney!\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, turning and fixing his strange eyes on the\r\nsuspected man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, Master Marner, what do you want wi\xe2\x80\x99 me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jem, trembling a\r\nlittle, and seizing his drinking-can as a defensive weapon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it was you stole my money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, clasping his hands\r\nentreatingly, and raising his voice to a cry, \xe2\x80\x9cgive it me back\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t meddle with you. I won\xe2\x80\x99t set the constable on you. Give it me\r\nback, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you have a guinea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe stole your money!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jem, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pitch this can at your\r\neye if you talk o\xe2\x80\x99 _my_ stealing your money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, now rising resolutely,\r\nand seizing Marner by the shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ve got any information to\r\nlay, speak it out sensible, and show as you\xe2\x80\x99re in your right mind, if\r\nyou expect anybody to listen to you. You\xe2\x80\x99re as wet as a drownded rat.\r\nSit down and dry yourself, and speak straight forrard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, to be sure, man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farrier, who began to feel that he had\r\nnot been quite on a par with himself and the occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have no\r\nmore staring and screaming, else we\xe2\x80\x99ll have you strapped for a madman.\r\nThat was why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak at the first\xe2\x80\x94thinks I, the man\xe2\x80\x99s run mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, make him sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said several voices at once, well\r\npleased that the reality of ghosts remained still an open question.\r\n\r\nThe landlord forced Marner to take off his coat, and then to sit down\r\non a chair aloof from every one else, in the centre of the circle and\r\nin the direct rays of the fire. The weaver, too feeble to have any\r\ndistinct purpose beyond that of getting help to recover his money,\r\nsubmitted unresistingly. The transient fears of the company were now\r\nforgotten in their strong curiosity, and all faces were turned towards\r\nSilas, when the landlord, having seated himself again, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, Master Marner, what\xe2\x80\x99s this you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say\xe2\x80\x94as you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nrobbed? Speak out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d better not say again as it was me robbed him,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jem Rodney,\r\nhastily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could I ha\xe2\x80\x99 done with his money? I could as easy steal\r\nthe parson\xe2\x80\x99s surplice, and wear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, Jem, and let\xe2\x80\x99s hear what he\xe2\x80\x99s got to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlandlord. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, Master Marner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilas now told his story, under frequent questioning as the mysterious\r\ncharacter of the robbery became evident.\r\n\r\nThis strangely novel situation of opening his trouble to his Raveloe\r\nneighbours, of sitting in the warmth of a hearth not his own, and\r\nfeeling the presence of faces and voices which were his nearest promise\r\nof help, had doubtless its influence on Marner, in spite of his\r\npassionate preoccupation with his loss. Our consciousness rarely\r\nregisters the beginning of a growth within us any more than without us:\r\nthere have been many circulations of the sap before we detect the\r\nsmallest sign of the bud.\r\n\r\nThe slight suspicion with which his hearers at first listened to him,\r\ngradually melted away before the convincing simplicity of his distress:\r\nit was impossible for the neighbours to doubt that Marner was telling\r\nthe truth, not because they were capable of arguing at once from the\r\nnature of his statements to the absence of any motive for making them\r\nfalsely, but because, as Mr. Macey observed, \xe2\x80\x9cFolks as had the devil to\r\nback \xe2\x80\x99em were not likely to be so mushed\xe2\x80\x9d as poor Silas was. Rather,\r\nfrom the strange fact that the robber had left no traces, and had\r\nhappened to know the nick of time, utterly incalculable by mortal\r\nagents, when Silas would go away from home without locking his door,\r\nthe more probable conclusion seemed to be, that his disreputable\r\nintimacy in that quarter, if it ever existed, had been broken up, and\r\nthat, in consequence, this ill turn had been done to Marner by somebody\r\nit was quite in vain to set the constable after. Why this preternatural\r\nfelon should be obliged to wait till the door was left unlocked, was a\r\nquestion which did not present itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t Jem Rodney as has done this work, Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlandlord. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be a-casting your eye at poor Jem. There may be\r\na bit of a reckoning against Jem for the matter of a hare or so, if\r\nanybody was bound to keep their eyes staring open, and niver to wink;\r\nbut Jem\xe2\x80\x99s been a-sitting here drinking his can, like the decentest man\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 the parish, since before you left your house, Master Marner, by your\r\nown account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey; \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s have no accusing o\xe2\x80\x99 the innicent.\r\nThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t the law. There must be folks to swear again\xe2\x80\x99 a man before he\r\ncan be ta\xe2\x80\x99en up. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have no accusing o\xe2\x80\x99 the innicent, Master\r\nMarner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMemory was not so utterly torpid in Silas that it could not be awakened\r\nby these words. With a movement of compunction as new and strange to\r\nhim as everything else within the last hour, he started from his chair\r\nand went close up to Jem, looking at him as if he wanted to assure\r\nhimself of the expression in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyes, yes\xe2\x80\x94I ought to have thought. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing to witness against you, Jem. Only you\xe2\x80\x99d been into my house\r\noftener than anybody else, and so you came into my head. I don\xe2\x80\x99t accuse\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t accuse anybody\xe2\x80\x94only,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, lifting up his hands to his\r\nhead, and turning away with bewildered misery, \xe2\x80\x9cI try\xe2\x80\x94I try to think\r\nwhere my guineas can be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, they\xe2\x80\x99re gone where it\xe2\x80\x99s hot enough to melt \xe2\x80\x99em, I doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Macey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTchuh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the farrier. And then he asked, with a cross-examining\r\nair, \xe2\x80\x9cHow much money might there be in the bags, Master Marner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo hundred and seventy-two pounds, twelve and sixpence, last night\r\nwhen I counted it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, seating himself again, with a groan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! why, they\xe2\x80\x99d be none so heavy to carry. Some tramp\xe2\x80\x99s been in,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all; and as for the no footmarks, and the bricks and the sand\r\nbeing all right\xe2\x80\x94why, your eyes are pretty much like a insect\xe2\x80\x99s, Master\r\nMarner; they\xe2\x80\x99re obliged to look so close, you can\xe2\x80\x99t see much at a time.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion as, if I\xe2\x80\x99d been you, or you\xe2\x80\x99d been me\xe2\x80\x94for it comes to\r\nthe same thing\xe2\x80\x94you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought you\xe2\x80\x99d found everything as you\r\nleft it. But what I vote is, as two of the sensiblest o\xe2\x80\x99 the company\r\nshould go with you to Master Kench, the constable\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s ill i\xe2\x80\x99 bed, I\r\nknow that much\xe2\x80\x94and get him to appoint one of us his deppity; for that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe law, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody \xe2\x80\x99ull take upon him to contradick me\r\nthere. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t much of a walk to Kench\xe2\x80\x99s; and then, if it\xe2\x80\x99s me as is\r\ndeppity, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back with you, Master Marner, and examine your\r\npremises; and if anybody\xe2\x80\x99s got any fault to find with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll thank\r\nhim to stand up and say it out like a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this pregnant speech the farrier had re-established his\r\nself-complacency, and waited with confidence to hear himself named as\r\none of the superlatively sensible men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see how the night is, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, who also\r\nconsidered himself personally concerned in this proposition. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\r\nrains heavy still,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, returning from the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the man to be afraid o\xe2\x80\x99 the rain,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farrier.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor it\xe2\x80\x99ll look bad when Justice Malam hears as respectable men like us\r\nhad a information laid before \xe2\x80\x99em and took no steps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord agreed with this view, and after taking the sense of the\r\ncompany, and duly rehearsing a small ceremony known in high\r\necclesiastical life as the _nolo episcopari_, he consented to take on\r\nhimself the chill dignity of going to Kench\xe2\x80\x99s. But to the farrier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrong disgust, Mr. Macey now started an objection to his proposing\r\nhimself as a deputy-constable; for that oracular old gentleman,\r\nclaiming to know the law, stated, as a fact delivered to him by his\r\nfather, that no doctor could be a constable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re a doctor, I reckon, though you\xe2\x80\x99re only a cow-doctor\xe2\x80\x94for a\r\nfly\xe2\x80\x99s a fly, though it may be a hoss-fly,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Mr. Macey,\r\nwondering a little at his own \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99cuteness\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nThere was a hot debate upon this, the farrier being of course\r\nindisposed to renounce the quality of doctor, but contending that a\r\ndoctor could be a constable if he liked\xe2\x80\x94the law meant, he needn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\none if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like. Mr. Macey thought this was nonsense, since the\r\nlaw was not likely to be fonder of doctors than of other folks.\r\nMoreover, if it was in the nature of doctors more than of other men not\r\nto like being constables, how came Mr. Dowlas to be so eager to act in\r\nthat capacity?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want to act the constable,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farrier, driven into a\r\ncorner by this merciless reasoning; \xe2\x80\x9cand there\xe2\x80\x99s no man can say it of\r\nme, if he\xe2\x80\x99d tell the truth. But if there\xe2\x80\x99s to be any jealousy and\r\nen_vy_ing about going to Kench\xe2\x80\x99s in the rain, let them go as like\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t get me to go, I can tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s intervention, however, the dispute was accommodated.\r\nMr. Dowlas consented to go as a second person disinclined to act\r\nofficially; and so poor Silas, furnished with some old coverings,\r\nturned out with his two companions into the rain again, thinking of the\r\nlong night-hours before him, not as those do who long to rest, but as\r\nthose who expect to \xe2\x80\x9cwatch for the morning\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nWhen Godfrey Cass returned from Mrs. Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s party at midnight, he was\r\nnot much surprised to learn that Dunsey had not come home. Perhaps he\r\nhad not sold Wildfire, and was waiting for another chance\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, on\r\nthat foggy afternoon, he had preferred housing himself at the Red Lion\r\nat Batherley for the night, if the run had kept him in that\r\nneighbourhood; for he was not likely to feel much concern about leaving\r\nhis brother in suspense. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s mind was too full of Nancy\r\nLammeter\xe2\x80\x99s looks and behaviour, too full of the exasperation against\r\nhimself and his lot, which the sight of her always produced in him, for\r\nhim to give much thought to Wildfire, or to the probabilities of\r\nDunstan\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the whole village was excited by the story of the\r\nrobbery, and Godfrey, like every one else, was occupied in gathering\r\nand discussing news about it, and in visiting the Stone-pits. The rain\r\nhad washed away all possibility of distinguishing foot-marks, but a\r\nclose investigation of the spot had disclosed, in the direction\r\nopposite to the village, a tinder-box, with a flint and steel, half\r\nsunk in the mud. It was not Silas\xe2\x80\x99s tinder-box, for the only one he had\r\never had was still standing on his shelf; and the inference generally\r\naccepted was, that the tinder-box in the ditch was somehow connected\r\nwith the robbery. A small minority shook their heads, and intimated\r\ntheir opinion that it was not a robbery to have much light thrown on it\r\nby tinder-boxes, that Master Marner\xe2\x80\x99s tale had a queer look with it,\r\nand that such things had been known as a man\xe2\x80\x99s doing himself a\r\nmischief, and then setting the justice to look for the doer. But when\r\nquestioned closely as to their grounds for this opinion, and what\r\nMaster Marner had to gain by such false pretences, they only shook\r\ntheir heads as before, and observed that there was no knowing what some\r\nfolks counted gain; moreover, that everybody had a right to their own\r\nopinions, grounds or no grounds, and that the weaver, as everybody\r\nknew, was partly crazy. Mr. Macey, though he joined in the defence of\r\nMarner against all suspicions of deceit, also pooh-poohed the\r\ntinder-box; indeed, repudiated it as a rather impious suggestion,\r\ntending to imply that everything must be done by human hands, and that\r\nthere was no power which could make away with the guineas without\r\nmoving the bricks. Nevertheless, he turned round rather sharply on Mr.\r\nTookey, when the zealous deputy, feeling that this was a view of the\r\ncase peculiarly suited to a parish-clerk, carried it still farther, and\r\ndoubted whether it was right to inquire into a robbery at all when the\r\ncircumstances were so mysterious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs if,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Mr. Tookey\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cas if there was nothing but what could\r\nbe made out by justices and constables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be for overshooting the mark, Tookey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey,\r\nnodding his head aside admonishingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re allays at; if\r\nI throw a stone and hit, you think there\xe2\x80\x99s summat better than hitting,\r\nand you try to throw a stone beyond. What I said was against the\r\ntinder-box: I said nothing against justices and constables, for they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 King George\xe2\x80\x99s making, and it \xe2\x80\x99ud be ill-becoming a man in a parish\r\noffice to fly out again\xe2\x80\x99 King George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile these discussions were going on amongst the group outside the\r\nRainbow, a higher consultation was being carried on within, under the\r\npresidency of Mr. Crackenthorp, the rector, assisted by Squire Cass and\r\nother substantial parishioners. It had just occurred to Mr. Snell, the\r\nlandlord\xe2\x80\x94he being, as he observed, a man accustomed to put two and two\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94to connect with the tinder-box, which, as deputy-constable, he\r\nhimself had had the honourable distinction of finding, certain\r\nrecollections of a pedlar who had called to drink at the house about a\r\nmonth before, and had actually stated that he carried a tinder-box\r\nabout with him to light his pipe. Here, surely, was a clue to be\r\nfollowed out. And as memory, when duly impregnated with ascertained\r\nfacts, is sometimes surprisingly fertile, Mr. Snell gradually recovered\r\na vivid impression of the effect produced on him by the pedlar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance and conversation. He had a \xe2\x80\x9clook with his eye\xe2\x80\x9d which fell\r\nunpleasantly on Mr. Snell\xe2\x80\x99s sensitive organism. To be sure, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay anything particular\xe2\x80\x94no, except that about the tinder-box\xe2\x80\x94but it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t what a man says, it\xe2\x80\x99s the way he says it. Moreover, he had a\r\nswarthy foreignness of complexion which boded little honesty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he wear ear-rings?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Crackenthorp wished to know, having some\r\nacquaintance with foreign customs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94stay\xe2\x80\x94let me see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Snell, like a docile clairvoyante, who\r\nwould really not make a mistake if she could help it. After stretching\r\nthe corners of his mouth and contracting his eyes, as if he were trying\r\nto see the ear-rings, he appeared to give up the effort, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99d got ear-rings in his box to sell, so it\xe2\x80\x99s nat\xe2\x80\x99ral to\r\nsuppose he might wear \xe2\x80\x99em. But he called at every house, a\xe2\x80\x99most, in the\r\nvillage; there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody else, mayhap, saw \xe2\x80\x99em in his ears, though I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t take upon me rightly to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Snell was correct in his surmise, that somebody else would remember\r\nthe pedlar\xe2\x80\x99s ear-rings. For on the spread of inquiry among the\r\nvillagers it was stated with gathering emphasis, that the parson had\r\nwanted to know whether the pedlar wore ear-rings in his ears, and an\r\nimpression was created that a great deal depended on the eliciting of\r\nthis fact. Of course, every one who heard the question, not having any\r\ndistinct image of the pedlar as _without_ ear-rings, immediately had an\r\nimage of him _with_ ear-rings, larger or smaller, as the case might be;\r\nand the image was presently taken for a vivid recollection, so that the\r\nglazier\xe2\x80\x99s wife, a well-intentioned woman, not given to lying, and whose\r\nhouse was among the cleanest in the village, was ready to declare, as\r\nsure as ever she meant to take the sacrament the very next Christmas\r\nthat was ever coming, that she had seen big ear-rings, in the shape of\r\nthe young moon, in the pedlar\xe2\x80\x99s two ears; while Jinny Oates, the\r\ncobbler\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, being a more imaginative person, stated not only\r\nthat she had seen them too, but that they had made her blood creep, as\r\nit did at that very moment while there she stood.\r\n\r\nAlso, by way of throwing further light on this clue of the tinder-box,\r\na collection was made of all the articles purchased from the pedlar at\r\nvarious houses, and carried to the Rainbow to be exhibited there. In\r\nfact, there was a general feeling in the village, that for the\r\nclearing-up of this robbery there must be a great deal done at the\r\nRainbow, and that no man need offer his wife an excuse for going there\r\nwhile it was the scene of severe public duties.\r\n\r\nSome disappointment was felt, and perhaps a little indignation also,\r\nwhen it became known that Silas Marner, on being questioned by the\r\nSquire and the parson, had retained no other recollection of the pedlar\r\nthan that he had called at his door, but had not entered his house,\r\nhaving turned away at once when Silas, holding the door ajar, had said\r\nthat he wanted nothing. This had been Silas\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, though he\r\nclutched strongly at the idea of the pedlar\xe2\x80\x99s being the culprit, if\r\nonly because it gave him a definite image of a whereabout for his gold\r\nafter it had been taken away from its hiding-place: he could see it now\r\nin the pedlar\xe2\x80\x99s box. But it was observed with some irritation in the\r\nvillage, that anybody but a \xe2\x80\x9cblind creatur\xe2\x80\x9d like Marner would have seen\r\nthe man prowling about, for how came he to leave his tinder-box in the\r\nditch close by, if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been lingering there? Doubtless, he had\r\nmade his observations when he saw Marner at the door. Anybody might\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94and only look at him\xe2\x80\x94that the weaver was a half-crazy miser. It\r\nwas a wonder the pedlar hadn\xe2\x80\x99t murdered him; men of that sort, with\r\nrings in their ears, had been known for murderers often and often;\r\nthere had been one tried at the \xe2\x80\x99sizes, not so long ago but what there\r\nwere people living who remembered it.\r\n\r\nGodfrey Cass, indeed, entering the Rainbow during one of Mr. Snell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfrequently repeated recitals of his testimony, had treated it lightly,\r\nstating that he himself had bought a pen-knife of the pedlar, and\r\nthought him a merry grinning fellow enough; it was all nonsense, he\r\nsaid, about the man\xe2\x80\x99s evil looks. But this was spoken of in the village\r\nas the random talk of youth, \xe2\x80\x9cas if it was only Mr. Snell who had seen\r\nsomething odd about the pedlar!\xe2\x80\x9d On the contrary, there were at least\r\nhalf-a-dozen who were ready to go before Justice Malam, and give in\r\nmuch more striking testimony than any the landlord could furnish. It\r\nwas to be hoped Mr. Godfrey would not go to Tarley and throw cold water\r\non what Mr. Snell said there, and so prevent the justice from drawing\r\nup a warrant. He was suspected of intending this, when, after mid-day,\r\nhe was seen setting off on horseback in the direction of Tarley.\r\n\r\nBut by this time Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the robbery had faded before his\r\ngrowing anxiety about Dunstan and Wildfire, and he was going, not to\r\nTarley, but to Batherley, unable to rest in uncertainty about them any\r\nlonger. The possibility that Dunstan had played him the ugly trick of\r\nriding away with Wildfire, to return at the end of a month, when he had\r\ngambled away or otherwise squandered the price of the horse, was a fear\r\nthat urged itself upon him more, even, than the thought of an\r\naccidental injury; and now that the dance at Mrs. Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s was past, he\r\nwas irritated with himself that he had trusted his horse to Dunstan.\r\nInstead of trying to still his fears, he encouraged them, with that\r\nsuperstitious impression which clings to us all, that if we expect evil\r\nvery strongly it is the less likely to come; and when he heard a horse\r\napproaching at a trot, and saw a hat rising above a hedge beyond an\r\nangle of the lane, he felt as if his conjuration had succeeded. But no\r\nsooner did the horse come within sight, than his heart sank again. It\r\nwas not Wildfire; and in a few moments more he discerned that the rider\r\nwas not Dunstan, but Bryce, who pulled up to speak, with a face that\r\nimplied something disagreeable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Godfrey, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lucky brother of yours, that Master\r\nDunsey, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he been home yet?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bryce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome? no. What has happened? Be quick. What has he done with my\r\nhorse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I thought it was yours, though he pretended you had parted with it\r\nto him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he thrown him down and broken his knees?\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, flushed\r\nwith exasperation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorse than that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bryce. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I\xe2\x80\x99d made a bargain with him to\r\nbuy the horse for a hundred and twenty\xe2\x80\x94a swinging price, but I always\r\nliked the horse. And what does he do but go and stake him\xe2\x80\x94fly at a\r\nhedge with stakes in it, atop of a bank with a ditch before it. The\r\nhorse had been dead a pretty good while when he was found. So he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen home since, has he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome? no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\xe2\x80\x99d better keep away. Confound me for a\r\nfool! I might have known this would be the end of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to tell you the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bryce, \xe2\x80\x9cafter I\xe2\x80\x99d bargained for the\r\nhorse, it did come into my head that he might be riding and selling the\r\nhorse without your knowledge, for I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it was his own. I\r\nknew Master Dunsey was up to his tricks sometimes. But where can he be\r\ngone? He\xe2\x80\x99s never been seen at Batherley. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been hurt,\r\nfor he must have walked off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurt?\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll never be hurt\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s made to hurt\r\nother people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you _did_ give him leave to sell the horse, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bryce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I wanted to part with the horse\xe2\x80\x94he was always a little too hard\r\nin the mouth for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey; his pride making him wince under\r\nthe idea that Bryce guessed the sale to be a matter of necessity. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas going to see after him\xe2\x80\x94I thought some mischief had happened. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo back now,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head, and wishing he could\r\nget rid of Bryce; for he felt that the long-dreaded crisis in his life\r\nwas close upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re coming on to Raveloe, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no, not now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bryce. \xe2\x80\x9cI _was_ coming round there, for I had\r\nto go to Flitton, and I thought I might as well take you in my way, and\r\njust let you know all I knew myself about the horse. I suppose Master\r\nDunsey didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to show himself till the ill news had blown over a\r\nbit. He\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps gone to pay a visit at the Three Crowns, by\r\nWhitbridge\xe2\x80\x94I know he\xe2\x80\x99s fond of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, rather absently. Then rousing himself,\r\nhe said, with an effort at carelessness, \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall hear of him soon\r\nenough, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here\xe2\x80\x99s my turning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bryce, not surprised to perceive that\r\nGodfrey was rather \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cso I\xe2\x80\x99ll bid you good-day, and wish I may\r\nbring you better news another time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey rode along slowly, representing to himself the scene of\r\nconfession to his father from which he felt that there was now no\r\nlonger any escape. The revelation about the money must be made the very\r\nnext morning; and if he withheld the rest, Dunstan would be sure to\r\ncome back shortly, and, finding that he must bear the brunt of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s anger, would tell the whole story out of spite, even though he\r\nhad nothing to gain by it. There was one step, perhaps, by which he\r\nmight still win Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s silence and put off the evil day: he might\r\ntell his father that he had himself spent the money paid to him by\r\nFowler; and as he had never been guilty of such an offence before, the\r\naffair would blow over after a little storming. But Godfrey could not\r\nbend himself to this. He felt that in letting Dunstan have the money,\r\nhe had already been guilty of a breach of trust hardly less culpable\r\nthan that of spending the money directly for his own behoof; and yet\r\nthere was a distinction between the two acts which made him feel that\r\nthe one was so much more blackening than the other as to be intolerable\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be a good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\na scoundrel\xe2\x80\x94at least, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop short somewhere. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bear the\r\nconsequences of what I _have_ done sooner than make believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve done\r\nwhat I never would have done. I\xe2\x80\x99d never have spent the money for my own\r\npleasure\xe2\x80\x94I was tortured into it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough the remainder of this day Godfrey, with only occasional\r\nfluctuations, kept his will bent in the direction of a complete avowal\r\nto his father, and he withheld the story of Wildfire\xe2\x80\x99s loss till the\r\nnext morning, that it might serve him as an introduction to heavier\r\nmatter. The old Squire was accustomed to his son\xe2\x80\x99s frequent absence\r\nfrom home, and thought neither Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s nor Wildfire\xe2\x80\x99s non-appearance\r\na matter calling for remark. Godfrey said to himself again and again,\r\nthat if he let slip this one opportunity of confession, he might never\r\nhave another; the revelation might be made even in a more odious way\r\nthan by Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s malignity: _she_ might come as she had threatened to\r\ndo. And then he tried to make the scene easier to himself by rehearsal:\r\nhe made up his mind how he would pass from the admission of his\r\nweakness in letting Dunstan have the money to the fact that Dunstan had\r\na hold on him which he had been unable to shake off, and how he would\r\nwork up his father to expect something very bad before he told him the\r\nfact. The old Squire was an implacable man: he made resolutions in\r\nviolent anger, and he was not to be moved from them after his anger had\r\nsubsided\xe2\x80\x94as fiery volcanic matters cool and harden into rock. Like many\r\nviolent and implacable men, he allowed evils to grow under favour of\r\nhis own heedlessness, till they pressed upon him with exasperating\r\nforce, and then he turned round with fierce severity and became\r\nunrelentingly hard. This was his system with his tenants: he allowed\r\nthem to get into arrears, neglect their fences, reduce their stock,\r\nsell their straw, and otherwise go the wrong way,\xe2\x80\x94and then, when he\r\nbecame short of money in consequence of this indulgence, he took the\r\nhardest measures and would listen to no appeal. Godfrey knew all this,\r\nand felt it with the greater force because he had constantly suffered\r\nannoyance from witnessing his father\xe2\x80\x99s sudden fits of unrelentingness,\r\nfor which his own habitual irresolution deprived him of all sympathy.\r\n(He was not critical on the faulty indulgence which preceded these\r\nfits; _that_ seemed to him natural enough.) Still there was just the\r\nchance, Godfrey thought, that his father\xe2\x80\x99s pride might see this\r\nmarriage in a light that would induce him to hush it up, rather than\r\nturn his son out and make the family the talk of the country for ten\r\nmiles round.\r\n\r\nThis was the view of the case that Godfrey managed to keep before him\r\npretty closely till midnight, and he went to sleep thinking that he had\r\ndone with inward debating. But when he awoke in the still morning\r\ndarkness he found it impossible to reawaken his evening thoughts; it\r\nwas as if they had been tired out and were not to be roused to further\r\nwork. Instead of arguments for confession, he could now feel the\r\npresence of nothing but its evil consequences: the old dread of\r\ndisgrace came back\xe2\x80\x94the old shrinking from the thought of raising a\r\nhopeless barrier between himself and Nancy\xe2\x80\x94the old disposition to rely\r\non chances which might be favourable to him, and save him from\r\nbetrayal. Why, after all, should he cut off the hope of them by his own\r\nact? He had seen the matter in a wrong light yesterday. He had been in\r\na rage with Dunstan, and had thought of nothing but a thorough break-up\r\nof their mutual understanding; but what it would be really wisest for\r\nhim to do, was to try and soften his father\xe2\x80\x99s anger against Dunsey, and\r\nkeep things as nearly as possible in their old condition. If Dunsey did\r\nnot come back for a few days (and Godfrey did not know but that the\r\nrascal had enough money in his pocket to enable him to keep away still\r\nlonger), everything might blow over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nGodfrey rose and took his own breakfast earlier than usual, but\r\nlingered in the wainscoted parlour till his younger brothers had\r\nfinished their meal and gone out; awaiting his father, who always took\r\na walk with his managing-man before breakfast. Every one breakfasted at\r\na different hour in the Red House, and the Squire was always the\r\nlatest, giving a long chance to a rather feeble morning appetite before\r\nhe tried it. The table had been spread with substantial eatables nearly\r\ntwo hours before he presented himself\xe2\x80\x94a tall, stout man of sixty, with\r\na face in which the knit brow and rather hard glance seemed\r\ncontradicted by the slack and feeble mouth. His person showed marks of\r\nhabitual neglect, his dress was slovenly; and yet there was something\r\nin the presence of the old Squire distinguishable from that of the\r\nordinary farmers in the parish, who were perhaps every whit as refined\r\nas he, but, having slouched their way through life with a consciousness\r\nof being in the vicinity of their \xe2\x80\x9cbetters\xe2\x80\x9d, wanted that\r\nself-possession and authoritativeness of voice and carriage which\r\nbelonged to a man who thought of superiors as remote existences with\r\nwhom he had personally little more to do than with America or the\r\nstars. The Squire had been used to parish homage all his life, used to\r\nthe presupposition that his family, his tankards, and everything that\r\nwas his, were the oldest and best; and as he never associated with any\r\ngentry higher than himself, his opinion was not disturbed by\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at his son as he entered the room, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, sir!\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ had your breakfast yet?\xe2\x80\x9d but there was no pleasant\r\nmorning greeting between them; not because of any unfriendliness, but\r\nbecause the sweet flower of courtesy is not a growth of such homes as\r\nthe Red House.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had my breakfast, but I was waiting to\r\nspeak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, throwing himself indifferently into his\r\nchair, and speaking in a ponderous coughing fashion, which was felt in\r\nRaveloe to be a sort of privilege of his rank, while he cut a piece of\r\nbeef, and held it up before the deer-hound that had come in with him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRing the bell for my ale, will you? You youngsters\xe2\x80\x99 business is your\r\nown pleasure, mostly. There\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry about it for anybody but\r\nyourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Squire\xe2\x80\x99s life was quite as idle as his sons\xe2\x80\x99, but it was a fiction\r\nkept up by himself and his contemporaries in Raveloe that youth was\r\nexclusively the period of folly, and that their aged wisdom was\r\nconstantly in a state of endurance mitigated by sarcasm. Godfrey\r\nwaited, before he spoke again, until the ale had been brought and the\r\ndoor closed\xe2\x80\x94an interval during which Fleet, the deer-hound, had\r\nconsumed enough bits of beef to make a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s holiday dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a cursed piece of ill-luck with Wildfire,\xe2\x80\x9d he began;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chappened the day before yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! broke his knees?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, after taking a draught of\r\nale. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you knew how to ride better than that, sir. I never\r\nthrew a horse down in my life. If I had, I might ha\xe2\x80\x99 whistled for\r\nanother, for _my_ father wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite so ready to unstring as some\r\nother fathers I know of. But they must turn over a new leaf\xe2\x80\x94_they_\r\nmust. What with mortgages and arrears, I\xe2\x80\x99m as short o\xe2\x80\x99 cash as a\r\nroadside pauper. And that fool Kimble says the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s talking\r\nabout peace. Why, the country wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a leg to stand on. Prices\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud run down like a jack, and I should never get my arrears, not if I\r\nsold all the fellows up. And there\xe2\x80\x99s that damned Fowler, I won\xe2\x80\x99t put up\r\nwith him any longer; I\xe2\x80\x99ve told Winthrop to go to Cox this very day. The\r\nlying scoundrel told me he\xe2\x80\x99d be sure to pay me a hundred last month. He\r\ntakes advantage because he\xe2\x80\x99s on that outlying farm, and thinks I shall\r\nforget him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Squire had delivered this speech in a coughing and interrupted\r\nmanner, but with no pause long enough for Godfrey to make it a pretext\r\nfor taking up the word again. He felt that his father meant to ward off\r\nany request for money on the ground of the misfortune with Wildfire,\r\nand that the emphasis he had thus been led to lay on his shortness of\r\ncash and his arrears was likely to produce an attitude of mind the\r\nutmost unfavourable for his own disclosure. But he must go on, now he\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s worse than breaking the horse\xe2\x80\x99s knees\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s been staked and\r\nkilled,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as soon as his father was silent, and had begun to\r\ncut his meat. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of asking you to buy me another\r\nhorse; I was only thinking I\xe2\x80\x99d lost the means of paying you with the\r\nprice of Wildfire, as I\xe2\x80\x99d meant to do. Dunsey took him to the hunt to\r\nsell him for me the other day, and after he\xe2\x80\x99d made a bargain for a\r\nhundred and twenty with Bryce, he went after the hounds, and took some\r\nfool\xe2\x80\x99s leap or other that did for the horse at once. If it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nfor that, I should have paid you a hundred pounds this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Squire had laid down his knife and fork, and was staring at his son\r\nin amazement, not being sufficiently quick of brain to form a probable\r\nguess as to what could have caused so strange an inversion of the\r\npaternal and filial relations as this proposition of his son to pay him\r\na hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, sir\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry\xe2\x80\x94I was quite to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFowler did pay that hundred pounds. He paid it to me, when I was over\r\nthere one day last month. And Dunsey bothered me for the money, and I\r\nlet him have it, because I hoped I should be able to pay it you before\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Squire was purple with anger before his son had done speaking, and\r\nfound utterance difficult. \xe2\x80\x9cYou let Dunsey have it, sir? And how long\r\nhave you been so thick with Dunsey that you must _collogue_ with him to\r\nembezzle my money? Are you turning out a scamp? I tell you I won\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nit. I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn the whole pack of you out of the house together, and\r\nmarry again. I\xe2\x80\x99d have you to remember, sir, my property\xe2\x80\x99s got no entail\r\non it;\xe2\x80\x94since my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s time the Casses can do as they like with\r\ntheir land. Remember that, sir. Let Dunsey have the money! Why should\r\nyou let Dunsey have the money? There\xe2\x80\x99s some lie at the bottom of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no lie, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spent the money\r\nmyself, but Dunsey bothered me, and I was a fool, and let him have it.\r\nBut I meant to pay it, whether he did or not. That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole story. I\r\nnever meant to embezzle money, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not the man to do it. You never\r\nknew me do a dishonest trick, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Dunsey, then? What do you stand talking there for? Go and\r\nfetch Dunsey, as I tell you, and let him give account of what he wanted\r\nthe money for, and what he\xe2\x80\x99s done with it. He shall repent it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nturn him out. I said I would, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. He shan\xe2\x80\x99t brave me. Go\r\nand fetch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDunsey isn\xe2\x80\x99t come back, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! did he break his own neck, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, with some\r\ndisgust at the idea that, in that case, he could not fulfil his threat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt, I believe, for the horse was found dead, and\r\nDunsey must have walked off. I daresay we shall see him again\r\nby-and-by. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what must you be letting him have my money for? Answer me that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Squire, attacking Godfrey again, since Dunsey was not within\r\nreach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, hesitatingly. That was a\r\nfeeble evasion, but Godfrey was not fond of lying, and, not being\r\nsufficiently aware that no sort of duplicity can long flourish without\r\nthe help of vocal falsehoods, he was quite unprepared with invented\r\nmotives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know? I tell you what it is, sir. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been up to some\r\ntrick, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve been bribing him not to tell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, with\r\na sudden acuteness which startled Godfrey, who felt his heart beat\r\nviolently at the nearness of his father\xe2\x80\x99s guess. The sudden alarm\r\npushed him on to take the next step\xe2\x80\x94a very slight impulse suffices for\r\nthat on a downward road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, trying to speak with careless ease, \xe2\x80\x9cit was a\r\nlittle affair between me and Dunsey; it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter to anybody else.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s hardly worth while to pry into young men\xe2\x80\x99s fooleries: it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave made any difference to you, sir, if I\xe2\x80\x99d not had the bad luck to\r\nlose Wildfire. I should have paid you the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFooleries! Pshaw! it\xe2\x80\x99s time you\xe2\x80\x99d done with fooleries. And I\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nyou know, sir, you _must_ ha\xe2\x80\x99 done with \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, frowning\r\nand casting an angry glance at his son. \xe2\x80\x9cYour goings-on are not what I\r\nshall find money for any longer. There\xe2\x80\x99s my grandfather had his stables\r\nfull o\xe2\x80\x99 horses, and kept a good house, too, and in worse times, by what\r\nI can make out; and so might I, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t four good-for-nothing\r\nfellows to hang on me like horse-leeches. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been too good a father\r\nto you all\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. But I shall pull up, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey was silent. He was not likely to be very penetrating in his\r\njudgments, but he had always had a sense that his father\xe2\x80\x99s indulgence\r\nhad not been kindness, and had had a vague longing for some discipline\r\nthat would have checked his own errant weakness and helped his better\r\nwill. The Squire ate his bread and meat hastily, took a deep draught of\r\nale, then turned his chair from the table, and began to speak again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be all the worse for you, you know\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d need try and help me\r\nkeep things together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ve often offered to take the management of things, but\r\nyou know you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken it ill always, and seemed to think I wanted to\r\npush you out of your place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing o\xe2\x80\x99 your offering or o\xe2\x80\x99 my taking it ill,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSquire, whose memory consisted in certain strong impressions unmodified\r\nby detail; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know, one while you seemed to be thinking o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmarrying, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer to put any obstacles in your way, as some\r\nfathers would. I\xe2\x80\x99d as lieve you married Lammeter\xe2\x80\x99s daughter as anybody.\r\nI suppose, if I\xe2\x80\x99d said you nay, you\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 kept on with it; but, for\r\nwant o\xe2\x80\x99 contradiction, you\xe2\x80\x99ve changed your mind. You\xe2\x80\x99re a shilly-shally\r\nfellow: you take after your poor mother. She never had a will of her\r\nown; a woman has no call for one, if she\xe2\x80\x99s got a proper man for her\r\nhusband. But _your_ wife had need have one, for you hardly know your\r\nown mind enough to make both your legs walk one way. The lass hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsaid downright she won\xe2\x80\x99t have you, has she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, feeling very hot and uncomfortable; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink she will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink! why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you the courage to ask her? Do you stick to it, you\r\nwant to have _her_\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no other woman I want to marry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, evasively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, let me make the offer for you, that\xe2\x80\x99s all, if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe pluck to do it yourself. Lammeter isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to be loath for his\r\ndaughter to marry into _my_ family, I should think. And as for the\r\npretty lass, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have her cousin\xe2\x80\x94and there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody else, as I\r\nsee, could ha\xe2\x80\x99 stood in your way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather let it be, please sir, at present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, in alarm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s a little offended with me just now, and I should like to\r\nspeak for myself. A man must manage these things for himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, speak, then, and manage it, and see if you can\xe2\x80\x99t turn over a new\r\nleaf. That\xe2\x80\x99s what a man must do when he thinks o\xe2\x80\x99 marrying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I can think of it at present, sir. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nto settle me on one of the farms, I suppose, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncome to live in this house with all my brothers. It\xe2\x80\x99s a different sort\r\nof life to what she\xe2\x80\x99s been used to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot come to live in this house? Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. You ask her, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, with a short, scornful laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather let the thing be, at present, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t try to hurry it on by saying anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall do what I choose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, \xe2\x80\x9cand I shall let you know\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m master; else you may turn out and find an estate to drop into\r\nsomewhere else. Go out and tell Winthrop not to go to Cox\xe2\x80\x99s, but wait\r\nfor me. And tell \xe2\x80\x99em to get my horse saddled. And stop: look out and\r\nget that hack o\xe2\x80\x99 Dunsey\xe2\x80\x99s sold, and hand me the money, will you? He\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nkeep no more hacks at my expense. And if you know where he\xe2\x80\x99s sneaking\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndaresay you do\xe2\x80\x94you may tell him to spare himself the journey o\xe2\x80\x99 coming\r\nback home. Let him turn ostler, and keep himself. He shan\xe2\x80\x99t hang on me\r\nany more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he is, sir; and if I did, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my place to tell\r\nhim to keep away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, moving towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it, sir, don\xe2\x80\x99t stay arguing, but go and order my horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Squire, taking up a pipe.\r\n\r\nGodfrey left the room, hardly knowing whether he were more relieved by\r\nthe sense that the interview was ended without having made any change\r\nin his position, or more uneasy that he had entangled himself still\r\nfurther in prevarication and deceit. What had passed about his\r\nproposing to Nancy had raised a new alarm, lest by some after-dinner\r\nwords of his father\xe2\x80\x99s to Mr. Lammeter he should be thrown into the\r\nembarrassment of being obliged absolutely to decline her when she\r\nseemed to be within his reach. He fled to his usual refuge, that of\r\nhoping for some unforeseen turn of fortune, some favourable chance\r\nwhich would save him from unpleasant consequences\xe2\x80\x94perhaps even justify\r\nhis insincerity by manifesting its prudence. And in this point of\r\ntrusting to some throw of fortune\xe2\x80\x99s dice, Godfrey can hardly be called\r\nspecially old-fashioned. Favourable Chance, I fancy, is the god of all\r\nmen who follow their own devices instead of obeying a law they believe\r\nin. Let even a polished man of these days get into a position he is\r\nashamed to avow, and his mind will be bent on all the possible issues\r\nthat may deliver him from the calculable results of that position. Let\r\nhim live outside his income, or shirk the resolute honest work that\r\nbrings wages, and he will presently find himself dreaming of a possible\r\nbenefactor, a possible simpleton who may be cajoled into using his\r\ninterest, a possible state of mind in some possible person not yet\r\nforthcoming. Let him neglect the responsibilities of his office, and he\r\nwill inevitably anchor himself on the chance that the thing left undone\r\nmay turn out not to be of the supposed importance. Let him betray his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, and he will adore that same cunning complexity\r\ncalled Chance, which gives him the hope that his friend will never\r\nknow. Let him forsake a decent craft that he may pursue the gentilities\r\nof a profession to which nature never called him, and his religion will\r\ninfallibly be the worship of blessed Chance, which he will believe in\r\nas the mighty creator of success. The evil principle deprecated in that\r\nreligion is the orderly sequence by which the seed brings forth a crop\r\nafter its kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nJustice Malam was naturally regarded in Tarley and Raveloe as a man of\r\ncapacious mind, seeing that he could draw much wider conclusions\r\nwithout evidence than could be expected of his neighbours who were not\r\non the Commission of the Peace. Such a man was not likely to neglect\r\nthe clue of the tinder-box, and an inquiry was set on foot concerning a\r\npedlar, name unknown, with curly black hair and a foreign complexion,\r\ncarrying a box of cutlery and jewellery, and wearing large rings in his\r\nears. But either because inquiry was too slow-footed to overtake him,\r\nor because the description applied to so many pedlars that inquiry did\r\nnot know how to choose among them, weeks passed away, and there was no\r\nother result concerning the robbery than a gradual cessation of the\r\nexcitement it had caused in Raveloe. Dunstan Cass\xe2\x80\x99s absence was hardly\r\na subject of remark: he had once before had a quarrel with his father,\r\nand had gone off, nobody knew whither, to return at the end of six\r\nweeks, take up his old quarters unforbidden, and swagger as usual. His\r\nown family, who equally expected this issue, with the sole difference\r\nthat the Squire was determined this time to forbid him the old\r\nquarters, never mentioned his absence; and when his uncle Kimble or Mr.\r\nOsgood noticed it, the story of his having killed Wildfire, and\r\ncommitted some offence against his father, was enough to prevent\r\nsurprise. To connect the fact of Dunsey\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance with that of\r\nthe robbery occurring on the same day, lay quite away from the track of\r\nevery one\xe2\x80\x99s thought\xe2\x80\x94even Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s, who had better reason than any one\r\nelse to know what his brother was capable of. He remembered no mention\r\nof the weaver between them since the time, twelve years ago, when it\r\nwas their boyish sport to deride him; and, besides, his imagination\r\nconstantly created an _alibi_ for Dunstan: he saw him continually in\r\nsome congenial haunt, to which he had walked off on leaving\r\nWildfire\xe2\x80\x94saw him sponging on chance acquaintances, and meditating a\r\nreturn home to the old amusement of tormenting his elder brother. Even\r\nif any brain in Raveloe had put the said two facts together, I doubt\r\nwhether a combination so injurious to the prescriptive respectability\r\nof a family with a mural monument and venerable tankards, would not\r\nhave been suppressed as of unsound tendency. But Christmas puddings,\r\nbrawn, and abundance of spirituous liquors, throwing the mental\r\noriginality into the channel of nightmare, are great preservatives\r\nagainst a dangerous spontaneity of waking thought.\r\n\r\nWhen the robbery was talked of at the Rainbow and elsewhere, in good\r\ncompany, the balance continued to waver between the rational\r\nexplanation founded on the tinder-box, and the theory of an\r\nimpenetrable mystery that mocked investigation. The advocates of the\r\ntinder-box-and-pedlar view considered the other side a muddle-headed\r\nand credulous set, who, because they themselves were wall-eyed,\r\nsupposed everybody else to have the same blank outlook; and the\r\nadherents of the inexplicable more than hinted that their antagonists\r\nwere animals inclined to crow before they had found any corn\xe2\x80\x94mere\r\nskimming-dishes in point of depth\xe2\x80\x94whose clear-sightedness consisted in\r\nsupposing there was nothing behind a barn-door because they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee through it; so that, though their controversy did not serve to\r\nelicit the fact concerning the robbery, it elicited some true opinions\r\nof collateral importance.\r\n\r\nBut while poor Silas\xe2\x80\x99s loss served thus to brush the slow current of\r\nRaveloe conversation, Silas himself was feeling the withering\r\ndesolation of that bereavement about which his neighbours were arguing\r\nat their ease. To any one who had observed him before he lost his gold,\r\nit might have seemed that so withered and shrunken a life as his could\r\nhardly be susceptible of a bruise, could hardly endure any subtraction\r\nbut such as would put an end to it altogether. But in reality it had\r\nbeen an eager life, filled with immediate purpose which fenced him in\r\nfrom the wide, cheerless unknown. It had been a clinging life; and\r\nthough the object round which its fibres had clung was a dead disrupted\r\nthing, it satisfied the need for clinging. But now the fence was broken\r\ndown\xe2\x80\x94the support was snatched away. Marner\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts could no longer\r\nmove in their old round, and were baffled by a blank like that which\r\nmeets a plodding ant when the earth has broken away on its homeward\r\npath. The loom was there, and the weaving, and the growing pattern in\r\nthe cloth; but the bright treasure in the hole under his feet was gone;\r\nthe prospect of handling and counting it was gone: the evening had no\r\nphantasm of delight to still the poor soul\xe2\x80\x99s craving. The thought of\r\nthe money he would get by his actual work could bring no joy, for its\r\nmeagre image was only a fresh reminder of his loss; and hope was too\r\nheavily crushed by the sudden blow for his imagination to dwell on the\r\ngrowth of a new hoard from that small beginning.\r\n\r\nHe filled up the blank with grief. As he sat weaving, he every now and\r\nthen moaned low, like one in pain: it was the sign that his thoughts\r\nhad come round again to the sudden chasm\xe2\x80\x94to the empty evening-time. And\r\nall the evening, as he sat in his loneliness by his dull fire, he\r\nleaned his elbows on his knees, and clasped his head with his hands,\r\nand moaned very low\xe2\x80\x94not as one who seeks to be heard.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he was not utterly forsaken in his trouble. The repulsion\r\nMarner had always created in his neighbours was partly dissipated by\r\nthe new light in which this misfortune had shown him. Instead of a man\r\nwho had more cunning than honest folks could come by, and, what was\r\nworse, had not the inclination to use that cunning in a neighbourly\r\nway, it was now apparent that Silas had not cunning enough to keep his\r\nown. He was generally spoken of as a \xe2\x80\x9cpoor mushed creatur\xe2\x80\x9d; and that\r\navoidance of his neighbours, which had before been referred to his\r\nill-will and to a probable addiction to worse company, was now\r\nconsidered mere craziness.\r\n\r\nThis change to a kindlier feeling was shown in various ways. The odour\r\nof Christmas cooking being on the wind, it was the season when\r\nsuperfluous pork and black puddings are suggestive of charity in\r\nwell-to-do families; and Silas\xe2\x80\x99s misfortune had brought him uppermost\r\nin the memory of housekeepers like Mrs. Osgood. Mr. Crackenthorp, too,\r\nwhile he admonished Silas that his money had probably been taken from\r\nhim because he thought too much of it and never came to church,\r\nenforced the doctrine by a present of pigs\xe2\x80\x99 pettitoes, well calculated\r\nto dissipate unfounded prejudices against the clerical character.\r\nNeighbours who had nothing but verbal consolation to give showed a\r\ndisposition not only to greet Silas and discuss his misfortune at some\r\nlength when they encountered him in the village, but also to take the\r\ntrouble of calling at his cottage and getting him to repeat all the\r\ndetails on the very spot; and then they would try to cheer him by\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Master Marner, you\xe2\x80\x99re no worse off nor other poor folks,\r\nafter all; and if you was to be crippled, the parish \xe2\x80\x99ud give you a\r\n\xe2\x80\x99lowance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI suppose one reason why we are seldom able to comfort our neighbours\r\nwith our words is that our goodwill gets adulterated, in spite of\r\nourselves, before it can pass our lips. We can send black puddings and\r\npettitoes without giving them a flavour of our own egoism; but language\r\nis a stream that is almost sure to smack of a mingled soil. There was a\r\nfair proportion of kindness in Raveloe; but it was often of a beery and\r\nbungling sort, and took the shape least allied to the complimentary and\r\nhypocritical.\r\n\r\nMr. Macey, for example, coming one evening expressly to let Silas know\r\nthat recent events had given him the advantage of standing more\r\nfavourably in the opinion of a man whose judgment was not formed\r\nlightly, opened the conversation by saying, as soon as he had seated\r\nhimself and adjusted his thumbs\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Master Marner, why, you\xe2\x80\x99ve no call to sit a-moaning. You\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\ndeal better off to ha\xe2\x80\x99 lost your money, nor to ha\xe2\x80\x99 kep it by foul\r\nmeans. I used to think, when you first come into these parts, as you\r\nwere no better nor you should be; you were younger a deal than what you\r\nare now; but you were allays a staring, white-faced creatur, partly\r\nlike a bald-faced calf, as I may say. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing: it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nevery queer-looksed thing as Old Harry\xe2\x80\x99s had the making of\xe2\x80\x94I mean,\r\nspeaking o\xe2\x80\x99 toads and such; for they\xe2\x80\x99re often harmless, like, and\r\nuseful against varmin. And it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much the same wi\xe2\x80\x99 you, as fur as\r\nI can see. Though as to the yarbs and stuff to cure the breathing, if\r\nyou brought that sort o\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge from distant parts, you might ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbeen a bit freer of it. And if the knowledge wasn\xe2\x80\x99t well come by, why,\r\nyou might ha\xe2\x80\x99 made up for it by coming to church reg\xe2\x80\x99lar; for, as for\r\nthe children as the Wise Woman charmed, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the christening of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em again and again, and they took the water just as well. And that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreasonable; for if Old Harry\xe2\x80\x99s a mind to do a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 kindness for a\r\nholiday, like, who\xe2\x80\x99s got anything against it? That\xe2\x80\x99s my thinking; and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been clerk o\xe2\x80\x99 this parish forty year, and I know, when the parson\r\nand me does the cussing of a Ash Wednesday, there\xe2\x80\x99s no cussing o\xe2\x80\x99 folks\r\nas have a mind to be cured without a doctor, let Kimble say what he\r\nwill. And so, Master Marner, as I was saying\xe2\x80\x94for there\xe2\x80\x99s windings i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthings as they may carry you to the fur end o\xe2\x80\x99 the prayer-book afore\r\nyou get back to \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94my advice is, as you keep up your sperrits; for as\r\nfor thinking you\xe2\x80\x99re a deep un, and ha\xe2\x80\x99 got more inside you nor \xe2\x80\x99ull\r\nbear daylight, I\xe2\x80\x99m not o\xe2\x80\x99 that opinion at all, and so I tell the\r\nneighbours. For, says I, you talk o\xe2\x80\x99 Master Marner making out a\r\ntale\xe2\x80\x94why, it\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense, that is: it \xe2\x80\x99ud take a \xe2\x80\x99cute man to make a\r\ntale like that; and, says I, he looked as scared as a rabbit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this discursive address Silas had continued motionless in his\r\nprevious attitude, leaning his elbows on his knees, and pressing his\r\nhands against his head. Mr. Macey, not doubting that he had been\r\nlistened to, paused, in the expectation of some appreciatory reply, but\r\nMarner remained silent. He had a sense that the old man meant to be\r\ngood-natured and neighbourly; but the kindness fell on him as sunshine\r\nfalls on the wretched\xe2\x80\x94he had no heart to taste it, and felt that it was\r\nvery far off him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Master Marner, have you got nothing to say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nMacey at last, with a slight accent of impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marner, slowly, shaking his head between his hands, \xe2\x80\x9cI thank\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94thank you\xe2\x80\x94kindly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, to be sure: I thought you would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey; \xe2\x80\x9cand my\r\nadvice is\xe2\x80\x94have you got a Sunday suit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubted it was so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, let me advise you to get a\r\nSunday suit: there\xe2\x80\x99s Tookey, he\xe2\x80\x99s a poor creatur, but he\xe2\x80\x99s got my\r\ntailoring business, and some o\xe2\x80\x99 my money in it, and he shall make a\r\nsuit at a low price, and give you trust, and then you can come to\r\nchurch, and be a bit neighbourly. Why, you\xe2\x80\x99ve never heared me say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen\xe2\x80\x9d since you come into these parts, and I recommend you to lose no\r\ntime, for it\xe2\x80\x99ll be poor work when Tookey has it all to himself, for I\r\nmayn\xe2\x80\x99t be equil to stand i\xe2\x80\x99 the desk at all, come another winter.\xe2\x80\x9d Here\r\nMr. Macey paused, perhaps expecting some sign of emotion in his hearer;\r\nbut not observing any, he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as for the money for the suit\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 clothes, why, you get a matter of a pound a-week at your weaving,\r\nMaster Marner, and you\xe2\x80\x99re a young man, eh, for all you look so mushed.\r\nWhy, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 been five-and-twenty when you come into these\r\nparts, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilas started a little at the change to a questioning tone, and\r\nanswered mildly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I can\xe2\x80\x99t rightly say\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a long while\r\nsince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter receiving such an answer as this, it is not surprising that Mr.\r\nMacey observed, later on in the evening at the Rainbow, that Marner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead was \xe2\x80\x9call of a muddle\xe2\x80\x9d, and that it was to be doubted if he ever\r\nknew when Sunday came round, which showed him a worse heathen than many\r\na dog.\r\n\r\nAnother of Silas\xe2\x80\x99s comforters, besides Mr. Macey, came to him with a\r\nmind highly charged on the same topic. This was Mrs. Winthrop, the\r\nwheelwright\xe2\x80\x99s wife. The inhabitants of Raveloe were not severely\r\nregular in their church-going, and perhaps there was hardly a person in\r\nthe parish who would not have held that to go to church every Sunday in\r\nthe calendar would have shown a greedy desire to stand well with\r\nHeaven, and get an undue advantage over their neighbours\xe2\x80\x94a wish to be\r\nbetter than the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon run\xe2\x80\x9d, that would have implied a reflection on\r\nthose who had had godfathers and godmothers as well as themselves, and\r\nhad an equal right to the burying-service. At the same time, it was\r\nunderstood to be requisite for all who were not household servants, or\r\nyoung men, to take the sacrament at one of the great festivals: Squire\r\nCass himself took it on Christmas-day; while those who were held to be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgood livers\xe2\x80\x9d went to church with greater, though still with moderate,\r\nfrequency.\r\n\r\nMrs. Winthrop was one of these: she was in all respects a woman of\r\nscrupulous conscience, so eager for duties that life seemed to offer\r\nthem too scantily unless she rose at half-past four, though this threw\r\na scarcity of work over the more advanced hours of the morning, which\r\nit was a constant problem with her to remove. Yet she had not the\r\nvixenish temper which is sometimes supposed to be a necessary condition\r\nof such habits: she was a very mild, patient woman, whose nature it was\r\nto seek out all the sadder and more serious elements of life, and\r\npasture her mind upon them. She was the person always first thought of\r\nin Raveloe when there was illness or death in a family, when leeches\r\nwere to be applied, or there was a sudden disappointment in a monthly\r\nnurse. She was a \xe2\x80\x9ccomfortable woman\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94good-looking, fresh-complexioned,\r\nhaving her lips always slightly screwed, as if she felt herself in a\r\nsick-room with the doctor or the clergyman present. But she was never\r\nwhimpering; no one had seen her shed tears; she was simply grave and\r\ninclined to shake her head and sigh, almost imperceptibly, like a\r\nfunereal mourner who is not a relation. It seemed surprising that Ben\r\nWinthrop, who loved his quart-pot and his joke, got along so well with\r\nDolly; but she took her husband\xe2\x80\x99s jokes and joviality as patiently as\r\neverything else, considering that \xe2\x80\x9cmen _would_ be so\xe2\x80\x9d, and viewing the\r\nstronger sex in the light of animals whom it had pleased Heaven to make\r\nnaturally troublesome, like bulls and turkey-cocks.\r\n\r\nThis good wholesome woman could hardly fail to have her mind drawn\r\nstrongly towards Silas Marner, now that he appeared in the light of a\r\nsufferer; and one Sunday afternoon she took her little boy Aaron with\r\nher, and went to call on Silas, carrying in her hand some small\r\nlard-cakes, flat paste-like articles much esteemed in Raveloe. Aaron,\r\nan apple-cheeked youngster of seven, with a clean starched frill which\r\nlooked like a plate for the apples, needed all his adventurous\r\ncuriosity to embolden him against the possibility that the big-eyed\r\nweaver might do him some bodily injury; and his dubiety was much\r\nincreased when, on arriving at the Stone-pits, they heard the\r\nmysterious sound of the loom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it is as I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Winthrop, sadly.\r\n\r\nThey had to knock loudly before Silas heard them; but when he did come\r\nto the door he showed no impatience, as he would once have done, at a\r\nvisit that had been unasked for and unexpected. Formerly, his heart had\r\nbeen as a locked casket with its treasure inside; but now the casket\r\nwas empty, and the lock was broken. Left groping in darkness, with his\r\nprop utterly gone, Silas had inevitably a sense, though a dull and\r\nhalf-despairing one, that if any help came to him it must come from\r\nwithout; and there was a slight stirring of expectation at the sight of\r\nhis fellow-men, a faint consciousness of dependence on their goodwill.\r\nHe opened the door wide to admit Dolly, but without otherwise returning\r\nher greeting than by moving the armchair a few inches as a sign that\r\nshe was to sit down in it. Dolly, as soon as she was seated, removed\r\nthe white cloth that covered her lard-cakes, and said in her gravest\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d a baking yisterday, Master Marner, and the lard-cakes turned out\r\nbetter nor common, and I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 asked you to accept some, if you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nthought well. I don\xe2\x80\x99t eat such things myself, for a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 bread\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI like from one year\xe2\x80\x99s end to the other; but men\xe2\x80\x99s stomichs are made so\r\ncomical, they want a change\xe2\x80\x94they do, I know, God help \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDolly sighed gently as she held out the cakes to Silas, who thanked her\r\nkindly and looked very close at them, absently, being accustomed to\r\nlook so at everything he took into his hand\xe2\x80\x94eyed all the while by the\r\nwondering bright orbs of the small Aaron, who had made an outwork of\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and was peeping round from behind it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s letters pricked on \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t read \xe2\x80\x99em myself,\r\nand there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody, not Mr. Macey himself, rightly knows what they\r\nmean; but they\xe2\x80\x99ve a good meaning, for they\xe2\x80\x99re the same as is on the\r\npulpit-cloth at church. What are they, Aaron, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAaron retreated completely behind his outwork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, go, that\xe2\x80\x99s naughty,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, mildly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, whativer the\r\nletters are, they\xe2\x80\x99ve a good meaning; and it\xe2\x80\x99s a stamp as has been in\r\nour house, Ben says, ever since he was a little un, and his mother used\r\nto put it on the cakes, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve allays put it on too; for if there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nany good, we\xe2\x80\x99ve need of it i\xe2\x80\x99 this world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s I. H. S.,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, at which proof of learning Aaron peeped\r\nround the chair again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to be sure, you can read \xe2\x80\x99em off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly. \xe2\x80\x9cBen\xe2\x80\x99s read \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nto me many and many a time, but they slip out o\xe2\x80\x99 my mind again; the\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x99s the pity, for they\xe2\x80\x99re good letters, else they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in the\r\nchurch; and so I prick \xe2\x80\x99em on all the loaves and all the cakes, though\r\nsometimes they won\xe2\x80\x99t hold, because o\xe2\x80\x99 the rising\xe2\x80\x94for, as I said, if\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s any good to be got we\xe2\x80\x99ve need of it i\xe2\x80\x99 this world\xe2\x80\x94that we have;\r\nand I hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll bring good to you, Master Marner, for it\xe2\x80\x99s wi\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\nwill I brought you the cakes; and you see the letters have held better\r\nnor common.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilas was as unable to interpret the letters as Dolly, but there was no\r\npossibility of misunderstanding the desire to give comfort that made\r\nitself heard in her quiet tones. He said, with more feeling than\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThank you\xe2\x80\x94thank you kindly.\xe2\x80\x9d But he laid down the cakes and\r\nseated himself absently\xe2\x80\x94drearily unconscious of any distinct benefit\r\ntowards which the cakes and the letters, or even Dolly\xe2\x80\x99s kindness,\r\ncould tend for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if there\xe2\x80\x99s good anywhere, we\xe2\x80\x99ve need of it,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Dolly, who\r\ndid not lightly forsake a serviceable phrase. She looked at Silas\r\npityingly as she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the church-bells this\r\nmorning, Master Marner? I doubt you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was Sunday. Living\r\nso lone here, you lose your count, I daresay; and then, when your loom\r\nmakes a noise, you can\xe2\x80\x99t hear the bells, more partic\xe2\x80\x99lar now the frost\r\nkills the sound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did; I heard \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, to whom Sunday bells were a mere\r\naccident of the day, and not part of its sacredness. There had been no\r\nbells in Lantern Yard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear heart!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, pausing before she spoke again. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what a\r\npity it is you should work of a Sunday, and not clean yourself\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\n_didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ go to church; for if you\xe2\x80\x99d a roasting bit, it might be as you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave it, being a lone man. But there\xe2\x80\x99s the bakehus, if you\r\ncould make up your mind to spend a twopence on the oven now and\r\nthen,\xe2\x80\x94not every week, in course\xe2\x80\x94I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to do that myself,\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nmight carry your bit o\xe2\x80\x99 dinner there, for it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but right to\r\nhave a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 summat hot of a Sunday, and not to make it as you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow your dinner from Saturday. But now, upo\xe2\x80\x99 Christmas-day, this\r\nblessed Christmas as is ever coming, if you was to take your dinner to\r\nthe bakehus, and go to church, and see the holly and the yew, and hear\r\nthe anthim, and then take the sacramen\xe2\x80\x99, you\xe2\x80\x99d be a deal the better,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99d know which end you stood on, and you could put your trust i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThem as knows better nor we do, seein\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 done what it lies on\r\nus all to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDolly\xe2\x80\x99s exhortation, which was an unusually long effort of speech for\r\nher, was uttered in the soothing persuasive tone with which she would\r\nhave tried to prevail on a sick man to take his medicine, or a basin of\r\ngruel for which he had no appetite. Silas had never before been closely\r\nurged on the point of his absence from church, which had only been\r\nthought of as a part of his general queerness; and he was too direct\r\nand simple to evade Dolly\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing o\xe2\x80\x99 church. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to\r\nchurch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, in a low tone of wonderment. Then bethinking herself\r\nof Silas\xe2\x80\x99s advent from an unknown country, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cCould it ha\xe2\x80\x99 been\r\nas they\xe2\x80\x99d no church where you was born?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, meditatively, sitting in his usual posture of\r\nleaning on his knees, and supporting his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was churches\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmany\xe2\x80\x94it was a big town. But I knew nothing of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94I went to chapel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDolly was much puzzled at this new word, but she was rather afraid of\r\ninquiring further, lest \xe2\x80\x9cchapel\xe2\x80\x9d might mean some haunt of wickedness.\r\nAfter a little thought, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Master Marner, it\xe2\x80\x99s niver too late to turn over a new leaf, and\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ve niver had no church, there\xe2\x80\x99s no telling the good it\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nyou. For I feel so set up and comfortable as niver was, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nand heard the prayers, and the singing to the praise and glory o\xe2\x80\x99 God,\r\nas Mr. Macey gives out\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Crackenthorp saying good words, and more\r\npartic\xe2\x80\x99lar on Sacramen\xe2\x80\x99 Day; and if a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble comes, I feel as I\r\ncan put up wi\xe2\x80\x99 it, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked for help i\xe2\x80\x99 the right quarter, and\r\ngev myself up to Them as we must all give ourselves up to at the last;\r\nand if we\xe2\x80\x99n done our part, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t to be believed as Them as are above\r\nus \xe2\x80\x99ull be worse nor we are, and come short o\xe2\x80\x99 Their\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Dolly\xe2\x80\x99s exposition of her simple Raveloe theology fell rather\r\nunmeaningly on Silas\xe2\x80\x99s ears, for there was no word in it that could\r\nrouse a memory of what he had known as religion, and his comprehension\r\nwas quite baffled by the plural pronoun, which was no heresy of\r\nDolly\xe2\x80\x99s, but only her way of avoiding a presumptuous familiarity. He\r\nremained silent, not feeling inclined to assent to the part of Dolly\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspeech which he fully understood\xe2\x80\x94her recommendation that he should go\r\nto church. Indeed, Silas was so unaccustomed to talk beyond the brief\r\nquestions and answers necessary for the transaction of his simple\r\nbusiness, that words did not easily come to him without the urgency of\r\na distinct purpose.\r\n\r\nBut now, little Aaron, having become used to the weaver\xe2\x80\x99s awful\r\npresence, had advanced to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side, and Silas, seeming to\r\nnotice him for the first time, tried to return Dolly\xe2\x80\x99s signs of\r\ngood-will by offering the lad a bit of lard-cake. Aaron shrank back a\r\nlittle, and rubbed his head against his mother\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, but still\r\nthought the piece of cake worth the risk of putting his hand out for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for shame, Aaron,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, taking him on her lap,\r\nhowever; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want cake again yet awhile. He\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful\r\nhearty,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, with a little sigh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat he is, God knows. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy youngest, and we spoil him sadly, for either me or the father must\r\nallays hev him in our sight\xe2\x80\x94that we must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stroked Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s brown head, and thought it must do Master Marner\r\ngood to see such a \xe2\x80\x9cpictur of a child\xe2\x80\x9d. But Marner, on the other side\r\nof the hearth, saw the neat-featured rosy face as a mere dim round,\r\nwith two dark spots in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s got a voice like a bird\xe2\x80\x94you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d Dolly went on;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che can sing a Christmas carril as his father\xe2\x80\x99s taught him; and I take\r\nit for a token as he\xe2\x80\x99ll come to good, as he can learn the good tunes so\r\nquick. Come, Aaron, stan\xe2\x80\x99 up and sing the carril to Master Marner,\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAaron replied by rubbing his forehead against his mother\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s naughty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cStan\xe2\x80\x99 up, when mother tells\r\nyou, and let me hold the cake till you\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAaron was not indisposed to display his talents, even to an ogre, under\r\nprotecting circumstances; and after a few more signs of coyness,\r\nconsisting chiefly in rubbing the backs of his hands over his eyes, and\r\nthen peeping between them at Master Marner, to see if he looked anxious\r\nfor the \xe2\x80\x9ccarril\xe2\x80\x9d, he at length allowed his head to be duly adjusted,\r\nand standing behind the table, which let him appear above it only as\r\nfar as his broad frill, so that he looked like a cherubic head\r\nuntroubled with a body, he began with a clear chirp, and in a melody\r\nthat had the rhythm of an industrious hammer\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod rest you, merry gentlemen,\r\nLet nothing you dismay,\r\nFor Jesus Christ our Savior\r\nWas born on Christmas-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nDolly listened with a devout look, glancing at Marner in some\r\nconfidence that this strain would help to allure him to church.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas music,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when Aaron had ended, and had\r\nsecured his piece of cake again. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no other music equil to the\r\nChristmas music\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHark the erol angils sing.\xe2\x80\x9d And you may judge what it\r\nis at church, Master Marner, with the bassoon and the voices, as you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to a better place a\xe2\x80\x99ready\xe2\x80\x94for I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspeak ill o\xe2\x80\x99 this world, seeing as Them put us in it as knows best\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nwhat wi\xe2\x80\x99 the drink, and the quarrelling, and the bad illnesses, and the\r\nhard dying, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen times and times, one\xe2\x80\x99s thankful to hear of a\r\nbetter. The boy sings pretty, don\xe2\x80\x99t he, Master Marner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, absently, \xe2\x80\x9cvery pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Christmas carol, with its hammer-like rhythm, had fallen on his\r\nears as strange music, quite unlike a hymn, and could have none of the\r\neffect Dolly contemplated. But he wanted to show her that he was\r\ngrateful, and the only mode that occurred to him was to offer Aaron a\r\nbit more cake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, thank you, Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, holding down Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwilling hands. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must be going home now. And so I wish you good-bye,\r\nMaster Marner; and if you ever feel anyways bad in your inside, as you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t fend for yourself, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come and clean up for you, and get you a\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 victual, and willing. But I beg and pray of you to leave off\r\nweaving of a Sunday, for it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for soul and body\xe2\x80\x94and the money as\r\ncomes i\xe2\x80\x99 that way \xe2\x80\x99ull be a bad bed to lie down on at the last, if it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t fly away, nobody knows where, like the white frost. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nexcuse me being that free with you, Master Marner, for I wish you\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94I do. Make your bow, Aaron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilas said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, and thank you kindly,\xe2\x80\x9d as he opened the door for\r\nDolly, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling relieved when she was gone\xe2\x80\x94relieved\r\nthat he might weave again and moan at his ease. Her simple view of life\r\nand its comforts, by which she had tried to cheer him, was only like a\r\nreport of unknown objects, which his imagination could not fashion. The\r\nfountains of human love and of faith in a divine love had not yet been\r\nunlocked, and his soul was still the shrunken rivulet, with only this\r\ndifference, that its little groove of sand was blocked up, and it\r\nwandered confusedly against dark obstruction.\r\n\r\nAnd so, notwithstanding the honest persuasions of Mr. Macey and Dolly\r\nWinthrop, Silas spent his Christmas-day in loneliness, eating his meat\r\nin sadness of heart, though the meat had come to him as a neighbourly\r\npresent. In the morning he looked out on the black frost that seemed to\r\npress cruelly on every blade of grass, while the half-icy red pool\r\nshivered under the bitter wind; but towards evening the snow began to\r\nfall, and curtained from him even that dreary outlook, shutting him\r\nclose up with his narrow grief. And he sat in his robbed home through\r\nthe livelong evening, not caring to close his shutters or lock his\r\ndoor, pressing his head between his hands and moaning, till the cold\r\ngrasped him and told him that his fire was grey.\r\n\r\nNobody in this world but himself knew that he was the same Silas Marner\r\nwho had once loved his fellow with tender love, and trusted in an\r\nunseen goodness. Even to himself that past experience had become dim.\r\n\r\nBut in Raveloe village the bells rang merrily, and the church was\r\nfuller than all through the rest of the year, with red faces among the\r\nabundant dark-green boughs\xe2\x80\x94faces prepared for a longer service than\r\nusual by an odorous breakfast of toast and ale. Those green boughs, the\r\nhymn and anthem never heard but at Christmas\xe2\x80\x94even the Athanasian Creed,\r\nwhich was discriminated from the others only as being longer and of\r\nexceptional virtue, since it was only read on rare occasions\xe2\x80\x94brought a\r\nvague exulting sense, for which the grown men could as little have\r\nfound words as the children, that something great and mysterious had\r\nbeen done for them in heaven above and in earth below, which they were\r\nappropriating by their presence. And then the red faces made their way\r\nthrough the black biting frost to their own homes, feeling themselves\r\nfree for the rest of the day to eat, drink, and be merry, and using\r\nthat Christian freedom without diffidence.\r\n\r\nAt Squire Cass\xe2\x80\x99s family party that day nobody mentioned Dunstan\xe2\x80\x94nobody\r\nwas sorry for his absence, or feared it would be too long. The doctor\r\nand his wife, uncle and aunt Kimble, were there, and the annual\r\nChristmas talk was carried through without any omissions, rising to the\r\nclimax of Mr. Kimble\xe2\x80\x99s experience when he walked the London hospitals\r\nthirty years back, together with striking professional anecdotes then\r\ngathered. Whereupon cards followed, with aunt Kimble\xe2\x80\x99s annual failure\r\nto follow suit, and uncle Kimble\xe2\x80\x99s irascibility concerning the odd\r\ntrick which was rarely explicable to him, when it was not on his side,\r\nwithout a general visitation of tricks to see that they were formed on\r\nsound principles: the whole being accompanied by a strong steaming\r\nodour of spirits-and-water.\r\n\r\nBut the party on Christmas-day, being a strictly family party, was not\r\nthe pre-eminently brilliant celebration of the season at the Red House.\r\nIt was the great dance on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve that made the glory of Squire\r\nCass\xe2\x80\x99s hospitality, as of his forefathers\xe2\x80\x99, time out of mind. This was\r\nthe occasion when all the society of Raveloe and Tarley, whether old\r\nacquaintances separated by long rutty distances, or cooled\r\nacquaintances separated by misunderstandings concerning runaway calves,\r\nor acquaintances founded on intermittent condescension, counted on\r\nmeeting and on comporting themselves with mutual appropriateness. This\r\nwas the occasion on which fair dames who came on pillions sent their\r\nbandboxes before them, supplied with more than their evening costume;\r\nfor the feast was not to end with a single evening, like a paltry town\r\nentertainment, where the whole supply of eatables is put on the table\r\nat once, and bedding is scanty. The Red House was provisioned as if for\r\na siege; and as for the spare feather-beds ready to be laid on floors,\r\nthey were as plentiful as might naturally be expected in a family that\r\nhad killed its own geese for many generations.\r\n\r\nGodfrey Cass was looking forward to this New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve with a foolish\r\nreckless longing, that made him half deaf to his importunate companion,\r\nAnxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDunsey will be coming home soon: there will be a great blow-up, and\r\nhow will you bribe his spite to silence?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he won\xe2\x80\x99t come home before New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I shall sit by Nancy then, and dance with her, and get a kind look\r\nfrom her in spite of herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut money is wanted in another quarter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anxiety, in a louder\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cand how will you get it without selling your mother\xe2\x80\x99s diamond\r\npin? And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get it...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but something may happen to make things easier. At any rate,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s one pleasure for me close at hand: Nancy is coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and suppose your father should bring matters to a pass that will\r\noblige you to decline marrying her\xe2\x80\x94and to give your reasons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, and don\xe2\x80\x99t worry me. I can see Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, just as\r\nthey will look at me, and feel her hand in mine already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Anxiety went on, though in noisy Christmas company; refusing to be\r\nutterly quieted even by much drinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSome women, I grant, would not appear to advantage seated on a pillion,\r\nand attired in a drab joseph and a drab beaver-bonnet, with a crown\r\nresembling a small stew-pan; for a garment suggesting a coachman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreatcoat, cut out under an exiguity of cloth that would only allow of\r\nminiature capes, is not well adapted to conceal deficiencies of\r\ncontour, nor is drab a colour that will throw sallow cheeks into lively\r\ncontrast. It was all the greater triumph to Miss Nancy Lammeter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeauty that she looked thoroughly bewitching in that costume, as,\r\nseated on the pillion behind her tall, erect father, she held one arm\r\nround him, and looked down, with open-eyed anxiety, at the treacherous\r\nsnow-covered pools and puddles, which sent up formidable splashings of\r\nmud under the stamp of Dobbin\xe2\x80\x99s foot. A painter would, perhaps, have\r\npreferred her in those moments when she was free from\r\nself-consciousness; but certainly the bloom on her cheeks was at its\r\nhighest point of contrast with the surrounding drab when she arrived at\r\nthe door of the Red House, and saw Mr. Godfrey Cass ready to lift her\r\nfrom the pillion. She wished her sister Priscilla had come up at the\r\nsame time behind the servant, for then she would have contrived that\r\nMr. Godfrey should have lifted off Priscilla first, and, in the\r\nmeantime, she would have persuaded her father to go round to the\r\nhorse-block instead of alighting at the door-steps. It was very\r\npainful, when you had made it quite clear to a young man that you were\r\ndetermined not to marry him, however much he might wish it, that he\r\nwould still continue to pay you marked attentions; besides, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe always show the same attentions, if he meant them sincerely, instead\r\nof being so strange as Mr. Godfrey Cass was, sometimes behaving as if\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak to her, and taking no notice of her for weeks\r\nand weeks, and then, all on a sudden, almost making love again?\r\nMoreover, it was quite plain he had no real love for her, else he would\r\nnot let people have _that_ to say of him which they did say. Did he\r\nsuppose that Miss Nancy Lammeter was to be won by any man, squire or no\r\nsquire, who led a bad life? That was not what she had been used to see\r\nin her own father, who was the soberest and best man in that\r\ncountry-side, only a little hot and hasty now and then, if things were\r\nnot done to the minute.\r\n\r\nAll these thoughts rushed through Miss Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s mind, in their habitual\r\nsuccession, in the moments between her first sight of Mr. Godfrey Cass\r\nstanding at the door and her own arrival there. Happily, the Squire\r\ncame out too and gave a loud greeting to her father, so that, somehow,\r\nunder cover of this noise she seemed to find concealment for her\r\nconfusion and neglect of any suitably formal behaviour, while she was\r\nbeing lifted from the pillion by strong arms which seemed to find her\r\nridiculously small and light. And there was the best reason for\r\nhastening into the house at once, since the snow was beginning to fall\r\nagain, threatening an unpleasant journey for such guests as were still\r\non the road. These were a small minority; for already the afternoon was\r\nbeginning to decline, and there would not be too much time for the\r\nladies who came from a distance to attire themselves in readiness for\r\nthe early tea which was to inspirit them for the dance.\r\n\r\nThere was a buzz of voices through the house, as Miss Nancy entered,\r\nmingled with the scrape of a fiddle preluding in the kitchen; but the\r\nLammeters were guests whose arrival had evidently been thought of so\r\nmuch that it had been watched for from the windows, for Mrs. Kimble,\r\nwho did the honours at the Red House on these great occasions, came\r\nforward to meet Miss Nancy in the hall, and conduct her up-stairs. Mrs.\r\nKimble was the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s sister, as well as the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x94a double\r\ndignity, with which her diameter was in direct proportion; so that, a\r\njourney up-stairs being rather fatiguing to her, she did not oppose\r\nMiss Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s request to be allowed to find her way alone to the Blue\r\nRoom, where the Miss Lammeters\xe2\x80\x99 bandboxes had been deposited on their\r\narrival in the morning.\r\n\r\nThere was hardly a bedroom in the house where feminine compliments were\r\nnot passing and feminine toilettes going forward, in various stages, in\r\nspace made scanty by extra beds spread upon the floor; and Miss Nancy,\r\nas she entered the Blue Room, had to make her little formal curtsy to a\r\ngroup of six. On the one hand, there were ladies no less important than\r\nthe two Miss Gunns, the wine merchant\xe2\x80\x99s daughters from Lytherly,\r\ndressed in the height of fashion, with the tightest skirts and the\r\nshortest waists, and gazed at by Miss Ladbrook (of the Old Pastures)\r\nwith a shyness not unsustained by inward criticism. Partly, Miss\r\nLadbrook felt that her own skirt must be regarded as unduly lax by the\r\nMiss Gunns, and partly, that it was a pity the Miss Gunns did not show\r\nthat judgment which she herself would show if she were in their place,\r\nby stopping a little on this side of the fashion. On the other hand,\r\nMrs. Ladbrook was standing in skull-cap and front, with her turban in\r\nher hand, curtsying and smiling blandly and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nto another lady in similar circumstances, who had politely offered the\r\nprecedence at the looking-glass.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Nancy had no sooner made her curtsy than an elderly lady came\r\nforward, whose full white muslin kerchief, and mob-cap round her curls\r\nof smooth grey hair, were in daring contrast with the puffed yellow\r\nsatins and top-knotted caps of her neighbours. She approached Miss\r\nNancy with much primness, and said, with a slow, treble suavity\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNiece, I hope I see you well in health.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Nancy kissed her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheek dutifully, and answered, with the same sort of amiable primness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite well, I thank you, aunt; and I hope I see you the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, niece; I keep my health for the present. And how is my\r\nbrother-in-law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese dutiful questions and answers were continued until it was\r\nascertained in detail that the Lammeters were all as well as usual, and\r\nthe Osgoods likewise, also that niece Priscilla must certainly arrive\r\nshortly, and that travelling on pillions in snowy weather was\r\nunpleasant, though a joseph was a great protection. Then Nancy was\r\nformally introduced to her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s visitors, the Miss Gunns, as being\r\nthe daughters of a mother known to _their_ mother, though now for the\r\nfirst time induced to make a journey into these parts; and these ladies\r\nwere so taken by surprise at finding such a lovely face and figure in\r\nan out-of-the-way country place, that they began to feel some curiosity\r\nabout the dress she would put on when she took off her joseph. Miss\r\nNancy, whose thoughts were always conducted with the propriety and\r\nmoderation conspicuous in her manners, remarked to herself that the\r\nMiss Gunns were rather hard-featured than otherwise, and that such very\r\nlow dresses as they wore might have been attributed to vanity if their\r\nshoulders had been pretty, but that, being as they were, it was not\r\nreasonable to suppose that they showed their necks from a love of\r\ndisplay, but rather from some obligation not inconsistent with sense\r\nand modesty. She felt convinced, as she opened her box, that this must\r\nbe her aunt Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, for Miss Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s mind resembled her\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s to a degree that everybody said was surprising, considering the\r\nkinship was on Mr. Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s side; and though you might not have\r\nsupposed it from the formality of their greeting, there was a devoted\r\nattachment and mutual admiration between aunt and niece. Even Miss\r\nNancy\xe2\x80\x99s refusal of her cousin Gilbert Osgood (on the ground solely that\r\nhe was her cousin), though it had grieved her aunt greatly, had not in\r\nthe least cooled the preference which had determined her to leave Nancy\r\nseveral of her hereditary ornaments, let Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s future wife be whom\r\nshe might.\r\n\r\nThree of the ladies quickly retired, but the Miss Gunns were quite\r\ncontent that Mrs. Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s inclination to remain with her niece gave\r\nthem also a reason for staying to see the rustic beauty\xe2\x80\x99s toilette. And\r\nit was really a pleasure\xe2\x80\x94from the first opening of the bandbox, where\r\neverything smelt of lavender and rose-leaves, to the clasping of the\r\nsmall coral necklace that fitted closely round her little white neck.\r\nEverything belonging to Miss Nancy was of delicate purity and\r\nnattiness: not a crease was where it had no business to be, not a bit\r\nof her linen professed whiteness without fulfilling its profession; the\r\nvery pins on her pincushion were stuck in after a pattern from which\r\nshe was careful to allow no aberration; and as for her own person, it\r\ngave the same idea of perfect unvarying neatness as the body of a\r\nlittle bird. It is true that her light-brown hair was cropped behind\r\nlike a boy\xe2\x80\x99s, and was dressed in front in a number of flat rings, that\r\nlay quite away from her face; but there was no sort of coiffure that\r\ncould make Miss Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s cheek and neck look otherwise than pretty; and\r\nwhen at last she stood complete in her silvery twilled silk, her lace\r\ntucker, her coral necklace, and coral ear-drops, the Miss Gunns could\r\nsee nothing to criticise except her hands, which bore the traces of\r\nbutter-making, cheese-crushing, and even still coarser work. But Miss\r\nNancy was not ashamed of that, for even while she was dressing she\r\nnarrated to her aunt how she and Priscilla had packed their boxes\r\nyesterday, because this morning was baking morning, and since they were\r\nleaving home, it was desirable to make a good supply of meat-pies for\r\nthe kitchen; and as she concluded this judicious remark, she turned to\r\nthe Miss Gunns that she might not commit the rudeness of not including\r\nthem in the conversation. The Miss Gunns smiled stiffly, and thought\r\nwhat a pity it was that these rich country people, who could afford to\r\nbuy such good clothes (really Miss Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s lace and silk were very\r\ncostly), should be brought up in utter ignorance and vulgarity. She\r\nactually said \xe2\x80\x9cmate\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cmeat\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99appen\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9coss\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chorse\xe2\x80\x9d, which, to young ladies living in good Lytherly society, who\r\nhabitually said \xe2\x80\x99orse, even in domestic privacy, and only said \xe2\x80\x99appen\r\non the right occasions, was necessarily shocking. Miss Nancy, indeed,\r\nhad never been to any school higher than Dame Tedman\xe2\x80\x99s: her\r\nacquaintance with profane literature hardly went beyond the rhymes she\r\nhad worked in her large sampler under the lamb and the shepherdess; and\r\nin order to balance an account, she was obliged to effect her\r\nsubtraction by removing visible metallic shillings and sixpences from a\r\nvisible metallic total. There is hardly a servant-maid in these days\r\nwho is not better informed than Miss Nancy; yet she had the essential\r\nattributes of a lady\xe2\x80\x94high veracity, delicate honour in her dealings,\r\ndeference to others, and refined personal habits,\xe2\x80\x94and lest these should\r\nnot suffice to convince grammatical fair ones that her feelings can at\r\nall resemble theirs, I will add that she was slightly proud and\r\nexacting, and as constant in her affection towards a baseless opinion\r\nas towards an erring lover.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety about sister Priscilla, which had grown rather active by\r\nthe time the coral necklace was clasped, was happily ended by the\r\nentrance of that cheerful-looking lady herself, with a face made blowsy\r\nby cold and damp. After the first questions and greetings, she turned\r\nto Nancy, and surveyed her from head to foot\xe2\x80\x94then wheeled her round, to\r\nascertain that the back view was equally faultless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think o\xe2\x80\x99 _these_ gowns, aunt Osgood?\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla,\r\nwhile Nancy helped her to unrobe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery handsome indeed, niece,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Osgood, with a slight increase\r\nof formality. She always thought niece Priscilla too rough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to have the same as Nancy, you know, for all I\xe2\x80\x99m five\r\nyears older, and it makes me look yallow; for she never _will_ have\r\nanything without I have mine just like it, because she wants us to look\r\nlike sisters. And I tell her, folks \xe2\x80\x99ull think it\xe2\x80\x99s my weakness makes\r\nme fancy as I shall look pretty in what she looks pretty in. For I _am_\r\nugly\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that: I feature my father\xe2\x80\x99s family. But, law! I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d Priscilla here turned to the Miss Gunns, rattling\r\non in too much preoccupation with the delight of talking, to notice\r\nthat her candour was not appreciated. \xe2\x80\x9cThe pretty uns do for\r\nfly-catchers\xe2\x80\x94they keep the men off us. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no opinion o\xe2\x80\x99 the men, Miss\r\nGunn\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what _you_ have. And as for fretting and stewing\r\nabout what _they_\xe2\x80\x99ll think of you from morning till night, and making\r\nyour life uneasy about what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing when they\xe2\x80\x99re out o\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\nsight\xe2\x80\x94as I tell Nancy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a folly no woman need be guilty of, if\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s got a good father and a good home: let her leave it to them as\r\nhave got no fortin, and can\xe2\x80\x99t help themselves. As I say, Mr.\r\nHave-your-own-way is the best husband, and the only one I\xe2\x80\x99d ever\r\npromise to obey. I know it isn\xe2\x80\x99t pleasant, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been used to\r\nliving in a big way, and managing hogsheads and all that, to go and put\r\nyour nose in by somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s fireside, or to sit down by yourself to\r\na scrag or a knuckle; but, thank God! my father\xe2\x80\x99s a sober man and\r\nlikely to live; and if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a man by the chimney-corner, it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if he\xe2\x80\x99s childish\xe2\x80\x94the business needn\xe2\x80\x99t be broke up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe delicate process of getting her narrow gown over her head without\r\ninjury to her smooth curls, obliged Miss Priscilla to pause in this\r\nrapid survey of life, and Mrs. Osgood seized the opportunity of rising\r\nand saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, niece, you\xe2\x80\x99ll follow us. The Miss Gunns will like to go down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, when they were alone, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve offended the Miss\r\nGunns, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done, child?\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla, in some alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you asked them if they minded about being ugly\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re so very\r\nblunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw, did I? Well, it popped out: it\xe2\x80\x99s a mercy I said no more, for I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na bad un to live with folks when they don\xe2\x80\x99t like the truth. But as for\r\nbeing ugly, look at me, child, in this silver-coloured silk\xe2\x80\x94I told you\r\nhow it \xe2\x80\x99ud be\xe2\x80\x94I look as yallow as a daffadil. Anybody \xe2\x80\x99ud say you\r\nwanted to make a mawkin of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Priscy, don\xe2\x80\x99t say so. I begged and prayed of you not to let us\r\nhave this silk if you\xe2\x80\x99d like another better. I was willing to have\r\n_your_ choice, you know I was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, in anxious\r\nself-vindication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, child! you know you\xe2\x80\x99d set your heart on this; and reason\r\ngood, for you\xe2\x80\x99re the colour o\xe2\x80\x99 cream. It \xe2\x80\x99ud be fine doings for you to\r\ndress yourself to suit _my_ skin. What I find fault with, is that\r\nnotion o\xe2\x80\x99 yours as I must dress myself just like you. But you do as you\r\nlike with me\xe2\x80\x94you always did, from when first you begun to walk. If you\r\nwanted to go the field\xe2\x80\x99s length, the field\xe2\x80\x99s length you\xe2\x80\x99d go; and there\r\nwas no whipping you, for you looked as prim and innicent as a daisy all\r\nthe while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPriscy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, gently, as she fastened a coral necklace, exactly\r\nlike her own, round Priscilla\xe2\x80\x99s neck, which was very far from being\r\nlike her own, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to give way as far as is right, but\r\nwho shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dress alike if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t sisters? Would you have us go\r\nabout looking as if we were no kin to one another\xe2\x80\x94us that have got no\r\nmother and not another sister in the world? I\xe2\x80\x99d do what was right, if I\r\ndressed in a gown dyed with cheese-colouring; and I\xe2\x80\x99d rather you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nchoose, and let me wear what pleases you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you go again! You\xe2\x80\x99d come round to the same thing if one talked\r\nto you from Saturday night till Saturday morning. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine fun to\r\nsee how you\xe2\x80\x99ll master your husband and never raise your voice above the\r\nsinging o\xe2\x80\x99 the kettle all the while. I like to see the men mastered!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk _so_, Priscy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, blushing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\never to be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you never mean a fiddlestick\xe2\x80\x99s end!\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla, as she\r\narranged her discarded dress, and closed her bandbox. \xe2\x80\x9cWho shall _I_\r\nhave to work for when father\xe2\x80\x99s gone, if you are to go and take notions\r\nin your head and be an old maid, because some folks are no better than\r\nthey should be? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 patience with you\xe2\x80\x94sitting on an\r\naddled egg for ever, as if there was never a fresh un in the world. One\r\nold maid\xe2\x80\x99s enough out o\xe2\x80\x99 two sisters; and I shall do credit to a single\r\nlife, for God A\xe2\x80\x99mighty meant me for it. Come, we can go down now. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nas ready as a mawkin _can_ be\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing awanting to frighten the\r\ncrows, now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my ear-droppers in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the two Miss Lammeters walked into the large parlour together, any\r\none who did not know the character of both might certainly have\r\nsupposed that the reason why the square-shouldered, clumsy,\r\nhigh-featured Priscilla wore a dress the facsimile of her pretty\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s, was either the mistaken vanity of the one, or the malicious\r\ncontrivance of the other in order to set off her own rare beauty. But\r\nthe good-natured self-forgetful cheeriness and common-sense of\r\nPriscilla would soon have dissipated the one suspicion; and the modest\r\ncalm of Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s speech and manners told clearly of a mind free from all\r\ndisavowed devices.\r\n\r\nPlaces of honour had been kept for the Miss Lammeters near the head of\r\nthe principal tea-table in the wainscoted parlour, now looking fresh\r\nand pleasant with handsome branches of holly, yew, and laurel, from the\r\nabundant growths of the old garden; and Nancy felt an inward flutter,\r\nthat no firmness of purpose could prevent, when she saw Mr. Godfrey\r\nCass advancing to lead her to a seat between himself and Mr.\r\nCrackenthorp, while Priscilla was called to the opposite side between\r\nher father and the Squire. It certainly did make some difference to\r\nNancy that the lover she had given up was the young man of quite the\r\nhighest consequence in the parish\xe2\x80\x94at home in a venerable and unique\r\nparlour, which was the extremity of grandeur in her experience, a\r\nparlour where _she_ might one day have been mistress, with the\r\nconsciousness that she was spoken of as \xe2\x80\x9cMadam Cass\xe2\x80\x9d, the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife. These circumstances exalted her inward drama in her own eyes, and\r\ndeepened the emphasis with which she declared to herself that not the\r\nmost dazzling rank should induce her to marry a man whose conduct\r\nshowed him careless of his character, but that, \xe2\x80\x9clove once, love\r\nalways\xe2\x80\x9d, was the motto of a true and pure woman, and no man should ever\r\nhave any right over her which would be a call on her to destroy the\r\ndried flowers that she treasured, and always would treasure, for\r\nGodfrey Cass\xe2\x80\x99s sake. And Nancy was capable of keeping her word to\r\nherself under very trying conditions. Nothing but a becoming blush\r\nbetrayed the moving thoughts that urged themselves upon her as she\r\naccepted the seat next to Mr. Crackenthorp; for she was so\r\ninstinctively neat and adroit in all her actions, and her pretty lips\r\nmet each other with such quiet firmness, that it would have been\r\ndifficult for her to appear agitated.\r\n\r\nIt was not the rector\xe2\x80\x99s practice to let a charming blush pass without\r\nan appropriate compliment. He was not in the least lofty or\r\naristocratic, but simply a merry-eyed, small-featured, grey-haired man,\r\nwith his chin propped by an ample, many-creased white neckcloth which\r\nseemed to predominate over every other point in his person, and somehow\r\nto impress its peculiar character on his remarks; so that to have\r\nconsidered his amenities apart from his cravat would have been a\r\nsevere, and perhaps a dangerous, effort of abstraction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, Miss Nancy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning his head within his cravat and\r\nsmiling down pleasantly upon her, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen anybody pretends this has been\r\na severe winter, I shall tell them I saw the roses blooming on New\r\nYear\xe2\x80\x99s Eve\xe2\x80\x94eh, Godfrey, what do _you_ say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey made no reply, and avoided looking at Nancy very markedly; for\r\nthough these complimentary personalities were held to be in excellent\r\ntaste in old-fashioned Raveloe society, reverent love has a politeness\r\nof its own which it teaches to men otherwise of small schooling. But\r\nthe Squire was rather impatient at Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s showing himself a dull\r\nspark in this way. By this advanced hour of the day, the Squire was\r\nalways in higher spirits than we have seen him in at the\r\nbreakfast-table, and felt it quite pleasant to fulfil the hereditary\r\nduty of being noisily jovial and patronizing: the large silver\r\nsnuff-box was in active service and was offered without fail to all\r\nneighbours from time to time, however often they might have declined\r\nthe favour. At present, the Squire had only given an express welcome to\r\nthe heads of families as they appeared; but always as the evening\r\ndeepened, his hospitality rayed out more widely, till he had tapped the\r\nyoungest guests on the back and shown a peculiar fondness for their\r\npresence, in the full belief that they must feel their lives made happy\r\nby their belonging to a parish where there was such a hearty man as\r\nSquire Cass to invite them and wish them well. Even in this early stage\r\nof the jovial mood, it was natural that he should wish to supply his\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s deficiencies by looking and speaking for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, offering his snuff-box to Mr. Lammeter, who for\r\nthe second time bowed his head and waved his hand in stiff rejection of\r\nthe offer, \xe2\x80\x9cus old fellows may wish ourselves young to-night, when we\r\nsee the mistletoe-bough in the White Parlour. It\xe2\x80\x99s true, most things\r\nare gone back\xe2\x80\x99ard in these last thirty years\xe2\x80\x94the country\xe2\x80\x99s going down\r\nsince the old king fell ill. But when I look at Miss Nancy here, I\r\nbegin to think the lasses keep up their quality;\xe2\x80\x94ding me if I remember\r\na sample to match her, not when I was a fine young fellow, and thought\r\na deal about my pigtail. No offence to you, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, bending\r\nto Mrs. Crackenthorp, who sat by him, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know _you_ when you\r\nwere as young as Miss Nancy here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Crackenthorp\xe2\x80\x94a small blinking woman, who fidgeted incessantly with\r\nher lace, ribbons, and gold chain, turning her head about and making\r\nsubdued noises, very much like a guinea-pig that twitches its nose and\r\nsoliloquizes in all company indiscriminately\xe2\x80\x94now blinked and fidgeted\r\ntowards the Squire, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no\xe2\x80\x94no offence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis emphatic compliment of the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s to Nancy was felt by others\r\nbesides Godfrey to have a diplomatic significance; and her father gave\r\na slight additional erectness to his back, as he looked across the\r\ntable at her with complacent gravity. That grave and orderly senior was\r\nnot going to bate a jot of his dignity by seeming elated at the notion\r\nof a match between his family and the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s: he was gratified by any\r\nhonour paid to his daughter; but he must see an alteration in several\r\nways before his consent would be vouchsafed. His spare but healthy\r\nperson, and high-featured firm face, that looked as if it had never\r\nbeen flushed by excess, was in strong contrast, not only with the\r\nSquire\xe2\x80\x99s, but with the appearance of the Raveloe farmers generally\xe2\x80\x94in\r\naccordance with a favourite saying of his own, that \xe2\x80\x9cbreed was stronger\r\nthan pasture\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful like what her mother was, though; isn\xe2\x80\x99t she,\r\nKimble?\xe2\x80\x9d said the stout lady of that name, looking round for her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nBut Doctor Kimble (country apothecaries in old days enjoyed that title\r\nwithout authority of diploma), being a thin and agile man, was flitting\r\nabout the room with his hands in his pockets, making himself agreeable\r\nto his feminine patients, with medical impartiality, and being welcomed\r\neverywhere as a doctor by hereditary right\xe2\x80\x94not one of those miserable\r\napothecaries who canvass for practice in strange neighbourhoods, and\r\nspend all their income in starving their one horse, but a man of\r\nsubstance, able to keep an extravagant table like the best of his\r\npatients. Time out of mind the Raveloe doctor had been a Kimble; Kimble\r\nwas inherently a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s name; and it was difficult to contemplate\r\nfirmly the melancholy fact that the actual Kimble had no son, so that\r\nhis practice might one day be handed over to a successor with the\r\nincongruous name of Taylor or Johnson. But in that case the wiser\r\npeople in Raveloe would employ Dr. Blick of Flitton\xe2\x80\x94as less unnatural.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you speak to me, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the authentic doctor, coming\r\nquickly to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s side; but, as if foreseeing that she would be too\r\nmuch out of breath to repeat her remark, he went on immediately\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHa,\r\nMiss Priscilla, the sight of you revives the taste of that\r\nsuper-excellent pork-pie. I hope the batch isn\xe2\x80\x99t near an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, it is, doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for it\r\nthe next shall be as good. My pork-pies don\xe2\x80\x99t turn out well by chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as your doctoring does, eh, Kimble?\xe2\x80\x94because folks forget to take\r\nyour physic, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, who regarded physic and doctors as\r\nmany loyal churchmen regard the church and the clergy\xe2\x80\x94tasting a joke\r\nagainst them when he was in health, but impatiently eager for their aid\r\nwhen anything was the matter with him. He tapped his box, and looked\r\nround with a triumphant laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she has a quick wit, my friend Priscilla has,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor,\r\nchoosing to attribute the epigram to a lady rather than allow a\r\nbrother-in-law that advantage over him. \xe2\x80\x9cShe saves a little pepper to\r\nsprinkle over her talk\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why she never puts too much\r\ninto her pies. There\xe2\x80\x99s my wife now, she never has an answer at her\r\ntongue\xe2\x80\x99s end; but if I offend her, she\xe2\x80\x99s sure to scarify my throat with\r\nblack pepper the next day, or else give me the colic with watery\r\ngreens. That\xe2\x80\x99s an awful tit-for-tat.\xe2\x80\x9d Here the vivacious doctor made a\r\npathetic grimace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever hear the like?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Kimble, laughing above her\r\ndouble chin with much good-humour, aside to Mrs. Crackenthorp, who\r\nblinked and nodded, and seemed to intend a smile, which, by the\r\ncorrelation of forces, went off in small twitchings and noises.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of tit-for-tat adopted in your profession,\r\nKimble, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve a grudge against a patient,\xe2\x80\x9d said the rector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever do have a grudge against our patients,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Kimble, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\r\nwhen they leave us: and then, you see, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t the chance of\r\nprescribing for \xe2\x80\x99em. Ha, Miss Nancy,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, suddenly skipping\r\nto Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s side, \xe2\x80\x9cyou won\xe2\x80\x99t forget your promise? You\xe2\x80\x99re to save a dance\r\nfor me, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Kimble, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be too for\xe2\x80\x99ard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire. \xe2\x80\x9cGive\r\nthe young uns fair-play. There\xe2\x80\x99s my son Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99ll be wanting to have a\r\nround with you if you run off with Miss Nancy. He\xe2\x80\x99s bespoke her for the\r\nfirst dance, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound. Eh, sir! what do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\nthrowing himself backward, and looking at Godfrey. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you asked\r\nMiss Nancy to open the dance with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey, sorely uncomfortable under this significant insistence about\r\nNancy, and afraid to think where it would end by the time his father\r\nhad set his usual hospitable example of drinking before and after\r\nsupper, saw no course open but to turn to Nancy and say, with as little\r\nawkwardness as possible\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I\xe2\x80\x99ve not asked her yet, but I hope she\xe2\x80\x99ll consent\xe2\x80\x94if somebody else\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t been before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not engaged myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, quietly, though blushingly.\r\n(If Mr. Godfrey founded any hopes on her consenting to dance with him,\r\nhe would soon be undeceived; but there was no need for her to be\r\nuncivil.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve no objections to dancing with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey,\r\nbeginning to lose the sense that there was anything uncomfortable in\r\nthis arrangement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no objections,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, in a cold tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, you\xe2\x80\x99re a lucky fellow, Godfrey,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Kimble; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re my godson, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t stand in your way. Else I\xe2\x80\x99m not so very\r\nold, eh, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, skipping to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s side again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind my having a second after you were gone\xe2\x80\x94not if I cried a\r\ngood deal first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, take a cup o\xe2\x80\x99 tea and stop your tongue, do,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\ngood-humoured Mrs. Kimble, feeling some pride in a husband who must be\r\nregarded as so clever and amusing by the company generally. If he had\r\nonly not been irritable at cards!\r\n\r\nWhile safe, well-tested personalities were enlivening the tea in this\r\nway, the sound of the fiddle approaching within a distance at which it\r\ncould be heard distinctly, made the young people look at each other\r\nwith sympathetic impatience for the end of the meal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s Solomon in the hall,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, \xe2\x80\x9cand playing my\r\nfav\xe2\x80\x99rite tune, _I_ believe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe flaxen-headed ploughboy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s for\r\ngiving us a hint as we aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough in a hurry to hear him play. Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe called out to his third long-legged son, who was at the other end of\r\nthe room, \xe2\x80\x9copen the door, and tell Solomon to come in. He shall give us\r\na tune here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBob obeyed, and Solomon walked in, fiddling as he walked, for he would\r\non no account break off in the middle of a tune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Solomon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, with loud patronage. \xe2\x80\x9cRound here, my\r\nman. Ah, I knew it was \xe2\x80\x9cThe flaxen-headed ploughboy\xe2\x80\x9d: there\xe2\x80\x99s no finer\r\ntune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSolomon Macey, a small hale old man with an abundant crop of long white\r\nhair reaching nearly to his shoulders, advanced to the indicated spot,\r\nbowing reverently while he fiddled, as much as to say that he respected\r\nthe company, though he respected the key-note more. As soon as he had\r\nrepeated the tune and lowered his fiddle, he bowed again to the Squire\r\nand the rector, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I see your honour and your reverence\r\nwell, and wishing you health and long life and a happy New Year. And\r\nwishing the same to you, Mr. Lammeter, sir; and to the other gentlemen,\r\nand the madams, and the young lasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Solomon uttered the last words, he bowed in all directions\r\nsolicitously, lest he should be wanting in due respect. But thereupon\r\nhe immediately began to prelude, and fell into the tune which he knew\r\nwould be taken as a special compliment by Mr. Lammeter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank ye, Solomon, thank ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Lammeter when the fiddle paused\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOver the hills and far away\xe2\x80\x9d, that is. My father used\r\nto say to me, whenever we heard that tune, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, lad, _I_ come from over\r\nthe hills and far away.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s a many tunes I don\xe2\x80\x99t make head or tail\r\nof; but that speaks to me like the blackbird\xe2\x80\x99s whistle. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe name: there\xe2\x80\x99s a deal in the name of a tune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Solomon was already impatient to prelude again, and presently broke\r\nwith much spirit into \xe2\x80\x9cSir Roger de Coverley\xe2\x80\x9d, at which there was a\r\nsound of chairs pushed back, and laughing voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, Solomon, we know what that means,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, rising.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time to begin the dance, eh? Lead the way, then, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll all\r\nfollow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Solomon, holding his white head on one side, and playing vigorously,\r\nmarched forward at the head of the gay procession into the White\r\nParlour, where the mistletoe-bough was hung, and multitudinous tallow\r\ncandles made rather a brilliant effect, gleaming from among the berried\r\nholly-boughs, and reflected in the old-fashioned oval mirrors fastened\r\nin the panels of the white wainscot. A quaint procession! Old Solomon,\r\nin his seedy clothes and long white locks, seemed to be luring that\r\ndecent company by the magic scream of his fiddle\xe2\x80\x94luring discreet\r\nmatrons in turban-shaped caps, nay, Mrs. Crackenthorp herself, the\r\nsummit of whose perpendicular feather was on a level with the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder\xe2\x80\x94luring fair lasses complacently conscious of very short waists\r\nand skirts blameless of front-folds\xe2\x80\x94luring burly fathers in large\r\nvariegated waistcoats, and ruddy sons, for the most part shy and\r\nsheepish, in short nether garments and very long coat-tails.\r\n\r\nAlready Mr. Macey and a few other privileged villagers, who were\r\nallowed to be spectators on these great occasions, were seated on\r\nbenches placed for them near the door; and great was the admiration and\r\nsatisfaction in that quarter when the couples had formed themselves for\r\nthe dance, and the Squire led off with Mrs. Crackenthorp, joining hands\r\nwith the rector and Mrs. Osgood. That was as it should be\xe2\x80\x94that was what\r\neverybody had been used to\xe2\x80\x94and the charter of Raveloe seemed to be\r\nrenewed by the ceremony. It was not thought of as an unbecoming levity\r\nfor the old and middle-aged people to dance a little before sitting\r\ndown to cards, but rather as part of their social duties. For what were\r\nthese if not to be merry at appropriate times, interchanging visits and\r\npoultry with due frequency, paying each other old-established\r\ncompliments in sound traditional phrases, passing well-tried personal\r\njokes, urging your guests to eat and drink too much out of hospitality,\r\nand eating and drinking too much in your neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s house to show that\r\nyou liked your cheer? And the parson naturally set an example in these\r\nsocial duties. For it would not have been possible for the Raveloe\r\nmind, without a peculiar revelation, to know that a clergyman should be\r\na pale-faced memento of solemnities, instead of a reasonably faulty man\r\nwhose exclusive authority to read prayers and preach, to christen,\r\nmarry, and bury you, necessarily coexisted with the right to sell you\r\nthe ground to be buried in and to take tithe in kind; on which last\r\npoint, of course, there was a little grumbling, but not to the extent\r\nof irreligion\xe2\x80\x94not of deeper significance than the grumbling at the\r\nrain, which was by no means accompanied with a spirit of impious\r\ndefiance, but with a desire that the prayer for fine weather might be\r\nread forthwith.\r\n\r\nThere was no reason, then, why the rector\xe2\x80\x99s dancing should not be\r\nreceived as part of the fitness of things quite as much as the\r\nSquire\xe2\x80\x99s, or why, on the other hand, Mr. Macey\xe2\x80\x99s official respect\r\nshould restrain him from subjecting the parson\xe2\x80\x99s performance to that\r\ncriticism with which minds of extraordinary acuteness must necessarily\r\ncontemplate the doings of their fallible fellow-men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Squire\xe2\x80\x99s pretty springe, considering his weight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand he stamps uncommon well. But Mr. Lammeter beats \xe2\x80\x99em all for\r\nshapes: you see he holds his head like a sodger, and he isn\xe2\x80\x99t so\r\ncushiony as most o\xe2\x80\x99 the oldish gentlefolks\xe2\x80\x94they run fat in general; and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s got a fine leg. The parson\xe2\x80\x99s nimble enough, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got much\r\nof a leg: it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit too thick down\xe2\x80\x99ard, and his knees might be a bit\r\nnearer wi\xe2\x80\x99out damage; but he might do worse, he might do worse. Though\r\nhe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t that grand way o\xe2\x80\x99 waving his hand as the Squire has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk o\xe2\x80\x99 nimbleness, look at Mrs. Osgood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Winthrop, who was\r\nholding his son Aaron between his knees. \xe2\x80\x9cShe trips along with her\r\nlittle steps, so as nobody can see how she goes\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s like as if she had\r\nlittle wheels to her feet. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look a day older nor last year:\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s the finest-made woman as is, let the next be where she will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t heed how the women are made,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey, with some\r\ncontempt. \xe2\x80\x9cThey wear nayther coat nor breeches: you can\xe2\x80\x99t make much out\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 their shapes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFayder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aaron, whose feet were busy beating out the tune, \xe2\x80\x9chow\r\ndoes that big cock\xe2\x80\x99s-feather stick in Mrs. Crackenthorp\xe2\x80\x99s yead? Is\r\nthere a little hole for it, like in my shuttle-cock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, lad, hush; that\xe2\x80\x99s the way the ladies dress theirselves, that\r\nis,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father, adding, however, in an undertone to Mr. Macey,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does make her look funny, though\xe2\x80\x94partly like a short-necked bottle\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 a long quill in it. Hey, by jingo, there\xe2\x80\x99s the young Squire leading\r\noff now, wi\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Nancy for partners! There\xe2\x80\x99s a lass for you!\xe2\x80\x94like a\r\npink-and-white posy\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody \xe2\x80\x99ud think as anybody could be so\r\npritty. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if she\xe2\x80\x99s Madam Cass some day, arter all\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnobody more rightfuller, for they\xe2\x80\x99d make a fine match. You can find\r\nnothing against Master Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s shapes, Macey, _I_\xe2\x80\x99ll bet a penny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Macey screwed up his mouth, leaned his head further on one side,\r\nand twirled his thumbs with a presto movement as his eyes followed\r\nGodfrey up the dance. At last he summed up his opinion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well down\xe2\x80\x99ard, but a bit too round i\xe2\x80\x99 the shoulder-blades. And\r\nas for them coats as he gets from the Flitton tailor, they\xe2\x80\x99re a poor\r\ncut to pay double money for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mr. Macey, you and me are two folks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben, slightly indignant\r\nat this carping. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pot o\xe2\x80\x99 good ale, I like to swaller\r\nit, and do my inside good, i\xe2\x80\x99stead o\xe2\x80\x99 smelling and staring at it to see\r\nif I can\xe2\x80\x99t find faut wi\xe2\x80\x99 the brewing. I should like you to pick me out\r\na finer-limbed young fellow nor Master Godfrey\xe2\x80\x94one as \xe2\x80\x99ud knock you\r\ndown easier, or \xe2\x80\x99s more pleasanter-looksed when he\xe2\x80\x99s piert and merry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTchuh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey, provoked to increased severity, \xe2\x80\x9che isn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nto his right colour yet: he\xe2\x80\x99s partly like a slack-baked pie. And I\r\ndoubt he\xe2\x80\x99s got a soft place in his head, else why should he be turned\r\nround the finger by that offal Dunsey as nobody\xe2\x80\x99s seen o\xe2\x80\x99 late, and let\r\nhim kill that fine hunting hoss as was the talk o\xe2\x80\x99 the country? And one\r\nwhile he was allays after Miss Nancy, and then it all went off again,\r\nlike a smell o\xe2\x80\x99 hot porridge, as I may say. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my way when _I_\r\nwent a-coorting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but mayhap Miss Nancy hung off, like, and your lass didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say she didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macey, significantly. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9csniff\xe2\x80\x9d, I took care to know as she\xe2\x80\x99d say \xe2\x80\x9csnaff\xe2\x80\x9d, and pretty\r\nquick too. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to open _my_ mouth, like a dog at a fly,\r\nand snap it to again, wi\xe2\x80\x99 nothing to swaller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think Miss Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s a-coming round again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nMaster Godfrey doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look so down-hearted to-night. And I see he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfor taking her away to sit down, now they\xe2\x80\x99re at the end o\xe2\x80\x99 the dance:\r\nthat looks like sweethearting, that does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reason why Godfrey and Nancy had left the dance was not so tender\r\nas Ben imagined. In the close press of couples a slight accident had\r\nhappened to Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s dress, which, while it was short enough to show her\r\nneat ankle in front, was long enough behind to be caught under the\r\nstately stamp of the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s foot, so as to rend certain stitches at\r\nthe waist, and cause much sisterly agitation in Priscilla\xe2\x80\x99s mind, as\r\nwell as serious concern in Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s. One\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts may be much occupied\r\nwith love-struggles, but hardly so as to be insensible to a disorder in\r\nthe general framework of things. Nancy had no sooner completed her duty\r\nin the figure they were dancing than she said to Godfrey, with a deep\r\nblush, that she must go and sit down till Priscilla could come to her;\r\nfor the sisters had already exchanged a short whisper and an open-eyed\r\nglance full of meaning. No reason less urgent than this could have\r\nprevailed on Nancy to give Godfrey this opportunity of sitting apart\r\nwith her. As for Godfrey, he was feeling so happy and oblivious under\r\nthe long charm of the country-dance with Nancy, that he got rather bold\r\non the strength of her confusion, and was capable of leading her\r\nstraight away, without leave asked, into the adjoining small parlour,\r\nwhere the card-tables were set.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, coldly, as soon as she perceived where\r\nhe was going, \xe2\x80\x9cnot in there. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait here till Priscilla\xe2\x80\x99s ready to\r\ncome to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to bring you out of the dance and make myself\r\ntroublesome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be more comfortable here by yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the artful\r\nGodfrey: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you here till your sister can come.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke in\r\nan indifferent tone.\r\n\r\nThat was an agreeable proposition, and just what Nancy desired; why,\r\nthen, was she a little hurt that Mr. Godfrey should make it? They\r\nentered, and she seated herself on a chair against one of the\r\ncard-tables, as the stiffest and most unapproachable position she could\r\nchoose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said immediately. \xe2\x80\x9cI needn\xe2\x80\x99t give you any more\r\ntrouble. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you\xe2\x80\x99ve had such an unlucky partner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very ill-natured of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, standing by her without\r\nany sign of intended departure, \xe2\x80\x9cto be sorry you\xe2\x80\x99ve danced with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, sir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say what\xe2\x80\x99s ill-natured at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNancy, looking distractingly prim and pretty. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen gentlemen have so\r\nmany pleasures, one dance can matter but very little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. You know one dance with you matters more to\r\nme than all the other pleasures in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a long, long while since Godfrey had said anything so direct as\r\nthat, and Nancy was startled. But her instinctive dignity and\r\nrepugnance to any show of emotion made her sit perfectly still, and\r\nonly throw a little more decision into her voice, as she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, Mr. Godfrey, that\xe2\x80\x99s not known to me, and I have very good\r\nreasons for thinking different. But if it\xe2\x80\x99s true, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to hear\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you never forgive me, then, Nancy\xe2\x80\x94never think well of me, let\r\nwhat would happen\xe2\x80\x94would you never think the present made amends for the\r\npast? Not if I turned a good fellow, and gave up everything you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey was half conscious that this sudden opportunity of speaking to\r\nNancy alone had driven him beside himself; but blind feeling had got\r\nthe mastery of his tongue. Nancy really felt much agitated by the\r\npossibility Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s words suggested, but this very pressure of\r\nemotion that she was in danger of finding too strong for her roused all\r\nher power of self-command.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be glad to see a good change in anybody, Mr. Godfrey,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered, with the slightest discernible difference of tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ud be better if no change was wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very hard-hearted, Nancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, pettishly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might\r\nencourage me to be a better fellow. I\xe2\x80\x99m very miserable\xe2\x80\x94but you\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nfeeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think those have the least feeling that act wrong to begin with,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Nancy, sending out a flash in spite of herself. Godfrey was\r\ndelighted with that little flash, and would have liked to go on and\r\nmake her quarrel with him; Nancy was so exasperatingly quiet and firm.\r\nBut she was not indifferent to him _yet_, though\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe entrance of Priscilla, bustling forward and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cDear heart\r\nalive, child, let us look at this gown,\xe2\x80\x9d cut off Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of a\r\nquarrel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I must go now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Priscilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no matter to me whether you go or stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said that frank lady,\r\nsearching for something in her pocket, with a preoccupied brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo _you_ want me to go?\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, looking at Nancy, who was now\r\nstanding up by Priscilla\xe2\x80\x99s order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, trying to recover all her former coldness,\r\nand looking down carefully at the hem of her gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I like to stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, with a reckless determination to\r\nget as much of this joy as he could to-night, and think nothing of the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nWhile Godfrey Cass was taking draughts of forgetfulness from the sweet\r\npresence of Nancy, willingly losing all sense of that hidden bond which\r\nat other moments galled and fretted him so as to mingle irritation with\r\nthe very sunshine, Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s wife was walking with slow uncertain steps\r\nthrough the snow-covered Raveloe lanes, carrying her child in her arms.\r\n\r\nThis journey on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve was a premeditated act of vengeance\r\nwhich she had kept in her heart ever since Godfrey, in a fit of\r\npassion, had told her he would sooner die than acknowledge her as his\r\nwife. There would be a great party at the Red House on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve,\r\nshe knew: her husband would be smiling and smiled upon, hiding _her_\r\nexistence in the darkest corner of his heart. But she would mar his\r\npleasure: she would go in her dingy rags, with her faded face, once as\r\nhandsome as the best, with her little child that had its father\xe2\x80\x99s hair\r\nand eyes, and disclose herself to the Squire as his eldest son\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\nIt is seldom that the miserable can help regarding their misery as a\r\nwrong inflicted by those who are less miserable. Molly knew that the\r\ncause of her dingy rags was not her husband\xe2\x80\x99s neglect, but the demon\r\nOpium to whom she was enslaved, body and soul, except in the lingering\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s tenderness that refused to give him her hungry child. She knew\r\nthis well; and yet, in the moments of wretched unbenumbed\r\nconsciousness, the sense of her want and degradation transformed itself\r\ncontinually into bitterness towards Godfrey. _He_ was well off; and if\r\nshe had her rights she would be well off too. The belief that he\r\nrepented his marriage, and suffered from it, only aggravated her\r\nvindictiveness. Just and self-reproving thoughts do not come to us too\r\nthickly, even in the purest air, and with the best lessons of heaven\r\nand earth; how should those white-winged delicate messengers make their\r\nway to Molly\xe2\x80\x99s poisoned chamber, inhabited by no higher memories than\r\nthose of a barmaid\xe2\x80\x99s paradise of pink ribbons and gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s jokes?\r\n\r\nShe had set out at an early hour, but had lingered on the road,\r\ninclined by her indolence to believe that if she waited under a warm\r\nshed the snow would cease to fall. She had waited longer than she knew,\r\nand now that she found herself belated in the snow-hidden ruggedness of\r\nthe long lanes, even the animation of a vindictive purpose could not\r\nkeep her spirit from failing. It was seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and by this time\r\nshe was not very far from Raveloe, but she was not familiar enough with\r\nthose monotonous lanes to know how near she was to her journey\xe2\x80\x99s end.\r\nShe needed comfort, and she knew but one comforter\xe2\x80\x94the familiar demon\r\nin her bosom; but she hesitated a moment, after drawing out the black\r\nremnant, before she raised it to her lips. In that moment the mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlove pleaded for painful consciousness rather than oblivion\xe2\x80\x94pleaded to\r\nbe left in aching weariness, rather than to have the encircling arms\r\nbenumbed so that they could not feel the dear burden. In another moment\r\nMolly had flung something away, but it was not the black remnant\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nan empty phial. And she walked on again under the breaking cloud, from\r\nwhich there came now and then the light of a quickly veiled star, for a\r\nfreezing wind had sprung up since the snowing had ceased. But she\r\nwalked always more and more drowsily, and clutched more and more\r\nautomatically the sleeping child at her bosom.\r\n\r\nSlowly the demon was working his will, and cold and weariness were his\r\nhelpers. Soon she felt nothing but a supreme immediate longing that\r\ncurtained off all futurity\xe2\x80\x94the longing to lie down and sleep. She had\r\narrived at a spot where her footsteps were no longer checked by a\r\nhedgerow, and she had wandered vaguely, unable to distinguish any\r\nobjects, notwithstanding the wide whiteness around her, and the growing\r\nstarlight. She sank down against a straggling furze bush, an easy\r\npillow enough; and the bed of snow, too, was soft. She did not feel\r\nthat the bed was cold, and did not heed whether the child would wake\r\nand cry for her. But her arms had not yet relaxed their instinctive\r\nclutch; and the little one slumbered on as gently as if it had been\r\nrocked in a lace-trimmed cradle.\r\n\r\nBut the complete torpor came at last: the fingers lost their tension,\r\nthe arms unbent; then the little head fell away from the bosom, and the\r\nblue eyes opened wide on the cold starlight. At first there was a\r\nlittle peevish cry of \xe2\x80\x9cmammy\xe2\x80\x9d, and an effort to regain the pillowing\r\narm and bosom; but mammy\xe2\x80\x99s ear was deaf, and the pillow seemed to be\r\nslipping away backward. Suddenly, as the child rolled downward on its\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s knees, all wet with snow, its eyes were caught by a bright\r\nglancing light on the white ground, and, with the ready transition of\r\ninfancy, it was immediately absorbed in watching the bright living\r\nthing running towards it, yet never arriving. That bright living thing\r\nmust be caught; and in an instant the child had slipped on all-fours,\r\nand held out one little hand to catch the gleam. But the gleam would\r\nnot be caught in that way, and now the head was held up to see where\r\nthe cunning gleam came from. It came from a very bright place; and the\r\nlittle one, rising on its legs, toddled through the snow, the old grimy\r\nshawl in which it was wrapped trailing behind it, and the queer little\r\nbonnet dangling at its back\xe2\x80\x94toddled on to the open door of Silas\r\nMarner\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, and right up to the warm hearth, where there was a\r\nbright fire of logs and sticks, which had thoroughly warmed the old\r\nsack (Silas\xe2\x80\x99s greatcoat) spread out on the bricks to dry. The little\r\none, accustomed to be left to itself for long hours without notice from\r\nits mother, squatted down on the sack, and spread its tiny hands\r\ntowards the blaze, in perfect contentment, gurgling and making many\r\ninarticulate communications to the cheerful fire, like a new-hatched\r\ngosling beginning to find itself comfortable. But presently the warmth\r\nhad a lulling effect, and the little golden head sank down on the old\r\nsack, and the blue eyes were veiled by their delicate half-transparent\r\nlids.\r\n\r\nBut where was Silas Marner while this strange visitor had come to his\r\nhearth? He was in the cottage, but he did not see the child. During the\r\nlast few weeks, since he had lost his money, he had contracted the\r\nhabit of opening his door and looking out from time to time, as if he\r\nthought that his money might be somehow coming back to him, or that\r\nsome trace, some news of it, might be mysteriously on the road, and be\r\ncaught by the listening ear or the straining eye. It was chiefly at\r\nnight, when he was not occupied in his loom, that he fell into this\r\nrepetition of an act for which he could have assigned no definite\r\npurpose, and which can hardly be understood except by those who have\r\nundergone a bewildering separation from a supremely loved object. In\r\nthe evening twilight, and later whenever the night was not dark, Silas\r\nlooked out on that narrow prospect round the Stone-pits, listening and\r\ngazing, not with hope, but with mere yearning and unrest.\r\n\r\nThis morning he had been told by some of his neighbours that it was New\r\nYear\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, and that he must sit up and hear the old year rung out and\r\nthe new rung in, because that was good luck, and might bring his money\r\nback again. This was only a friendly Raveloe-way of jesting with the\r\nhalf-crazy oddities of a miser, but it had perhaps helped to throw\r\nSilas into a more than usually excited state. Since the on-coming of\r\ntwilight he had opened his door again and again, though only to shut it\r\nimmediately at seeing all distance veiled by the falling snow. But the\r\nlast time he opened it the snow had ceased, and the clouds were parting\r\nhere and there. He stood and listened, and gazed for a long while\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwas really something on the road coming towards him then, but he caught\r\nno sign of it; and the stillness and the wide trackless snow seemed to\r\nnarrow his solitude, and touched his yearning with the chill of\r\ndespair. He went in again, and put his right hand on the latch of the\r\ndoor to close it\xe2\x80\x94but he did not close it: he was arrested, as he had\r\nbeen already since his loss, by the invisible wand of catalepsy, and\r\nstood like a graven image, with wide but sightless eyes, holding open\r\nhis door, powerless to resist either the good or the evil that might\r\nenter there.\r\n\r\nWhen Marner\xe2\x80\x99s sensibility returned, he continued the action which had\r\nbeen arrested, and closed his door, unaware of the chasm in his\r\nconsciousness, unaware of any intermediate change, except that the\r\nlight had grown dim, and that he was chilled and faint. He thought he\r\nhad been too long standing at the door and looking out. Turning towards\r\nthe hearth, where the two logs had fallen apart, and sent forth only a\r\nred uncertain glimmer, he seated himself on his fireside chair, and was\r\nstooping to push his logs together, when, to his blurred vision, it\r\nseemed as if there were gold on the floor in front of the hearth.\r\nGold!\xe2\x80\x94his own gold\xe2\x80\x94brought back to him as mysteriously as it had been\r\ntaken away! He felt his heart begin to beat violently, and for a few\r\nmoments he was unable to stretch out his hand and grasp the restored\r\ntreasure. The heap of gold seemed to glow and get larger beneath his\r\nagitated gaze. He leaned forward at last, and stretched forth his hand;\r\nbut instead of the hard coin with the familiar resisting outline, his\r\nfingers encountered soft warm curls. In utter amazement, Silas fell on\r\nhis knees and bent his head low to examine the marvel: it was a\r\nsleeping child\xe2\x80\x94a round, fair thing, with soft yellow rings all over its\r\nhead. Could this be his little sister come back to him in a dream\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nlittle sister whom he had carried about in his arms for a year before\r\nshe died, when he was a small boy without shoes or stockings? That was\r\nthe first thought that darted across Silas\xe2\x80\x99s blank wonderment. _Was_ it\r\na dream? He rose to his feet again, pushed his logs together, and,\r\nthrowing on some dried leaves and sticks, raised a flame; but the flame\r\ndid not disperse the vision\xe2\x80\x94it only lit up more distinctly the little\r\nround form of the child, and its shabby clothing. It was very much like\r\nhis little sister. Silas sank into his chair powerless, under the\r\ndouble presence of an inexplicable surprise and a hurrying influx of\r\nmemories. How and when had the child come in without his knowledge? He\r\nhad never been beyond the door. But along with that question, and\r\nalmost thrusting it away, there was a vision of the old home and the\r\nold streets leading to Lantern Yard\xe2\x80\x94and within that vision another, of\r\nthe thoughts which had been present with him in those far-off scenes.\r\nThe thoughts were strange to him now, like old friendships impossible\r\nto revive; and yet he had a dreamy feeling that this child was somehow\r\na message come to him from that far-off life: it stirred fibres that\r\nhad never been moved in Raveloe\xe2\x80\x94old quiverings of tenderness\xe2\x80\x94old\r\nimpressions of awe at the presentiment of some Power presiding over his\r\nlife; for his imagination had not yet extricated itself from the sense\r\nof mystery in the child\xe2\x80\x99s sudden presence, and had formed no\r\nconjectures of ordinary natural means by which the event could have\r\nbeen brought about.\r\n\r\nBut there was a cry on the hearth: the child had awaked, and Marner\r\nstooped to lift it on his knee. It clung round his neck, and burst\r\nlouder and louder into that mingling of inarticulate cries with \xe2\x80\x9cmammy\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nby which little children express the bewilderment of waking. Silas\r\npressed it to him, and almost unconsciously uttered sounds of hushing\r\ntenderness, while he bethought himself that some of his porridge, which\r\nhad got cool by the dying fire, would do to feed the child with if it\r\nwere only warmed up a little.\r\n\r\nHe had plenty to do through the next hour. The porridge, sweetened with\r\nsome dry brown sugar from an old store which he had refrained from\r\nusing for himself, stopped the cries of the little one, and made her\r\nlift her blue eyes with a wide quiet gaze at Silas, as he put the spoon\r\ninto her mouth. Presently she slipped from his knee and began to toddle\r\nabout, but with a pretty stagger that made Silas jump up and follow her\r\nlest she should fall against anything that would hurt her. But she only\r\nfell in a sitting posture on the ground, and began to pull at her\r\nboots, looking up at him with a crying face as if the boots hurt her.\r\nHe took her on his knee again, but it was some time before it occurred\r\nto Silas\xe2\x80\x99s dull bachelor mind that the wet boots were the grievance,\r\npressing on her warm ankles. He got them off with difficulty, and baby\r\nwas at once happily occupied with the primary mystery of her own toes,\r\ninviting Silas, with much chuckling, to consider the mystery too. But\r\nthe wet boots had at last suggested to Silas that the child had been\r\nwalking on the snow, and this roused him from his entire oblivion of\r\nany ordinary means by which it could have entered or been brought into\r\nhis house. Under the prompting of this new idea, and without waiting to\r\nform conjectures, he raised the child in his arms, and went to the\r\ndoor. As soon as he had opened it, there was the cry of \xe2\x80\x9cmammy\xe2\x80\x9d again,\r\nwhich Silas had not heard since the child\xe2\x80\x99s first hungry waking.\r\nBending forward, he could just discern the marks made by the little\r\nfeet on the virgin snow, and he followed their track to the furze\r\nbushes. \xe2\x80\x9cMammy!\xe2\x80\x9d the little one cried again and again, stretching\r\nitself forward so as almost to escape from Silas\xe2\x80\x99s arms, before he\r\nhimself was aware that there was something more than the bush before\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94that there was a human body, with the head sunk low in the furze,\r\nand half-covered with the shaken snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nIt was after the early supper-time at the Red House, and the\r\nentertainment was in that stage when bashfulness itself had passed into\r\neasy jollity, when gentlemen, conscious of unusual accomplishments,\r\ncould at length be prevailed on to dance a hornpipe, and when the\r\nSquire preferred talking loudly, scattering snuff, and patting his\r\nvisitors\xe2\x80\x99 backs, to sitting longer at the whist-table\xe2\x80\x94a choice\r\nexasperating to uncle Kimble, who, being always volatile in sober\r\nbusiness hours, became intense and bitter over cards and brandy,\r\nshuffled before his adversary\xe2\x80\x99s deal with a glare of suspicion, and\r\nturned up a mean trump-card with an air of inexpressible disgust, as if\r\nin a world where such things could happen one might as well enter on a\r\ncourse of reckless profligacy. When the evening had advanced to this\r\npitch of freedom and enjoyment, it was usual for the servants, the\r\nheavy duties of supper being well over, to get their share of amusement\r\nby coming to look on at the dancing; so that the back regions of the\r\nhouse were left in solitude.\r\n\r\nThere were two doors by which the White Parlour was entered from the\r\nhall, and they were both standing open for the sake of air; but the\r\nlower one was crowded with the servants and villagers, and only the\r\nupper doorway was left free. Bob Cass was figuring in a hornpipe, and\r\nhis father, very proud of this lithe son, whom he repeatedly declared\r\nto be just like himself in his young days in a tone that implied this\r\nto be the very highest stamp of juvenile merit, was the centre of a\r\ngroup who had placed themselves opposite the performer, not far from\r\nthe upper door. Godfrey was standing a little way off, not to admire\r\nhis brother\xe2\x80\x99s dancing, but to keep sight of Nancy, who was seated in\r\nthe group, near her father. He stood aloof, because he wished to avoid\r\nsuggesting himself as a subject for the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s fatherly jokes in\r\nconnection with matrimony and Miss Nancy Lammeter\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, which were\r\nlikely to become more and more explicit. But he had the prospect of\r\ndancing with her again when the hornpipe was concluded, and in the\r\nmeanwhile it was very pleasant to get long glances at her quite\r\nunobserved.\r\n\r\nBut when Godfrey was lifting his eyes from one of those long glances,\r\nthey encountered an object as startling to him at that moment as if it\r\nhad been an apparition from the dead. It _was_ an apparition from that\r\nhidden life which lies, like a dark by-street, behind the goodly\r\nornamented facade that meets the sunlight and the gaze of respectable\r\nadmirers. It was his own child, carried in Silas Marner\xe2\x80\x99s arms. That\r\nwas his instantaneous impression, unaccompanied by doubt, though he had\r\nnot seen the child for months past; and when the hope was rising that\r\nhe might possibly be mistaken, Mr. Crackenthorp and Mr. Lammeter had\r\nalready advanced to Silas, in astonishment at this strange advent.\r\nGodfrey joined them immediately, unable to rest without hearing every\r\nword\xe2\x80\x94trying to control himself, but conscious that if any one noticed\r\nhim, they must see that he was white-lipped and trembling.\r\n\r\nBut now all eyes at that end of the room were bent on Silas Marner; the\r\nSquire himself had risen, and asked angrily, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x94what do you do coming in here in this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m come for the doctor\xe2\x80\x94I want the doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d Silas had said, in the\r\nfirst moment, to Mr. Crackenthorp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Marner?\xe2\x80\x9d said the rector. \xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s here;\r\nbut say quietly what you want him for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, speaking low, and half-breathlessly, just\r\nas Godfrey came up. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s dead, I think\xe2\x80\x94dead in the snow at the\r\nStone-pits\xe2\x80\x94not far from my door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey felt a great throb: there was one terror in his mind at that\r\nmoment: it was, that the woman might _not_ be dead. That was an evil\r\nterror\xe2\x80\x94an ugly inmate to have found a nestling-place in Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkindly disposition; but no disposition is a security from evil wishes\r\nto a man whose happiness hangs on duplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Crackenthorp. \xe2\x80\x9cGo out into the hall there. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfetch the doctor to you. Found a woman in the snow\xe2\x80\x94and thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndead,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, speaking low to the Squire. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter say as little\r\nabout it as possible: it will shock the ladies. Just tell them a poor\r\nwoman is ill from cold and hunger. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and fetch Kimble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, the ladies had pressed forward, curious to know\r\nwhat could have brought the solitary linen-weaver there under such\r\nstrange circumstances, and interested in the pretty child, who, half\r\nalarmed and half attracted by the brightness and the numerous company,\r\nnow frowned and hid her face, now lifted up her head again and looked\r\nround placably, until a touch or a coaxing word brought back the frown,\r\nand made her bury her face with new determination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat child is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said several ladies at once, and, among the rest,\r\nNancy Lammeter, addressing Godfrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94some poor woman\xe2\x80\x99s who has been found in the snow, I\r\nbelieve,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer Godfrey wrung from himself with a terrible\r\neffort. (\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, _am_ I certain?\xe2\x80\x9d he hastened to add, silently, in\r\nanticipation of his own conscience.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99d better leave the child here, then, Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\ngood-natured Mrs. Kimble, hesitating, however, to take those dingy\r\nclothes into contact with her own ornamented satin bodice. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\none o\xe2\x80\x99 the girls to fetch it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t part with it, I can\xe2\x80\x99t let it go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, abruptly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s come to me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to keep it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proposition to take the child from him had come to Silas quite\r\nunexpectedly, and his speech, uttered under a strong sudden impulse,\r\nwas almost like a revelation to himself: a minute before, he had no\r\ndistinct intention about the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever hear the like?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Kimble, in mild surprise, to\r\nher neighbour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, ladies, I must trouble you to stand aside,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Kimble,\r\ncoming from the card-room, in some bitterness at the interruption, but\r\ndrilled by the long habit of his profession into obedience to\r\nunpleasant calls, even when he was hardly sober.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a nasty business turning out now, eh, Kimble?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone for your young fellow\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x99prentice, there\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhis name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight? aye\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking about might?\xe2\x80\x9d growled uncle\r\nKimble, hastening out with Marner, and followed by Mr. Crackenthorp and\r\nGodfrey. \xe2\x80\x9cGet me a pair of thick boots, Godfrey, will you? And stay,\r\nlet somebody run to Winthrop\xe2\x80\x99s and fetch Dolly\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s the best woman to\r\nget. Ben was here himself before supper; is he gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, I met him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marner; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop to tell him\r\nanything, only I said I was going for the doctor, and he said the\r\ndoctor was at the Squire\xe2\x80\x99s. And I made haste and ran, and there was\r\nnobody to be seen at the back o\xe2\x80\x99 the house, and so I went in to where\r\nthe company was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child, no longer distracted by the bright light and the smiling\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s faces, began to cry and call for \xe2\x80\x9cmammy\xe2\x80\x9d, though always\r\nclinging to Marner, who had apparently won her thorough confidence.\r\nGodfrey had come back with the boots, and felt the cry as if some fibre\r\nwere drawn tight within him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, hastily, eager for some movement; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and\r\nfetch the woman\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Winthrop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, pooh\xe2\x80\x94send somebody else,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Kimble, hurrying away with\r\nMarner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll let me know if I can be of any use, Kimble,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nCrackenthorp. But the doctor was out of hearing.\r\n\r\nGodfrey, too, had disappeared: he was gone to snatch his hat and coat,\r\nhaving just reflection enough to remember that he must not look like a\r\nmadman; but he rushed out of the house into the snow without heeding\r\nhis thin shoes.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes he was on his rapid way to the Stone-pits by the side\r\nof Dolly, who, though feeling that she was entirely in her place in\r\nencountering cold and snow on an errand of mercy, was much concerned at\r\na young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s getting his feet wet under a like impulse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d a deal better go back, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, with respectful\r\ncompassion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve no call to catch cold; and I\xe2\x80\x99d ask you if you\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nso good as tell my husband to come, on your way back\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s at the\r\nRainbow, I doubt\xe2\x80\x94if you found him anyway sober enough to be o\xe2\x80\x99 use. Or\r\nelse, there\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Snell \xe2\x80\x99ud happen send the boy up to fetch and carry,\r\nfor there may be things wanted from the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay, now I\xe2\x80\x99m once out\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay outside here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey,\r\nwhen they came opposite Marner\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can come and tell me if\r\nI can do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, you\xe2\x80\x99re very good: you\xe2\x80\x99ve a tender heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, going\r\nto the door.\r\n\r\nGodfrey was too painfully preoccupied to feel a twinge of self-reproach\r\nat this undeserved praise. He walked up and down, unconscious that he\r\nwas plunging ankle-deep in snow, unconscious of everything but\r\ntrembling suspense about what was going on in the cottage, and the\r\neffect of each alternative on his future lot. No, not quite unconscious\r\nof everything else. Deeper down, and half-smothered by passionate\r\ndesire and dread, there was the sense that he ought not to be waiting\r\non these alternatives; that he ought to accept the consequences of his\r\ndeeds, own the miserable wife, and fulfil the claims of the helpless\r\nchild. But he had not moral courage enough to contemplate that active\r\nrenunciation of Nancy as possible for him: he had only conscience and\r\nheart enough to make him for ever uneasy under the weakness that\r\nforbade the renunciation. And at this moment his mind leaped away from\r\nall restraint toward the sudden prospect of deliverance from his long\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she dead?\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice that predominated over every other within\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she is, I may marry Nancy; and then I shall be a good fellow\r\nin future, and have no secrets, and the child\xe2\x80\x94shall be taken care of\r\nsomehow.\xe2\x80\x9d But across that vision came the other possibility\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cShe may\r\nlive, and then it\xe2\x80\x99s all up with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey never knew how long it was before the door of the cottage\r\nopened and Mr. Kimble came out. He went forward to meet his uncle,\r\nprepared to suppress the agitation he must feel, whatever news he was\r\nto hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waited for you, as I\xe2\x80\x99d come so far,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, speaking first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, it was nonsense for you to come out: why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you send one of\r\nthe men? There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be done. She\xe2\x80\x99s dead\xe2\x80\x94has been dead for\r\nhours, I should say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of woman is she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, feeling the blood rush to\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young woman, but emaciated, with long black hair. Some vagrant\xe2\x80\x94quite\r\nin rags. She\xe2\x80\x99s got a wedding-ring on, however. They must fetch her away\r\nto the workhouse to-morrow. Come, come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to look at her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I saw such a woman\r\nyesterday. I\xe2\x80\x99ll overtake you in a minute or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Kimble went on, and Godfrey turned back to the cottage. He cast\r\nonly one glance at the dead face on the pillow, which Dolly had\r\nsmoothed with decent care; but he remembered that last look at his\r\nunhappy hated wife so well, that at the end of sixteen years every line\r\nin the worn face was present to him when he told the full story of this\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nHe turned immediately towards the hearth, where Silas Marner sat\r\nlulling the child. She was perfectly quiet now, but not asleep\xe2\x80\x94only\r\nsoothed by sweet porridge and warmth into that wide-gazing calm which\r\nmakes us older human beings, with our inward turmoil, feel a certain\r\nawe in the presence of a little child, such as we feel before some\r\nquiet majesty or beauty in the earth or sky\xe2\x80\x94before a steady glowing\r\nplanet, or a full-flowered eglantine, or the bending trees over a\r\nsilent pathway. The wide-open blue eyes looked up at Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s without\r\nany uneasiness or sign of recognition: the child could make no visible\r\naudible claim on its father; and the father felt a strange mixture of\r\nfeelings, a conflict of regret and joy, that the pulse of that little\r\nheart had no response for the half-jealous yearning in his own, when\r\nthe blue eyes turned away from him slowly, and fixed themselves on the\r\nweaver\xe2\x80\x99s queer face, which was bent low down to look at them, while the\r\nsmall hand began to pull Marner\xe2\x80\x99s withered cheek with loving\r\ndisfiguration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll take the child to the parish to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Godfrey,\r\nspeaking as indifferently as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho says so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marner, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cWill they make me take her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to keep her, should you\xe2\x80\x94an old bachelor like\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill anybody shows they\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to take her away from me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarner. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mother\xe2\x80\x99s dead, and I reckon it\xe2\x80\x99s got no father: it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlone thing\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m a lone thing. My money\xe2\x80\x99s gone, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhere\xe2\x80\x94and this is come from I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where. I know nothing\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\npartly mazed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me give something towards\r\nfinding it clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had put his hand in his pocket and found half-a-guinea, and,\r\nthrusting it into Silas\xe2\x80\x99s hand, he hurried out of the cottage to\r\novertake Mr. Kimble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same woman I saw,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he came up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty little child: the old fellow seems to want to keep it;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s strange for a miser like him. But I gave him a trifle to help\r\nhim out: the parish isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to quarrel with him for the right to\r\nkeep the child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the time when I might have quarrelled with him for\r\nit myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s too late now, though. If the child ran into the fire,\r\nyour aunt\xe2\x80\x99s too fat to overtake it: she could only sit and grunt like\r\nan alarmed sow. But what a fool you are, Godfrey, to come out in your\r\ndancing shoes and stockings in this way\xe2\x80\x94and you one of the beaux of the\r\nevening, and at your own house! What do you mean by such freaks, young\r\nfellow? Has Miss Nancy been cruel, and do you want to spite her by\r\nspoiling your pumps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, everything has been disagreeable to-night. I was tired to death of\r\njigging and gallanting, and that bother about the hornpipes. And I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngot to dance with the other Miss Gunn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, glad of the\r\nsubterfuge his uncle had suggested to him.\r\n\r\nThe prevarication and white lies which a mind that keeps itself\r\nambitiously pure is as uneasy under as a great artist under the false\r\ntouches that no eye detects but his own, are worn as lightly as mere\r\ntrimmings when once the actions have become a lie.\r\n\r\nGodfrey reappeared in the White Parlour with dry feet, and, since the\r\ntruth must be told, with a sense of relief and gladness that was too\r\nstrong for painful thoughts to struggle with. For could he not venture\r\nnow, whenever opportunity offered, to say the tenderest things to Nancy\r\nLammeter\xe2\x80\x94to promise her and himself that he would always be just what\r\nshe would desire to see him? There was no danger that his dead wife\r\nwould be recognized: those were not days of active inquiry and wide\r\nreport; and as for the registry of their marriage, that was a long way\r\noff, buried in unturned pages, away from every one\xe2\x80\x99s interest but his\r\nown. Dunsey might betray him if he came back; but Dunsey might be won\r\nto silence.\r\n\r\nAnd when events turn out so much better for a man than he has had\r\nreason to dread, is it not a proof that his conduct has been less\r\nfoolish and blameworthy than it might otherwise have appeared? When we\r\nare treated well, we naturally begin to think that we are not\r\naltogether unmeritorious, and that it is only just we should treat\r\nourselves well, and not mar our own good fortune. Where, after all,\r\nwould be the use of his confessing the past to Nancy Lammeter, and\r\nthrowing away his happiness?\xe2\x80\x94nay, hers? for he felt some confidence\r\nthat she loved him. As for the child, he would see that it was cared\r\nfor: he would never forsake it; he would do everything but own it.\r\nPerhaps it would be just as happy in life without being owned by its\r\nfather, seeing that nobody could tell how things would turn out, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94is there any other reason wanted?\xe2\x80\x94well, then, that the father\r\nwould be much happier without owning the child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nThere was a pauper\xe2\x80\x99s burial that week in Raveloe, and up Kench Yard at\r\nBatherley it was known that the dark-haired woman with the fair child,\r\nwho had lately come to lodge there, was gone away again. That was all\r\nthe express note taken that Molly had disappeared from the eyes of men.\r\nBut the unwept death which, to the general lot, seemed as trivial as\r\nthe summer-shed leaf, was charged with the force of destiny to certain\r\nhuman lives that we know of, shaping their joys and sorrows even to the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nSilas Marner\xe2\x80\x99s determination to keep the \xe2\x80\x9ctramp\xe2\x80\x99s child\xe2\x80\x9d was matter of\r\nhardly less surprise and iterated talk in the village than the robbery\r\nof his money. That softening of feeling towards him which dated from\r\nhis misfortune, that merging of suspicion and dislike in a rather\r\ncontemptuous pity for him as lone and crazy, was now accompanied with a\r\nmore active sympathy, especially amongst the women. Notable mothers,\r\nwho knew what it was to keep children \xe2\x80\x9cwhole and sweet\xe2\x80\x9d; lazy mothers,\r\nwho knew what it was to be interrupted in folding their arms and\r\nscratching their elbows by the mischievous propensities of children\r\njust firm on their legs, were equally interested in conjecturing how a\r\nlone man would manage with a two-year-old child on his hands, and were\r\nequally ready with their suggestions: the notable chiefly telling him\r\nwhat he had better do, and the lazy ones being emphatic in telling him\r\nwhat he would never be able to do.\r\n\r\nAmong the notable mothers, Dolly Winthrop was the one whose neighbourly\r\noffices were the most acceptable to Marner, for they were rendered\r\nwithout any show of bustling instruction. Silas had shown her the\r\nhalf-guinea given to him by Godfrey, and had asked her what he should\r\ndo about getting some clothes for the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no call to buy, no more nor a\r\npair o\xe2\x80\x99 shoes; for I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the little petticoats as Aaron wore five\r\nyears ago, and it\xe2\x80\x99s ill spending the money on them baby-clothes, for\r\nthe child \xe2\x80\x99ull grow like grass i\xe2\x80\x99 May, bless it\xe2\x80\x94that it will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the same day Dolly brought her bundle, and displayed to Marner, one\r\nby one, the tiny garments in their due order of succession, most of\r\nthem patched and darned, but clean and neat as fresh-sprung herbs. This\r\nwas the introduction to a great ceremony with soap and water, from\r\nwhich Baby came out in new beauty, and sat on Dolly\xe2\x80\x99s knee, handling\r\nher toes and chuckling and patting her palms together with an air of\r\nhaving made several discoveries about herself, which she communicated\r\nby alternate sounds of \xe2\x80\x9cgug-gug-gug\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cmammy\xe2\x80\x9d. The \xe2\x80\x9cmammy\xe2\x80\x9d was not\r\na cry of need or uneasiness: Baby had been used to utter it without\r\nexpecting either tender sound or touch to follow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnybody \xe2\x80\x99ud think the angils in heaven couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be prettier,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDolly, rubbing the golden curls and kissing them. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think of its\r\nbeing covered wi\xe2\x80\x99 them dirty rags\xe2\x80\x94and the poor mother\xe2\x80\x94froze to death;\r\nbut there\xe2\x80\x99s Them as took care of it, and brought it to your door,\r\nMaster Marner. The door was open, and it walked in over the snow, like\r\nas if it had been a little starved robin. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say the door was\r\nopen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, meditatively. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94the door was open. The money\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where, and this is come from I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not mentioned to any one his unconsciousness of the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentrance, shrinking from questions which might lead to the fact he\r\nhimself suspected\xe2\x80\x94namely, that he had been in one of his trances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, with soothing gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s like the night and the\r\nmorning, and the sleeping and the waking, and the rain and the\r\nharvest\xe2\x80\x94one goes and the other comes, and we know nothing how nor\r\nwhere. We may strive and scrat and fend, but it\xe2\x80\x99s little we can do\r\narter all\xe2\x80\x94the big things come and go wi\xe2\x80\x99 no striving o\xe2\x80\x99 our\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x94they do,\r\nthat they do; and I think you\xe2\x80\x99re in the right on it to keep the little\r\nun, Master Marner, seeing as it\xe2\x80\x99s been sent to you, though there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfolks as thinks different. You\xe2\x80\x99ll happen be a bit moithered with it\r\nwhile it\xe2\x80\x99s so little; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll come, and welcome, and see to it for\r\nyou: I\xe2\x80\x99ve a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 time to spare most days, for when one gets up\r\nbetimes i\xe2\x80\x99 the morning, the clock seems to stan\xe2\x80\x99 still tow\xe2\x80\x99rt ten,\r\nafore it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go about the victual. So, as I say, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come and\r\nsee to the child for you, and welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you... kindly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, hesitating a little. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me things. But,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, uneasily, leaning forward to\r\nlook at Baby with some jealousy, as she was resting her head backward\r\nagainst Dolly\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and eyeing him contentedly from a distance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nwant to do things for it myself, else it may get fond o\xe2\x80\x99 somebody else,\r\nand not fond o\xe2\x80\x99 me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been used to fending for myself in the house\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncan learn, I can learn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen men as are wonderful\r\nhandy wi\xe2\x80\x99 children. The men are awk\xe2\x80\x99ard and contrairy mostly, God help\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94but when the drink\xe2\x80\x99s out of \xe2\x80\x99em, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t unsensible, though\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re bad for leeching and bandaging\xe2\x80\x94so fiery and unpatient. You see\r\nthis goes first, next the skin,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Dolly, taking up the little\r\nshirt, and putting it on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marner, docilely, bringing his eyes very close, that they\r\nmight be initiated in the mysteries; whereupon Baby seized his head\r\nwith both her small arms, and put her lips against his face with\r\npurring noises.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s tender tact, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s fondest o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou. She wants to go o\xe2\x80\x99 your lap, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound. Go, then: take her,\r\nMaster Marner; you can put the things on, and then you can say as\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve done for her from the first of her coming to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarner took her on his lap, trembling with an emotion mysterious to\r\nhimself, at something unknown dawning on his life. Thought and feeling\r\nwere so confused within him, that if he had tried to give them\r\nutterance, he could only have said that the child was come instead of\r\nthe gold\xe2\x80\x94that the gold had turned into the child. He took the garments\r\nfrom Dolly, and put them on under her teaching; interrupted, of course,\r\nby Baby\xe2\x80\x99s gymnastics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, then! why, you take to it quite easy, Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDolly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what shall you do when you\xe2\x80\x99re forced to sit in your loom?\r\nFor she\xe2\x80\x99ll get busier and mischievouser every day\xe2\x80\x94she will, bless her.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s lucky as you\xe2\x80\x99ve got that high hearth i\xe2\x80\x99stead of a grate, for that\r\nkeeps the fire more out of her reach: but if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got anything as can\r\nbe spilt or broke, or as is fit to cut her fingers off, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be at\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94and it is but right you should know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilas meditated a little while in some perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tie her to the\r\nleg o\xe2\x80\x99 the loom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctie her with a good long strip o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mayhap that\xe2\x80\x99ll do, as it\xe2\x80\x99s a little gell, for they\xe2\x80\x99re easier\r\npersuaded to sit i\xe2\x80\x99 one place nor the lads. I know what the lads are;\r\nfor I\xe2\x80\x99ve had four\xe2\x80\x94four I\xe2\x80\x99ve had, God knows\xe2\x80\x94and if you was to take and\r\ntie \xe2\x80\x99em up, they\xe2\x80\x99d make a fighting and a crying as if you was ringing\r\nthe pigs. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you my little chair, and some bits o\xe2\x80\x99 red rag\r\nand things for her to play wi\xe2\x80\x99; an\xe2\x80\x99 she\xe2\x80\x99ll sit and chatter to \xe2\x80\x99em as if\r\nthey was alive. Eh, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a sin to the lads to wish \xe2\x80\x99em made\r\ndifferent, bless \xe2\x80\x99em, I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been glad for one of \xe2\x80\x99em to be a\r\nlittle gell; and to think as I could ha\xe2\x80\x99 taught her to scour, and mend,\r\nand the knitting, and everything. But I can teach \xe2\x80\x99em this little un,\r\nMaster Marner, when she gets old enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99ll be _my_ little un,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marner, rather hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nnobody else\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, to be sure; you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a right to her, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a father to her,\r\nand bring her up according. But,\xe2\x80\x9d added Dolly, coming to a point which\r\nshe had determined beforehand to touch upon, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must bring her up\r\nlike christened folks\xe2\x80\x99s children, and take her to church, and let her\r\nlearn her catechise, as my little Aaron can say off\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cI believe\xe2\x80\x9d,\r\nand everything, and \xe2\x80\x9churt nobody by word or deed\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x94as well as if he was\r\nthe clerk. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you must do, Master Marner, if you\xe2\x80\x99d do the\r\nright thing by the orphin child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarner\xe2\x80\x99s pale face flushed suddenly under a new anxiety. His mind was\r\ntoo busy trying to give some definite bearing to Dolly\xe2\x80\x99s words for him\r\nto think of answering her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s my belief,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cas the poor little creatur has\r\nnever been christened, and it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but right as the parson should\r\nbe spoke to; and if you was noways unwilling, I\xe2\x80\x99d talk to Mr. Macey\r\nabout it this very day. For if the child ever went anyways wrong, and\r\nyou hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done your part by it, Master Marner\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99noculation, and\r\neverything to save it from harm\xe2\x80\x94it \xe2\x80\x99ud be a thorn i\xe2\x80\x99 your bed for ever\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 this side the grave; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t think as it \xe2\x80\x99ud be easy lying down\r\nfor anybody when they\xe2\x80\x99d got to another world, if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done their\r\npart by the helpless children as come wi\xe2\x80\x99out their own asking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDolly herself was disposed to be silent for some time now, for she had\r\nspoken from the depths of her own simple belief, and was much concerned\r\nto know whether her words would produce the desired effect on Silas. He\r\nwas puzzled and anxious, for Dolly\xe2\x80\x99s word \xe2\x80\x9cchristened\xe2\x80\x9d conveyed no\r\ndistinct meaning to him. He had only heard of baptism, and had only\r\nseen the baptism of grown-up men and women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it as you mean by \xe2\x80\x9cchristened\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, timidly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t folks be good to her without it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear! Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, with gentle distress and\r\ncompassion. \xe2\x80\x9cHad you never no father nor mother as taught you to say\r\nyour prayers, and as there\xe2\x80\x99s good words and good things to keep us from\r\nharm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, in a low voice; \xe2\x80\x9cI know a deal about that\xe2\x80\x94used to,\r\nused to. But your ways are different: my country was a good way off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe paused a few moments, and then added, more decidedly, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I want to\r\ndo everything as can be done for the child. And whatever\xe2\x80\x99s right for it\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 this country, and you think \xe2\x80\x99ull do it good, I\xe2\x80\x99ll act according, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, inwardly rejoiced, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask\r\nMr. Macey to speak to the parson about it; and you must fix on a name\r\nfor it, because it must have a name giv\xe2\x80\x99 it when it\xe2\x80\x99s christened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Hephzibah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, \xe2\x80\x9cand my little sister was\r\nnamed after her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a hard name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly. \xe2\x80\x9cI partly think it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nchristened name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a Bible name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, old ideas recurring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ve no call to speak again\xe2\x80\x99 it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, rather startled by\r\nSilas\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge on this head; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you see I\xe2\x80\x99m no scholard, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nslow at catching the words. My husband says I\xe2\x80\x99m allays like as if I was\r\nputting the haft for the handle\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what he says\xe2\x80\x94for he\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nsharp, God help him. But it was awk\xe2\x80\x99ard calling your little sister by\r\nsuch a hard name, when you\xe2\x80\x99d got nothing big to say, like\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nMaster Marner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe called her Eppie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if it was noways wrong to shorten the name, it \xe2\x80\x99ud be a deal\r\nhandier. And so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go now, Master Marner, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak about the\r\nchristening afore dark; and I wish you the best o\xe2\x80\x99 luck, and it\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nbelief as it\xe2\x80\x99ll come to you, if you do what\xe2\x80\x99s right by the orphin\r\nchild;\xe2\x80\x94and there\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x99noculation to be seen to; and as to washing its\r\nbits o\xe2\x80\x99 things, you need look to nobody but me, for I can do \xe2\x80\x99em wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\none hand when I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my suds about. Eh, the blessed angil! You\xe2\x80\x99ll let\r\nme bring my Aaron one o\xe2\x80\x99 these days, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll show her his little cart\r\nas his father\xe2\x80\x99s made for him, and the black-and-white pup as he\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\na-rearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBaby _was_ christened, the rector deciding that a double baptism was\r\nthe lesser risk to incur; and on this occasion Silas, making himself as\r\nclean and tidy as he could, appeared for the first time within the\r\nchurch, and shared in the observances held sacred by his neighbours. He\r\nwas quite unable, by means of anything he heard or saw, to identify the\r\nRaveloe religion with his old faith; if he could at any time in his\r\nprevious life have done so, it must have been by the aid of a strong\r\nfeeling ready to vibrate with sympathy, rather than by a comparison of\r\nphrases and ideas: and now for long years that feeling had been\r\ndormant. He had no distinct idea about the baptism and the\r\nchurch-going, except that Dolly had said it was for the good of the\r\nchild; and in this way, as the weeks grew to months, the child created\r\nfresh and fresh links between his life and the lives from which he had\r\nhitherto shrunk continually into narrower isolation. Unlike the gold\r\nwhich needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked\r\nsolitude\xe2\x80\x94which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song\r\nof birds, and started to no human tones\xe2\x80\x94Eppie was a creature of endless\r\nclaims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and\r\nliving sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with\r\ntrust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that\r\nlooked on her. The gold had kept his thoughts in an ever-repeated\r\ncircle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object\r\ncompacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and\r\ncarried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same\r\nblank limit\xe2\x80\x94carried them away to the new things that would come with\r\nthe coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her\r\nfather Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time\r\nin the ties and charities that bound together the families of his\r\nneighbours. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and\r\nlonger, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the\r\nmonotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called\r\nhim away from his weaving, and made him think all its pauses a holiday,\r\nreawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old\r\nwinter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and\r\nwarming him into joy because _she_ had joy.\r\n\r\nAnd when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups\r\nwere thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny midday, or\r\nin the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the\r\nhedgerows, strolling out with uncovered head to carry Eppie beyond the\r\nStone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favourite\r\nbank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers,\r\nand make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the\r\nbright petals, calling \xe2\x80\x9cDad-dad\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d attention continually by bringing\r\nhim the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note,\r\nand Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness,\r\nthat they might listen for the note to come again: so that when it\r\ncame, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph.\r\nSitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once\r\nfamiliar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline\r\nand markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of crowding\r\nremembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in\r\nEppie\xe2\x80\x99s little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit.\r\n\r\nAs the child\xe2\x80\x99s mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing\r\ninto memory: as her life unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold\r\nnarrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nIt was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the\r\ntones that stirred Silas\xe2\x80\x99s heart grew articulate, and called for more\r\ndistinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and\r\nears, and there was more that \xe2\x80\x9cDad-dad\xe2\x80\x9d was imperatively required to\r\nnotice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old,\r\nshe developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious\r\nways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for\r\nSilas\xe2\x80\x99s patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was\r\npoor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible demands of\r\nlove. Dolly Winthrop told him that punishment was good for Eppie, and\r\nthat, as for rearing a child without making it tingle a little in soft\r\nand safe places now and then, it was not to be done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, there\xe2\x80\x99s another thing you might do, Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nDolly, meditatively: \xe2\x80\x9cyou might shut her up once i\xe2\x80\x99 the coal-hole. That\r\nwas what I did wi\xe2\x80\x99 Aaron; for I was that silly wi\xe2\x80\x99 the youngest lad, as\r\nI could never bear to smack him. Not as I could find i\xe2\x80\x99 my heart to let\r\nhim stay i\xe2\x80\x99 the coal-hole more nor a minute, but it was enough to colly\r\nhim all over, so as he must be new washed and dressed, and it was as\r\ngood as a rod to him\xe2\x80\x94that was. But I put it upo\xe2\x80\x99 your conscience,\r\nMaster Marner, as there\xe2\x80\x99s one of \xe2\x80\x99em you must choose\xe2\x80\x94ayther smacking or\r\nthe coal-hole\xe2\x80\x94else she\xe2\x80\x99ll get so masterful, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no holding\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilas was impressed with the melancholy truth of this last remark; but\r\nhis force of mind failed before the only two penal methods open to him,\r\nnot only because it was painful to him to hurt Eppie, but because he\r\ntrembled at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s contention with her, lest she should love him\r\nthe less for it. Let even an affectionate Goliath get himself tied to a\r\nsmall tender thing, dreading to hurt it by pulling, and dreading still\r\nmore to snap the cord, and which of the two, pray, will be master? It\r\nwas clear that Eppie, with her short toddling steps, must lead father\r\nSilas a pretty dance on any fine morning when circumstances favoured\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\nFor example. He had wisely chosen a broad strip of linen as a means of\r\nfastening her to his loom when he was busy: it made a broad belt round\r\nher waist, and was long enough to allow of her reaching the truckle-bed\r\nand sitting down on it, but not long enough for her to attempt any\r\ndangerous climbing. One bright summer\xe2\x80\x99s morning Silas had been more\r\nengrossed than usual in \xe2\x80\x9csetting up\xe2\x80\x9d a new piece of work, an occasion\r\non which his scissors were in requisition. These scissors, owing to an\r\nespecial warning of Dolly\xe2\x80\x99s, had been kept carefully out of Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreach; but the click of them had had a peculiar attraction for her ear,\r\nand watching the results of that click, she had derived the philosophic\r\nlesson that the same cause would produce the same effect. Silas had\r\nseated himself in his loom, and the noise of weaving had begun; but he\r\nhad left his scissors on a ledge which Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s arm was long enough to\r\nreach; and now, like a small mouse, watching her opportunity, she stole\r\nquietly from her corner, secured the scissors, and toddled to the bed\r\nagain, setting up her back as a mode of concealing the fact. She had a\r\ndistinct intention as to the use of the scissors; and having cut the\r\nlinen strip in a jagged but effectual manner, in two moments she had\r\nrun out at the open door where the sunshine was inviting her, while\r\npoor Silas believed her to be a better child than usual. It was not\r\nuntil he happened to need his scissors that the terrible fact burst\r\nupon him: Eppie had run out by herself\xe2\x80\x94had perhaps fallen into the\r\nStone-pit. Silas, shaken by the worst fear that could have befallen\r\nhim, rushed out, calling \xe2\x80\x9cEppie!\xe2\x80\x9d and ran eagerly about the unenclosed\r\nspace, exploring the dry cavities into which she might have fallen, and\r\nthen gazing with questioning dread at the smooth red surface of the\r\nwater. The cold drops stood on his brow. How long had she been out?\r\nThere was one hope\xe2\x80\x94that she had crept through the stile and got into\r\nthe fields, where he habitually took her to stroll. But the grass was\r\nhigh in the meadow, and there was no descrying her, if she were there,\r\nexcept by a close search that would be a trespass on Mr. Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s crop.\r\nStill, that misdemeanour must be committed; and poor Silas, after\r\npeering all round the hedgerows, traversed the grass, beginning with\r\nperturbed vision to see Eppie behind every group of red sorrel, and to\r\nsee her moving always farther off as he approached. The meadow was\r\nsearched in vain; and he got over the stile into the next field,\r\nlooking with dying hope towards a small pond which was now reduced to\r\nits summer shallowness, so as to leave a wide margin of good adhesive\r\nmud. Here, however, sat Eppie, discoursing cheerfully to her own small\r\nboot, which she was using as a bucket to convey the water into a deep\r\nhoof-mark, while her little naked foot was planted comfortably on a\r\ncushion of olive-green mud. A red-headed calf was observing her with\r\nalarmed doubt through the opposite hedge.\r\n\r\nHere was clearly a case of aberration in a christened child which\r\ndemanded severe treatment; but Silas, overcome with convulsive joy at\r\nfinding his treasure again, could do nothing but snatch her up, and\r\ncover her with half-sobbing kisses. It was not until he had carried her\r\nhome, and had begun to think of the necessary washing, that he\r\nrecollected the need that he should punish Eppie, and \xe2\x80\x9cmake her\r\nremember\xe2\x80\x9d. The idea that she might run away again and come to harm,\r\ngave him unusual resolution, and for the first time he determined to\r\ntry the coal-hole\xe2\x80\x94a small closet near the hearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaughty, naughty Eppie,\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly began, holding her on his knee,\r\nand pointing to her muddy feet and clothes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnaughty to cut with the\r\nscissors and run away. Eppie must go into the coal-hole for being\r\nnaughty. Daddy must put her in the coal-hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe half-expected that this would be shock enough, and that Eppie would\r\nbegin to cry. But instead of that, she began to shake herself on his\r\nknee, as if the proposition opened a pleasing novelty. Seeing that he\r\nmust proceed to extremities, he put her into the coal-hole, and held\r\nthe door closed, with a trembling sense that he was using a strong\r\nmeasure. For a moment there was silence, but then came a little cry,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpy, opy!\xe2\x80\x9d and Silas let her out again, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNow Eppie \xe2\x80\x99ull never\r\nbe naughty again, else she must go in the coal-hole\xe2\x80\x94a black naughty\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe weaving must stand still a long while this morning, for now Eppie\r\nmust be washed, and have clean clothes on; but it was to be hoped that\r\nthis punishment would have a lasting effect, and save time in\r\nfuture\xe2\x80\x94though, perhaps, it would have been better if Eppie had cried\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour she was clean again, and Silas having turned his back\r\nto see what he could do with the linen band, threw it down again, with\r\nthe reflection that Eppie would be good without fastening for the rest\r\nof the morning. He turned round again, and was going to place her in\r\nher little chair near the loom, when she peeped out at him with black\r\nface and hands again, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cEppie in de toal-hole!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis total failure of the coal-hole discipline shook Silas\xe2\x80\x99s belief in\r\nthe efficacy of punishment. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d take it all for fun,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed to\r\nDolly, \xe2\x80\x9cif I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt her, and that I can\xe2\x80\x99t do, Mrs. Winthrop. If\r\nshe makes me a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble, I can bear it. And she\xe2\x80\x99s got no tricks\r\nbut what she\xe2\x80\x99ll grow out of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s partly true, Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, sympathetically;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand if you can\xe2\x80\x99t bring your mind to frighten her off touching things,\r\nyou must do what you can to keep \xe2\x80\x99em out of her way. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I do\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 the pups as the lads are allays a-rearing. They _will_ worry and\r\ngnaw\xe2\x80\x94worry and gnaw they will, if it was one\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday cap as hung\r\nanywhere so as they could drag it. They know no difference, God help\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em: it\xe2\x80\x99s the pushing o\xe2\x80\x99 the teeth as sets \xe2\x80\x99em on, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Eppie was reared without punishment, the burden of her misdeeds\r\nbeing borne vicariously by father Silas. The stone hut was made a soft\r\nnest for her, lined with downy patience: and also in the world that lay\r\nbeyond the stone hut she knew nothing of frowns and denials.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the difficulty of carrying her and his yarn or linen at\r\nthe same time, Silas took her with him in most of his journeys to the\r\nfarmhouses, unwilling to leave her behind at Dolly Winthrop\xe2\x80\x99s, who was\r\nalways ready to take care of her; and little curly-headed Eppie, the\r\nweaver\xe2\x80\x99s child, became an object of interest at several outlying\r\nhomesteads, as well as in the village. Hitherto he had been treated\r\nvery much as if he had been a useful gnome or brownie\xe2\x80\x94a queer and\r\nunaccountable creature, who must necessarily be looked at with\r\nwondering curiosity and repulsion, and with whom one would be glad to\r\nmake all greetings and bargains as brief as possible, but who must be\r\ndealt with in a propitiatory way, and occasionally have a present of\r\npork or garden stuff to carry home with him, seeing that without him\r\nthere was no getting the yarn woven. But now Silas met with open\r\nsmiling faces and cheerful questioning, as a person whose satisfactions\r\nand difficulties could be understood. Everywhere he must sit a little\r\nand talk about the child, and words of interest were always ready for\r\nhim: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Master Marner, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be lucky if she takes the measles soon\r\nand easy!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t many lone men \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 been wishing to\r\ntake up with a little un like that: but I reckon the weaving makes you\r\nhandier than men as do out-door work\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re partly as handy as a woman,\r\nfor weaving comes next to spinning.\xe2\x80\x9d Elderly masters and mistresses,\r\nseated observantly in large kitchen arm-chairs, shook their heads over\r\nthe difficulties attendant on rearing children, felt Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s round arms\r\nand legs, and pronounced them remarkably firm, and told Silas that, if\r\nshe turned out well (which, however, there was no telling), it would be\r\na fine thing for him to have a steady lass to do for him when he got\r\nhelpless. Servant maidens were fond of carrying her out to look at the\r\nhens and chickens, or to see if any cherries could be shaken down in\r\nthe orchard; and the small boys and girls approached her slowly, with\r\ncautious movement and steady gaze, like little dogs face to face with\r\none of their own kind, till attraction had reached the point at which\r\nthe soft lips were put out for a kiss. No child was afraid of\r\napproaching Silas when Eppie was near him: there was no repulsion\r\naround him now, either for young or old; for the little child had come\r\nto link him once more with the whole world. There was love between him\r\nand the child that blent them into one, and there was love between the\r\nchild and the world\xe2\x80\x94from men and women with parental looks and tones,\r\nto the red lady-birds and the round pebbles.\r\n\r\nSilas began now to think of Raveloe life entirely in relation to Eppie:\r\nshe must have everything that was a good in Raveloe; and he listened\r\ndocilely, that he might come to understand better what this life was,\r\nfrom which, for fifteen years, he had stood aloof as from a strange\r\nthing, with which he could have no communion: as some man who has a\r\nprecious plant to which he would give a nurturing home in a new soil,\r\nthinks of the rain, and the sunshine, and all influences, in relation\r\nto his nursling, and asks industriously for all knowledge that will\r\nhelp him to satisfy the wants of the searching roots, or to guard leaf\r\nand bud from invading harm. The disposition to hoard had been utterly\r\ncrushed at the very first by the loss of his long-stored gold: the\r\ncoins he earned afterwards seemed as irrelevant as stones brought to\r\ncomplete a house suddenly buried by an earthquake; the sense of\r\nbereavement was too heavy upon him for the old thrill of satisfaction\r\nto arise again at the touch of the newly-earned coin. And now something\r\nhad come to replace his hoard which gave a growing purpose to the\r\nearnings, drawing his hope and joy continually onward beyond the money.\r\n\r\nIn old days there were angels who came and took men by the hand and led\r\nthem away from the city of destruction. We see no white-winged angels\r\nnow. But yet men are led away from threatening destruction: a hand is\r\nput into theirs, which leads them forth gently towards a calm and\r\nbright land, so that they look no more backward; and the hand may be a\r\nlittle child\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nThere was one person, as you will believe, who watched with keener\r\nthough more hidden interest than any other, the prosperous growth of\r\nEppie under the weaver\xe2\x80\x99s care. He dared not do anything that would\r\nimply a stronger interest in a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s adopted child than could be\r\nexpected from the kindliness of the young Squire, when a chance meeting\r\nsuggested a little present to a simple old fellow whom others noticed\r\nwith goodwill; but he told himself that the time would come when he\r\nmight do something towards furthering the welfare of his daughter\r\nwithout incurring suspicion. Was he very uneasy in the meantime at his\r\ninability to give his daughter her birthright? I cannot say that he\r\nwas. The child was being taken care of, and would very likely be happy,\r\nas people in humble stations often were\xe2\x80\x94happier, perhaps, than those\r\nbrought up in luxury.\r\n\r\nThat famous ring that pricked its owner when he forgot duty and\r\nfollowed desire\xe2\x80\x94I wonder if it pricked very hard when he set out on the\r\nchase, or whether it pricked but lightly then, and only pierced to the\r\nquick when the chase had long been ended, and hope, folding her wings,\r\nlooked backward and became regret?\r\n\r\nGodfrey Cass\xe2\x80\x99s cheek and eye were brighter than ever now. He was so\r\nundivided in his aims, that he seemed like a man of firmness. No Dunsey\r\nhad come back: people had made up their minds that he was gone for a\r\nsoldier, or gone \xe2\x80\x9cout of the country\xe2\x80\x9d, and no one cared to be specific\r\nin their inquiries on a subject delicate to a respectable family.\r\nGodfrey had ceased to see the shadow of Dunsey across his path; and the\r\npath now lay straight forward to the accomplishment of his best,\r\nlongest-cherished wishes. Everybody said Mr. Godfrey had taken the\r\nright turn; and it was pretty clear what would be the end of things,\r\nfor there were not many days in the week that he was not seen riding to\r\nthe Warrens. Godfrey himself, when he was asked jocosely if the day had\r\nbeen fixed, smiled with the pleasant consciousness of a lover who could\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d, if he liked. He felt a reformed man, delivered from\r\ntemptation; and the vision of his future life seemed to him as a\r\npromised land for which he had no cause to fight. He saw himself with\r\nall his happiness centred on his own hearth, while Nancy would smile on\r\nhim as he played with the children.\r\n\r\nAnd that other child\xe2\x80\x94not on the hearth\xe2\x80\x94he would not forget it; he would\r\nsee that it was well provided for. That was a father\xe2\x80\x99s duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright autumn Sunday, sixteen years after Silas Marner had\r\nfound his new treasure on the hearth. The bells of the old Raveloe\r\nchurch were ringing the cheerful peal which told that the morning\r\nservice was ended; and out of the arched doorway in the tower came\r\nslowly, retarded by friendly greetings and questions, the richer\r\nparishioners who had chosen this bright Sunday morning as eligible for\r\nchurch-going. It was the rural fashion of that time for the more\r\nimportant members of the congregation to depart first, while their\r\nhumbler neighbours waited and looked on, stroking their bent heads or\r\ndropping their curtsies to any large ratepayer who turned to notice\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nForemost among these advancing groups of well-clad people, there are\r\nsome whom we shall recognize, in spite of Time, who has laid his hand\r\non them all. The tall blond man of forty is not much changed in feature\r\nfrom the Godfrey Cass of six-and-twenty: he is only fuller in flesh,\r\nand has only lost the indefinable look of youth\xe2\x80\x94a loss which is marked\r\neven when the eye is undulled and the wrinkles are not yet come.\r\nPerhaps the pretty woman, not much younger than he, who is leaning on\r\nhis arm, is more changed than her husband: the lovely bloom that used\r\nto be always on her cheek now comes but fitfully, with the fresh\r\nmorning air or with some strong surprise; yet to all who love human\r\nfaces best for what they tell of human experience, Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s beauty has a\r\nheightened interest. Often the soul is ripened into fuller goodness\r\nwhile age has spread an ugly film, so that mere glances can never\r\ndivine the preciousness of the fruit. But the years have not been so\r\ncruel to Nancy. The firm yet placid mouth, the clear veracious glance\r\nof the brown eyes, speak now of a nature that has been tested and has\r\nkept its highest qualities; and even the costume, with its dainty\r\nneatness and purity, has more significance now the coquetries of youth\r\ncan have nothing to do with it.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Godfrey Cass (any higher title has died away from Raveloe\r\nlips since the old Squire was gathered to his fathers and his\r\ninheritance was divided) have turned round to look for the tall aged\r\nman and the plainly dressed woman who are a little behind\xe2\x80\x94Nancy having\r\nobserved that they must wait for \xe2\x80\x9cfather and Priscilla\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and now they\r\nall turn into a narrower path leading across the churchyard to a small\r\ngate opposite the Red House. We will not follow them now; for may there\r\nnot be some others in this departing congregation whom we should like\r\nto see again\xe2\x80\x94some of those who are not likely to be handsomely clad,\r\nand whom we may not recognize so easily as the master and mistress of\r\nthe Red House?\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible to mistake Silas Marner. His large brown eyes seem\r\nto have gathered a longer vision, as is the way with eyes that have\r\nbeen short-sighted in early life, and they have a less vague, a more\r\nanswering gaze; but in everything else one sees signs of a frame much\r\nenfeebled by the lapse of the sixteen years. The weaver\xe2\x80\x99s bent\r\nshoulders and white hair give him almost the look of advanced age,\r\nthough he is not more than five-and-fifty; but there is the freshest\r\nblossom of youth close by his side\xe2\x80\x94a blonde dimpled girl of eighteen,\r\nwho has vainly tried to chastise her curly auburn hair into smoothness\r\nunder her brown bonnet: the hair ripples as obstinately as a brooklet\r\nunder the March breeze, and the little ringlets burst away from the\r\nrestraining comb behind and show themselves below the bonnet-crown.\r\nEppie cannot help being rather vexed about her hair, for there is no\r\nother girl in Raveloe who has hair at all like it, and she thinks hair\r\nought to be smooth. She does not like to be blameworthy even in small\r\nthings: you see how neatly her prayer-book is folded in her spotted\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\nThat good-looking young fellow, in a new fustian suit, who walks behind\r\nher, is not quite sure upon the question of hair in the abstract, when\r\nEppie puts it to him, and thinks that perhaps straight hair is the best\r\nin general, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s hair to be different. She\r\nsurely divines that there is some one behind her who is thinking about\r\nher very particularly, and mustering courage to come to her side as\r\nsoon as they are out in the lane, else why should she look rather shy,\r\nand take care not to turn away her head from her father Silas, to whom\r\nshe keeps murmuring little sentences as to who was at church and who\r\nwas not at church, and how pretty the red mountain-ash is over the\r\nRectory wall?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish _we_ had a little garden, father, with double daisies in, like\r\nMrs. Winthrop\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, when they were out in the lane; \xe2\x80\x9conly\r\nthey say it \xe2\x80\x99ud take a deal of digging and bringing fresh soil\xe2\x80\x94and you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, could you, father? Anyhow, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like you to do\r\nit, for it \xe2\x80\x99ud be too hard work for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I could do it, child, if you want a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 garden: these long\r\nevenings, I could work at taking in a little bit o\xe2\x80\x99 the waste, just\r\nenough for a root or two o\xe2\x80\x99 flowers for you; and again, i\xe2\x80\x99 the morning,\r\nI could have a turn wi\xe2\x80\x99 the spade before I sat down to the loom. Why\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me before as you wanted a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 garden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ can dig it for you, Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man in fustian,\r\nwho was now by Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s side, entering into the conversation without the\r\ntrouble of formalities. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be play to me after I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, or any odd bits o\xe2\x80\x99 time when the work\xe2\x80\x99s slack. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you\r\nsome soil from Mr. Cass\xe2\x80\x99s garden\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ll let me, and willing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, Aaron, my lad, are you there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas; \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware of you;\r\nfor when Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s talking o\xe2\x80\x99 things, I see nothing but what she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na-saying. Well, if you could help me with the digging, we might get her\r\na bit o\xe2\x80\x99 garden all the sooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if you think well and good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aaron, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come to the\r\nStone-pits this afternoon, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll settle what land\xe2\x80\x99s to be taken in,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll get up an hour earlier i\xe2\x80\x99 the morning, and begin on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not if you don\xe2\x80\x99t promise me not to work at the hard digging,\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie. \xe2\x80\x9cFor I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 said anything about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, half-bashfully, half-roguishly, \xe2\x80\x9conly Mrs. Winthrop said as\r\nAaron \xe2\x80\x99ud be so good, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you might ha\xe2\x80\x99 known it without mother telling you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aaron.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Master Marner knows too, I hope, as I\xe2\x80\x99m able and willing to do a\r\nturn o\xe2\x80\x99 work for him, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t do me the unkindness to anyways take\r\nit out o\xe2\x80\x99 my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, now, father, you won\xe2\x80\x99t work in it till it\xe2\x80\x99s all easy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEppie, \xe2\x80\x9cand you and me can mark out the beds, and make holes and plant\r\nthe roots. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a deal livelier at the Stone-pits when we\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nsome flowers, for I always think the flowers can see us and know what\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 rosemary, and bergamot, and\r\nthyme, because they\xe2\x80\x99re so sweet-smelling; but there\xe2\x80\x99s no lavender only\r\nin the gentlefolks\xe2\x80\x99 gardens, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have some,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aaron, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I can\r\nbring you slips of anything; I\xe2\x80\x99m forced to cut no end of \xe2\x80\x99em when I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngardening, and throw \xe2\x80\x99em away mostly. There\xe2\x80\x99s a big bed o\xe2\x80\x99 lavender at\r\nthe Red House: the missis is very fond of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cso as you don\xe2\x80\x99t make free for us, or ask\r\nfor anything as is worth much at the Red House: for Mr. Cass\xe2\x80\x99s been so\r\ngood to us, and built us up the new end o\xe2\x80\x99 the cottage, and given us\r\nbeds and things, as I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abide to be imposin\xe2\x80\x99 for garden-stuff or\r\nanything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, there\xe2\x80\x99s no imposin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aaron; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s never a garden in\r\nall the parish but what there\xe2\x80\x99s endless waste in it for want o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsomebody as could use everything up. It\xe2\x80\x99s what I think to myself\r\nsometimes, as there need nobody run short o\xe2\x80\x99 victuals if the land was\r\nmade the most on, and there was never a morsel but what could find its\r\nway to a mouth. It sets one thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x94gardening does. But I must\r\ngo back now, else mother \xe2\x80\x99ull be in trouble as I aren\xe2\x80\x99t there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring her with you this afternoon, Aaron,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie; \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike to fix about the garden, and her not know everything from the\r\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94should _you_, father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, bring her if you can, Aaron,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s sure to have a\r\nword to say as\xe2\x80\x99ll help us to set things on their right end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAaron turned back up the village, while Silas and Eppie went on up the\r\nlonely sheltered lane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO daddy!\xe2\x80\x9d she began, when they were in privacy, clasping and squeezing\r\nSilas\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and skipping round to give him an energetic kiss. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nlittle old daddy! I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall want anything else\r\nwhen we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a little garden; and I knew Aaron would dig it for us,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe went on with roguish triumph\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a deep little puss, you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, with the mild passive\r\nhappiness of love-crowned age in his face; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\xe2\x80\x99ll make yourself\r\nfine and beholden to Aaron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, laughing and frisking; \xe2\x80\x9che likes it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, let me carry your prayer-book, else you\xe2\x80\x99ll be dropping it,\r\njumping i\xe2\x80\x99 that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEppie was now aware that her behaviour was under observation, but it\r\nwas only the observation of a friendly donkey, browsing with a log\r\nfastened to his foot\xe2\x80\x94a meek donkey, not scornfully critical of human\r\ntrivialities, but thankful to share in them, if possible, by getting\r\nhis nose scratched; and Eppie did not fail to gratify him with her\r\nusual notice, though it was attended with the inconvenience of his\r\nfollowing them, painfully, up to the very door of their home.\r\n\r\nBut the sound of a sharp bark inside, as Eppie put the key in the door,\r\nmodified the donkey\xe2\x80\x99s views, and he limped away again without bidding.\r\nThe sharp bark was the sign of an excited welcome that was awaiting\r\nthem from a knowing brown terrier, who, after dancing at their legs in\r\na hysterical manner, rushed with a worrying noise at a tortoise-shell\r\nkitten under the loom, and then rushed back with a sharp bark again, as\r\nmuch as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI have done my duty by this feeble creature, you\r\nperceive\xe2\x80\x9d; while the lady-mother of the kitten sat sunning her white\r\nbosom in the window, and looked round with a sleepy air of expecting\r\ncaresses, though she was not going to take any trouble for them.\r\n\r\nThe presence of this happy animal life was not the only change which\r\nhad come over the interior of the stone cottage. There was no bed now\r\nin the living-room, and the small space was well filled with decent\r\nfurniture, all bright and clean enough to satisfy Dolly Winthrop\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\nThe oaken table and three-cornered oaken chair were hardly what was\r\nlikely to be seen in so poor a cottage: they had come, with the beds\r\nand other things, from the Red House; for Mr. Godfrey Cass, as every\r\none said in the village, did very kindly by the weaver; and it was\r\nnothing but right a man should be looked on and helped by those who\r\ncould afford it, when he had brought up an orphan child, and been\r\nfather and mother to her\xe2\x80\x94and had lost his money too, so as he had\r\nnothing but what he worked for week by week, and when the weaving was\r\ngoing down too\xe2\x80\x94for there was less and less flax spun\xe2\x80\x94and Master Marner\r\nwas none so young. Nobody was jealous of the weaver, for he was\r\nregarded as an exceptional person, whose claims on neighbourly help\r\nwere not to be matched in Raveloe. Any superstition that remained\r\nconcerning him had taken an entirely new colour; and Mr. Macey, now a\r\nvery feeble old man of fourscore and six, never seen except in his\r\nchimney-corner or sitting in the sunshine at his door-sill, was of\r\nopinion that when a man had done what Silas had done by an orphan\r\nchild, it was a sign that his money would come to light again, or\r\nleastwise that the robber would be made to answer for it\xe2\x80\x94for, as Mr.\r\nMacey observed of himself, his faculties were as strong as ever.\r\n\r\nSilas sat down now and watched Eppie with a satisfied gaze as she\r\nspread the clean cloth, and set on it the potato-pie, warmed up slowly\r\nin a safe Sunday fashion, by being put into a dry pot over a\r\nslowly-dying fire, as the best substitute for an oven. For Silas would\r\nnot consent to have a grate and oven added to his conveniences: he\r\nloved the old brick hearth as he had loved his brown pot\xe2\x80\x94and was it not\r\nthere when he had found Eppie? The gods of the hearth exist for us\r\nstill; and let all new faith be tolerant of that fetishism, lest it\r\nbruise its own roots.\r\n\r\nSilas ate his dinner more silently than usual, soon laying down his\r\nknife and fork, and watching half-abstractedly Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s play with Snap\r\nand the cat, by which her own dining was made rather a lengthy\r\nbusiness. Yet it was a sight that might well arrest wandering thoughts:\r\nEppie, with the rippling radiance of her hair and the whiteness of her\r\nrounded chin and throat set off by the dark-blue cotton gown, laughing\r\nmerrily as the kitten held on with her four claws to one shoulder, like\r\na design for a jug-handle, while Snap on the right hand and Puss on the\r\nother put up their paws towards a morsel which she held out of the\r\nreach of both\xe2\x80\x94Snap occasionally desisting in order to remonstrate with\r\nthe cat by a cogent worrying growl on the greediness and futility of\r\nher conduct; till Eppie relented, caressed them both, and divided the\r\nmorsel between them.\r\n\r\nBut at last Eppie, glancing at the clock, checked the play, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO daddy, you\xe2\x80\x99re wanting to go into the sunshine to smoke your pipe.\r\nBut I must clear away first, so as the house may be tidy when godmother\r\ncomes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make haste\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t be long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilas had taken to smoking a pipe daily during the last two years,\r\nhaving been strongly urged to it by the sages of Raveloe, as a practice\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgood for the fits\xe2\x80\x9d; and this advice was sanctioned by Dr. Kimble, on\r\nthe ground that it was as well to try what could do no harm\xe2\x80\x94a principle\r\nwhich was made to answer for a great deal of work in that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmedical practice. Silas did not highly enjoy smoking, and often\r\nwondered how his neighbours could be so fond of it; but a humble sort\r\nof acquiescence in what was held to be good, had become a strong habit\r\nof that new self which had been developed in him since he had found\r\nEppie on his hearth: it had been the only clew his bewildered mind\r\ncould hold by in cherishing this young life that had been sent to him\r\nout of the darkness into which his gold had departed. By seeking what\r\nwas needful for Eppie, by sharing the effect that everything produced\r\non her, he had himself come to appropriate the forms of custom and\r\nbelief which were the mould of Raveloe life; and as, with reawakening\r\nsensibilities, memory also reawakened, he had begun to ponder over the\r\nelements of his old faith, and blend them with his new impressions,\r\ntill he recovered a consciousness of unity between his past and\r\npresent. The sense of presiding goodness and the human trust which come\r\nwith all pure peace and joy, had given him a dim impression that there\r\nhad been some error, some mistake, which had thrown that dark shadow\r\nover the days of his best years; and as it grew more and more easy to\r\nhim to open his mind to Dolly Winthrop, he gradually communicated to\r\nher all he could describe of his early life. The communication was\r\nnecessarily a slow and difficult process, for Silas\xe2\x80\x99s meagre power of\r\nexplanation was not aided by any readiness of interpretation in Dolly,\r\nwhose narrow outward experience gave her no key to strange customs, and\r\nmade every novelty a source of wonder that arrested them at every step\r\nof the narrative. It was only by fragments, and at intervals which left\r\nDolly time to revolve what she had heard till it acquired some\r\nfamiliarity for her, that Silas at last arrived at the climax of the\r\nsad story\xe2\x80\x94the drawing of lots, and its false testimony concerning him;\r\nand this had to be repeated in several interviews, under new questions\r\non her part as to the nature of this plan for detecting the guilty and\r\nclearing the innocent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yourn\xe2\x80\x99s the same Bible, you\xe2\x80\x99re sure o\xe2\x80\x99 that, Master Marner\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nBible as you brought wi\xe2\x80\x99 you from that country\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the same as what\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve got at church, and what Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s a-learning to read in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, \xe2\x80\x9cevery bit the same; and there\xe2\x80\x99s drawing o\xe2\x80\x99 lots in\r\nthe Bible, mind you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a lower tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly in a grieved voice, as if she were hearing\r\nan unfavourable report of a sick man\xe2\x80\x99s case. She was silent for some\r\nminutes; at last she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s wise folks, happen, as know how it all is; the parson knows,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound; but it takes big words to tell them things, and such as\r\npoor folks can\xe2\x80\x99t make much out on. I can never rightly know the meaning\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 what I hear at church, only a bit here and there, but I know it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood words\xe2\x80\x94I do. But what lies upo\xe2\x80\x99 your mind\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s this, Master Marner:\r\nas, if Them above had done the right thing by you, They\xe2\x80\x99d never ha\xe2\x80\x99 let\r\nyou be turned out for a wicked thief when you was innicent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, who had now come to understand Dolly\xe2\x80\x99s phraseology,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat was what fell on me like as if it had been red-hot iron; because,\r\nyou see, there was nobody as cared for me or clave to me above nor\r\nbelow. And him as I\xe2\x80\x99d gone out and in wi\xe2\x80\x99 for ten year and more, since\r\nwhen we was lads and went halves\xe2\x80\x94mine own familiar friend in whom I\r\ntrusted, had lifted up his heel again\xe2\x80\x99 me, and worked to ruin me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, but he was a bad un\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t think as there\xe2\x80\x99s another such,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDolly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m o\xe2\x80\x99ercome, Master Marner; I\xe2\x80\x99m like as if I\xe2\x80\x99d waked and\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it was night or morning. I feel somehow as sure as\r\nI do when I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid something up though I can\xe2\x80\x99t justly put my hand on\r\nit, as there was a rights in what happened to you, if one could but\r\nmake it out; and you\xe2\x80\x99d no call to lose heart as you did. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk\r\non it again; for sometimes things come into my head when I\xe2\x80\x99m leeching\r\nor poulticing, or such, as I could never think on when I was sitting\r\nstill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDolly was too useful a woman not to have many opportunities of\r\nillumination of the kind she alluded to, and she was not long before\r\nshe recurred to the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, one day that she came to bring home Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwashing, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been sore puzzled for a good bit wi\xe2\x80\x99 that trouble o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyourn and the drawing o\xe2\x80\x99 lots; and it got twisted back\xe2\x80\x99ards and\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x99ards, as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know which end to lay hold on. But it come to me\r\nall clear like, that night when I was sitting up wi\xe2\x80\x99 poor Bessy Fawkes,\r\nas is dead and left her children behind, God help \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94it come to me as\r\nclear as daylight; but whether I\xe2\x80\x99ve got hold on it now, or can anyways\r\nbring it to my tongue\xe2\x80\x99s end, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. For I\xe2\x80\x99ve often a deal\r\ninside me as\xe2\x80\x99ll never come out; and for what you talk o\xe2\x80\x99 your folks in\r\nyour old country niver saying prayers by heart nor saying \xe2\x80\x99em out of a\r\nbook, they must be wonderful cliver; for if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x9cOur Father\xe2\x80\x9d,\r\nand little bits o\xe2\x80\x99 good words as I can carry out o\xe2\x80\x99 church wi\xe2\x80\x99 me, I\r\nmight down o\xe2\x80\x99 my knees every night, but nothing could I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can mostly say something as I can make sense on, Mrs.\r\nWinthrop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Master Marner, it come to me summat like this: I can make\r\nnothing o\xe2\x80\x99 the drawing o\xe2\x80\x99 lots and the answer coming wrong; it \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nmayhap take the parson to tell that, and he could only tell us i\xe2\x80\x99 big\r\nwords. But what come to me as clear as the daylight, it was when I was\r\ntroubling over poor Bessy Fawkes, and it allays comes into my head when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for folks, and feel as I can\xe2\x80\x99t do a power to help \xe2\x80\x99em, not if\r\nI was to get up i\xe2\x80\x99 the middle o\xe2\x80\x99 the night\xe2\x80\x94it comes into my head as\r\nThem above has got a deal tenderer heart nor what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\xe2\x80\x94for I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe anyways better nor Them as made me; and if anything looks hard to\r\nme, it\xe2\x80\x99s because there\xe2\x80\x99s things I don\xe2\x80\x99t know on; and for the matter o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat, there may be plenty o\xe2\x80\x99 things I don\xe2\x80\x99t know on, for it\xe2\x80\x99s little as\r\nI know\xe2\x80\x94that it is. And so, while I was thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 that, you come into\r\nmy mind, Master Marner, and it all come pouring in:\xe2\x80\x94if _I_ felt i\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\ninside what was the right and just thing by you, and them as prayed and\r\ndrawed the lots, all but that wicked un, if _they_\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 done the right\r\nthing by you if they could, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there Them as was at the making on\r\nus, and knows better and has a better will? And that\xe2\x80\x99s all as ever I\r\ncan be sure on, and everything else is a big puzzle to me when I think\r\non it. For there was the fever come and took off them as were\r\nfull-growed, and left the helpless children; and there\xe2\x80\x99s the breaking\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 limbs; and them as \xe2\x80\x99ud do right and be sober have to suffer by them\r\nas are contrairy\xe2\x80\x94eh, there\xe2\x80\x99s trouble i\xe2\x80\x99 this world, and there\xe2\x80\x99s things\r\nas we can niver make out the rights on. And all as we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do is\r\nto trusten, Master Marner\xe2\x80\x94to do the right thing as fur as we know, and\r\nto trusten. For if us as knows so little can see a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 good and\r\nrights, we may be sure as there\xe2\x80\x99s a good and a rights bigger nor what\r\nwe can know\xe2\x80\x94I feel it i\xe2\x80\x99 my own inside as it must be so. And if you\r\ncould but ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone on trustening, Master Marner, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 run\r\naway from your fellow-creaturs and been so lone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but that \xe2\x80\x99ud ha\xe2\x80\x99 been hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, in an under-tone; \xe2\x80\x9cit \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 been hard to trusten then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, almost with compunction; \xe2\x80\x9cthem things\r\nare easier said nor done; and I\xe2\x80\x99m partly ashamed o\xe2\x80\x99 talking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re i\xe2\x80\x99 the right, Mrs. Winthrop\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe right. There\xe2\x80\x99s good i\xe2\x80\x99 this world\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve a feeling o\xe2\x80\x99 that now; and\r\nit makes a man feel as there\xe2\x80\x99s a good more nor he can see, i\xe2\x80\x99 spite o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe trouble and the wickedness. That drawing o\xe2\x80\x99 the lots is dark; but\r\nthe child was sent to me: there\xe2\x80\x99s dealings with us\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s dealings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis dialogue took place in Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s earlier years, when Silas had to\r\npart with her for two hours every day, that she might learn to read at\r\nthe dame school, after he had vainly tried himself to guide her in that\r\nfirst step to learning. Now that she was grown up, Silas had often been\r\nled, in those moments of quiet outpouring which come to people who live\r\ntogether in perfect love, to talk with _her_ too of the past, and how\r\nand why he had lived a lonely man until she had been sent to him. For\r\nit would have been impossible for him to hide from Eppie that she was\r\nnot his own child: even if the most delicate reticence on the point\r\ncould have been expected from Raveloe gossips in her presence, her own\r\nquestions about her mother could not have been parried, as she grew up,\r\nwithout that complete shrouding of the past which would have made a\r\npainful barrier between their minds. So Eppie had long known how her\r\nmother had died on the snowy ground, and how she herself had been found\r\non the hearth by father Silas, who had taken her golden curls for his\r\nlost guineas brought back to him. The tender and peculiar love with\r\nwhich Silas had reared her in almost inseparable companionship with\r\nhimself, aided by the seclusion of their dwelling, had preserved her\r\nfrom the lowering influences of the village talk and habits, and had\r\nkept her mind in that freshness which is sometimes falsely supposed to\r\nbe an invariable attribute of rusticity. Perfect love has a breath of\r\npoetry which can exalt the relations of the least-instructed human\r\nbeings; and this breath of poetry had surrounded Eppie from the time\r\nwhen she had followed the bright gleam that beckoned her to Silas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhearth; so that it is not surprising if, in other things besides her\r\ndelicate prettiness, she was not quite a common village maiden, but had\r\na touch of refinement and fervour which came from no other teaching\r\nthan that of tenderly-nurtured unvitiated feeling. She was too childish\r\nand simple for her imagination to rove into questions about her unknown\r\nfather; for a long while it did not even occur to her that she must\r\nhave had a father; and the first time that the idea of her mother\r\nhaving had a husband presented itself to her, was when Silas showed her\r\nthe wedding-ring which had been taken from the wasted finger, and had\r\nbeen carefully preserved by him in a little lackered box shaped like a\r\nshoe. He delivered this box into Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s charge when she had grown up,\r\nand she often opened it to look at the ring: but still she thought\r\nhardly at all about the father of whom it was the symbol. Had she not a\r\nfather very close to her, who loved her better than any real fathers in\r\nthe village seemed to love their daughters? On the contrary, who her\r\nmother was, and how she came to die in that forlornness, were questions\r\nthat often pressed on Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Her knowledge of Mrs. Winthrop, who\r\nwas her nearest friend next to Silas, made her feel that a mother must\r\nbe very precious; and she had again and again asked Silas to tell her\r\nhow her mother looked, whom she was like, and how he had found her\r\nagainst the furze bush, led towards it by the little footsteps and the\r\noutstretched arms. The furze bush was there still; and this afternoon,\r\nwhen Eppie came out with Silas into the sunshine, it was the first\r\nobject that arrested her eyes and thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a tone of gentle gravity, which sometimes came\r\nlike a sadder, slower cadence across her playfulness, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall take\r\nthe furze bush into the garden; it\xe2\x80\x99ll come into the corner, and just\r\nagainst it I\xe2\x80\x99ll put snowdrops and crocuses, \xe2\x80\x99cause Aaron says they\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t die out, but\xe2\x80\x99ll always get more and more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, always ready to talk when he had his pipe in\r\nhis hand, apparently enjoying the pauses more than the puffs, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to leave out the furze bush; and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing prettier,\r\nto my thinking, when it\xe2\x80\x99s yallow with flowers. But it\xe2\x80\x99s just come into\r\nmy head what we\xe2\x80\x99re to do for a fence\xe2\x80\x94mayhap Aaron can help us to a\r\nthought; but a fence we must have, else the donkeys and things \xe2\x80\x99ull\r\ncome and trample everything down. And fencing\xe2\x80\x99s hard to be got at, by\r\nwhat I can make out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, daddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, clasping her hands suddenly,\r\nafter a minute\xe2\x80\x99s thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s lots o\xe2\x80\x99 loose stones about, some of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em not big, and we might lay \xe2\x80\x99em atop of one another, and make a wall.\r\nYou and me could carry the smallest, and Aaron \xe2\x80\x99ud carry the rest\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknow he would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, my precious un,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, \xe2\x80\x9cthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough stones to go all\r\nround; and as for you carrying, why, wi\xe2\x80\x99 your little arms you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncarry a stone no bigger than a turnip. You\xe2\x80\x99re dillicate made, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, with a tender intonation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what Mrs. Winthrop says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m stronger than you think, daddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie; \xe2\x80\x9cand if there\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t stones enough to go all round, why they\xe2\x80\x99ll go part o\xe2\x80\x99 the way,\r\nand then it\xe2\x80\x99ll be easier to get sticks and things for the rest. See\r\nhere, round the big pit, what a many stones!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe skipped forward to the pit, meaning to lift one of the stones and\r\nexhibit her strength, but she started back in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father, just come and look here,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccome and see how\r\nthe water\xe2\x80\x99s gone down since yesterday. Why, yesterday the pit was ever\r\nso full!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, coming to her side. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndraining they\xe2\x80\x99ve begun on, since harvest, i\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s fields, I\r\nreckon. The foreman said to me the other day, when I passed by \xe2\x80\x99em,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if we lay your bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwaste as dry as a bone.\xe2\x80\x9d It was Mr. Godfrey Cass, he said, had gone\r\ninto the draining: he\xe2\x80\x99d been taking these fields o\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Osgood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow odd it\xe2\x80\x99ll seem to have the old pit dried up!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, turning\r\naway, and stooping to lift rather a large stone. \xe2\x80\x9cSee, daddy, I can\r\ncarry this quite well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, going along with much energy for a\r\nfew steps, but presently letting it fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99re fine and strong, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, while Eppie shook\r\nher aching arms and laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, let us go and sit down on the\r\nbank against the stile there, and have no more lifting. You might hurt\r\nyourself, child. You\xe2\x80\x99d need have somebody to work for you\xe2\x80\x94and my arm\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t over strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilas uttered the last sentence slowly, as if it implied more than met\r\nthe ear; and Eppie, when they sat down on the bank, nestled close to\r\nhis side, and, taking hold caressingly of the arm that was not over\r\nstrong, held it on her lap, while Silas puffed again dutifully at the\r\npipe, which occupied his other arm. An ash in the hedgerow behind made\r\na fretted screen from the sun, and threw happy playful shadows all\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, very gently, after they had been sitting in\r\nsilence a little while, \xe2\x80\x9cif I was to be married, ought I to be married\r\nwith my mother\xe2\x80\x99s ring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilas gave an almost imperceptible start, though the question fell in\r\nwith the under-current of thought in his own mind, and then said, in a\r\nsubdued tone, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Eppie, have you been a-thinking on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly this last week, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, ingenuously, \xe2\x80\x9csince Aaron\r\ntalked to me about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, still in the same subdued way, as if\r\nhe were anxious lest he should fall into the slightest tone that was\r\nnot for Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said he should like to be married, because he was a-going in\r\nfour-and-twenty, and had got a deal of gardening work, now Mr. Mott\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngiven up; and he goes twice a-week regular to Mr. Cass\xe2\x80\x99s, and once to\r\nMr. Osgood\xe2\x80\x99s, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to take him on at the Rectory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is it as he\xe2\x80\x99s wanting to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, with rather a sad\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, me, to be sure, daddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, with dimpling laughter,\r\nkissing her father\xe2\x80\x99s cheek; \xe2\x80\x9cas if he\xe2\x80\x99d want to marry anybody else!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you mean to have him, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, some time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know when. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s married\r\nsome time, Aaron says. But I told him that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true: for, I said,\r\nlook at father\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s never been married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, \xe2\x80\x9cyour father was a lone man till you was sent\r\nto him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll never be lone again, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nwas what Aaron said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI could never think o\xe2\x80\x99 taking you away from Master\r\nMarner, Eppie.\xe2\x80\x9d And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt \xe2\x80\x99ud be no use if you did, Aaron.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nhe wants us all to live together, so as you needn\xe2\x80\x99t work a bit, father,\r\nonly what\xe2\x80\x99s for your own pleasure; and he\xe2\x80\x99d be as good as a son to\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94that was what he said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd should you like that, Eppie?\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, looking at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, quite simply. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I should\r\nlike things to be so as you needn\xe2\x80\x99t work much. But if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for\r\nthat, I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner things didn\xe2\x80\x99t change. I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy: I like Aaron to\r\nbe fond of me, and come and see us often, and behave pretty to you\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nalways _does_ behave pretty to you, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he, father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, child, nobody could behave better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, emphatically.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s his mother\xe2\x80\x99s lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any change,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to go on a\r\nlong, long while, just as we are. Only Aaron does want a change; and he\r\nmade me cry a bit\xe2\x80\x94only a bit\xe2\x80\x94because he said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for him, for\r\nif I cared for him I should want us to be married, as he did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, my blessed child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, laying down his pipe as if it were\r\nuseless to pretend to smoke any longer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re o\xe2\x80\x99er young to be\r\nmarried. We\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Mrs. Winthrop\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s mother what _she_\r\nthinks: if there\xe2\x80\x99s a right thing to do, she\xe2\x80\x99ll come at it. But there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthis to be thought on, Eppie: things _will_ change, whether we like it\r\nor no; things won\xe2\x80\x99t go on for a long while just as they are and no\r\ndifference. I shall get older and helplesser, and be a burden on you,\r\nbelike, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t go away from you altogether. Not as I mean you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nthink me a burden\xe2\x80\x94I know you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94but it \xe2\x80\x99ud be hard upon you; and\r\nwhen I look for\xe2\x80\x99ard to that, I like to think as you\xe2\x80\x99d have somebody\r\nelse besides me\xe2\x80\x94somebody young and strong, as\xe2\x80\x99ll outlast your own life,\r\nand take care on you to the end.\xe2\x80\x9d Silas paused, and, resting his wrists\r\non his knees, lifted his hands up and down meditatively as he looked on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, would you like me to be married, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, with a\r\nlittle trembling in her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not be the man to say no, Eppie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, emphatically; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll ask your godmother. She\xe2\x80\x99ll wish the right thing by you and her\r\nson too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere they come, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and meet \xe2\x80\x99em. Oh, the\r\npipe! won\xe2\x80\x99t you have it lit again, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, lifting that\r\nmedicinal appliance from the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done enough for to-day. I think,\r\nmayhap, a little of it does me more good than so much at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nWhile Silas and Eppie were seated on the bank discoursing in the\r\nfleckered shade of the ash tree, Miss Priscilla Lammeter was resisting\r\nher sister\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, that it would be better to take tea at the Red\r\nHouse, and let her father have a long nap, than drive home to the\r\nWarrens so soon after dinner. The family party (of four only) were\r\nseated round the table in the dark wainscoted parlour, with the Sunday\r\ndessert before them, of fresh filberts, apples, and pears, duly\r\nornamented with leaves by Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s own hand before the bells had rung\r\nfor church.\r\n\r\nA great change has come over the dark wainscoted parlour since we saw\r\nit in Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s bachelor days, and under the wifeless reign of the old\r\nSquire. Now all is polish, on which no yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s dust is ever allowed\r\nto rest, from the yard\xe2\x80\x99s width of oaken boards round the carpet, to the\r\nold Squire\xe2\x80\x99s gun and whips and walking-sticks, ranged on the stag\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nantlers above the mantelpiece. All other signs of sporting and outdoor\r\noccupation Nancy has removed to another room; but she has brought into\r\nthe Red House the habit of filial reverence, and preserves sacredly in\r\na place of honour these relics of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s departed father. The\r\ntankards are on the side-table still, but the bossed silver is undimmed\r\nby handling, and there are no dregs to send forth unpleasant\r\nsuggestions: the only prevailing scent is of the lavender and\r\nrose-leaves that fill the vases of Derbyshire spar. All is purity and\r\norder in this once dreary room, for, fifteen years ago, it was entered\r\nby a new presiding spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, \xe2\x80\x9c_is_ there any call for you to go home to\r\ntea? Mayn\xe2\x80\x99t you just as well stay with us?\xe2\x80\x94such a beautiful evening as\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman had been talking with Godfrey about the increasing\r\npoor-rate and the ruinous times, and had not heard the dialogue between\r\nhis daughters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you must ask Priscilla,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in the once firm voice, now\r\nbecome rather broken. \xe2\x80\x9cShe manages me and the farm too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd reason good as I should manage you, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla, \xe2\x80\x9celse\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d be giving yourself your death with rheumatism. And as for the\r\nfarm, if anything turns out wrong, as it can\xe2\x80\x99t but do in these times,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing kills a man so soon as having nobody to find fault with\r\nbut himself. It\xe2\x80\x99s a deal the best way o\xe2\x80\x99 being master, to let somebody\r\nelse do the ordering, and keep the blaming in your own hands. It \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\nsave many a man a stroke, _I_ believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, with a quiet laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay you don\xe2\x80\x99t manage for everybody\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen manage so as you may stay tea, Priscilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, putting\r\nher hand on her sister\xe2\x80\x99s arm affectionately. \xe2\x80\x9cCome now; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nround the garden while father has his nap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a beautiful nap in the gig, for I shall\r\ndrive. And as for staying tea, I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear of it; for there\xe2\x80\x99s this\r\ndairymaid, now she knows she\xe2\x80\x99s to be married, turned Michaelmas, she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nas lief pour the new milk into the pig-trough as into the pans. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe way with \xe2\x80\x99em all: it\xe2\x80\x99s as if they thought the world \xe2\x80\x99ud be new-made\r\nbecause they\xe2\x80\x99re to be married. So come and let me put my bonnet on, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be time for us to walk round the garden while the horse is\r\nbeing put in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the sisters were treading the neatly-swept garden-walks, between\r\nthe bright turf that contrasted pleasantly with the dark cones and\r\narches and wall-like hedges of yew, Priscilla said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m as glad as anything at your husband\xe2\x80\x99s making that exchange o\xe2\x80\x99 land\r\nwith cousin Osgood, and beginning the dairying. It\xe2\x80\x99s a thousand pities\r\nyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it before; for it\xe2\x80\x99ll give you something to fill your\r\nmind. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like a dairy if folks want a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 worrit to\r\nmake the days pass. For as for rubbing furniture, when you can once see\r\nyour face in a table there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else to look for; but there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways something fresh with the dairy; for even in the depths o\xe2\x80\x99 winter\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s some pleasure in conquering the butter, and making it come\r\nwhether or no. My dear,\xe2\x80\x9d added Priscilla, pressing her sister\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\naffectionately as they walked side by side, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll never be low when\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a dairy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Priscilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, returning the pressure with a grateful\r\nglance of her clear eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it won\xe2\x80\x99t make up to Godfrey: a dairy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot so much to a man. And it\xe2\x80\x99s only what he cares for that ever makes\r\nme low. I\xe2\x80\x99m contented with the blessings we have, if he could be\r\ncontented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt drives me past patience,\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla, impetuously, \xe2\x80\x9cthat way o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe men\xe2\x80\x94always wanting and wanting, and never easy with what they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot: they can\xe2\x80\x99t sit comfortable in their chairs when they\xe2\x80\x99ve neither\r\nache nor pain, but either they must stick a pipe in their mouths, to\r\nmake \xe2\x80\x99em better than well, or else they must be swallowing something\r\nstrong, though they\xe2\x80\x99re forced to make haste before the next meal comes\r\nin. But joyful be it spoken, our father was never that sort o\xe2\x80\x99 man. And\r\nif it had pleased God to make you ugly, like me, so as the men wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 run after you, we might have kept to our own family, and had\r\nnothing to do with folks as have got uneasy blood in their veins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say so, Priscilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, repenting that she had\r\ncalled forth this outburst; \xe2\x80\x9cnobody has any occasion to find fault with\r\nGodfrey. It\xe2\x80\x99s natural he should be disappointed at not having any\r\nchildren: every man likes to have somebody to work for and lay by for,\r\nand he always counted so on making a fuss with \xe2\x80\x99em when they were\r\nlittle. There\xe2\x80\x99s many another man \xe2\x80\x99ud hanker more than he does. He\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbest of husbands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla, smiling sarcastically, \xe2\x80\x9cI know the way o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwives; they set one on to abuse their husbands, and then they turn\r\nround on one and praise \xe2\x80\x99em as if they wanted to sell \xe2\x80\x99em. But\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99ll be waiting for me; we must turn now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe large gig with the steady old grey was at the front door, and Mr.\r\nLammeter was already on the stone steps, passing the time in recalling\r\nto Godfrey what very fine points Speckle had when his master used to\r\nride him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always _would_ have a good horse, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman,\r\nnot liking that spirited time to be quite effaced from the memory of\r\nhis juniors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind you bring Nancy to the Warrens before the week\xe2\x80\x99s out, Mr. Cass,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas Priscilla\xe2\x80\x99s parting injunction, as she took the reins, and shook\r\nthem gently, by way of friendly incitement to Speckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall just take a turn to the fields against the Stone-pits, Nancy,\r\nand look at the draining,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be in again by tea-time, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I shall be back in an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s custom on a Sunday afternoon to do a little\r\ncontemplative farming in a leisurely walk. Nancy seldom accompanied\r\nhim; for the women of her generation\xe2\x80\x94unless, like Priscilla, they took\r\nto outdoor management\xe2\x80\x94were not given to much walking beyond their own\r\nhouse and garden, finding sufficient exercise in domestic duties. So,\r\nwhen Priscilla was not with her, she usually sat with Mant\xe2\x80\x99s Bible\r\nbefore her, and after following the text with her eyes for a little\r\nwhile, she would gradually permit them to wander as her thoughts had\r\nalready insisted on wandering.\r\n\r\nBut Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday thoughts were rarely quite out of keeping with the\r\ndevout and reverential intention implied by the book spread open before\r\nher. She was not theologically instructed enough to discern very\r\nclearly the relation between the sacred documents of the past which she\r\nopened without method, and her own obscure, simple life; but the spirit\r\nof rectitude, and the sense of responsibility for the effect of her\r\nconduct on others, which were strong elements in Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s character, had\r\nmade it a habit with her to scrutinize her past feelings and actions\r\nwith self-questioning solicitude. Her mind not being courted by a great\r\nvariety of subjects, she filled the vacant moments by living inwardly,\r\nagain and again, through all her remembered experience, especially\r\nthrough the fifteen years of her married time, in which her life and\r\nits significance had been doubled. She recalled the small details, the\r\nwords, tones, and looks, in the critical scenes which had opened a new\r\nepoch for her by giving her a deeper insight into the relations and\r\ntrials of life, or which had called on her for some little effort of\r\nforbearance, or of painful adherence to an imagined or real duty\xe2\x80\x94asking\r\nherself continually whether she had been in any respect blamable. This\r\nexcessive rumination and self-questioning is perhaps a morbid habit\r\ninevitable to a mind of much moral sensibility when shut out from its\r\ndue share of outward activity and of practical claims on its\r\naffections\xe2\x80\x94inevitable to a noble-hearted, childless woman, when her lot\r\nis narrow. \xe2\x80\x9cI can do so little\xe2\x80\x94have I done it all well?\xe2\x80\x9d is the\r\nperpetually recurring thought; and there are no voices calling her away\r\nfrom that soliloquy, no peremptory demands to divert energy from vain\r\nregret or superfluous scruple.\r\n\r\nThere was one main thread of painful experience in Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s married\r\nlife, and on it hung certain deeply-felt scenes, which were the\r\noftenest revived in retrospect. The short dialogue with Priscilla in\r\nthe garden had determined the current of retrospect in that frequent\r\ndirection this particular Sunday afternoon. The first wandering of her\r\nthought from the text, which she still attempted dutifully to follow\r\nwith her eyes and silent lips, was into an imaginary enlargement of the\r\ndefence she had set up for her husband against Priscilla\xe2\x80\x99s implied\r\nblame. The vindication of the loved object is the best balm affection\r\ncan find for its wounds:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cA man must have so much on his mind,\xe2\x80\x9d is the\r\nbelief by which a wife often supports a cheerful face under rough\r\nanswers and unfeeling words. And Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s deepest wounds had all come\r\nfrom the perception that the absence of children from their hearth was\r\ndwelt on in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s mind as a privation to which he could not\r\nreconcile himself.\r\n\r\nYet sweet Nancy might have been expected to feel still more keenly the\r\ndenial of a blessing to which she had looked forward with all the\r\nvaried expectations and preparations, solemn and prettily trivial,\r\nwhich fill the mind of a loving woman when she expects to become a\r\nmother. Was there not a drawer filled with the neat work of her hands,\r\nall unworn and untouched, just as she had arranged it there fourteen\r\nyears ago\xe2\x80\x94just, but for one little dress, which had been made the\r\nburial-dress? But under this immediate personal trial Nancy was so\r\nfirmly unmurmuring, that years ago she had suddenly renounced the habit\r\nof visiting this drawer, lest she should in this way be cherishing a\r\nlonging for what was not given.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was this very severity towards any indulgence of what she\r\nheld to be sinful regret in herself, that made her shrink from applying\r\nher own standard to her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very different\xe2\x80\x94it is much worse\r\nfor a man to be disappointed in that way: a woman can always be\r\nsatisfied with devoting herself to her husband, but a man wants\r\nsomething that will make him look forward more\xe2\x80\x94and sitting by the fire\r\nis so much duller to him than to a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d And always, when Nancy\r\nreached this point in her meditations\xe2\x80\x94trying, with predetermined\r\nsympathy, to see everything as Godfrey saw it\xe2\x80\x94there came a renewal of\r\nself-questioning. _Had_ she done everything in her power to lighten\r\nGodfrey\xe2\x80\x99s privation? Had she really been right in the resistance which\r\nhad cost her so much pain six years ago, and again four years ago\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nresistance to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s wish that they should adopt a child?\r\nAdoption was more remote from the ideas and habits of that time than of\r\nour own; still Nancy had her opinion on it. It was as necessary to her\r\nmind to have an opinion on all topics, not exclusively masculine, that\r\nhad come under her notice, as for her to have a precisely marked place\r\nfor every article of her personal property: and her opinions were\r\nalways principles to be unwaveringly acted on. They were firm, not\r\nbecause of their basis, but because she held them with a tenacity\r\ninseparable from her mental action. On all the duties and proprieties\r\nof life, from filial behaviour to the arrangements of the evening\r\ntoilette, pretty Nancy Lammeter, by the time she was three-and-twenty,\r\nhad her unalterable little code, and had formed every one of her habits\r\nin strict accordance with that code. She carried these decided\r\njudgments within her in the most unobtrusive way: they rooted\r\nthemselves in her mind, and grew there as quietly as grass. Years ago,\r\nwe know, she insisted on dressing like Priscilla, because \xe2\x80\x9cit was right\r\nfor sisters to dress alike\xe2\x80\x9d, and because \xe2\x80\x9cshe would do what was right\r\nif she wore a gown dyed with cheese-colouring\xe2\x80\x9d. That was a trivial but\r\ntypical instance of the mode in which Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s life was regulated.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those rigid principles, and no petty egoistic feeling,\r\nwhich had been the ground of Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s difficult resistance to her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s wish. To adopt a child, because children of your own had been\r\ndenied you, was to try and choose your lot in spite of Providence: the\r\nadopted child, she was convinced, would never turn out well, and would\r\nbe a curse to those who had wilfully and rebelliously sought what it\r\nwas clear that, for some high reason, they were better without. When\r\nyou saw a thing was not meant to be, said Nancy, it was a bounden duty\r\nto leave off so much as wishing for it. And so far, perhaps, the wisest\r\nof men could scarcely make more than a verbal improvement in her\r\nprinciple. But the conditions under which she held it apparent that a\r\nthing was not meant to be, depended on a more peculiar mode of\r\nthinking. She would have given up making a purchase at a particular\r\nplace if, on three successive times, rain, or some other cause of\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s sending, had formed an obstacle; and she would have\r\nanticipated a broken limb or other heavy misfortune to any one who\r\npersisted in spite of such indications.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should you think the child would turn out ill?\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey,\r\nin his remonstrances. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has thriven as well as child can do with the\r\nweaver; and _he_ adopted her. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t such a pretty little girl\r\nanywhere else in the parish, or one fitter for the station we could\r\ngive her. Where can be the likelihood of her being a curse to anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear Godfrey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, who was sitting with her hands\r\ntightly clasped together, and with yearning, regretful affection in her\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe child may not turn out ill with the weaver. But, then, he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t go to seek her, as we should be doing. It will be wrong: I feel\r\nsure it will. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember what that lady we met at the Royston\r\nBaths told us about the child her sister adopted? That was the only\r\nadopting I ever heard of: and the child was transported when it was\r\ntwenty-three. Dear Godfrey, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to do what I know is wrong: I\r\nshould never be happy again. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard for _you_\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neasier for me\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s the will of Providence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt might seem singular that Nancy\xe2\x80\x94with her religious theory pieced\r\ntogether out of narrow social traditions, fragments of church doctrine\r\nimperfectly understood, and girlish reasonings on her small\r\nexperience\xe2\x80\x94should have arrived by herself at a way of thinking so\r\nnearly akin to that of many devout people, whose beliefs are held in\r\nthe shape of a system quite remote from her knowledge\xe2\x80\x94singular, if we\r\ndid not know that human beliefs, like all other natural growths, elude\r\nthe barriers of system.\r\n\r\nGodfrey had from the first specified Eppie, then about twelve years\r\nold, as a child suitable for them to adopt. It had never occurred to\r\nhim that Silas would rather part with his life than with Eppie. Surely\r\nthe weaver would wish the best to the child he had taken so much\r\ntrouble with, and would be glad that such good fortune should happen to\r\nher: she would always be very grateful to him, and he would be well\r\nprovided for to the end of his life\xe2\x80\x94provided for as the excellent part\r\nhe had done by the child deserved. Was it not an appropriate thing for\r\npeople in a higher station to take a charge off the hands of a man in a\r\nlower? It seemed an eminently appropriate thing to Godfrey, for reasons\r\nthat were known only to himself; and by a common fallacy, he imagined\r\nthe measure would be easy because he had private motives for desiring\r\nit. This was rather a coarse mode of estimating Silas\xe2\x80\x99s relation to\r\nEppie; but we must remember that many of the impressions which Godfrey\r\nwas likely to gather concerning the labouring people around him would\r\nfavour the idea that deep affections can hardly go along with callous\r\npalms and scant means; and he had not had the opportunity, even if he\r\nhad had the power, of entering intimately into all that was exceptional\r\nin the weaver\xe2\x80\x99s experience. It was only the want of adequate knowledge\r\nthat could have made it possible for Godfrey deliberately to entertain\r\nan unfeeling project: his natural kindness had outlived that blighting\r\ntime of cruel wishes, and Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s praise of him as a husband was not\r\nfounded entirely on a wilful illusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, when she had recalled all their\r\nscenes of discussion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI feel I was right to say him nay, though it hurt\r\nme more than anything; but how good Godfrey has been about it! Many men\r\nwould have been very angry with me for standing out against their\r\nwishes; and they might have thrown out that they\xe2\x80\x99d had ill-luck in\r\nmarrying me; but Godfrey has never been the man to say me an unkind\r\nword. It\xe2\x80\x99s only what he can\xe2\x80\x99t hide: everything seems so blank to him, I\r\nknow; and the land\xe2\x80\x94what a difference it \xe2\x80\x99ud make to him, when he goes\r\nto see after things, if he\xe2\x80\x99d children growing up that he was doing it\r\nall for! But I won\xe2\x80\x99t murmur; and perhaps if he\xe2\x80\x99d married a woman who\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave had children, she\xe2\x80\x99d have vexed him in other ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis possibility was Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s chief comfort; and to give it greater\r\nstrength, she laboured to make it impossible that any other wife should\r\nhave had more perfect tenderness. She had been _forced_ to vex him by\r\nthat one denial. Godfrey was not insensible to her loving effort, and\r\ndid Nancy no injustice as to the motives of her obstinacy. It was\r\nimpossible to have lived with her fifteen years and not be aware that\r\nan unselfish clinging to the right, and a sincerity clear as the\r\nflower-born dew, were her main characteristics; indeed, Godfrey felt\r\nthis so strongly, that his own more wavering nature, too averse to\r\nfacing difficulty to be unvaryingly simple and truthful, was kept in a\r\ncertain awe of this gentle wife who watched his looks with a yearning\r\nto obey them. It seemed to him impossible that he should ever confess\r\nto her the truth about Eppie: she would never recover from the\r\nrepulsion the story of his earlier marriage would create, told to her\r\nnow, after that long concealment. And the child, too, he thought, must\r\nbecome an object of repulsion: the very sight of her would be painful.\r\nThe shock to Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s mingled pride and ignorance of the world\xe2\x80\x99s evil\r\nmight even be too much for her delicate frame. Since he had married her\r\nwith that secret on his heart, he must keep it there to the last.\r\nWhatever else he did, he could not make an irreparable breach between\r\nhimself and this long-loved wife.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, why could he not make up his mind to the absence of children\r\nfrom a hearth brightened by such a wife? Why did his mind fly uneasily\r\nto that void, as if it were the sole reason why life was not thoroughly\r\njoyous to him? I suppose it is the way with all men and women who reach\r\nmiddle age without the clear perception that life never _can_ be\r\nthoroughly joyous: under the vague dullness of the grey hours,\r\ndissatisfaction seeks a definite object, and finds it in the privation\r\nof an untried good. Dissatisfaction seated musingly on a childless\r\nhearth, thinks with envy of the father whose return is greeted by young\r\nvoices\xe2\x80\x94seated at the meal where the little heads rise one above another\r\nlike nursery plants, it sees a black care hovering behind every one of\r\nthem, and thinks the impulses by which men abandon freedom, and seek\r\nfor ties, are surely nothing but a brief madness. In Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s case\r\nthere were further reasons why his thoughts should be continually\r\nsolicited by this one point in his lot: his conscience, never\r\nthoroughly easy about Eppie, now gave his childless home the aspect of\r\na retribution; and as the time passed on, under Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to\r\nadopt her, any retrieval of his error became more and more difficult.\r\n\r\nOn this Sunday afternoon it was already four years since there had been\r\nany allusion to the subject between them, and Nancy supposed that it\r\nwas for ever buried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if he\xe2\x80\x99ll mind it less or more as he gets older,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid more. Aged people feel the miss of children: what would\r\nfather do without Priscilla? And if I die, Godfrey will be very\r\nlonely\xe2\x80\x94not holding together with his brothers much. But I won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nover-anxious, and trying to make things out beforehand: I must do my\r\nbest for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that last thought Nancy roused herself from her reverie, and\r\nturned her eyes again towards the forsaken page. It had been forsaken\r\nlonger than she imagined, for she was presently surprised by the\r\nappearance of the servant with the tea-things. It was, in fact, a\r\nlittle before the usual time for tea; but Jane had her reasons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your master come into the yard, Jane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo \xe2\x80\x99m, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane, with a slight emphasis, of which,\r\nhowever, her mistress took no notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen \xe2\x80\x99em, \xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Jane, after a\r\npause, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s folks making haste all one way, afore the front\r\nwindow. I doubt something\xe2\x80\x99s happened. There\xe2\x80\x99s niver a man to be seen i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe yard, else I\xe2\x80\x99d send and see. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been up into the top attic, but\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no seeing anything for trees. I hope nobody\xe2\x80\x99s hurt, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I daresay there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing much the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperhaps Mr. Snell\xe2\x80\x99s bull got out again, as he did before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish he mayn\xe2\x80\x99t gore anybody then, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane, not\r\naltogether despising a hypothesis which covered a few imaginary\r\ncalamities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat girl is always terrifying me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nancy; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish Godfrey\r\nwould come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went to the front window and looked as far as she could see along\r\nthe road, with an uneasiness which she felt to be childish, for there\r\nwere now no such signs of excitement as Jane had spoken of, and Godfrey\r\nwould not be likely to return by the village road, but by the fields.\r\nShe continued to stand, however, looking at the placid churchyard with\r\nthe long shadows of the gravestones across the bright green hillocks,\r\nand at the glowing autumn colours of the Rectory trees beyond. Before\r\nsuch calm external beauty the presence of a vague fear is more\r\ndistinctly felt\xe2\x80\x94like a raven flapping its slow wing across the sunny\r\nair. Nancy wished more and more that Godfrey would come in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nSome one opened the door at the other end of the room, and Nancy felt\r\nthat it was her husband. She turned from the window with gladness in\r\nher eyes, for the wife\xe2\x80\x99s chief dread was stilled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, I\xe2\x80\x99m so thankful you\xe2\x80\x99re come,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, going towards him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbegan to get\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused abruptly, for Godfrey was laying down his hat with trembling\r\nhands, and turned towards her with a pale face and a strange\r\nunanswering glance, as if he saw her indeed, but saw her as part of a\r\nscene invisible to herself. She laid her hand on his arm, not daring to\r\nspeak again; but he left the touch unnoticed, and threw himself into\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\nJane was already at the door with the hissing urn. \xe2\x80\x9cTell her to keep\r\naway, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey; and when the door was closed again he\r\nexerted himself to speak more distinctly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Nancy\xe2\x80\x94there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to a chair opposite him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncame back as soon as I could, to hinder anybody\xe2\x80\x99s telling you but me.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a great shock\xe2\x80\x94but I care most about the shock it\xe2\x80\x99ll be to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t father and Priscilla?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, with quivering lips,\r\nclasping her hands together tightly on her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s nobody living,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, unequal to the considerate\r\nskill with which he would have wished to make his revelation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDunstan\xe2\x80\x94my brother Dunstan, that we lost sight of sixteen years ago.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve found him\xe2\x80\x94found his body\xe2\x80\x94his skeleton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe deep dread Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s look had created in Nancy made her feel these\r\nwords a relief. She sat in comparative calmness to hear what else he\r\nhad to tell. He went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Stone-pit has gone dry suddenly\xe2\x80\x94from the draining, I suppose; and\r\nthere he lies\xe2\x80\x94has lain for sixteen years, wedged between two great\r\nstones. There\xe2\x80\x99s his watch and seals, and there\xe2\x80\x99s my gold-handled\r\nhunting-whip, with my name on: he took it away, without my knowing, the\r\nday he went hunting on Wildfire, the last time he was seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey paused: it was not so easy to say what came next. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think\r\nhe drowned himself?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, almost wondering that her husband\r\nshould be so deeply shaken by what had happened all those years ago to\r\nan unloved brother, of whom worse things had been augured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he fell in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, in a low but distinct voice, as if he\r\nfelt some deep meaning in the fact. Presently he added: \xe2\x80\x9cDunstan was\r\nthe man that robbed Silas Marner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s face and neck at this surprise and shame,\r\nfor she had been bred up to regard even a distant kinship with crime as\r\na dishonour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Godfrey!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with compassion in her tone, for she had\r\nimmediately reflected that the dishonour must be felt still more keenly\r\nby her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was the money in the pit,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9call the weaver\xe2\x80\x99s money.\r\nEverything\xe2\x80\x99s been gathered up, and they\xe2\x80\x99re taking the skeleton to the\r\nRainbow. But I came back to tell you: there was no hindering it; you\r\nmust know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent, looking on the ground for two long minutes. Nancy would\r\nhave said some words of comfort under this disgrace, but she refrained,\r\nfrom an instinctive sense that there was something behind\xe2\x80\x94that Godfrey\r\nhad something else to tell her. Presently he lifted his eyes to her\r\nface, and kept them fixed on her, as he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything comes to light, Nancy, sooner or later. When God Almighty\r\nwills it, our secrets are found out. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived with a secret on my\r\nmind, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it from you no longer. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have you know it\r\nby somebody else, and not by me\xe2\x80\x94I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have you find it out after\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m dead. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you now. It\xe2\x80\x99s been \xe2\x80\x9cI will\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d with me\r\nall my life\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure of myself now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNancy\xe2\x80\x99s utmost dread had returned. The eyes of the husband and wife met\r\nwith awe in them, as at a crisis which suspended affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I married you, I hid something\r\nfrom you\xe2\x80\x94something I ought to have told you. That woman Marner found\r\ndead in the snow\xe2\x80\x94Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x94that wretched woman\xe2\x80\x94was my wife: Eppie\r\nis my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, dreading the effect of his confession. But Nancy sat quite\r\nstill, only that her eyes dropped and ceased to meet his. She was pale\r\nand quiet as a meditative statue, clasping her hands on her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll never think the same of me again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, after a little\r\nwhile, with some tremor in his voice.\r\n\r\nShe was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have left the child unowned: I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have kept it\r\nfrom you. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to give you up, Nancy. I was led away\r\ninto marrying her\xe2\x80\x94I suffered for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill Nancy was silent, looking down; and he almost expected that she\r\nwould presently get up and say she would go to her father\xe2\x80\x99s. How could\r\nshe have any mercy for faults that must seem so black to her, with her\r\nsimple, severe notions?\r\n\r\nBut at last she lifted up her eyes to his again and spoke. There was no\r\nindignation in her voice\xe2\x80\x94only deep regret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGodfrey, if you had but told me this six years ago, we could have done\r\nsome of our duty by the child. Do you think I\xe2\x80\x99d have refused to take\r\nher in, if I\xe2\x80\x99d known she was yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment Godfrey felt all the bitterness of an error that was not\r\nsimply futile, but had defeated its own end. He had not measured this\r\nwife with whom he had lived so long. But she spoke again, with more\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94Oh, Godfrey\xe2\x80\x94if we\xe2\x80\x99d had her from the first, if you\xe2\x80\x99d taken to her\r\nas you ought, she\xe2\x80\x99d have loved me for her mother\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99d have been\r\nhappier with me: I could better have bore my little baby dying, and our\r\nlife might have been more like what we used to think it \xe2\x80\x99ud be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tears fell, and Nancy ceased to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have married me then, Nancy, if I\xe2\x80\x99d told you,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGodfrey, urged, in the bitterness of his self-reproach, to prove to\r\nhimself that his conduct had not been utter folly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may think you\r\nwould now, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t then. With your pride and your father\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d have hated having anything to do with me after the talk there\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say what I should have done about that, Godfrey. I should\r\nnever have married anybody else. But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth doing wrong\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94nothing is in this world. Nothing is so good as it seems\r\nbeforehand\xe2\x80\x94not even our marrying wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a faint\r\nsad smile on Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s face as she said the last words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a worse man than you thought I was, Nancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, rather\r\ntremulously. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you forgive me ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wrong to me is but little, Godfrey: you\xe2\x80\x99ve made it up to me\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen good to me for fifteen years. It\xe2\x80\x99s another you did the wrong to;\r\nand I doubt it can never be all made up for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we can take Eppie now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t mind the world\r\nknowing at last. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be plain and open for the rest o\xe2\x80\x99 my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be different coming to us, now she\xe2\x80\x99s grown up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy,\r\nshaking her head sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s your duty to acknowledge her and\r\nprovide for her; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my part by her, and pray to God Almighty\r\nto make her love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll go together to Silas Marner\xe2\x80\x99s this very night, as soon as\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x99s quiet at the Stone-pits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nBetween eight and nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening, Eppie and Silas were\r\nseated alone in the cottage. After the great excitement the weaver had\r\nundergone from the events of the afternoon, he had felt a longing for\r\nthis quietude, and had even begged Mrs. Winthrop and Aaron, who had\r\nnaturally lingered behind every one else, to leave him alone with his\r\nchild. The excitement had not passed away: it had only reached that\r\nstage when the keenness of the susceptibility makes external stimulus\r\nintolerable\xe2\x80\x94when there is no sense of weariness, but rather an\r\nintensity of inward life, under which sleep is an impossibility. Any\r\none who has watched such moments in other men remembers the brightness\r\nof the eyes and the strange definiteness that comes over coarse\r\nfeatures from that transient influence. It is as if a new fineness of\r\near for all spiritual voices had sent wonder-working vibrations through\r\nthe heavy mortal frame\xe2\x80\x94as if \xe2\x80\x9cbeauty born of murmuring sound\xe2\x80\x9d had\r\npassed into the face of the listener.\r\n\r\nSilas\xe2\x80\x99s face showed that sort of transfiguration, as he sat in his\r\narm-chair and looked at Eppie. She had drawn her own chair towards his\r\nknees, and leaned forward, holding both his hands, while she looked up\r\nat him. On the table near them, lit by a candle, lay the recovered\r\ngold\xe2\x80\x94the old long-loved gold, ranged in orderly heaps, as Silas used to\r\nrange it in the days when it was his only joy. He had been telling her\r\nhow he used to count it every night, and how his soul was utterly\r\ndesolate till she was sent to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first, I\xe2\x80\x99d a sort o\xe2\x80\x99 feeling come across me now and then,\xe2\x80\x9d he was\r\nsaying in a subdued tone, \xe2\x80\x9cas if you might be changed into the gold\r\nagain; for sometimes, turn my head which way I would, I seemed to see\r\nthe gold; and I thought I should be glad if I could feel it, and find\r\nit was come back. But that didn\xe2\x80\x99t last long. After a bit, I should have\r\nthought it was a curse come again, if it had drove you from me, for I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngot to feel the need o\xe2\x80\x99 your looks and your voice and the touch o\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\nlittle fingers. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know then, Eppie, when you were such a\r\nlittle un\xe2\x80\x94you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what your old father Silas felt for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know now, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for you,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d have taken me to the workhouse, and there\xe2\x80\x99d have been nobody to\r\nlove me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, my precious child, the blessing was mine. If you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been sent\r\nto save me, I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone to the grave in my misery. The money was\r\ntaken away from me in time; and you see it\xe2\x80\x99s been kept\xe2\x80\x94kept till it was\r\nwanted for you. It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful\xe2\x80\x94our life is wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilas sat in silence a few minutes, looking at the money. \xe2\x80\x9cIt takes no\r\nhold of me now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, ponderingly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe money doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. I wonder if\r\nit ever could again\xe2\x80\x94I doubt it might, if I lost you, Eppie. I might\r\ncome to think I was forsaken again, and lose the feeling that God was\r\ngood to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was a knocking at the door; and Eppie was obliged\r\nto rise without answering Silas. Beautiful she looked, with the\r\ntenderness of gathering tears in her eyes and a slight flush on her\r\ncheeks, as she stepped to open the door. The flush deepened when she\r\nsaw Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey Cass. She made her little rustic curtsy, and\r\nheld the door wide for them to enter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re disturbing you very late, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cass, taking\r\nEppie\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and looking in her face with an expression of anxious\r\ninterest and admiration. Nancy herself was pale and tremulous.\r\n\r\nEppie, after placing chairs for Mr. and Mrs. Cass, went to stand\r\nagainst Silas, opposite to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, trying to speak with perfect firmness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a great comfort to me to see you with your money again, that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been deprived of so many years. It was one of my family did you\r\nthe wrong\xe2\x80\x94the more grief to me\xe2\x80\x94and I feel bound to make up to you for\r\nit in every way. Whatever I can do for you will be nothing but paying a\r\ndebt, even if I looked no further than the robbery. But there are other\r\nthings I\xe2\x80\x99m beholden\xe2\x80\x94shall be beholden to you for, Marner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey checked himself. It had been agreed between him and his wife\r\nthat the subject of his fatherhood should be approached very carefully,\r\nand that, if possible, the disclosure should be reserved for the\r\nfuture, so that it might be made to Eppie gradually. Nancy had urged\r\nthis, because she felt strongly the painful light in which Eppie must\r\ninevitably see the relation between her father and mother.\r\n\r\nSilas, always ill at ease when he was being spoken to by \xe2\x80\x9cbetters\xe2\x80\x9d,\r\nsuch as Mr. Cass\xe2\x80\x94tall, powerful, florid men, seen chiefly on\r\nhorseback\xe2\x80\x94answered with some constraint\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, I\xe2\x80\x99ve a deal to thank you for a\xe2\x80\x99ready. As for the robbery, I count\r\nit no loss to me. And if I did, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it: you aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanswerable for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may look at it in that way, Marner, but I never can; and I hope\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll let me act according to my own feeling of what\xe2\x80\x99s just. I know\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re easily contented: you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a hard-working man all your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marner, meditatively. \xe2\x80\x9cI should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been bad off\r\nwithout my work: it was what I held by when everything else was gone\r\nfrom me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, applying Marner\xe2\x80\x99s words simply to his bodily wants,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit was a good trade for you in this country, because there\xe2\x80\x99s been a\r\ngreat deal of linen-weaving to be done. But you\xe2\x80\x99re getting rather past\r\nsuch close work, Marner: it\xe2\x80\x99s time you laid by and had some rest. You\r\nlook a good deal pulled down, though you\xe2\x80\x99re not an old man, _are_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifty-five, as near as I can say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, why, you may live thirty years longer\xe2\x80\x94look at old Macey! And that\r\nmoney on the table, after all, is but little. It won\xe2\x80\x99t go far either\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94whether it\xe2\x80\x99s put out to interest, or you were to live on it as long\r\nas it would last: it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go far if you\xe2\x80\x99d nobody to keep but\r\nyourself, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve had two to keep for a good many years now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, unaffected by anything Godfrey was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nin no fear o\xe2\x80\x99 want. We shall do very well\xe2\x80\x94Eppie and me \xe2\x80\x99ull do well\r\nenough. There\xe2\x80\x99s few working-folks have got so much laid by as that. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is to gentlefolks, but I look upon it as a\r\ndeal\xe2\x80\x94almost too much. And as for us, it\xe2\x80\x99s little we want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the garden, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, blushing up to the ears the\r\nmoment after.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love a garden, do you, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, thinking that this\r\nturn in the point of view might help her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should agree in\r\nthat: I give a deal of time to the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of gardening at the Red House,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey,\r\nsurprised at the difficulty he found in approaching a proposition which\r\nhad seemed so easy to him in the distance. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve done a good part by\r\nEppie, Marner, for sixteen years. It \xe2\x80\x99ud be a great comfort to you to\r\nsee her well provided for, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it? She looks blooming and healthy,\r\nbut not fit for any hardships: she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like a strapping girl\r\ncome of working parents. You\xe2\x80\x99d like to see her taken care of by those\r\nwho can leave her well off, and make a lady of her; she\xe2\x80\x99s more fit for\r\nit than for a rough life, such as she might come to have in a few\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x99 time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slight flush came over Marner\xe2\x80\x99s face, and disappeared, like a passing\r\ngleam. Eppie was simply wondering Mr. Cass should talk so about things\r\nthat seemed to have nothing to do with reality; but Silas was hurt and\r\nuneasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t take your meaning, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, not having words at\r\ncommand to express the mingled feelings with which he had heard Mr.\r\nCass\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my meaning is this, Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, determined to come to\r\nthe point. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Cass and I, you know, have no children\xe2\x80\x94nobody to\r\nbenefit by our good home and everything else we have\xe2\x80\x94more than enough\r\nfor ourselves. And we should like to have somebody in the place of a\r\ndaughter to us\xe2\x80\x94we should like to have Eppie, and treat her in every way\r\nas our own child. It \xe2\x80\x99ud be a great comfort to you in your old age, I\r\nhope, to see her fortune made in that way, after you\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the\r\ntrouble of bringing her up so well. And it\xe2\x80\x99s right you should have\r\nevery reward for that. And Eppie, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, will always love you and be\r\ngrateful to you: she\xe2\x80\x99d come and see you very often, and we should all\r\nbe on the look-out to do everything we could towards making you\r\ncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA plain man like Godfrey Cass, speaking under some embarrassment,\r\nnecessarily blunders on words that are coarser than his intentions, and\r\nthat are likely to fall gratingly on susceptible feelings. While he had\r\nbeen speaking, Eppie had quietly passed her arm behind Silas\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nand let her hand rest against it caressingly: she felt him trembling\r\nviolently. He was silent for some moments when Mr. Cass had\r\nended\xe2\x80\x94powerless under the conflict of emotions, all alike painful.\r\nEppie\xe2\x80\x99s heart was swelling at the sense that her father was in\r\ndistress; and she was just going to lean down and speak to him, when\r\none struggling dread at last gained the mastery over every other in\r\nSilas, and he said, faintly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEppie, my child, speak. I won\xe2\x80\x99t stand in your way. Thank Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEppie took her hand from her father\xe2\x80\x99s head, and came forward a step.\r\nHer cheeks were flushed, but not with shyness this time: the sense that\r\nher father was in doubt and suffering banished that sort of\r\nself-consciousness. She dropped a low curtsy, first to Mrs. Cass and\r\nthen to Mr. Cass, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94thank you, sir. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t leave my father, nor own\r\nanybody nearer than him. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a lady\xe2\x80\x94thank you all\r\nthe same\xe2\x80\x9d (here Eppie dropped another curtsy). \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give up the\r\nfolks I\xe2\x80\x99ve been used to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEppie\xe2\x80\x99s lips began to tremble a little at the last words. She retreated\r\nto her father\xe2\x80\x99s chair again, and held him round the neck: while Silas,\r\nwith a subdued sob, put up his hand to grasp hers.\r\n\r\nThe tears were in Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but her sympathy with Eppie was,\r\nnaturally, divided with distress on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s account. She dared\r\nnot speak, wondering what was going on in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\nGodfrey felt an irritation inevitable to almost all of us when we\r\nencounter an unexpected obstacle. He had been full of his own penitence\r\nand resolution to retrieve his error as far as the time was left to\r\nhim; he was possessed with all-important feelings, that were to lead to\r\na predetermined course of action which he had fixed on as the right,\r\nand he was not prepared to enter with lively appreciation into other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s feelings counteracting his virtuous resolves. The agitation\r\nwith which he spoke again was not quite unmixed with anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve a claim on you, Eppie\xe2\x80\x94the strongest of all claims. It\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nduty, Marner, to own Eppie as my child, and provide for her. She is my\r\nown child\xe2\x80\x94her mother was my wife. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a natural claim on her that must\r\nstand before every other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEppie had given a violent start, and turned quite pale. Silas, on the\r\ncontrary, who had been relieved, by Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s answer, from the dread lest\r\nhis mind should be in opposition to hers, felt the spirit of resistance\r\nin him set free, not without a touch of parental fierceness. \xe2\x80\x9cThen,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with an accent of bitterness that had been silent in\r\nhim since the memorable day when his youthful hope had perished\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthen,\r\nsir, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so sixteen year ago, and claim her before I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncome to love her, i\xe2\x80\x99stead o\xe2\x80\x99 coming to take her from me now, when you\r\nmight as well take the heart out o\xe2\x80\x99 my body? God gave her to me because\r\nyou turned your back upon her, and He looks upon her as mine: you\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nright to her! When a man turns a blessing from his door, it falls to\r\nthem as take it in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that, Marner. I was wrong. I\xe2\x80\x99ve repented of my conduct in that\r\nmatter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, who could not help feeling the edge of Silas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marner, with gathering excitement;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut repentance doesn\xe2\x80\x99t alter what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on for sixteen year.\r\nYour coming now and saying \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m her father\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t alter the feelings\r\ninside us. It\xe2\x80\x99s me she\xe2\x80\x99s been calling her father ever since she could\r\nsay the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think you might look at the thing more reasonably, Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGodfrey, unexpectedly awed by the weaver\xe2\x80\x99s direct truth-speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t as if she was to be taken quite away from you, so that you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nnever see her again. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be very near you, and come to see you very\r\noften. She\xe2\x80\x99ll feel just the same towards you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust the same?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marner, more bitterly than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99ll she feel\r\njust the same for me as she does now, when we eat o\xe2\x80\x99 the same bit, and\r\ndrink o\xe2\x80\x99 the same cup, and think o\xe2\x80\x99 the same things from one day\xe2\x80\x99s end\r\nto another? Just the same? that\xe2\x80\x99s idle talk. You\xe2\x80\x99d cut us i\xe2\x80\x99 two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey, unqualified by experience to discern the pregnancy of Marner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsimple words, felt rather angry again. It seemed to him that the weaver\r\nwas very selfish (a judgment readily passed by those who have never\r\ntested their own power of sacrifice) to oppose what was undoubtedly for\r\nEppie\xe2\x80\x99s welfare; and he felt himself called upon, for her sake, to\r\nassert his authority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought, Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, severely\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI should have\r\nthought your affection for Eppie would make you rejoice in what was for\r\nher good, even if it did call upon you to give up something. You ought\r\nto remember your own life\xe2\x80\x99s uncertain, and she\xe2\x80\x99s at an age now when her\r\nlot may soon be fixed in a way very different from what it would be in\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s home: she may marry some low working-man, and then,\r\nwhatever I might do for her, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make her well-off. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nputting yourself in the way of her welfare; and though I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to\r\nhurt you after what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done, and what I\xe2\x80\x99ve left undone, I feel now\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s my duty to insist on taking care of my own daughter. I want to do\r\nmy duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to say whether it were Silas or Eppie that was\r\nmore deeply stirred by this last speech of Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s. Thought had been\r\nvery busy in Eppie as she listened to the contest between her old\r\nlong-loved father and this new unfamiliar father who had suddenly come\r\nto fill the place of that black featureless shadow which had held the\r\nring and placed it on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s finger. Her imagination had darted\r\nbackward in conjectures, and forward in previsions, of what this\r\nrevealed fatherhood implied; and there were words in Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\nspeech which helped to make the previsions especially definite. Not\r\nthat these thoughts, either of past or future, determined her\r\nresolution\xe2\x80\x94_that_ was determined by the feelings which vibrated to\r\nevery word Silas had uttered; but they raised, even apart from these\r\nfeelings, a repulsion towards the offered lot and the newly-revealed\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nSilas, on the other hand, was again stricken in conscience, and alarmed\r\nlest Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s accusation should be true\xe2\x80\x94lest he should be raising his\r\nown will as an obstacle to Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s good. For many moments he was mute,\r\nstruggling for the self-conquest necessary to the uttering of the\r\ndifficult words. They came out tremulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say no more. Let it be as you will. Speak to the child. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhinder nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Nancy, with all the acute sensibility of her own affections,\r\nshared her husband\xe2\x80\x99s view, that Marner was not justifiable in his wish\r\nto retain Eppie, after her real father had avowed himself. She felt\r\nthat it was a very hard trial for the poor weaver, but her code allowed\r\nno question that a father by blood must have a claim above that of any\r\nfoster-father. Besides, Nancy, used all her life to plenteous\r\ncircumstances and the privileges of \xe2\x80\x9crespectability\xe2\x80\x9d, could not enter\r\ninto the pleasures which early nurture and habit connect with all the\r\nlittle aims and efforts of the poor who are born poor: to her mind,\r\nEppie, in being restored to her birthright, was entering on a too long\r\nwithheld but unquestionable good. Hence she heard Silas\xe2\x80\x99s last words\r\nwith relief, and thought, as Godfrey did, that their wish was achieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEppie, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, looking at his daughter, not without\r\nsome embarrassment, under the sense that she was old enough to judge\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll always be our wish that you should show your love and\r\ngratitude to one who\xe2\x80\x99s been a father to you so many years, and we shall\r\nwant to help you to make him comfortable in every way. But we hope\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll come to love us as well; and though I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been what a father\r\nshould ha\xe2\x80\x99 been to you all these years, I wish to do the utmost in my\r\npower for you for the rest of my life, and provide for you as my only\r\nchild. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the best of mothers in my wife\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99ll be a\r\nblessing you haven\xe2\x80\x99t known since you were old enough to know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a treasure to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, in her gentle voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall want for nothing when we have our daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEppie did not come forward and curtsy, as she had done before. She held\r\nSilas\xe2\x80\x99s hand in hers, and grasped it firmly\xe2\x80\x94it was a weaver\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nwith a palm and finger-tips that were sensitive to such pressure\xe2\x80\x94while\r\nshe spoke with colder decision than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94thank you, sir, for your offers\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re very great,\r\nand far above my wish. For I should have no delight i\xe2\x80\x99 life any more if\r\nI was forced to go away from my father, and knew he was sitting at\r\nhome, a-thinking of me and feeling lone. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been used to be happy\r\ntogether every day, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t think o\xe2\x80\x99 no happiness without him. And\r\nhe says he\xe2\x80\x99d nobody i\xe2\x80\x99 the world till I was sent to him, and he\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nnothing when I was gone. And he\xe2\x80\x99s took care of me and loved me from the\r\nfirst, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll cleave to him as long as he lives, and nobody shall\r\never come between him and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must make sure, Eppie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, in a low voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou must\r\nmake sure as you won\xe2\x80\x99t ever be sorry, because you\xe2\x80\x99ve made your choice\r\nto stay among poor folks, and with poor clothes and things, when you\r\nmight ha\xe2\x80\x99 had everything o\xe2\x80\x99 the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sensitiveness on this point had increased as he listened to Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords of faithful affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can never be sorry, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie. \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to\r\nthink on or to wish for with fine things about me, as I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nused to. And it \xe2\x80\x99ud be poor work for me to put on things, and ride in a\r\ngig, and sit in a place at church, as \xe2\x80\x99ud make them as I\xe2\x80\x99m fond of\r\nthink me unfitting company for \xe2\x80\x99em. What could _I_ care for then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNancy looked at Godfrey with a pained questioning glance. But his eyes\r\nwere fixed on the floor, where he was moving the end of his stick, as\r\nif he were pondering on something absently. She thought there was a\r\nword which might perhaps come better from her lips than from his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say is natural, my dear child\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s natural you should cling\r\nto those who\xe2\x80\x99ve brought you up,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, mildly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s a duty\r\nyou owe to your lawful father. There\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps something to be given up\r\non more sides than one. When your father opens his home to you, I think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s right you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t turn your back on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t feel as I\xe2\x80\x99ve got any father but one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, impetuously,\r\nwhile the tears gathered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought of a little home where\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d sit i\xe2\x80\x99 the corner, and I should fend and do everything for him: I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t think o\xe2\x80\x99 no other home. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t brought up to be a lady, and I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t turn my mind to it. I like the working-folks, and their victuals,\r\nand their ways. And,\xe2\x80\x9d she ended passionately, while the tears fell,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m promised to marry a working-man, as\xe2\x80\x99ll live with father, and help\r\nme to take care of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGodfrey looked up at Nancy with a flushed face and smarting dilated\r\neyes. This frustration of a purpose towards which he had set out under\r\nthe exalted consciousness that he was about to compensate in some\r\ndegree for the greatest demerit of his life, made him feel the air of\r\nthe room stifling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in an under-tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t talk of this any longer now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, rising. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re your\r\nwell-wishers, my dear\xe2\x80\x94and yours too, Marner. We shall come and see you\r\nagain. It\xe2\x80\x99s getting late now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this way she covered her husband\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt departure, for Godfrey had\r\ngone straight to the door, unable to say more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nNancy and Godfrey walked home under the starlight in silence. When they\r\nentered the oaken parlour, Godfrey threw himself into his chair, while\r\nNancy laid down her bonnet and shawl, and stood on the hearth near her\r\nhusband, unwilling to leave him even for a few minutes, and yet fearing\r\nto utter any word lest it might jar on his feeling. At last Godfrey\r\nturned his head towards her, and their eyes met, dwelling in that\r\nmeeting without any movement on either side. That quiet mutual gaze of\r\na trusting husband and wife is like the first moment of rest or refuge\r\nfrom a great weariness or a great danger\xe2\x80\x94not to be interfered with by\r\nspeech or action which would distract the sensations from the fresh\r\nenjoyment of repose.\r\n\r\nBut presently he put out his hand, and as Nancy placed hers within it,\r\nhe drew her towards him, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s ended!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bent to kiss him, and then said, as she stood by his side, \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we must give up the hope of having her for a daughter. It\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be right to want to force her to come to us against her will.\r\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t alter her bringing up and what\xe2\x80\x99s come of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Godfrey, with a keen decisiveness of tone, in contrast with\r\nhis usually careless and unemphatic speech\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s debts we can\xe2\x80\x99t pay\r\nlike money debts, by paying extra for the years that have slipped by.\r\nWhile I\xe2\x80\x99ve been putting off and putting off, the trees have been\r\ngrowing\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s too late now. Marner was in the right in what he said\r\nabout a man\xe2\x80\x99s turning away a blessing from his door: it falls to\r\nsomebody else. I wanted to pass for childless once, Nancy\xe2\x80\x94I shall pass\r\nfor childless now against my wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNancy did not speak immediately, but after a little while she\r\nasked\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t make it known, then, about Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s being your\r\ndaughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo: where would be the good to anybody?\xe2\x80\x94only harm. I must do what I\r\ncan for her in the state of life she chooses. I must see who it is\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of marrying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it won\xe2\x80\x99t do any good to make the thing known,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, who\r\nthought she might now allow herself the relief of entertaining a\r\nfeeling which she had tried to silence before, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be very\r\nthankful for father and Priscilla never to be troubled with knowing\r\nwhat was done in the past, more than about Dunsey: it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\r\ntheir knowing that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall put it in my will\xe2\x80\x94I think I shall put it in my will. I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to leave anything to be found out, like this of Dunsey,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Godfrey, meditatively. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t see anything but difficulties\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x99ud come from telling it now. I must do what I can to make her\r\nhappy in her own way. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a notion,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s Aaron Winthrop she meant she was engaged to. I remember seeing\r\nhim with her and Marner going away from church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s very sober and industrious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, trying to view the\r\nmatter as cheerfully as possible.\r\n\r\nGodfrey fell into thoughtfulness again. Presently he looked up at Nancy\r\nsorrowfully, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a very pretty, nice girl, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she, Nancy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear; and with just your hair and eyes: I wondered it had never\r\nstruck me before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she took a dislike to me at the thought of my being her\r\nfather: I could see a change in her manner after that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to think of not looking on Marner as her father,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Nancy, not wishing to confirm her husband\xe2\x80\x99s painful impression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe thinks I did wrong by her mother as well as by her. She thinks me\r\nworse than I am. But she _must_ think it: she can never know all. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart of my punishment, Nancy, for my daughter to dislike me. I should\r\nnever have got into that trouble if I\xe2\x80\x99d been true to you\xe2\x80\x94if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen a fool. I\xe2\x80\x99d no right to expect anything but evil could come of\r\nthat marriage\xe2\x80\x94and when I shirked doing a father\xe2\x80\x99s part too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNancy was silent: her spirit of rectitude would not let her try to\r\nsoften the edge of what she felt to be a just compunction. He spoke\r\nagain after a little while, but the tone was rather changed: there was\r\ntenderness mingled with the previous self-reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I got _you_, Nancy, in spite of all; and yet I\xe2\x80\x99ve been grumbling\r\nand uneasy because I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t something else\xe2\x80\x94as if I deserved it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never been wanting to me, Godfrey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, with quiet\r\nsincerity. \xe2\x80\x9cMy only trouble would be gone if you resigned yourself to\r\nthe lot that\xe2\x80\x99s been given us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too late to mend a bit there. Though it _is_\r\ntoo late to mend some things, say what they will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when Silas and Eppie were seated at their breakfast,\r\nhe said to her\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEppie, there\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve had on my mind to do this two year, and\r\nnow the money\xe2\x80\x99s been brought back to us, we can do it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nturning it over and over in the night, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll set out\r\nto-morrow, while the fine days last. We\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the house and\r\neverything for your godmother to take care on, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make a little\r\nbundle o\xe2\x80\x99 things and set out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to go, daddy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, in much surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my old country\xe2\x80\x94to the town where I was born\xe2\x80\x94up Lantern Yard. I want\r\nto see Mr. Paston, the minister: something may ha\xe2\x80\x99 come out to make \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nknow I was innicent o\xe2\x80\x99 the robbery. And Mr. Paston was a man with a\r\ndeal o\xe2\x80\x99 light\xe2\x80\x94I want to speak to him about the drawing o\xe2\x80\x99 the lots. And\r\nI should like to talk to him about the religion o\xe2\x80\x99 this country-side,\r\nfor I partly think he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEppie was very joyful, for there was the prospect not only of wonder\r\nand delight at seeing a strange country, but also of coming back to\r\ntell Aaron all about it. Aaron was so much wiser than she was about\r\nmost things\xe2\x80\x94it would be rather pleasant to have this little advantage\r\nover him. Mrs. Winthrop, though possessed with a dim fear of dangers\r\nattendant on so long a journey, and requiring many assurances that it\r\nwould not take them out of the region of carriers\xe2\x80\x99 carts and slow\r\nwaggons, was nevertheless well pleased that Silas should revisit his\r\nown country, and find out if he had been cleared from that false\r\naccusation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d be easier in your mind for the rest o\xe2\x80\x99 your life, Master\r\nMarner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat you would. And if there\xe2\x80\x99s any light to be got\r\nup the yard as you talk on, we\xe2\x80\x99ve need of it i\xe2\x80\x99 this world, and I\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nglad on it myself, if you could bring it back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo on the fourth day from that time, Silas and Eppie, in their Sunday\r\nclothes, with a small bundle tied in a blue linen handkerchief, were\r\nmaking their way through the streets of a great manufacturing town.\r\nSilas, bewildered by the changes thirty years had brought over his\r\nnative place, had stopped several persons in succession to ask them the\r\nname of this town, that he might be sure he was not under a mistake\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk for Lantern Yard, father\xe2\x80\x94ask this gentleman with the tassels on\r\nhis shoulders a-standing at the shop door; he isn\xe2\x80\x99t in a hurry like the\r\nrest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, in some distress at her father\xe2\x80\x99s bewilderment, and\r\nill at ease, besides, amidst the noise, the movement, and the multitude\r\nof strange indifferent faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, my child, he won\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgentlefolks didn\xe2\x80\x99t ever go up the Yard. But happen somebody can tell\r\nme which is the way to Prison Street, where the jail is. I know the way\r\nout o\xe2\x80\x99 that as if I\xe2\x80\x99d seen it yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty, after many turnings and new inquiries, they\r\nreached Prison Street; and the grim walls of the jail, the first object\r\nthat answered to any image in Silas\xe2\x80\x99s memory, cheered him with the\r\ncertitude, which no assurance of the town\xe2\x80\x99s name had hitherto given\r\nhim, that he was in his native place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, drawing a long breath, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s the jail, Eppie; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust the same: I aren\xe2\x80\x99t afraid now. It\xe2\x80\x99s the third turning on the left\r\nhand from the jail doors\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the way we must go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a dark ugly place!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie. \xe2\x80\x9cHow it hides the sky! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworse than the Workhouse. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you don\xe2\x80\x99t live in this town now,\r\nfather. Is Lantern Yard like this street?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy precious child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\xe2\x80\x99t a big street like\r\nthis. I never was easy i\xe2\x80\x99 this street myself, but I was fond o\xe2\x80\x99 Lantern\r\nYard. The shops here are all altered, I think\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t make \xe2\x80\x99em out; but\r\nI shall know the turning, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the third.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a tone of satisfaction, as they came to a\r\nnarrow alley. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then we must go to the left again, and then straight\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x99ard for a bit, up Shoe Lane: and then we shall be at the entry next\r\nto the o\xe2\x80\x99erhanging window, where there\xe2\x80\x99s the nick in the road for the\r\nwater to run. Eh, I can see it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO father, I\xe2\x80\x99m like as if I was stifled,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthought as any folks lived i\xe2\x80\x99 this way, so close together. How pretty\r\nthe Stone-pits \xe2\x80\x99ull look when we get back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks comical to _me_, child, now\xe2\x80\x94and smells bad. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think as\r\nit usened to smell so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere and there a sallow, begrimed face looked out from a gloomy doorway\r\nat the strangers, and increased Eppie\xe2\x80\x99s uneasiness, so that it was a\r\nlonged-for relief when they issued from the alleys into Shoe Lane,\r\nwhere there was a broader strip of sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear heart!\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s people coming out o\xe2\x80\x99 the Yard\r\nas if they\xe2\x80\x99d been to chapel at this time o\xe2\x80\x99 day\xe2\x80\x94a weekday noon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly he started and stood still with a look of distressed\r\namazement, that alarmed Eppie. They were before an opening in front of\r\na large factory, from which men and women were streaming for their\r\nmidday meal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, clasping his arm, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she had to speak again and again before Silas could answer her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gone, child,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, at last, in strong agitation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLantern\r\nYard\xe2\x80\x99s gone. It must ha\xe2\x80\x99 been here, because here\xe2\x80\x99s the house with the\r\no\xe2\x80\x99erhanging window\xe2\x80\x94I know that\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s just the same; but they\xe2\x80\x99ve made\r\nthis new opening; and see that big factory! It\xe2\x80\x99s all gone\xe2\x80\x94chapel and\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome into that little brush-shop and sit down, father\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ll let you\r\nsit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, always on the watch lest one of her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrange attacks should come on. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the people can tell you all\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut neither from the brush-maker, who had come to Shoe Lane only ten\r\nyears ago, when the factory was already built, nor from any other\r\nsource within his reach, could Silas learn anything of the old Lantern\r\nYard friends, or of Mr. Paston the minister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old place is all swep\xe2\x80\x99 away,\xe2\x80\x9d Silas said to Dolly Winthrop on the\r\nnight of his return\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe little graveyard and everything. The old\r\nhome\xe2\x80\x99s gone; I\xe2\x80\x99ve no home but this now. I shall never know whether they\r\ngot at the truth o\xe2\x80\x99 the robbery, nor whether Mr. Paston could ha\xe2\x80\x99 given\r\nme any light about the drawing o\xe2\x80\x99 the lots. It\xe2\x80\x99s dark to me, Mrs.\r\nWinthrop, that is; I doubt it\xe2\x80\x99ll be dark to the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly, who sat with a placid listening\r\nface, now bordered by grey hairs; \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it may. It\xe2\x80\x99s the will o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThem above as a many things should be dark to us; but there\xe2\x80\x99s some\r\nthings as I\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt i\xe2\x80\x99 the dark about, and they\xe2\x80\x99re mostly what\r\ncomes i\xe2\x80\x99 the day\xe2\x80\x99s work. You were hard done by that once, Master\r\nMarner, and it seems as you\xe2\x80\x99ll never know the rights of it; but that\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t hinder there _being_ a rights, Master Marner, for all it\xe2\x80\x99s dark\r\nto you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, \xe2\x80\x9cno; that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hinder. Since the time the child\r\nwas sent to me and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to love her as myself, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had light\r\nenough to trusten by; and now she says she\xe2\x80\x99ll never leave me, I think I\r\nshall trusten till I die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThere was one time of the year which was held in Raveloe to be\r\nespecially suitable for a wedding. It was when the great lilacs and\r\nlaburnums in the old-fashioned gardens showed their golden and purple\r\nwealth above the lichen-tinted walls, and when there were calves still\r\nyoung enough to want bucketfuls of fragrant milk. People were not so\r\nbusy then as they must become when the full cheese-making and the\r\nmowing had set in; and besides, it was a time when a light bridal dress\r\ncould be worn with comfort and seen to advantage.\r\n\r\nHappily the sunshine fell more warmly than usual on the lilac tufts the\r\nmorning that Eppie was married, for her dress was a very light one. She\r\nhad often thought, though with a feeling of renunciation, that the\r\nperfection of a wedding-dress would be a white cotton, with the tiniest\r\npink sprig at wide intervals; so that when Mrs. Godfrey Cass begged to\r\nprovide one, and asked Eppie to choose what it should be, previous\r\nmeditation had enabled her to give a decided answer at once.\r\n\r\nSeen at a little distance as she walked across the churchyard and down\r\nthe village, she seemed to be attired in pure white, and her hair\r\nlooked like the dash of gold on a lily. One hand was on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm, and with the other she clasped the hand of her father Silas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be giving me away, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she had said before they went to\r\nchurch; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll only be taking Aaron to be a son to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDolly Winthrop walked behind with her husband; and there ended the\r\nlittle bridal procession.\r\n\r\nThere were many eyes to look at it, and Miss Priscilla Lammeter was\r\nglad that she and her father had happened to drive up to the door of\r\nthe Red House just in time to see this pretty sight. They had come to\r\nkeep Nancy company to-day, because Mr. Cass had had to go away to\r\nLytherley, for special reasons. That seemed to be a pity, for otherwise\r\nhe might have gone, as Mr. Crackenthorp and Mr. Osgood certainly would,\r\nto look on at the wedding-feast which he had ordered at the Rainbow,\r\nnaturally feeling a great interest in the weaver who had been wronged\r\nby one of his own family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could ha\xe2\x80\x99 wished Nancy had had the luck to find a child like that\r\nand bring her up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Priscilla to her father, as they sat in the\r\ngig; \xe2\x80\x9cI should ha\xe2\x80\x99 had something young to think of then, besides the\r\nlambs and the calves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Lammeter; \xe2\x80\x9cone feels that as one gets\r\nolder. Things look dim to old folks: they\xe2\x80\x99d need have some young eyes\r\nabout \xe2\x80\x99em, to let \xe2\x80\x99em know the world\xe2\x80\x99s the same as it used to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNancy came out now to welcome her father and sister; and the wedding\r\ngroup had passed on beyond the Red House to the humbler part of the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nDolly Winthrop was the first to divine that old Mr. Macey, who had been\r\nset in his arm-chair outside his own door, would expect some special\r\nnotice as they passed, since he was too old to be at the wedding-feast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Macey\xe2\x80\x99s looking for a word from us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolly; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll be hurt if\r\nwe pass him and say nothing\xe2\x80\x94and him so racked with rheumatiz.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they turned aside to shake hands with the old man. He had looked\r\nforward to the occasion, and had his premeditated speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Master Marner,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a voice that quavered a good deal,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lived to see my words come true. I was the first to say there was\r\nno harm in you, though your looks might be again\xe2\x80\x99 you; and I was the\r\nfirst to say you\xe2\x80\x99d get your money back. And it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but rightful\r\nas you should. And I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 said the \xe2\x80\x9cAmens\xe2\x80\x9d, and willing, at the holy\r\nmatrimony; but Tookey\xe2\x80\x99s done it a good while now, and I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave none the worse luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the open yard before the Rainbow the party of guests were already\r\nassembled, though it was still nearly an hour before the appointed\r\nfeast time. But by this means they could not only enjoy the slow advent\r\nof their pleasure; they had also ample leisure to talk of Silas\r\nMarner\xe2\x80\x99s strange history, and arrive by due degrees at the conclusion\r\nthat he had brought a blessing on himself by acting like a father to a\r\nlone motherless child. Even the farrier did not negative this\r\nsentiment: on the contrary, he took it up as peculiarly his own, and\r\ninvited any hardy person present to contradict him. But he met with no\r\ncontradiction; and all differences among the company were merged in a\r\ngeneral agreement with Mr. Snell\xe2\x80\x99s sentiment, that when a man had\r\ndeserved his good luck, it was the part of his neighbours to wish him\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nAs the bridal group approached, a hearty cheer was raised in the\r\nRainbow yard; and Ben Winthrop, whose jokes had retained their\r\nacceptable flavour, found it agreeable to turn in there and receive\r\ncongratulations; not requiring the proposed interval of quiet at the\r\nStone-pits before joining the company.\r\n\r\nEppie had a larger garden than she had ever expected there now; and in\r\nother ways there had been alterations at the expense of Mr. Cass, the\r\nlandlord, to suit Silas\xe2\x80\x99s larger family. For he and Eppie had declared\r\nthat they would rather stay at the Stone-pits than go to any new home.\r\nThe garden was fenced with stones on two sides, but in front there was\r\nan open fence, through which the flowers shone with answering gladness,\r\nas the four united people came within sight of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eppie, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a pretty home ours is! I think nobody\r\ncould be happier than we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Silas Marner, by George Eliot\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SILAS MARNER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 550-0.txt or 550-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/5/550/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
