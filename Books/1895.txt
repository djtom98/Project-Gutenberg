THE TRAVELERS.\r\n\r\nIt was the opening of the season of eighteen hundred and thirty-two, at\r\nthe Baths of Wildbad.\r\n\r\nThe evening shadows were beginning to gather over the quiet little\r\nGerman town, and the diligence was expected every minute. Before the\r\ndoor of the principal inn, waiting the arrival of the first visitors\r\nof the year, were assembled the three notable personages of Wildbad,\r\naccompanied by their wives--the mayor, representing the inhabitants;\r\nthe doctor, representing the waters; the landlord, representing his own\r\nestablishment. Beyond this select circle, grouped snugly about the trim\r\nlittle square in front of the inn, appeared the towns-people in general,\r\nmixed here and there with the country people, in their quaint German\r\ncostume, placidly expectant of the diligence--the men in short black\r\njackets, tight black breeches, and three-cornered beaver hats; the women\r\nwith their long light hair hanging in one thickly plaited tail behind\r\nthem, and the waists of their short woolen gowns inserted modestly\r\nin the region of their shoulder-blades. Round the outer edge of the\r\nassemblage thus formed, flying detachments of plump white-headed\r\nchildren careered in perpetual motion; while, mysteriously apart from\r\nthe rest of the inhabitants, the musicians of the Baths stood collected\r\nin one lost corner, waiting the appearance of the first visitors to play\r\nthe first tune of the season in the form of a serenade. The light of\r\na May evening was still bright on the tops of the great wooded hills\r\nwatching high over the town on the right hand and the left; and the\r\ncool breeze that comes before sunset came keenly fragrant here with the\r\nbalsamic odor of the first of the Black Forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Landlord,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s wife (giving the landlord his title),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chave you any foreign guests coming on this first day of the season?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Mayoress,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the landlord (returning the compliment), \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave two. They have written--the one by the hand of his servant, the\r\nother by his own hand apparently--to order their rooms; and they\r\nare from England, both, as I think by their names. If you ask me to\r\npronounce those names, my tongue hesitates; if you ask me to spell them,\r\nhere they are, letter by letter, first and second in their order as\r\nthey come. First, a high-born stranger (by title Mister) who introduces\r\nhimself in eight letters, A, r, m, a, d, a, l, e--and comes ill in his\r\nown carriage. Second, a high-born stranger (by title Mister also), who\r\nintroduces himself in four letters--N, e, a, l--and comes ill in the\r\ndiligence. His excellency of the eight letters writes to me (by his\r\nservant) in French; his excellency of the four letters writes to me in\r\nGerman. The rooms of both are ready. I know no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s wife, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Doctor has heard from one or\r\nboth of these illustrious strangers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom one only, Madam Mayoress; but not, strictly speaking, from the\r\nperson himself. I have received a medical report of his excellency of\r\nthe eight letters, and his case seems a bad one. God help him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe diligence!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a child from the outskirts of the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe musicians seized their instruments, and silence fell on the whole\r\ncommunity. From far away in the windings of the forest gorge, the ring\r\nof horses\xe2\x80\x99 bells came faintly clear through the evening stillness. Which\r\ncarriage was approaching--the private carriage with Mr. Armadale, or the\r\npublic carriage with Mr. Neal?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlay, my friends!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the mayor to the musicians. \xe2\x80\x9cPublic or\r\nprivate, here are the first sick people of the season. Let them find us\r\ncheerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe band played a lively dance tune, and the children in the square\r\nfooted it merrily to the music. At the same moment, their elders near\r\nthe inn door drew aside, and disclosed the first shadow of gloom that\r\nfell over the gayety and beauty of the scene. Through the opening made\r\non either hand, a little procession of stout country girls advanced,\r\neach drawing after her an empty chair on wheels; each in waiting (and\r\nknitting while she waited) for the paralyzed wretches who came helpless\r\nby hundreds then--who come helpless by thousands now--to the waters of\r\nWildbad for relief.\r\n\r\nWhile the band played, while the children danced, while the buzz of many\r\ntalkers deepened, while the strong young nurses of the coming cripples\r\nknitted impenetrably, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s insatiable curiosity about other women\r\nasserted itself in the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s wife. She drew the landlady aside, and\r\nwhispered a question to her on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA word more, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s wife, \xe2\x80\x9cabout the two strangers\r\nfrom England. Are their letters explicit? Have they got any ladies with\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one by the diligence--no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the landlady. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the one by\r\nthe private carriage--yes. He comes with a child; he comes with a nurse;\r\nand,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the landlady, skillfully keeping the main point of\r\ninterest till the last, \xe2\x80\x9che comes with a Wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayoress brightened; the doctoress (assisting at the conference)\r\nbrightened; the landlady nodded significantly. In the minds of all three\r\nthe same thought started into life at the same moment--\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see the\r\nFashions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a minute more, there was a sudden movement in the crowd; and a chorus\r\nof voices proclaimed that the travelers were at hand.\r\n\r\nBy this time the coming vehicle was in sight, and all further doubt was\r\nat an end. It was the diligence that now approached by the long street\r\nleading into the square--the diligence (in a dazzling new coat of yellow\r\npaint) that delivered the first visitors of the season at the inn door.\r\nOf the ten travelers released from the middle compartment and the back\r\ncompartment of the carriage--all from various parts of Germany--three\r\nwere lifted out helpless, and were placed in the chairs on wheels to be\r\ndrawn to their lodgings in the town. The front compartment contained\r\ntwo passengers only--Mr. Neal and his traveling servant. With an arm\r\non either side to assist him, the stranger (whose malady appeared to\r\nbe locally confined to a lameness in one of his feet) succeeded in\r\ndescending the steps of the carriage easily enough. While he steadied\r\nhimself on the pavement by the help of his stick--looking not\r\nover-patiently toward the musicians who were serenading him with the\r\nwaltz in \xe2\x80\x9cDer Freischutz\xe2\x80\x9d--his personal appearance rather damped the\r\nenthusiasm of the friendly little circle assembled to welcome him. He\r\nwas a lean, tall, serious, middle-aged man, with a cold gray eye and a\r\nlong upper lip, with overhanging eyebrows and high cheek-bones; a man\r\nwho looked what he was--every inch a Scotchman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the proprietor of this hotel?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, speaking in the\r\nGerman language, with a fluent readiness of expression, and an icy\r\ncoldness of manner. \xe2\x80\x9cFetch the doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, when the landlord\r\nhad presented himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see him immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here already, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, advancing from the circle of\r\nfriends, \xe2\x80\x9cand my services are entirely at your disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Neal, looking at the doctor, as the rest of us\r\nlook at a dog when we have whistled and the dog has come. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be\r\nglad to consult you to-morrow morning, at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, about my own\r\ncase. I only want to trouble you now with a message which I have\r\nundertaken to deliver. We overtook a traveling carriage on the road here\r\nwith a gentleman in it--an Englishman, I believe--who appeared to be\r\nseriously ill. A lady who was with him begged me to see you immediately\r\non my arrival, and to secure your professional assistance in removing\r\nthe patient from the carriage. Their courier has met with an accident,\r\nand has been left behind on the road, and they are obliged to travel\r\nvery slowly. If you are here in an hour, you will be here in time to\r\nreceive them. That is the message. Who is this gentleman who appears to\r\nbe anxious to speak to me? The mayor? If you wish to see my passport,\r\nsir, my servant will show it to you. No? You wish to welcome me to the\r\nplace, and to offer your services? I am infinitely flattered. If you\r\nhave any authority to shorten the performances of your town band, you\r\nwould be doing me a kindness to exert it. My nerves are irritable, and\r\nI dislike music. Where is the landlord? No; I want to see my rooms. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want your arm; I can get upstairs with the help of my stick. Mr.\r\nMayor and Mr. Doctor, we need not detain one another any longer. I wish\r\nyou good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth mayor and doctor looked after the Scotchman as he limped upstairs,\r\nand shook their heads together in mute disapproval of him. The ladies,\r\nas usual, went a step further, and expressed their opinions openly in\r\nthe plainest words. The case under consideration (so far as _they_ were\r\nconcerned) was the scandalous case of a man who had passed them over\r\nentirely without notice. Mrs. Mayor could only attribute such an outrage\r\nto the native ferocity of a savage. Mrs. Doctor took a stronger view\r\nstill, and considered it as proceeding from the inbred brutality of a\r\nhog.\r\n\r\nThe hour of waiting for the traveling-carriage wore on, and the creeping\r\nnight stole up the hillsides softly. One by one the stars appeared, and\r\nthe first lights twinkled in the windows of the inn. As the darkness\r\ncame, the last idlers deserted the square; as the darkness came,\r\nthe mighty silence of the forest above flowed in on the valley, and\r\nstrangely and suddenly hushed the lonely little town.\r\n\r\nThe hour of waiting wore out, and the figure of the doctor, walking\r\nbackward and forward anxiously, was still the only living figure left in\r\nthe square. Five minutes, ten minutes, twenty minutes, were counted out\r\nby the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s watch, before the first sound came through the night\r\nsilence to warn him of the approaching carriage. Slowly it emerged into\r\nthe square, at the walking pace of the horses, and drew up, as a hearse\r\nmight have drawn up, at the door of the inn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the doctor here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice, speaking, out of the\r\ndarkness of the carriage, in the French language.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, taking a light from the\r\nlandlord\xe2\x80\x99s hand and opening the carriage door.\r\n\r\nThe first face that the light fell on was the face of the lady who had\r\njust spoken--a young, darkly beautiful woman, with the tears standing\r\nthick and bright in her eager black eyes. The second face revealed was\r\nthe face of a shriveled old negress, sitting opposite the lady on the\r\nback seat. The third was the face of a little sleeping child in the\r\nnegress\xe2\x80\x99s lap. With a quick gesture of impatience, the lady signed to\r\nthe nurse to leave the carriage first with the child. \xe2\x80\x9cPray take them\r\nout of the way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the landlady; \xe2\x80\x9cpray take them to their\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d She got out herself when her request had been complied with.\r\nThen the light fell clear for the first time on the further side of the\r\ncarriage, and the fourth traveler was disclosed to view.\r\n\r\nHe lay helpless on a mattress, supported by a stretcher; his hair, long\r\nand disordered, under a black skull-cap; his eyes wide open, rolling\r\nto and fro ceaselessly anxious; the rest of his face as void of all\r\nexpression of the character within him, and the thought within him, as\r\nif he had been dead. There was no looking at him now, and guessing what\r\nhe might once have been. The leaden blank of his face met every question\r\nas to his age, his rank, his temper, and his looks which that face might\r\nonce have answered, in impenetrable silence. Nothing spoke for him now\r\nbut the shock that had struck him with the death-in-life of paralysis.\r\nThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s eye questioned his lower limbs, and Death-in-Life answered,\r\n_I am here_. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s eye, rising attentively by way of his hands\r\nand arms, questioned upward and upward to the muscles round his mouth,\r\nand Death-in-Life answered, _I am coming_.\r\n\r\nIn the face of a calamity so unsparing and so dreadful, there was\r\nnothing to be said. The silent sympathy of help was all that could be\r\noffered to the woman who stood weeping at the carriage door.\r\n\r\nAs they bore him on his bed across the hall of the hotel, his wandering\r\neyes encountered the face of his wife. They rested on her for a moment,\r\nand in that moment he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in English, with a slow, thick, laboring\r\narticulation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child is safe upstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy desk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is in my hands. Look! I won\xe2\x80\x99t trust it to anybody; I am taking care\r\nof it for you myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes for the first time after that answer, and said no\r\nmore. Tenderly and skillfully he was carried up the stairs, with his\r\nwife on one side of him, and the doctor (ominously silent) on the other.\r\nThe landlord and the servants following saw the door of his room open\r\nand close on him; heard the lady burst out crying hysterically as soon\r\nas she was alone with the doctor and the sick man; saw the doctor come\r\nout, half an hour later, with his ruddy face a shade paler than usual;\r\npressed him eagerly for information, and received but one answer to all\r\ntheir inquiries--\xe2\x80\x9cWait till I have seen him to-morrow. Ask me nothing\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d They all knew the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s ways, and they augured ill when he\r\nleft them hurriedly with that reply.\r\n\r\nSo the two first English visitors of the year came to the Baths of\r\nWildbad in the season of eighteen hundred and thirty-two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SOLID SIDE OF THE SCOTCH CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nAT ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning, Mr. Neal--waiting for the medical visit\r\nwhich he had himself appointed for that hour--looked at his watch, and\r\ndiscovered, to his amazement, that he was waiting in vain. It was close\r\non eleven when the door opened at last, and the doctor entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI appointed ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock for your visit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Neal. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my country,\r\na medical man is a punctual man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my country,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the doctor, without the least ill-humor, \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nmedical man is exactly like other men--he is at the mercy of accidents.\r\nPray grant me your pardon, sir, for being so long after my time; I have\r\nbeen detained by a very distressing case--the case of Mr. Armadale,\r\nwhose traveling-carriage you passed on the road yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Neal looked at his medical attendant with a sour surprise. There\r\nwas a latent anxiety in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s eye, a latent preoccupation in the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s manner, which he was at a loss to account for. For a moment\r\nthe two faces confronted each other silently, in marked national\r\ncontrast--the Scotchman\xe2\x80\x99s, long and lean, hard and regular; the\r\nGerman\xe2\x80\x99s, plump and florid, soft and shapeless. One face looked as if it\r\nhad never been young; the other, as if it would never grow old.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight I venture to remind you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Neal, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the case now under\r\nconsideration is MY case, and not Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, still vacillating between the case\r\nhe had come to see and the case he had just left. \xe2\x80\x9cYou appear to be\r\nsuffering from lameness; let me look at your foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Neal\xe2\x80\x99s malady, however serious it might be in his own estimation,\r\nwas of no extraordinary importance in a medical point of view. He was\r\nsuffering from a rheumatic affection of the ankle-joint. The necessary\r\nquestions were asked and answered and the necessary baths were\r\nprescribed. In ten minutes the consultation was at an end, and the\r\npatient was waiting in significant silence for the medical adviser to\r\ntake his leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot conceal from myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, rising, and hesitating\r\na little, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am intruding on you. But I am compelled to beg your\r\nindulgence if I return to the subject of Mr. Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask what compels you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe duty which I owe as a Christian,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cto a dying\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Neal started. Those who touched his sense of religious duty touched\r\nthe quickest sense in his nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have established your claim on my attention,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ntime is yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not abuse your kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, resuming his\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x9cI will be as short as I can. Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s case is briefly\r\nthis: He has passed the greater part of his life in the West Indies--a\r\nwild life, and a vicious life, by his own confession. Shortly after\r\nhis marriage--now some three years since--the first symptoms of an\r\napproaching paralytic affection began to show themselves, and his\r\nmedical advisers ordered him away to try the climate of Europe. Since\r\nleaving the West Indies he has lived principally in Italy, with no\r\nbenefit to his health. From Italy, before the last seizure attacked him,\r\nhe removed to Switzerland, and from Switzerland he has been sent to this\r\nplace. So much I know from his doctor\xe2\x80\x99s report; the rest I can tell you\r\nfrom my own personal experience. Mr. Armadale has been sent to Wildbad\r\ntoo late: he is virtually a dead man. The paralysis is fast spreading\r\nupward, and disease of the lower part of the spine has already taken\r\nplace. He can still move his hands a little, but he can hold nothing\r\nin his fingers. He can still articulate, but he may wake speechless\r\nto-morrow or next day. If I give him a week more to live, I give him\r\nwhat I honestly believe to be the utmost length of his span. At his own\r\nrequest I told him, as carefully and as tenderly as I could, what I\r\nhave just told you. The result was very distressing; the violence of the\r\npatient\xe2\x80\x99s agitation was a violence which I despair of describing to you.\r\nI took the liberty of asking him whether his affairs were unsettled.\r\nNothing of the sort. His will is in the hands of his executor in London,\r\nand he leaves his wife and child well provided for. My next question\r\nsucceeded better; it hit the mark: \xe2\x80\x98Have you something on your mind\r\nto do before you die which is not done yet?\xe2\x80\x99 He gave a great gasp of\r\nrelief, which said, as no words could have said it, Yes. \xe2\x80\x98Can I help\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes. I have something to write that I _must_ write; can you make\r\nme hold a pen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might as well have asked me if I could perform a miracle. I could\r\nonly say No. \xe2\x80\x98If I dictate the words,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, \xe2\x80\x98can you write what I\r\ntell you to write?\xe2\x80\x99 Once more I could only say No I understand a\r\nlittle English, but I can neither speak it nor write it. Mr. Armadale\r\nunderstands French when it is spoken (as I speak it to him) slowly, but\r\nhe cannot express himself in that language; and of German he is totally\r\nignorant. In this difficulty, I said, what any one else in my situation\r\nwould have said: \xe2\x80\x98Why ask _me_? there is Mrs. Armadale at your service\r\nin the next room.\xe2\x80\x99 Before I could get up from my chair to fetch her,\r\nhe stopped me--not by words, but by a look of horror which fixed me, by\r\nmain force of astonishment, in my place. \xe2\x80\x98Surely,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98your wife\r\nis the fittest person to write for you as you desire?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98The last person\r\nunder heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 he answered. \xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98you ask me, a foreigner\r\nand a stranger, to write words at your dictation which you keep a secret\r\nfrom your wife!\xe2\x80\x99 Conceive my astonishment when he answered me, without\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, \xe2\x80\x98Yes!\xe2\x80\x99 I sat lost; I sat silent. \xe2\x80\x98If _you_\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t write English,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98find somebody who can.\xe2\x80\x99 I tried to\r\nremonstrate. He burst into a dreadful moaning cry--a dumb entreaty, like\r\nthe entreaty of a dog. \xe2\x80\x98Hush! hush!\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98I will find somebody.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To-day!\xe2\x80\x99 he broke out, \xe2\x80\x98before my speech fails me, like my hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To-day, in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x99 He shut his eyes; he quieted himself\r\ninstantly. \xe2\x80\x98While I am waiting for you,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98let me see my little\r\nboy.\xe2\x80\x99 He had shown no tenderness when he spoke of his wife, but I saw\r\nthe tears on his cheeks when he asked for his child. My profession, sir,\r\nhas not made me so hard a man as you might think; and my doctor\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nwas as heavy, when I went out to fetch the child, as if I had not been a\r\ndoctor at all. I am afraid you think this rather weak on my part?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked appealingly at Mr. Neal. He might as well have looked\r\nat a rock in the Black Forest. Mr. Neal entirely declined to be drawn by\r\nany doctor in Christendom out of the regions of plain fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI presume you have not told me all that you have to\r\ntell me, yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you understand my object in coming here, now?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour object is plain enough, at last. You invite me to connect myself\r\nblindfold with a matter which is in the last degree suspicious, so far.\r\nI decline giving you any answer until I know more than I know now. Did\r\nyou think it necessary to inform this man\xe2\x80\x99s wife of what had passed\r\nbetween you, and to ask her for an explanation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I thought it necessary!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, indignant at the\r\nreflection on his humanity which the question seemed to imply. \xe2\x80\x9cIf ever\r\nI saw a woman fond of her husband, and sorry for her husband, it is this\r\nunhappy Mrs. Armadale. As soon as we were left alone together, I sat\r\ndown by her side, and I took her hand in mine. Why not? I am an ugly old\r\nman, and I may allow myself such liberties as these!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the impenetrable Scotchman. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg to suggest that you\r\nare losing the thread of the narrative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more likely,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the doctor, recovering his good humor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is in the habit of my nation to be perpetually losing the thread;\r\nand it is evidently in the habit of yours, sir, to be perpetually\r\nfinding it. What an example here of the order of the universe, and the\r\neverlasting fitness of things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you oblige me, once for all, by confining yourself to the facts,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n persisted Mr. Neal, frowning impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I inquire, for my own\r\ninformation, whether Mrs. Armadale could tell you what it is her husband\r\nwishes me to write, and why it is that he refuses to let her write for\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is my thread found--and thank you for finding it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ndoctor. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear what Mrs. Armadale had to tell me, in\r\nMrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s own words. \xe2\x80\x98The cause that now shuts me out of his\r\nconfidence,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98is, I firmly believe, the same cause that has\r\nalways shut me out of his heart. I am the wife he has wedded, but I am\r\nnot the woman he loves. I knew when he married me that another man had\r\nwon from him the woman he loved. I thought I could make him forget her.\r\nI hoped when I married him; I hoped again when I bore him a son. Need\r\nI tell you the end of my hopes--you have seen it for yourself.\xe2\x80\x99 (Wait,\r\nsir, I entreat you! I have not lost the thread again; I am following it\r\ninch by inch.) \xe2\x80\x98Is this all you know?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98All I knew,\xe2\x80\x99 she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98till a short time since. It was when we were in Switzerland, and when\r\nhis illness was nearly at its worst, that news came to him by accident\r\nof that other woman who has been the shadow and the poison of my\r\nlife--news that she (like me) had borne her husband a son. On the\r\ninstant of his making that discovery--a trifling discovery, if ever\r\nthere was one yet--a mortal fear seized on him: not for me, not for\r\nhimself; a fear for his own child. The same day (without a word to me)\r\nhe sent for the doctor. I was mean, wicked, what you please--I listened\r\nat the door. I heard him say: _I have something to tell my son, when\r\nmy son grows old enough to understand me. Shall I live to tell it_? The\r\ndoctor would say nothing certain. The same night (still without a word\r\nto me) he locked himself into his room. What would any woman, treated\r\nas I was, have done in my place? She would have done as I did--she would\r\nhave listened again. I heard him say to himself: _I shall not live to\r\ntell it: I must write it before I die_. I heard his pen scrape, scrape,\r\nscrape over the paper; I heard him groaning and sobbing as he wrote;\r\nI implored him for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake to let me in. The cruel pen went scrape,\r\nscrape, scrape; the cruel pen was all the answer he gave me. I waited\r\nat the door--hours--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long. On a sudden, the pen stopped;\r\nand I heard no more. I whispered through the keyhole softly; I said I\r\nwas cold and weary with waiting; I said, Oh, my love, let me in! Not\r\neven the cruel pen answered me now: silence answered me. With all the\r\nstrength of my miserable hands I beat at the door. The servants came up\r\nand broke it in. We were too late; the harm was done. Over that fatal\r\nletter, the stroke had struck him--over that fatal letter, we found him\r\nparalyzed as you see him now. Those words which he wants you to write\r\nare the words he would have written himself if the stroke had spared him\r\ntill the morning. From that time to this there has been a blank place\r\nleft in the letter; and it is that blank place which he has just asked\r\nyou to fill up.\xe2\x80\x99--In those words Mrs. Armadale spoke to me; in those\r\nwords you have the sum and substance of all the information I can give.\r\nSay, if you please, sir, have I kept the thread at last? Have I\r\nshown you the necessity which brings me here from your countryman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath-bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus far,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Neal, \xe2\x80\x9cyou merely show me that you are exciting\r\nyourself. This is too serious a matter to be treated as you are treating\r\nit now. You have involved me in the business, and I insist on seeing my\r\nway plainly. Don\xe2\x80\x99t raise your hands; your hands are not a part of the\r\nquestion. If I am to be concerned in the completion of this mysterious\r\nletter, it is only an act of justifiable prudence on my part to inquire\r\nwhat the letter is about. Mrs. Armadale appears to have favored you with\r\nan infinite number of domestic particulars--in return, I presume, for\r\nyour polite attention in taking her by the hand. May I ask what she\r\ncould tell you about her husband\xe2\x80\x99s letter, so far as her husband has\r\nwritten it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Armadale could tell me nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, with a sudden\r\nformality in his manner, which showed that his forbearance was at last\r\nfailing him. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore she was composed enough to think of the letter, her\r\nhusband had asked for it, and had caused it to be locked up in his desk.\r\nShe knows that he has since, time after time, tried to finish it, and\r\nthat, time after time, the pen has dropped from his fingers. She knows,\r\nwhen all other hope of his restoration was at an end, that his medical\r\nadvisers encouraged him to hope in the famous waters of this place. And\r\nlast, she knows how that hope has ended; for she knows what I told her\r\nhusband this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe frown which had been gathering latterly on Mr. Neal\xe2\x80\x99s face deepened\r\nand darkened. He looked at the doctor as if the doctor had personally\r\noffended him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more I think of the position you are asking me to take,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe less I like it. Can you undertake to say positively that Mr.\r\nArmadale is in his right mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; as positively as words can say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes his wife sanction your coming here to request my interference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis wife sends me to you--the only Englishman in Wildbad--to write for\r\nyour dying countryman what he cannot write for himself; and what no one\r\nelse in this place but you can write for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat answer drove Mr. Neal back to the last inch of ground left him to\r\nstand on. Even on that inch the Scotchman resisted still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou put it strongly; let us be quite sure you\r\nput it correctly as well. Let us be quite sure there is nobody to take\r\nthis responsibility but myself. There is a mayor in Wildbad, to\r\nbegin with--a man who possesses an official character to justify his\r\ninterference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man of a thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cWith one fault--he knows no\r\nlanguage but his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an English legation at Stuttgart,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Mr. Neal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there are miles on miles of the forest between this and Stuttgart,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n rejoined the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we sent this moment, we could get no help from\r\nthe legation before to-morrow; and it is as likely as not, in the\r\nstate of this dying man\xe2\x80\x99s articulation, that to-morrow may find him\r\nspeechless. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether his last wishes are wishes harmless to\r\nhis child and to others, wishes hurtful to his child and to others; but\r\nI _do_ know that they must be fulfilled at once or never, and that you\r\nare the only man that can help him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat open declaration brought the discussion to a close. It fixed Mr.\r\nNeal fast between the two alternatives of saying Yes, and committing an\r\nact of imprudence, or of saying No, and committing an act of inhumanity.\r\nThere was a silence of some minutes. The Scotchman steadily reflected;\r\nand the German steadily watched him.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of saying the next words rested on Mr. Neal, and in\r\ncourse of time Mr. Neal took it. He rose from his chair with a sullen\r\nsense of injury lowering on his heavy eyebrows, and working sourly in\r\nthe lines at the corners of his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy position is forced on me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no choice but to accept\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s impulsive nature rose in revolt against the merciless\r\nbrevity and gracelessness of that reply. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to God,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out\r\nfervently, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew English enough to take your place at Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedside!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBating your taking the name of the Almighty in vain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nScotchman, \xe2\x80\x9cI entirely agree with you. I wish you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout another word on either side, they left the room together--the\r\ndoctor leading the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE WRECK OF THE TIMBER SHIP.\r\n\r\nNO one answered the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s knock when he and his companion reached the\r\nantechamber door of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s apartments. They entered unannounced;\r\nand when they looked into the sitting-room, the sitting-room was empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must see Mrs. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Neal. \xe2\x80\x9cI decline acting in the\r\nmatter unless Mrs. Armadale authorizes my interference with her own\r\nlips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Armadale is probably with her husband,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor.\r\nHe approached a door at the inner end of the sitting-room while he\r\nspoke--hesitated--and, turning round again, looked at his sour companion\r\nanxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I spoke a little harshly, sir, when we were\r\nleaving your room,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon for it, with all my\r\nheart. Before this poor afflicted lady comes in, will you--will you\r\nexcuse my asking your utmost gentleness and consideration for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the other harshly; \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t excuse you. What right\r\nhave I given you to think me wanting in gentleness and consideration\r\ntoward anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor saw it was useless. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nresignedly, and left the unapproachable stranger to himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Neal walked to the window, and stood there, with his eyes\r\nmechanically fixed on the prospect, composing his mind for the coming\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nIt was midday; the sun shone bright and warm; and all the little world\r\nof Wildbad was alive and merry in the genial springtime. Now and again\r\nheavy wagons, with black-faced carters in charge, rolled by the window,\r\nbearing their precious lading of charcoal from the forest. Now and\r\nagain, hurled over the headlong current of the stream that runs\r\nthrough the town, great lengths of timber, loosely strung together in\r\ninterminable series--with the booted raftsmen, pole in hand, poised\r\nwatchful at either end--shot swift and serpent-like past the houses\r\non their course to the distant Rhine. High and steep above the gabled\r\nwooden buildings on the river-bank, the great hillsides, crested black\r\nwith firs, shone to the shining heavens in a glory of lustrous green.\r\nIn and out, where the forest foot-paths wound from the grass through the\r\ntrees, from the trees over the grass, the bright spring dresses of women\r\nand children, on the search for wild flowers, traveled to and fro in\r\nthe lofty distance like spots of moving light. Below, on the walk by the\r\nstream side, the booths of the little bazar that had opened punctually\r\nwith the opening season showed all their glittering trinkets, and\r\nfluttered in the balmy air their splendor of many-colored flags.\r\nLongingly, here the children looked at the show; patiently the sunburned\r\nlasses plied their knitting as they paced the walk; courteously the\r\npassing townspeople, by fours and fives, and the passing visitors, by\r\nones and twos, greeted each other, hat in hand; and slowly, slowly,\r\nthe cripple and the helpless in their chairs on wheels came out in the\r\ncheerful noontide with the rest, and took their share of the blessed\r\nlight that cheers, of the blessed sun that shines for all.\r\n\r\nOn this scene the Scotchman looked, with eyes that never noted its\r\nbeauty, with a mind far away from every lesson that it taught. One by\r\none he meditated the words he should say when the wife came in. One by\r\none he pondered over the conditions he might impose before he took the\r\npen in hand at the husband\xe2\x80\x99s bedside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Armadale is here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s voice, interposing suddenly\r\nbetween his reflections and himself.\r\n\r\nHe turned on the instant, and saw before him, with the pure midday light\r\nshining full on her, a woman of the mixed blood of the European and the\r\nAfrican race, with the Northern delicacy in the shape of her face, and\r\nthe Southern richness in its color--a woman in the prime of her beauty,\r\nwho moved with an inbred grace, who looked with an inbred fascination,\r\nwhose large, languid black eyes rested on him gratefully, whose little\r\ndusky hand offered itself to him in mute expression of her thanks, with\r\nthe welcome that is given to the coming of a friend. For the first time\r\nin his life the Scotchman was taken by surprise. Every self-preservative\r\nword that he had been meditating but an instant since dropped out of his\r\nmemory. His thrice impenetrable armor of habitual suspicion, habitual\r\nself-discipline, and habitual reserve, which had never fallen from him\r\nin a woman\xe2\x80\x99s presence before, fell from him in this woman\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\r\nand brought him to his knees, a conquered man. He took the hand she\r\noffered him, and bowed over it his first honest homage to the sex, in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated on her side. The quick feminine perception which,\r\nin happier circumstances, would have pounced on the secret of his\r\nembarrassment in an instant, failed her now. She attributed his\r\nstrange reception of her to pride, to reluctance--to any cause but the\r\nunexpected revelation of her own beauty. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no words to thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, faintly, trying to propitiate him. \xe2\x80\x9cI should only distress you\r\nif I tried to speak.\xe2\x80\x9d Her lip began to tremble, she drew back a little,\r\nand turned away her head in silence.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who had been standing apart, quietly observant in a corner,\r\nadvanced before Mr. Neal could interfere, and led Mrs. Armadale to a\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of him,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the good man, patting her\r\ngently on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was hard as iron in my hands, but I think,\r\nby the look of him, he will be soft as wax in yours. Say the words I\r\ntold you to say, and let us take him to your husband\xe2\x80\x99s room, before\r\nthose sharp wits of his have time to recover themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe roused her sinking resolution, and advanced half-way to the window\r\nto meet Mr. Neal. \xe2\x80\x9cMy kind friend, the doctor, has told me, sir, that\r\nyour only hesitation in coming here is a hesitation on my account,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, her head drooping a little, and her rich color fading away while\r\nshe spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI am deeply grateful, but I entreat you not to think\r\nof _me_. What my husband wishes--\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice faltered; she waited\r\nresolutely, and recovered herself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat my husband wishes in his last\r\nmoments, I wish too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Mr. Neal was composed enough to answer her. In low, earnest\r\ntones, he entreated her to say no more. \xe2\x80\x9cI was only anxious to show you\r\nevery consideration,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only anxious now to spare you every\r\ndistress.\xe2\x80\x9d As he spoke, something like a glow of color rose slowly on\r\nhis sallow face. Her eyes were looking at him, softly attentive; and he\r\nthought guiltily of his meditations at the window before she came in.\r\n\r\nThe doctor saw his opportunity. He opened the door that led into Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s room, and stood by it, waiting silently. Mrs. Armadale\r\nentered first. In a minute more the door was closed again; and Mr.\r\nNeal stood committed to the responsibility that had been forced on\r\nhim--committed beyond recall.\r\n\r\nThe room was decorated in the gaudy continental fashion, and the warm\r\nsunlight was shining in joyously. Cupids and flowers were painted on\r\nthe ceiling; bright ribbons looped up the white window-curtains; a smart\r\ngilt clock ticked on a velvet-covered mantelpiece; mirrors gleamed on\r\nthe walls, and flowers in all the colors of the rainbow speckled the\r\ncarpet. In the midst of the finery, and the glitter, and the light,\r\nlay the paralyzed man, with his wandering eyes, and his lifeless lower\r\nface--his head propped high with many pillows; his helpless hands laid\r\nout over the bed-clothes like the hands of a corpse. By the bed head\r\nstood, grim, and old, and silent, the shriveled black nurse; and on the\r\ncounter-pane, between his father\xe2\x80\x99s outspread hands, lay the child, in\r\nhis little white frock, absorbed in the enjoyment of a new toy. When the\r\ndoor opened, and Mrs. Armadale led the way in, the boy was tossing\r\nhis plaything--a soldier on horseback--backward and forward over the\r\nhelpless hands on either side of him; and the father\xe2\x80\x99s wandering\r\neyes were following the toy to and fro, with a stealthy and ceaseless\r\nvigilance--a vigilance as of a wild animal, terrible to see.\r\n\r\nThe moment Mr. Neal appeared in the doorway, those restless eyes\r\nstopped, looked up, and fastened on the stranger with a fierce eagerness\r\nof inquiry. Slowly the motionless lips struggled into movement. With\r\nthick, hesitating articulation, they put the question which the eyes\r\nasked mutely, into words: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you the man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Neal advanced to the bedside, Mrs. Armadale drawing back from it\r\nas he approached, and waiting with the doctor at the further end of\r\nthe room. The child looked up, toy in hand, as the stranger came near,\r\nopened his bright brown eyes in momentary astonishment, and then went on\r\nwith his game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been made acquainted with your sad situation, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Neal; \xe2\x80\x9cand I have come here to place my services at your\r\ndisposal--services which no one but myself, as your medical attendant\r\ninforms me, is in a position to render you in this strange place.\r\nMy name is Neal. I am a writer to the signet in Edinburgh; and I may\r\npresume to say for myself that any confidence you wish to place in me\r\nwill be confidence not improperly bestowed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the beautiful wife were not confusing him now. He spoke\r\nto the helpless husband quietly and seriously, without his customary\r\nharshness, and with a grave compassion in his manner which presented him\r\nat his best. The sight of the death-bed had steadied him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wish me to write something for you?\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, after waiting for\r\na reply, and waiting in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d said the dying man, with the all-mastering impatience which his\r\ntongue was powerless to express, glittering angrily in his eye. \xe2\x80\x9cMy hand\r\nis gone, and my speech is going. Write!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore there was time to speak again, Mr. Neal heard the rustling of a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s dress, and the quick creaking of casters on the carpet behind\r\nhim. Mrs. Armadale was moving the writing-table across the room to\r\nthe foot of the bed. If he was to set up those safeguards of his own\r\ndevising that were to bear him harmless through all results to come, now\r\nwas the time, or never. He, kept his back turned on Mrs. Armadale, and\r\nput his precautionary question at once in the plainest terms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask, sir, before I take the pen in hand, what it is you wish me\r\nto write?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe angry eyes of the paralyzed man glittered brighter and brighter. His\r\nlips opened and closed again. He made no reply.\r\n\r\nMr. Neal tried another precautionary question, in a new direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I have written what you wish me to write,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is to\r\nbe done with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time the answer came:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeal it up in my presence, and post it to my ex--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis laboring articulation suddenly stopped and he looked piteously in\r\nthe questioner\xe2\x80\x99s face for the next word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean your executor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a letter, I suppose, that I am to post?\xe2\x80\x9d There was no answer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask if it is a letter altering your will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Neal considered a little. The mystery was thickening. The one way\r\nout of it, so far, was the way traced faintly through that strange story\r\nof the unfinished letter which the doctor had repeated to him in Mrs.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s words. The nearer he approached his unknown responsibility,\r\nthe more ominous it seemed of something serious to come. Should he risk\r\nanother question before he pledged himself irrevocably? As the doubt\r\ncrossed his mind, he felt Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s silk dress touch him on the\r\nside furthest from her husband. Her delicate dark hand was laid gently\r\non his arm; her full deep African eyes looked at him in submissive\r\nentreaty. \xe2\x80\x9cMy husband is very anxious,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you quiet\r\nhis anxiety, sir, by taking your place at the writing-table?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was from _her_ lips that the request came--from the lips of the\r\nperson who had the best right to hesitate, the wife who was excluded\r\nfrom the secret! Most men in Mr. Neal\xe2\x80\x99s position would have given up all\r\ntheir safeguards on the spot. The Scotchman gave them all up but one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will write what you wish me to write,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing Mr.\r\nArmadale. \xe2\x80\x9cI will seal it in your presence; and I will post it to your\r\nexecutor myself. But, in engaging to do this, I must beg you to remember\r\nthat I am acting entirely in the dark; and I must ask you to excuse\r\nme, if I reserve my own entire freedom of action, when your wishes\r\nin relation to the writing and the posting of the letter have been\r\nfulfilled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you give me your promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want my promise, sir, I will give it--subject to the condition I\r\nhave just named.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake your condition, and keep your promise. My desk,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking\r\nat his wife for the first time.\r\n\r\nShe crossed the room eagerly to fetch the desk from a chair in a corner.\r\nReturning with it, she made a passing sign to the negress, who still\r\nstood, grim and silent, in the place that she had occupied from the\r\nfirst. The woman advanced, obedient to the sign, to take the child from\r\nthe bed. At the instant when she touched him, the father\xe2\x80\x99s eyes--fixed\r\npreviously on the desk--turned on her with the stealthy quickness of\r\na cat. \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the fresh voice of the boy, still\r\ncharmed with his plaything, and still liking his place on the bed. The\r\nnegress left the room, and the child, in high triumph, trotted his toy\r\nsoldier up and down on the bedclothes that lay rumpled over his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreast. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s lovely face contracted with a pang of jealousy as\r\nshe looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I open your desk?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, pushing back the child\xe2\x80\x99s plaything\r\nsharply while she spoke. An answering look from her husband guided her\r\nhand to the place under his pillow where the key was hidden. She opened\r\nthe desk, and disclosed inside some small sheets of manuscript pinned\r\ntogether. \xe2\x80\x9cThese?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, producing them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can go now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman sitting at the writing-table, the doctor stirring a\r\nstimulant mixture in a corner, looked at each other with an anxiety in\r\nboth their faces which they could neither of them control. The words\r\nthat banished the wife from the room were spoken. The moment had come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can go now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Armadale, for the second time.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the child, established comfortably on the bed, and an ashy\r\npaleness spread slowly over her face. She looked at the fatal\r\nletter which was a sealed secret to her, and a torture of jealous\r\nsuspicion--suspicion of that other woman who had been the shadow and\r\nthe poison of her life--wrung her to the heart. After moving a few\r\nsteps from the bedside, she stopped, and came back again. Armed with the\r\ndouble courage of her love and her despair, she pressed her lips on\r\nher dying husband\xe2\x80\x99s cheek, and pleaded with him for the last time. Her\r\nburning tears dropped on his face as she whispered to him: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Allan,\r\nthink how I have loved you! think how hard I have tried to make you\r\nhappy! think how soon I shall lose you! Oh, my own love! don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsend me away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words pleaded for her; the kiss pleaded for her; the recollection\r\nof the love that had been given to him, and never returned, touched the\r\nheart of the fast-sinking man as nothing had touched it since the day\r\nof his marriage. A heavy sigh broke from him. He looked at her, and\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me stay,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, pressing her face closer to his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will only distress you,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing distresses me, but being sent away from _you_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited. She saw that he was thinking, and waited too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I let you stay a little--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go when I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn your oath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fetters that bound his tongue seemed to be loosened for a moment in\r\nthe great outburst of anxiety which forced that question to his lips. He\r\nspoke those startling words as he had spoken no words yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my oath!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, and, dropping on her knees at the bedside,\r\npassionately kissed his hand. The two strangers in the room turned their\r\nheads away by common consent. In the silence that followed, the one\r\nsound stirring was the small sound of the child\xe2\x80\x99s toy, as he moved it\r\nhither and thither on the bed.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was the first who broke the spell of stillness which had\r\nfallen on all the persons present. He approached the patient, and\r\nexamined him anxiously. Mrs. Armadale rose from her knees; and, first\r\nwaiting for her husband\xe2\x80\x99s permission, carried the sheets of manuscript\r\nwhich she had taken out of the desk to the table at which Mr. Neal was\r\nwaiting. Flushed and eager, more beautiful than ever in the vehement\r\nagitation which still possessed her, she stooped over him as she put\r\nthe letter into his hands, and, seizing on the means to her end with a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s headlong self-abandonment to her own impulses, whispered to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cRead it out from the beginning. I must and will hear it!\xe2\x80\x9d Her\r\neyes flashed their burning light into his; her breath beat on his cheek.\r\nBefore he could answer, before he could think, she was back with her\r\nhusband. In an instant she had spoken, and in that instant her beauty\r\nhad bent the Scotchman to her will. Frowning in reluctant acknowledgment\r\nof his own inability to resist her, he turned over the leaves of the\r\nletter; looked at the blank place where the pen had dropped from the\r\nwriter\xe2\x80\x99s hand and had left a blot on the paper; turned back again to the\r\nbeginning, and said the words, in the wife\xe2\x80\x99s interest, which the wife\r\nherself had put into his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, sir, you may wish to make some corrections,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, with\r\nall his attention apparently fixed on the letter, and with every outward\r\nappearance of letting his sour temper again get the better of him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I read over to you what you have already written?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Armadale, sitting at the bed head on one side, and the doctor, with\r\nhis fingers on the patient\xe2\x80\x99s pulse, sitting on the other, waited with\r\nwidely different anxieties for the answer to Mr. Neal\xe2\x80\x99s question. Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned searchingly from his child to his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _will_ hear it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Her breath came and went quickly; her\r\nhand stole up and took his; she bowed her head in silence. Her husband\r\npaused, taking secret counsel with his thoughts, and keeping his eyes\r\nfixed on his wife. At last he decided, and gave the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cRead it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand stop when I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was close on one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and the bell was ringing which summoned the\r\nvisitors to their early dinner at the inn. The quick beat of footsteps,\r\nand the gathering hum of voices outside, penetrated gayly into the room,\r\nas Mr. Neal spread the manuscript before him on the table, and read the\r\nopening sentences in these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI address this letter to my son, when my son is of an age to understand\r\nit. Having lost all hope of living to see my boy grow up to manhood, I\r\nhave no choice but to write here what I would fain have said to him at a\r\nfuture time with my own lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have three objects in writing. First, to reveal the circumstances\r\nwhich attended the marriage of an English lady of my acquaintance, in\r\nthe island of Madeira. Secondly, to throw the true light on the death of\r\nher husband a short time afterward, on board the French timber ship _La\r\nGrace de Dieu_. Thirdly, to warn my son of a danger that lies in wait\r\nfor him--a danger that will rise from his father\xe2\x80\x99s grave when the earth\r\nhas closed over his father\xe2\x80\x99s ashes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe story of the English lady\xe2\x80\x99s marriage begins with my inheriting the\r\ngreat Armadale property, and my taking the fatal Armadale name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the only surviving son of the late Mathew Wrentmore, of Barbadoes.\r\nI was born on our family estate in that island, and I lost my father\r\nwhen I was still a child. My mother was blindly fond of me; she denied\r\nme nothing, she let me live as I pleased. My boyhood and youth were\r\npassed in idleness and self-indulgence, among people--slaves and\r\nhalf-castes mostly--to whom my will was law. I doubt if there is a\r\ngentleman of my birth and station in all England as ignorant as I am at\r\nthis moment. I doubt if there was ever a young man in this world whose\r\npassions were left so entirely without control of any kind as mine were\r\nin those early days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother had a woman\xe2\x80\x99s romantic objection to my father\xe2\x80\x99s homely\r\nChristian name. I was christened Allan, after the name of a wealthy\r\ncousin of my father\xe2\x80\x99s--the late Allan Armadale--who possessed estates in\r\nour neighborhood, the largest and most productive in the island, and who\r\nconsented to be my godfather by proxy. Mr. Armadale had never seen his\r\nWest Indian property. He lived in England; and, after sending me the\r\ncustomary godfather\xe2\x80\x99s present, he held no further communication with my\r\nparents for years afterward. I was just twenty-one before we heard again\r\nfrom Mr. Armadale. On that occasion my mother received a letter from\r\nhim asking if I was still alive, and offering no less (if I was) than to\r\nmake me the heir to his West Indian property.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis piece of good fortune fell to me entirely through the misconduct\r\nof Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s son, an only child. The young man had disgraced\r\nhimself beyond all redemption; had left his home an outlaw; and had been\r\nthereupon renounced by his father at once and forever. Having no other\r\nnear male relative to succeed him, Mr. Armadale thought of his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson and his own godson; and he offered the West Indian estate to me, and\r\nmy heirs after me, on one condition--that I and my heirs should take\r\nhis name. The proposal was gratefully accepted, and the proper legal\r\nmeasures were adopted for changing my name in the colony and in the\r\nmother country. By the next mail information reached Mr. Armadale that\r\nhis condition had been complied with. The return mail brought news\r\nfrom the lawyers. The will had been altered in my favor, and in a week\r\nafterward the death of my benefactor had made me the largest proprietor\r\nand the richest man in Barbadoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was the first event in the chain. The second event followed it six\r\nweeks afterward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt that time there happened to be a vacancy in the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s office on\r\nthe estate, and there came to fill it a young man about my own age who\r\nhad recently arrived in the island. He announced himself by the name of\r\nFergus Ingleby. My impulses governed me in everything; I knew no law but\r\nthe law of my own caprice, and I took a fancy to the stranger the moment\r\nI set eyes on him. He had the manners of a gentleman, and he possessed\r\nthe most attractive social qualities which, in my small experience, I\r\nhad ever met with. When I heard that the written references to character\r\nwhich he had brought with him were pronounced to be unsatisfactory, I\r\ninterfered, and insisted that he should have the place. My will was law,\r\nand he had it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother disliked and distrusted Ingleby from the first. When she\r\nfound the intimacy between us rapidly ripening; when she found me\r\nadmitting this inferior to the closest companionship and confidence\r\n(I had lived with my inferiors all my life, and I liked it), she made\r\neffort after effort to part us, and failed in one and all. Driven to her\r\nlast resources, she resolved to try the one chance left--the chance of\r\npersuading me to take a voyage which I had often thought of--a voyage to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore she spoke to me on the subject, she resolved to interest me\r\nin the idea of seeing England, as I had never been interested yet. She\r\nwrote to an old friend and an old admirer of hers, the late Stephen\r\nBlanchard, of Thorpe Ambrose, in Norfolk--a gentleman of landed estate,\r\nand a widower with a grown-up family. After-discoveries informed me that\r\nshe must have alluded to their former attachment (which was checked,\r\nI believe, by the parents on either side); and that, in asking Mr.\r\nBlanchard\xe2\x80\x99s welcome for her son when he came to England, she made\r\ninquiries about his daughter, which hinted at the chance of a marriage\r\nuniting the two families, if the young lady and I met and liked one\r\nanother. We were equally matched in every respect, and my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrecollection of her girlish attachment to Mr. Blanchard made the\r\nprospect of my marrying her old admirer\xe2\x80\x99s daughter the brightest and\r\nhappiest prospect that her eyes could see. Of all this I knew nothing\r\nuntil Mr. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s answer arrived at Barbadoes. Then my mother showed\r\nme the letter, and put the temptation which was to separate me from\r\nFergus Ingleby openly in my way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s letter was dated from the Island of Madeira. He was\r\nout of health, and he had been ordered there by the doctors to try the\r\nclimate. His daughter was with him. After heartily reciprocating all my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s hopes and wishes, he proposed (if I intended leaving Barbadoes\r\nshortly) that I should take Madeira on my way to England, and pay him a\r\nvisit at his temporary residence in the island. If this could not be,\r\nhe mentioned the time at which he expected to be back in England, when\r\nI might be sure of finding a welcome at his own house of Thorpe\r\nAmbrose. In conclusion, he apologized for not writing at greater length;\r\nexplaining that his sight was affected, and that he had disobeyed the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s orders by yielding to the temptation of writing to his old\r\nfriend with his own hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly as it was expressed, the letter itself might have had little\r\ninfluence on me. But there was something else besides the letter; there\r\nwas inclosed in it a miniature portrait of Miss Blanchard. At the back\r\nof the portrait, her father had written, half-jestingly, half-tenderly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t ask my daughter to spare my eyes as usual, without telling her\r\nof your inquiries, and putting a young lady\xe2\x80\x99s diffidence to the blush.\r\nSo I send her in effigy (without her knowledge) to answer for herself.\r\nIt is a good likeness of a good girl. If she likes your son--and if I\r\nlike him, which I am sure I shall--we may yet live, my good friend, to\r\nsee our children what we might once have been ourselves--man and wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMy mother gave me the miniature with the letter. The portrait at once\r\nstruck me--I can\xe2\x80\x99t say why, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say how--as nothing of the kind had\r\never struck me before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarder intellects than mine might have attributed the extraordinary\r\nimpression produced on me to the disordered condition of my mind at that\r\ntime; to the weariness of my own base pleasures which had been gaining\r\non me for months past, to the undefined longing which that weariness\r\nimplied for newer interests and fresher hopes than any that had\r\npossessed me yet. I attempted no such sober self-examination as this: I\r\nbelieved in destiny then, I believe in destiny now. It was enough for\r\nme to know--as I did know--that the first sense I had ever felt of\r\nsomething better in my nature than my animal self was roused by that\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s face looking at me from her picture as no woman\xe2\x80\x99s face had ever\r\nlooked at me yet. In those tender eyes--in the chance of making that\r\ngentle creature my wife--I saw my destiny written. The portrait which\r\nhad come into my hands so strangely and so unexpectedly was the silent\r\nmessenger of happiness close at hand, sent to warn, to encourage, to\r\nrouse me before it was too late. I put the miniature under my pillow at\r\nnight; I looked at it again the next morning. My conviction of the day\r\nbefore remained as strong as ever; my superstition (if you please to\r\ncall it so) pointed out to me irresistibly the way on which I should go.\r\nThere was a ship in port which was to sail for England in a fortnight,\r\ntouching at Madeira. In that ship I took my passage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far the reader had advanced with no interruption to disturb him.\r\nBut at the last words the tones of another voice, low and broken,\r\nmingled with his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas she a fair woman,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the voice, \xe2\x80\x9cor dark, like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Neal paused, and looked up. The doctor was still at the bed head,\r\nwith his fingers mechanically on the patient\xe2\x80\x99s pulse. The child, missing\r\nhis midday sleep, was beginning to play languidly with his new toy. The\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were watching him with a rapt and ceaseless attention. But\r\none great change was visible in the listeners since the narrative had\r\nbegun. Mrs. Armadale had dropped her hold of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and sat\r\nwith her face steadily turned away from him The hot African blood burned\r\nred in her dusky cheeks as she obstinately repeated the question: \xe2\x80\x9cWas\r\nshe a fair woman, or dark, like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFair,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, without looking at her.\r\n\r\nHer hands, lying clasped together in her lap, wrung each other hard--she\r\nsaid no more. Mr. Neal\xe2\x80\x99s overhanging eyebrows lowered ominously as\r\nhe returned to the narrative. He had incurred his own severe\r\ndispleasure--he had caught himself in the act of secretly pitying her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said\xe2\x80\x9d--the letter proceeded--\xe2\x80\x9cthat Ingleby was admitted to my\r\nclosest confidence. I was sorry to leave him; and I was distressed by\r\nhis evident surprise and mortification when he heard that I was going\r\naway. In my own justification, I showed him the letter and the likeness,\r\nand told him the truth. His interest in the portrait seemed to be hardly\r\ninferior to my own. He asked me about Miss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s family and\r\nMiss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s fortune with the sympathy of a true friend; and he\r\nstrengthened my regard for him, and my belief in him, by putting himself\r\nout of the question, and by generously encouraging me to persist in my\r\nnew purpose. When we parted, I was in high health and spirits. Before\r\nwe met again the next day, I was suddenly struck by an illness which\r\nthreatened both my reason and my life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no proof against Ingleby. There was more than one woman on the\r\nisland whom I had wronged beyond all forgiveness, and whose vengeance\r\nmight well have reached me at that time. I can accuse nobody. I can only\r\nsay that my life was saved by my old black nurse; and that the woman\r\nafterward acknowledged having used the known negro antidote to a known\r\nnegro poison in those parts. When my first days of convalescence came,\r\nthe ship in which my passage had been taken had long since sailed. When\r\nI asked for Ingleby, he was gone. Proofs of his unpardonable misconduct\r\nin his situation were placed before me, which not even my partiality for\r\nhim could resist. He had been turned out of the office in the first days\r\nof my illness, and nothing more was known of him but that he had left\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll through my sufferings the portrait had been under my pillow. All\r\nthrough my convalescence it was my one consolation when I remembered the\r\npast, and my one encouragement when I thought of the future. No words\r\ncan describe the hold that first fancy had now taken of me--with time\r\nand solitude and suffering to help it. My mother, with all her interest\r\nin the match, was startled by the unexpected success of her own project.\r\nShe had written to tell Mr. Blanchard of my illness, but had received no\r\nreply. She now offered to write again, if I would promise not to leave\r\nher before my recovery was complete. My impatience acknowledged no\r\nrestraint. Another ship in port gave me another chance of leaving for\r\nMadeira. Another examination of Mr. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s letter of invitation\r\nassured me that I should find him still in the island, if I seized\r\nmy opportunity on the spot. In defiance of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s entreaties, I\r\ninsisted on taking my passage in the second ship--and this time, when\r\nthe ship sailed, I was on board.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe change did me good; the sea-air made a man of me again. After an\r\nunusually rapid voyage, I found myself at the end of my pilgrimage. On\r\na fine, still evening which I can never forget, I stood alone on the\r\nshore, with her likeness in my bosom, and saw the white walls of the\r\nhouse where I knew that she lived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI strolled round the outer limits of the grounds to compose myself\r\nbefore I went in. Venturing through a gate and a shrubbery, I looked\r\ninto the garden, and saw a lady there, loitering alone on the lawn. She\r\nturned her face toward me--and I beheld the original of my portrait, the\r\nfulfillment of my dream! It is useless, and worse than useless, to write\r\nof it now. Let me only say that every promise which the likeness had\r\nmade to my fancy the living woman kept to my eyes in the moment when\r\nthey first looked on her. Let me say this--and no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was too violently agitated to trust myself in her presence. I drew\r\nback undiscovered, and, making my way to the front door of the house,\r\nasked for her father first. Mr. Blanchard had retired to his room,\r\nand could see nobody. Upon that I took courage, and asked for Miss\r\nBlanchard. The servant smiled. \xe2\x80\x98My young lady is not Miss Blanchard any\r\nlonger, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98She is married.\xe2\x80\x99 Those words would have struck\r\nsome men, in my position, to the earth. They fired my hot blood, and I\r\nseized the servant by the throat, in a frenzy of rage \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a lie!\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nbroke out, speaking to him as if he had been one of the slaves on my own\r\nestate. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the truth,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, struggling with me; \xe2\x80\x98her husband\r\nis in the house at this moment.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Who is he, you scoundrel?\xe2\x80\x99 The servant\r\nanswered by repeating my own name, to my own face: \xe2\x80\x98_Allan Armadale_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can now guess the truth. Fergus Ingleby was the outlawed son whose\r\nname and whose inheritance I had taken. And Fergus Ingleby was even with\r\nme for depriving him of his birthright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome account of the manner in which the deception had been carried out\r\nis necessary to explain--I don\xe2\x80\x99t say to justify--the share I took in the\r\nevents that followed my arrival at Madeira.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Ingleby\xe2\x80\x99s own confession, he had come to Barbadoes--knowing of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death and of my succession to the estates--with the settled\r\npurpose of plundering and injuring me. My rash confidence put such an\r\nopportunity into his hands as he could never have hoped for. He had\r\nwaited to possess himself of the letter which my mother wrote to Mr.\r\nBlanchard at the outset of my illness--had then caused his own dismissal\r\nfrom his situation--and had sailed for Madeira in the very ship that was\r\nto have sailed with me. Arrived at the island, he had waited again till\r\nthe vessel was away once more on her voyage, and had then presented\r\nhimself at Mr. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s--not in the assumed name by which I shall\r\ncontinue to speak of him here, but in the name which was as certainly\r\nhis as mine, \xe2\x80\x98Allan Armadale.\xe2\x80\x99 The fraud at the outset presented few\r\ndifficulties. He had only an ailing old man (who had not seen my mother\r\nfor half a lifetime) and an innocent, unsuspicious girl (who had never\r\nseen her at all) to deal with; and he had learned enough in my service\r\nto answer the few questions that were put to him as readily as I might\r\nhave answered them myself. His looks and manners, his winning ways with\r\nwomen, his quickness and cunning, did the rest. While I was still on my\r\nsickbed, he had won Miss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s affections. While I was dreaming\r\nover the likeness in the first days of my convalescence, he had secured\r\nMr. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s consent to the celebration of the marriage before he and\r\nhis daughter left the island.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus far Mr. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s infirmity of sight had helped the deception.\r\nHe had been content to send messages to my mother, and to receive the\r\nmessages which were duly invented in return. But when the suitor was\r\naccepted, and the wedding-day was appointed, he felt it due to his old\r\nfriend to write to her, asking her formal consent and inviting her to\r\nthe marriage. He could only complete part of the letter himself; the\r\nrest was finished, under his dictation, by Miss Blanchard. There was no\r\nchance of being beforehand with the post-office this time; and Ingleby,\r\nsure of his place in the heart of his victim, waylaid her as she came\r\nout of her father\xe2\x80\x99s room with the letter, and privately told her the\r\ntruth. She was still under age, and the position was a serious one.\r\nIf the letter was posted, no resource would be left but to wait and be\r\nparted forever, or to elope under circumstances which made detection\r\nalmost a certainty. The destination of any ship which took them away\r\nwould be known beforehand; and the fast-sailing yacht in which Mr.\r\nBlanchard had come to Madeira was waiting in the harbor to take him back\r\nto England. The only other alternative was to continue the deception by\r\nsuppressing the letter, and to confess the truth when they were securely\r\nmarried. What arts of persuasion Ingleby used--what base advantage he\r\nmight previously have taken of her love and her trust in him to degrade\r\nMiss Blanchard to his own level--I cannot say. He did degrade her. The\r\nletter never went to its destination; and, with the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s privity\r\nand consent, the father\xe2\x80\x99s confidence was abused to the very last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one precaution now left to take was to fabricate the answer from\r\nmy mother which Mr. Blanchard expected, and which would arrive in due\r\ncourse of post before the day appointed for the marriage. Ingleby had\r\nmy mother\xe2\x80\x99s stolen letter with him; but he was without the imitative\r\ndexterity which would have enabled him to make use of it for a forgery\r\nof her handwriting. Miss Blanchard, who had consented passively to the\r\ndeception, refused to take any active share in the fraud practiced on\r\nher father. In this difficulty, Ingleby found an instrument ready to\r\nhis hand in an orphan girl of barely twelve years old, a marvel of\r\nprecocious ability, whom Miss Blanchard had taken a romantic fancy\r\nto befriend and whom she had brought away with her from England to\r\nbe trained as her maid. That girl\xe2\x80\x99s wicked dexterity removed the one\r\nserious obstacle left to the success of the fraud. I saw the imitation\r\nof my mother\xe2\x80\x99s writing which she had produced under Ingleby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstructions and (if the shameful truth must be told) with her young\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge--and I believe I should have been deceived by it\r\nmyself. I saw the girl afterward--and my blood curdled at the sight of\r\nher. If she is alive now, woe to the people who trust her! No creature\r\nmore innately deceitful and more innately pitiless ever walked this\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe forged letter paved the way securely for the marriage; and when I\r\nreached the house, they were (as the servant had truly told me) man and\r\nwife. My arrival on the scene simply precipitated the confession\r\nwhich they had both agreed to make. Ingleby\xe2\x80\x99s own lips shamelessly\r\nacknowledged the truth. He had nothing to lose by speaking out--he was\r\nmarried, and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s fortune was beyond her father\xe2\x80\x99s control. I pass\r\nover all that followed--my interview with the daughter, and my interview\r\nwith the father--to come to results. For two days the efforts of the\r\nwife, and the efforts of the clergyman who had celebrated the marriage,\r\nwere successful in keeping Ingleby and myself apart. On the third day\r\nI set my trap more successfully, and I and the man who had mortally\r\ninjured me met together alone, face to face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember how my confidence had been abused; remember how the one good\r\npurpose of my life had been thwarted; remember the violent passions\r\nrooted deep in my nature, and never yet controlled--and then imagine for\r\nyourself what passed between us. All I need tell here is the end. He was\r\na taller and a stronger man than I, and he took his brute\xe2\x80\x99s advantage\r\nwith a brute\xe2\x80\x99s ferocity. He struck me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of the injuries I had received at that man\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and then\r\nthink of his setting his mark on my face by a blow!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to an English officer who had been my fellow-passenger on the\r\nvoyage from Barbadoes. I told him the truth, and he agreed with me that\r\na meeting was inevitable. Dueling had its received formalities and its\r\nestablished laws in those days; and he began to speak of them. I stopped\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x98I will take a pistol in my right hand,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98and he shall take\r\na pistol in his: I will take one end of a handkerchief in my left hand,\r\nand he shall take the other end in his; and across that handkerchief the\r\nduel shall be fought.\xe2\x80\x99 The officer got up, and looked at me as if I had\r\npersonally insulted him. \xe2\x80\x98You are asking me to be present at a murder\r\nand a suicide,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98I decline to serve you.\xe2\x80\x99 He left the room. As\r\nsoon as he was gone I wrote down the words I had said to the officer and\r\nsent them by a messenger to Ingleby. While I was waiting for an answer,\r\nI sat down before the glass, and looked at his mark on my face. \xe2\x80\x98Many a\r\nman has had blood on his hands and blood on his conscience,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98for less than this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe messenger came back with Ingleby\xe2\x80\x99s answer. It appointed a meeting\r\nfor three o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next day, at a lonely place in the interior of the\r\nisland. I had resolved what to do if he refused; his letter released\r\nme from the horror of my own resolution. I felt grateful to him--yes,\r\nabsolutely grateful to him--for writing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day I went to the place. He was not there. I waited two hours,\r\nand he never came. At last the truth dawned on me. \xe2\x80\x98Once a coward,\r\nalways a coward,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought. I went back to Mr. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nBefore I got there, a sudden misgiving seized me, and I turned aside\r\nto the harbor. I was right; the harbor was the place to go to. A ship\r\nsailing for Lisbon that afternoon had offered him the opportunity of\r\ntaking a passage for himself and his wife, and escaping me. His answer\r\nto my challenge had served its purpose of sending me out of the way into\r\nthe interior of the island. Once more I had trusted in Fergus Ingleby,\r\nand once more those sharp wits of his had been too much for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked my informant if Mr. Blanchard was aware as yet of his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s departure. He had discovered it, but not until the ship had\r\nsailed. This time I took a lesson in cunning from Ingleby. Instead of\r\nshowing myself at Mr. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s house, I went first and looked at Mr.\r\nBlanchard\xe2\x80\x99s yacht.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe vessel told me what the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s master might have concealed--the\r\ntruth. I found her in the confusion of a sudden preparation for sea.\r\nAll the crew were on board, with the exception of some few who had been\r\nallowed their leave on shore, and who were away in the interior of the\r\nisland, nobody knew where. When I discovered that the sailing-master was\r\ntrying in, to supply their places with the best men he could pick up at\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, my resolution was instantly taken. I knew the duties\r\non board a yacht well enough, having had a vessel of my own, and having\r\nsailed her myself. Hurrying into the town, I changed my dress for a\r\nsailor\xe2\x80\x99s coat and hat, and, returning to the harbor, I offered myself as\r\none of the volunteer crew. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the sailing-master saw in\r\nmy face. My answers to his questions satisfied him, and yet he looked at\r\nme and hesitated. But hands were scarce, and it ended in my being taken\r\non board. An hour later Mr. Blanchard joined us, and was assisted into\r\nthe cabin, suffering pitiably in mind and body both. An hour after\r\nthat we were at sea, with a starless night overhead, and a fresh breeze\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I had surmised, we were in pursuit of the vessel in which Ingleby\r\nand his wife had left the island that afternoon. The ship was French,\r\nand was employed in the timber trade: her name was _La Grace de Dieu_.\r\nNothing more was known of her than that she was bound for Lisbon; that\r\nshe had been driven out of her course; and that she had touched at\r\nMadeira, short of men and short of provisions. The last want had been\r\nsupplied, but not the first. Sailors distrusted the sea-worthiness of\r\nthe ship, and disliked the look of the vagabond crew. When those two\r\nserious facts had been communicated to Mr. Blanchard, the hard words he\r\nhad spoken to his child in the first shock of discovering that she had\r\nhelped to deceive him smote him to the heart. He instantly determined to\r\ngive his daughter a refuge on board his own vessel, and to quiet her by\r\nkeeping her villain of a husband out of the way of all harm at my hands.\r\nThe yacht sailed three feet and more to the ship\xe2\x80\x99s one. There was no\r\ndoubt of our overtaking _La Grace de Dieu_; the only fear was that we\r\nmight pass her in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter we had been some little time out, the wind suddenly dropped, and\r\nthere fell on us an airless, sultry calm. When the order came to get\r\nthe topmasts on deck, and to shift the large sails, we all knew what to\r\nexpect. In little better than an hour more, the storm was upon us, the\r\nthunder was pealing over our heads, and the yacht was running for it.\r\nShe was a powerful schooner-rigged vessel of three hundred tons,\r\nas strong as wood and iron could make her; she was handled by a\r\nsailing-master who thoroughly understood his work, and she behaved\r\nnobly. As the new morning came, the fury of the wind, blowing still from\r\nthe southwest quarter, subsided a little, and the sea was less heavy.\r\nJust before daybreak we heard faintly, through the howling of the gale,\r\nthe report of a gun. The men collected anxiously on deck, looked at each\r\nother, and said: \xe2\x80\x98There she is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the daybreak we saw the vessel, and the timber-ship it was. She\r\nlay wallowing in the trough of the sea, her foremast and her mainmast\r\nboth gone--a water-logged wreck. The yacht carried three boats;\r\none amidships, and two slung to davits on the quarters; and the\r\nsailing-master, seeing signs of the storm renewing its fury before long,\r\ndetermined on lowering the quarter-boats while the lull lasted. Few as\r\nthe people were on board the wreck, they were too many for one boat, and\r\nthe risk of trying two boats at once was thought less, in the critical\r\nstate of the weather, than the risk of making two separate trips from\r\nthe yacht to the ship. There might be time to make one trip in safety,\r\nbut no man could look at the heavens and say there would be time enough\r\nfor two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boats were manned by volunteers from the crew, I being in the\r\nsecond of the two. When the first boat was got alongside of the\r\ntimber-ship--a service of difficulty and danger which no words can\r\ndescribe--all the men on board made a rush to leave the wreck together.\r\nIf the boat had not been pulled off again before the whole of them had\r\ncrowded in, the lives of all must have been sacrificed. As our boat\r\napproached the vessel in its turn, we arranged that four of us should\r\nget on board--two (I being one of them) to see to the safety of Mr.\r\nBlanchard\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and two to beat back the cowardly remnant of the\r\ncrew if they tried to crowd in first. The other three--the coxswain and\r\ntwo oarsmen--were left in the boat to keep her from being crushed by the\r\nship. What the others saw when they first boarded _La Grace de Dieu_ I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know; what I saw was the woman whom I had lost, the woman\r\nvilely stolen from me, lying in a swoon on the deck. We lowered her,\r\ninsensible, into the boat. The remnant of the crew--five in number--were\r\ncompelled by main force to follow her in an orderly manner, one by one,\r\nand minute by minute, as the chance offered for safely taking them in. I\r\nwas the last who left; and, at the next roll of the ship toward us, the\r\nempty length of the deck, without a living creature on it from stem to\r\nstern, told the boat\xe2\x80\x99s crew that their work was done. With the louder\r\nand louder howling of the fast-rising tempest to warn them, they rowed\r\nfor their lives back to the yacht.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA succession of heavy squalls had brought round the course of the\r\nnew storm that was coming, from the south to the north; and the\r\nsailing-master, watching his opportunity, had wore the yacht to be ready\r\nfor it. Before the last of our men had got on board again, it burst on\r\nus with the fury of a hurricane. Our boat was swamped, but not a life\r\nwas lost. Once more we ran before it, due south, at the mercy of the\r\nwind. I was on deck with the rest, watching the one rag of sail we could\r\nventure to set, and waiting to supply its place with another, if it blew\r\nout of the bolt-ropes, when the mate came close to me, and shouted in my\r\near through the thunder of the storm: \xe2\x80\x98She has come to her senses in the\r\ncabin, and has asked for her husband. Where is he?\xe2\x80\x99 Not a man on board\r\nknew. The yacht was searched from one end to another without finding\r\nhim. The men were mustered in defiance of the weather--he was not among\r\nthem. The crews of the two boats were questioned. All the first crew\r\ncould say was that they had pulled away from the wreck when the rush\r\ninto their boat took place, and that they knew nothing of whom they let\r\nin or whom they kept out. All the second crew could say was that they\r\nhad brought back to the yacht every living soul left by the first boat\r\non the deck of the timber-ship. There was no blaming anybody; but, at\r\nthe same time, there was no resisting the fact that the man was missing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll through that day the storm, raging unabatedly, never gave us even\r\nthe shadow of a chance of returning and searching the wreck. The one\r\nhope for the yacht was to scud. Toward evening the gale, after having\r\ncarried us to the southward of Madeira, began at last to break--the wind\r\nshifted again--and allowed us to bear up for the island. Early the next\r\nmorning we got back into port. Mr. Blanchard and his daughter were taken\r\nashore, the sailing-master accompanying them, and warning us that he\r\nshould have something to say on his return which would nearly concern\r\nthe whole crew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were mustered on deck, and addressed by the sailing-master as soon\r\nas he came on board again. He had Mr. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s orders to go back at\r\nonce to the timber-ship and to search for the missing man. We were bound\r\nto do this for his sake, and for the sake of his wife, whose reason was\r\ndespaired of by the doctors if something was not done to quiet her. We\r\nmight be almost sure of finding the vessel still afloat, for her ladling\r\nof timber would keep her above water as long as her hull held together.\r\nIf the man was on board--living or dead--he must be found and brought\r\nback. And if the weather continued to be moderate, there was no reason\r\nwhy the men, with proper assistance, should not bring the ship back,\r\ntoo, and (their master being quite willing) earn their share of the\r\nsalvage with the officers of the yacht.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon this the crew gave three cheers, and set to work forthwith to get\r\nthe schooner to sea again. I was the only one of them who drew back\r\nfrom the enterprise. I told them the storm had upset me--I was ill, and\r\nwanted rest. They all looked me in the face as I passed through them on\r\nmy way out of the yacht, but not a man of them spoke to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waited through that day at a tavern on the port for the first\r\nnews from the wreck. It was brought toward night-fall by one of the\r\npilot-boats which had taken part in the enterprise--a successful\r\nenterprise, as the event proved--for saving the abandoned ship. _La\r\nGrace de Dieu_ had been discovered still floating, and the body of\r\nIngleby had been found on board, drowned in the cabin. At dawn the next\r\nmorning the dead man was brought back by the yacht; and on the same day\r\nthe funeral took place in the Protestant cemetery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice from the bed, before the reader could turn to a\r\nnew leaf and begin the next paragraph.\r\n\r\nThere was a change in the room, and there were changes in the audience,\r\nsince Mr. Neal had last looked up from the narrative. A ray of sunshine\r\nwas crossing the death-bed; and the child, overcome by drowsiness, lay\r\npeacefully asleep in the golden light. The father\xe2\x80\x99s countenance had\r\naltered visibly. Forced into action by the tortured mind, the muscles of\r\nthe lower face, which had never moved yet, were moving distortedly now.\r\nWarned by the damps gathering heavily on his forehead, the doctor had\r\nrisen to revive the sinking man. On the other side of the bed the wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchair stood empty. At the moment when her husband had interrupted the\r\nreading, she had drawn back behind the bed head, out of his sight.\r\nSupporting herself against the wall, she stood there in hiding, her eyes\r\nfastened in hungering suspense on the manuscript in Mr. Neal\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nIn a minute more the silence was broken again by Mr. Armadale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, looking angrily at his wife\xe2\x80\x99s empty chair. The\r\ndoctor pointed to the place. She had no choice but to come forward. She\r\ncame slowly and stood before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promised to go when I told you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Neal tried hard to control his hand as it kept his place between the\r\nleaves of the manuscripts but it trembled in spite of him. A suspicion\r\nwhich had been slowly forcing itself on his mind, while he was reading,\r\nbecame a certainty when he heard those words. From one revelation to\r\nanother the letter had gone on, until it had now reached the brink of a\r\nlast disclosure to come. At that brink the dying man had predetermined\r\nto silence the reader\xe2\x80\x99s voice, before he had permitted his wife to hear\r\nthe narrative read. There was the secret which the son was to know\r\nin after years, and which the mother was never to approach. From that\r\nresolution, his wife\xe2\x80\x99s tenderest pleadings had never moved him an\r\ninch--and now, from his own lips, his wife knew it.\r\n\r\nShe made him no answer. She stood there and looked at him; looked her\r\nlast entreaty--perhaps her last farewell. His eyes gave her back no\r\nanswering glance: they wandered from her mercilessly to the sleeping\r\nboy. She turned speechless from the bed. Without a look at the\r\nchild--without a word to the two strangers breathlessly watching\r\nher--she kept the promise she had given, and in dead silence left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThere was something in the manner of her departure which shook the\r\nself-possession of both the men who witnessed it. When the door closed\r\non her, they recoiled instinctively from advancing further in the dark.\r\nThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance was the first to express itself. He attempted\r\nto obtain the patient\xe2\x80\x99s permission to withdraw until the letter was\r\ncompleted. The patient refused.\r\n\r\nMr. Neal spoke next at greater length and to more serious purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor is accustomed in his profession,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am\r\naccustomed in mine, to have the secrets of others placed in our keeping.\r\nBut it is my duty, before we go further, to ask if you really understand\r\nthe extraordinary position which we now occupy toward one another. You\r\nhave just excluded Mrs. Armadale, before our own eyes, from a place in\r\nyour confidence. And you are now offering that same place to two men who\r\nare total strangers to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Armadale, \xe2\x80\x9c_because_ you are strangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFew as the words were, the inference to be drawn from them was not of a\r\nnature to set distrust at rest. Mr. Neal put it plainly into words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are in urgent need of my help and of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s help,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to understand (so long as you secure our assistance) that the\r\nimpression which the closing passages of this letter may produce on us\r\nis a matter of indifference to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t spare you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t spare myself. I _do_ spare my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou force me to a conclusion, sir, which is a very serious one,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Neal. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I am to finish this letter under your dictation, I must\r\nclaim permission--having read aloud the greater part of it already--to\r\nread aloud what remains, in the hearing of this gentleman, as a\r\nwitness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGravely doubting, the doctor resumed his chair. Gravely doubting, Mr.\r\nNeal turned the leaf, and read the next words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is more to tell before I can leave the dead man to his rest. I\r\nhave described the finding of his body. But I have not described the\r\ncircumstances under which he met his death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was known to have been on deck when the yacht\xe2\x80\x99s boats were seen\r\napproaching the wreck; and he was afterward missed in the confusion\r\ncaused by the panic of the crew. At that time the water was five feet\r\ndeep in the cabin, and was rising fast. There was little doubt of his\r\nhaving gone down into that water of his own accord. The discovery of his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s jewel box, close under him, on the floor, explained his presence\r\nin the cabin. He was known to have seen help approaching, and it was\r\nquite likely that he had thereupon gone below to make an effort at\r\nsaving the box. It was less probable--though it might still have been\r\ninferred--that his death was the result of some accident in diving,\r\nwhich had for the moment deprived him of his senses. But a discovery\r\nmade by the yacht\xe2\x80\x99s crew pointed straight to a conclusion which struck\r\nthe men, one and all, with the same horror. When the course of their\r\nsearch brought them to the cabin, they found the scuttle bolted, and the\r\ndoor locked on the outside. Had some one closed the cabin, not knowing\r\nhe was there? Setting the panic-stricken condition of the crew out of\r\nthe question, there was no motive for closing the cabin before leaving\r\nthe wreck. But one other conclusion remained. Had some murderous hand\r\npurposely locked the man in, and left him to drown as the water rose\r\nover him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. A murderous hand had locked him in, and left him to drown. That\r\nhand was mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman started up from the table; the doctor shrank from the\r\nbedside. The two looked at the dying wretch, mastered by the same\r\nloathing, chilled by the same dread. He lay there, with his child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead on his breast; abandoned by the sympathies of man, accursed by the\r\njustice of God--he lay there, in the isolation of Cain, and looked back\r\nat them.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the two men rose to their feet, the door leading into\r\nthe next room was shaken heavily on the outer side, and a sound like\r\nthe sound of a fall, striking dull on their ears, silenced them both.\r\nStanding nearest to the door, the doctor opened it, passed through, and\r\nclosed it instantly. Mr. Neal turned his back on the bed, and waited the\r\nevent in silence. The sound, which had failed to awaken the child, had\r\nfailed also to attract the father\xe2\x80\x99s notice. His own words had taken him\r\nfar from all that was passing at his deathbed. His helpless body was\r\nback on the wreck, and the ghost of his lifeless hand was turning the\r\nlock of the cabin door.\r\n\r\nA bell rang in the next room--eager voices talked; hurried footsteps\r\nmoved in it--an interval passed, and the doctor returned. \xe2\x80\x9cWas she\r\nlistening?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mr. Neal, in German. \xe2\x80\x9cThe women are restoring\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor whispered back. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has heard it all. In God\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\nwhat are we to do next?\xe2\x80\x9d Before it was possible to reply, Mr. Armadale\r\nspoke. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s return had roused him to a sense of present things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI refuse to meddle further with your infamous secret,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr.\r\nNeal. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a murderer on your own confession. If that letter is to\r\nbe finished, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask _me_ to hold the pen for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gave me your promise,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply, spoken with the same\r\nimmovable self-possession. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must write for me, or break your word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the moment, Mr. Neal was silenced. There the man lay--sheltered\r\nfrom the execration of his fellow-creatures, under the shadow of\r\nDeath--beyond the reach of all human condemnation, beyond the dread of\r\nall mortal laws; sensitive to nothing but his one last resolution to\r\nfinish the letter addressed to his son.\r\n\r\nMr. Neal drew the doctor aside. \xe2\x80\x9cA word with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in German.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you persist in asserting that he may be speechless before we can\r\nsend to Stuttgart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at his lips,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cand judge for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis lips answered for him: the reading of the narrative had left its\r\nmark on them already. A distortion at the corners of his mouth, which\r\nhad been barely noticeable when Mr. Neal entered the room, was plainly\r\nvisible now. His slow articulation labored more and more painfully with\r\nevery word he uttered. The position was emphatically a terrible one.\r\nAfter a moment more of hesitation, Mr. Neal made a last attempt to\r\nwithdraw from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow my eyes are open,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you dare hold me to an\r\nengagement which you forced on me blindfold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Armadale. \xe2\x80\x9cI leave you to break your word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe look which accompanied that reply stung the Scotchman\xe2\x80\x99s pride to the\r\nquick. When he spoke next, he spoke seated in his former place at the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo man ever yet said of me that I broke my word,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, angrily;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand not even you shall say it of me now. Mind this! If you hold me to\r\nmy promise, I hold you to my condition. I have reserved my freedom of\r\naction, and I warn you I will use it at my own sole discretion, as soon\r\nas I am released from the sight of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember he is dying,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded the doctor, gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake your place, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Neal, pointing to the empty chair.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat remains to be read, I will only read in your hearing. What remains\r\nto be written, I will only write in your presence. _You_ brought me\r\nhere. I have a right to insist--and I do insist--on your remaining as a\r\nwitness to the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor accepted his position without remonstrance. Mr. Neal returned\r\nto the manuscript, and read what remained of it uninterruptedly to the\r\nend:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout a word in my own defense, I have acknowledged my guilt. Without\r\na word in my own defense, I will reveal how the crime was committed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thought of him was in my mind, when I saw his wife insensible on the\r\ndeck of the timber-ship. I did my part in lowering her safely into the\r\nboat. Then, and not till then, I felt the thought of him coming back. In\r\nthe confusion that prevailed while the men of the yacht were forcing the\r\nmen of the ship to wait their time, I had an opportunity of searching\r\nfor him unobserved. I stepped back from the bulwark, not knowing whether\r\nhe was away in the first boat, or whether he was still on board--I\r\nstepped back, and saw him mount the cabin stairs empty-handed, with the\r\nwater dripping from him. After looking eagerly toward the boat (without\r\nnoticing me), he saw there was time to spare before the crew were taken.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Once more!\xe2\x80\x99 he said to himself--and disappeared again, to make a last\r\neffort at recovering the jewel box. The devil at my elbow whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot him like a man: drown him like a dog!\xe2\x80\x99 He was under water\r\nwhen I bolted the scuttle. But his head rose to the surface before I\r\ncould close the cabin door. I looked at him, and he looked at me--and I\r\nlocked the door in his face. The next minute, I was back among the last\r\nmen left on deck. The minute after, it was too late to repent. The storm\r\nwas threatening us with destruction, and the boat\xe2\x80\x99s crew were pulling\r\nfor their lives from the ship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son! I have pursued you from my grave with a confession which my\r\nlove might have spared you. Read on, and you will know why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say nothing of my sufferings; I will plead for no mercy to my\r\nmemory. There is a strange sinking at my heart, a strange trembling in\r\nmy hand, while I write these lines, which warns me to hasten to the end.\r\nI left the island without daring to look for the last time at the woman\r\nwhom I had lost so miserably, whom I had injured so vilely. When I left,\r\nthe whole weight of the suspicion roused by the manner of Ingleby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath rested on the crew of the French vessel. No motive for the\r\nsupposed murder could be brought home to any of them; but they were\r\nknown to be, for the most part, outlawed ruffians capable of any crime,\r\nand they were suspected and examined accordingly. It was not till\r\nafterward that I heard by accident of the suspicion shifting round at\r\nlast to me. The widow alone recognized the vague description given\r\nof the strange man who had made one of the yacht\xe2\x80\x99s crew, and who had\r\ndisappeared the day afterward. The widow alone knew, from that time\r\nforth, why her husband had been murdered, and who had done the deed.\r\nWhen she made that discovery, a false report of my death had been\r\npreviously circulated in the island. Perhaps I was indebted to the\r\nreport for my immunity from all legal proceedings; perhaps (no eye but\r\nIngleby\xe2\x80\x99s having seen me lock the cabin door) there was not evidence\r\nenough to justify an inquiry; perhaps the widow shrank from the\r\ndisclosures which must have followed a public charge against me, based\r\non her own bare suspicion of the truth. However it might be, the crime\r\nwhich I had committed unseen has remained a crime unpunished from that\r\ntime to this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left Madeira for the West Indies in disguise. The first news that met\r\nme when the ship touched at Barbadoes was the news of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\nI had no heart to return to the old scenes. The prospect of living at\r\nhome in solitude, with the torment of my own guilty remembrances gnawing\r\nat me day and night, was more than I had the courage to confront.\r\nWithout landing, or discovering myself to any one on shore, I went on as\r\nfar as the ship would take me--to the island of Trinidad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt that place I first saw your mother. It was my duty to tell her the\r\ntruth--and I treacherously kept my secret. It was my duty to spare\r\nher the hopeless sacrifice of her freedom and her happiness to such an\r\nexistence as mine--and I did her the injury of marrying her. If she is\r\nalive when you read this, grant her the mercy of still concealing the\r\ntruth. The one atonement I can make to her is to keep her unsuspicious\r\nto the last of the man she has married. Pity her, as I have pitied her.\r\nLet this letter be a sacred confidence between father and son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time when you were born was the time when my health began to give\r\nway. Some months afterward, in the first days of my recovery, you were\r\nbrought to me; and I was told that you had been christened during\r\nmy illness. Your mother had done as other loving mothers do--she had\r\nchristened her first-born by his father\xe2\x80\x99s name. You, too, were Allan\r\nArmadale. Even in that early time--even while I was happily ignorant of\r\nwhat I have discovered since--my mind misgave me when I looked at you,\r\nand thought of that fatal name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I could be moved, my presence was required at my estates in\r\nBarbadoes. It crossed my mind--wild as the idea may appear to you--to\r\nrenounce the condition which compelled my son as well as myself to take\r\nthe Armadale name, or lose the succession to the Armadale property.\r\nBut, even in those days, the rumor of a contemplated emancipation of\r\nthe slaves--the emancipation which is now close at hand--was spreading\r\nwidely in the colony. No man could tell how the value of West Indian\r\nproperty might be affected if that threatened change ever took place.\r\nNo man could tell--if I gave you back my own paternal name, and left you\r\nwithout other provision in the future than my own paternal estate--how\r\nyou might one day miss the broad Armadale acres, or to what future\r\npenury I might be blindly condemning your mother and yourself. Mark how\r\nthe fatalities gathered one on the other! Mark how your Christian name\r\ncame to you, how your surname held to you, in spite of me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy health had improved in my old home--but it was for a time only. I\r\nsank again, and the doctors ordered me to Europe. Avoiding England (why,\r\nyou may guess), I took my passage, with you and your mother, for France.\r\nFrom France we passed into Italy. We lived here; we lived there. It was\r\nuseless. Death had got met and Death followed me, go where I might. I\r\nbore it, for I had an alleviation to turn to which I had not deserved.\r\nYou may shrink in horror from the very memory of me now. In those days,\r\nyou comforted me. The only warmth I still felt at my heart was the\r\nwarmth you brought to it. My last glimpses of happiness in this world\r\nwere the glimpses given me by my infant son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe removed from Italy, and went next to Lausanne--the place from which\r\nI am now writing to you. The post of this morning has brought me news,\r\nlater and fuller than any I had received thus far, of the widow of the\r\nmurdered man. The letter lies before me while I write. It comes from a\r\nfriend of my early days, who has seen her, and spoken to her--who has\r\nbeen the first to inform her that the report of my death in Madeira was\r\nfalse. He writes, at a loss to account for the violent agitation which\r\nshe showed on hearing that I was still alive, that I was married, and\r\nthat I had an infant son. He asks me if I can explain it. He speaks in\r\nterms of sympathy for her--a young and beautiful woman, buried in the\r\nretirement of a fishing-village on the Devonshire coast; her father\r\ndead; her family estranged from her, in merciless disapproval of her\r\nmarriage. He writes words which might have cut me to the heart, but for\r\na closing passage in his letter, which seized my whole attention the\r\ninstant I came to it, and which has forced from me the narrative that\r\nthese pages contain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI now know what never even entered my mind as a suspicion till the\r\nletter reached me. I now know that the widow of the man whose death lies\r\nat my door has borne a posthumous child. That child is a boy--a year\r\nolder than my own son. Secure in her belief in my death, his mother\r\nhas done what my son\xe2\x80\x99s mother did: she has christened her child by his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s name. Again, in the second generation, there are two Allan\r\nArmadales as there were in the first. After working its deadly mischief\r\nwith the fathers, the fatal resemblance of names has descended to work\r\nits deadly mischief with the sons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuiltless minds may see nothing thus far but the result of a series of\r\nevents which could lead no other way. I--with that man\xe2\x80\x99s life to answer\r\nfor--I, going down into my grave, with my crime unpunished and unatoned,\r\nsee what no guiltless minds can discern. I see danger in the future,\r\nbegotten of the danger in the past--treachery that is the offspring of\r\n_his_ treachery, and crime that is the child of _my_ crime. Is the dread\r\nthat now shakes me to the soul a phantom raised by the superstition of a\r\ndying man? I look into the Book which all Christendom venerates, and the\r\nBook tells me that the sin of the father shall be visited on the child.\r\nI look out into the world, and I see the living witnesses round me to\r\nthat terrible truth. I see the vices which have contaminated the father\r\ndescending, and contaminating the child; I see the shame which has\r\ndisgraced the father\xe2\x80\x99s name descending, and disgracing the child\xe2\x80\x99s. I\r\nlook in on myself, and I see my crime ripening again for the future\r\nin the self-same circumstance which first sowed the seeds of it in the\r\npast, and descending, in inherited contamination of evil, from me to my\r\nson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAt those lines the writing ended. There the stroke had struck him, and\r\nthe pen had dropped from his hand.\r\n\r\nHe knew the place; he remembered the words. At the instant when the\r\nreader\xe2\x80\x99s voice stopped, he looked eagerly at the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\ngot what comes next in my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with slower and slower\r\narticulation. \xe2\x80\x9cHelp me to speak it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor administered a stimulant, and signed to Mr. Neal to give him\r\ntime. After a little delay, the flame of the sinking spirit leaped up\r\nin his eyes once more. Resolutely struggling with his failing speech,\r\nhe summoned the Scotchman to take the pen, and pronounced the closing\r\nsentences of the narrative, as his memory gave them back to him, one by\r\none, in these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDespise my dying conviction if you will, but grant me, I solemnly\r\nimplore you, one last request. My son! the only hope I have left for\r\nyou hangs on a great doubt--the doubt whether we are, or are not,\r\nthe masters of our own destinies. It may be that mortal free-will can\r\nconquer mortal fate; and that going, as we all do, inevitably to death,\r\nwe go inevitably to nothing that is before death. If this be so, indeed,\r\nrespect--though you respect nothing else--the warning which I give you\r\nfrom my grave. Never, to your dying day, let any living soul approach\r\nyou who is associated, directly or indirectly, with the crime which your\r\nfather has committed. Avoid the widow of the man I killed--if the widow\r\nstill lives. Avoid the maid whose wicked hand smoothed the way to the\r\nmarriage--if the maid is still in her service. And more than all,\r\navoid the man who bears the same name as your own. Offend your best\r\nbenefactor, if that benefactor\xe2\x80\x99s influence has connected you one with\r\nthe other. Desert the woman who loves you, if that woman is a link\r\nbetween you and him. Hide yourself from him under an assumed name. Put\r\nthe mountains and the seas between you; be ungrateful, be unforgiving;\r\nbe all that is most repellent to your own gentler nature, rather than\r\nlive under the same roof, and breathe the same air, with that man. Never\r\nlet the two Allan Armadales meet in this world: never, never, never!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere lies the way by which you may escape--if any way there be. Take\r\nit, if you prize your own innocence and your own happiness, through all\r\nyour life to come!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done. If I could have trusted any weaker influence than the\r\ninfluence of this confession to incline you to my will, I would have\r\nspared you the disclosure which these pages contain. You are lying on my\r\nbreast, sleeping the innocent sleep of a child, while a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nwrites these words for you as they fall from my lips. Think what the\r\nstrength of my conviction must be, when I can find the courage, on my\r\ndeath-bed, to darken all your young life at its outset with the shadow\r\nof your father\xe2\x80\x99s crime. Think, and be warned. Think, and forgive me if\r\nyou can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThere it ended. Those were the father\xe2\x80\x99s last words to the son.\r\n\r\nInexorably faithful to his forced duty, Mr. Neal laid aside the pen, and\r\nread over aloud the lines he had just written. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there more to add?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he asked, with his pitilessly steady voice. There was no more to add.\r\n\r\nMr. Neal folded the manuscript, inclosed it in a sheet of paper, and\r\nsealed it with Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s own seal. \xe2\x80\x9cThe address?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with his\r\nmerciless business formality. \xe2\x80\x9cTo Allan Armadale, junior,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, as\r\nthe words were dictated from the bed. \xe2\x80\x9cCare of Godfrey Hammick, Esq.,\r\nOffices of Messrs. Hammick and Ridge, Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields, London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Having written the address, he waited, and considered for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nyour executor to open this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! he is to give it to my son when my son is of an age to understand\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr. Neal, with all his wits in remorseless\r\nworking order, \xe2\x80\x9cI will add a dated note to the address, repeating your\r\nown words as you have just spoken them, and explaining the circumstances\r\nunder which my handwriting appears on the document.\xe2\x80\x9d He wrote the note\r\nin the briefest and plainest terms, read it over aloud as he had read\r\nover what went before, signed his name and address at the end, and made\r\nthe doctor sign next, as witness of the proceedings, and as medical\r\nevidence of the condition in which Mr. Armadale then lay. This done,\r\nhe placed the letter in a second inclosure, sealed it as before, and\r\ndirected it to Mr. Hammick, with the superscription of \xe2\x80\x9cprivate\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nto the address. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you insist on my posting this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, rising\r\nwith the letter in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him time to think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the child\xe2\x80\x99s sake, give\r\nhim time to think! A minute may change him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give him five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Neal, placing his watch on\r\nthe table, implacable just to the very last.\r\n\r\nThey waited, both looking attentively at Mr. Armadale. The signs of\r\nchange which had appeared in him already were multiplying fast. The\r\nmovement which continued mental agitation had communicated to the\r\nmuscles of his face was beginning, under the same dangerous influence,\r\nto spread downward. His once helpless hands lay still no longer; they\r\nstruggled pitiably on the bedclothes. At sight of that warning token,\r\nthe doctor turned with a gesture of alarm, and beckoned Mr. Neal to\r\ncome nearer. \xe2\x80\x9cPut the question at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cif you let the five\r\nminutes pass, you may be too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Neal approached the bed. He, too, noticed the movement of the hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a bad sign?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe doctor bent his head gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cPut your question at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated, \xe2\x80\x9cor you may be too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Neal held the letter before the eyes of the dying man \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know\r\nwhat this is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you insist on my posting it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe mastered his failing speech for the last time, and gave the answer:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Neal moved to the door, with the letter in his hand. The German\r\nfollowed him a few steps, opened his lips to plead for a longer delay,\r\nmet the Scotchman\xe2\x80\x99s inexorable eye, and drew back again in silence.\r\nThe door closed and parted them, without a word having passed on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe doctor went back to the bed and whispered to the sinking man: \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nme call him back; there is time to stop him yet!\xe2\x80\x9d It was useless. No\r\nanswer came; nothing showed that he heeded, or even heard. His eyes\r\nwandered from the child, rested for a moment on his own struggling hand,\r\nand looked up entreatingly in the compassionate face that bent over him.\r\nThe doctor lifted the hand, paused, followed the father\xe2\x80\x99s longing eyes\r\nback to the child, and, interpreting his last wish, moved the hand\r\ngently toward the boy\xe2\x80\x99s head. The hand touched it, and trembled\r\nviolently. In another instant the trembling seized on the arm, and\r\nspread over the whole upper part of the body. The face turned from pale\r\nto red, from red to purple, from purple to pale again. Then the toiling\r\nhands lay still, and the shifting color changed no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe window of the next room was open, when the doctor entered it from\r\nthe death chamber, with the child in his arms. He looked out as he\r\npassed by, and saw Mr. Neal in the street below, slowly returning to the\r\ninn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThree words sufficed for the Scotchman\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE PROLOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE MYSTERY OF OZIAS MIDWINTER.\r\n\r\nON a warm May night, in the year eighteen hundred and fifty-one,\r\nthe Reverend Decimus Brock--at that time a visitor to the Isle of\r\nMan--retired to his bedroom at Castletown, with a serious personal\r\nresponsibility in close pursuit of him, and with no distinct idea of the\r\nmeans by which he might relieve himself from the pressure of his present\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman had reached that mature period of human life at which a\r\nsensible man learns to decline (as often as his temper will let him) all\r\nuseless conflict with the tyranny of his own troubles. Abandoning any\r\nfurther effort to reach a decision in the emergency that now beset him,\r\nMr. Brock sat down placidly in his shirt sleeves on the side of his bed,\r\nand applied his mind to consider next whether the emergency itself was\r\nas serious as he had hitherto been inclined to think it. Following this\r\nnew way out of his perplexities, Mr. Brock found himself unexpectedly\r\ntraveling to the end in view by the least inspiriting of all human\r\njourneys--a journey through the past years of his own life.\r\n\r\nOne by one the events of those years--all connected with the same little\r\ngroup of characters, and all more or less answerable for the anxiety\r\nwhich was now intruding itself between the clergyman and his night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrest--rose, in progressive series, on Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s memory. The first of\r\nthe series took him back, through a period of fourteen years, to his own\r\nrectory on the Somersetshire shores of the Bristol Channel, and closeted\r\nhim at a private interview with a lady who had paid him a visit in the\r\ncharacter of a total stranger to the parson and the place.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lady\xe2\x80\x99s complexion was fair, the lady\xe2\x80\x99s figure was well preserved;\r\nshe was still a young woman, and she looked even younger than her age.\r\nThere was a shade of melancholy in her expression, and an undertone of\r\nsuffering in her voice--enough, in each case, to indicate that she had\r\nknown trouble, but not enough to obtrude that trouble on the notice of\r\nothers. She brought with her a fine, fair-haired boy of eight years old,\r\nwhom she presented as her son, and who was sent out of the way, at the\r\nbeginning of the interview, to amuse himself in the rectory garden. Her\r\ncard had preceded her entrance into the study, and had announced her\r\nunder the name of \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brock began to feel interested in\r\nher before she had opened her lips; and when the son had been dismissed,\r\nhe awaited with some anxiety to hear what the mother had to say to him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Armadale began by informing the rector that she was a widow. Her\r\nhusband had perished by shipwreck a short time after their union, on the\r\nvoyage from Madeira to Lisbon. She had been brought to England,\r\nafter her affliction, under her father\xe2\x80\x99s protection; and her child--a\r\nposthumous son--had been born on the family estate in Norfolk. Her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death, shortly afterward, had deprived her of her only\r\nsurviving parent, and had exposed her to neglect and misconstruction on\r\nthe part of her remaining relatives (two brothers), which had estranged\r\nher from them, she feared, for the rest of her days. For some time past\r\nshe had lived in the neighboring county of Devonshire, devoting herself\r\nto the education of her boy, who had now reached an age at which he\r\nrequired other than his mother\xe2\x80\x99s teaching. Leaving out of the question\r\nher own unwillingness to part with him, in her solitary position, she\r\nwas especially anxious that he should not be thrown among strangers by\r\nbeing sent to school. Her darling project was to bring him up privately\r\nat home, and to keep him, as he advanced in years, from all contact with\r\nthe temptations and the dangers of the world.\r\n\r\nWith these objects in view, her longer sojourn in her own locality\r\n(where the services of the resident clergyman, in the capacity of tutor,\r\nwere not obtainable) must come to an end. She had made inquiries, had\r\nheard of a house that would suit her in Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhood, and\r\nhad also been told that Mr. Brock himself had formerly been in the habit\r\nof taking pupils. Possessed of this information, she had ventured to\r\npresent herself, with references that vouched for her respectability,\r\nbut without a formal introduction; and she had now to ask whether (in\r\nthe event of her residing in the neighborhood) any terms that could be\r\noffered would induce Mr. Brock to open his doors once more to a pupil,\r\nand to allow that pupil to be her son.\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. Armadale had been a woman of no personal attractions, or if\r\nMr. Brock had been provided with an intrenchment to fight behind in the\r\nshape of a wife, it is probable that the widow\xe2\x80\x99s journey might have been\r\ntaken in vain. As things really were, the rector examined the references\r\nwhich were offered to him, and asked time for consideration. When the\r\ntime had expired, he did what Mrs. Armadale wished him to do--he\r\noffered his back to the burden, and let the mother load him with the\r\nresponsibility of the son.\r\n\r\nThis was the first event of the series; the date of it being the year\r\neighteen hundred and thirty-seven. Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s memory, traveling forward\r\ntoward the present from that point, picked up the second event in its\r\nturn, and stopped next at the year eighteen hundred and forty-five.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe fishing-village on the Somersetshire coast was still the scene, and\r\nthe characters were once again--Mrs. Armadale and her son.\r\n\r\nThrough the eight years that had passed, Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility had\r\nrested on him lightly enough. The boy had given his mother and his tutor\r\nbut little trouble. He was certainly slow over his books, but more from\r\na constitutional inability to fix his attention on his tasks than from\r\nwant of capacity to understand them. His temperament, it could not be\r\ndenied, was heedless to the last degree: he acted recklessly on his\r\nfirst impulses, and rushed blindfold at all his conclusions. On the\r\nother hand, it was to be said in his favor that his disposition was open\r\nas the day; a more generous, affectionate, sweet-tempered lad it\r\nwould have been hard to find anywhere. A certain quaint originality of\r\ncharacter, and a natural healthiness in all his tastes, carried him\r\nfree of most of the dangers to which his mother\xe2\x80\x99s system of education\r\ninevitably exposed him. He had a thoroughly English love of the sea and\r\nof all that belongs to it; and as he grew in years, there was no\r\nluring him away from the water-side, and no keeping him out of the\r\nboat-builder\xe2\x80\x99s yard. In course of time his mother caught him actually\r\nworking there, to her infinite annoyance and surprise, as a volunteer.\r\nHe acknowledged that his whole future ambition was to have a yard of his\r\nown, and that his one present object was to learn to build a boat for\r\nhimself. Wisely foreseeing that such a pursuit as this for his leisure\r\nhours was exactly what was wanted to reconcile the lad to a position of\r\nisolation from companions of his own rank and age, Mr. Brock prevailed\r\non Mrs. Armadale, with no small difficulty, to let her son have his\r\nway. At the period of that second event in the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s life with\r\nhis pupil which is now to be related, young Armadale had practiced long\r\nenough in the builder\xe2\x80\x99s yard to have reached the summit of his wishes,\r\nby laying with his own hands the keel of his own boat.\r\n\r\nLate on a certain summer day, not long after Allan had completed his\r\nsixteenth year, Mr. Brock left his pupil hard at work in the yard,\r\nand went to spend the evening with Mrs. Armadale, taking the _Times_\r\nnewspaper with him in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe years that had passed since they had first met had long since\r\nregulated the lives of the clergyman and his neighbor. The first\r\nadvances which Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s growing admiration for the widow had led him\r\nto make in the early days of their intercourse had been met on her\r\nside by an appeal to his forbearance which had closed his lips for the\r\nfuture. She had satisfied him, at once and forever, that the one place\r\nin her heart which he could hope to occupy was the place of a friend.\r\nHe loved her well enough to take what she would give him: friends they\r\nbecame, and friends they remained from that time forth. No jealous\r\ndread of another man\xe2\x80\x99s succeeding where he had failed imbittered the\r\nclergyman\xe2\x80\x99s placid relations with the woman whom he loved. Of the few\r\nresident gentlemen in the neighborhood, none were ever admitted by Mrs.\r\nArmadale to more than the merest acquaintance with her. Contentedly\r\nself-buried in her country retreat, she was proof against every social\r\nattraction that would have tempted other women in her position and\r\nat her age. Mr. Brock and his newspaper, appearing with monotonous\r\nregularity at her tea-table three times a week, told her all she knew\r\nor cared to know of the great outer world which circled round the narrow\r\nand changeless limits of her daily life.\r\n\r\nOn the evening in question Mr. Brock took the arm-chair in which he\r\nalways sat, accepted the one cup of tea which he always drank, and\r\nopened the newspaper which he always read aloud to Mrs. Armadale, who\r\ninvariably listened to him reclining on the same sofa, with the same\r\nsort of needle-work everlastingly in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the rector, with his voice in a new octave, and\r\nhis eyes fixed in astonishment on the first page of the newspaper.\r\n\r\nNo such introduction to the evening readings as this had ever happened\r\nbefore in all Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s experience as a listener. She looked\r\nup from the sofa in a flutter of curiosity, and besought her reverend\r\nfriend to favor her with an explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can hardly believe my own eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is an\r\nadvertisement, Mrs. Armadale, addressed to your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout further preface, he read the advertisement as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nIF this should meet the eye of ALLAN ARMADALE, he is desired to\r\ncommunicate, either personally or by letter, with Messrs. Hammick and\r\nRidge (Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields, London), on business of importance which\r\nseriously concerns him. Any one capable of informing Messrs. H. and R.\r\nwhere the person herein advertised can be found would confer a favor\r\nby doing the same. To prevent mistakes, it is further notified that\r\nthe missing Allan Armadale is a youth aged fifteen years, and that this\r\nadvertisement is inserted at the instance of his family and friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother family, and other friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Armadale. \xe2\x80\x9cThe person\r\nwhose name appears in that advertisement is not my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone in which she spoke surprised Mr. Brock. The change in her face,\r\nwhen he looked up, shocked him. Her delicate complexion had faded away\r\nto a dull white; her eyes were averted from her visitor with a strange\r\nmixture of confusion and alarm; she looked an older woman than she was,\r\nby ten good years at least.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe name is so very uncommon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock, imagining he had\r\noffended her, and trying to excuse himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really seemed impossible\r\nthere could be two persons--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere _are_ two,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs. Armadale. \xe2\x80\x9cAllan, as you know, is\r\nsixteen years old. If you look back at the advertisement, you will find\r\nthe missing person described as being only fifteen. Although he bears\r\nthe same surname and the same Christian name, he is, I thank God, in no\r\nway whatever related to my son. As long as I live, it will be the object\r\nof my hopes and prayers that Allan may never see him, may never even\r\nhear of him. My kind friend, I see I surprise you: will you bear with\r\nme if I leave these strange circumstances unexplained? There is past\r\nmisfortune and misery in my early life too painful for me to speak of,\r\neven to _you_. Will you help me to bear the remembrance of it, by never\r\nreferring to this again? Will you do even more--will you promise not to\r\nspeak of it to Allan, and not to let that newspaper fall in his way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brock gave the pledge required of him, and considerately left her to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThe rector had been too long and too truly attached to Mrs. Armadale to\r\nbe capable of regarding her with any unworthy distrust. But it would be\r\nidle to deny that he felt disappointed by her want of confidence in him,\r\nand that he looked inquisitively at the advertisement more than once on\r\nhis way back to his own house.\r\n\r\nIt was clear enough, now, that Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s motives for burying her\r\nson as well as herself in the seclusion of a remote country village was\r\nnot so much to keep him under her own eye as to keep him from discovery\r\nby his namesake. Why did she dread the idea of their ever meeting? Was\r\nit a dread for herself, or a dread for her son? Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s loyal belief\r\nin his friend rejected any solution of the difficulty which pointed at\r\nsome past misconduct of Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s. That night he destroyed the\r\nadvertisement with his own hand; that night he resolved that the subject\r\nshould never be suffered to enter his mind again. There was another\r\nAllan Armadale about the world, a stranger to his pupil\xe2\x80\x99s blood, and\r\na vagabond advertised in the public newspapers. So much accident had\r\nrevealed to him. More, for Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s sake, he had no wish to\r\ndiscover--and more he would never seek to know.\r\n\r\nThis was the second in the series of events which dated from the\r\nrector\xe2\x80\x99s connection with Mrs. Armadale and her son. Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s memory,\r\ntraveling on nearer and nearer to present circumstances, reached the\r\nthird stage of its journey through the by-gone time, and stopped at the\r\nyear eighteen hundred and fifty, next.\r\n\r\nThe five years that had passed had made little if any change in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter. He had simply developed (to use his tutor\xe2\x80\x99s own expression)\r\nfrom a boy of sixteen to a boy of twenty-one. He was just as easy and\r\nopen in his disposition as ever; just as quaintly and inveterately\r\ngood-humored; just as heedless in following his own impulses, lead him\r\nwhere they might. His bias toward the sea had strengthened with his\r\nadvance to the years of manhood. From building a boat, he had now got\r\non--with two journeymen at work under him--to building a decked vessel\r\nof five-and-thirty tons. Mr. Brock had conscientiously tried to divert\r\nhim to higher aspirations; had taken him to Oxford, to see what college\r\nlife was like; had taken him to London, to expand his mind by the\r\nspectacle of the great metropolis. The change had diverted Allan, but\r\nhad not altered him in the least. He was as impenetrably superior to\r\nall worldly ambition as Diogenes himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich is best,\xe2\x80\x9d asked this\r\nunconscious philosopher, \xe2\x80\x9cto find out the way to be happy for yourself,\r\nor to let other people try if they can find it out for you?\xe2\x80\x9d From that\r\nmoment Mr. Brock permitted his pupil\xe2\x80\x99s character to grow at its own rate\r\nof development, and Allan went on uninterruptedly with the work of his\r\nyacht.\r\n\r\nTime, which had wrought so little change in the son, had not passed\r\nharmless over the mother.\r\n\r\nMrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s health was breaking fast. As her strength failed, her\r\ntemper altered for the worse: she grew more and more fretful, more and\r\nmore subject to morbid fears and fancies, more and more reluctant to\r\nleave her own room. Since the appearance of the advertisement five years\r\nsince, nothing had happened to force her memory back to the painful\r\nassociations connected with her early life. No word more on the\r\nforbidden topic had passed between the rector and herself; no suspicion\r\nhad ever been raised in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mind of the existence of his namesake;\r\nand yet, without the shadow of a reason for any special anxiety, Mrs.\r\nArmadale had become, of late years, obstinately and fretfully uneasy\r\non the subject of her son. More than once Mr. Brock dreaded a serious\r\ndisagreement between them; but Allan\xe2\x80\x99s natural sweetness of temper,\r\nfortified by his love for his mother, carried him triumphantly through\r\nall trials. Not a hard word or a harsh look ever escaped him in her\r\npresence; he was unchangeably loving and forbearing with her to the very\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nSuch were the positions of the son, the mother, and the friend, when\r\nthe next notable event happened in the lives of the three. On a dreary\r\nafternoon, early in the month of November, Mr. Brock was disturbed\r\nover the composition of his sermon by a visit from the landlord of the\r\nvillage inn.\r\n\r\nAfter making his introductory apologies, the landlord stated the urgent\r\nbusiness on which he had come to the rectory clearly enough.\r\n\r\nA few hours since a young man had been brought to the inn by some farm\r\nlaborers in the neighborhood, who had found him wandering about one of\r\ntheir master\xe2\x80\x99s fields in a disordered state of mind, which looked to\r\ntheir eyes like downright madness. The landlord had given the poor\r\ncreature shelter while he sent for medical help; and the doctor, on\r\nseeing him, had pronounced that he was suffering from fever on the\r\nbrain, and that his removal to the nearest town at which a hospital or\r\na work-house infirmary could be found to receive him would in all\r\nprobability be fatal to his chances of recovery. After hearing this\r\nexpression of opinion, and after observing for himself that the\r\nstranger\xe2\x80\x99s only luggage consisted of a small carpet-bag which had been\r\nfound in the field near him, the landlord had set off on the spot to\r\nconsult the rector, and to ask, in this serious emergency, what course\r\nhe was to take next.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock was the magistrate as well as the clergyman of the district,\r\nand the course to be taken, in the first instance, was to his mind clear\r\nenough. He put on his hat, and accompanied the landlord back to the inn.\r\n\r\nAt the inn door they were joined by Allan, who had heard the news\r\nthrough another channel, and who was waiting Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, to\r\nfollow in the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s train, and to see what the stranger was like.\r\nThe village surgeon joined them at the same moment, and the four went\r\ninto the inn together.\r\n\r\nThey found the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s son on one side, and the hostler on the other,\r\nholding the man down in his chair. Young, slim, and undersized, he was\r\nstrong enough at that moment to make it a matter of difficulty for the\r\ntwo to master him. His tawny complexion, his large, bright brown eyes,\r\nand his black beard gave him something of a foreign look. His dress was\r\na little worn, but his linen was clean. His dusky hands were wiry and\r\nnervous, and were lividly discolored in more places than one by the\r\nscars of old wounds. The toes of one of his feet, off which he had\r\nkicked the shoe, grasped at the chair rail through his stocking, with\r\nthe sensitive muscular action which is only seen in those who have been\r\naccustomed to go barefoot. In the frenzy that now possessed him, it was\r\nimpossible to notice, to any useful purpose, more than this. After\r\na whispered consultation with Mr. Brock, the surgeon personally\r\nsuperintended the patient\xe2\x80\x99s removal to a quiet bedroom at the back of\r\nthe house. Shortly afterward his clothes and his carpet-bag were sent\r\ndownstairs, and were searched, on the chance of finding a clew by which\r\nto communicate with his friends, in the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\r\n\r\nThe carpet-bag contained nothing but a change of clothing, and two\r\nbooks--the Plays of Sophocles, in the original Greek, and the \xe2\x80\x9cFaust\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nGoethe, in the original German. Both volumes were much worn by reading,\r\nand on the fly-leaf of each were inscribed the initials O. M. So much\r\nthe bag revealed, and no more.\r\n\r\nThe clothes which the man wore when he was discovered in the field were\r\ntried next. A purse (containing a sovereign and a few shillings), a\r\npipe, a tobacco pouch, a handkerchief, and a little drinking-cup of horn\r\nwere produced in succession. The next object, and the last, was found\r\ncrumpled up carelessly in the breast-pocket of the coat. It was a\r\nwritten testimonial to character, dated and signed, but without any\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nSo far as this document could tell it, the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s story was a sad\r\none indeed. He had apparently been employed for a short time as usher at\r\na school, and had been turned adrift in the world, at the outset of his\r\nillness, from the fear that the fever might be infectious, and that\r\nthe prosperity of the establishment might suffer accordingly. Not the\r\nslightest imputation of any misbehavior in his employment rested on him.\r\nOn the contrary, the schoolmaster had great pleasure in testifying to\r\nhis capacity and his character, and in expressing a fervent hope that\r\nhe might (under Providence) succeed in recovering his health in somebody\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s house. The written testimonial which afforded this glimpse at the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s story served one purpose more: it connected him with the initials\r\non the books, and identified him to the magistrate and the landlord\r\nunder the strangely uncouth name of Ozias Midwinter.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock laid aside the testimonial, suspecting that the schoolmaster\r\nhad purposely abstained from writing his address on it, with the view\r\nof escaping all responsibility in the event of his usher\xe2\x80\x99s death. In any\r\ncase, it was manifestly useless, under existing circumstances, to think\r\nof tracing the poor wretch\xe2\x80\x99s friends, if friends he had. To the inn he\r\nhad been brought, and, as a matter of common humanity, at the inn he\r\nmust remain for the present. The difficulty about expenses, if it came\r\nto the worst, might possibly be met by charitable contributions from\r\nthe neighbors, or by a collection after a sermon at church. Assuring the\r\nlandlord that he would consider this part of the question and would let\r\nhim know the result, Mr. Brock quitted the inn, without noticing for the\r\nmoment that he had left Allan there behind him.\r\n\r\nBefore he had got fifty yards from the house his pupil overtook him.\r\nAllan had been most uncharacteristically silent and serious all through\r\nthe search at the inn; but he had now recovered his usual high spirits.\r\nA stranger would have set him down as wanting in common feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a sad business,\xe2\x80\x9d said the rector. \xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to\r\ndo for the best about that unfortunate man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may make your mind quite easy, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Armadale, in his\r\noff-hand way. \xe2\x80\x9cI settled it all with the landlord a minute ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Brock, in the utmost astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have merely given a few simple directions,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cOur\r\nfriend the usher is to have everything he requires, and is to be treated\r\nlike a prince; and when the doctor and the landlord want their money\r\nthey are to come to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Allan,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brock gently remonstrated, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen will you learn\r\nto think before you act on those generous impulses of yours? You\r\nare spending more money already on your yacht-building than you can\r\nafford--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly think! we laid the first planks of the deck the day before\r\nyesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, flying off to the new subject in his usual\r\nbird-witted way. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s just enough of it done to walk on, if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t feel giddy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you up the ladder, Mr. Brock, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only\r\ncome and try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted the rector. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about the\r\nyacht now; that is to say, I am only referring to the yacht as an\r\nillustration--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a very pretty illustration, too,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the incorrigible Allan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind me a smarter little vessel of her size in all England, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll give up yacht-building to-morrow. Whereabouts were we in our\r\nconversation, sir? I\xe2\x80\x99m rather afraid we have lost ourselves somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am rather afraid one of us is in the habit of losing himself every\r\ntime he opens his lips,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Brock. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Allan, this is\r\nserious. You have been rendering yourself liable for expenses which you\r\nmay not be able to pay. Mind, I am far from blaming you for your kind\r\nfeeling toward this poor friendless man--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be low-spirited about him, sir. He\xe2\x80\x99ll get over it--he\xe2\x80\x99ll be all\r\nright again in a week or so. A capital fellow, I have not the least\r\ndoubt!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Allan, whose habit it was to believe in everybody and\r\nto despair of nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you ask him to dinner when he gets well,\r\nMr. Brock? I should like to find out (when we are all three snug\r\nand friendly together over our wine, you know) how he came by that\r\nextraordinary name of his. Ozias Midwinter! Upon my life, his father\r\nought to be ashamed of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you answer me one question before I go in?\xe2\x80\x9d said the rector,\r\nstopping in despair at his own gate. \xe2\x80\x9cThis man\xe2\x80\x99s bill for lodging and\r\nmedical attendance may mount to twenty or thirty pounds before he gets\r\nwell again, if he ever does get well. How are you to pay for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that the Chancellor of the Exchequer says when he finds himself\r\nin a mess with his accounts, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see his way out again?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nAllan. \xe2\x80\x9cHe always tells his honorable friend he is quite willing to\r\nleave a something or other--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA margin?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mr. Brock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m like the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nquite willing to leave a margin. The yacht (bless her heart!) doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neat up everything. If I\xe2\x80\x99m short by a pound or two, don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid,\r\nsir. There\xe2\x80\x99s no pride about me; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go round with the hat, and get\r\nthe balance in the neighborhood. Deuce take the pounds, shillings,\r\nand pence! I wish they could all three get rid of themselves, like the\r\nBedouin brothers at the show. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember the Bedouin brothers,\r\nMr. Brock? \xe2\x80\x98Ali will take a lighted torch, and jump down the throat\r\nof his brother Muli; Muli will take a lighted torch, and jump down the\r\nthroat of his brother Hassan; and Hassan, taking a third lighted torch,\r\nwill conclude the performances by jumping down his own throat, and\r\nleaving the spectators in total darkness.\xe2\x80\x99 Wonderfully good, that--what\r\nI call real wit, with a fine strong flavor about it. Wait a minute!\r\nWhere are we? We have lost ourselves again. Oh, I remember--money. What\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t beat into my thick head,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Allan, quite unconscious\r\nthat he was preaching socialist doctrines to a clergyman; \xe2\x80\x9cis the\r\nmeaning of the fuss that\xe2\x80\x99s made about giving money away. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\npeople who have got money to spare give it to the people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nmoney to spare, and make things pleasant and comfortable all the world\r\nover in that way? You\xe2\x80\x99re always telling me to cultivate ideas, Mr. Brock\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s an idea, and, upon my life, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brock gave his pupil a good-humored poke with the end of his stick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back to your yacht,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the little discretion you have\r\ngot in that flighty head of yours is left on board in your tool-chest.\r\nHow that lad will end,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the rector, when he was left by himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis more than any human being can say. I almost wish I had never taken\r\nthe responsibility of him on my shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree weeks passed before the stranger with the uncouth name was\r\npronounced to be at last on the way to recovery.\r\n\r\nDuring this period Allan had made regular inquiries at the inn, and, as\r\nsoon as the sick man was allowed to see visitors, Allan was the first\r\nwho appeared at his bedside. So far Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s pupil had shown no more\r\nthan a natural interest in one of the few romantic circumstances\r\nwhich had varied the monotony of the village life: he had committed\r\nno imprudence, and he had exposed himself to no blame. But as the\r\ndays passed, young Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s visits to the inn began to lengthen\r\nconsiderably, and the surgeon (a cautious elderly man) gave the rector a\r\nprivate hint to bestir himself. Mr. Brock acted on the hint immediately,\r\nand discovered that Allan had followed his usual impulses in his usual\r\nheadlong way. He had taken a violent fancy to the castaway usher and had\r\ninvited Ozias Midwinter to reside permanently in the neighborhood in the\r\nnew and interesting character of his bosom friend.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Brock could make up his mind how to act in this emergency, he\r\nreceived a note from Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mother, begging him to use his privilege as\r\nan old friend, and to pay her a visit in her room.\r\n\r\nHe found Mrs. Armadale suffering under violent nervous agitation, caused\r\nentirely by a recent interview with her son. Allan had been sitting with\r\nher all the morning, and had talked of nothing but his new friend. The\r\nman with the horrible name (as poor Mrs. Armadale described him) had\r\nquestioned Allan, in a singularly inquisitive manner, on the subject of\r\nhimself and his family, but had kept his own personal history entirely\r\nin the dark. At some former period of his life he had been accustomed to\r\nthe sea and to sailing. Allan had, unfortunately, found this out, and\r\na bond of union between them was formed on the spot. With a merciless\r\ndistrust of the stranger--simply _because_ he was a stranger--which\r\nappeared rather unreasonable to Mr. Brock, Mrs. Armadale besought the\r\nrector to go to the inn without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s loss of time, and never to\r\nrest until he had made the man give a proper account of himself. \xe2\x80\x9cFind\r\nout everything about his father and mother!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in her vehement\r\nfemale way. \xe2\x80\x9cMake sure before you leave him that he is not a vagabond\r\nroaming the country under an assumed name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lady,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the rector, obediently taking his hat,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhatever else we may doubt, I really think we may feel sure about the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s name! It is so remarkably ugly that it must be genuine. No sane\r\nhuman being would _assume_ such a name as Ozias Midwinter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be quite right, and I may be quite wrong; but pray go and see\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Mrs. Armadale. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, and don\xe2\x80\x99t spare him, Mr. Brock.\r\nHow do we know that this illness of his may not have been put on for a\r\npurpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was useless to reason with her. The whole College of Physicians might\r\nhave certified to the man\xe2\x80\x99s illness, and, in her present frame of mind,\r\nMrs. Armadale would have disbelieved the College, one and all, from\r\nthe president downward. Mr. Brock took the wise way out of the\r\ndifficulty--he said no more, and he set off for the inn immediately.\r\n\r\nOzias Midwinter, recovering from brain-fever, was a startling object to\r\ncontemplate on a first view of him. His shaven head, tied up in an old\r\nyellow silk handkerchief; his tawny, haggard cheeks; his bright brown\r\neyes, preternaturally large and wild; his rough black beard; his long,\r\nsupple, sinewy fingers, wasted by suffering till they looked like\r\nclaws--all tended to discompose the rector at the outset of the\r\ninterview. When the first feeling of surprise had worn off, the\r\nimpression that followed it was not an agreeable one. Mr. Brock could\r\nnot conceal from himself that the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s manner was against him.\r\nThe general opinion has settled that, if a man is honest, he is bound to\r\nassert it by looking straight at his fellow-creatures when he speaks to\r\nthem. If this man was honest, his eyes showed a singular perversity in\r\nlooking away and denying it. Possibly they were affected in some degree\r\nby a nervous restlessness in his organization, which appeared to pervade\r\nevery fiber in his lean, lithe body. The rector\xe2\x80\x99s healthy Anglo-Saxon\r\nflesh crept responsively at every casual movement of the usher\xe2\x80\x99s supple\r\nbrown fingers, and every passing distortion of the usher\xe2\x80\x99s haggard\r\nyellow face. \xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mr. Brock, with his mind running\r\non Allan and Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mother, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could see my way to turning Ozias\r\nMidwinter adrift in the world again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation which ensued between the two was a very guarded one.\r\nMr. Brock felt his way gently, and found himself, try where he might,\r\nalways kept politely, more or less, in the dark.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last, the man\xe2\x80\x99s real character shrank back with a savage\r\nshyness from the rector\xe2\x80\x99s touch. He started by an assertion which it\r\nwas impossible to look at him and believe--he declared that he was only\r\ntwenty years of age. All he could be persuaded to say on the subject of\r\nthe school was that the bare recollection of it was horrible to him.\r\nHe had only filled the usher\xe2\x80\x99s situation for ten days when the first\r\nappearance of his illness caused his dismissal. How he had reached\r\nthe field in which he had been found was more than he could say. He\r\nremembered traveling a long distance by railway, with a purpose (if he\r\nhad a purpose) which it was now impossible to recall, and then wandering\r\ncoastward, on foot, all through the day, or all through the night--he\r\nwas not sure which. The sea kept running in his mind when his mind began\r\nto give way. He had been employed on the sea as a lad. He had left it,\r\nand had filled a situation at a bookseller\xe2\x80\x99s in a country town. He had\r\nleft the bookseller\xe2\x80\x99s, and had tried the school. Now the school had\r\nturned him out, he must try something else. It mattered little what he\r\ntried--failure (for which nobody was ever to blame but himself) was\r\nsure to be the end of it, sooner or later. Friends to assist him, he\r\nhad none to apply to; and as for relations, he wished to be excused from\r\nspeaking of them. For all he knew they might be dead, and for all _they_\r\nknew _he_ might be dead. That was a melancholy acknowledgment to make at\r\nhis time of life, there was no denying it. It might tell against him in\r\nthe opinions of others; and it did tell against him, no doubt, in the\r\nopinion of the gentleman who was talking to him at that moment.\r\n\r\nThese strange answers were given in a tone and manner far removed from\r\nbitterness on the one side, or from indifference on the other. Ozias\r\nMidwinter at twenty spoke of his life as Ozias Midwinter at seventy\r\nmight have spoken with a long weariness of years on him which he had\r\nlearned to bear patiently.\r\n\r\nTwo circumstances pleaded strongly against the distrust with which, in\r\nsheer perplexity of mind, Mr. Brock blindly regarded him. He had written\r\nto a savings-bank in a distant part of England, had drawn his money, and\r\nhad paid the doctor and the landlord. A man of vulgar mind, after acting\r\nin this manner, would have treated his obligations lightly when he\r\nhad settled his bills. Ozias Midwinter spoke of his obligations--and\r\nespecially of his obligation to Allan--with a fervor of thankfulness\r\nwhich it was not surprising only, but absolutely painful to witness. He\r\nshowed a horrible sincerity of astonishment at having been treated\r\nwith common Christian kindness in a Christian land. He spoke of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhaving become answerable for all the expenses of sheltering, nursing,\r\nand curing him, with a savage rapture of gratitude and surprise which\r\nburst out of him like a flash of lightning. \xe2\x80\x9cSo help me God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\ncastaway usher, \xe2\x80\x9cI never met with the like of him: I never heard of the\r\nlike of him before!\xe2\x80\x9d In the next instant, the one glimpse of light which\r\nthe man had let in on his own passionate nature was quenched again\r\nin darkness. His wandering eyes, returning to their old trick, looked\r\nuneasily away from Mr. Brock, and his voice dropped back once more into\r\nits unnatural steadiness and quietness of tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been used to be hunted, and cheated, and starved.\r\nEverything else comes strange to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Half attracted by the man, half\r\nrepelled by him, Mr. Brock, on rising to take leave, impulsively offered\r\nhis hand, and then, with a sudden misgiving, confusedly drew it back\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou meant that kindly, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ozias Midwinter, with his own\r\nhands crossed resolutely behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t complain of your thinking\r\nbetter of it. A man who can\xe2\x80\x99t give a proper account of himself is not a\r\nman for a gentleman in your position to take by the hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brock left the inn thoroughly puzzled. Before returning to Mrs.\r\nArmadale he sent for her son. The chances were that the guard had been\r\noff the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s tongue when he spoke to Allan, and with Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfrankness there was no fear of his concealing anything that had passed\r\nbetween them from the rector\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge.\r\n\r\nHere again Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s diplomacy achieved no useful results.\r\n\r\nOnce started on the subject of Ozias Midwinter, Allan rattled on about\r\nhis new friend in his usual easy, light-hearted way. But he had really\r\nnothing of importance to tell, for nothing of importance had been\r\nrevealed to him. They had talked about boat-building and sailing by the\r\nhour together, and Allan had got some valuable hints. They had discussed\r\n(with diagrams to assist them, and with more valuable hints for Allan)\r\nthe serious impending question of the launch of the yacht. On other\r\noccasions they had diverged to other subjects--to more of them than\r\nAllan could remember, on the spur of the moment. Had Midwinter said\r\nnothing about his relations in the flow of all this friendly talk?\r\nNothing, except that they had not behaved well to him--hang his\r\nrelations! Was he at all sensitive on the subject of his own odd name?\r\nNot the least in the world; he had set the example, like a sensible\r\nfellow, of laughing at it himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock still persisted. He inquired next what Allan had seen in the\r\nstranger to take such a fancy to? Allan had seen in him--what he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee in people in general. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like all the other fellows in the\r\nneighborhood. All the other fellows were cut out on the same pattern.\r\nEvery man of them was equally healthy, muscular, loud, hard-hearted,\r\nclean-skinned, and rough; every man of them drank the same draughts of\r\nbeer, smoked the same short pipes all day long, rode the best horse,\r\nshot over the best dog, and put the best bottle of wine in England on\r\nhis table at night; every man of them sponged himself every morning\r\nin the same sort of tub of cold water and bragged about it in frosty\r\nweather in the same sort of way; every man of them thought getting\r\ninto debt a capital joke and betting on horse-races one of the most\r\nmeritorious actions that a human being can perform. They were, no doubt,\r\nexcellent fellows in their way; but the worst of them was, they were\r\nall exactly alike. It was a perfect godsend to meet with a man like\r\nMidwinter--a man who was not cut out on the regular local pattern, and\r\nwhose way in the world had the one great merit (in those parts) of being\r\na way of his own.\r\n\r\nLeaving all remonstrances for a fitter opportunity, the rector went back\r\nto Mrs. Armadale. He could not disguise from himself that Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mother\r\nwas the person really answerable for Allan\xe2\x80\x99s present indiscretion. If\r\nthe lad had seen a little less of the small gentry in the neighborhood,\r\nand a little more of the great outside world at home and abroad, the\r\npleasure of cultivating Ozias Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s society might have had fewer\r\nattractions for him.\r\n\r\nConscious of the unsatisfactory result of his visit to the inn, Mr.\r\nBrock felt some anxiety about the reception of his report when he found\r\nhimself once more in Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s presence. His forebodings were soon\r\nrealized. Try as he might to make the best of it, Mrs. Armadale seized\r\non the one suspicious fact of the usher\xe2\x80\x99s silence about himself as\r\njustifying the strongest measures that could be taken to separate him\r\nfrom her son. If the rector refused to interfere, she declared her\r\nintention of writing to Ozias Midwinter with her own hand. Remonstrance\r\nirritated her to such a pitch that she astounded Mr. Brock by reverting\r\nto the forbidden subject of five years since, and referring him to the\r\nconversation which had passed between them when the advertisement had\r\nbeen discovered in the newspaper. She passionately declared that the\r\nvagabond Armadale of that advertisement, and the vagabond Midwinter at\r\nthe village inn, might, for all she know to the contrary, be one and the\r\nsame. Foreboding a serious disagreement between the mother and son if\r\nthe mother interfered, Mr. Brock undertook to see Midwinter again, and\r\nto tell him plainly that he must give a proper account of himself, or\r\nthat his intimacy with Allan must cease. The two concessions which he\r\nexacted from Mrs. Armadale in return were that she should wait patiently\r\nuntil the doctor reported the man fit to travel, and that she should be\r\ncareful in the interval not to mention the matter in any way to her son.\r\n\r\nIn a week\xe2\x80\x99s time Midwinter was able to drive out (with Allan for his\r\ncoachman) in the pony chaise belonging to the inn, and in ten days the\r\ndoctor privately reported him as fit to travel. Toward the close of\r\nthat tenth day, Mr. Brock met Allan and his new friend enjoying the last\r\ngleams of wintry sunshine in one of the inland lanes. He waited until\r\nthe two had separated, and then followed the usher on his way back to\r\nthe inn.\r\n\r\nThe rector\xe2\x80\x99s resolution to speak pitilessly to the purpose was in some\r\ndanger of failing him as he drew nearer and nearer to the friendless\r\nman, and saw how feebly he still walked, how loosely his worn coat\r\nhung about him, and how heavily he leaned on his cheap, clumsy stick.\r\nHumanely reluctant to say the decisive words too precipitately, Mr.\r\nBrock tried him first with a little compliment on the range of his\r\nreading, as shown by the volume of Sophocles and the volume of Goethe\r\nwhich had been found in his bag, and asked how long he had been\r\nacquainted with German and Greek. The quick ear of Midwinter detected\r\nsomething wrong in the tone of Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s voice. He turned in the\r\ndarkening twilight, and looked suddenly and suspiciously in the rector\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have something to say to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9cand it is not what you\r\nare saying now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it but to accept the challenge. Very delicately,\r\nwith many preparatory words, to which the other listened in unbroken\r\nsilence, Mr. Brock came little by little nearer and nearer to the point.\r\nLong before he had really reached it--long before a man of no more than\r\nordinary sensibility would have felt what was coming--Ozias Midwinter\r\nstood still in the lane, and told the rector that he need say no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the usher. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale has an\r\nascertained position in the world; Mr. Armadale has nothing to conceal,\r\nand nothing to be ashamed of. I agree with you that I am not a fit\r\ncompanion for him. The best return I can make for his kindness is\r\nto presume on it no longer. You may depend on my leaving this place\r\nto-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke no word more; he would hear no word more. With a self-control\r\nwhich, at his years and with his temperament, was nothing less than\r\nmarvelous, he civilly took off his hat, bowed, and returned to the inn\r\nby himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock slept badly that night. The issue of the interview in the lane\r\nhad made the problem of Ozias Midwinter a harder problem to solve than\r\never.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning a letter was brought to the rector from the inn,\r\nand the messenger announced that the strange gentleman had taken his\r\ndeparture. The letter inclosed an open note addressed to Allan, and\r\nrequested Allan\xe2\x80\x99s tutor (after first reading it himself) to forward it\r\nor not at his own sole discretion. The note was a startlingly short one;\r\nit began and ended in a dozen words: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t blame Mr. Brock; Mr. Brock\r\nis right. Thank you, and good-by.--O. M.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rector forwarded the note to its proper destination, as a matter of\r\ncourse, and sent a few lines to Mrs. Armadale at the same time to quiet\r\nher anxiety by the news of the usher\xe2\x80\x99s departure. This done, he waited\r\nthe visit from his pupil, which would probably follow the delivery of\r\nthe note, in no very tranquil frame of mind. There might or might not be\r\nsome deep motive at the bottom of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s conduct; but thus far it\r\nwas impossible to deny that he had behaved in such a manner as to rebuke\r\nthe rector\xe2\x80\x99s distrust, and to justify Allan\xe2\x80\x99s good opinion of him.\r\n\r\nThe morning wore on, and young Armadale never appeared. After looking\r\nfor him vainly in the yard where the yacht was building, Mr. Brock went\r\nto Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s house, and there heard news from the servant which\r\nturned his steps in the direction of the inn. The landlord at once\r\nacknowledged the truth: young Mr. Armadale had come there with an open\r\nletter in his hand, and had insisted on being informed of the road which\r\nhis friend had taken. For the first time in the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s experience of\r\nhim, the young gentleman was out of temper; and the girl who waited on\r\nthe customers had stupidly mentioned a circumstance which had added\r\nfuel to the fire. She had acknowledged having heard Mr. Midwinter lock\r\nhimself into his room overnight, and burst into a violent fit of crying.\r\nThat trifling particular had set Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s face all of a flame; he\r\nhad shouted and sworn; he had rushed into the stables; and forced the\r\nhostler to saddle him a horse, and had set off full gallop on the road\r\nthat Ozias Midwinter had taken before him.\r\n\r\nAfter cautioning the landlord to keep Allan\xe2\x80\x99s conduct a secret if any\r\nof Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s servants came that morning to the inn, Mr. Brock went\r\nhome again, and waited anxiously to see what the day would bring forth.\r\n\r\nTo his infinite relief his pupil appeared at the rectory late in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nAllan looked and spoke with a dogged determination which was quite new\r\nin his old friend\xe2\x80\x99s experience of him. Without waiting to be questioned,\r\nhe told his story in his usual straightforward way. He had overtaken\r\nMidwinter on the road; and--after trying vainly first to induce him to\r\nreturn, then to find out where he was going to--had threatened to\r\nkeep company with him for the rest of the day, and had so extorted the\r\nconfession that he was going to try his luck in London. Having gained\r\nthis point, Allan had asked next for his friend\xe2\x80\x99s address in London, had\r\nbeen entreated by the other not to press his request, had pressed it,\r\nnevertheless, with all his might, and had got the address at last by\r\nmaking an appeal to Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude, for which (feeling heartily\r\nashamed of himself) he had afterward asked Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s pardon. \xe2\x80\x9cI like\r\nthe poor fellow, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t give him up,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Allan, bringing his\r\nclinched fist down with a thump on the rectory table. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid\r\nof my vexing my mother; I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you to speak to her, Mr. Brock, at\r\nyour own time and in your own way; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say this much more\r\nby way of bringing the thing to an end. Here is the address safe in my\r\npocket-book, and here am I, standing firm for once on a resolution of my\r\nown. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you and my mother time to reconsider this; and, when the\r\ntime is up, if my friend Midwinter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come to _me_, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to my\r\nfriend Midwinter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the matter rested for the present; and such was the result of turning\r\nthe castaway usher adrift in the world again.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nA month passed, and brought in the new year--\xe2\x80\x9851. Overleaping that short\r\nlapse of time, Mr. Brock paused, with a heavy heart, at the next\r\nevent; to his mind the one mournful, the one memorable event of the\r\nseries--Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\nThe first warning of the affliction that was near at hand had followed\r\nclose on the usher\xe2\x80\x99s departure in December, and had arisen out of a\r\ncircumstance which dwelt painfully on the rector\xe2\x80\x99s memory from that time\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nBut three days after Midwinter had left for London, Mr. Brock was\r\naccosted in the village by a neatly dressed woman, wearing a gown and\r\nbonnet of black silk and a red Paisley shawl, who was a total stranger\r\nto him, and who inquired the way to Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s house. She put the\r\nquestion without raising the thick black veil that hung over her face.\r\nMr. Brock, in giving her the necessary directions, observed that she\r\nwas a remarkably elegant and graceful woman, and looked after her as she\r\nbowed and left him, wondering who Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s visitor could possibly\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later the lady, still veiled as before, passed Mr.\r\nBrock again close to the inn. She entered the house, and spoke to the\r\nlandlady. Seeing the landlord shortly afterward hurrying round to the\r\nstables, Mr. Brock asked him if the lady was going away. Yes; she had\r\ncome from the railway in the omnibus, but she was going back again more\r\ncreditably in a carriage of her own hiring, supplied by the inn.\r\n\r\nThe rector proceeded on his walk, rather surprised to find his thoughts\r\nrunning inquisitively on a woman who was a stranger to him. When he\r\ngot home again, he found the village surgeon waiting his return with an\r\nurgent message from Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mother. About an hour since, the surgeon\r\nhad been sent for in great haste to see Mrs. Armadale. He had found her\r\nsuffering from an alarming nervous attack, brought on (as the servants\r\nsuspected) by an unexpected, and, possibly, an unwelcome visitor, who\r\nhad called that morning. The surgeon had done all that was needful,\r\nand had no apprehension of any dangerous results. Finding his patient\r\neagerly desirous, on recovering herself, to see Mr. Brock immediately,\r\nhe had thought it important to humor her, and had readily undertaken to\r\ncall at the rectory with a message to that effect.\r\n\r\nLooking at Mrs. Armadale with a far deeper interest in her than the\r\nsurgeon\xe2\x80\x99s interest, Mr. Brock saw enough in her face, when it turned\r\ntoward him on his entering the room, to justify instant and serious\r\nalarm. She allowed him no opportunity of soothing her; she heeded none\r\nof his inquiries. Answers to certain questions of her own were what\r\nshe wanted, and what she was determined to have: Had Mr. Brock seen the\r\nwoman who had presumed to visit her that morning? Yes. Had Allan seen\r\nher? No; Allan had been at work since breakfast, and was at work still,\r\nin his yard by the water-side.\r\n\r\nThis latter reply appeared to quiet Mrs. Armadale for the moment;\r\nshe put her next question--the most extraordinary question of the\r\nthree--more composedly: Did the rector think Allan would object to\r\nleaving his vessel for the present, and to accompanying his mother on\r\na journey to look out for a new house in some other part of England? In\r\nthe greatest amazement Mr. Brock asked what reason there could possibly\r\nbe for leaving her present residence? Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s reason, when she\r\ngave it, only added to his surprise. The woman\xe2\x80\x99s first visit might be\r\nfollowed by a second; and rather than see her again, rather than run\r\nthe risk of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s seeing her and speaking to her, Mrs. Armadale would\r\nleave England if necessary, and end her days in a foreign land. Taking\r\ncounsel of his experience as a magistrate, Mr. Brock inquired if the\r\nwoman had come to ask for money. Yes; respectably as she was dressed,\r\nshe had described herself as being \xe2\x80\x9cin distress\xe2\x80\x9d; had asked for money,\r\nand had got it. But the money was of no importance; the one thing\r\nneedful was to get away before the woman came again. More and more\r\nsurprised, Mr. Brock ventured on another question: Was it long since\r\nMrs. Armadale and her visitor had last met? Yes; longer than all Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlifetime--as long ago as the year before Allan was born.\r\n\r\nAt that reply, the rector shifted his ground, and took counsel next of\r\nhis experience as a friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this person,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cconnected in any way with the painful\r\nremembrances of your early life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; with the painful remembrance of the time when I was married,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Armadale. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was associated, as a mere child, with a circumstance\r\nwhich I must think of with shame and sorrow to my dying day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brock noticed the altered tone in which his old friend spoke, and\r\nthe unwillingness with which she gave her answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me more about her without referring to yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I can protect you, if you will only help me a little. Her\r\nname, for instance--you can tell me her name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Armadale shook her head, \xe2\x80\x9cThe name I knew her by,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwould\r\nbe of no use to you. She has been married since then; she told me so\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd without telling you her married name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe refused to tell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know anything of her friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly of her friends when she was a child. They called themselves her\r\nuncle and aunt. They were low people, and they deserted her at the\r\nschool on my father\xe2\x80\x99s estate. We never heard any more of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she remain under your father\xe2\x80\x99s care?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe remained under my care; that is to say, she traveled with us. We\r\nwere leaving England, just as that time, for Madeira. I had my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleave to take her with me, and to train the wretch to be my maid--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those words Mrs. Armadale stopped confusedly. Mr. Brock tried gently\r\nto lead her on. It was useless; she started up in violent agitation, and\r\nwalked excitedly backward and forward in the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me any more!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out, in loud, angry tones. \xe2\x80\x9cI parted\r\nwith her when she was a girl of twelve years old. I never saw her again,\r\nI never heard of her again, from that time to this. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nshe has discovered me, after all the years that have passed; I only know\r\nthat she _has_ discovered me. She will find her way to Allan next; she\r\nwill poison my son\xe2\x80\x99s mind against me. Help me to get away from her! help\r\nme to take Allan away before she comes back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rector asked no more questions; it would have been cruel to press\r\nher further. The first necessity was to compose her by promising\r\ncompliance with all that she desired. The second was to induce her to\r\nsee another medical man. Mr. Brock contrived to reach his end harmlessly\r\nin this latter case by reminding her that she wanted strength to travel,\r\nand that her own medical attendant might restore her all the more\r\nspeedily to herself if he were assisted by the best professional advice.\r\nHaving overcome her habitual reluctance to seeing strangers by this\r\nmeans, the rector at once went to Allan; and, delicately concealing what\r\nMrs. Armadale had said at the interview, broke the news to him that his\r\nmother was seriously ill. Allan would hear of no messengers being sent\r\nfor assistance: he drove off on the spot to the railway, and telegraphed\r\nhimself to Bristol for medical help.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning the help came, and Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s worst fears were\r\nconfirmed. The village surgeon had fatally misunderstood the case from\r\nthe first, and the time was past now at which his errors of treatment\r\nmight have been set right. The shock of the previous morning had\r\ncompleted the mischief. Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s days were numbered.\r\n\r\nThe son who dearly loved her, the old friend to whom her life was\r\nprecious, hoped vainly to the last. In a month from the physician\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvisit all hope was over; and Allan shed the first bitter tears of his\r\nlife at his mother\xe2\x80\x99s grave.\r\n\r\nShe had died more peacefully than Mr. Brock had dared to hope, leaving\r\nall her little fortune to her son, and committing him solemnly to the\r\ncare of her one friend on earth. The rector had entreated her to let him\r\nwrite and try to reconcile her brothers with her before it was too\r\nlate. She had only answered sadly that it was too late already. But one\r\nreference escaped her in her last illness to those early sorrows which\r\nhad weighed heavily on all her after-life, and which had passed thrice\r\nalready, like shadows of evil, between the rector and herself. Even on\r\nher deathbed she had shrunk from letting the light fall clearly on the\r\nstory of the past. She had looked at Allan kneeling by the bedside,\r\nand had whispered to Mr. Brock: \xe2\x80\x9c_Never let his Namesake come near him!\r\nNever let that Woman find him out_!\xe2\x80\x9d No word more fell from her that\r\ntouched on the misfortunes which had tried her in the past, or on the\r\ndangers which she dreaded in the future. The secret which she had kept\r\nfrom her son and from her friend was a secret which she carried with her\r\nto the grave.\r\n\r\nWhen the last offices of affection and respect had been performed, Mr.\r\nBrock felt it his duty, as executor to the deceased lady, to write to\r\nher brothers, and to give them information of her death. Believing that\r\nhe had to deal with two men who would probably misinterpret his motives\r\nif he left Allan\xe2\x80\x99s position unexplained, he was careful to remind them\r\nthat Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s son was well provided for, and that the object of\r\nhis letter was simply to communicate the news of their sister\xe2\x80\x99s decease.\r\nThe two letters were dispatched toward the middle of January, and by\r\nreturn of post the answers were received. The first which the rector\r\nopened was written not by the elder brother, but by the elder brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly son. The young man had succeeded to the estates in Norfolk on his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death, some little time since. He wrote in a frank and friendly\r\nspirit, assuring Mr. Brock that, however strongly his father might have\r\nbeen prejudiced against Mrs. Armadale, the hostile feeling had never\r\nextended to her son. For himself, he had only to add that he would be\r\nsincerely happy to welcome his cousin to Thorpe Ambrose whenever his\r\ncousin came that way.\r\n\r\nThe second letter was a far less agreeable reply to receive than the\r\nfirst. The younger brother was still alive, and still resolute neither\r\nto forget nor forgive. He informed Mr. Brock that his deceased sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchoice of a husband, and her conduct to her father at the time of her\r\nmarriage, had made any relations of affection or esteem impossible, on\r\nhis side, from that time forth. Holding the opinions he did, it would\r\nbe equally painful to his nephew and himself if any personal intercourse\r\ntook place between them. He had adverted, as generally as possible, to\r\nthe nature of the differences which had kept him apart from his\r\nlate sister, in order to satisfy Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s mind that a personal\r\nacquaintance with young Mr. Armadale was, as a matter of delicacy, quite\r\nout of the question and, having done this, he would beg leave to close\r\nthe correspondence.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock wisely destroyed the second letter on the spot, and, after\r\nshowing Allan his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s invitation, suggested that he should go to\r\nThorpe Ambrose as soon as he felt fit to present himself to strangers.\r\n\r\nAllan listened to the advice patiently enough; but he declined to profit\r\nby it. \xe2\x80\x9cI will shake hands with my cousin willingly if I ever meet him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will visit no family, and be a guest in no house, in\r\nwhich my mother has been badly treated.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brock remonstrated gently,\r\nand tried to put matters in their proper light. Even at that time--even\r\nwhile he was still ignorant of events which were then impending--Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrangely isolated position in the world was a subject of serious\r\nanxiety to his old friend and tutor. The proposed visit to Thorpe\r\nAmbrose opened the very prospect of his making friends and connections\r\nsuited to him in rank and age which Mr. Brock most desired to see; but\r\nAllan was not to be persuaded; he was obstinate and unreasonable; and\r\nthe rector had no alternative but to drop the subject.\r\n\r\nOne on another the weeks passed monotonously, and Allan showed but\r\nlittle of the elasticity of his age and character in bearing the\r\naffliction that had made him motherless. He finished and launched his\r\nyacht; but his own journeymen remarked that the work seemed to have lost\r\nits interest for him. It was not natural to the young man to brood\r\nover his solitude and his grief as he was brooding now. As the spring\r\nadvanced, Mr. Brock began to feel uneasy about the future, if Allan was\r\nnot roused at once by change of scene. After much pondering, the\r\nrector decided on trying a trip to Paris, and on extending the journey\r\nsouthward if his companion showed an interest in Continental traveling.\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s reception of the proposal made atonement for his obstinacy in\r\nrefusing to cultivate his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance; he was willing to go\r\nwith Mr. Brock wherever Mr. Brock pleased. The rector took him at his\r\nword, and in the middle of March the two strangely assorted companions\r\nleft for London on their way to Paris.\r\n\r\nArrived in London, Mr. Brock found himself unexpectedly face to face\r\nwith a new anxiety. The unwelcome subject of Ozias Midwinter, which\r\nhad been buried in peace since the beginning of December, rose to the\r\nsurface again, and confronted the rector at the very outset of his\r\ntravels, more unmanageably than ever.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s position in dealing with this difficult matter had been\r\nhard enough to maintain when he had first meddled with it. He now found\r\nhimself with no vantage-ground left to stand on. Events had so ordered\r\nit that the difference of opinion between Allan and his mother on the\r\nsubject of the usher was entirely disassociated with the agitation\r\nwhich had hastened Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s death. Allan\xe2\x80\x99s resolution to say no\r\nirritating words, and Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to touch on a disagreeable\r\ntopic, had kept them both silent about Midwinter in Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence during the three days which had intervened between that\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s departure and the appearance of the strange woman in the\r\nvillage. In the period of suspense and suffering that had followed no\r\nrecurrence to the subject of the usher had been possible, and none had\r\ntaken place. Free from all mental disquietude on this score, Allan\r\nhad stoutly preserved his perverse interest in his new friend. He had\r\nwritten to tell Midwinter of his affliction, and he now proposed (unless\r\nthe rector formally objected to it) paying a visit to his friend before\r\nhe started for Paris the next morning.\r\n\r\nWhat was Mr. Brock to do? There was no denying that Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\r\nhad pleaded unanswerably against poor Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s unfounded distrust\r\nof him. If the rector, with no convincing reason to allege against it,\r\nand with no right to interfere but the right which Allan\xe2\x80\x99s courtesy gave\r\nhim, declined to sanction the proposed visit, then farewell to all\r\nthe old sociability and confidence between tutor and pupil on the\r\ncontemplated tour. Environed by difficulties, which might have been\r\npossibly worsted by a less just and a less kind-hearted man, Mr. Brock\r\nsaid a cautious word or two at parting, and (with more confidence\r\nin Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s discretion and self-denial than he quite liked to\r\nacknowledge, even to himself) left Allan free to take his own way.\r\n\r\nAfter whiling away an hour, during the interval of his pupil\xe2\x80\x99s absence,\r\nby a walk in the streets, the rector returned to his hotel, and, finding\r\nthe newspaper disengaged in the coffee-room, sat down absently to look\r\nover it. His eye, resting idly on the title-page, was startled into\r\ninstant attention by the very first advertisement that it chanced\r\nto light on at the head of the column. There was Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious\r\nnamesake again, figuring in capital letters, and associated this time\r\n(in the character of a dead man) with the offer of a pecuniary reward.\r\nThus it ran:\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPOSED TO BE DEAD.--To parish clerks, sextons, and others. Twenty\r\nPounds reward will be paid to any person who can produce evidence of\r\nthe death of ALLAN ARMADALE, only son of the late Allan Armadale, of\r\nBarbadoes, and born in Trinidad in the year 1830. Further particulars on\r\napplication to Messrs. Hammick and Ridge, Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields, London.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s essentially unimaginative mind began to stagger\r\nsuperstitiously in the dark as he laid the newspaper down again. Little\r\nby little a vague suspicion took possession of him that the whole series\r\nof events which had followed the first appearance of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s namesake\r\nin the newspaper six years since was held together by some mysterious\r\nconnection, and was tending steadily to some unimaginable end. Without\r\nknowing why, he began to feel uneasy at Allan\xe2\x80\x99s absence. Without knowing\r\nwhy, he became impatient to get his pupil away from England before\r\nanything else happened between night and morning.\r\n\r\nIn an hour more the rector was relieved of all immediate anxiety by\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s return to the hotel. The young man was vexed and out of spirits.\r\nHe had discovered Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings, but he had failed to find\r\nMidwinter himself. The only account his landlady could give of him was\r\nthat he had gone out at his customary time to get his dinner at the\r\nnearest eating-house, and that he had not returned, in accordance with\r\nhis usual regular habits, at his usual regular hour. Allan had therefore\r\ngone to inquire at the eating-house, and had found, on describing him,\r\nthat Midwinter was well known there. It was his custom, on other days,\r\nto take a frugal dinner, and to sit half an hour afterward reading the\r\nnewspaper. On this occasion, after dining, he had taken up the paper\r\nas usual, had suddenly thrown it aside again, and had gone, nobody knew\r\nwhere, in a violent hurry. No further information being attainable,\r\nAllan had left a note at the lodgings, giving his address at the hotel,\r\nand begging Midwinter to come and say good-by before his departure for\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed, and Allan\xe2\x80\x99s invisible friend never appeared. The\r\nmorning came, bringing no obstacles with it, and Mr. Brock and his pupil\r\nleft London. So far Fortune had declared herself at last on the rector\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside. Ozias Midwinter, after intrusively rising to the surface, had\r\nconveniently dropped out of sight again. What was to happen next?\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nAdvancing once more, by three weeks only, from past to present, Mr.\r\nBrock\xe2\x80\x99s memory took up the next event on the seventh of April. To all\r\nappearance, the chain was now broken at last. The new event had no\r\nrecognizable connection (either to his mind or to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s) with any\r\nof the persons who had appeared, or any of the circumstances that had\r\nhappened, in the by-gone time.\r\n\r\nThe travelers had as yet got no further than Paris. Allan\xe2\x80\x99s spirits had\r\nrisen with the change; and he had been made all the readier to enjoy the\r\nnovelty of the scene around him by receiving a letter from Midwinter,\r\ncontaining news which Mr. Brock himself acknowledged promised fairly for\r\nthe future. The ex-usher had been away on business when Allan had called\r\nat his lodgings, having been led by an accidental circumstance to open\r\ncommunications with his relatives on that day. The result had taken him\r\nentirely by surprise: it had unexpectedly secured to him a little income\r\nof his own for the rest of his life. His future plans, now that this\r\npiece of good fortune had fallen to his share, were still unsettled.\r\nBut if Allan wished to hear what he ultimately decided on, his agent in\r\nLondon (whose direction he inclosed) would receive communications\r\nfor him, and would furnish Mr. Armadale at all future times with his\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of this letter, Allan had seized the pen in his usual\r\nheadlong way, and had insisted on Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s immediately joining Mr.\r\nBrock and himself on their travels. The last days of March passed, and\r\nno answer to the proposal was received. The first days of April came,\r\nand on the seventh of the month there was a letter for Allan at last on\r\nthe breakfast-table. He snatched it up, looked at the address, and threw\r\nthe letter down again impatiently. The handwriting was not Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nAllan finished his breakfast before he cared to read what his\r\ncorrespondent had to say to him.\r\n\r\nThe meal over, young Armadale lazily opened the letter. He began it with\r\nan expression of supreme indifference. He finished it with a sudden leap\r\nout of his chair, and a loud shout of astonishment. Wondering, as he\r\nwell might, at this extraordinary outbreak, Mr. Brock took up the letter\r\nwhich Allan had tossed across the table to him. Before he had come to\r\nthe end of it, his hands dropped helplessly on his knees, and the blank\r\nbewilderment of his pupil\xe2\x80\x99s expression was accurately reflected on his\r\nown face.\r\n\r\nIf ever two men had good cause for being thrown completely off their\r\nbalance, Allan and the rector were those two. The letter which had\r\nstruck them both with the same shock of astonishment did, beyond all\r\nquestion, contain an announcement which, on a first discovery of it, was\r\nsimply incredible. The news was from Norfolk, and was to this effect. In\r\nlittle more than one week\xe2\x80\x99s time death had mown down no less than three\r\nlives in the family at Thorpe Ambrose, and Allan Armadale was at that\r\nmoment heir to an estate of eight thousand a year!\r\n\r\nA second perusal of the letter enabled the rector and his companion to\r\nmaster the details which had escaped them on a first reading.\r\n\r\nThe writer was the family lawyer at Thorpe Ambrose. After announcing to\r\nAllan the deaths of his cousin Arthur at the age of twenty-five, of his\r\nuncle Henry at the age of forty-eight, and of his cousin John at the\r\nage of twenty-one, the lawyer proceeded to give a brief abstract of the\r\nterms of the elder Mr. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s will. The claims of male issue were,\r\nas is not unusual in such cases, preferred to the claims of female\r\nissue. Failing Arthur and his issue male, the estate was left to Henry\r\nand his issue male. Failing them, it went to the issue male of Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister; and, in default of such issue, to the next heir male. As events\r\nhad happened, the two young men, Arthur and John, had died unmarried,\r\nand Henry Blanchard had died, leaving no surviving child but a daughter.\r\nUnder these circumstances, Allan was the next heir male pointed at by\r\nthe will, and was now legally successor to the Thorpe Ambrose estate.\r\nHaving made this extraordinary announcement, the lawyer requested to be\r\nfavored with Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, and added, in conclusion, that\r\nhe would be happy to furnish any further particulars that were desired.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to waste time in wondering at an event which neither\r\nAllan nor his mother had ever thought of as even remotely possible. The\r\nonly thing to be done was to go back to England at once. The next day\r\nfound the travelers installed once more in their London hotel, and the\r\nday after the affair was placed in the proper professional hands. The\r\ninevitable corresponding and consulting ensued, and one by one the\r\nall-important particulars flowed in, until the measure of information\r\nwas pronounced to be full.\r\n\r\nThis was the strange story of the three deaths:\r\n\r\nAt the time when Mr. Brock had written to Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s relatives to\r\nannounce the news of her decease (that is to say, in the middle of\r\nthe month of January), the family at Thorpe Ambrose numbered five\r\npersons--Arthur Blanchard (in possession of the estate), living in the\r\ngreat house with his mother; and Henry Blanchard, the uncle, living in\r\nthe neighborhood, a widower with two children, a son and a daughter. To\r\ncement the family connection still more closely, Arthur Blanchard was\r\nengaged to be married to his cousin. The wedding was to be celebrated\r\nwith great local rejoicings in the coming summer, when the young lady\r\nhad completed her twentieth year.\r\n\r\nThe month of February had brought changes with it in the family\r\nposition. Observing signs of delicacy in the health of his son, Mr.\r\nHenry Blanchard left Norfolk, taking the young man with him, under\r\nmedical advice, to try the climate of Italy. Early in the ensuing month\r\nof March, Arthur Blanchard also left Thorpe Ambrose, for a few days\r\nonly, on business which required his presence in London. The business\r\ntook him into the City. Annoyed by the endless impediments in the\r\nstreets, he returned westward by one of the river steamers, and, so\r\nreturning, met his death.\r\n\r\nAs the steamer left the wharf, he noticed a woman near him who had shown\r\na singular hesitation in embarking, and who had been the last of the\r\npassengers to take her place in the vessel. She was neatly dressed in\r\nblack silk, with a red Paisley shawl over her shoulders, and she kept\r\nher face hidden behind a thick veil. Arthur Blanchard was struck by the\r\nrare grace and elegance of her figure, and he felt a young man\xe2\x80\x99s passing\r\ncuriosity to see her face. She neither lifted her veil nor turned her\r\nhead his way. After taking a few steps hesitatingly backward and forward\r\non the deck, she walked away on a sudden to the stern of the vessel. In\r\na minute more there was a cry of alarm from the man at the helm, and\r\nthe engines were stopped immediately. The woman had thrown herself\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\nThe passengers all rushed to the side of the vessel to look. Arthur\r\nBlanchard alone, without an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, jumped into the river.\r\nHe was an excellent swimmer, and he reached the woman as she rose again\r\nto the surface, after sinking for the first time. Help was at hand, and\r\nthey were both brought safely ashore. The woman was taken to the nearest\r\npolice station, and was soon restored to her senses, her preserver\r\ngiving his name and address, as usual in such cases, to the inspector on\r\nduty, who wisely recommended him to get into a warm bath, and to send to\r\nhis lodgings for dry clothes. Arthur Blanchard, who had never known an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s illness since he was a child, laughed at the caution, and went\r\nback in a cab. The next day he was too ill to attend the examination\r\nbefore the magistrate. A fortnight afterward he was a dead man.\r\n\r\nThe news of the calamity reached Henry Blanchard and his son at Milan,\r\nand within an hour of the time when they received it they were on their\r\nway back to England. The snow on the Alps had loosened earlier than\r\nusual that year, and the passes were notoriously dangerous. The father\r\nand son, traveling in their own carriage, were met on the mountain by\r\nthe mail returning, after sending the letters on by hand. Warnings which\r\nwould have produced their effect under any ordinary circumstances were\r\nnow vainly addressed to the two Englishmen. Their impatience to be\r\nat home again, after the catastrophe which had befallen their family,\r\nbrooked no delay. Bribes lavishly offered to the postilions, tempted\r\nthem to go on. The carriage pursued its way, and was lost to view in the\r\nmist. When it was seen again, it was disinterred from the bottom of a\r\nprecipice--the men, the horses, and the vehicle all crushed together\r\nunder the wreck and ruin of an avalanche.\r\n\r\nSo the three lives were mown down by death. So, in a clear sequence of\r\nevents, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s suicide-leap into a river had opened to Allan Armadale\r\nthe succession to the Thorpe Ambrose estates.\r\n\r\nWho was the woman? The man who saved her life never knew. The magistrate\r\nwho remanded her, the chaplain who exhorted her, the reporter who\r\nexhibited her in print, never knew. It was recorded of her with surprise\r\nthat, though most respectably dressed, she had nevertheless described\r\nherself as being \xe2\x80\x9cin distress.\xe2\x80\x9d She had expressed the deepest\r\ncontrition, but had persisted in giving a name which was on the face of\r\nit a false one; in telling a commonplace story, which was manifestly\r\nan invention; and in refusing to the last to furnish any clew to her\r\nfriends. A lady connected with a charitable institution (\xe2\x80\x9cinterested by\r\nher extreme elegance and beauty\xe2\x80\x9d) had volunteered to take charge of her,\r\nand to bring her into a better frame of mind. The first day\xe2\x80\x99s experience\r\nof the penitent had been far from cheering, and the second day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexperience had been conclusive. She had left the institution by stealth;\r\nand--though the visiting clergyman, taking a special interest in the\r\ncase, had caused special efforts to be made--all search after her, from\r\nthat time forth, had proved fruitless.\r\n\r\nWhile this useless investigation (undertaken at Allan\xe2\x80\x99s express desire)\r\nwas in progress, the lawyers had settled the preliminary formalities\r\nconnected with the succession to the property. All that remained was\r\nfor the new master of Thorpe Ambrose to decide when he would personally\r\nestablish himself on the estate of which he was now the legal possessor.\r\n\r\nLeft necessarily to his own guidance in this matter, Allan settled\r\nit for himself in his usual hot-headed, generous way. He positively\r\ndeclined to take possession until Mrs. Blanchard and her niece (who had\r\nbeen permitted thus far, as a matter of courtesy, to remain in their old\r\nhome) had recovered from the calamity that had befallen them, and were\r\nfit to decide for themselves what their future proceedings should be.\r\nA private correspondence followed this resolution, comprehending, on\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s side, unlimited offers of everything he had to give (in a house\r\nwhich he had not yet seen), and, on the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 side, a discreetly\r\nreluctant readiness to profit by the young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s generosity in the\r\nmatter of time. To the astonishment of his legal advisers, Allan entered\r\ntheir office one morning, accompanied by Mr. Brock, and announced, with\r\nperfect composure, that the ladies had been good enough to take his own\r\narrangements off his hands, and that, in deference to their convenience,\r\nhe meant to defer establishing himself at Thorpe Ambrose till that\r\nday two months. The lawyers stared at Allan, and Allan, returning the\r\ncompliment, stared at the lawyers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth are you wondering at, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, with a\r\nboyish bewilderment in his good-humored blue eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\ngive the ladies their two months, if the ladies want them? Let the poor\r\nthings take their own time, and welcome. My rights? and my position? Oh,\r\npooh! pooh! I\xe2\x80\x99m in no hurry to be squire of the parish; it\xe2\x80\x99s not in my\r\nway. What do I mean to do for the two months? What I should have done\r\nanyhow, whether the ladies had stayed or not; I mean to go cruising\r\nat sea. That\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_ like! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a new yacht at home in\r\nSomersetshire--a yacht of my own building. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n continued Allan, seizing the head partner by the arm in the fervor of\r\nhis friendly intentions, \xe2\x80\x9cyou look sadly in want of a holiday in the\r\nfresh air, and you shall come along with me on the trial trip of my new\r\nvessel. And your partners, too, if they like. And the head clerk, who\r\nis the best fellow I ever met with in my life. Plenty of room--we\xe2\x80\x99ll all\r\nshake down together on the floor, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll give Mr. Brock a rug on the\r\ncabin table. Thorpe Ambrose be hanged! Do you mean to say, if you had\r\nbuilt a vessel yourself (as I have), you would go to any estate in the\r\nthree kingdoms, while your own little beauty was sitting like a duck on\r\nthe water at home, and waiting for you to try her? You legal gentlemen\r\nare great hands at argument. What do you think of that argument? I think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s unanswerable--and I\xe2\x80\x99m off to Somersetshire to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, the new possessor of eight thousand a year dashed into\r\nthe head clerk\xe2\x80\x99s office, and invited that functionary to a cruise on the\r\nhigh seas, with a smack on the shoulder which was heard distinctly by\r\nhis masters in the next room. The firm looked in interrogative wonder at\r\nMr. Brock. A client who could see a position among the landed gentry of\r\nEngland waiting for him, without being in a hurry to occupy it at the\r\nearliest possible opportunity, was a client of whom they possessed no\r\nprevious experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have been very oddly brought up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyers to the\r\nrector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery oddly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the rector to the lawyers.\r\n\r\nA last leap over one month more brought Mr. Brock to the present\r\ntime--to the bedroom at Castletown, in which he was sitting thinking,\r\nand to the anxiety which was obstinately intruding itself between\r\nhim and his night\xe2\x80\x99s rest. That anxiety was no unfamiliar enemy to the\r\nrector\xe2\x80\x99s peace of mind. It had first found him out in Somersetshire six\r\nmonths since, and it had now followed him to the Isle of Man under the\r\ninveterately obtrusive form of Ozias Midwinter.\r\n\r\nThe change in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s future prospects had worked no corresponding\r\nalteration in his perverse fancy for the castaway at the village inn.\r\nIn the midst of the consultations with the lawyers he had found time\r\nto visit Midwinter, and on the journey back with the rector there was\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s friend in the carriage, returning with them to Somersetshire by\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s own invitation.\r\n\r\nThe ex-usher\xe2\x80\x99s hair had grown again on his shaven skull, and his dress\r\nshowed the renovating influence of an accession of pecuniary means, but\r\nin all other respects the man was unchanged. He met Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s distrust\r\nwith the old uncomplaining resignation to it; he maintained the same\r\nsuspicious silence on the subject of his relatives and his early life;\r\nhe spoke of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s kindness to him with the same undisciplined fervor\r\nof gratitude and surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cI have done what I could, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nMr. Brock, while Allan was asleep in the railway carriage. \xe2\x80\x9cI have kept\r\nout of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s way, and I have not even answered his last letter\r\nto me. More than that is more than I can do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to consider\r\nmy own feeling toward the only human creature who has never suspected\r\nand never ill-treated me. I can resist my own feeling, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nresist the young gentleman himself. There\xe2\x80\x99s not another like him in the\r\nworld. If we are to be parted again, it must be his doing or yours--not\r\nmine. The dog\xe2\x80\x99s master has whistled,\xe2\x80\x9d said this strange man, with a\r\nmomentary outburst of the hidden passion in him, and a sudden springing\r\nof angry tears in his wild brown eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is hard, sir, to blame\r\nthe dog when the dog comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s humanity got the better of Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s caution. He\r\ndetermined to wait, and see what the coming days of social intercourse\r\nmight bring forth.\r\n\r\nThe days passed; the yacht was rigged and fitted for sea; a cruise\r\nwas arranged to the Welsh coast--and Midwinter the Secret was the same\r\nMidwinter still. Confinement on board a little vessel of five-and-thirty\r\ntons offered no great attraction to a man of Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s time of life.\r\nBut he sailed on the trial trip of the yacht nevertheless, rather than\r\ntrust Allan alone with his new friend.\r\n\r\nWould the close companionship of the three on their cruise tempt the\r\nman into talking of his own affairs? No; he was ready enough on other\r\nsubjects, especially if Allan led the way to them. But not a word\r\nescaped him about himself. Mr. Brock tried him with questions about\r\nhis recent inheritance, and was answered as he had been answered\r\nonce already at the Somersetshire inn. It was a curious coincidence,\r\nMidwinter admitted, that Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s prospects and his own prospects\r\nshould both have unexpectedly changed for the better about the same\r\ntime. But there the resemblance ended. It was no large fortune that\r\nhad fallen into his lap, though it was enough for his wants. It had not\r\nreconciled him with his relations, for the money had not come to him as\r\na matter of kindness, but as a matter of right. As for the circumstance\r\nwhich had led to his communicating with his family, it was not worth\r\nmentioning, seeing that the temporary renewal of intercourse which had\r\nfollowed had produced no friendly results. Nothing had come of it but\r\nthe money--and, with the money, an anxiety which troubled him sometimes,\r\nwhen he woke in the small hours of the morning.\r\n\r\nAt those last words he became suddenly silent, as if for once his\r\nwell-guarded tongue had betrayed him.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock seized the opportunity, and bluntly asked him what the nature\r\nof the anxiety might be. Did it relate to money? No; it related to a\r\nLetter which had been waiting for him for many years. Had he received\r\nthe letter? Not yet; it had been left under charge of one of the\r\npartners in the firm which had managed the business of his inheritance\r\nfor him; the partner had been absent from England; and the letter,\r\nlocked up among his own private papers, could not be got at till he\r\nreturned. He was expected back toward the latter part of that present\r\nMay, and, if Midwinter could be sure where the cruise would take them to\r\nat the close of the month, he thought he would write and have the letter\r\nforwarded. Had he any family reasons to be anxious about it? None that\r\nhe knew of; he was curious to see what had been waiting for him for many\r\nyears, and that was all. So he answered the rector\xe2\x80\x99s questions, with\r\nhis tawny face turned away over the low bulwark of the yacht, and his\r\nfishing-line dragging in his supple brown hands.\r\n\r\nFavored by wind and weather, the little vessel had done wonders on her\r\ntrial trip. Before the period fixed for the duration of the cruise had\r\nhalf expired, the yacht was as high up on the Welsh coast as Holyhead;\r\nand Allan, eager for adventure in unknown regions, had declared boldly\r\nfor an extension of the voyage northward to the Isle of Man. Having\r\nascertained from reliable authority that the weather really promised\r\nwell for a cruise in that quarter, and that, in the event of any\r\nunforeseen necessity for return, the railway was accessible by the\r\nsteamer from Douglas to Liverpool, Mr. Brock agreed to his pupil\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproposal. By that night\xe2\x80\x99s post he wrote to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers and to his\r\nown rectory, indicating Douglas in the Isle of Man as the next\r\naddress to which letters might be forwarded. At the post-office he met\r\nMidwinter, who had just dropped a letter into the box. Remembering what\r\nhe had said on board the yacht, Mr. Brock concluded that they had both\r\ntaken the same precaution, and had ordered their correspondence to be\r\nforwarded to the same place.\r\n\r\nLate the next day they set sail for the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nFor a few hours all went well; but sunset brought with it the signs of\r\na coming change. With the darkness the wind rose to a gale, and the\r\nquestion whether Allan and his journeymen had or had not built a stout\r\nsea-boat was seriously tested for the first time. All that night, after\r\ntrying vainly to bear up for Holyhead, the little vessel kept the sea,\r\nand stood her trial bravely. The next morning the Isle of Man was in\r\nview, and the yacht was safe at Castletown. A survey by daylight of hull\r\nand rigging showed that all the damage done might be set right again\r\nin a week\xe2\x80\x99s time. The cruising party had accordingly remained at\r\nCastletown, Allan being occupied in superintending the repairs, Mr.\r\nBrock in exploring the neighborhood, and Midwinter in making daily\r\npilgrimages on foot to Douglas and back to inquire for letters.\r\n\r\nThe first of the cruising party who received a letter was Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cMore\r\nworries from those everlasting lawyers,\xe2\x80\x9d was all he said, when he had\r\nread the letter, and had crumpled it up in his pocket. The rector\xe2\x80\x99s turn\r\ncame next, before the week\xe2\x80\x99s sojourn at Castletown had expired. On the\r\nfifth day he found a letter from Somersetshire waiting for him at the\r\nhotel. It had been brought there by Midwinter, and it contained news\r\nwhich entirely overthrew all Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s holiday plans. The clergyman\r\nwho had undertaken to do duty for him in his absence had been\r\nunexpectedly summoned home again; and Mr. Brock had no choice (the day\r\nof the week being Friday) but to cross the next morning from Douglass\r\nto Liverpool, and get back by railway on Saturday night in time for\r\nSunday\xe2\x80\x99s service.\r\n\r\nHaving read his letter, and resigned himself to his altered\r\ncircumstances as patiently as he might, the rector passed next to a\r\nquestion that pressed for serious consideration in its turn. Burdened\r\nwith his heavy responsibility toward Allan, and conscious of his own\r\nundiminished distrust of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s new friend, how was he to act, in the\r\nemergency that now beset him, toward the two young men who had been his\r\ncompanions on the cruise?\r\n\r\nMr. Brock had first asked himself that awkward question on the Friday\r\nafternoon, and he was still trying vainly to answer it, alone in his own\r\nroom, at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the Saturday morning. It was then only the end\r\nof May, and the residence of the ladies at Thorpe Ambrose (unless they\r\nchose to shorten it of their own accord) would not expire till the\r\nmiddle of June. Even if the repairs of the yacht had been completed\r\n(which was not the case), there was no possible pretense for hurrying\r\nAllan back to Somersetshire. But one other alternative remained--to\r\nleave him where he was. In other words, to leave him, at the\r\nturning-point of his life, under the sole influence of a man whom he had\r\nfirst met with as a castaway at a village inn, and who was still, to all\r\npractical purposes, a total stranger to him.\r\n\r\nIn despair of obtaining any better means of enlightenment to guide\r\nhis decision, Mr. Brock reverted to the impression which Midwinter had\r\nproduced on his own mind in the familiarity of the cruise.\r\n\r\nYoung as he was, the ex-usher had evidently lived a varied life. He\r\ncould speak of books like a man who had really enjoyed them; he could\r\ntake his turn at the helm like a sailor who knew his duty; he could\r\ncook, and climb the rigging, and lay the cloth for dinner, with an odd\r\ndelight in the exhibition of his own dexterity. The display of these,\r\nand other qualities like them, as his spirits rose with the cruise, had\r\nrevealed the secret of his attraction for Allan plainly enough. But had\r\nall disclosures rested there? Had the man let no chance light in on his\r\ncharacter in the rector\xe2\x80\x99s presence? Very little; and that little did\r\nnot set him forth in a morally alluring aspect. His way in the world had\r\nlain evidently in doubtful places; familiarity with the small villainies\r\nof vagabonds peeped out of him now and then; and, more significant\r\nstill, he habitually slept the light, suspicious sleep of a man who has\r\nbeen accustomed to close his eyes in doubt of the company under the same\r\nroof with him. Down to the very latest moment of the rector\xe2\x80\x99s experience\r\nof him--down to that present Friday night--his conduct had been\r\npersistently secret and unaccountable to the very last. After bringing\r\nMr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s letter to the hotel, he had mysterious disappeared from\r\nthe house without leaving any message for his companions, and without\r\nletting anybody see whether he had or had not received a letter himself.\r\nAt nightfall he had come back stealthily in the darkness, had been\r\ncaught on the stairs by Allan, eager to tell him of the change in the\r\nrector\xe2\x80\x99s plans, had listened to the news without a word of remark! and\r\nhad ended by sulkily locking himself into his own room. What was\r\nthere in his favor to set against such revelations of his character\r\nas these--against his wandering eyes, his obstinate reserve with the\r\nrector, his ominous silence on the subject of family and friends? Little\r\nor nothing: the sum of all his merits began and ended with his gratitude\r\nto Allan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Brock left his seat on the side of the bed, trimmed his candle, and,\r\nstill lost in his own thoughts, looked out absently at the night. The\r\nchange of place brought no new ideas with it. His retrospect over\r\nhis own past life had amply satisfied him that his present sense of\r\nresponsibility rested on no merely fanciful grounds, and, having brought\r\nhim to that point, had left him there, standing at the window, and\r\nseeing nothing but the total darkness in his own mind faithfully\r\nreflected by the total darkness of the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I only had a friend to apply to!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the rector. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could\r\nonly find some one to help me in this miserable place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the aspiration crossed his mind, it was suddenly\r\nanswered by a low knock at the door, and a voice said softly in the\r\npassage outside, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter an instant\xe2\x80\x99s pause to steady his nerves, Mr. Brock opened the\r\ndoor, and found himself, at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, standing face to\r\nface on the threshold of his own bedroom with Ozias Midwinter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the rector, as soon as his astonishment would allow\r\nhim to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come here to make a clean breast of it!\xe2\x80\x9d was the strange answer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words he walked into the room, his eyes on the ground, his\r\nlips ashy pale, and his hand holding something hidden behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the light under your door,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, without looking up, and\r\nwithout moving his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know the trouble on your mind which is\r\nkeeping you from your rest. You are going away to-morrow morning, and\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t like leaving Mr. Armadale alone with a stranger like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStartled as he was, Mr. Brock saw the serious necessity of being plain\r\nwith a man who had come at that time, and had said those words to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have guessed right,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI stand in the place of a father\r\nto Allan Armadale, and I am naturally unwilling to leave him, at his\r\nage, with a man whom I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOzias Midwinter took a step forward to the table. His wandering eyes\r\nrested on the rector\xe2\x80\x99s New Testament, which was one of the objects lying\r\non it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have read that Book, in the years of a long life, to many\r\ncongregations,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHas it taught you mercy to your miserable\r\nfellow-creatures?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to be answered, he looked Mr. Brock in the face for the\r\nfirst time, and brought his hidden hand slowly into view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand, for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake, pity me when you know who\r\nI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laid a letter of many pages on the table. It was the letter that Mr.\r\nNeal had posted at Wildbad nineteen years since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE MAN REVEALED.\r\n\r\nTHE first cool breathings of the coming dawn fluttered through the open\r\nwindow as Mr. Brock read the closing lines of the Confession. He put it\r\nfrom him in silence, without looking up. The first shock of discovery\r\nhad struck his mind, and had passed away again. At his age, and with\r\nhis habits of thought, his grasp was not strong enough to hold the whole\r\nrevelation that had fallen on him. All his heart, when he closed the\r\nmanuscript, was with the memory of the woman who had been the beloved\r\nfriend of his later and happier life; all his thoughts were busy with\r\nthe miserable secret of her treason to her own father which the letter\r\nhad disclosed.\r\n\r\nHe was startled out of the narrow limits of his own little grief by the\r\nvibration of the table at which he sat, under a hand that was laid on it\r\nheavily. The instinct of reluctance was strong in him; but he conquered\r\nit, and looked up. There, silently confronting him in the mixed light of\r\nthe yellow candle flame and the faint gray dawn, stood the castaway of\r\nthe village inn--the inheritor of the fatal Armadale name.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock shuddered as the terror of the present time and the darker\r\nterror yet of the future that might be coming rushed back on him at the\r\nsight of the man\xe2\x80\x99s face. The man saw it, and spoke first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my father\xe2\x80\x99s crime looking at you out of my eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHas the\r\nghost of the drowned man followed me into the room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suffering and the passion that he was forcing back shook the hand\r\nthat he still kept on the table, and stifled the voice in which he spoke\r\nuntil it sank to a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no wish to treat you otherwise than justly and kindly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nMr. Brock. \xe2\x80\x9cDo me justice on my side, and believe that I am incapable of\r\ncruelly holding you responsible for your father\xe2\x80\x99s crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reply seemed to compose him. He bowed his head in silence, and took\r\nup the confession from the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you read this through?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery word of it, from first to last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I dealt openly with you so far. Has Ozias Midwinter--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you still call yourself by that name,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mr. Brock, \xe2\x80\x9cnow\r\nyour true name is known to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince I have read my father\xe2\x80\x99s confession,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cI like my\r\nugly alias better than ever. Allow me to repeat the question which I was\r\nabout to put to you a minute since: Has Ozias Midwinter done his best\r\nthus far to enlighten Mr. Brock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rector evaded a direct reply. \xe2\x80\x9cFew men in your position,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwould have had the courage to show me that letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be too sure, sir, of the vagabond you picked up at the inn till\r\nyou know a little more of him than you know now. You have got the secret\r\nof my birth, but you are not in possession yet of the story of my life.\r\nYou ought to know it, and you shall know it, before you leave me alone\r\nwith Mr. Armadale. Will you wait, and rest a little while, or shall I\r\ntell it you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock, still as far away as ever from knowing the real\r\ncharacter of the man before him.\r\n\r\nEverything Ozias Midwinter said, everything Ozias Midwinter did, was\r\nagainst him. He had spoken with a sardonic indifference, almost with an\r\ninsolence of tone, which would have repelled the sympathies of any man\r\nwho heard him. And now, instead of placing himself at the table, and\r\naddressing his story directly to the rector, he withdrew silently and\r\nungraciously to the window-seat. There he sat, his face averted, his\r\nhands mechanically turning the leaves of his father\xe2\x80\x99s letter till\r\nhe came to the last. With his eyes fixed on the closing lines of the\r\nmanuscript, and with a strange mixture of recklessness and sadness in\r\nhis voice, he began his promised narrative in these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing you know of me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis what my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfession has told you already. He mentions here that I was a child,\r\nasleep on his breast, when he spoke his last words in this world, and\r\nwhen a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s hand wrote them down for him at his deathbed.\r\nThat stranger\xe2\x80\x99s name, as you may have noticed, is signed on the\r\ncover--\xe2\x80\x98Alexander Neal, Writer to the Signet, Edinburgh.\xe2\x80\x99 The first\r\nrecollection I have is of Alexander Neal beating me with a horsewhip (I\r\ndare say I deserved it), in the character of my stepfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no recollection of your mother at the same time?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr.\r\nBrock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I remember her having shabby old clothes made up to fit me,\r\nand having fine new frocks bought for her two children by her second\r\nhusband. I remember the servants laughing at me in my old things, and\r\nthe horsewhip finding its way to my shoulders again for losing my temper\r\nand tearing my shabby clothes. My next recollection gets on to a year or\r\ntwo later. I remember myself locked up in a lumber-room, with a bit of\r\nbread and a mug of water, wondering what it was that made my mother and\r\nmy stepfather seem to hate the very sight of me. I never settled that\r\nquestion till yesterday, and then I solved the mystery, when my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter was put into my hands. My mother knew what had really happened\r\non board the French timber-ship, and my stepfather knew what had really\r\nhappened, and they were both well aware that the shameful secret which\r\nthey would fain have kept from every living creature was a secret\r\nwhich would be one day revealed to _me_. There was no help for\r\nit--the confession was in the executor\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and there was I, an\r\nill-conditioned brat, with my mother\xe2\x80\x99s negro blood in my face, and my\r\nmurdering father\xe2\x80\x99s passions in my heart, inheritor of their secret in\r\nspite of them! I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at the horsewhip now, or the shabby old\r\nclothes, or the bread and water in the lumber-room. Natural penalties\r\nall of them, sir, which the child was beginning to pay already for the\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brock looked at the swarthy, secret face, still obstinately turned\r\naway from him. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the stark insensibility of a vagabond,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cor the despair, in disguise, of a miserable man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchool is my next recollection,\xe2\x80\x9d the other went on--\xe2\x80\x9ca cheap place in a\r\nlost corner of Scotland. I was left there, with a bad character to\r\nhelp me at starting. I spare you the story of the master\xe2\x80\x99s cane in the\r\nschoolroom, and the boys\xe2\x80\x99 kicks in the playground. I dare say there was\r\ningrained ingratitude in my nature; at any rate, I ran away. The first\r\nperson who met me asked my name. I was too young and too foolish to know\r\nthe importance of concealing it, and, as a matter of course, I was taken\r\nback to school the same evening. The result taught me a lesson which I\r\nhave not forgotten since. In a day or two more, like the vagabond I\r\nwas, I ran away for the second time. The school watch-dog had had his\r\ninstructions, I suppose: he stopped me before I got outside the gate.\r\nHere is his mark, among the rest, on the back of my hand. His master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarks I can\xe2\x80\x99t show you; they are all on my back. Can you believe in my\r\nperversity? There was a devil in me that no dog could worry out. I\r\nran away again as soon as I left my bed, and this time I got off. At\r\nnightfall I found myself (with a pocketful of the school oatmeal) lost\r\non a moor. I lay down on the fine soft heather, under the lee of a\r\ngreat gray rock. Do you think I felt lonely? Not I! I was away from the\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s cane, away from my schoolfellows\xe2\x80\x99 kicks, away from my mother,\r\naway from my stepfather; and I lay down that night under my good friend\r\nthe rock, the happiest boy in all Scotland!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough the wretched childhood which that one significant circumstance\r\ndisclosed, Mr. Brock began to see dimly how little was really strange,\r\nhow little really unaccountable, in the character of the man who was now\r\nspeaking to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI slept soundly,\xe2\x80\x9d Midwinter continued, \xe2\x80\x9cunder my friend the rock. When\r\nI woke in the morning, I found a sturdy old man with a fiddle sitting\r\non one side of me, and two performing dogs on the other. Experience\r\nhad made me too sharp to tell the truth when the man put his first\r\nquestions. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t press them; he gave me a good breakfast out of his\r\nknapsack, and he let me romp with the dogs. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid, when he had got my confidence in this manner, \xe2\x80\x98you want three\r\nthings, my man: you want a new father, a new family, and a new name.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be your father. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you have the dogs for your brothers; and,\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ll promise to be very careful of it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you my own\r\nname into the bargain. Ozias Midwinter, Junior, you have had a good\r\nbreakfast; if you want a good dinner, come along with me!\xe2\x80\x99 He got up,\r\nthe dogs trotted after him, and I trotted after the dogs. Who was my new\r\nfather? you will ask. A half-breed gypsy, sir; a drunkard, a ruffian,\r\nand a thief--and the best friend I ever had! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t a man your friend who\r\ngives you your food, your shelter, and your education? Ozias Midwinter\r\ntaught me to dance the Highland fling, to throw somersaults, to walk\r\non stilts, and to sing songs to his fiddle. Sometimes we roamed the\r\ncountry, and performed at fairs. Sometimes we tried the large towns, and\r\nenlivened bad company over its cups. I was a nice, lively little boy of\r\neleven years old, and bad company, the women especially, took a fancy to\r\nme and my nimble feet. I was vagabond enough to like the life. The dogs\r\nand I lived together, ate, and drank, and slept together. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nof those poor little four-footed brothers of mine, even now, without a\r\nchoking in the throat. Many is the beating we three took together; many\r\nis the hard day\xe2\x80\x99s dancing we did together; many is the night we have\r\nslept together, and whimpered together, on the cold hill-side. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ntrying to distress you, sir; I\xe2\x80\x99m only telling you the truth. The life\r\nwith all its hardships was a life that fitted me, and the half-breed\r\ngypsy who gave me his name, ruffian as he was, was a ruffian I liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man who beat you!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Brock, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you just now, sir, that I lived with the dogs? and did\r\nyou ever hear of a dog who liked his master the worse for beating him?\r\nHundreds of thousands of miserable men, women, and children would have\r\nliked that man (as I liked him) if he had always given them what he\r\nalways gave me--plenty to eat. It was stolen food mostly, and my new\r\ngypsy father was generous with it. He seldom laid the stick on us when\r\nhe was sober; but it diverted him to hear us yelp when he was drunk. He\r\ndied drunk, and enjoyed his favorite amusement with his last breath. One\r\nday (when I had been two years in his service), after giving us a good\r\ndinner out on the moor, he sat down with his back against a stone, and\r\ncalled us up to divert himself with his stick. He made the dogs yelp\r\nfirst, and then he called to me. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go very willingly; he had been\r\ndrinking harder than usual, and the more he drank the better he liked\r\nhis after-dinner amusement. He was in high good-humor that day, and\r\nhe hit me so hard that he toppled over, in his drunken state, with the\r\nforce of his own blow. He fell with his face in a puddle, and lay there\r\nwithout moving. I and the dogs stood at a distance, and looked at him:\r\nwe thought he was feigning, to get us near and have another stroke at\r\nus. He feigned so long that we ventured up to him at last. It took me\r\nsome time to pull him over; he was a heavy man. When I did get him on\r\nhis back, he was dead. We made all the outcry we could; but the dogs\r\nwere little, and I was little, and the place was lonely; and no help\r\ncame to us. I took his fiddle and his stick; I said to my two brothers,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come along, we must get our own living now;\xe2\x80\x99 and we went away\r\nheavy-hearted, and left him on the moor. Unnatural as it may seem\r\nto you, I was sorry for him. I kept his ugly name through all my\r\nafter-wanderings, and I have enough of the old leaven left in me to like\r\nthe sound of it still. Midwinter or Armadale, never mind my name now, we\r\nwill talk of that afterward; you must know the worst of me first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not the best of you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock, gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir; but I am here to tell the truth. We will get on, if you\r\nplease, to the next chapter in my story. The dogs and I did badly, after\r\nour master\xe2\x80\x99s death; our luck was against us. I lost one of my little\r\nbrothers--the best performer of the two; he was stolen, and I never\r\nrecovered him. My fiddle and my stilts were taken from me next, by main\r\nforce, by a tramp who was stronger than I. These misfortunes drew Tommy\r\nand me--I beg your pardon, sir, I mean the dog--closer together than\r\never.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we had some kind of dim foreboding on both sides that we had not\r\ndone with our misfortunes yet; anyhow, it was not very long before we\r\nwere parted forever. We were neither of us thieves (our master had been\r\nsatisfied with teaching us to dance); but we both committed an invasion\r\nof the rights of property, for all that. Young creatures, even when\r\nthey are half starved, cannot resist taking a run sometimes on a fine\r\nmorning. Tommy and I could not resist taking a run into a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplantation; the gentleman preserved his game; and the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s keeper\r\nknew his business. I heard a gun go off; you can guess the rest. God\r\npreserve me from ever feeling such misery again as I felt when I lay\r\ndown by Tommy, and took him, dead and bloody, in my arms! The keeper\r\nattempted to part us; I bit him, like the wild animal I was. He tried\r\nthe stick on me next; he might as well have tried it on one of the\r\ntrees. The noise reached the ears of two young ladies riding near the\r\nplace--daughters of the gentleman on whose property I was a trespasser.\r\nThey were too well brought up to lift their voices against the sacred\r\nright of preserving game, but they were kind-hearted girls, and they\r\npitied me, and took me home with them. I remember the gentlemen of the\r\nhouse (keen sportsmen all of them) roaring with laughter as I went by\r\nthe windows, crying, with my little dead dog in my arms. Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\r\nI complain of their laughter; it did me good service; it roused the\r\nindignation of the two ladies. One of them took me into her own garden,\r\nand showed me a place where I might bury my dog under the flowers, and\r\nbe sure that no other hands should ever disturb him again. The other\r\nwent to her father, and persuaded him to give the forlorn little\r\nvagabond a chance in the house, under one of the upper servants. Yes!\r\nyou have been cruising in company with a man who was once a foot-boy.\r\nI saw you look at me, when I amused Mr. Armadale by laying the cloth\r\non board the yacht. Now you know why I laid it so neatly, and forgot\r\nnothing. It has been my good fortune to see something of society; I have\r\nhelped to fill its stomach and black its boots. My experience of the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 hall was not a long one. Before I had worn out my first suit\r\nof livery, there was a scandal in the house. It was the old story; there\r\nis no need to tell it over again for the thousandth time. Loose money\r\nleft on a table, and not found there again; all the servants with\r\ncharacters to appeal to except the foot-boy, who had been rashly taken\r\non trial. Well! well! I was lucky in that house to the last; I was not\r\nprosecuted for taking what I had not only never touched, but never even\r\nseen: I was only turned out. One morning I went in my old clothes to the\r\ngrave where I had buried Tommy. I gave the place a kiss; I said good-by\r\nto my little dead dog; and there I was, out in the world again, at the\r\nripe age of thirteen years!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that friendless state, and at that tender age,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock, \xe2\x80\x9cdid\r\nno thought cross your mind of going home again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went home again, sir, that very night--I slept on the hill-side. What\r\nother home had I? In a day or two\xe2\x80\x99s time I drifted back to the large\r\ntowns and the bad company, the great open country was so lonely to me,\r\nnow I had lost the dogs! Two sailors picked me up next. I was a handy\r\nlad, and I got a cabin-boy\xe2\x80\x99s berth on board a coasting-vessel. A\r\ncabin-boy\xe2\x80\x99s berth means dirt to live in, offal to eat, a man\xe2\x80\x99s work on\r\na boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, and the rope\xe2\x80\x99s-end at regular intervals. The vessel\r\ntouched at a port in the Hebrides. I was as ungrateful as usual to my\r\nbest benefactors; I ran away again. Some women found me, half dead of\r\nstarvation, in the northern wilds of the Isle of Skye. It was near the\r\ncoast and I took a turn with the fishermen next. There was less of the\r\nrope\xe2\x80\x99s-end among my new masters; but plenty of exposure to wind and\r\nweather, and hard work enough to have killed a boy who was not a\r\nseasoned tramp like me. I fought through it till the winter came, and\r\nthen the fishermen turned me adrift again. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame them; food was\r\nscarce, and mouths were many. With famine staring the whole community in\r\nthe face, why should they keep a boy who didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to them? A great\r\ncity was my only chance in the winter-time; so I went to Glasgow, and\r\nall but stepped into the lion\xe2\x80\x99s mouth as soon as I got there. I was\r\nminding an empty cart on the Broomielaw, when I heard my stepfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice on the pavement side of the horse by which I was standing. He had\r\nmet some person whom he knew, and, to my terror and surprise, they\r\nwere talking about me. Hidden behind the horse, I heard enough of their\r\nconversation to know that I had narrowly escaped discovery before I\r\nwent on board the coasting-vessel. I had met at that time with another\r\nvagabond boy of my own age; we had quarreled and parted. The day after,\r\nmy stepfather\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries were made in that very district, and it became\r\na question with him (a good personal description being unattainable in\r\neither case) which of the two boys he should follow. One of them, he was\r\ninformed, was known as \xe2\x80\x9cBrown,\xe2\x80\x9d and the other as \xe2\x80\x9cMidwinter.\xe2\x80\x9d Brown was\r\njust the common name which a cunning runaway boy would be most likely\r\nto assume; Midwinter, just the remarkable name which he would be most\r\nlikely to avoid. The pursuit had accordingly followed Brown, and had\r\nallowed me to escape. I leave you to imagine whether I was not doubly\r\nand trebly determined to keep my gypsy master\xe2\x80\x99s name after that. But\r\nmy resolution did not stop here. I made up my mind to leave the country\r\naltogether. After a day or two\xe2\x80\x99s lurking about the outward-bound vessels\r\nin port, I found out which sailed first, and hid myself on board. Hunger\r\ntried hard to force me out before the pilot had left; but hunger was not\r\nnew to me, and I kept my place. The pilot was out of the vessel when I\r\nmade my appearance on deck, and there was nothing for it but to keep me\r\nor throw me overboard. The captain said (I have no doubt quite truly)\r\nthat he would have preferred throwing me overboard; but the majesty of\r\nthe law does sometimes stand the friend even of a vagabond like me. In\r\nthat way I came back to a sea-life. In that way I learned enough to\r\nmake me handy and useful (as I saw you noticed) on board Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyacht. I sailed more than one voyage, in more than one vessel, to more\r\nthan one part of the world, and I might have followed the sea for life,\r\nif I could only have kept my temper under every provocation that could\r\nbe laid on it. I had learned a great deal; but, not having learned that,\r\nI made the last part of my last voyage home to the port of Bristol in\r\nirons; and I saw the inside of a prison for the first time in my life,\r\non a charge of mutinous conduct to one of my officers. You have heard me\r\nwith extraordinary patience, sir, and I am glad to tell you, in return,\r\nthat we are not far now from the end of my story. You found some books,\r\nif I remember right, when you searched my luggage at the Somersetshire\r\ninn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brock answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose books mark the next change in my life--and the last, before I\r\ntook the usher\xe2\x80\x99s place at the school. My term of imprisonment was not\r\na long one. Perhaps my youth pleaded for me; perhaps the Bristol\r\nmagistrates took into consideration the time I had passed in irons on\r\nboard ship. Anyhow, I was just turned seventeen when I found myself out\r\non the world again. I had no friends to receive me; I had no place to go\r\nto. A sailor\xe2\x80\x99s life, after what had happened, was a life I recoiled from\r\nin disgust. I stood in the crowd on the bridge at Bristol, wondering\r\nwhat I should do with my freedom now I had got it back. Whether I had\r\naltered in the prison, or whether I was feeling the change in character\r\nthat comes with coming manhood, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but the old reckless\r\nenjoyment of the old vagabond life seemed quite worn out of my nature.\r\nAn awful sense of loneliness kept me wandering about Bristol, in horror\r\nof the quiet country, till after nightfall. I looked at the lights\r\nkindling in the parlor windows, with a miserable envy of the happy\r\npeople inside. A word of advice would have been worth something to me\r\nat that time. Well! I got it: a policeman advised me to move on. He was\r\nquite right; what else could I do? I looked up at the sky, and there\r\nwas my old friend of many a night\xe2\x80\x99s watch at sea, the north star. \xe2\x80\x98All\r\npoints of the compass are alike to me,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought to myself; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\n_your_ way.\xe2\x80\x99 Not even the star would keep me company that night. It got\r\nbehind a cloud, and left me alone in the rain and darkness. I groped my\r\nway to a cart-shed, fell asleep, and dreamed of old times, when I served\r\nmy gypsy master and lived with the dogs. God! what I would have given\r\nwhen I woke to have felt Tommy\xe2\x80\x99s little cold muzzle in my hand! Why am\r\nI dwelling on these things? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I get on to the end? You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nencourage me, sir, by listening, so patiently. After a week more of\r\nwandering, without hope to help me, or prospects to look to, I found\r\nmyself in the streets of Shrewsbury, staring in at the windows of a\r\nbook-seller\xe2\x80\x99s shop. An old man came to the shop door, looked about him,\r\nand saw me. \xe2\x80\x98Do you want a job?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked. \xe2\x80\x98And are you not above\r\ndoing it cheap?\xe2\x80\x99 The prospect of having something to do, and some human\r\ncreature to speak a word to, tempted me, and I did a day\xe2\x80\x99s dirty work\r\nin the book-seller\xe2\x80\x99s warehouse for a shilling. More work followed at the\r\nsame rate. In a week I was promoted to sweep out the shop and put up the\r\nshutters. In no very long time after, I was trusted to carry the books\r\nout; and when quarter-day came, and the shop-man left, I took his place.\r\nWonderful luck! you will say; here I had found my way to a friend at\r\nlast. I had found my way to one of the most merciless misers in\r\nEngland; and I had risen in the little world of Shrewsbury by the purely\r\ncommercial process of underselling all my competitors. The job in the\r\nwarehouse had been declined at the price by every idle man in the town,\r\nand I did it. The regular porter received his weekly pittance under\r\nweekly protest. I took two shillings less, and made no complaint. The\r\nshop-man gave warning on the ground that he was underfed as well as\r\nunderpaid. I received half his salary, and lived contentedly on his\r\nreversionary scraps. Never were two men so well suited to each other as\r\nthat book-seller and I. _His_ one object in life was to find somebody\r\nwho would work for him at starvation wages. _My_ one object in life was\r\nto find somebody who would give me an asylum over my head. Without a\r\nsingle sympathy in common--without a vestige of feeling of any sort,\r\nhostile or friendly, growing up between us on either side--without\r\nwishing each other good-night when we parted on the house stairs, or\r\ngood-morning when we met at the shop counter, we lived alone in that\r\nhouse, strangers from first to last, for two whole years. A dismal\r\nexistence for a lad of my age, was it not? You are a clergyman and a\r\nscholar--surely you can guess what made the life endurable to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brock remembered the well-worn volumes which had been found in the\r\nusher\xe2\x80\x99s bag. \xe2\x80\x9cThe books made it endurable to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the castaway kindled with a new light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe books--the generous friends who met me without\r\nsuspicion--the merciful masters who never used me ill! The only years of\r\nmy life that I can look back on with something like pride are the years\r\nI passed in the miser\xe2\x80\x99s house. The only unalloyed pleasure I have ever\r\ntasted is the pleasure that I found for myself on the miser\xe2\x80\x99s shelves.\r\nEarly and late, through the long winter nights and the quiet summer\r\ndays, I drank at the fountain of knowledge, and never wearied of the\r\ndraught. There were few customers to serve, for the books were mostly of\r\nthe solid and scholarly kind. No responsibilities rested on me, for the\r\naccounts were kept by my master, and only the small sums of money were\r\nsuffered to pass through my hands. He soon found out enough of me to\r\nknow that my honesty was to be trusted, and that my patience might be\r\ncounted on, treat me as he might. The one insight into _his_ character\r\nwhich I obtained, on my side, widened the distance between us to its\r\nlast limits. He was a confirmed opium-eater in secret--a prodigal in\r\nlaudanum, though a miser in all besides. He never confessed his frailty,\r\nand I never told him I had found it out. He had his pleasure apart from\r\nme, and I had my pleasure apart from _him_. Week after week, month after\r\nmonth, there we sat, without a friendly word ever passing between us--I,\r\nalone with my book at the counter; he, alone with his ledger in the\r\nparlor, dimly visible to me through the dirty window-pane of the glass\r\ndoor, sometimes poring over his figures, sometimes lost and motionless\r\nfor hours in the ecstasy of his opium trance. Time passed, and made no\r\nimpression on us; the seasons of two years came and went, and found\r\nus still unchanged. One morning, at the opening of the third year, my\r\nmaster did not appear, as usual, to give me my allowance for breakfast.\r\nI went upstairs, and found him helpless in his bed. He refused to trust\r\nme with the keys of the cupboard, or to let me send for a doctor.\r\nI bought a morsel of bread, and went back to my books, with no more\r\nfeeling for _him_ (I honestly confess it) than he would have had for\r\n_me_ under the same circumstances. An hour or two later I was roused\r\nfrom my reading by an occasional customer of ours, a retired medical\r\nman. He went upstairs. I was glad to get rid of him and return to my\r\nbooks. He came down again, and disturbed me once more. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t much\r\nlike you, my lad,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98but I think it my duty to say that you will\r\nsoon have to shift for yourself. You are no great favorite in the\r\ntown, and you may have some difficulty in finding a new place. Provide\r\nyourself with a written character from your master before it is too\r\nlate.\xe2\x80\x99 He spoke to me coldly. I thanked him coldly on my side, and got\r\nmy character the same day. Do you think my master let me have it\r\nfor nothing? Not he! He bargained with me on his deathbed. I was his\r\ncreditor for a month\xe2\x80\x99s salary, and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t write a line of my\r\ntestimonial until I had first promised to forgive him the debt. Three\r\ndays afterward he died, enjoying to the last the happiness of having\r\noverreached his shop-man. \xe2\x80\x98Aha!\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered, when the doctor\r\nformally summoned me to take leave of him, \xe2\x80\x98I got you cheap!\xe2\x80\x99 Was Ozias\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s stick as cruel as that? I think not. Well! there I was, out\r\non the world again, but surely with better prospects this time. I had\r\ntaught myself to read Latin, Greek, and German; and I had got my written\r\ncharacter to speak for me. All useless! The doctor was quite right; I\r\nwas not liked in the town. The lower order of the people despised me for\r\nselling my services to the miser at the miser\xe2\x80\x99s price. As for the better\r\nclasses, I did with them (God knows how!) what I have always done with\r\neverybody except Mr. Armadale--I produced a disagreeable impression at\r\nfirst sight; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t mend it afterward; and there was an end of me\r\nin respectable quarters. It is quite likely I might have spent all my\r\nsavings, my puny little golden offspring of two years\xe2\x80\x99 miserable\r\ngrowth, but for a school advertisement which I saw in a local paper. The\r\nheartlessly mean terms that were offered encouraged me to apply; and I\r\ngot the place. How I prospered in it, and what became of me next, there\r\nis no need to tell you. The thread of my story is all wound off; my\r\nvagabond life stands stripped of its mystery; and you know the worst of\r\nme at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nA moment of silence followed those closing words. Midwinter rose from\r\nthe window-seat, and came back to the table with the letter from Wildbad\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father\xe2\x80\x99s confession has told you who I am; and my own confession has\r\ntold you what my life has been,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing Mr. Brock, without\r\ntaking the chair to which the rector pointed. \xe2\x80\x9cI promised to make a\r\nclean breast of it when I first asked leave to enter this room. Have I\r\nkept my word?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible to doubt it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brock. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have established\r\nyour claim on my confidence and my sympathy. I should be insensible,\r\nindeed, if I could know what I now know of your childhood and your\r\nyouth, and not feel something of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s kindness for Allan\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, simply and gravely.\r\n\r\nHe sat down opposite Mr. Brook at the table for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a few hours you will have left this place,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I can\r\nhelp you to leave it with your mind at ease, I will. There is more to be\r\nsaid between us than we have said up to this time. My future relations\r\nwith Mr. Armadale are still left undecided; and the serious question\r\nraised by my father\xe2\x80\x99s letter is a question which we have neither of us\r\nfaced yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and looked with a momentary impatience at the candle still\r\nburning on the table, in the morning light. The struggle to speak with\r\ncomposure, and to keep his own feelings stoically out of view, was\r\nevidently growing harder and harder to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may possibly help your decision,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cif I tell you how I\r\ndetermined to act toward Mr. Armadale--in the matter of the similarity\r\nof our names--when I first read this letter, and when I had composed\r\nmyself sufficiently to be able to think at all.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, and cast\r\na second impatient look at the lighted candle. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you excuse the odd\r\nfancy of an odd man?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a faint smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to put out\r\nthe candle: I want to speak of the new subject, in the new light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe extinguished the candle as he spoke, and let the first tenderness of\r\nthe daylight flow uninterruptedly into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must once more ask your patience,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cif I return for a\r\nmoment to myself and my circumstances. I have already told you that my\r\nstepfather made an attempt to discover me some years after I had turned\r\nmy back on the Scotch school. He took that step out of no anxiety of his\r\nown, but simply as the agent of my father\xe2\x80\x99s trustees. In the exercise of\r\ntheir discretion, they had sold the estates in Barbadoes (at the time\r\nof the emancipation of the slaves, and the ruin of West Indian property)\r\nfor what the estates would fetch. Having invested the proceeds,\r\nthey were bound to set aside a sum for my yearly education. This\r\nresponsibility obliged them to make the attempt to trace me--a fruitless\r\nattempt, as you already know. A little later (as I have been since\r\ninformed) I was publicly addressed by an advertisement in the\r\nnewspapers, which I never saw. Later still, when I was twenty-one, a\r\nsecond advertisement appeared (which I did see) offering a reward for\r\nevidence of my death. If I was alive, I had a right to my half share\r\nof the proceeds of the estates on coming of age; if dead, the money\r\nreverted to my mother. I went to the lawyers, and heard from them what\r\nI have just told you. After some difficulty in proving my identity--and\r\nafter an interview with my stepfather, and a message from my mother,\r\nwhich has hopelessly widened the old breach between us--my claim was\r\nallowed; and my money is now invested for me in the funds, under the\r\nname that is really my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brock drew eagerly nearer to the table. He saw the end now to which\r\nthe speaker was tending\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwice a year,\xe2\x80\x9d Midwinter pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cI must sign my own name to get my\r\nown income. At all other times, and under all other circumstances, I\r\nmay hide my identity under any name I please. As Ozias Midwinter, Mr.\r\nArmadale first knew me; as Ozias Midwinter he shall know me to the end\r\nof my days. Whatever may be the result of this interview--whether I win\r\nyour confidence or whether I lose it--of one thing you may feel sure:\r\nyour pupil shall never know the horrible secret which I have trusted\r\nto your keeping. This is no extraordinary resolution; for, as you know\r\nalready, it costs me no sacrifice of feeling to keep my assumed name.\r\nThere is nothing in my conduct to praise; it comes naturally out of the\r\ngratitude of a thankful man. Review the circumstances for yourself,\r\nsir, and set my own horror of revealing them to Mr. Armadale out of\r\nthe question. If the story of the names is ever told, there can be no\r\nlimiting it to the disclosure of my father\xe2\x80\x99s crime; it must go back to\r\nthe story of Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. I have heard her son talk of her;\r\nI know how he loves her memory. As God is my witness, he shall never\r\nlove it less dearly through _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimply as the words were spoken, they touched the deepest sympathies\r\nin the rector\xe2\x80\x99s nature: they took his thoughts back to Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeathbed. There sat the man against whom she had ignorantly warned him\r\nin her son\xe2\x80\x99s interests; and that man, of his own free-will, had laid on\r\nhimself the obligation of respecting her secret for her son\xe2\x80\x99s sake! The\r\nmemory of his own past efforts to destroy the very friendship out of\r\nwhich this resolution had sprung rose and reproached Mr. Brock. He held\r\nout his hand to Midwinter for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cIn her name, and in her\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, warmly, \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout replying, Midwinter spread the confession open before him on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I have said all that it was my duty to say,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore\r\nwe could approach the consideration of this letter. Whatever may have\r\nappeared strange in my conduct toward you and toward Mr. Armadale may\r\nbe now trusted to explain itself. You can easily imagine the natural\r\ncuriosity and surprise that I must have felt (ignorant as I then was of\r\nthe truth) when the sound of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s name first startled me as\r\nthe echo of my own. You will readily understand that I only hesitated\r\nto tell him I was his namesake, because I hesitated to damage my\r\nposition--in your estimation, if not in his--by confessing that I had\r\ncome among you under an assumed name. And, after all that you have just\r\nheard of my vagabond life and my low associates, you will hardly wonder\r\nat the obstinate silence I maintained about myself, at a time when I did\r\nnot feel the sense of responsibility which my father\xe2\x80\x99s confession has\r\nlaid on me. We can return to these small personal explanations, if you\r\nwish it, at another time; they cannot be suffered to keep us from the\r\ngreater interests which we must settle before you leave this place.\r\nWe may come now--\xe2\x80\x9d His voice faltered, and he suddenly turned his face\r\ntoward the window, so as to hide it from the rector\xe2\x80\x99s view. \xe2\x80\x9cWe may come\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, his hand trembling visibly as it held the page,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto the murder on board the timber-ship, and to the warning that has\r\nfollowed me from my father\xe2\x80\x99s grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoftly--as if he feared they might reach Allan, sleeping in the\r\nneighboring room--he read the last terrible words which the Scotchman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npen had written at Wildbad, as they fell from his father\xe2\x80\x99s lips:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAvoid the widow of the man I killed--if the widow still lives. Avoid\r\nthe maid whose wicked hand smoothed the way to the marriage--if the maid\r\nis still in her service. And, more than all, avoid the man who bears the\r\nsame name as your own. Offend your best benefactor, if that benefactor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence has connected you one with the other. Desert the woman who\r\nloves you, if that woman is a link between you and him. Hide yourself\r\nfrom him under an assumed name. Put the mountains and the seas between\r\nyou; be ungrateful; be unforgiving; be all that is most repellent\r\nto your own gentler nature, rather than live under the same roof and\r\nbreathe the same air with that man. Never let the two Allan Armadales\r\nmeet in this world; never, never, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter reading those sentences, he pushed the manuscript from him,\r\nwithout looking up. The fatal reserve which he had been in a fair way of\r\nconquering but a few minutes since, possessed itself of him once more.\r\nAgain his eyes wandered; again his voice sank in tone. A stranger who\r\nhad heard his story, and who saw him now, would have said, \xe2\x80\x9cHis look is\r\nlurking, his manner is bad; he is, every inch of him, his father\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a question to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock, breaking the silence\r\nbetween them, on his side. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you just read that passage in your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo force me into telling you the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nknow how much there is of my father in me before you trust me to be Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s friend. I got my letter yesterday, in the morning. Some inner\r\nwarning troubled me, and I went down on the sea-shore by myself before I\r\nbroke the seal. Do you believe the dead can come back to the world they\r\nonce lived in? I believe my father came back in that bright morning\r\nlight, through the glare of that broad sunshine and the roar of that\r\njoyful sea, and watched me while I read. When I got to the words that\r\nyou have just heard, and when I knew that the very end which he had died\r\ndreading was the end that had really come, I felt the horror that had\r\ncrept over him in his last moments creeping over me. I struggled against\r\nmyself, as _he_ would have had me struggle. I tried to be all that was\r\nmost repellent to my own gentler nature; I tried to think pitilessly of\r\nputting the mountains and the seas between me and the man who bore my\r\nname. Hours passed before I could prevail on myself to go back and run\r\nthe risk of meeting Allan Armadale in this house. When I did get back,\r\nand when he met me at night on the stairs, I thought I was looking him\r\nin the face as _my_ father looked _his_ father in the face when the\r\ncabin door closed between them. Draw your own conclusions, sir. Say, if\r\nyou like, that the inheritance of my father\xe2\x80\x99s heathen belief in fate is\r\none of the inheritances he has left to me. I won\xe2\x80\x99t dispute it; I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t deny that all through yesterday _his_ superstition was _my_\r\nsuperstition. The night came before I could find my way to calmer and\r\nbrighter thoughts. But I did find my way. You may set it down in my\r\nfavor that I lifted myself at last above the influence of this horrible\r\nletter. Do you know what helped me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you reason with yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t reason about what I feel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you quiet your mind by prayer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not fit to pray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet something guided you to the better feeling and the truer view?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy love for Allan Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe cast a doubting, almost a timid look at Mr. Brock as he gave that\r\nanswer, and, suddenly leaving the table, went back to the window-seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I no right to speak of him in that way?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, keeping his\r\nface hidden from the rector. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I not known him long enough; have I\r\nnot done enough for him yet? Remember what my experience of other men\r\nhad been when I first saw his hand held out to me--when I first heard\r\nhis voice speaking to me in my sick-room. What had I known of strangers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhands all through my childhood? I had only known them as hands raised to\r\nthreaten and to strike me. His hand put my pillow straight, and patted\r\nme on the shoulder, and gave me my food and drink. What had I known of\r\nother men\xe2\x80\x99s voices, when I was growing up to be a man myself? I had\r\nonly known them as voices that jeered, voices that cursed, voices that\r\nwhispered in corners with a vile distrust. _His_ voice said to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cheer up, Midwinter! we\xe2\x80\x99ll soon bring you round again. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be strong\r\nenough in a week to go out for a drive with me in our Somersetshire\r\nlanes.\xe2\x80\x99 Think of the gypsy\xe2\x80\x99s stick; think of the devils laughing at me\r\nwhen I went by their windows with my little dead dog in my arms; think\r\nof the master who cheated me of my month\xe2\x80\x99s salary on his deathbed--and\r\nask your own heart if the miserable wretch whom Allan Armadale has\r\ntreated as his equal and his friend has said too much in saying that\r\nhe loves him? I do love him! It _will_ come out of me; I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep it\r\nback. I love the very ground he treads on! I would give my life--yes,\r\nthe life that is precious to me now, because his kindness has made it a\r\nhappy one--I tell you I would give my life--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next words died away on his lips; the hysterical passion rose, and\r\nconquered him. He stretched out one of his hands with a wild gesture\r\nof entreaty to Mr. Brock; his head sank on the window-sill and he burst\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\nEven then the hard discipline of the man\xe2\x80\x99s life asserted itself. He\r\nexpected no sympathy, he counted on no merciful human respect for human\r\nweakness. The cruel necessity of self-suppression was present to his\r\nmind, while the tears were pouring over his cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll fight it down in a minute; I won\xe2\x80\x99t distress you\r\nin this way again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrue to his resolution, in a minute he had fought it down. In a minute\r\nmore he was able to speak calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will get back, sir, to those better thoughts which have brought me\r\nfrom my room to yours,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cI can only repeat that I should\r\nnever have torn myself from the hold which this letter fastened on\r\nme, if I had not loved Allan Armadale with all that I have in me of a\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s love. I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98If the thought of leaving him breaks\r\nmy heart, the thought of leaving him is wrong!\xe2\x80\x99 That was some hours\r\nsince, and I am in the same mind still. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe--I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve--that a friendship which has grown out of nothing but kindness\r\non one side, and nothing but gratitude on the other, is destined to lead\r\nto an evil end. Judge, you who are a clergyman, between the dead father,\r\nwhose word is in these pages, and the living son, whose word is now on\r\nhis lips! What is it appointed me to do, now that I am breathing the\r\nsame air, and living under the same roof with the son of the man whom my\r\nfather killed--to perpetuate my father\xe2\x80\x99s crime by mortally injuring him,\r\nor to atone for my father\xe2\x80\x99s crime by giving him the devotion of my whole\r\nlife? The last of those two faiths is my faith, and shall be my faith,\r\nhappen what may. In the strength of that better conviction, I have come\r\nhere to trust you with my father\xe2\x80\x99s secret, and to confess the wretched\r\nstory of my own life. In the strength of that better conviction, I can\r\nface you resolutely with the one plain question, which marks the one\r\nplain end of all that I have come here to say. Your pupil stands at the\r\nstarting-point of his new career, in a position singularly friendless;\r\nhis one great need is a companion of his own age on whom he can rely.\r\nThe time has come, sir, to decide whether I am to be that companion or\r\nnot. After all you have heard of Ozias Midwinter, tell me plainly, will\r\nyou trust him to be Allan Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brock met that fearlessly frank question by a fearless frankness on\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you love Allan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I believe you have spoken the\r\ntruth. A man who has produced that impression on me is a man whom I am\r\nbound to trust. I trust you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter started to his feet, his dark face flushing deep; his eyes\r\nfixed brightly and steadily, at last, on the rector\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cA light!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he exclaimed, tearing the pages of his father\xe2\x80\x99s letter, one by one, from\r\nthe fastening that held them. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us destroy the last link that holds\r\nus to the horrible past! Let us see this confession a heap of ashes\r\nbefore we part!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore you burn it, there is a reason for\r\nlooking at it once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe parted leaves of the manuscript dropped from Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Mr.\r\nBrock took them up, and sorted them carefully until he found the last\r\npage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI view your father\xe2\x80\x99s superstition as you view it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the rector.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is a warning given you here, which you will do well (for\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s sake and for your own sake) not to neglect. The last link with\r\nthe past will not be destroyed when you have burned these pages. One of\r\nthe actors in this story of treachery and murder is not dead yet. Read\r\nthose words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pushed the page across the table, with his finger on one sentence.\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s agitation misled him. He mistook the indication, and read,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAvoid the widow of the man I killed, if the widow still lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d said the rector. \xe2\x80\x9cThe next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter read it: \xe2\x80\x9cAvoid the maid whose wicked hand smoothed the way to\r\nthe marriage, if the maid is still in her service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe maid and the mistress parted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock, \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of\r\nthe mistress\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. The maid and the mistress met again at Mrs.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s residence in Somersetshire last year. I myself met the\r\nwoman in the village, and I myself know that her visit hastened Mrs.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s death. Wait a little, and compose yourself; I see I have\r\nstartled you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited as he was bid, his color fading away to a gray paleness and\r\nthe light in his clear brown eyes dying out slowly. What the rector had\r\nsaid had produced no transient impression on him; there was more than\r\ndoubt, there was alarm in his face, as he sat lost in his own thought.\r\nWas the struggle of the past night renewing itself already? Did he feel\r\nthe horror of his hereditary superstition creeping over him again?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you put me on my guard against her?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, after a long\r\ninterval of silence. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me her name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only tell you what Mrs. Armadale told me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Brock.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman acknowledged having been married in the long interval since\r\nshe and her mistress had last met. But not a word more escaped her about\r\nher past life. She came to Mrs. Armadale to ask for money, under a\r\nplea of distress. She got the money, and she left the house, positively\r\nrefusing, when the question was put to her, to mention her married\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw her yourself in the village. What was she like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe kept her veil down. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can tell me what you _did_ see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. I saw, as she approached me, that she moved very gracefully,\r\nthat she had a beautiful figure, and that she was a little over the\r\nmiddle height. I noticed, when she asked me the way to Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, that her manner was the manner of a lady, and that the tone\r\nof her voice was remarkably soft and winning. Lastly, I remembered\r\nafterward that she wore a thick black veil, a black bonnet, a black\r\nsilk dress, and a red Paisley shawl. I feel all the importance of your\r\npossessing some better means of identifying her than I can give you. But\r\nunhappily--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped. Midwinter was leaning eagerly across the table, and\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s hand was laid suddenly on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that you know the woman?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Brock, surprised at\r\nthe sudden change in his manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I said, then, that has startled you so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember the woman who threw herself from the river steamer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n asked the other--\xe2\x80\x9cthe woman who caused that succession of deaths which\r\nopened Allan Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s way to the Thorpe Ambrose estate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember the description of her in the police report,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nrector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That_ woman,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Midwinter, \xe2\x80\x9cmoved gracefully, and had a\r\nbeautiful figure. _That_ woman wore a black veil, a black bonnet, a\r\nblack silk gown, and a red Paisley shawl--\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, released his\r\nhold of Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and abruptly resumed his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be\r\nthe same?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9c_Is_ there a fatality\r\nthat follows men in the dark? And is it following _us_ in that woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfootsteps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the conjecture was right, the one event in the past which had\r\nappeared to be entirely disconnected with the events that had preceded\r\nit was, on the contrary, the one missing link which made the chain\r\ncomplete. Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable common sense instinctively denied that\r\nstartling conclusion. He looked at Midwinter with a compassionate smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, kindly, \xe2\x80\x9chave you cleared your mind of all\r\nsuperstition as completely as you think? Is what you have just said\r\nworthy of the better resolution at which you arrived last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s head drooped on his breast; the color rushed back over his\r\nface; he sighed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are beginning to doubt my sincerity,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t blame you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe in your sincerity as firmly as ever,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Brock. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nonly doubt whether you have fortified the weak places in your nature as\r\nstrongly as you yourself suppose. Many a man has lost the battle against\r\nhimself far oftener than you have lost it yet, and has nevertheless won\r\nhis victory in the end. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t distrust you. I only\r\nnotice what has happened, to put you on your guard against yourself.\r\nCome! come! Let your own better sense help you; and you will agree with\r\nme that there is really no evidence to justify the suspicion that the\r\nwoman whom I met in Somersetshire, and the woman who attempted suicide\r\nin London, are one and the same. Need an old man like me remind a young\r\nman like you that there are thousands of women in England with beautiful\r\nfigures--thousands of women who are quietly dressed in black silk gowns\r\nand red Paisley shawls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter caught eagerly at the suggestion; too eagerly, as it might\r\nhave occurred to a harder critic on humanity than Mr. Brock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am quite wrong. Tens of\r\nthousands of women answer the description, as you say. I have been\r\nwasting time on my own idle fancies, when I ought to have been carefully\r\ngathering up facts. If this woman ever attempts to find her way to\r\nAllan, I must be prepared to stop her.\xe2\x80\x9d He began searching restlessly\r\namong the manuscript leaves scattered about the table, paused over one\r\nof the pages, and examined it attentively. \xe2\x80\x9cThis helps me to something\r\npositive,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on; \xe2\x80\x9cthis helps me to a knowledge of her age. She was\r\ntwelve at the time of Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s marriage; add a year, and bring\r\nher to thirteen; add Allan\xe2\x80\x99s age (twenty-two), and we make her a woman\r\nof five-and-thirty at the present time. I know her age; and I know that\r\nshe has her own reasons for being silent about her married life. This is\r\nsomething gained at the outset, and it may lead, in time, to something\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked up brightly again at Mr. Brock. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I in the right way\r\nnow, sir? Am I doing my best to profit by the caution which you have\r\nkindly given me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are vindicating your own better sense,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the rector,\r\nencouraging him to trample down his own imagination, with an\r\nEnglishman\xe2\x80\x99s ready distrust of the noblest of the human faculties. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare paving the way for your own happier life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nHe searched among the papers once more, and stopped at another of the\r\nscattered pages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ship!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, suddenly, his color changing again, and his\r\nmanner altering on the instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ship?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the rector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ship in which the deed was done,\xe2\x80\x9d Midwinter answered, with the\r\nfirst signs of impatience that he had shown yet. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ship in which my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s murderous hand turned the lock of the cabin door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock.\r\n\r\nHe appeared not to hear the question; his eyes remained fixed intently\r\non the page that he was reading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA French vessel, employed in the timber trade,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, still speaking\r\nto himself--\xe2\x80\x9ca French vessel, named _La Grace de Dieu_. If my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbelief had been the right belief--if the fatality had been following me,\r\nstep by step, from my father\xe2\x80\x99s grave, in one or other of my voyages, I\r\nshould have fallen in with that ship.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked up again at Mr. Brock.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite sure about it now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThose women are two, and not\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brock shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you have come to that conclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I wish you\r\nhad reached it in some other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter started passionately to his feet, and, seizing on the pages of\r\nthe manuscript with both hands, flung them into the empty fireplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake let me burn it!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as there is a\r\npage left, I shall read it. And, as long as I read it, my father gets\r\nthe better of me, in spite of myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brock pointed to the match-box. In another moment the confession\r\nwas in flames. When the fire had consumed the last morsel of paper,\r\nMidwinter drew a deep breath of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may say, like Macbeth: \xe2\x80\x98Why, so, being gone, I am a man again!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he broke out with a feverish gayety. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look fatigued, sir; and no\r\nwonder,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a lower tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI have kept you too long from your\r\nrest--I will keep you no longer. Depend on my remembering what you\r\nhave told me; depend on my standing between Allan and any enemy, man\r\nor woman, who comes near him. Thank you, Mr. Brock; a thousand thousand\r\ntimes, thank you! I came into this room the most wretched of living men;\r\nI can leave it now as happy as the birds that are singing outside!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he turned to the door, the rays of the rising sun streamed through\r\nthe window, and touched the heap of ashes lying black in the black\r\nfireplace. The sensitive imagination of Midwinter kindled instantly at\r\nthe sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, joyously. \xe2\x80\x9cThe promise of the Future shining over the\r\nashes of the Past!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn inexplicable pity for the man, at the moment of his life when he\r\nneeded pity least, stole over the rector\xe2\x80\x99s heart when the door had\r\nclosed, and he was left by himself again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with an uneasy surprise at his own compassionate\r\nimpulse. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. DAY AND NIGHT\r\n\r\nThe morning hours had passed; the noon had come and gone; and Mr. Brock\r\nhad started on the first stage of his journey home.\r\n\r\nAfter parting from the rector in Douglas Harbor, the two young men had\r\nreturned to Castletown, and had there separated at the hotel door, Allan\r\nwalking down to the waterside to look after his yacht, and Midwinter\r\nentering the house to get the rest that he needed after a sleepless\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nHe darkened his room; he closed his eyes, but no sleep came to him.\r\nOn this first day of the rector\xe2\x80\x99s absence, his sensitive nature\r\nextravagantly exaggerated the responsibility which he now held in trust\r\nfor Mr. Brock. A nervous dread of leaving Allan by himself, even for a\r\nfew hours only, kept him waking and doubting, until it became a relief\r\nrather than a hardship to rise from the bed again, and, following in\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps, to take the way to the waterside which led to the\r\nyacht.\r\n\r\nThe repairs of the little vessel were nearly completed. It was a breezy,\r\ncheerful day; the land was bright, the water was blue, the quick waves\r\nleaped crisply in the sunshine, the men were singing at their work.\r\nDescending to the cabin, Midwinter discovered his friend busily\r\noccupied in attempting to set the place to rights. Habitually the least\r\nsystematic of mortals, Allan now and then awoke to an overwhelming sense\r\nof the advantages of order, and on such occasions a perfect frenzy of\r\ntidiness possessed him. He was down on his knees, hotly and wildly at\r\nwork, when Midwinter looked in on him; and was fast reducing the neat\r\nlittle world of the cabin to its original elements of chaos, with a\r\nmisdirected energy wonderful to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a mess!\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, rising composedly on the horizon of his own\r\naccumulated litter. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, my dear fellow, I begin to wish I had\r\nlet well alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter smiled, and came to his friend\xe2\x80\x99s assistance with the natural\r\nneat-handedness of a sailor.\r\n\r\nThe first object that he encountered was Allan\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-case, turned\r\nupside down, with half the contents scattered on the floor, and with\r\na duster and a hearth-broom lying among them. Replacing the various\r\nobjects which formed the furniture of the dressing-case one by\r\none, Midwinter lighted unexpectedly on a miniature portrait, of the\r\nold-fashioned oval form, primly framed in a setting of small diamonds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to set much value on this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan bent over him, and looked at the miniature. \xe2\x80\x9cIt belonged to my\r\nmother,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9cand I set the greatest value on it. It is a\r\nportrait of my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter put the miniature abruptly, into Allan\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and withdrew\r\nto the opposite side of the cabin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know best where the things ought to be put in your own\r\ndressing-case,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, keeping his back turned on Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nthe place tidy on this side of the cabin, and you shall make the place\r\ntidy on the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began setting in order the litter scattered about him on the cabin\r\ntable and on the floor. But it seemed as if fate had decided that his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s personal possessions should fall into his hands that morning,\r\nemploy them where he might. One among the first objects which he took\r\nup was Allan\xe2\x80\x99s tobacco jar, with the stopper missing, and with a letter\r\n(which appeared by the bulk of it to contain inclosures) crumpled into\r\nthe mouth of the jar in the stopper\xe2\x80\x99s place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you know that you had put this here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the letter of\r\nany importance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan recognized it instantly. It was the first of the little series of\r\nletters which had followed the cruising party to the Isle of Man--the\r\nletter which young Armadale had briefly referred to as bringing him\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmore worries from those everlasting lawyers,\xe2\x80\x9d and had then dismissed\r\nfrom further notice as recklessly as usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what comes of being particularly careful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan; \xe2\x80\x9chere is\r\nan instance of my extreme thoughtfulness. You may not think it but I put\r\nthe letter there on purpose. Every time I went to the jar, you know, I\r\nwas sure to see the letter; and every time I saw the letter, I was sure\r\nto say to myself, \xe2\x80\x98This must be answered.\xe2\x80\x99 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to laugh at;\r\nit was a perfectly sensible arrangement, if I could only have remembered\r\nwhere I put the jar. Suppose I tie a knot in my pocket-handkerchief this\r\ntime? You have a wonderful memory, my dear fellow. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll remind\r\nme in the course of the day, in case I forget the knot next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter saw his first chance, since Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s departure, of usefully\r\nfilling Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is your writing-case,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not answer the letter at\r\nonce? If you put it away again, you may forget it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the worst of it is, I can\xe2\x80\x99t quite make\r\nup my mind what answer to write. I want a word of advice. Come and sit\r\ndown here, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith his loud boyish laugh--echoed by Midwinter, who caught the\r\ninfection of his gayety--he swept a heap of miscellaneous incumbrances\r\noff the cabin sofa, and made room for his friend and himself to take\r\ntheir places. In the high flow of youthful spirits, the two sat down to\r\ntheir trifling consultation over a letter lost in a tobacco jar. It was\r\na memorable moment to both of them, lightly as they thought of it at the\r\ntime. Before they had risen again from their places, they had taken the\r\nfirst irrevocable step together on the dark and tortuous road of their\r\nfuture lives.\r\n\r\nReduced to plain facts, the question on which Allan now required his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s advice may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\nWhile the various arrangements connected with the succession to Thorpe\r\nAmbrose were in progress of settlement, and while the new possessor\r\nof the estate was still in London, a question had necessarily arisen\r\nrelating to the person who should be appointed to manage the property.\r\nThe steward employed by the Blanchard family had written, without loss\r\nof time, to offer his services. Although a perfectly competent and\r\ntrustworthy man, he failed to find favor in the eyes of the new\r\nproprietor. Acting, as usual, on his first impulses, and resolved,\r\nat all hazards, to install Midwinter as a permanent inmate at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose, Allan had determined that the steward\xe2\x80\x99s place was the place\r\nexactly fitted for his friend, for the simple reason that it would\r\nnecessarily oblige his friend to live with him on the estate. He\r\nhad accordingly written to decline the proposal made to him without\r\nconsulting Mr. Brock, whose disapproval he had good reason to fear; and\r\nwithout telling Midwinter, who would probably (if a chance were allowed\r\nhim of choosing) have declined taking a situation which his previous\r\ntraining had by no means fitted him to fill.\r\n\r\nFurther correspondence had followed this decision, and had raised two\r\nnew difficulties which looked a little embarrassing on the face of them,\r\nbut which Allan, with the assistance of his lawyer, easily contrived to\r\nsolve. The first difficulty, of examining the outgoing steward\xe2\x80\x99s books,\r\nwas settled by sending a professional accountant to Thorpe Ambrose; and\r\nthe second difficulty, of putting the steward\xe2\x80\x99s empty cottage to some\r\nprofitable use (Allan\xe2\x80\x99s plans for his friend comprehending Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresidence under his own roof), was met by placing the cottage on the\r\nlist of an active house agent in the neighboring county town. In this\r\nstate the arrangements had been left when Allan quitted London. He had\r\nheard and thought nothing more of the matter, until a letter from his\r\nlawyers had followed him to the Isle of Man, inclosing two proposals\r\nto occupy the cottage, both received on the same day, and requesting to\r\nhear, at his earliest convenience, which of the two he was prepared to\r\naccept.\r\n\r\nFinding himself, after having conveniently forgotten the subject for\r\nsome days past, placed face to face once more with the necessity for\r\ndecision, Allan now put the two proposals into his friend\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and,\r\nafter a rambling explanation of the circumstances of the case, requested\r\nto be favored with a word of advice. Instead of examining the proposals,\r\nMidwinter unceremoniously put them aside, and asked the two very natural\r\nand very awkward questions of who the new steward was to be, and why he\r\nwas to live in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s house?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you who, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why, when we get to Thorpe\r\nAmbrose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime we\xe2\x80\x99ll call the steward X. Y. Z.,\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99ll say he lives with me, because I\xe2\x80\x99m devilish sharp, and I mean\r\nto keep him under my own eye. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t look surprised. I know the man\r\nthoroughly well; he requires a good deal of management. If I offered him\r\nthe steward\xe2\x80\x99s place beforehand, his modesty would get in his way, and he\r\nwould say \xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99 If I pitch him into it neck and crop, without a word of\r\nwarning and with nobody at hand to relieve him of the situation, he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave nothing for it but to consult my interests, and say \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 X. Y. Z.\r\nis not at all a bad fellow, I can tell you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see him when we go\r\nto Thorpe Ambrose; and I rather think you and he will get on uncommonly\r\nwell together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe humorous twinkle in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s eye, the sly significance in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice, would have betrayed his secret to a prosperous man. Midwinter was\r\nas far from suspecting it as the carpenters who were at work above them\r\non the deck of the yacht.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no steward now on the estate?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, his face showing\r\nplainly that he was far from feeling satisfied with Allan\xe2\x80\x99s answer. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthe business neglected all this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the sort!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cThe business is going with \xe2\x80\x98a\r\nwet sheet and a flowing sea, and a wind that follows free.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\njoking; I\xe2\x80\x99m only metaphorical. A regular accountant has poked his nose\r\ninto the books, and a steady-going lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk attends at the office\r\nonce a week. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like neglect, does it? Leave the new\r\nsteward alone for the present, and just tell me which of those two\r\ntenants you would take, if you were in my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter opened the proposals, and read them attentively.\r\n\r\nThe first proposal was from no less a person than the solicitor at\r\nThorpe Ambrose, who had first informed Allan at Paris of the large\r\nfortune that had fallen into his hands. This gentleman wrote personally\r\nto say that he had long admired the cottage, which was charmingly\r\nsituated within the limits of the Thorpe Ambrose grounds. He was\r\na bachelor, of studious habits, desirous of retiring to a country\r\nseclusion after the wear and tear of his business hours; and he ventured\r\nto say that Mr. Armadale, in accepting him as a tenant, might count\r\non securing an unobtrusive neighbor, and on putting the cottage into\r\nresponsible and careful hands.\r\n\r\nThe second proposal came through the house agent, and proceeded from a\r\ntotal stranger. The tenant who offered for the cottage, in this case,\r\nwas a retired officer in the army--one Major Milroy. His family merely\r\nconsisted of an invalid wife and an only child--a young lady. His\r\nreferences were unexceptionable; and he, too, was especially anxious to\r\nsecure the cottage, as the perfect quiet of the situation was exactly\r\nwhat was required by Mrs. Milroy in her feeble state of health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, which profession shall I favor?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cThe army or the\r\nlaw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere seems to me to be no doubt about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lawyer\r\nhas been already in correspondence with you; and the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s claim is,\r\ntherefore, the claim to be preferred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would say that. In all the thousands of times I have asked\r\nother people for advice, I never yet got the advice I wanted. Here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthis business of letting the cottage as an instance. I\xe2\x80\x99m all on the\r\nother side myself. I want to have the major.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung Armadale laid his forefinger on that part of the agent\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nwhich enumerated Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s family, and which contained the three\r\nwords--\xe2\x80\x9ca young lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bachelor of studious habits walking about my grounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis not an interesting object; a young lady is. I have not the least\r\ndoubt Miss Milroy is a charming girl. Ozias Midwinter of the serious\r\ncountenance! think of her pretty muslin dress flitting about among your\r\ntrees and committing trespasses on your property; think of her adorable\r\nfeet trotting into your fruit-garden, and her delicious fresh lips\r\nkissing your ripe peaches; think of her dimpled hands among your early\r\nviolets, and her little cream-colored nose buried in your blush-roses.\r\nWhat does the studious bachelor offer me in exchange for the loss of all\r\nthis? He offers me a rheumatic brown object in gaiters and a wig. No!\r\nno! Justice is good, my dear friend; but, believe me, Miss Milroy is\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you be serious about any mortal thing, Allan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try to be, if you like. I know I ought to take the lawyer; but\r\nwhat can I do if the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter keeps running in my head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter returned resolutely to the just and sensible view of the\r\nmatter, and pressed it on his friend\xe2\x80\x99s attention with all the persuasion\r\nof which he was master. After listening with exemplary patience until\r\nhe had done, Allan swept a supplementary accumulation of litter off the\r\ncabin table, and produced from his waistcoat pocket a half-crown coin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got an entirely new idea,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s leave it to chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of the proposal--as coming from a landlord--was\r\nirresistible. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s gravity deserted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll spin,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cand you shall call. We must give\r\nprecedence to the army, of course; so we\xe2\x80\x99ll say Heads, the major; Tails,\r\nthe lawyer. One spin to decide. Now, then, look out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spun the half-crown on the cabin table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTails!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Midwinter, humoring what he believed to be one of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboyish jokes.\r\n\r\nThe coin fell on the table with the Head uppermost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you are really in earnest!\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, as\r\nthe other opened his writing-case and dipped his pen in the ink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but I am, though!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cChance is on my side, and Miss\r\nMilroy\xe2\x80\x99s; and you\xe2\x80\x99re outvoted, two to one. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use arguing. The\r\nmajor has fallen uppermost, and the major shall have the cottage. I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t leave it to the lawyers; they\xe2\x80\x99ll only be worrying me with more\r\nletters. I\xe2\x80\x99ll write myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wrote his answers to the two proposals, literally in two minutes. One\r\nto the house agent: \xe2\x80\x9cDear sir, I accept Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s offer; let him\r\ncome in when he pleases. Yours truly, Allan Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d And one to the\r\nlawyer: \xe2\x80\x9cDear sir, I regret that circumstances prevent me from\r\naccepting your proposal. Yours truly,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople make a fuss about\r\nletter-writing,\xe2\x80\x9d Allan remarked, when he had done. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ find it easy\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wrote the addresses on his two notes, and stamped them for the post,\r\nwhistling gayly. While he had been writing, he had not noticed how\r\nhis friend was occupied. When he had done, it struck him that a sudden\r\nsilence had fallen on the cabin; and, looking up, he observed that\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s whole attention was strangely concentrated on the half crown\r\nas it lay head uppermost on the table. Allan suspended his whistling in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only wondering,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Midwinter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was wondering,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, handing him back the half-crown,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhether there is such a thing as chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the two notes were posted; and Allan, whose close\r\nsuperintendence of the repairs of the yacht had hitherto allowed him but\r\nlittle leisure time on shore, had proposed to while away the idle hours\r\nby taking a walk in Castletown. Even Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s nervous anxiety to\r\ndeserve Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in him could detect nothing objectionable\r\nin this harmless proposal, and the young men set forth together to see\r\nwhat they could make of the metropolis of the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if there is a place on the habitable globe which,\r\nregarded as a sight-seeing investment offering itself to the spare\r\nattention of strangers, yields so small a percentage of interest in\r\nreturn as Castletown. Beginning with the waterside, there was an inner\r\nharbor to see, with a drawbridge to let vessels through; an outer\r\nharbor, ending in a dwarf lighthouse; a view of a flat coast to the\r\nright, and a view of a flat coast to the left. In the central solitudes\r\nof the city, there was a squat gray building called \xe2\x80\x9cthe castle\xe2\x80\x9d; also\r\na memorial pillar dedicated to one Governor Smelt, with a flat top for\r\na statue, and no statue standing on it; also a barrack, holding the\r\nhalf-company of soldiers allotted to the island, and exhibiting one\r\nspirit-broken sentry at its lonely door. The prevalent color of the town\r\nwas faint gray. The few shops open were parted at frequent intervals\r\nby other shops closed and deserted in despair. The weary lounging of\r\nboatmen on shore was trebly weary here; the youth of the district smoked\r\ntogether in speechless depression under the lee of a dead wall; the\r\nragged children said mechanically: \xe2\x80\x9cGive us a penny,\xe2\x80\x9d and before the\r\ncharitable hand could search the merciful pocket, lapsed away again in\r\nmisanthropic doubt of the human nature they addressed. The silence of\r\nthe grave overflowed the churchyard, and filled this miserable town. But\r\none edifice, prosperous to look at, rose consolatory in the desolation\r\nof these dreadful streets. Frequented by the students of the neighboring\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCollege of King William,\xe2\x80\x9d this building was naturally dedicated to\r\nthe uses of a pastry-cook\xe2\x80\x99s shop. Here, at least (viewed through the\r\nfriendly medium of the window), there was something going on for a\r\nstranger to see; for here, on high stools, the pupils of the college\r\nsat, with swinging legs and slowly moving jaws, and, hushed in the\r\nhorrid stillness of Castletown, gorged their pastry gravely, in an\r\natmosphere of awful silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang me if I can look any longer at the boys and the tarts!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAllan, dragging his friend away from the pastry-cook\xe2\x80\x99s shop. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s try\r\nif we can\xe2\x80\x99t find something else to amuse us in the next street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first amusing object which the next street presented was a\r\ncarver-and-gilder\xe2\x80\x99s shop, expiring feebly in the last stage of\r\ncommercial decay. The counter inside displayed nothing to view but the\r\nrecumbent head of a boy, peacefully asleep in the unbroken solitude of\r\nthe place. In the window were exhibited to the passing stranger three\r\nforlorn little fly-spotted frames; a small posting-bill, dusty with\r\nlong-continued neglect, announcing that the premises were to let; and\r\none colored print, the last of a series illustrating the horrors\r\nof drunkenness, on the fiercest temperance principles. The\r\ncomposition--representing an empty bottle of gin, an immensely spacious\r\ngarret, a perpendicular Scripture reader, and a horizontal expiring\r\nfamily--appealed to public favor, under the entirely unobjectionable\r\ntitle of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hand of Death.\xe2\x80\x9d Allan\xe2\x80\x99s resolution to extract amusement\r\nfrom Castletown by main force had resisted a great deal, but it\r\nfailed him at this stage of the investigations. He suggested trying an\r\nexcursion to some other place. Midwinter readily agreeing, they went\r\nback to the hotel to make inquiries.\r\n\r\nThanks to the mixed influence of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s ready gift of familiarity,\r\nand total want of method in putting his questions, a perfect deluge of\r\ninformation flowed in on the two strangers, relating to every subject\r\nbut the subject which had actually brought them to the hotel. They\r\nmade various interesting discoveries in connection with the laws and\r\nconstitution of the Isle of Man, and the manners and customs of the\r\nnatives. To Allan\xe2\x80\x99s delight, the Manxmen spoke of England as of a\r\nwell-known adjacent island, situated at a certain distance from the\r\ncentral empire of the Isle of Man. It was further revealed to the two\r\nEnglishmen that this happy little nation rejoiced in laws of its own,\r\npublicly proclaimed once a year by the governor and the two head judges,\r\ngrouped together on the top of an ancient mound, in fancy costumes\r\nappropriate to the occasion. Possessing this enviable institution,\r\nthe island added to it the inestimable blessing of a local parliament,\r\ncalled the House of Keys, an assembly far in advance of the other\r\nparliament belonging to the neighboring island, in this respect--that\r\nthe members dispensed with the people, and solemnly elected each other.\r\nWith these and many more local particulars, extracted from all sorts and\r\nconditions of men in and about the hotel, Allan whiled away the weary\r\ntime in his own essentially desultory manner, until the gossip died out\r\nof itself, and Midwinter (who had been speaking apart with the landlord)\r\nquietly recalled him to the matter in hand. The finest coast scenery in\r\nthe island was said to be to the westward and the southward, and there\r\nwas a fishing town in those regions called Port St. Mary, with a hotel\r\nat which travelers could sleep. If Allan\xe2\x80\x99s impressions of Castletown\r\nstill inclined him to try an excursion to some other place, he had only\r\nto say so, and a carriage would be produced immediately. Allan jumped at\r\nthe proposal, and in ten minutes more he and Midwinter were on their way\r\nto the western wilds of the island.\r\n\r\nWith trifling incidents, the day of Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s departure had worn on\r\nthus far. With trifling incidents, in which not even Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s nervous\r\nwatchfulness could see anything to distrust, it was still to proceed,\r\nuntil the night came--a night which one at least of the two companions\r\nwas destined to remember to the end of his life.\r\n\r\nBefore the travelers had advanced two miles on their road, an accident\r\nhappened. The horse fell, and the driver reported that the animal had\r\nseriously injured himself. There was no alternative but to send for\r\nanother carriage to Castletown, or to get on to Port St. Mary on foot.\r\n\r\nDeciding to walk, Midwinter and Allan had not gone far before they were\r\novertaken by a gentleman driving alone in an open chaise. He civilly\r\nintroduced himself as a medical man, living close to Port St. Mary, and\r\noffered seats in his carriage. Always ready to make new acquaintances,\r\nAllan at once accepted the proposal. He and the doctor (whose name was\r\nascertained to be Hawbury) became friendly and familiar before they\r\nhad been five minutes in the chaise together; Midwinter, sitting behind\r\nthem, reserved and silent, on the back seat. They separated just outside\r\nPort St. Mary, before Mr. Hawbury\xe2\x80\x99s house, Allan boisterously admiring\r\nthe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s neat French windows and pretty flower-garden and lawn,\r\nand wringing his hand at parting as if they had known each other\r\nfrom boyhood upward. Arrived in Port St. Mary, the two friends found\r\nthemselves in a second Castletown on a smaller scale. But the country\r\nround, wild, open, and hilly, deserved its reputation. A walk brought\r\nthem well enough on with the day--still the harmless, idle day that it\r\nhad been from the first--to see the evening near at hand. After waiting\r\na little to admire the sun, setting grandly over hill, and heath, and\r\ncrag, and talking, while they waited, of Mr. Brock and his long journey\r\nhome, they returned to the hotel to order their early supper. Nearer and\r\nnearer the night, and the adventure which the night was to bring with\r\nit, came to the two friends; and still the only incidents that happened\r\nwere incidents to be laughed at, if they were noticed at all. The\r\nsupper was badly cooked; the waiting-maid was impenetrably stupid; the\r\nold-fashioned bell-rope in the coffee-room had come down in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands, and, striking in its descent a painted china shepherdess on the\r\nchimney-piece, had laid the figure in fragments on the floor. Events as\r\ntrifling as these were still the only events that had happened, when the\r\ntwilight faded, and the lighted candles were brought into the room.\r\n\r\nFinding Midwinter, after the double fatigue of a sleepless night and\r\na restless day, but little inclined for conversation, Allan left him\r\nresting on the sofa, and lounged into the passage of the hotel, on the\r\nchance of discovering somebody to talk to. Here another of the trivial\r\nincidents of the day brought Allan and Mr. Hawbury together again, and\r\nhelped--whether happily or not, yet remained to be seen--to strengthen\r\nthe acquaintance between them on either side.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cbar\xe2\x80\x9d of the hotel was situated at one end of the passage, and\r\nthe landlady was in attendance there, mixing a glass of liquor for the\r\ndoctor, who had just looked in for a little gossip. On Allan\xe2\x80\x99s asking\r\npermission to make a third in the drinking and the gossiping, Mr.\r\nHawbury civilly handed him the glass which the landlady had just filled.\r\nIt contained cold brandy-and-water. A marked change in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s face, as\r\nhe suddenly drew back and asked for whisky instead, caught the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmedical eye. \xe2\x80\x9cA case of nervous antipathy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hawbury, quietly\r\ntaking the glass away again. The remark obliged Allan to acknowledge\r\nthat he had an insurmountable loathing (which he was foolish enough to\r\nbe a little ashamed of mentioning) to the smell and taste of brandy. No\r\nmatter with what diluting liquid the spirit was mixed, the presence of\r\nit, instantly detected by his organs of taste and smell, turned him sick\r\nand faint if the drink touched his lips. Starting from this personal\r\nconfession, the talk turned on antipathies in general; and the doctor\r\nacknowledged, on his side, that he took a professional interest in the\r\nsubject, and that he possessed a collection of curious cases at home,\r\nwhich his new acquaintance was welcome to look at, if Allan had nothing\r\nelse to do that evening, and if he would call, when the medical work of\r\nthe day was over, in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time.\r\n\r\nCordially accepting the invitation (which was extended to Midwinter\r\nalso, if he cared to profit by it), Allan returned to the coffee-room to\r\nlook after his friend. Half asleep and half awake, Midwinter was still\r\nstretched on the sofa, with the local newspaper just dropping out of his\r\nlanguid hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard your voice in the passage,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, drowsily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom were you\r\ntalking to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to smoke a cigar with him, in\r\nan hour\xe2\x80\x99s time. Will you come too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter assented with a weary sigh. Always shyly unwilling to make new\r\nacquaintances, fatigue increased the reluctance he now felt to become\r\nMr. Hawbury\xe2\x80\x99s guest. As matters stood, however, there was no alternative\r\nbut to go; for, with Allan\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional imprudence, there was no\r\nsafely trusting him alone anywhere, and more especially in a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. Mr. Brock would certainly not have left his pupil to visit\r\nthe doctor alone; and Midwinter was still nervously conscious that he\r\noccupied Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do till it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan, looking about\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything in this?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, observing the fallen newspaper, and\r\npicking it up from the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m too tired to look. If you find anything interesting, read it out,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Midwinter, thinking that the reading might help to keep him awake.\r\n\r\nPart of the newspaper, and no small part of it, was devoted to extracts\r\nfrom books recently published in London. One of the works most largely\r\nlaid under contribution in this manner was of the sort to interest\r\nAllan: it was a highly spiced narrative of Traveling Adventures in\r\nthe wilds of Australia. Pouncing on an extract which described the\r\nsufferings of the traveling-party, lost in a trackless wilderness,\r\nand in danger of dying by thirst, Allan announced that he had found\r\nsomething to make his friend\xe2\x80\x99s flesh creep, and began eagerly to read\r\nthe passage aloud.\r\n\r\nResolute not to sleep, Midwinter followed the progress of the adventure,\r\nsentence by sentence, without missing a word. The consultation of the\r\nlost travelers, with death by thirst staring them in the face; the\r\nresolution to press on while their strength lasted; the fall of a heavy\r\nshower, the vain efforts made to catch the rainwater, the transient\r\nrelief experienced by sucking their wet clothes; the sufferings renewed\r\na few hours after; the night advance of the strongest of the party,\r\nleaving the weakest behind; the following a flight of birds when morning\r\ndawned; the discovery by the lost men of the broad pool of water that\r\nsaved their lives--all this Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s fast-failing attention mastered\r\npainfully, Allan\xe2\x80\x99s voice growing fainter and fainter on his ear with\r\nevery sentence that was read. Soon the next words seemed to drop away\r\ngently, and nothing but the slowly sinking sound of the voice was left.\r\nThen the light in the room darkened gradually, the sound dwindled\r\ninto delicious silence, and the last waking impressions of the weary\r\nMidwinter came peacefully to an end.\r\n\r\nThe next event of which he was conscious was a sharp ringing at the\r\nclosed door of the hotel. He started to his feet, with the ready\r\nalacrity of a man whose life has accustomed him to wake at the shortest\r\nnotice. An instant\xe2\x80\x99s look round showed him that the room was empty, and\r\na glance at his watch told him that it was close on midnight. The noise\r\nmade by the sleepy servant in opening the door, and the tread the next\r\nmoment of quick footsteps in the passage, filled him with a sudden\r\nforeboding of something wrong. As he hurriedly stepped forward to go\r\nout and make inquiry, the door of the coffee-room opened, and the doctor\r\nstood before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to disturb you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hawbury. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Midwinter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the pier head,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cI am, to a certain extent,\r\nresponsible for what he is doing now; and I think some careful person,\r\nlike yourself, ought to be with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hint was enough for Midwinter. He and the doctor set out for the\r\npier immediately, Mr. Hawbury mentioning on the way the circumstances\r\nunder which he had come to the hotel.\r\n\r\nPunctual to the appointed hour Allan had made his appearance at the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s house, explaining that he had left his weary friend so fast\r\nasleep on the sofa that he had not had the heart to wake him. The\r\nevening had passed pleasantly, and the conversation had turned on many\r\nsubjects, until, in an evil hour, Mr. Hawbury had dropped a hint\r\nwhich showed that he was fond of sailing, and that he possessed a\r\npleasure-boat of his own in the harbor. Excited on the instant by his\r\nfavorite topic, Allan had left his host no hospitable alternative but to\r\ntake him to the pier head and show him the boat. The beauty of the night\r\nand the softness of the breeze had done the rest of the mischief; they\r\nhad filled Allan with irresistible longings for a sail by moonlight.\r\nPrevented from accompanying his guest by professional hindrances which\r\nobliged him to remain on shore, the doctor, not knowing what else to\r\ndo, had ventured on disturbing Midwinter, rather than take the\r\nresponsibility of allowing Mr. Armadale (no matter how well he might be\r\naccustomed to the sea) to set off on a sailing trip at midnight entirely\r\nby himself.\r\n\r\nThe time taken to make this explanation brought Midwinter and the doctor\r\nto the pier head. There, sure enough, was young Armadale in the boat,\r\nhoisting the sail, and singing the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cYo-heave-ho!\xe2\x80\x9d at the top of\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, old boy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re just in time for a frolic by\r\nmoonlight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter suggested a frolic by daylight, and an adjournment to bed in\r\nthe meantime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, on whose harum-scarum high spirits Mr. Hawbury\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhospitality had certainly not produced a sedative effect. \xe2\x80\x9cHear him,\r\ndoctor! one would think he was ninety! Bed, you drowsy old dormouse!\r\nLook at that, and think of bed if you can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the sea. The moon was shining in the cloudless heaven;\r\nthe night-breeze blew soft and steady from the land; the peaceful waters\r\nrippled joyfully in the silence and the glory of the night. Midwinter\r\nturned to the doctor with a wise resignation to circumstances: he had\r\nseen enough to satisfy him that all words of remonstrance would be words\r\nsimply thrown away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is the tide?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawbury told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there oars in the boat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am well used to the sea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, descending the pier steps.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may trust me to take care of my friend, and to take care of the\r\nboat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, doctor!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cYour whisky-and-water is\r\ndelicious--your boat\xe2\x80\x99s a little beauty--and you\xe2\x80\x99re the best fellow I\r\never met in my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor laughed and waved his hand, and the boat glided out from the\r\nharbor, with Midwinter at the helm.\r\n\r\nAs the breeze then blew, they were soon abreast of the westward\r\nheadland, bounding the Bay of Poolvash, and the question was started\r\nwhether they should run out to sea or keep along the shore. The wisest\r\nproceeding, in the event of the wind failing them, was to keep by the\r\nland. Midwinter altered the course of the boat, and they sailed on\r\nsmoothly in a south-westerly direction, abreast of the coast.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the cliffs rose in height, and the rocks, massed wild\r\nand jagged, showed rifted black chasms yawning deep in their seaward\r\nsides. Off the bold promontory called Spanish Head, Midwinter looked\r\nominously at his watch. But Allan pleaded hard for half an hour more,\r\nand for a glance at the famous channel of the Sound, which they were now\r\nfast nearing, and of which he had heard some startling stories from\r\nthe workmen employed on his yacht. The new change which Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompliance with this request rendered it necessary to make in the course\r\nof the boat brought her close to the wind; and revealed, on one side,\r\nthe grand view of the southernmost shores of the Isle of Man, and, on\r\nthe other, the black precipices of the islet called the Calf, separated\r\nfrom the mainland by the dark and dangerous channel of the Sound.\r\n\r\nOnce more Midwinter looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have gone far enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cStand by the sheet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, from the bows of the boat. \xe2\x80\x9cGood God! here\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwrecked ship right ahead of us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter let the boat fall off a little, and looked where the other\r\npointed.\r\n\r\nThere, stranded midway between the rocky boundaries on either side of\r\nthe Sound--there, never again to rise on the living waters from her\r\ngrave on the sunken rock; lost and lonely in the quiet night; high, and\r\ndark, and ghostly in the yellow moonshine, lay the Wrecked Ship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the vessel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, in great excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard my\r\nworkmen talking of her yesterday. She drifted in here, on a pitch-dark\r\nnight, when they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the lights; a poor old worn-out\r\nmerchantman, Midwinter, that the ship-brokers have bought to break up.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s run in and have a look at her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter hesitated. All the old sympathies of his sea-life strongly\r\ninclined him to follow Allan\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion; but the wind was falling\r\nlight, and he distrusted the broken water and the swirling currents of\r\nthe channel ahead. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an ugly place to take a boat into when you\r\nknow nothing about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as light as day, and we float in two\r\nfeet of water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Midwinter could answer, the current caught the boat, and swept\r\nthem onward through the channel straight toward the wreck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLower the sail,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cand ship the oars. We are\r\nrunning down on her fast enough now, whether we like it or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth well accustomed to the use of the oar, they brought the course of\r\nthe boat under sufficient control to keep her on the smoothest side of\r\nthe channel--the side which was nearest to the Islet of the Calf. As\r\nthey came swiftly up with the wreck, Midwinter resigned his oar to\r\nAllan; and, watching his opportunity, caught a hold with the boat-hook\r\non the fore-chains of the vessel. The next moment they had the boat\r\nsafely in hand, under the lee of the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe ship\xe2\x80\x99s ladder used by the workmen hung over the fore-chains.\r\nMounting it, with the boat\xe2\x80\x99s rope in his teeth, Midwinter secured one\r\nend, and lowered the other to Allan in the boat. \xe2\x80\x9cMake that fast,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cand wait till I see if it\xe2\x80\x99s all safe on board.\xe2\x80\x9d With those words,\r\nhe disappeared behind the bulwark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Allan, in the blankest astonishment at his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexcessive caution. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth does he mean? I\xe2\x80\x99ll be hanged if I\r\nwait. Where one of us goes, the other goes too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hitched the loose end of the rope round the forward thwart of the\r\nboat, and, swinging himself up the ladder, stood the next moment on the\r\ndeck. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything very dreadful on board?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired sarcastically, as\r\nhe and his friend met.\r\n\r\nMidwinter smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nsure that we were to have the whole ship to ourselves till I got over\r\nthe bulwark and looked about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan took a turn on the deck, and surveyed the wreck critically from\r\nstem to stern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much of a vessel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Frenchmen generally build better\r\nships than this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter crossed the deck, and eyed Allan in a momentary silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrenchmen?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, after an interval. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this vessel French?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe men I have got at work on the yacht told me. They know all about\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter came a little nearer. His swarthy face began to look, to\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, unaccountably pale in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they mention what trade she was engaged in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; the timber trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Allan gave that answer, Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s lean brown hand clutched him fast\r\nby the shoulder, and Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s teeth chattered in his head like the\r\nteeth of a man struck by a sudden chill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they tell you her name?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in a voice that dropped suddenly\r\nto a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey did, I think. But it has slipped my memory.--Gently, old fellow;\r\nthese long claws of yours are rather tight on my shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the name--?\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, removed his hand, and dashed away the\r\ngreat drops that were gathering on his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cWas the name _La Grace\r\nde Dieu_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow the deuce did you come to know it? That\xe2\x80\x99s the name, sure enough.\r\n_La Grace de Dieu_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt one bound, Midwinter leaped on the bulwark of the wreck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boat!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, with a scream of horror that rang far and wide\r\nthrough the stillness of the night, and brought Allan instantly to his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe lower end of the carelessly hitched rope was loose on the water, and\r\nahead, in the track of the moonlight, a small black object was floating\r\nout of view. The boat was adrift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE SHADOW OF THE PAST.\r\n\r\nOne stepping back under the dark shelter of the bulwark, and one\r\nstanding out boldly in the yellow light of the moon, the two friends\r\nturned face to face on the deck of the timber-ship, and looked at each\r\nother in silence. The next moment Allan\xe2\x80\x99s inveterate recklessness seized\r\non the grotesque side of the situation by main force. He seated himself\r\nastride on the bulwark, and burst out boisterously into his loudest and\r\nheartiest laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll my fault,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s no help for it now. Here we are,\r\nhard and fast in a trap of our own setting; and there goes the last of\r\nthe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s boat! Come out of the dark, Midwinter; I can\xe2\x80\x99t half see you\r\nthere, and I want to know what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter neither answered nor moved. Allan left the bulwark, and,\r\nmounting the forecastle, looked down attentively at the waters of the\r\nSound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing is pretty certain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWith the current on that side,\r\nand the sunken rocks on this, we can\xe2\x80\x99t find our way out of the scrape\r\nby swimming, at any rate. So much for the prospect at this end of the\r\nwreck. Let\xe2\x80\x99s try how things look at the other. Rouse up, messmate!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncalled out, cheerfully, as he passed Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and see what the\r\nold tub of a timber-ship has got to show us astern.\xe2\x80\x9d He sauntered on,\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, humming the chorus of a comic song.\r\n\r\nHis voice had produced no apparent effect on his friend; but, at the\r\nlight touch of his hand in passing, Midwinter started, and moved out\r\nslowly from the shadow of the bulwark. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan,\r\nsuspending his singing for a moment, and glancing back. Still, without a\r\nword of answer, the other followed. Thrice he stopped before he reached\r\nthe stern end of the wreck: the first time, to throw aside his hat,\r\nand push back his hair from his forehead and temples; the second time,\r\nreeling, giddy, to hold for a moment by a ring-bolt close at hand; the\r\nlast time (though Allan was plainly visible a few yards ahead), to look\r\nstealthily behind him, with the furtive scrutiny of a man who believes\r\nthat other footsteps are following him in the dark. \xe2\x80\x9cNot yet!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered to himself, with eyes that searched the empty air. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nsee him astern, with his hand on the lock of the cabin door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stern end of the wreck was clear of the ship-breakers\xe2\x80\x99 lumber,\r\naccumulated in the other parts of the vessel. Here, the one object\r\nthat rose visible on the smooth surface of the deck was the low wooden\r\nstructure which held the cabin door and roofed in the cabin stairs. The\r\nwheel-house had been removed, the binnacle had been removed, but\r\nthe cabin entrance, and all that had belonged to it, had been left\r\nuntouched. The scuttle was on, and the door was closed.\r\n\r\nOn gaining the after-part of the vessel, Allan walked straight to the\r\nstern, and looked out to sea over the taffrail. No such thing as a\r\nboat was in view anywhere on the quiet, moon-brightened waters. Knowing\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s sight to be better than his own, he called out, \xe2\x80\x9cCome up\r\nhere, and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s a fisherman within hail of us.\xe2\x80\x9d Hearing no\r\nreply, he looked back. Midwinter had followed him as far as the cabin,\r\nand had stopped there. He called again in a louder voice, and beckoned\r\nimpatiently. Midwinter had heard the call, for he looked up, but still\r\nhe never stirred from his place. There he stood, as if he had reached\r\nthe utmost limits of the ship and could go no further.\r\n\r\nAllan went back and joined him. It was not easy to discover what he was\r\nlooking at, for he kept his face turned away from the moonlight; but it\r\nseemed as if his eyes were fixed, with a strange expression of inquiry,\r\non the cabin door. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there to look at there?\xe2\x80\x9d Allan asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s see if it\xe2\x80\x99s locked.\xe2\x80\x9d As he took a step forward to open the door,\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s hand seized him suddenly by the coat collar and forced him\r\nback. The moment after, the hand relaxed without losing its grasp, and\r\ntrembled violently, like the hand of a man completely unnerved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to consider myself in custody?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan, half astonished and\r\nhalf amused. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy in the name of wonder do you keep staring at the cabin\r\ndoor? Any suspicious noises below? It\xe2\x80\x99s no use disturbing the rats--if\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean--we haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a dog with us. Men? Living men they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be; for they would have heard us and come on deck. Dead men? Quite\r\nimpossible! No ship\xe2\x80\x99s crew could be drowned in a land-locked place like\r\nthis, unless the vessel broke up under them--and here\xe2\x80\x99s the vessel\r\nas steady as a church to speak for herself. Man alive, how your hand\r\ntrembles! What is there to scare you in that rotten old cabin? What are\r\nyou shaking and shivering about? Any company of the supernatural sort on\r\nboard? Mercy preserve us! (as the old women say) do you see a ghost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I see two_!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other, driven headlong into speech and\r\naction by a maddening temptation to reveal the truth. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated, his breath bursting from him in deep, heavy gasps, as he tried\r\nvainly to force back the horrible words. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ghost of a man like you,\r\ndrowning in the cabin! And the ghost of a man like me, turning the lock\r\nof the door on him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more young Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s hearty laughter rang out loud and long\r\nthrough the stillness of the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurning the lock of the door, is he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, as soon as his\r\nmerriment left him breath enough to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a devilish unhandsome\r\naction, Master Midwinter, on the part of your ghost. The least I can do,\r\nafter that, is to let mine out of the cabin, and give him the run of the\r\nship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith no more than a momentary exertion of his superior strength, he\r\nfreed himself easily from Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s hold. \xe2\x80\x9cBelow there!\xe2\x80\x9d he called\r\nout, gayly, as he laid his strong hand on the crazy lock, and tore open\r\nthe cabin door. \xe2\x80\x9cGhost of Allan Armadale, come on deck!\xe2\x80\x9d In his terrible\r\nignorance of the truth, he put his head into the doorway and looked\r\ndown, laughing, at the place where his murdered father had died. \xe2\x80\x9cPah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he exclaimed, stepping back suddenly, with a shudder of disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nair is foul already; and the cabin is full of water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was true. The sunken rocks on which the vessel lay wrecked had burst\r\ntheir way through her lower timbers astern, and the water had welled up\r\nthrough the rifted wood. Here, where the deed had been done, the fatal\r\nparallel between past and present was complete. What the cabin had been\r\nin the time of the fathers, that the cabin was now in the time of the\r\nsons.\r\n\r\nAllan pushed the door to again with his foot, a little surprised at\r\nthe sudden silence which appeared to have fallen on his friend from the\r\nmoment when he had laid his hand on the cabin lock. When he turned to\r\nlook, the reason of the silence was instantly revealed. Midwinter had\r\ndropped on the deck. He lay senseless before the cabin door; his face\r\nturned up, white and still, to the moonlight, like the face of a dead\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Allan was at his side. He looked uselessly round the lonely\r\nlimits of the wreck, as he lifted Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s head on his knee, for a\r\nchance of help, where all chance was ruthlessly cut off. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, in the first impulse of alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a drop\r\nof water near, but the foul water in the cabin.\xe2\x80\x9d A sudden recollection\r\ncrossed his memory, the florid color rushed back over his face, and he\r\ndrew from his pocket a wicker-covered flask. \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless the doctor for\r\ngiving me this before we sailed!\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out, fervently, as he poured\r\ndown Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s throat some drops of the raw whisky which the flask\r\ncontained. The stimulant acted instantly on the sensitive system of the\r\nswooning man. He sighed faintly, and slowly opened his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I\r\nbeen dreaming?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, looking up vacantly in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s face. His\r\neyes wandered higher, and encountered the dismantled masts of the wreck\r\nrising weird and black against the night sky. He shuddered at the sight\r\nof them, and hid his face on Allan\xe2\x80\x99s knee. \xe2\x80\x9cNo dream!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured to\r\nhimself, mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cOh me, no dream!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been overtired all day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cand this infernal\r\nadventure of ours has upset you. Take some more whisky, it\xe2\x80\x99s sure to\r\ndo you good. Can you sit by yourself, if I put you against the bulwark,\r\nso?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy by myself? Why do you leave me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Midwinter.\r\n\r\nAllan pointed to the mizzen shrouds of the wreck, which were still left\r\nstanding. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not well enough to rough it here till the workmen\r\ncome off in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must find our way on shore at\r\nonce, if we can. I am going up to get a good view all round, and see if\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a house within hail of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven in the moment that passed while those few words were spoken,\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s eyes wandered back distrustfully to the fatal cabin door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go near it!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to open it, for God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan, humoring him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I come down from the\r\nrigging, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back here.\xe2\x80\x9d He said the words a little constrainedly,\r\nnoticing, for the first time while he now spoke, an underlying distress\r\nin Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s face, which grieved and perplexed him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not angry\r\nwith me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in his simple, sweet-tempered way. \xe2\x80\x9cAll this is my\r\nfault, I know; and I was a brute and a fool to laugh at you, when I\r\nought to have seen you were ill. I am so sorry, Midwinter. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nangry with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter slowly raised his head. His eyes rested with a mournful\r\ninterest, long and tender, on Allan\xe2\x80\x99s anxious face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAngry?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, in his lowest, gentlest tones. \xe2\x80\x9cAngry with\r\n_you_?--Oh, my poor boy, were you to blame for being kind to me when I\r\nwas ill in the old west-country inn? And was I to blame for feeling your\r\nkindness thankfully? Was it our fault that we never doubted each other,\r\nand never knew that we were traveling together blindfold on the way that\r\nwas to lead us here? The cruel time is coming, Allan, when we shall\r\nrue the day we ever met. Shake hands, brother, on the edge of the\r\nprecipice--shake hands while we are brothers still!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan turned away quickly, convinced that his mind had not yet recovered\r\nthe shock of the fainting fit. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget the whisky!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\ncheerfully, as he sprang into the rigging, and mounted to the\r\nmizzen-top.\r\n\r\nIt was past two, the moon was waning, and the darkness that comes before\r\ndawn was beginning to gather round the wreck. Behind Allan, as he now\r\nstood looking out from the elevation of the mizzen-top, spread the broad\r\nand lonely sea. Before him were the low, black, lurking rocks, and the\r\nbroken waters of the channel, pouring white and angry into the vast calm\r\nof the westward ocean beyond. On the right hand, heaved back grandly\r\nfrom the water-side, were the rocks and precipices, with their little\r\ntable-lands of grass between; the sloping downs, and upward-rolling\r\nheath solitudes of the Isle of Man. On the left hand rose the craggy\r\nsides of the Islet of the Calf, here rent wildly into deep black chasms,\r\nthere lying low under long sweeping acclivities of grass and heath. No\r\nsound rose, no light was visible, on either shore. The black lines of\r\nthe topmost masts of the wreck looked shadowy and faint in the darkening\r\nmystery of the sky; the land breeze had dropped; the small shoreward\r\nwaves fell noiseless: far or near, no sound was audible but the\r\ncheerless bubbling of the broken water ahead, pouring through the awful\r\nhush of silence in which earth and ocean waited for the coming day.\r\n\r\nEven Allan\xe2\x80\x99s careless nature felt the solemn influence of the time. The\r\nsound of his own voice startled him when he looked down and hailed his\r\nfriend on deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I see one house,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHere-away, on the mainland to the\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked again, to make sure, at a dim little patch of white,\r\nwith faint white lines behind it, nestling low in a grassy hollow,\r\non the main island. \xe2\x80\x9cIt looks like a stone house and inclosure,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nresumed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll hail it, on the chance.\xe2\x80\x9d He passed his arm round a rope\r\nto steady himself, made a speaking-trumpet of his hands, and suddenly\r\ndropped them again without uttering a sound. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so awfully quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he whispered to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m half afraid to call out.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked down\r\nagain on deck. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t startle you, Midwinter, shall I?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with\r\nan uneasy laugh. He looked once more at the faint white object, in\r\nthe grassy hollow. \xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t do to have come up here for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought, and made a speaking-trumpet of his hands again. This time he\r\ngave the hail with the whole power of his lungs. \xe2\x80\x9cOn shore there!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nshouted, turning his face to the main island. \xe2\x80\x9cAhoy-hoy-hoy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last echoes of his voice died away and were lost. No sound answered\r\nhim but the cheerless bubbling of the broken water ahead.\r\n\r\nHe looked down again at his friend, and saw the dark figure of Midwinter\r\nrise erect, and pace the deck backward and forward, never disappearing\r\nout of sight of the cabin when it retired toward the bows of the wreck,\r\nand never passing beyond the cabin when it returned toward the stern.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is impatient to get away,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Allan; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try again.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nhailed the land once more, and, taught by previous experience, pitched\r\nhis voice in its highest key.\r\n\r\nThis time another sound than the sound of the bubbling water answered\r\nhim. The lowing of frightened cattle rose from the building in the\r\ngrassy hollow, and traveled far and drearily through the stillness\r\nof the morning air. Allan waited and listened. If the building was a\r\nfarmhouse the disturbance among the beasts would rouse the men. If it\r\nwas only a cattle-stable, nothing more would happen. The lowing of\r\nthe frightened brutes rose and fell drearily, the minutes passed, and\r\nnothing happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more!\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, looking down at the restless figure pacing\r\nbeneath him. For the third time he hailed the land. For the third time\r\nhe waited and listened.\r\n\r\nIn a pause of silence among the cattle, he heard behind him, on the\r\nopposite shore of the channel, faint and far among the solitudes of the\r\nIslet of the Calf, a sharp, sudden sound, like the distant clash of a\r\nheavy door-bolt drawn back. Turning at once in the new direction, he\r\nstrained his eyes to look for a house. The last faint rays of the\r\nwaning moonlight trembled here and there on the higher rocks, and on the\r\nsteeper pinnacles of ground, but great strips of darkness lay dense\r\nand black over all the land between; and in that darkness the house, if\r\nhouse there were, was lost to view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have roused somebody at last,\xe2\x80\x9d Allan called out, encouragingly, to\r\nMidwinter, still walking to and fro on the deck, strangely indifferent\r\nto all that was passing above and beyond him. \xe2\x80\x9cLook out for the\r\nanswering, hail!\xe2\x80\x9d And with his face set toward the islet, Allan shouted\r\nfor help.\r\n\r\nThe shout was not answered, but mimicked with a shrill, shrieking\r\nderision, with wilder and wilder cries, rising out of the deep distant\r\ndarkness, and mingling horribly the expression of a human voice with the\r\nsound of a brute\xe2\x80\x99s. A sudden suspicion crossed Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mind, which\r\nmade his head swim and turned his hand cold as it held the rigging. In\r\nbreathless silence he looked toward the quarter from which the first\r\nmimicry of his cry for help had come. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause the shrieks\r\nwere renewed, and the sound of them came nearer. Suddenly a figure,\r\nwhich seemed the figure of a man, leaped up black on a pinnacle of\r\nrock, and capered and shrieked in the waning gleam of the moonlight.\r\nThe screams of a terrified woman mingled with the cries of the capering\r\ncreature on the rock. A red spark flashed out in the darkness from a\r\nlight kindled in an invisible window. The hoarse shouting of a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice in anger was heard through the noise. A second black figure leaped\r\nup on the rock, struggled with the first figure, and disappeared with it\r\nin the darkness. The cries grew fainter and fainter, the screams of the\r\nwoman were stilled, the hoarse voice of the man was heard again for a\r\nmoment, hailing the wreck in words made unintelligible by the distance,\r\nbut in tones plainly expressive of rage and fear combined. Another\r\nmoment, and the clang of the door-bolt was heard again, the red spark\r\nof light was quenched in darkness, and all the islet lay quiet in the\r\nshadows once more. The lowing of the cattle on the main-land ceased,\r\nrose again, stopped. Then, cold and cheerless as ever, the eternal\r\nbubbling of the broken water welled up through the great gap of\r\nsilence--the one sound left, as the mysterious stillness of the hour\r\nfell like a mantle from the heavens, and closed over the wreck.\r\n\r\nAllan descended from his place in the mizzen-top, and joined his friend\r\nagain on deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must wait till the ship-breakers come off to their work,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nmeeting Midwinter halfway in the course of his restless walk. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter\r\nwhat has happened, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind confessing that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of\r\nhailing the land. Only think of there being a madman in that house\r\nashore, and of my waking him! Horrible, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter stood still for a moment, and looked at Allan, with the\r\nperplexed air of a man who hears circumstances familiarly mentioned to\r\nwhich he is himself a total stranger. He appeared, if such a thing had\r\nbeen possible, to have passed over entirely without notice all that had\r\njust happened on the Islet of the Calf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is horrible _out_ of this ship,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything is\r\nhorrible _in_ it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnswering in those strange words, he turned away again, and went on with\r\nhis walk.\r\n\r\nAllan picked up the flask of whisky lying on the deck near him, and\r\nrevived his spirits with a dram. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing on board that isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhorrible,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted briskly, as he screwed on the stopper of the\r\nflask; \xe2\x80\x9cand here\xe2\x80\x99s another,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as he took a cigar from his\r\ncase and lit it. \xe2\x80\x9cThree o\xe2\x80\x99clock!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, looking at his watch, and\r\nsettling himself comfortably on deck with his back against the bulwark.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaybreak isn\xe2\x80\x99t far off; we shall have the piping of the birds to cheer\r\nus up before long. I say, Midwinter, you seem to have quite got over\r\nthat unlucky fainting fit. How you do keep walking! Come here and have\r\na cigar, and make yourself comfortable. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of tramping\r\nbackward and forward in that restless way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaiting! What for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what is to happen to you or to me--or to both of us--before we are\r\nout of this ship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith submission to your superior judgment, my dear fellow, I think\r\nquite enough has happened already. The adventure will do very well as\r\nit stands now; more of it is more than I want.\xe2\x80\x9d He took another dram\r\nof whisky, and rambled on, between the puffs of his cigar, in his usual\r\neasy way. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not got your fine imagination, old boy; and I hope the\r\nnext thing that happens will be the appearance of the workmen\xe2\x80\x99s boat. I\r\nsuspect that queer fancy of yours has been running away with you while\r\nyou were down here all by yourself. Come, now, what were you thinking of\r\nwhile I was up in the mizzen-top frightening the cows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter suddenly stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe torturing temptation to reveal the truth, roused once already by his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s merciless gayety of spirit, possessed itself of Midwinter\r\nfor the second time. He leaned back in the dark against the high side\r\nof the ship, and looked down in silence at Allan\xe2\x80\x99s figure, stretched\r\ncomfortably on the deck. \xe2\x80\x9cRouse him,\xe2\x80\x9d the fiend whispered, subtly, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom\r\nthat ignorant self-possession and that pitiless repose. Show him the\r\nplace where the deed was done; let him know it with your knowledge, and\r\nfear it with your dread. Tell him of the letter you burned, and of the\r\nwords no fire can destroy which are living in your memory now. Let him\r\nsee your mind as it was yesterday, when it roused your sinking faith in\r\nyour own convictions, to look back on your life at sea, and to cherish\r\nthe comforting remembrance that, in all your voyages, you had never\r\nfallen in with this ship. Let him see your mind as it is now, when the\r\nship has got you at the turning-point of your new life, at the outset of\r\nyour friendship with the one man of all men whom your father warned you\r\nto avoid. Think of those death-bed words, and whisper them in his ear,\r\nthat he may think of them, too: \xe2\x80\x98Hide yourself from him under an assumed\r\nname. Put the mountains and the seas between you; be ungrateful, be\r\nunforgiving; be all that is most repellent to your own gentler nature,\r\nrather than live under the same roof and breathe the same air with that\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d So the tempter counseled. So, like a noisome exhalation from the\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s grave, the father\xe2\x80\x99s influence rose and poisoned the mind of the\r\nson.\r\n\r\nThe sudden silence surprised Allan; he looked back drowsily over his\r\nshoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cThinking again!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with a weary yawn.\r\n\r\nMidwinter stepped out from the shadow, and came nearer to Allan than he\r\nhad come yet. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthinking of the past and the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe past and the future?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Allan, shifting himself comfortably\r\ninto a new position. \xe2\x80\x9cFor my part, I\xe2\x80\x99m dumb about the past. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sore\r\nsubject with me: the past means the loss of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s boat. Let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntalk about the future. Have you been taking a practical view? as dear\r\nold Brock calls it. Have you been considering the next serious question\r\nthat concerns us both when we get back to the hotel--the question of\r\nbreakfast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, Midwinter took a step nearer. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nbeen thinking of your future and mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking\r\nof the time when your way in life and my way in life will be two ways\r\ninstead of one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the daybreak!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cLook up at the masts; they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nbeginning to get clear again already. I beg your pardon. What were you\r\nsaying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter made no reply. The struggle between the hereditary\r\nsuperstition that was driving him on, and the unconquerable affection\r\nfor Allan that was holding him back, suspended the next words on his\r\nlips. He turned aside his face in speechless suffering. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cbetter have killed me on that day when I lay on your bosom,\r\nthan have let me live for this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that about the future?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI was looking for the\r\ndaylight; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter controlled himself, and answered: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have treated me with\r\nyour usual kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cin planning to take me with you to\r\nThorpe Ambrose. I think, on reflection, I had better not intrude myself\r\nwhere I am not known and not expected.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice faltered, and he\r\nstopped again. The more he shrank from it, the clearer the picture of\r\nthe happy life that he was resigning rose on his mind.\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts instantly reverted to the mystification about the new\r\nsteward which he had practiced on his friend when they were consulting\r\ntogether in the cabin of the yacht. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he been turning it over in\r\nhis mind?\xe2\x80\x9d wondered Allan; \xe2\x80\x9cand is he beginning at last to suspect the\r\ntruth? I\xe2\x80\x99ll try him.--Talk as much nonsense, my dear fellow, as you\r\nlike,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that you are engaged to see me\r\nestablished at Thorpe Ambrose, and to give me your opinion of the new\r\nsteward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter suddenly stepped forward again, close to Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not talking about your steward or your estate,\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out\r\npassionately; \xe2\x80\x9cI am talking about myself. Do you hear? Myself! I am not\r\na fit companion for you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know who I am.\xe2\x80\x9d He drew back into the\r\nshadowy shelter of the bulwark as suddenly as he had come out from it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God! I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, in a whisper.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, and for a moment only, Allan was surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cNot know\r\nwho you are?\xe2\x80\x9d Even as he repeated the words, his easy goodhumor got\r\nthe upper-hand again. He took up the whisky flask, and shook it\r\nsignificantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9chow much of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s medicine\r\ndid you take while I was up in the mizzen-top?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe light tone which he persisted in adopting stung Midwinter to the\r\nlast pitch of exasperation. He came out again into the light, and\r\nstamped his foot angrily on the deck. \xe2\x80\x9cListen to me!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know half the low things I have done in my lifetime. I have been a\r\ntradesman\xe2\x80\x99s drudge; I have swept out the shop and put up the shutters;\r\nI have carried parcels through the street, and waited for my master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoney at his customers\xe2\x80\x99 doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never done anything half as useful,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan, composedly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear old boy, what an industrious fellow you have been in your time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a vagabond and a blackguard in my time,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other,\r\nfiercely; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a street tumbler, a tramp, a gypsy\xe2\x80\x99s boy! I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nsung for half-pence with dancing dogs on the high-road! I\xe2\x80\x99ve worn a\r\nfoot-boy\xe2\x80\x99s livery, and waited at table! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a common sailors\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncook, and a starving fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Jack-of-all-trades! What has a\r\ngentleman in your position in common with a man in mine? Can you take\r\n_me_ into the society at Thorpe Ambrose? Why, my very name would be\r\na reproach to you. Fancy the faces of your new neighbors when their\r\nfootmen announce Ozias Midwinter and Allan Armadale in the same breath!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He burst into a harsh laugh, and repeated the two names again, with a\r\nscornful bitterness of emphasis which insisted pitilessly on the marked\r\ncontrast between them.\r\n\r\nSomething in the sound of his laughter jarred painfully even on Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neasy nature. He raised himself on the deck and spoke seriously for the\r\nfirst time. \xe2\x80\x9cA joke\xe2\x80\x99s a joke, Midwinter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cas long as you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncarry it too far. I remember your saying something of the same sort to\r\nme once before when I was nursing you in Somersetshire. You forced me\r\nto ask you if I deserved to be kept at arms-length by _you_ of all the\r\npeople in the world. Don\xe2\x80\x99t force me to say so again. Make as much fun of\r\nme as you please, old fellow, in any other way. _That_ way hurts me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimple as the words were, and simply as they had been spoken, they\r\nappeared to work an instant revolution in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s mind. His\r\nimpressible nature recoiled as from some sudden shock. Without a word of\r\nreply, he walked away by himself to the forward part of the ship. He sat\r\ndown on some piled planks between the masts, and passed his hand over\r\nhis head in a vacant, bewildered way. Though his father\xe2\x80\x99s belief in\r\nfatality was his own belief once more--though there was no longer the\r\nshadow of a doubt in his mind that the woman whom Mr. Brock had met in\r\nSomersetshire, and the woman who had tried to destroy herself in London,\r\nwere one and the same--though all the horror that mastered him when he\r\nfirst read the letter from Wildbad had now mastered him again, Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappeal to their past experience of each other had come home to his\r\nheart, with a force more irresistible than the force of his superstition\r\nitself. In the strength of that very superstition, he now sought the\r\npretext which might encourage him to sacrifice every less generous\r\nfeeling to the one predominant dread of wounding the sympathies of his\r\nfriend. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy distress him?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not the end\r\nhere: there is the Woman behind us in the dark. Why resist him when the\r\nmischief\xe2\x80\x99s done, and the caution comes too late? What _is_ to be _will_\r\nbe. What have I to do with the future? and what has he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went back to Allan, sat down by his side, and took his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cForgive\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gently; \xe2\x80\x9cI have hurt you for the last time.\xe2\x80\x9d Before it\r\nwas possible to reply, he snatched up the whisky flask from the deck.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with a sudden effort to match his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheerfulness, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been trying the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s medicine, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan was delighted. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is something like a change for the better,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said; \xe2\x80\x9cMidwinter is himself again. Hark! there are the birds. Hail,\r\nsmiling morn! smiling morn!\xe2\x80\x9d He sang the words of the glee in his old,\r\ncheerful voice, and clapped Midwinter on the shoulder in his old, hearty\r\nway. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you manage to clear your head of those confounded megrims?\r\nDo you know you were quite alarming about something happening to one or\r\nother of us before we were out of this ship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSheer nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Midwinter, contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think my\r\nhead has ever been quite right since that fever; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bee in my\r\nbonnet, as they say in the North. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk of something else. About\r\nthose people you have let the cottage to? I wonder whether the agent\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount of Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s family is to be depended on? There might be\r\nanother lady in the household besides his wife and his daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, \xe2\x80\x9c_you\xe2\x80\x99re_ beginning to think of nymphs among the\r\ntrees, and flirtations in the fruit-garden, are you? Another lady, eh?\r\nSuppose the major\xe2\x80\x99s family circle won\xe2\x80\x99t supply another? We shall have to\r\nspin that half-crown again, and toss up for which is to have the first\r\nchance with Miss Milroy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor once Midwinter spoke as lightly and carelessly as Allan himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe major\xe2\x80\x99s landlord has the first claim to the\r\nnotice of the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. I\xe2\x80\x99ll retire into the background, and\r\nwait for the next lady who makes her appearance at Thorpe Ambrose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have an address to the women of Norfolk posted in the\r\npark to that effect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you particular to a shade about\r\nsize or complexion? What\xe2\x80\x99s your favorite age?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter trifled with his own superstition, as a man trifles with the\r\nloaded gun that may kill him, or with the savage animal that may maim\r\nhim for life. He mentioned the age (as he had reckoned it himself) of\r\nthe woman in the black gown and the red Paisley shawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive-and-thirty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAs the words passed his lips, his factitious spirits deserted him. He\r\nleft his seat, impenetrably deaf to all Allan\xe2\x80\x99s efforts at rallying him\r\non his extraordinary answer, and resumed his restless pacing of the deck\r\nin dead silence. Once more the haunting thought which had gone to and\r\nfro with him in the hour of darkness went to and fro with him now in the\r\nhour of daylight.\r\n\r\nOnce more the conviction possessed itself of his mind that something was\r\nto happen to Allan or to himself before they left the wreck.\r\n\r\nMinute by minute the light strengthened in the eastern sky; and the\r\nshadowy places on the deck of the timber-ship revealed their barren\r\nemptiness under the eye of day. As the breeze rose again, the sea began\r\nto murmur wakefully in the morning light. Even the cold bubbling of the\r\nbroken water changed its cheerless note, and softened on the ear as the\r\nmellowing flood of daylight poured warm over it from the rising sun.\r\nMidwinter paused near the forward part of the ship, and recalled his\r\nwandering attention to the passing time. The cheering influences of the\r\nhour were round him, look where he might. The happy morning smile of the\r\nsummer sky, so brightly merciful to the old and weary earth, lavished\r\nits all-embracing beauty even on the wreck. The dew that lay glittering\r\non the inland fields lay glittering on the deck, and the worn and rusted\r\nrigging was gemmed as brightly as the fresh green leaves on shore.\r\nInsensibly, as he looked round, Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts reverted to the\r\ncomrade who had shared with him the adventure of the night. He returned\r\nto the after-part of the ship, spoke to Allan as he advanced. Receiving\r\nno answer, he approached the recumbent figure and looked closer at it.\r\nLeft to his own resources, Allan had let the fatigues of the night take\r\ntheir own way with him. His head had sunk back; his hat had fallen off;\r\nhe lay stretched at full length on the deck of the timber-ship, deeply\r\nand peacefully asleep.\r\n\r\nMidwinter resumed his walk; his mind lost in doubt; his own past\r\nthoughts seeming suddenly to have grown strange to him. How darkly his\r\nforebodings had distrusted the coming time, and how harmlessly that time\r\nhad come! The sun was mounting in the heavens, the hour of release was\r\ndrawing nearer and nearer, and of the two Armadales imprisoned in the\r\nfatal ship, one was sleeping away the weary time, and the other was\r\nquietly watching the growth of the new day.\r\n\r\nThe sun climbed higher; the hour wore on. With the latent distrust of\r\nthe wreck which still clung to him, Midwinter looked inquiringly on\r\neither shore for signs of awakening human life. The land was still\r\nlonely. The smoke wreaths that were soon to rise from cottage chimneys\r\nhad not risen yet.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought he went back again to the after-part of the\r\nvessel, to see if there might be a fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s boat within hail astern\r\nof them. Absorbed for the moment by the new idea, he passed Allan\r\nhastily, after barely noticing that he still lay asleep. One step more\r\nwould have brought him to the taffrail, when that step was suspended by\r\na sound behind him, a sound like a faint groan. He turned, and looked at\r\nthe sleeper on the deck. He knelt softly, and looked closer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has come!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cNot to _me_--but to _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had come, in the bright freshness of the morning; it had come, in the\r\nmystery and terror of a Dream. The face which Midwinter had last seen\r\nin perfect repose was now the distorted face of a suffering man. The\r\nperspiration stood thick on Allan\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, and matted his curling\r\nhair. His partially opened eyes showed nothing but the white of the\r\neyeball gleaming blindly. His outstretched hands scratched and struggled\r\non the deck. From moment to moment he moaned and muttered helplessly;\r\nbut the words that escaped him were lost in the grinding and gnashing of\r\nhis teeth. There he lay--so near in the body to the friend who bent\r\nover him; so far away in the spirit, that the two might have been in\r\ndifferent worlds--there he lay, with the morning sunshine on his face,\r\nin the torture of his dream.\r\n\r\nOne question, and one only, rose in the mind of the man who was looking\r\nat him. What had the fatality which had imprisoned him in the wreck\r\ndecreed that he should see?\r\n\r\nHad the treachery of Sleep opened the gates of the grave to that one of\r\nthe two Armadales whom the other had kept in ignorance of the truth? Was\r\nthe murder of the father revealing itself to the son--there, on the very\r\nspot where the crime had been committed--in the vision of a dream?\r\n\r\nWith that question overshadowing all else in his mind, the son of the\r\nhomicide knelt on the deck, and looked at the son of the man whom his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s hand had slain.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between the sleeping body and the waking mind was\r\nstrengthening every moment. The dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s helpless groaning for\r\ndeliverance grew louder; his hands raised themselves, and clutched at\r\nthe empty air. Struggling with the all-mastering dread that still held\r\nhim, Midwinter laid his hand gently on Allan\xe2\x80\x99s forehead. Light as the\r\ntouch was, there were mysterious sympathies in the dreaming man that\r\nanswered it. His groaning ceased, and his hands dropped slowly. There\r\nwas an instant of suspense and Midwinter looked closer. His breath just\r\nfluttered over the sleeper\xe2\x80\x99s face. Before the next breath had risen to\r\nhis lips, Allan suddenly sprang up on his knees--sprang up, as if the\r\ncall of a trumpet had rung on his ear, awake in an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been dreaming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, as the other looked at him\r\nwildly, in the first bewilderment of waking.\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes began to wander about the wreck, at first vacantly,\r\nthen with a look of angry surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cAre we here still?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as\r\nMidwinter helped him to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever else I do on board this\r\ninfernal ship,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t go to sleep again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he said those words, his friend\xe2\x80\x99s eyes searched his face in silent\r\ninquiry. They took a turn together on the deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me your dream,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, with a strange tone of suspicion\r\nin his voice, and a strange appearance of abruptness in his manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell it yet,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a little till I\xe2\x80\x99m my own\r\nman again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey took another turn on the deck. Midwinter stopped, and spoke once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me for a moment, Allan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThere was something of the trouble left by the dream, and something\r\nof natural surprise at the strange request just addressed to him, in\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s face, as he turned it full on the speaker; but no shadow of\r\nill-will, no lurking lines of distrust anywhere. Midwinter turned aside\r\nquickly, and hid, as he best might, an irrepressible outburst of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I look a little upset?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan, taking his arm, and leading him\r\non again. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make yourself nervous about me if I do. My head feels\r\nwild and giddy, but I shall soon get over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the next few minutes they walked backward and forward in silence,\r\nthe one bent on dismissing the terror of the dream from his thoughts,\r\nthe other bent on discovering what the terror of the dream might be.\r\nRelieved of the dread that had oppressed it, the superstitious nature\r\nof Midwinter had leaped to its next conclusion at a bound. What if the\r\nsleeper had been visited by another revelation than the revelation of\r\nthe Past? What if the dream had opened those unturned pages in the book\r\nof the Future which told the story of his life to come? The bare\r\ndoubt that it might be so strengthened tenfold Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s longing to\r\npenetrate the mystery which Allan\xe2\x80\x99s silence still kept a secret from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your head more composed?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me your dream\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he put the question, a last memorable moment in the Adventure of\r\nthe Wreck was at hand.\r\n\r\nThey had reached the stern, and were just turning again when Midwinter\r\nspoke. As Allan opened his lips to answer, he looked out mechanically to\r\nsea. Instead of replying, he suddenly ran to the taffrail, and waved his\r\nhat over his head, with a shout of exultation.\r\n\r\nMidwinter joined him, and saw a large six-oared boat pulling straight\r\nfor the channel of the Sound. A figure, which they both thought they\r\nrecognized, rose eagerly in the stern-sheets and returned the waving\r\nof Allan\xe2\x80\x99s hat. The boat came nearer, the steersman called to them\r\ncheerfully, and they recognized the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God you\xe2\x80\x99re both above water!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hawbury, as they met him\r\non the deck of the timber-ship. \xe2\x80\x9cOf all the winds of heaven, which wind\r\nblew you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at Midwinter as he made the inquiry, but it was Allan who\r\ntold him the story of the night, and Allan who asked the doctor for\r\ninformation in return. The one absorbing interest in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind--the interest of penetrating the mystery of the dream--kept him\r\nsilent throughout. Heedless of all that was said or done about him, he\r\nwatched Allan, and followed Allan, like a dog, until the time came for\r\ngetting down into the boat. Mr. Hawbury\xe2\x80\x99s professional eye rested on him\r\ncuriously, noting his varying color, and the incessant restlessness\r\nof his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change nervous systems with that man for the\r\nlargest fortune that could be offered me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the doctor as he took\r\nthe boat\xe2\x80\x99s tiller, and gave the oarsmen their order to push off from the\r\nwreck.\r\n\r\nHaving reserved all explanations on his side until they were on their\r\nway back to Port St. Mary, Mr. Hawbury next addressed himself to the\r\ngratification of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity. The circumstances which had brought\r\nhim to the rescue of his two guests of the previous evening were simple\r\nenough. The lost boat had been met with at sea by some fishermen of Port\r\nErin, on the western side of the island, who at once recognized it as\r\nthe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s property, and at once sent a messenger to make inquiry,\r\nat the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s house. The man\xe2\x80\x99s statement of what had happened had\r\nnaturally alarmed Mr. Hawbury for the safety of Allan and his friend. He\r\nhad immediately secured assistance, and, guided by the boatman\xe2\x80\x99s advice,\r\nhad made first for the most dangerous place on the coast--the only\r\nplace, in that calm weather, in which an accident could have happened to\r\na boat sailed by experienced men--the channel of the Sound. After\r\nthus accounting for his welcome appearance on the scene, the doctor\r\nhospitably insisted that his guests of the evening should be his guests\r\nof the morning as well. It would still be too early when they got back\r\nfor the people at the hotel to receive them, and they would find bed and\r\nbreakfast at Mr. Hawbury\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nAt the first pause in the conversation between Allan and the doctor,\r\nMidwinter, who had neither joined in the talk nor listened to the talk,\r\ntouched his friend on the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you better?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in a whisper.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you soon be composed enough to tell me what I want to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows contracted impatiently; the subject of the dream, and\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s obstinacy in returning to it, seemed to be alike distasteful\r\nto him. He hardly answered with his usual good humor. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I shall\r\nhave no peace till I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cso I may as well get it over\r\nat once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Midwinter, with a look at the doctor and his oarsmen.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot where other people can hear it--not till you and I are alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to see the last, gentlemen, of your quarters for the\r\nnight,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cnow is your time! The coast will shut\r\nthe vessel out in a minute more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn silence on the one side and on the other, the two Armadales looked\r\ntheir last at the fatal ship. Lonely and lost they had found the wreck\r\nin the mystery of the summer night; lonely and lost they left the wreck\r\nin the radiant beauty of the summer morning.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the doctor had seen his guests established in their\r\nbedrooms, and had left them to take their rest until the breakfast hour\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as his back was turned, the doors of both rooms opened\r\nsoftly, and Allan and Midwinter met in the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you sleep after what has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan.\r\n\r\nMidwinter shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were coming to my room, were you not?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo ask you to keep me company. What were you coming to _my_ room for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo ask you to tell me your dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn the dream! I want to forget all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _I_ want to know all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth paused; both refrained instinctively from saying more. For the\r\nfirst time since the beginning of their friendship they were on the\r\nverge of a disagreement, and that on the subject of the dream. Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood temper just stopped them on the brink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the most obstinate fellow alive,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you will\r\nknow all about it, you must know all about it, I suppose. Come into my\r\nroom, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led the way, and Midwinter followed. The door closed and shut them in\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE SHADOW OF THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hawbury joined his guests in the breakfast-room, the strange\r\ncontrast of character between them which he had noticed already was\r\nimpressed on his mind more strongly than ever. One of them sat at the\r\nwell-spread table, hungry and happy, ranging from dish to dish, and\r\ndeclaring that he had never made such a breakfast in his life. The other\r\nsat apart at the window; his cup thanklessly deserted before it was\r\nempty, his meat left ungraciously half-eaten on his plate. The\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s morning greeting to the two accurately expressed the differing\r\nimpressions which they had produced on his mind.\r\n\r\nHe clapped Allan on the shoulder, and saluted him with a joke. He\r\nbowed constrainedly to Midwinter, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you have not\r\nrecovered the fatigues of the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the night, doctor, that has damped his spirits,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something I have been telling him. It is not my fault, mind. If\r\nI had only known beforehand that he believed in dreams, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nopened my lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreams?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the doctor, looking at Midwinter directly, and\r\naddressing him under a mistaken impression of the meaning of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords. \xe2\x80\x9cWith your constitution, you ought to be well used to dreaming by\r\nthis time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis way, doctor; you have taken the wrong turning!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the dreamer, not he. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look astonished; it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in this\r\ncomfortable house; it was on board that confounded timber-ship. The fact\r\nis, I fell asleep just before you took us off the wreck; and it\xe2\x80\x99s not to\r\nbe denied that I had a very ugly dream. Well, when we got back here--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you trouble Mr. Hawbury about a matter that cannot possibly\r\ninterest him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Midwinter, speaking for the first time, and\r\nspeaking very impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the doctor, rather sharply; \xe2\x80\x9cso far as I\r\nhave heard, the matter does interest me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, doctor!\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cBe interested, I beg and pray; I\r\nwant you to clear his head of the nonsense he has got in it now. What\r\ndo you think? He will have it that my dream is a warning to me to avoid\r\ncertain people; and he actually persists in saying that one of those\r\npeople is--himself! Did you ever hear the like of it? I took great\r\npains; I explained the whole thing to him. I said, warning be hanged;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all indigestion! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I ate and drank at the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s supper-table; I do. Do you think he would listen to me? Not he.\r\nYou try him next; you\xe2\x80\x99re a professional man, and he must listen to you.\r\nBe a good fellow, doctor, and give me a certificate of indigestion; I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nshow you my tongue with pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sight of your face is quite enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hawbury. \xe2\x80\x9cI certify,\r\non the spot, that you never had such a thing as an indigestion in your\r\nlife. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear about the dream, and see what we can make of it, if you\r\nhave no objection, that is to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan pointed at Midwinter with his fork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApply to my friend, there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9che has got a much better account\r\nof it than I can give you. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll believe me, he took it all down in\r\nwriting from my own lips; and he made me sign it at the end, as if it\r\nwas my \xe2\x80\x98last dying speech and confession\xe2\x80\x99 before I went to the gallows.\r\nOut with it, old boy--I saw you put it in your pocket-book--out with\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really in earnest?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Midwinter, producing his pocketbook\r\nwith a reluctance which was almost offensive under the circumstances,\r\nfor it implied distrust of the doctor in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s own house.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawbury\xe2\x80\x99s color rose. \xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t show it to me, if you feel the\r\nleast unwillingness,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with the elaborate politeness of an\r\noffended man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff and nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cThrow it over here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of complying with that characteristic request, Midwinter took\r\nthe paper from the pocket-book, and, leaving his place, approached Mr.\r\nHawbury. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he offered the doctor the\r\nmanuscript with his own hand. His eyes dropped to the ground, and his\r\nface darkened, while he made the apology. \xe2\x80\x9cA secret, sullen fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n thought the doctor, thanking him with formal civility; \xe2\x80\x9chis friend is\r\nworth ten thousand of him.\xe2\x80\x9d Midwinter went back to the window, and sat\r\ndown again in silence, with the old impenetrable resignation which had\r\nonce puzzled Mr. Brock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead that, doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, as Mr. Hawbury opened the written\r\npaper. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not told in my roundabout way; but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing added\r\nto it, and nothing taken away. It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I dreamed, and exactly\r\nwhat I should have written myself, if I had thought the thing worth\r\nputting down on paper, and if I had had the knack of writing--which,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n concluded Allan, composedly stirring his coffee, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t, except it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletters; and I rattle _them_ off in no time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Hawbury spread the manuscript before him on the breakfast-table, and\r\nread these lines:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cALLAN ARMADALE\xe2\x80\x99S DREAM.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEarly on the morning of June the first, eighteen hundred and fifty-one,\r\nI found myself (through circumstances which it is not important to\r\nmention in this place) left alone with a friend of mine--a young man\r\nabout my own age--on board the French timber-ship named _La Grace de\r\nDieu_, which ship then lay wrecked in the channel of the Sound between\r\nthe main-land of the Isle of Man and the islet called the Calf. Having\r\nnot been in bed the previous night, and feeling overcome by fatigue, I\r\nfell asleep on the deck of the vessel. I was in my usual good health at\r\nthe time, and the morning was far enough advanced for the sun to have\r\nrisen. Under these circumstances, and at that period of the day, I\r\npassed from sleeping to dreaming. As clearly as I can recollect it,\r\nafter the lapse of a few hours, this was the succession of events\r\npresented to me by the dream:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c1. The first event of which I was conscious was the appearance of my\r\nfather. He took me silently by the hand; and we found ourselves in the\r\ncabin of a ship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c2. Water rose slowly over us in the cabin; and I and my father sank\r\nthrough the water together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c3. An interval of oblivion followed; and then the sense came to me of\r\nbeing left alone in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c4. I waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c5. The darkness opened, and showed me the vision--as in a picture--of a\r\nbroad, lonely pool, surrounded by open ground. Above the farther margin\r\nof the pool I saw the cloudless western sky, red with the light of\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c6. On the near margin of the pool there stood the Shadow of a Woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c7. It was the shadow only. No indication was visible to me by which I\r\ncould identify it, or compare it with any living creature. The long robe\r\nshowed me that it was the shadow of a woman, and showed me nothing more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c8. The darkness closed again--remained with me for an interval--and\r\nopened for the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c9. I found myself in a room, standing before a long window. The\r\nonly object of furniture or of ornament that I saw (or that I can now\r\nremember having seen) was a little statue placed near me. The window\r\nopened on a lawn and flower-garden; and the rain was pattering heavily\r\nagainst the glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c10. I was not alone in the room. Standing opposite to me at the window\r\nwas the Shadow of a Man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c11. I saw no more of it; I knew no more of it than I saw and knew of\r\nthe shadow of the woman. But the shadow of the man moved. It stretched\r\nout its arm toward the statue; and the statue fell in fragments on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c12. With a confused sensation in me, which was partly anger and partly\r\ndistress, I stooped to look at the fragments. When I rose again, the\r\nShadow had vanished, and I saw no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c13. The darkness opened for the third time, and showed me the Shadow of\r\nthe Woman and the Shadow of the Man together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c14. No surrounding scene (or none that I can now call to mind) was\r\nvisible to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c15. The Man-Shadow was the nearest; the Woman-Shadow stood back.\r\nFrom where she stood, there came a sound as of the pouring of a liquid\r\nsoftly. I saw her touch the shadow of the man with one hand, and with\r\nthe other give him a glass. He took the glass, and gave it to me. In\r\nthe moment when I put it to my lips, a deadly faintness mastered me from\r\nhead to foot. When I came to my senses again, the Shadows had vanished,\r\nand the third vision was at an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c16. The darkness closed over me again; and the interval of oblivion\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c17. I was conscious of nothing more, till I felt the morning sun shine\r\non my face, and heard my friend tell me that I had awakened from a\r\ndream....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter reading the narrative attentively to the last line (under\r\nwhich appeared Allan\xe2\x80\x99s signature), the doctor looked across the\r\nbreakfast-table at Midwinter, and tapped his fingers on the manuscript\r\nwith a satirical smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany men, many opinions,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with either of you\r\nabout this dream. Your theory,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking at Allan, with a\r\nsmile, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have disposed of already: the supper that _you_ can\xe2\x80\x99t digest\r\nis a supper which has yet to be discovered. My theory we will come to\r\npresently; your friend\xe2\x80\x99s theory claims attention first.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned again\r\nto Midwinter, with his anticipated triumph over a man whom he disliked\r\na little too plainly visible in his face and manner. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I understand\r\nrightly,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou believe that this dream is a warning!\r\nsupernaturally addressed to Mr. Armadale, of dangerous events that are\r\nthreatening him, and of dangerous people connected with those events\r\nwhom he would do wisely to avoid. May I inquire whether you have arrived\r\nat this conclusion as an habitual believer in dreams, or as having\r\nreasons of your own for attaching especial importance to this one dream\r\nin particular?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have stated what my conviction is quite accurately,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nMidwinter, chafing under the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s looks and tones. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me if\r\nI ask you to be satisfied with that admission, and to let me keep my\r\nreasons to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he said to me,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nhe has got any reasons at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently! gently!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hawbury. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can discuss the subject without\r\nintruding ourselves into anybody\xe2\x80\x99s secrets. Let us come to my own method\r\nof dealing with the dream next. Mr. Midwinter will probably not be\r\nsurprised to hear that I look at this matter from an essentially\r\npractical point of view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be at all surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe view of a\r\nmedical man, when he has a problem in humanity to solve, seldom ranges\r\nbeyond the point of his dissecting-knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor was a little nettled on his side. \xe2\x80\x9cOur limits are not quite\r\nso narrow as that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I willingly grant you that there\r\nare some articles of your faith in which we doctors don\xe2\x80\x99t believe.\r\nFor example, we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that a reasonable man is justified in\r\nattaching a supernatural interpretation to any phenomenon which comes\r\nwithin the range of his senses, until he has certainly ascertained that\r\nthere is no such thing as a natural explanation of it to be found in the\r\nfirst instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome; that\xe2\x80\x99s fair enough, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hit you hard\r\nwith the \xe2\x80\x98dissecting-knife,\xe2\x80\x99 doctor; and now you have hit him back again\r\nwith your \xe2\x80\x98natural explanation.\xe2\x80\x99 Let\xe2\x80\x99s have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hawbury. \xe2\x80\x9cHere it is. There is nothing at all\r\nextraordinary in my theory of dreams: it is the theory accepted by\r\nthe great mass of my profession. A dream is the reproduction, in the\r\nsleeping state of the brain, of images and impressions produced on it\r\nin the waking state; and this reproduction is more or less involved,\r\nimperfect, or contradictory, as the action of certain faculties in the\r\ndreamer is controlled more or less completely by the influence of sleep.\r\nWithout inquiring further into this latter part of the subject--a very\r\ncurious and interesting part of it--let us take the theory, roughly and\r\ngenerally, as I have just stated it, and apply it at once to the dream\r\nnow under consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d He took up the written paper from the table,\r\nand dropped the formal tone (as of a lecturer addressing an audience)\r\ninto which he had insensibly fallen. \xe2\x80\x9cI see one event already in this\r\ndream,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I know to be the reproduction of a waking\r\nimpression produced on Mr. Armadale in my own presence. If he will only\r\nhelp me by exerting his memory, I don\xe2\x80\x99t despair of tracing back the\r\nwhole succession of events set down here to something that he has said\r\nor thought, or seen or done, in the four-and-twenty hours, or less,\r\nwhich preceded his falling asleep on the deck of the timber-ship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll exert my memory with the greatest pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nshall we start from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStart by telling me what you did yesterday, before I met you and your\r\nfriend on the road to this place,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Hawbury. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will say,\r\nyou got up and had your breakfast. What next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe took a carriage next,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cand drove from Castletown\r\nto Douglas to see my old friend, Mr. Brock, off by the steamer to\r\nLiverpool. We came back to Castletown and separated at the hotel door.\r\nMidwinter went into the house, and I went on to my yacht in the harbor.\r\nBy-the-bye, doctor, remember you have promised to go cruising with us\r\nbefore we leave the Isle of Man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany thanks; but suppose we keep to the matter in hand. What next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan hesitated. In both senses of the word his mind was at sea already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do on board the yacht?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know! I put the cabin to rights--thoroughly to rights. I give\r\nyou my word of honor, I turned every blessed thing topsy-turvy. And my\r\nfriend there came off in a shore-boat and helped me. Talking of boats, I\r\nhave never asked you yet whether your boat came to any harm last night.\r\nIf there\xe2\x80\x99s any damage done, I insist on being allowed to repair it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor abandoned all further attempts at the cultivation of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmemory in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt if we shall be able to reach our object conveniently in this\r\nway,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be better to take the events of the dream in\r\ntheir regular order, and to ask the questions that naturally suggest\r\nthemselves as we go on. Here are the first two events to begin with. You\r\ndream that your father appears to you--that you and he find yourselves\r\nin the cabin of a ship--that the water rises over you, and that you sink\r\nin it together. Were you down in the cabin of the wreck, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be down there,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cas the cabin was full of\r\nwater. I looked in and saw it, and shut the door again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hawbury. \xe2\x80\x9cHere are the waking impressions clear\r\nenough, so far. You have had the cabin in your mind; and you have had\r\nthe water in your mind; and the sound of the channel current (as I well\r\nknow without asking) was the last sound in your ears when you went to\r\nsleep. The idea of drowning comes too naturally out of such impressions\r\nas these to need dwelling on. Is there anything else before we go on?\r\nYes; there is one more circumstance left to account for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe most important circumstance of all,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Midwinter, joining in\r\nthe conversation, without stirring from his place at the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean the appearance of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s father? I was just coming\r\nto that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Hawbury. \xe2\x80\x9cIs your father alive?\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\naddressing himself to Allan once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father died before I was born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor started. \xe2\x80\x9cThis complicates it a little,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did\r\nyou know that the figure appearing to you in the dream was the figure of\r\nyour father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan hesitated again. Midwinter drew his chair a little away from the\r\nwindow, and looked at the doctor attentively for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas your father in your thoughts before you went to sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued\r\nMr. Hawbury. \xe2\x80\x9cWas there any description of him--any portrait of him at\r\nhome--in your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course there was!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, suddenly seizing the lost\r\nrecollection. \xe2\x80\x9cMidwinter! you remember the miniature you found on the\r\nfloor of the cabin when we were putting the yacht to rights? You said I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to value it; and I told you I did, because it was a portrait\r\nof my father--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was the face in the dream like the face in the miniature?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMr. Hawbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly like! I say, doctor, this is beginning to get interesting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Hawbury, turning toward the window\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMidwinter hurriedly left his chair, and placed himself at the table with\r\nAllan. Just as he had once already taken refuge from the tyranny of his\r\nown superstition in the comfortable common sense of Mr. Brock, so, with\r\nthe same headlong eagerness, with the same straightforward sincerity\r\nof purpose, he now took refuge in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s theory of dreams. \xe2\x80\x9cI say\r\nwhat my friend says,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, flushing with a sudden enthusiasm;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis is beginning to get interesting. Go on; pray go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at his strange guest more indulgently than he had\r\nlooked yet. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the only mystic I have met with,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is\r\nwilling to give fair evidence fair play. I don\xe2\x80\x99t despair of converting\r\nyou before our inquiry comes to an end. Let us get on to the next set\r\nof events,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, after referring for a moment to the manuscript.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe interval of oblivion which is described as succeeding the first\r\nof the appearances in the dream may be easily disposed of. It means,\r\nin plain English, the momentary cessation of the brain\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual\r\naction, while a deeper wave of sleep flows over it, just as the sense\r\nof being alone in the darkness, which follows, indicates the renewal of\r\nthat action, previous to the reproduction of another set of impressions.\r\nLet us see what they are. A lonely pool, surrounded by an open country;\r\na sunset sky on the further side of the pool; and the shadow of a woman\r\non the near side. Very good; now for it, Mr. Armadale! How did that pool\r\nget into your head? The open country you saw on your way from Castletown\r\nto this place. But we have no pools or lakes hereabouts; and you can have\r\nseen none recently elsewhere, for you came here after a cruise at sea.\r\nMust we fall back on a picture, or a book, or a conversation with your\r\nfriend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan looked at Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember talking about pools or\r\nlakes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of answering the question, Midwinter suddenly appealed to the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got the last number of the Manx newspaper?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe doctor produced it from the sideboard. Midwinter turned to the\r\npage containing those extracts from the recently published \xe2\x80\x9cTravels in\r\nAustralia,\xe2\x80\x9d which had roused Allan\xe2\x80\x99s, interest on the previous evening,\r\nand the reading of which had ended by sending his friend to sleep.\r\nThere--in the passage describing the sufferings of the travelers from\r\nthirst, and the subsequent discovery which saved their lives--there,\r\nappearing at the climax of the narrative, was the broad pool of water\r\nwhich had figured in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s dream!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put away the paper,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, when Midwinter had shown it\r\nto him, with the necessary explanation. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore we are at the end of the\r\ninquiry, it is quite possible we may want that extract again. We have\r\ngot at the pool. How about the sunset? Nothing of that sort is referred\r\nto in the newspaper extract. Search your memory again, Mr. Armadale; we\r\nwant your waking impression of a sunset, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more, Allan was at a loss for an answer; and, once more,\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s ready memory helped him through the difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I can trace our way back to this impression, as I traced our\r\nway back to the other,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter we got\r\nhere yesterday afternoon, my friend and I took a long walk over the\r\nhills--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember. The sun was setting as we\r\ncame back to the hotel for supper, and it was such a splendid red sky,\r\nwe both stopped to look at it. And then we talked about Mr. Brock, and\r\nwondered how far he had got on his journey home. My memory may be a slow\r\none at starting, doctor; but when it\xe2\x80\x99s once set going, stop it if you\r\ncan! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t half done yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait one minute, in mercy to Mr. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s memory and mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ndoctor. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have traced back to your waking impressions the vision of\r\nthe open country, the pool, and the sunset. But the Shadow of the Woman\r\nhas not been accounted for yet. Can you find us the original of this\r\nmysterious figure in the dream landscape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan relapsed into his former perplexity, and Midwinter waited for what\r\nwas to come, with his eyes fixed in breathless interest on the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface. For the first time there was unbroken silence in the room. Mr.\r\nHawbury looked interrogatively from Allan to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s friend. Neither of\r\nthem answered him. Between the shadow and the shadow\xe2\x80\x99s substance there\r\nwas a great gulf of mystery, impenetrable alike to all three of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, composedly. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us leave the figure by the\r\npool for the present and try if we can\xe2\x80\x99t pick her up again as we go on.\r\nAllow me to observe, Mr. Midwinter, that it is not very easy to identify\r\na shadow; but we won\xe2\x80\x99t despair. This impalpable lady of the lake may\r\ntake some consistency when we next meet with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter made no reply. From that moment his interest in the inquiry\r\nbegan to flag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the next scene in the dream?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr. Hawbury, referring\r\nto the manuscript. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale finds himself in a room. He is standing\r\nbefore a long window opening on a lawn and flower-garden, and the rain\r\nis pattering against the glass. The only thing he sees in the room is\r\na little statue; and the only company he has is the Shadow of a Man\r\nstanding opposite to him. The Shadow stretches out its arm, and the\r\nstatue falls in fragments on the floor; and the dreamer, in anger and\r\ndistress at the catastrophe (observe, gentlemen, that here the sleeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreasoning faculty wakes up a little, and the dream passes rationally,\r\nfor a moment, from cause to effect), stoops to look at the broken\r\npieces. When he looks up again, the scene has vanished. That is to say,\r\nin the ebb and flow of sleep, it is the turn of the flow now, and the\r\nbrain rests a little. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Mr. Armadale? Has that restive\r\nmemory of yours run away with you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m off at full gallop. I\xe2\x80\x99ve run the broken statue\r\nto earth; it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more nor less than a china shepherdess I knocked\r\noff the mantel-piece in the hotel coffee-room, when I rang the bell\r\nfor supper last night. I say, how well we get on; don\xe2\x80\x99t we? It\xe2\x80\x99s like\r\nguessing a riddle. Now, then, Midwinter! your turn next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cMy turn, if you please. I claim the long window,\r\nthe garden, and the lawn, as my property. You will find the long window,\r\nMr. Armadale, in the next room. If you look out, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the garden\r\nand lawn in front of it; and, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll exert that wonderful memory of\r\nyours, you will recollect that you were good enough to take special and\r\ncomplimentary notice of my smart French window and my neat garden, when\r\nI drove you and your friend to Port St. Mary yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Allan; \xe2\x80\x9cso I did. But what about the rain that\r\nfell in the dream? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a drop of rain for the last week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Hawbury hesitated. The Manx newspaper which had been left on the\r\ntable caught his eye. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we can think of nothing else,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clet\r\nus try if we can\xe2\x80\x99t find the idea of the rain where we found the idea of\r\nthe pool.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked through the extract carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI have got it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is rain described as having fallen on these thirsty\r\nAustralian travelers, before they discovered the pool. Behold the\r\nshower, Mr. Armadale, which got into your mind when you read the extract\r\nto your friend last night! And behold the dream, Mr. Midwinter, mixing\r\nup separate waking impressions just as usual!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you find the waking impression which accounts for the human figure\r\nat the window?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Midwinter; \xe2\x80\x9cor are we to pass over the Shadow of\r\nthe Man as we have passed over the Shadow of the Woman already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put the question with scrupulous courtesy of manner, but with a tone\r\nof sarcasm in his voice which caught the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s ear, and set up the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s controversial bristles on the instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are picking up shells on the beach, Mr. Midwinter, you usually\r\nbegin with the shells that lie nearest at hand,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\npicking up facts now; and those that are easiest to get at are the facts\r\nwe will take first. Let the Shadow of the Man and the Shadow of the\r\nWoman pair off together for the present; we won\xe2\x80\x99t lose sight of them, I\r\npromise you. All in good time, my dear sir; all in good time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe, too, was polite, and he, too, was sarcastic. The short truce between\r\nthe opponents was at an end already. Midwinter returned significantly to\r\nhis former place by the window. The doctor instantly turned his back\r\non the window more significantly still. Allan, who never quarreled\r\nwith anybody\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, and never looked below the surface of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct, drummed cheerfully on the table with the handle of his knife.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, doctor!\xe2\x80\x9d he called out; \xe2\x80\x9cmy wonderful memory is as fresh as\r\never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hawbury, referring again to the narrative of the\r\ndream. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember what happened when you and I were gossiping with\r\nthe landlady at the bar of the hotel last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do! You were kind enough to hand me a glass of\r\nbrandy-and-water, which the landlady had just mixed for your own\r\ndrinking. And I was obliged to refuse it because, as I told you, the\r\ntaste of brandy always turns me sick and faint, mix it how you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here is the incident reproduced\r\nin the dream. You see the man\xe2\x80\x99s shadow and the woman\xe2\x80\x99s shadow together\r\nthis time. You hear the pouring out of liquid (brandy from the hotel\r\nbottle, and water from the hotel jug); the glass is handed by the\r\nwoman-shadow (the landlady) to the man-shadow (myself); the man-shadow\r\nhands it to you (exactly what I did); and the faintness (which you\r\nhad previously described to me) follows in due course. I am shocked\r\nto identify these mysterious appearances, Mr. Midwinter, with such\r\nmiserably unromantic originals as a woman who keeps a hotel, and a man\r\nwho physics a country district. But your friend himself will tell you\r\nthat the glass of brandy-and-water was prepared by the landlady, and\r\nthat it reached him by passing from her hand to mine. We have picked\r\nup the shadows, exactly as I anticipated; and we have only to account\r\nnow--which may be done in two words--for the manner of their appearance\r\nin the dream. After having tried to introduce the waking impression of\r\nthe doctor and the landlady separately, in connection with the wrong set\r\nof circumstances, the dreaming mind comes right at the third trial, and\r\nintroduces the doctor and the landlady together, in connection with the\r\nright set of circumstances. There it is in a nutshell!--Permit me to\r\nhand you back the manuscript, with my best thanks for your very complete\r\nand striking confirmation of the rational theory of dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d Saying\r\nthose words, Mr. Hawbury returned the written paper to Midwinter, with\r\nthe pitiless politeness of a conquering man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderful! not a point missed anywhere from beginning to end! By\r\nJupiter!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, with the ready reverence of intense ignorance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a thing science is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a point missed, as you say,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the doctor, complacently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I doubt if we have succeeded in convincing your friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have _not_ convinced me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t presume on\r\nthat account to say that you are wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke quietly, almost sadly. The terrible conviction of the\r\nsupernatural origin of the dream, from which he had tried to escape, had\r\npossessed itself of him again. All his interest in the argument was at\r\nan end; all his sensitiveness to its irritating influences was gone. In\r\nthe case of any other man, Mr. Hawbury would have been mollified by\r\nsuch a concession as his adversary had now made to him; but he disliked\r\nMidwinter too cordially to leave him in the peaceable enjoyment of an\r\nopinion of his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you admit,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the doctor, more pugnaciously than ever, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nhave traced back every event of the dream to a waking impression which\r\npreceded it in Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no wish to deny that you have done so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter,\r\nresignedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I identified the shadows with their living originals?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have identified them to your own satisfaction, and to my friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsatisfaction. Not to mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to yours? Can _you_ identify them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I can only wait till the living originals stand revealed in the\r\nfuture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpoken like an oracle, Mr. Midwinter! Have you any idea at present of\r\nwho those living originals may be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have. I believe that coming events will identify the Shadow of the\r\nWoman with a person whom my friend has not met with yet; and the Shadow\r\nof the Man with myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan attempted to speak. The doctor stopped him. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us clearly\r\nunderstand this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cLeaving your own case out\r\nof the question for the moment, may I ask how a shadow, which has no\r\ndistinguishing mark about it, is to be identified with a living woman\r\nwhom your friend doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s color rose a little. He began to feel the lash of the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s logic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe landscape picture of the dream has its distinguishing marks,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied; \xe2\x80\x9cand in that landscape the living woman will appear when the\r\nliving woman is first seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same thing will happen, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the\r\nman-shadow which you persist in identifying with yourself. You will be\r\nassociated in the future with a statue broken in your friend\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\r\nwith a long window looking out on a garden, and with a shower of rain\r\npattering against the glass? Do you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so again, I presume, with the next vision? You and the mysterious\r\nwoman will be brought together in some place now unknown, and will\r\npresent to Mr. Armadale some liquid yet unnamed, which will turn him\r\nfaint?--Do you seriously tell me you believe this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seriously tell you I believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, according to your view, these fulfillments of the dream will\r\nmark the progress of certain coming events, in which Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappiness, or Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s safety, will be dangerously involved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my firm conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor rose, laid aside his moral dissecting-knife, considered for a\r\nmoment, and took it up again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne last question,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any reason to give for going out\r\nof your way to adopt such a mystical view as this, when an unanswerably\r\nrational explanation of the dream lies straight before you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo reason,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Midwinter, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I can give, either to you or to my\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at his watch with the air of a man who is suddenly\r\nreminded that he has been wasting his time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no common ground to start from,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand if we talk till\r\ndoomsday, we should not agree. Excuse my leaving you rather abruptly.\r\nIt is later than I thought; and my morning\xe2\x80\x99s batch of sick people\r\nare waiting for me in the surgery. I have convinced _your_ mind, Mr.\r\nArmadale, at any rate; so the time we have given to this discussion has\r\nnot been altogether lost. Pray stop here, and smoke your cigar. I shall\r\nbe at your service again in less than an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d He nodded cordially to\r\nAllan, bowed formally to Midwinter, and quitted the room.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s back was turned, Allan left his place at the\r\ntable, and appealed to his friend, with that irresistible heartiness of\r\nmanner which had always found its way to Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s sympathies, from\r\nthe first day when they met at the Somersetshire inn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow the sparring-match between you and the doctor is over,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got two words to say on my side. Will you do something for my\r\nsake which you won\xe2\x80\x99t do for your own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s face brightened instantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI will do anything you ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Will you let the subject of the dream drop out of our talk\r\naltogether from this time forth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go a step further? Will you leave off thinking about the\r\ndream?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to leave off thinking about it, Allan. But I will try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow! Now give me that trumpery bit of paper, and let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntear it up, and have done with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried to snatch the manuscript out of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s hand; but\r\nMidwinter was too quick for him, and kept it beyond his reach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! come!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve set my heart on lighting my cigar\r\nwith it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter hesitated painfully. It was hard to resist Allan; but he did\r\nresist him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait a little,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you light your cigar\r\nwith it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long? Till to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLonger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill we leave the Isle of Man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLonger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it--give me a plain answer to a plain question! How long _will_\r\nyou wait?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter carefully restored the paper to its place in his pocketbook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctill we get to Thorpe Ambrose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE FIRST BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SECOND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. LURKING MISCHIEF.\r\n\r\n1. _From Ozias Midwinter to Mr. Brock_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThorpe Ambrose, June 15, 1851.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MR. BROCK--Only an hour since we reached this house, just as the\r\nservants were locking up for the night. Allan has gone to bed, worn out\r\nby our long day\xe2\x80\x99s journey, and has left me in the room they call the\r\nlibrary, to tell you the story of our journey to Norfolk. Being better\r\nseasoned than he is to fatigues of all kinds, my eyes are quite wakeful\r\nenough for writing a letter, though the clock on the chimney-piece\r\npoints to midnight, and we have been traveling since ten in the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last news you had of us was news sent by Allan from the Isle of\r\nMan. If I am not mistaken, he wrote to tell you of the night we passed\r\non board the wrecked ship. Forgive me, dear Mr. Brock, if I say nothing\r\non that subject until time has helped me to think of it with a quieter\r\nmind. The hard fight against myself must all be fought over again; but I\r\nwill win it yet, please God; I will, indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to trouble you with any account of our journeyings\r\nabout the northern and western districts of the island, or of the short\r\ncruises we took when the repairs of the yacht were at last complete.\r\nIt will be better if I get on at once to the morning of yesterday, the\r\nfourteenth. We had come in with the night-tide to Douglas Harbor, and,\r\nas soon as the post-office was open; Allan, by my advice, sent on shore\r\nfor letters. The messenger returned with one letter only, and the\r\nwriter of it proved to be the former mistress of Thorpe Ambrose--Mrs.\r\nBlanchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be informed, I think, of the contents of this letter, for\r\nit has seriously influenced Allan\xe2\x80\x99s plans. He loses everything, sooner\r\nor later, as you know, and he has lost the letter already. So I must\r\ngive you the substance of what Mrs. Blanchard wrote to him, as plainly\r\nas I can.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first page announced the departure of the ladies from Thorpe\r\nAmbrose. They left on the day before yesterday, the thirteenth, having,\r\nafter much hesitation, finally decided on going abroad, to visit some\r\nold friends settled in Italy, in the neighborhood of Florence. It\r\nappears to be quite possible that Mrs. Blanchard and her niece may\r\nsettle there, too, if they can find a suitable house and grounds to let.\r\nThey both like the Italian country and the Italian people, and they are\r\nwell enough off to please themselves. The elder lady has her jointure,\r\nand the younger is in possession of all her father\xe2\x80\x99s fortune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next page of the letter was, in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, far from a\r\npleasant page to read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter referring, in the most grateful terms, to the kindness which had\r\nleft her niece and herself free to leave their old home at their own\r\ntime, Mrs. Blanchard added that Allan\xe2\x80\x99s considerate conduct had produced\r\nsuch a strongly favorable impression among the friends and dependents of\r\nthe family that they were desirous of giving him a public reception\r\non his arrival among them. A preliminary meeting of the tenants on the\r\nestate and the principal persons in the neighboring town had already\r\nbeen held to discuss the arrangements, and a letter might be expected\r\nshortly from the clergyman inquiring when it would suit Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconvenience to take possession personally and publicly of his estates in\r\nNorfolk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will now be able to guess the cause of our sudden departure from\r\nthe Isle of Man. The first and foremost idea in your old pupil\xe2\x80\x99s mind,\r\nas soon as he had read Mrs. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s account of the proceedings at\r\nthe meeting, was the idea of escaping the public reception, and the one\r\ncertain way he could see of avoiding it was to start for Thorpe Ambrose\r\nbefore the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s letter could reach him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried hard to make him think a little before he acted on his first\r\nimpulse in this matter; but he only went on packing his portmanteau in\r\nhis own impenetrably good-humored way. In ten minutes his luggage was\r\nready, and in five minutes more he had given the crew their directions\r\nfor taking the yacht back to Somersetshire. The steamer to Liverpool was\r\nalongside of us in the harbor, and I had really no choice but to go on\r\nboard with him or to let him go by himself. I spare you the account of\r\nour stormy voyage, of our detention at Liverpool, and of the trains we\r\nmissed on our journey across the country. You know that we have got here\r\nsafely, and that is enough. What the servants think of the new squire\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsudden appearance among them, without a word of warning, is of no great\r\nconsequence. What the committee for arranging the public reception may\r\nthink of it when the news flies abroad to-morrow is, I am afraid, a more\r\nserious matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving already mentioned the servants, I may proceed to tell you that\r\nthe latter part of Mrs. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s letter was entirely devoted to\r\ninstructing Allan on the subject of the domestic establishment which\r\nshe has left behind her. It seems that all the servants, indoors and out\r\n(with three exceptions), are waiting here, on the chance that Allan\r\nwill continue them in their places. Two of these exceptions are readily\r\naccounted for: Mrs. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s maid and Miss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s maid go abroad\r\nwith their mistresses. The third exceptional case is the case of the\r\nupper housemaid; and here there is a little hitch. In plain words,\r\nthe housemaid has been sent away at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, for what Mrs.\r\nBlanchard rather mysteriously describes as \xe2\x80\x98levity of conduct with a\r\nstranger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you will laugh at me, but I must confess the truth. I have\r\nbeen made so distrustful (after what happened to us in the Isle of Man)\r\nof even the most trifling misadventures which connect themselves in any\r\nway with Allan\xe2\x80\x99s introduction to his new life and prospects, that I have\r\nalready questioned one of the men-servants here about this apparently\r\nunimportant matter of the housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s going away in disgrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I can learn is that a strange man had been noticed hanging\r\nsuspiciously about the grounds; that the housemaid was so ugly a woman\r\nas to render it next to a certainty that he had some underhand purpose\r\nto serve in making himself agreeable to her; and that he has not as yet\r\nbeen seen again in the neighborhood since the day of her dismissal. So\r\nmuch for the one servant who has been turned out at Thorpe Ambrose. I\r\ncan only hope there is no trouble for Allan brewing in that quarter. As\r\nfor the other servants who remain, Mrs. Blanchard describes them, both\r\nmen and women, as perfectly trustworthy, and they will all, no doubt,\r\ncontinue to occupy their present places.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving now done with Mrs. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s letter, my next duty is to beg\r\nyou, in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s name and with Allan\xe2\x80\x99s love, to come here and stay with\r\nhim at the earliest moment when you can leave Somersetshire. Although\r\nI cannot presume to think that my own wishes will have any special\r\ninfluence in determining you to accept this invitation, I must\r\nnevertheless acknowledge that I have a reason of my own for earnestly\r\ndesiring to see you here. Allan has innocently caused me a new anxiety\r\nabout my future relations with him, and I sorely need your advice to\r\nshow me the right way of setting that anxiety at rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulty which now perplexes me relates to the steward\xe2\x80\x99s place\r\nat Thorpe Ambrose. Before to-day I only knew that Allan had hit on\r\nsome plan of his own for dealing with this matter, rather strangely\r\ninvolving, among other results, the letting of the cottage which was\r\nthe old steward\xe2\x80\x99s place of abode, in consequence of the new steward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontemplated residence in the great house. A chance word in our\r\nconversation on the journey here led Allan into speaking out more\r\nplainly than he had spoken yet, and I heard to my unutterable\r\nastonishment that the person who was at the bottom of the whole\r\narrangement about the steward was no other than myself!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is needless to tell you how I felt this new instance of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkindness. The first pleasure of hearing from his own lips that I had\r\ndeserved the strongest proof he could give of his confidence in me was\r\nsoon dashed by the pain which mixes itself with all pleasure--at least,\r\nwith all that I have ever known. Never has my past life seemed so\r\ndreary to look back on as it seems now, when I feel how entirely it has\r\nunfitted me to take the place of all others that I should have liked to\r\noccupy in my friend\xe2\x80\x99s service. I mustered courage to tell him that I had\r\nnone of the business knowledge and business experience which his steward\r\nought to possess. He generously met the objection by telling me that I\r\ncould learn; and he has promised to send to London for the person who\r\nhas already been employed for the time being in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office,\r\nand who will, therefore, be perfectly competent to teach me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, too, think I can learn? If you do, I will work day and night to\r\ninstruct myself. But if (as I am afraid) the steward\xe2\x80\x99s duties are of\r\nfar too serious a kind to be learned off-hand by a man so young and so\r\ninexperienced as I am, then pray hasten your journey to Thorpe Ambrose,\r\nand exert your influence over Allan personally. Nothing less will induce\r\nhim to pass me over, and to employ a steward who is really fit to take\r\nthe place. Pray, pray act in this matter as you think best for Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterests. Whatever disappointment I may feel, _he_ shall not see it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, dear Mr. Brock,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGratefuly yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOZIAS MIDWINTER.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.--I open the envelope again to add one word more. If you have heard\r\nor seen anything since your return to Somersetshire of the woman in\r\nthe black dress and the red shawl, I hope you will not forget, when you\r\nwrite, to let me know it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO. M.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _From Mrs. Oldershaw to Miss Gwilt_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies\xe2\x80\x99 Toilet Repository, Diana Street, Pimlico,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWednesday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR LYDIA--To save the post, I write to you, after a long day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworry at my place of business, on the business letter-paper, having news\r\nsince we last met which it seems advisable to send you at the earliest\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo begin at the beginning. After carefully considering the thing, I\r\nam quite sure you will do wisely with young Armadale if you hold your\r\ntongue about Madeira and all that happened there. Your position was, no\r\ndoubt, a very strong one with his mother. You had privately helped\r\nher in playing a trick on her own father; you had been ungratefully\r\ndismissed, at a pitiably tender age, as soon as you had served her\r\npurpose; and, when you came upon her suddenly, after a separation of\r\nmore than twenty years, you found her in failing health, with a grown-up\r\nson, whom she had kept in total ignorance of the true story of her\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any such advantages as these with the young gentleman who has\r\nsurvived her? If he is not a born idiot he will decline to believe your\r\nshocking aspersions on the memory of his mother; and--seeing that you\r\nhave no proofs at this distance of time to meet him with--there is an\r\nend of your money-grubbing in the golden Armadale diggings. Mind, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t dispute that the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s heavy debt of obligation, after what\r\nyou did for her in Madeira, is not paid yet; and that the son is the\r\nnext person to settle with you, now the mother has slipped through your\r\nfingers. Only squeeze him the right way, my dear, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I venture\r\nto suggest--squeeze him the right way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd which is the right way? That question brings me to my news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you thought again of that other notion of yours of trying your\r\nhand on this lucky young gentleman, with nothing but your own good\r\nlooks and your own quick wits to help you? The idea hung on my mind so\r\nstrangely after you were gone that it ended in my sending a little note\r\nto my lawyer, to have the will under which young Armadale has got\r\nhis fortune examined at Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Commons. The result turns out to\r\nbe something infinitely more encouraging than either you or I could\r\npossibly have hoped for. After the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s report to me, there cannot\r\nbe a moment\xe2\x80\x99s doubt of what you ought to do. In two words, Lydia, take\r\nthe bull by the horns--and marry him!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite serious. He is much better worth the venture than you\r\nsuppose. Only persuade him to make you Mrs. Armadale, and you may set\r\nall after-discoveries at flat defiance. As long as he lives, you can\r\nmake your own terms with him; and, if he dies, the will entitles you, in\r\nspite of anything he can say or do--with children or without them--to\r\nan income chargeable on his estate of _twelve hundred a year for life_.\r\nThere is no doubt about this; the lawyer himself has looked at the will.\r\nOf course, Mr. Blanchard had his son and his son\xe2\x80\x99s widow in his eye\r\nwhen he made the provision. But, as it is not limited to any one heir by\r\nname, and not revoked anywhere, it now holds as good with young Armadale\r\nas it would have held under other circumstances with Mr. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson. What a chance for you, after all the miseries and the dangers you\r\nhave gone through, to be mistress of Thorpe Ambrose, if he lives; to\r\nhave an income for life, if he dies! Hook him, my poor dear; hook him at\r\nany sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you will make the same objection when you read this which\r\nyou made when we were talking about it the other day; I mean the\r\nobjection of your age.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my good creature, just listen to me. The question is--not whether\r\nyou were five-and-thirty last birthday; we will own the dreadful truth,\r\nand say you were--but whether you do look, or don\xe2\x80\x99t look, your real age.\r\nMy opinion on this matter ought to be, and is, one of the best opinions\r\nin London. I have had twenty years experience among our charming sex in\r\nmaking up battered old faces and wornout old figures to look like new,\r\nand I say positively you don\xe2\x80\x99t look a day over thirty, if as much.\r\nIf you will follow my advice about dressing, and use one or two of my\r\napplications privately, I guarantee to put you back three years more.\r\nI will forfeit all the money I shall have to advance for you in this\r\nmatter, if, when I have ground you young again in my wonderful mill,\r\nyou look more than seven-and-twenty in any man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes living--except,\r\nof course, when you wake anxious in the small hours of the morning; and\r\nthen, my dear, you will be old and ugly in the retirement of your own\r\nroom, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 you may say, \xe2\x80\x98supposing all this, here I am, even with your\r\nart to help me, looking a good six years older than he is; and that\r\nis against me at starting.\xe2\x80\x99 Is it? Just think again. Surely, your\r\nown experience must have shown you that the commonest of all common\r\nweaknesses, in young fellows of this Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s age, is to fall in love\r\nwith women older than themselves. Who are the men who really appreciate\r\nus in the bloom of our youth (I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I have cause to speak well of the\r\nbloom of youth; I made fifty guineas to-day by putting it on the spotted\r\nshoulders of a woman old enough to be your mother)--who are the men, I\r\nsay, who are ready to worship us when we are mere babies of seventeen?\r\nThe gay young gentlemen in the bloom of their own youth? No! The cunning\r\nold wretches who are on the wrong side of forty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the moral of this, as the story-books say?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moral is that the chances, with such a head as you have got on\r\nyour shoulders, are all in your favor. If you feel your present forlorn\r\nposition, as I believe you do; if you know what a charming woman (in the\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s eyes) you can still be when you please; and if all your resolution\r\nhas really come back, after that shocking outbreak of desperation on\r\nboard the steamer (natural enough, I own, under the dreadful provocation\r\nlaid on you), you will want no further persuasion from me to try this\r\nexperiment. Only to think of how things turn out! If the other young\r\nbooby had not jumped into the river after you, _this_ young booby would\r\nnever have had the estate. It really looks as if fate had determined\r\nthat you were to be Mrs. Armadale, of Thorpe Ambrose; and who can\r\ncontrol his fate, as the poet says?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend me one line to say Yes or No; and believe me your attached old\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARIA OLDERSHAW.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _From Miss Gwilt to Mrs. Oldershaw_.\r\n\r\nRichmond, Thursday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98YOU OLD WRETCH--I won\xe2\x80\x99t say Yes or No till I have had a long, long\r\nlook at my glass first. If you had any real regard for anybody but your\r\nwicked old self, you would know that the bare idea of marrying again\r\n(after what I have gone through) is an idea that makes my flesh creep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there can be no harm in your sending me a little more information\r\nwhile I am making up my mind. You have got twenty pounds of mine still\r\nleft out of those things you sold for me; send ten pounds here for\r\nmy expenses, in a post-office order, and use the other ten for making\r\nprivate inquiries at Thorpe Ambrose. I want to know when the two\r\nBlanchard women go away, and when young Armadale stirs up the dead ashes\r\nin the family fire-place. Are you quite sure he will turn out as easy to\r\nmanage as you think? If he takes after his hypocrite of a mother, I can\r\ntell you this: Judas Iscariot has come to life again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very comfortable in this lodging. There are lovely flowers in the\r\ngarden, and the birds wake me in the morning delightfully. I have hired\r\na reasonably good piano. The only man I care two straws about--don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nalarmed; he was laid in his grave many a long year ago, under the name\r\nof BEETHOVEN--keeps me company, in my lonely hours. The landlady would\r\nkeep me company, too, if I would only let her. I hate women. The new\r\ncurate paid a visit to the other lodger yesterday, and passed me on the\r\nlawn as he came out. My eyes have lost nothing yet, at any rate, though\r\nI _am_ five-and-thirty; the poor man actually blushed when I looked at\r\nhim! What sort of color do you think he would have turned, if one of the\r\nlittle birds in the garden had whispered in his ear, and told him the\r\ntrue story of the charming Miss Gwilt?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Mother Oldershaw. I rather doubt whether I am yours, or\r\nanybody\xe2\x80\x99s, affectionately; but we all tell lies at the bottoms of our\r\nletters, don\xe2\x80\x99t we? If you are my attached old friend, I must, of course,\r\nbe yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLYDIA GWILT.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.--Keep your odious powders and paints and washes for the spotted\r\nshoulders of your customers; not one of them shall touch my skin, I\r\npromise you. If you really want to be useful, try and find out some\r\nquieting draught to keep me from grinding my teeth in my sleep. I shall\r\nbreak them one of these nights; and then what will become of my beauty,\r\nI wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n4. _From Mrs. Oldershaw to Miss Gwilt_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies\xe2\x80\x99 Toilet Repository, Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR LYDIA--It is a thousand pities your letter was not addressed to\r\nMr. Armadale; your graceful audacity would have charmed him. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\naffect me; I am so well used to audacity in my way of life, you\r\nknow. Why waste your sparkling wit, my love, on your own impenetrable\r\nOldershaw? It only splutters and goes out. Will you try and be serious\r\nthis next time? I have news for you from Thorpe Ambrose, which is beyond\r\na joke, and which must not be trifled with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour after I got your letter I set the inquiries on foot. Not\r\nknowing what consequences they might lead to, I thought it safest to\r\nbegin in the dark. Instead of employing any of the people whom I have\r\nat my own disposal (who know you and know me), I went to the Private\r\nInquiry Office in Shadyside Place, and put the matter in the inspector\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands, in the character of a perfect stranger, and without mentioning\r\nyou at all. This was not the cheapest way of going to work, I own; but\r\nit was the safest way, which is of much greater consequence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe inspector and I understood each other in ten minutes; and the right\r\nperson for the purpose--the most harmless looking young man you ever saw\r\nin your life--was produced immediately. He left for Thorpe Ambrose an\r\nhour after I saw him. I arranged to call at the office on the afternoons\r\nof Saturday, Monday, and to-day for news. There was no news till to-day;\r\nand there I found our confidential agent just returned to town, and\r\nwaiting to favor me with a full account of his trip to Norfolk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, let me quiet your mind about those two questions of\r\nyours; I have got answers to both the one and the other. The Blanchard\r\nwomen go away to foreign parts on the thirteenth, and young Armadale is\r\nat this moment cruising somewhere at sea in his yacht. There is talk\r\nat Thorpe Ambrose of giving him a public reception, and of calling a\r\nmeeting of the local grandees to settle it all. The speechifying and\r\nfuss on these occasions generally wastes plenty of time, and the public\r\nreception is not thought likely to meet the new squire much before the\r\nend of the month.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf our messenger had done no more for us than this, I think he would\r\nhave earned his money. But the harmless young man is a regular Jesuit at\r\na private inquiry, with this great advantage over all the Popish priests\r\nI have ever seen, that he has not got his slyness written in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving to get his information through the female servants in the usual\r\nway, he addressed himself, with admirable discretion, to the ugliest\r\nwoman in the house. \xe2\x80\x98When they are nice-looking, and can pick and\r\nchoose,\xe2\x80\x99 as he neatly expressed it to me, \xe2\x80\x98they waste a great deal\r\nof valuable time in deciding on a sweetheart. When they are ugly,\r\nand haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the ghost of a chance of choosing, they snap at a\r\nsweetheart, if he comes their way, like a starved dog at a bone.\xe2\x80\x99 Acting\r\non these excellent principles, our confidential agent succeeded, after\r\ncertain unavoidable delays, in addressing himself to the upper housemaid\r\nat Thorpe Ambrose, and took full possession of her confidence at\r\nthe first interview. Bearing his instructions carefully in mind, he\r\nencouraged the woman to chatter, and was favored, of course, with all\r\nthe gossip of the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall. The greater part of it (as repeated\r\nto me) was of no earthly importance. But I listened patiently, and was\r\nrewarded by a valuable discovery at last. Here it is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems there is an ornamental cottage in the grounds at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose. For some reason unknown, young Armadale has chosen to let it,\r\nand a tenant has come in already. He is a poor half-pay major in the\r\narmy, named Milroy, a meek sort of man, by all accounts, with a turn\r\nfor occupying himself in mechanical pursuits, and with a domestic\r\nincumbrance in the shape of a bedridden wife, who has not been seen by\r\nanybody. Well, and what of all this? you will ask, with that sparkling\r\nimpatience which becomes you so well. My dear Lydia, don\xe2\x80\x99t sparkle! The\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s family affairs seriously concern us both, for, as ill luck will\r\nhave it, the man has got a daughter!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may imagine how I questioned our agent, and how our agent ransacked\r\nhis memory, when I stumbled, in due course, on such a discovery as\r\nthis. If Heaven is responsible for women\xe2\x80\x99s chattering tongues, Heaven\r\nbe praised! From Miss Blanchard to Miss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s maid; from Miss\r\nBlanchard\xe2\x80\x99s maid to Miss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s aunt\xe2\x80\x99s maid; from Miss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s maid, to the ugly housemaid; from the ugly housemaid to the\r\nharmless-looking young man--so the stream of gossip trickled into the\r\nright reservoir at last, and thirsty Mother Oldershaw has drunk it all\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn plain English, my dear, this is how it stands. The major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\r\nis a minx just turned sixteen; lively and nice-looking (hateful little\r\nwretch!), dowdy in her dress (thank Heaven!) and deficient in her\r\nmanners (thank Heaven again!). She has been brought up at home. The\r\ngoverness who last had charge of her left before her father moved to\r\nThorpe Ambrose. Her education stands woefully in want of a finishing\r\ntouch, and the major doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what to do next. None of his\r\nfriends can recommend him a new governess and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the\r\nnotion of sending the girl to school. So matters rest at present, on\r\nthe major\xe2\x80\x99s own showing; for so the major expressed himself at a morning\r\ncall which the father and daughter paid to the ladies at the great\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have now got my promised news, and you will have little difficulty,\r\nI think, in agreeing with me that the Armadale business must be settled\r\nat once, one way or the other. If, with your hopeless prospects, and\r\nwith what I may call your family claim on this young fellow, you decide\r\non giving him up, I shall have the pleasure of sending you the balance\r\nof your account with me (seven-and-twenty shillings), and shall then\r\nbe free to devote myself entirely to my own proper business. If, on the\r\ncontrary, you decide to try your luck at Thorpe Ambrose, then (there\r\nbeing no kind of doubt that the major\xe2\x80\x99s minx will set her cap at the\r\nyoung squire) I should be glad to hear how you mean to meet the double\r\ndifficulty of inflaming Mr. Armadale and extinguishing Miss Milroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARIA OLDERSHAW.\r\n\r\n5. _From Miss Gwilt to Mrs. Oldershaw.\r\n\r\n(First Answer.)_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichmond, Wednesday Morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMRS.

I have changed my mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote the first time after a horrible night. I write this time after\r\na ride on horseback, a tumbler of claret, and the breast of a chicken.\r\nIs that explanation enough? Please say Yes, for I want to go back to my\r\npiano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I can\xe2\x80\x99t go back yet; I must answer your question first. But are you\r\nreally so very simple as to suppose that I don\xe2\x80\x99t see straight through\r\nyou and your letter? You know that the major\xe2\x80\x99s difficulty is our\r\nopportunity as well as I do; but you want me to take the responsibility\r\nof making the first proposal, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Suppose I take it in your\r\nown roundabout way? Suppose I say, \xe2\x80\x98Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me how I propose\r\ninflaming Mr. Armadale and extinguishing Miss Milroy; the question is\r\nso shockingly abrupt I really can\xe2\x80\x99t answer it. Ask me, instead, if it is\r\nthe modest ambition of my life to become Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s governess?\xe2\x80\x99 Yes,\r\nif you please, Mrs. Oldershaw, and if you will assist me by becoming my\r\nreference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is for you! If some serious disaster happens (which is quite\r\npossible), what a comfort it will be to remember that it was all my\r\nfault!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I have done this for you, will you do something for me. I want to\r\ndream away the little time I am likely to have left here in my own way.\r\nBe a merciful Mother Oldershaw, and spare me the worry of looking at\r\nthe Ins and Outs, and adding up the chances For and Against, in this new\r\nventure of mine. Think for me, in short, until I am obliged to think for\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had better not write any more, or I shall say something savage that\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t like. I am in one of my tempers to-night. I want a husband to\r\nvex, or a child to beat, or something of that sort. Do you ever like to\r\nsee the summer insects kill themselves in the candle? I do, sometimes.\r\nGood-night, Mrs. Jezebel. The longer you can leave me here the better.\r\nThe air agrees with me, and I am looking charmingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cL.

Don\xe2\x80\x99t ride quite so far, and only drink half a tumblerful of\r\nclaret next time. I say no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we leave off our fencing-match and come to serious matters now?\r\nHow curiously hard it always seems to be for women to understand each\r\nother, especially when they have got their pens in their hands! But\r\nsuppose we try.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, to begin with: I gather from your letter that you have\r\nwisely decided to try the Thorpe Ambrose experiment, and to secure, if\r\nyou can, an excellent position at starting by becoming a member of Major\r\nMilroy\xe2\x80\x99s household. If the circumstances turn against you, and some\r\nother woman gets the governess\xe2\x80\x99s place (about which I shall have\r\nsomething more to say presently), you will then have no choice but to\r\nmake Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance in some other character. In any case,\r\nyou will want my assistance; and the first question, therefore, to set\r\nat rest between us is the question of what I am willing to do, and what\r\nI can do, to help you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman, my dear Lydia, with your appearance, your manners, your\r\nabilities, and your education, can make almost any excursions into\r\nsociety that she pleases if she only has money in her pocket and a\r\nrespectable reference to appeal to in cases of emergency. As to the\r\nmoney, in the first place. I will engage to find it, on condition of\r\nyour remembering my assistance with adequate pecuniary gratitude if you\r\nwin the Armadale prize. Your promise so to remember me, embodying the\r\nterms in plain figures, shall be drawn out on paper by my own lawyer, so\r\nthat we can sign and settle at once when I see you in London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext, as to the reference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, again, my services are at your disposal, on another condition. It\r\nis this: that you present yourself at Thorpe Ambrose, under the name\r\nto which you have returned ever since that dreadful business of your\r\nmarriage; I mean your own maiden name of Gwilt. I have only one motive\r\nin insisting on this; I wish to run no needless risks. My experience,\r\nas confidential adviser of my customers, in various romantic cases of\r\nprivate embarrassment, has shown me that an assumed name is, nine times\r\nout of ten, a very unnecessary and a very dangerous form of deception.\r\nNothing could justify your assuming a name but the fear of young\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s detecting you--a fear from which we are fortunately relieved\r\nby his mother\xe2\x80\x99s own conduct in keeping your early connection with her a\r\nprofound secret from her son and from everybody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next, and last, perplexity to settle relates, my dear, to the\r\nchances for and against your finding your way, in the capacity of\r\ngoverness, into Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s house. Once inside the door, with your\r\nknowledge of music and languages, if you can keep your temper, you may\r\nbe sure of keeping the place. The only doubt, as things are now, is\r\nwhether you can get it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the major\xe2\x80\x99s present difficulty about his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s education, the\r\nchances are, I think, in favor of his advertising for a governess. Say\r\nhe does advertise, what address will he give for applicants to write to?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he gives an address in London, good-by to all chances in your favor\r\nat once; for this plain reason, that we shall not be able to pick out\r\nhis advertisement from the advertisements of other people who want\r\ngovernesses, and who will give them addresses in London as well. If, on\r\nthe other hand, our luck helps us, and he refers his correspondents to\r\na shop, post-office, or what not _at Thorpe Ambrose_, there we have our\r\nadvertiser as plainly picked out for us as we can wish. In this last\r\ncase, I have little or no doubt--with me for your reference--of your\r\nfinding your way into the major\xe2\x80\x99s family circle. We have one great\r\nadvantage over the other women who will answer the advertisement. Thanks\r\nto my inquiries on the spot, I know Major Milroy to be a poor man; and\r\nwe will fix the salary you ask at a figure that is sure to tempt him. As\r\nfor the style of the letter, if you and I together can\xe2\x80\x99t write a modest\r\nand interesting application for the vacant place, I should like to know\r\nwho can?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this, however, is still in the future. For the present my advice\r\nis, stay where you are, and dream to your heart\xe2\x80\x99s content, till you hear\r\nfrom me again. I take in _The Times_ regularly, and you may trust my\r\nwary eye not to miss the right advertisement. We can luckily give the\r\nmajor time, without doing any injury to our own interests; for there\r\nis no fear just yet of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s getting the start of you. The public\r\nreception, as we know, won\xe2\x80\x99t be ready till near the end of the month;\r\nand we may safely trust young Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s vanity to keep him out of his\r\nnew house until his flatterers are all assembled to welcome him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s odd, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, to think how much depends on this half-pay\r\nofficer\xe2\x80\x99s decision? For my part, I shall wake every morning now with\r\nthe same question in my mind: If the major\xe2\x80\x99s advertisment appears, which\r\nwill the major say--Thorpe Ambrose, or London?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver, my dear Lydia, affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARIA OLDERSHAW.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ALLAN AS A LANDED GENTLEMAN.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning after his first night\xe2\x80\x99s rest at Thorpe Ambrose,\r\nAllan rose and surveyed the prospect from his bedroom window, lost in\r\nthe dense mental bewilderment of feeling himself to be a stranger in his\r\nown house.\r\n\r\nThe bedroom looked out over the great front door, with its portico, its\r\nterrace and flight of steps beyond, and, further still, the broad sweep\r\nof the well-timbered park to close the view. The morning mist nestled\r\nlightly about the distant trees; and the cows were feeding sociably,\r\nclose to the iron fence which railed off the park from the drive\r\nin front of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cAll mine!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Allan, staring in blank\r\namazement at the prospect of his own possessions. \xe2\x80\x9cHang me if I can beat\r\nit into my head yet. All mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dressed, left his room, and walked along the corridor which led to\r\nthe staircase and hall, opening the doors in succession as he passed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe rooms in this part of the house were bedrooms and dressing-rooms,\r\nlight, spacious, perfectly furnished; and all empty, except the one\r\nbed-chamber next to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s, which had been appropriated to Midwinter.\r\nHe was still sleeping when his friend looked in on him, having sat late\r\ninto the night writing his letter to Mr. Brock. Allan went on to the end\r\nof the first corridor, turned at right angles into a second, and, that\r\npassed, gained the head of the great staircase. \xe2\x80\x9cNo romance here,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to himself, looking down the handsomely carpeted stone stairs into\r\nthe bright modern hall. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing to startle Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s fidgety\r\nnerves in this house.\xe2\x80\x9d There was nothing, indeed; Allan\xe2\x80\x99s essentially\r\nsuperficial observation had not misled him for once. The mansion of\r\nThorpe Ambrose (built after the pulling down of the dilapidated old\r\nmanor-house) was barely fifty years old. Nothing picturesque, nothing in\r\nthe slightest degree suggestive of mystery and romance, appeared in any\r\npart of it. It was a purely conventional country house--the product of\r\nthe classical idea filtered judiciously through the commercial English\r\nmind. Viewed on the outer side, it presented the spectacle of a modern\r\nmanufactory trying to look like an ancient temple. Viewed on the inner\r\nside, it was a marvel of luxurious comfort in every part of it, from\r\nbasement to roof. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd quite right, too,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Allan, sauntering\r\ncontentedly down the broad, gently graduated stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cDeuce take all\r\nmystery and romance! Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clean and comfortable, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArrived in the hall, the new master of Thorpe Ambrose hesitated, and\r\nlooked about him, uncertain which way to turn next.\r\n\r\nThe four reception-rooms on the ground-floor opened into the hall, two\r\non either side. Allan tried the nearest door on his right hand at a\r\nventure, and found himself in the drawing-room. Here the first sign of\r\nlife appeared, under life\xe2\x80\x99s most attractive form. A young girl was in\r\nsolitary possession of the drawing-room. The duster in her hand appeared\r\nto associate her with the domestic duties of the house; but at that\r\nparticular moment she was occupied in asserting the rights of nature\r\nover the obligations of service. In other words, she was attentively\r\ncontemplating her own face in the glass over the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! there! don\xe2\x80\x99t let me frighten you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, as the girl\r\nstarted away from the glass, and stared at him in unutterable confusion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree with you, my dear; your face is well worth looking at.\r\nWho are you? Oh, the housemaid. And what\xe2\x80\x99s your name? Susan, eh? Come!\r\nI like your name, to begin with. Do you know who I am, Susan? I\xe2\x80\x99m your\r\nmaster, though you may not think it. Your character? Oh, yes! Mrs.\r\nBlanchard gave you a capital character. You shall stop here; don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nafraid. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a good girl, Susan, and wear smart little caps and\r\naprons and bright ribbons, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll look nice and pretty, and dust the\r\nfurniture, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d With this summary of a housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s duties, Allan\r\nsauntered back into the hall, and found more signs of life in that\r\nquarter. A man-servant appeared on this occasion, and bowed, as became a\r\nvassal in a linen jacket, before his liege lord in a wide-awake hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who may you be?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cNot the man who let us in last\r\nnight? Ah, I thought not. The second footman, eh? Character? Oh, yes;\r\ncapital character. Stop here, of course. You can valet me, can you?\r\nBother valeting me! I like to put on my own clothes, and brush them,\r\ntoo, when they _are_ on; and, if I only knew how to black my own boots,\r\nby George, I should like to do it! What room\xe2\x80\x99s this? Morning-room, eh?\r\nAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s the dining-room, of course. Good heavens, what a table! it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nas long as my yacht, and longer. I say, by-the-by, what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\r\nRichard, is it? Well, Richard, the vessel I sail in is a vessel of my\r\nown building! What do you think of that? You look to me just the right\r\nsort of man to be my steward on board. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not sick at sea--oh,\r\nyou _are_ sick at sea? Well, then, we\xe2\x80\x99ll say nothing more about it.\r\nAnd what room is this? Ah, yes; the library, of course--more in Mr.\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s way than mine. Mr. Midwinter is the gentleman who came here\r\nwith me last night; and mind this, Richard, you\xe2\x80\x99re all to show him as\r\nmuch attention as you show me. Where are we now? What\xe2\x80\x99s this door at the\r\nback? Billiard-room and smoking-room, eh? Jolly. Another door! and more\r\nstairs! Where do they go to? and who\xe2\x80\x99s this coming up? Take your time,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am; you\xe2\x80\x99re not quite so young as you were once--take your time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe object of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s humane caution was a corpulent elderly woman of\r\nthe type called \xe2\x80\x9cmotherly.\xe2\x80\x9d Fourteen stairs were all that separated her\r\nfrom the master of the house; she ascended them with fourteen stoppages\r\nand fourteen sighs. Nature, various in all things, is infinitely various\r\nin the female sex. There are some women whose personal qualities reveal\r\nthe Loves and the Graces; and there are other women whose personal\r\nqualities suggest the Perquisites and the Grease Pot. This was one of\r\nthe other women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad to see you looking so well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, when the cook, in\r\nthe majesty of her office, stood proclaimed before him. \xe2\x80\x9cYour name is\r\nGripper, is it? I consider you, Mrs. Gripper, the most valuable person\r\nin the house. For this reason, that nobody in the house eats a heartier\r\ndinner every day than I do. Directions? Oh, no; I\xe2\x80\x99ve no directions to\r\ngive. I leave all that to you. Lots of strong soup, and joints done\r\nwith the gravy in them--there\xe2\x80\x99s my notion of good feeding, in two\r\nwords. Steady! Here\xe2\x80\x99s somebody else. Oh, to be sure--the butler! Another\r\nvaluable person. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go right through all the wine in the cellar,\r\nMr. Butler; and if I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you a sound opinion after that,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll persevere boldly, and go right through it again. Talking of\r\nwine--halloo! here are more of them coming up stairs. There! there!\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourselves. You\xe2\x80\x99ve all got capital characters, and you\r\nshall all stop here along with me. What was I saying just now? Something\r\nabout wine; so it was. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, Mr. Butler, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t every\r\nday that a new master comes to Thorpe Ambrose; and it\xe2\x80\x99s my wish that we\r\nshould all start together on the best possible terms. Let the servants\r\nhave a grand jollification downstairs to celebrate my arrival, and\r\ngive them what they like to drink my health in. It\xe2\x80\x99s a poor heart, Mrs.\r\nGripper, that never rejoices, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? No; I won\xe2\x80\x99t look at the cellar\r\nnow: I want to go out, and get a breath of fresh air before breakfast.\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Richard? I say, have I got a garden here? Which side of the\r\nhouse is it! That side, eh? You needn\xe2\x80\x99t show me round. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go alone,\r\nRichard, and lose myself, if I can, in my own property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words Allan descended the terrace steps in front of the\r\nhouse, whistling cheerfully. He had met the serious responsibility of\r\nsettling his domestic establishment to his own entire satisfaction.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople talk of the difficulty of managing their servants,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nAllan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth do they mean? I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any difficulty at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He opened an ornamental gate leading out of the drive at the side of the\r\nhouse, and, following the footman\xe2\x80\x99s directions, entered the shrubbery\r\nthat sheltered the Thorpe Ambrose gardens. \xe2\x80\x9cNice shady sort of place\r\nfor a cigar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, as he sauntered along with his hands in his\r\npockets \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could beat it into my head that it really belongs to\r\n_me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shrubbery opened on the broad expanse of a flower garden, flooded\r\nbright in its summer glory by the light of the morning sun.\r\n\r\nOn one side, an archway, broken through, a wall, led into the fruit\r\ngarden. On the other, a terrace of turf led to ground on a lower level,\r\nlaid out as an Italian garden. Wandering past the fountains and statues,\r\nAllan reached another shrubbery, winding its way apparently to some\r\nremote part of the grounds. Thus far, not a human creature had been\r\nvisible or audible anywhere; but, as he approached the end of the second\r\nshrubbery, it struck him that he heard something on the other side of\r\nthe foliage. He stopped and listened. There were two voices speaking\r\ndistinctly--an old voice that sounded very obstinate, and a young voice\r\nthat sounded very angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t allow it, and I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t allow it. What would Mr. Armadale say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Armadale is the gentleman I take him for, you old brute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied the young voice, \xe2\x80\x9che would say, \xe2\x80\x98Come into my garden, Miss\r\nMilroy, as often as you like, and take as many nosegays as you please.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Allan\xe2\x80\x99s bright blue eyes twinkled mischievously. Inspired by a sudden\r\nidea, he stole softly to the end of the shrubbery, darted round the\r\ncorner of it, and, vaulting over a low ring fence, found himself in a\r\ntrim little paddock, crossed by a gravel walk. At a short distance down\r\nthe wall stood a young lady, with her back toward him, trying to force\r\nher way past an impenetrable old man, with a rake in his hand, who stood\r\nobstinately in front of her, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome into my garden, Miss Milroy, as often as you like, and take as\r\nmany nosegays as you please,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, remorselessly repeating her\r\nown words.\r\n\r\nThe young lady turned round, with a scream; her muslin dress, which she\r\nwas holding up in front, dropped from her hand, and a prodigious lapful\r\nof flowers rolled out on the gravel walk.\r\n\r\nBefore another word could be said, the impenetrable old man stepped\r\nforward, with the utmost composure, and entered on the question of his\r\nown personal interests, as if nothing whatever had happened, and nobody\r\nwas present but his new master and himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bid you humbly welcome to Thorpe Ambrose, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said this ancient of\r\nthe gardens. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Abraham Sage. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been employed in the grounds\r\nfor more than forty years; and I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll be pleased to continue me\r\nin my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, with vision inexorably limited to the horizon of his own prospects,\r\nspoke the gardener, and spoke in vain. Allan was down on his knees on\r\nthe gravel walk, collecting the fallen flowers, and forming his first\r\nimpressions of Miss Milroy from the feet upward.\r\n\r\nShe was pretty; she was not pretty; she charmed, she disappointed, she\r\ncharmed again. Tried by recognized line and rule, she was too short and\r\ntoo well developed for her age. And yet few men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes would have wished\r\nher figure other than it was. Her hands were so prettily plump and\r\ndimpled that it was hard to see how red they were with the blessed\r\nexuberance of youth and health. Her feet apologized gracefully for her\r\nold and ill fitting shoes; and her shoulders made ample amends for the\r\nmisdemeanor in muslin which covered them in the shape of a dress. Her\r\ndark-gray eyes were lovely in their clear softness of color, in their\r\nspirit, tenderness, and sweet good humor of expression; and her hair\r\n(where a shabby old garden hat allowed it to be seen) was of just that\r\nlighter shade of brown which gave value by contrast to the darker\r\nbeauty of her eyes. But these attractions passed, the little attendant\r\nblemishes and imperfections of this self-contradictory girl began again.\r\nHer nose was too short, her mouth was too large, her face was too round\r\nand too rosy. The dreadful justice of photography would have had no\r\nmercy on her; and the sculptors of classical Greece would have bowed\r\nher regretfully out of their studios. Admitting all this, and more, the\r\ngirdle round Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s waist was the girdle of Venus nevertheless;\r\nand the passkey that opens the general heart was the key she carried,\r\nif ever a girl possessed it yet. Before Allan had picked up his second\r\nhandful of flowers, Allan was in love with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t! pray don\xe2\x80\x99t, Mr. Armadale!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, receiving the flowers under\r\nprotest, as Allan vigorously showered them back into the lap of her\r\ndress. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so ashamed! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to invite myself in that bold way\r\ninto your garden; my tongue ran away with me--it did, indeed! What can I\r\nsay to excuse myself? Oh, Mr. Armadale, what must you think of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan suddenly saw his way to a compliment, and tossed it up to her\r\nforthwith, with the third handful of flowers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I think, Miss Milroy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in his blunt, boyish\r\nway. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the luckiest walk I ever took in my life was the walk this\r\nmorning that brought me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked eager and handsome. He was not addressing a woman worn out\r\nwith admiration, but a girl just beginning a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life; and it did\r\nhim no harm, at any rate, to speak in the character of master of Thorpe\r\nAmbrose. The penitential expression on Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s face gently melted\r\naway; she looked down, demure and smiling, at the flowers in her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI deserve a good scolding,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve compliments, Mr.\r\nArmadale--least of all from _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, you do!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the headlong Allan, getting briskly on\r\nhis legs. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a compliment; it\xe2\x80\x99s true. You are the\r\nprettiest--I beg your pardon, Miss Milroy! _my_ tongue ran away with me\r\nthat time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmong the heavy burdens that are laid on female human nature, perhaps\r\nthe heaviest, at the age of sixteen, is the burden of gravity. Miss\r\nMilroy struggled, tittered, struggled again, and composed herself for\r\nthe time being.\r\n\r\nThe gardener, who still stood where he had stood from the first,\r\nimmovably waiting for his next opportunity, saw it now, and gently\r\npushed his personal interests into the first gap of silence that had\r\nopened within his reach since Allan\xe2\x80\x99s appearance on the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI humbly bid you welcome to Thorpe Ambrose, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Abraham Sage,\r\nbeginning obstinately with his little introductory speech for the second\r\ntime. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore he could deliver himself of his name, Miss Milroy looked\r\naccidentally in the horticulturist\xe2\x80\x99s pertinacious face, and instantly\r\nlost her hold on her gravity beyond recall. Allan, never backward in\r\nfollowing a boisterous example of any sort, joined in her laughter with\r\nright goodwill. The wise man of the gardens showed no surprise, and took\r\nno offense. He waited for another gap of silence, and walked in again\r\ngently with his personal interests the moment the two young people\r\nstopped to take breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been employed in the grounds,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Abraham Sage,\r\nirrepressibly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor more than forty years--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be employed in the grounds for forty more, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only\r\nhold your tongue and take yourself off!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, as soon as he\r\ncould speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you kindly, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gardener, with the utmost politeness,\r\nbut with no present signs either of holding his tongue or of taking\r\nhimself off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan.\r\n\r\nAbraham Sage carefully cleared his throat, and shifted his rake from\r\none hand to the other. He looked down the length of his own invaluable\r\nimplement, with a grave interest and attention, seeing, apparently, not\r\nthe long handle of a rake, but the long perspective of a vista, with a\r\nsupplementary personal interest established at the end of it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nmore convenient, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed this immovable man, \xe2\x80\x9cI should wish\r\nrespectfully to speak to you about my son. Perhaps it may be more\r\nconvenient in the course of the day? My humble duty, sir, and my best\r\nthanks. My son is strictly sober. He is accustomed to the stables, and\r\nhe belongs to the Church of England--without incumbrances.\xe2\x80\x9d Having thus\r\nplanted his offspring provisionally in his master\xe2\x80\x99s estimation, Abraham\r\nSage shouldered his invaluable rake, and hobbled slowly out of view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s a specimen of a trustworthy old servant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99d rather take my chance of being cheated by a new one. _You_\r\nshall not be troubled with him again, Miss Milroy, at any rate. All the\r\nflower-beds in the garden are at your disposal, and all the fruit in the\r\nfruit season, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only come here and eat it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Armadale, how very, very kind you are. How can I thank you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan saw his way to another compliment--an elaborate compliment, in the\r\nshape of a trap, this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can do me the greatest possible favor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can assist me\r\nin forming an agreeable impression of my own grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! how?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Milroy, innocently.\r\n\r\nAllan judiciously closed the trap on the spot in these words: \xe2\x80\x9cBy taking\r\nme with you, Miss Milroy, on your morning walk.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke, smiled, and\r\noffered his arm.\r\n\r\nShe saw the way, on her side, to a little flirtation. She rested her\r\nhand on his arm, blushed, hesitated, and suddenly took it away again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s quite right, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, devoting\r\nherself with the deepest attention to her collection of flowers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOughtn\xe2\x80\x99t we to have some old lady here? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it improper to take your\r\narm until I know you a little better than I do now? I am obliged to ask;\r\nI have had so little instruction; I have seen so little of society, and\r\none of papa\xe2\x80\x99s friends once said my manners were too bold for my age.\r\nWhat do _you_ think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a very good thing your papa\xe2\x80\x99s friend is not here now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered the outspoken Allan; \xe2\x80\x9cI should quarrel with him to a dead\r\ncertainty. As for society, Miss Milroy, nobody knows less about it than\r\nI do; but if we _had_ an old lady here, I must say myself I think she\r\nwould be uncommonly in the way. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Allan, imploringly\r\noffering his arm for the second time. \xe2\x80\x9cDo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Milroy looked up at him sidelong from her flowers \xe2\x80\x9cYou are as bad\r\nas the gardener, Mr. Armadale!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked down again in a flutter\r\nof indecision. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and took his arm the\r\ninstant afterward without the slightest hesitation.\r\n\r\nThey moved away together over the daisied turf of the paddock, young\r\nand bright and happy, with the sunlight of the summer morning shining\r\ncloudless over their flowery path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where are we going to, now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cInto another garden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed gayly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow very odd of you, Mr. Armadale, not to know, when\r\nit all belongs to you! Are you really seeing Thorpe Ambrose this morning\r\nfor the first time? How indescribably strange it must feel! No, no;\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say any more complimentary things to me just yet. You may turn my\r\nhead if you do. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the old lady with us; and I really must\r\ntake care of myself. Let me be useful; let me tell you all about your\r\nown grounds. We are going out at that little gate, across one of the\r\ndrives in the park, and then over the rustic bridge, and then round\r\nthe corner of the plantation--where do you think? To where I live, Mr.\r\nArmadale; to the lovely little cottage that you have let to papa. Oh, if\r\nyou only knew how lucky we thought ourselves to get it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, looked up at her companion, and stopped another compliment\r\non the incorrigible Allan\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll drop your arm,\xe2\x80\x9d she said coquettishly, \xe2\x80\x9cif you do! We _were_ lucky\r\nto get the cottage, Mr. Armadale. Papa said he felt under an obligation\r\nto you for letting it, the day we got in. And _I_ said I felt under an\r\nobligation, no longer ago than last week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Miss Milroy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It may surprise you to hear it; but if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t let the cottage\r\nto papa, I believe I should have suffered the indignity and misery of\r\nbeing sent to school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s memory reverted to the half-crown that he had spun on the\r\ncabin-table of the yacht, at Castletown. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she only knew that I had\r\ntossed up for it!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, guiltily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why I should feel such a horror of\r\ngoing to school,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Miss Milroy, misinterpreting the momentary\r\nsilence on her companion\xe2\x80\x99s side. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had gone to school in early\r\nlife--I mean at the age when other girls go--I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have minded it\r\nnow. But I had no such chance at the time. It was the time of mamma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nillness and of papa\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate speculation; and as papa had nobody to\r\ncomfort him but me, of course I stayed at home. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh; I was\r\nof some use, I can tell you. I helped papa over his trouble, by sitting\r\non his knee after dinner, and asking him to tell me stories of all the\r\nremarkable people he had known when he was about in the great world, at\r\nhome and abroad. Without me to amuse him in the evening, and his clock\r\nto occupy him in the daytime--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis clock?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! I ought to have told you. Papa is an extraordinary mechanical\r\ngenius. You will say so, too, when you see his clock. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nlike so large, of course, but it\xe2\x80\x99s on the model of the famous clock\r\nat Strasbourg. Only think, he began it when I was eight years old; and\r\n(though I was sixteen last birthday) it isn\xe2\x80\x99t finished yet! Some of our\r\nfriends were quite surprised he should take to such a thing when his\r\ntroubles began. But papa himself set that right in no time; he reminded\r\nthem that Louis the Sixteenth took to lock-making when _his_ troubles\r\nbegan, and then everybody was perfectly satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped, and\r\nchanged color confusedly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in genuine\r\nembarrassment this time, \xe2\x80\x9chere is my unlucky tongue running away with me\r\nagain! I am talking to you already as if I had known you for years! This\r\nis what papa\xe2\x80\x99s friend meant when he said my manners were too bold. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquite true; I have a dreadful way of getting familiar with people, if--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She checked herself suddenly, on the brink of ending the sentence by\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cif I like them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; do go on!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fault of mine to be familiar,\r\ntoo. Besides, we _must_ be familiar; we are such near neighbors. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nrather an uncultivated sort of fellow, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know quite how to say\r\nit; but I want your cottage to be jolly and friendly with my house, and\r\nmy house to be jolly and friendly with your cottage. There\xe2\x80\x99s my meaning,\r\nall in the wrong words. Do go on, Miss Milroy; pray go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled and hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly remember where I was,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cI only remember I had something I wanted to tell you. This\r\ncomes, Mr. Armadale, of my taking your arm. I should get on so much\r\nbetter, if you would only consent to walk separately. You won\xe2\x80\x99t? Well,\r\nthen, will you tell me what it was I wanted to say? Where was I before I\r\nwent wandering off to papa\xe2\x80\x99s troubles and papa\xe2\x80\x99s clock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt school!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Allan, with a prodigious effort of memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Not_ at school, you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Milroy; \xe2\x80\x9cand all through _you_.\r\nNow I can go on again, which is a great comfort. I am quite serious, Mr.\r\nArmadale, in saying that I should have been sent to school, if you had\r\nsaid No when papa proposed for the cottage. This is how it happened.\r\nWhen we began moving in, Mrs. Blanchard sent us a most kind message from\r\nthe great house to say that her servants were at our disposal, if we\r\nwanted any assistance. The least papa and I could do, after that, was to\r\ncall and thank her. We saw Mrs. Blanchard and Miss Blanchard. Mistress\r\nwas charming, and miss looked perfectly lovely in her mourning. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nyou admire her? She\xe2\x80\x99s tall and pale and graceful--quite your idea of\r\nbeauty, I should think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing like it,\xe2\x80\x9d began Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cMy idea of beauty at the present\r\nmoment--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Milroy felt it coming, and instantly took her hand off his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean I have never seen either Mrs. Blanchard or her niece,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nAllan, precipitately correcting himself.\r\n\r\nMiss Milroy tempered justice with mercy, and put her hand back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow extraordinary that you should never have seen them!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are a perfect stranger to everything and everybody at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose! Well, after Miss Blanchard and I had sat and talked a little\r\nwhile, I heard my name on Mrs. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s lips and instantly held my\r\nbreath. She was asking papa if I had finished my education. Out came\r\npapa\xe2\x80\x99s great grievance directly. My old governess, you must know, left\r\nus to be married just before we came here, and none of our friends\r\ncould produce a new one whose terms were reasonable. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m told, Mrs.\r\nBlanchard, by people who understand it better than I do,\xe2\x80\x99 says papa,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that advertising is a risk. It all falls on me, in Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s state\r\nof health, and I suppose I must end in sending my little girl to school.\r\nDo you happen to know of a school within the means of a poor man?\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs.\r\nBlanchard shook her head; I could have kissed her on the spot for doing\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x98All my experience, Major Milroy,\xe2\x80\x99 says this perfect angel of a\r\nwoman, \xe2\x80\x98is in favor of advertising. My niece\xe2\x80\x99s governess was originally\r\nobtained by an advertisement, and you may imagine her value to us when I\r\ntell you she lived in our family for more than ten years.\xe2\x80\x99 I could have\r\ngone down on both my knees and worshipped Mrs. Blanchard then and there;\r\nand I only wonder I didn\xe2\x80\x99t! Papa was struck at the time--I could see\r\nthat--and he referred to it again on the way home. \xe2\x80\x98Though I have been\r\nlong out of the world, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 says papa, \xe2\x80\x98I know a highly-bred woman\r\nand a sensible woman when I see her. Mrs. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s experience puts\r\nadvertising in a new light; I must think about it.\xe2\x80\x99 He has thought about\r\nit, and (though he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t openly confessed it to me) I know that he\r\ndecided to advertise, no later than last night. So, if papa thanks you\r\nfor letting the cottage, Mr. Armadale, I thank you, too. But for you, we\r\nshould never have known darling Mrs. Blanchard; and but for darling Mrs.\r\nBlanchard, I should have been sent to school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Allan could reply, they turned the corner of the plantation,\r\nand came in sight of the cottage. Description of it is needless; the\r\ncivilized universe knows it already. It was the typical cottage of the\r\ndrawing-master\xe2\x80\x99s early lessons in neat shading and the broad pencil\r\ntouch--with the trim thatch, the luxuriant creepers, the modest\r\nlattice-windows, the rustic porch, and the wicker bird-cage, all\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it lovely?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Milroy. \xe2\x80\x9cDo come in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t the major think it too early?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEarly or late, I am sure papa will be only too glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe led the way briskly up the garden path, and opened the parlor door.\r\nAs Allan followed her into the little room, he saw, at the further end\r\nof it, a gentleman sitting alone at an old-fashioned writing-table, with\r\nhis back turned to his visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa! a surprise for you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Milroy, rousing him from his\r\noccupation. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale has come to Thorpe Ambrose; and I have brought\r\nhim here to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe major started; rose, bewildered for the moment; recovered\r\nhimself immediately, and advanced to welcome his young landlord, with\r\nhospitable, outstretched hand.\r\n\r\nA man with a larger experience of the world and a finer observation\r\nof humanity than Allan possessed would have seen the story of Major\r\nMilroy\xe2\x80\x99s life written in Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s face. The home troubles that\r\nhad struck him were plainly betrayed in his stooping figure and his wan,\r\ndeeply wrinkled cheeks, when he first showed himself on rising from\r\nhis chair. The changeless influence of one monotonous pursuit and one\r\nmonotonous habit of thought was next expressed in the dull, dreamy\r\nself-absorption of his manner and his look while his daughter was\r\nspeaking to him. The moment after, when he had roused himself to welcome\r\nhis guest, was the moment which made the self-revelation complete. Then\r\nthere flickered in the major\xe2\x80\x99s weary eyes a faint reflection of the\r\nspirit of his happier youth. Then there passed over the major\xe2\x80\x99s dull\r\nand dreamy manner a change which told unmistakably of social graces and\r\naccomplishments, learned at some past time in no ignoble social school;\r\na man who had long since taken his patient refuge from trouble in his\r\nown mechanical pursuit; a man only roused at intervals to know himself\r\nagain for what he once had been. So revealed to all eyes that could read\r\nhim aright, Major Milroy now stood before Allan, on the first morning of\r\nan acquaintance which was destined to be an event in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am heartily glad to see you, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, speaking in the\r\nchangeless quiet, subdued tone peculiar to most men whose occupations\r\nare of the solitary and monotonous kind. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have done me one favor\r\nalready by taking me as your tenant, and you now do me another by paying\r\nthis friendly visit. If you have not breakfasted already, let me waive\r\nall ceremony on my side, and ask you to take your place at our little\r\ntable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the greatest pleasure, Major Milroy, if I am not in the way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied Allan, delighted at his reception. \xe2\x80\x9cI was sorry to hear from\r\nMiss Milroy that Mrs. Milroy is an invalid. Perhaps my being here\r\nunexpectedly; perhaps the sight of a strange face--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand your hesitation, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d said the major; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is\r\nquite unnecessary. Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s illness keeps her entirely confined to\r\nher own room. Have we got everything we want on the table, my love?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on, changing the subject so abruptly that a closer observer than\r\nAllan might have suspected it was distasteful to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you come and\r\nmake tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s attention appeared to be already pre-engaged; she made no\r\nreply. While her father and Allan had been exchanging civilities, she\r\nhad been putting the writing-table in order, and examining the various\r\nobjects scattered on it with the unrestrained curiosity of a spoiled\r\nchild. The moment after the major had spoken to her, she discovered a\r\nmorsel of paper hidden between the leaves of the blotting-book, snatched\r\nit up, looked at it, and turned round instantly, with an exclamation of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo my eyes deceive me, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cOr were you really and truly\r\nwriting the advertisement when I came in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had just finished it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her father. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear, Mr.\r\nArmadale is here--we are waiting for breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale knows all about it,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Miss Milroy. \xe2\x80\x9cI told him in\r\nthe garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cPray, don\xe2\x80\x99t make a stranger of me, major! If\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s about the governess, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got something (in an indirect sort of\r\nway) to do with it too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMajor Milroy smiled. Before he could answer, his daughter, who had been\r\nreading the advertisement, appealed to him eagerly, for the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, papa,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing here I don\xe2\x80\x99t like at all! Why\r\ndo you put grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s initials at the end? Why do you tell them to\r\nwrite to grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s house in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear! your mother can do nothing in this matter, as you know. And\r\nas for me (even if I went to London), questioning strange ladies about\r\ntheir characters and accomplishments is the last thing in the world that\r\nI am fit to do. Your grandmamma is on the spot; and your grandmamma is\r\nthe proper person to receive the letters, and to make all the necessary\r\ninquires.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I want to see the letters myself,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted the spoiled child.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of them are sure to be amusing--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t apologize for this very unceremonious reception of you, Mr.\r\nArmadale,\xe2\x80\x9d said the major, turning to Allan, with a quaint and quiet\r\nhumor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be useful as a warning, if you ever chance to marry and\r\nhave a daughter, not to begin, as I have done, by letting her have her\r\nown way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan laughed, and Miss Milroy persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to help in choosing which letters\r\nwe answer, and which we don\xe2\x80\x99t. I think I ought to have some voice in the\r\nselection of my own governess. Why not tell them, papa, to send their\r\nletters down here--to the post-office or the stationer\xe2\x80\x99s, or anywhere\r\nyou like? When you and I have read them, we can send up the letters we\r\nprefer to grandmamma; and she can ask all the questions, and pick out\r\nthe best governess, just as you have arranged already, without leaving\r\nME entirely in the dark, which I consider (don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mr. Armadale?)\r\nto be quite inhuman. Let me alter the address, papa; do, there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndarling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall get no breakfast, Mr. Armadale, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t say Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmajor good-humoredly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo as you like, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to\r\nhis daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as it ends in your grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s managing the\r\nmatter for us, the rest is of very little consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Milroy took up her father\xe2\x80\x99s pen, drew it through the last line of\r\nthe advertisement, and wrote the altered address with her own hand as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Apply, by letter, to M., Post-office, Thorpe Ambrose, Norfolk_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, bustling to her place at the breakfast-table. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nadvertisement may go to London now; and, if a governess _does_ come of\r\nit, oh, papa, who in the name of wonder will she be? Tea or coffee, Mr.\r\nArmadale? I\xe2\x80\x99m really ashamed of having kept you waiting. But it is such\r\na comfort,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, saucily, \xe2\x80\x9cto get all one\xe2\x80\x99s business off one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind before breakfast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather, daughter, and guest sat down together sociably at the little\r\nround table, the best of good neighbors and good friends already.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later, one of the London newsboys got _his_ business off his\r\nmind before breakfast. His district was Diana Street, Pimlico; and the\r\nlast of the morning\xe2\x80\x99s newspapers which he disposed of was the newspaper\r\nhe left at Mrs. Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE CLAIMS OF SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nMore than an hour after Allan had set forth on his exploring expedition\r\nthrough his own grounds, Midwinter rose, and enjoyed, in his turn, a\r\nfull view by daylight of the magnificence of the new house.\r\n\r\nRefreshed by his long night\xe2\x80\x99s rest, he descended the great staircase as\r\ncheerfully as Allan himself. One after another, he, too, looked into\r\nthe spacious rooms on the ground floor in breathless astonishment at the\r\nbeauty and the luxury which surrounded him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe house where I lived in\r\nservice when I was a boy, was a fine one,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, gayly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\r\nwas nothing to this! I wonder if Allan is as surprised and delighted as\r\nI am?\xe2\x80\x9d The beauty of the summer morning drew him out through the open\r\nhall door, as it had drawn his friend out before him. He ran briskly\r\ndown the steps, humming the burden of one of the old vagabond tunes\r\nwhich he had danced to long since in the old vagabond time. Even the\r\nmemories of his wretched childhood took their color, on that happy\r\nmorning, from the bright medium through which he looked back at them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I was not out of practice,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself, as he leaned\r\non the fence and looked over at the park, \xe2\x80\x9cI could try some of my old\r\ntumbling tricks on that delicious grass.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned, noticed two of the\r\nservants talking together near the shrubbery, and asked for news of the\r\nmaster of the house.\r\n\r\nThe men pointed with a smile in the direction of the gardens; Mr.\r\nArmadale had gone that way more than an hour since, and had met (as had\r\nbeen reported) with Miss Milroy in the grounds. Midwinter followed the\r\npath through the shrubbery, but, on reaching the flower garden, stopped,\r\nconsidered a little, and retraced his steps. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Allan has met with the\r\nyoung lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAllan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want me.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed as\r\nhe drew that inevitable inference, and turned considerately to explore\r\nthe beauties of Thorpe Ambrose on the other side of the house.\r\n\r\nPassing the angle of the front wall of the building, he descended some\r\nsteps, advanced along a paved walk, turned another angle, and found\r\nhimself in a strip of garden ground at the back of the house.\r\n\r\nBehind him was a row of small rooms situated on the level of the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 offices. In front of him, on the further side of the little\r\ngarden, rose a wall, screened by a laurel hedge, and having a door at\r\none end of it, leading past the stables to a gate that opened on the\r\nhigh-road. Perceiving that he had only discovered thus far the shorter\r\nway to the house, used by the servants and trades-people, Midwinter\r\nturned back again, and looked in at the window of one of the rooms on\r\nthe basement story as he passed it. Were these the servants\xe2\x80\x99 offices?\r\nNo; the offices were apparently in some other part of the ground-floor;\r\nthe window he had looked in at was the window of a lumber-room. The\r\nnext two rooms in the row were both empty. The fourth window, when he\r\napproached it, presented a little variety. It served also as a door; and\r\nit stood open to the garden at that moment.\r\n\r\nAttracted by the book-shelves which he noticed on one of the walls,\r\nMidwinter stepped into the room.\r\n\r\nThe books, few in number, did not detain him long; a glance at their\r\nbacks was enough without taking them down. The Waverley Novels, Tales\r\nby Miss Edgeworth, and by Miss Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s many followers, the Poems of\r\nMrs. Hemans, with a few odd volumes of the illustrated gift-books of\r\nthe period, composed the bulk of the little library. Midwinter turned to\r\nleave the room, when an object on one side of the window, which he had\r\nnot previously noticed, caught his attention and stopped him. It was a\r\nstatuette standing on a bracket--a reduced copy of the famous Niobe of\r\nthe Florence Museum. He glanced from the statuette to the window, with a\r\nsudden doubt which set his heart throbbing fast. It was a French window.\r\nHe looked out with a suspicion which he had not felt yet. The view\r\nbefore him was the view of a lawn and garden. For a moment his mind\r\nstruggled blindly to escape the conclusion which had seized it, and\r\nstruggled in vain. Here, close round him and close before him--here,\r\nforcing him mercilessly back from the happy present to the horrible\r\npast, was the room that Allan had seen in the Second Vision of the\r\nDream.\r\n\r\nHe waited, thinking and looking round him while he thought. There\r\nwas wonderfully little disturbance in his face and manner; he looked\r\nsteadily from one to the other of the few objects in the room, as if the\r\ndiscovery of it had saddened rather than surprised him. Matting of\r\nsome foreign sort covered the floor. Two cane chairs and a plain table\r\ncomprised the whole of the furniture. The walls were plainly papered,\r\nand bare--broken to the eye in one place by a door leading into the\r\ninterior of the house; in another, by a small stove; in a third, by the\r\nbook-shelves which Midwinter had already noticed. He returned to the\r\nbooks, and this time he took some of them down from the shelves.\r\n\r\nThe first that he opened contained lines in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting,\r\ntraced in ink that had faded with time. He read the inscription--\xe2\x80\x9cJane\r\nArmadale, from her beloved father. Thorpe Ambrose, October, 1828.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n In the second, third, and fourth volumes that he opened, the same\r\ninscription re-appeared. His previous knowledge of dates and persons\r\nhelped him to draw the true inference from what he saw. The books must\r\nhave belonged to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mother; and she must have inscribed them with\r\nher name, in the interval of time between her return to Thorpe Ambrose\r\nfrom Madeira and the birth of her son. Midwinter passed on to a volume\r\non another shelf--one of a series containing the writings of Mrs.\r\nHemans. In this case, the blank leaf at the beginning of the book was\r\nfilled on both sides with a copy of verses, the writing being still\r\nin Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s hand. The verses were headed \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell to Thorpe\r\nAmbrose,\xe2\x80\x9d and were dated \xe2\x80\x9cMarch, 1829\xe2\x80\x9d--two months only after Allan had\r\nbeen born.\r\n\r\nEntirely without merit in itself, the only interest of the little poem\r\nwas in the domestic story that it told.\r\n\r\nThe very room in which Midwinter then stood was described--with the\r\nview on the garden, the window made to open on it, the bookshelves, the\r\nNiobe, and other more perishable ornaments which Time had destroyed.\r\nHere, at variance with her brothers, shrinking from her friends, the\r\nwidow of the murdered man had, on her own acknowledgment, secluded\r\nherself, without other comfort than the love and forgiveness of her\r\nfather, until her child was born. The father\xe2\x80\x99s mercy and the father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrecent death filled many verses, happily too vague in their commonplace\r\nexpression of penitence and despair to give any hint of the marriage\r\nstory in Madeira to any reader who looked at them ignorant of the truth.\r\nA passing reference to the writer\xe2\x80\x99s estrangement from her surviving\r\nrelatives, and to her approaching departure from Thorpe Ambrose,\r\nfollowed. Last came the assertion of the mother\xe2\x80\x99s resolution to separate\r\nherself from all her old associations; to leave behind her every\r\npossession, even to the most trifling thing she had, that could remind\r\nher of the miserable past; and to date her new life in the future from\r\nthe birthday of the child who had been spared to console her--who was\r\nnow the one earthly object that could still speak to her of love and\r\nhope. So the old story of passionate feeling that finds comfort in\r\nphrases rather than not find comfort at all was told once again. So the\r\npoem in the faded ink faded away to its end.\r\n\r\nMidwinter put the book back with a heavy sigh, and opened no other\r\nvolume on the shelves. \xe2\x80\x9cHere in the country house, or there on board the\r\nwreck,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe traces of my father\xe2\x80\x99s crime follow me,\r\ngo where I may.\xe2\x80\x9d He advanced toward the window, stopped, and looked back\r\ninto the lonely, neglected little room. \xe2\x80\x9cIs _this_ chance?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cThe place where his mother suffered is the place he sees in\r\nthe Dream; and the first morning in the new house is the morning that\r\nreveals it, not to _him_, but to me. Oh, Allan! Allan! how will it end?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thought had barely passed through his mind before he heard Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice, from the paved walk at the side of the house, calling to him by\r\nhis name. He hastily stepped out into the garden. At the same moment\r\nAllan came running round the corner, full of voluble apologies for\r\nhaving forgotten, in the society of his new neighbors, what was due to\r\nthe laws of hospitality and the claims of his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really haven\xe2\x80\x99t missed you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter; \xe2\x80\x9cand I am very, very glad\r\nto hear that the new neighbors have produced such a pleasant impression\r\non you already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried, as he spoke, to lead the way back by the outside of the house;\r\nbut Allan\xe2\x80\x99s flighty attention had been caught by the open window and the\r\nlonely little room. He stepped in immediately. Midwinter followed, and\r\nwatched him in breathless anxiety as he looked round. Not the slightest\r\nrecollection of the Dream troubled Allan\xe2\x80\x99s easy mind. Not the slightest\r\nreference to it fell from the silent lips of his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly the sort of place I should have expected you to hit on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n exclaimed Allan, gayly. \xe2\x80\x9cSmall and snug and unpretending. I know you,\r\nMaster Midwinter! You\xe2\x80\x99ll be slipping off here when the county families\r\ncome visiting, and I rather think on those dreadful occasions you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind me far behind you. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? You look ill and out of\r\nspirits. Hungry? Of course you are! unpardonable of me to have kept you\r\nwaiting. This door leads somewhere, I suppose; let\xe2\x80\x99s try a short\r\ncut into the house. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of my not keeping you company at\r\nbreakfast. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat much at the cottage; I feasted my eyes on Miss\r\nMilroy, as the poets say. Oh, the darling! the darling! she turns you\r\ntopsy-turvy the moment you look at her. As for her father, wait till\r\nyou see his wonderful clock! It\xe2\x80\x99s twice the size of the famous clock at\r\nStrasbourg, and the most tremendous striker ever heard yet in the memory\r\nof man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSinging the praises of his new friends in this strain at the top of his\r\nvoice, Allan hurried Midwinter along the stone passages on the\r\nbasement floor, which led, as he had rightly guessed, to a staircase\r\ncommunicating with the hall. They passed the servants\xe2\x80\x99 offices on the\r\nway. At the sight of the cook and the roaring fire, disclosed through\r\nthe open kitchen door, Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mind went off at a tangent, and Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndignity scattered itself to the four winds of heaven, as usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha, Mrs. Gripper, there you are with your pots and pans, and your\r\nburning fiery furnace! One had need be Shadrach, Meshach, and the other\r\nfellow to stand over that. Breakfast as soon as ever you like. Eggs,\r\nsausages, bacon, kidneys, marmalade, water-cresses, coffee, and so\r\nforth. My friend and I belong to the select few whom it\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect\r\nprivilege to cook for. Voluptuaries, Mrs. Gripper, voluptuaries, both of\r\nus. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Allan, as they went on toward the stairs, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall make that worthy creature young again; I\xe2\x80\x99m better than a doctor\r\nfor Mrs. Gripper. When she laughs, she shakes her fat sides, and when\r\nshe shakes her fat sides, she exerts her muscular system; and when\r\nshe exerts her muscular system--Ha! here\xe2\x80\x99s Susan again. Don\xe2\x80\x99t squeeze\r\nyourself flat against the banisters, my dear; if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind hustling\r\n_me_ on the stairs, I rather like hustling _you_. She looks like a\r\nfull-blown rose when she blushes, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she? Stop, Susan! I\xe2\x80\x99ve orders\r\nto give. Be very particular with Mr. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s room: shake up his bed\r\nlike mad, and dust his furniture till those nice round arms of yours\r\nache again. Nonsense, my dear fellow! I\xe2\x80\x99m not too familiar with them;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m only keeping them up to their work. Now, then, Richard! where do we\r\nbreakfast? Oh, here. Between ourselves, Midwinter, these splendid rooms\r\nof mine are a size too large for me; I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as if I should ever\r\nbe on intimate terms with my own furniture. My views in life are of the\r\nsnug and slovenly sort--a kitchen chair, you know, and a low ceiling.\r\nMan wants but little here below, and wants that little long. That\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nexactly the right quotation; but it expresses my meaning, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let\r\nalone correcting it till the next opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Midwinter, \xe2\x80\x9chere is something waiting\r\nfor you which you have not noticed yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he pointed a little impatiently to a letter lying on the\r\nbreakfast-table. He could conceal the ominous discovery which he had\r\nmade that morning, from Allan\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge; but he could not conquer\r\nthe latent distrust of circumstances which was now raised again in\r\nhis superstitious nature--the instinctive suspicion of everything that\r\nhappened, no matter how common or how trifling the event, on the first\r\nmemorable day when the new life began in the new house.\r\n\r\nAllan ran his eye over the letter, and tossed it across the table to his\r\nfriend. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make head or tail of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ccan you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter read the letter, slowly, aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cSir--I trust you will pardon\r\nthe liberty I take in sending these few lines to wait your arrival at\r\nThorpe Ambrose. In the event of circumstances not disposing you to place\r\nyour law business in the hands of Mr. Darch--\xe2\x80\x9d He suddenly stopped at\r\nthat point, and considered a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarch is our friend the lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, supposing Midwinter had\r\nforgotten the name. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember our spinning the half-crown on\r\nthe cabin table, when I got the two offers for the cottage? Heads, the\r\nmajor; tails, the lawyer. This is the lawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout making any reply, Midwinter resumed reading the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the\r\nevent of circumstances not disposing you to place your law business\r\nin the hands of Mr. Darch, I beg to say that I shall be happy to take\r\ncharge of your interests, if you feel willing to honor me with your\r\nconfidence. Inclosing a reference (should you desire it) to my agents in\r\nLondon, and again apologizing for this intrusion, I beg to remain, sir,\r\nrespectfully yours, A. PEDGIFT, Sen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCircumstances?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Midwinter, as he laid the letter down. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ncircumstances can possibly indispose you to give your law business to\r\nMr. Darch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing can indispose me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides being the family lawyer\r\nhere, Darch was the first to write me word at Paris of my coming in for\r\nmy fortune; and, if I have got any business to give, of course he ought\r\nto have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter still looked distrustfully at the open letter on the table.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sadly afraid, Allan, there is something wrong already,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis man would never have ventured on the application he has made to\r\nyou, unless he had some good reason for believing he would succeed. If\r\nyou wish to put yourself right at starting, you will send to Mr. Darch\r\nthis morning to tell him you are here, and you will take no notice for\r\nthe present of Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore more could be said on either side, the footman made his\r\nappearance with the breakfast tray. He was followed, after an interval,\r\nby the butler, a man of the essentially confidential kind, with a\r\nmodulated voice, a courtly manner, and a bulbous nose. Anybody but Allan\r\nwould have seen in his face that he had come into the room having a\r\nspecial communication to make to his master. Allan, who saw nothing\r\nunder the surface, and whose head was running on the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s letter,\r\nstopped him bluntly with the point-blank question: \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Pedgift?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe butler\xe2\x80\x99s sources of local knowledge opened confidentially on the\r\ninstant. Mr. Pedgift was the second of the two lawyers in the town. Not\r\nso long established, not so wealthy, not so universally looked up to\r\nas old Mr. Darch. Not doing the business of the highest people in the\r\ncounty, and not mixing freely with the best society, like old Mr. Darch.\r\nA very sufficient man, in his way, nevertheless. Known as a perfectly\r\ncompetent and respectable practitioner all round the neighborhood. In\r\nshort, professionally next best to Mr. Darch; and personally superior to\r\nhim (if the expression might be permitted) in this respect--that Darch\r\nwas a Crusty One, and Pedgift wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nHaving imparted this information, the butler, taking a wise advantage\r\nof his position, glided, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s stoppage, from Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter to the business that had brought him into the breakfast-room.\r\nThe Midsummer Audit was near at hand; and the tenants were accustomed\r\nto have a week\xe2\x80\x99s notice of the rent-day dinner. With this necessity\r\npressing, and with no orders given as yet, and no steward in office\r\nat Thorpe Ambrose, it appeared desirable that some confidential person\r\nshould bring the matter forward. The butler was that confidential\r\nperson; and he now ventured accordingly to trouble his master on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAt this point Allan opened his lips to interrupt, and was himself\r\ninterrupted before he could utter a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Midwinter, seeing in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s face that he was in\r\ndanger of being publicly announced in the capacity of steward. \xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he repeated, eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9ctill I can speak to you first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe butler\xe2\x80\x99s courtly manner remained alike unruffled by Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsudden interference and by his own dismissal from the scene. Nothing but\r\nthe mounting color in his bulbous nose betrayed the sense of injury\r\nthat animated him as he withdrew. Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s chance of regaling his\r\nfriend and himself that day with the best wine in the cellar trembled in\r\nthe balance, as the butler took his way back to the basement story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is beyond a joke, Allan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, when they were alone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody must meet your tenants on the rent-day who is really fit to\r\ntake the steward\xe2\x80\x99s place. With the best will in the world to learn, it\r\nis impossible for _me_ to master the business at a week\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Don\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\npray don\xe2\x80\x99t let your anxiety for my welfare put you in a false position\r\nwith other people! I should never forgive myself if I was the unlucky\r\ncause--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently gently!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, amazed at his friend\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary\r\nearnestness. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I write to London by to-night\xe2\x80\x99s post for the man who\r\ncame down here before, will that satisfy you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cOur time is short,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand the man may\r\nnot be at liberty. Why not try in the neighborhood first? You were going\r\nto write to Mr. Darch. Send at once, and see if he can\xe2\x80\x99t help us between\r\nthis and post-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan withdrew to a side-table on which writing materials were placed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall breakfast in peace, you old fidget,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, and\r\naddressed himself forthwith to Mr. Darch, with his usual Spartan brevity\r\nof epistolary expression. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Sir--Here I am, bag and baggage. Will\r\nyou kindly oblige me by being my lawyer? I ask this, because I want to\r\nconsult you at once. Please look in in the course of the day, and stop\r\nto dinner if you possibly can. Yours truly. ALLAN ARMADALE.\xe2\x80\x9d Having read\r\nthis composition aloud with unconcealed admiration of his own rapidity\r\nof literary execution, Allan addressed the letter to Mr. Darch, and rang\r\nthe bell. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Richard, take this at once, and wait for an answer.\r\nAnd, I say, if there\xe2\x80\x99s any news stirring in the town, pick it up and\r\nbring it back with you. See how I manage my servants!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Allan,\r\njoining his friend at the breakfast-table. \xe2\x80\x9cSee how I adapt myself to my\r\nnew duties! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been down here one clear day yet, and I\xe2\x80\x99m taking\r\nan interest in the neighborhood already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, the two friends went out to idle away the morning under\r\nthe shade of a tree in the park. Noon came, and Richard never appeared.\r\nOne o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck, and still there were no signs of an answer from Mr.\r\nDarch. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s patience was not proof against the delay. He left\r\nAllan dozing on the grass, and went to the house to make inquiries. The\r\ntown was described as little more than two miles distant; but the day\r\nof the week happened to be market day, and Richard was being detained\r\nno doubt by some of the many acquaintances whom he would be sure to meet\r\nwith on that occasion.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the truant messenger returned, and was sent out to\r\nreport himself to his master under the tree in the park.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny answer from Mr. Darch?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Midwinter, seeing that Allan was too\r\nlazy to put the question for himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Darch was engaged, sir. I was desired to say that he would send an\r\nanswer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny news in the town?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Allan, drowsily, without troubling\r\nhimself to open his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; nothing in particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObserving the man suspiciously as he made that reply, Midwinter\r\ndetected in his face that he was not speaking the truth. He was plainly\r\nembarrassed, and plainly relieved when his master\xe2\x80\x99s silence allowed\r\nhim to withdraw. After a little consideration, Midwinter followed, and\r\novertook the retreating servant on the drive before the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cif I was to guess that there _is_ some\r\nnews in the town, and that you don\xe2\x80\x99t like telling it to your master,\r\nshould I be guessing the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man started and changed color. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you have found it\r\nout,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t deny you have guessed right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you let me hear what the news is, I will take the responsibility on\r\nmyself of telling Mr. Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter some little hesitation, and some distrustful consideration, on\r\nhis side, of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s face, Richard at last prevailed on himself to\r\nrepeat what he had heard that day in the town.\r\n\r\nThe news of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s sudden appearance at Thorpe Ambrose had preceded the\r\nservant\xe2\x80\x99s arrival at his destination by some hours. Wherever he went,\r\nhe found his master the subject of public discussion. The opinion of\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s conduct among the leading townspeople, the resident gentry\r\nof the neighborhood, and the principal tenants on the estate was\r\nunanimously unfavorable. Only the day before, the committee for managing\r\nthe public reception of the new squire had sketched the progress of the\r\nprocession; had settled the serious question of the triumphal arches;\r\nand had appointed a competent person to solicit subscriptions for the\r\nflags, the flowers, the feasting, the fireworks, and the band. In less\r\nthan a week more the money could have been collected, and the rector\r\nwould have written to Mr. Armadale to fix the day. And now, by Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown act, the public welcome waiting to honor him had been cast back\r\ncontemptuously in the public teeth! Everybody took for granted (what\r\nwas unfortunately true) that he had received private information of\r\nthe contemplated proceedings. Everybody declared that he had purposely\r\nstolen into his own house like a thief in the night (so the phrase ran)\r\nto escape accepting the offered civilities of his neighbors. In brief,\r\nthe sensitive self-importance of the little town was wounded to the\r\nquick, and of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s once enviable position in the estimation of the\r\nneighborhood not a vestige remained.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Midwinter faced the messenger of evil tidings in silent\r\ndistress. That moment past, the sense of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s critical position\r\nroused him, now the evil was known, to seek the remedy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the little you have seen of your master, Richard, inclined you to\r\nlike him?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThis time the man answered without hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cA pleasanter and kinder\r\ngentleman than Mr. Armadale no one could wish to serve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you think that,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Midwinter, \xe2\x80\x9cyou won\xe2\x80\x99t object to give me\r\nsome information which will help your master to set himself right with\r\nhis neighbors. Come into the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led the way into the library, and, after asking the necessary\r\nquestions, took down in writing a list of the names and addresses of the\r\nmost influential persons living in the town and its neighborhood. This\r\ndone, he rang the bell for the head footman, having previously sent\r\nRichard with a message to the stables directing an open carriage to be\r\nready in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the late Mr. Blanchard went out to make calls in the neighborhood,\r\nit was your place to go with him, was it not?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, when the upper\r\nservant appeared. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Be ready in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time, if you please,\r\nto go out with Mr. Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d Having given that order, he left the house\r\nagain on his way back to Allan, with the visiting list in his hand.\r\nHe smiled a little sadly as he descended the steps. \xe2\x80\x9cWho would have\r\nimagined,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my foot-boy\xe2\x80\x99s experience of the ways of\r\ngentlefolks would be worth looking back at one day for Allan\xe2\x80\x99s sake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe object of the popular odium lay innocently slumbering on the grass,\r\nwith his garden hat over his nose, his waistcoat unbuttoned, and his\r\ntrousers wrinkled half way up his outstretched legs. Midwinter roused\r\nhim without hesitation, and remorselessly repeated the servant\xe2\x80\x99s news.\r\n\r\nAllan accepted the disclosure thus forced on him without the slightest\r\ndisturbance of temper. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, hang \xe2\x80\x98em!\xe2\x80\x9d was all he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have\r\nanother cigar.\xe2\x80\x9d Midwinter took the cigar out of his hand, and, insisting\r\non his treating the matter seriously, told him in plain words that he\r\nmust set himself right with his offended neighbors by calling on\r\nthem personally to make his apologies. Allan sat up on the grass in\r\nastonishment; his eyes opened wide in incredulous dismay. Did Midwinter\r\npositively meditate forcing him into a \xe2\x80\x9cchimney-pot hat,\xe2\x80\x9d a nicely\r\nbrushed frock-coat, and a clean pair of gloves? Was it actually in\r\ncontemplation to shut him up in a carriage, with his footman on the box\r\nand his card-case in his hand, and send him round from house to house,\r\nto tell a pack of fools that he begged their pardon for not letting them\r\nmake a public show of him? If anything so outrageously absurd as this\r\nwas really to be done, it could not be done that day, at any rate. He\r\nhad promised to go back to the charming Milroy at the cottage and to\r\ntake Midwinter with him. What earthly need had he of the good opinion of\r\nthe resident gentry? The only friends he wanted were the friends he\r\nhad got already. Let the whole neighborhood turn its back on him if it\r\nliked; back or face, the Squire of Thorpe Ambrose didn\xe2\x80\x99t care two straws\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nAfter allowing him to run on in this way until his whole stock of\r\nobjections was exhausted, Midwinter wisely tried his personal influence\r\nnext. He took Allan affectionately by the hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to ask a\r\ngreat favor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you won\xe2\x80\x99t call on these people for your own\r\nsake, will you call on them to please _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan delivered himself of a groan of despair, stared in mute surprise\r\nat the anxious face of his friend, and good-humoredly gave way. As\r\nMidwinter took his arm, and led him back to the house, he looked round\r\nwith rueful eyes at the cattle hard by, placidly whisking their tails in\r\nthe pleasant shade. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mention it in the neighborhood,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould like to change places with one of my own cows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter left him to dress, engaging to return when the carriage was at\r\nthe door. Allan\xe2\x80\x99s toilet did not promise to be a speedy one. He began it\r\nby reading his own visiting cards; and he advanced it a second stage\r\nby looking into his wardrobe, and devoting the resident gentry to the\r\ninfernal regions. Before he could discover any third means of delaying\r\nhis own proceedings, the necessary pretext was unexpectedly supplied\r\nby Richard\xe2\x80\x99s appearance with a note in his hand. The messenger had just\r\ncalled with Mr. Darch\xe2\x80\x99s answer. Allan briskly shut up the wardrobe, and\r\ngave his whole attention to the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s letter. The lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nrewarded him by the following lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSIR--I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of to-day\xe2\x80\x99s date,\r\nhonoring me with two proposals; namely, ONE inviting me to act as your\r\nlegal adviser, and ONE inviting me to pay you a visit at your house.\r\nIn reference to the first proposal, I beg permission to decline it with\r\nthanks. With regard to the second proposal, I have to inform you that\r\ncircumstances have come to my knowledge relating to the letting of the\r\ncottage at Thorpe Ambrose which render it impossible for me (in justice\r\nto myself) to accept your invitation. I have ascertained, sir, that my\r\noffer reached you at the same time as Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s; and that, with\r\nboth proposals thus before you, you gave the preference to a total\r\nstranger, who addressed you through a house agent, over a man who had\r\nfaithfully served your relatives for two generations, and who had been\r\nthe first person to inform you of the most important event in your life.\r\nAfter this specimen of your estimate of what is due to the claims of\r\ncommon courtesy and common justice, I cannot flatter myself that I\r\npossess any of the qualities which would fit me to take my place on the\r\nlist of your friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remain, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJAMES DARCH.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop the messenger!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, leaping to his feet, his ruddy face\r\naflame with indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me pen, ink, and paper! By the\r\nLord Harry, they\xe2\x80\x99re a nice set of people in these parts; the whole\r\nneighborhood is in a conspiracy to bully me!\xe2\x80\x9d He snatched up the pen in\r\na fine frenzy of epistolary inspiration. \xe2\x80\x9cSir--I despise you and your\r\nletter.--\xe2\x80\x9d At that point the pen made a blot, and the writer was seized\r\nwith a momentary hesitation. \xe2\x80\x9cToo strong,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to\r\nthe lawyer in his own cool and cutting style.\xe2\x80\x9d He began again on a clean\r\nsheet of paper. \xe2\x80\x9cSir--You remind me of an Irish bull. I mean that story\r\nin \xe2\x80\x98Joe Miller\xe2\x80\x99 where Pat remarked, in the hearing of a wag hard by,\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x98the reciprocity was all on one side.\xe2\x80\x99 _Your_ reciprocity is all on\r\none side. You take the privilege of refusing to be my lawyer, and\r\nthen you complain of my taking the privilege of refusing to be your\r\nlandlord.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused fondly over those last words. \xe2\x80\x9cNeat!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArgument and hard hitting both in one. I wonder where my knack of\r\nwriting comes from?\xe2\x80\x9d He went on, and finished the letter in two more\r\nsentences. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for your casting my invitation back in my teeth, I beg to\r\ninform you my teeth are none the worse for it. I am equally glad to\r\nhave nothing to say to you, either in the capacity of a friend or a\r\ntenant.--ALLAN ARMADALE.\xe2\x80\x9d He nodded exultantly at his own composition,\r\nas he addressed it and sent it down to the messenger. \xe2\x80\x9cDarch\xe2\x80\x99s hide must\r\nbe a thick one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel _that_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound of the wheels outside suddenly recalled him to the business\r\nof the day. There was the carriage waiting to take him on his round of\r\nvisits; and there was Midwinter at his post, pacing to and fro on the\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead that,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, throwing out the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s letter; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nwritten him back a smasher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bustled away to the wardrobe to get his coat. There was a wonderful\r\nchange in him; he felt little or no reluctance to pay the visits now.\r\nThe pleasurable excitement of answering Mr. Darth had put him in a fine\r\naggressive frame of mind for asserting himself in the neighborhood.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever else they may say of me, they shan\xe2\x80\x99t say I was afraid to face\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d Heated red-hot with that idea, he seized his hat and gloves,\r\nand hurrying out of the room, met Midwinter in the corridor with the\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s letter in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep up your spirits!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, seeing the anxiety in his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, and misinterpreting the motive of it immediately. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Darch can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe counted on to send us a helping hand into the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office,\r\nPedgift can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Allan, I was not thinking of that; I was thinking of Mr.\r\nDarch\xe2\x80\x99s letter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t defend this sour-tempered man; but I am afraid\r\nwe must admit he has some cause for complaint. Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t give him\r\nanother chance of putting you in the wrong. Where is your answer to his\r\nletter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI always strike while the iron\xe2\x80\x99s hot--a word and\r\na blow, and the blow first, that\xe2\x80\x99s my way. Don\xe2\x80\x99t, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t fidget about the steward\xe2\x80\x99s books and the rent-day. Here! here\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbunch of keys they gave me last night: one of them opens the room where\r\nthe steward\xe2\x80\x99s books are; go in and read them till I come back. I give\r\nyou my sacred word of honor I\xe2\x80\x99ll settle it all with Pedgift before you\r\nsee me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Midwinter, stopping him resolutely on his way\r\nout to the carriage. \xe2\x80\x9cI say nothing against Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s fitness to\r\npossess your confidence, for I know nothing to justify me in distrusting\r\nhim. But he has not introduced himself to your notice in a very delicate\r\nway; and he has not acknowledged (what is quite clear to my mind) that\r\nhe knew of Mr. Darch\xe2\x80\x99s unfriendly feeling toward you when he wrote. Wait\r\na little before you go to this stranger; wait till we can talk it over\r\ntogether to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I told you that I always strike while\r\nthe iron\xe2\x80\x99s hot? Trust my eye for character, old boy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll look Pedgift\r\nthrough and through, and act accordingly. Don\xe2\x80\x99t keep me any longer, for\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake. I\xe2\x80\x99m in a fine humor for tackling the resident gentry; and\r\nif I don\xe2\x80\x99t go at once, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it may wear off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that excellent reason for being in a hurry, Allan boisterously\r\nbroke away. Before it was possible to stop him again, he had jumped into\r\nthe carriage and had left the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE MARCH OF EVENTS.\r\n\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s face darkened when the last trace of the carriage had\r\ndisappeared from view. \xe2\x80\x9cI have done my best,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he turned back\r\ngloomily into the house \xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Brock himself were here, Mr. Brock could\r\ndo no more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the bunch of keys which Allan had thrust into his hand,\r\nand a sudden longing to put himself to the test over the steward\xe2\x80\x99s books\r\ntook possession of his sensitive self-tormenting nature. Inquiring his\r\nway to the room in which the various movables of the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office\r\nhad been provisionally placed after the letting of the cottage, he sat\r\ndown at the desk, and tried how his own unaided capacity would guide him\r\nthrough the business records of the Thorpe Ambrose estate. The result\r\nexposed his own ignorance unanswerably before his own eyes. The ledgers\r\nbewildered him; the leases, the plans, and even the correspondence\r\nitself, might have been written, for all he could understand of them,\r\nin an unknown tongue. His memory reverted bitterly as he left the room\r\nagain to his two years\xe2\x80\x99 solitary self-instruction in the Shrewsbury\r\nbook-seller\xe2\x80\x99s shop. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only have worked at a business!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only have known that the company of poets and\r\nphilosophers was company too high for a vagabond like me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down alone in the great hall; the silence of it fell heavier and\r\nheavier on his sinking spirits; the beauty of it exasperated him, like\r\nan insult from a purse-proud man. \xe2\x80\x9cCurse the place!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, snatching\r\nup his hat and stick. \xe2\x80\x9cI like the bleakest hillside I ever slept on\r\nbetter than I like this house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe impatiently descended the door-steps, and stopped on the drive,\r\nconsidering, by which direction he should leave the park for the country\r\nbeyond. If he followed the road taken by the carriage, he might risk\r\nunsettling Allan by accidentally meeting him in the town. If he went\r\nout by the back gate, he knew his own nature well enough to doubt his\r\nability to pass the room of the dream without entering it again. But\r\none other way remained: the way which he had taken, and then abandoned\r\nagain, in the morning. There was no fear of disturbing Allan and the\r\nmajor\xe2\x80\x99s daughter now. Without further hesitation, Midwinter set forth\r\nthrough the gardens to explore the open country on that side of the\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nThrown off its balance by the events of the day, his mind was full\r\nof that sourly savage resistance to the inevitable self-assertion of\r\nwealth, so amiably deplored by the prosperous and the rich; so bitterly\r\nfamiliar to the unfortunate and the poor. \xe2\x80\x9cThe heather-bell costs\r\nnothing!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, looking contemptuously at the masses of rare and\r\nbeautiful flowers that surrounded him; \xe2\x80\x9cand the buttercups and daisies\r\nare as bright as the best of you!\xe2\x80\x9d He followed the artfully contrived\r\novals and squares of the Italian garden with a vagabond indifference to\r\nthe symmetry of their construction and the ingenuity of their design.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many pounds a foot did _you_ cost?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking back with\r\nscornful eyes at the last path as he left it. \xe2\x80\x9cWind away over high and\r\nlow like the sheep-walk on the mountain side, if you can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe entered the shrubbery which Allan had entered before him; crossed the\r\npaddock and the rustic bridge beyond; and reached the major\xe2\x80\x99s cottage.\r\nHis ready mind seized the right conclusion at the first sight of it; and\r\nhe stopped before the garden gate, to look at the trim little residence\r\nwhich would never have been empty, and would never have been let, but\r\nfor Allan\xe2\x80\x99s ill-advised resolution to force the steward\xe2\x80\x99s situation on\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\nThe summer afternoon was warm; the summer air was faint and still. On\r\nthe upper and the lower floor of the cottage the windows were all\r\nopen. From one of them, on the upper story, the sound of voices was\r\nstartlingly audible in the quiet of the park as Midwinter paused on the\r\nouter side of the garden inclosure. The voice of a woman, harsh, high,\r\nand angrily complaining--a voice with all the freshness and the\r\nmelody gone, and with nothing but the hard power of it left--was the\r\ndiscordantly predominant sound. With it, from moment to moment, there\r\nmingled the deeper and quieter tones, soothing and compassionate, of the\r\nvoice of a man. Although the distance was too great to allow Midwinter\r\nto distinguish the words that were spoken, he felt the impropriety of\r\nremaining within hearing of the voices, and at once stepped forward to\r\ncontinue his walk.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, the face of a young girl (easily recognizable as the\r\nface of Miss Milroy, from Allan\xe2\x80\x99s description of her) appeared at the\r\nopen window of the room. In spite of himself, Midwinter paused to look\r\nat her. The expression of the bright young face, which had smiled\r\nso prettily on Allan, was weary and disheartened. After looking out\r\nabsently over the park, she suddenly turned her head back into the room,\r\nher attention having been apparently struck by something that had just\r\nbeen said in it. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, mamma, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, indignantly, \xe2\x80\x9chow\r\n_can_ you say such things!\xe2\x80\x9d The words were spoken close to the window;\r\nthey reached Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s ears, and hurried him away before he heard\r\nmore. But the self-disclosure of Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s domestic position had\r\nnot reached its end yet. As Midwinter turned the corner of the garden\r\nfence, a tradesman\xe2\x80\x99s boy was handing a parcel in at the wicket gate\r\nto the woman servant. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, with the irrepressible\r\nimpudence of his class, \xe2\x80\x9chow is the missus?\xe2\x80\x9d The woman lifted her hand\r\nto box his ears. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is the missus?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, with an angry toss\r\nof her head, as the boy ran off. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it would only please God to take\r\nthe missus, it would be a blessing to everybody in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo such ill-omened shadow as this had passed over the bright domestic\r\npicture of the inhabitants of the cottage, which Allan\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm\r\nhad painted for the contemplation of his friend. It was plain that\r\nthe secret of the tenants had been kept from the landlord so far. Five\r\nminutes more of walking brought Midwinter to the park gates. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I fated\r\nto see nothing and hear nothing to-day, which can give me heart and hope\r\nfor the future?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, as he angrily swung back the lodge gate.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven the people Allan has let the cottage to are people whose lives\r\nare imbittered by a household misery which it is _my_ misfortune to have\r\nfound out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took the first road that lay before him, and walked on, noticing\r\nlittle, immersed in his own thoughts.\r\n\r\nMore than an hour passed before the necessity of turning back entered\r\nhis mind. As soon as the idea occurred to him, he consulted his watch,\r\nand determined to retrace his steps, so as to be at the house in good\r\ntime to meet Allan on his return. Ten minutes of walking brought him\r\nback to a point at which three roads met, and one moment\xe2\x80\x99s observation\r\nof the place satisfied him that he had entirely failed to notice at the\r\ntime by which of the three roads he had advanced. No sign-post was to\r\nbe seen; the country on either side was lonely and flat, intersected\r\nby broad drains and ditches. Cattle were grazing here and there, and a\r\nwindmill rose in the distance above the pollard willows that fringed the\r\nlow horizon. But not a house was to be seen, and not a human creature\r\nappeared on the visible perspective of any one of the three roads.\r\nMidwinter glanced back in the only direction left to look at--the\r\ndirection of the road along which he had just been walking. There, to\r\nhis relief, was the figure of a man, rapidly advancing toward him, of\r\nwhom he could ask his way.\r\n\r\nThe figure came on, clad from head to foot in dreary black--a moving\r\nblot on the brilliant white surface of the sun-brightened road. He was\r\na lean, elderly, miserably respectable man. He wore a poor old black\r\ndress-coat, and a cheap brown wig, which made no pretense of being his\r\nown natural hair. Short black trousers clung like attached old servants\r\nround his wizen legs; and rusty black gaiters hid all they could of his\r\nknobbed, ungainly feet. Black crape added its mite to the decayed and\r\ndingy wretchedness of his old beaver hat; black mohair in the obsolete\r\nform of a stock drearily encircled his neck and rose as high as his\r\nhaggard jaws. The one morsel of color he carried about him was a\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s bag of blue serge, as lean and limp as himself. The one\r\nattractive feature in his clean-shaven, weary old face was a neat set of\r\nteeth--teeth (as honest as his wig) which said plainly to all inquiring\r\neyes, \xe2\x80\x9cWe pass our nights on his looking-glass, and our days in his\r\nmouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the little blood in the man\xe2\x80\x99s body faintly reddened his fleshless\r\ncheeks as Midwinter advanced to meet him, and asked the way to\r\nThorpe Ambrose. His weak, watery eyes looked hither and thither in a\r\nbewilderment painful to see. If he had met with a lion instead of a man,\r\nand if the few words addressed to him had been words expressing a threat\r\ninstead of a question, he could hardly have looked more confused and\r\nalarmed than he looked now. For the first time in his life, Midwinter\r\nsaw his own shy uneasiness in the presence of strangers reflected, with\r\ntenfold intensity of nervous suffering, in the face of another man--and\r\nthat man old enough to be his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich do you please to mean, sir--the town or the house? I beg your\r\npardon for asking, but they both go by the same name in these parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a timid gentleness of tone, an ingratiatory smile, and an\r\nanxious courtesy of manner, all distressingly suggestive of his being\r\naccustomed to receive rough answers in exchange for his own politeness\r\nfrom the persons whom he habitually addressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not aware that both the house and the town went by the same\r\nname,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter; \xe2\x80\x9cI meant the house.\xe2\x80\x9d He instinctively conquered\r\nhis own shyness as he answered in those words, speaking with a\r\ncordiality of manner which was very rare with him in his intercourse\r\nwith strangers.\r\n\r\nThe man of miserable respectability seemed to feel the warm return of\r\nhis own politeness gratefully; he brightened and took a little courage.\r\nHis lean forefinger pointed eagerly to the right road. \xe2\x80\x9cThat way, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand when you come to two roads next, please take the left\r\none of the two. I am sorry I have business the other way, I mean in the\r\ntown. I should have been happy to go with you and show you. Fine summer\r\nweather, sir, for walking? You can\xe2\x80\x99t miss your way if you keep to the\r\nleft. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it! I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I have detained you, sir. I wish\r\nyou a pleasant walk back, and--good-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy the time he had made an end of speaking (under an impression\r\napparently that the more he talked the more polite he would be) he\r\nhad lost his courage again. He darted away down his own road, as\r\nif Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to thank him involved a series of trials too\r\nterrible to confront. In two minutes more, his black retreating figure\r\nhad lessened in the distance till it looked again, what it had once\r\nlooked already, a moving blot on the brilliant white surface of the\r\nsun-brightened road.\r\n\r\nThe man ran strangely in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts while he took his way back\r\nto the house. He was at a loss to account for it. It never occurred to\r\nhim that he might have been insensibly reminded of himself, when he saw\r\nthe plain traces of past misfortune and present nervous suffering in\r\nthe poor wretch\xe2\x80\x99s face. He blindly resented his own perverse interest in\r\nthis chance foot passenger on the high-road, as he had resented all else\r\nthat had happened to him since the beginning of the day. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I made\r\nanother unlucky discovery?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I see\r\nthis man again, I wonder? Who can he be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTime was to answer both those questions before many days more had passed\r\nover the inquirer\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllan had not returned when Midwinter reached the house. Nothing had\r\nhappened but the arrival of a message of apology from the cottage.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s compliments, and he was sorry that Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s illness\r\nwould prevent his receiving Mr. Armadale that day.\xe2\x80\x9d It was plain that\r\nMrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s occasional fits of suffering (or of ill temper) created\r\nno mere transitory disturbance of the tranquillity of the household.\r\nDrawing this natural inference, after what he had himself heard at the\r\ncottage nearly three hours since, Midwinter withdrew into the library to\r\nwait patiently among the books until his friend came back.\r\n\r\nIt was past six o\xe2\x80\x99clock when the well-known hearty voice was heard again\r\nin the hall. Allan burst into the library, in a state of irrepressible\r\nexcitement, and pushed Midwinter back unceremoniously into the chair\r\nfrom which he was just rising, before he could utter a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a riddle for you, old boy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy am I like the\r\nresident manager of the Augean stable, before Hercules was called in to\r\nsweep the litter out? Because I have had my place to keep up, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngone and made an infernal mess of it! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you laugh? By George,\r\nhe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see the point! Let\xe2\x80\x99s try again. Why am I like the resident\r\nmanager--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Allan, be serious for a moment!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Midwinter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how anxious I am to hear if you have recovered the good\r\nopinion of your neighbors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what the riddle was intended to tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Allan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you will have it in so many words, my own impression is that you\r\nwould have done better not to disturb me under that tree in the park.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been calculating it to a nicety, and I beg to inform you that I\r\nhave sunk exactly three degrees lower in the estimation of the resident\r\ngentry since I had the pleasure of seeing you last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _will_ have your joke out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t laugh, I can wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, I\xe2\x80\x99m not joking; I really mean what I say. You shall\r\nhear what happened; you shall have a report in full of my first visit.\r\nIt will do, I can promise you, as a sample for all the rest. Mind this,\r\nin the first place, I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone wrong with the best possible intentions.\r\nWhen I started for these visits, I own I was angry with that old brute\r\nof a lawyer, and I certainly had a notion of carrying things with a high\r\nhand. But it wore off somehow on the road; and the first family I called\r\non, I went in, as I tell you, with the best possible intentions. Oh,\r\ndear, dear! there was the same spick-and-span reception-room for me to\r\nwait in, with the neat conservatory beyond, which I saw again and again\r\nand again at every other house I went to afterward. There was the same\r\nchoice selection of books for me to look at--a religious book, a book\r\nabout the Duke of Wellington, a book about sporting, and a book about\r\nnothing in particular, beautifully illustrated with pictures. Down came\r\npapa with his nice white hair, and mamma with her nice lace cap; down\r\ncame young mister with the pink face and straw-colored whiskers, and\r\nyoung miss with the plump cheeks and the large petticoats. Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\r\nthere was the least unfriendliness on my side; I always began with them\r\nin the same way--I insisted on shaking hands all round. That staggered\r\nthem to begin with. When I came to the sore subject next--the subject\r\nof the public reception--I give you my word of honor I took the greatest\r\npossible pains with my apologies. It hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the slightest effect; they\r\nlet my apologies in at one ear and out at the other, and then waited to\r\nhear more. Some men would have been disheartened: I tried another way\r\nwith them; I addressed myself to the master of the house, and put\r\nit pleasantly next. \xe2\x80\x98The fact is,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98I wanted to escape the\r\nspeechifying--my getting up, you know, and telling you to your face\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re the best of men, and I beg to propose your health; and your\r\ngetting up and telling me to my face I\xe2\x80\x99m the best of men, and you beg\r\nto thank me; and so on, man after man, praising each other and pestering\r\neach other all round the table.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s how I put it, in an easy,\r\nlight-handed, convincing sort of way. Do you think any of them took it\r\nin the same friendly spirit? Not one! It\xe2\x80\x99s my belief they had got their\r\nspeeches ready for the reception, with the flags and the flowers, and\r\nthat they\xe2\x80\x99re secretly angry with me for stopping their open mouths just\r\nas they were ready to begin. Anyway, whenever we came to the matter of\r\nthe speechifying (whether they touched it first or I), down I fell in\r\ntheir estimation the first of those three steps I told you of just\r\nnow. Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I made no efforts to get up again! I made desperate\r\nefforts. I found they were all anxious to know what sort of life I had\r\nled before I came in for the Thorpe Ambrose property, and I did my best\r\nto satisfy them. And what came of that, do you think? Hang me, if I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint them for the second time! When they found out that I\r\nhad actually never been to Eton or Harrow, or Oxford or Cambridge, they\r\nwere quite dumb with astonishment. I fancy they thought me a sort of\r\noutlaw. At any rate, they all froze up again; and down I fell the second\r\nstep in their estimation. Never mind! I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be beaten; I had\r\npromised you to do my best, and I did it. I tried cheerful small-talk\r\nabout the neighborhood next. The women said nothing in particular; the\r\nmen, to my unutterable astonishment, all began to condole with me. I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to find a pack of hounds, they said, within twenty\r\nmiles of my house; and they thought it only right to prepare me for the\r\ndisgracefully careless manner in which the Thorpe Ambrose covers had\r\nbeen preserved. I let them go on condoling with me, and then what do you\r\nthink I did? I put my foot in it again. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t take that to heart!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI said; \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care two straws about hunting or shooting, either. When\r\nI meet with a bird in my walk, I can\xe2\x80\x99t for the life of me feel eager\r\nto kill it; I rather like to see the bird flying about and enjoying\r\nitself.\xe2\x80\x99 You should have seen their faces! They had thought me a sort of\r\noutlaw before; now they evidently thought me mad. Dead silence fell upon\r\nthem all; and down I tumbled the third step in the general estimation.\r\nIt was just the same at the next house, and the next and the next. The\r\ndevil possessed us all, I think. It _would_ come out, now in one way,\r\nand now in another, that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make speeches--that I had been\r\nbrought up without a university education--and that I could enjoy a ride\r\non horseback without galloping after a wretched stinking fox or a poor\r\ndistracted little hare. These three unlucky defects of mine are not\r\nexcused, it seems, in a country gentleman (especially when he has dodged\r\na public reception to begin with). I think I got on best, upon the\r\nwhole, with the wives and daughters. The women and I always fell, sooner\r\nor later, on the subject of Mrs. Blanchard and her niece. We invariably\r\nagreed that they had done wisely in going to Florence; and the only\r\nreason we had to give for our opinion was that we thought their minds\r\nwould be benefited after their sad bereavement, by the contemplation\r\nof the masterpieces of Italian art. Every one of the ladies--I solemnly\r\ndeclare it--at every house I went to, came sooner or later to Mrs. and\r\nMiss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s bereavement and the masterpieces of Italian art. What\r\nwe should have done without that bright idea to help us, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. The one pleasant thing at any of the visits was when we all shook\r\nour heads together, and declared that the masterpieces would console\r\nthem. As for the rest of it, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing more to be said.\r\nWhat I might be in other places I don\xe2\x80\x99t know: I\xe2\x80\x99m the wrong man in the\r\nwrong place here. Let me muddle on for the future in my own way, with my\r\nown few friends; and ask me anything else in the world, as long as you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to make any more calls on my neighbors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that characteristic request, Allan\xe2\x80\x99s report of his exploring\r\nexpedition among the resident gentry came to a close. For a moment\r\nMidwinter remained silent. He had allowed Allan to run on from first to\r\nlast without uttering a word on his side. The disastrous result of\r\nthe visits--coming after what had happened earlier in the day; and\r\nthreatening Allan, as it did, with exclusion from all local sympathies\r\nat the very outset of his local career--had broken down Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npower of resisting the stealthily depressing influence of his own\r\nsuperstition. It was with an effort that he now looked up at Allan; it\r\nwas with an effort that he roused himself to answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be as you wish,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for what has\r\nhappened; but I am not the less obliged to you, Allan, for having done\r\nwhat I asked you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis head sank on his breast, and the fatalist resignation which had\r\nonce already quieted him on board the wreck now quieted him again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\n_must_ be, _will_ be,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought once more. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I to do with the\r\nfuture, and what has he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer up!\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9c_Your_ affairs are in a thriving condition, at\r\nany rate. I paid one pleasant visit in the town, which I haven\xe2\x80\x99t told\r\nyou of yet. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Pedgift, and Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s son, who helps him in the\r\noffice. They\xe2\x80\x99re the two jolliest lawyers I ever met with in my life;\r\nand, what\xe2\x80\x99s more, they can produce the very man you want to teach you\r\nthe steward\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter looked up quickly. Distrust of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s discovery was plainly\r\nwritten in his face already; but he said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Allan proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as the two Pedgifts and I\r\nhad had a glass of wine all round to drink to our friendly connection.\r\nThe finest sherry I ever tasted in my life; I\xe2\x80\x99ve ordered some of the\r\nsame--but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the question just now. In two words I told\r\nthese worthy fellows your difficulty, and in two seconds old Pedgift\r\nunderstood all about it. \xe2\x80\x98I have got the man in my office,\xe2\x80\x99 he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and before the audit-day comes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll place him with the greatest\r\npleasure at your friend\xe2\x80\x99s disposal.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this last announcement, Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s distrust found its expression in\r\nwords. He questioned Allan unsparingly.\r\n\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s name, it appeared was Bashwood. He had been some time (how\r\nlong, Allan could not remember) in Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s service. He had been\r\npreviously steward to a Norfolk gentleman (name forgotten) in the\r\nwestward district of the county. He had lost the steward\xe2\x80\x99s place,\r\nthrough some domestic trouble, in connection with his son, the precise\r\nnature of which Allan was not able to specify. Pedgift vouched for him,\r\nand Pedgift would send him to Thorpe Ambrose two or three days before\r\nthe rent-day dinner. He could not be spared, for office reasons, before\r\nthat time. There was no need to fidget about it; Pedgift laughed at the\r\nidea of there being any difficulty with the tenants. Two or three\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work over the steward\xe2\x80\x99s books with a man to help Midwinter who\r\npractically understood that sort of thing would put him all right for\r\nthe audit; and the other business would keep till afterward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen this Mr. Bashwood yourself, Allan?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Midwinter,\r\nstill obstinately on his guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Allan \xe2\x80\x9che was out--out with the bag, as young Pedgift\r\ncalled it. They tell me he\xe2\x80\x99s a decent elderly man. A little broken by\r\nhis troubles, and a little apt to be nervous and confused in his manner\r\nwith strangers; but thoroughly competent and thoroughly to be depended\r\non--those are Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s own words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter paused and considered a little, with a new interest in the\r\nsubject. The strange man whom he had just heard described, and the\r\nstrange man of whom he had asked his way where the three roads met,\r\nwere remarkably like each other. Was this another link in the\r\nfast-lengthening chain of events? Midwinter grew doubly determined to be\r\ncareful, as the bare doubt that it might be so passed through his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Mr. Bashwood comes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you let me see him, and speak\r\nto him, before anything definite is done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I will!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Allan. He stopped and looked at his watch.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do for you, old boy, in the meantime,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll introduce you to the prettiest girl in Norfolk! There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust time to run over to the cottage before dinner. Come along, and be\r\nintroduced to Miss Milroy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t introduce me to Miss Milroy to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Midwinter; and\r\nhe repeated the message of apology which had been brought from the major\r\nthat afternoon. Allan was surprised and disappointed; but he was not to\r\nbe foiled in his resolution to advance himself in the good graces of\r\nthe inhabitants of the cottage. After a little consideration he hit on\r\na means of turning the present adverse circumstances to good account.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show a proper anxiety for Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s recovery,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\ngravely. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send her a basket of strawberries, with my best respects,\r\nto-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing more happened to mark the end of that first day in the new\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe one noticeable event of the next day was another disclosure of\r\nMrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s infirmity of temper. Half an hour after Allan\xe2\x80\x99s basket of\r\nstrawberries had been delivered at the cottage, it was returned to him\r\nintact (by the hands of the invalid lady\xe2\x80\x99s nurse), with a short and\r\nsharp message, shortly and sharply delivered. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s compliments\r\nand thanks. Strawberries invariably disagreed with her.\xe2\x80\x9d If this\r\ncuriously petulant acknowledgment of an act of politeness was intended\r\nto irritate Allan, it failed entirely in accomplishing its object.\r\nInstead of being offended with the mother, he sympathized with the\r\ndaughter. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little thing,\xe2\x80\x9d was all he said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe must have a hard\r\nlife of it with such a mother as that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe called at the cottage himself later in the day, but Miss Milroy was\r\nnot to be seen; she was engaged upstairs. The major received his visitor\r\nin his working apron--far more deeply immersed in his wonderful clock,\r\nand far less readily accessible to outer influences, than Allan had seen\r\nhim at their first interview. His manner was as kind as before; but not\r\na word more could be extracted from him on the subject of his wife than\r\nthat Mrs. Milroy \xe2\x80\x9chad not improved since yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two next days passed quietly and uneventfully. Allan persisted\r\nin making his inquiries at the cottage; but all he saw of the major\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter was a glimpse of her on one occasion at a window on the bedroom\r\nfloor. Nothing more was heard from Mr. Pedgift; and Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance was still delayed. Midwinter declined to move in the matter\r\nuntil time enough had passed to allow of his first hearing from Mr.\r\nBrock, in answer to the letter which he had addressed to the rector on\r\nthe night of his arrival at Thorpe Ambrose. He was unusually silent and\r\nquiet, and passed most of his hours in the library among the books. The\r\ntime wore on wearily. The resident gentry acknowledged Allan\xe2\x80\x99s visit by\r\nformally leaving their cards. Nobody came near the house afterward;\r\nthe weather was monotonously fine. Allan grew a little restless and\r\ndissatisfied. He began to resent Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s illness; he began to\r\nthink regretfully of his deserted yacht.\r\n\r\nThe next day--the twentieth--brought some news with it from the outer\r\nworld. A message was delivered from Mr. Pedgift, announcing that his\r\nclerk, Mr. Bashwood, would personally present himself at Thorpe Ambrose\r\non the following day; and a letter in answer to Midwinter was received\r\nfrom Mr. Brock.\r\n\r\nThe letter was dated the 18th, and the news which it contained raised\r\nnot Allan\xe2\x80\x99s spirits only, but Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s as well.\r\n\r\nOn the day on which he wrote, Mr. Brock announced that he was about to\r\njourney to London; having been summoned thither on business connected\r\nwith the interests of a sick relative, to whom he stood in the position\r\nof trustee. The business completed, he had good hope of finding one or\r\nother of his clerical friends in the metropolis who would be able and\r\nwilling to do duty for him at the rectory; and, in that case, he trusted\r\nto travel on from London to Thorpe Ambrose in a week\xe2\x80\x99s time or less.\r\nUnder these circumstances, he would leave the majority of the subjects\r\non which Midwinter had written to him to be discussed when they met. But\r\nas time might be of importance, in relation to the stewardship of the\r\nThorpe Ambrose estate, he would say at once that he saw no reason why\r\nMidwinter should not apply his mind to learning the steward\xe2\x80\x99s duties,\r\nand should not succeed in rendering himself invaluably serviceable in\r\nthat way to the interests of his friend.\r\n\r\nLeaving Midwinter reading and re-reading the rector\xe2\x80\x99s cheering letter,\r\nas if he was bent on getting every sentence in it by heart, Allan\r\nwent out rather earlier than usual, to make his daily inquiry at the\r\ncottage--or, in plainer words, to make a fourth attempt at improving\r\nhis acquaintance with Miss Milroy. The day had begun encouragingly, and\r\nencouragingly it seemed destined to go on. When Allan turned the corner\r\nof the second shrubbery, and entered the little paddock where he and the\r\nmajor\xe2\x80\x99s daughter had first met, there was Miss Milroy herself loitering\r\nto and fro on the grass, to all appearance on the watch for somebody.\r\n\r\nShe gave a little start when Allan appeared, and came forward without\r\nhesitation to meet him. She was not in her best looks. Her rosy\r\ncomplexion had suffered under confinement to the house, and a marked\r\nexpression of embarrassment clouded her pretty face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know how to confess it, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, speaking\r\neagerly, before Allan could utter a word, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I certainly ventured\r\nhere this morning in the hope of meeting with you. I have been very much\r\ndistressed; I have only just heard, by accident, of the manner in which\r\nmamma received the present of fruit you so kindly sent to her. Will you\r\ntry to excuse her? She has been miserably ill for years, and she is not\r\nalways quite herself. After your being so very, very kind to me (and to\r\npapa), I really could not help stealing out here in the hope of seeing\r\nyou, and telling you how sorry I was. Pray forgive and forget, Mr.\r\nArmadale--pray do!\xe2\x80\x9d her voice faltered over the last words, and, in her\r\neagerness to make her mother\xe2\x80\x99s peace with him, she laid her hand on his\r\narm.\r\n\r\nAllan was himself a little confused. Her earnestness took him by\r\nsurprise, and her evident conviction that he had been offended honestly\r\ndistressed him. Not knowing what else to do, he followed his instincts,\r\nand possessed himself of her hand to begin with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Miss Milroy, if you say a word more you will distress _me_\r\nnext,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, unconsciously pressing her hand closer and closer,\r\nin the embarrassment of the moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI never was in the least offended;\r\nI made allowances--upon my honor I did--for poor Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s illness.\r\nOffended!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, reverting energetically to the old complimentary\r\nstrain. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to have my basket of fruit sent back every\r\nday--if I could only be sure of its bringing you out into the paddock\r\nthe first thing in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome of Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s missing color began to appear again in her cheeks.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Armadale, there is really no end to your kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d she said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you relieve me!\xe2\x80\x9d She paused; her spirits rallied with\r\nas happy a readiness of recovery as if they had been the spirits of a\r\nchild; and her native brightness of temper sparkled again in her eyes,\r\nas she looked up, shyly smiling in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, demurely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is almost time now to let go of my hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met. Allan followed his instincts for the second time.\r\nInstead of releasing her hand, he lifted it to his lips and kissed\r\nit. All the missing tints of the rosier sort returned to Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomplexion on the instant. She snatched away her hand as if Allan had\r\nburned it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ wrong, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and turned her head\r\naside quickly, for she was smiling in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant it as an apology for--for holding your hand too long,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n stammered Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cAn apology can\xe2\x80\x99t be wrong--can it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere are occasions, though not many, when the female mind accurately\r\nappreciates an appeal to the force of pure reason. This was one of the\r\noccasions. An abstract proposition had been presented to Miss Milroy,\r\nand Miss Milroy was convinced. If it was meant as an apology, that,\r\nshe admitted, made all the difference. \xe2\x80\x9cI only hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little\r\ncoquet, looking at him slyly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not misleading me. Not that it\r\nmatters much now,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a serious shake of her head. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we\r\nhave committed any improprieties, Mr. Armadale, we are not likely to\r\nhave the opportunity of committing many more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going away?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Allan, in great alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorse than that, Mr. Armadale. My new governess is coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cComing already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs good as coming, I ought to have said--only I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you wished\r\nme to be so very particular. We got the answers to the advertisements\r\nthis morning. Papa and I opened them and read them together half an hour\r\nago; and we both picked out the same letter from all the rest. I picked\r\nit out, because it was so prettily expressed; and papa picked it out\r\nbecause the terms were so reasonable. He is going to send the letter up\r\nto grandmamma in London by to-day\xe2\x80\x99s post, and, if she finds everything\r\nsatisfactory on inquiry, the governess is to be engaged You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how dreadfully nervous I am getting about it already; a strange\r\ngoverness is such an awful prospect. But it is not quite so bad as going\r\nto school; and I have great hopes of this new lady, because she writes\r\nsuch a nice letter! As I said to papa, it almost reconciles me to her\r\nhorrid, unromantic name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is her name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cBrown? Grubb? Scraggs? Anything of\r\nthat sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! hush! Nothing quite so horrible as that. Her name is Gwilt.\r\nDreadfully unpoetical, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Her reference must be a respectable\r\nperson, though; for she lives in the same part of London as grandmamma.\r\nStop, Mr. Armadale! we are going the wrong way. No; I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to look\r\nat those lovely flowers of yours this morning, and, many thanks, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\naccept your arm. I have stayed here too long already. Papa is waiting\r\nfor his breakfast; and I must run back every step of the way. Thank you\r\nfor making those kind allowances for mamma; thank you again and again,\r\nand good-by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you shake hands?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan.\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cNo more apologies, if you please, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, saucily. Once more their eyes met, and once more the plump,\r\ndimpled little hand found its way to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s lips. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t an apology\r\nthis time!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, precipitately defending himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s--it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmark of respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started back a few steps, and burst out laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t find me\r\nin our grounds again, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, merrily, \xe2\x80\x9ctill I have got\r\nMiss Gwilt to take care of me!\xe2\x80\x9d With that farewell, she gathered up her\r\nskirts, and ran back across the paddock at the top of her speed.\r\n\r\nAllan stood watching her in speechless admiration till she was out\r\nof sight. His second interview with Miss Milroy had produced an\r\nextraordinary effect on him. For the first time since he had become the\r\nmaster of Thorpe Ambrose, he was absorbed in serious consideration of\r\nwhat he owed to his new position in life. \xe2\x80\x9cThe question is,\xe2\x80\x9d pondered\r\nAllan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t better set myself right with my neighbors by\r\nbecoming a married man? I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the day to consider; and if I keep in\r\nthe same mind about it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll consult Midwinter to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the morning came, and when Allan descended to the breakfast-room,\r\nresolute to consult his friend on the obligations that he owed to his\r\nneighbors in general, and to Miss Milroy in particular, no Midwinter was\r\nto be seen. On making inquiry, it appeared that he had been observed in\r\nthe hall; that he had taken from the table a letter which the morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npost had brought to him; and that he had gone back immediately to his\r\nown room. Allan at once ascended the stairs again, and knocked at his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot just now,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have got a letter, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cAny bad news?\r\nAnything wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I\xe2\x80\x99m not very well this morning. Don\xe2\x80\x99t wait breakfast for me;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll come down as soon as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo more was said on either side. Allan returned to the breakfast-room a\r\nlittle disappointed. He had set his heart on rushing headlong into his\r\nconsultation with Midwinter, and here was the consultation indefinitely\r\ndelayed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an odd fellow he is!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth can\r\nhe be doing, locked in there by himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was doing nothing. He was sitting by the window, with the letter\r\nwhich had reached him that morning open in his hand. The handwriting was\r\nMr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s, and the words written were these:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MIDWINTER--I have literally only two minutes before post time\r\nto tell you that I have just met (in Kensington Gardens) with the woman\r\nwhom we both only know, thus far, as the woman with the red Paisley\r\nshawl. I have traced her and her companion (a respectable-looking\r\nelderly lady) to their residence--after having distinctly heard Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname mentioned between them. Depend on my not losing sight of the woman\r\nuntil I am satisfied that she means no mischief at Thorpe Ambrose;\r\nand expect to hear from me again as soon as I know how this strange\r\ndiscovery is to end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery truly yours, DECIMUS BROCK.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter reading the letter for the second time, Midwinter folded it up\r\nthoughtfully, and placed it in his pocket-book, side by side with the\r\nmanuscript narrative of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour discovery will not end with _you_, Mr. Brock,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo what\r\nyou will with the woman, when the time comes the woman will be here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. MOTHER OLDERSHAW ON HER GUARD.\r\n\r\n1. _From Mrs. Oldershaw (Diana Street, Pimlico) to Miss Gwilt (West\r\nPlace, Old Brompton)_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies\xe2\x80\x99 Toilet Repository, June 20th,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight in the Evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR LYDIA--About three hours have passed, as well as I can\r\nremember, since I pushed you unceremoniously inside my house in West\r\nPlace, and, merely telling you to wait till you saw me again, banged\r\nthe door to between us, and left you alone in the hall. I know your\r\nsensitive nature, my dear, and I am afraid you have made up your mind\r\nby this time that never yet was a guest treated so abominably by her\r\nhostess as I have treated you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe delay that has prevented me from explaining my strange conduct\r\nis, believe me, a delay for which I am not to blame. One of the many\r\ndelicate little difficulties which beset so essentially confidential\r\na business as mine occurred here (as I have since discovered) while\r\nwe were taking the air this afternoon in Kensington Gardens. I see no\r\nchance of being able to get back to you for some hours to come, and I\r\nhave a word of very urgent caution for your private ear, which has been\r\ntoo long delayed already. So I must use the spare minutes as they come,\r\nand write.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is caution the first. On no account venture outside the door again\r\nthis evening, and be very careful, while the daylight lasts, not to\r\nshow yourself at any of the front windows. I have reason to fear that\r\na certain charming person now staying with me may possibly be watched.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be impatient; you shall know why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only explain myself by going back to our unlucky meeting in the\r\nGardens with that reverend gentleman who was so obliging as to follow us\r\nboth back to my house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt crossed my mind, just as we were close to the door, that there\r\nmight be a motive for the parson\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety to trace us home, far less\r\ncreditable to his taste, and far more dangerous to both of us, than\r\nthe motive you supposed him to have. In plainer words, Lydia, I rather\r\ndoubted whether you had met with another admirer; and I strongly\r\nsuspected that you had encountered another enemy instead. There was\r\nno time to tell you this. There was only time to see you safe into the\r\nhouse, and to make sure of the parson (in case my suspicions were right)\r\nby treating him as he had treated us; I mean, by following him in his\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kept some little distance behind him at first, to turn the thing over\r\nin my mind, and to be satisfied that my doubts were not misleading me.\r\nWe have no concealments from each other; and you shall know what my\r\ndoubts were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not surprised at _your_ recognizing _him_; he is not at all\r\na common-looking old man; and you had seen him twice in\r\nSomersetshire--once when you asked your way of him to Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, and once when you saw him again on your way back to the railroad.\r\nBut I was a little puzzled (considering that you had your veil down\r\non both those occasions, and your veil down also when we were in the\r\nGardens) at his recognizing _you_. I doubted his remembering your figure\r\nin a summer dress after he had only seen it in a winter dress; and\r\nthough we were talking when he met us, and your voice is one among your\r\nmany charms, I doubted his remembering your voice, either. And yet\r\nI felt persuaded that he knew you. \xe2\x80\x98How?\xe2\x80\x99 you will ask. My dear, as\r\nill-luck would have it, we were speaking at the time of young Armadale.\r\nI firmly believe that the name was the first thing that struck him; and\r\nwhen he heard _that_, your voice certainly and your figure perhaps,\r\ncame back to his memory. \xe2\x80\x98And what if it did?\xe2\x80\x99 you may say. Think again,\r\nLydia, and tell me whether the parson of the place where Mrs. Armadale\r\nlived was not likely to be Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s friend? If he _was_ her\r\nfriend, the very first person to whom she would apply for advice\r\nafter the manner in which you frightened her, and after what you most\r\ninjudiciously said on the subject of appealing to her son, would be the\r\nclergyman of the parish--and the magistrate, too, as the landlord at the\r\ninn himself told you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will now understand why I left you in that extremely uncivil\r\nmanner, and I may go on to what happened next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI followed the old gentleman till he turned into a quiet street,\r\nand then accosted him, with respect for the Church written (I flatter\r\nmyself) in every line of my face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Will you excuse me,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98if I venture to inquire, sir, whether\r\nyou recognized the lady who was walking with me when you happened to\r\npass us in the Gardens?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Will you excuse my asking, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, why you put that question?\xe2\x80\x99 was all\r\nthe answer I got.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I will endeavor to tell you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98If my friend is not an\r\nabsolute stranger to you, I should wish to request your attention to a\r\nvery delicate subject, connected with a lady deceased, and with her son\r\nwho survives her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was staggered; I could see that. But he was sly enough at the same\r\ntime to hold his tongue and wait till I said something more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If I am wrong, sir, in thinking that you recognized my friend,\xe2\x80\x99 I went\r\non, \xe2\x80\x98I beg to apologize. But I could hardly suppose it possible that a\r\ngentleman in your profession would follow a lady home who was a total\r\nstranger to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere I had him. He colored up (fancy that, at his age!), and owned the\r\ntruth, in defense of his own precious character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I have met with the lady once before, and I acknowledge that I\r\nrecognized her in the Gardens,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98You will excuse me if I\r\ndecline entering into the question of whether I did or did not purposely\r\nfollow her home. If you wish to be assured that your friend is not an\r\nabsolute stranger to me, you now have that assurance; and if you have\r\nanything particular to say to me, I leave you to decide whether the time\r\nhas come to say it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe waited, and looked about. I waited, and looked about. He said the\r\nstreet was hardly a fit place to speak of a delicate subject in. I said\r\nthe street was hardly a fit place to speak of a delicate subject in. He\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t offer to take me to where he lived. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer to take him\r\nto where I lived. Have you ever seen two strange cats, my dear, nose to\r\nnose on the tiles? If you have, you have seen the parson and me done to\r\nthe life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, at last, \xe2\x80\x98shall we go on with our conversation\r\nin spite of circumstances?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98we are both of us, fortunately, of an age to set\r\ncircumstances at defiance\xe2\x80\x99 (I had seen the old wretch looking at my gray\r\nhair, and satisfying himself that his character was safe if he _was_\r\nseen with me).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all this snapping and snarling, we came to the point at last. I\r\nbegan by telling him that I feared his interest in you was not of the\r\nfriendly sort. He admitted that much--of course, in defense of his own\r\ncharacter once more. I next repeated to him everything you had told me\r\nabout your proceedings in Somersetshire, when we first found that he was\r\nfollowing us home. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed my dear--I was acting on principle.\r\nIf you want to make a dish of lies digestible, always give it a garnish\r\nof truth. Well, having appealed to the reverend gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s confidence\r\nin this matter, I next declared that you had become an altered woman\r\nsince he had seen you last. I revived that dead wretch, your husband\r\n(without mentioning names, of course), established him (the first place\r\nI thought of) in business at the Brazils, and described a letter which\r\nhe had written, offering to forgive his erring wife, if she would repent\r\nand go back to him. I assured the parson that your husband\xe2\x80\x99s noble\r\nconduct had softened your obdurate nature; and then, thinking I had\r\nproduced the right impression, I came boldly to close quarters with him.\r\nI said, \xe2\x80\x98At the very time when you met us, sir, my unhappy friend was\r\nspeaking in terms of touching, self-reproach of her conduct to the late\r\nMrs. Armadale. She confided to me her anxiety to make some atonement,\r\nif possible, to Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s son; and it is at her entreaty (for she\r\ncannot prevail on herself to face you) that I now beg to inquire whether\r\nMr. Armadale is still in Somersetshire, and whether he would consent\r\nto take back in small installments the sum of money which my friend\r\nacknowledges that she received by practicing on Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s fears.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThose were my very words. A neater story (accounting so nicely for\r\neverything) was never told; it was a story to melt a stone. But this\r\nSomersetshire parson is harder than stone itself. I blush for _him_,\r\nmy dear, when I assure you that he was evidently insensible enough to\r\ndisbelieve every word I said about your reformed character, your husband\r\nin the Brazils, and your penitent anxiety to pay the money back. It is\r\nreally a disgrace that such a man should be in the Church; such\r\ncunning as his is in the last degree unbecoming in a member of a sacred\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Does your friend propose to join her husband by the next steamer?\xe2\x80\x99 was\r\nall he condescended to say, when I had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI acknowledge I was angry. I snapped at him. I said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, she does.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How am I to communicate with her?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI snapped at him again. \xe2\x80\x98By letter--through me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98At what address, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, I had him once more. \xe2\x80\x98You have found my address out for\r\nyourself, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98The directory will tell you my name, if you\r\nwish to find that out for yourself also; otherwise, you are welcome to\r\nmy card.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Many thanks, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. If your friend wishes to communicate with Mr.\r\nArmadale, I will give you _my_ card in return.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Good-afternoon, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Good-afternoon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we parted. I went my way to an appointment at my place of business,\r\nand he went his in a hurry; which is of itself suspicious. What I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget over is his heartlessness. Heaven help the people who send for _him_\r\nto comfort them on their death-beds!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next consideration is, What are we to do? If we don\xe2\x80\x99t find out the\r\nright way to keep this old wretch in the dark, he may be the ruin of us\r\nat Thorpe Ambrose just as we are within easy reach of our end in view.\r\nWait up till I come to you, with my mind free, I hope, from the other\r\ndifficulty which is worrying me here. Was there ever such ill luck as\r\nours? Only think of that man deserting his congregation, and coming\r\nto London just at the very time when we have answered Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadvertisement, and may expect the inquiries to be made next week! I have\r\nno patience with him; his bishop ought to interfere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARIA OLDERSHAW.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n2. _From Miss Gwilt to Mrs. Oldershaw_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWest Place, June 20th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY POOR OLD DEAR--How very little you know of my sensitive nature, as\r\nyou call it! Instead of feeling offended when you left me, I went to\r\nyour piano, and forgot all about you till your messenger came. Your\r\nletter is irresistible; I have been laughing over it till I am quite\r\nout of breath. Of all the absurd stories I ever read, the story you\r\naddressed to the Somersetshire clergyman is the most ridiculous. And as\r\nfor your interview with him in the street, it is a perfect sin to keep\r\nit to ourselves. The public ought really to enjoy it in the form of a\r\nfarce at one of the theaters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuckily for both of us (to come to serious matters), your messenger is\r\na prudent person. He sent upstairs to know if there was an answer.\r\nIn the midst of my merriment I had presence of mind enough to send\r\ndownstairs and say \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome brute of a man says, in some book which I once read, that no woman\r\ncan keep two separate trains of ideas in her mind at the same time. I\r\ndeclare you have almost satisfied me that the man is right. What! when\r\nyou have escaped unnoticed to your place of business, and when you\r\nsuspect this house to be watched, you propose to come back here, and\r\nto put it in the parson\xe2\x80\x99s power to recover the lost trace of you! What\r\nmadness! Stop where you are; and when you have got over your difficulty\r\nat Pimlico (it is some woman\xe2\x80\x99s business, of course; what worries women\r\nare!), be so good as to read what I have got to say about our difficulty\r\nat Brompton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, the house (as you supposed) is watched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour after you left me, loud voices in the street interrupted\r\nme at the piano, and I went to the window. There was a cab at the house\r\nopposite, where they let lodgings; and an old man, who looked like a\r\nrespectable servant, was wrangling with the driver about his fare. An\r\nelderly gentleman came out of the house, and stopped them. An elderly\r\ngentleman returned into the house, and appeared cautiously at the front\r\ndrawing-room window. You know him, you worthy creature; he had the bad\r\ntaste, some few hours since, to doubt whether you were telling him\r\nthe truth. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t see me. When he looked up, after\r\nsettling with the cab driver, I was behind the curtain. I have been\r\nbehind the curtain once or twice since; and I have seen enough to\r\nsatisfy me that he and his servant will relieve each other at the\r\nwindow, so as never to lose sight of your house here, night or day. That\r\nthe parson suspects the real truth is of course impossible. But that\r\nhe firmly believes I mean some mischief to young Armadale, and that you\r\nhave entirely confirmed him in that conviction, is as plain as that two\r\nand two make four. And this has happened (as you helplessly remind me)\r\njust when we have answered the advertisement, and when we may expect the\r\nmajor\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries to be made in a few days\xe2\x80\x99 time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, here is a terrible situation for two women to find themselves\r\nin? A fiddlestick\xe2\x80\x99s end for the situation! We have got an easy way out\r\nof it--thanks, Mother Oldershaw, to what I myself forced you to do, not\r\nthree hours before the Somersetshire clergyman met with us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas that venomous little quarrel of ours this morning--after we had\r\npounced on the major\xe2\x80\x99s advertisement in the newspaper--quite slipped out\r\nof your memory? Have you forgotten how I persisted in my opinion that\r\nyou were a great deal too well known in London to appear safely as my\r\nreference in your own name, or to receive an inquiring lady or gentleman\r\n(as you were rash enough to propose) in your own house? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nremember what a passion you were in when I brought our dispute to an end\r\nby declining to stir a step in the matter, unless I could conclude my\r\napplication to Major Milroy by referring him to an address at which you\r\nwere totally unknown, and to a name which might be anything you pleased,\r\nas long as it was not yours? What a look you gave me when you found\r\nthere was nothing for it but to drop the whole speculation or to let\r\nme have my own way! How you fumed over the lodging hunting on the other\r\nside of the Park! and how you groaned when you came back, possessed of\r\nfurnished apartments in respectable Bayswater, over the useless expense\r\nI had put you to!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of those furnished apartments _now_, you obstinate\r\nold woman? Here we are, with discovery threatening us at our very door,\r\nand with no hope of escape unless we can contrive to disappear from the\r\nparson in the dark. And there are the lodgings in Bayswater, to which no\r\ninquisitive strangers have traced either you or me, ready and waiting\r\nto swallow us up--the lodgings in which we can escape all further\r\nmolestation, and answer the major\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries at our ease. Can you see,\r\nat last, a little further than your poor old nose? Is there anything in\r\nthe world to prevent your safe disappearance from Pimlico to-night,\r\nand your safe establishment at the new lodgings, in the character of\r\nmy respectable reference, half an hour afterward? Oh, fie, fie, Mother\r\nOldershaw! Go down on your wicked old knees, and thank your stars that\r\nyou had a she-devil like me to deal with this morning!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we come now to the only difficulty worth mentioning--_my_\r\ndifficulty. Watched as I am in this house, how am I to join you without\r\nbringing the parson or the parson\xe2\x80\x99s servant with me at my heels?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing to all intents and purposes a prisoner here, it seems to me that\r\nI have no choice but to try the old prison plan of escape: a change of\r\nclothes. I have been looking at your house-maid. Except that we are both\r\nlight, her face and hair and my face and hair are as unlike each other\r\nas possible. But she is as nearly as can be my height and size; and (if\r\nshe only knew how to dress herself, and had smaller feet) her figure is\r\na very much better one than it ought to be for a person in her station\r\nin life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy idea is to dress her in the clothes I wore in the Gardens to-day;\r\nto send her out, with our reverend enemy in full pursuit of her; and, as\r\nsoon as the coast is clear, to slip away myself and join you. The thing\r\nwould be quite impossible, of course, if I had been seen with my veil\r\nup; but, as events have turned out, it is one advantage of the horrible\r\nexposure which followed my marriage that I seldom show myself in public,\r\nand never, of course, in such a populous place as London, without\r\nwearing a thick veil and keeping that veil down. If the house-maid wears\r\nmy dress, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really see why the house-maid may not be counted on to\r\nrepresent me to the life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one question is, Can the woman be trusted? If she can, send me a\r\nline, telling her, on your authority, that she is to place herself at my\r\ndisposal. I won\xe2\x80\x99t say a word till I have heard from you first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me have my answer to-night. As long as we were only talking about\r\nmy getting the governess\xe2\x80\x99s place, I was careless enough how it ended.\r\nBut now that we have actually answered Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s advertisement, I\r\nam in earnest at last. I mean to be Mrs. Armadale of Thorpe Ambrose; and\r\nwoe to the man or woman who tries to stop me! Yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLYDIA GWILT.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.--I open my letter again to say that you need have no fear of your\r\nmessenger being followed on his return to Pimlico. He will drive to a\r\npublic-house where he is known, will dismiss the cab at the door, and\r\nwill go out again by a back way which is only used by the landlord and\r\nhis friends.--L. G.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n3. _From Mrs. Oldershaw to Miss Gwilt_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana Street, 10 o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR LYDIA--You have written me a heartless letter. If you had been\r\nin my trying position, harassed as I was when I wrote to you, I should\r\nhave made allowances for my friend when I found my friend not so sharp\r\nas usual. But the vice of the present age is a want of consideration\r\nfor persons in the decline of life. Morally speaking, you are in a sad\r\nstate, my dear; and you stand much in need of a good example. You shall\r\nhave a good example--I forgive you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving now relieved my mind by the performance of a good action,\r\nsuppose I show you next (though I protest against the vulgarity of the\r\nexpression) that I _can_ see a little further than my poor old nose?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will answer your question about the house-maid first. You may trust\r\nher implicitly. She has had her troubles, and has learned discretion.\r\nShe also looks your age; though it is only her due to say that, in\r\nthis particular, she has some years the advantage of you. I inclose the\r\nnecessary directions which will place her entirely at your disposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what comes next?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour plan for joining me at Bayswater comes next. It is very well\r\nas far as it goes; but it stands sadly in need of a little judicious\r\nimprovement. There is a serious necessity (you shall know why presently)\r\nfor deceiving the parson far more completely than you propose to deceive\r\nhim. I want him to see the house-maid\xe2\x80\x99s face under circumstances\r\nwhich will persuade him that it is _your_ face. And then, going a\r\nstep further, I want him to see the house-maid leave London, under\r\nthe impression that he has seen _you_ start on the first stage of\r\nyour journey to the Brazils. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in that journey when I\r\nannounced it to him this afternoon in the street. He may believe in it\r\nyet, if you follow the directions I am now going to give you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow is Saturday. Send the housemaid out in your walking dress of\r\nto-day, just as you propose; but don\xe2\x80\x99t stir out yourself, and don\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nnear the window. Desire the woman to keep her veil down, to take half an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s walk (quite unconscious, of course, of the parson or his servant\r\nat her heels), and then to come back to you. As soon as she appears,\r\nsend her instantly to the open window, instructing her to lift her veil\r\ncarelessly and look out. Let her go away again after a minute or two,\r\ntake off her bonnet and shawl, and then appear once more at the window,\r\nor, better still, in the balcony outside. She may show herself again\r\noccasionally (not too often) later in the day. And to-morrow--as we have\r\na professional gentleman to deal with--by all means send her to church.\r\nIf these proceedings don\xe2\x80\x99t persuade the parson that the house-maid\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface is your face, and if they don\xe2\x80\x99t make him readier to believe in your\r\nreformed character than he was when I spoke to him, I have lived sixty\r\nyears, my love, in this vale of tears to mighty little purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day is Monday. I have looked at the shipping advertisements,\r\nand I find that a steamer leaves Liverpool for the Brazils on Tuesday.\r\nNothing could be more convenient; we will start you on your voyage under\r\nthe parson\xe2\x80\x99s own eyes. You may manage it in this way:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt one o\xe2\x80\x99clock send out the man who cleans the knives and forks to get\r\na cab; and when he has brought it up to the door, let him go back and\r\nget a second cab, which he is to wait in himself, round the corner, in\r\nthe square. Let the house-maid (still in your dress) drive off, with the\r\nnecessary boxes, in the first cab to the North-western Railway. When she\r\nis gone, slip out yourself to the cab waiting round the corner, and come\r\nto me at Bayswater. They may be prepared to follow the house-maid\xe2\x80\x99s cab,\r\nbecause they have seen it at the door; but they won\xe2\x80\x99t be prepared to\r\nfollow your cab, because it has been hidden round the corner. When the\r\nhouse-maid has got to the station, and has done her best to disappear\r\nin the crowd (I have chosen the mixed train at 2:10, so as to give her\r\nevery chance), you will be safe with me; and whether they do or do not\r\nfind out that she does not really start for Liverpool won\xe2\x80\x99t matter by\r\nthat time. They will have lost all trace of you; and they may follow\r\nthe house-maid half over London, if they like. She has my instructions\r\n(inclosed) to leave the empty boxes to find their way to the lost\r\nluggage office and to go to her friends in the City, and stay there till\r\nI write word that I want her again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the object of all this?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Lydia, the object is your future security (and mine). We may\r\nsucceed or we may fail, in persuading the parson that you have actually\r\ngone to the Brazils. If we succeed, we are relieved of all fear of him.\r\nIf we fail, he will warn young Armadale to be careful _of a woman like\r\nmy house-maid, and not of a woman like you_. This last gain is a very\r\nimportant one; for we don\xe2\x80\x99t know that Mrs. Armadale may not have told\r\nhim your maiden name. In that event, the \xe2\x80\x98Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99 whom he will\r\ndescribe as having slipped through his fingers here will be so entirely\r\nunlike the \xe2\x80\x98Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99 established at Thorpe Ambrose, as to satisfy\r\neverybody that it is not a case of similarity of persons, but only a\r\ncase of similarity of names.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say now to my improvement on your idea? Are my brains not\r\nquite so addled as you thought them when you wrote? Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m at\r\nall overboastful about my own ingenuity. Cleverer tricks than this trick\r\nof mine are played off on the public by swindlers, and are recorded in\r\nthe newspapers every week. I only want to show you that my assistance is\r\nnot less necessary to the success of the Armadale speculation now than\r\nit was when I made our first important discoveries, by means of the\r\nharmless-looking young man and the private inquiry office in Shadyside\r\nPlace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing more to say that I know of, except that I am just\r\ngoing to start for the new lodging, with a box directed in my new name.\r\nThe last expiring moments of Mother Oldershaw, of the Toilet Repository,\r\nare close at hand, and the birth of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s respectable reference,\r\nMrs. Mandeville, will take place in a cab in five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 time. I fancy\r\nI must be still young at heart, for I am quite in love already with my\r\nromantic name; it sounds almost as pretty as Mrs. Armadale of Thorpe\r\nAmbrose, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, my dear, and pleasant dreams. If any accident happens\r\nbetween this and Monday, write to me instantly by post. If no accident\r\nhappens you will be with me in excellent time for the earliest inquiries\r\nthat the major can possibly make. My last words are, don\xe2\x80\x99t go out, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t venture near the front windows till Monday comes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM. O.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. MIDWINTER IN DISGUISE.\r\n\r\nToward noon on the day of the twenty-first, Miss Milroy was loitering\r\nin the cottage garden--released from duty in the sick-room by an\r\nimprovement in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s health--when her attention was attracted\r\nby the sound of voices in the park. One of the voices she instantly\r\nrecognized as Allan\xe2\x80\x99s; the other was strange to her. She put aside the\r\nbranches of a shrub near the garden palings, and, peeping through,\r\nsaw Allan approaching the cottage gate, in company with a slim, dark,\r\nundersized man, who was talking and laughing excitably at the top of\r\nhis voice. Miss Milroy ran indoors to warn her father of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrival, and to add that he was bringing with him a noisy stranger, who\r\nwas, in all probability, the friend generally reported to be staying\r\nwith the squire at the great house.\r\n\r\nHad the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter guessed right? Was the squire\xe2\x80\x99s loud-talking,\r\nloud-laughing companion the shy, sensitive Midwinter of other times? It\r\nwas even so. In Allan\xe2\x80\x99s presence, that morning, an extraordinary change\r\nhad passed over the ordinarily quiet demeanor of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\r\n\r\nWhen Midwinter had first appeared in the breakfast-room, after putting\r\naside Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s startling letter, Allan had been too much occupied to\r\npay any special attention to him. The undecided difficulty of choosing\r\nthe day for the audit dinner had pressed for a settlement once more,\r\nand had been fixed at last (under the butler\xe2\x80\x99s advice) for Saturday,\r\nthe twenty-eighth of the month. It was only on turning round to remind\r\nMidwinter of the ample space of time which the new arrangement allowed\r\nfor mastering the steward\xe2\x80\x99s books, that even Allan\xe2\x80\x99s flighty attention\r\nhad been arrested by a marked change in the face that confronted him.\r\nHe had openly noticed the change in his usual blunt manner, and had been\r\ninstantly silenced by a fretful, almost an angry, reply. The two had sat\r\ndown together to breakfast without the usual cordiality, and the meal\r\nhad proceeded gloomily, till Midwinter himself broke the silence by\r\nbursting into the strange outbreak of gayety which had revealed in\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes a new side to the character of his friend.\r\n\r\nAs usual with most of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s judgments, here again the conclusion was\r\nwrong. It was no new side to Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s character that now presented\r\nitself--it was only a new aspect of the one ever-recurring struggle of\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nIrritated by Allan\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of the change in him, and dreading the\r\nnext questions that Allan\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity might put, Midwinter had roused\r\nhimself to efface, by main force, the impression which his own altered\r\nappearance had produced. It was one of those efforts which no men\r\ncompass so resolutely as the men of his quick temper and his sensitive\r\nfeminine organization. With his whole mind still possessed by the firm\r\nbelief that the Fatality had taken one great step nearer to Allan and\r\nhimself since the rector\xe2\x80\x99s adventure in Kensington Gardens--with his\r\nface still betraying what he had suffered, under the renewed conviction\r\nthat his father\xe2\x80\x99s death-bed warning was now, in event after event,\r\nasserting its terrible claim to part him, at any sacrifice, from the one\r\nhuman creature whom he loved--with the fear still busy at his heart that\r\nthe first mysterious vision of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s Dream might be a vision realized,\r\nbefore the new day that now saw the two Armadales together was a day\r\nthat had passed over their heads--with these triple bonds, wrought by\r\nhis own superstition, fettering him at that moment as they had never\r\nfettered him yet, he mercilessly spurred his resolution to the desperate\r\neffort of rivaling, in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s presence, the gayety and good spirits of\r\nAllan himself.\r\n\r\nHe talked and laughed, and heaped his plate indiscriminately from every\r\ndish on the breakfast-table. He made noisily merry with jests that had\r\nno humor, and stories that had no point. He first astonished Allan, then\r\namused him, then won his easily encouraged confidence on the subject\r\nof Miss Milroy. He shouted with laughter over the sudden development of\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s views on marriage, until the servants downstairs began to think\r\nthat their master\xe2\x80\x99s strange friend had gone mad. Lastly, he had accepted\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s proposal that he should be presented to the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\r\nand judge of her for himself, as readily, nay, more readily than it\r\nwould have been accepted by the least diffident man living. There the\r\ntwo now stood at the cottage gate--Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s voice rising louder and\r\nlouder over Allan\xe2\x80\x99s--Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s natural manner disguised (how madly\r\nand miserably none but he knew!) in a coarse masquerade of boldness--the\r\noutrageous, the unendurable boldness of a shy man.\r\n\r\nThey were received in the parlor by the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, pending the\r\narrival of the major himself.\r\n\r\nAllan attempted to present his friend in the usual form. To his\r\nastonishment, Midwinter took the words flippantly out of his lips, and\r\nintroduced himself to Miss Milroy with a confident look, a hard laugh,\r\nand a clumsy assumption of ease which presented him at his worst.\r\nHis artificial spirits, lashed continuously into higher and higher\r\neffervescence since the morning, were now mounting hysterically beyond\r\nhis own control. He looked and spoke with that terrible freedom of\r\nlicense which is the necessary consequence, when a diffident man has\r\nthrown off his reserve, of the very effort by which he has broken loose\r\nfrom his own restraints. He involved himself in a confused medley of\r\napologies that were not wanted, and of compliments that might have\r\noverflattered the vanity of a savage. He looked backward and forward\r\nfrom Miss Milroy to Allan, and declared jocosely that he understood now\r\nwhy his friend\xe2\x80\x99s morning walks were always taken in the same direction.\r\nHe asked her questions about her mother, and cut short the answers she\r\ngave him by remarks on the weather. In one breath, he said she must\r\nfeel the day insufferably hot, and in another he protested that he quite\r\nenvied her in her cool muslin dress.\r\n\r\nThe major came in.\r\n\r\nBefore he could say two words, Midwinter overwhelmed him with the same\r\nfrenzy of familiarity, and the same feverish fluency of speech. He\r\nexpressed his interest in Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s health in terms which would have\r\nbeen exaggerated on the lips of a friend of the family. He overflowed\r\ninto a perfect flood of apologies for disturbing the major at his\r\nmechanical pursuits. He quoted Allan\xe2\x80\x99s extravagant account of the clock,\r\nand expressed his own anxiety to see it in terms more extravagant\r\nstill. He paraded his superficial book knowledge of the great clock\r\nat Strasbourg, with far-fetched jests on the extraordinary automaton\r\nfigures which that clock puts in motion--on the procession of the Twelve\r\nApostles, which walks out under the dial at noon, and on the toy cock,\r\nwhich crows at St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s appearance--and this before a man who had\r\nstudied every wheel in that complex machinery, and who had passed whole\r\nyears of his life in trying to imitate it. \xe2\x80\x9cI hear you have outnumbered\r\nthe Strasbourg apostles, and outcrowed the Strasbourg cock,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed, with the tone and manner of a friend habitually privileged\r\nto waive all ceremony; \xe2\x80\x9cand I am dying, absolutely dying, major, to see\r\nyour wonderful clock!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMajor Milroy had entered the room with his mind absorbed in his own\r\nmechanical contrivances as usual. But the sudden shock of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamiliarity was violent enough to recall him instantly to himself, and\r\nto make him master again, for the time, of his social resources as a man\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me for interrupting you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stopping Midwinter for the\r\nmoment, by a look of steady surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cI happen to have seen the clock\r\nat Strasbourg; and it sounds almost absurd in my ears (if you will\r\npardon me for saying so) to put my little experiment in any light of\r\ncomparison with that wonderful achievement. There is nothing else of\r\nthe kind like it in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, to control his own mounting\r\nenthusiasm; the clock at Strasbourg was to Major Milroy what the name of\r\nMichael Angelo was to Sir Joshua Reynolds. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s kindness has\r\nled him to exaggerate a little,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the major, smiling at Allan,\r\nand passing over another attempt of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s to seize on the talk, as\r\nif no such attempt had been made. \xe2\x80\x9cBut as there does happen to be this\r\none point of resemblance between the great clock abroad and the little\r\nclock at home, that they both show what they can do on the stroke of\r\nnoon, and as it is close on twelve now, if you still wish to visit\r\nmy workshop, Mr. Midwinter, the sooner I show you the way to it the\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d He opened the door, and apologized to Midwinter, with marked\r\nceremony, for preceding him out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Allan, as he and Miss Milroy\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I tell you the truth, Mr. Armadale?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I don\xe2\x80\x99t like him at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the best and dearest fellow in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the outspoken\r\nAllan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll like him better when you know him better--I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\r\nwill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Milroy made a little grimace, implying supreme indifference to\r\nMidwinter, and saucy surprise at Allan\xe2\x80\x99s earnest advocacy of the merits\r\nof his friend. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he got nothing more interesting to say to me than\r\n_that_,\xe2\x80\x9d she wondered, privately, \xe2\x80\x9cafter kissing my hand twice yesterday\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were all in the major\xe2\x80\x99s workroom before Allan had the chance of\r\ntrying a more attractive subject. There, on the top of a rough wooden\r\ncase, which evidently contained the machinery, was the wonderful clock.\r\nThe dial was crowned by a glass pedestal placed on rock-work in carved\r\nebony; and on the top of the pedestal sat the inevitable figure of Time,\r\nwith his everlasting scythe in his hand. Below the dial was a little\r\nplatform, and at either end of it rose two miniature sentry-boxes, with\r\nclosed doors. Externally, this was all that appeared, until the magic\r\nmoment came when the clock struck twelve noon.\r\n\r\nIt wanted then about three minutes to twelve; and Major Milroy seized\r\nthe opportunity of explaining what the exhibition was to be, before the\r\nexhibition began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the first words, his mind fell back again into its old absorption\r\nover the one employment of his life. He turned to Midwinter (who had\r\npersisted in talking all the way from the parlor, and who was talking\r\nstill) without a trace left in his manner of the cool and cutting\r\ncomposure with which he had spoken but a few minutes before. The noisy,\r\nfamiliar man, who had been an ill-bred intruder in the parlor, became\r\na privileged guest in the workshop, for _there_ he possessed the\r\nall-atoning social advantage of being new to the performances of the\r\nwonderful clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the first stroke of twelve, Mr. Midwinter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the major, quite\r\neagerly, \xe2\x80\x9ckeep your eye on the figure of Time: he will move his scythe,\r\nand point it downward to the glass pedestal. You will next see a little\r\nprinted card appear behind the glass, which will tell you the day of\r\nthe month and the day of the week. At the last stroke of the clock, Time\r\nwill lift his scythe again into its former position, and the chimes will\r\nring a peal. The peal will be succeeded by the playing of a tune--the\r\nfavorite march of my old regiment--and then the final performance of the\r\nclock will follow. The sentry-boxes, which you may observe at each\r\nside, will both open at the same moment. In one of them you will see\r\nthe sentinel appear; and from the other a corporal and two privates will\r\nmarch across the platform to relieve the guard, and will then disappear,\r\nleaving the new sentinel at his post. I must ask your kind allowances\r\nfor this last part of the performance. The machinery is a little\r\ncomplicated, and there are defects in it which I am ashamed to say\r\nI have not yet succeeded in remedying as I could wish. Sometimes the\r\nfigures go all wrong, and sometimes they go all right. I hope they may\r\ndo their best on the occasion of your seeing them for the first time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the major, posted near his clock, said the last words, his little\r\naudience of three, assembled at the opposite end of the room, saw the\r\nhour-hand and the minute-hand on the dial point together to twelve. The\r\nfirst stroke sounded, and Time, true to the signal, moved his scythe.\r\nThe day of the month and the day of the week announced themselves\r\nin print through the glass pedestal next; Midwinter applauding their\r\nappearance with a noisy exaggeration of surprise, which Miss Milroy\r\nmistook for coarse sarcasm directed at her father\xe2\x80\x99s pursuits, and which\r\nAllan (seeing that she was offended) attempted to moderate by touching\r\nthe elbow of his friend. Meanwhile, the performances of the clock went\r\non. At the last stroke of twelve, Time lifted his scythe again, the\r\nchimes rang, the march tune of the major\xe2\x80\x99s old regiment followed; and\r\nthe crowning exhibition of the relief of the guard announced itself in a\r\npreliminary trembling of the sentry-boxes, and a sudden disappearance of\r\nthe major at the back of the clock.\r\n\r\nThe performance began with the opening of the sentry-box on the\r\nright-hand side of the platform, as punctually as could be desired;\r\nthe door on the other side, however, was less tractable--it remained\r\nobstinately closed. Unaware of this hitch in the proceedings, the\r\ncorporal and his two privates appeared in their places in a state\r\nof perfect discipline, tottered out across the platform, all three\r\ntrembling in every limb, dashed themselves headlong against the closed\r\ndoor on the other side, and failed in producing the smallest impression\r\non the immovable sentry presumed to be within. An intermittent clicking,\r\nas of the major\xe2\x80\x99s keys and tools at work, was heard in the machinery.\r\nThe corporal and his two privates suddenly returned, backward, across\r\nthe platform, and shut themselves up with a bang inside their own door.\r\nExactly at the same moment, the other door opened for the first time,\r\nand the provoking sentry appeared with the utmost deliberation at his\r\npost, waiting to be relieved. He was allowed to wait. Nothing happened\r\nin the other box but an occasional knocking inside the door, as if the\r\ncorporal and his privates were impatient to be let out. The clicking of\r\nthe major\xe2\x80\x99s tools was heard again among the machinery; the corporal and\r\nhis party, suddenly restored to liberty, appeared in a violent hurry,\r\nand spun furiously across the platform. Quick as they were, however,\r\nthe hitherto deliberate sentry on the other side now perversely showed\r\nhimself to be quicker still. He disappeared like lightning into his\r\nown premises, the door closed smartly after him, the corporal and his\r\nprivates dashed themselves headlong against it for the second time,\r\nand the major, appearing again round the corner of the clock, asked his\r\naudience innocently \xe2\x80\x9cif they would be good enough to tell him whether\r\nanything had gone wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fantastic absurdity of the exhibition, heightened by Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrave inquiry at the end of it, was so irresistibly ludicrous that\r\nthe visitors shouted with laughter; and even Miss Milroy, with all her\r\nconsideration for her father\xe2\x80\x99s sensitive pride in his clock, could not\r\nrestrain herself from joining in the merriment which the catastrophe of\r\nthe puppets had provoked. But there are limits even to the license of\r\nlaughter; and these limits were ere long so outrageously overstepped\r\nby one of the little party as to have the effect of almost instantly\r\nsilencing the other two. The fever of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s false spirits flamed\r\nout into sheer delirium as the performance of the puppets came to an\r\nend. His paroxysms of laughter followed each other with such convulsive\r\nviolence that Miss Milroy started back from him in alarm, and even the\r\npatient major turned on him with a look which said plainly, Leave the\r\nroom! Allan, wisely impulsive for once in his life, seized Midwinter by\r\nthe arm, and dragged him out by main force into the garden, and thence\r\ninto the park beyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! what has come to you!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, shrinking back from\r\nthe tortured face before him, as he stopped and looked close at it for\r\nthe first time.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, Midwinter was incapable of answering. The hysterical\r\nparoxysm was passing from one extreme to the other. He leaned against a\r\ntree, sobbing and gasping for breath, and stretched out his hand in mute\r\nentreaty to Allan to give him time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not have nursed me through my fever,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, faintly,\r\nas soon as he could speak. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m mad and miserable, Allan; I have never\r\nrecovered it. Go back and ask them to forgive me; I am ashamed to go\r\nand ask them myself. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell how it happened; I can only ask your\r\npardon and theirs.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned aside his head quickly so as to conceal\r\nhis face. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stop here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t look at me; I shall soon\r\nget over it.\xe2\x80\x9d Allan still hesitated, and begged hard to be allowed to\r\ntake him back to the house. It was useless. \xe2\x80\x9cYou break my heart with\r\nyour kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out, passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, leave me by\r\nmy self!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan went back to the cottage, and pleaded there for indulgence to\r\nMidwinter, with an earnestness and simplicity which raised him immensely\r\nin the major\xe2\x80\x99s estimation, but which totally failed to produce the same\r\nfavorable impression on Miss Milroy. Little as she herself suspected it,\r\nshe was fond enough of Allan already to be jealous of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow excessively absurd!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, pettishly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if either papa or\r\nI considered such a person of the slightest consequence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will kindly suspend your opinion, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, Major Milroy?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAllan, in his hearty way, at parting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the greatest pleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the major, cordially shaking\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, too, Miss Milroy?\xe2\x80\x9d added Allan.\r\n\r\nMiss Milroy made a mercilessly formal bow. \xe2\x80\x9c_My_ opinion, Mr. Armadale,\r\nis not of the slightest consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan left the cottage, sorely puzzled to account for Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsudden coolness toward him. His grand idea of conciliating the whole\r\nneighborhood by becoming a married man underwent some modification as\r\nhe closed the garden gate behind him. The virtue called Prudence and the\r\nSquire of Thorpe Ambrose became personally acquainted with each other,\r\non this occasion, for the first time; and Allan, entering headlong as\r\nusual on the high-road to moral improvement, actually decided on doing\r\nnothing in a hurry!\r\n\r\nA man who is entering on a course of reformation ought, if virtue is its\r\nown reward, to be a man engaged in an essentially inspiriting pursuit.\r\nBut virtue is not always its own reward; and the way that leads to\r\nreformation is remarkably ill-lighted for so respectable a thoroughfare.\r\nAllan seemed to have caught the infection of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s despondency.\r\nAs he walked home, he, too, began to doubt--in his widely different way,\r\nand for his widely different reasons--whether the life at Thorpe Ambrose\r\nwas promising quite as fairly for the future as it had promised at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE PLOT THICKENS.\r\n\r\nTwo messages were waiting for Allan when he returned to the house. One\r\nhad been left by Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had gone out for a long walk, and Mr.\r\nArmadale was not to be alarmed if he did not get back till late in the\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d The other message had been left by \xe2\x80\x9ca person from Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice,\xe2\x80\x9d who had called, according to appointment, while the two\r\ngentlemen were away at the major\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s respects, and he\r\nwould have the honor of waiting on Mr. Armadale again in the course of\r\nthe evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToward five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Midwinter returned, pale and silent. Allan hastened\r\nto assure him that his peace was made at the cottage; and then, to\r\nchange the subject, mentioned Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s message. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nwas so preoccupied or so languid that he hardly seemed to remember the\r\nname. Allan was obliged to remind him that Bashwood was the elderly\r\nclerk, whom Mr. Pedgift had sent to be his instructor in the duties\r\nof the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office. He listened without making any remark, and\r\nwithdrew to his room, to rest till dinner-time.\r\n\r\nLeft by himself, Allan went into the library, to try if he could while\r\naway the time over a book.\r\n\r\nHe took many volumes off the shelves, and put a few of them back again;\r\nand there he ended. Miss Milroy contrived in some mysterious manner to\r\nget, in this case, between the reader and the books. Her formal bow and\r\nher merciless parting speech dwelt, try how he might to forget them, on\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s mind; he began to grow more and more anxious as the idle hour\r\nwore on, to recover his lost place in her favor. To call again that day\r\nat the cottage, and ask if he had been so unfortunate as to offend her,\r\nwas impossible. To put the question in writing with the needful nicety\r\nof expression proved, on trying the experiment, to be a task beyond his\r\nliterary reach. After a turn or two up and down the room, with his pen\r\nin his mouth, he decided on the more diplomatic course (which happened,\r\nin this case, to be the easiest course, too), of writing to Miss Milroy\r\nas cordially as if nothing had happened, and of testing his position in\r\nher good graces by the answer that she sent him back. An invitation of\r\nsome kind (including her father, of course, but addressed directly to\r\nherself) was plainly the right thing to oblige her to send a written\r\nreply; but here the difficulty occurred of what the invitation was to\r\nbe. A ball was not to be thought of, in his present position with the\r\nresident gentry. A dinner-party, with no indispensable elderly lady on\r\nthe premises to receive Miss Milroy--except Mrs. Gripper, who could only\r\nreceive her in the kitchen--was equally out of the question. What was\r\nthe invitation to be? Never backward, when he wanted help, in asking for\r\nit right and left in every available direction, Allan, feeling himself\r\nat the end of his own resources, coolly rang the bell, and astonished\r\nthe servant who answered it by inquiring how the late family at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose used to amuse themselves, and what sort of invitations they were\r\nin the habit of sending to their friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe family did what the rest of the gentry did, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man,\r\nstaring at his master in utter bewilderment. \xe2\x80\x9cThey gave dinner-parties\r\nand balls. And in fine summer weather, sir, like this, they sometimes\r\nhad lawn-parties and picnics--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cA picnic\xe2\x80\x99s just the thing to please her.\r\nRichard, you\xe2\x80\x99re an invaluable man; you may go downstairs again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRichard retired wondering, and Richard\xe2\x80\x99s master seized his ready pen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MISS MILROY--Since I left you it has suddenly struck me that we\r\nmight have a picnic. A little change and amusement (what I should call a\r\ngood shaking-up, if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t writing to a young lady) is just the thing\r\nfor you, after being so long indoors lately in Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s room. A\r\npicnic is a change, and (when the wine is good) amusement, too. Will\r\nyou ask the major if he will consent to the picnic, and come? And if\r\nyou have got any friends in the neighborhood who like a picnic, pray\r\nask them too, for I have got none. It shall be your picnic, but I will\r\nprovide everything and take everybody. You shall choose the day, and we\r\nwill picnic where you like. I have set my heart on this picnic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, ever yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cALLAN ARMADALE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOn reading over his composition before sealing it up, Allan frankly\r\nacknowledged to himself, this time, that it was not quite faultless.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Picnic\xe2\x80\x99 comes in a little too often,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; if she\r\nlikes the idea, she won\xe2\x80\x99t quarrel with that.\xe2\x80\x9d He sent off the letter on\r\nthe spot, with strict instructions to the messenger to wait for a reply.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour the answer came back on scented paper, without an\r\nerasure anywhere, fragrant to smell, and beautiful to see.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of the naked truth is one of those exhibitions from\r\nwhich the native delicacy of the female mind seems instinctively to\r\nrevolt. Never were the tables turned more completely than they were now\r\nturned on Allan by his fair correspondent. Machiavelli himself would\r\nnever have suspected, from Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s letter, how heartily she had\r\nrepented her petulance to the young squire as soon as his back was\r\nturned, and how extravagantly delighted she was when his invitation was\r\nplaced in her hands. Her letter was the composition of a model young\r\nlady whose emotions are all kept under parental lock and key, and served\r\nout for her judiciously as occasion may require. \xe2\x80\x9cPapa,\xe2\x80\x9d appeared quite\r\nas frequently in Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s reply as \xe2\x80\x9cpicnic\xe2\x80\x9d had appeared in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninvitation. \xe2\x80\x9cPapa\xe2\x80\x9d had been as considerately kind as Mr. Armadale in\r\nwishing to procure her a little change and amusement, and had offered\r\nto forego his usual quiet habits and join the picnic. With \xe2\x80\x9cpapa\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n sanction, therefore, she accepted, with much pleasure, Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproposal; and, at \xe2\x80\x9cpapa\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d suggestion, she would presume on Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s kindness to add two friends of theirs recently settled at\r\nThorpe Ambrose, to the picnic party--a widow lady and her son; the\r\nlatter in holy orders and in delicate health. If Tuesday next would suit\r\nMr. Armadale, Tuesday next would suit \xe2\x80\x9cpapa\xe2\x80\x9d--being the first day he\r\ncould spare from repairs which were required by his clock. The rest,\r\nby \xe2\x80\x9cpapa\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d advice, she would beg to leave entirely in Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands; and, in the meantime, she would remain, with \xe2\x80\x9cpapa\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n compliments, Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s truly--ELEANOR MILROY.\r\n\r\nWho would ever have supposed that the writer of that letter had jumped\r\nfor joy when Allan\xe2\x80\x99s invitation arrived? Who would ever have suspected\r\nthat there was an entry already in Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s diary, under that day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndate, to this effect: \xe2\x80\x9cThe sweetest, dearest letter from _I-know-who_;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll never behave unkindly to him again as long as I live?\xe2\x80\x9d As for\r\nAllan, he was charmed with the sweet success of his maneuver. Miss\r\nMilroy had accepted his invitation; consequently, Miss Milroy was\r\nnot offended with him. It was on the tip of his tongue to mention the\r\ncorrespondence to his friend when they met at dinner. But there was\r\nsomething in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s face and manner (even plain enough for Allan to\r\nsee) which warned him to wait a little before he said anything to revive\r\nthe painful subject of their visit to the cottage. By common consent\r\nthey both avoided all topics connected with Thorpe Ambrose, not even\r\nthe visit from Mr. Bashwood, which was to come with the evening, being\r\nreferred to by either of them. All through the dinner they drifted\r\nfurther and further back into the old endless talk of past times about\r\nships and sailing. When the butler withdrew from his attendance at\r\ntable, he came downstairs with a nautical problem on his mind, and asked\r\nhis fellow-servants if they any of them knew the relative merits \xe2\x80\x9con a\r\nwind\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9coff a wind\xe2\x80\x9d of a schooner and a brig.\r\n\r\nThe two young men had sat longer at table than usual that day. When they\r\nwent out into the garden with their cigars, the summer twilight fell\r\ngray and dim on lawn and flower bed, and narrowed round them by slow\r\ndegrees the softly fading circle of the distant view. The dew was heavy,\r\nand, after a few minutes in the garden, they agreed to go back to the\r\ndrier ground on the drive in front of the house.\r\n\r\nThey were close to the turning which led into the shrubbery, when there\r\nsuddenly glided out on them, from behind the foliage, a softly stepping\r\nblack figure--a shadow, moving darkly through the dim evening light.\r\nMidwinter started back at the sight of it, and even the less finely\r\nstrung nerves of his friend were shaken for the moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil are you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan.\r\n\r\nThe figure bared its head in the gray light, and came slowly a step\r\nnearer. Midwinter advanced a step on his side, and looked closer. It was\r\nthe man of the timid manners and the mourning garments, of whom he had\r\nasked the way to Thorpe Ambrose where the three roads met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI humbly beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered the stranger, stepping back\r\nagain, confusedly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe servants told me I should find Mr. Armadale--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, are you Mr. Bashwood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you please, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon for speaking to you so roughly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the\r\nfact is, you rather startled me. My name is Armadale (put on your hat,\r\npray), and this is my friend, Mr. Midwinter, who wants your help in the\r\nsteward\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe hardly stand in need of an introduction,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cI met Mr.\r\nBashwood out walking a few days since, and he was kind enough to direct\r\nme when I had lost my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut on your hat,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Allan, as Mr. Bashwood, still bareheaded,\r\nstood bowing speechlessly, now to one of the young men, and now to the\r\nother. \xe2\x80\x9cMy good sir, put on your hat, and let me show you the way back\r\nto the house. Excuse me for noticing it,\xe2\x80\x9d added Allan, as the man, in\r\nsheer nervous helplessness, let his hat fall, instead of putting it back\r\non his head; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you seem a little out of sorts; a glass of good\r\nwine will do you no harm before you and my friend come to business.\r\nWhereabouts did you meet with Mr. Bashwood, Midwinter, when you lost\r\nyour way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am too ignorant of the neighborhood to know. I must refer you to Mr.\r\nBashwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, tell us where it was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, trying, a little too abruptly,\r\nto set the man at his ease, as they all three walked back to the house.\r\n\r\nThe measure of Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional timidity seemed to be\r\nfilled to the brim by the loudness of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s voice and the bluntness of\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s request. He ran over in the same feeble flow of words with which\r\nhe had deluged Midwinter on the occasion when they first met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was on the road, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, addressing himself alternately to\r\nAllan, whom he called, \xe2\x80\x9csir,\xe2\x80\x9d and to Midwinter, whom he called by\r\nhis name, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, if you please, on the road to Little Gill Beck. A\r\nsingular name, Mr. Midwinter, and a singular place; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nthe village; I mean the neighborhood--I mean the \xe2\x80\x98Broads\xe2\x80\x99 beyond the\r\nneighborhood. Perhaps you may have heard of the Norfolk Broads, sir?\r\nWhat they call lakes in other parts of England, they call Broads here.\r\nThe Broads are quite numerous; I think they would repay a visit. You\r\nwould have seen the first of them, Mr. Midwinter, if you had walked on\r\na few miles from where I had the honor of meeting you. Remarkably\r\nnumerous, the Broads, sir--situated between this and the sea. About\r\nthree miles from the sea, Mr. Midwinter--about three miles. Mostly\r\nshallow, sir, with rivers running between them. Beautiful; solitary.\r\nQuite a watery country, Mr. Midwinter; quite separate, as it were, in\r\nitself. Parties sometimes visit them, sir--pleasure parties in boats.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite a little network of lakes, or, perhaps--yes, perhaps, more\r\ncorrectly, pools. There is good sport in the cold weather. The wild fowl\r\nare quite numerous. Yes; the Broads would repay a visit, Mr. Midwinter.\r\nThe next time you are walking that way. The distance from here to Little\r\nGill Beck, and then from Little Gill Beck to Girdler Broad, which is the\r\nfirst you come to, is altogether not more--\xe2\x80\x9d In sheer nervous inability\r\nto leave off, he would apparently have gone on talking of the Norfolk\r\nBroads for the rest of the evening, if one of his two listeners had not\r\nunceremoniously cut him short before he could find his way into a new\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the Broads within an easy day\xe2\x80\x99s drive there and back from this\r\nhouse?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan, feeling, if they were, that the place for the\r\npicnic was discovered already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, sir; a nice drive--quite a nice easy drive from this beautiful\r\nplace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were by this time ascending the portico steps, Allan leading the\r\nway up, and calling to Midwinter and Mr. Bashwood to follow him into the\r\nlibrary, where there was a lighted lamp.\r\n\r\nIn the interval which elapsed before the wine made its appearance,\r\nMidwinter looked at his chance acquaintance of the high-road with\r\nstrangely mingled feelings of compassion and distrust--of compassion\r\nthat strengthened in spite of him; of distrust that persisted in\r\ndiminishing, try as he might to encourage it to grow. There, perched\r\ncomfortless on the edge of his chair, sat the poor broken-down, nervous\r\nwretch, in his worn black garments, with his watery eyes, his honest old\r\noutspoken wig, his miserable mohair stock, and his false teeth that were\r\nincapable of deceiving anybody--there he sat, politely ill at ease;\r\nnow shrinking in the glare of the lamp, now wincing under the shock\r\nof Allan\xe2\x80\x99s sturdy voice; a man with the wrinkles of sixty years in his\r\nface, and the manners of a child in the presence of strangers; an object\r\nof pity surely, if ever there was a pitiable object yet!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever else you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of, Mr. Bashwood,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, pouring out\r\na glass of wine, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of that! There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a headache in\r\na hogshead of it! Make yourself comfortable; I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you and Mr.\r\nMidwinter to talk your business over by yourselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s all in Mr.\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s hands; he acts for me, and settles everything at his own\r\ndiscretion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said those words with a cautious choice of expression very\r\nuncharacteristic of him, and, without further explanation, made abruptly\r\nfor the door. Midwinter, sitting near it, noticed his face as he went\r\nout. Easy as the way was into Allan\xe2\x80\x99s favor, Mr. Bashwood, beyond all\r\nkind of doubt, had in some unaccountable manner failed to find it!\r\n\r\nThe two strangely assorted companions were left together--parted widely,\r\nas it seemed on the surface, from any possible interchange of sympathy;\r\ndrawn invisibly one to the other, nevertheless, by those magnetic\r\nsimilarities of temperament which overleap all difference of age or\r\nstation, and defy all apparent incongruities of mind and character. From\r\nthe moment when Allan left the room, the hidden Influence that works\r\nin darkness began slowly to draw the two men together, across the great\r\nsocial desert which had lain between them up to this day.\r\n\r\nMidwinter was the first to approach the subject of the interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cif you have been made acquainted with\r\nmy position here, and if you know why it is that I require your\r\nassistance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood--still hesitating and still timid, but manifestly relieved\r\nby Allan\xe2\x80\x99s departure--sat further back in his chair, and ventured on\r\nfortifying himself with a modest little sip of wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pedgift informed me of all--at least I\r\nthink I may say so--of all the circumstances. I am to instruct, or\r\nperhaps, I ought to say to advise--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Bashwood; the first word was the best word of the two. I am\r\nquite ignorant of the duties which Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s kindness has induced\r\nhim to intrust to me. If I understand right, there can be no question of\r\nyour capacity to instruct me, for you once filled a steward\xe2\x80\x99s situation\r\nyourself. May I inquire where it was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Sir John Mellowship\xe2\x80\x99s, sir, in West Norfolk. Perhaps you would\r\nlike--I have got it with me--to see my testimonial? Sir John might have\r\ndealt more kindly with me; but I have no complaint to make; it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\ndone and over now!\xe2\x80\x9d His watery eyes looked more watery still, and the\r\ntrembling in his hands spread to his lips as he produced an old dingy\r\nletter from his pocket-book and laid it open on the table.\r\n\r\nThe testimonial was very briefly and very coldly expressed, but it was\r\nconclusive as far as it went. Sir John considered it only right to say\r\nthat he had no complaint to make of any want of capacity or integrity\r\nin his steward. If Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s domestic position had been compatible\r\nwith the continued performance of his duties on the estate, Sir John\r\nwould have been glad to keep him. As it was, embarrassments caused by\r\nthe state of Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s personal affairs had rendered it undesirable\r\nthat he should continue in Sir John\xe2\x80\x99s service; and on that ground, and\r\nthat only, his employer and he had parted. Such was Sir John\xe2\x80\x99s testimony\r\nto Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s character. As Midwinter read the last lines, he\r\nthought of another testimonial, still in his own possession--of the\r\nwritten character which they had given him at the school, when\r\nthey turned their sick usher adrift in the world. His superstition\r\n(distrusting all new events and all new faces at Thorpe Ambrose) still\r\ndoubted the man before him as obstinately as ever. But when he now tried\r\nto put those doubts into words, his heart upbraided him, and he laid the\r\nletter on the table in silence.\r\n\r\nThe sudden pause in the conversation appeared to startle Mr. Bashwood.\r\nHe comforted himself with another little sip of wine, and, leaving the\r\nletter untouched, burst irrepressibly into words, as if the silence was\r\nquite unendurable to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready to answer any question, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pedgift told\r\nme that I must answer questions, because I was applying for a place of\r\ntrust. Mr. Pedgift said neither you nor Mr. Armadale was likely to think\r\nthe testimonial sufficient of itself. Sir John doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say--he might\r\nhave put it more kindly, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain--Sir John doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nwhat the troubles were that lost me my place. Perhaps you might wish to\r\nknow--\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped confusedly, looked at the testimonial, and said no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf no interests but mine were concerned in the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined\r\nMidwinter, \xe2\x80\x9cthe testimonial would, I assure you, be quite enough to\r\nsatisfy me. But while I am learning my new duties, the person who\r\nteaches me will be really and truly the steward of my friend\xe2\x80\x99s estate. I\r\nam very unwilling to ask you to speak on what may be a painful subject,\r\nand I am sadly inexperienced in putting such questions as I ought\r\nto put; but, perhaps, in Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s interests, I ought to know\r\nsomething more, either from yourself, or from Mr. Pedgift, if you prefer\r\nit--\xe2\x80\x9d He, too, stopped confusedly, looked at the testimonial, and said\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nThere was another moment of silence. The night was warm, and Mr.\r\nBashwood, among his other misfortunes, had the deplorable infirmity of\r\nperspiring in the palms of the hands. He took out a miserable little\r\ncotton pocket-handkerchief, rolled it up into a ball, and softly dabbed\r\nit to and fro, from one hand to the other, with the regularity of a\r\npendulum. Performed by other men, under other circumstances, the action\r\nmight have been ridiculous. Performed by this man, at the crisis of the\r\ninterview, the action was horrible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s time is too valuable, sir, to be wasted on me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will mention what ought to be mentioned myself--if you will please to\r\nallow me. I have been unfortunate in my family. It is very hard to bear,\r\nthough it seems not much to tell. My wife--\xe2\x80\x9d One of his hands closed\r\nfast on the pocket-handkerchief; he moistened his dry lips, struggled\r\nwith himself, and went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cstood a little in my way; she did me (I am\r\nafraid I must confess) some injury with Sir John. Soon after I got the\r\nsteward\xe2\x80\x99s situation, she contracted--she took--she fell into habits (I\r\nhardly know how to say it) of drinking. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t break her of it, and\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t always conceal it from Sir John\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge. She broke out,\r\nand--and tried his patience once or twice, when he came to my office on\r\nbusiness. Sir John excused it, not very kindly; but still he excused\r\nit. I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain of Sir John! I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain now of my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npointed a trembling finger at his miserable crape-covered beaver hat on\r\nthe floor. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in mourning for her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe died nearly\r\na year ago, in the county asylum here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mouth began to work convulsively. He took up the glass of wine\r\nat his side, and, instead of sipping it this time, drained it to\r\nthe bottom. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not much used to wine, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, conscious,\r\napparently, of the flush that flew into his face as he drank, and still\r\nobservant of the obligations of politeness amid all the misery of the\r\nrecollections that he was calling up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg, Mr. Bashwood, you will not distress yourself by telling me any\r\nmore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, recoiling from any further sanction on his part\r\nof a disclosure which had already bared the sorrows of the unhappy man\r\nbefore him to the quick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bashwood. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndetain you too long, and if you will please to remember that Mr.\r\nPedgift\xe2\x80\x99s directions to me were very particular--and, besides, I only\r\nmentioned my late wife because if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t tried Sir John\xe2\x80\x99s patience\r\nto begin with, things might have turned out differently--\xe2\x80\x9d He paused,\r\ngave up the disjointed sentence in which he had involved himself, and\r\ntried another. \xe2\x80\x9cI had only two children, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, advancing to\r\na new point in his narrative, \xe2\x80\x9ca boy and a girl. The girl died when she\r\nwas a baby. My son lived to grow up; and it was my son who lost me my\r\nplace. I did my best for him; I got him into a respectable office in\r\nLondon. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take him without security. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it was\r\nimprudent; but I had no rich friends to help me, and I became security.\r\nMy boy turned out badly, sir. He--perhaps you will kindly understand\r\nwhat I mean, if I say he behaved dishonestly. His employers consented,\r\nat my entreaty, to let him off without prosecuting. I begged very\r\nhard--I was fond of my son James--and I took him home, and did my best\r\nto reform him. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay with me; he went away again to London;\r\nhe--I beg your pardon, sir! I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m confusing things; I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m wandering from the point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you think it right to tell me this\r\nsad story, tell it in your own way. Have you seen your son since he left\r\nyou to go to London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. He\xe2\x80\x99s in London still, for all I know. When I last heard of\r\nhim, he was getting his bread--not very creditably. He was employed,\r\nunder the inspector, at the Private Inquiry Office in Shadyside Place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke those words--apparently (as events then stood) the most\r\nirrelevant to the matter in hand that had yet escaped him; actually (as\r\nevents were soon to be) the most vitally important that he had uttered\r\nyet--he spoke those words absently, looking about him in confusion, and\r\ntrying vainly to recover the lost thread of his narrative.\r\n\r\nMidwinter compassionately helped him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were telling me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat your son had been the cause of your losing your place. How did\r\nthat happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this way, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bashwood, getting back again excitedly into\r\nthe right train of thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHis employers consented to let him off; but\r\nthey came down on his security; and I was the man. I suppose they were\r\nnot to blame; the security covered their loss. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay it all out\r\nof my savings; I had to borrow--on the word of a man, sir, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it--I had to borrow. My creditor pressed me; it seemed cruel, but,\r\nif he wanted the money, I suppose it was only just. I was sold out of\r\nhouse and home. I dare say other gentlemen would have said what Sir John\r\nsaid; I dare say most people would have refused to keep a steward\r\nwho had had the bailiffs after him, and his furniture sold in the\r\nneighborhood. That was how it ended, Mr. Midwinter. I needn\xe2\x80\x99t detain you\r\nany longer--here is Sir John\xe2\x80\x99s address, if you wish to apply to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Midwinter generously refused to receive the address.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you kindly, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bashwood, getting tremulously on his\r\nlegs. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing more, I think, except--except that Mr. Pedgift\r\nwill speak for me, if you wish to inquire into my conduct in his\r\nservice. I\xe2\x80\x99m very much indebted to Mr. Pedgift; he\xe2\x80\x99s a little rough\r\nwith me sometimes, but, if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken me into his office, I think I\r\nshould have gone to the workhouse when I left Sir John, I was so broken\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d He picked up his dingy old hat from the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t intrude\r\nany longer, sir. I shall be happy to call again if you wish to have time\r\nto consider before you decide-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want no time to consider after what you have told me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMidwinter, warmly, his memory busy, while he spoke, with the time when\r\n_he_ had told _his_ story to Mr. Brock, and was waiting for a generous\r\nword in return, as the man before him was waiting now. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day is\r\nSaturday,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you come and give me my first lesson\r\non Monday morning? I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, interrupting Mr.\r\nBashwood\xe2\x80\x99s profuse expressions of acknowledgment, and stopping him on\r\nhis way out of the room; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is one thing we ought to settle, ought\r\nwe not? We haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken yet about your own interest in this matter;\r\nI mean, about the terms.\xe2\x80\x9d He referred, a little confusedly, to the\r\npecuniary part of the subject. Mr. Bashwood (getting nearer and nearer\r\nto the door) answered him more confusedly still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything, sir--anything you think right. I won\xe2\x80\x99t intrude any longer;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to you and Mr. Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will send for Mr. Armadale, if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, following\r\nhim into the hall. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am afraid he has as little experience in\r\nmatters of this kind as I have. Perhaps, if you see no objection, we\r\nmight be guided by Mr. Pedgift?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood caught eagerly at the last suggestion, pushing his retreat,\r\nwhile he spoke, as far as the front door. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir--oh, yes, yes!\r\nnobody better than Mr. Pedgift. Don\xe2\x80\x99t--pray don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb Mr. Armadale!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n His watery eyes looked quite wild with nervous alarm as he turned round\r\nfor a moment in the light of the hall lamp to make that polite request.\r\nIf sending for Allan had been equivalent to unchaining a ferocious\r\nwatch-dog, Mr. Bashwood could hardly have been more anxious to stop the\r\nproceeding. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you kindly good-evening, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, getting\r\nout to the steps. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to you. I will be scrupulously\r\npunctual on Monday morning--I hope--I think--I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will soon\r\nlearn everything I can teach you. It\xe2\x80\x99s not difficult--oh dear, no--not\r\ndifficult at all! I wish you kindly good-evening, sir. A beautiful\r\nnight; yes, indeed, a beautiful night for a walk home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, all dropping out of his lips one on the top of the\r\nother, and without noticing, in his agony of embarrassment at effecting\r\nhis departure, Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s outstretched hand, he went noiselessly down\r\nthe steps, and was lost in the darkness of the night.\r\n\r\nAs Midwinter turned to re-enter the house, the dining-room door opened\r\nand his friend met him in the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Mr. Bashwood gone?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Midwinter, \xe2\x80\x9cafter telling me a very sad story,\r\nand leaving me a little ashamed of myself for having doubted him without\r\nany just cause. I have arranged that he is to give me my first lesson in\r\nthe steward\xe2\x80\x99s office on Monday morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, old boy, of my\r\ninterrupting you over your studies. I dare say I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong--but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike Mr. Bashwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the other, a little petulantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sunday morning found Midwinter in the park, waiting to intercept the\r\npostman, on the chance of his bringing more news from Mr. Brock.\r\n\r\nAt the customary hour the man made his appearance, and placed the\r\nexpected letter in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s hands. He opened it, far away from all\r\nfear of observation this time, and read these lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MIDWINTER--I write more for the purpose of quieting your\r\nanxiety than because I have anything definite to say. In my last hurried\r\nletter I had no time to tell you that the elder of the two women whom\r\nI met in the Gardens had followed me, and spoken to me in the street.\r\nI believe I may characterize what she said (without doing her any\r\ninjustice) as a tissue of falsehoods from beginning to end. At any rate,\r\nshe confirmed me in the suspicion that some underhand proceeding is on\r\nfoot, of which Allan is destined to be the victim, and that the prime\r\nmover in the conspiracy is the vile woman who helped his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarriage and who hastened his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeeling this conviction, I have not hesitated to do, for Allan\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nwhat I would have done for no other creature in the world. I have left\r\nmy hotel, and have installed myself (with my old servant Robert) in\r\na house opposite the house to which I traced the two women. We are\r\nalternately on the watch (quite unsuspected, I am certain, by the\r\npeople opposite) day and night. All my feelings, as a gentleman and a\r\nclergyman, revolt from such an occupation as I am now engaged in; but\r\nthere is no other choice. I must either do this violence to my own\r\nself-respect, or I must leave Allan, with his easy nature, and in his\r\nassailable position, to defend himself against a wretch who is prepared,\r\nI firmly believe, to take the most unscrupulous advantage of his\r\nweakness and his youth. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s dying entreaty has never left my\r\nmemory; and, God help me, I am now degrading myself in my own eyes in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been some reward already for the sacrifice. This day\r\n(Saturday) I have gained an immense advantage--I have at last seen the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s face. She went out with her veil down as before; and Robert kept\r\nher in view, having my instructions, if she returned to the house, not\r\nto follow her back to the door. She did return to the house; and the\r\nresult of my precaution was, as I had expected, to throw her off her\r\nguard. I saw her face unveiled at the window, and afterward again in the\r\nbalcony. If any occasion should arise for describing her particularly,\r\nyou shall have the description. At present I need only say that she\r\nlooks the full age (five-and-thirty) at which you estimated her, and\r\nthat she is by no means so handsome a woman as I had (I hardly know why)\r\nexpected to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all I can now tell you. If nothing more happens by Monday or\r\nTuesday next, I shall have no choice but to apply to my lawyers for\r\nassistance; though I am most unwilling to trust this delicate and\r\ndangerous matter in other hands than mine. Setting my own feelings\r\nhowever, out of the question, the business which has been the cause of\r\nmy journey to London is too important to be trifled with much longer as\r\nI am trifling with it now. In any and every case, depend on my keeping\r\nyou informed of the progress of events, and believe me yours truly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDECIMUS BROCK.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMidwinter secured the letter as he had secured the letter that preceded\r\nit--side by side in his pocket-book with the narrative of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s Dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many days more?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself, as he went back to the house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many days more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot many. The time he was waiting for was a time close at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday came, and brought Mr. Bashwood, punctual to the appointed hour.\r\nMonday came, and found Allan immersed in his preparations for the\r\npicnic. He held a series of interviews, at home and abroad, all through\r\nthe day. He transacted business with Mrs. Gripper, with the butler,\r\nand with the coachman, in their three several departments of eating,\r\ndrinking, and driving. He went to the town to consult his professional\r\nadvisers on the subject of the Broads, and to invite both the lawyers,\r\nfather and son (in the absence of anybody else in the neighborhood whom\r\nhe could ask), to join the picnic. Pedgift Senior (in his department)\r\nsupplied general information, but begged to be excused from appearing at\r\nthe picnic, on the score of business engagements. Pedgift Junior (in his\r\ndepartment) added all the details; and, casting business engagements to\r\nthe winds, accepted the invitation with the greatest pleasure. Returning\r\nfrom the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s office, Allan\xe2\x80\x99s next proceeding was to go to the\r\nmajor\xe2\x80\x99s cottage and obtain Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s approval of the proposed\r\nlocality for the pleasure party. This object accomplished, he returned\r\nto his own house, to meet the last difficulty now left to encounter--the\r\ndifficulty of persuading Midwinter to join the expedition to the Broads.\r\n\r\nOn first broaching the subject, Allan found his friend impenetrably\r\nresolute to remain at home. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s natural reluctance to meet the\r\nmajor and his daughter after what had happened at the cottage, might\r\nprobably have been overcome. But Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s determination not to allow\r\nMr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s course of instruction to be interrupted was proof\r\nagainst every effort that could be made to shake it. After exerting his\r\ninfluence to the utmost, Allan was obliged to remain contented with a\r\ncompromise. Midwinter promised, not very willingly, to join the party\r\ntoward evening, at the place appointed for a gypsy tea-making, which was\r\nto close the proceedings of the day. To this extent he would consent to\r\ntake the opportunity of placing himself on a friendly footing with the\r\nMilroys. More he could not concede, even to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s persuasion, and for\r\nmore it would be useless to ask.\r\n\r\nThe day of the picnic came. The lovely morning, and the cheerful bustle\r\nof preparation for the expedition, failed entirely to tempt Midwinter\r\ninto altering his resolution. At the regular hour he left the\r\nbreakfast-table to join Mr. Bashwood in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office. The two\r\nwere quietly closeted over the books, at the back of the house, while\r\nthe packing for the picnic went on in front. Young Pedgift (short in\r\nstature, smart in costume, and self-reliant in manner) arrived\r\nsome little time before the hour for starting, to revise all the\r\narrangements, and to make any final improvements which his local\r\nknowledge might suggest. Allan and he were still busy in consultation\r\nwhen the first hitch occurred in the proceedings. The woman-servant from\r\nthe cottage was reported to be waiting below for an answer to a note\r\nfrom her young mistress, which was placed in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s emotions had apparently got the better\r\nof her sense of propriety. The tone of the letter was feverish, and the\r\nhandwriting wandered crookedly up and down in deplorable freedom from\r\nall proper restraint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x9d (wrote the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter), \xe2\x80\x9csuch a misfortune!\r\nWhat _are_ we to do? Papa has got a letter from grandmamma this morning\r\nabout the new governess. Her reference has answered all the questions,\r\nand she\xe2\x80\x99s ready to come at the shortest notice. Grandmamma thinks (how\r\nprovoking!) the sooner the better; and she says we may expect her--I\r\nmean the governess--either to-day or to-morrow. Papa says (he _will_ be\r\nso absurdly considerate to everybody!) that we can\xe2\x80\x99t allow Miss Gwilt to\r\ncome here (if she comes to-day) and find nobody at home to receive her.\r\nWhat is to be done? I am ready to cry with vexation. I have got the\r\nworst possible impression (though grandmamma says she is a charming\r\nperson) of Miss Gwilt. _Can_ you suggest something, dear Mr. Armadale?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure papa would give way if you could. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop to write; send me\r\na message back. I have got a new hat for the picnic; and oh, the agony\r\nof not knowing whether I am to keep it on or take it off. Yours truly,\r\nE. M.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take Miss Gwilt!\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, staring at his legal adviser in\r\na state of helpless consternation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart, sir--I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to interfere,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pedgift\r\nJunior. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan told him. Mr. Pedgift the younger might have his faults, but a\r\nwant of quickness of resource was not among them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a way out of the difficulty, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the\r\ngoverness comes to-day, let\xe2\x80\x99s have her at the picnic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened wide in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the horses and carriages in the Thorpe Ambrose stables are not\r\nwanted for this small party of ours,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Pedgift Junior. \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse not! Very good. If Miss Gwilt comes to-day, she can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly\r\nget here before five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Good again. You order an open carriage to\r\nbe waiting at the major\xe2\x80\x99s door at that time, Mr. Armadale, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give\r\nthe man his directions where to drive to. When the governess comes to\r\nthe cottage, let her find a nice little note of apology (along with the\r\ncold fowl, or whatever else they give her after her journey) begging\r\nher to join us at the picnic, and putting a carriage at her own sole\r\ndisposal to take her there. Gad, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said young Pedgift, gayly, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\r\n_must_ be a Touchy One if she thinks herself neglected after that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cShe shall have every attention. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give her\r\nthe pony-chaise and the white harness, and she shall drive herself, if\r\nshe likes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe scribbled a line to relieve Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s apprehensions, and gave the\r\nnecessary orders for the pony-chaise. Ten minutes later, the carriages\r\nfor the pleasure party were at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken all this trouble about her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, reverting to\r\nthe governess as they left the house, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder, if she does come to-day,\r\nwhether we shall see her at the picnic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDepends, entirely on her age, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked young Pedgift, pronouncing\r\njudgment with the happy confidence in himself which eminently\r\ndistinguished him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she\xe2\x80\x99s an old one, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be knocked up with the\r\njourney, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll stick to the cold fowl and the cottage. If she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na young one, either I know nothing of women, or the pony in the white\r\nharness will bring her to the picnic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey started for the major\xe2\x80\x99s cottage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE NORFOLK BROADS.\r\n\r\nThe little group gathered together in Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s parlor to wait for\r\nthe carriages from Thorpe Ambrose would hardly have conveyed the idea,\r\nto any previously uninstructed person introduced among them, of a party\r\nassembled in expectation of a picnic. They were almost dull enough,\r\nas far as outward appearances went, to have been a party assembled in\r\nexpectation of a marriage.\r\n\r\nEven Miss Milroy herself, though conscious, of looking her best in\r\nher bright muslin dress and her gayly feathered new hat, was at this\r\ninauspicious moment Miss Milroy under a cloud. Although Allan\xe2\x80\x99s note had\r\nassured her, in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s strongest language, that the one great object of\r\nreconciling the governess\xe2\x80\x99s arrival with the celebration of the picnic\r\nwas an object achieved, the doubt still remained whether the plan\r\nproposed--whatever it might be--would meet with her father\xe2\x80\x99s approval.\r\nIn a word, Miss Milroy declined to feel sure of her day\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure until\r\nthe carriage made its appearance and took her from the door. The major,\r\non his side, arrayed for the festive occasion in a tight blue frock-coat\r\nwhich he had not worn for years, and threatened with a whole long day of\r\nseparation from his old friend and comrade the clock, was a man out of\r\nhis element, if ever such a man existed yet. As for the friends who had\r\nbeen asked at Allan\xe2\x80\x99s request--the widow lady (otherwise Mrs. Pentecost)\r\nand her son (the Reverend Samuel) in delicate health--two people less\r\ncapable, apparently of adding to the hilarity of the day could hardly\r\nhave been discovered in the length and breadth of all England. A young\r\nman who plays his part in society by looking on in green spectacles, and\r\nlistening with a sickly smile, may be a prodigy of intellect and a mine\r\nof virtue, but he is hardly, perhaps, the right sort of man to have at\r\na picnic. An old lady afflicted with deafness, whose one inexhaustible\r\nsubject of interest is the subject of her son, and who (on the happily\r\nrare occasions when that son opens his lips) asks everybody eagerly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does my boy say?\xe2\x80\x9d is a person to be pitied in respect of her\r\ninfirmities, and a person to be admired in respect of her maternal\r\ndevotedness, but not a person, if the thing could possibly be avoided,\r\nto take to a picnic. Such a man, nevertheless, was the Reverend Samuel\r\nPentecost, and such a woman was the Reverend Samuel\xe2\x80\x99s mother; and in the\r\ndearth of any other producible guests, there they were, engaged to eat,\r\ndrink, and be merry for the day at Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure party to the\r\nNorfolk Broads.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Allan, with his faithful follower, Pedgift Junior, at his\r\nheels, roused the flagging spirits of the party at the cottage. The plan\r\nfor enabling the governess to join the picnic, if she arrived that day,\r\nsatisfied even Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety to show all proper attention to\r\nthe lady who was coming into his house. After writing the necessary\r\nnote of apology and invitation, and addressing it in her very best\r\nhandwriting to the new governess, Miss Milroy ran upstairs to say\r\ngood-by to her mother, and returned with a smiling face and a side look\r\nof relief directed at her father, to announce that there was nothing\r\nnow to keep any of them a moment longer indoors. The company at once\r\ndirected their steps to the garden gate, and were there met face to face\r\nby the second great difficulty of the day. How were the six persons of\r\nthe picnic to be divided between the two open carriages that were in\r\nwaiting for them?\r\n\r\nHere, again, Pedgift Junior exhibited his invaluable faculty of\r\ncontrivance. This highly cultivated young man possessed in an eminent\r\ndegree an accomplishment more or less peculiar to all the young men\r\nof the age we live in: he was perfectly capable of taking his pleasure\r\nwithout forgetting his business. Such a client as the Master of Thorpe\r\nAmbrose fell but seldom in his father\xe2\x80\x99s way, and to pay special but\r\nunobtrusive attention to Allan all through the day was the business of\r\nwhich young Pedgift, while proving himself to be the life and soul of\r\nthe picnic, never once lost sight from the beginning of the merry-making\r\nto the end. He had detected the state of affairs between Miss Milroy and\r\nAllan at glance, and he at once provided for his client\xe2\x80\x99s inclinations\r\nin that quarter by offering, in virtue of his local knowledge, to lead\r\nthe way in the first carriage, and by asking Major Milroy and the curate\r\nif they would do him the honor of accompanying him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall pass a very interesting place to a military man, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nyoung Pedgift, addressing the major, with his happy and unblushing\r\nconfidence--\xe2\x80\x9cthe remains of a Roman encampment. And my father, sir, who\r\nis a subscriber,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded this rising lawyer, turning to the curate,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwished me to ask your opinion of the new Infant School buildings at\r\nLittle Gill Beck. Would you kindly give it me as we go along?\xe2\x80\x9d He opened\r\nthe carriage door, and helped in the major and the curate before they\r\ncould either of them start any difficulties. The necessary result\r\nfollowed. Allan and Miss Milroy rode together in the same carriage,\r\nwith the extra convenience of a deaf old lady in attendance to keep the\r\nsquire\xe2\x80\x99s compliments within the necessary limits.\r\n\r\nNever yet had Allan enjoyed such an interview with Miss Milroy as the\r\ninterview he now obtained on the road to the Broads.\r\n\r\nThe dear old lady, after a little anecdote or two on the subject of her\r\nson, did the one thing wanting to secure the perfect felicity of her two\r\nyouthful companions: she became considerately blind for the occasion, as\r\nwell as deaf. A quarter of an hour after the carriage left the major\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncottage, the poor old soul, reposing on snug cushions, and fanned by a\r\nfine summer air, fell peaceably asleep. Allan made love, and Miss Milroy\r\nsanctioned the manufacture of that occasionally precious article of\r\nhuman commerce, sublimely indifferent on both sides to a solemn bass\r\naccompaniment on two notes, played by the curate\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s unsuspecting\r\nnose. The only interruption to the love-making (the snoring, being a\r\nthing more grave and permanent in its nature, was not interrupted at\r\nall) came at intervals from the carriage ahead. Not satisfied with\r\nhaving the major\xe2\x80\x99s Roman encampment and the curate\xe2\x80\x99s Infant Schools on\r\nhis mind, Pedgift Junior rose erect from time to time in his place, and,\r\nrespectfully hailing the hindmost vehicle, directed Allan\xe2\x80\x99s attention,\r\nin a shrill tenor voice, and with an excellent choice of language,\r\nto objects of interest on the road. The only way to quiet him was to\r\nanswer, which Allan invariably did by shouting back, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n upon which young Pedgift disappeared again in the recesses of the\r\nleading carriage, and took up the Romans and the Infants where he had\r\nleft them last.\r\n\r\nThe scene through which the picnic party was now passing merited far\r\nmore attention than it received either from Allan or Allan\xe2\x80\x99s friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour\xe2\x80\x99s steady driving from the major\xe2\x80\x99s cottage had taken young\r\nArmadale and his guests beyond the limits of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s solitary walk,\r\nand was now bringing them nearer and nearer to one of the strangest and\r\nloveliest aspects of nature which the inland landscape, not of Norfolk\r\nonly, but of all England, can show. Little by little the face of the\r\ncountry began to change as the carriages approached the remote and\r\nlonely district of the Broads. The wheat fields and turnip fields became\r\nperceptibly fewer, and the fat green grazing grounds on either side grew\r\nwider and wider in their smooth and sweeping range. Heaps of dry rushes\r\nand reeds, laid up for the basket-maker and the thatcher, began to\r\nappear at the road-side. The old gabled cottages of the early part of\r\nthe drive dwindled and disappeared, and huts with mud walls rose in\r\ntheir place. With the ancient church towers and the wind and water\r\nmills, which had hitherto been the only lofty objects seen over the\r\nlow marshy flat, there now rose all round the horizon, gliding slow and\r\ndistant behind fringes of pollard willows, the sails of invisible boats\r\nmoving on invisible waters. All the strange and startling anomalies\r\npresented by an inland agricultural district, isolated from\r\nother districts by its intricate surrounding network of pools and\r\nstreams--holding its communications and carrying its produce by water\r\ninstead of by land--began to present themselves in closer and closer\r\nsuccession. Nets appeared on cottage pailings; little flat-bottomed\r\nboats lay strangely at rest among the flowers in cottage gardens;\r\nfarmers\xe2\x80\x99 men passed to and fro clad in composite costume of the coast\r\nand the field, in sailors\xe2\x80\x99 hats, and fishermen\xe2\x80\x99s boots, and plowmen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsmocks; and even yet the low-lying labyrinth of waters, embosomed in its\r\nmystery of solitude, was a hidden labyrinth still. A minute more, and\r\nthe carriages took a sudden turn from the hard high-road into a little\r\nweedy lane. The wheels ran noiseless on the damp and spongy ground. A\r\nlonely outlying cottage appeared with its litter of nets and boats. A\r\nfew yards further on, and the last morsel of firm earth suddenly ended\r\nin a tiny creek and quay. One turn more to the end of the quay--and\r\nthere, spreading its great sheet of water, far and bright and smooth,\r\non the right hand and the left--there, as pure in its spotless blue, as\r\nstill in its heavenly peacefulness, as the summer sky above it, was the\r\nfirst of the Norfolk Broads.\r\n\r\nThe carriages stopped, the love-making broke off, and the venerable Mrs.\r\nPentecost, recovering the use of her senses at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, fixed\r\nher eyes sternly on Allan the instant she woke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see in your face, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nyou think I have been asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe consciousness of guilt acts differently on the two sexes. In nine\r\ncases out of ten, it is a much more manageable consciousness with a\r\nwoman than with a man. All the confusion, on this occasion, was on\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s side. While Allan reddened and looked embarrassed, the\r\nquick-witted Miss Milroy instantly embraced the old lady with a burst\r\nof innocent laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is quite incapable, dear Mrs. Pentecost,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe little hypocrite, \xe2\x80\x9cof anything so ridiculous as thinking you have\r\nbeen asleep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I wish Mr. Armadale to know,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the old lady, still\r\nsuspicious of Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cis, that my head being giddy, I am obliged to\r\nclose my eyes in a carriage. Closing the eyes, Mr. Armadale, is one\r\nthing, and going to sleep is another. Where is my son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Samuel appeared silently at the carriage door, and assisted\r\nhis mother to get out (\xe2\x80\x9cDid you enjoy the drive, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old\r\nlady. \xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful scenery, my dear, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d) Young Pedgift, on whom\r\nthe arrangements for exploring the Broads devolved, hustled about,\r\ngiving his orders to the boatman. Major Milroy, placid and patient, sat\r\napart on an overturned punt, and privately looked at his watch. Was it\r\npast noon already? More than an hour past. For the first time, for many\r\na long year, the famous clock at home had struck in an empty workshop.\r\nTime had lifted his wonderful scythe, and the corporal and his men had\r\nrelieved guard, with no master\xe2\x80\x99s eye to watch their performances, with\r\nno master\xe2\x80\x99s hand to encourage them to do their best. The major sighed\r\nas he put his watch back in his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m too old for this\r\nsort of thing,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the good man, looking about him dreamily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t find I enjoy it as much as I thought I should. When are we going\r\non the water, I wonder? Where\xe2\x80\x99s Neelie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeelie--more properly Miss Milroy--was behind one of the carriages\r\nwith the promoter of the picnic. They were immersed in the interesting\r\nsubject of their own Christian names, and Allan was as near a pointblank\r\nproposal of marriage as it is well possible for a thoughtless young\r\ngentleman of two-and-twenty to be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Milroy, with her eyes modestly riveted on\r\nthe ground. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you first knew what my name was, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\r\ndid you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like everything that belongs to you,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Allan, vigorously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink Eleanor is a beautiful name; and yet, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, I think\r\nthe major made an improvement when he changed it to Neelie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you why, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d said the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, with\r\ngreat gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are some unfortunate people in this world whose\r\nnames are--how can I express it?--whose names are misfits. Mine is a\r\nmisfit. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame my parents, for of course it was impossible to\r\nknow when I was a baby how I should grow up. But as things are, I and\r\nmy name don\xe2\x80\x99t fit each other. When you hear a young lady called Eleanor,\r\nyou think of a tall, beautiful, interesting creature directly--the\r\nvery opposite of _me_! With my personal appearance, Eleanor sounds\r\nridiculous; and Neelie, as you yourself remarked, is just the thing. No!\r\nno! don\xe2\x80\x99t say any more; I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of the subject. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got another\r\nname in my head, if we must speak of names, which is much better worth\r\ntalking about than mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stole a glance at her companion which said plainly enough, \xe2\x80\x9cThe name\r\nis yours.\xe2\x80\x9d Allan advanced a step nearer to her, and lowered his voice,\r\nwithout the slightest necessity, to a mysterious whisper. Miss Milroy\r\ninstantly resumed her investigation of the ground. She looked at it with\r\nsuch extraordinary interest that a geologist might have suspected her of\r\nscientific flirtation with the superficial strata.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat name are you thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan.\r\n\r\nMiss Milroy addressed her answer, in the form of a remark, to the\r\nsuperficial strata--and let them do what they liked with it, in their\r\ncapacity of conductors of sound. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had been a man,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould so like to have been called Allan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt his eyes on her as she spoke, and, turning her head aside,\r\nbecame absorbed in the graining of the panel at the back of the\r\ncarriage. \xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful it is!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with a sudden outburst\r\nof interest in the vast subject of varnish. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder how they do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMan persists, and woman yields. Allan declined to shift the ground from\r\nlove-making to coach-making. Miss Milroy dropped the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall me by my name, if you really like it,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, persuasively.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall me \xe2\x80\x98Allan\xe2\x80\x99 for once; just to try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated with a heightened color and a charming smile, and shook\r\nher head. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I call you Neelie? Is it too soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him again, with a sudden disturbance about the bosom of\r\nher dress, and a sudden flash of tenderness in her dark-gray eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know best,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly, in a whisper.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable answer was on the tip of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s tongue. At the very\r\ninstant, however, when he opened his lips, the abhorrent high tenor of\r\nPedgift Junior, shouting for \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d rang cheerfully through the\r\nquiet air. At the same moment, from the other side of the carriage, the\r\nlurid spectacles of the Reverend Samuel showed themselves officiously on\r\nthe search; and the voice of the Reverend Samuel\xe2\x80\x99s mother (who had, with\r\ngreat dexterity, put the two ideas of the presence of water and a sudden\r\nmovement among the company together) inquired distractedly if anybody\r\nwas drowned? Sentiment flies and Love shudders at all demonstrations of\r\nthe noisy kind. Allan said: \xe2\x80\x9cDamn it,\xe2\x80\x9d and rejoined young Pedgift. Miss\r\nMilroy sighed, and took refuge with her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it, Mr. Armadale!\xe2\x80\x9d cried young Pedgift, greeting his patron\r\ngayly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can all go on the water together; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the biggest boat\r\non the Broads. The little skiffs,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a lower tone, as he led\r\nthe way to the quay steps, \xe2\x80\x9cbesides being ticklish and easily upset,\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t hold more than two, with the boatman; and the major told me he\r\nshould feel it his duty to go with his daughter, if we all separated in\r\ndifferent boats. I thought _that_ would hardly do, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Pedgift\r\nJunior, with a respectfully sly emphasis on the words. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, besides, if\r\nwe had put the old lady into a skiff, with her weight (sixteen stone if\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s a pound), we might have had her upside down in the water half her\r\ntime, which would have occasioned delay, and thrown what you call a damp\r\non the proceedings. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the boat, Mr. Armadale. What do you think of\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat added one more to the strangely anomalous objects which\r\nappeared at the Broads. It was nothing less than a stout old lifeboat,\r\npassing its last declining years on the smooth fresh water, after the\r\nstormy days of its youth time on the wild salt sea. A comfortable\r\nlittle cabin for the use of fowlers in the winter season had been built\r\namidships, and a mast and sail adapted for inland navigation had been\r\nfitted forward. There was room enough and to spare for the guests,\r\nthe dinner, and the three men in charge. Allan clapped his faithful\r\nlieutenant approvingly on the shoulder; and even Mrs. Pentecost,\r\nwhen the whole party were comfortably established on board, took a\r\ncomparatively cheerful view of the prospects of the picnic. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anything\r\nhappens,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, addressing the company generally, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\none comfort for all of us. My son can swim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat floated out from the creek into the placid waters of the Broad,\r\nand the full beauty of the scene opened on the view.\r\n\r\nOn the northward and westward, as the boat reached the middle of the\r\nlake, the shore lay clear and low in the sunshine, fringed darkly at\r\ncertain points by rows of dwarf trees; and dotted here and there, in\r\nthe opener spaces, with windmills and reed-thatched cottages, of puddled\r\nmud. Southward, the great sheet of water narrowed gradually to a little\r\ngroup of close-nestling islands which closed the prospect; while to the\r\neast a long, gently undulating line of reeds followed the windings of\r\nthe Broad, and shut out all view of the watery wastes beyond. So clear\r\nand so light was the summer air that the one cloud in the eastern\r\nquarter of the heaven was the smoke cloud left by a passing steamer\r\nthree miles distant and more on the invisible sea. When the voices of\r\nthe pleasure party were still, not a sound rose, far or near, but the\r\nfaint ripple at the bows, as the men, with slow, deliberate strokes\r\nof their long poles, pressed the boat forward softly over the shallow\r\nwater. The world and the world\xe2\x80\x99s turmoil seemed left behind forever\r\non the land; the silence was the silence of enchantment--the delicious\r\ninterflow of the soft purity of the sky and the bright tranquillity of\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\nEstablished in perfect comfort in the boat--the major and his daughter\r\non one side, the curate and his mother on the other, and Allan and young\r\nPedgift between the two--the water party floated smoothly toward the\r\nlittle nest of islands at the end of the Broad. Miss Milroy was in\r\nraptures; Allan was delighted; and the major for once forgot his clock.\r\nEvery one felt pleasurably, in their different ways, the quiet and\r\nbeauty of the scene. Mrs. Pentecost, in her way, felt it like a\r\nclairvoyant--with closed eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook behind you, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered young Pedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the\r\nparson\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to enjoy himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn unwonted briskness--portentous apparently of coming speech--did\r\ncertainly at that moment enliven the curate\xe2\x80\x99s manner. He jerked his head\r\nfrom side to side like a bird; he cleared his throat, and clasped his\r\nhands, and looked with a gentle interest at the company. Getting into\r\nspirits seemed, in the case of this excellent person, to be alarmingly\r\nlike getting into the pulpit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven in this scene of tranquillity,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend Samuel, coming\r\nout softly with his first contribution to the society in the shape of\r\na remark, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Christian mind--led, so to speak, from one extreme to\r\nanother--is forcibly recalled to the unstable nature of all earthly\r\nenjoyments. How if this calm should not last? How if the winds rose and\r\nthe waters became agitated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t alarm yourself about that, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Pedgift;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJune\xe2\x80\x99s the fine season here--and you can swim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Pentecost (mesmerically affected, in all probability, by the near\r\nneighborhood of her son) opened her eyes suddenly and asked, with her\r\ncustomary eagerness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does my boy say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Samuel repeated his words in the key that suited his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s infirmity. The old lady nodded in high approval, and pursued\r\nher son\xe2\x80\x99s train of thought through the medium of a quotation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs. Pentecost, with infinite relish, \xe2\x80\x9cHe rides the\r\nwhirlwind, Sammy, and directs the storm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoble words!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend Samuel. \xe2\x80\x9cNoble and consoling words!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cif he goes on much longer in that way, what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you, papa, it was a risk to ask them,\xe2\x80\x9d added Miss Milroy, in\r\nanother whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear!\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the major. \xe2\x80\x9cWe knew nobody else in the\r\nneighborhood, and, as Mr. Armadale kindly suggested our bringing our\r\nfriends, what could we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t upset the boat,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked young Pedgift, with sardonic\r\ngravity. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lifeboat, unfortunately. May I venture to suggest\r\nputting something into the reverend gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, Mr. Armadale?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s close on three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. What do you say to ringing the dinner-bell,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever was the right man more entirely in the right place than Pedgift\r\nJunior at the picnic. In ten minutes more the boat was brought to a\r\nstand-still among the reeds; the Thorpe Ambrose hampers were unpacked\r\non the roof of the cabin; and the current of the curate\xe2\x80\x99s eloquence was\r\nchecked for the day.\r\n\r\nHow inestimably important in its moral results--and therefore how\r\npraiseworthy in itself--is the act of eating and drinking! The social\r\nvirtues center in the stomach. A man who is not a better husband,\r\nfather, and brother after dinner than before is, digestively speaking,\r\nan incurably vicious man. What hidden charms of character disclose\r\nthemselves, what dormant amiabilities awaken, when our common humanity\r\ngathers together to pour out the gastric juice! At the opening of the\r\nhampers from Thorpe Ambrose, sweet Sociability (offspring of the happy\r\nunion of Civilization and Mrs. Gripper) exhaled among the boating party,\r\nand melted in one friendly fusion the discordant elements of which that\r\nparty had hitherto been composed. Now did the Reverend Samuel Pentecost,\r\nwhose light had hitherto been hidden under a bushel, prove at last that\r\nhe could do something by proving that he could eat. Now did Pedgift\r\nJunior shine brighter than ever he had shone yet in gems of caustic\r\nhumor and exquisite fertilities of resource. Now did the squire, and the\r\nsquire\xe2\x80\x99s charming guest, prove the triple connection between Champagne\r\nthat sparkles, Love that grows bolder, and Eyes whose vocabulary is\r\nwithout the word No. Now did cheerful old times come back to the major\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmemory, and cheerful old stories not told for years find their way to\r\nthe major\xe2\x80\x99s lips. And now did Mrs. Pentecost, coming out wakefully\r\nin the whole force of her estimable maternal character, seize on a\r\nsupplementary fork, and ply that useful instrument incessantly between\r\nthe choicest morsels in the whole round of dishes, and the few vacant\r\nplaces left available on the Reverend Samuel\xe2\x80\x99s plate. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at my\r\nson,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old lady, observing the merriment which her proceedings\r\nproduced among the company. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my fault, poor dear--_I_ make him\r\neat!\xe2\x80\x9d And there are men in this world who, seeing virtues such as\r\nthese developed at the table, as they are developed nowhere else, can,\r\nnevertheless, rank the glorious privilege of dining with the smallest\r\nof the diurnal personal worries which necessity imposes on mankind--with\r\nbuttoning your waistcoat, for example, or lacing your stays! Trust no\r\nsuch monster as this with your tender secrets, your loves and hatreds,\r\nyour hopes and fears. His heart is uncorrected by his stomach, and the\r\nsocial virtues are not in him.\r\n\r\nThe last mellow hours of the day and the first cool breezes of the long\r\nsummer evening had met before the dishes were all laid waste, and the\r\nbottles as empty as bottles should be. This point in the proceedings\r\nattained, the picnic party looked lazily at Pedgift Junior to know what\r\nwas to be done next. That inexhaustible functionary was equal as ever to\r\nall the calls on him. He had a new amusement ready before the quickest\r\nof the company could so much as ask him what that amusement was to be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFond of music on the water, Miss Milroy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in his airiest and\r\npleasantest manner.\r\n\r\nMiss Milroy adored music, both on the water and the land--always\r\nexcepting the one case when she was practicing the art herself on the\r\npiano at home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll get out of the reeds first,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Pedgift. He gave\r\nhis orders to the boatmen, dived briskly into the little cabin, and\r\nreappeared with a concertina in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cNeat, Miss Milroy, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, pointing to his initials, inlaid on the instrument\r\nin mother-of-pearl. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name\xe2\x80\x99s Augustus, like my father\xe2\x80\x99s. Some of my\r\nfriends knock off the \xe2\x80\x98A,\xe2\x80\x99 and call me \xe2\x80\x98Gustus Junior.\xe2\x80\x99 A small joke\r\ngoes a long way among friends, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Mr. Armadale? I sing a little\r\nto my own accompaniment, ladies and gentlemen; and, if quite agreeable,\r\nI shall be proud and happy to do my best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Pentecost; \xe2\x80\x9cI dote on music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this formidable announcement, the old lady opened a prodigious\r\nleather bag, from which she never parted night or day, and took out an\r\near-trumpet of the old-fashioned kind--something between a key-bugle and\r\na French horn. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care to use the thing generally,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Mrs.\r\nPentecost, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of its making me deafer than ever. But\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t and won\xe2\x80\x99t miss the music. I dote on music. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll hold the\r\nother end, Sammy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick it in my ear. Neelie, my dear, tell him to\r\nbegin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung Pedgift was troubled with no nervous hesitation. He began at once,\r\nnot with songs of the light and modern kind, such as might have been\r\nexpected from an amateur of his age and character, but with declamatory\r\nand patriotic bursts of poetry, set to the bold and blatant music which\r\nthe people of England loved dearly at the earlier part of the present\r\ncentury, and which, whenever they can get it, they love dearly still.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Death of Marmion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Battle of the Baltic,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bay of\r\nBiscay,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNelson,\xe2\x80\x9d under various vocal aspects, as exhibited by the\r\nlate Braham--these were the songs in which the roaring concertina and\r\nstrident tenor of Gustus Junior exulted together. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me when you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ntired, ladies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the minstrel solicitor. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nconceit about _me_. Will you have a little sentiment by way of variety?\r\nShall I wind up with \xe2\x80\x98The Mistletoe Bough\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Poor Mary Anne\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving favored his audience with those two cheerful melodies, young\r\nPedgift respectfully requested the rest of the company to follow his\r\nvocal example in turn, offering, in every case, to play \xe2\x80\x9ca running\r\naccompaniment\xe2\x80\x9d impromptu, if the singer would only be so obliging as to\r\nfavor him with the key-note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, somebody!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Pentecost, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you again, I\r\ndote on music. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t had half enough yet, have we, Sammy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Samuel made no reply. The unhappy man had reasons of his\r\nown--not exactly in his bosom, but a little lower--for remaining silent,\r\nin the midst of the general hilarity and the general applause. Alas for\r\nhumanity! Even maternal love is alloyed with mortal fallibility. Owing\r\nmuch already to his excellent mother, the Reverend Samuel was now\r\nadditionally indebted to her for a smart indigestion.\r\n\r\nNobody, however, noticed as yet the signs and tokens of internal\r\nrevolution in the curate\xe2\x80\x99s face. Everybody was occupied in entreating\r\neverybody else to sing. Miss Milroy appealed to the founder of the\r\nfeast. \xe2\x80\x9cDo sing something, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI should so like to\r\nhear you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you once begin, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d added the cheerful Pedgift, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll find it\r\nget uncommonly easy as you go on. Music is a science which requires to\r\nbe taken by the throat at starting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, in his good-humored way. \xe2\x80\x9cI know lots\r\nof tunes, but the worst of it is, the words escape me. I wonder if I\r\ncan remember one of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Melodies? My poor mother used to be fond of\r\nteaching me Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Melodies when I was a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose melodies?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Pentecost. \xe2\x80\x9cMoore\xe2\x80\x99s? Aha! I know Tom Moore\r\nby heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps in that case you will be good enough to help me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, if my\r\nmemory breaks down,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take the easiest melody in\r\nthe whole collection, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me. Everybody knows it--\xe2\x80\x98Eveleen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBower.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m familiar, in a general sort of way, with the national melodies of\r\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift Junior. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll accompany\r\nyou, sir, with the greatest pleasure. This is the sort of thing, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d He seated himself cross-legged on the roof of the cabin, and\r\nburst into a complicated musical improvisation wonderful to hear--a\r\nmixture of instrumental flourishes and groans; a jig corrected by a\r\ndirge, and a dirge enlivened by a jig. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nyoung Pedgift, with his smile of supreme confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cFire away, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Pentecost elevated her trumpet, and Allan elevated his voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, weep for the hour when to Eveleen\xe2\x80\x99s Bower--\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped; the\r\naccompaniment stopped; the audience waited. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a most extraordinary\r\nthing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan; \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I had the next line on the tip of my\r\ntongue, and it seems to have escaped me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll begin again, if you have\r\nno objection. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, weep for the hour when to Eveleen\xe2\x80\x99s Bower--\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The lord of the valley with false vows came,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pentecost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I shall get on smoothly. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, weep\r\nfor the hour when to Eveleen\xe2\x80\x99s Bower, the lord of the valley with false\r\nvows came. The moon was shining bright--\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pentecost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Allan. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The moon was shining\r\nbright--\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moon wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doing anything of the kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pentecost.\r\n\r\nPedgift Junior, foreseeing a dispute, persevered _sotto voce_ with the\r\naccompaniment, in the interests of harmony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoore\xe2\x80\x99s own words, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cin my mother\xe2\x80\x99s copy of the\r\nMelodies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother\xe2\x80\x99s copy was wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs. Pentecost. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell\r\nyou just now that I knew Tom Moore by heart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Junior\xe2\x80\x99s peace-making concertina still flourished and groaned in\r\nthe minor key.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what _did_ the moon do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan, in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the moon _ought_ to have done, sir, or Tom Moore wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nwritten it so,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Pentecost. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The moon hid her light from\r\nthe heaven that night, and wept behind her clouds o\xe2\x80\x99er the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshame!\xe2\x80\x99 I wish that young man would leave off playing,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs.\r\nPentecost, venting her rising irritation on Gustus Junior. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nenough of him--he tickles my ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProud, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the unblushing Pedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole\r\nscience of music consists in tickling the ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe seem to be drifting into a sort of argument,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Major Milroy,\r\nplacidly. \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be better if Mr. Armadale went on with his song?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo go on, Mr. Armadale!\xe2\x80\x9d added the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cDo go on, Mr.\r\nPedgift!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of them doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know the words, and the other doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know the\r\nmusic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pentecost. \xe2\x80\x9cLet them go on if they can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry to disappoint you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift Junior; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ready to go\r\non myself to any extent. Now, Mr. Armadale!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan opened his lips to take up the unfinished melody where he had last\r\nleft it. Before he could utter a note, the curate suddenly rose, with a\r\nghastly face, and a hand pressed convulsively over the middle region of\r\nhis waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the whole boating party in chorus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am exceedingly unwell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Reverend Samuel Pentecost. The boat\r\nwas instantly in a state of confusion. \xe2\x80\x9cEveleen\xe2\x80\x99s Bower\xe2\x80\x9d expired on\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s lips, and even the irrepressible concertina of Pedgift\r\nwas silenced at last. The alarm proved to be quite needless. Mrs.\r\nPentecost\xe2\x80\x99s son possessed a mother, and that mother had a bag. In\r\ntwo seconds the art of medicine occupied the place left vacant in the\r\nattention of the company by the art of music.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRub it gently, Sammy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pentecost. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get out the bottles\r\nand give you a dose. It\xe2\x80\x99s his poor stomach, major. Hold my trumpet,\r\nsomebody--and stop the boat. You take that bottle, Neelie, my dear; and\r\nyou take this one, Mr. Armadale; and give them to me as I want them.\r\nAh, poor dear, I know what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with him! Want of power _here_,\r\nmajor--cold, acid, and flabby. Ginger to warm him; soda to correct him;\r\nsal volatile to hold him up. There, Sammy! drink it before it settles;\r\nand then go and lie down, my dear, in that dog-kennel of a place they\r\ncall the cabin. No more music!\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs. Pentecost, shaking her\r\nforefinger at the proprietor of the concertina--\xe2\x80\x9cunless it\xe2\x80\x99s a hymn, and\r\nthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t object to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody appearing to be in a fit frame of mind for singing a hymn, the\r\nall-accomplished Pedgift drew upon his stores of local knowledge, and\r\nproduced a new idea. The course of the boat was immediately changed\r\nunder his direction. In a few minutes more, the company found themselves\r\nin a little island creek, with a lonely cottage at the far end of it,\r\nand a perfect forest of reeds closing the view all round them. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nyou say, ladies and gentlemen, to stepping on shore and seeing what a\r\nreed-cutter\xe2\x80\x99s cottage looks like?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested young Pedgift.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe say yes, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI think our spirits have been\r\na little dashed by Mr. Pentecost\xe2\x80\x99s illness and Mrs. Pentecost\xe2\x80\x99s bag,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, in a whisper to Miss Milroy. \xe2\x80\x9cA change of this sort is the very\r\nthing we want to set us all going again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe and young Pedgift handed Miss Milroy out of the boat. The major\r\nfollowed. Mrs. Pentecost sat immovable as the Egyptian Sphinx, with her\r\nbag on her knees, mounting guard over \xe2\x80\x9cSammy\xe2\x80\x9d in the cabin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must keep the fun going, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, as he helped the major\r\nover the side of the boat. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t half done yet with the enjoyment\r\nof the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice seconded his hearty belief in his own prediction to such good\r\npurpose that even Mrs. Pentecost heard him, and ominously shook her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the curate\xe2\x80\x99s mother, \xe2\x80\x9cif you were as old as I am, young\r\ngentleman, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel quite so sure of the enjoyment of the day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, in rebuke of the rashness of youth, spoke the caution of age. The\r\nnegative view is notoriously the safe view, all the world over, and the\r\nPentecost philosophy is, as a necessary consequence, generally in the\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. FATE OR CHANCE?\r\n\r\nIt was close on six o\xe2\x80\x99clock when Allan and his friends left the boat,\r\nand the evening influence was creeping already, in its mystery and its\r\nstillness, over the watery solitude of the Broads.\r\n\r\nThe shore in these wild regions was not like the shore elsewhere. Firm\r\nas it looked, the garden ground in front of the reed-cutter\xe2\x80\x99s cottage\r\nwas floating ground, that rose and fell and oozed into puddles under the\r\npressure of the foot. The boatmen who guided the visitors warned them to\r\nkeep to the path, and pointed through gaps in the reeds and pollards to\r\ngrassy places, on which strangers would have walked confidently, where\r\nthe crust of earth was not strong enough to bear the weight of a child\r\nover the unfathomed depths of slime and water beneath. The solitary\r\ncottage, built of planks pitched black, stood on ground that had been\r\nsteadied and strengthened by resting it on piles. A little wooden tower\r\nrose at one end of the roof, and served as a lookout post in the\r\nfowling season. From this elevation the eye ranged far and wide over a\r\nwilderness of winding water and lonesome marsh. If the reed-cutter\r\nhad lost his boat, he would have been as completely isolated from all\r\ncommunication with town or village as if his place of abode had been a\r\nlight-vessel instead of a cottage. Neither he nor his family complained\r\nof their solitude, or looked in any way the rougher or the worse for it.\r\nHis wife received the visitors hospitably, in a snug little room, with\r\na raftered ceiling, and windows which looked like windows in a cabin on\r\nboard ship. His wife\xe2\x80\x99s father told stories of the famous days when the\r\nsmugglers came up from the sea at night, rowing through the net-work of\r\nrivers with muffled oars till they gained the lonely Broads, and sank\r\ntheir spirit casks in the water, far from the coast-guard\xe2\x80\x99s reach. His\r\nwild little children played at hide-and-seek with the visitors; and\r\nthe visitors ranged in and out of the cottage, and round and round the\r\nmorsel of firm earth on which it stood, surprised and delighted by the\r\nnovelty of all they saw. The one person who noticed the advance of\r\nthe evening--the one person who thought of the flying time and the\r\nstationary Pentecosts in the boat--was young Pedgift. That experienced\r\npilot of the Broads looked askance at his watch, and drew Allan aside at\r\nthe first opportunity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to hurry you, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift Junior; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the\r\ntime is getting on, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lady in the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined young Pedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cA lady from London; connected\r\n(if you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me to jog your memory) with a pony-chaise and white\r\nharness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, the governess!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we have forgotten all\r\nabout her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, sir; there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of time, if we only get into\r\nthe boat again. This is how it stands, Mr. Armadale. We settled, if\r\nyou remember, to have the gypsy tea-making at the next \xe2\x80\x98Broad\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nthis--Hurle Mere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cHurle Mere is the place where my friend\r\nMidwinter has promised to come and meet us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurle Mere is where the governess will be, sir, if your coachman\r\nfollows my directions,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued young Pedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have got nearly an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s punting to do, along the twists and turns of the narrow waters\r\n(which they call The Sounds here) between this and Hurle Mere; and\r\naccording to my calculations we must get on board again in five minutes,\r\nif we are to be in time to meet the governess and to meet your friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t miss my friend on any account,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan; \xe2\x80\x9cor the\r\ngoverness, either, of course. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the major.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMajor Milroy was at that moment preparing to mount the wooden\r\nwatch-tower of the cottage to see the view. The ever useful Pedgift\r\nvolunteered to go up with him, and rattle off all the necessary local\r\nexplanations in half the time which the reed-cutter would occupy in\r\ndescribing his own neighborhood to a stranger.\r\n\r\nAllan remained standing in front of the cottage, more quiet and more\r\nthoughtful than usual. His interview with young Pedgift had brought his\r\nabsent friend to his memory for the first time since the picnic party\r\nhad started. He was surprised that Midwinter, so much in his thoughts on\r\nall other occasions, should have been so long out of his thoughts now.\r\nSomething troubled him, like a sense of self-reproach, as his mind\r\nreverted to the faithful friend at home, toiling hard over the steward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbooks, in his interests and for his sake. \xe2\x80\x9cDear old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nAllan, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be so glad to see him at the Mere; the day\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be complete till he joins us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould I be right or wrong, Mr. Armadale, if I guessed that you were\r\nthinking of somebody?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a voice, softly, behind him.\r\n\r\nAllan turned, and found the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter at his side. Miss Milroy\r\n(not unmindful of a certain tender interview which had taken place\r\nbehind a carriage) had noticed her admirer standing thoughtfully by\r\nhimself, and had determined on giving him another opportunity, while her\r\nfather and young Pedgift were at the top of the watch-tower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI _was_ thinking of\r\nsomebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Milroy stole a glance at him--a glance of gentle encouragement.\r\nThere could be but one human creature in Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s mind after what\r\nhad passed between them that morning! It would be only an act of mercy\r\nto take him back again at once to the interrupted conversation of a few\r\nhours since on the subject of names.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking of somebody, too,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, half-inviting,\r\nhalf-repelling the coming avowal. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I tell you the first letter of my\r\nSomebody\xe2\x80\x99s name, will you tell me the first letter of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you anything you like,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Allan, with the utmost\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nShe still shrank coquettishly from the very subject that she wanted to\r\napproach. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me your letter first,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in low tones, looking\r\naway from him.\r\n\r\nAllan laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cM,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis my first letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started a little. Strange that he should be thinking of her by her\r\nsurname instead of her Christian name; but it mattered little as long as\r\nhe _was_ thinking of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your letter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan.\r\n\r\nShe blushed and smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cA--if you will have it!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, in a\r\nreluctant little whisper. She stole another look at him, and luxuriously\r\nprotracted her enjoyment of the coming avowal once more. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many\r\nsyllables is the name in?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, drawing patterns shyly on the\r\nground with the end of the parasol.\r\n\r\nNo man with the slightest knowledge of the sex would have been rash\r\nenough, in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s position, to tell her the truth. Allan, who knew\r\nnothing whatever of woman\xe2\x80\x99s natures, and who told the truth right\r\nand left in all mortal emergencies, answered as if he had been under\r\nexamination in a court of justice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a name in three syllables,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMiss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s downcast eyes flashed up at him like lightning. \xe2\x80\x9cThree!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she repeated in the blankest astonishment.\r\n\r\nAllan was too inveterately straightforward to take the warning even now.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not strong at my spelling, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with his lighthearted\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, in calling Midwinter a name\r\nin three syllables. I was thinking of my friend; but never mind my\r\nthoughts. Tell me who A is--tell me whom _you_ were thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the first letter of the alphabet, Mr. Armadale, and I beg positively\r\nto inform you of nothing more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that annihilating answer the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter put up her parasol\r\nand walked back by herself to the boat.\r\n\r\nAllan stood petrified with amazement. If Miss Milroy had actually boxed\r\nhis ears (and there is no denying that she had privately longed to\r\ndevote her hand to that purpose), he could hardly have felt more\r\nbewildered than he felt now. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nhimself, helplessly, as the major and young Pedgift joined him, and the\r\nthree walked down together to the water-side. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what she\xe2\x80\x99ll say\r\nto me next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said absolutely nothing; she never so much as looked at Allan when\r\nhe took his place in the boat. There she sat, with her eyes and her\r\ncomplexion both much brighter than usual, taking the deepest interest in\r\nthe curate\xe2\x80\x99s progress toward recovery; in the state of Mrs. Pentecost\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspirits; in Pedgift Junior (for whom she ostentatiously made room\r\nenough to let him sit beside her); in the scenery and the reed-cutter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncottage; in everybody and everything but Allan--whom she would have\r\nmarried with the greatest pleasure five minutes since. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nforgive him,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be thinking of that\r\nill-bred wretch when I was thinking of _him_; and to make me all but\r\nconfess it before I found him out! Thank Heaven, Mr. Pedgift is in the\r\nboat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind Miss Neelie applied herself forthwith to the\r\nfascination of Pedgift and the discomfiture of Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Pedgift,\r\nhow extremely clever and kind of you to think of showing us that sweet\r\ncottage! Lonely, Mr. Armadale? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s lonely at all; I\r\nshould like of all things to live there. What would this picnic have\r\nbeen without you, Mr. Pedgift; you can\xe2\x80\x99t think how I have enjoyed it\r\nsince we got into the boat. Cool, Mr. Armadale? What can you possibly\r\nmean by saying it\xe2\x80\x99s cool; it\xe2\x80\x99s the warmest evening we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this\r\nsummer. And the music, Mr. Pedgift; how nice it was of you to bring your\r\nconcertina! I wonder if I could accompany you on the piano? I would so\r\nlike to try. Oh, yes, Mr. Armadale, no doubt you meant to do something\r\nmusical, too, and I dare say you sing very well when you know the words;\r\nbut, to tell you the truth, I always did, and always shall, hate Moore\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMelodies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus, with merciless dexterity of manipulation, did Miss Milroy work\r\nthat sharpest female weapon of offense, the tongue; and thus she would\r\nhave used it for some time longer, if Allan had only shown the necessary\r\njealousy, or if Pedgift had only afforded the necessary encouragement.\r\nBut adverse fortune had decreed that she should select for her victims\r\ntwo men essentially unassailable under existing circumstances. Allan was\r\ntoo innocent of all knowledge of female subtleties and susceptibilities\r\nto understand anything, except that the charming Neelie was unreasonably\r\nout of temper with him without the slightest cause. The wary Pedgift,\r\nas became one of the quick-witted youth of the present generation,\r\nsubmitted to female influence, with his eye fixed immovably all the time\r\non his own interests. Many a young man of the past generation, who was\r\nno fool, has sacrificed everything for love. Not one young man in ten\r\nthousand of the present generation, _except_ the fools, has sacrificed a\r\nhalf-penny. The daughters of Eve still inherit their mother\xe2\x80\x99s merits\r\nand commit their mother\xe2\x80\x99s faults. But the sons of Adam, in these latter\r\ndays, are men who would have handed the famous apple back with a bow,\r\nand a \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, no; it might get me into a scrape.\xe2\x80\x9d When Allan--surprised\r\nand disappointed--moved away out of Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s reach to the forward\r\npart of the boat, Pedgift Junior rose and followed him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a very\r\nnice girl,\xe2\x80\x9d thought this shrewdly sensible young man; \xe2\x80\x9cbut a client\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nclient; and I am sorry to inform you, miss, it won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x9d He set himself\r\nat once to rouse Allan\xe2\x80\x99s spirits by diverting his attention to a new\r\nsubject. There was to be a regatta that autumn on one of the Broads, and\r\nhis client\xe2\x80\x99s opinion as a yachtsman might be valuable to the committee.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething new, I should think, to you, sir, in a sailing match on fresh\r\nwater?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in his most ingratiatory manner. And Allan, instantly\r\ninterested, answered, \xe2\x80\x9cQuite new. Do tell me about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of the party at the other end of the boat, they were in\r\na fair way to confirm Mrs. Pentecost\xe2\x80\x99s doubts whether the hilarity of\r\nthe picnic would last the day out. Poor Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s natural feeling of\r\nirritation under the disappointment which Allan\xe2\x80\x99s awkwardness had\r\ninflicted on her was now exasperated into silent and settled resentment\r\nby her own keen sense of humiliation and defeat. The major had relapsed\r\ninto his habitually dreamy, absent manner; his mind was turning\r\nmonotonously with the wheels of his clock. The curate still secluded his\r\nindigestion from public view in the innermost recesses of the cabin; and\r\nthe curate\xe2\x80\x99s mother, with a second dose ready at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice,\r\nsat on guard at the door. Women of Mrs. Pentecost\xe2\x80\x99s age and character\r\ngenerally enjoy their own bad spirits. \xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the old lady,\r\nwagging her head with a smile of sour satisfaction \xe2\x80\x9cis what you call\r\na day\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure, is it? Ah, what fools we all were to leave our\r\ncomfortable homes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the boat floated smoothly along the windings of the watery\r\nlabyrinth which lay between the two Broads. The view on either side was\r\nnow limited to nothing but interminable rows of reeds. Not a sound was\r\nheard, far or near; not so much as a glimpse of cultivated or inhabited\r\nland appeared anywhere. \xe2\x80\x9cA trifle dreary hereabouts, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe ever-cheerful Pedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we are just out of it now. Look ahead,\r\nsir! Here we are at Hurle Mere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reeds opened back on the right hand and the left, and the boat\r\nglided suddenly into the wide circle of a pool. Round the nearer half\r\nof the circle, the eternal reeds still fringed the margin of the water.\r\nRound the further half, the land appeared again, here rolling back from\r\nthe pool in desolate sand-hills, there rising above it in a sweep of\r\ngrassy shore. At one point the ground was occupied by a plantation, and\r\nat another by the out-buildings of a lonely old red brick house, with\r\na strip of by-road near, that skirted the garden wall and ended at the\r\npool. The sun was sinking in the clear heaven, and the water, where the\r\nsun\xe2\x80\x99s reflection failed to tinge it, was beginning to look black and\r\ncold. The solitude that had been soothing, the silence that had felt\r\nlike an enchantment, on the other Broad, in the day\xe2\x80\x99s vigorous prime,\r\nwas a solitude that saddened here--a silence that struck cold, in the\r\nstillness and melancholy of the day\xe2\x80\x99s decline.\r\n\r\nThe course of the boat was directed across the Mere to a creek in the\r\ngrassy shore. One or two of the little flat-bottomed punts peculiar\r\nto the Broads lay in the creek; and the reed cutters to whom the punts\r\nbelonged, surprised at the appearance of strangers, came out, staring\r\nsilently, from behind an angle of the old garden wall. Not another sign\r\nof life was visible anywhere. No pony-chaise had been seen by the reed\r\ncutters; no stranger, either man or woman, had approached the shores of\r\nHurle Mere that day.\r\n\r\nYoung Pedgift took another look at his watch, and addressed himself to\r\nMiss Milroy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may, or may not, see the governess when you get back\r\nto Thorpe Ambrose,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, as the time stands now, you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee her here. You know best, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to Allan,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhether your friend is to be depended on to keep his appointment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain he is to be depended on,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Allan, looking about\r\nhim--in unconcealed disappointment at Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s absence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Pedgift Junior. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we light the fire for our gypsy\r\ntea-making on the open ground there, your friend may find us out, sir,\r\nby the smoke. That\xe2\x80\x99s the Indian dodge for picking up a lost man on the\r\nprairie, Miss Milroy and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty nearly wild enough (isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?) to\r\nbe a prairie here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere are some temptations--principally those of the smaller kind--which\r\nit is not in the defensive capacity of female human nature to resist.\r\nThe temptation to direct the whole force of her influence, as the\r\none young lady of the party, toward the instant overthrow of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrangement for meeting his friend, was too much for the major\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter. She turned on the smiling Pedgift with a look which ought to\r\nhave overwhelmed him. But who ever overwhelmed a solicitor?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s the most lonely, dreary, hideous place I ever saw in my\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Neelie. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you insist on making tea here, Mr. Pedgift,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t make any for me. No! I shall stop in the boat; and, though I am\r\nabsolutely dying with thirst, I shall touch nothing till we get back\r\nagain to the other Broad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe major opened his lips to remonstrate. To his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s infinite\r\ndelight, Mrs. Pentecost rose from her seat before he could say a word,\r\nand, after surveying the whole landward prospect, and seeing nothing\r\nin the shape of a vehicle anywhere, asked indignantly whether they\r\nwere going all the way back again to the place where they had left the\r\ncarriages in the middle of the day. On ascertaining that this was,\r\nin fact, the arrangement proposed, and that, from the nature of the\r\ncountry, the carriages could not have been ordered round to Hurle Mere\r\nwithout, in the first instance, sending them the whole of the way back\r\nto Thorpe Ambrose, Mrs. Pentecost (speaking in her son\xe2\x80\x99s interests)\r\ninstantly declared that no earthly power should induce her to be out\r\non the water after dark. \xe2\x80\x9cCall me a boat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old lady, in great\r\nagitation. \xe2\x80\x9cWherever there\xe2\x80\x99s water, there\xe2\x80\x99s a night mist, and wherever\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a night mist, my son Samuel catches cold. Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to _me_\r\nabout your moonlight and your tea-making--you\xe2\x80\x99re all mad! Hi! you two\r\nmen there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Pentecost, hailing the silent reed cutters on\r\nshore. \xe2\x80\x9cSixpence apiece for you, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll take me and my son back in\r\nyour boat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore young Pedgift could interfere, Allan himself settled the\r\ndifficulty this time, with perfect patience and good temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think, Mrs. Pentecost, of your going back in any boat but the\r\nboat you have come out in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is not the least need (as\r\nyou and Miss Milroy don\xe2\x80\x99t like the place) for anybody to go on shore\r\nhere but me. I _must_ go on shore. My friend Midwinter never broke his\r\npromise to me yet; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t consent to leave Hurle Mere as long as\r\nthere is a chance of his keeping his appointment. But there\xe2\x80\x99s not the\r\nleast reason in the world why I should stand in the way on that account.\r\nYou have the major and Mr. Pedgift to take care of you; and you can get\r\nback to the carriages before dark, if you go at once. I will wait here,\r\nand give my friend half an hour more, and then I can follow you in one\r\nof the reed-cutters\xe2\x80\x99 boats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the most sensible thing, Mr. Armadale, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n remarked Mrs. Pentecost, seating herself again in a violent hurry\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell them to be quick!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old lady, shaking her fist at the\r\nboatmen. \xe2\x80\x9cTell them to be quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan gave the necessary directions, and stepped on shore. The wary\r\nPedgift (sticking fast to his client) tried to follow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t leave you here alone, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, protesting eagerly in\r\na whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cLet the major take care of the ladies, and let me keep you\r\ncompany at the Mere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, pressing him back. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all in low spirits on\r\nboard. If you want to be of service to me, stop like a good fellow where\r\nyou are, and do your best to keep the thing going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand, and the men pushed the boat off from the shore. The\r\nothers all waved their hands in return except the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, who\r\nsat apart from the rest, with her face hidden under her parasol. The\r\ntears stood thick in Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Her last angry feeling against Allan\r\ndied out, and her heart went back to him penitently the moment he left\r\nthe boat. \xe2\x80\x9cHow good he is to us all!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand what a wretch I\r\nam!\xe2\x80\x9d She got up with every generous impulse in her nature urging her to\r\nmake atonement to him. She got up, reckless of appearances and looked\r\nafter him with eager eyes and flushed checks, as he stood alone on\r\nthe shore. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be long, Mr. Armadale!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a desperate\r\ndisregard of what the rest of the company thought of her.\r\n\r\nThe boat was already far out in the water, and with all Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresolution the words were spoken in a faint little voice, which failed\r\nto reach Allan\xe2\x80\x99s ears. The one sound he heard, as the boat gained the\r\nopposite extremity of the Mere, and disappeared slowly among the reeds,\r\nwas the sound of the concertina. The indefatigable Pedgift was keeping\r\nthings going--evidently under the auspices of Mrs. Pentecost--by\r\nperforming a sacred melody.\r\n\r\nLeft by himself, Allan lit a cigar, and took a turn backward and forward\r\non the shore. \xe2\x80\x9cShe might have said a word to me at parting!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done everything for the best; I\xe2\x80\x99ve as good as told her how fond\r\nof her I am, and this is the way she treats me!\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, and stood\r\nlooking absently at the sinking sun, and the fast-darkening waters\r\nof the Mere. Some inscrutable influence in the scene forced its way\r\nstealthily into his mind, and diverted his thoughts from Miss Milroy to\r\nhis absent friend. He started, and looked about him.\r\n\r\nThe reed-cutters had gone back to their retreat behind the angle of the\r\nwall, not a living creature was visible, not a sound rose anywhere along\r\nthe dreary shore. Even Allan\xe2\x80\x99s spirits began to get depressed. It was\r\nnearly an hour after the time when Midwinter had promised to be at Hurle\r\nMere. He had himself arranged to walk to the pool (with a stable-boy\r\nfrom Thorpe Ambrose as his guide), by lanes and footpaths which\r\nshortened the distance by the road. The boy knew the country well, and\r\nMidwinter was habitually punctual at all his appointments. Had anything\r\ngone wrong at Thorpe Ambrose? Had some accident happened on the way?\r\nDetermined to remain no longer doubting and idling by himself, Allan\r\nmade up his mind to walk inland from the Mere, on the chance of meeting\r\nhis friend. He went round at once to the angle in the wall, and asked\r\none of the reedcutters to show him the footpath to Thorpe Ambrose.\r\n\r\nThe man led him away from the road, and pointed to a barely perceptible\r\nbreak in the outer trees of the plantation. After pausing for one more\r\nuseless look around him, Allan turned his back on the Mere and made for\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nFor a few paces, the path ran straight through the plantation. Thence it\r\ntook a sudden turn; and the water and the open country became both lost\r\nto view. Allan steadily followed the grassy track before him, seeing\r\nnothing and hearing nothing, until he came to another winding of the\r\npath. Turning in the new direction, he saw dimly a human figure sitting\r\nalone at the foot of one of the trees. Two steps nearer were enough\r\nto make the figure familiar to him. \xe2\x80\x9cMidwinter!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, in\r\nastonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the place where I was to meet you! What are\r\nyou waiting for here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter rose, without answering. The evening dimness among the trees,\r\nwhich obscured his face, made his silence doubly perplexing.\r\n\r\nAllan went on eagerly questioning him. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you come here by yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought the boy was to guide you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Midwinter answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we got as far as these trees,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI sent the boy back. He told me I was close to the place, and\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you stop here when he left you?\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you walk on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t despise me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the courage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the courage?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Allan. He paused a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nresumed, putting his hand gayly on Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re still\r\nshy of the Milroys. What nonsense, when I told you myself that your\r\npeace was made at the cottage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking, Allan, of your friends at the cottage. The truth is,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m hardly myself to-day. I am ill and unnerved; trifles startle me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He stopped, and shrank away, under the anxious scrutiny of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you _will_ have it,\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out, abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe horror of that\r\nnight on board the Wreck has got me again; there\xe2\x80\x99s a dreadful oppression\r\non my head; there\xe2\x80\x99s a dreadful sinking at my heart. I am afraid of\r\nsomething happening to us, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t part before the day is out. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t break my promise to you; for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, release me from it, and\r\nlet me go back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRemonstrance, to any one who knew Midwinter, was plainly useless at that\r\nmoment. Allan humored him. \xe2\x80\x9cCome out of this dark, airless place,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cand we will talk about it. The water and the open sky are within\r\na stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw of us. I hate a wood in the evening; it even gives _me_\r\nthe horrors. You have been working too hard over the steward\xe2\x80\x99s books.\r\nCome and breathe freely in the blessed open air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter stopped, considered for a moment, and suddenly submitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, as usual. I\xe2\x80\x99m wasting time and\r\ndistressing you to no purpose. What folly to ask you to let me go back!\r\nSuppose you had said yes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Midwinter, \xe2\x80\x9csomething would have happened at the first\r\nstep to stop me, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Come on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked together in silence on the way to the Mere.\r\n\r\nAt the last turn in the path Allan\xe2\x80\x99s cigar went out. While he stopped\r\nto light it again, Midwinter walked on before him, and was the first to\r\ncome in sight of the open ground.\r\n\r\nAllan had just kindled the match, when, to his surprise, his friend came\r\nback to him round the turn in the path. There was light enough to show\r\nobjects more clearly in this part of the plantation. The match, as\r\nMidwinter faced him, dropped on the instant from Allan\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, starting back, \xe2\x80\x9cyou look as you looked on board\r\nthe Wreck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter held up his band for silence. He spoke with his wild eyes\r\nriveted on Allan\xe2\x80\x99s face, with his white lips close at Allan\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember how I _looked_,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nremember what I _said_ when you and the doctor were talking of the\r\nDream?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have forgotten the Dream,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan.\r\n\r\nAs he made that answer, Midwinter took his hand, and led him round the\r\nlast turn in the path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember it now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, and pointed to the Mere.\r\n\r\nThe sun was sinking in the cloudless westward heaven. The waters of\r\nthe Mere lay beneath, tinged red by the dying light. The open country\r\nstretched away, darkening drearily already on the right hand and the\r\nleft. And on the near margin of the pool, where all had been solitude\r\nbefore, there now stood, fronting the sunset, the figure of a woman.\r\n\r\nThe two Armadales stood together in silence, and looked at the lonely\r\nfigure and the dreary view.\r\n\r\nMidwinter was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour own eyes have seen it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow look at our own words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened the narrative of the Dream, and held it under Allan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\nHis finger pointed to the lines which recorded the first Vision; his\r\nvoice, sinking lower and lower, repeated the words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sense came to me of being left alone in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe darkness opened, and showed me the vision--as in a picture--of a\r\nbroad, lonely pool, surrounded by open ground. Above the further margin\r\nof the pool I saw the cloudless western sky, red with the light of\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the near margin of the pool there stood the Shadow of a Woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ceased, and let the hand which held the manuscript drop to his side.\r\nThe other hand pointed to the lonely figure, standing with its back\r\nturned on them, fronting the setting sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cstands the living Woman, in the Shadow\xe2\x80\x99s place! There\r\nspeaks the first of the dream warnings to you and to me! Let the future\r\ntime find us still together, and the second figure that stands in the\r\nShadow\xe2\x80\x99s place will be Mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Allan was silenced by the terrible certainty of conviction with\r\nwhich he spoke.\r\n\r\nIn the pause that followed, the figure at the pool moved, and walked\r\nslowly away round the margin of the shore. Allan stepped out beyond the\r\nlast of the trees, and gained a wider view of the open ground. The first\r\nobject that met his eyes was the pony-chaise from Thorpe Ambrose.\r\n\r\nHe turned back to Midwinter with a laugh of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense have\r\nyou been talking!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what nonsense have I been listening to!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the governess at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter made no reply. Allan took him by the arm, and tried to lead\r\nhim on. He released himself suddenly, and seized Allan with both hands,\r\nholding him back from the figure at the pool, as he had held him back\r\nfrom the cabin door on the deck of the timber ship. Once again the\r\neffort was in vain. Once again Allan broke away as easily as he had\r\nbroken away in the past time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of us must speak to her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you won\xe2\x80\x99t, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had only advanced a few steps toward the Mere, when he heard, or\r\nthought he heard, a voice faintly calling after him, once and once only,\r\nthe word Farewell. He stopped, with a feeling of uneasy surprise, and\r\nlooked round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that you, Midwinter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. After hesitating a moment more, Allan returned to\r\nthe plantation. Midwinter was gone.\r\n\r\nHe looked back at the pool, doubtful in the new emergency what to do\r\nnext. The lonely figure had altered its course in the interval; it had\r\nturned, and was advancing toward the trees. Allan had been evidently\r\neither heard or seen. It was impossible to leave a woman unbefriended,\r\nin that helpless position and in that solitary place. For the second\r\ntime Allan went out from the trees to meet her.\r\n\r\nAs he came within sight of her face, he stopped in ungovernable\r\nastonishment. The sudden revelation of her beauty, as she smiled and\r\nlooked at him inquiringly, suspended the movement in his limbs and the\r\nwords on his lips. A vague doubt beset him whether it was the governess,\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nHe roused himself, and, advancing a few paces, mentioned his name. \xe2\x80\x9cMay\r\nI ask,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cif I have the pleasure--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady met him easily and gracefully half-way. \xe2\x80\x9cMajor Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoverness,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. THE HOUSE-MAID\xe2\x80\x99S FACE.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet at Thorpe Ambrose. The hall was solitary, the rooms were\r\ndark. The servants, waiting for the supper hour in the garden at the\r\nback of the house, looked up at the clear heaven and the rising moon,\r\nand agreed that there was little prospect of the return of the picnic\r\nparty until later in the night. The general opinion, led by the high\r\nauthority of the cook, predicted that they might all sit down to supper\r\nwithout the least fear of being disturbed by the bell. Having arrived at\r\nthis conclusion, the servants assembled round the table, and exactly at\r\nthe moment when they sat down the bell rang.\r\n\r\nThe footman, wondering, went up stairs to open the door, and found to\r\nhis astonishment Midwinter waiting alone on the threshold, and looking\r\n(in the servant\xe2\x80\x99s opinion) miserably ill. He asked for a light, and,\r\nsaying he wanted nothing else, withdrew at once to his room. The footman\r\nwent back to his fellow-servants, and reported that something had\r\ncertainly happened to his master\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\r\n\r\nOn entering his room, Midwinter closed the door, and hurriedly filled a\r\nbag with the necessaries for traveling. This done, he took from a\r\nlocked drawer, and placed in the breast pocket of his coat, some little\r\npresents which Allan had given him--a cigar case, a purse, and a set\r\nof studs in plain gold. Having possessed himself of these memorials, he\r\nsnatched up the bag and laid his hand on the door. There, for the first\r\ntime, he paused. There, the headlong haste of all his actions thus far\r\nsuddenly ceased, and the hard despair in his face began to soften: he\r\nwaited, with the door in his hand.\r\n\r\nUp to that moment he had been conscious of but one motive that animated\r\nhim, but one purpose that he was resolute to achieve. \xe2\x80\x9cFor Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake!\xe2\x80\x9d he had said to himself, when he looked back toward the fatal\r\nlandscape and saw his friend leaving him to meet the woman at the pool.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Allan\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d he had said again, when he crossed the open country\r\nbeyond the wood, and saw afar, in the gray twilight, the long line of\r\nembankment and the distant glimmer of the railway lamps beckoning him\r\naway already to the iron road.\r\n\r\nIt was only when he now paused before he closed the door behind him--it\r\nwas only when his own impetuous rapidity of action came for the first\r\ntime to a check, that the nobler nature of the man rose in protest\r\nagainst the superstitious despair which was hurrying him from all that\r\nhe held dear. His conviction of the terrible necessity of leaving Allan\r\nfor Allan\xe2\x80\x99s good had not been shaken for an instant since he had seen\r\nthe first Vision of the Dream realized on the shores of the Mere. But\r\nnow, for the first time, his own heart rose against him in unanswerable\r\nrebuke. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, if you must and will! but remember the time when you were\r\nill, and he sat by your bedside; friendless, and he opened his heart to\r\nyou--and write, if you fear to speak; write and ask him to forgive you,\r\nbefore you leave him forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe half-opened door closed again softly. Midwinter sat down at the\r\nwriting-table and took up the pen.\r\n\r\nHe tried again and again, and yet again, to write the farewell words;\r\nhe tried, till the floor all round him was littered with torn sheets of\r\npaper. Turn from them which way he would, the old times still came back\r\nand faced him reproachfully. The spacious bed-chamber in which he\r\nsat, narrowed, in spite of him, to the sick usher\xe2\x80\x99s garret at the\r\nwest-country inn. The kind hand that had once patted him on the\r\nshoulder touched him again; the kind voice that had cheered him spoke\r\nunchangeably in the old friendly tones. He flung his arms on the table\r\nand dropped his head on them in tearless despair. The parting words\r\nthat his tongue was powerless to utter his pen was powerless to write.\r\nMercilessly in earnest, his superstition pointed to him to go while the\r\ntime was his own. Mercilessly in earnest, his love for Allan held him\r\nback till the farewell plea for pardon and pity was written.\r\n\r\nHe rose with a sudden resolution, and rang for the servant, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Mr.\r\nArmadale returns,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cask him to excuse my coming downstairs, and\r\nsay that I am trying to get to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d He locked the door and put out\r\nthe light, and sat down alone in the darkness. \xe2\x80\x9cThe night will keep us\r\napart,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand time may help me to write. I may go in the early\r\nmorning; I may go while--\xe2\x80\x9d The thought died in him uncompleted; and\r\nthe sharp agony of the struggle forced to his lips the first cry of\r\nsuffering that had escaped him yet.\r\n\r\nHe waited in the darkness.\r\n\r\nAs the time stole on, his senses remained mechanically awake, but his\r\nmind began to sink slowly under the heavy strain that had now been laid\r\non it for some hours past. A dull vacancy possessed him; he made no\r\nattempt to kindle the light and write once more. He never started; he\r\nnever moved to the open window, when the first sound of approaching\r\nwheels broke in on the silence of the night. He heard the carriages draw\r\nup at the door; he heard the horses champing their bits; he heard the\r\nvoices of Allan and young Pedgift on the steps; and still he sat quiet\r\nin the darkness, and still no interest was aroused in him by the sounds\r\nthat reached his ear from outside.\r\n\r\nThe voices remained audible after the carriages had been driven away;\r\nthe two young men were evidently lingering on the steps before they took\r\nleave of each other. Every word they said reached Midwinter through the\r\nopen window. Their one subject of conversation was the new governess.\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s voice was loud in her praise. He had never passed such an hour\r\nof delight in his life as the hour he had spent with Miss Gwilt in the\r\nboat, on the way from Hurle Mere to the picnic party waiting at the\r\nother Broad. Agreeing, on his side, with all that his client said in\r\npraise of the charming stranger, young Pedgift appeared to treat the\r\nsubject, when it fell into his hands, from a different point of view.\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s attractions had not so entirely absorbed his attention as\r\nto prevent him from noticing the impression which the new governess had\r\nproduced on her employer and her pupil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a screw loose somewhere, sir, in Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s family,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the voice of young Pedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice how the major and his\r\ndaughter looked when Miss Gwilt made her excuses for being late at the\r\nMere? You don\xe2\x80\x99t remember? Do you remember what Miss Gwilt said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething about Mrs. Milroy, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Allan rejoined.\r\n\r\nYoung Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s voice dropped mysteriously a note lower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt reached the cottage this afternoon, sir, at the time when I\r\ntold you she would reach it, and she would have joined us at the time I\r\ntold you she would come, but for Mrs. Milroy. Mrs. Milroy sent for her\r\nupstairs as soon as she entered the house, and kept her upstairs a good\r\nhalf-hour and more. That was Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s excuse, Mr. Armadale, for\r\nbeing late at the Mere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to forget, sir, what the whole neighborhood has heard about\r\nMrs. Milroy ever since the major first settled among us. We have all\r\nbeen told, on the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s own authority, that she is too great a\r\nsufferer to see strangers. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a little odd that she should have\r\nsuddenly turned out well enough to see Miss Gwilt (in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence) the moment Miss Gwilt entered the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it! Of course she was anxious to make acquaintance with\r\nher daughter\xe2\x80\x99s governess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikely enough, Mr. Armadale. But the major and Miss Neelie don\xe2\x80\x99t see it\r\nin that light, at any rate. I had my eye on them both when the governess\r\ntold them that Mrs. Milroy had sent for her. If ever I saw a girl look\r\nthoroughly frightened, Miss Milroy was that girl; and (if I may be\r\nallowed, in the strictest confidence, to libel a gallant soldier) I\r\nshould say that the major himself was much in the same condition. Take\r\nmy word for it, sir, there\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong upstairs in that pretty\r\ncottage of yours; and Miss Gwilt is mixed up in it already!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a minute of silence. When the voices were next heard by\r\nMidwinter, they were further away from the house--Allan was probably\r\naccompanying young Pedgift a few steps on his way back.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, Allan\xe2\x80\x99s voice was audible once more under the portico,\r\nmaking inquiries after his friend; answered by the servant\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\ngiving Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s message. This brief interruption over, the silence\r\nwas not broken again till the time came for shutting up the house. The\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 footsteps passing to and fro, the clang of closing doors,\r\nthe barking of a disturbed dog in the stable-yard--these sounds warned\r\nMidwinter it was getting late. He rose mechanically to kindle a light.\r\nBut his head was giddy, his hand trembled; he laid aside the match-box,\r\nand returned to his chair. The conversation between Allan and young\r\nPedgift had ceased to occupy his attention the instant he ceased to\r\nhear it; and now again, the sense that the precious time was failing him\r\nbecame a lost sense as soon as the house noises which had awakened it\r\nhad passed away. His energies of body and mind were both alike worn out;\r\nhe waited with a stolid resignation for the trouble that was to come to\r\nhim with the coming day.\r\n\r\nAn interval passed, and the silence was once more disturbed by voices\r\noutside; the voices of a man and a woman this time. The first few\r\nwords exchanged between them indicated plainly enough a meeting of the\r\nclandestine kind; and revealed the man as one of the servants at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose, and the woman as one of the servants at the cottage.\r\n\r\nHere again, after the first greetings were over, the subject of the new\r\ngoverness became the all-absorbing subject of conversation.\r\n\r\nThe major\xe2\x80\x99s servant was brimful of forebodings (inspired solely by\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s good looks) which she poured out irrepressibly on her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csweetheart,\xe2\x80\x9d try as he might to divert her to other topics. Sooner or\r\nlater, let him mark her words, there would be an awful \xe2\x80\x9cupset\xe2\x80\x9d at the\r\ncottage. Her master, it might be mentioned in confidence, led a dreadful\r\nlife with her mistress. The major was the best of men; he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nthought in his heart beyond his daughter and his everlasting clock. But\r\nonly let a nice-looking woman come near the place, and Mrs. Milroy\r\nwas jealous of her--raging jealous, like a woman possessed, on\r\nthat miserable sick-bed of hers. If Miss Gwilt (who was certainly\r\ngood-looking, in spite of her hideous hair) didn\xe2\x80\x99t blow the fire into a\r\nflame before many days more were over their heads, the mistress was the\r\nmistress no longer, but somebody else. Whatever happened, the fault,\r\nthis time, would lie at the door of the major\xe2\x80\x99s mother. The old lady\r\nand the mistress had had a dreadful quarrel two years since; and the old\r\nlady had gone away in a fury, telling her son, before all the servants,\r\nthat, if he had a spark of spirit in him, he would never submit to his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s temper as he did. It would be too much, perhaps, to accuse the\r\nmajor\xe2\x80\x99s mother of purposely picking out a handsome governess to spite\r\nthe major\xe2\x80\x99s wife. But it might be safely said that the old lady was the\r\nlast person in the world to humor the mistress\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy, by declining\r\nto engage a capable and respectable governess for her granddaughter\r\nbecause that governess happened to be blessed with good looks. How\r\nit was all to end (except that it was certain to end badly) no human\r\ncreature could say. Things were looking as black already as things well\r\ncould. Miss Neelie was crying, after the day\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure (which was one\r\nbad sign); the mistress had found fault with nobody (which was another);\r\nthe master had wished her good-night through the door (which was a\r\nthird); and the governess had locked herself up in her room (which was\r\nthe worst sign of all, for it looked as if she distrusted the servants).\r\nThus the stream of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s gossip ran on, and thus it reached\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s ears through the window, till the clock in the stable-yard\r\nstruck, and stopped the talking. When the last vibrations of the bell\r\nhad died away, the voices were not audible again, and the silence was\r\nbroken no more.\r\n\r\nAnother interval passed, and Midwinter made a new effort to rouse\r\nhimself. This time he kindled the light without hesitation, and took the\r\npen in hand.\r\n\r\nHe wrote at the first trial with a sudden facility of expression,\r\nwhich, surprising him as he went on, ended in rousing in him some vague\r\nsuspicion of himself. He left the table, and bathed his head and face\r\nin water, and came back to read what he had written. The language\r\nwas barely intelligible; sentences were left unfinished; words were\r\nmisplaced one for the other. Every line recorded the protest of the\r\nweary brain against the merciless will that had forced it into action.\r\nMidwinter tore up the sheet of paper as he had torn up the other sheets\r\nbefore it, and, sinking under the struggle at last, laid his weary\r\nhead on the pillow. Almost on the instant, exhaustion overcame him, and\r\nbefore he could put the light out he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nHe was roused by a noise at the door. The sunlight was pouring into the\r\nroom, the candle had burned down into the socket, and the servant was\r\nwaiting outside with a letter which had come for him by the morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ventured to disturb you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, when Midwinter opened\r\nthe door, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the letter is marked \xe2\x80\x98Immediate,\xe2\x80\x99 and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nbut it might be of some consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter thanked him, and looked at the letter. It _was_ of some\r\nconsequence--the handwriting was Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nHe paused to collect his faculties. The torn sheets of paper on the\r\nfloor recalled to him in a moment the position in which he stood. He\r\nlocked the door again, in the fear that Allan might rise earlier than\r\nusual and come in to make inquiries. Then--feeling strangely little\r\ninterest in anything that the rector could write to him now--he opened\r\nMr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and read these lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTuesday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MIDWINTER--It is sometimes best to tell bad news plainly, in\r\nfew words. Let me tell mine at once, in one sentence. My precautions\r\nhave all been defeated: the woman has escaped me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis misfortune--for it is nothing less--happened yesterday (Monday).\r\nBetween eleven and twelve in the forenoon of that day, the business\r\nwhich originally brought me to London obliged me to go to Doctors\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCommons, and to leave my servant Robert to watch the house opposite our\r\nlodging until my return. About an hour and a half after my departure he\r\nobserved an empty cab drawn up at the door of the house. Boxes and bags\r\nmade their appearance first; they were followed by the woman herself,\r\nin the dress I had first seen her in. Having previously secured a cab,\r\nRobert traced her to the terminus of the North-Western Railway, saw her\r\npass through the ticket office, kept her in view till she reached the\r\nplatform, and there, in the crowd and confusion caused by the starting\r\nof a large mixed train, lost her. I must do him the justice to say that\r\nhe at once took the right course in this emergency. Instead of wasting\r\ntime in searching for her on the platform, he looked along the line of\r\ncarriages; and he positively declares that he failed to see her in any\r\none of them. He admits, at the same time, that his search (conducted\r\nbetween two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when he lost sight of her, and ten minutes past,\r\nwhen the train started) was, in the confusion of the moment, necessarily\r\nan imperfect one. But this latter circumstance, in my opinion, matters\r\nlittle. I as firmly disbelieve in the woman\xe2\x80\x99s actual departure by that\r\ntrain as if I had searched every one of the carriages myself; and you, I\r\nhave no doubt, will entirely agree with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou now know how the disaster happened. Let us not waste time and words\r\nin lamenting it. The evil is done, and you and I together must find the\r\nway to remedy it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I have accomplished already, on my side, may be told in two words.\r\nAny hesitation I might have previously felt at trusting this delicate\r\nbusiness in strangers\xe2\x80\x99 hands was at an end the moment I heard Robert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnews. I went back at once to the city, and placed the whole matter\r\nconfidentially before my lawyers. The conference was a long one, and\r\nwhen I left the office it was past the post hour, or I should have\r\nwritten to you on Monday instead of writing to-day. My interview with\r\nthe lawyers was not very encouraging. They warn me plainly that serious\r\ndifficulties stand in the way of our recovering the lost trace. But they\r\nhave promised to do their best, and we have decided on the course to be\r\ntaken, excepting one point on which we totally differ. I must tell you\r\nwhat this difference is; for, while business keeps me away from Thorpe\r\nAmbrose, you are the only person whom I can trust to put my convictions\r\nto the test.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lawyers are of opinion, then, that the woman has been aware from\r\nthe first that I was watching her; that there is, consequently, no\r\npresent hope of her being rash enough to appear personally at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose; that any mischief she may have it in contemplation to do will\r\nbe done in the first instance by deputy; and that the only wise course\r\nfor Allan\xe2\x80\x99s friends and guardians to take is to wait passively till\r\nevents enlighten them. My own idea is diametrically opposed to this.\r\nAfter what has happened at the railway, I cannot deny that the woman\r\nmust have discovered that I was watching her. But she has no reason to\r\nsuppose that she has not succeeded in deceiving me; and I firmly believe\r\nshe is bold enough to take us by surprise, and to win or force her way\r\ninto Allan\xe2\x80\x99s confidence before we are prepared to prevent her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and you only (while I am detained in London) can decide whether\r\nI am right or wrong--and you can do it in this way. Ascertain at once\r\nwhether any woman who is a stranger in the neighborhood has appeared\r\nsince Monday last at or near Thorpe Ambrose. If any such person has been\r\nobserved (and nobody escapes observation in the country), take the first\r\nopportunity you can get of seeing her, and ask yourself if her face does\r\nor does not answer certain plain questions which I am now about to write\r\ndown for you. You may depend on my accuracy. I saw the woman unveiled on\r\nmore than one occasion, and the last time through an excellent glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c1. Is her hair light brown, and (apparently) not very plentiful? 2. Is\r\nher forehead high, narrow, and sloping backward from the brow? 3. Are\r\nher eyebrows very faintly marked, and are her eyes small, and nearer\r\ndark than light--either gray or hazel (I have not seen her close enough\r\nto be certain which)? 4. Is her nose aquiline? 5 Are her lips thin, and\r\nis the upper lip long? 6. Does her complexion look like an originally\r\nfair complexion, which has deteriorated into a dull, sickly paleness? 7\r\n(and lastly). Has she a retreating chin, and is there on the left side\r\nof it a mark of some kind--a mole or a scar, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say which?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI add nothing about her expression, for you may see her under\r\ncircumstances which may partially alter it as seen by me. Test her by\r\nher features, which no circumstances can change. If there is a stranger\r\nin the neighborhood, and if her face answers my seven questions, _you\r\nhave found the woman_! Go instantly, in that case, to the nearest\r\nlawyer, and pledge my name and credit for whatever expenses may be\r\nincurred in keeping her under inspection night and day. Having done\r\nthis, take the speediest means of communicating with me; and whether\r\nmy business is finished or not, I will start for Norfolk by the first\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways your friend, DECIMUS BROCK.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHardened by the fatalist conviction that now possessed him, Midwinter\r\nread the rector\xe2\x80\x99s confession of defeat, from the first line to the last,\r\nwithout the slightest betrayal either of interest or surprise. The one\r\npart of the letter at which he looked back was the closing part of it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI owe much to Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; \xe2\x80\x9cand I shall never see\r\nMr. Brock again. It is useless and hopeless; but he asks me to do it,\r\nand it shall be done. A moment\xe2\x80\x99s look at her will be enough--a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlook at her with his letter in my hand--and a line to tell him that the\r\nwoman is here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he stood hesitating at the half-opened door; again the cruel\r\nnecessity of writing his farewell to Allan stopped him, and stared him\r\nin the face.\r\n\r\nHe looked aside doubtingly at the rector\xe2\x80\x99s letter. \xe2\x80\x9cI will write the two\r\ntogether,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne may help the other.\xe2\x80\x9d His face flushed deep as\r\nthe words escaped him. He was conscious of doing what he had not done\r\nyet--of voluntarily putting off the evil hour; of making Mr. Brock the\r\npretext for gaining the last respite left, the respite of time.\r\n\r\nThe only sound that reached him through the open door was the sound of\r\nAllan stirring noisily in the next room. He stepped at once into the\r\nempty corridor, and meeting no one on the stairs, made his way out of\r\nthe house. The dread that his resolution to leave Allan might fail him\r\nif he saw Allan again was as vividly present to his mind in the morning\r\nas it had been all through the night. He drew a deep breath of relief\r\nas he descended the house steps--relief at having escaped the friendly\r\ngreeting of the morning, from the one human creature whom he loved!\r\n\r\nHe entered the shrubbery with Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s letter in his hand, and took\r\nthe nearest way that led to the major\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. Not the slightest\r\nrecollection was in his mind of the talk which had found its way to his\r\nears during the night. His one reason for determining to see the woman\r\nwas the reason which the rector had put in his mind. The one remembrance\r\nthat now guided him to the place in which she lived was the remembrance\r\nof Allan\xe2\x80\x99s exclamation when he first identified the governess with the\r\nfigure at the pool.\r\n\r\nArrived at the gate of the cottage, he stopped. The thought struck\r\nhim that he might defeat his own object if he looked at the rector\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquestions in the woman\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Her suspicions would be probably\r\nroused, in the first instance, by his asking to see her (as he had\r\ndetermined to ask, with or without an excuse), and the appearance of the\r\nletter in his hand might confirm them.\r\n\r\nShe might defeat him by instantly leaving the room. Determined to fix\r\nthe description in his mind first, and then to confront her, he opened\r\nthe letter; and, turning away slowly by the side of the house, read the\r\nseven questions which he felt absolutely assured beforehand the woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface would answer.\r\n\r\nIn the morning quiet of the park slight noises traveled far. A slight\r\nnoise disturbed Midwinter over the letter.\r\n\r\nHe looked up and found himself on the brink of a broad grassy trench,\r\nhaving the park on one side and the high laurel hedge of an inclosure\r\non the other. The inclosure evidently surrounded the back garden of the\r\ncottage, and the trench was intended to protect it from being damaged by\r\nthe cattle grazing in the park.\r\n\r\nListening carefully as the slight sound which had disturbed him grew\r\nfainter, he recognized in it the rustling of women\xe2\x80\x99s dresses. A few\r\npaces ahead, the trench was crossed by a bridge (closed by a wicket\r\ngate) which connected the garden with the park. He passed through the\r\ngate, crossed the bridge, and, opening a door at the other end, found\r\nhimself in a summer-house thickly covered with creepers, and commanding\r\na full view of the garden from end to end.\r\n\r\nHe looked, and saw the figures of two ladies walking slowly away from\r\nhim toward the cottage. The shorter of the two failed to occupy his\r\nattention for an instant; he never stopped to think whether she was\r\nor was not the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. His eyes were riveted on the other\r\nfigure--the figure that moved over the garden walk with the long,\r\nlightly falling dress and the easy, seductive grace. There, presented\r\nexactly as he had seen her once already--there, with her back again\r\nturned on him, was the Woman at the pool!\r\n\r\nThere was a chance that they might take another turn in the garden--a\r\nturn back toward the summer-house. On that chance Midwinter waited. No\r\nconsciousness of the intrusion that he was committing had stopped him\r\nat the door of the summer-house, and no consciousness of it troubled him\r\neven now. Every finer sensibility in his nature, sinking under the cruel\r\nlaceration of the past night, had ceased to feel. The dogged resolution\r\nto do what he had come to do was the one animating influence left alive\r\nin him. He acted, he even looked, as the most stolid man living might\r\nhave acted and looked in his place. He was self-possessed enough, in the\r\ninterval of expectation before governess and pupil reached the end of\r\nthe walk, to open Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and to fortify his memory by a\r\nlast look at the paragraph which described her face.\r\n\r\nHe was still absorbed over the description when he heard the smooth\r\nrustle of the dresses traveling toward him again. Standing in the shadow\r\nof the summer-house, he waited while she lessened the distance between\r\nthem. With her written portrait vividly impressed on his mind, and with\r\nthe clear light of the morning to help him, his eyes questioned her as\r\nshe came on; and these were the answers that her face gave him back.\r\n\r\nThe hair in the rector\xe2\x80\x99s description was light brown and not plentiful.\r\nThis woman\xe2\x80\x99s hair, superbly luxuriant in its growth, was of the one\r\nunpardonably remarkable shade of color which the prejudice of the\r\nNorthern nations never entirely forgives--it was _red_! The forehead in\r\nthe rector\xe2\x80\x99s description was high, narrow, and sloping backward from the\r\nbrow; the eyebrows were faintly marked; and the eyes small, and in color\r\neither gray or hazel. This woman\xe2\x80\x99s forehead was low, upright, and\r\nbroad toward the temples; her eyebrows, at once strongly and delicately\r\nmarked, were a shade darker than her hair; her eyes, large, bright, and\r\nwell opened, were of that purely blue color, without a tinge in it of\r\ngray or green, so often presented to our admiration in pictures and\r\nbooks, so rarely met with in the living face. The nose in the rector\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndescription was aquiline. The line of this woman\xe2\x80\x99s nose bent neither\r\noutward nor inward: it was the straight, delicately molded nose (with\r\nthe short upper lip beneath) of the ancient statues and busts. The\r\nlips in the rector\xe2\x80\x99s description were thin and the upper lip long; the\r\ncomplexion was of a dull, sickly paleness; the chin retreating and the\r\nmark of a mole or a scar on the left side of it. This woman\xe2\x80\x99s lips were\r\nfull, rich, and sensual. Her complexion was the lovely complexion which\r\naccompanies such hair as hers--so delicately bright in its rosier tints,\r\nso warmly and softly white in its gentler gradations of color on the\r\nforehead and the neck. Her chin, round and dimpled, was pure of the\r\nslightest blemish in every part of it, and perfectly in line with her\r\nforehead to the end. Nearer and nearer, and fairer and fairer she\r\ncame, in the glow of the morning light--the most startling, the most\r\nunanswerable contradiction that eye could see or mind conceive to the\r\ndescription in the rector\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\nBoth governess and pupil were close to the summer-house before they\r\nlooked that way, and noticed Midwinter standing inside. The governess\r\nsaw him first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend of yours, Miss Milroy?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, quietly, without starting\r\nor betraying any sign of surprise.\r\n\r\nNeelie recognized him instantly. Prejudiced against Midwinter by his\r\nconduct when his friend had introduced him at the cottage, she now\r\nfairly detested him as the unlucky first cause of her misunderstanding\r\nwith Allan at the picnic. Her face flushed and she drew back from the\r\nsummerhouse with an expression of merciless surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a friend of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat he wants, or why he is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d The governess\xe2\x80\x99s face lighted up with\r\na suddenly roused interest as she repeated the words. She returned\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s look, still steadily fixed on her, with equal steadiness on\r\nher side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Neelie, resenting Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s insensibility to\r\nher presence on the scene, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it a great liberty to treat papa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngarden as if it were the open park!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe governess turned round, and gently interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Miss Milroy,\xe2\x80\x9d she remonstrated, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are certain distinctions\r\nto be observed. This gentleman is a friend of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s. You could\r\nhardly express yourself more strongly if he was a perfect stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI express my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Neelie, chafing under the satirically\r\nindulgent tone in which the governess addressed her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of\r\ntaste, Miss Gwilt; and tastes differ.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned away petulantly, and\r\nwalked back by herself to the cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very young,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gwilt, appealing with a smile to\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s forbearance; \xe2\x80\x9cand, as you must see for yourself, sir, she is\r\na spoiled child.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused--showed, for an instant only, her surprise\r\nat Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s strange silence and strange persistency in keeping his\r\neyes still fixed on her--then set herself, with a charming grace and\r\nreadiness, to help him out of the false position in which he stood. \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\nyou have extended your walk thus far,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps you will\r\nkindly favor me, on your return, by taking a message to your friend?\r\nMr. Armadale has been so good as to invite me to see the Thorpe Ambrose\r\ngardens this morning. Will you say that Major Milroy permits me to\r\naccept the invitation (in company with Miss Milroy) between ten and\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock?\xe2\x80\x9d For a moment her eyes rested, with a renewed look\r\nof interest, on Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s face. She waited, still in vain, for an\r\nanswering word from him--smiled, as if his extraordinary silence amused\r\nrather than angered her--and followed her pupil back to the cottage.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was only when the last trace of her had disappeared that Midwinter\r\nroused himself, and attempted to realize the position in which he\r\nstood. The revelation of her beauty was in no respect answerable for\r\nthe breathless astonishment which had held him spell-bound up to this\r\nmoment. The one clear impression she had produced on him thus far began\r\nand ended with his discovery of the astounding contradiction that her\r\nface offered, in one feature after another, to the description in Mr.\r\nBrock\xe2\x80\x99s letter. All beyond this was vague and misty--a dim consciousness\r\nof a tall, elegant woman, and of kind words, modestly and gracefully\r\nspoken to him, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nHe advanced a few steps into the garden without knowing why--stopped,\r\nglancing hither and thither like a man lost--recognized the summer-house\r\nby an effort, as if years had elapsed since he had seen it--and made his\r\nway out again, at last, into the park. Even here, he wandered first in\r\none direction, then in another. His mind was still reeling under\r\nthe shock that had fallen on it; his perceptions were all confused.\r\nSomething kept him mechanically in action, walking eagerly without a\r\nmotive, walking he knew not where.\r\n\r\nA far less sensitively organized man might have been overwhelmed, as\r\nhe was overwhelmed now, by the immense, the instantaneous revulsion of\r\nfeeling which the event of the last few minutes had wrought in his mind.\r\n\r\nAt the memorable instant when he had opened the door of the\r\nsummer-house, no confusing influence troubled his faculties. In all that\r\nrelated to his position toward his friend, he had reached an absolutely\r\ndefinite conclusion by an absolutely definite process of thought. The\r\nwhole strength of the motive which had driven him into the resolution\r\nto part from Allan rooted itself in the belief that he had seen at Hurle\r\nMere the fatal fulfillment of the first Vision of the Dream. And this\r\nbelief, in its turn, rested, necessarily, on the conviction that the\r\nwoman who was the one survivor of the tragedy in Madeira must be also\r\ninevitably the woman whom he had seen standing in the Shadow\xe2\x80\x99s place at\r\nthe pool. Firm in that persuasion, he had himself compared the object of\r\nhis distrust and of the rector\xe2\x80\x99s distrust with the description written\r\nby the rector himself--a description, carefully minute, by a man\r\nentirely trustworthy--and his own eyes had informed him that the\r\nwoman whom he had seen at the Mere, and the woman whom Mr. Brock had\r\nidentified in London, were not one, but Two. In the place of the Dream\r\nShadow, there had stood, on the evidence of the rector\xe2\x80\x99s letter, not the\r\ninstrument of the Fatality--but a stranger!\r\n\r\nNo such doubts as might have troubled a less superstitious man, were\r\nstarted in _his_ mind by the discovery that had now opened on him.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to him to ask himself whether a stranger might not\r\nbe the appointed instrument of the Fatality, now when the letter had\r\npersuaded him that a stranger had been revealed as the figure in the\r\ndream landscape. No such idea entered or could enter his mind. The one\r\nwoman whom _his_ superstition dreaded was the woman who had entwined\r\nherself with the lives of the two Armadales in the first generation, and\r\nwith the fortunes of the two Armadales in the second--who was at once\r\nthe marked object of his father\xe2\x80\x99s death-bed warning, and the first cause\r\nof the family calamities which had opened Allan\xe2\x80\x99s way to the Thorpe\r\nAmbrose estate--the woman, in a word, whom he would have known\r\ninstinctively, but for Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s letter, to be the woman whom he had\r\nnow actually seen.\r\n\r\nLooking at events as they had just happened, under the influence of the\r\nmisapprehension into which the rector had innocently misled him, his\r\nmind saw and seized its new conclusion instantaneously, acting precisely\r\nas it had acted in the past time of his interview with Mr. Brock at the\r\nIsle of Man.\r\n\r\nExactly as he had once declared it to be an all-sufficient refutation of\r\nthe idea of the Fatality, that he had never met with the timber-ship\r\nin any of his voyages at sea, so he now seized on the similarly derived\r\nconclusion, that the whole claim of the Dream to a supernatural origin\r\nstood self-refuted by the disclosure of a stranger in the Shadow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace. Once started from this point--once encouraged to let his love for\r\nAllan influence him undividedly again, his mind hurried along the whole\r\nresulting chain of thought at lightning speed. If the Dream was proved\r\nto be no longer a warning from the other world, it followed inevitably\r\nthat accident and not fate had led the way to the night on the Wreck,\r\nand that all the events which had happened since Allan and he had\r\nparted from Mr. Brock were events in themselves harmless, which his\r\nsuperstition had distorted from their proper shape. In less than a\r\nmoment his mobile imagination had taken him back to the morning at\r\nCastletown when he had revealed to the rector the secret of his name;\r\nwhen he had declared to the rector, with his father\xe2\x80\x99s letter before his\r\neyes, the better faith that was in him. Now once more he felt his heart\r\nholding firmly by the bond of brotherhood between Allan and himself; now\r\nonce more he could say with the eager sincerity of the old time, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the\r\nthought of leaving him breaks my heart, the thought of leaving him\r\nis wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d As that nobler conviction possessed itself again of his\r\nmind--quieting the tumult, clearing the confusion within him--the house\r\nat Thorpe Ambrose, with Allan on the steps, waiting, looking for him,\r\nopened on his eyes through the trees. A sense of illimitable relief\r\nlifted his eager spirit high above the cares, and doubts, and fears\r\nthat had oppressed it so long, and showed him once more the better and\r\nbrighter future of his early dreams. His eyes filled with tears, and he\r\npressed the rector\xe2\x80\x99s letter, in his wild, passionate way, to his lips,\r\nas he looked at Allan through the vista of the trees. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for this\r\nmorsel of paper,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cmy life might have been one long sorrow\r\nto me, and my father\xe2\x80\x99s crime might have parted us forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of the stratagem which had shown the housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface to Mr. Brock as the face of Miss Gwilt. And so--by shaking\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s trust in his own superstition, in the one case in which\r\nthat superstition pointed to the truth--did Mother Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s cunning\r\ntriumph over difficulties and dangers which had never been contemplated\r\nby Mother Oldershaw herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. MISS GWILT AMONG THE QUICKSANDS.\r\n\r\n1. _From the Rev. Decimus Brock to Ozias Midwinter_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThursday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MIDWINTER--No words can tell what a relief it was to me to get\r\nyour letter this morning, and what a happiness I honestly feel in having\r\nbeen thus far proved to be in the wrong. The precautions you have taken\r\nin case the woman should still confirm my apprehensions by venturing\r\nherself at Thorpe Ambrose seem to me to be all that can be desired. You\r\nare no doubt sure to hear of her from one or other of the people in the\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s office, whom you have asked to inform you of the appearance of\r\na stranger in the town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the more pleased at finding how entirely I can trust you in this\r\nmatter; for I am likely to be obliged to leave Allan\xe2\x80\x99s interests longer\r\nthan I supposed solely in your hands. My visit to Thorpe Ambrose must,\r\nI regret to say, be deferred for two months. The only one of my\r\nbrother-clergymen in London who is able to take my duty for me cannot\r\nmake it convenient to remove with his family to Somersetshire before\r\nthat time. I have no alternative but to finish my business here, and be\r\nback at my rectory on Saturday next. If anything happens, you will,\r\nof course, instantly communicate with me; and, in that case, be the\r\ninconvenience what it may, I must leave home for Thorpe Ambrose. If,\r\non the other hand, all goes more smoothly than my own obstinate\r\napprehensions will allow me to suppose, then Allan (to whom I have\r\nwritten) must not expect to see me till this day two months.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo result has, up to this time, rewarded our exertions to recover the\r\ntrace lost at the railway. I will keep my letter open, however, until\r\npost time, in case the next few hours bring any news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways truly yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDECIMUS BROCK.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP. S.--I have just heard from the lawyers. They have found out the name\r\nthe woman passed by in London. If this discovery (not a very important\r\none, I am afraid) suggests any new course of proceeding to you, pray act\r\non it at once. The name is--Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _From Miss Gwilt to Mrs. Oldershaw_.\r\n\r\nThe Cottage, Thorpe Ambrose, Saturday, June 28.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will promise not to be alarmed, Mamma Oldershaw, I will begin\r\nthis letter in a very odd way, by copying a page of a letter written\r\nby somebody else. You have an excellent memory, and you may not have\r\nforgotten that I received a note from Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s mother (after she\r\nhad engaged me as governess) on Monday last. It was dated and signed;\r\nand here it is, as far as the first page: \xe2\x80\x98June 23d, 1851. Dear\r\nMadam--Pray excuse my troubling you, before you go to Thorpe Ambrose,\r\nwith a word more about the habits observed in my son\xe2\x80\x99s household. When\r\nI had the pleasure of seeing you at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-day, in Kingsdown\r\nCrescent, I had another appointment in a distant part of London at\r\nthree; and, in the hurry of the moment, one or two little matters\r\nescaped me which I think I ought to impress on your attention.\xe2\x80\x99 The rest\r\nof the letter is not of the slightest importance, but the lines that I\r\nhave just copied are well worthy of all the attention you can bestow on\r\nthem. They have saved me from discovery, my dear, before I have been a\r\nweek in Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s service!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt happened no later than yesterday evening, and it began and ended in\r\nthis manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a gentleman here, (of whom I shall have more to say presently)\r\nwho is an intimate friend of young Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s, and who bears the strange\r\nname of Midwinter. He contrived yesterday to speak to me alone in the\r\npark. Almost as soon as he opened his lips, I found that my name had\r\nbeen discovered in London (no doubt by the Somersetshire clergyman);\r\nand that Mr. Midwinter had been chosen (evidently by the same person)\r\nto identify the Miss Gwilt who had vanished from Brompton with the Miss\r\nGwilt who had appeared at Thorpe Ambrose. You foresaw this danger, I\r\nremember; but you could scarcely have imagined that the exposure would\r\nthreaten me so soon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spare you the details of our conversation to come to the end.\r\nMr. Midwinter put the matter very delicately, declaring, to my great\r\nsurprise, that he felt quite certain himself that I was not the Miss\r\nGwilt of whom his friend was in search; and that he only acted as he did\r\nout of regard to the anxiety of a person whose wishes he was bound to\r\nrespect. Would I assist him in setting that anxiety completely at rest,\r\nas far as I was concerned, by kindly answering one plain question--which\r\nhe had no other right to ask me than the right my indulgence might\r\ngive him? The lost \xe2\x80\x98Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99 had been missed on Monday last, at two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, in the crowd on the platform of the North-western Railway, in\r\nEuston Square. Would I authorize him to say that on that day, and at\r\nthat hour, the Miss Gwilt who was Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s governess had never\r\nbeen near the place?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need hardly tell you that I seized the fine opportunity he had given\r\nme of disarming all future suspicion. I took a high tone on the spot,\r\nand met him with the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s letter. He politely refused to look at\r\nit. I insisted on his looking at it. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t choose to be mistaken,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI said, \xe2\x80\x98for a woman who may be a bad character, because she happens\r\nto bear, or to have assumed, the same name as mine. I insist on your\r\nreading the first part of this letter for my satisfaction, if not for\r\nyour own.\xe2\x80\x99 He was obliged to comply; and there was the proof, in the old\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, that, at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Monday last, she and I were\r\ntogether in Kingsdown Crescent, which any directory would tell him is a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98crescent\xe2\x80\x99 in Bayswater! I leave you to imagine his apologies, and the\r\nperfect sweetness with which I received them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might, of course, if I had not preserved the letter, have referred\r\nhim to you, or to the major\xe2\x80\x99s mother, with similar results. As it is,\r\nthe object has been gained without trouble or delay. _I have been proved\r\nnot to be myself_; and one of the many dangers that threatened me\r\nat Thorpe Ambrose is a danger blown over from this moment. Your\r\nhouse-maid\xe2\x80\x99s face may not be a very handsome one; but there is no\r\ndenying that it has done us excellent service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much for the past; now for the future. You shall hear how I get\r\non with the people about me; and you shall judge for yourself what the\r\nchances are for and against my becoming mistress of Thorpe Ambrose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me begin with young Armadale--because it is beginning with good\r\nnews. I have produced the right impression on him already, and Heaven\r\nknows _that_ is nothing to boast of! Any moderately good-looking woman\r\nwho chose to take the trouble could make him fall in love with her. He\r\nis a rattle-pated young fool--one of those noisy, rosy, light-haired,\r\ngood-tempered men whom I particularly detest. I had a whole hour alone\r\nwith him in a boat, the first day I came here, and I have made good use\r\nof my time, I can tell you, from that day to this. The only difficulty\r\nwith him is the difficulty of concealing my own feelings, especially\r\nwhen he turns my dislike of him into downright hatred by sometimes\r\nreminding me of his mother. I really never saw a man whom I could use\r\nso ill, if I had the opportunity. He will give me the opportunity, I\r\nbelieve, if no accident happens, sooner than we calculated on. I have\r\njust returned from a party at the great house, in celebration of the\r\nrent-day dinner, and the squire\xe2\x80\x99s attentions to me, and my modest\r\nreluctance to receive them, have already excited general remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy pupil, Miss Milroy, comes next. She, too, is rosy and foolish;\r\nand, what is more, awkward and squat and freckled, and ill-tempered and\r\nill-dressed. No fear of _her_, though she hates me like poison, which\r\nis a great comfort, for I get rid of her out of lesson time and walking\r\ntime. It is perfectly easy to see that she has made the most of her\r\nopportunities with young Armadale (opportunities, by-the-by, which we\r\nnever calculated on), and that she has been stupid enough to let him\r\nslip through her fingers. When I tell you that she is obliged, for\r\nthe sake of appearances, to go with her father and me to the little\r\nentertainments at Thorpe Ambrose, and to see how young Armadale admires\r\nme, you will understand the kind of place I hold in her affections. She\r\nwould try me past all endurance if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that I aggravate her by\r\nkeeping my temper, so, of course, I keep it. If I do break out, it will\r\nbe over our lessons--not over our French, our grammar, history, and\r\nglobes--but over our music. No words can say how I feel for her poor\r\npiano. Half the musical girls in England ought to have their fingers\r\nchopped off in the interests of society, and, if I had my way, Miss\r\nMilroy\xe2\x80\x99s fingers should be executed first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for the major, I can hardly stand higher in his estimation than I\r\nstand already. I am always ready to make his breakfast, and his daughter\r\nis not. I can always find things for him when he loses them, and his\r\ndaughter can\xe2\x80\x99t. I never yawn when he proses, and his daughter does. I\r\nlike the poor dear harmless old gentleman, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t say a word more\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here is a fair prospect for the future surely? My good Oldershaw,\r\nthere never was a prospect yet without an ugly place in it. _My_\r\nprospect has two ugly places in it. The name of one of them is Mrs.\r\nMilroy, and the name of the other is Mr. Midwinter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Milroy first. Before I had been five minutes in the cottage, on\r\nthe day of my arrival, what do you think she did? She sent downstairs\r\nand asked to see me. The message startled me a little, after hearing\r\nfrom the old lady, in London, that her daughter-in-law was too great a\r\nsufferer to see anybody; but, of course, when I got her message, I had\r\nno choice but to go up stairs to the sick-room. I found her bedridden\r\nwith an incurable spinal complaint, and a really horrible object to look\r\nat, but with all her wits about her; and, if I am not greatly mistaken,\r\nas deceitful a woman, with as vile a temper, as you could find anywhere\r\nin all your long experience. Her excessive politeness, and her keeping\r\nher own face in the shade of the bed-curtains while she contrived to\r\nkeep mine in the light, put me on my guard the moment I entered the\r\nroom. We were more than half an hour together, without my stepping\r\ninto any one of the many clever little traps she laid for me. The only\r\nmystery in her behavior, which I failed to see through at the time, was\r\nher perpetually asking me to bring her things (things she evidently did\r\nnot want) from different parts of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince then events have enlightened me. My first suspicions were raised\r\nby overhearing some of the servants\xe2\x80\x99 gossip; and I have been confirmed\r\nin my opinion by the conduct of Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the few occasions when I have happened to be alone with the major,\r\nthe nurse has also happened to want something of her master, and has\r\ninvariably forgotten to announce her appearance by knocking, at the\r\ndoor. Do you understand now why Mrs. Milroy sent for me the moment I got\r\ninto the house, and what she wanted when she kept me going backward and\r\nforward, first for one thing and then for another? There is hardly an\r\nattractive light in which my face and figure can be seen, in which\r\nthat woman\xe2\x80\x99s jealous eyes have not studied them already. I am no longer\r\npuzzled to know why the father and daughter started, and looked at each\r\nother, when I was first presented to them; or why the servants still\r\nstare at me with a mischievous expectation in their eyes when I ring the\r\nbell and ask them to do anything. It is useless to disguise the truth,\r\nMother Oldershaw, between you and me. When I went upstairs into that\r\nsickroom, I marched blindfold into the clutches of a jealous woman. If\r\nMrs. Milroy _can_ turn me out of the house, Mrs. Milroy _will_; and,\r\nmorning and night, she has nothing else to do in that bed prison of hers\r\nbut to find out the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this awkward position, my own cautious conduct is admirably seconded\r\nby the dear old major\xe2\x80\x99s perfect insensibility. His wife\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy\r\nof him is as monstrous a delusion as any that could be found in\r\na mad-house; it is the growth of her own vile temper, under the\r\naggravation of an incurable illness. The poor man hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a thought\r\nbeyond his mechanical pursuits; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he knows at this\r\nmoment whether I am a handsome woman or not. With this chance to\r\nhelp me, I may hope to set the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s intrusions and the mistress\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontrivances at defiance--for a time, at any rate. But you know what a\r\njealous woman is, and I think I know what Mrs. Milroy is; and I own\r\nI shall breathe more freely on the day when young Armadale opens his\r\nfoolish lips to some purpose, and sets the major advertising for a new\r\ngoverness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s name reminds me of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s friend. There is more danger\r\nthreatening in that quarter; and, what is worse, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel half as\r\nwell armed beforehand against Mr. Midwinter as I do against Mrs. Milroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything about this man is more or less mysterious, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike, to begin with. How does he come to be in the confidence of the\r\nSomersetshire clergyman? How much has that clergyman told him? How is it\r\nthat he was so firmly persuaded, when he spoke to me in the park, that\r\nI was not the Miss Gwilt of whom his friend was in search? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nghost of an answer to give to any of those three questions. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven discover who he is, or how he and young Armadale first became\r\nacquainted. I hate him. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t; I only want to find out about him.\r\nHe is very young, little and lean, and active and dark, with bright\r\nblack eyes which say to me plainly, \xe2\x80\x98We belong to a man with brains in\r\nhis head and a will of his own; a man who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always been hanging\r\nabout a country house, in attendance on a fool.\xe2\x80\x99 Yes; I am positively\r\ncertain Mr. Midwinter has done something or suffered something in his\r\npast life, young as he is; and I would give I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to get at\r\nit. Don\xe2\x80\x99t resent my taking up so much space in my writing about him. He\r\nhas influence enough over young Armadale to be a very awkward obstacle\r\nin my way, unless I can secure his good opinion at starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you may ask, and what is to prevent your securing his good\r\nopinion? I am sadly afraid, Mother Oldershaw, I have got it on terms\r\nI never bargained for I am sadly afraid the man is in love with me\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t toss your head and say, \xe2\x80\x98Just like her vanity!\xe2\x80\x99 After the horrors\r\nI have gone through, I have no vanity left; and a man who admires me\r\nis a man who makes me shudder. There was a time, I own--Pooh! what am I\r\nwriting? Sentiment, I declare! Sentiment to _you_! Laugh away, my dear.\r\nAs for me, I neither laugh nor cry; I mend my pen, and get on with\r\nmy--what do the men call it?--my report.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing worth inquiring is, whether I am right or wrong in my\r\nidea of the impression I have made on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see; I have been four times in his company. The first time was\r\nin the major\xe2\x80\x99s garden, where we met unexpectedly, face to face. He stood\r\nlooking at me, like a man petrified, without speaking a word. The effect\r\nof my horrid red hair, perhaps? Quite likely; let us lay it on my hair.\r\nThe second time was in going over the Thorpe Ambrose grounds, with young\r\nArmadale on one side of me, and my pupil (in the sulks) on the other.\r\nOut comes Mr. Midwinter to join us, though he had work to do in the\r\nsteward\xe2\x80\x99s office, which he had never been known to neglect on any other\r\noccasion. Laziness, possibly? or an attachment to Miss Milroy? I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay; we will lay it on Miss Milroy, if you like; I only know he did\r\nnothing but look at _me_. The third time was at the private interview\r\nin the park, which I have told you of already. I never saw a man so\r\nagitated at putting a delicate question to a woman in my life. But\r\n_that_ might have been only awkwardness; and his perpetually looking\r\nback after me when we had parted might have been only looking back at\r\nthe view. Lay it on the view; by all means, lay it on the view! The\r\nfourth time was this very evening, at the little party. They made me\r\nplay; and, as the piano was a good one, I did my best. All the company\r\ncrowded round me, and paid me their compliments (my charming pupil\r\npaid hers, with a face like a cat\xe2\x80\x99s just before she spits), except Mr.\r\nMidwinter. _He_ waited till it was time to go, and then he caught me\r\nalone for a moment in the hall. There was just time for him to take my\r\nhand, and say two words. Shall I tell you _how_ he took my hand, and\r\nwhat his voice sounded like when he spoke? Quite needless! You have\r\nalways told me that the late Mr. Oldershaw doted on you. Just recall the\r\nfirst time he took your hand, and whispered a word or two addressed to\r\nyour private ear. To what did you attribute his behavior that occasion?\r\nI have no doubt, if you had been playing on the piano in the course of\r\nthe evening, you would have attributed it entirely to the music!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! you may take my word for it, the harm is done. _This_ man is no\r\nrattle-pated fool, who changes his fancies as readily as he changes his\r\nclothes. The fire that lights those big black eyes of his is not an easy\r\nfire, when a woman has once kindled it, for that woman to put out. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish to discourage you; I don\xe2\x80\x99t say the changes are against us.\r\nBut with Mrs. Milroy threatening me on one side, and Mr. Midwinter on\r\nthe other, the worst of all risks to run is the risk of losing time.\r\nYoung Armadale has hinted already, as well as such a lout can hint, at\r\na private interview! Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are sharp, and the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nare sharper; and I shall lose my place if either of them find me out. No\r\nmatter! I must take my chance, and give him the interview. Only let me\r\nget him alone, only let me escape the prying eyes of the women, and--if\r\nhis friend doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come between us--I answer for the result!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime, have I anything more to tell you? Are there any other\r\npeople in our way at Thorpe Ambrose? Not another creature! None of the\r\nresident families call here, young Armadale being, most fortunately, in\r\nbad odor in the neighborhood. There are no handsome highly-bred women to\r\ncome to the house, and no persons of consequence to protest against his\r\nattentions to a governess. The only guests he could collect at his\r\nparty to-night were the lawyer and his family (a wife, a son, and\r\ntwo daughters), and a deaf old woman and _her_ son--all perfectly\r\nunimportant people, and all obedient humble servants of the stupid young\r\nsquire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalking of obedient humble servants, there is one other person\r\nestablished here, who is employed in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office--a miserable,\r\nshabby, dilapidated old man, named Bashwood. He is a perfect stranger to\r\nme, and I am evidently a perfect stranger to him, for he has been asking\r\nthe house-maid at the cottage who I am. It is paying no great compliment\r\nto myself to confess it, but it is not the less true that I produced the\r\nmost extraordinary impression on this feeble old creature the first\r\ntime he saw me. He turned all manner of colors, and stood trembling and\r\nstaring at me, as if there was something perfectly frightful in my face.\r\nI felt quite startled for the moment, for, of all the ways in which men\r\nhave looked at me, no man ever looked at me in that way before. Did you\r\never see the boa constrictor fed at the Zoological Gardens? They put a\r\nlive rabbit into his cage, and there is a moment when the two creatures\r\nlook at each other. I declare Mr. Bashwood reminded me of the rabbit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do I mention this? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. Perhaps I have been writing\r\ntoo long, and my head is beginning to fail me. Perhaps Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner of admiring me strikes my fancy by its novelty. Absurd! I am\r\nexciting myself, and troubling you about nothing. Oh, what a weary, long\r\nletter I have written! and how brightly the stars look at me through the\r\nwindow, and how awfully quiet the night is! Send me some more of those\r\nsleeping drops, and write me one of your nice, wicked, amusing letters.\r\nYou shall hear from me again as soon as I know a little better how it is\r\nall likely to end. Good-night, and keep a corner in your stony old heart\r\nfor\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cL. G.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _From Mrs. Oldershaw to Miss Gwilt_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana Street, Pimlico, Monday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR LYDIA--I am in no state of mind to write you an amusing letter.\r\nYour news is very discouraging, and the recklessness of your tone quite\r\nalarms me. Consider the money I have already advanced, and the interests\r\nwe both have at stake. Whatever else you are, don\xe2\x80\x99t be reckless, for\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do? I ask myself, as a woman of business, what can I do to\r\nhelp you? I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you advice, for I am not on the spot, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how circumstances may alter from one day to another. Situated as we\r\nare now, I can only be useful in one way. I can discover a new obstacle\r\nthat threatens you, and I think I can remove it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say, with great truth, that there never was a prospect yet\r\nwithout an ugly place in it, and that there are two ugly places in your\r\nprospect. My dear, there may be _three_ ugly places, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t bestir\r\nmyself to prevent it; and the name of the third place will be--Brock!\r\nIs it possible you can refer, as you have done, to the Somersetshire\r\nclergyman, and not see that the progress you make with young Armadale\r\nwill be, sooner or later, reported to him by young Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s friend?\r\nWhy, now I think of it, you are doubly at the parson\xe2\x80\x99s mercy! You are\r\nat the mercy of any fresh suspicion which may bring him into the\r\nneighborhood himself at a day\xe2\x80\x99s notice; and you are at the mercy of his\r\ninterference the moment he hears that the squire is committing himself\r\nwith a neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s governess. If I can do nothing else, I can keep this\r\nadditional difficulty out of your way. And oh, Lydia, with what alacrity\r\nI shall exert myself, after the manner in which the old wretch insulted\r\nme when I told him that pitiable story in the street! I declare I tingle\r\nwith pleasure at this new prospect of making a fool of Mr. Brock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is it to be done? Just as we have done it already, to be sure.\r\nHe has lost \xe2\x80\x98Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99 (otherwise my house-maid), hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Very\r\nwell. He shall find her again, wherever he is now, suddenly settled\r\nwithin easy reach of him. As long as _she_ stops in the place, _he_ will\r\nstop in it; and as we know he is not at Thorpe Ambrose, there you are\r\nfree of him! The old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions have given us a great deal\r\nof trouble so far. Let us turn them to some profitable account at last;\r\nlet us tie him, by his suspicions, to my house-maid\xe2\x80\x99s apron-string. Most\r\nrefreshing. Quite a moral retribution, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only help I need trouble you for is help you can easily give.\r\nFind out from Mr. Midwinter where the parson is now, and let me know\r\nby return of post. If he is in London, I will personally assist my\r\nhousemaid in the necessary mystification of him. If he is anywhere else,\r\nI will send her after him, accompanied by a person on whose discretion I\r\ncan implicitly rely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have the sleeping drops to-morrow. In the meantime, I say at\r\nthe end what I said at the beginning--no recklessness. Don\xe2\x80\x99t encourage\r\npoetical feelings by looking at the stars; and don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about the\r\nnight being awfully quiet. There are people (in observatories) paid to\r\nlook at the stars for you; leave it to them. And as for the night,\r\ndo what Providence intended you to do with the night when Providence\r\nprovided you with eyelids--go to sleep in it. Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARIA OLDERSHAW.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n4. _From the Reverend Decimus Brock to Ozias Midwinter_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBascombe Rectory, West Somerset, Thursday, July 8.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MIDWINTER--One line before the post goes out, to relieve you of\r\nall sense of responsibility at Thorpe Ambrose, and to make my apologies\r\nto the lady who lives as governess in Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_The_ Miss Gwilt--or perhaps I ought to say, the woman calling herself\r\nby that name--has, to my unspeakable astonishment, openly made\r\nher appearance here, in my own parish! She is staying at the inn,\r\naccompanied by a plausible-looking man, who passes as her brother. What\r\nthis audacious proceeding really means--unless it marks a new step in\r\nthe conspiracy against Allan, taken under new advice--is, of course,\r\nmore than I can yet find out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own idea is, that they have recognized the impossibility of getting\r\nat Allan, without finding me (or you) as an obstacle in their way; and\r\nthat they are going to make a virtue of necessity by boldly trying\r\nto open their communications through me. The man looks capable of any\r\nstretch of audacity; and both he and the woman had the impudence to bow\r\nwhen I met them in the village half an hour since. They have been making\r\ninquiries already about Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mother here, where her exemplary life\r\nmay set their closest scrutiny at defiance. If they will only attempt to\r\nextort money, as the price of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s silence on the subject of poor\r\nMrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in Madeira at the time of her marriage, they\r\nwill find me well prepared for them beforehand. I have written by this\r\npost to my lawyers to send a competent man to assist me, and he will\r\nstay at the rectory, in any character which he thinks it safest to\r\nassume under present circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear what happens in the next day or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways truly yours, DECIMUS BROCK.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. THE CLOUDING OF THE SKY.\r\n\r\nNine days had passed, and the tenth day was nearly at an end, since Miss\r\nGwilt and her pupil had taken their morning walk in the cottage garden.\r\n\r\nThe night was overcast. Since sunset, there had been signs in the sky\r\nfrom which the popular forecast had predicted rain. The reception-rooms\r\nat the great house were all empty and dark. Allan was away, passing\r\nthe evening with the Milroys; and Midwinter was waiting his return--not\r\nwhere Midwinter usually waited, among the books in the library, but in\r\nthe little back room which Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mother had inhabited in the last days\r\nof her residence at Thorpe Ambrose.\r\n\r\nNothing had been taken away, but much had been added to the room, since\r\nMidwinter had first seen it. The books which Mrs. Armadale had left\r\nbehind her, the furniture, the old matting on the floor, the old paper\r\non the walls, were all undisturbed. The statuette of Niobe still stood\r\non its bracket, and the French window still opened on the garden.\r\nBut now, to the relics left by the mother, were added the personal\r\npossessions belonging to the son. The wall, bare hitherto, was decorated\r\nwith water-color drawings--with a portrait of Mrs. Armadale supported\r\non one side by a view of the old house in Somersetshire, and on the\r\nother by a picture of the yacht. Among the books which bore in faded\r\nink Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s inscriptions, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom my father,\xe2\x80\x9d were other books\r\ninscribed in the same handwriting, in brighter ink, \xe2\x80\x9cTo my son.\xe2\x80\x9d Hanging\r\nto the wall, ranged on the chimney-piece, scattered over the table, were\r\na host of little objects, some associated with Allan\xe2\x80\x99s past life,\r\nothers necessary to his daily pleasures and pursuits, and all plainly\r\ntestifying that the room which he habitually occupied at Thorpe Ambrose\r\nwas the very room which had once recalled to Midwinter the second vision\r\nof the dream. Here, strangely unmoved by the scene around him, so lately\r\nthe object of his superstitious distrust, Allan\xe2\x80\x99s friend now waited\r\ncomposedly for Allan\xe2\x80\x99s return; and here, more strangely still, he looked\r\non a change in the household arrangements, due in the first instance\r\nentirely to himself. His own lips had revealed the discovery which he\r\nhad made on the first morning in the new house; his own voluntary act\r\nhad induced the son to establish himself in the mother\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nUnder what motives had he spoken the words? Under no motives which were\r\nnot the natural growth of the new interests and the new hopes that now\r\nanimated him.\r\n\r\nThe entire change wrought in his convictions by the memorable event that\r\nhad brought him face to face with Miss Gwilt was a change which it was\r\nnot in his nature to hide from Allan\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge. He had spoken openly,\r\nand had spoken as it was in his character to speak. The merit of\r\nconquering his superstition was a merit which he shrank from claiming,\r\nuntil he had first unsparingly exposed that superstition in its worst\r\nand weakest aspects to view.\r\n\r\nIt was only after he had unreservedly acknowledged the impulse under\r\nwhich he had left Allan at the Mere, that he had taken credit to himself\r\nfor the new point of view from which he could now look at the Dream.\r\nThen, and not till then, he had spoken of the fulfillment of the first\r\nVision as the doctor at the Isle of Man might have spoken of it. He had\r\nasked, as the doctor might have asked, Where was the wonder of their\r\nseeing a pool at sunset, when they had a whole network of pools within\r\na few hours\xe2\x80\x99 drive of them? and what was there extraordinary in\r\ndiscovering a woman at the Mere, when there were roads that led to it,\r\nand villages in its neighborhood, and boats employed on it, and pleasure\r\nparties visiting it? So again, he had waited to vindicate the firmer\r\nresolution with which he looked to the future, until he had first\r\nrevealed all that he now saw himself of the errors of the past.\r\nThe abandonment of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s interests, the unworthiness of the\r\nconfidence that had given him the steward\xe2\x80\x99s place, the forgetfulness of\r\nthe trust that Mr. Brock had reposed in him all implied in the one idea\r\nof leaving Allan--were all pointed out. The glaring self-contradictions\r\nbetrayed in accepting the Dream as the revelation of a fatality, and\r\nin attempting to escape that fatality by an exertion of free-will--in\r\ntoiling to store up knowledge of the steward\xe2\x80\x99s duties for the\r\nfuture, and in shrinking from letting the future find him in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse--were, in their turn, unsparingly exposed. To every error, to\r\nevery inconsistency, he resolutely confessed, before he ventured on the\r\nlast simple appeal which closed all, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you trust me in the future?\r\nWill you forgive and forget the past?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA man who could thus open his whole heart, without one lurking reserve\r\ninspired by consideration for himself, was not a man to forget any minor\r\nact of concealment of which his weakness might have led him to be guilty\r\ntoward his friend. It lay heavy on Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s conscience that he had\r\nkept secret from Allan a discovery which he ought in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s dearest\r\ninterests to have revealed--the discovery of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nBut one doubt still closed his lips--the doubt whether Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct in Madeira had been kept secret on her return to England.\r\n\r\nCareful inquiry, first among the servants, then among the tenantry,\r\ncareful consideration of the few reports current at the time, as\r\nrepeated to him by the few persons left who remembered them, convinced\r\nhim at last that the family secret had been successfully kept within the\r\nfamily limits. Once satisfied that whatever inquiries the son might\r\nmake would lead to no disclosure which could shake his respect for his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s memory, Midwinter had hesitated no longer. He had taken Allan\r\ninto the room, and had shown him the books on the shelves, and all that\r\nthe writing in the books disclosed. He had said plainly, \xe2\x80\x9cMy one motive\r\nfor not telling you this before sprang from my dread of interesting you\r\nin the room which I looked at with horror as the second of the scenes\r\npointed at in the Dream. Forgive me this also, and you will have\r\nforgiven me all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith Allan\xe2\x80\x99s love for his mother\xe2\x80\x99s memory, but one result could follow\r\nsuch an avowal as this. He had liked the little room from the first,\r\nas a pleasant contrast to the oppressive grandeur of the other rooms at\r\nThorpe Ambrose, and, now that he knew what associations were connected\r\nwith it, his resolution was at once taken to make it especially his own.\r\nThe same day, all his personal possessions were collected and arranged\r\nin his mother\xe2\x80\x99s room--in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s presence, and with Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassistance given to the work.\r\n\r\nUnder those circumstances had the change now wrought in the household\r\narrangements been produced; and in this way had Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s victory over\r\nhis own fatalism--by making Allan the daily occupant of a room which\r\nhe might otherwise hardly ever have entered--actually favored the\r\nfulfillment of the Second Vision of the Dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hour wore on quietly as Allan\xe2\x80\x99s friend sat waiting for Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn. Sometimes reading, sometimes thinking placidly, he whiled away\r\nthe time. No vexing cares, no boding doubts, troubled him now. The\r\nrent-day, which he had once dreaded, had come and gone harmlessly. A\r\nfriendlier understanding had been established between Allan and his\r\ntenants; Mr. Bashwood had proved himself to be worthy of the confidence\r\nreposed in him; the Pedgifts, father and son, had amply justified their\r\nclient\xe2\x80\x99s good opinion of them. Wherever Midwinter looked, the prospect\r\nwas bright, the future was without a cloud.\r\n\r\nHe trimmed the lamp on the table beside him and looked out at the night.\r\nThe stable clock was chiming the half-hour past eleven as he walked to\r\nthe window, and the first rain-drops were beginning to fall. He had his\r\nhand on the bell to summon the servant, and send him over to the cottage\r\nwith an umbrella, when he was stopped by hearing the familiar footstep\r\non the walk outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow late you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, as Allan entered through the open\r\nFrench window. \xe2\x80\x9cWas there a party at the cottage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! only ourselves. The time slipped away somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d He answered in\r\nlower tones than usual, and sighed as he took his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be out of spirits?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI may as well tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a moment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be ashamed of; I only wonder you haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed it\r\nbefore! There\xe2\x80\x99s a woman in it, as usual--I\xe2\x80\x99m in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cHas Miss Milroy been more charming to-night than\r\never?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, gayly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Milroy!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking of! I\xe2\x80\x99m not in\r\nlove with Miss Milroy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it! What a question to ask! Who can it be but Miss Gwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden silence. Allan sat listlessly, with his hands in his\r\npockets, looking out through the open window at the falling rain. If\r\nhe had turned toward his friend when he mentioned Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s name he\r\nmight possibly have been a little startled by the change he would have\r\nseen in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after waiting a little.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too late to make objections,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI really mean it\r\nwhen I tell you I\xe2\x80\x99m in love with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fortnight since you were in love with Miss Milroy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other,\r\nin quiet, measured tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! a mere flirtation. It\xe2\x80\x99s different this time. I\xe2\x80\x99m in earnest about\r\nMiss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked round as he spoke. Midwinter turned his face aside on the\r\ninstant, and bent it over a book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Allan went on. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you object to\r\nher being only a governess? You can\xe2\x80\x99t do that, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. If you were\r\nin my place, her being only a governess wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand in the way with\r\n_you_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t honestly say it would stand in the way\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave the answer reluctantly, and pushed his chair back out\r\nof the light of the lamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA governess is a lady who is not rich,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, in an oracular\r\nmanner; \xe2\x80\x9cand a duchess is a lady who is not poor. And that\xe2\x80\x99s all the\r\ndifference I acknowledge between them. Miss Gwilt is older than I am--I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t deny that. What age do you guess her at, Midwinter? I say, seven\r\nor eight and twenty. What do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I agree with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think seven or eight and twenty is too old for me? If you were\r\nin love with a woman yourself, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think seven or eight and\r\ntwenty too old--would you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I should think it too old, if--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were really fond of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more there was no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cif there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in her being only a\r\ngoverness, and no harm in her being a little older than I am, what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nobjection to Miss Gwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made no objection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say you have. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to like the notion of it, for\r\nall that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. Midwinter was the first to break the silence\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of yourself, Allan?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with his face bent once\r\nmore over the book. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you really attached to this lady? Have you\r\nthought seriously already of asking her to be your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking seriously of it at this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nhappy--I can\xe2\x80\x99t live without her. Upon my soul, I worship the very ground\r\nshe treads on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long--\xe2\x80\x9d His voice faltered, and he stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreiterated, \xe2\x80\x9chave you worshipped the very ground she treads on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLonger than you think for. I know I can trust you with all my\r\nsecrets--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trust me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! I _will_ trust you. There is a little difficulty in the way\r\nwhich I haven\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned yet. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of some delicacy, and I\r\nwant to consult you about it. Between ourselves, I have had private\r\nopportunities with Miss Gwilt--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter suddenly started to his feet, and opened the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll talk of this to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan looked round in astonishment. The door was closed again, and he\r\nwas alone in the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has never shaken hands with me!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Allan, looking bewildered\r\nat the empty chair.\r\n\r\nAs the words passed his lips the door opened, and Midwinter appeared\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t shaken hands,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, Allan!\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll talk of it to-morrow. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan stood alone at the window, looking out at the pouring rain. He\r\nfelt ill at ease, without knowing why. \xe2\x80\x9cMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s ways get stranger\r\nand stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can he mean by putting me off till\r\nto-morrow, when I wanted to speak to him to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d He took up his\r\nbedroom candle a little impatiently, put it down again, and, walking\r\nback to the open window, stood looking out in the direction of the\r\ncottage. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if she\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself softly.\r\n\r\nShe _was_ thinking of him. She had just opened her desk to write to Mrs.\r\nOldershaw; and her pen had that moment traced the opening line: \xe2\x80\x9cMake\r\nyour mind easy. I have got him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. EXIT.\r\n\r\nIt rained all through the night, and when the morning came it was\r\nraining still.\r\n\r\nContrary to his ordinary habit, Midwinter was waiting in the\r\nbreakfast-room when Allan entered it. He looked worn and weary, but his\r\nsmile was gentler and his manner more composed than usual. To Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsurprise he approached the subject of the previous night\xe2\x80\x99s conversation\r\nof his own accord as soon as the servant was out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you thought me very impatient and very abrupt with you last\r\nnight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will try to make amends for it this morning. I will\r\nhear everything you wish to say to me on the subject of Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly like to worry you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look as if you had had a\r\nbad night\xe2\x80\x99s rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not slept well for some time past,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Midwinter, quietly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething has been wrong with me. But I believe I have found out the\r\nway to put myself right again without troubling the doctors. Late in the\r\nmorning I shall have something to say to you about this. Let us get back\r\nfirst to what you were talking of last night. You were speaking of some\r\ndifficulty--\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated, and finished the sentence in a tone so low\r\nthat Allan failed to hear him. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it would be better,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif, instead of speaking to me, you spoke to Mr. Brock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather speak to _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me first, was I\r\nright or wrong last night in thinking you disapproved of my falling in\r\nlove with Miss Gwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s lean, nervous fingers began to crumble the bread in his\r\nplate. His eyes looked away from Allan for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have any objection,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to hear\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter suddenly looked up again, his cheeks turning ashy pale, and\r\nhis glittering black eyes fixed full on Allan\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes _she_ love _you_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t think me vain?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you yesterday I had\r\nhad private opportunities with her--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s eyes dropped again to the crumbs on his plate. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand,\xe2\x80\x9d he interposed, quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were wrong last night. I had\r\nno objections to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you congratulate me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan, a little uneasily. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a\r\nbeautiful woman! such a clever woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter held out his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI owe you more than mere congratulations,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn anything which is for your happiness I owe you help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He took Allan\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and wrung it hard. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\ngrowing paler and paler as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the matter with you? Your\r\nhand is as cold as ice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter smiled faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am always in extremes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cmy hand\r\nwas as hot as fire the first time you took it at the old west-country\r\ninn. Come to that difficulty which you have not come to yet. You are\r\nyoung, rich, your own master--and she loves you. What difficulty can\r\nthere be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know how to put it,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAs you\r\nsaid just now, I love her, and she loves me; and yet there is a sort of\r\nstrangeness between us. One talks a good deal about one\xe2\x80\x99s self when one\r\nis in love, at least I do. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told her all about myself and my mother,\r\nand how I came in for this place, and the rest of it. Well--though it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t strike me when we are together--it comes across me now and then,\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m away from her, that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say much on her side. In fact,\r\nI know no more about her than you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that you know nothing about Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s family and\r\nfriends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never asked her about them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said something of the sort the other day,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan: \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid, as usual, I said it in the wrong way. She looked--I can\xe2\x80\x99t quite\r\ntell you how; not exactly displeased, but--oh, what things words are!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d give the world, Midwinter, if I could only find the right word when\r\nI want it as well as you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Miss Gwilt say anything to you in the way of a reply?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I was coming to. She said, \xe2\x80\x98I shall have a melancholy\r\nstory to tell you one of these days, Mr. Armadale, about myself and my\r\nfamily; but you look so happy, and the circumstances are so distressing,\r\nthat I have hardly the heart to speak of it now.\xe2\x80\x99 Ah, _she_ can express\r\nherself--with the tears in her eyes, my dear fellow, with the tears\r\nin her eyes! Of course, I changed the subject directly. And now the\r\ndifficulty is how to get back to it, delicately, without making her cry\r\nagain. We _must_ get back to it, you know. Not on my account; I am quite\r\ncontent to marry her first and hear of her family misfortunes, poor\r\nthing, afterward. But I know Mr. Brock. If I can\xe2\x80\x99t satisfy him about her\r\nfamily when I write to tell him of this (which, of course, I must do),\r\nhe will be dead against the whole thing. I\xe2\x80\x99m my own master, of course,\r\nand I can do as I like about it. But dear old Brock was such a good\r\nfriend to my poor mother, and he has been such a good friend to me--you\r\nsee what I mean, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Allan; Mr. Brock has been your second father. Any\r\ndisagreement between you about such a serious matter as this would be\r\nthe saddest thing that could happen. You ought to satisfy him that Miss\r\nGwilt is (what I am sure Miss Gwilt will prove to be) worthy, in every\r\nway worthy--\xe2\x80\x9d His voice sank in spite of him, and he left the sentence\r\nunfinished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust my feeling in the matter!\xe2\x80\x9d Allan struck in, glibly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we can\r\ncome to what I particularly wanted to consult you about. If this was\r\nyour case, Midwinter, you would be able to say the right words to\r\nher--you would put it delicately, even though you were putting it quite\r\nin the dark. I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. I\xe2\x80\x99m a blundering sort of fellow; and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nhorribly afraid, if I can\xe2\x80\x99t get some hint at the truth to help me at\r\nstarting, of saying something to distress her. Family misfortunes are\r\nsuch tender subjects to touch on, especially with such a refined woman,\r\nsuch a tender-hearted woman, as Miss Gwilt. There may have been\r\nsome dreadful death in the family--some relation who has disgraced\r\nhimself--some infernal cruelty which has forced the poor thing out on\r\nthe world as a governess. Well, turning it over in my mind, it struck\r\nme that the major might be able to put me on the right tack. It is\r\nquite possible that he might have been informed of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s family\r\ncircumstances before he engaged her, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible, Allan, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust my feeling again! My notion is to speak to the major. If I could\r\nonly get the story from him first, I should know so much better how to\r\nspeak to Miss Gwilt about it afterward. You advise me to try the major,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause before Midwinter replied. When he did answer, it was a\r\nlittle reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know how to advise you, Allan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very\r\ndelicate matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you would try the major, if you were in my place,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nAllan, reverting to his inveterately personal way of putting the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I might,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, more and more unwillingly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if I\r\ndid speak to the major, I should be very careful, in your place, not to\r\nput myself in a false position. I should be very careful to let no one\r\nsuspect me of the meanness of prying into a woman\xe2\x80\x99s secrets behind her\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, Midwinter,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwho\r\ncould suspect me of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody, Allan, who really knows you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe major knows me. The major is the last man in the world to\r\nmisunderstand me. All I want him to do is to help me (if he can) to\r\nspeak about a delicate subject to Miss Gwilt, without hurting her\r\nfeelings. Can anything be simpler between two gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of replying, Midwinter, still speaking as constrainedly as ever,\r\nasked a question on his side. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to tell Major Milroy,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat your intentions really are toward Miss Gwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s manner altered. He hesitated, and looked confused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking of that,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand I mean to feel my way\r\nfirst, and then tell him or not afterward, as matters turn out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA proceeding so cautious as this was too strikingly inconsistent with\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s character not to surprise any one who knew him. Midwinter showed\r\nhis surprise plainly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget that foolish flirtation of mine with Miss Milroy,\xe2\x80\x9d Allan\r\nwent on, more and more confusedly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe major may have noticed it, and\r\nmay have thought I meant--well, what I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean. It might be rather\r\nawkward, mightn\xe2\x80\x99t it, to propose to his face for his governess instead\r\nof his daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited for a word of answer, but none came. Midwinter opened his lips\r\nto speak, and suddenly checked himself. Allan, uneasy at his silence,\r\ndoubly uneasy under certain recollections of the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter which\r\nthe conversation had called up, rose from the table and shortened the\r\ninterview a little impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! come!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t sit there looking unutterable things;\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t make mountains out of mole-hills. You have such an old, old head,\r\nMidwinter, on those young shoulders of yours! Let\xe2\x80\x99s have done with all\r\nthese _pros_ and _cons_. Do you mean to tell me in plain words that it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do to speak to the major?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t take the responsibility, Allan, of telling you that. To be\r\nplainer still, I can\xe2\x80\x99t feel confident of the soundness of any advice\r\nI may give you in--in our present position toward each other. All I am\r\nsure of is that I cannot possibly be wrong in entreating you to do two\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you speak to Major Milroy, pray remember the caution I have given\r\nyou! Pray think of what you say before you say it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll think, never fear! What next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore you take any serious step in this matter, write and tell Mr.\r\nBrock. Will you promise me to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart. Anything more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more. I have said my last words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan led the way to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cCome into my room,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngive you a cigar. The servants will be in here directly to clear away,\r\nand I want to go on talking about Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t wait for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll follow you in a minute or\r\ntwo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe remained seated until Allan had closed the door, then rose, and\r\ntook from a corner of the room, where it lay hidden behind one of the\r\ncurtains, a knapsack ready packed for traveling. As he stood at the\r\nwindow thinking, with the knapsack in his hand, a strangely old,\r\ncare-worn look stole over his face: he seemed to lose the last of his\r\nyouth in an instant.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the woman\xe2\x80\x99s quicker insight had discovered days since, the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nslower perception had only realized in the past night. The pang that had\r\nwrung him when he heard Allan\xe2\x80\x99s avowal had set the truth self-revealed\r\nbefore Midwinter for the first time. He had been conscious of looking at\r\nMiss Gwilt with new eyes and a new mind, on the next occasion when they\r\nmet after the memorable interview in Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s garden; but he had\r\nnever until now known the passion that she had roused in him for what\r\nit really was. Knowing it at last, feeling it consciously in full\r\npossession of him, he had the courage which no man with a happier\r\nexperience of life would have possessed--the courage to recall what\r\nAllan had confided to him, and to look resolutely at the future through\r\nhis own grateful remembrances of the past.\r\n\r\nSteadfastly, through the sleepless hours of the night, he had bent his\r\nmind to the conviction that he must conquer the passion which had taken\r\npossession of him, for Allan\xe2\x80\x99s sake; and that the one way to conquer\r\nit was--to go. No after-doubt as to the sacrifice had troubled him when\r\nmorning came; and no after-doubt troubled him now. The one question that\r\nkept him hesitating was the question of leaving Thorpe Ambrose. Though\r\nMr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s letter relieved him from all necessity of keeping watch in\r\nNorfolk for a woman who was known to be in Somersetshire; though the\r\nduties of the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office were duties which might be safely left\r\nin Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s tried and trustworthy hands--still, admitting these\r\nconsiderations, his mind was not easy at the thought of leaving Allan,\r\nat a time when a crisis was approaching in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nHe slung the knapsack loosely over his shoulder and put the question to\r\nhis conscience for the last time. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you trust yourself to see her,\r\nday by day as you must see her--can you trust yourself to hear him talk\r\nof her, hour by hour, as you must hear him--if you stay in this house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Again the answer came, as it had come all through the night. Again his\r\nheart warned him, in the very interests of the friendship that he held\r\nsacred, to go while the time was his own; to go before the woman who\r\nhad possessed herself of his love had possessed herself of his power of\r\nself-sacrifice and his sense of gratitude as well.\r\n\r\nHe looked round the room mechanically before he turned to leave it.\r\nEvery remembrance of the conversation that had just taken place between\r\nAllan and himself pointed to the same conclusion, and warned him, as his\r\nown conscience had warned him, to go.\r\n\r\nHad he honestly mentioned any one of the objections which he, or any\r\nman, must have seen to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s attachment? Had he--as his knowledge of\r\nhis friend\xe2\x80\x99s facile character bound him to do--warned Allan to distrust\r\nhis own hasty impulses, and to test himself by time and absence, before\r\nhe made sure that the happiness of his whole life was bound up in Miss\r\nGwilt? No. The bare doubt whether, in speaking of these things, he could\r\nfeel that he was speaking disinterestedly, had closed his lips, and\r\nwould close his lips for the future, till the time for speaking had gone\r\nby. Was the right man to restrain Allan the man who would have given the\r\nworld, if he had it, to stand in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s place? There was but one plain\r\ncourse of action that an honest man and a grateful man could follow in\r\nthe position in which he stood. Far removed from all chance of seeing\r\nher, and from all chance of hearing of her--alone with his own faithful\r\nrecollection of what he owed to his friend--he might hope to fight it\r\ndown, as he had fought down the tears in his childhood under his gypsy\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s stick; as he had fought down the misery of his lonely youth\r\ntime in the country bookseller\xe2\x80\x99s shop. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he\r\nturned wearily from the window, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore she comes to the house again. I\r\nmust go before another hour is over my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that resolution he left the room; and, in leaving it, took the\r\nirrevocable step from Present to Future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rain was still falling. The sullen sky, all round the horizon,\r\nstill lowered watery and dark, when Midwinter, equipped for traveling,\r\nappeared in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, pointing to the knapsack, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does _that_\r\nmean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing very extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt only means--good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Allan, starting to his feet in astonishment.\r\n\r\nMidwinter put him back gently into his chair, and drew a seat near to it\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you noticed that I looked ill this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you\r\nthat I had been thinking of a way to recover my health, and that I meant\r\nto speak to you about it later in the day. That latter time has come. I\r\nhave been out of sorts, as the phrase is, for some time past. You\r\nhave remarked it yourself, Allan, more than once; and, with your usual\r\nkindness, you have allowed it to excuse many things in my conduct which\r\nwould have been otherwise unpardonable, even in your friendly eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you are going\r\nout on a walking tour in this pouring rain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the rain,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rain and I are old\r\nfriends. You know something, Allan, of the life I led before you met\r\nwith me. From the time when I was a child, I have been used to hardship\r\nand exposure. Night and day, sometimes for months together, I never\r\nhad my head under a roof. For years and years, the life of a wild\r\nanimal--perhaps I ought to say, the life of a savage--was the life\r\nI led, while you were at home and happy. I have the leaven of the\r\nvagabond--the vagabond animal, or the vagabond man, I hardly know\r\nwhich--in me still. Does it distress you to hear me talk of myself in\r\nthis way? I won\xe2\x80\x99t distress you. I will only say that the comfort and the\r\nluxury of our life here are, at times, I think, a little too much for a\r\nman to whom comforts and luxuries come as strange things. I want nothing\r\nto put me right again but more air and exercise; fewer good breakfasts\r\nand dinners, my dear friend, than I get here. Let me go back to some\r\nof the hardships which this comfortable house is expressly made to shut\r\nout. Let me meet the wind and weather as I used to meet them when I was\r\na boy; let me feel weary again for a little while, without a carriage\r\nnear to pick me up; and hungry when the night falls, with miles of\r\nwalking between my supper and me. Give me a week or two away, Allan--up\r\nnorthward, on foot, to the Yorkshire moors--and I promise to return to\r\nThorpe Ambrose, better company for you and for your friends. I shall be\r\nback before you have time to miss me. Mr. Bashwood will take care of the\r\nbusiness in the office; it is only for a fortnight, and it is for my own\r\ngood--let me go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like your leaving me in this\r\nsudden manner. There\xe2\x80\x99s something so strange and dreary about it. Why not\r\ntry riding, if you want more exercise; all the horses in the stables are\r\nat your disposal. At all events, you can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly go to-day. Look at\r\nthe rain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter looked toward the window, and gently shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought nothing of the rain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I was a mere child,\r\ngetting my living with the dancing dogs--why should I think anything of\r\nit now? _My_ getting wet, and _your_ getting wet, Allan, are two very\r\ndifferent things. When I was a fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s boy in the Hebrides, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na dry thread on me for weeks together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re not in the Hebrides now,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Allan; \xe2\x80\x9cand I expect our\r\nfriends from the cottage to-morrow evening. You can\xe2\x80\x99t start till after\r\nto-morrow. Miss Gwilt is going to give us some more music, and you know\r\nyou like Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s playing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter turned aside to buckle the straps of his knapsack. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me\r\nanother chance of hearing Miss Gwilt when I come back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with\r\nhis head down, and his fingers busy at the straps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have one fault, my dear fellow, and it grows on you,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated\r\nAllan; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you have once taken a thing into our head, you\xe2\x80\x99re the most\r\nobstinate man alive. There\xe2\x80\x99s no persuading you to listen to reason. If\r\nyou _will_ go,\xe2\x80\x9d added Allan, suddenly rising, as Midwinter took up his\r\nhat and stick in silence, \xe2\x80\x9cI have half a mind to go with you, and try a\r\nlittle roughing it too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo with _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Midwinter, with a momentary bitterness in his\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9cand leave Miss Gwilt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan sat down again, and admitted the force of the objection in\r\nsignificant silence. Without a word more on his side, Midwinter held\r\nout his hand to take leave. They were both deeply moved, and each was\r\nanxious to hide his agitation from the other. Allan took the last\r\nrefuge which his friend\xe2\x80\x99s firmness left to him: he tried to lighten the\r\nfarewell moment by a joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI begin to doubt if you\xe2\x80\x99re quite cured\r\nyet of your belief in the Dream. I suspect you\xe2\x80\x99re running away from me,\r\nafter all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter looked at him, uncertain whether he was in jest or earnest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you took me in here the\r\nother day, and made a clean breast of it? What did you say about this\r\nroom, and the second vision of the dream? By Jupiter!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed,\r\nstarting to his feet once more, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I look again, here _is_ the Second\r\nVision! There\xe2\x80\x99s the rain pattering against the window--there\xe2\x80\x99s the lawn\r\nand the garden outside--here am I where I stood in the Dream--and there\r\nare you where the Shadow stood. The whole scene complete, out-of-doors\r\nand in; and _I\xe2\x80\x99ve_ discovered it this time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA moment\xe2\x80\x99s life stirred again in the dead remains of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuperstition. His color changed, and he eagerly, almost fiercely,\r\ndisputed Allan\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the little marble figure on the bracket, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nscene is _not_ complete--you have forgotten something, as usual. The\r\nDream is wrong this time, thank God--utterly wrong! In the vision\r\nyou saw, the statue was lying in fragments on the floor, and you were\r\nstooping over them with a troubled and an angry mind. There stands the\r\nstatue safe and sound! and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t the vestige of an angry feeling\r\nin your mind, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d He seized Allan impulsively by the hand. At\r\nthe same moment the consciousness came to him that he was speaking and\r\nacting as earnestly as if he still believed in the Dream. The color\r\nrushed back over his face, and he turned away in confused silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, laughing, a little uneasily. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nnight on the Wreck is hanging on your mind as heavily as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing hangs heavy on me,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Midwinter, with a sudden outburst\r\nof impatience, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the knapsack on my back, and the time I\xe2\x80\x99m wasting\r\nhere. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out, and see if it\xe2\x80\x99s likely to clear up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come back?\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Allan.\r\n\r\nMidwinter opened the French window, and stepped out into the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, answering with all his former gentleness of manner;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come back in a fortnight. Good-by, Allan; and good luck with Miss\r\nGwilt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pushed the window to, and was away across the garden before his\r\nfriend could open it again and follow him.\r\n\r\nAllan rose, and took one step into the garden; then checked himself at\r\nthe window, and returned to his chair. He knew Midwinter well enough to\r\nfeel the total uselessness of attempting to follow him or to call him\r\nback. He was gone, and for two weeks to come there was no hope of seeing\r\nhim again. An hour or more passed, the rain still fell, and the\r\nsky still threatened. A heavier and heavier sense of loneliness and\r\ndespondency--the sense of all others which his previous life had least\r\nfitted him to understand and endure--possessed itself of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\nIn sheer horror of his own uninhabitably solitary house, he rang for his\r\nhat and umbrella, and resolved to take refuge in the major\xe2\x80\x99s cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have gone a little way with him,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Allan, his mind still\r\nrunning on Midwinter as he put on his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to have seen\r\nthe dear old fellow fairly started on his journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took his umbrella. If he had noticed the face of the servant who gave\r\nit to him, he might possibly have asked some questions, and might have\r\nheard some news to interest him in his present frame of mind. As it was,\r\nhe went out without looking at the man, and without suspecting that his\r\nservants knew more of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s last moments at Thorpe Ambrose than he\r\nknew himself. Not ten minutes since, the grocer and butcher had called\r\nin to receive payment of their bills, and the grocer and the butcher had\r\nseen how Midwinter started on his journey.\r\n\r\nThe grocer had met him first, not far from the house, stopping on his\r\nway, in the pouring rain, to speak to a little ragged imp of a boy, the\r\npest of the neighborhood. The boy\xe2\x80\x99s customary impudence had broken out\r\neven more unrestrainedly than usual at the sight of the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknapsack. And what had the gentleman done in return? He had stopped\r\nand looked distressed, and had put his two hands gently on the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders. The grocer\xe2\x80\x99s own eyes had seen that; and the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nears had heard him say, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little chap! I know how the wind gnaws and\r\nthe rain wets through a ragged jacket, better than most people who have\r\ngot a good coat on their backs.\xe2\x80\x9d And with those words he had put his\r\nhand in his pocket, and had rewarded the boy\xe2\x80\x99s impudence with a present\r\nof a shilling. \xe2\x80\x9cWrong here-abouts,\xe2\x80\x9d said the grocer, touching his\r\nforehead. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe butcher had seen him further on in the journey, at the other end of\r\nthe town. He had stopped--again in the pouring rain--and this time to\r\nlook at nothing more remarkable than a half-starved cur, shivering on\r\na doorstep. \xe2\x80\x9cI had my eye on him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the butcher; \xe2\x80\x9cand what do you\r\nthink he did? He crossed the road over to my shop, and bought a bit of\r\nmeat fit for a Christian. Very well. He says good-morning, and crosses\r\nback again; and, on the word of a man, down he goes on his knees on\r\nthe wet doorstep, and out he takes his knife, and cuts up the meat, and\r\ngives it to the dog. Meat, I tell you again, fit for a Christian! I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot a hard man, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the butcher, addressing the cook, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nmeat\xe2\x80\x99s meat; and it will serve your master\xe2\x80\x99s friend right if he lives to\r\nwant it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those old unforgotten sympathies of the old unforgotten time to\r\nkeep him company on his lonely road, he had left the town behind him,\r\nand had been lost to view in the misty rain. The grocer and the butcher\r\nhad seen the last of him, and had judged a great nature, as all natures\r\n_are_ judged from the grocer and the butcher point of view.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE SECOND BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MRS. MILROY.\r\n\r\nTwo days after Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s departure from Thorpe Ambrose, Mrs. Milroy,\r\nhaving completed her morning toilet, and having dismissed her nurse,\r\nrang the bell again five minutes afterward, and on the woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nre-appearance asked impatiently if the post had come in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPost?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you got your watch? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know\r\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s a good half-hour too soon to ask for your letters?\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke\r\nwith the confident insolence of a servant long accustomed to presume on\r\nher mistress\xe2\x80\x99s weakness and her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s necessities. Mrs. Milroy, on\r\nher side, appeared to be well used to her nurses manner; she gave her\r\norders composedly, without noticing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the postman does come,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9csee him yourself. I am\r\nexpecting a letter which I ought to have had two days since. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand it. I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to suspect the servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse smiled contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom will you suspect next?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cThere! don\xe2\x80\x99t put yourself out. I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer the gate-bell this\r\nmorning; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can\xe2\x80\x99t bring you a letter when the postman\r\ncomes.\xe2\x80\x9d Saying those words, with the tone and manner of a woman who is\r\nquieting a fractious child, the nurse, without waiting to be dismissed,\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy turned slowly and wearily on her bed, when she was left by\r\nherself again, and let the light from the window fall on her face. It\r\nwas the face of a woman who had once been handsome, and who was still,\r\nso far as years went, in the prime of her life. Long-continued suffering\r\nof body and long-continued irritation of mind had worn her away--in the\r\nroughly expressive popular phrase--to skin and bone. The utter wreck of\r\nher beauty was made a wreck horrible to behold, by her desperate efforts\r\nto conceal the sight of it from her own eyes, from the eyes of her\r\nhusband and her child, from the eyes even of the doctor who attended\r\nher, and whose business it was to penetrate to the truth. Her head, from\r\nwhich the greater part of the hair had fallen off; would have been less\r\nshocking to see than the hideously youthful wig by which she tried to\r\nhide the loss. No deterioration of her complexion, no wrinkling of her\r\nskin, could have been so dreadful to look at as the rouge that lay\r\nthick on her cheeks, and the white enamel plastered on her forehead. The\r\ndelicate lace, and the bright trimming on her dressing-gown, the ribbons\r\nin her cap, and the rings on her bony fingers, all intended to draw the\r\neye away from the change that had passed over her, directed the eye to\r\nit, on the contrary; emphasized it; made it by sheer force of contrast\r\nmore hopeless and more horrible than it really was. An illustrated book\r\nof the fashions, in which women were represented exhibiting their finery\r\nby means of the free use of their limbs, lay on the bed, from which she\r\nhad not moved for years without being lifted by her nurse. A hand-glass\r\nwas placed with the book so that she could reach it easily. She took up\r\nthe glass after her attendant had left the room, and looked at her face\r\nwith an unblushing interest and attention which she would have been\r\nashamed of herself at the age of eighteen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOlder and older, and thinner and thinner!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe major will\r\nsoon be a free man; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have that red-haired hussy out of the house\r\nfirst!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dropped the looking-glass on the counterpane, and clinched the hand\r\nthat held it. Her eyes suddenly riveted themselves on a little crayon\r\nportrait of her husband hanging on the opposite wall; they looked at\r\nthe likeness with the hard and cruel brightness of the eyes of a bird\r\nof prey. \xe2\x80\x9cRed is your taste in your old age is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the\r\nportrait. \xe2\x80\x9cRed hair, and a scrofulous complexion, and a padded figure,\r\na ballet-girl\xe2\x80\x99s walk, and a pickpocket\xe2\x80\x99s light fingers. _Miss_ Gwilt!\r\n_Miss_, with those eyes, and that walk!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned her head suddenly\r\non the pillow, and burst into a harsh, jeering laugh. \xe2\x80\x9c_Miss_!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nrepeated over and over again, with the venomously pointed emphasis of\r\nthe most merciless of all human forms of contempt--the contempt of one\r\nwoman for another.\r\n\r\nThe age we live in is an age which finds no human creature inexcusable.\r\nIs there an excuse for Mrs. Milroy? Let the story of her life answer the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nShe had married the major at an unusually early age; and, in marrying\r\nhim, had taken a man for her husband who was old enough to be her\r\nfather--a man who, at that time, had the reputation, and not unjustly,\r\nof having made the freest use of his social gifts and his advantages of\r\npersonal appearance in the society of women. Indifferently educated, and\r\nbelow her husband in station, she had begun by accepting his addresses\r\nunder the influence of her own flattered vanity, and had ended by\r\nfeeling the fascination which Major Milroy had exercised over women\r\ninfinitely her mental superiors in his earlier life. He had been\r\ntouched, on his side, by her devotion, and had felt, in his turn, the\r\nattraction of her beauty, her freshness, and her youth. Up to the time\r\nwhen their little daughter and only child had reached the age of eight\r\nyears, their married life had been an unusually happy one. At that\r\nperiod the double misfortune fell on the household, of the failure of\r\nthe wife\xe2\x80\x99s health, and the almost total loss of the husband\xe2\x80\x99s fortune;\r\nand from that moment the domestic happiness of the married pair was\r\nvirtually at an end.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the age when men in general are readier, under the\r\npressure of calamity, to resign themselves than to resist, the major had\r\nsecured the little relics of his property, had retired into the country,\r\nand had patiently taken refuge in his mechanical pursuits. A woman\r\nnearer to him in age, or a woman with a better training and more\r\npatience of disposition than his wife possessed, would have understood\r\nthe major\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, and have found consolation in the major\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsubmission. Mrs. Milroy found consolation in nothing. Neither nature\r\nnor training helped her to meet resignedly the cruel calamity which had\r\nstruck at her in the bloom of womanhood and the prime of beauty. The\r\ncurse of incurable sickness blighted her at once and for life.\r\n\r\nSuffering can, and does, develop the latent evil that there is in\r\nhumanity, as well as the latent good. The good that was in Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnature shrank up, under that subtly deteriorating influence in which the\r\nevil grew and flourished. Month by month, as she became the weaker\r\nwoman physically, she became the worse woman morally. All that was mean,\r\ncruel, and false in her expanded in steady proportion to the contraction\r\nof all that had once been generous, gentle, and true. Old suspicions\r\nof her husband\xe2\x80\x99s readiness to relapse into the irregularities of his\r\nbachelor life, which, in her healthier days of mind and body, she had\r\nopenly confessed to him--which she had always sooner or later seen to\r\nbe suspicions that he had not deserved--came back, now that sickness had\r\ndivorced her from him, in the form of that baser conjugal distrust which\r\nkeeps itself cunningly secret; which gathers together its inflammatory\r\nparticles atom by atom into a heap, and sets the slowly burning frenzy\r\nof jealousy alight in the mind. No proof of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s blameless\r\nand patient life that could now be shown to Mrs. Milroy; no appeal that\r\ncould be made to her respect for herself, or for her child growing up\r\nto womanhood, availed to dissipate the terrible delusion born of her\r\nhopeless illness, and growing steadily with its growth. Like all other\r\nmadness, it had its ebb and flow, its time of spasmodic outburst, and\r\nits time of deceitful repose; but, active or passive, it was always in\r\nher. It had injured innocent servants, and insulted blameless strangers.\r\nIt had brought the first tears of shame and sorrow into her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes, and had set the deepest lines that scored it in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface. It had made the secret misery of the little household for years;\r\nand it was now to pass beyond the family limits, and to influence coming\r\nevents at Thorpe Ambrose, in which the future interests of Allan and\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s friend were vitally concerned.\r\n\r\nA moment\xe2\x80\x99s glance at the posture of domestic affairs in the cottage,\r\nprior to the engagement of the new governess, is necessary to the due\r\nappreciation of the serious consequences that followed Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance on the scene.\r\n\r\nOn the marriage of the governess who had lived in his service for many\r\nyears (a woman of an age and an appearance to set even Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njealousy at defiance), the major had considered the question of sending\r\nhis daughter away from home far more seriously than his wife supposed.\r\nHe was conscious that scenes took place in the house at which no young\r\ngirl should be present; but he felt an invincible reluctance to apply\r\nthe one efficient remedy--the keeping his daughter away from home in\r\nschool time and holiday time alike. The struggle thus raised in his mind\r\nonce set at rest, by the resolution to advertise for a new governess,\r\nMajor Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s natural tendency to avoid trouble rather than to meet\r\nit had declared itself in its customary manner. He had closed his eyes\r\nagain on his home anxieties as quietly as usual, and had gone back, as\r\nhe had gone back on hundreds of previous occasions, to the consoling\r\nsociety of his old friend the clock.\r\n\r\nIt was far otherwise with the major\xe2\x80\x99s wife. The chance which her husband\r\nhad entirely overlooked, that the new governess who was to come might\r\nbe a younger and a more attractive woman than the old governess who had\r\ngone, was the first chance that presented itself as possible to Mrs.\r\nMilroy\xe2\x80\x99s mind. She had said nothing. Secretly waiting, and secretly\r\nnursing her inveterate distrust, she had encouraged her husband and her\r\ndaughter to leave her on the occasion of the picnic, with the express\r\npurpose of making an opportunity for seeing the new governess alone. The\r\ngoverness had shown herself; and the smoldering fire of Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njealousy had burst into flame in the moment when she and the handsome\r\nstranger first set eyes on each other.\r\n\r\nThe interview over, Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions fastened at once and\r\nimmovably on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\r\n\r\nShe was well aware that there was no one else in London on whom the\r\nmajor could depend to make the necessary inquiries; she was well aware\r\nthat Miss Gwilt had applied for the situation, in the first instance,\r\nas a stranger answering an advertisement published in a newspaper. Yet\r\nknowing this, she had obstinately closed her eyes, with the blind frenzy\r\nof the blindest of all the passions, to the facts straight before her;\r\nand, looking back to the last of many quarrels between them which\r\nhad ended in separating the elder lady and herself, had seized on the\r\nconclusion that Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s engagement was due to her mother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvindictive enjoyment of making mischief in her household. The inference\r\nwhich the very servants themselves, witnesses of the family scandal, had\r\ncorrectly drawn--that the major\xe2\x80\x99s mother, in securing the services of\r\na well-recommended governess for her son, had thought it no part of her\r\nduty to consider that governess\xe2\x80\x99s looks in the purely fanciful interests\r\nof the major\xe2\x80\x99s wife--was an inference which it was simply impossible\r\nto convey into Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Miss Gwilt had barely closed the\r\nsick-room door when the whispered words hissed out of Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips, \xe2\x80\x9cBefore another week is over your head, my lady, you go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, through the wakeful night and the weary day, the one\r\nobject of the bedridden woman\xe2\x80\x99s life was to procure the new governess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndismissal from the house.\r\n\r\nThe assistance of the nurse, in the capacity of spy, was secured--as\r\nMrs. Milroy had been accustomed to secure other extra services which her\r\nattendant was not bound to render her--by a present of a dress from the\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe. One after another articles of wearing apparel which\r\nwere now useless to Mrs. Milroy had ministered in this way to feed the\r\nnurse\xe2\x80\x99s greed--the insatiable greed of an ugly woman for fine clothes.\r\nBribed with the smartest dress she had secured yet, the household spy\r\ntook her secret orders, and applied herself with a vile enjoyment of it\r\nto her secret work.\r\n\r\nThe days passed, the work went on; but nothing had come of it. Mistress\r\nand servant had a woman to deal with who was a match for both of them.\r\n\r\nRepeated intrusions on the major, when the governess happened to be in\r\nthe same room with him, failed to discover the slightest impropriety of\r\nword, look, or action, on either side. Stealthy watching and listening\r\nat the governess\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom door detected that she kept a light in her\r\nroom at late hours of the night, and that she groaned and ground her\r\nteeth in her sleep--and detected nothing more. Careful superintendence\r\nin the day-time proved that she regularly posted her own letters,\r\ninstead of giving them to the servant; and that on certain occasions,\r\nwhen the occupation of her hours out of lesson time and walking time was\r\nleft at her own disposal, she had been suddenly missed from the garden,\r\nand then caught coming back alone to it from the park. Once and once\r\nonly, the nurse had found an opportunity of following her out of the\r\ngarden, had been detected immediately in the park, and had been asked\r\nwith the most exasperating politeness if she wished to join Miss Gwilt\r\nin a walk. Small circumstances of this kind, which were sufficiently\r\nsuspicious to the mind of a jealous woman, were discovered in abundance.\r\nBut circumstances, on which to found a valid ground of complaint that\r\nmight be laid before the major, proved to be utterly wanting. Day\r\nfollowed day, and Miss Gwilt remained persistently correct in her\r\nconduct, and persistently irreproachable in her relations toward her\r\nemployer and her pupil.\r\n\r\nFoiled in this direction, Mrs. Milroy tried next to find an assailable\r\nplace in the statement which the governess\xe2\x80\x99s reference had made on the\r\nsubject of the governess\xe2\x80\x99s character.\r\n\r\nObtaining from the major the minutely careful report which his mother\r\nhad addressed to him on this topic, Mrs. Milroy read and reread it, and\r\nfailed to find the weak point of which she was in search in any part\r\nof the letter. All the customary questions on such occasions had been\r\nasked, and all had been scrupulously and plainly answered. The one sole\r\nopening for an attack which it was possible to discover was an opening\r\nwhich showed itself, after more practical matters had been all disposed\r\nof, in the closing sentences of the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so struck,\xe2\x80\x9d the passage ran, \xe2\x80\x9cby the grace and distinction of\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s manners that I took an opportunity, when she was out of the\r\nroom, of asking how she first came to be governess. \xe2\x80\x98In the usual way,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI was told. \xe2\x80\x98A sad family misfortune, in which she behaved nobly. She\r\nis a very sensitive person, and shrinks from speaking of it among\r\nstrangers--a natural reluctance which I have always felt it a matter of\r\ndelicacy to respect.\xe2\x80\x99 Hearing this, of course, I felt the same delicacy\r\non my side. It was no part of my duty to intrude on the poor thing\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprivate sorrows; my only business was to do what I have now done, to\r\nmake sure that I was engaging a capable and respectable governess to\r\ninstruct my grandchild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration of these lines, Mrs. Milroy, having a\r\nstrong desire to find circumstances suspicious, found them suspicious\r\naccordingly. She determined to sift the mystery of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s family\r\nmisfortunes to the bottom, on the chance of extracting from it something\r\nuseful to her purpose. There were two ways of doing this. She might\r\nbegin by questioning the governess herself, or she might begin by\r\nquestioning the governess\xe2\x80\x99s reference. Experience of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquickness of resource in dealing with awkward questions at their\r\nintroductory interview decided her on taking the latter course. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget the particulars from the reference first,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mrs. Milroy, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthen question the creature herself, and see if the two stories agree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter of inquiry was short, and scrupulously to the point.\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy began by informing her correspondent that the state of her\r\nhealth necessitated leaving her daughter entirely under the governess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence and control. On that account she was more anxious than most\r\nmothers to be thoroughly informed in every respect about the person to\r\nwhom she confided the entire charge of an only child; and feeling this\r\nanxiety, she might perhaps be excused for putting what might be thought,\r\nafter the excellent character Miss Gwilt had received, a somewhat\r\nunnecessary question. With that preface, Mrs. Milroy came to the point,\r\nand requested to be informed of the circumstances which had obliged Miss\r\nGwilt to go out as a governess.\r\n\r\nThe letter, expressed in these terms, was posted the same day. On the\r\nmorning when the answer was due, no answer appeared. The next morning\r\narrived, and still there was no reply. When the third morning came, Mrs.\r\nMilroy\xe2\x80\x99s impatience had broken loose from all restraint. She had rung\r\nfor the nurse in the manner which has been already recorded, and had\r\nordered the woman to be in waiting to receive the letters of the morning\r\nwith her own hands. In this position matters now stood; and in these\r\ndomestic circumstances the new series of events at Thorpe Ambrose took\r\ntheir rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy had just looked at her watch, and had just put her hand once\r\nmore to the bell-pull, when the door opened and the nurse entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the postman come?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Milroy.\r\n\r\nThe nurse laid a letter on the bed without answering, and waited, with\r\nunconcealed curiosity, to watch the effect which it produced on her\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy tore open the envelope the instant it was in her hand. A\r\nprinted paper appeared (which she threw aside), surrounding a letter\r\n(which she looked at) in her own handwriting! She snatched up the\r\nprinted paper. It was the customary Post-office circular, informing her\r\nthat her letter had been duly presented at the right address, and that\r\nthe person whom she had written to was not to be found.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the nurse, detecting a change in her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe question passed unheeded. Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s writing-desk was on the\r\ntable at the bedside. She took from it the letter which the major\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother had written to her son, and turned to the page containing\r\nthe name and address of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s reference. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Mandeville, 18\r\nKingsdown Crescent, Bayswater,\xe2\x80\x9d she read, eagerly to herself, and then\r\nlooked at the address on her own returned letter. No error had been\r\ncommitted: the directions were identically the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated the nurse, advancing a step nearer to the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God--yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Milroy, with a sudden outburst of\r\nexultation. She tossed the Post-office circular to the nurse, and beat\r\nher bony hands on the bedclothes in an ecstasy of anticipated triumph.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s an impostor! Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s an impostor! If I die for it,\r\nRachel, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be carried to the window to see the police take her away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to say she\xe2\x80\x99s an impostor behind her back, and another\r\nthing to prove it to her face,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the nurse. She put her hand\r\nas she spoke into her apron pocket, and, with a significant look at her\r\nmistress, silently produced a second letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Milroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse; \xe2\x80\x9cfor Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two women eyed each other, and understood each other without another\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Milroy.\r\n\r\nThe nurse pointed in the direction of the park. \xe2\x80\x9cOut again, for another\r\nwalk before breakfast--by herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy beckoned to the nurse to stoop close over her. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you open\r\nit, Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\nRachel nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you close it again, so that nobody would know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you spare the scarf that matches your pearl gray dress?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nRachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Milroy, impatiently.\r\n\r\nThe nurse opened the wardrobe in silence, took the scarf in silence, and\r\nleft the room in silence. In less than five minutes she came back with\r\nthe envelope of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s letter open in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, for the scarf,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, putting the open letter\r\ncomposedly on the counterpane of the bed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy looked at the envelope. It had been closed as usual by means\r\nof adhesive gum, which had been made to give way by the application of\r\nsteam. As Mrs. Milroy took out the letter, her hand trembled violently,\r\nand the white enamel parted into cracks over the wrinkles on her\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nRachel withdrew to the window to keep watch on the park. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo signs of her yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy still paused, keeping the all-important morsel of paper\r\nfolded in her hand. She could have taken Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s life, but she\r\nhesitated at reading Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you troubled with scruples?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the nurse, with a sneer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider it a duty you owe to your daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Milroy. With that expression of opinion, she\r\nopened the letter.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently written in great haste, was undated, and was signed in\r\ninitials only. Thus it ran:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana Street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR LYDIA--The cab is waiting at the door, and I have only a moment\r\nto tell you that I am obliged to leave London, on business, for three\r\nor four days, or a week at longest. My letters will be forwarded if\r\nyou write. I got yours yesterday, and I agree with you that it is very\r\nimportant to put him off the awkward subject of yourself and your family\r\nas long as you safely can. The better you know him, the better you will\r\nbe able to make up the sort of story that will do. Once told, you will\r\nhave to stick to it; and, _having_ to stick to it, beware of making\r\nit complicated, and beware of making it in a hurry. I will write again\r\nabout this, and give you my own ideas. In the meantime, don\xe2\x80\x99t risk\r\nmeeting him too often in the park.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours, M. O.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the nurse, returning to the bedside. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you done with\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeeting him in the park!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Milroy, with her eyes still\r\nfastened on the letter. \xe2\x80\x9c_Him_! Rachel, where is the major?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn his own room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave your own way. I want the letter and the envelope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you close it again so that she won\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I can open I can shut. Anything more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy was left alone again, to review her plan of attack by the\r\nnew light that had now been thrown on Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\nThe information that had been gained by opening the governess\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\npointed plainly to the conclusion that an adventuress had stolen her way\r\ninto the house by means of a false reference. But having been obtained\r\nby an act of treachery which it was impossible to acknowledge, it was\r\nnot information that could be used either for warning the major or for\r\nexposing Miss Gwilt. The one available weapon in Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s hands was\r\nthe weapon furnished by her own returned letter, and the one question to\r\ndecide was how to make the best and speediest use of it.\r\n\r\nThe longer she turned the matter over in her mind, the more hasty and\r\npremature seemed the exultation which she had felt at the first sight of\r\nthe Post-office circular. That a lady acting as reference to a governess\r\nshould have quitted her residence without leaving any trace behind her,\r\nand without even mentioning an address to which her letters could be\r\nforwarded, was a circumstance in itself sufficiently suspicious to be\r\nmentioned to the major. But Mrs. Milroy, however perverted her estimate\r\nof her husband might be in some respects, knew enough of his character\r\nto be assured that, if she told him what had happened, he would frankly\r\nappeal to the governess herself for an explanation. Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquickness and cunning would, in that case, produce some plausible answer\r\non the spot, which the major\xe2\x80\x99s partiality would be only too ready to\r\naccept; and she would at the same time, no doubt, place matters\r\nin train, by means of the post, for the due arrival of all needful\r\nconfirmation on the part of her accomplice in London. To keep strict\r\nsilence for the present, and to institute (without the governess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowledge) such inquiries as might be necessary to the discovery of\r\nundeniable evidence, was plainly the only safe course to take with\r\nsuch a man as the major, and with such a woman as Miss Gwilt. Helpless\r\nherself, to whom could Mrs. Milroy commit the difficult and dangerous\r\ntask of investigation? The nurse, even if she was to be trusted, could\r\nnot be spared at a day\xe2\x80\x99s notice, and could not be sent away without\r\nthe risk of exciting remark. Was there any other competent and reliable\r\nperson to employ, either at Thorpe Ambrose or in London? Mrs. Milroy\r\nturned from side to side of the bed, searching every corner of her mind\r\nfor the needful discovery, and searching in vain. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if I could only\r\nlay my hand on some man I could trust!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, despairingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nonly knew where to look for somebody to help me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the idea passed through her mind, the sound of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nstartled her from the other side of the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neelie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs. Milroy, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have brought up your breakfast, mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy breakfast?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Milroy, in surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Rachel\r\nbring it up as usual?\xe2\x80\x9d She considered a moment, and then called out,\r\nsharply, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE MAN IS FOUND.\r\n\r\nNeelie entered the room, carrying the tray with the tea, the dry toast,\r\nand the pat of butter which composed the invalid\xe2\x80\x99s invariable breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Milroy, speaking and looking as she\r\nmight have spoken and looked if the wrong servant had come into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nNeelie put the tray down on the bedside table. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I should like\r\nto bring you up your breakfast, mamma, for once in a way,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I asked Rachel to let me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Milroy, \xe2\x80\x9cand wish me good-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeelie obeyed. As she stooped to kiss her mother, Mrs. Milroy caught her\r\nby the arm, and turned her roughly to the light. There were plain signs\r\nof disturbance and distress in her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s face. A deadly thrill of\r\nterror ran through Mrs. Milroy on the instant. She suspected that the\r\nopening of the letter had been discovered by Miss Gwilt, and that the\r\nnurse was keeping out of the way in consequence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie, shrinking under her mother\xe2\x80\x99s grasp.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hurt me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me why you have brought up my breakfast this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted\r\nMrs. Milroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you, mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not! You have made an excuse; I see it in your face. Come!\r\nwhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeelie\xe2\x80\x99s resolution gave way before her mother\xe2\x80\x99s. She looked aside\r\nuneasily at the things in the tray. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been vexed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with\r\nan effort; \xe2\x80\x9cand I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to stop in the breakfast-room. I wanted to\r\ncome up here, and to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVexed? Who has vexed you? What has happened? Has Miss Gwilt anything to\r\ndo with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeelie looked round again at her mother in sudden curiosity and alarm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou read my thoughts. I declare you frighten me. It\r\n_was_ Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Mrs. Milroy could say a word more on her side, the door opened\r\nand the nurse looked in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got what you want?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, as composedly as usual. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss,\r\nthere, insisted on taking your tray up this morning. Has she broken\r\nanything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the window. I want to speak to Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Milroy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s back was turned, she beckoned eagerly to the\r\nnurse. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she\r\nsuspects us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse turned away with her hard, sneering smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you it\r\nshould be done,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand it _has_ been done. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the ghost\r\nof a suspicion. I waited in the room; and I saw her take up the letter\r\nand open it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy drew a deep breath of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, loud\r\nenough for her daughter to hear. \xe2\x80\x9cI want nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse withdrew; and Neelie came back from the window. Mrs. Milroy\r\ntook her by the hand, and looked at her more attentively and more kindly\r\nthan usual. Her daughter interested her that morning; for her daughter\r\nhad something to say on the subject of Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to think that you promised to be pretty, child,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\ncautiously resuming the interrupted conversation in the least direct\r\nway. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be keeping your promise. You look out of\r\nhealth and out of spirits. What is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf there had been any sympathy between mother and child, Neelie might\r\nhave owned the truth. She might have said frankly: \xe2\x80\x9cI am looking ill,\r\nbecause my life is miserable to me. I am fond of Mr. Armadale, and Mr.\r\nArmadale was once fond of me. We had one little disagreement, only one,\r\nin which I was to blame. I wanted to tell him so at the time, and I have\r\nwanted to tell him so ever since; and Miss Gwilt stands between us and\r\nprevents me. She has made us like strangers; she has altered him, and\r\ntaken him away from me. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look at me as he did; he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspeak to me as he did; he is never alone with me as he used to be; I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t say the words to him that I long to say; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t write to him,\r\nfor it would look as if I wanted to get him back. It is all over between\r\nme and Mr. Armadale; and it is that woman\xe2\x80\x99s fault. There is ill-blood\r\nbetween Miss Gwilt and me the whole day long; and say what I may, and do\r\nwhat I may, she always gets the better of me, and always puts me in the\r\nwrong. Everything I saw at Thorpe Ambrose pleased me, everything I did\r\nat Thorpe Ambrose made me happy, before she came. Nothing pleases me,\r\nand nothing makes me happy now!\xe2\x80\x9d If Neelie had ever been accustomed to\r\nask her mother\xe2\x80\x99s advice and to trust herself to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s love, she\r\nmight have said such words as these. As it was, the tears came into her\r\neyes, and she hung her head in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Milroy, beginning to lose patience. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\nsomething to say to me about Miss Gwilt. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeelie forced back her tears, and made an effort to answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe aggravates me beyond endurance, mamma; I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear her; I shall do\r\nsomething--\xe2\x80\x9d Neelie stopped, and stamped her foot angrily on the floor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall throw something at her head if we go on much longer like this!\r\nI should have thrown something this morning if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t left the room.\r\nOh, do speak to papa about it! Do find out some reason for sending her\r\naway! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to school--I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything in the world to get rid of\r\nMiss Gwilt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo get rid of Miss Gwilt! At those words--at that echo from her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s lips of the one dominant desire kept secret in her own\r\nheart--Mrs. Milroy slowly raised herself in bed. What did it mean? Was\r\nthe help she wanted coming from the very last of all quarters in which\r\nshe could have thought of looking for it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want to get rid of Miss Gwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you\r\ngot to complain of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the aggravation of it. Miss Gwilt won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet me have anything to complain of. She is perfectly detestable; she\r\nis driving me mad; and she is the pink of propriety all the time. I dare\r\nsay it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care--I hate her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes questioned her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s face as they had\r\nnever questioned it yet. There was something under the surface,\r\nevidently--something which it might be of vital importance to her own\r\npurpose to discover--which had not risen into view. She went on probing\r\nher way deeper and deeper into Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s mind, with a warmer and warmer\r\ninterest in Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPour me out a cup of tea,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t excite yourself, my\r\ndear. Why do you speak to _me_ about this? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak to your\r\nfather?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have tried to speak to papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s no use; he\r\nis too good to know what a wretch she is. She is always on her best\r\nbehavior with him; she is always contriving to be useful to him. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t make him understand why I dislike Miss Gwilt; I can\xe2\x80\x99t make _you_\r\nunderstand--I only understand it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d She tried to pour out the\r\ntea, and in trying upset the cup. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go downstairs again!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nNeelie, with a burst of tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not fit for anything; I can\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\npour out a cup of tea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy seized her hand and stopped her. Trifling as it was,\r\nNeelie\xe2\x80\x99s reference to the relations between the major and Miss Gwilt had\r\nroused her mother\xe2\x80\x99s ready jealousy. The restraints which Mrs. Milroy\r\nhad laid on herself thus far vanished in a moment--vanished even in the\r\npresence of a girl of sixteen, and that girl her own child!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait here!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have come to the right place and\r\nthe right person. Go on abusing Miss Gwilt. I like to hear you--I hate\r\nher, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Neelie, looking at her mother in astonishment.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Mrs. Milroy hesitated before she said more. Some last-left\r\ninstinct of her married life in its earlier and happier time pleaded\r\nhard with her to respect the youth and the sex of her child. But\r\njealousy respects nothing; in the heaven above and on the earth beneath,\r\nnothing but itself. The slow fire of self-torment, burning night and day\r\nin the miserable woman\xe2\x80\x99s breast, flashed its deadly light into her eyes,\r\nas the next words dropped slowly and venomously from her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had had eyes in your head, you would never have gone to your\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour father has reasons of his own for hearing\r\nnothing that you can say, or that anybody can say, against Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMany girls at Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s age would have failed to see the meaning hidden\r\nunder those words. It was the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s misfortune, in this instance,\r\nto have had experience enough of the mother to understand her. Neelie\r\nstarted back from the bedside, with her face in a glow. \xe2\x80\x9cMamma!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are talking horribly! Papa is the best, and dearest, and\r\nkindest--oh, I won\xe2\x80\x99t hear it! I won\xe2\x80\x99t hear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s fierce temper broke out in an instant--broke out all the\r\nmore violently from her feeling herself, in spite of herself, to have\r\nbeen in the wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou impudent little fool!\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted, furiously. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I\r\nwant _you_ to remind me of what I owe to your father? Am I to learn how\r\nto speak of your father, and how to think of your father, and how to\r\nlove and honor your father, from a forward little minx like you! I was\r\nfinely disappointed, I can tell you, when you were born--I wished for\r\na boy, you impudent hussy! If you ever find a man who is fool enough to\r\nmarry you, he will be a lucky man if you only love him half as well,\r\na quarter as well, a hundred-thousandth part as well, as I loved your\r\nfather. Ah, you can cry when it\xe2\x80\x99s too late; you can come creeping back\r\nto beg your mother\xe2\x80\x99s pardon after you have insulted her. You little\r\ndowdy, half-grown creature! I was handsomer than ever you will be when\r\nI married your father. I would have gone through fire and water to serve\r\nyour father! If he had asked me to cut off one of my arms, I would have\r\ndone it--I would have done it to please him!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned suddenly with\r\nher face to the wall, forgetting her daughter, forgetting her husband,\r\nforgetting everything but the torturing remembrance of her lost beauty.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy arms!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated to herself, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat arms I had when I was\r\nyoung!\xe2\x80\x9d She snatched up the sleeve of her dressing-gown furtively, with\r\na shudder. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, look at it now! look at it now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeelie fell on her knees at the bedside and hid her face. In sheer\r\ndespair of finding comfort and help anywhere else, she had cast herself\r\nimpulsively on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s mercy; and this was how it had ended! \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nmamma,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to offend you! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it when you spoke so of my father. Oh, do, do forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy turned again on her pillow, and looked at her daughter\r\nvacantly. \xe2\x80\x9cForgive you?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, with her mind still in the past,\r\ngroping its way back darkly to the present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, mamma--I beg your pardon on my knees. I am so\r\nunhappy; I do so want a little kindness! Won\xe2\x80\x99t you forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Milroy. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after an\r\ninterval, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I know! Forgive you? Yes; I\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive you on one\r\ncondition.\xe2\x80\x9d She lifted Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s head, and looked her searchingly in the\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me why you hate Miss Gwilt! You\xe2\x80\x99ve a reason of your own for\r\nhating her, and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t confessed it yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeelie\xe2\x80\x99s head dropped again. The burning color that she was hiding by\r\nhiding her face showed itself on her neck. Her mother saw it, and gave\r\nher time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Mrs. Milroy, more gently, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you hate her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer came reluctantly, a word at a time, in fragments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she is trying--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrying what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrying to make somebody who is much--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch too young for her--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBreathlessly interested, Mrs. Milroy leaned forward, and twined her hand\r\ncaressingly in her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it, Neelie?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never say I told you, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! Who is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy leaned back on her pillow in dead silence. The plain\r\nbetrayal of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s first love, by her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s own lips, which\r\nwould have absorbed the whole attention of other mothers, failed to\r\noccupy her for a moment. Her jealousy, distorting all things to fit its\r\nown conclusions, was busied in distorting what she had just heard. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nblind,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich has deceived my girl. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deceive\r\n_me_. Is Miss Gwilt likely to succeed?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes Mr.\r\nArmadale show any sort of interest in her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeelie looked up at her mother for the first time. The hardest part\r\nof the confession was over now. She had revealed the truth about Miss\r\nGwilt, and she had openly mentioned Allan\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shows the most unaccountable interest,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible\r\nto understand it. It\xe2\x80\x99s downright infatuation. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t patience to talk\r\nabout it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do _you_ come to be in Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s secrets?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs.\r\nMilroy. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he informed _you_, of all the people in the world, of his\r\ninterest in Miss Gwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Neelie, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite bad enough that he\r\nshould have told papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the re-appearance of the major in the narrative, Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterest in the conversation rose to its climax. She raised herself\r\nagain from the pillow. \xe2\x80\x9cGet a chair,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down, child, and\r\ntell me all about it. Every word, mind--every word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only tell you, mamma, what papa told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaturday. I went in with papa\xe2\x80\x99s lunch to the workshop, and he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have just had a visit from Mr. Armadale; and I want to give you\r\na caution while I think of it.\xe2\x80\x99 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything, mamma; I only\r\nwaited. Papa went on, and told me that Mr. Armadale had been speaking to\r\nhim on the subject of Miss Gwilt, and that he had been asking a question\r\nabout her which nobody in his position had a right to ask. Papa said he\r\nhad been obliged, good-humoredly, to warn Mr. Armadale to be a little\r\nmore delicate, and a little more careful next time. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel much\r\ninterested, mamma; it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to _me_ what Mr. Armadale said or\r\ndid. Why should I care about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs. Milroy, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on with\r\nwhat your father said. What was he doing when he was talking about Miss\r\nGwilt? How did he look?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch as usual, mamma. He was walking up and down the workshop; and I\r\ntook his arm and walked up and down with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what _you_ were doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Milroy, more and more\r\nirritably. \xe2\x80\x9cDid your father tell you what Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s question was,\r\nor did he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mamma. He said Mr. Armadale began by mentioning that he was very\r\nmuch interested in Miss Gwilt, and he then went on to ask whether papa\r\ncould tell him anything about her family misfortunes--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Milroy. The word burst from her almost in a scream,\r\nand the white enamel on her face cracked in all directions. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nArmadale said _that_?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, leaning out further and further over\r\nthe side of the bed.\r\n\r\nNeelie started up, and tried to put her mother back on the pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9care you in pain? Are you ill? You frighten me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Milroy. She was too violently\r\nagitated to make any other than the commonest excuse. \xe2\x80\x9cMy nerves are bad\r\nthis morning; don\xe2\x80\x99t notice it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try the other side of the pillow.\r\nGo on! go on! I\xe2\x80\x99m listening, though I\xe2\x80\x99m not looking at you.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned\r\nher face to the wall, and clinched her trembling hands convulsively\r\nbeneath the bedclothes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got her!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered to herself, under\r\nher breath. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got her at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking too much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen stopping here too long. Shall I go downstairs, mamma, and come back\r\nlater in the day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Milroy, mechanically. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did your father say\r\nnext? Anything more about Mr. Armadale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more, except how papa answered him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neelie. \xe2\x80\x9cPapa\r\nrepeated his own words when he told me about it. He said, \xe2\x80\x98In the\r\nabsence of any confidence volunteered by the lady herself, Mr. Armadale,\r\nall I know or wish to know--and you must excuse me for saying, all\r\nany one else need know or wish to know--is that Miss Gwilt gave me a\r\nperfectly satisfactory reference before she entered my house.\xe2\x80\x99 Severe,\r\nmamma, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t pity him in the least; he richly deserved\r\nit. The next thing was papa\xe2\x80\x99s caution to _me_. He told me to check Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity if he applied to me next. As if he was likely to\r\napply to me! And as if I should listen to him if he did! That\xe2\x80\x99s all,\r\nmamma. You won\xe2\x80\x99t suppose, will you, that I have told you this because I\r\nwant to hinder Mr. Armadale from marrying Miss Gwilt? Let him marry her\r\nif he pleases; I don\xe2\x80\x99t care!\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie, in a voice that faltered\r\na little, and with a face which was hardly composed enough to be in\r\nperfect harmony with a declaration of indifference. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I want is to\r\nbe relieved from the misery of having Miss Gwilt for my governess. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nrather go to school. I should like to go to school. My mind\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\nchanged about all that, only I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the heart to tell papa. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what\xe2\x80\x99s come to me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have heart enough for anything\r\nnow; and when papa takes me on his knee in the evening, and says, \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhave a talk, Neelie,\xe2\x80\x99 he makes me cry. Would you mind breaking it to\r\nhim, mamma, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed my mind, and I want to go to school?\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ntears rose thickly in her eyes, and she failed to see that her mother\r\nnever even turned on the pillow to look round at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Milroy, vacantly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a good girl; you shall\r\ngo to school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cruel brevity of the reply, and the tone in which it was spoken,\r\ntold Neelie plainly that her mother\xe2\x80\x99s attention had been wandering\r\nfar away from her, and that it was useless and needless to prolong the\r\ninterview. She turned aside quietly, without a word of remonstrance.\r\nIt was nothing new in her experience to find herself shut out from her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s sympathies. She looked at her eyes in the glass, and, pouring\r\nout some cold water, bathed her face. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt shan\xe2\x80\x99t see I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ncrying!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Neelie, as she went back to the bedside to take her\r\nleave. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve tired you out, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go now;\r\nand let me come back a little later when you have had some rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated her mother, as mechanically as ever; \xe2\x80\x9ca little later\r\nwhen I have had some rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeelie left the room. The minute after the door had closed on her, Mrs.\r\nMilroy rang the bell for her nurse. In the face of the narrative she had\r\njust heard, in the face of every reasonable estimate of probabilities,\r\nshe held to her own jealous conclusions as firmly as ever. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale\r\nmay believe her, and my daughter may believe her,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the furious\r\nwoman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I know the major; and she can\xe2\x80\x99t deceive _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse came in. \xe2\x80\x9cProp me up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Milroy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd give me my desk.\r\nI want to write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re excited,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not fit to write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the desk,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Mrs. Milroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything more?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rachel, repeating her invariable formula as she\r\nplaced the desk on the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Come back in half an hour. I shall want you to take a letter to\r\nthe great house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse\xe2\x80\x99s sardonic composure deserted her for once. \xe2\x80\x9cMercy on us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she exclaimed, with an accent of genuine surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat next? You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to say you\xe2\x80\x99re going to write--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to write to Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs. Milroy; \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nare going to take the letter to him, and wait for an answer; and,\r\nmind this, not a living soul but our two selves must know of it in the\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you writing to Mr. Armadale?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why is nobody\r\nto know of it but our two selves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Milroy, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity, being a woman\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity, declined to wait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you with my eyes open,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I won\xe2\x80\x99t help you\r\nblindfold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if I only had the use of my limbs!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Mrs. Milroy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwretch, if I could only do without you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have the use of your head,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the impenetrable nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyou ought to know better than to trust me by halves, at this time of\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was brutally put; but it was true--doubly true, after the opening of\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Mrs. Milroy gave way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to know?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, and leave me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know what you are writing to Mr. Armadale about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has Mr. Armadale to do with you and Miss Gwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Milroy held up the letter that had been returned to her by the\r\nauthorities at the Post-office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStoop,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt may be listening at the door. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwhisper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse stooped, with her eye on the door. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that the postman\r\nwent with this letter to Kingsdown Crescent?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Milroy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\r\nknow that he found Mrs. Mandeville gone away, nobody could tell where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Rachel \xe2\x80\x9cwhat next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, next. When Mr. Armadale gets the letter that I am going to write\r\nto him, he will follow the same road as the postman; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what\r\nhappens when he knocks at Mrs. Mandeville\xe2\x80\x99s door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you get him to the door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell him to go to Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s reference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he sweet on Miss Gwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cI see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE BRINK OF DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the interview between Mrs. Milroy and her daughter at the\r\ncottage was a morning of serious reflection for the squire at the great\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nEven Allan\xe2\x80\x99s easy-tempered nature had not been proof against the\r\ndisturbing influences exercised on it by the events of the last three\r\ndays. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt departure had vexed him; and Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreception of his inquiries relating to Miss Gwilt weighed unpleasantly\r\non his mind. Since his visit to the cottage, he had felt impatient and\r\nill at ease, for the first time in his life, with everybody who came\r\nnear him. Impatient with Pedgift Junior, who had called on the previous\r\nevening to announce his departure for London, on business, the next day,\r\nand to place his services at the disposal of his client; ill at ease\r\nwith Miss Gwilt, at a secret meeting with her in the park that morning;\r\nand ill at ease in his own company, as he now sat moodily smoking in\r\nthe solitude of his room. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t live this sort of life much longer,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n thought Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cIf nobody will help me to put the awkward question to\r\nMiss Gwilt, I must stumble on some way of putting it for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat way? The answer to that question was as hard to find as ever. Allan\r\ntried to stimulate his sluggish invention by walking up and down the\r\nroom, and was disturbed by the appearance of the footman at the first\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then! what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter, sir; and the person waits for an answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan looked at the address. It was in a strange handwriting. He opened\r\nthe letter, and a little note inclosed in it dropped to the ground.\r\nThe note was directed, still in the strange handwriting, to \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nMandeville, 18 Kingsdown Crescent, Bayswater. Favored by Mr. Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n More and more surprised, Allan turned for information to the signature\r\nat the end of the letter. It was \xe2\x80\x9cAnne Milroy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Milroy?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be the major\xe2\x80\x99s wife. What can she\r\npossibly want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d By way of discovering what she wanted, Allan\r\ndid at last what he might more wisely have done at first. He sat down to\r\nread the letter.\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate.\xe2\x80\x9d] \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cottage, Monday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR--The name at the end of these lines will, I fear, recall to\r\nyou a very rude return made on my part, some time since, for an act of\r\nneighborly kindness on yours. I can only say in excuse that I am a\r\ngreat sufferer, and that, if I was ill-tempered enough, in a moment of\r\nirritation under severe pain, to send back your present of fruit, I have\r\nregretted doing so ever since. Attribute this letter, if you please, to\r\nmy desire to make some atonement, and to my wish to be of service to our\r\ngood friend and landlord, if I possibly can.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been informed of the question which you addressed to my husband,\r\nthe day before yesterday, on the subject of Miss Gwilt. From all I have\r\nheard of you, I am quite sure that your anxiety to know more of this\r\ncharming person than you know now is an anxiety proceeding from the most\r\nhonorable motives. Believing this, I feel a woman\xe2\x80\x99s interest--incurable\r\ninvalid as I am--in assisting you. If you are desirous of becoming\r\nacquainted with Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s family circumstances without directly\r\nappealing to Miss Gwilt herself, it rests with you to make the\r\ndiscovery; and I will tell you how.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt so happens that, some few days since, I wrote privately to Miss\r\nGwilt\xe2\x80\x99s reference on this very subject. I had long observed that my\r\ngoverness was singularly reluctant to speak of her family and her\r\nfriends; and, without attributing her silence to other than perfectly\r\nproper motives, I felt it my duty to my daughter to make some inquiry on\r\nthe subject. The answer that I have received is satisfactory as far as\r\nit goes. My correspondent informs me that Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s story is a very\r\nsad one, and that her own conduct throughout has been praiseworthy in\r\nthe extreme. The circumstances (of a domestic nature, as I gather) are\r\nall plainly stated in a collection of letters now in the possession of\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s reference. This lady is perfectly willing to let me see\r\nthe letters; but not possessing copies of them, and being personally\r\nresponsible for their security, she is reluctant, if it can be avoided,\r\nto trust them to the post; and she begs me to wait until she or I can\r\nfind some reliable person who can be employed to transmit the packet\r\nfrom her hands to mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder these circumstances, it has struck me that you might possibly,\r\nwith your interest in the matter, be not unwilling to take charge of the\r\npapers. If I am wrong in this idea, and if you are not disposed, after\r\nwhat I have told you, to go to the trouble and expense of a journey to\r\nLondon, you have only to burn my letter and inclosure, and to think no\r\nmore about it. If you decide on becoming my envoy, I gladly provide you\r\nwith the necessary introduction to Mrs. Mandeville. You have only, on\r\npresenting it, to receive the letters in a sealed packet, to send\r\nthem here on your return to Thorpe Ambrose, and to wait an early\r\ncommunication from me acquainting you with the result.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn conclusion, I have only to add that I see no impropriety in your\r\ntaking (if you feel so inclined) the course that I propose to you. Miss\r\nGwilt\xe2\x80\x99s manner of receiving such allusions as I have made to her family\r\ncircumstances has rendered it unpleasant for me (and would render it\r\nquite impossible for you) to seek information in the first instance from\r\nherself. I am certainly justified in applying to her reference; and you\r\nare certainly not to blame for being the medium of safely transmitting\r\na sealed communication with one lady to another. If I find in that\r\ncommunication family secrets which cannot honorably be mentioned to any\r\nthird person, I shall, of course, be obliged to keep you waiting until\r\nI have first appealed to Miss Gwilt. If I find nothing recorded but\r\nwhat is to her honor, and what is sure to raise her still higher in your\r\nestimation, I am undeniably doing her a service by taking you into my\r\nconfidence. This is how I look at the matter; but pray don\xe2\x80\x99t allow me to\r\ninfluence _you_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn any case, I have one condition to make, which I am sure you will\r\nunderstand to be indispensable. The most innocent actions are liable,\r\nin this wicked world, to the worst possible interpretation I must,\r\ntherefore, request that you will consider this communication as strictly\r\n_private_. I write to you in a confidence which is on no account (until\r\ncircumstances may, in my opinion, justify the revelation of it) to\r\nextend beyond our two selves,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, dear sir, truly yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cANNE MILROY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this tempting form the unscrupulous ingenuity of the major\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nhad set the trap. Without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, Allan followed his\r\nimpulses, as usual, and walked straight into it, writing his answer and\r\npursuing his own reflections simultaneously in a highly characteristic\r\nstate of mental confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jupiter, this is kind of Mrs. Milroy!\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear madam.\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cJust the\r\nthing I wanted, at the time when I needed it most!\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nto express my sense of your kindness, except by saying that I will go\r\nto London and fetch the letters with the greatest pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cShe shall\r\nhave a basket of fruit regularly every day, all through the season.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill go at once, dear madam, and be back to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cAh, nothing like\r\nthe women for helping one when one is in love! This is just what my poor\r\nmother would have done in Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s place.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word of honor\r\nas a gentleman, I will take the utmost care of the letters; and keep\r\nthe thing strictly private, as you request.\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cI would have given five\r\nhundred pounds to anybody who would have put me up to the right way\r\nto speak to Miss Gwilt; and here is this blessed woman does it\r\nfor nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, my dear madam, gratefully yours, Allan\r\nArmadale.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\nHaving sent his reply out to Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s messenger, Allan paused in a\r\nmomentary perplexity. He had an appointment with Miss Gwilt in the park\r\nfor the next morning. It was absolutely necessary to let her know that\r\nhe would be unable to keep it. She had forbidden him to write, and\r\nhe had no chance that day of seeing her alone. In this difficulty, he\r\ndetermined to let the necessary intimation reach her through the medium\r\nof a message to the major, announcing his departure for London on\r\nbusiness, and asking if he could be of service to any member of the\r\nfamily. Having thus removed the only obstacle to his freedom of action,\r\nAllan consulted the time-table, and found, to his disappointment, that\r\nthere was a good hour to spare before it would be necessary to drive to\r\nthe railway station. In his existing frame of mind he would infinitely\r\nhave preferred starting for London in a violent hurry.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came at last, Allan, on passing the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office,\r\ndrummed at the door, and called through it to Mr. Bashwood, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto town; back to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d There was no answer from within; and the\r\nservant, interposing, informed his master that Mr. Bashwood, having no\r\nbusiness to attend to that day, had locked up the office, and had left\r\nsome hours since.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the station, the first person whom Allan encountered was\r\nPedgift Junior, going to London on the legal business which he had\r\nmentioned on the previous evening at the great house. The necessary\r\nexplanations exchanged, and it was decided that the two should travel\r\nin the same carriage. Allan was glad to have a companion; and Pedgift,\r\nenchanted as usual to make himself useful to his client, bustled away\r\nto get the tickets and see to the luggage. Sauntering to and fro on the\r\nplatform, until his faithful follower returned, Allan came suddenly upon\r\nno less a person than Mr. Bashwood himself, standing back in a corner\r\nwith the guard of the train, and putting a letter (accompanied, to all\r\nappearance, by a fee) privately into the man\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, in his hearty way. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething important there,\r\nMr. Bashwood, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Bashwood had been caught in the act of committing murder, he\r\ncould hardly have shown greater alarm than he now testified at Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsudden discovery of him. Snatching off his dingy old hat, he bowed\r\nbare-headed, in a palsy of nervous trembling from head to foot. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nsir--no, sir; only a little letter, a little letter, a little letter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the deputy-steward, taking refuge in reiteration, and bowing\r\nhimself swiftly backward out of his employer\xe2\x80\x99s sight.\r\n\r\nAllan turned carelessly on his heel. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could take to that\r\nfellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t; he\xe2\x80\x99s such a sneak! What the deuce was\r\nthere to tremble about? Does he think I want to pry into his secrets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s secret on this occasion concerned Allan more nearly than\r\nAllan supposed. The letter which he had just placed in charge of\r\nthe guard was nothing less than a word of warning addressed to Mrs.\r\nOldershaw, and written by Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can hurry your business\xe2\x80\x9d (wrote the major\xe2\x80\x99s governess) \xe2\x80\x9cdo so,\r\nand come back to London immediately. Things are going wrong here, and\r\nMiss Milroy is at the bottom of the mischief. This morning she insisted\r\non taking up her mother\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast, always on other occasions taken up\r\nby the nurse. They had a long confabulation in private; and half an hour\r\nlater I saw the nurse slip out with a letter, and take the path that\r\nleads to the great house. The sending of the letter has been followed\r\nby young Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s sudden departure for London--in the face of an\r\nappointment which he had with me for to-morrow morning. This looks\r\nserious. The girl is evidently bold enough to make a fight of it for the\r\nposition of Mrs. Armadale of Thorpe Ambrose, and she has found out some\r\nway of getting her mother to help her. Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I am in the least\r\nnervous or discouraged, and don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything till you hear from me\r\nagain. Only get back to London, for I may have serious need of your\r\nassistance in the course of the next day or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI send this letter to town (to save a post) by the midday train, in\r\ncharge of the guard. As you insist on knowing every step I take at\r\nThorpe Ambrose, I may as well tell you that my messenger (for I can\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nto the station myself) is that curious old creature whom I mentioned\r\nto you in my first letter. Ever since that time he has been perpetually\r\nhanging about here for a look at me. I am not sure whether I frighten\r\nhim or fascinate him; perhaps I do both together. All you need care to\r\nknow is that I can trust him with my trifling errands, and possibly, as\r\ntime goes on, with something more. L. G.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the train had started from the Thorpe Ambrose station, and the\r\nsquire and his traveling companion were on their way to London.\r\n\r\nSome men, finding themselves in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s company under present\r\ncircumstances, might have felt curious to know the nature of his\r\nbusiness in the metropolis. Young Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s unerring instinct as a man\r\nof the world penetrated the secret without the slightest difficulty.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old story,\xe2\x80\x9d thought this wary old head, wagging privately on its\r\nlusty young shoulders, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a woman in the case, as usual. Any other\r\nbusiness would have been turned over to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Perfectly satisfied with\r\nthis conclusion, Mr. Pedgift the younger proceeded, with an eye to his\r\nprofessional interest, to make himself agreeable to his client in the\r\ncapacity of volunteer courier. He seized on the whole administrative\r\nbusiness of the journey to London, as he had seized on the whole\r\nadministrative business of the picnic at the Broads. On reaching the\r\nterminus, Allan was ready to go to any hotel that might be recommended.\r\nHis invaluable solicitor straight-way drove him to a hotel at which the\r\nPedgift family had been accustomed to put up for three generations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t object to vegetables, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the cheerful Pedgift, as\r\nthe cab stopped at a hotel in Covent Garden Market. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good; you may\r\nleave the rest to my grandfather, my father, and me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which\r\nof the three is most beloved and respected in this house. How d\xe2\x80\x99ye do,\r\nWilliam? (Our head-waiter, Mr. Armadale.) Is your wife\xe2\x80\x99s rheumatism\r\nbetter, and does the little boy get on nicely at school? Your master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nout, is he? Never mind, you\xe2\x80\x99ll do. This, William, is Mr. Armadale of\r\nThorpe Ambrose. I have prevailed on Mr. Armadale to try our house. Have\r\nyou got the bedroom I wrote for? Very good. Let Mr. Armadale have it\r\ninstead of me (my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s favorite bedroom, sir; No. 57, on the\r\nsecond floor); pray take it; I can sleep anywhere. Will you have the\r\nmattress on the top of the feather-bed? You hear, William? Tell Matilda,\r\nthe mattress on the top of the feather-bed. How is Matilda? Has she got\r\nthe toothache, as usual? The head-chambermaid, Mr. Armadale, and a most\r\nextraordinary woman; she will _not_ part with a hollow tooth in her\r\nlower jaw. My grandfather says, \xe2\x80\x98Have it out;\xe2\x80\x99 my father says, \xe2\x80\x98Have it\r\nout;\xe2\x80\x99 I say, \xe2\x80\x98Have it out;\xe2\x80\x99 and Matilda turns a deaf ear to all three of\r\nus. Yes, William, yes; if Mr. Armadale approves, this sitting-room will\r\ndo. About dinner, sir? Shall we say, in that case, half-past seven?\r\nWilliam, half-past seven. Not the least need to order anything, Mr.\r\nArmadale. The head-waiter has only to give my compliments to the cook,\r\nand the best dinner in London will be sent up, punctual to the minute,\r\nas a necessary consequence. Say, Mr. Pedgift Junior, if you please,\r\nWilliam; otherwise, sir, we might get my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s dinner or my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, and they _might_ turn out a little too heavy and\r\nold-fashioned in their way of feeding for you and me. As to the wine,\r\nWilliam. At dinner, _my_ Champagne, and the sherry that my father thinks\r\nnasty. After dinner, the claret with the blue seal--the wine my innocent\r\ngrandfather said wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth sixpence a bottle. Ha! ha! poor old boy!\r\nYou will send up the evening papers and the play-bills, just as usual,\r\nand--that will do? I think, William, for the present. An invaluable\r\nservant, Mr. Armadale; they\xe2\x80\x99re all invaluable servants in this house. We\r\nmay not be fashionable here, sir, but by the Lord Harry we are snug! A\r\ncab? you would like a cab? Don\xe2\x80\x99t stir! I\xe2\x80\x99ve rung the bell twice--that\r\nmeans, Cab wanted in a hurry. Might I ask, Mr. Armadale, which way your\r\nbusiness takes you? Toward Bayswater? Would you mind dropping me in the\r\npark? It\xe2\x80\x99s a habit of mine when I\xe2\x80\x99m in London to air myself among the\r\naristocracy. Yours truly, sir, has an eye for a fine woman and a fine\r\nhorse; and when he\xe2\x80\x99s in Hyde Park he\xe2\x80\x99s quite in his native element.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Thus the all-accomplished Pedgift ran on; and by these little arts did\r\nhe recommend himself to the good opinion of his client.\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner hour united the traveling companions again in their\r\nsitting-room at the hotel, a far less acute observer than young Pedgift\r\nmust have noticed the marked change that appeared in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s manner.\r\nHe looked vexed and puzzled, and sat drumming with his fingers on the\r\ndining-table without uttering a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid something has happened to annoy you, sir, since we parted\r\ncompany in the Park?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift Junior. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse the question; I only\r\nask it in case I can be of any use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething that I never expected has happened,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what to make of it. I should like to have your opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nafter a little hesitation; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is to say, if you will excuse my not\r\nentering into any particulars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly!\xe2\x80\x9d assented young Pedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cSketch it in outline, sir. The\r\nmerest hint will do; I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cOh, these women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n thought the youthful philosopher, in parenthesis.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d began Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know what I said when we got to this hotel; I\r\nsaid I had a place to go to in Bayswater\xe2\x80\x9d (Pedgift mentally checked off\r\nthe first point: Case in the suburbs, Bayswater); \xe2\x80\x9cand a person--that\r\nis to say--no--as I said before, a person to inquire after.\xe2\x80\x9d (Pedgift\r\nchecked off the next point: Person in the case. She-person, or\r\nhe-person? She-person, unquestionably!) \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I went to the house,\r\nand when I asked for her--I mean the person--she--that is to say, the\r\nperson--oh, confound it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall drive myself mad, and\r\nyou, too, if I try to tell my story in this roundabout way. Here it is\r\nin two words. I went to No. 18 Kingsdown Crescent, to see a lady named\r\nMandeville; and, when I asked for her, the servant said Mrs. Mandeville\r\nhad gone away, without telling anybody where, and without even leaving\r\nan address at which letters could be sent to her. There! it\xe2\x80\x99s out at\r\nlast. And what do you think of it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me first, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wary Pedgift, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat inquiries you made\r\nwhen you found this lady had vanished?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInquiries!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI was utterly staggered; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nanything. What inquiries ought I to have made?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Junior cleared his throat, and crossed his legs in a strictly\r\nprofessional manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no wish, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cto inquire into your business\r\nwith Mrs. Mandeville--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Allan, bluntly; \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t inquire into that. My\r\nbusiness with Mrs. Mandeville must remain a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Pedgift, laying down the law with the forefinger of one\r\nhand on the outstretched palm of the other, \xe2\x80\x9cI may, perhaps, be allowed\r\nto ask generally whether your business with Mrs. Mandeville is of a\r\nnature to interest you in tracing her from Kingsdown Crescent to her\r\npresent residence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a very particular reason for wishing to\r\nsee her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pedgift Junior, \xe2\x80\x9cthere were two obvious\r\nquestions which you ought to have asked, to begin with--namely, on what\r\ndate Mrs. Mandeville left, and how she left. Having discovered this, you\r\nshould have ascertained next under what domestic circumstances she\r\nwent away--whether there was a misunderstanding with anybody; say a\r\ndifficulty about money matters. Also, whether she went away alone, or\r\nwith somebody else. Also, whether the house was her own, or whether she\r\nonly lodged in it. Also, in the latter event--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop! stop! you\xe2\x80\x99re making my head swim,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand all these ins and outs. I\xe2\x80\x99m not used to this sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been used to it myself from my childhood upward, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\r\nPedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I can be of any assistance, say the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you could only help me to find\r\nMrs. Mandeville; and if you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind leaving the thing afterward\r\nentirely in my hands--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it in your hands, sir, with all the pleasure in life,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPedgift Junior. (\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay five to one,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, mentally, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nthe time comes, you\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it in mine!\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Bayswater\r\ntogether, Mr. Armadale, to-morrow morning. In the meantime here\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nsoup. The case now before the court is, Pleasure versus Business. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what you say, sir; I say, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation,\r\nVerdict for the plaintiff. Let us gather our rosebuds while we may.\r\nExcuse my high spirits, Mr. Armadale. Though buried in the country, I\r\nwas made for a London life; the very air of the metropolis intoxicates\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d With that avowal the irresistible Pedgift placed a chair for\r\nhis patron, and issued his orders cheerfully to his viceroy, the\r\nhead-waiter. \xe2\x80\x9cIced punch, William, after the soup. I answer for the\r\npunch, Mr. Armadale; it\xe2\x80\x99s made after a recipe of my great-uncle\xe2\x80\x99s. He\r\nkept a tavern, and founded the fortunes of the family. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\ntelling you the Pedgifts have had a publican among them; there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nfalse pride about me. \xe2\x80\x98Worth makes the man (as Pope says) and want of\r\nit the fellow; the rest is all but leather and prunella.\xe2\x80\x99 I cultivate\r\npoetry as well as music, sir, in my leisure hours; in fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m more or\r\nless on familiar terms with the whole of the nine Muses. Aha! here\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npunch! The memory of my great-uncle, the publican, Mr. Armadale--drunk\r\nin solemn silence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan tried hard to emulate his companion\xe2\x80\x99s gayety and good humor, but\r\nwith very indifferent success. His visit to Kingsdown Crescent recurred\r\nominously again and again to his memory all through the dinner, and all\r\nthrough the public amusements to which he and his legal adviser repaired\r\nat a later hour of the evening. When Pedgift Junior put out his candle\r\nthat night, he shook his wary head, and regretfully apostrophized \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x9d for the second time.\r\n\r\nBy ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning the indefatigable Pedgift was on\r\nthe scene of action. To Allan\xe2\x80\x99s great relief, he proposed making the\r\nnecessary inquiries at Kingsdown Crescent in his own person, while his\r\npatron waited near at hand, in the cab which had brought them from the\r\nhotel. After a delay of little more than five minutes, he reappeared, in\r\nfull possession of all attainable particulars. His first proceeding was\r\nto request Allan to step out of the cab, and to pay the driver. Next,\r\nhe politely offered his arm, and led the way round the corner of the\r\ncrescent, across a square, and into a by-street, which was rendered\r\nexceptionally lively by the presence of the local cab-stand. Here he\r\nstopped, and asked jocosely whether Mr. Armadale saw his way now,\r\nor whether it would be necessary to test his patience by making an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee my way?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Allan, in bewilderment. \xe2\x80\x9cI see nothing but a\r\ncab-stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Junior smiled compassionately, and entered on his explanation.\r\nIt was a lodging-house at Kingsdown Crescent, he begged to state to\r\nbegin with. He had insisted on seeing the landlady. A very nice person,\r\nwith all the remains of having been a fine girl about fifty years ago;\r\nquite in Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s style--if he had only been alive at the beginning of\r\nthe present century--quite in Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s style. But perhaps Mr. Armadale\r\nwould prefer hearing about Mrs. Mandeville? Unfortunately, there was\r\nnothing to tell. There had been no quarreling, and not a farthing\r\nleft unpaid: the lodger had gone, and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an explanatory\r\ncircumstance to lay hold of anywhere. It was either Mrs. Mandeville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nway to vanish, or there was something under the rose, quite\r\nundiscoverable so far. Pedgift had got the date on which she left, and\r\nthe time of day at which she left, and the means by which she left.\r\nThe means might help to trace her. She had gone away in a cab which the\r\nservant had fetched from the nearest stand. The stand was now before\r\ntheir eyes; and the waterman was the first person to apply to--going to\r\nthe waterman for information being clearly (if Mr. Armadale would excuse\r\nthe joke) going to the fountain-head. Treating the subject in this airy\r\nmanner, and telling Allan that he would be back in a moment,\r\nPedgift Junior sauntered down the street, and beckoned the waterman\r\nconfidentially into the nearest public-house.\r\n\r\nIn a little while the two re-appeared, the waterman taking Pedgift in\r\nsuccession to the first, third, fourth, and sixth of the cabmen whose\r\nvehicles were on the stand. The longest conference was held with the\r\nsixth man; and it ended in the sudden approach of the sixth cab to the\r\npart of the street where Allan was waiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet in, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift, opening the door; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve found the man. He\r\nremembers the lady; and, though he has forgotten the name of the street,\r\nhe believes he can find the place he drove her to when he once gets back\r\ninto the neighborhood. I am charmed to inform you, Mr. Armadale, that\r\nwe are in luck\xe2\x80\x99s way so far. I asked the waterman to show me the regular\r\nmen on the stand; and it turns out that one of the regular men drove\r\nMrs. Mandeville. The waterman vouches for him; he\xe2\x80\x99s quite an anomaly--a\r\nrespectable cabman; drives his own horse, and has never been in any\r\ntrouble. These are the sort of men, sir, who sustain one\xe2\x80\x99s belief\r\nin human nature. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a look at our friend, and I agree with the\r\nwaterman; I think we can depend on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe investigation required some exercise of patience at the outset. It\r\nwas not till the cab had traversed the distance between Bayswater and\r\nPimlico that the driver began to slacken his pace and look about him.\r\nAfter once or twice retracing its course, the vehicle entered a quiet\r\nby-street, ending in a dead wall, with a door in it; and stopped at the\r\nlast house on the left-hand side, the house next to the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, opening the cab door.\r\n\r\nAllan and Allan\xe2\x80\x99s adviser both got out, and both looked at the house,\r\nwith the same feeling of instinctive distrust.\r\n\r\nBuildings have their physiognomy--especially buildings in great\r\ncities--and the face of this house was essentially furtive in its\r\nexpression. The front windows were all shut, and the front blinds were\r\nall drawn down. It looked no larger than the other houses in the street,\r\nseen in front; but it ran back deceitfully and gained its greater\r\naccommodation by means of its greater depth. It affected to be a shop on\r\nthe ground-floor; but it exhibited absolutely nothing in the space that\r\nintervened between the window and an inner row of red curtains, which\r\nhid the interior entirely from view. At one side was the shop door,\r\nhaving more red curtains behind the glazed part of it, and bearing\r\na brass plate on the wooden part of it, inscribed with the name of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOldershaw.\xe2\x80\x9d On the other side was the private door, with a bell marked\r\nProfessional; and another brass plate, indicating a medical occupant on\r\nthis side of the house, for the name on it was, \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Downward.\xe2\x80\x9d If\r\never brick and mortar spoke yet, the brick and mortar here said plainly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have got our secrets inside, and we mean to keep them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis can\xe2\x80\x99t be the place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan; \xe2\x80\x9cthere must be some mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know best, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pedgift Junior, with his sardonic\r\ngravity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know Mrs. Mandeville\xe2\x80\x99s habits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be surprised to hear it; but Mrs.\r\nMandeville is a total stranger to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not in the least surprised to hear it, sir; the landlady at\r\nKingsdown Crescent informed me that Mrs. Mandeville was an old woman.\r\nSuppose we inquire?\xe2\x80\x9d added the impenetrable Pedgift, looking at the\r\nred curtains in the shop window with a strong suspicion that Mrs.\r\nMandeville\xe2\x80\x99s granddaughter might possibly be behind them.\r\n\r\nThey tried the shop door first. It was locked. They rang. A lean and\r\nyellow young woman, with a tattered French novel in her hand, opened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Mrs. Mandeville at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe yellow young woman stared at him in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo person of that\r\nname is known here,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, sharply, in a foreign accent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they know her at the private door?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Pedgift Junior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the yellow young woman, and shut the door in his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather a quick-tempered young person that, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncongratulate Mrs. Mandeville on not being acquainted with her.\xe2\x80\x9d He led\r\nthe way, as he spoke, to Doctor Downward\xe2\x80\x99s side of the premises, and\r\nrang the bell.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened this time by a man in a shabby livery. He, too,\r\nstared when Mrs. Mandeville\xe2\x80\x99s name was mentioned; and he, too, knew of\r\nno such person in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery odd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift, appealing to Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is odd?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a softly stepping, softly speaking gentleman in\r\nblack, suddenly appearing on the threshold of the parlor door.\r\n\r\nPedgift Junior politely explained the circumstances, and begged to know\r\nwhether he had the pleasure of speaking to Doctor Downward.\r\n\r\nThe doctor bowed. If the expression may be pardoned, he was one of those\r\ncarefully constructed physicians in whom the public--especially the\r\nfemale public--implicitly trust. He had the necessary bald head,\r\nthe necessary double eyeglass, the necessary black clothes, and the\r\nnecessary blandness of manner, all complete. His voice was soothing, his\r\nways were deliberate, his smile was confidential. What particular branch\r\nof his profession Doctor Downward followed was not indicated on his\r\ndoor-plate; but he had utterly mistaken his vocation if he was not a\r\nladies\xe2\x80\x99 medical man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure there is no mistake about the name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\ndoctor, with a strong underlying anxiety in his manner. \xe2\x80\x9cI have known\r\nvery serious inconvenience to arise sometimes from mistakes about names.\r\nNo? There is really no mistake? In that case, gentlemen, I can only\r\nrepeat what my servant has already told you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t apologize, pray.\r\nGood-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d The doctor withdrew as noiselessly as he had appeared;\r\nthe man in the shabby livery silently opened the door; and Allan and his\r\ncompanion found themselves in the street again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you feel; I feel\r\npuzzled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s awkward,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to ask you what we\r\nought to do next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the look of the place, the look of the shop-woman, or the\r\nlook of the doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the other. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I think\r\nthey are deceiving us; I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I think they really know Mrs.\r\nMandeville\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe impressions of Pedgift Junior seldom misled him; and they had not\r\nmisled him in this case. The caution which had dictated Mrs. Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprivate removal from Bayswater was the caution which frequently\r\noverreaches itself. It had warned her to trust nobody at Pimlico with\r\nthe secret of the name she had assumed as Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s reference; but\r\nit had entirely failed to prepare her for the emergency that had really\r\nhappened. In a word, Mrs. Oldershaw had provided for everything except\r\nfor the one unimaginable contingency of an after-inquiry into the\r\ncharacter of Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must do something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan; \xe2\x80\x9cit seems useless to stop here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody had ever yet caught Pedgift Junior at the end of his resources;\r\nand Allan failed to catch him at the end of them now. \xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree\r\nwith you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must do something. We\xe2\x80\x99ll cross-examine the\r\ncabman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cabman proved to be immovable. Charged with mistaking the place, he\r\npointed to the empty shop window. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you may have seen,\r\ngentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s the only shop window I ever saw\r\nwith nothing at all inside it. _That_ fixed the place in my mind at the\r\ntime, and I know it again when I see it.\xe2\x80\x9d Charged with mistaking the\r\nperson or the day, or the house at which he had taken the person up, the\r\ncabman proved to be still unassailable. The servant who fetched him\r\nwas marked as a girl well known on the stand. The day was marked as the\r\nunluckiest working-day he had had since the first of the year; and the\r\nlady was marked as having had her money ready at the right moment (which\r\nnot one elderly lady in a hundred usually had), and having paid him his\r\nfare on demand without disputing it (which not one elderly lady in a\r\nhundred usually did). \xe2\x80\x9cTake my number, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the cabman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand pay me for my time; and what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear to\r\nanywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift made a note in his pocket-book of the man\xe2\x80\x99s number. Having added\r\nto it the name of the street, and the names on the two brass plates, he\r\nquietly opened the cab door. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are quite in the dark, thus far,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we grope our way back to the hotel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke and looked more seriously than usual The mere fact of \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nMandeville\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d having changed her lodging without telling any one where\r\nshe was going, and without leaving any address at which letters could\r\nbe forwarded to her--which the jealous malignity of Mrs. Milroy had\r\ninterpreted as being undeniably suspicious in itself--had produced no\r\ngreat impression on the more impartial judgment of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s solicitor.\r\nPeople frequently left their lodgings in a private manner, with\r\nperfectly producible reasons for doing so. But the appearance of the\r\nplace to which the cabman persisted in declaring that he had driven\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Mandeville\xe2\x80\x9d set the character and proceedings of that mysterious\r\nlady before Pedgift Junior in a new light. His personal interest in the\r\ninquiry suddenly strengthened, and he began to feel a curiosity to know\r\nthe real nature of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s business which he had not felt yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur next move, Mr. Armadale, is not a very easy move to see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nas they drove back to the hotel. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think you could put me in\r\npossession of any further particulars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan hesitated; and Pedgift Junior saw that he had advanced a little\r\ntoo far. \xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t force it,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; \xe2\x80\x9cI must give it time, and let\r\nit come of its own accord.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIn the absence of any other information,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you say to my making some inquiry about that\r\nqueer shop, and about those two names on the door-plate? My business in\r\nLondon, when I leave you, is of a professional nature; and I am going\r\ninto the right quarter for getting information, if it is to be got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can\xe2\x80\x99t be any harm, I suppose, in making inquiries,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nAllan.\r\n\r\nHe, too, spoke more seriously than usual; he, too, was beginning to feel\r\nan all-mastering curiosity to know more. Some vague connection, not to\r\nbe distinctly realized or traced out, began to establish itself in\r\nhis mind between the difficulty of approaching Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s family\r\ncircumstances and the difficulty of approaching Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s reference.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get down and walk, and leave you to go on to your business,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to consider a little about this, and a walk and a cigar\r\nwill help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy business will be done, sir, between one and two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift, when\r\nthe cab had been stopped, and Allan had got out. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we meet again at\r\ntwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at the hotel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan nodded, and the cab drove off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. ALLAN AT BAY.\r\n\r\nTwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock came; and Pedgift Junior, punctual to his time, came with\r\nit. His vivacity of the morning had all sparkled out; he greeted Allan\r\nwith his customary politeness, but without his customary smile; and,\r\nwhen the headwaiter came in for orders, his dismissal was instantly\r\npronounced in words never yet heard to issue from the lips of Pedgift in\r\nthat hotel: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be in low spirits,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we get our\r\ninformation? Can nobody tell you anything about the house in Pimlico?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree different people have told me about it, Mr. Armadale, and they\r\nhave all three said the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan eagerly drew his chair nearer to the place occupied by his\r\ntraveling companion. His reflections in the interval since they had last\r\nseen each other had not tended to compose him. That strange connection,\r\nso easy to feel, so hard to trace, between the difficulty of approaching\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s family circumstances and the difficulty of approaching Miss\r\nGwilt\xe2\x80\x99s reference, which had already established itself in his thoughts,\r\nhad by this time stealthily taken a firmer and firmer hold on his mind.\r\nDoubts troubled him which he could neither understand nor express.\r\nCuriosity filled him, which he half longed and half dreaded to satisfy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I must trouble you with a question or two, sir, before\r\nI can come to the point,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift Junior. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to force\r\nmyself into your confidence. I only want to see my way, in what looks to\r\nme like a very awkward business. Do you mind telling me whether others\r\nbesides yourself are interested in this inquiry of ours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther people _are_ interested in it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nobjection to telling you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any other person who is the object of the inquiry besides Mrs.\r\nMandeville, herself?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Pedgift, winding his way a little deeper\r\ninto the secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; there is another person,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, answering rather\r\nunwillingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the person a young woman, Mr. Armadale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan started. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you come to guess that?\xe2\x80\x9d he began, then checked\r\nhimself, when it was too late. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me any more questions,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nresumed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a bad hand at defending myself against a sharp fellow like\r\nyou; and I\xe2\x80\x99m bound in honor toward other people to keep the particulars\r\nof this business to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Junior had apparently heard enough for his purpose. He drew\r\nhis chair, in his turn, nearer to Allan. He was evidently anxious and\r\nembarrassed; but his professional manner began to show itself again from\r\nsheer force of habit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done with my questions, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand I have something to\r\nsay now on my side. In my father\xe2\x80\x99s absence, perhaps you may be kindly\r\ndisposed to consider me as your legal adviser. If you will take my\r\nadvice, you will not stir another step in this inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just possible, Mr. Armadale, that the cabman, positive as he is,\r\nmay have been mistaken. I strongly recommend you to take it for granted\r\nthat he _is_ mistaken, and to drop it there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe caution was kindly intended; but it came too late. Allan did what\r\nninety-nine men out of a hundred in his position would have done--he\r\ndeclined to take his lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s advice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift Junior; \xe2\x80\x9cif you will have it, you must\r\nhave it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward close to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s ear, and whispered what he had heard\r\nof the house in Pimlico, and of the people who occupied it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t blame me, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, when the irrevocable words had\r\nbeen spoken. \xe2\x80\x9cI tried to spare you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan suffered the shock, as all great shocks are suffered, in silence.\r\nHis first impulse would have driven him headlong for refuge to that very\r\nview of the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s assertion which had just been recommended to him,\r\nbut for one damning circumstance which placed itself inexorably in his\r\nway. Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s marked reluctance to approach the story of her\r\npast life rose irrepressibly on his memory, in indirect but horrible\r\nconfirmation of the evidence which connected Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s reference with\r\nthe house in Pimlico. One conclusion, and one only--the conclusion which\r\nany man must have drawn, hearing what he had just heard, and knowing\r\nno more than he knew--forced itself into his mind. A miserable, fallen\r\nwoman, who had abandoned herself in her extremity to the help of\r\nwretches skilled in criminal concealment, who had stolen her way back to\r\ndecent society and a reputable employment by means of a false character,\r\nand whose position now imposed on her the dreadful necessity of\r\nperpetual secrecy and perpetual deceit in relation to her past\r\nlife--such was the aspect in which the beautiful governess at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose now stood revealed to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes!\r\n\r\nFalsely revealed, or truly revealed? Had she stolen her way back to\r\ndecent society and a reputable employment by means of a false character?\r\nShe had. Did her position impose on her the dreadful necessity of\r\nperpetual secrecy and perpetual deceit in relation to her past life? It\r\ndid. Was she some such pitiable victim to the treachery of a man unknown\r\nas Allan had supposed? _She was no such pitiable victim_. The conclusion\r\nwhich Allan had drawn--the conclusion literally forced into his mind by\r\nthe facts before him--was, nevertheless, the conclusion of all others\r\nthat was furthest even from touching on the truth. The true story of\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s connection with the house in Pimlico and the people who\r\ninhabited it--a house rightly described as filled with wicked secrets,\r\nand people rightly represented as perpetually in danger of feeling the\r\ngrasp of the law--was a story which coming events were yet to disclose:\r\na story infinitely less revolting, and yet infinitely more terrible,\r\nthan Allan or Allan\xe2\x80\x99s companion had either of them supposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to spare you, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Pedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cI was anxious,\r\nif I could possibly avoid it, not to distress you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan looked up, and made an effort to control himself. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\ndistressed me dreadfully,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have quite crushed me down. But\r\nit is not your fault. I ought to feel you have done me a service; and\r\nwhat I ought to do I will do, when I am my own man again. There is one\r\nthing,\xe2\x80\x9d Allan added, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s painful consideration, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich\r\nought to be understood between us at once. The advice you offered me\r\njust now was very kindly meant, and it was the best advice that could be\r\ngiven. I will take it gratefully. We will never talk of this again, if\r\nyou please; and I beg and entreat you will never speak about it to any\r\nother person. Will you promise me that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift gave the promise with very evident sincerity, but without his\r\nprofessional confidence of manner. The distress in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s face seemed\r\nto daunt him. After a moment of very uncharacteristic hesitation, he\r\nconsiderately quitted the room.\r\n\r\nLeft by himself, Allan rang for writing materials, and took out of his\r\npocket-book the fatal letter of introduction to \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Mandeville\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nhe had received from the major\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\nA man accustomed to consider consequences and to prepare himself for\r\naction by previous thought would, in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s present circumstances,\r\nhave felt some difficulty as to the course which it might now be least\r\nembarrassing and least dangerous to pursue. Accustomed to let his\r\nimpulses direct him on all other occasions, Allan acted on impulse in\r\nthe serious emergency that now confronted him. Though his attachment\r\nto Miss Gwilt was nothing like the deeply rooted feeling which he had\r\nhimself honestly believed it to be, she had taken no common place in his\r\nadmiration, and she filled him with no common grief when he thought of\r\nher now. His one dominant desire, at that critical moment in his life,\r\nwas a man\xe2\x80\x99s merciful desire to protect from exposure and ruin the\r\nunhappy woman who had lost her place in his estimation, without losing\r\nher claim to the forbearance that could spare, and to the compassion\r\nthat could shield her. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go back to Thorpe Ambrose; I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrust myself to speak to her, or to see her again. But I can keep her\r\nmiserable secret; and I will!\xe2\x80\x9d With that thought in his heart, Allan\r\nset himself to perform the first and foremost duty which now claimed\r\nhim--the duty of communicating with Mrs. Milroy. If he had possessed a\r\nhigher mental capacity and a clearer mental view, he might have\r\nfound the letter no easy one to write. As it was, he calculated no\r\nconsequences, and felt no difficulty. His instinct warned him to\r\nwithdraw at once from the position in which he now stood toward the\r\nmajor\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and he wrote what his instinct counseled him to write\r\nunder those circumstances, as rapidly as the pen could travel over the\r\npaper:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDunn\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, Covent Garden, Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM--Pray excuse my not returning to Thorpe Ambrose to-day, as I\r\nsaid I would. Unforeseen circumstances oblige me to stop in London. I am\r\nsorry to say I have not succeeded in seeing Mrs. Mandeville, for which\r\nreason I cannot perform your errand; and I beg, therefore, with many\r\napologies, to return the letter of introduction. I hope you will allow\r\nme to conclude by saying that I am very much obliged to you for your\r\nkindness, and that I will not venture to trespass on it any further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remain, dear madam, yours truly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cALLAN ARMADALE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those artless words, still entirely unsuspicious of the character of\r\nthe woman he had to deal with, Allan put the weapon she wanted into Mrs.\r\nMilroy\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\nThe letter and its inclosure once sealed up and addressed, he was free\r\nto think of himself and his future. As he sat idly drawing lines with\r\nhis pen on the blotting-paper, the tears came into his eyes for the\r\nfirst time--tears in which the woman who had deceived him had no share.\r\nHis heart had gone back to his dead mother. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she had been alive,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cI might have trusted _her_, and she would have comforted me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n It was useless to dwell on it; he dashed away the tears, and turned his\r\nthoughts, with the heart-sick resignation that we all know, to living\r\nand present things.\r\n\r\nHe wrote a line to Mr. Bashwood, briefly informing the deputy steward\r\nthat his absence from Thorpe Ambrose was likely to be prolonged for some\r\nlittle time, and that any further instructions which might be necessary,\r\nunder those circumstances, would reach him through Mr. Pedgift the\r\nelder. This done, and the letters sent to the post, his thoughts were\r\nforced back once more on himself. Again the blank future waited before\r\nhim to be filled up; and again his heart shrank from it to the refuge of\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nThis time other images than the image of his mother filled his mind. The\r\none all-absorbing interest of his earlier days stirred living and eager\r\nin him again. He thought of the sea; he thought of his yacht lying idle\r\nin the fishing harbor at his west-country home. The old longing got\r\npossession of him to hear the wash of the waves; to see the filling of\r\nthe sails; to feel the vessel that his own hands had helped to build\r\nbounding under him once more. He rose in his impetuous way to call for\r\nthe time-table, and to start for Somersetshire by the first train, when\r\nthe dread of the questions which Mr. Brock might ask, the suspicion of\r\nthe change which Mr. Brock might see in him, drew him back to his chair.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll write,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cto have the yacht rigged and refitted, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait to go to Somersetshire myself till Midwinter can go with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He sighed as his memory reverted to his absent friend. Never had he felt\r\nthe void made in his life by Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s departure so painfully as he\r\nfelt it now, in the dreariest of all social solitudes--the solitude of a\r\nstranger in London, left by himself at a hotel.\r\n\r\nBefore long, Pedgift Junior looked in, with an apology for his\r\nintrusion. Allan felt too lonely and too friendless not to welcome his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s re-appearance gratefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going back to Thorpe\r\nAmbrose,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to stay a little while in London. I\r\nhope you will be able to stay with me?\xe2\x80\x9d To do him justice, Pedgift was\r\ntouched by the solitary position in which the owner of the great Thorpe\r\nAmbrose estate now appeared before him. He had never, in his relations\r\nwith Allan, so entirely forgotten his business interests as he forgot\r\nthem now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right, sir, to stop here; London\xe2\x80\x99s the place to divert\r\nyour mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift, cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAll business is more or less\r\nelastic in its nature, Mr. Armadale; I\xe2\x80\x99ll spin _my_ business out, and\r\nkeep you company with the greatest pleasure. We are both of us on the\r\nright side of thirty, sir; let\xe2\x80\x99s enjoy ourselves. What do you say to\r\ndining early, and going to the play, and trying the Great Exhibition\r\nin Hyde Park to-morrow morning, after breakfast? If we only live like\r\nfighting-cocks, and go in perpetually for public amusements, we shall\r\narrive in no time at the _mens sana in corpore sano_ of the ancients.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed at the quotation, sir. I dabble a little in Latin after\r\nbusiness hours, and enlarge my sympathies by occasional perusal of the\r\nPagan writers, assisted by a crib. William, dinner at five; and, as it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparticularly important to-day, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see the cook myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe evening passed; the next day passed; Thursday morning came, and\r\nbrought with it a letter for Allan. The direction was in Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandwriting; and the form of address adopted in the letter warned Allan,\r\nthe moment he opened it, that something had gone wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Cottage, Thorpe Ambrose, Wednesday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSIR--I have just received your mysterious letter. It has more than\r\nsurprised, it has really alarmed me. After having made the friendliest\r\nadvances to you on my side, I find myself suddenly shut out from\r\nyour confidence in the most unintelligible, and, I must add, the most\r\ndiscourteous manner. It is quite impossible that I can allow the matter\r\nto rest where you have left it. The only conclusion I can draw from your\r\nletter is that my confidence must have been abused in some way, and that\r\nyou know a great deal more than you are willing to tell me. Speaking in\r\nthe interest of my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s welfare, I request that you will inform\r\nme what the circumstances are which have prevented your seeing Mrs.\r\nMandeville, and which have led to the withdrawal of the assistance that\r\nyou unconditionally promised me in your letter of Monday last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my state of health, I cannot involve myself in a lengthened\r\ncorrespondence. I must endeavor to anticipate any objections you may\r\nmake, and I must say all that I have to say in my present letter. In the\r\nevent (which I am most unwilling to consider possible) of your declining\r\nto accede to the request that I have just addressed to you, I beg to\r\nsay that I shall consider it my duty to my daughter to have this very\r\nunpleasant matter cleared up. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear from you to my full\r\nsatisfaction by return of post, I shall be obliged to tell my husband\r\nthat circumstances have happened which justify us in immediately testing\r\nthe respectability of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s reference. And when he asks me for my\r\nauthority, I will refer him to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour obedient servant, ANNE MILROY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those terms the major\xe2\x80\x99s wife threw off the mask, and left her victim\r\nto survey at his leisure the trap in which she had caught him. Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbelief in Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s good faith had been so implicitly sincere\r\nthat her letter simply bewildered him. He saw vaguely that he had been\r\ndeceived in some way, and that Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s neighborly interest in\r\nhim was not what it had looked on the surface; and he saw no more. The\r\nthreat of appealing to the major--on which, with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance of\r\nthe natures of men, Mrs. Milroy had relied for producing its\r\neffect--was the only part of the letter to which Allan reverted with any\r\nsatisfaction: it relieved instead of alarming him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there _is_ to be\r\na quarrel,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be a comfort, at any rate, to have it\r\nout with a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFirm in his resolution to shield the unhappy woman whose secret he\r\nwrongly believed himself to have surprised, Allan sat down to write\r\nhis apologies to the major\xe2\x80\x99s wife. After setting up three polite\r\ndeclarations, in close marching order, he retired from the field. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nwas extremely sorry to have offended Mrs. Milroy. He was innocent of all\r\nintention to offend Mrs. Milroy. And he begged to remain Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntruly.\xe2\x80\x9d Never had Allan\xe2\x80\x99s habitual brevity as a letter-writer done him\r\nbetter service than it did him now. With a little more skillfulness in\r\nthe use of his pen, he might have given his enemy even a stronger hold\r\non him than the hold she had got already.\r\n\r\nThe interval day passed, and with the next morning\xe2\x80\x99s post Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthreat came realized in the shape of a letter from her husband. The\r\nmajor wrote less formally than his wife had written, but his questions\r\nwere mercilessly to the point:\r\n\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Cottage, Thorpe Ambrose, Friday, July 11, 1851.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR--When you did me the favor of calling here a few days since,\r\nyou asked a question relating to my governess, Miss Gwilt, which I\r\nthought rather a strange one at the time, and which caused, as you may\r\nremember, a momentary embarrassment between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning the subject of Miss Gwilt has been brought to my notice\r\nagain in a manner which has caused me the utmost astonishment. In plain\r\nwords, Mrs. Milroy has informed me that Miss Gwilt has exposed herself\r\nto the suspicion of having deceived us by a false reference. On my\r\nexpressing the surprise which such an extraordinary statement caused\r\nme, and requesting that it might be instantly substantiated, I was still\r\nfurther astonished by being told to apply for all particulars to no\r\nless a person than Mr. Armadale. I have vainly requested some further\r\nexplanation from Mrs. Milroy; she persists in maintaining silence, and\r\nin referring me to yourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder these extraordinary circumstances, I am compelled, in justice to\r\nall parties, to ask you certain questions which I will endeavor to put\r\nas plainly as possible, and which I am quite ready to believe (from my\r\nprevious experience of you) that you will answer frankly on your side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg to inquire, in the first place, whether you admit or deny\r\nMrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that you have made yourself acquainted with\r\nparticulars relating either to Miss Gwilt or to Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s reference,\r\nof which I am entirely ignorant? In the second place, if you admit\r\nthe truth of Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s statement, I request to know how you became\r\nacquainted with those particulars? Thirdly, and lastly, I beg to ask you\r\nwhat the particulars are?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf any special justification for putting these questions be\r\nneeded--which, purely as a matter of courtesy toward yourself, I am\r\nwilling to admit--I beg to remind you that the most precious charge in\r\nmy house, the charge of my daughter, is confided to Miss Gwilt; and that\r\nMrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s statement places you, to all appearance, in the position\r\nof being competent to tell me whether that charge is properly bestowed\r\nor not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only to add that, as nothing has thus far occurred to justify\r\nme in entertaining the slightest suspicion either of my governess or her\r\nreference, I shall wait before I make any appeal to Miss Gwilt until\r\nI have received your answer--which I shall expect by return of post.\r\nBelieve me, dear sir, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDAVID MILROY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis transparently straightforward letter at once dissipated the\r\nconfusion which had thus far existed in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s mind. He saw the snare\r\nin which he had been caught (though he was still necessarily at a loss\r\nto understand why it had been set for him) as he had not seen it\r\nyet. Mrs. Milroy had clearly placed him between two alternatives--the\r\nalternative of putting himself in the wrong, by declining to answer\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s questions; or the alternative of meanly sheltering his\r\nresponsibility behind the responsibility of a woman, by acknowledging to\r\nthe major\xe2\x80\x99s own face that the major\xe2\x80\x99s wife had deceived him.\r\n\r\nIn this difficulty Allan acted as usual, without hesitation. His pledge\r\nto Mrs. Milroy to consider their correspondence private still bound him,\r\ndisgracefully as she had abused it. And his resolution was as immovable\r\nas ever to let no earthly consideration tempt him into betraying Miss\r\nGwilt. \xe2\x80\x9cI may have behaved like a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I won\xe2\x80\x99t break\r\nmy word; and I won\xe2\x80\x99t be the means of turning that miserable woman adrift\r\nin the world again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wrote to the major as artlessly and briefly as he had written to\r\nthe major\xe2\x80\x99s wife. He declared his unwillingness to cause a friend and\r\nneighbor any disappointment, if he could possibly help it. On this\r\noccasion he had no other choice. The questions the major asked him were\r\nquestions which he could not consent to answer. He was not very clever\r\nat explaining himself, and he hoped he might be excused for putting it\r\nin that way, and saying no more.\r\n\r\nMonday\xe2\x80\x99s post brought with it Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s rejoinder, and closed the\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Cottage, Thorpe Ambrose, Sunday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSIR--Your refusal to answer my questions, unaccompanied as it is by\r\neven the shadow of an excuse for such a proceeding, can be interpreted\r\nbut in one way. Besides being an implied acknowledgment of the\r\ncorrectness of Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s statement, it is also an implied reflection\r\non my governess\xe2\x80\x99s character. As an act of justice toward a lady who\r\nlives under the protection of my roof, and who has given me no reason\r\nwhatever to distrust her, I shall now show our correspondence to Miss\r\nGwilt; and I shall repeat to her the conversation which I had with Mrs.\r\nMilroy on the subject, in Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word more respecting the future relations between us, and I have\r\ndone. My ideas on certain subjects are, I dare say, the ideas of an\r\nold-fashioned man. In my time, we had a code of honor by which we\r\nregulated our actions. According to that code, if a man made private\r\ninquiries into a lady\xe2\x80\x99s affairs, without being either her husband, her\r\nfather, or her brother, he subjected himself to the responsibility of\r\njustifying his conduct in the estimation of others; and, if he evaded\r\nthat responsibility, he abdicated the position of a gentleman. It is\r\nquite possible that this antiquated way of thinking exists no longer;\r\nbut it is too late for me, at my time of life, to adopt more modern\r\nviews. I am scrupulously anxious, seeing that we live in a country and\r\na time in which the only court of honor is a police-court, to express\r\nmyself with the utmost moderation of language upon this the last\r\noccasion that I shall have to communicate with you. Allow me, therefore,\r\nmerely to remark that our ideas of the conduct which is becoming in a\r\ngentleman differ seriously; and permit me on this account to request\r\nthat you will consider yourself for the future as a stranger to my\r\nfamily and to myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDAVID MILROY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Monday morning on which his client received the major\xe2\x80\x99s letter was\r\nthe blackest Monday that had yet been marked in Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s calendar. When\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s first angry sense of the tone of contempt in which his friend\r\nand neighbor pronounced sentence on him had subsided, it left him sunk\r\nin a state of depression from which no efforts made by his traveling\r\ncompanion could rouse him for the rest of the day. Reverting naturally,\r\nnow that his sentence of banishment had been pronounced, to his early\r\nintercourse with the cottage, his memory went back to Neelie, more\r\nregretfully and more penitently than it had gone back to her yet. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\n_she_ had shut the door on me, instead of her father,\xe2\x80\x9d was the bitter\r\nreflection with which Allan now reviewed the past, \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had\r\na word to say against it; I should have felt it served me right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day brought another letter--a welcome letter this time,\r\nfrom Mr. Brock. Allan had written to Somersetshire on the subject of\r\nrefitting the yacht some days since. The letter had found the rector\r\nengaged, as he innocently supposed, in protecting his old pupil against\r\nthe woman whom he had watched in London, and whom he now believed to\r\nhave followed him back to his own home. Acting under the directions sent\r\nto her, Mrs. Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s house-maid had completed the mystification of\r\nMr. Brock. She had tranquilized all further anxiety on the rector\xe2\x80\x99s part\r\nby giving him a written undertaking (in the character of Miss Gwilt),\r\nengaging never to approach Mr. Armadale, either personally or by letter!\r\nFirmly persuaded that he had won the victory at last, poor Mr. Brock\r\nanswered Allan\xe2\x80\x99s note in the highest spirits, expressing some natural\r\nsurprise at his leaving Thorpe Ambrose, but readily promising that the\r\nyacht should be refitted, and offering the hospitality of the rectory in\r\nthe heartiest manner.\r\n\r\nThis letter did wonders in raising Allan\xe2\x80\x99s spirits. It gave him a\r\nnew interest to look to, entirely disassociated from his past life in\r\nNorfolk. He began to count the days that were still to pass before the\r\nreturn of his absent friend. It was then Tuesday. If Midwinter came back\r\nfrom his walking trip, as he had engaged to come back, in a fortnight,\r\nSaturday would find him at Thorpe Ambrose. A note sent to meet the\r\ntraveler might bring him to London the same night; and, if all went\r\nwell, before another week was over they might be afloat together in the\r\nyacht.\r\n\r\nThe next day passed, to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s relief, without bringing any letters.\r\nThe spirits of Pedgift rose sympathetically with the spirits of his\r\nclient. Toward dinner time he reverted to the _mens sana in corpore\r\nsano_ of the ancients, and issued his orders to the head-waiter more\r\nroyally than ever.\r\n\r\nThursday came, and brought the fatal postman with more news from\r\nNorfolk. A letter-writer now stepped on the scene who had not appeared\r\nthere yet; and the total overthrow of all Allan\xe2\x80\x99s plans for a visit to\r\nSomersetshire was accomplished on the spot.\r\n\r\nPedgift Junior happened that morning to be the first at the breakfast\r\ntable. When Allan came in, he relapsed into his professional manner, and\r\noffered a letter to his patron with a bow performed in dreary silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Allan, shrinking instinctively from a new\r\ncorrespondent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you, sir--from my father,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pedgift, \xe2\x80\x9cinclosed in one to\r\nmyself. Perhaps you will allow me to suggest, by way of preparing\r\nyou for--for something a little unpleasant--that we shall want a\r\nparticularly good dinner to-day; and (if they\xe2\x80\x99re not performing any\r\nmodern German music to-night) I think we should do well to finish the\r\nevening melodiously at the Opera.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething wrong at Thorpe Ambrose?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Armadale; something wrong at Thorpe Ambrose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan sat down resignedly, and opened the letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate and Confidential.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh Street Thorpe Ambrose, 17th July, 1851.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR--I cannot reconcile it with my sense of duty to your interests\r\nto leave you any longer in ignorance of reports current in this town\r\nand its neighborhood, which, I regret to say, are reports affecting\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first intimation of anything unpleasant reached me on Monday last.\r\nIt was widely rumored in the town that something had gone wrong at Major\r\nMilroy\xe2\x80\x99s with the new governess, and that Mr. Armadale was mixed up in\r\nit. I paid no heed to this, believing it to be one of the many trumpery\r\npieces of scandal perpetually set going here, and as necessary as\r\nthe air they breathe to the comfort of the inhabitants of this highly\r\nrespectable place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTuesday, however, put the matter in a new light. The most interesting\r\nparticulars were circulated on the highest authority. On Wednesday,\r\nthe gentry in the neighborhood took the matter up, and universally\r\nsanctioned the view adopted by the town. To-day the public feeling has\r\nreached its climax, and I find myself under the necessity of making you\r\nacquainted with what has happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo begin at the beginning. It is asserted that a correspondence took\r\nplace last week between Major Milroy and yourself; in which you cast a\r\nvery serious suspicion on Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s respectability, without defining\r\nyour accusations and without (on being applied to) producing your\r\nproofs. Upon this, the major appears to have felt it his duty (while\r\nassuring his governess of his own firm belief in her respectability) to\r\ninform her of what had happened, in order that she might have no future\r\nreason to complain of his having had any concealments from her in a\r\nmatter affecting her character. Very magnanimous on the major\xe2\x80\x99s part;\r\nbut you will see directly that Miss Gwilt was more magnanimous still.\r\nAfter expressing her thanks in a most becoming manner, she requested\r\npermission to withdraw herself from Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVarious reports are in circulation as to the governess\xe2\x80\x99s reason for\r\ntaking this step.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe authorized version (as sanctioned by the resident gentry)\r\nrepresents Miss Gwilt to have said that she could not condescend--in\r\njustice to herself, and in justice to her highly respectable\r\nreference--to defend her reputation against undefined imputations cast\r\non it by a comparative stranger. At the same time it was impossible for\r\nher to pursue such a course of conduct as this, unless she possessed a\r\nfreedom of action which was quite incompatible with her continuing to\r\noccupy the dependent position of a governess. For that reason she felt\r\nit incumbent on her to leave her situation. But, while doing this,\r\nshe was equally determined not to lead to any misinterpretation of her\r\nmotives by leaving the neighborhood. No matter at what inconvenience\r\nto herself, she would remain long enough at Thorpe Ambrose to await\r\nany more definitely expressed imputations that might be made on her\r\ncharacter, and to repel them publicly the instant they assumed a\r\ntangible form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch is the position which this high-minded lady has taken up, with an\r\nexcellent effect on the public mind in these parts. It is clearly her\r\ninterest, for some reason, to leave her situation, without leaving the\r\nneighborhood. On Monday last she established herself in a cheap lodging\r\non the outskirts of the town. And on the same day she probably wrote to\r\nher reference, for yesterday there came a letter from that lady to Major\r\nMilroy, full of virtuous indignation, and courting the fullest inquiry.\r\nThe letter has been shown publicly, and has immensely strengthened\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s position. She is now considered to be quite a heroine. The\r\n_Thorpe Ambrose Mercury_ has got a leading article about her, comparing\r\nher to Joan of Arc. It is considered probable that she will be referred\r\nto in the sermon next Sunday. We reckon five strong-minded single ladies\r\nin this neighborhood--and all five have called on her. A testimonial was\r\nsuggested; but it has been given up at Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s own request, and a\r\ngeneral movement is now on foot to get her employment as a teacher of\r\nmusic. Lastly, I have had the honor of a visit from the lady herself,\r\nin her capacity of martyr, to tell me, in the sweetest manner, that she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t blame Mr. Armadale, and that she considers him to be an innocent\r\ninstrument in the hands of other and more designing people. I was\r\ncarefully on my guard with her; for I don\xe2\x80\x99t altogether believe in Miss\r\nGwilt, and I have my lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions of the motive that is at the\r\nbottom of her present proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have written thus far, my dear sir, with little hesitation or\r\nembarrassment. But there is unfortunately a serious side to this\r\nbusiness as well as a ridiculous side; and I must unwillingly come to it\r\nbefore I close my letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, I think, quite impossible that you can permit yourself to be\r\nspoken of as you are spoken of now, without stirring personally in the\r\nmatter. You have unluckily made many enemies here, and foremost among\r\nthem is my colleague, Mr. Darch. He has been showing everywhere a\r\nsomewhat rashly expressed letter you wrote to him on the subject of\r\nletting the cottage to Major Milroy instead of to himself, and it has\r\nhelped to exasperate the feeling against you. It is roundly stated in so\r\nmany words that you have been prying into Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s family affairs,\r\nwith the most dishonorable motives; that you have tried, for a\r\nprofligate purpose of your own, to damage her reputation, and to deprive\r\nher of the protection of Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s roof; and that, after having\r\nbeen asked to substantiate by proof the suspicions that you have cast\r\non the reputation of a defenseless woman, you have maintained a silence\r\nwhich condemns you in the estimation of all honorable men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it is quite unnecessary for me to say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t attach the\r\nsmallest particle of credit to these infamous reports. But they are too\r\nwidely spread and too widely believed to be treated with contempt.\r\nI strongly urge you to return at once to this place, and to take the\r\nnecessary measures for defending your character, in concert with me, as\r\nyour legal adviser. I have formed, since my interview with Miss Gwilt,\r\na very strong opinion of my own on the subject of that lady which it is\r\nnot necessary to commit to paper. Suffice it to say here that I shall\r\nhave a means to propose to you for silencing the slanderous tongues\r\nof your neighbors, on the success of which I stake my professional\r\nreputation, if you will only back me by your presence and authority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may, perhaps, help to show you the necessity there is for your\r\nreturn, if I mention one other assertion respecting yourself, which is\r\nin everybody\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. Your absence is, I regret to tell you, attributed\r\nto the meanest of all motives. It is said that you are remaining in\r\nLondon because you are afraid to show your face at Thorpe Ambrose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, dear sir, your faithful servant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA. PEDGIFT, Sen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAllan was of an age to feel the sting contained in the last sentence\r\nof his lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s letter. He started to his feet in a paroxysm of\r\nindignation, which revealed his character to Pedgift Junior in an\r\nentirely new light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the time-table?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go back to Thorpe Ambrose\r\nby the next train! If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t start directly, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a special\r\nengine. I must and will go back instantly, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care two straws\r\nfor the expense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we telegraph to my father, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the judicious\r\nPedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the quickest way of expressing your feelings, and the\r\ncheapest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for reminding me of it. Telegraph\r\nto them! Tell your father to give every man in Thorpe Ambrose the\r\nlie direct, in my name. Put it in capital letters, Pedgift--put it in\r\ncapital letters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift smiled and shook his head. If he was acquainted with no other\r\nvariety of human nature, he thoroughly knew the variety that exists in\r\ncountry towns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t have the least effect on them, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked\r\nquietly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll only go on lying harder than ever. If you want to\r\nupset the whole town, one line will do it. With five shillings\xe2\x80\x99 worth of\r\nhuman labor and electric fluid, sir (I dabble a little in science\r\nafter business hours), we\xe2\x80\x99ll explode a bombshell in Thorpe Ambrose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He produced the bombshell on a slip of paper as he spoke: \xe2\x80\x9cA. Pedgift,\r\nJunior, to A. Pedgift, Senior.--Spread it all over the place that Mr.\r\nArmadale is coming down by the next train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore words!\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Allan, looking over his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cMake it\r\nstronger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave my father to make it stronger, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the wary Pedgift.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father is on the spot, and his command of language is something\r\nquite extraordinary.\xe2\x80\x9d He rang the bell, and dispatched the telegram.\r\n\r\nNow that something had been done, Allan subsided gradually into a state\r\nof composure. He looked back again at Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and then\r\nhanded it to Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you guess your father\xe2\x80\x99s plan for setting me right in the\r\nneighborhood?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nPedgift the younger shook his wise head. \xe2\x80\x9cHis plan appears to be\r\nconnected in some way, sir, with his opinion of Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what he thinks of her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pedgift Junior, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nhis opinion staggers you a little, when you come to hear it. My father\r\nhas had a large legal experience of the shady side of the sex, and he\r\nlearned his profession at the Old Bailey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan made no further inquiries. He seemed to shrink from pursuing the\r\nsubject, after having started it himself. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s be doing something to\r\nkill the time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s pack up and pay the bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey packed up and paid the bill. The hour came, and the train left for\r\nNorfolk at last.\r\n\r\nWhile the travelers were on their way back, a somewhat longer\r\ntelegraphic message than Allan\xe2\x80\x99s was flashing its way past them along\r\nthe wires, in the reverse direction--from Thorpe Ambrose to London. The\r\nmessage was in cipher, and, the signs being interpreted, it ran thus:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Lydia Gwilt to Maria Oldershaw.--Good news! He is coming back. I\r\nmean to have an interview with him. Everything looks well. Now I have\r\nleft the cottage, I have no women\xe2\x80\x99s prying eyes to dread, and I can come\r\nand go as I please. Mr. Midwinter is luckily out of the way. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndespair of becoming Mrs. Armadale yet. Whatever happens, depend on my\r\nkeeping away from London until I am certain of not taking any spies\r\nafter me to your place. I am in no hurry to leave Thorpe Ambrose. I mean\r\nto be even with Miss Milroy first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShortly after that message was received in London, Allan was back again\r\nin his own house.\r\n\r\nIt was evening--Pedgift Junior had just left him--and Pedgift Senior was\r\nexpected to call on business in half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. PEDGIFT\xe2\x80\x99S REMEDY.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting to hold a preliminary consultation with his son, Mr.\r\nPedgift the elder set forth alone for his interview with Allan at the\r\ngreat house.\r\n\r\nAllowing for the difference in their ages, the son was, in this\r\ninstance, so accurately the reflection of the father, that an\r\nacquaintance with either of the two Pedgifts was almost equivalent to an\r\nacquaintance with both. Add some little height and size to the figure\r\nof Pedgift Junior, give more breadth and boldness to his humor, and some\r\nadditional solidity and composure to his confidence in himself, and\r\nthe presence and character of Pedgift Senior stood, for all general\r\npurposes, revealed before you.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s conveyance to Thorpe Ambrose was his own smart gig, drawn\r\nby his famous fast-trotting mare. It was his habit to drive himself; and\r\nit was one among the trifling external peculiarities in which he and his\r\nson differed a little, to affect something of the sporting character in\r\nhis dress. The drab trousers of Pedgift the elder fitted close to his\r\nlegs; his boots, in dry weather and wet alike, were equally thick in\r\nthe sole; his coat pockets overlapped his hips, and his favorite summer\r\ncravat was of light spotted muslin, tied in the neatest and smallest of\r\nbows. He used tobacco like his son, but in a different form. While the\r\nyounger man smoked, the elder took snuff copiously; and it was noticed\r\namong his intimates that he always held his \xe2\x80\x9cpinch\xe2\x80\x9d in a state of\r\nsuspense between his box and his nose when he was going to clinch a good\r\nbargain or to say a good thing. The art of diplomacy enters largely into\r\nthe practice of all successful men in the lower branch of the law. Mr.\r\nPedgift\xe2\x80\x99s form of diplomatic practice had been the same throughout his\r\nlife, on every occasion when he found his arts of persuasion required\r\nat an interview with another man. He invariably kept his strongest\r\nargument, or his boldest proposal, to the last, and invariably\r\nremembered it at the door (after previously taking his leave), as if it\r\nwas a purely accidental consideration which had that instant occurred to\r\nhim. Jocular friends, acquainted by previous experience with this form\r\nof proceeding, had given it the name of \xe2\x80\x9cPedgift\xe2\x80\x99s postscript.\xe2\x80\x9d There\r\nwere few people in Thorpe Ambrose who did not know what it meant when\r\nthe lawyer suddenly checked his exit at the opened door; came back\r\nsoftly to his chair, with his pinch of snuff suspended between his\r\nbox and his nose; said, \xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-by, there\xe2\x80\x99s a point occurs to me;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nsettled the question off-hand, after having given it up in despair not a\r\nminute before.\r\n\r\nThis was the man whom the march of events at Thorpe Ambrose had now\r\nthrust capriciously into a foremost place. This was the one friend at\r\nhand to whom Allan in his social isolation could turn for counsel in the\r\nhour of need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening, Mr. Armadale. Many thanks for your prompt attention to my\r\nvery disagreeable letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift Senior, opening the conversation\r\ncheerfully the moment he entered his client\xe2\x80\x99s house. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\r\nunderstand, sir, that I had really no choice under the circumstances but\r\nto write as I did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have very few friends, Mr. Pedgift,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan, simply. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\r\nam sure you are one of the few.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch obliged, Mr. Armadale. I have always tried to deserve your good\r\nopinion, and I mean, if I can, to deserve it now. You found yourself\r\ncomfortable, I hope, sir, at the hotel in London? We call it Our hotel.\r\nSome rare old wine in the cellar, which I should have introduced to your\r\nnotice if I had had the honor of being with you. My son unfortunately\r\nknows nothing about wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan felt his false position in the neighborhood far too acutely to be\r\ncapable of talking of anything but the main business of the evening. His\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s politely roundabout method of approaching the painful subject\r\nto be discussed between them rather irritated than composed him. He came\r\nat once to the point, in his own bluntly straightforward way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hotel was very comfortable, Mr. Pedgift, and your son was very kind\r\nto me. But we are not in London now; and I want to talk to you about\r\nhow I am to meet the lies that are being told of me in this place.\r\nOnly point me out any one man,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, with a rising voice and a\r\nmounting color--\xe2\x80\x9cany one man who says I am afraid to show my face in the\r\nneighborhood, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll horsewhip him publicly before another day is over\r\nhis head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Senior helped himself to a pinch of snuff, and held it calmly in\r\nsuspense midway between his box and his nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can horsewhip a man, sir; but you can\xe2\x80\x99t horsewhip a neighborhood,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the lawyer, in his politely epigrammatic manner. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will fight our\r\nbattle, if you please, without borrowing our weapons of the coachman yet\r\na while, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how are we to begin?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to\r\ncontradict the infamous things they say of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two ways of stepping out of your present awkward position,\r\nsir--a short way, and a long way,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pedgift Senior. \xe2\x80\x9cThe short\r\nway (which is always the best) has occurred to me since I have heard of\r\nyour proceedings in London from my son. I understand that you permitted\r\nhim, after you received my letter, to take me into your confidence. I\r\nhave drawn various conclusions from what he has told me, which I may\r\nfind it necessary to trouble you with presently. In the meantime I\r\nshould be glad to know under what circumstances you went to London\r\nto make these unfortunate inquiries about Miss Gwilt? Was it your own\r\nnotion to pay that visit to Mrs. Mandeville? or were you acting under\r\nthe influence of some other person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t honestly tell you it was my own notion,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied, and said no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought as much!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pedgift Senior, in high triumph. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nshort way out of our present difficulty, Mr. Armadale, lies straight\r\nthrough that other person, under whose influence you acted. That other\r\nperson must be presented forthwith to public notice, and must stand in\r\nthat other person\xe2\x80\x99s proper place. The name, if you please, sir, to begin\r\nwith--we\xe2\x80\x99ll come to the circumstances directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to say, Mr. Pedgift, that we must try the longest way, if\r\nyou have no objection,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Allan, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe short way happens\r\nto be a way I can\xe2\x80\x99t take on this occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men who rise in the law are the men who decline to take No for an\r\nanswer. Mr. Pedgift the elder had risen in the law; and Mr. Pedgift the\r\nelder now declined to take No for an answer. But all pertinacity--even\r\nprofessional pertinacity included--sooner or later finds its limits; and\r\nthe lawyer, doubly fortified as he was by long experience and copious\r\npinches of snuff, found his limits at the very outset of the interview.\r\nIt was impossible that Allan could respect the confidence which Mrs.\r\nMilroy had treacherously affected to place in him. But he had an\r\nhonest man\xe2\x80\x99s regard for his own pledged word--the regard which looks\r\nstraightforward at the fact, and which never glances sidelong at the\r\ncircumstances--and the utmost persistency of Pedgift Senior failed to\r\nmove him a hairbreadth from the position which he had taken up. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nthe strongest word in the English language, in the mouth of any man who\r\nhas the courage to repeat it often enough, and Allan had the courage to\r\nrepeat it often enough on this occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, accepting his defeat without the\r\nslightest loss of temper. \xe2\x80\x9cThe choice rests with you, and you have\r\nchosen. We will go the long way. It starts (allow me to inform you) from\r\nmy office; and it leads (as I strongly suspect) through a very miry road\r\nto--Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan looked at his legal adviser in speechless astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you won\xe2\x80\x99t expose the person who is responsible in the first\r\ninstance, sir, for the inquiries to which you unfortunately lent\r\nyourself,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Mr. Pedgift the elder, \xe2\x80\x9cthe only other alternative,\r\nin your present position, is to justify the inquiries themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is that to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy proving to the whole neighborhood, Mr. Armadale, what I firmly\r\nbelieve to be the truth--that the pet object of the public protection is\r\nan adventuress of the worst class; an undeniably worthless and dangerous\r\nwoman. In plainer English still, sir, by employing time enough and money\r\nenough to discover the truth about Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Allan could say a word in answer, there was an interruption at\r\nthe door. After the usual preliminary knock, one of the servants came\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you I was not to be interrupted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, irritably. \xe2\x80\x9cGood\r\nheavens! am I never to have done with them? Another letter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, holding it out. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, speaking\r\nwords of evil omen in his master\xe2\x80\x99s ears, \xe2\x80\x9cthe person waits for an\r\nanswer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan looked at the address of the letter with a natural expectation of\r\nencountering the handwriting of the major\xe2\x80\x99s wife. The anticipation was\r\nnot realized. His correspondent was plainly a lady, but the lady was not\r\nMrs. Milroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking mechanically at Pedgift Senior as he\r\nopened the envelope.\r\n\r\nPedgift Senior gently tapped his snuff-box, and said, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan opened the letter. The first two words in it were the echo of the\r\ntwo words the lawyer had just pronounced. It _was_ Miss Gwilt!\r\n\r\nOnce more, Allan looked at his legal adviser in speechless astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have known a good many of them in my time, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Pedgift\r\nSenior, with a modesty equally rare and becoming in a man of his age.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as handsome as Miss Gwilt, I admit. But quite as bad, I dare say.\r\nRead your letter, Mr. Armadale--read your letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan read these lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt presents her compliments to Mr. Armadale and begs to know if\r\nit will be convenient to him to favor her with an interview, either this\r\nevening or to-morrow morning. Miss Gwilt offers no apology for making\r\nher present request. She believes Mr. Armadale will grant it as an act\r\nof justice toward a friendless woman whom he has been innocently the\r\nmeans of injuring, and who is earnestly desirous to set herself right in\r\nhis estimation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAllan handed the letter to his lawyer in silent perplexity and distress.\r\n\r\nThe face of Mr. Pedgift the elder expressed but one feeling when he\r\nhad read the letter in his turn and had handed it back--a feeling of\r\nprofound admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lawyer she would have made,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed,\r\nfervently, \xe2\x80\x9cif she had only been a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t treat this as lightly as you do, Mr. Pedgift,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s dreadfully distressing to me. I was so fond of her,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in\r\na lower tone--\xe2\x80\x9cI was so fond of her once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pedgift Senior suddenly became serious on his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say, sir, that you actually contemplate seeing Miss\r\nGwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with an expression of genuine dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t treat her cruelly,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been the means of\r\ninjuring her--without intending it, God knows! I can\xe2\x80\x99t treat her cruelly\r\nafter that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou did me the honor, a little while\r\nsince, to say that you considered me your friend. May I presume on that\r\nposition to ask you a question or two, before you go straight to your\r\nown ruin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny questions you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, looking back at the letter--the\r\nonly letter he had ever received from Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have had one trap set for you already, sir, and you have fallen\r\ninto it. Do you want to fall into another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the answer to that question, Mr. Pedgift, as well as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try again, Mr. Armadale; we lawyers are not easily discouraged. Do\r\nyou think that any statement Miss Gwilt might make to you, if you do\r\nsee her, would be a statement to be relied on, after what you and my son\r\ndiscovered in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe might explain what we discovered in London,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Allan, still\r\nlooking at the writing, and thinking of the hand that had traced it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Might_ explain it? My dear sir, she is quite certain to explain it!\r\nI will do her justice: I believe she would make out a case without a\r\nsingle flaw in it from beginning to end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat last answer forced Allan\xe2\x80\x99s attention away from the letter. The\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s pitiless common sense showed him no mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you see that woman again, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Pedgift Senior, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will\r\ncommit the rashest act of folly I ever heard of in all my experience.\r\nShe can have but one object in coming here--to practice on your weakness\r\nfor her. Nobody can say into what false step she may not lead you, if\r\nyou once give her the opportunity. You admit yourself that you have been\r\nfond of her; your attentions to her have been the subject of general\r\nremark; if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually offered her the chance of becoming Mrs.\r\nArmadale, you have done the next thing to it; and knowing all this, you\r\npropose to see her, and to let her work on you with her devilish beauty\r\nand her devilish cleverness, in the character of your interesting\r\nvictim! You, who are one of the best matches in England! You, who are\r\nthe natural prey of all the hungry single women in the community! I\r\nnever heard the like of it; I never, in all my professional experience,\r\nheard the like of it! If you must positively put yourself in a\r\ndangerous position, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Pedgift the elder, with\r\nthe everlasting pinch of snuff held in suspense between his box and his\r\nnose, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a wild-beast show coming to our town next week. Let in\r\nthe tigress, sir; don\xe2\x80\x99t let in Miss Gwilt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the third time Allan looked at his lawyer. And for the third time\r\nhis lawyer looked back at him quite unabashed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to have a very bad opinion of Miss Gwilt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst possible opinion, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Pedgift Senior,\r\ncoolly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will return to that when we have sent the lady\xe2\x80\x99s messenger\r\nabout his business. Will you take my advice? Will you decline to see\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would willingly decline--it would be so dreadfully distressing to\r\nboth of us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI would willingly decline, if I only knew\r\nhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my soul, Mr. Armadale, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough! Don\xe2\x80\x99t commit _you_\r\nyourself in writing. Send out to the messenger, and say there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nanswer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe short course thus suggested was a course which Allan positively\r\ndeclined to take. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s treating her brutally,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t and\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more the pertinacity of Pedgift the elder found its limits, and\r\nonce more that wise man yielded gracefully to a compromise. On receiving\r\nhis client\xe2\x80\x99s promise not to see Miss Gwilt, he consented to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommitting himself in writing under his lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s dictation. The letter\r\nthus produced was modeled in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s own style; it began and ended in\r\none sentence. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale presents his compliments to Miss Gwilt,\r\nand regrets that he cannot have the pleasure of seeing her at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose.\xe2\x80\x9d Allan had pleaded hard for a second sentence, explaining\r\nthat he only declined Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s request from a conviction that an\r\ninterview would be needlessly distressing on both sides. But his legal\r\nadviser firmly rejected the proposed addition to the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\r\nsay No to a woman, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pedgift Senior, \xe2\x80\x9calways say it in one\r\nword. If you give her your reasons, she invariably believes that you\r\nmean Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProducing that little gem of wisdom from the rich mine of his\r\nprofessional experience, Mr. Pedgift the elder sent out the answer to\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s messenger, and recommended the servant to \xe2\x80\x9csee the fellow,\r\nwhoever he was, well clear of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will come back, if you like, to my\r\nopinion of Miss Gwilt. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t at all agree with yours, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\r\nYou think her an object of pity--quite natural at your age. I think her\r\nan object for the inside of a prison--quite natural at mine. You shall\r\nhear the grounds on which I have formed my opinion directly. Let me show\r\nyou that I am in earnest by putting the opinion itself, in the first\r\nplace, to a practical test. Do you think Miss Gwilt is likely to persist\r\nin paying you a visit, Mr. Armadale, after the answer you have just sent\r\nto her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt is a lady; after\r\nthe letter I have sent to her, she will never come near me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere we join issue, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pedgift Senior. \xe2\x80\x9cI say she will snap\r\nher fingers at your letter (which was one of the reasons why I objected\r\nto your writing it). I say, she is in all probability waiting her\r\nmessenger\xe2\x80\x99s return, in or near your grounds at this moment. I say, she\r\nwill try to force her way in here, before four-and-twenty hours more\r\nare over your head. Egad, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Pedgift, looking at his watch,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s only seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock now. She\xe2\x80\x99s bold enough and clever enough\r\nto catch you unawares this very evening. Permit me to ring for the\r\nservant--permit me to request that you will give him orders immediately\r\nto say you are not at home. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate, Mr. Armadale! If\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re right about Miss Gwilt, it\xe2\x80\x99s a mere formality. If I\xe2\x80\x99m right, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na wise precaution. Back your opinion, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pedgift, ringing\r\nthe bell; \xe2\x80\x9cI back mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan was sufficiently nettled when the bell rang to feel ready to\r\ngive the order. But when the servant came in, past remembrances got the\r\nbetter of him, and the words stuck in his throat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou give the order,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said to Mr. Pedgift, and walked away abruptly to the window.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a good fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the old lawyer, looking after him, and\r\npenetrating his motive on the instant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe claws of that she-devil\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t scratch you if I can help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant waited inexorably for his orders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Miss Gwilt calls here, either this evening, or at any other time,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Pedgift Senior, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale is not at home. Wait! If she asks\r\nwhen Mr. Armadale will be back, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Wait! If she proposes\r\ncoming in and sitting down, you have a general order that nobody is to\r\ncome in and sit down unless they have a previous appointment with Mr.\r\nArmadale. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d cried old Pedgift, rubbing his hands cheerfully when\r\nthe servant had left the room, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve stopped her out now, at any\r\nrate! The orders are all given, Mr. Armadale. We may go on with our\r\nconversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan came back from the window. \xe2\x80\x9cThe conversation is not a very\r\npleasant one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo offense to you, but I wish it was over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will get it over as soon as possible, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift Senior,\r\nstill persisting, as only lawyers and women _can_ persist, in forcing\r\nhis way little by little nearer and nearer to his own object. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go\r\nback, if you please, to the practical suggestion which I offered to you\r\nwhen the servant came in with Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s note. There is, I repeat,\r\nonly one way left for you, Mr. Armadale, out of your present awkward\r\nposition. You must pursue your inquiries about this woman to an end--on\r\nthe chance (which I consider next to a certainty) that the end will\r\njustify you in the estimation of the neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to God I had never made any inquiries at all!\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing will induce me, Mr. Pedgift, to make any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you ask me why,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Allan, hotly, \xe2\x80\x9cafter your son has told\r\nyou what we found out in London? Even if I had less cause to be--to be\r\nsorry for Miss Gwilt than I have; even if it was some other woman, do\r\nyou think I would inquire any further into the secret of a poor betrayed\r\ncreature--much less expose it to the neighborhood? I should think myself\r\nas great a scoundrel as the man who has cast her out helpless on the\r\nworld, if I did anything of the kind. I wonder you can ask me the\r\nquestion--upon my soul, I wonder you can ask me the question!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand, Mr. Armadale!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pedgift Senior, warmly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhonor you for being so angry with me. The neighborhood may say what it\r\npleases; you\xe2\x80\x99re a gentleman, sir, in the best sense of the word. Now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n pursued the lawyer, dropping Allan\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and lapsing back instantly\r\nfrom sentiment to business, \xe2\x80\x9cjust hear what I have got to say in my own\r\ndefense. Suppose Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s real position happens to be nothing like\r\nwhat you are generously determined to believe it to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no reason to suppose that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, resolutely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch is your opinion, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Pedgift. \xe2\x80\x9cMine, founded on what\r\nis publicly known of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings here, and on what I have\r\nseen of Miss Gwilt herself, is that she is as far as I am from being\r\nthe sentimental victim you are inclined to make her out. Gently, Mr.\r\nArmadale! remember that I have put my opinion to a practical test, and\r\nwait to condemn it off-hand until events have justified you. Let me put\r\nmy points, sir--make allowances for me as a lawyer--and let me put\r\nmy points. You and my son are young men; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that the\r\ncircumstances, on the surface, appear to justify the interpretation\r\nwhich, as young men, you have placed on them. I am an old man--I know\r\nthat circumstances are not always to be taken as they appear on the\r\nsurface--and I possess the great advantage, in the present case, of\r\nhaving had years of professional experience among some of the wickedest\r\nwomen who ever walked this earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan opened his lips to protest, and checked himself, in despair\r\nof producing the slightest effect. Pedgift Senior bowed in polite\r\nacknowledgment of his client\xe2\x80\x99s self-restraint, and took instant\r\nadvantage of it to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9csince your unfortunate\r\ncorrespondence with the major show me that she is an old hand at deceit.\r\nThe moment she is threatened with exposure--exposure of some kind, there\r\ncan be no doubt, after what you discovered in London--she turns your\r\nhonorable silence to the best possible account, and leaves the major\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice in the character of a martyr. Once out of the house, what does\r\nshe do next? She boldly stops in the neighborhood, and serves three\r\nexcellent purposes by doing so. In the first place, she shows everybody\r\nthat she is not afraid of facing another attack on her reputation. In\r\nthe second place, she is close at hand to twist you round her little\r\nfinger, and to become Mrs. Armadale in spite of circumstances, if you\r\n(and I) allow her the opportunity. In the third place, if you (and I)\r\nare wise enough to distrust her, she is equally wise on her side, and\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t give us the first great chance of following her to London, and\r\nassociating her with her accomplices. Is this the conduct of an unhappy\r\nwoman who has lost her character in a moment of weakness, and who has\r\nbeen driven unwillingly into a deception to get it back again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou put it cleverly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, answering with marked reluctance; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t deny that you put it cleverly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour own common sense, Mr. Armadale, is beginning to tell you that I\r\nput it justly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift Senior. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t presume to say yet what\r\nthis woman\xe2\x80\x99s connection may be with those people at Pimlico. All I\r\nassert is that it is not the connection you suppose. Having stated the\r\nfacts so far, I have only to add my own personal impression of Miss\r\nGwilt. I won\xe2\x80\x99t shock you, if I can help it; I\xe2\x80\x99ll try if I can\xe2\x80\x99t put it\r\ncleverly again. She came to my office (as I told you in my letter), no\r\ndoubt to make friends with your lawyer, if she could; she came to tell\r\nme, in the most forgiving and Christian manner, that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t blame\r\n_you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you ever believe in anybody, Mr. Pedgift?\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pedgift the elder, as unabashed as\r\never. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe as often as a lawyer can. To proceed, sir. When I\r\nwas in the criminal branch of practice, it fell to my lot to take\r\ninstructions for the defense of women committed for trial from the\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s own lips. Whatever other difference there might be among them,\r\nI got, in time, to notice, among those who were particularly wicked and\r\nunquestionably guilty, one point in which they all resembled each other.\r\nTall and short, old and young, handsome and ugly, they all had a secret\r\nself-possession that nothing could shake. On the surface they were as\r\ndifferent as possible. Some of them were in a state of indignation;\r\nsome of them were drowned in tears; some of them were full of pious\r\nconfidence; and some of them were resolved to commit suicide before the\r\nnight was out. But only put your finger suddenly on the weak point in\r\nthe story told by any one of them, and there was an end of her rage, or\r\nher tears, or her piety, or her despair; and out came the genuine woman,\r\nin full possession of all her resources with a neat little lie that\r\nexactly suited the circumstances of the case. Miss Gwilt was in tears,\r\nsir--becoming tears that didn\xe2\x80\x99t make her nose red--and I put my finger\r\nsuddenly on the weak point in _her_ story. Down dropped her pathetic\r\npocket-handkerchief from her beautiful blue eyes, and out came\r\nthe genuine woman with the neat little lie that exactly suited the\r\ncircumstances! I felt twenty years younger, Mr. Armadale, on the spot. I\r\ndeclare I thought I was in Newgate again, with my note-book in my hand,\r\ntaking my instructions for the defense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll say, Mr. Pedgift,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, angrily, \xe2\x80\x9cis that\r\nMiss Gwilt has been in prison!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Senior calmly rapped his snuff-box, and had his answer ready at\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may have richly deserved to see the inside of a prison, Mr.\r\nArmadale; but, in the age we live in, that is one excellent reason\r\nfor her never having been near any place of the kind. A prison, in the\r\npresent tender state of public feeling, for a charming woman like Miss\r\nGwilt! My dear sir, if she had attempted to murder you or me, and if an\r\ninhuman judge and jury had decided on sending her to a prison, the first\r\nobject of modern society would be to prevent her going into it; and, if\r\nthat couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be done, the next object would be to let her out again as\r\nsoon as possible. Read your newspaper, Mr. Armadale, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find we\r\nlive in piping times for the black sheep of the community--if they are\r\nonly black enough. I insist on asserting, sir, that we have got one of\r\nthe blackest of the lot to deal with in this case. I insist on asserting\r\nthat you have had the rare luck, in these unfortunate inquiries, to\r\npitch on a woman who happens to be a fit object for inquiry, in the\r\ninterests of the public protection. Differ with me as strongly as you\r\nplease, but don\xe2\x80\x99t make up your mind finally about Miss Gwilt until\r\nevents have put those two opposite opinions of ours to the test that I\r\nhave proposed. A fairer test there can\xe2\x80\x99t be. I agree with you that no\r\nlady worthy of the name could attempt to force her way in here, after\r\nreceiving your letter. But I deny that Miss Gwilt is worthy of the name;\r\nand I say she will try to force her way in here in spite of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I say she won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Allan, firmly.\r\n\r\nPedgift Senior leaned back in his chair and smiled. There was a\r\nmomentary silence, and in that silence the door-bell rang.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer and the client both looked expectantly in the direction of\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, more angrily than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pedgift Senior, contradicting him with the utmost\r\npoliteness.\r\n\r\nThey waited the event. The opening of the house door was audible, but\r\nthe room was too far from it for the sound of voices to reach the ear as\r\nwell. After a long interval of expectation, the closing of the door was\r\nheard at last. Allan rose impetuously and rang the bell. Mr. Pedgift the\r\nelder sat sublimely calm, and enjoyed, with a gentle zest, the largest\r\npinch of snuff he had taken yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnybody for me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan, when the servant came in.\r\n\r\nThe man looked at Pedgift Senior, with an expression of unutterable\r\nreverence, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to crow over you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pedgift the elder, when\r\nthe servant had withdrawn. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you think of Miss Gwilt _now_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan shook his head in silent discouragement and distress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime is of some importance, Mr. Armadale. After what has just happened,\r\ndo you still object to taking the course I have had the honor of\r\nsuggesting to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t, Mr. Pedgift,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be the means of disgracing\r\nher in the neighborhood. I would rather be disgraced myself--as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me put it in another way, sir. Excuse my persisting. You have been\r\nvery kind to me and my family; and I have a personal interest, as well\r\nas a professional interest, in you. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t prevail on yourself\r\nto show this woman\xe2\x80\x99s character in its true light, will you take common\r\nprecautions to prevent her doing any more harm? Will you consent\r\nto having her privately watched as long as she remains in this\r\nneighborhood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the second time Allan shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that your final resolution, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, Mr. Pedgift; but I am much obliged to you for your advice, all\r\nthe same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Senior rose in a state of gentle resignation, and took up his\r\nhat \xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and made sorrowfully for the door.\r\nAllan rose on his side, innocently supposing that the interview was\r\nat an end. Persons better acquainted with the diplomatic habits of his\r\nlegal adviser would have recommended him to keep his seat. The time was\r\nripe for \xe2\x80\x9cPedgift\xe2\x80\x99s postscript,\xe2\x80\x9d and the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s indicative snuff-box\r\nwas at that moment in one of his hands, as he opened the door with the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan.\r\n\r\nPedgift Senior opened the door, stopped, considered, closed the door\r\nagain, came back mysteriously with his pinch of snuff in suspense\r\nbetween his box and his nose, and repeating his invariable formula,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-by, there\xe2\x80\x99s a point occurs to me,\xe2\x80\x9d quietly resumed possession of\r\nhis empty chair.\r\n\r\nAllan, wondering, took the seat, in his turn, which he had just left.\r\nLawyer and client looked at each other once more, and the inexhaustible\r\ninterview began again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. PEDGIFT\xe2\x80\x99S POSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mentioned that a point had occurred to me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pedgift\r\nSenior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to hear what it is, Mr. Armadale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart, sir! This is the point. I attach considerable\r\nimportance--if nothing else can be done--to having Miss Gwilt privately\r\nlooked after, as long as she stops at Thorpe Ambrose. It struck me just\r\nnow at the door, Mr. Armadale, that what you are not willing to do\r\nfor your own security, you might be willing to do for the security of\r\nanother person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat other person?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young lady who is a near neighbor of yours, sir. Shall I mention the\r\nname in confidence? Miss Milroy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan started, and changed color.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Milroy!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cCan _she_ be concerned in this miserable\r\nbusiness? I hope not, Mr. Pedgift; I sincerely hope not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI paid a visit, in your interests, sir, at the cottage this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n proceeded Pedgift Senior. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear what happened there, and judge\r\nfor yourself. Major Milroy has been expressing his opinion of you pretty\r\nfreely; and I thought it highly desirable to give him a caution. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways the way with those quiet addle-headed men: when they do once wake\r\nup, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reasoning with their obstinacy, and no quieting their\r\nviolence. Well, sir, this morning I went to the cottage. The major\r\nand Miss Neelie were both in the parlor--miss not looking so pretty\r\nas usual; pale, I thought, pale, and worn, and anxious. Up jumps the\r\naddle-headed major (I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give _that_, Mr. Armadale, for the\r\nbrains of a man who can occupy himself for half his lifetime in making\r\na clock!)--up jumps the addle-headed major, in the loftiest manner, and\r\nactually tries to look me down. Ha! ha! the idea of anybody looking _me_\r\ndown, at my time of life. I behaved like a Christian; I nodded kindly to\r\nold What\xe2\x80\x99s-o\xe2\x80\x99clock \xe2\x80\x98Fine morning, major,\xe2\x80\x99 says I. \xe2\x80\x98Have you any business\r\nwith me?\xe2\x80\x99 says he. \xe2\x80\x98Just a word,\xe2\x80\x99 says I. Miss Neelie, like the sensible\r\ngirl she is, gets up to leave the room; and what does her ridiculous\r\nfather do? He stops her. \xe2\x80\x98You needn\xe2\x80\x99t go, my dear, I have nothing to\r\nsay to Mr. Pedgift,\xe2\x80\x99 says this old military idiot, and turns my way, and\r\ntries to look me down again. \xe2\x80\x98You are Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 says he;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98if you come on any business relating to Mr. Armadale, I refer you to my\r\nsolicitor.\xe2\x80\x99 (His solicitor is Darch; and Darch has had enough of _me_ in\r\nbusiness, I can tell you!) \xe2\x80\x98My errand here, major, does certainly relate\r\nto Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concern your lawyer--at any\r\nrate, just yet. I wish to caution you to suspend your opinion of my\r\nclient, or, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t do that, to be careful how you express it in\r\npublic. I warn you that our turn is to come, and that you are not at the\r\nend yet of this scandal about Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x99 It struck me as likely that\r\nhe would lose his temper when he found himself tackled in that way,\r\nand he amply fulfilled my expectations. He was quite violent in his\r\nlanguage--the poor weak creature--actually violent with _me_! I behaved\r\nlike a Christian again; I nodded kindly, and wished him good-morning.\r\nWhen I looked round to wish Miss Neelie good-morning, too, she was gone.\r\nYou seem restless, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pedgift Senior, as Allan,\r\nfeeling the sting of old recollections, suddenly started out of his\r\nchair, and began pacing up and down the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t try your patience\r\nmuch longer, sir; I am coming to the point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr. Pedgift,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, returning to his seat, and\r\ntrying to look composedly at the lawyer through the intervening image of\r\nNeelie which the lawyer had called up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, I left the cottage,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Pedgift Senior. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as I\r\nturned the corner from the garden into the park, whom should I stumble\r\non but Miss Neelie herself, evidently on the lookout for me. \xe2\x80\x98I want to\r\nspeak to you for one moment, Mr. Pedgift!\xe2\x80\x99 says she. \xe2\x80\x98Does Mr. Armadale\r\nthink _me_ mixed up in this matter?\xe2\x80\x99 She was violently agitated--tears\r\nin her eyes, sir, of the sort which my legal experience has _not_\r\naccustomed me to see. I quite forgot myself; I actually gave her my arm,\r\nand led her away gently among the trees. (A nice position to find me in,\r\nif any of the scandal-mongers of the town had happened to be walking in\r\nthat direction!) \xe2\x80\x98My dear Miss Milroy,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98why should Mr. Armadale\r\nthink _you_ mixed up in it?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have told her at once that I thought nothing of the kind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n exclaimed Allan, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you leave her a moment in doubt\r\nabout it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am a lawyer, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Pedgift Senior, dryly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven in moments of sentiment, under convenient trees, with a pretty\r\ngirl on my arm, I can\xe2\x80\x99t entirely divest myself of my professional\r\ncaution. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look distressed, sir, pray! I set things right in due\r\ncourse of time. Before I left Miss Milroy, I told her, in the plainest\r\nterms, no such idea had ever entered your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she seem relieved?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was able to dispense with the use of my arm, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied old\r\nPedgift, as dryly as ever, \xe2\x80\x9cand to pledge me to inviolable secrecy on\r\nthe subject of our interview. She was particularly desirous that _you_\r\nshould hear nothing about it. If you are at all anxious on your side to\r\nknow why I am now betraying her confidence, I beg to inform you that\r\nher confidence related to no less a person than the lady who favored you\r\nwith a call just now--Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan, who had been once more restlessly pacing the room, stopped, and\r\nreturned to his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this serious?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost serious, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pedgift Senior. \xe2\x80\x9cI am betraying Miss\r\nNeelie\xe2\x80\x99s secret, in Miss Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s own interest. Let us go back to that\r\ncautious question I put to her. She found some little difficulty in\r\nanswering it, for the reply involved her in a narrative of the parting\r\ninterview between her governess and herself. This is the substance of\r\nit. The two were alone when Miss Gwilt took leave of her pupil; and the\r\nwords she used (as reported to me by Miss Neelie) were these. She said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your mother has declined to allow me to take leave of her. Do you\r\ndecline too?\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s answer was a remarkably sensible one for\r\na girl of her age. \xe2\x80\x98We have not been good friends,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and I\r\nbelieve we are equally glad to part with each other. But I have no wish\r\nto decline taking leave of you.\xe2\x80\x99 Saying that, she held out her hand.\r\nMiss Gwilt stood looking at her steadily, without taking it, and\r\naddressed her in these words: \xe2\x80\x98_You are not Mrs. Armadale yet_.\xe2\x80\x99 Gently,\r\nsir! Keep your temper. It\xe2\x80\x99s not at all wonderful that a woman, conscious\r\nof having her own mercenary designs on you, should attribute similar\r\ndesigns to a young lady who happens to be your near neighbor. Let me go\r\non. Miss Neelie, by her own confession (and quite naturally, I think),\r\nwas excessively indignant. She owns to having answered, \xe2\x80\x98You shameless\r\ncreature, how dare you say that to me!\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s rejoinder was\r\nrather a remarkable one--the anger, on her side, appears to have been\r\nof the cool, still, venomous kind. \xe2\x80\x98Nobody ever yet injured me, Miss\r\nMilroy,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98without sooner or later bitterly repenting it. _You_\r\nwill bitterly repent it.\xe2\x80\x99 She stood looking at her pupil for a moment in\r\ndead silence, and then left the room. Miss Neelie appears to have\r\nfelt the imputation fastened on her, in connection with you, far more\r\nsensitively than she felt the threat. She had previously known, as\r\neverybody had known in the house, that some unacknowledged proceedings\r\nof yours in London had led to Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s voluntary withdrawal from\r\nher situation. And she now inferred, from the language addressed to\r\nher, that she was actually believed by Miss Gwilt to have set those\r\nproceedings on foot, to advance herself, and to injure her governess, in\r\nyour estimation. Gently, sir, gently! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite done yet. As soon\r\nas Miss Neelie had recovered herself, she went upstairs to speak to Mrs.\r\nMilroy. Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s abominable imputation had taken her by surprise;\r\nand she went to her mother first for enlightenment and advice. She got\r\nneither the one nor the other. Mrs. Milroy declared she was too ill to\r\nenter on the subject, and she has remained too ill to enter on it ever\r\nsince. Miss Neelie applied next to her father. The major stopped her the\r\nmoment your name passed her lips: he declared he would never hear you\r\nmentioned again by any member of his family. She has been left in\r\nthe dark from that time to this, not knowing how she might have been\r\nmisrepresented by Miss Gwilt, or what falsehoods you might have been led\r\nto believe of her. At my age and in my profession, I don\xe2\x80\x99t profess to\r\nhave any extraordinary softness of heart. But I do think, Mr. Armadale,\r\nthat Miss Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s position deserves our sympathy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything to help her!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, impulsively. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow, Mr. Pedgift, what reason I have--\xe2\x80\x9d He checked himself, and\r\nconfusedly repeated his first words. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything,\xe2\x80\x9d he reiterated\r\nearnestly--\xe2\x80\x9canything in the world to help her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really mean that, Mr. Armadale? Excuse my asking; but you can\r\nvery materially help Miss Neelie, if you choose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly tell me how!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy giving me your authority, sir, to protect her from Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving fired that shot pointblank at his client, the wise lawyer waited\r\na little to let it take its effect before he said any more.\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s face clouded, and he shifted uneasily from side to side of his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour son is hard enough to deal with, Mr. Pedgift,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nare harder than your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the ready Pedgift, \xe2\x80\x9cin my son\xe2\x80\x99s name and my\r\nown, for a handsome compliment to the firm. If you really wish to be of\r\nassistance to Miss Neelie,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, more seriously, \xe2\x80\x9cI have shown\r\nyou the way. You can do nothing to quiet her anxiety which I have not\r\ndone already. As soon as I had assured her that no misconception of her\r\nconduct existed in your mind, she went away satisfied. Her governess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparting threat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have dwelt on her memory. I can tell you,\r\nMr. Armadale, it dwells on mine! You know my opinion of Miss Gwilt; and\r\nyou know what Miss Gwilt herself has done this very evening to justify\r\nthat opinion even in your eyes. May I ask, after all that has passed,\r\nwhether you think she is the sort of woman who can be trusted to confine\r\nherself to empty threats?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question was a formidable one to answer. Forced steadily back from\r\nthe position which he had occupied at the outset of the interview, by\r\nthe irresistible pressure of plain facts, Allan began for the first time\r\nto show symptoms of yielding on the subject of Miss Gwilt. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there no\r\nother way of protecting Miss Milroy but the way you have mentioned?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked, uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the major would listen to you, sir, if you spoke to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n asked Pedgift Senior, sarcastically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m rather afraid he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhonor _me_ with his attention. Or perhaps you would prefer alarming Miss\r\nNeelie by telling her in plain words that we both think her in danger?\r\nOr, suppose you send me to Miss Gwilt, with instructions to inform her\r\nthat she has done her pupil a cruel injustice? Women are so proverbially\r\nready to listen to reason; and they are so universally disposed to alter\r\ntheir opinions of each other on application--especially when one woman\r\nthinks that another woman has destroyed her prospect of making a good\r\nmarriage. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind _me_, Mr. Armadale; I\xe2\x80\x99m only a lawyer, and I can\r\nsit waterproof under another shower of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s tears!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn it, Mr. Pedgift, tell me in plain words what you want to do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cried Allan, losing his temper at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn plain words, Mr. Armadale, I want to keep Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings\r\nprivately under view, as long as she stops in this neighborhood. I\r\nanswer for finding a person who will look after her delicately\r\nand discreetly. And I agree to discontinue even this harmless\r\nsuperintendence of her actions, if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t good reasons shown for\r\ncontinuing it, to your entire satisfaction, in a week\xe2\x80\x99s time. I make\r\nthat moderate proposal, sir, in what I sincerely believe to be Miss\r\nMilroy\xe2\x80\x99s interest, and I wait your answer, Yes or No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I have time to consider?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan, driven to the last\r\nhelpless expedient of taking refuge in delay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Mr. Armadale. But don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, while you are considering,\r\nthat Miss Milroy is in the habit of walking out alone in your park,\r\ninnocent of all apprehension of danger, and that Miss Gwilt is perfectly\r\nfree to take any advantage of that circumstance that Miss Gwilt\r\npleases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo as you like!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Allan, in despair. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t torment me any longer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPopular prejudice may deny it, but the profession of the law is a\r\npractically Christian profession in one respect at least. Of all\r\nthe large collection of ready answers lying in wait for mankind on\r\na lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s lips, none is kept in better working order than \xe2\x80\x9cthe soft\r\nanswer which turneth away wrath.\xe2\x80\x9d Pedgift Senior rose with the alacrity\r\nof youth in his legs, and the wise moderation of age on his tongue.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany thanks, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the attention you have bestowed on me.\r\nI congratulate you on your decision, and I wish you good-evening.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\ntime his indicative snuff-box was not in his hand when he opened the\r\ndoor, and he actually disappeared without coming back for a second\r\npostscript.\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s head sank on his breast when he was left alone. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it was only\r\nthe end of the week!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, longingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I only had Midwinter\r\nback again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs that aspiration escaped the client\xe2\x80\x99s lips, the lawyer got gayly\r\ninto his gig. \xe2\x80\x9cHie away, old girl!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pedgift Senior, patting\r\nthe fast-trotting mare with the end of his whip. \xe2\x80\x9cI never keep a lady\r\nwaiting--and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got business to-night with one of your own sex!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE MARTYRDOM OF MISS GWILT.\r\n\r\nThe outskirts of the little town of Thorpe Ambrose, on the side nearest\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cthe great house,\xe2\x80\x9d have earned some local celebrity as exhibiting\r\nthe prettiest suburb of the kind to be found in East Norfolk. Here the\r\nvillas and gardens are for the most part built and laid out in excellent\r\ntaste, the trees are in the prime of their growth, and the healthy\r\ncommon beyond the houses rises and falls in picturesque and delightful\r\nvariety of broken ground. The rank, fashion, and beauty of the town make\r\nthis place their evening promenade; and when a stranger goes out for a\r\ndrive, if he leaves it to the coachman, the coachman starts by way of\r\nthe common as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side, that is to say, on the side furthest from \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ngreat house,\xe2\x80\x9d the suburbs (in the year 1851) were universally regarded\r\nas a sore subject by all persons zealous for the reputation of the town.\r\n\r\nHere nature was uninviting, man was poor, and social progress, as\r\nexhibited under the form of building, halted miserably. The streets\r\ndwindled feebly, as they receded from the center of the town, into\r\nsmaller and smaller houses, and died away on the barren open ground into\r\nan atrophy of skeleton cottages. Builders hereabouts appeared to have\r\nuniversally abandoned their work in the first stage of its creation.\r\nLand-holders set up poles on lost patches of ground, and, plaintively\r\nadvertising that they were to let for building, raised sickly little\r\ncrops meanwhile, in despair of finding a purchaser to deal with them.\r\nAll the waste paper of the town seemed to float congenially to this\r\nneglected spot; and all the fretful children came and cried here, in\r\ncharge of all the slatternly nurses who disgraced the place. If there\r\nwas any intention in Thorpe Ambrose of sending a worn-out horse to the\r\nknacker\xe2\x80\x99s, that horse was sure to be found waiting his doom in a field\r\non this side of the town. No growth flourished in these desert regions\r\nbut the arid growth of rubbish; and no creatures rejoiced but the\r\ncreatures of the night--the vermin here and there in the beds, and the\r\ncats everywhere on the tiles.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set, and the summer twilight was darkening. The fretful\r\nchildren were crying in their cradles; the horse destined for the\r\nknacker dozed forlorn in the field of his imprisonment; the cats waited\r\nstealthily in corners for the coming night. But one living figure\r\nappeared in the lonely suburb--the figure of Mr. Bashwood. But one faint\r\nsound disturbed the dreadful silence--the sound of Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s softly\r\nstepping feet.\r\n\r\nMoving slowly past the heaps of bricks rising at intervals along\r\nthe road, coasting carefully round the old iron and the broken tiles\r\nscattered here and there in his path, Mr. Bashwood advanced from the\r\ndirection of the country toward one of the unfinished streets of the\r\nsuburb. His personal appearance had been apparently made the object of\r\nsome special attention. His false teeth were brilliantly white; his\r\nwig was carefully brushed; his mourning garments, renewed throughout,\r\ngleamed with the hideous and slimy gloss of cheap black cloth. He moved\r\nwith a nervous jauntiness, and looked about him with a vacant smile.\r\nHaving reached the first of the skeleton cottages, his watery eyes\r\nsettled steadily for the first time on the view of the street before\r\nhim. The next instant he started; his breath quickened; he leaned,\r\ntrembling and flushing, against the unfinished wall at his side. A lady,\r\nstill at some distance, was advancing toward him down the length of the\r\nstreet. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s coming!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, with a strange mixture of rapture\r\nand fear, of alternating color and paleness, showing itself in his\r\nhaggard face. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I was the ground she treads on! I wish I was\r\nthe glove she\xe2\x80\x99s got on her hand!\xe2\x80\x9d He burst ecstatically into those\r\nextravagant words, with a concentrated intensity of delight in uttering\r\nthem that actually shook his feeble figure from head to foot.\r\n\r\nSmoothly and gracefully the lady glided nearer and nearer, until she\r\nrevealed to Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, what Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s instincts had\r\nrecognized in the first instance--the face of Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed with an exquisitely expressive economy of outlay. The\r\nplainest straw bonnet procurable, trimmed sparingly with the cheapest\r\nwhite ribbon, was on her head. Modest and tasteful poverty expressed\r\nitself in the speckless cleanliness and the modestly proportioned skirts\r\nof her light \xe2\x80\x9cprint\xe2\x80\x9d gown, and in the scanty little mantilla of cheap\r\nblack silk which she wore over it, edged with a simple frilling of\r\nthe same material. The luster of her terrible red hair showed itself\r\nunshrinkingly in a plaited coronet above her forehead, and escaped in\r\none vagrant love-lock, perfectly curled, that dropped over her left\r\nshoulder. Her gloves, fitting her like a second skin, were of the sober\r\nbrown hue which is slowest to show signs of use. One hand lifted her\r\ndress daintily above the impurities of the road; the other held a little\r\nnosegay of the commonest garden flowers. Noiselessly and smoothly she\r\ncame on, with a gentle and regular undulation of the print gown; with\r\nthe love-lock softly lifted from moment to moment in the evening breeze;\r\nwith her head a little drooped, and her eyes on the ground--in walk, and\r\nlook, and manner, in every casual movement that escaped her, expressing\r\nthat subtle mixture of the voluptuous and the modest which, of the many\r\nattractive extremes that meet in women, is in a man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes the most\r\nirresistible of all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bashwood!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, in loud, clear tones indicative of the\r\nutmost astonishment, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a surprise to find you here! I thought none\r\nbut the wretched inhabitants ever ventured near this side of the town.\r\nHush!\xe2\x80\x9d she added quickly, in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cYou heard right when you heard\r\nthat Mr. Armadale was going to have me followed and watched. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na man behind one of the houses. We must talk out loud of indifferent\r\nthings, and look as if we had met by accident. Ask me what I am doing.\r\nOut loud! Directly! You shall never see me again, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t instantly\r\nleave off trembling and do what I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with a merciless tyranny of eye and voice--with a merciless\r\nuse of her power over the feeble creature whom she addressed. Mr.\r\nBashwood obeyed her in tones that quavered with agitation, and with eyes\r\nthat devoured her beauty in a strange fascination of terror and delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am trying to earn a little money by teaching music,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in the\r\nvoice intended to reach the spy\xe2\x80\x99s ears. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are able to recommend me\r\nany pupils, Mr. Bashwood, your good word will oblige me. Have you been\r\nin the grounds to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, dropping her voice again in a\r\nwhisper. \xe2\x80\x9cHas Mr. Armadale been near the cottage? Has Miss Milroy been\r\nout of the garden? No? Are you sure? Look out for them to-morrow, and\r\nnext day, and next day. They are certain to meet and make it up again,\r\nand I must and will know of it. Hush! Ask me my terms for teaching\r\nmusic. What are you frightened about? It\xe2\x80\x99s me the man\xe2\x80\x99s after--not you.\r\nLouder than when you asked me what I was doing, just now; louder, or I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t trust you any more; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to somebody else!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more Mr. Bashwood obeyed. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured,\r\nfaintly, when he had spoken the necessary words. \xe2\x80\x9cMy heart beats so\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll kill me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou poor old dear!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered back, with a sudden change in her\r\nmanner, with an easy satirical tenderness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat business have you with\r\na heart at your age? Be here to-morrow at the same time, and tell me\r\nwhat you have seen in the grounds. My terms are only five shillings a\r\nlesson,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, in her louder tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s not much,\r\nMr. Bashwood; I give such long lessons, and I get all my pupils\xe2\x80\x99 music\r\nhalf-price.\xe2\x80\x9d She suddenly dropped her voice again, and looked him\r\nbrightly into instant subjection. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let Mr. Armadale out of your\r\nsight to-morrow! If that girl manages to speak to him, and if I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear of it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll frighten you to death. If I _do_ hear of it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss\r\nyou! Hush! Wish me good-night, and go on to the town, and leave me to\r\ngo the other way. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you--I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of the man behind the\r\nhouses; I can deal with him by myself. Say goodnight, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you\r\nshake hands. Say it louder, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you one of my flowers, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll promise not to fall in love with it.\xe2\x80\x9d She raised her voice\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cGoodnight, Mr. Bashwood! Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget my terms. Five shillings a\r\nlesson, and the lessons last an hour at a time, and I get all my pupils\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmusic half-price, which is an immense advantage, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d She slipped\r\na flower into his hand--frowned him into obedience, and smiled to reward\r\nhim for obeying, at the same moment--lifted her dress again above the\r\nimpurities of the road--and went on her way with a dainty and indolent\r\ndeliberation, as a cat goes on her way when she has exhausted the\r\nenjoyment of frightening a mouse.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, Mr. Bashwood turned to the low cottage wall near which he\r\nhad been standing, and, resting himself on it wearily, looked at the\r\nflower in his hand.\r\n\r\nHis past existence had disciplined him to bear disaster and insult, as\r\nfew happier men could have borne them; but it had not prepared him to\r\nfeel the master-passion of humanity, for the first time, at the dreary\r\nend of his life, in the hopeless decay of a manhood that had withered\r\nunder the double blight of conjugal disappointment and parental sorrow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if I was only young again!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the poor wretch, resting his\r\narms on the wall and touching the flower with his dry, fevered lips in\r\na stealthy rapture of tenderness. \xe2\x80\x9cShe might have liked me when I was\r\ntwenty!\xe2\x80\x9d He suddenly started back into an erect position, and stared\r\nabout him in vacant bewilderment and terror. \xe2\x80\x9cShe told me to go home,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, with a startled look. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy am I stopping here?\xe2\x80\x9d He turned, and\r\nhurried on to the town--in such dread of her anger, if she looked round\r\nand saw him, that he never so much as ventured on a backward glance at\r\nthe road by which she had retired, and never detected the spy dogging\r\nher footsteps, under cover of the empty houses and the brick-heaps by\r\nthe roadside.\r\n\r\nSmoothly and gracefully, carefully preserving the speckless integrity\r\nof her dress, never hastening her pace, and never looking aside to\r\nthe right hand or the left, Miss Gwilt pursued her way toward the open\r\ncountry. The suburban road branched off at its end in two directions. On\r\nthe left, the path wound through a ragged little coppice to the grazing\r\ngrounds of a neighboring farm; on the right, it led across a hillock\r\nof waste land to the high-road. Stopping a moment to consider, but not\r\nshowing the spy that she suspected him by glancing behind her while\r\nthere was a hiding-place within his reach, Miss Gwilt took the path\r\nacross the hillock. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll catch him there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, looking\r\nup quietly at the long straight line of the empty high-road.\r\n\r\nOnce on the ground that she had chosen for her purpose, she met the\r\ndifficulties of the position with perfect tact and self-possession.\r\nAfter walking some thirty yards along the road, she let her nosegay\r\ndrop, half turned round in stooping to pick it up, saw the man stopping\r\nat the same moment behind her, and instantly went on again, quickening\r\nher pace little by little, until she was walking at the top of her\r\nspeed. The spy fell into the snare laid for him. Seeing the night\r\ncoming, and fearing that he might lose sight of her in the darkness, he\r\nrapidly lessened the distance between them. Miss Gwilt went on faster\r\nand faster till she plainly heard his footstep behind her, then stopped,\r\nturned, and met the man face to face the next moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy compliments to Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell him I\xe2\x80\x99ve caught\r\nyou watching me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not watching you, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the spy, thrown off his guard by\r\nthe daring plainness of the language in which she had spoken to him.\r\n\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s eyes measured him contemptuously from head to foot. He was\r\na weakly, undersized man. She was the taller, and (quite possibly) the\r\nstronger of the two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake your hat off, you blackguard, when you speak to a lady,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nand tossed his hat in an instant, across a ditch by which they were\r\nstanding, into a pool on the other side.\r\n\r\nThis time the spy was on his guard. He knew as well as Miss Gwilt knew\r\nthe use which might be made of the precious minutes, if he turned his\r\nback on her and crossed the ditch to recover his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s well for\r\nyou you\xe2\x80\x99re a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, standing scowling at her bareheaded in the\r\nfast-darkening light.\r\n\r\nMiss Gwilt glanced sidelong down the onward vista of the road, and saw,\r\nthrough the gathering obscurity, the solitary figure of a man rapidly\r\nadvancing toward her. Some women would have noticed the approach of a\r\nstranger at that hour and in that lonely place with a certain anxiety.\r\nMiss Gwilt was too confident in her own powers of persuasion not to\r\ncount on the man\xe2\x80\x99s assistance beforehand, whoever he might be, _because_\r\nhe was a man. She looked back at the spy with redoubled confidence\r\nin herself, and measured him contemptuously from head to foot for the\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether I\xe2\x80\x99m strong enough to throw you after your hat?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take a turn and consider it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sauntered on a few steps toward the figure advancing along the road.\r\nThe spy followed her close. \xe2\x80\x9cTry it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, brutally. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a fine\r\nwoman; you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to put your arms round me if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d As the\r\nwords escaped him, he too saw the stranger for the first time. He drew\r\nback a step and waited. Miss Gwilt, on her side, advanced a step and\r\nwaited, too.\r\n\r\nThe stranger came on, with the lithe, light step of a practiced walker,\r\nswinging a stick in his hand and carrying a knapsack on his shoulders.\r\nA few paces nearer, and his face became visible. He was a dark man,\r\nhis black hair was powdered with dust, and his black eyes were looking\r\nsteadfastly forward along the road before him.\r\n\r\nMiss Gwilt advanced with the first signs of agitation she had shown yet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, softly. \xe2\x80\x9cCan it really be you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Midwinter, on his way back to Thorpe Ambrose, after his fortnight\r\namong the Yorkshire moors.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and looked at her, in breathless surprise. The image of the\r\nwoman had been in his thoughts, at the moment when the woman herself\r\nspoke to him. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, and mechanically held out his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nShe took it, and pressed it gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have been glad to see you\r\nat any time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how glad I am to see you now.\r\nMay I trouble you to speak to that man? He has been following me, and\r\nannoying me all the way from the town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter stepped past her without uttering a word. Faint as the light\r\nwas, the spy saw what was coming in his face, and, turning instantly,\r\nleaped the ditch by the road-side. Before Midwinter could follow, Miss\r\nGwilt\xe2\x80\x99s hand was on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know who his employer is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter stopped and looked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange things have happened since you left us,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nbeen forced to give up my situation, and I am followed and watched by a\r\npaid spy. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask who forced me out of my situation, and who pays the\r\nspy--at least not just yet. I can\xe2\x80\x99t make up my mind to tell you till I\r\nam a little more composed. Let the wretch go. Do you mind seeing me\r\nsafe back to my lodging? It\xe2\x80\x99s in your way home. May I--may I ask for the\r\nsupport of your arm? My little stock of courage is quite exhausted.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ntook his arm and clung close to it. The woman who had tyrannized over\r\nMr. Bashwood was gone, and the woman who had tossed the spy\xe2\x80\x99s hat into\r\nthe pool was gone. A timid, shrinking, interesting creature filled the\r\nfair skin and trembled on the symmetrical limbs of Miss Gwilt. She\r\nput her handkerchief to her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say necessity has no law,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmurmured, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am treating you like an old friend. God knows I\r\nwant one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went on toward the town. She recovered herself with a touching\r\nfortitude; she put her handkerchief back in her pocket, and persisted in\r\nturning the conversation on Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s walking tour. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is bad enough\r\nto be a burden on you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gently pressing on his arm as she\r\nspoke; \xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t distress you as well. Tell me where you have been, and\r\nwhat you have seen. Interest me in your journey; help me to escape from\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey reached the modest little lodging in the miserable little suburb.\r\nMiss Gwilt sighed, and removed her glove before she took Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cI have taken refuge here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, simply. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is clean and\r\nquiet; I am too poor to want or expect more. We must say good-by, I\r\nsuppose, unless\xe2\x80\x9d--she hesitated modestly, and satisfied herself by a\r\nquick look round that they were unobserved--\xe2\x80\x9cunless you would like\r\nto come in and rest a little? I feel so gratefully toward you, Mr.\r\nMidwinter! Is there any harm, do you think, in my offering you a cup of\r\ntea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe magnetic influence of her touch was thrilling through him while she\r\nspoke. Change and absence, to which he had trusted to weaken her hold\r\non him, had treacherously strengthened it instead. A man exceptionally\r\nsensitive, a man exceptionally pure in his past life, he stood hand in\r\nhand, in the tempting secrecy of the night, with the first woman who had\r\nexercised over him the all-absorbing influence of her sex. At his age,\r\nand in his position, who could have left her? The man (with a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntemperament) doesn\xe2\x80\x99t live who could have left her. Midwinter went in.\r\n\r\nA stupid, sleepy lad opened the house door. Even he, being a male\r\ncreature, brightened under the influence of Miss Gwilt. \xe2\x80\x9cThe urn, John,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cand another cup and saucer. I\xe2\x80\x99ll borrow your candle\r\nto light my candles upstairs, and then I won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you any more\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d John was wakeful and active in an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cNo trouble,\r\nmiss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with awkward civility. Miss Gwilt took his candle with\r\na smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHow good people are to me!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, innocently, to\r\nMidwinter, as she led the way upstairs to the little drawing-room on the\r\nfirst floor.\r\n\r\nShe lit the candles, and, turning quickly on her guest, stopped him at\r\nthe first attempt he made to remove the knapsack from his shoulders.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gently; \xe2\x80\x9cin the good old times there were occasions when\r\nthe ladies unarmed their knights. I claim the privilege of unarming\r\n_my_ knight.\xe2\x80\x9d Her dexterous fingers intercepted his at the straps and\r\nbuckles, and she had the dusty knapsack off, before he could protest\r\nagainst her touching it.\r\n\r\nThey sat down at the one little table in the room. It was very poorly\r\nfurnished; but there was something of the dainty neatness of the woman\r\nwho inhabited it in the arrangement of the few poor ornaments on\r\nthe chimney-piece, in the one or two prettily bound volumes on\r\nthe chiffonier, in the flowers on the table, and the modest little\r\nwork-basket in the window. \xe2\x80\x9cWomen are not all coquettes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nas she took off her bonnet and mantilla, and laid them carefully on a\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t go into my room, and look in my glass, and make myself\r\nsmart; you shall take me just as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d Her hands moved about among the\r\ntea-things with a smooth, noiseless activity.\r\n\r\nHer magnificent hair flashed crimson in the candle-light, as she turned\r\nher head hither and thither, searching with an easy grace for the things\r\nshe wanted in the tray. Exercise had heightened the brilliancy of her\r\ncomplexion, and had quickened the rapid alternations of expression\r\nin her eyes--the delicious languor that stole over them when she was\r\nlistening or thinking, the bright intelligence that flashed from them\r\nsoftly when she spoke. In the lightest word she said, in the least thing\r\nshe did, there was something that gently solicited the heart of the\r\nman who sat with her. Perfectly modest in her manner, possessed to\r\nperfection of the graceful restraints and refinements of a lady, she had\r\nall the allurements that feast the eye, all the siren invitations that\r\nseduce the sense--a subtle suggestiveness in her silence, and a sexual\r\nsorcery in her smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould I be wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, suddenly suspending the conversation\r\nwhich she had thus far persistently restricted to the subject of\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s walking tour, \xe2\x80\x9cif I guessed that you have something on your\r\nmind--something which neither my tea nor my talk can charm away? Are men\r\nas curious as women? Is the something--Me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter struggled against the fascination of looking at her and\r\nlistening to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very anxious to hear what has happened since I\r\nhave been away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am still more anxious, Miss Gwilt, not\r\nto distress you by speaking of a painful subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him gratefully. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is for your sake that I have avoided\r\nthe painful subject,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, toying with her spoon among the dregs\r\nin her empty cup. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you will hear about it from others, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear about it from me; and you ought to know why you found me in that\r\nstrange situation, and why you see me here. Pray remember one thing, to\r\nbegin with. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame your friend, Mr. Armadale. I blame the people\r\nwhose instrument he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter started. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Allan can be in\r\nany way answerable--?\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, and looked at Miss Gwilt in silent\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nShe gently laid her hand on his. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me for only\r\ntelling the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour friend is answerable for everything\r\nthat has happened to me--innocently answerable, Mr. Midwinter, I firmly\r\nbelieve. We are both victims. _He_ is the victim of his position as\r\nthe richest single man in the neighborhood; and I am the victim of Miss\r\nMilroy\xe2\x80\x99s determination to marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Milroy?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Midwinter, more and more astonished. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Allan\r\nhimself told me--\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told you that I was the object of his admiration? Poor fellow,\r\nhe admires everybody; his head is almost as empty as this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nGwilt, smiling indicatively into the hollow of her cup. She dropped the\r\nspoon, sighed, and became serious again. \xe2\x80\x9cI am guilty of the vanity of\r\nhaving let him admire me,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, penitently, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout the excuse\r\nof being able, on my side, to reciprocate even the passing interest that\r\nhe felt in me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t undervalue his many admirable qualities, or the\r\nexcellent position he can offer to his wife. But a woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart is not\r\nto be commanded--no, Mr. Midwinter, not even by the fortunate master of\r\nThorpe Ambrose, who commands everything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked him full in the face as she uttered that magnanimous\r\nsentiment. His eyes dropped before hers, and his dark color deepened. He\r\nhad felt his heart leap in him at the declaration of her indifference to\r\nAllan. For the first time since they had known each other, his interests\r\nnow stood self-revealed before him as openly adverse to the interests of\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been guilty of the vanity of letting Mr. Armadale admire me,\r\nand I have suffered for it,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Miss Gwilt. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there had been any\r\nconfidence between my pupil and me, I might have easily satisfied her\r\nthat she might become Mrs. Armadale--if she could--without having any\r\nrivalry to fear on my part. But Miss Milroy disliked and distrusted\r\nme from the first. She took her own jealous view, no doubt, of Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s thoughtless attentions to me. It was her interest to destroy\r\nthe position, such as it was, that I held in his estimation; and it is\r\nquite likely her mother assisted her. Mrs. Milroy had her motive also\r\n(which I am really ashamed to mention) for wishing to drive me out of\r\nthe house. Anyhow, the conspiracy has succeeded. I have been forced\r\n(with Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s help) to leave the major\xe2\x80\x99s service. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry,\r\nMr. Midwinter! Don\xe2\x80\x99t form a hasty opinion! I dare say Miss Milroy has\r\nsome good qualities, though I have not found them out; and I assure you\r\nagain and again that I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame Mr. Armadale. I only blame the people\r\nwhose instrument he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is he their instrument? How can he be the instrument of any enemy\r\nof yours?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cPray excuse my anxiety, Miss Gwilt: Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood name is as dear to me as my own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned full on him again, and Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nabandoned itself innocently to an outburst of enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I admire\r\nyour earnestness!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I like your anxiety for your friend!\r\nOh, if women could only form such friendships! Oh you happy, happy men!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Her voice faltered, and her convenient tea-cup absorbed her for the\r\nthird time. \xe2\x80\x9cI would give all the little beauty I possess,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif I could only find such a friend as Mr. Armadale has found in _you_.\r\nI never shall, Mr. Midwinter--I never shall. Let us go back to what we\r\nwere talking about. I can only tell you how your friend is concerned\r\nin my misfortune by telling you something first about myself. I am like\r\nmany other governesses; I am the victim of sad domestic circumstances.\r\nIt may be weak of me, but I have a horror of alluding to them among\r\nstrangers. My silence about my family and my friends exposes me to\r\nmisinterpretation in my dependent position. Does it do me any harm, Mr.\r\nMidwinter, in your estimation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, fervently. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no man living,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on, thinking of his own family story, \xe2\x80\x9cwho has better reason to\r\nunderstand and respect your silence than I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gwilt seized his hand impulsively. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it, the\r\nfirst moment I saw you! I knew that you, too, had suffered; that you,\r\ntoo, had sorrows which you kept sacred! Strange, strange sympathy! I\r\nbelieve in mesmerism--do you?\xe2\x80\x9d She suddenly recollected herself, and\r\nshuddered. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what have I done? What must you think of me?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed, as he yielded to the magnetic fascination of her touch, and,\r\nforgetting everything but the hand that lay warm in his own, bent over\r\nit and kissed it. \xe2\x80\x9cSpare me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly, as she felt the burning\r\ntouch of his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so friendless--I am so completely at your\r\nmercy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned away from her, and hid his face in his hands; he was\r\ntrembling, and she saw it. She looked at him while his face was hidden\r\nfrom her; she looked at him with a furtive interest and surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nthat man loves me!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether there was a time when\r\nI might have loved _him_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe silence between them remained unbroken for some minutes. He had felt\r\nher appeal to his consideration as she had never expected or intended\r\nhim to feel it--he shrank from looking at her or from speaking to her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go on with my story?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we forget and forgive\r\non both sides?\xe2\x80\x9d A woman\xe2\x80\x99s inveterate indulgence for every expression\r\nof a man\xe2\x80\x99s admiration which keeps within the limits of personal\r\nrespect curved her lips gently into a charming smile. She looked down\r\nmeditatively at her dress, and brushed a crumb off her lap with a little\r\nflattering sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI was telling you,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cof my reluctance\r\nto speak to strangers of my sad family story. It was in that way, as I\r\nafterward found out, that I laid myself open to Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s malice and\r\nMiss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion. Private inquiries about me were addressed to\r\nthe lady who was my reference--at Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, in the first\r\ninstance, I have no doubt. I am sorry to say, this is not the worst\r\nof it. By some underhand means, of which I am quite ignorant, Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s simplicity was imposed on; and, when application was made\r\nsecretly to my reference in London, it was made, Mr. Midwinter, through\r\nyour friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter suddenly rose from his chair and looked at her. The\r\nfascination that she exercised over him, powerful as it was, became a\r\nsuspended influence, now that the plain disclosure came plainly at\r\nlast from her lips. He looked at her, and sat down again, like a man\r\nbewildered, without uttering a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember how weak he is,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Miss Gwilt, gently, \xe2\x80\x9cand make\r\nallowances for him as I do. The trifling accident of his failing to find\r\nmy reference at the address given him seems, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine why, to\r\nhave excited Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion. At any rate, he remained in\r\nLondon. What he did there, it is impossible for me to say. I was quite\r\nin the dark; I knew nothing: I distrusted nobody; I was as happy in my\r\nlittle round of duties as I could be with a pupil whose affections I\r\nhad failed to win, when, one morning, to my indescribable astonishment,\r\nMajor Milroy showed me a correspondence between Mr. Armadale and\r\nhimself. He spoke to me in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Poor creature, I make no\r\ncomplaint of her; such affliction as she suffers excuses everything. I\r\nwish I could give you some idea of the letters between Major Milroy and\r\nMr. Armadale; but my head is only a woman\xe2\x80\x99s head, and I was so confused\r\nand distressed at the time! All I can tell you is that Mr. Armadale\r\nchose to preserve silence about his proceedings in London, under\r\ncircumstances which made that silence a reflection on my character. The\r\nmajor was most kind; his confidence in me remained unshaken; but\r\ncould his confidence protect me against his wife\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice and his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s ill-will? Oh, the hardness of women to each other! Oh, the\r\nhumiliation if men only knew some of us as we really are! What could I\r\ndo? I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t defend myself against mere imputations; and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremain in my situation after a slur had been cast on me. My pride\r\n(Heaven help me, I was brought up like a gentlewoman, and I have\r\nsensibilities that are not blunted even yet!)--my pride got the better\r\nof me, and I left my place. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let it distress you, Mr. Midwinter!\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a bright side to the picture. The ladies in the neighborhood\r\nhave overwhelmed me with kindness; I have the prospect of getting pupils\r\nto teach; I am spared the mortification of going back to be a burden on\r\nmy friends. The only complaint I have to make is, I think, a just one.\r\nMr. Armadale has been back at Thorpe Ambrose for some days. I have\r\nentreated him, by letter, to grant me an interview; to tell me what\r\ndreadful suspicions he has of me, and to let me set myself right in his\r\nestimation. Would you believe it? He has declined to see me--under the\r\ninfluence of others, not of his own free will, I am sure! Cruel,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But he has even used me more cruelly still; he persists in\r\nsuspecting me; it is he who is having me watched. Oh, Mr. Midwinter,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t hate me for telling you what you _must_ know! The man you found\r\npersecuting me and frightening me to-night was only earning his money,\r\nafter all, as Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s spy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more Midwinter started to his feet; and this time the thoughts that\r\nwere in him found their way into words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it; I won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nthe man told you that, the man lied. I beg your pardon, Miss Gwilt; I\r\nbeg your pardon from the bottom of my heart. Don\xe2\x80\x99t, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\r\ndoubt _you_; I only say there is some dreadful mistake. I am not sure\r\nthat I understand as I ought all that you have told me. But this last\r\ninfamous meanness of which you think Allan guilty, I _do_ understand.\r\nI swear to you, he is incapable of it! Some scoundrel has been taking\r\nadvantage of him; some scoundrel has been using his name. I\xe2\x80\x99ll prove\r\nit to you, if you will only give me time. Let me go and clear it up at\r\nonce. I can\xe2\x80\x99t rest; I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to think of it; I can\xe2\x80\x99t even enjoy the\r\npleasure of being here. Oh,\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out desperately, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\r\nfeel for me, after what you have said--I feel so for _you_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped in confusion. Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were looking at him again,\r\nand Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s hand had found its way once more into his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the most generous of living men,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, softly. \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nbelieve what you tell me to believe. Go,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in a whisper,\r\nsuddenly releasing his hand, and turning away from him. \xe2\x80\x9cFor both our\r\nsakes, go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis heart beat fast; he looked at her as she dropped into a chair and\r\nput her handkerchief to her eyes. For one moment he hesitated; the next,\r\nhe snatched up his knapsack from the floor, and left her precipitately,\r\nwithout a backward look or a parting word.\r\n\r\nShe rose when the door closed on him. A change came over her the instant\r\nshe was alone. The color faded out of her cheeks; the beauty died out of\r\nher eyes; her face hardened horribly with a silent despair. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s even\r\nbaser work than I bargained for,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto deceive _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d After\r\npacing to and fro in the room for some minutes, she stopped wearily\r\nbefore the glass over the fire-place. \xe2\x80\x9cYou strange creature!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmurmured, leaning her elbows on the mantelpiece, and languidly\r\naddressing the reflection of herself in the glass. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got any\r\nconscience left? And has that man roused it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reflection of her face changed slowly. The color returned to her\r\ncheeks, the delicious languor began to suffuse her eyes again. Her lips\r\nparted gently, and her quickening breath began to dim the surface of\r\nthe glass. She drew back from it, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s absorption in her own\r\nthoughts, with a start of terror. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I doing?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked herself,\r\nin a sudden panic of astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I mad enough to be thinking of\r\nhim in _that_ way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe burst into a mocking laugh, and opened her desk on the table\r\nrecklessly with a bang. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s high time I had some talk with Mother\r\nJezebel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and sat down to write to Mrs. Oldershaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have met with Mr. Midwinter,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, \xe2\x80\x9cunder very lucky\r\ncircumstances; and I have made the most of my opportunity. He has just\r\nleft me for his friend Armadale; and one of two good things will happen\r\nto-morrow. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t quarrel, the doors of Thorpe Ambrose will be\r\nopened to me again at Mr. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s intercession. If they do quarrel,\r\nI shall be the unhappy cause of it, and I shall find my way in for\r\nmyself, on the purely Christian errand of reconciling them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated at the next sentence, wrote the first few words of it,\r\nscratched them out again, and petulantly tore the letter into fragments,\r\nand threw the pen to the other end of the room. Turning quickly on her\r\nchair, she looked at the seat which Midwinter had occupied, her foot\r\nrestlessly tapping the floor, and her handkerchief thrust like a gag\r\nbetween her clinched teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cYoung as you are,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, with her\r\nmind reviving the image of him in the empty chair, \xe2\x80\x9cthere has been\r\nsomething out of the common in _your_ life; and I must and will know\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe house clock struck the hour, and roused her. She sighed, and,\r\nwalking back to the glass, wearily loosened the fastenings of her dress;\r\nwearily removed the studs from the chemisette beneath it, and put them\r\non the chimney-piece. She looked indolently at the reflected beauties of\r\nher neck and bosom, as she unplaited her hair and threw it back in one\r\ngreat mass over her shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cFancy,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cif he saw me now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She turned back to the table, and sighed again as she extinguished one\r\nof the candles and took the other in her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cMidwinter?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as\r\nshe passed through the folding-doors of the room to her bed-chamber. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe in his name, to begin with!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night had advanced by more than an hour before Midwinter was back\r\nagain at the great house.\r\n\r\nTwice, well as the homeward way was known to him, he had strayed out of\r\nthe right road. The events of the evening--the interview with Miss\r\nGwilt herself, after his fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s solitary thinking of her; the\r\nextraordinary change that had taken place in her position since he had\r\nseen her last; and the startling assertion of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s connection with\r\nit--had all conspired to throw his mind into a state of ungovernable\r\nconfusion. The darkness of the cloudy night added to his bewilderment.\r\nEven the familiar gates of Thorpe Ambrose seemed strange to him. When\r\nhe tried to think of it, it was a mystery to him how he had reached the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe front of the house was dark, and closed for the night. Midwinter\r\nwent round to the back. The sound of men\xe2\x80\x99s voices, as he advanced,\r\ncaught his ear. They were soon distinguishable as the voices of the\r\nfirst and second footman, and the subject of conversation between them\r\nwas their master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you an even half-crown he\xe2\x80\x99s driven out of the neighborhood\r\nbefore another week is over his head,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first footman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone!\xe2\x80\x9d said the second. \xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t as easy driven as you think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the other. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be mobbed if he stops here! I\r\ntell you again, he\xe2\x80\x99s not satisfied with the mess he\xe2\x80\x99s got into already.\r\nI know it for certain, he\xe2\x80\x99s having the governess watched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those words, Midwinter mechanically checked himself before he turned\r\nthe corner of the house. His first doubt of the result of his meditated\r\nappeal to Allan ran through him like a sudden chill. The influence\r\nexercised by the voice of public scandal is a force which acts in\r\nopposition to the ordinary law of mechanics. It is strongest, not by\r\nconcentration, but by distribution. To the primary sound we may shut our\r\nears; but the reverberation of it in echoes is irresistible. On his way\r\nback, Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s one desire had been to find Allan up, and to speak to\r\nhim immediately. His one hope now was to gain time to contend with the\r\nnew doubts and to silence the new misgivings; his one present anxiety\r\nwas to hear that Allan had gone to bed. He turned the corner of the\r\nhouse, and presented himself before the men smoking their pipes in the\r\nback garden. As soon as their astonishment allowed them to speak, they\r\noffered to rouse their master. Allan had given his friend up for that\r\nnight, and had gone to bed about half an hour since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my master\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 particular order, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the head-footman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat he was to be told of it if you came back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is _my_ particular request,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Midwinter, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndisturb him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men looked at each other wonderingly, as he took his candle and left\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. SHE COMES BETWEEN THEM.\r\n\r\nAppointed hours for the various domestic events of the day were\r\nthings unknown at Thorpe Ambrose. Irregular in all his habits, Allan\r\naccommodated himself to no stated times (with the solitary exception of\r\ndinner-time) at any hour of the day or night. He retired to rest early\r\nor late, and he rose early or late, exactly as he felt inclined. The\r\nservants were forbidden to call him; and Mrs. Gripper was accustomed\r\nto improvise the breakfast as she best might, from the time when the\r\nkitchen fire was first lighted to the time when the clock stood on the\r\nstroke of noon.\r\n\r\nToward nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the morning after his return Midwinter knocked\r\nat Allan\xe2\x80\x99s door, and on entering the room found it empty. After inquiry\r\namong the servants, it appeared that Allan had risen that morning before\r\nthe man who usually attended on him was up, and that his hot water had\r\nbeen brought to the door by one of the house-maids, who was then still\r\nin ignorance of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s return. Nobody had chanced to see the\r\nmaster, either on the stairs or in the hall; nobody had heard him ring\r\nthe bell for breakfast, as usual. In brief, nobody knew anything about\r\nhim, except what was obviously clear to all--that he was not in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nMidwinter went out under the great portico. He stood at the head of the\r\nflight of steps considering in which direction he should set forth to\r\nlook for his friend. Allan\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected absence added one more to the\r\ndisquieting influences which still perplexed his mind. He was in the\r\nmood in which trifles irritate a man, and fancies are all-powerful to\r\nexalt or depress his spirits.\r\n\r\nThe sky was cloudy; and the wind blew in puffs from the south; there was\r\nevery prospect, to weather-wise eyes, of coming rain. While Midwinter\r\nwas still hesitating, one of the grooms passed him on the drive below.\r\nThe man proved, on being questioned, to be better informed about his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s movements than the servants indoors. He had seen Allan pass the\r\nstables more than an hour since, going out by the back way into the park\r\nwith a nosegay in his hand.\r\n\r\nA nosegay in his hand? The nosegay hung incomprehensibly on Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind as he walked round, on the chance of meeting Allan, to the back\r\nof the house. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does the nosegay mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself, with an\r\nunintelligible sense of irritation, and a petulant kick at a stone that\r\nstood in his way.\r\n\r\nIt meant that Allan had been following his impulses as usual. The one\r\npleasant impression left on his mind after his interview with\r\nPedgift Senior was the impression made by the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s account of his\r\nconversation with Neelie in the park. The anxiety that he should not\r\nmisjudge her, which the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter had so earnestly expressed,\r\nplaced her before Allan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes in an irresistibly attractive\r\ncharacter--the character of the one person among all his neighbors who\r\nhad some respect still left for his good opinion. Acutely sensible\r\nof his social isolation, now that there was no Midwinter to keep him\r\ncompany in the empty house, hungering and thirsting in his solitude\r\nfor a kind word and a friendly look, he began to think more and more\r\nregretfully and more and more longingly of the bright young face so\r\npleasantly associated with his first happiest days at Thorpe Ambrose.\r\nTo be conscious of such a feeling as this was, with a character like\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s, to act on it headlong, lead him where it might. He had gone\r\nout on the previous morning to look for Neelie with a peace-offering of\r\nflowers, but with no very distinct idea of what he should say to her if\r\nthey met; and failing to find her on the scene of her customary walks,\r\nhe had characteristically persisted the next morning in making a second\r\nattempt with another peace-offering on a larger scale. Still ignorant\r\nof his friend\xe2\x80\x99s return, he was now at some distance from the house,\r\nsearching the park in a direction which he had not tried yet.\r\n\r\nAfter walking out a few hundred yards beyond the stables, and failing\r\nto discover any signs of Allan, Midwinter retraced his steps, and waited\r\nfor his friend\xe2\x80\x99s return, pacing slowly to and fro on the little strip of\r\ngarden ground at the back of the house.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, as he passed it, he looked in absently at the room\r\nwhich had formerly been Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s, which was now (through his\r\ninterposition) habitually occupied by her son--the room with the\r\nStatuette on the bracket, and the French windows opening to the ground,\r\nwhich had once recalled to him the Second Vision of the Dream. The\r\nShadow of the Man, which Allan had seen standing opposite to him at the\r\nlong window; the view over a lawn and flower-garden; the pattering of\r\nthe rain against the glass; the stretching out of the Shadow\xe2\x80\x99s arm,\r\nand the fall of the statue in fragments on the floor--these objects and\r\nevents of the visionary scene, so vividly present to his memory once,\r\nwere all superseded by later remembrances now, were all left to fade as\r\nthey might in the dim background of time. He could pass the room again\r\nand again, alone and anxious, and never once think of the boat drifting\r\naway in the moonlight, and the night\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment on the Wrecked Ship!\r\n\r\nToward ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the well-remembered sound of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s voice became\r\nsuddenly audible in the direction of the stables. In a moment more he\r\nwas visible from the garden. His second morning\xe2\x80\x99s search for Neelie had\r\nended to all appearance in a second defeat of his object. The nosegay\r\nwas still in his hand; and he was resignedly making a present of it to\r\none of the coachman\xe2\x80\x99s children.\r\n\r\nMidwinter impulsively took a step forward toward the stables, and\r\nabruptly checked his further progress.\r\n\r\nConscious that his position toward his friend was altered already in\r\nrelation to Miss Gwilt, the first sight of Allan filled his mind with a\r\nsudden distrust of the governess\xe2\x80\x99s influence over him, which was almost\r\na distrust of himself. He knew that he had set forth from the moors on\r\nhis return to Thorpe Ambrose with the resolution of acknowledging the\r\npassion that had mastered him, and of insisting, if necessary, on a\r\nsecond and a longer absence in the interests of the sacrifice which he\r\nwas bent on making to the happiness of his friend. What had become of\r\nthat resolution now? The discovery of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s altered position,\r\nand the declaration that she had voluntarily made of her indifference\r\nto Allan, had scattered it to the winds. The first words with which\r\nhe would have met his friend, if nothing had happened to him on the\r\nhomeward way, were words already dismissed from his lips. He drew back\r\nas he felt it, and struggled, with an instinctive loyalty toward Allan,\r\nto free himself at the last moment from the influence of Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of his useless nosegay, Allan passed on into the garden,\r\nand the instant he entered it recognized Midwinter with a loud cry of\r\nsurprise and delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I awake or dreaming?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, seizing his friend excitably\r\nby both hands. \xe2\x80\x9cYou dear old Midwinter, have you sprung up out of the\r\nground, or have you dropped from the clouds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not till Midwinter had explained the mystery of his unexpected\r\nappearance in every particular that Allan could be prevailed on to say\r\na word about himself. When he did speak, he shook his head ruefully, and\r\nsubdued the hearty loudness of his voice, with a preliminary look round\r\nto see if the servants were within hearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve learned to be cautious since you went away and left me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAllan. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least notion what things have\r\nhappened, and what an awful scrape I\xe2\x80\x99m in at this very moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken, Allan. I have heard more of what has happened than\r\nyou suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! the dreadful mess I\xe2\x80\x99m in with Miss Gwilt? the row with the major?\r\nthe infernal scandal-mongering in the neighborhood? You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to\r\nsay--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Midwinter, quietly; \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! how? Did you stop at Thorpe Ambrose on your way back?\r\nHave you been in the coffee-room at the hotel? Have you met Pedgift?\r\nHave you dropped into the Reading Rooms, and seen what they call the\r\nfreedom of the press in the town newspaper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter paused before he answered, and looked up at the sky. The\r\nclouds had been gathering unnoticed over their heads, and the first\r\nrain-drops were beginning to fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go up to breakfast this way.\xe2\x80\x9d He led\r\nMidwinter through the open French window into his own sitting-room. The\r\nwind blew toward that side of the house, and the rain followed them in.\r\nMidwinter, who was last, turned and closed the window.\r\n\r\nAllan was too eager for the answer which the weather had interrupted to\r\nwait for it till they reached the breakfast-room. He stopped close at\r\nthe window, and added two more to his string of questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you possibly have heard about me and Miss Gwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt herself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Midwinter, gravely.\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s manner changed the moment the governess\xe2\x80\x99s name passed his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had heard my story first,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you meet with\r\nMiss Gwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause. They both stood still at the window,\r\nabsorbed in the interest of the moment. They both forgot that their\r\ncontemplated place of shelter from the rain had been the breakfast-room\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I answer your question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, a little constrainedly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask you something, Allan, on my side. Is it really true that\r\nyou are in some way concerned in Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s leaving Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. The disturbance which had begun to appear in\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s manner palpably increased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather a long story,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been taken in, Midwinter.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been imposed on by a person, who--I can\xe2\x80\x99t help saying it--who\r\ncheated me into promising what I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have promised, and doing\r\nwhat I had better not have done. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t breaking my promise to tell\r\nyou. I can trust in your discretion, can\xe2\x80\x99t I? You will never say a word,\r\nwill you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trust me with any secrets which are not\r\nyour own. If you have given a promise, don\xe2\x80\x99t trifle with it, even in\r\nspeaking to such an intimate friend as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d He laid his hand gently\r\nand kindly on Allan\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help seeing that I have made\r\nyou a little uncomfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help seeing that my\r\nquestion is not so easy a one to answer as I had hoped and supposed.\r\nShall we wait a little? Shall we go upstairs and breakfast first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan was far too earnestly bent on presenting his conduct to his friend\r\nin the right aspect to heed Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion. He spoke eagerly on\r\nthe instant, without moving from the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, it\xe2\x80\x99s a perfectly easy question to answer. Only\xe2\x80\x9d--he\r\nhesitated--\xe2\x80\x9conly it requires what I\xe2\x80\x99m a bad hand at: it requires an\r\nexplanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Midwinter, more seriously, but not less gently\r\nthan before, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you must first justify yourself, and then answer my\r\nquestion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, with an air of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re hit the right\r\nnail on the head, just as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s face darkened for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, his voice sinking low, and his eyes dropping to the ground as\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\nThe rain was beginning to fall thickly. It swept across the garden,\r\nstraight on the closed windows, and pattered heavily against the glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the\r\nparticulars yet. Wait till I explain the thing first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a bad hand at explanations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, repeating Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown words. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t place yourself at a disadvantage. Don\xe2\x80\x99t explain it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan looked at him, in silent perplexity and surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are my friend--my best and dearest friend,\xe2\x80\x9d Midwinter went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bear to let you justify yourself to me as if I was your judge, or\r\nas if I doubted you.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked up again at Allan frankly and kindly as\r\nhe said those words. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cI think, if I look into\r\nmy memory, I can anticipate your explanation. We had a moment\xe2\x80\x99s talk,\r\nbefore I went away, about some very delicate questions which you\r\nproposed putting to Major Milroy. I remember I warned you; I remember\r\nI had my misgivings. Should I be guessing right if I guessed that those\r\nquestions have been in some way the means of leading you into a false\r\nposition? If it is true that you have been concerned in Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleaving her situation, is it also true--is it only doing you justice\r\nto believe--that any mischief for which you are responsible has been\r\nmischief innocently done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, speaking, for the first time, a little constrainedly\r\non his side. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only doing me justice to say that.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped and\r\nbegan drawing lines absently with his finger on the blurred surface of\r\nthe window-pane. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not like other people, Midwinter,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed,\r\nsuddenly, with an effort; \xe2\x80\x9cand I should have liked you to have heard the\r\nparticulars all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will hear them if you desire it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am\r\nsatisfied, without another word, that you have not willingly been the\r\nmeans of depriving Miss Gwilt of her situation. If that is understood\r\nbetween you and me, I think we need say no more. Besides, I have another\r\nquestion to ask, of much greater importance--a question that has been\r\nforced on me by what I saw with my own eyes, and heard with my own ears,\r\nlast night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, recoiling in spite of himself. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we go upstairs first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he asked, abruptly, leading the way to the door, and trying to gain\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt was useless. Once again, the room which they were both free to leave,\r\nthe room which one of them had twice tried to leave already, held them\r\nas if they were prisoners.\r\n\r\nWithout answering, without even appearing to have heard Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproposal to go upstairs, Allan followed him mechanically as far as the\r\nopposite side of the window. There he stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cMidwinter!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst\r\nout, in a sudden panic of astonishment and alarm, \xe2\x80\x9cthere seems to be\r\nsomething strange between us! You\xe2\x80\x99re not like yourself. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith his hand on the lock of the door, Midwinter turned, and looked\r\nback into the room. The moment had come. His haunting fear of doing his\r\nfriend an injustice had shown itself in a restraint of word, look, and\r\naction which had been marked enough to force its way to Allan\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\r\nThe one course left now, in the dearest interests of the friendship that\r\nunited them, was to speak at once, and to speak boldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something strange between us,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter took his hand from the door, and came down again to the\r\nwindow, fronting Allan. He occupied the place, of necessity, which Allan\r\nhad just left. It was the side of the window on which the Statuette\r\nstood. The little figure, placed on its projecting bracket, was, close\r\nbehind him on his right hand. No signs of change appeared in the stormy\r\nsky. The rain still swept slanting across the garden, and pattered\r\nheavily against the glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand, Allan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan gave it, and Midwinter held it firmly while he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something strange between us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something\r\nto be set right which touches you nearly; and it has not been set right\r\nyet. You asked me just now where I met with Miss Gwilt. I met with her\r\non my way back here, upon the high-road on the further side of the\r\ntown. She entreated me to protect her from a man who was following and\r\nfrightening her. I saw the scoundrel with my own eyes, and I should have\r\nlaid hands on him, if Miss Gwilt herself had not stopped me. She gave\r\na very strange reason for stopping me. She said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who his\r\nemployer was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s ruddy color suddenly deepened; he looked aside quickly through\r\nthe window at the pouring rain. At the same moment their hands fell\r\napart, and there was a pause of silence on either side. Midwinter was\r\nthe first to speak again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLater in the evening,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt explained herself. She\r\ntold me two things. She declared that the man whom I had seen following\r\nher was a hired spy. I was surprised, but I could not dispute it. She\r\ntold me next, Allan--what I believe with my whole heart and soul to be\r\na falsehood which has been imposed on her as the truth--she told me that\r\nthe spy was in your employment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan turned instantly from the window, and looked Midwinter full in the\r\nface again. \xe2\x80\x9cI must explain myself this time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, resolutely.\r\n\r\nThe ashy paleness peculiar to him in moments of strong emotion began to\r\nshow itself on Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore explanations!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and drew back a step, with his eyes fixed\r\nin a sudden terror of inquiry on Allan\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I know, Midwinter. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know that what I have\r\ndone has been done with a good reason. And what is more, I have not\r\ntrusted to myself--I have had good advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear what I said just now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Midwinter, incredulously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t--surely, you can\xe2\x80\x99t have been attending to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t missed a word,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you again, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what I know of Miss Gwilt. She has threatened Miss Milroy. Miss\r\nMilroy is in danger while her governess stops in this neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter dismissed the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter from the conversation with a\r\ncontemptuous gesture of his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear about Miss, Milroy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mix up Miss\r\nMilroy--Good God, Allan, am I to understand that the spy set to watch\r\nMiss Gwilt was doing his vile work with your approval?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce for all, my dear fellow, will you, or will you not, let me\r\nexplain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Midwinter, his eyes aflame, and his hot Creole blood\r\nrushing crimson into his face. \xe2\x80\x9cExplain the employment of a spy? What!\r\nafter having driven Miss Gwilt out of her situation by meddling with her\r\nprivate affairs, you meddle again by the vilest of all means--the means\r\nof a paid spy? You set a watch on the woman whom you yourself told me\r\nyou loved, only a fortnight since--the woman you were thinking of as\r\nyour wife! I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it; I won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Is my head failing\r\nme? Is it Allan Armadale I am speaking to? Is it Allan Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nlooking at me? Stop! you are acting under some mistaken scruple. Some\r\nlow fellow has crept into your confidence, and has done this in your\r\nname without telling you first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan controlled himself with admirable patience and admirable\r\nconsideration for the temper of his friend. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you persist in refusing\r\nto hear me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must wait as well as I can till my turn comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me you are a stranger to the employment of that man, and I will\r\nhear you willingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose there should be a necessity, that you know nothing about, for\r\nemploying him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI acknowledge no necessity for the cowardly persecution of a helpless\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA momentary flush of irritation--momentary, and no more--passed over\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mightn\xe2\x80\x99t think her quite so helpless,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyou knew the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre _you_ the man to tell me the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the other. \xe2\x80\x9cYou who\r\nhave refused to hear her in her own defense! You who have closed the\r\ndoors of this house against her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan still controlled himself, but the effort began at last to be\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know your temper is a hot one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for all that, your\r\nviolence quite takes me by surprise. I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for it, unless\xe2\x80\x9d--he\r\nhesitated a moment, and then finished the sentence in his usual frank,\r\noutspoken way--\xe2\x80\x9cunless you are sweet yourself on Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose last words heaped fuel on the fire. They stripped the truth\r\ninstantly of all concealments and disguises, and laid it bare to view.\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s instinct had guessed, and the guiding influence stood revealed\r\nof Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s interest in Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat right have you to say that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with raised voice and\r\nthreatening eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, simply, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I thought I was sweet on her\r\nmyself. Come! come! it\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard, I think, even if you are in love\r\nwith her, to believe everything she tells you, and not to let me say a\r\nword. Is _that_ the way you decide between us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other, infuriated by Allan\xe2\x80\x99s second allusion to\r\nMiss Gwilt. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am asked to choose between the employer of a spy and\r\nthe victim of a spy, I side with the victim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try me too hard, Midwinter, I have a temper to lose as well as\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, struggling with himself. The torture of passion in\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s face, from which a less simple and less generous nature\r\nmight have recoiled in horror, touched Allan suddenly with an artless\r\ndistress, which, at that moment, was little less than sublime. He\r\nadvanced, with his eyes moistening, and his hand held out. \xe2\x80\x9cYou asked\r\nme for my hand just now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I gave it you. Will you remember\r\nold times, and give me yours, before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Midwinter, furiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI may meet Miss Gwilt again, and I\r\nmay want my hand free to deal with your spy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had drawn back along the wall as Allan advanced, until the bracket\r\nwhich supported the Statuette was before instead of behind him. In the\r\nmadness of his passion he saw nothing but Allan\xe2\x80\x99s face confronting him.\r\nIn the madness of his passion, he stretched out his right hand as he\r\nanswered, and shook it threateningly in the air. It struck the forgotten\r\nprojection of the bracket--and the next instant the Statuette lay in\r\nfragments on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe rain drove slanting over flower-bed and lawn, and pattered heavily\r\nagainst the glass; and the two Armadales stood by the window, as the two\r\nShadows had stood in the Second Vision of the Dream, with the wreck of\r\nthe image between them.\r\n\r\nAllan stooped over the fragments of the little figure, and lifted them\r\none by one from the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without looking up, \xe2\x80\x9cor we shall both repent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a word, Midwinter moved back slowly. He stood for the second\r\ntime with his hand on the door, and looked his last at the room. The\r\nhorror of the night on the Wreck had got him once more, and the flame of\r\nhis passion was quenched in an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Dream!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, under his breath. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dream again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door was tried from the outside, and a servant appeared with a\r\ntrivial message about the breakfast.\r\n\r\nMidwinter looked at the man with a blank, dreadful helplessness in his\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cShow me the way out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe place is dark, and the room\r\nturns round with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant took him by the arm, and silently led him out.\r\n\r\nAs the door closed on them, Allan picked up the last fragment of the\r\nbroken figure. He sat down alone at the table, and hid his face in\r\nhis hands. The self-control which he had bravely preserved under\r\nexasperation renewed again and again now failed him at last in the\r\nfriendless solitude of his room, and, in the first bitterness of feeling\r\nthat Midwinter had turned against him like the rest, he burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nThe moments followed each other, the slow time wore on. Little by little\r\nthe signs of a new elemental disturbance began to show themselves in the\r\nsummer storm. The shadow of a swiftly deepening darkness swept over the\r\nsky. The pattering of the rain lessened with the lessening wind. There\r\nwas a momentary hush of stillness. Then on a sudden the rain poured down\r\nagain like a cataract, and the low roll of thunder came up solemnly on\r\nthe dying air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. SHE KNOWS THE TRUTH.\r\n\r\n1. _From Mr. Bashwood to Miss Gwilt_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThorpe Ambrose, July 20th, 1851.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM--I received yesterday, by private messenger, your obliging\r\nnote, in which you direct me to communicate with you through the post\r\nonly, as long as there is reason to believe that any visitors who may\r\ncome to you are likely to be observed. May I be permitted to say that\r\nI look forward with respectful anxiety to the time when I shall again\r\nenjoy the only real happiness I have ever experienced--the happiness of\r\npersonally addressing you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn compliance with your desire that I should not allow this day (the\r\nSunday) to pass without privately noticing what went on at the great\r\nhouse, I took the keys, and went this morning to the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office. I\r\naccounted for my appearance to the servants by informing them that I had\r\nwork to do which it was important to complete in the shortest possible\r\ntime. The same excuse would have done for Mr. Armadale if we had met,\r\nbut no such meeting happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough I was at Thorpe Ambrose in what I thought good time, I was too\r\nlate to see or hear anything myself of a serious quarrel which appeared\r\nto have taken place, just before I arrived, between Mr. Armadale and Mr.\r\nMidwinter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the little information I can give you in this matter is derived\r\nfrom one of the servants. The man told me that he heard the voices of\r\nthe two gentlemen loud in Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room. He went in to\r\nannounce breakfast shortly afterward, and found Mr. Midwinter in such\r\na dreadful state of agitation that he had to be helped out of the room.\r\nThe servant tried to take him upstairs to lie down and compose himself.\r\nHe declined, saying he would wait a little first in one of the lower\r\nrooms, and begging that he might be left alone. The man had hardly got\r\ndownstairs again when he heard the front door opened and closed. He ran\r\nback, and found that Mr. Midwinter was gone. The rain was pouring at the\r\ntime, and thunder and lightning came soon afterward. Dreadful weather\r\ncertainly to go out in. The servant thinks Mr. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s mind was\r\nunsettled. I sincerely hope not. Mr. Midwinter is one of the few people\r\nI have met with in the course of my life who have treated me kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHearing that Mr. Armadale still remained in the sitting-room, I went\r\ninto the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office (which, as you may remember, is on the same\r\nside of the house), and left the door ajar, and set the window open,\r\nwaiting and listening for anything that might happen. Dear madam, there\r\nwas a time when I might have thought such a position in the house of my\r\nemployer not a very becoming one. Let me hasten to assure you that this\r\nis far from being my feeling now. I glory in any position which makes me\r\nserviceable to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe state of the weather seemed hopelessly adverse to that renewal\r\nof intercourse between Mr. Armadale and Miss Milroy which you so\r\nconfidently anticipate, and of which you are so anxious to be made\r\naware. Strangely enough, however, it is actually in consequence of the\r\nstate of the weather that I am now in a position to give you the very\r\ninformation you require. Mr. Armadale and Miss Milroy met about an hour\r\nsince. The circumstances were as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust at the beginning of the thunder-storm, I saw one of the grooms run\r\nacross from the stables, and heard him tap at his master\xe2\x80\x99s window. Mr.\r\nArmadale opened the window and asked what was the matter. The groom said\r\nhe came with a message from the coachman\xe2\x80\x99s wife. She had seen from her\r\nroom over the stables (which looks on to the park) Miss Milroy quite\r\nalone, standing for shelter under one of the trees. As that part of the\r\npark was at some distance from the major\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, she had thought\r\nthat her master might wish to send and ask the young lady into the\r\nhouse--especially as she had placed herself, with a thunder-storm coming\r\non, in what might turn out to be a very dangerous position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moment Mr. Armadale understood the man\xe2\x80\x99s message, he called for the\r\nwater-proof things and the umbrellas, and ran out himself, instead of\r\nleaving it to the servants. In a little time he and the groom came back\r\nwith Miss Milroy between them, as well protected as could be from the\r\nrain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ascertained from one of the women-servants, who had taken the young\r\nlady into a bedroom, and had supplied her with such dry things as she\r\nwanted, that Miss Milroy had been afterward shown into the drawing-room,\r\nand that Mr. Armadale was there with her. The only way of following your\r\ninstructions, and finding out what passed between them, was to go round\r\nthe house in the pelting rain, and get into the conservatory (which\r\nopens into the drawing-room) by the outer door. I hesitate at nothing,\r\ndear madam, in your service; I would cheerfully get wet every day, to\r\nplease you. Besides, though I may at first sight be thought rather an\r\nelderly man, a wetting is of no very serious consequence to me. I assure\r\nyou I am not so old as I look, and I am of a stronger constitution than\r\nappears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was impossible for me to get near enough in the conservatory to see\r\nwhat went on in the drawing-room, without the risk of being discovered.\r\nBut most of the conversation reached me, except when they dropped their\r\nvoices. This is the substance of what I heard:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gathered that Miss Milroy had been prevailed on, against her will, to\r\ntake refuge from the thunder-storm in Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s house. She said so,\r\nat least, and she gave two reasons. The first was that her father had\r\nforbidden all intercourse between the cottage and the great house. Mr.\r\nArmadale met this objection by declaring that her father had issued his\r\norders under a total misconception of the truth, and by entreating her\r\nnot to treat him as cruelly as the major had treated him. He entered,\r\nI suspect, into some explanations at this point, but as he dropped his\r\nvoice I am unable to say what they were. His language, when I did hear\r\nit, was confused and ungrammatical. It seemed, however, to be quite\r\nintelligible enough to persuade Miss Milroy that her father had been\r\nacting under a mistaken impression of the circumstances. At least, I\r\ninfer this; for, when I next heard the conversation, the young lady was\r\ndriven back to her second objection to being in the house--which was,\r\nthat Mr. Armadale had behaved very badly to her, and that he richly\r\ndeserved that she should never speak to him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this latter case, Mr. Armadale attempted no defense of any kind. He\r\nagreed with her that he had behaved badly; he agreed with her that he\r\nrichly deserved she should never speak to him again. At the same time he\r\nimplored her to remember that he had suffered his punishment already.\r\nHe was disgraced in the neighborhood; and his dearest friend, his one\r\nintimate friend in the world, had that very morning turned against him\r\nlike the rest. Far or near, there was not a living creature whom he was\r\nfond of to comfort him, or to say a friendly word to him. He was lonely\r\nand miserable, and his heart ached for a little kindness--and that was\r\nhis only excuse for asking Miss Milroy to forget and forgive the past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must leave you, I fear, to judge for yourself of the effect of this\r\non the young lady; for, though I tried hard, I failed to catch what\r\nshe said. I am almost certain I heard her crying, and Mr. Armadale\r\nentreating her not to break his heart. They whispered a great deal,\r\nwhich aggravated me. I was afterward alarmed by Mr. Armadale coming\r\nout into the conservatory to pick some flowers. He did not come as far,\r\nfortunately, as the place where I was hidden; and he went in again\r\ninto the drawing-room, and there was more talking (I suspect at close\r\nquarters), which to my great regret I again failed to catch. Pray\r\nforgive me for having so little to tell you. I can only add that, when\r\nthe storm cleared off, Miss Milroy went away with the flowers in her\r\nhand, and with Mr. Armadale escorting her from the house. My own humble\r\nopinion is that he had a powerful friend at court, all through the\r\ninterview, in the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s own liking for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all I can say at present, with the exception of one other thing\r\nI heard, which I blush to mention. But your word is law, and you have\r\nordered me to have no concealments from you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir talk turned once, dear madam, on yourself. I think I heard the\r\nword \xe2\x80\x98creature\xe2\x80\x99 from Miss Milroy; and I am certain that Mr. Armadale,\r\nwhile acknowledging that he had once admired you, added that\r\ncircumstances had since satisfied him of \xe2\x80\x98his folly.\xe2\x80\x99 I quote his own\r\nexpression; it made me quite tremble with indignation. If I may be\r\npermitted to say so, the man who admires Miss Gwilt lives in Paradise.\r\nRespect, if nothing else, ought to have closed Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\nHe is my employer, I know; but after his calling it an act of folly to\r\nadmire you (though I _am_ his deputy-steward), I utterly despise him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrusting that I may have been so happy as to give you satisfaction\r\nthus far, and earnestly desirous to deserve the honor of your continued\r\nconfidence in me, I remain, dear madam,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour grateful and devoted servant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFELIX BASHWOOD.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n2. _From Mrs. Oldershaw to Miss Gwilt_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana Street, Monday, July 21st.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR LYDIA--I trouble you with a few lines. They are written under a\r\nsense of the duty which I owe to myself, in our present position toward\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all satisfied with the tone of your last two letters; and I\r\nam still less pleased at your leaving me this morning without any letter\r\nat all--and this when we had arranged, in the doubtful state of our\r\nprospects, that I was to hear from you every day. I can only interpret\r\nyour conduct in one way. I can only infer that matters at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose, having been all mismanaged, are all going wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not my present object to reproach you, for why should I waste\r\ntime, language, and paper? I merely wish to recall to your memory\r\ncertain considerations which you appear to be disposed to overlook.\r\nShall I put them in the plainest English? Yes; for, with all my faults,\r\nI am frankness personified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, then, I have an interest in your becoming Mrs.\r\nArmadale of Thorpe Ambrose as well as you. Secondly, I have provided you\r\n(to say nothing of good advice) with all the money needed to accomplish\r\nour object. Thirdly, I hold your notes of hand, at short dates, for\r\nevery farthing so advanced. Fourthly and lastly, though I am indulgent\r\nto a fault in the capacity of a friend--in the capacity of a woman of\r\nbusiness, my dear, I am not to be trifled with. That is all, Lydia, at\r\nleast for the present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I write in anger; I am only sorry and disheartened.\r\nMy state of mind resembles David\xe2\x80\x99s. If I had the wings of a dove, I\r\nwould flee away and be at rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffectionately yours, MARIA OLDERSHAW.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n3. _From Mr. Bashwood to Miss Gwilt_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThorpe Ambrose, July 21st.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM--You will probably receive these lines a few hours after\r\nmy yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s communication reaches you. I posted my first letter last\r\nnight, and I shall post this before noon to-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy present object in writing is to give you some more news from\r\nthis house. I have the inexpressible happiness of announcing that Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s disgraceful intrusion on your privacy is at an end. The watch\r\nset on your actions is to be withdrawn this day. I write, dear madam,\r\nwith the tears in my eyes--tears of joy, caused by feelings which I\r\nventured to express in my previous letter (see first paragraph toward\r\nthe end). Pardon me this personal reference. I can speak to you (I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow why) so much more readily with my pen than with my tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me try to compose myself, and proceed with my narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had just arrived at the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office this morning, when Mr.\r\nPedgift the elder followed me to the great house to see Mr. Armadale by\r\nspecial appointment. It is needless to say that I at once suspended\r\nany little business there was to do, feeling that your interests might\r\npossibly be concerned. It is also most gratifying to add that this time\r\ncircumstances favored me. I was able to stand under the open window and\r\nto hear the whole interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale explained himself at once in the plainest terms. He\r\ngave orders that the person who had been hired to watch you should be\r\ninstantly dismissed. On being asked to explain this sudden change of\r\npurpose, he did not conceal that it was owing to the effect produced\r\non his mind by what had passed between Mr. Midwinter and himself on the\r\nprevious day. Mr. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s language, cruelly unjust as it was, had\r\nnevertheless convinced him that no necessity whatever could excuse any\r\nproceeding so essentially base in itself as the employment of a spy, and\r\non that conviction he was now determined to act.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for your own positive directions to me to conceal nothing that\r\npasses here in which your name is concerned, I should really be ashamed\r\nto report what Mr. Pedgift said on his side. He has behaved kindly to\r\nme, I know. But if he was my own brother, I could never forgive him the\r\ntone in which he spoke of you, and the obstinacy with which he tried to\r\nmake Mr. Armadale change his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe began by attacking Mr. Midwinter. He declared that Mr. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion was the very worst opinion that could be taken; for it was quite\r\nplain that you, dear madam, had twisted him round your finger. Producing\r\nno effect by this coarse suggestion (which nobody who knows you could\r\nfor a moment believe), Mr. Pedgift next referred to Miss Milroy, and\r\nasked Mr. Armadale if he had given up all idea of protecting her. What\r\nthis meant I cannot imagine. I can only report it for your private\r\nconsideration. Mr. Armadale briefly answered that he had his own plan\r\nfor protecting Miss Milroy, and that the circumstances were altered in\r\nthat quarter, or words to a similar effect. Still Mr. Pedgift persisted.\r\nHe went on (I blush to mention) from bad to worse. He tried to persuade\r\nMr. Armadale next to bring an action at law against one or other of\r\nthe persons who had been most strongly condemning his conduct in the\r\nneighborhood, for the purpose--I really hardly know how to write it--of\r\ngetting you into the witness-box. And worse yet: when Mr. Armadale still\r\nsaid No, Mr. Pedgift, after having, as I suspected by the sound of his\r\nvoice, been on the point of leaving the room, artfully came back, and\r\nproposed sending for a detective officer from London, simply to look at\r\nyou. \xe2\x80\x98The whole of this mystery about Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s true character,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98may turn on a question of identity. It won\xe2\x80\x99t cost much to have\r\na man down from London; and it\xe2\x80\x99s worth trying whether her face is or is\r\nnot known at headquarters to the police.\xe2\x80\x99 I again and again assure you,\r\ndearest lady, that I only repeat those abominable words from a sense of\r\nduty toward yourself. I shook--I declare I shook from head to foot when\r\nI heard them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo resume, for there is more to tell you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale (to his credit--I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t like him)\r\nstill said No. He appeared to be getting irritated under Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npersistence, and he spoke in a somewhat hasty way. \xe2\x80\x98You persuaded me on\r\nthe last occasion when we talked about this,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98to do something\r\nthat I have been since heartily ashamed of. You won\xe2\x80\x99t succeed in\r\npersuading me, Mr. Pedgift, a second time.\xe2\x80\x99 Those were his words. Mr.\r\nPedgift took him up short; Mr. Pedgift seemed to be nettled on his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If that is the light in which you see my advice, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nless you have of it for the future, the better. Your character and\r\nposition are publicly involved in this matter between yourself and Miss\r\nGwilt; and you persist, at a most critical moment, in taking a course of\r\nyour own, which I believe will end badly. After what I have already said\r\nand done in this very serious case, I can\xe2\x80\x99t consent to go on with it\r\nwith both my hands tied, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t drop it with credit to myself while\r\nI remain publicly known as your solicitor. You leave me no alternative,\r\nsir, but to resign the honor of acting as your legal adviser.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nam sorry to hear it,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr. Armadale, \xe2\x80\x98but I have suffered enough\r\nalready through interfering with Miss Gwilt. I can\xe2\x80\x99t and won\xe2\x80\x99t stir any\r\nfurther in the matter.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98_You_ may not stir any further in it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays Mr. Pedgift, \xe2\x80\x98and _I_ shall not stir any further in it, for it\r\nhas ceased to be a question of professional interest to me. But mark my\r\nwords, Mr. Armadale, you are not at the end of this business yet. Some\r\nother person\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity may go on from the point where you (and I) have\r\nstopped; and some other person\xe2\x80\x99s hand may let the broad daylight in yet\r\non Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI report their language, dear madam, almost word for word, I believe,\r\nas I heard it. It produced an indescribable impression on me; it filled\r\nme, I hardly know why, with quite a panic of alarm. I don\xe2\x80\x99t at all\r\nunderstand it, and I understand still less what happened immediately\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s voice, when he said those last words, sounded dreadfully\r\nclose to me. He must have been speaking at the open window, and he must,\r\nI fear, have seen me under it. I had time, before he left the house,\r\nto get out quietly from among the laurels, but not to get back to the\r\noffice. Accordingly I walked away along the drive toward the lodge, as\r\nif I was going on some errand connected with the steward\xe2\x80\x99s business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore long, Mr. Pedgift overtook me in his gig, and stopped. \xe2\x80\x98So _you_\r\nfeel some curiosity about Miss Gwilt, do you?\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Gratify your\r\ncuriosity by all means; _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t object to it.\xe2\x80\x99 I felt naturally\r\nnervous, but I managed to ask him what he meant. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer; he\r\nonly looked down at me from the gig in a very odd manner, and laughed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have known stranger things happen even than _that_!\xe2\x80\x99 he said to\r\nhimself suddenly, and drove off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have ventured to trouble you with this last incident, though it\r\nmay seem of no importance in your eyes, in the hope that your superior\r\nability may be able to explain it. My own poor faculties, I confess, are\r\nquite unable to penetrate Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s meaning. All I know is that he\r\nhas no right to accuse me of any such impertinent feeling as curiosity\r\nin relation to a lady whom I ardently esteem and admire. I dare not put\r\nit in warmer words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only to add that I am in a position to be of continued service\r\nto you here if you wish it. Mr. Armadale has just been into the office,\r\nand has told me briefly that, in Mr. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s continued absence, I am\r\nstill to act as steward\xe2\x80\x99s deputy till further notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, dear madam, anxiously and devotedly yours, FELIX BASHWOOD.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n4. _From Allan Armadale to the Reverend Decimus Brock_.\r\n\r\nThorpe Ambrose, Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MR. BROCK--I am in sad trouble. Midwinter has quarreled with\r\nme and left me; and my lawyer has quarreled with me and left me; and\r\n(except dear little Miss Milroy, who has forgiven me) all the neighbors\r\nhave turned their backs on me. There is a good deal about \xe2\x80\x98me\xe2\x80\x99 in this,\r\nbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I am very miserable alone in my own house. Do pray\r\ncome and see me! You are the only old friend I have left, and I do long\r\nso to tell you about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN. B.--On my word of honor as a gentleman, I am not to blame. Yours\r\naffectionately,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cALLAN ARMADALE.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP. S.--I would come to you (for this place is grown quite hateful to\r\nme), but I have a reason for not going too far away from Miss Milroy\r\njust at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n5. _From Robert Stapleton to Allan Armadale, Esq._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBascombe Rectory, Thursday Morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRESPECTED SIR--I see a letter in your writing, on the table along with\r\nthe others, which I am sorry to say my master is not well enough to\r\nopen. He is down with a sort of low fever. The doctor says it has been\r\nbrought on with worry and anxiety which master was not strong enough to\r\nbear. This seems likely; for I was with him when he went to London last\r\nmonth, and what with his own business, and the business of looking after\r\nthat person who afterward gave us the slip, he was worried and anxious\r\nall the time; and for the matter of that, so was I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy master was talking of you a day or two since. He seemed unwilling\r\nthat you should know of his illness, unless he got worse. But I think\r\nyou ought to know of it. At the same time he is not worse; perhaps\r\na trifle better. The doctor says he must be kept very quiet, and not\r\nagitated on any account. So be pleased to take no notice of this--I mean\r\nin the way of coming to the rectory. I have the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s orders to say\r\nit is not needful, and it would only upset my master in the state he is\r\nin now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will write again if you wish it. Please accept of my duty, and\r\nbelieve me to remain, sir, your humble servant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cROBERT STAPLETON.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.

In my present situation, and with my present\r\nthoughts, the best service you can possibly render me is to lock me up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cL. G.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n8. _From Mrs. Oldershaw to Miss Gwilt_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana Street, July 26th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DARLING LYDIA--The longer I live in this wicked world the more\r\nplainly I see that women\xe2\x80\x99s own tempers are the worst enemies women have\r\nto contend with. What a truly regretful style of correspondence we have\r\nfallen into! What a sad want of self-restraint, my dear, on your side\r\nand on mine!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me, as the oldest in years, be the first to make the needful\r\nexcuses, the first to blush for my own want of self-control. Your cruel\r\nneglect, Lydia, stung me into writing as I did. I am so sensitive to\r\nill treatment, when it is inflicted on me by a person whom I love and\r\nadmire; and, though turned sixty, I am still (unfortunately for myself)\r\nso young at heart. Accept my apologies for having made use of my\r\npen, when I ought to have been content to take refuge in my\r\npocket-handkerchief. Forgive your attached Maria for being still young\r\nat heart!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut oh, my dear--though I own I threatened you--how hard of you to take\r\nme at my word! How cruel of you, if your debt had been ten times what\r\nit is, to suppose me capable (whatever I might say) of the odious\r\ninhumanity of arresting my bosom friend! Heavens! have I deserved to\r\nbe taken at my word in this unmercifully exact way, after the years of\r\ntender intimacy that have united us? But I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain; I only mourn\r\nover the frailty of our common human nature. Let us expect as little of\r\neach other as possible, my dear; we are both women, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nit. I declare, when I reflect on the origin of our unfortunate sex--when\r\nI remember that we were all originally made of no better material than\r\nthe rib of a man (and that rib of so little importance to its possessor\r\nthat he never appears to have missed it afterward), I am quite\r\nastonished at our virtues, and not in the least surprised at our faults.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am wandering a little; I am losing myself in serious thought, like\r\nthat sweet character in Shakespeare who was \xe2\x80\x98fancy free.\xe2\x80\x99 One last word,\r\ndearest, to say that my longing for an answer to this proceeds entirely\r\nfrom my wish to hear from you again in your old friendly tone, and\r\nis quite unconnected with any curiosity to know what you are doing at\r\nThorpe Ambrose--except such curiosity as you yourself might approve.\r\nNeed I add that I beg you as a favor to _me_ to renew, on the customary\r\nterms? I refer to the little bill due on Tuesday next, and I venture to\r\nsuggest that day six weeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours, with a truly motherly feeling,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARIA OLDERSHAW.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n9. _From Miss Gwilt to Mrs. Oldershaw_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParadise Place, July 27th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just got your last letter. The brazen impudence of it has roused\r\nme. I am to be treated like a child, am I?--to be threatened first, and\r\nthen, if threatening fails, to be coaxed afterward? You _shall_ coax me;\r\nyou shall know, my motherly friend, the sort of child you have to deal\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a reason, Mrs. Oldershaw, for the silence which has so seriously\r\noffended you. I was afraid--actually afraid--to let you into the secret\r\nof my thoughts. No such fear troubles me now. My only anxiety this\r\nmorning is to make you my best acknowledgments for the manner in which\r\nyou have written to me. After carefully considering it, I think the\r\nworst turn I can possibly do you is to tell you what you are burning to\r\nknow. So here I am at my desk, bent on telling it. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t bitterly\r\nrepent, when you are at the end of this letter, not having held to your\r\nfirst resolution, and locked me up out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way while you had the\r\nchance, my name is not Lydia Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did my last letter end? I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember, and don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Make it\r\nout as you can--I am not going back any further than this day week. That\r\nis to say, Sunday last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a thunder-storm in the morning. It began to clear off toward\r\nnoon. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go out: I waited to see Midwinter or to hear from him.\r\n(Are you surprised at my not writing \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\xe2\x80\x99 before his name? We have got\r\nso familiar, my dear, that \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\xe2\x80\x99 would be quite out of place.) He had\r\nleft me the evening before, under very interesting circumstances. I had\r\ntold him that his friend Armadale was persecuting me by means of a hired\r\nspy. He had declined to believe it, and had gone straight to Thorpe\r\nAmbrose to clear the thing up. I let him kiss my hand before he went. He\r\npromised to come back the next day (the Sunday). I felt I had secured my\r\ninfluence over him; and I believed he would keep his word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the thunder passed away as I told you. The weather cleared up;\r\nthe people walked out in their best clothes; the dinners came in from\r\nthe bakers; I sat dreaming at my wretched little hired piano, nicely\r\ndressed and looking my best--and still no Midwinter appeared. It was\r\nlate in the afternoon, and I was beginning to feel offended, when a\r\nletter was brought to me. It had been left by a strange messenger\r\nwho went away again immediately. I looked at the letter. Midwinter at\r\nlast--in writing, instead of in person. I began to feel more offended\r\nthan ever; for, as I told you, I thought I had used my influence over\r\nhim to better purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter, when I read it, set my mind off in a new direction. It\r\nsurprised, it puzzled, it interested me. I thought, and thought, and\r\nthought of him, all the rest of the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe began by asking my pardon for having doubted what I told him. Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s own lips had confirmed me. They had quarreled (as I had\r\nanticipated they would); and he, and the man who had once been\r\nhis dearest friend on earth, had parted forever. So far, I was not\r\nsurprised. I was amused by his telling me in his extravagant way that he\r\nand his friend were parted forever; and I rather wondered what he would\r\nthink when I carried out my plan, and found my way into the great house\r\non pretense of reconciling them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the second part of the letter set me thinking. Here it is, in his\r\nown words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is only by struggling against myself (and no language can say how\r\nhard the struggle has been) that I have decided on writing, instead of\r\nspeaking to you. A merciless necessity claims my future life. I must\r\nleave Thorpe Ambrose, I must leave England, without hesitating, without\r\nstopping to look back. There are reasons--terrible reasons, which I have\r\nmadly trifled with--for my never letting Mr. Armadale set eyes on me, or\r\nhear of me again, after what has happened between us. I must go, never\r\nmore to live under the same roof, never more to breathe the same air\r\nwith that man. I must hide myself from him under an assumed name; I\r\nmust put the mountains and the seas between us. I have been warned as\r\nno human creature was ever warned before. I believe--I dare not tell you\r\nwhy--I believe that, if the fascination you have for me draws me back to\r\nyou, fatal consequences will come of it to the man whose life has been\r\nso strangely mingled with your life and mine--the man who was once\r\n_your_ admirer and _my_ friend. And yet, feeling this, seeing it in my\r\nmind as plainly as I see the sky above my head, there is a weakness in\r\nme that still shrinks from the one imperative sacrifice of never seeing\r\nyou again. I am fighting with it as a man fights with the strength of\r\nhis despair. I have been near enough, not an hour since, to see the\r\nhouse where you live, and have forced myself away again out of sight\r\nof it. Can I force myself away further still, now that my letter is\r\nwritten--now, when the useless confession escapes me, and I own to\r\nloving you with the first love I have ever known, with the last love\r\nI shall ever feel? Let the coming time answer the question; I dare not\r\nwrite of it or think of it more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose were the last words. In that strange way the letter ended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt a perfect fever of curiosity to know what he meant. His loving\r\nme, of course, was easy enough to understand. But what did he mean by\r\nsaying he had been warned? Why was he never to live under the same roof,\r\nnever to breathe the same air again, with young Armadale? What sort of\r\nquarrel could it be which obliged one man to hide himself from another\r\nunder an assumed name, and to put the mountains and the seas between\r\nthem? Above all, if he came back, and let me fascinate him, why should\r\nit be fatal to the hateful lout who possesses the noble fortune and\r\nlives in the great house?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never longed in my life as I longed to see him again and put these\r\nquestions to him. I got quite superstitious about it as the day drew on.\r\nThey gave me a sweet-bread and a cherry pudding for dinner. I actually\r\ntried if he would come back by the stones in the plate! He will, he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t, he will, he won\xe2\x80\x99t--and so on. It ended in \xe2\x80\x98He won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99 I rang\r\nthe bell, and had the things taken away. I contradicted Destiny quite\r\nfiercely. I said, \xe2\x80\x98He will!\xe2\x80\x99 and I waited at home for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a pleasure it is to me to give you all these little\r\nparticulars. Count up--my bosom friend, my second mother--count up the\r\nmoney you have advanced on the chance of my becoming Mrs. Armadale, and\r\nthen think of my feeling this breathless interest in another man. Oh,\r\nMrs. Oldershaw, how intensely I enjoy the luxury of irritating you!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day got on toward evening. I rang again, and sent down to borrow a\r\nrailway time-table. What trains were there to take him away on Sunday?\r\nThe national respect for the Sabbath stood my friend. There was only\r\none train, which had started hours before he wrote to me. I went and\r\nconsulted my glass. It paid me the compliment of contradicting\r\nthe divination by cherry-stones. My glass said: \xe2\x80\x98Get behind the\r\nwindow-curtain; he won\xe2\x80\x99t pass the long lonely evening without coming\r\nback again to look at the house.\xe2\x80\x99 I got behind the window-curtain, and\r\nwaited with his letter in my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dismal Sunday light faded, and the dismal Sunday quietness in the\r\nstreet grew quieter still. The dusk came, and I heard a step coming with\r\nit in the silence. My heart gave a little jump--only think of my having\r\nany heart left! I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98Midwinter!\xe2\x80\x99 And Midwinter it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he came in sight he was walking slowly, stopping and hesitating at\r\nevery two or three steps. My ugly little drawing-room window seemed to\r\nbe beckoning him on in spite of himself. After waiting till I saw him\r\ncome to a standstill, a little aside from the house, but still within\r\nview of my irresistible window, I put on my things and slipped out\r\nby the back way into the garden. The landlord and his family were at\r\nsupper, and nobody saw me. I opened the door in the wall, and got\r\nround by the lane into the street. At that awkward moment I suddenly\r\nremembered, what I had forgotten before, the spy set to watch me, who\r\nwas, no doubt, waiting somewhere in sight of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was necessary to get time to think, and it was (in my state of\r\nmind) impossible to let Midwinter go without speaking to him. In great\r\ndifficulties you generally decide at once, if you decide at all. I\r\ndecided to make an appointment with him for the next evening, and to\r\nconsider in the interval how to manage the interview so that it might\r\nescape observation. This, as I felt at the time, was leaving my own\r\ncuriosity free to torment me for four-and-twenty mortal hours; but what\r\nother choice had I? It was as good as giving up being mistress of Thorpe\r\nAmbrose altogether, to come to a private understanding with Midwinter in\r\nthe sight and possibly in the hearing of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s spy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinding an old letter of yours in my pocket, I drew back into the lane,\r\nand wrote on the blank leaf, with the little pencil that hangs at my\r\nwatch-chain: \xe2\x80\x98I must and will speak to you. It is impossible to-night,\r\nbut be in the street to-morrow at this time, and leave me afterward\r\nforever, if you like. When you have read this, overtake me, and say as\r\nyou pass, without stopping or looking round, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI folded up the paper, and came on him suddenly from behind. As he\r\nstarted and turned round, I put the note into his hand, pressed his\r\nhand, and passed on. Before I had taken ten steps I heard him behind me.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t say he didn\xe2\x80\x99t look round--I saw his big black eyes, bright and\r\nglittering in the dusk, devour me from head to foot in a moment;\r\nbut otherwise he did what I told him. \xe2\x80\x98I can deny you nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nwhispered; \xe2\x80\x98I promise.\xe2\x80\x99 He went on and left me. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking\r\nat the time how that brute and booby Armadale would have spoiled\r\neverything in the same situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried hard all night to think of a way of making our interview of the\r\nnext evening safe from discovery, and tried in vain. Even as early\r\nas this, I began to feel as if Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s letter had, in some\r\nunaccountable manner, stupefied me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonday morning made matters worse. News came from my faithful ally,\r\nMr. Bashwood, that Miss Milroy and Armadale had met and become friends\r\nagain. You may fancy the state I was in! An hour or two later there came\r\nmore news from Mr. Bashwood--good news this time. The mischievous\r\nidiot at Thorpe Ambrose had shown sense enough at last to be ashamed of\r\nhimself. He had decided on withdrawing the spy that very day, and he and\r\nhis lawyer had quarreled in consequence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo here was the obstacle which I was too stupid to remove for myself\r\nobligingly removed for me! No more need to fret about the coming\r\ninterview with Midwinter; and plenty of time to consider my next\r\nproceedings, now that Miss Milroy and her precious swain had come\r\ntogether again. Would you believe it, the letter, or the man himself (I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know which), had taken such a hold on me that, though I tried and\r\ntried, I could think of nothing else; and this when I had every reason\r\nto fear that Miss Milroy was in a fair way of changing her name to\r\nArmadale, and when I knew that my heavy debt of obligation to her was\r\nnot paid yet? Was there ever such perversity? I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for it;\r\ncan you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dusk of the evening came at last. I looked out of the window--and\r\nthere he was!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI joined him at once; the people of the house, as before, being too\r\nmuch absorbed in their eating and drinking to notice anything else. \xe2\x80\x98We\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t be seen together here,\xe2\x80\x99 I whispered. \xe2\x80\x98I must go on first, and\r\nyou must follow me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said nothing in the way of reply. What was going on in his mind\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to guess; but, after coming to his appointment, he\r\nactually hung back as if he was half inclined to go away again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You look as if you were afraid of me,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I _am_ afraid of you,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered--\xe2\x80\x98of you, and of myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not encouraging; it was not complimentary. But I was in such\r\na frenzy of curiosity by this time that, if he had been ruder still, I\r\nshould have taken no notice of it. I led the way a few steps toward the\r\nnew buildings, and stopped and looked round after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Must I ask it of you as a favor,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98after your giving me your\r\npromise, and after such a letter as you have written to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething suddenly changed him; he was at my side in an instant. \xe2\x80\x98I beg\r\nyour pardon, Miss Gwilt; lead the way where you please.\xe2\x80\x99 He dropped back\r\na little after that answer, and I heard him say to himself, \xe2\x80\x98What _is_\r\nto be _will_ be. What have I to do with it, and what has she?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt could hardly have been the words, for I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand them--it\r\nmust have been the tone he spoke in, I suppose, that made me feel a\r\nmomentary tremor. I was half inclined, without the ghost of a reason for\r\nit, to wish him good-night, and go in again. Not much like me, you will\r\nsay. Not much, indeed! It didn\xe2\x80\x99t last a moment. Your darling Lydia soon\r\ncame to her senses again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI led the way toward the unfinished cottages, and the country beyond.\r\nIt would have been much more to my taste to have had him into the house,\r\nand have talked to him in the light of the candles. But I had risked it\r\nonce already; and in this scandal-mongering place, and in my critical\r\nposition, I was afraid to risk it again. The garden was not to be\r\nthought of either, for the landlord smokes his pipe there after his\r\nsupper. There was no alternative but to take him away from the town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom time to time, I looked back as I went on. There he was, always at\r\nthe same distance, dim and ghost-like in the dusk, silently following\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must leave off for a little while. The church bells have broken out,\r\nand the jangling of them drives me mad. In these days, when we have\r\nall got watches and clocks, why are bells wanted to remind us when\r\nthe service begins? We don\xe2\x80\x99t require to be rung into the theater. How\r\nexcessively discreditable to the clergy to be obliged to ring us into\r\nthe church!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have rung the congregation in at last; and I can take up my pen,\r\nand go on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a little in doubt where to lead him to. The high-road was on one\r\nside of me; but, empty as it looked, somebody might be passing when\r\nwe least expected it. The other way was through the coppice. I led him\r\nthrough the coppice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the outskirts of the trees, on the other side, there was a dip\r\nin the ground with some felled timber lying on it, and a little\r\npool beyond, still and white and shining in the twilight. The long\r\ngrazing-grounds rose over its further shore, with the mist thickening on\r\nthem, and a dim black line far away of cattle in slow procession going\r\nhome. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a living creature near; there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a sound to be\r\nheard. I sat down on one of the felled trees and looked back for him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, softly--\xe2\x80\x98come and sit by me here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy am I so particular about all this? I hardly know. The place made an\r\nunaccountably vivid impression on me, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t help writing about\r\nit. If I end badly--suppose we say on the scaffold?--I believe the last\r\nthing I shall see, before the hangman pulls the drop, will be the\r\nlittle shining pool, and the long, misty grazing-grounds, and the cattle\r\nwinding dimly home in the thickening night. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, you worthy\r\ncreature! My fancies play me strange tricks sometimes; and there is a\r\nlittle of last night\xe2\x80\x99s laudanum, I dare say, in this part of my letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came--in the strangest silent way, like a man walking in his\r\nsleep--he came and sat down by me. Either the night was very close, or\r\nI was by this time literally in a fever: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear my bonnet on;\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear my gloves. The want to look at him, and see what\r\nhis singular silence meant, and the impossibility of doing it in the\r\ndarkening light, irritated my nerves, till I thought I should have\r\nscreamed. I took his hand, to try if that would help me. It was burning\r\nhot; and it closed instantly on mine--you know how. Silence, after\r\n_that_, was not to be thought of. The one safe way was to begin talking\r\nto him at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t despise me,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98I am obliged to bring you to this lonely\r\nplace; I should lose my character if we were seen together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waited a little. His hand warned me once more not to let the silence\r\ncontinue. I determined to _make_ him speak to me this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You have interested me, and frightened me,\xe2\x80\x99 I went on. \xe2\x80\x98You have\r\nwritten me a very strange letter. I must know what it means.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is too late to ask. _You_ have taken the way, and _I_ have taken\r\nthe way, from which there is no turning back.\xe2\x80\x99 He made that strange\r\nanswer in a tone that was quite new to me--a tone that made me even more\r\nuneasy than his silence had made me the moment before. \xe2\x80\x98Too late,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nrepeated--\xe2\x80\x98too late! There is only one question to ask me now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I said the words, a sudden trembling passed from his hand to mine,\r\nand told me instantly that I had better have held my tongue. Before I\r\ncould move, before I could think, he had me in his arms. \xe2\x80\x98Ask me if I\r\nlove you,\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered. At the same moment his head sank on my bosom;\r\nand some unutterable torture that was in him burst its way out, as it\r\ndoes with _us_, in a passion of sobs and tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first impulse was the impulse of a fool. I was on the point of\r\nmaking our usual protest and defending myself in our usual way. Luckily\r\nor unluckily, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which, I have lost the fine edge of the\r\nsensitiveness of youth; and I checked the first movement of my hands,\r\nand the first word on my lips. Oh, dear, how old I felt, while he was\r\nsobbing his heart out on my breast! How I thought of the time when he\r\nmight have possessed himself of my love! All he had possessed himself of\r\nnow was--my waist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether I pitied him? It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if I did. At any rate,\r\nmy hand lifted itself somehow, and my fingers twined themselves softly\r\nin his hair. Horrible recollections came back to me of other times, and\r\nmade me shudder as I touched him. And yet I did it. What fools women\r\nare!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t reproach you,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, gently. \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t say this is a cruel\r\nadvantage to take of me, in such a position as mine. You are dreadfully\r\nagitated; I will let you wait a little and compose yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving got as far as that, I stopped to consider how I should put the\r\nquestions to him that I was burning to ask. But I was too confused,\r\nI suppose, or perhaps too impatient to consider. I let out what was\r\nuppermost in my mind, in the words that came first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you love me,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98You write strange things to\r\nme; you frighten me with mysteries. What did you mean by saying in your\r\nletter that it would be fatal to Mr. Armadale if you came back to me?\r\nWhat danger can there be to Mr. Armadale--?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I could finish the question, he suddenly lifted his head and\r\nunclasped his arms. I had apparently touched some painful subject which\r\nrecalled him to himself. Instead of my shrinking from _him_, it was he\r\nwho shrank from _me_. I felt offended with him; why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know--but\r\noffended I was; and I thanked him with my bitterest emphasis for\r\nremembering what was due to me, _at last_!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do you believe in Dreams?\xe2\x80\x99 he burst out, in the most strangely abrupt\r\nmanner, without taking the slightest notice of what I had said to him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, without allowing me time to answer, \xe2\x80\x98were you, or\r\nwas any relation of yours, ever connected with Allan Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s father\r\nor mother? Were you, or was anybody belonging to you, ever in the island\r\nof Madeira?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConceive my astonishment, if you can. I turned cold. In an instant I\r\nturned cold all over. He was plainly in the secret of what had happened\r\nwhen I was in Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s service in Madeira--in all probability\r\nbefore he was born! That was startling enough of itself. And he had\r\nevidently some reason of his own for trying to connect _me_ with those\r\nevents--which was more startling still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, as soon as I could trust myself to speak. \xe2\x80\x98I know nothing\r\nof his father or mother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And nothing of the island of Madeira?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Nothing of the island of Madeira.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe turned his head away, and began talking to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Strange!\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98As certainly as I was in the Shadow\xe2\x80\x99s place at the\r\nwindow, _she_ was in the Shadow\xe2\x80\x99s place at the pool!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder other circumstances, his extraordinary behavior might have\r\nalarmed me. But after his question about Madeira, there was some greater\r\nfear in me which kept all common alarm at a distance. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\r\never determined on anything in my life as I determined on finding out\r\nhow he had got his information, and who he really was. It was quite\r\nplain to me that I had roused some hidden feeling in him by my question\r\nabout Armadale, which was as strong in its way as his feeling for _me_.\r\nWhat had become of my influence over him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what had become of it; but I could and did set to\r\nwork to make him feel it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t treat me cruelly,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t treat _you_ cruelly just\r\nnow. Oh, Mr. Midwinter, it\xe2\x80\x99s so lonely, it\xe2\x80\x99s so dark--don\xe2\x80\x99t frighten\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Frighten you!\xe2\x80\x99 He was close to me again in a moment. \xe2\x80\x98Frighten you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe repeated the word with as much astonishment as if I had woke him from\r\na dream, and charged him with something that he had said in his sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was on the tip of my tongue, finding how I had surprised him, to\r\ntake him while he was off his guard, and to ask why my question about\r\nArmadale had produced such a change in his behavior to me. But after\r\nwhat had happened already, I was afraid to risk returning to the\r\nsubject too soon. Something or other--what they call an instinct, I dare\r\nsay--warned me to let Armadale alone for the present, and to talk to\r\nhim first about himself. As I told you in one of my early letters, I had\r\nnoticed signs and tokens in his manner and appearance which convinced\r\nme, young as he was, that he had done something or suffered something\r\nout of the common in his past life. I had asked myself more and more\r\nsuspiciously every time I saw him whether he was what he appeared to be;\r\nand first and foremost among my other doubts was a doubt whether he was\r\npassing among us by his real name. Having secrets to keep about my own\r\npast life, and having gone myself in other days by more than one assumed\r\nname, I suppose I am all the readier to suspect other people when I find\r\nsomething mysterious about them. Any way, having the suspicion in\r\nmy mind, I determined to startle him, as he had startled me, by an\r\nunexpected question on my side--a question about his name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I was thinking, he was thinking; and, as it soon appeared, of\r\nwhat I had just said to him. \xe2\x80\x98I am so grieved to have frightened you,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe whispered, with that gentleness and humility which we all so heartily\r\ndespise in a man when he speaks to other women, and which we all so\r\ndearly like when he speaks to ourselves. \xe2\x80\x98I hardly know what I have been\r\nsaying,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on; \xe2\x80\x98my mind is miserably disturbed. Pray forgive me,\r\nif you can; I am not myself to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I am not angry,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98I have nothing to forgive. We are both\r\nimprudent; we are both unhappy.\xe2\x80\x99 I laid my head on his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x98Do you\r\nreally love me?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked him, softly, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis arm stole round me again; and I felt the quick beat of his heart\r\nget quicker and quicker. \xe2\x80\x98If you only knew!\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered back; \xe2\x80\x98if you\r\nonly knew--\xe2\x80\x99 He could say no more. I felt his face bending toward mine,\r\nand dropped my head lower, and stopped him in the very act of kissing\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98I am only a woman who has taken your fancy. You are\r\ntreating me as if I was your promised wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_Be_ my promised wife!\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered, eagerly, and tried to raise my\r\nhead. I kept it down. The horror of these old remembrances that you know\r\nof came back and made me tremble a little when he asked me to be his\r\nwife. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I was actually faint; but something like faintness\r\nmade me close my eyes. The moment I shut them, the darkness seemed to\r\nopen as if lightning had split it; and the ghosts of _those other men_\r\nrose in the horrid gap, and looked at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Speak to me!\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered, tenderly. \xe2\x80\x98My darling, my angel, speak to\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis voice helped me to recover myself. I had just sense enough left to\r\nremember that the time was passing, and that I had not put my question\r\nto him yet about his name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Suppose I felt for you as you feel for me?\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98Suppose I loved\r\nyou dearly enough to trust you with the happiness of all my life to\r\ncome?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI paused a moment to get my breath. It was unbearably still and close;\r\nthe air seemed to have died when the night came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Would you be marrying me honorably,\xe2\x80\x99 I went on, \xe2\x80\x98if you married me in\r\nyour present name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis arm dropped from my waist, and I felt him give one great start.\r\nAfter that he sat by me, still, and cold, and silent, as if my question\r\nhad struck him dumb. I put my arm round his neck, and lifted my head\r\nagain on his shoulder. Whatever the spell was I had laid on him, my\r\ncoming closer in that way seemed to break it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Who told you?\xe2\x80\x99 He stopped. \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, \xe2\x80\x98nobody can have told\r\nyou. What made you suspect--?\xe2\x80\x99 He stopped again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Nobody told me,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what made me suspect. Women\r\nhave strange fancies sometimes. Is Midwinter really your name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t deceive you,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, after another interval of silence;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Midwinter is _not_ really my name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI nestled a little closer to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What _is_ your name?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lifted my face till my cheek just touched his. I persisted, with my\r\nlips close at his ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What, no confidence in me even yet! No confidence in the woman who\r\nhas almost confessed she loves you--who has almost consented to be your\r\nwife!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe turned his face to mine. For the second time he tried to kiss me,\r\nand for the second time I stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If I tell you my name,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I must tell you more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI let my cheek touch his again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98How can I love a man--much less marry him--if he\r\nkeeps himself a stranger to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no answering that, as I thought. But he did answer it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is a dreadful story,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98It may darken all your life, if you\r\nknow it, as it has darkened mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put my other arm round him, and persisted. \xe2\x80\x98Tell it me; I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nafraid; tell it me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe began to yield to my other arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Will you keep it a sacred secret?\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Never to be\r\nbreathed--never to be known but to you and me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promised him it should be a secret. I waited in a perfect frenzy of\r\nexpectation. Twice he tried to begin, and twice his courage failed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 he broke out in a wild, helpless way. \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy curiosity, or more likely my temper, got beyond all control. He had\r\nirritated me till I was reckless what I said or what I did. I suddenly\r\nclasped him close, and pressed my lips to his. \xe2\x80\x98I love you!\xe2\x80\x99 I whispered\r\nin a kiss. \xe2\x80\x98_Now_ will you tell me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the moment he was speechless. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I did it\r\npurposely to drive him wild. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I did it involuntarily\r\nin a burst of rage. Nothing is certain but that I interpreted his\r\nsilence the wrong way. I pushed him back from me in a fury the instant\r\nafter I had kissed him. \xe2\x80\x98I hate you!\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98You have maddened me into\r\nforgetting myself. Leave me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for the darkness. Leave me\r\ninstantly, and never see me again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe caught me by the hand and stopped me. He spoke in a new voice; he\r\nsuddenly _commanded_, as only men can.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Sit down,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98You have given me back my courage--you shall know\r\nwho I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the silence and the darkness all round us, I obeyed him, and sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the silence and the darkness all round us, he took me in his arms\r\nagain, and told me who he was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I trust you with his story? Shall I tell you his real name? Shall\r\nI show you, as I threatened, the thoughts that have grown out of my\r\ninterview with him and out of all that has happened to me since that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr shall I keep his secret as I promised? and keep my own secret too,\r\nby bringing this weary, long letter to an end at the very moment when\r\nyou are burning to hear more!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are serious questions, Mrs. Oldershaw--more serious than you\r\nsuppose. I have had time to calm down, and I begin to see, what I\r\nfailed to see when I first took up my pen to write to you, the wisdom of\r\nlooking at consequences. Have I frightened myself in trying to frighten\r\n_you_? It is possible--strange as it may seem, it is really possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been at the window for the last minute or two, thinking. There\r\nis plenty of time for thinking before the post leaves. The people are\r\nonly now coming out of church.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have settled to put my letter on one side, and to take a look at my\r\ndiary. In plainer words I must see what I risk if I decide on trusting\r\nyou; and my diary will show me what my head is too weary to calculate\r\nwithout help. I have written the story of my days (and sometimes the\r\nstory of my nights) much more regularly than usual for the last week,\r\nhaving reasons of my own for being particularly careful in this respect\r\nunder present circumstances. If I end in doing what it is now in my\r\nmind to do, it would be madness to trust to my memory. The smallest\r\nforgetfulness of the slightest event that has happened from the night of\r\nmy interview with Midwinter to the present time might be utter ruin to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Utter ruin to her!\xe2\x80\x99 you will say. \xe2\x80\x98What kind of ruin does she mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little, till I have asked my diary whether I can safely tell\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. MISS GWILT\xe2\x80\x99S DIARY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 21st, Monday night, eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--Midwinter has just left me.\r\nWe parted by my desire at the path out of the coppice; he going his way\r\nto the hotel, and I going mine to my lodgings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have managed to avoid making another appointment with him by\r\narranging to write to him to-morrow morning. This gives me the night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterval to compose myself, and to coax my mind back (if I can) to my\r\nown affairs. Will the night pass, and the morning find me still thinking\r\nof the Letter that came to him from his father\xe2\x80\x99s deathbed? of the night\r\nhe watched through on the Wrecked Ship; and, more than all, of the first\r\nbreathless moment when he told me his real Name?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it help me to shake off these impressions, I wonder, if I made\r\nthe effort of writing them down? There would be no danger, in that case,\r\nof my forgetting anything important. And perhaps, after all, it may be\r\nthe fear of forgetting something which I ought to remember that keeps\r\nthis story of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s weighing as it does on my mind. At any rate,\r\nthe experiment is worth trying. In my present situation I _must_ be free\r\nto think of other things, or I shall never find my way through all the\r\ndifficulties at Thorpe Ambrose that are still to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me think. What _haunts_ me, to begin with?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Names haunt me. I keep saying and saying to myself: Both\r\nalike!--Christian name and surname both alike! A light-haired Allan\r\nArmadale, whom I have long since known of, and who is the son of my old\r\nmistress. A dark-haired Allan Armadale, whom I only know of now, and\r\nwho is only known to others under the name of Ozias Midwinter. Stranger\r\nstill; it is not relationship, it is not chance, that has made them\r\nnamesakes. The father of the light Armadale was the man who was _born_\r\nto the family name, and who lost the family inheritance. The father\r\nof the dark Armadale was the man who _took_ the name, on condition of\r\ngetting the inheritance--and who got it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo there are two of them--I can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking of it--both unmarried.\r\nThe light-haired Armadale, who offers to the woman who can secure him,\r\neight thousand a year while he lives; who leaves her twelve hundred\r\na year when he dies; who must and shall marry me for those two golden\r\nreasons; and whom I hate and loathe as I never hated and loathed a man\r\nyet. And the dark-haired Armadale, who has a poor little income, which\r\nmight perhaps pay his wife\xe2\x80\x99s milliner, if his wife was careful; who has\r\njust left me, persuaded that I mean to marry him; and whom--well, whom I\r\n_might_ have loved once, before I was the woman I am now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Allan the Fair doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know he has a namesake. And Allan the Dark\r\nhas kept the secret from everybody but the Somersetshire clergyman\r\n(whose discretion he can depend on) and myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there are two Allan Armadales--two Allan Armadales--two Allan\r\nArmadales. There! three is a lucky number. Haunt me again, after that,\r\nif you can!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next? The murder in the timber ship? No; the murder is a good\r\nreason why the dark Armadale, whose father committed it, should keep his\r\nsecret from the fair Armadale, whose father was killed; but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconcern _me_. I remember there was a suspicion in Madeira at the time of\r\nsomething wrong. _Was_ it wrong? Was the man who had been tricked out of\r\nhis wife to blame for shutting the cabin door, and leaving the man who\r\nhad tricked him to drown in the wreck? Yes; the woman wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I sure of that really concerns myself?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of one very important thing. I am sure that Midwinter--I\r\nmust call him by his ugly false name, or I may confuse the two Armadales\r\nbefore I have done--I am sure that Midwinter is perfectly ignorant that\r\nI and the little imp of twelve years old who waited on Mrs. Armadale in\r\nMadeira, and copied the letters that were supposed to arrive from the\r\nWest Indies, are one and the same. There are not many girls of twelve\r\nwho could have imitated a man\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, and held their tongues\r\nabout it afterward, as I did; but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter now. What does\r\nmatter is that Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s belief in the Dream is Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nreason for trying to connect me with Allan Armadale, by associating\r\nme with Allan Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother. I asked him if he actually\r\nthought me old enough to have known either of them. And he said No, poor\r\nfellow, in the most innocent, bewildered way. Would he say No if he saw\r\nme now? Shall I turn to the glass and see if I look my five-and-thirty\r\nyears? or shall I go on writing? I will go on writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing more that haunts me almost as obstinately as the\r\nNames.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether I am right in relying on Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s superstition (as\r\nI do) to help me in keeping him at arms-length. After having let the\r\nexcitement of the moment hurry me into saying more than I need have\r\nsaid, he is certain to press me; he is certain to come back, with a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s hateful selfishness and impatience in such things, to the question\r\nof marrying me. Will the Dream help me to check him? After alternately\r\nbelieving and disbelieving in it, he has got, by his own confession,\r\nto believing in it again. Can I say I believe in it, too? I have better\r\nreasons for doing so than he knows of. I am not only the person who\r\nhelped Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s marriage by helping her to impose on her own\r\nfather: I am the woman who tried to drown herself; the woman who started\r\nthe series of accidents which put young Armadale in possession of his\r\nfortune; the woman who has come Thorpe Ambrose to marry him for his\r\nfortune, now he has got it; and more extraordinary still, the woman who\r\nstood in the Shadow\xe2\x80\x99s place at the pool! These may be coincidences,\r\nbut they are strange coincidences. I declare I begin to fancy that _I_\r\nbelieve in the Dream too!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I say to him, \xe2\x80\x98I think as you think. I say what you said in\r\nyour letter to me, Let us part before the harm is done. Leave me\r\nbefore the Third Vision of the Dream comes true. Leave me, and put the\r\nmountains and the seas between you and the man who bears your name!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose, on the other side, that his love for me makes him reckless of\r\neverything else? Suppose he says those desperate words again, which I\r\nunderstand now: What _is_ to be, _will_ be. What have I to do with it,\r\nand what has she?\xe2\x80\x99 Suppose--suppose--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t write any more. I hate writing. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t relieve me--it makes\r\nme worse. I\xe2\x80\x99m further from being able to think of all that I _must_\r\nthink of than I was when I sat down. It is past midnight. To-morrow has\r\ncome already; and here I am as helpless as the stupidest woman living!\r\nBed is the only fit place for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBed? If it was ten years since, instead of to-day; and if I had married\r\nMidwinter for love, I might be going to bed now with nothing heavier on\r\nmy mind than a visit on tiptoe to the nursery, and a last look at night\r\nto see if my children were sleeping quietly in their cribs. I wonder\r\nwhether I should have loved my children if I had ever had any? Perhaps,\r\nyes--perhaps, no. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTuesday morning, ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--Who was the man who invented laudanum?\r\nI thank him from the bottom of my heart whoever he was. If all the\r\nmiserable wretches in pain of body and mind, whose comforter he has\r\nbeen, could meet together to sing his praises, what a chorus it would\r\nbe! I have had six delicious hours of oblivion; I have woke up with my\r\nmind composed; I have written a perfect little letter to Midwinter; I\r\nhave drunk my nice cup of tea, with a real relish of it; I have dawdled\r\nover my morning toilet with an exquisite sense of relief--and all\r\nthrough the modest little bottle of Drops, which I see on my bedroom\r\nchimney-piece at this moment. \xe2\x80\x98Drops,\xe2\x80\x99 you are a darling! If I love\r\nnothing else, I love _you_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy letter to Midwinter has been sent through the post; and I have told\r\nhim to reply to me in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel no anxiety about his answer--he can only answer in one way.\r\nI have asked for a little time to consider, because my family\r\ncircumstances require some consideration, in his interests as well as\r\nin mine. I have engaged to tell him what those circumstances are (what\r\nshall I say, I wonder?) when we next meet; and I have requested him in\r\nthe meantime to keep all that has passed between us a secret for the\r\npresent. As to what he is to do himself in the interval while I am\r\nsupposed to be considering, I have left it to his own discretion--merely\r\nreminding him that his attempting to see me again (while our positions\r\ntoward each other cannot be openly avowed) might injure my reputation.\r\nI have offered to write to him if he wishes it; and I have ended by\r\npromising to make the interval of our necessary separation as short as I\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis sort of plain, unaffected letter--which I might have written\r\nto him last night, if his story had not been running in my head as it\r\ndid--has one defect, I know. It certainly keeps him out of the way,\r\nwhile I am casting my net, and catching my gold fish at the great house\r\nfor the second time; but it also leaves an awkward day of reckoning to\r\ncome with Midwinter if I succeed. How am I to manage him? What am I to\r\ndo? I ought to face those two questions as boldly as usual; but somehow\r\nmy courage seems to fail me, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite fancy meeting _that_\r\ndifficulty, till the time comes when it _must_ be met. Shall I confess\r\nto my diary that I am sorry for Midwinter, and that I shrink a little\r\nfrom thinking of the day when he hears that I am going to be mistress at\r\nthe great house?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not mistress yet; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t take a step in the direction of\r\nthe great house till I have got the answer to my letter, and till I\r\nknow that Midwinter is out of the way. Patience! patience! I must go\r\nand forget myself at my piano. There is the \xe2\x80\x98Moonlight Sonata\xe2\x80\x99 open,\r\nand tempting me, on the music-stand. Have I nerve enough to play it, I\r\nwonder? Or will it set me shuddering with the mystery and terror of it,\r\nas it did the other day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--I have got his answer. The slightest request I can make\r\nis a command to him. He has gone; and he sends me his address in London.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are two considerations\xe2\x80\x99 (he says) \xe2\x80\x98which help to reconcile me to\r\nleaving you. The first is that _you_ wish it, and that it is only to\r\nbe for a little while. The second is that I think I can make some\r\narrangements in London for adding to my income by my own labor. I have\r\nnever cared for money for myself; but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I am beginning\r\nalready to prize the luxuries and refinements that money can provide,\r\nfor my wife\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x99 Poor fellow! I almost wish I had not written to him\r\nas I did; I almost wish I had not sent him away from me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy if Mother Oldershaw saw this page in my diary! I have had a\r\nletter from her this morning--a letter to remind me of my obligations,\r\nand to tell me she suspects things are all going wrong. Let her suspect!\r\nI shan\xe2\x80\x99t trouble myself to answer; I can\xe2\x80\x99t be worried with that old\r\nwretch in the state I am in now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a lovely afternoon--I want a walk--I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think of Midwinter.\r\nSuppose I put on my bonnet, and try my experiment at once at the great\r\nhouse? Everything is in my favor. There is no spy to follow me, and no\r\nlawyer to keep me out, this time. Am I handsome enough, to-day? Well,\r\nyes; handsome enough to be a match for a little dowdy, awkward, freckled\r\ncreature, who ought to be perched on a form at school, and strapped to a\r\nbackboard to straighten her crooked shoulders.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The nursery lisps out in all they utter;\r\n    Besides, they always smell of bread-and-butter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow admirably Byron has described girls in their teens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--I have just got back from Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s house. I have seen\r\nhim, and spoken to him; and the end of it may be set down in three plain\r\nwords. I have failed. There is no more chance of my being Mrs. Armadale\r\nof Thorpe Ambrose than there is of my being Queen of England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I write and tell Oldershaw? Shall I go back to London? Not till I\r\nhave had time to think a little. Not just yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me think; I have failed completely--failed, with all the\r\ncircumstances in favor of success. I caught him alone on the drive in\r\nfront of the house. He was excessively disconcerted, but at the same\r\ntime quite willing to hear me. I tried him, first quietly--then with\r\ntears, and the rest of it. I introduced myself in the character of the\r\npoor innocent woman whom he had been the means of injuring. I confused,\r\nI interested, I convinced him. I went on to the purely Christian part\r\nof my errand, and spoke with such feeling of his separation from his\r\nfriend, for which I was innocently responsible, that I turned his odious\r\nrosy face quite pale, and made him beg me at last not to distress him.\r\nBut, whatever other feelings I roused in him, I never once roused his\r\nold feeling for _me_. I saw it in his eyes when he looked at me; I felt\r\nit in his fingers when we shook hands. We parted friends, and nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is for this, is it, Miss Milroy, that I resisted temptation, morning\r\nafter morning, when I knew you were out alone in the park? I have just\r\nleft you time to slip in, and take my place in Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s good graces,\r\nhave I? I never resisted temptation yet without suffering for it in some\r\nsuch way as this! If I had only followed my first thoughts, on the day\r\nwhen I took leave of you, my young lady--well, well, never mind that\r\nnow. I have got the future before me; you are not Mrs. Armadale yet! And\r\nI can tell you one other thing--whoever else he marries, he will never\r\nmarry _you_. If I am even with you in no other way, trust me, whatever\r\ncomes of it, to be even with you there!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not, to my own surprise, in one of my furious passions. The last\r\ntime I was in this perfectly cool state, under serious provocation,\r\nsomething came of it, which I daren\xe2\x80\x99t write down, even in my own private\r\ndiary. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if something comes of it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my way back, I called at Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings in the town. He was\r\nnot at home, and I left a message telling him to come here to-night and\r\nspeak to me. I mean to relieve him at once of the duty of looking\r\nafter Armadale and Miss Milroy. I may not see my way yet to ruining her\r\nprospects at Thorpe Ambrose as completely as she has ruined mine. But\r\nwhen the time comes, and I do see it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know to what lengths\r\nmy sense of injury may take me; and there may be inconvenience, and\r\npossibly danger, in having such a chicken-hearted creature as Mr.\r\nBashwood in my confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspect I am more upset by all this than I supposed. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstory is beginning to haunt me again, without rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA soft, quick, trembling knock at the street door! I know who it is. No\r\nhand but old Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s could knock in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--I have just got rid of him. He has surprised me by\r\ncoming out in a new character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems (though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t detect him) that he was at the great house\r\nwhile I was in company with Armadale. He saw us talking on the drive,\r\nand he afterward heard what the servants said, who saw us too. The wise\r\nopinion below stairs is that we have \xe2\x80\x98made it up,\xe2\x80\x99 and that the master\r\nis likely to marry me after all. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s sweet on her red hair,\xe2\x80\x99 was the\r\nelegant expression they used in the kitchen. \xe2\x80\x98Little missie can\xe2\x80\x99t match\r\nher there; and little missie will get the worst of it.\xe2\x80\x99 How I hate the\r\ncoarse ways of the lower orders!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile old Bashwood was telling me this, I thought he looked even more\r\nconfused and nervous than usual. But I failed to see what was really\r\nthe matter until after I had told him that he was to leave all further\r\nobservation of Mr. Armadale and Miss Milroy to me. Every drop of the\r\nlittle blood there is in the feeble old creature\xe2\x80\x99s body seemed to fly up\r\ninto his face. He made quite an overpowering effort; he really looked as\r\nif he would drop down dead of fright at his own boldness; but he forced\r\nout the question for all that, stammering, and stuttering, and kneading\r\ndesperately with both hands at the brim of his hideous great hat. \xe2\x80\x98I beg\r\nyour pardon, Miss Gwi-Gwi-Gwilt! You are not really go-go-going to marry\r\nMr. Armadale, are you?\xe2\x80\x99 Jealous--if ever I saw it in a man\xe2\x80\x99s face yet, I\r\nsaw it in his--actually jealous of Armadale at his age! If I had been\r\nin the humor for it, I should have burst out laughing in his face. As it\r\nwas, I was angry, and lost all patience with him. I told him he was an\r\nold fool, and ordered him to go on quietly with his usual business until\r\nI sent him word that he was wanted again. He submitted as usual; but\r\nthere was an indescribable something in his watery old eyes, when he\r\ntook leave of me, which I have never noticed in them before. Love has\r\nthe credit of working all sorts of strange transformations. Can it be\r\nreally possible that Love has made Mr. Bashwood man enough to be angry\r\nwith me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWednesday.--My experience of Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s habits suggested a suspicion\r\nto me last night which I thought it desirable to clear up this morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was always her way, when I was at the cottage, to take a walk early\r\nin the morning before breakfast. Considering that I used often to choose\r\nthat very time for _my_ private meetings with Armadale, it struck me as\r\nlikely that my former pupil might be taking a leaf out of my book, and\r\nthat I might make some desirable discoveries if I turned my steps in the\r\ndirection of the major\xe2\x80\x99s garden at the right hour. I deprived myself\r\nof my Drops, to make sure of waking; passed a miserable night in\r\nconsequence; and was ready enough to get up at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and walk the\r\ndistance from my lodgings to the cottage in the fresh morning air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not been five minutes on the park side of the garden inclosure\r\nbefore I saw her come out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe seemed to have had a bad night too; her eyes were heavy and red,\r\nand her lips and cheeks looked swollen as if she had been crying. There\r\nwas something on her mind, evidently; something, as it soon appeared, to\r\ntake her out of the garden into the park. She walked (if one can call\r\nit walking; with such legs as hers!) straight to the summer house, and\r\nopened the door, and crossed the bridge, and went on quicker and quicker\r\ntoward the low ground in the park, where the trees are thickest.\r\nI followed her over the open space with perfect impunity in the\r\npreoccupied state she was in; and, when she began to slacken her pace\r\namong the trees, I was among the trees too, and was not afraid of her\r\nseeing me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore long, there was a crackling and trampling of heavy feet coming\r\nup toward us through the under-wood in a deep dip of the ground. I knew\r\nthat step as well as she knew it. \xe2\x80\x98Here I am,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, in a faint\r\nlittle voice. I kept behind the trees a few yards off, in some doubt\r\non which side Armadale would come out of the under-wood to join her. He\r\ncame out up the side of the dell, opposite to the tree behind which I\r\nwas standing. They sat down together on the bank. I sat down behind the\r\ntree, and looked at them through the under-wood, and heard without the\r\nslightest difficulty every word that they said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe talk began by his noticing that she looked out of spirits, and\r\nasking if anything had gone wrong at the cottage. The artful little minx\r\nlost no time in making the necessary impression on him; she began\r\nto cry. He took her hand, of course, and tried, in his brutishly\r\nstraightforward way, to comfort her. No; she was not to be comforted. A\r\nmiserable prospect was before her; she had not slept the whole night\r\nfor thinking of it. Her father had called her into his room the previous\r\nevening, had spoken about the state of her education, and had told her\r\nin so many words that she was to go to school. The place had been found,\r\nand the terms had been settled; and as soon as her clothes could be got\r\nready, miss was to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98While that hateful Miss Gwilt was in the house,\xe2\x80\x99 says this model young\r\nperson, \xe2\x80\x98I would have gone to school willingly--I wanted to go. But it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall different now; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it in the same way; I feel too old\r\nfor school. I\xe2\x80\x99m quite heart-broken, Mr. Armadale.\xe2\x80\x99 There she stopped\r\nas if she had meant to say more, and gave him a look which finished\r\nthe sentence plainly: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m quite heart-broken, Mr. Armadale, now we are\r\nfriendly again, at going away from you!\xe2\x80\x99 For downright brazen impudence,\r\nwhich a grown woman would be ashamed of, give me the young girls whose\r\n\xe2\x80\x98modesty\xe2\x80\x99 is so pertinaciously insisted on by the nauseous domestic\r\nsentimentalists of the present day!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven Armadale, booby as he is, understood her. After bewildering\r\nhimself in a labyrinth of words that led nowhere, he took her--one can\r\nhardly say round the waist, for she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got one--he took her round\r\nthe last hook-and-eye of her dress, and, by way of offering her a\r\nrefuge from the indignity of being sent to school at her age, made her a\r\nproposal of marriage in so many words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could have killed them both at that moment by lifting up my little\r\nfinger, I have not the least doubt I should have lifted it. As things\r\nwere, I only waited to see what Miss Milroy would do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe appeared to think it necessary--feeling, I suppose, that she had\r\nmet him without her father\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, and not forgetting that I\r\nhad had the start of her as the favored object of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nopinion--to assert herself by an explosion of virtuous indignation. She\r\nwondered how he could think of such a thing after his conduct with Miss\r\nGwilt, and after her father had forbidden him the house! Did he want to\r\nmake her feel how inexcusably she had forgotten what was due to herself?\r\nWas it worthy of a gentleman to propose what he knew as well as she did\r\nwas impossible? and so on, and so on. Any man with brains in his head\r\nwould have known what all this rodomontade really meant. Armadale took\r\nit so seriously that he actually attempted to justify himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe declared, in his headlong, blundering way, that he was quite in\r\nearnest; he and her father might make it up and be friends again; and,\r\nif the major persisted in treating him as a stranger, young ladies and\r\ngentlemen in their situation had made runaway marriages before now, and\r\nfathers and mothers who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forgive them before had forgiven them\r\nafterward. Such outrageously straightforward love-making as this left\r\nMiss Milroy, of course, but two alternatives--to confess that she\r\nhad been saying No when she meant Yes, or to take refuge in another\r\nexplosion. She was hypocrite enough to prefer another explosion. \xe2\x80\x98How\r\ndare you, Mr. Armadale? Go away directly! It\xe2\x80\x99s inconsiderate, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheartless, it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly disgraceful to say such things to me!\xe2\x80\x99 and so\r\non, and so on. It seems incredible, but it is not the less true, that\r\nhe was positively fool enough to take her at her word. He begged her\r\npardon, and went away like a child that is put in the corner--the most\r\ncontemptible object in the form of man that eyes ever looked on!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe waited, after he had gone, to compose herself, and I waited behind\r\nthe trees to see how she would succeed. Her eyes wandered round slyly\r\nto the path by which he had left her. She smiled (grinned would be the\r\ntruer way of putting it, with such a mouth as hers); took a few steps on\r\ntiptoe to look after him; turned back again, and suddenly burst into a\r\nviolent fit of crying. I am not quite so easily taken in as Armadale,\r\nand I saw what it all meant plainly enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought to myself, \xe2\x80\x98you will be in the park again, miss,\r\nby pure accident. The next day, you will lead him on into proposing\r\nto you for the second time. The day after, he will venture back to the\r\nsubject of runaway marriages, and you will only be becomingly confused.\r\nAnd the day after that, if he has got a plan to propose, and if your\r\nclothes are ready to be packed for school, you will listen to him.\xe2\x80\x99 Yes,\r\nyes; Time is always on the man\xe2\x80\x99s side, where a woman is concerned, if\r\nthe man is only patient enough to let Time help him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI let her leave the place and go back to the cottage, quite unconscious\r\nthat I had been looking at her. I waited among the trees, thinking. The\r\ntruth is, I was impressed by what I had heard and seen, in a manner that\r\nit is not very easy to describe. It put the whole thing before me in\r\na new light. It showed me--what I had never even suspected till this\r\nmorning--that she is really fond of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavy as my debt of obligation is to her, there is no fear _now_ of\r\nmy failing to pay it to the last farthing. It would have been no small\r\ntriumph for me to stand between Miss Milroy and her ambition to be one\r\nof the leading ladies of the county. But it is infinitely more, where\r\nher first love is concerned, to stand between Miss Milroy and her\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s desire. Shall I remember my own youth and spare her? No! She has\r\ndeprived me of the one chance I had of breaking the chain that binds me\r\nto a past life too horrible to be thought of. I am thrown back into a\r\nposition, compared to which the position of an outcast who walks the\r\nstreets is endurable and enviable. No, Miss Milroy--no, Mr. Armadale; I\r\nwill spare neither of you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been back some hours. I have been thinking, and nothing has come\r\nof it. Ever since I got that strange letter of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s last Sunday,\r\nmy usual readiness in emergencies has deserted me. When I am not\r\nthinking of him or of his story, my mind feels quite stupefied. I, who\r\nhave always known what to do on other occasions, don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do\r\nnow. It would be easy enough, of course, to warn Major Milroy of his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings. But the major is fond of his daughter; Armadale\r\nis anxious to be reconciled with him; Armadale is rich and prosperous,\r\nand ready to submit to the elder man; and sooner or later they will be\r\nfriends again, and the marriage will follow. Warning Major Milroy is\r\nonly the way to embarrass them for the present; it is not the way to\r\npart them for good and all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ the way? I can\xe2\x80\x99t see it. I could tear my own hair off my\r\nhead! I could burn the house down! If there was a train of gunpowder\r\nunder the whole world, I could light it, and blow the whole world to\r\ndestruction--I am in such a rage, such a frenzy with myself for not\r\nseeing it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear Midwinter! Yes, \xe2\x80\x98_dear_.\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I\xe2\x80\x99m lonely and\r\nhelpless. I want somebody who is gentle and loving to make much of me;\r\nI wish I had his head on my bosom again; I have a good mind to go to\r\nLondon and marry him. Am I mad? Yes; all people who are as miserable\r\nas I am are mad. I must go to the window and get some air. Shall I jump\r\nout? No; it disfigures one so, and the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s inquest lets so many\r\npeople see it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe air has revived me. I begin to remember that I have Time on my\r\nside, at any rate. Nobody knows but me of their secret meetings in the\r\npark the first thing in the morning. If jealous old Bashwood, who is\r\nslinking and sly enough for anything, tries to look privately after\r\nArmadale, in his own interests, he will try at the usual time when he\r\ngoes to the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office. He knows nothing of Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s early\r\nhabits; and he won\xe2\x80\x99t be on the spot till Armadale has got back to the\r\nhouse. For another week to come, I may wait and watch them, and choose\r\nmy own time and way of interfering the moment I see a chance of his\r\ngetting the better of her hesitation, and making her say Yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo here I wait, without knowing how things will end with Midwinter in\r\nLondon; with my purse getting emptier and emptier, and no appearance\r\nso far of any new pupils to fill it; with Mother Oldershaw certain to\r\ninsist on having her money back the moment she knows I have failed;\r\nwithout prospects, friends, or hopes of any kind--a lost woman, if ever\r\nthere was a lost woman yet. Well! I say it again and again and again--I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care! Here I stop, if I sell the clothes off my back, if I hire\r\nmyself at the public-house to play to the brutes in the tap-room; here I\r\nstop till the time comes, and I see the way to parting Armadale and Miss\r\nMilroy forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--Any signs that the time is coming yet? I hardly\r\nknow; there are signs of a change, at any rate, in my position in the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo of the oldest and ugliest of the many old and ugly ladies who\r\ntook up my case when I left Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s service have just called,\r\nannouncing themselves, with the insufferable impudence of charitable\r\nEnglishwomen, as a deputation from my patronesses. It seems that the\r\nnews of my reconciliation with Armadale has spread from the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\noffices at the great house, and has reached the town, with this result.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the unanimous opinion of my \xe2\x80\x98patronesses\xe2\x80\x99 (and the opinion of\r\nMajor Milroy also, who has been consulted) that I have acted with the\r\nmost inexcusable imprudence in going to Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s house, and in there\r\nspeaking on friendly terms with a man whose conduct toward myself\r\nhas made his name a by-word in the neighborhood. My total want of\r\nself-respect in this matter has given rise to a report that I am trading\r\nas cleverly as ever on my good looks, and that I am as likely as not\r\nto end in making Armadale marry me, after all. My \xe2\x80\x98patronesses\xe2\x80\x99 are, of\r\ncourse, too charitable to believe this. They merely feel it necessary\r\nto remonstrate with me in a Christian spirit, and to warn me that any\r\nsecond and similar imprudence on my part would force all my best friends\r\nin the place to withdraw the countenance and protection which I now\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving addressed me, turn and turn about, in these terms (evidently all\r\nrehearsed beforehand), my two Gorgon visitors straightened themselves\r\nin their chairs, and looked at me as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x98You may often have\r\nheard of Virtue, Miss Gwilt, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you ever really saw it\r\nin full bloom till we came and called on you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing they were bent on provoking me, I kept my temper, and answered\r\nthem in my smoothest, sweetest, and most lady-like manner. I have\r\nnoticed that the Christianity of a certain class of respectable people\r\nbegins when they open their prayer-books at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Sunday\r\nmorning, and ends when they shut them up again at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Sunday\r\nafternoon. Nothing so astonishes and insults Christians of this sort as\r\nreminding them of their Christianity on a week-day. On this hint, as the\r\nman says in the play, I spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What have I done that is wrong?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked, innocently. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Armadale\r\nhas injured me; and I have been to his house and forgiven him the\r\ninjury. Surely there must be some mistake, ladies? You can\xe2\x80\x99t have really\r\ncome here to remonstrate with me in a Christian spirit for performing an\r\nact of Christianity?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two Gorgons got up. I firmly believe some women have cats\xe2\x80\x99 tails as\r\nwell as cats\xe2\x80\x99 faces. I firmly believe the tails of those two particular\r\ncats wagged slowly under their petticoats, and swelled to four times\r\ntheir proper size.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Temper we were prepared for, Miss Gwilt,\xe2\x80\x99 they said, \xe2\x80\x98but not\r\nProfanity. We wish you good-evening.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they left me, and so \xe2\x80\x98Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99 sinks out of the patronizing\r\nnotice of the neighborhood\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what will come of this trumpery little quarrel? One thing will\r\ncome of it which I can see already. The report will reach Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears; she will insist on Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s justifying himself; and Armadale\r\nwill end in satisfying her of his innocence by making another proposal.\r\nThis will be quite likely to hasten matters between them; at least it\r\nwould with me. If I was in her place, I should say to myself, \xe2\x80\x98I will\r\nmake sure of him while I can.\xe2\x80\x99 Supposing it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rain to-morrow\r\nmorning, I think I will take another early walk in the direction of the\r\npark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMidnight.--As I can\xe2\x80\x99t take my drops, with a morning walk before me, I\r\nmay as well give up all hope of sleeping, and go on with my diary.\r\nEven with my drops, I doubt if my head would be very quiet on my\r\npillow to-night. Since the little excitement of the scene with my\r\n\xe2\x80\x98lady-patronesses\xe2\x80\x99 has worn off, I have been troubled with misgivings\r\nwhich would leave me but a poor chance, under any circumstances, of\r\ngetting much rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine why, but the parting words spoken to Armadale by that\r\nold brute of a lawyer have come back to my mind! Here they are, as\r\nreported in Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s letter: \xe2\x80\x98Some other person\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity may\r\ngo on from the point where you (and I) have stopped, and some other\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s hand may let the broad daylight in yet on Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he mean by that? And what did he mean afterward when he\r\novertook old Bashwood in the drive, by telling him to gratify his\r\ncuriosity? Does this hateful Pedgift actually suppose there is any\r\nchance--? Ridiculous! Why, I have only to _look_ at the feeble old\r\ncreature, and he daren\xe2\x80\x99t lift his little finger unless I tell him. _He_\r\ntry to pry into my past life, indeed! Why, people with ten times his\r\nbrains, and a hundred times his courage, have tried--and have left off\r\nas wise as they began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, though; it might have been better if I had kept my temper\r\nwhen Bashwood was here the other night. And it might be better still if\r\nI saw him to-morrow, and took him back into my good graces by giving\r\nhim something to do for me. Suppose I tell him to look after the\r\ntwo Pedgifts, and to discover whether there is any chance of their\r\nattempting to renew their connection with Armadale? No such thing is at\r\nall likely; but if I gave old Bashwood this commission, it would flatter\r\nhis sense of his own importance to me, and would at the same time serve\r\nthe excellent purpose of keeping him out of my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThursday morning, nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--I have just got back from the park.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor once I have proved a true prophet. There they were together, at\r\nthe same early hour, in the same secluded situation among the trees; and\r\nthere was miss in full possession of the report of my visit to the great\r\nhouse, and taking her tone accordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter saying one or two things about me, which I promise him not to\r\nforget, Armadale took the way to convince her of his constancy which I\r\nfelt beforehand he would be driven to take. He repeated his proposal\r\nof marriage, with excellent effect this time. Tears and kisses and\r\nprotestations followed; and my late pupil opened her heart at last, in\r\nthe most innocent manner. Home, she confessed, was getting so miserable\r\nto her now that it was only less miserable than going to school. Her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s temper was becoming more violent and unmanageable every day.\r\nThe nurse, who was the only person with any influence over her, had gone\r\naway in disgust. Her father was becoming more and more immersed in his\r\nclock, and was made more and more resolute to send her away from home by\r\nthe distressing scenes which now took place with her mother almost day\r\nby day. I waited through these domestic disclosures on the chance of\r\nhearing any plans they might have for the future discussed between them;\r\nand my patience, after no small exercise of it, was rewarded at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first suggestion (as was only natural where such a fool as Armadale\r\nwas concerned) came from the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe started an idea which I own I had not anticipated. She proposed\r\nthat Armadale should write to her father; and, cleverer still, she\r\nprevented all fear of his blundering by telling him what he was to say.\r\nHe was to express himself as deeply distressed at his estrangement from\r\nthe major, and to request permission to call at the cottage, and say a\r\nfew words in his own justification. That was all. The letter was not\r\nto be sent that day, for the applicants for the vacant place of Mrs.\r\nMilroy\xe2\x80\x99s nurse were coming, and seeing them and questioning them would\r\nput her father, with his dislike of such things, in no humor to receive\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s application indulgently. The Friday would be the day to send\r\nthe letter, and on the Saturday morning if the answer was unfortunately\r\nnot favorable, they might meet again, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like deceiving my father;\r\nhe has always been so kind to me. And there will be no need to deceive\r\nhim, Allan, if we can only make you friends again.\xe2\x80\x99 Those were the last\r\nwords the little hypocrite said, when I left them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will the major do? Saturday morning will show. I won\xe2\x80\x99t think of it\r\ntill Saturday morning has come and gone. They are not man and wife yet;\r\nand again and again I say it, though my brains are still as helpless as\r\never, man and wife they shall never be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my way home again, I caught Bashwood at his breakfast, with his poor\r\nold black tea-pot, and his little penny loaf, and his one cheap morsel\r\nof oily butter, and his darned dirty tablecloth. It sickens me to think\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI coaxed and comforted the miserable old creature till the tears stood\r\nin his eyes, and he quite blushed with pleasure. He undertakes to\r\nlook after the Pedgifts with the utmost alacrity. Pedgift the elder he\r\ndescribed, when once roused, as the most obstinate man living; nothing\r\nwill induce him to give way, unless Armadale gives way also on his side.\r\nPedgift the younger is much the more likely of the two to make attempts\r\nat a reconciliation. Such, at least, is Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. It is of\r\nvery little consequence now what happens either way. The only important\r\nthing is to tie my elderly admirer safely again to my apron-string. And\r\nthis is done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe post is late this morning. It has only just come in, and has\r\nbrought me a letter from Midwinter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a charming letter; it flatters me and flutters me as if I was a\r\nyoung girl again. No reproaches for my never having written to him; no\r\nhateful hurrying of me, in plain words, to marry him. He only writes\r\nto tell me a piece of news. He has obtained, through his lawyers, a\r\nprospect of being employed as occasional correspondent to a newspaper\r\nwhich is about to be started in London. The employment will require him\r\nto leave England for the Continent, which would exactly meet his own\r\nwishes for the future, but he cannot consider the proposal seriously\r\nuntil he has first ascertained whether it would meet my wishes too.\r\nHe knows no will but mine, and he leaves me to decide, after first\r\nmentioning the time allowed him before his answer must be sent in. It\r\nis the time, of course (if I agree to his going abroad), in which I must\r\nmarry him. But there is not a word about this in his letter. He asks for\r\nnothing but a sight of my handwriting to help him through the interval\r\nwhile we are separated from each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the letter; not very long, but so prettily expressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I can penetrate the secret of his fancy for going abroad. That\r\nwild idea of putting the mountains and the seas between Armadale and\r\nhimself is still in his mind. As if either he or I could escape doing\r\nwhat we are fated to do--supposing we really are fated--by putting a\r\nfew hundred or a few thousand miles between Armadale and ourselves! What\r\nstrange absurdity and inconsistency! And yet how I like him for being\r\nabsurd and inconsistent; for don\xe2\x80\x99t I see plainly that I am at the bottom\r\nof it all? Who leads this clever man astray in spite of himself? Who\r\nmakes him too blind to see the contradiction in his own conduct, which\r\nhe would see plainly in the conduct of another person? How interested\r\nI do feel in him! How dangerously near I am to shutting my eyes on the\r\npast, and letting myself love him! Was Eve fonder of Adam than ever, I\r\nwonder, after she had coaxed him into eating the apple? I should have\r\nquite doted on him if I had been in her place. (Memorandum: To write\r\nMidwinter a charming little letter on my side, with a kiss in it; and as\r\ntime is allowed him before he sends in his answer, to ask for time, too,\r\nbefore I tell him whether I will or will not go abroad.)\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--A tiresome visit from my landlady; eager for a little\r\ngossip, and full of news which she thinks will interest me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is acquainted, I find, with Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s late nurse; and she has\r\nbeen seeing her friend off at the station this afternoon. They talked,\r\nof course, of affairs at the cottage, and my name found its way into the\r\nconversation. I am quite wrong, it seems, if the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s authority is to\r\nbe trusted, in believing Miss Milroy to be responsible for sending Mr.\r\nArmadale to my reference in London. Miss Milroy really knew nothing\r\nabout it, and it all originated in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s mad jealousy of me. The\r\npresent wretched state of things at the cottage is due entirely to the\r\nsame cause. Mrs. Milroy is firmly persuaded that my remaining at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose is referable to my having some private means of communicating\r\nwith the major which it is impossible for her to discover. With this\r\nconviction in her mind, she has become so unmanageable that no\r\nperson, with any chance of bettering herself, could possibly remain in\r\nattendance on her; and sooner or later, the major, object to it as he\r\nmay, will be obliged to place her under proper medical care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the sum and substance of what the wearisome landlady, had to\r\ntell me. Unnecessary to say that I was not in the least interested\r\nby it. Even if the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s assertion is to be depended on--which\r\nI persist in doubting--it is of no importance now. I know that Miss\r\nMilroy, and nobody but Miss Milroy has utterly ruined my prospect of\r\nbecoming Mrs. Armadale of Thorpe Ambrose, and I care to know nothing\r\nmore. If her mother was really alone in the attempt to expose my false\r\nreference, her mother seems to be suffering for it, at any rate. And so\r\ngood-by to Mrs. Milroy; and Heaven defend me from any more last glimpses\r\nat the cottages seen through the medium of my landlady\xe2\x80\x99s spectacles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--Bashwood has just left me, having come with news from\r\nthe great house. Pedgift the younger has made his attempt at bringing\r\nabout a reconciliation this very day, and has failed. I am the sole\r\ncause of the failure. Armadale is quite willing to be reconciled if\r\nPedgift the elder will avoid all future occasion of disagreement between\r\nthem by never recurring to the subject of Miss Gwilt. This, however,\r\nhappens to be exactly the condition which Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s father--with his\r\nopinion of me and my doings--should consider it his duty to Armadale\r\n_not_ to accept. So lawyer and client remain as far apart as ever, and\r\nthe obstacle of the Pedgifts is cleared out of my way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might have been a very awkward obstacle, so far as Pedgift the elder\r\nis concerned, if one of his suggestions had been carried out; I mean,\r\nif an officer of the London police had been brought down here to look\r\nat me. It is a question, even now, whether I had better not take to the\r\nthick veil again, which I always wear in London and other large places.\r\nThe only difficulty is that it would excite remark in this inquisitive\r\nlittle town to see me wearing a thick veil, for the first time, in the\r\nsummer weather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is close on ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock; I have been dawdling over my diary longer\r\nthan I supposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo words can describe how weary and languid I feel. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I take my\r\nsleeping drops and go to bed? There is no meeting between Armadale\r\nand Miss Milroy to force me into early rising to-morrow morning. Am\r\nI trying, for the hundredth time, to see my way clearly into the\r\nfuture--trying, in my present state of fatigue, to be the quick-witted\r\nwoman I once was, before all these anxieties came together and\r\noverpowered me? or am I perversely afraid of my bed when I want it most?\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I am tired and miserable; I am looking wretchedly haggard\r\nand old. With a little encouragement, I might be fool enough to burst\r\nout crying. Luckily, there is no one to encourage me. What sort of a\r\nnight is it, I wonder?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cloudy night, with the moon showing at intervals, and the wind\r\nrising. I can just hear it moaning among the ins and outs of the\r\nunfinished cottages at the end of the street. My nerves must be a little\r\nshaken, I think. I was startled just now by a shadow on the wall. It was\r\nonly after a moment or two that I mustered sense enough to notice where\r\nthe candle was, and to see that the shadow was my own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShadows remind me of Midwinter; or, if the shadows don\xe2\x80\x99t, something\r\nelse does. I must have another look at his letter, and then I will\r\npositively go to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall end in getting fond of him. If I remain much longer in this\r\nlonely uncertain state--so irresolute, so unlike my usual self--I shall\r\nend in getting fond of him. What madness! As if _I_ could ever be really\r\nfond of a man again!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I took one of my sudden resolutions, and married him. Poor as\r\nhe is, he would give me a name and a position if I became his wife. Let\r\nme see how the name--his own name--would look, if I really did consent\r\nto it for mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Armadale!\xe2\x80\x99 Pretty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Allan Armadale!\xe2\x80\x99 Prettier still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy nerves _must_ be shaken. Here is my own handwriting startling me\r\nnow! It is so strange; it is enough to startle anybody. The similarity\r\nin the two names never struck me in this light before. Marry which of\r\nthe two I might, my name would, of course, be the same. I should have\r\nbeen Mrs. Armadale, if I had married the light-haired Allan at the great\r\nhouse. And I can be Mrs. Armadale still, if I marry the dark-haired\r\nAllan in London. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost maddening to write it down--to feel that\r\nsomething ought to come of it--and to find nothing come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow _can_ anything come of it? If I did go to London, and marry him\r\n(as of course I must marry him) under his real name, would he let me\r\nbe known by it afterward? With all his reasons for concealing his real\r\nname, he would insist--no, he is too fond of me to do that--he would\r\nentreat me to take the name which he has assumed. Mrs. Midwinter.\r\nHideous! Ozias, too, when I wanted to address him familiarly, as his\r\nwife should. Worse than hideous!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet there would be some reason for humoring him in this if he asked\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose the brute at the great house happened to leave this\r\nneighborhood as a single man; and suppose, in his absence, any of the\r\npeople who know him heard of a Mrs. Allan Armadale, they would set her\r\ndown at once as his wife. Even if they actually saw me--if I actually\r\ncame among them with that name, and if he was not present to contradict\r\nit--his own servants would be the first to say, \xe2\x80\x98We knew she would marry\r\nhim, after all!\xe2\x80\x99 And my lady-patronesses, who will be ready to believe\r\nanything of me now we have quarreled, would join the chorus _sotto\r\nvoce:_ \xe2\x80\x98Only think, my dear, the report that so shocked us actually\r\nturns out to be true!\xe2\x80\x99 No. If I marry Midwinter, I must either be\r\nperpetually putting my husband and myself in a false position--or I must\r\nleave his real name, his pretty, romantic name, behind me at the church\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband! As if I was really going to marry him! I am _not_ going to\r\nmarry him, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf-past ten.--Oh, dear! oh, dear! how my temples throb, and how hot\r\nmy weary eyes feel! There is the moon looking at me through the window.\r\nHow fast the little scattered clouds are flying before the wind! Now\r\nthey let the moon in; and now they shut the moon out. What strange\r\nshapes the patches of yellow light take, and lose again, all in a\r\nmoment! No peace and quiet for me, look where I may. The candle keeps\r\nflickering, and the very sky itself is restless to-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To bed! to bed!\xe2\x80\x99 as Lady Macbeth says. I wonder, by-the-by, what Lady\r\nMacbeth would have done in my position? She would have killed somebody\r\nwhen her difficulties first began. Probably Armadale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriday morning.--A night\xe2\x80\x99s rest, thanks again to my Drops. I went to\r\nbreakfast in better spirits, and received a morning welcome in the shape\r\nof a letter from Mrs. Oldershaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy silence has produced its effect on Mother Jezebel. She attributes\r\nit to the right cause, and she shows her claws at last. If I am not in\r\na position to pay my note of hand for thirty pounds, which is due on\r\nTuesday next, her lawyer is instructed to \xe2\x80\x98take the usual course.\xe2\x80\x99 _If_\r\nI am not in a position to pay it! Why, when I have settled to-day with\r\nmy landlord, I shall have barely five pounds left! There is not the\r\nshadow of a prospect between now and Tuesday of my earning any money;\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t possess a friend in this place who would trust me with\r\nsixpence. The difficulties that are swarming round me wanted but one\r\nmore to complete them, and that one has come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMidwinter would assist me, of course, if I could bring myself to ask\r\nhim for assistance. But _that_ means marrying him. Am I really desperate\r\nenough and helpless enough to end it in that way? No; not yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy head feels heavy; I must get out into the fresh air, and think about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--I believe I have caught the infection of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuperstition. I begin to think that events are forcing me nearer\r\nand nearer to some end which I don\xe2\x80\x99t see yet, but which I am firmly\r\npersuaded is now not far off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been insulted--deliberately insulted before witnesses--by Miss\r\nMilroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter walking, as usual, in the most unfrequented place I could pick\r\nout, and after trying, not very successfully, to think to some good\r\npurpose of what I am to do next, I remembered that I needed some\r\nnote-paper and pens, and went back to the town to the stationer\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\r\nIt might have been wiser to have sent for what I wanted. But I was weary\r\nof myself, and weary of my lonely rooms; and I did my own errand, for no\r\nbetter reason than that it was something to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had just got into the shop, and was asking for what I wanted, when\r\nanother customer came in. We both looked up, and recognized each other\r\nat the same moment: Miss Milroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman and a lad were behind the counter, besides the man who was\r\nserving me. The woman civilly addressed the new customer. \xe2\x80\x98What can we\r\nhave the pleasure of doing for you, miss?\xe2\x80\x99 After pointing it first by\r\nlooking me straight in the face, she answered, \xe2\x80\x98Nothing, thank you, at\r\npresent. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back when the shop is empty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went out. The three people in the shop looked at me in silence.\r\nIn silence, on my side, I paid for my purchases, and left the place. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how I might have felt if I had been in my usual spirits.\r\nIn the anxious, unsettled state I am in now, I can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, the girl\r\nstung me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the weakness of the moment (for it was nothing else), I was on the\r\npoint of matching her petty spitefulness by spitefulness quite as petty\r\non my side. I had actually got as far as the whole length of the street\r\non my way to the major\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, bent on telling him the secret of his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s morning walks, before my better sense came back to me. When\r\nI did cool down, I turned round at once, and took the way home. No, no,\r\nMiss Milroy; mere temporary mischief-making at the cottage, which would\r\nonly end in your father forgiving you, and in Armadale profiting by his\r\nindulgence, will nothing like pay the debt I owe you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t forget\r\nthat your heart is set on Armadale; and that the major, however he may\r\ntalk, has always ended hitherto in giving you your own way. My head may\r\nbe getting duller and duller, but it has not quite failed me yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime, there is Mother Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s letter waiting obstinately\r\nto be answered; and here am I, not knowing what to do about it yet.\r\nShall I answer it or not? It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter for the present; there are\r\nsome hours still to spare before the post goes out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I asked Armadale to lend me the money? I should enjoy getting\r\n_something_ out of him; and I believe, in his present situation with\r\nMiss Milroy, he would do anything to be rid of me. Mean enough this, on\r\nmy part. Pooh! When you hate and despise a man, as I hate and despise\r\nArmadale, who cares for looking mean in _his_ eyes?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet my pride--or my something else, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what--shrinks from\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf-past two--only half-past two. Oh, the dreadful weariness of these\r\nlong summer days! I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep thinking and thinking any longer; I must\r\ndo something to relieve my mind. Can I go to my piano? No; I\xe2\x80\x99m not fit\r\nfor it. Work? No; I shall get thinking again if I take to my needle. A\r\nman, in my place, would find refuge in drink. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a man, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndrink. I\xe2\x80\x99ll dawdle over my dresses, and put my things tidy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas an hour passed? More than an hour. It seems like a minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t look back through these leaves, but I know I wrote somewhere\r\nthat I felt myself getting nearer and nearer to some end that was still\r\nhidden from me. The end is hidden no longer. The cloud is off my mind,\r\nthe blindness has gone from my eyes. I see it! I see it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came to me--I never sought it. If I was lying on my death-bed, I\r\ncould swear, with a safe conscience, I never sought it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only looking over my things; I was as idly and as frivolously\r\nemployed as the most idle and most frivolous woman living. I went\r\nthrough my dresses, and my linen. What could be more innocent? Children\r\ngo through their dresses and their linen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was, such a long summer day, and I was so tired of myself. I went to\r\nmy boxes next. I looked over the large box first, which I usually leave\r\nopen; and then I tried the small box, which I always keep locked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom one thing to the other, I came at last to the bundle of letters\r\nat the bottom--the letters of the man for whom I once sacrificed and\r\nsuffered everything; the man who has made me what I am.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred times I had determined to burn his letters; but I have never\r\nburned them. This, time, all I said was, \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t read his letters!\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nI did read them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe villain--the false, cowardly, heartless villain--what have I to do\r\nwith his letters now? Oh, the misery of being a woman! Oh, the meanness\r\nthat our memory of a man can tempt us to, when our love for him is dead\r\nand gone! I read the letters--I was so lonely and so miserable, I read\r\nthe letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came to the last--the letter he wrote to encourage me, when I\r\nhesitated as the terrible time came nearer and nearer; the letter that\r\nrevived me when my resolution failed at the eleventh hour. I read on,\r\nline after line, till I came to these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98...I really have no patience with such absurdities as you have written\r\nto me. You say I am driving you on to do what is beyond a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourage. Am I? I might refer you to any collection of Trials, English or\r\nforeign, to show that you were utterly wrong. But such collections may\r\nbe beyond your reach; and I will only refer you to a case in\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper. The circumstances are totally different from our\r\ncircumstances; but the example of resolution in a woman is an example\r\nworth your notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You will find, among the law reports, a married woman charged with\r\nfraudulently representing herself to be the missing widow of an officer\r\nin the merchant service, who was supposed to have been drowned. The name\r\nof the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s husband (living) and the name of the officer (a very\r\ncommon one, both as to Christian and surname) happened to be identically\r\nthe same. There was money to be got by it (sorely wanted by the\r\nprisoner\xe2\x80\x99s husband, to whom she was devotedly attached), if the fraud\r\nhad succeeded. The woman took it all on herself. Her husband was\r\nhelpless and ill, and the bailiffs were after him. The circumstances,\r\nas you may read for yourself, were all in her favor, and were so well\r\nmanaged by her that the lawyers themselves acknowledged she might have\r\nsucceeded, if the supposed drowned man had not turned up alive and\r\nwell in the nick of time to confront her. The scene took place at the\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s office, and came out in the evidence at the police court. The\r\nwoman was handsome, and the sailor was a good-natured man. He wanted, at\r\nfirst, if the lawyers would have allowed him, to let her off. He said\r\nto her, among other things: \xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t count on the drowned man coming\r\nback, alive and hearty, did you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lucky for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t count on it. You have escaped the sea, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nescaped _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what would you have done, if you _had_ known I was\r\ncoming back?\xe2\x80\x9d says the sailor. She looked him steadily in the face, and\r\nanswered: \xe2\x80\x9cI would have killed you.\xe2\x80\x9d There! Do you think such a woman as\r\nthat would have written to tell me I was pressing her further than she\r\nhad courage to go? A handsome woman, too, like yourself. You would drive\r\nsome men in my position to wish they had her now in your place.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read no further. When I had got on, line by line, to those words, it\r\nburst on me like a flash of lightning. In an instant I saw it as plainly\r\nas I see it now. It is horrible, it is unheard of, it outdares all\r\ndaring; but, if I can only nerve myself to face one terrible necessity,\r\nit is to be done. _I may personate the richly provided widow of Allan\r\nArmadale of Thorpe Ambrose, if I can count on Allan Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s death in\r\na given time_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, in plain words, is the frightful temptation under which I now\r\nfeel myself sinking. It is frightful in more ways than one; for it has\r\ncome straight out of that other temptation to which I yielded in the\r\nby-gone time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; there the letter has been waiting for me in my box, to serve a\r\npurpose never thought of by the villain who wrote it. There is the Case,\r\nas he called it--only quoted to taunt me; utterly unlike my own case at\r\nthe time--there it has been, waiting and lurking for me through all the\r\nchanges in my life, till it has come to be like _my_ case at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might startle any woman to see this, and even this is not the worst.\r\nThe whole thing has been in my Diary, for days past, without my knowing\r\nit! Every idle fancy that escaped me has been tending secretly that one\r\nway! And I never saw, never suspected it, till the reading of the letter\r\nput my own thoughts before me in a new light--till I saw the shadow of\r\nmy own circumstances suddenly reflected in one special circumstance of\r\nthat other woman\xe2\x80\x99s case!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is to be done, if I can but look the necessity in the face. It is to\r\nbe done, _if I can count on Allan Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s death in a given time_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll but his death is easy. The whole series of events under which I\r\nhave been blindly chafing and fretting for more than a week past have\r\nbeen, one and all--though I was too stupid to see it--events in my\r\nfavor; events paving the way smoothly and more smoothly straight to the\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn three bold steps--only three!--that end might be reached. Let\r\nMidwinter marry me privately, under his real name--step the first! Let\r\nArmadale leave Thorpe Ambrose a single man, and die in some distant\r\nplace among strangers--step the second!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy am I hesitating? Why not go on to step the third, and last?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _will_ go on. Step the third, and last, is my appearance, after the\r\nannouncement of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s death has reached this neighborhood, in the\r\ncharacter of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow, with my marriage certificate in my hand\r\nto prove my claim. It is as clear as the sun at noonday. Thanks to the\r\nexact similarity between the two names, and thanks to the careful manner\r\nin which the secret of that similarity has been kept, I may be the wife\r\nof the dark Allan Armadale, known as such to nobody but my husband and\r\nmyself; and I may, out of that very position, claim the character of\r\nwidow of the light Allan Armadale, with proof to support me (in the\r\nshape of my marriage certificate) which would be proof in the estimation\r\nof the most incredulous person living.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think of my having put all this in my Diary! To think of my having\r\nactually contemplated this very situation, and having seen nothing\r\nmore in it, at the time, than a reason (if I married Midwinter) for\r\nconsenting to appear in the world under my husband\xe2\x80\x99s assumed name!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it daunts me? The dread of obstacles? The fear of discovery?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the obstacles? Where is the fear of discovery?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am actually suspected all over the neighborhood of intriguing to be\r\nmistress of Thorpe Ambrose. I am the only person who knows the real turn\r\nthat Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s inclinations have taken. Not a creature but myself is\r\nas yet aware of his early morning meetings with Miss Milroy. If it is\r\nnecessary to part them, I can do it at any moment by an anonymous line\r\nto the major. If it is necessary to remove Armadale from Thorpe Ambrose,\r\nI can get him away at three days\xe2\x80\x99 notice. His own lips informed me, when\r\nI last spoke to him, that he would go to the ends of the earth to be\r\nfriends again with Midwinter, if Midwinter would let him. I have only\r\nto tell Midwinter to write from London, and ask to be reconciled;\r\nand Midwinter would obey me--and to London Armadale would go. Every\r\ndifficulty, at starting, is smoothed over ready to my hand.\r\nEvery after-difficulty I could manage for myself. In the whole\r\nventure--desperate as it looks to pass myself off for the widow of one\r\nman, while I am all the while the wife of the other--there is absolutely\r\nno necessity that wants twice considering, but the one terrible\r\nnecessity of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis death! It might be a terrible necessity to any other woman; but is\r\nit, ought it to be terrible to Me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate him for his mother\xe2\x80\x99s sake. I hate him for his own sake. I hate\r\nhim for going to London behind my back, and making inquiries about me.\r\nI hate him for forcing me out of my situation before I wanted to go. I\r\nhate him for destroying all my hopes of marrying him, and throwing me\r\nback helpless on my own miserable life. But, oh, after what I have done\r\nalready in the past time, how can I? how can I?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girl, too--the girl who has come between us; who has taken him away\r\nfrom me; who has openly insulted me this very day--how the girl whose\r\nheart is set on him would feel it if he died! What a vengeance on _her_,\r\nif I did it! And when I was received as Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow what a triumph\r\nfor _me_. Triumph! It is more than triumph--it is the salvation of me.\r\nA name that can\xe2\x80\x99t be assailed, a station that can\xe2\x80\x99t be assailed, to\r\nhide myself in from my past life! Comfort, luxury, wealth! An income\r\nof twelve hundred a year secured to me secured by a will which has been\r\nlooked at by a lawyer: secured independently of anything Armadale can\r\nsay or do himself! I never had twelve hundred a year. At my luckiest\r\ntime, I never had half as much, really my own. What have I got now? Just\r\nfive pounds left in the world--and the prospect next week of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, oh, after what I have done already in the past time, how can I?\r\nhow can I?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome women--in my place, and with my recollections to look back\r\non--would feel it differently. Some women would say, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s easier the\r\nsecond time than the first.\xe2\x80\x99 Why can\xe2\x80\x99t I? why can\xe2\x80\x99t I?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you Devil tempting me, is there no Angel near to raise some timely\r\nobstacle between this and to-morrow which might help me to give it up?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall sink under it--I shall sink, if I write or think of it any\r\nmore! I\xe2\x80\x99ll shut up these leaves and go out again. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get some common\r\nperson to come with me, and we will talk of common things. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take out\r\nthe woman of the house, and her children. We will go and see something.\r\nThere is a show of some kind in the town--I\xe2\x80\x99ll treat them to it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nsuch an ill-natured woman when I try; and the landlady has really been\r\nkind to me. Surely I might occupy my mind a little in seeing her and her\r\nchildren enjoying themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA minute since, I shut up these leaves as I said I would; and now I\r\nhave opened them again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. I think my brain is turned.\r\nI feel as if something was lost out of my mind; I feel as if I ought to\r\nfind it here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found it! _Midwinter!!!_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that I can have been thinking of the reasons For and\r\nAgainst, for an hour past--writing Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s name over and over\r\nagain--speculating seriously on marrying him--and all the time not once\r\nremembering that, even with every other impediment removed, _he_ alone,\r\nwhen the time came, would be an insurmountable obstacle in my way? Has\r\nthe effort to face the consideration of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s death absorbed me to\r\n_that_ degree? I suppose it has. I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for such extraordinary\r\nforgetfulness on my part in any other way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I stop and think it out, as I have thought out all the rest?\r\nShall I ask myself if the obstacle of Midwinter would, after all, when\r\nthe time came, be the unmanageable obstacle that it looks at present?\r\nNo! What need is there to think of it? I have made up my mind to get the\r\nbetter of the temptation. I have made up my mind to give my landlady\r\nand her children a treat; I have made up my mind to close my Diary. And\r\nclosed it shall be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--The landlady\xe2\x80\x99s gossip is unendurable; the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchildren distract me. I have left them to run back here before post time\r\nand write a line to Mrs. Oldershaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dread that I shall sink under the temptation has grown stronger and\r\nstronger on me. I have determined to put it beyond my power to have my\r\nown way and follow my own will. Mother Oldershaw shall be the salvation\r\nof me for the first time since I have known her. If I can\xe2\x80\x99t pay my note\r\nof hand, she threatens me with an arrest. Well, she _shall_ arrest me.\r\nIn the state my mind is in now, the best thing that can happen to me is\r\nto be taken away from Thorpe Ambrose, whether I like it or not. I will\r\nwrite and say that I am to be found here I will write and tell her, in\r\nso many words, that the best service she can render me is to lock me up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--The letter has gone to the post. I had begun to feel a\r\nlittle easier, when the children came in to thank me for taking them to\r\nthe show. One of them is a girl, and the girl upset me. She is a forward\r\nchild, and her hair is nearly the color of mine. She said, \xe2\x80\x98I shall\r\nbe like you when I have grown bigger, shan\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99 Her idiot of a mother\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Please to excuse her, miss,\xe2\x80\x99 and took her out of the room,\r\nlaughing. Like me! I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be fond of the child; but think of\r\nher being like me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaturday morning.--I have done well for once in acting on impulse, and\r\nwriting as I did to Mrs. Oldershaw. The only new circumstance that has\r\nhappened is another circumstance in my favor!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor Milroy has answered Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s letter, entreating permission\r\nto call at the cottage and justify himself. His daughter read it in\r\nsilence, when Armadale handed it to her at their meeting this morning,\r\nin the park. But they talked about it afterward, loud enough for me to\r\nhear them. The major persists in the course he has taken. He says his\r\nopinion of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s conduct has been formed, not on common report, but\r\non Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s own letters, and he sees no reason to alter the conclusion\r\nat which he arrived when the correspondence between them was closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis little matter had, I confess, slipped out of my memory. It might\r\nhave ended awkwardly for _me_. If Major Milroy had been less obstinately\r\nwedded to his own opinion, Armadale might have justified himself; the\r\nmarriage engagement might have been acknowledged; and all _my_ power of\r\ninfluencing the matter might have been at an end. As it is, they must\r\ncontinue to keep the engagement strictly secret; and Miss Milroy, who\r\nhas never ventured herself near the great house since the thunder-storm\r\nforced her into it for shelter, will be less likely than ever to venture\r\nthere now. I can part them when I please; with an anonymous line to the\r\nmajor, I can part them when I please!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter having discussed the letter, the talk between them turned on\r\nwhat they were to do next. Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s severity, as it soon appeared,\r\nproduced the usual results. Armadale returned to the subject of the\r\nelopement; and this time she listened to him. There is everything to\r\ndrive her to it. Her outfit of clothes is nearly ready; and the summer\r\nholidays, at the school which has been chosen for her, end at the end of\r\nnext week. When I left them, they had decided to meet again and settle\r\nsomething on Monday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last words I heard him address to her, before I went away, shook\r\nme a little. He said: \xe2\x80\x98There is one difficulty, Neelie, that needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrouble us, at any rate. I have got plenty of money.\xe2\x80\x99 And then he kissed\r\nher. The way to his life began to look an easier way to me when he\r\ntalked of his money, and kissed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome hours have passed, and the more I think of it, the more I fear the\r\nblank interval between this time and the time when Mrs. Oldershaw calls\r\nin the law, and protects me against myself. It might have been better\r\nif I had stopped at home this morning. But how could I? After the insult\r\nshe offered me yesterday, I tingled all over to go and look at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day; Sunday; Monday; Tuesday. They can\xe2\x80\x99t arrest me for the money\r\nbefore Wednesday. And my miserable five pounds are dwindling to four!\r\nAnd he told her he had plenty of money! And she blushed and trembled\r\nwhen he kissed her. It might have been better for him, better for her,\r\nand better for me, if my debt had fallen due yesterday, and if the\r\nbailiffs had their hands on me at this moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I had the means of leaving Thorpe Ambrose by the next train,\r\nand going somewhere abroad, and absorbing myself in some new interest,\r\namong new people. Could I do it, rather than look again at that easy way\r\nto his life which would smooth the way to everything else?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I might. But where is the money to come from? Surely some\r\nway of getting it struck me a day or two since? Yes; that mean idea of\r\nasking Armadale to help me! Well; I _will_ be mean for once. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give\r\nhim the chance of making a generous use of that well-filled purse which\r\nit is such a comfort to him to reflect on in his present circumstances.\r\nIt would soften my heart toward any man if he lent me money in my\r\npresent extremity; and, if Armadale lends me money, it might soften my\r\nheart toward him. When shall I go? At once! I won\xe2\x80\x99t give myself time to\r\nfeel the degradation of it, and to change my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree \xe2\x80\x98clock.--I mark the hour. He has sealed his own doom. He has\r\ninsulted me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! I have suffered it once from Miss Milroy. And I have now suffered\r\nit a second time from Armadale himself. An insult--a marked, merciless,\r\ndeliberate insult in the open day!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had got through the town, and had advanced a few hundred yards along\r\nthe road that leads to the great house, when I saw Armadale at a little\r\ndistance, coming toward me. He was walking fast--evidently with some\r\nerrand of his own to take him to the town. The instant he caught sight\r\nof me he stopped, colored up, took off his hat, hesitated, and turned\r\naside down a lane behind him, which I happen to know would take him\r\nexactly in the contrary direction to the direction in which he was\r\nwalking when he first saw me. His conduct said in so many words, \xe2\x80\x98Miss\r\nMilroy may hear of it; I daren\xe2\x80\x99t run the risk of being seen speaking to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99 Men have used me heartlessly; men have done and said hard things\r\nto me; but no man living ever yet treated me as if I was plague-struck,\r\nand as if the very air about me was infected by my presence!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say no more. When he walked away from me down that lane, he walked to\r\nhis death. I have written to Midwinter to expect me in London nest week,\r\nand to be ready for our marriage soon afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--Half an hour since, I put on my bonnet to go out and\r\npost the letter to Midwinter myself. And here I am, still in my room,\r\nwith my mind torn by doubts, and my letter on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale counts for nothing in the perplexities that are now torturing\r\nme. It is Midwinter who makes me hesitate. Can I take the first of\r\nthose three steps that lead me to the end, without the common caution\r\nof looking at consequences? Can I marry Midwinter, without knowing\r\nbeforehand how to meet the obstacle of my husband, when the time\r\ncomes which transforms me from the living Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s wife to the dead\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t I think of it, when I know I _must_ think of it? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI look at it as steadily as I have looked at all the rest? I feel his\r\nkisses on my lips; I feel his tears on my bosom; I feel his arms round\r\nme again. He is far away in London; and yet, he is here and won\xe2\x80\x99t let me\r\nthink of it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t I wait a little? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t I let Time help me? Time? It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSaturday! What need is there to think of it, unless I like? There is\r\nno post to London to-day. I _must_ wait. If I posted the letter, it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go. Besides, to-morrow I may hear from Mrs. Oldershaw. I ought\r\nto wait to hear from Mrs. Oldershaw. I can\xe2\x80\x99t consider myself a free\r\nwoman till I know what Mrs. Oldershaw means to do. There is a necessity\r\nfor waiting till to-morrow. I shall take my bonnet off, and lock the\r\nletter up in my desk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSunday morning.--There is no resisting it! One after another the\r\ncircumstances crowd on me. They come thicker and thicker, and they all\r\nforce me one way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got Mother Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s answer. The wretch fawns on me, and\r\ncringes to me. I can see, as plainly as if she had acknowledged it,\r\nthat she suspects me of seeing my own way to success at Thorpe Ambrose\r\nwithout her assistance. Having found threatening me useless, she tries\r\ncoaxing me now. I am her darling Lydia again! She is quite shocked that\r\nI could imagine she ever really intended to arrest her bosom friend; and\r\nshe has only to entreat me, as a favor to herself, to renew the bill!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say once more, no mortal creature could resist it! Time after time\r\nI have tried to escape the temptation; and time after time the\r\ncircumstances drive me back again. I can struggle no longer. The post\r\nthat takes the letters to-night shall take my letter to Midwinter among\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night! If I give myself till to-night, something else may happen.\r\nIf I give myself till to-night, I may hesitate again. I\xe2\x80\x99m weary of the\r\ntorture of hesitating. I must and will have relief in the present, cost\r\nwhat it may in the future. My letter to Midwinter will drive me mad if I\r\nsee it staring and staring at me in my desk any longer. I can post it in\r\nten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 time--and I will!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is done. The first of the three steps that lead me to the end is a\r\nstep taken. My mind is quieter--the letter is in the post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy to-morrow Midwinter will receive it. Before the end of the week\r\nArmadale must be publicly seen to leave Thorpe Ambrose; and I must be\r\npublicly seen to leave with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I looked at the consequences of my marriage to Midwinter? No! Do\r\nI know how to meet the obstacle of my husband, when the time comes which\r\ntransforms me from the living Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s wife to the dead Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwidow?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! When the time comes, I must meet the obstacle as I best may. I\r\nam going blindfold, then--so far as Midwinter is concerned--into this\r\nfrightful risk? Yes; blindfold. Am I out of my senses? Very likely. Or\r\nam I a little too fond of him to look the thing in the face? I dare say.\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t, I won\xe2\x80\x99t, I won\xe2\x80\x99t think of it! Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I a will of my own? And\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t I think, if I like, of something else?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is Mother Jezebel\xe2\x80\x99s cringing letter. _That_ is something else to\r\nthink of. I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer it. I am in a fine humor for writing to Mother\r\nJezebel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n_Conclusion of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s Letter to Mrs. Oldershaw_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c...I told you, when I broke off, that I would wait before I finished\r\nthis, and ask my Diary if I could safely tell you what I have now got\r\nit in my mind to do. Well, I have asked; and my Diary says, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x99 Under these circumstances I close my letter--with my best excuses\r\nfor leaving you in the dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall probably be in London before long--and I may tell you by word\r\nof mouth what I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it safe to write here. Mind, I make no\r\npromise! It all depends on how I feel toward you at the time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndoubt your discretion; but (under certain circumstances) I am not so\r\nsure of your courage. L. G.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP. S.--My best thanks for your permission to renew the bill. I decline\r\nprofiting by the proposal. The money will be ready when the money is\r\ndue. I have a friend now in London who will pay it if I ask him. Do you\r\nwonder who the friend is? You will wonder at one or two other things,\r\nMrs. Oldershaw, before many weeks more are over your head and mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. LOVE AND LAW.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Monday, the 28th of July, Miss Gwilt--once more on the\r\nwatch for Allan and Neelie--reached her customary post of observation in\r\nthe park, by the usual roundabout way.\r\n\r\nShe was a little surprised to find Neelie alone at the place of meeting.\r\nShe was more seriously astonished, when the tardy Allan made his\r\nappearance ten minutes later, to see him mounting the side of the dell,\r\nwith a large volume under his arm, and to hear him say, as an apology\r\nfor being late, that \xe2\x80\x9che had muddled away his time in hunting for the\r\nBooks; and that he had only found one, after all, which seemed in\r\nthe least likely to repay either Neelie or himself for the trouble of\r\nlooking into it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Miss Gwilt had waited long enough in the park, on the previous\r\nSaturday, to hear the lovers\xe2\x80\x99 parting words on that occasion, she would\r\nhave been at no loss to explain the mystery of the volume under Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm, and she would have understood the apology which he now offered for\r\nbeing late as readily as Neelie herself.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain exceptional occasion in life--the occasion of\r\nmarriage--on which even girls in their teens sometimes become capable\r\n(more or less hysterically) of looking at consequences. At the farewell\r\nmoment of the interview on Saturday, Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s mind had suddenly\r\nprecipitated itself into the future; and she had utterly confounded\r\nAllan by inquiring whether the contemplated elopement was an offense\r\npunishable by the Law? Her memory satisfied her that she had certainly\r\nread somewhere, at some former period, in some book or other (possibly a\r\nnovel), of an elopement with a dreadful end--of a bride dragged home in\r\nhysterics--and of a bridegroom sentenced to languish in prison, with\r\nall his beautiful hair cut off, by Act of Parliament, close to his\r\nhead. Supposing she could bring herself to consent to the elopement at\r\nall--which she positively declined to promise--she must first insist on\r\ndiscovering whether there was any fear of the police being concerned in\r\nher marriage as well as the parson and the clerk. Allan, being a man,\r\nought to know; and to Allan she looked for information--with this\r\npreliminary assurance to assist him in laying down the law, that she\r\nwould die of a broken heart a thousand times over, rather than be the\r\ninnocent means of sending him to languish in prison, and of cutting his\r\nhair off, by Act of Parliament, close to his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no laughing\r\nmatter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie, resolutely, in conclusion; \xe2\x80\x9cI decline even to\r\nthink of our marriage till my mind is made easy first on the subject of\r\nthe Law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about the law, not even as much as you do,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cHang the law! I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my head being cropped. Let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrisk it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRisk it?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Neelie, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you no consideration for\r\nme? I won\xe2\x80\x99t risk it! Where there\xe2\x80\x99s a will, there\xe2\x80\x99s a way. We must find\r\nout the law for ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of books, to be sure! There must be quantities of information in\r\nthat enormous library of yours at the great house. If you really love\r\nme, you won\xe2\x80\x99t mind going over the backs of a few thousand books, for my\r\nsake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go over the backs of ten thousand!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cWould\r\nyou mind telling me what I\xe2\x80\x99m to look for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor \xe2\x80\x98Law,\xe2\x80\x99 to be sure! When it says \xe2\x80\x98Law\xe2\x80\x99 on the back, open it, and\r\nlook inside for Marriage--read every word of it--and then come here and\r\nexplain it to me. What! you don\xe2\x80\x99t think your head is to be trusted to do\r\nsuch a simple thing as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m certain it isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I can, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t manage without me! Law may be hard, but\r\nit can\xe2\x80\x99t be harder than music; and I must, and will, satisfy my\r\nmind. Bring me all the books you can find, on Monday morning--in a\r\nwheelbarrow, if there are a good many of them, and if you can\xe2\x80\x99t manage\r\nit in any other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe result of this conversation was Allan\xe2\x80\x99s appearance in the park, with\r\na volume of Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s Commentaries under his arm, on the fatal Monday\r\nmorning, when Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s written engagement of marriage was placed in\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Here again, in this, as in all other human instances,\r\nthe widely discordant elements of the grotesque and the terrible were\r\nforced together by that subtle law of contrast which is one of the laws\r\nof mortal life. Amid all the thickening complications now impending over\r\ntheir heads--with the shadow of meditated murder stealing toward one\r\nof them already from the lurking-place that hid Miss Gwilt--the two sat\r\ndown, unconscious of the future, with the book between them; and applied\r\nthemselves to the study of the law of marriage, with a grave resolution\r\nto understand it, which, in two such students, was nothing less than a\r\nburlesque in itself!\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind the place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie, as soon as they were comfortably\r\nestablished. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must manage this by what they call a division of labor.\r\nYou shall read, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take notes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe produced forthwith a smart little pocket-book and pencil, and opened\r\nthe book in the middle, where there was a blank page on the right hand\r\nand the left. At the top of the right-hand page she wrote the word\r\n_Good_. At the top of the left-hand page she wrote the word _Bad_.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Good\xe2\x80\x99 means where the law is on our side,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bad\xe2\x80\x99 means where the law is against us. We will have \xe2\x80\x98Good\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Bad\xe2\x80\x99\r\nopposite each other, all down the two pages; and when we get to the\r\nbottom, we\xe2\x80\x99ll add them up, and act accordingly. They say girls have no\r\nheads for business. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t they! Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me--look at Blackstone,\r\nand begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind giving one a kiss first?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should mind it very much. In our serious situation, when we have both\r\ngot to exert our intellects, I wonder you can ask for such a thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I asked for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the unblushing Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel as if it\r\nwould clear my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if it would clear your head, that\xe2\x80\x99s quite another thing! I must\r\nclear your head, of course, at any sacrifice. Only one, mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered, coquettishly; \xe2\x80\x9cand pray be careful of Blackstone, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlose the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause in the conversation. Blackstone and the pocket-book\r\nboth rolled on the ground together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this happens again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie, picking up the pocket-book, with\r\nher eyes and her complexion at their brightest and best, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall sit\r\nwith my back to you for the rest of the morning. _Will_ you go on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan found his place for the second time, and fell headlong into the\r\nbottomless abyss of the English Law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPage 280,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cLaw of husband and wife. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a bit I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand, to begin with: \xe2\x80\x98It may be observed generally that the law\r\nconsiders marriage in the light of a Contract.\xe2\x80\x99 What does that mean?\r\nI thought a contract was the sort of a thing a builder signs when he\r\npromises to have the workmen out of the house in a given time, and when\r\nthe time comes (as my poor mother used to say) the workmen never go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there nothing about Love?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neelie. \xe2\x80\x9cLook a little lower down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word. He sticks to his confounded \xe2\x80\x98Contract\xe2\x80\x99 all the way\r\nthrough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he\xe2\x80\x99s a brute! Go on to something else that\xe2\x80\x99s more in our way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a bit that\xe2\x80\x99s more in our way: \xe2\x80\x98Incapacities. If any persons\r\nunder legal incapacities come together, it is a meretricious, and not a\r\nmatrimonial union.\xe2\x80\x99 (Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s a good one at long words, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\r\nI wonder what he means by meretricious?) \xe2\x80\x98The first of these legal\r\ndisabilities is a prior marriage, and having another husband or wife\r\nliving--\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie; \xe2\x80\x9cI must make a note of that.\xe2\x80\x9d She gravely made her\r\nfirst entry on the page headed \xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cI have no husband,\r\nand Allan has no wife. We are both entirely unmarried at the present\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, so far,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Allan, looking over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The next disability,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Allan, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98is want of age. The age\r\nfor consent to matrimony is, fourteen in males, and twelve in females.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCome!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cBlackstone begins early enough, at any\r\nrate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeelie was too business-like to make any other remark, on her side, than\r\nthe necessary remark in the pocket-book. She made another entry under\r\nthe head of \xe2\x80\x9cGood\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cI am old enough to consent, and so is Allan too. Go\r\non,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Neelie, looking over the reader\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind\r\nall that prosing of Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s, about the husband being of years of\r\ndiscretion, and the wife under twelve. Abominable wretch! the wife under\r\ntwelve! Skip to the third incapacity, if there is one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The third incapacity,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Allan went on, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98is want of reason.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeelie immediately made a third entry on the side of \xe2\x80\x9cGood\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cAllan and\r\nI are both perfectly reasonable. Skip to the next page.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan skipped. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A fourth incapacity is in respect of proximity of\r\nrelationship.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fourth entry followed instantly on the cheering side of the\r\npocket-book: \xe2\x80\x9cHe loves me, and I love him--without our being in the\r\nslightest degree related to each other. Any more?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neelie, tapping\r\nher chin impatiently with the end of the pencil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty more,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Allan; \xe2\x80\x9call in hieroglyphics. Look here:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marriage Acts, 4 Geo. IV., c. 76, and 6 and 7 Will. IV., c. 85 (_q_).\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBlackstone\xe2\x80\x99s intellect seems to be wandering here. Shall we take another\r\nskip, and see if he picks himself up again on the next page?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s that I see in the middle?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nread for a minute in silence, over Allan\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and suddenly\r\nclasped her hands in despair. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew I was right!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nheavens, here it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI see nothing about languishing in prison,\r\nand cropping a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s hair close to his head, unless it\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\nhieroglyphics. Is \xe2\x80\x984 Geo. IV.\xe2\x80\x99 short for \xe2\x80\x98Lock him up\xe2\x80\x99? and does \xe2\x80\x98c. 85\r\n(_q_)\xe2\x80\x99 mean, \xe2\x80\x98Send for the hair-cutter\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray be serious,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Neelie. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are both sitting on a\r\nvolcano. There,\xe2\x80\x9d she said pointing to the place. \xe2\x80\x9cRead it! If anything\r\ncan bring you to a proper sense of our situation, _that_ will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan cleared his throat, and Neelie held the point of her pencil ready\r\non the depressing side of the account--otherwise the \xe2\x80\x9cBad\xe2\x80\x9d page of the\r\npocket-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And as it is the policy of our law,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Allan began, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98to prevent the\r\nmarriage of persons under the age of twenty-one, without the consent\r\nof parents and guardians\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d--(Neelie made her first entry on the side of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only seventeen next birthday, and circumstances forbid me\r\nto confide my attachment to papa\xe2\x80\x9d)--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98it is provided that in the case\r\nof the publication of banns of a person under twenty-one, not being a\r\nwidower or widow, who are deemed emancipated\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d--(Neelie made another\r\nentry on the depressing side: \xe2\x80\x9cAllan is not a widower, and I am not a\r\nwidow; consequently, we are neither of us emancipated\xe2\x80\x9d)--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98if the parent\r\nor guardian openly signifies his dissent at the time the banns are\r\npublished\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d--(\xe2\x80\x9cwhich papa would be certain to do\xe2\x80\x9d)--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98such publication\r\nwould be void.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take breath here if you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlackstone might put it in shorter sentences, I think, if he can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nput it in fewer words. Cheer up, Neelie! there must be other ways of\r\nmarrying, besides this roundabout way, that ends in a Publication and a\r\nVoid. Infernal gibberish! I could write better English myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not at the end of it yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Void is nothing to\r\nwhat is to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever it is,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll treat it like a dose of\r\nphysic--we\xe2\x80\x99ll take it at once, and be done with it.\xe2\x80\x9d He went on reading:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And no license to marry without banns shall be granted, unless oath\r\nshall be first made by one of the parties that he or she believes that\r\nthere is no impediment of kindred or alliance\xe2\x80\x99--well, I can take my oath\r\nof that with a safe conscience! What next? \xe2\x80\x98And one of the said parties\r\nmust, for the space of fifteen days immediately preceding such license,\r\nhave had his or her usual place of abode within the parish or chapelry\r\nwithin which such marriage is to be solemnized!\xe2\x80\x99 Chapelry! I\xe2\x80\x99d live\r\nfifteen days in a dog-kennel with the greatest pleasure. I say, Neelie,\r\nall this seems like plain sailing enough. What are you shaking your head\r\nabout? Go on, and I shall see? Oh, all right; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on. Here we are:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And where one of the said parties, not being a widower or widow, shall\r\nbe under the age of twenty-one years, oath must first be made that the\r\nconsent of the person or persons whose consent is required has been\r\nobtained, or that there is no person having authority to give such\r\nconsent. The consent required by this act is that of the father--\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d At\r\nthose last formidable words Allan came to a full stop. \xe2\x80\x9cThe consent\r\nof the father,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, with all needful seriousness of look and\r\nmanner. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly swear to that, could I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeelie answered in expressive silence. She handed him the pocket-book,\r\nwith the final entry completed, on the side of \xe2\x80\x9cBad,\xe2\x80\x9d in these terms:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur marriage is impossible, unless Allan commits perjury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lovers looked at each other, across the insuperable obstacle of\r\nBlackstone, in speechless dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up the book,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie, resignedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt we should\r\nfind the police, and the prison, and the hair-cutting--all punishments\r\nfor perjury, exactly as I told you!--if we looked at the next page. But\r\nwe needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble ourselves to look; we have found out quite enough\r\nalready. It\xe2\x80\x99s all over with us. I must go to school on Saturday, and\r\nyou must manage to forget me as soon as you can. Perhaps we may meet in\r\nafter-life, and you may be a widower and I may be a widow, and the\r\ncruel law may consider us emancipated, when it\xe2\x80\x99s too late to be of the\r\nslightest use. By that time, no doubt, I shall be old and ugly, and you\r\nwill naturally have ceased to care about me, and it will all end in the\r\ngrave, and the sooner the better. Good-by,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Neelie, rising\r\nmournfully, with the tears in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only prolonging our misery\r\nto stop here, unless--unless you have anything to propose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got something to propose,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the headlong Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nentirely new idea. Would you mind trying the blacksmith at Gretna\r\nGreen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo earthly consideration,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Neelie, indignantly, \xe2\x80\x9cwould induce\r\nme to be married by a blacksmith!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be offended,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Allan; \xe2\x80\x9cI meant it for the best. Lots of\r\npeople in our situation have tried the blacksmith, and found him quite\r\nas good as a clergyman, and a most amiable man, I believe, into the\r\nbargain. Never mind! We must try another string to our bow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t got another to try,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neelie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my word for it,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Allan, stoutly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere must be ways and\r\nmeans of circumventing Blackstone (without perjury), if we only knew\r\nof them. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of law, and we must consult somebody in the\r\nprofession. I dare say it\xe2\x80\x99s a risk. But nothing venture, nothing have.\r\nWhat do you say to young Pedgift? He\xe2\x80\x99s a thorough good fellow. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nwe could trust young Pedgift to keep our secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for worlds!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Neelie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be willing to trust your\r\nsecrets to the vulgar little wretch; I won\xe2\x80\x99t have him trusted with mine.\r\nI hate him. No!\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, with a mounting color and a peremptory\r\nstamp of her foot on the grass. \xe2\x80\x9cI positively forbid you to take any\r\nof the Thorpe Ambrose people into your confidence. They would instantly\r\nsuspect me, and it would be all over the place in a moment. My\r\nattachment may be an unhappy one,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Neelie, with her\r\nhandkerchief to her eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cand papa may nip it in the bud, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave it profaned by the town gossip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! hush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t say a word at Thorpe Ambrose, I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, and considered for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s another way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he burst out, brightening up on the instant. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got the whole week\r\nbefore us. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to London!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden rustling--heard neither by one nor the other--among\r\nthe trees behind them that screened Miss Gwilt. One more of the\r\ndifficulties in her way (the difficulty of getting Allan to London) now\r\npromised to be removed by an act of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s own will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo London?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Neelie, looking up in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo London!\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s far enough away from Thorpe\r\nAmbrose, surely? Wait a minute, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that this is a question\r\nof law. Very well, I know some lawyers in London who managed all my\r\nbusiness for me when I first came in for this property; they are just\r\nthe men to consult. And if they decline to be mixed up in it, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntheir head clerk, who is one of the best fellows I ever met with in my\r\nlife. I asked him to go yachting with me, I remember; and, though he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go, he said he felt the obligation all the same. That\xe2\x80\x99s the man\r\nto help us. Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s a mere infant to him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd;\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly like _me_. Do pray hear me out. I won\xe2\x80\x99t breathe\r\nyour name or your father\xe2\x80\x99s. I\xe2\x80\x99ll describe you as \xe2\x80\x98a young lady to whom I\r\nam devotedly attached.\xe2\x80\x99 And if my friend the clerk asks where you live,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll say the north of Scotland, or the west of Ireland, or the Channel\r\nIslands, or anywhere else you like. My friend the clerk is a\r\ntotal stranger to Thorpe Ambrose and everybody in it (which is one\r\nrecommendation); and in five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 time he\xe2\x80\x99d put me up to what to\r\ndo (which is another). If you only knew him! He\xe2\x80\x99s one of those\r\nextraordinary men who appear once or twice in a century--the sort of man\r\nwho won\xe2\x80\x99t allow you to make a mistake if you try. All I have got to say\r\nto him (putting it short) is, \xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow, I want to be privately\r\nmarried without perjury.\xe2\x80\x99 All he has got to say to me (putting it short)\r\nis, \xe2\x80\x98You must do so-and-so and so-and-so, and you must be careful to\r\navoid this, that, and the other.\xe2\x80\x99 I have nothing in the world to do but\r\nto follow his directions; and you have nothing in the world to do but\r\nwhat the bride always does when the bridegroom is ready and willing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n His arm stole round Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s waist, and his lips pointed the moral of\r\nthe last sentence with that inarticulate eloquence which is so uniformly\r\nsuccessful in persuading a woman against her will.\r\n\r\nAll Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s meditated objections dwindled, in spite of her, to\r\none feeble little question. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I allow you to go, Allan?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered, toying nervously with the stud in the bosom of his shirt.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you be very long away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be off to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cby the eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock train. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe back to-morrow, if I and my friend the clerk can settle it all in\r\ntime. If not, by Wednesday at latest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll write to me every day?\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Neelie, clinging a little closer\r\nto him. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall sink under the suspense, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t promise to write\r\nto me every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan promised to write twice a day, if she liked--letter-writing, which\r\nwas such an effort to other men, was no effort to _him_!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mind, whatever those people may say to you in London,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded\r\nNeelie, \xe2\x80\x9cI insist on your coming back for me. I positively decline to\r\nrun away, unless you promise to fetch me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan promised for the second time, on his sacred word of honor, and at\r\nthe full compass of his voice. But Neelie was not satisfied even yet.\r\nShe reverted to first principles, and insisted on knowing whether Allan\r\nwas quite sure he loved her. Allan called Heaven to witness how sure he\r\nwas; and got another question directly for his pains. Could he solemnly\r\ndeclare that he would never regret taking Neelie away from home? Allan\r\ncalled Heaven to witness again, louder than ever. All to no purpose!\r\nThe ravenous female appetite for tender protestations still hungered\r\nfor more. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what will happen one of these days,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Neelie.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see some other girl who is prettier than I am; and you will\r\nwish you had married her instead of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Allan opened his lips for a final outburst of asseveration, the\r\nstable clock at the great house was faintly audible in the distance\r\nstriking the hour. Neelie started guiltily. It was breakfast-time at\r\nthe cottage--in other words, time to take leave. At the last moment her\r\nheart went back to her father; and her head sank on Allan\xe2\x80\x99s bosom as she\r\ntried to say, Good-by. \xe2\x80\x9cPapa has always been so kind to me, Allan,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered, holding him back tremulously when he turned to leave her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nseems so guilty and so heartless to go away from him and be married in\r\nsecret. Oh, do, do think before you really go to London; is there no\r\nway of making him a little kinder and juster to _you_?\xe2\x80\x9d The question was\r\nuseless; the major\xe2\x80\x99s resolutely unfavorable reception of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nrose in Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s memory, and answered her as the words passed her lips.\r\nWith a girl\xe2\x80\x99s impulsiveness she pushed Allan away before he could\r\nspeak, and signed to him impatiently to go. The conflict of contending\r\nemotions, which she had mastered thus far, burst its way outward in\r\nspite of her after he had waved his hand for the last time, and had\r\ndisappeared in the depths of the dell. When she turned from the place,\r\non her side, her long-restrained tears fell freely at last, and made the\r\nlonely way back to the cottage the dimmest prospect that Neelie had seen\r\nfor many a long day past.\r\n\r\nAs she hurried homeward, the leaves parted behind her, and Miss Gwilt\r\nstepped softly into the open space. She stood there in triumph, tall,\r\nbeautiful, and resolute. Her lovely color brightened while she watched\r\nNeelie\xe2\x80\x99s retreating figure hastening lightly away from her over the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCry, you little fool!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with her quiet, clear tones, and her\r\nsteady smile of contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cCry as you have never cried yet! You have\r\nseen the last of your sweetheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. A SCANDAL AT THE STATION.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, the landlady at Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings was lost in\r\nastonishment, and the clamorous tongues of the children were in a state\r\nof ungovernable revolt. \xe2\x80\x9cUnforeseen circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d had suddenly obliged\r\nthe tenant of the first floor to terminate the occupation of her\r\napartments, and to go to London that day by the eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to have a fly at the door at half-past ten,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gwilt,\r\nas the amazed landlady followed her upstairs. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd excuse me, you good\r\ncreature, if I beg and pray not to be disturbed till the fly comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Once inside the room, she locked the door, and then opened her\r\nwriting-desk. \xe2\x80\x9cNow for my letter to the major!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I\r\nword it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration apparently decided her. Searching through\r\nher collection of pens, she carefully selected the worst that could be\r\nfound, and began the letter by writing the date of the day on a soiled\r\nsheet of note-paper, in crooked, clumsy characters, which ended in a\r\nblot made purposely with the feather of the pen. Pausing, sometimes to\r\nthink a little, sometimes to make another blot, she completed the letter\r\nin these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHON\xe2\x80\x99D SIR--It is on my conscience to tell you something, which I think\r\nyou ought to know. You ought to know of the goings-on of Miss, your\r\ndaughter, with young Mister Armadale. I wish you to make sure, and, what\r\nis more, I advise you to be quick about it, if she is going the way\r\nyou want her to go, when she takes her morning walk before breakfast.\r\nI scorn to make mischief, where there is true love on both sides. But I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think the young man means truly by Miss. What I mean is, I think\r\nMiss only has his fancy. Another person, who shall be nameless betwixt\r\nus, has his true heart. Please to pardon my not putting my name; I am\r\nonly a humble person, and it might get me into trouble. This is all at\r\npresent, dear sir, from yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA WELL-WISHER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gwilt, as she folded the letter up. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had been\r\na professed novelist, I could hardly have written more naturally in the\r\ncharacter of a servant than that!\xe2\x80\x9d She wrote the necessary address to\r\nMajor Milroy; looked admiringly for the last time at the coarse and\r\nclumsy writing which her own delicate hand had produced; and rose to\r\npost the letter herself, before she entered next on the serious business\r\nof packing up. \xe2\x80\x9cCurious!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, when the letter had been posted,\r\nand she was back again making her traveling preparations in her own\r\nroom; \xe2\x80\x9chere I am, running headlong into a frightful risk--and I never\r\nwas in better spirits in my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boxes were ready when the fly was at the door, and Miss Gwilt was\r\nequipped (as becomingly as usual) in her neat traveling costume. The\r\nthick veil, which she was accustomed to wear in London, appeared on\r\nher country straw bonnet for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cOne meets such rude men\r\noccasionally in the railway,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the landlady. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd though I\r\ndress quietly, my hair is so very remarkable.\xe2\x80\x9d She was a little paler\r\nthan usual; but she had never been so sweet-tempered and engaging, so\r\ngracefully cordial and friendly, as now, when the moment of departure\r\nhad come. The simple people of the house were quite moved at taking\r\nleave of her. She insisted on shaking hands with the landlord--on\r\nspeaking to him in her prettiest way, and sunning him in her brightest\r\nsmiles. \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the landlady, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been so kind, you\r\nhave been so like a mother to me, you must give me a kiss at parting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She embraced the children all together in a lump, with a mixture of\r\nhumor and tenderness delightful to see, and left a shilling among them\r\nto buy a cake. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I was only rich enough to make it a sovereign,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered to the mother, \xe2\x80\x9chow glad I should be!\xe2\x80\x9d The awkward lad who ran\r\non errands stood waiting at the fly door. He was clumsy, he was frowsy,\r\nhe had a gaping mouth and a turn-up nose; but the ineradicable female\r\ndelight in being charming accepted him, for all that, in the character\r\nof a last chance. \xe2\x80\x9cYou dear, dingy John!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, kindly, at the\r\ncarriage door. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so poor I have only sixpence to give you--with my\r\nvery best wishes. Take my advice, John--grow to be a fine man, and find\r\nyourself a nice sweetheart! Thank you a thousand times!\xe2\x80\x9d She gave him\r\na friendly little pat on the cheek with two of her gloved fingers, and\r\nsmiled, and nodded, and got into the fly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale next!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself as the carriage drove off.\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety not to miss the train had brought him to the station\r\nin better time than usual. After taking his ticket and putting his\r\nportmanteau under the porter\xe2\x80\x99s charge, he was pacing the platform and\r\nthinking of Neelie, when he heard the rustling of a lady\xe2\x80\x99s dress behind\r\nhim, and, turning round to look, found himself face to face with Miss\r\nGwilt.\r\n\r\nThere was no escaping her this time. The station wall was on his right\r\nhand, and the line was on his left; a tunnel was behind him, and Miss\r\nGwilt was in front, inquiring in her sweetest tones whether Mr. Armadale\r\nwas going to London.\r\n\r\nAllan colored scarlet with vexation and surprise. There he was obviously\r\nwaiting for the train; and there was his portmanteau close by, with his\r\nname on it, already labeled for London! What answer but the true one\r\ncould he make after that? Could he let the train go without him, and\r\nlose the precious hours so vitally important to Neelie and himself?\r\nImpossible! Allan helplessly confirmed the printed statement on his\r\nportmanteau, and heartily wished himself at the other end of the world\r\nas he said the words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very fortunate!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Miss Gwilt. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to London too.\r\nMight I ask you Mr. Armadale (as you seem to be quite alone), to be my\r\nescort on the journey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan looked at the little assembly of travelers, and travelers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfriends, collected on the platform, near the booking-office door. They\r\nwere all Thorpe Ambrose people. He was probably known by sight, and\r\nMiss Gwilt was probably known by sight, to every one of them. In sheer\r\ndesperation, hesitating more awkwardly than ever, he produced his cigar\r\ncase. \xe2\x80\x9cI should be delighted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with an embarrassment which was\r\nalmost an insult under the circumstances. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I--I\xe2\x80\x99m what the people\r\nwho get sick over a cigar call a slave to smoking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI delight in smoking!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gwilt, with undiminished vivacity and\r\ngood humor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one of the privileges of the men which I have always\r\nenvied. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, Mr. Armadale, you must think I am forcing myself on\r\nyou. It certainly looks like it. The real truth is, I want particularly\r\nto say a word to you in private about Mr. Midwinter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe train came up at the same moment. Setting Midwinter out of the\r\nquestion, the common decencies of politeness left Allan no alternative\r\nbut to submit. After having been the cause of her leaving her situation\r\nat Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s, after having pointedly avoided her only a few days\r\nsince on the high-road, to have declined going to London in the same\r\ncarriage with Miss Gwilt would have been an act of downright brutality\r\nwhich it was simply impossible to commit. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn her!\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan,\r\ninternally, as he handed his traveling companion into an empty carriage,\r\nofficiously placed at his disposal, before all the people at the\r\nstation, by the guard. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shan\xe2\x80\x99t be disturbed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the man\r\nwhispered, confidentially, with a smile and a touch of his hat. Allan\r\ncould have knocked him down with the utmost pleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nfrom the window. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want the carriage--\xe2\x80\x9d It was useless; the guard\r\nwas out of hearing; the whistle blew, and the train started for London.\r\n\r\nThe select assembly of travelers\xe2\x80\x99 friends, left behind on the platform,\r\ncongregated in a circle on the spot, with the station-master in the\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nThe station-master--otherwise Mr. Mack--was a popular character in the\r\nneighborhood. He possessed two social qualifications which invariably\r\nimpress the average English mind--he was an old soldier, and he was a\r\nman of few words. The conclave on the platform insisted on taking his\r\nopinion, before it committed itself positively to an opinion of its own.\r\nA brisk fire of remarks exploded, as a matter of course, on all sides;\r\nbut everybody\xe2\x80\x99s view of the subject ended interrogatively, in a question\r\naimed pointblank at the station-master\xe2\x80\x99s ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got him, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll come back \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x99 won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d better have stuck to Miss Milroy, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Milroy\r\nstuck to _him_. She paid him a visit at the great house, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the sort; it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame to take the girl\xe2\x80\x99s character away.\r\nShe was caught in a thunder-storm close by; he was obliged to give her\r\nshelter; and she\xe2\x80\x99s never been near the place since. Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nthere, if you like, with no thunderstorm to force _her_ in; and Miss\r\nGwilt\xe2\x80\x99s off with him to London in a carriage all to themselves, eh, Mr.\r\nMack?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a soft one, that Armadale! with all his money, to take\r\nup with a red-haired woman, a good eight or nine years older than he is!\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s thirty if she\xe2\x80\x99s a day. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I say, Mr. Mack. What do you\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOlder or younger, she\xe2\x80\x99ll rule the roast at Thorpe Ambrose; and\r\nI say, for the sake of the place, and for the sake of trade, let\xe2\x80\x99s make\r\nthe best of it; and Mr. Mack, as a man of the world, sees it in the same\r\nlight as I do, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the station-master, with his abrupt military accent,\r\nand his impenetrable military manner, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s a devilish fine woman. And\r\nwhen I was Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s age, it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion, if her fancy had laid\r\nthat way, she might have married Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that expression of opinion the station-master wheeled to the right,\r\nand intrenched himself impregnably in the stronghold of his own office.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Thorpe Ambrose looked at the closed door, and gravely\r\nshook their heads. Mr. Mack had disappointed them. No opinion which\r\nopenly recognizes the frailty of human nature is ever a popular opinion\r\nwith mankind. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as good as saying that any of _us_ might have\r\nmarried her if _we_ had been Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s age!\xe2\x80\x9d Such was the general\r\nimpression on the minds of the conclave, when the meeting had been\r\nadjourned, and the members were leaving the station.\r\n\r\nThe last of the party to go was a slow old gentleman, with a habit of\r\ndeliberately looking about him. Pausing at the door, this observant\r\nperson stared up the platform and down the platform, and discovered in\r\nthe latter direction, standing behind an angle of the wall, an elderly\r\nman in black, who had escaped the notice of everybody up to that time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, advancing inquisitively by\r\na step at a time, \xe2\x80\x9cit can\xe2\x80\x99t be Mr. Bashwood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt _was_ Mr. Bashwood--Mr. Bashwood, whose constitutional curiosity\r\nhad taken him privately to the station, bent on solving the mystery of\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s sudden journey to London--Mr. Bashwood, who had seen and heard,\r\nbehind his angle in the wall, what everybody else had seen and heard,\r\nand who appeared to have been impressed by it in no ordinary way. He\r\nstood stiffly against the wall, like a man petrified, with one hand\r\npressed on his bare head, and the other holding his hat--he stood, with\r\na dull flush on his face, and a dull stare in his eyes, looking straight\r\ninto the black depths of the tunnel outside the station, as if the train\r\nto London had disappeared in it but the moment before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your head bad?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cTake my advice. Go home\r\nand lie down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood listened mechanically, with his usual attention, and\r\nanswered mechanically, with his usual politeness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a low, lost tone, like a man between dreaming\r\nand waking; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go home and lie down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the old gentleman, making for the door. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\ntake a pill, Mr. Bashwood--take a pill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, the porter charged with the business of locking up\r\nthe station found Mr. Bashwood, still standing bare-headed against the\r\nwall, and still looking straight into the black depths of the tunnel, as\r\nif the train to London had disappeared in it but a moment since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the porter; \xe2\x80\x9cI must lock up. Are you out of sorts?\r\nAnything wrong with your inside? Try a drop of gin-and-bitters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bashwood, answering the porter, exactly as he had\r\nanswered the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try a drop of gin-and-bitters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe porter took him by the arm, and led him out. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get it there,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the man, pointing confidentially to a public-house; \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nit good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall get it there,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mr. Bashwood, still mechanically\r\nrepeating what was said to him; \xe2\x80\x9cand I shall get it good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis will seemed to be paralyzed; his actions depended absolutely on what\r\nother people told him to do. He took a few steps in the direction of the\r\npublic-house, hesitated, staggered, and caught at the pillar of one of\r\nthe station lamps near him.\r\n\r\nThe porter followed, and took him by the arm once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been drinking already!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the man, with a suddenly\r\nquickened interest in Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s case. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it? Beer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood, in his low, lost tones, echoed the last word.\r\n\r\nIt was close on the porter\xe2\x80\x99s dinner-time. But, when the lower orders\r\nof the English people believe they have discovered an intoxicated man,\r\ntheir sympathy with him is boundless. The porter let his dinner take its\r\nchance, and carefully assisted Mr. Bashwood to reach the public-house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGin-and-bitters will put you on your legs again,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered this\r\nSamaritan setter-right of the alcoholic disasters of mankind.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Bashwood had really been intoxicated, the effect of the porter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nremedy would have been marvelous indeed. Almost as soon as the glass was\r\nemptied, the stimulant did its work. The long-weakened nervous system\r\nof the deputy-steward, prostrated for the moment by the shock that had\r\nfallen on it, rallied again like a weary horse under the spur. The\r\ndull flush on his cheeks, the dull stare in his eyes, disappeared\r\nsimultaneously. After a momentary effort, he recovered memory enough of\r\nwhat had passed to thank the porter, and to ask whether he would take\r\nsomething himself. The worthy creature instantly accepted a dose of his\r\nown remedy--in the capacity of a preventive--and went home to dinner as\r\nonly those men can go home who are physically warmed by gin-and-bitters\r\nand morally elevated by the performance of a good action.\r\n\r\nStill strangely abstracted (but conscious now of the way by which he\r\nwent), Mr. Bashwood left the public-house a few minutes later, in his\r\nturn. He walked on mechanically, in his dreary black garments, moving\r\nlike a blot on the white surface of the sun-brightened road, as\r\nMidwinter had seen him move in the early days at Thorpe Ambrose, when\r\nthey had first met. Arrived at the point where he had to choose between\r\nthe way that led into the town and the way that led to the great house,\r\nhe stopped, incapable of deciding, and careless, apparently, even of\r\nmaking the attempt. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be revenged on her!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to himself,\r\nstill absorbed in his jealous frenzy of rage against the woman who had\r\ndeceived him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be revenged on her,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, in louder tones,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif I spend every half-penny I\xe2\x80\x99ve got!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome women of the disorderly sort, passing on their way to the town,\r\nheard him. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, you old brute,\xe2\x80\x9d they called out, with the measureless\r\nlicense of their class, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever she did, she served you right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe coarseness of the voices startled him, whether he comprehended the\r\nwords or not. He shrank away from more interruption and more insult,\r\ninto the quieter road that led to the great house.\r\n\r\nAt a solitary place by the wayside he stopped and sat down. He took off\r\nhis hat and lifted his youthful wig a little from his bald old head, and\r\ntried desperately to get beyond the one immovable conviction which lay\r\non his mind like lead--the conviction that Miss Gwilt had been purposely\r\ndeceiving him from the first. It was useless. No effort would free him\r\nfrom that one dominant impression, and from the one answering idea that\r\nit had evoked--the idea of revenge. He got up again, and put on his hat\r\nand walked rapidly forward a little way--then turned without knowing\r\nwhy, and slowly walked back again \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had only dressed a little\r\nsmarter!\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor wretch, helplessly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had only been a little\r\nbolder with her, she might have overlooked my being an old man!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nangry fit returned on him. He clinched his clammy, trembling hands,\r\nand shook them fiercely in the empty air. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be revenged on her,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreiterated. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be revenged on her, if I spend every half-penny I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot!\xe2\x80\x9d It was terribly suggestive of the hold she had taken on him, that\r\nhis vindictive sense of injury could not get far enough away from her to\r\nreach the man whom he believed to be his rival, even yet. In his rage,\r\nas in his love, he was absorbed, body and soul, by Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\nIn a moment more, the noise of running wheels approaching from behind\r\nstartled him. He turned and looked round. There was Mr. Pedgift the\r\nelder, rapidly overtaking him in the gig, just as Mr. Pedgift had\r\novertaken him once already, on that former occasion when he had listened\r\nunder the window at the great house, and when the lawyer had bluntly\r\ncharged him with feeling a curiosity about Miss Gwilt!\r\n\r\nIn an instant the inevitable association of ideas burst on his mind. The\r\nopinion of Miss Gwilt, which he had heard the lawyer express to Allan at\r\nparting, flashed back into his memory, side by side with Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsarcastic approval of anything in the way of inquiry which his own\r\ncuriosity might attempt. \xe2\x80\x9cI may be even with her yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nMr. Pedgift will help me!--Stop, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he called out, desperately, as\r\nthe gig came up with him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, sir, I want to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Senior slackened the pace of his fast-trotting mare, without\r\npulling up. \xe2\x80\x9cCome to the office in half an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m busy\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d Without waiting for an answer, without noticing Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbow, he gave the mare the rein again, and was out of sight in another\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood sat down once more in a shady place by the roadside. He\r\nappeared to be incapable of feeling any slight but the one unpardonable\r\nslight put upon him by Miss Gwilt. He not only declined to resent, he\r\neven made the best of Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s unceremonious treatment of him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, resignedly. \xe2\x80\x9cTime enough to compose myself;\r\nand I want time. Very kind of Mr. Pedgift, though he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have meant\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sense of oppression in his head forced him once again to remove his\r\nhat. He sat with it on his lap, deep in thought; his face bent low, and\r\nthe wavering fingers of one hand drumming absently on the crown of the\r\nhat. If Mr. Pedgift the elder, seeing him as he sat now, could only have\r\nlooked a little way into the future, the monotonously drumming hand of\r\nthe deputy-steward might have been strong enough, feeble as it was, to\r\nstop the lawyer by the roadside. It was the worn, weary, miserable old\r\nhand of a worn, weary, miserable old man; but it was, for all that (to\r\nuse the language of Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s own parting prediction to Allan), the\r\nhand that was now destined to \xe2\x80\x9clet the light in on Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. AN OLD MAN\xe2\x80\x99S HEART.\r\n\r\nPunctual to the moment, when the half hour\xe2\x80\x99s interval had expired, Mr.\r\nBashwood was announced at the office as waiting to see Mr. Pedgift by\r\nspecial appointment.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer looked up from his papers with an air of annoyance: he had\r\ntotally forgotten the meeting by the roadside. \xe2\x80\x9cSee what he wants,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPedgift Senior to Pedgift Junior, working in the same room with him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing of importance, put it off to some other time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Junior swiftly disappeared and swiftly returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the son, \xe2\x80\x9che is rather more shaky and unintelligible\r\nthan usual. I can make nothing out of him, except that he persists\r\nin wanting to see you. My own idea,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Pedgift Junior, with his\r\nusual, sardonic gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cis that he is going to have a fit, and that he\r\nwishes to acknowledge your uniform kindness to him by obliging you with\r\na private view of the whole proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Senior habitually matched everybody--his son included--with\r\ntheir own weapons. \xe2\x80\x9cBe good enough to remember, Augustus,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat my Room is not a Court of Law. A bad joke is not invariably\r\nfollowed by \xe2\x80\x98roars of laughter\xe2\x80\x99 _here_. Let Mr. Bashwood come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood was introduced, and Pedgift Junior withdrew. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbleed him, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the incorrigible joker, as he passed the back\r\nof his father\xe2\x80\x99s chair. \xe2\x80\x9cHot-water bottles to the soles of his feet,\r\nand a mustard plaster on the pit of his stomach--that\xe2\x80\x99s the modern\r\ntreatment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Bashwood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift Senior when they were alone. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t forget that time\xe2\x80\x99s money. Out with it, whatever it is, at the\r\nquickest possible rate, and in the fewest possible words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese preliminary directions, bluntly but not at all unkindly spoken,\r\nrather increased than diminished the painful agitation under which Mr.\r\nBashwood was suffering. He stammered more helplessly, he trembled more\r\ncontinuously than usual, as he made his little speech of thanks, and\r\nadded his apologies at the end for intruding on his patron in business\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody in the place, Mr. Pedgift, sir, knows your time is valuable.\r\nOh, dear, yes! oh, dear, yes! most valuable, most valuable! Excuse me,\r\nsir, I\xe2\x80\x99m coming out with it. Your goodness--or rather your business--no,\r\nyour goodness gave me half an hour to wait--and I have thought of what\r\nI had to say, and prepared it, and put it short.\xe2\x80\x9d Having got as far as\r\nthat, he stopped with a pained, bewildered look. He had put it away in\r\nhis memory, and now, when the time came, he was too confused to find it.\r\nAnd there was Mr. Pedgift mutely waiting; his face and manner expressive\r\nalike of that silent sense of the value of his own time which every\r\npatient who has visited a great doctor, every client who has consulted a\r\nlawyer in large practice, knows so well. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard the news, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n stammered Mr. Bashwood, shifting his ground in despair, and letting the\r\nuppermost idea in his mind escape him, simply because it was the one\r\nidea in him that was ready to come out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it concern _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pedgift Senior, mercilessly brief, and\r\nmercilessly straight in coming to the point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt concerns a lady, sir--no, not a lady--a young man, I ought to say,\r\nin whom you used to feel some interest. Oh, Mr. Pedgift, sir, what do\r\nyou think! Mr. Armadale and Miss Gwilt have gone up to London together\r\nto-day--alone, sir--alone in a carriage reserved for their two selves.\r\nDo you think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to marry her? Do you really think, like the rest\r\nof them, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put the question with a sudden flush in his face and a sudden\r\nenergy in his manner. His sense of the value of the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s time,\r\nhis conviction of the greatness of the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s condescension, his\r\nconstitutional shyness and timidity--all yielded together to his one\r\noverwhelming interest in hearing Mr. Pedgift\xe2\x80\x99s answer. He was loud for\r\nthe first time in his life in putting the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter my experience of Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, instantly\r\nhardening in look and manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe him to be infatuated enough\r\nto marry Miss Gwilt a dozen times over, if Miss Gwilt chose to ask him.\r\nYour news doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me in the least, Bashwood. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for him.\r\nI can honestly say that, though he _has_ set my advice at defiance.\r\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m more sorry still,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, softening again as his mind\r\nreverted to his interview with Neelie under the trees of the park--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nmore sorry still for another person who shall be nameless. But what have\r\nI to do with all this? And what on earth is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nresumed, noticing for the first time the abject misery in Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner, the blank despair in Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s face, which his answer\r\nhad produced. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill? Is there something behind the curtain\r\nthat you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid to bring out? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. Have you come\r\nhere--here in my private room, in business hours--with nothing to tell\r\nme but that young Armadale has been fool enough to ruin his prospects\r\nfor life? Why, I foresaw it all weeks since, and what is more, I as\r\ngood as told him so at the last conversation I had with him in the great\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those last words, Mr. Bashwood suddenly rallied. The lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s passing\r\nreference to the great house had led him back in a moment to the purpose\r\nthat he had in view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, eagerly; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I wanted to speak to\r\nyou about; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been preparing in my mind. Mr. Pedgift, sir,\r\nthe last time you were at the great house, when you came away in your\r\ngig, you--you overtook me on the drive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say I did,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pedgift, resignedly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mare happens to be\r\na trifle quicker on her legs than you are on yours, Bashwood. Go on, go\r\non. We shall come in time, I suppose, to what you are driving at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stopped, and spoke to me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Mr. Bashwood, advancing\r\nmore and more eagerly to his end. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you suspected me of feeling\r\nsome curiosity about Miss Gwilt, and you told me (I remember the exact\r\nwords, sir)--you told me to gratify my curiosity by all means, for you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t object to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Senior began for the first time to look interested in hearing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember something of the sort,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand I also remember\r\nthinking it rather remarkable that you should _happen_--we won\xe2\x80\x99t put\r\nit in any more offensive way--to be exactly under Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s open\r\nwindow while I was talking to him. It might have been accident, of\r\ncourse; but it looked rather more like curiosity. I could only judge by\r\nappearances,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Pedgift, pointing his sarcasm with a pinch of\r\nsnuff; \xe2\x80\x9cand appearances, Bashwood, were decidedly against you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, sir. I only mentioned the circumstance because I\r\nwished to acknowledge that I _was_ curious, and _am_ curious about Miss\r\nGwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pedgift Senior, seeing something under the surface in Mr.\r\nBashwood\xe2\x80\x99s face and manner, but utterly in the dark thus far as to what\r\nthat something might be.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment. The moment passed, Mr. Bashwood took\r\nthe refuge usually taken by nervous, unready men, placed in his\r\ncircumstances, when they are at a loss for an answer. He simply\r\nreiterated the assertion that he had just made. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel some curiosity\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a strange mixture of doggedness and timidity, \xe2\x80\x9cabout\r\nMiss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another moment of silence. In spite of his practiced acuteness\r\nand knowledge of the world, the lawyer was more puzzled than ever. The\r\ncase of Mr. Bashwood presented the one human riddle of all others which\r\nhe was least qualified to solve. Though year after year witnesses in\r\nthousands and thousands of cases, the remorseless disinheriting of\r\nnearest and dearest relations, the unnatural breaking-up of sacred\r\nfamily ties, the deplorable severance of old and firm friendships, due\r\nentirely to the intense self-absorption which the sexual passion can\r\nproduce when it enters the heart of an old man, the association of love\r\nwith infirmity and gray hairs arouses, nevertheless, all the world over,\r\nno other idea than the idea of extravagant improbability or extravagant\r\nabsurdity in the general mind. If the interview now taking place in Mr.\r\nPedgift\xe2\x80\x99s consulting-room had taken place at his dinner-table instead,\r\nwhen wine had opened his mind to humorous influences, it is possible\r\nthat he might, by this time, have suspected the truth. But, in his\r\nbusiness hours, Pedgift Senior was in the habit of investigating men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmotives seriously from the business point of view; and he was on\r\nthat very account simply incapable of conceiving any improbability so\r\nstartling, any absurdity so enormous, as the absurdity and improbability\r\nof Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s being in love.\r\n\r\nSome men in the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s position would have tried to force their way to\r\nenlightenment by obstinately repeating the unanswered question. Pedgift\r\nSenior wisely postponed the question until he had moved the conversation\r\non another step. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9clet us say you feel a curiosity\r\nabout Miss Gwilt. What next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe palms of Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s hands began to moisten under the influence\r\nof his agitation, as they had moistened in the past days when he had\r\ntold the story of his domestic sorrows to Midwinter at the great house.\r\nOnce more he rolled his handkerchief into a ball, and dabbed it softly\r\nto and fro from one hand to the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask if I am right, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cin believing that you have\r\na very unfavorable opinion of Miss Gwilt? You are quite convinced, I\r\nthink--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Pedgift Senior, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy need you be in any\r\ndoubt about it? You were under Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s open window all the while\r\nI was talking to him; and your ears, I presume, were not absolutely\r\nshut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood showed no sense of the interruption. The little sting of\r\nthe lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s sarcasm was lost in the nobler pain that wrung him from the\r\nwound inflicted by Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite convinced, I think, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there\r\nare circumstances in this lady\xe2\x80\x99s past life which would be highly\r\ndiscreditable to her if they were discovered at the present time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe window was open at the great house, Bashwood; and your ears, I\r\npresume, were not absolutely shut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill impenetrable to the sting, Mr. Bashwood persisted more obstinately\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless I am greatly mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyour long experience in such\r\nthings has even suggested to you, sir, that Miss Gwilt might turn out to\r\nbe known to the police?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Senior\xe2\x80\x99s patience gave way. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been over ten minutes in\r\nthis room,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you, or can you not, tell me in plain\r\nEnglish what you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn plain English--with the passion that had transformed him, the passion\r\nwhich (in Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s own words) had made a man of him, burning in his\r\nhaggard cheeks--Mr. Bashwood met the challenge, and faced the lawyer\r\n(as, the worried sheep faces the dog) on his own ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your opinion in this matter is\r\nmy opinion too. I believe there is something wrong in Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s past\r\nlife which she keeps concealed from everybody, and I want to be the man\r\nwho knows it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPedgift Senior saw his chance, and instantly reverted to the question\r\nthat he had postponed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked for the second time.\r\n\r\nFor the second time Mr. Bashwood hesitated.\r\n\r\nCould he acknowledge that he had been mad enough to love her, and mean\r\nenough to be a spy for her? Could he say, She has deceived me from the\r\nfirst, and she has deserted me, now her object is served. After robbing\r\nme of my happiness, robbing me of my honor, robbing me of my last hope\r\nleft in life, she has gone from me forever, and left me nothing but my\r\nold man\xe2\x80\x99s longing, slow and sly, and strong and changeless, for revenge.\r\nRevenge that I may have, if I can poison her success by dragging her\r\nfrailties into the public view. Revenge that I will buy (for what is\r\ngold or what is life to me?) with the last farthing of my hoarded money\r\nand the last drop of my stagnant blood. Could he say that to the man\r\nwho sat waiting for his answer? No; he could only crush it down and be\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s expression began to harden once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of us must speak out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand as you evidently won\xe2\x80\x99t, I\r\nwill. I can only account for this extraordinary anxiety of yours to make\r\nyourself acquainted with Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s secrets, in one of two ways. Your\r\nmotive is either an excessively mean one (no offense, Bashwood, I\r\nam only putting the case), or an excessively generous one. After my\r\nexperience of your honest character and your creditable conduct, it is\r\nonly your due that I should absolve you at once of the mean motive. I\r\nbelieve you are as incapable as I am--I can say no more--of turning\r\nto mercenary account any discoveries you might make to Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprejudice in Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s past life. Shall I go on any further? or would\r\nyou prefer, on second thoughts, opening your mind frankly to me of your\r\nown accord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should prefer not interrupting you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bashwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Pedgift Senior. \xe2\x80\x9cHaving absolved you of the\r\nmean motive, I come to the generous motive next. It is possible that you\r\nare an unusually grateful man; and it is certain that Mr. Armadale has\r\nbeen remarkably kind to you. After employing you under Mr. Midwinter, in\r\nthe steward\xe2\x80\x99s office, he has had confidence enough in your honesty and\r\nyour capacity, now his friend has left him, to put his business entirely\r\nand unreservedly in your hands. It\xe2\x80\x99s not in my experience of human\r\nnature--but it may be possible, nevertheless--that you are so\r\ngratefully sensible of that confidence, and so gratefully interested\r\nin your employer\xe2\x80\x99s welfare, that you can\xe2\x80\x99t see him, in his friendless\r\nposition, going straight to his own disgrace and ruin, without making\r\nan effort to save him. To put it in two words. Is it your idea that Mr.\r\nArmadale might be prevented from marrying Miss Gwilt, if he could be\r\ninformed in time of her real character? And do you wish to be the man\r\nwho opens his eyes to the truth? If that is the case--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped in astonishment. Acting under some uncontrollable impulse,\r\nMr. Bashwood had started to his feet. He stood, with his withered face\r\nlit up by a sudden irradiation from within, which made him look younger\r\nthan his age by a good twenty years--he stood, gasping for breath enough\r\nto speak, and gesticulated entreatingly at the lawyer with both hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay it again, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out, eagerly, recovering his breath before\r\nPedgift Senior had recovered his surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cThe question about Mr.\r\nArmadale, sir!--only once more!--only once more, Mr. Pedgift, please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith his practiced observation closely and distrustfully at work on Mr.\r\nBashwood\xe2\x80\x99 s face, Pedgift Senior motioned to him to sit down again, and\r\nput the question for the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bashwood, repeating the sense, but not the words\r\nof the question, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Armadale might be parted from Miss Gwilt, if\r\nshe could be shown to him as she really is? Yes, sir! And do I wish to\r\nbe the man who does it? Yes, sir! yes, sir!! yes, sir!!!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather strange,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the lawyer, looking at him more and more\r\ndistrustfully, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should be so violently agitated, simply because\r\nmy question happens to have hit the mark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question happened to have hit a mark which Pedgift little dreamed\r\nof. It had released Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s mind in an instant from the dead\r\npressure of his one dominant idea of revenge, and had shown him a\r\npurpose to be achieved by the discovery of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s secrets which\r\nhad never occurred to him till that moment. The marriage which he had\r\nblindly regarded as inevitable was a marriage that might be stopped--not\r\nin Allan\xe2\x80\x99s interests, but in his own--and the woman whom he believed\r\nthat he had lost might yet, in spite of circumstances, be a woman won!\r\nHis brain whirled as he thought of it. His own roused resolution almost\r\ndaunted him, by its terrible incongruity with all the familiar habits of\r\nhis mind, and all the customary proceedings of his life.\r\n\r\nFinding his last remark unanswered, Pedgift Senior considered a little\r\nbefore he said anything more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing is clear,\xe2\x80\x9d reasoned the lawyer with himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHis true motive\r\nin this matter is a motive which he is afraid to avow. My question\r\nevidently offered him a chance of misleading me, and he has accepted it\r\non the spot. That\xe2\x80\x99s enough for _me_. If I was Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, the\r\nmystery might be worth investigating. As things are, it\xe2\x80\x99s no interest\r\nof mine to hunt Mr. Bashwood from one lie to another till I run him to\r\nearth at last. I have nothing whatever to do with it; and I shall leave\r\nhim free to follow his own roundabout courses, in his own roundabout\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d Having arrived at that conclusion, Pedgift Senior pushed back his\r\nchair, and rose briskly to terminate the interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, Bashwood,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cThe subject of our conversation\r\nis a subject exhausted, so far as I am concerned. I have only a few\r\nlast words to say, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a habit of mine, as you know, to say my last\r\nwords on my legs. Whatever else I may be in the dark about, I have made\r\none discovery, at any rate. I have found out what you really want with\r\nme--at last! You want me to help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would be so very, very kind, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Mr. Bashwood. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou would only give me the great advantage of your opinion and advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, Bashwood. We will separate those two things, if you please.\r\nA lawyer may offer an opinion like any other man; but when a lawyer\r\ngives his advice--by the Lord Harry, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s Professional! You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nwelcome to my opinion in this matter; I have disguised it from nobody.\r\nI believe there have been events in Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s career which (if they\r\ncould be discovered) would even make Mr. Armadale, infatuated as he is,\r\nafraid to marry her--supposing, of course, that he really _is_ going to\r\nmarry her; for, though the appearances are in favor of it so far, it is\r\nonly an assumption, after all. As to the mode of proceeding by which the\r\nblots on this woman\xe2\x80\x99s character might or might not be brought to\r\nlight in time--she may be married by license in a fortnight if she\r\nlikes--_that_ is a branch of the question on which I positively decline\r\nto enter. It implies speaking in my character as a lawyer, and giving\r\nyou, what I decline positively to give you, my professional advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mr. Bashwood. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t deny me the\r\ngreat favor, the inestimable advantage of your advice! I have such a\r\npoor head, Mr. Pedgift! I am so old and so slow, sir, and I get so sadly\r\nstartled and worried when I\xe2\x80\x99m thrown out of my ordinary ways. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\nnatural you should be a little impatient with me for taking up your\r\ntime--I know that time is money, to a clever man like you. Would you\r\nexcuse me--would you please excuse me, if I venture to say that I have\r\nsaved a little something, a few pounds, sir; and being quite lonely,\r\nwith nobody dependent on me, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I may spend my savings as I\r\nplease?\xe2\x80\x9d Blind to every consideration but the one consideration of\r\npropitiating Mr. Pedgift, he took out a dingy, ragged old pocket-book,\r\nand tried, with trembling fingers, to open it on the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut your pocket-book back directly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift Senior. \xe2\x80\x9cRicher men\r\nthan you have tried that argument with me, and have found that there is\r\nsuch a thing (off the stage) as a lawyer who is not to be bribed. I will\r\nhave nothing to do with the case, under existing circumstances. If\r\nyou want to know why, I beg to inform you that Miss Gwilt ceased to\r\nbe professionally interesting to me on the day when I ceased to be Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer. I may have other reasons besides, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nit necessary to mention. The reason already given is explicit enough.\r\nGo your own way, and take your responsibility on your own shoulders.\r\nYou _may_ venture within reach of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s claws and come out again\r\nwithout being scratched. Time will show. In the meanwhile, I wish you\r\ngood-morning--and I own, to my shame, that I never knew till to-day what\r\na hero you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time, Mr. Bashwood felt the sting. Without another word of\r\nexpostulation or entreaty, without even saying \xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning\xe2\x80\x9d on his\r\nside, he walked to the door, opened it, softly, and left the room.\r\n\r\nThe parting look in his face, and the sudden silence that had fallen on\r\nhim, were not lost on Pedgift Senior. \xe2\x80\x9cBashwood will end badly,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe lawyer, shuffling his papers, and returning impenetrably to his\r\ninterrupted work.\r\n\r\nThe change in Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s face and manner to something dogged and\r\nself-contained was so startlingly uncharacteristic of him, that it\r\neven forced itself on the notice of Pedgift Junior and the clerks as he\r\npassed through the outer office. Accustomed to make the old man their\r\nbutt, they took a boisterously comic view of the marked alteration in\r\nhim. Deaf to the merciless raillery with which he was assailed on all\r\nsides, he stopped opposite young Pedgift, and, looking him attentively\r\nin the face, said, in a quiet, absent manner, like a man thinking aloud,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether _you_ would help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen an account instantly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pedgift Junior to the clerks, \xe2\x80\x9cin the\r\nname of Mr. Bashwood. Place a chair for Mr. Bashwood, with a footstool\r\nclose by, in case he wants it. Supply me with a quire of extra\r\ndouble-wove satin paper, and a gross of picked quills, to take notes of\r\nMr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s case; and inform my father instantly that I am going\r\nto leave him and set up in business for myself, on the strength of Mr.\r\nBashwood\xe2\x80\x99s patronage. Take a seat, sir, pray take a seat, and express\r\nyour feelings freely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill impenetrably deaf to the raillery of which he was the object, Mr.\r\nBashwood waited until Pedgift Junior had exhausted himself, and then\r\nturned quietly away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have known better,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in the same absent manner as\r\nbefore. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is his father\xe2\x80\x99s son all over--he would make game of me on\r\nmy death-bed.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused a moment at the door, mechanically brushing his\r\nhat with his hand, and went out into the street.\r\n\r\nThe bright sunshine dazzled his eyes, the passing vehicles and\r\nfoot-passengers startled and bewildered him. He shrank into a by-street,\r\nand put his hand over his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better go home,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nshut myself up, and think about it in my own room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis lodging was in a small house, in the poor quarter of the town. He\r\nlet himself in with his key, and stole softly upstairs. The one little\r\nroom he possessed met him cruelly, look round it where he might, with\r\nsilent memorials of Miss Gwilt. On the chimney-piece were the flowers\r\nshe had given him at various times, all withered long since, and all\r\npreserved on a little china pedestal, protected by a glass shade. On the\r\nwall hung a wretched colored print of a woman, which he had caused to be\r\nnicely framed and glazed, because there was a look in it that reminded\r\nhim of her face. In his clumsy old mahogany writing-desk were the few\r\nletters, brief and peremptory, which she had written to him at the time\r\nwhen he was watching and listening meanly at Thorpe Ambrose to please\r\n_her_. And when, turning his back on these, he sat down wearily on his\r\nsofa-bedstead--there, hanging over one end of it, was the gaudy cravat\r\nof blue satin, which he had bought because she had told him she liked\r\nbright colors, and which he had never yet had the courage to wear,\r\nthough he had taken it out morning after morning with the resolution to\r\nput it on! Habitually quiet in his actions, habitually restrained in\r\nhis language, he now seized the cravat as if it was a living thing that\r\ncould feel, and flung it to the other end of the room with an oath.\r\n\r\nThe time passed; and still, though his resolution to stand between Miss\r\nGwilt and her marriage remained unbroken, he was as far as ever from\r\ndiscovering the means which might lead him to his end. The more he\r\nthought and thought of it, the darker and the darker his course in the\r\nfuture looked to him.\r\n\r\nHe rose again, as wearily as he had sat down, and went to his cupboard.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m feverish and thirsty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9ca cup of tea may help me.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nopened his canister, and measured out his small allowance of tea, less\r\ncarefully than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cEven my own hands won\xe2\x80\x99t serve me to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought, as he scraped together the few grains of tea that he had\r\nspilled, and put them carefully back in the canister.\r\n\r\nIn that fine summer weather, the one fire in the house was the kitchen\r\nfire. He went downstairs for the boiling water, with his teapot in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nNobody but the landlady was in the kitchen. She was one of the many\r\nEnglish matrons whose path through this world is a path of thorns; and\r\nwho take a dismal pleasure, whenever the opportunity is afforded them,\r\nin inspecting the scratched and bleeding feet of other people in a like\r\ncondition with themselves. Her one vice was of the lighter sort--the\r\nvice of curiosity; and among the many counterbalancing virtues she\r\npossessed was the virtue of greatly respecting Mr. Bashwood, as a lodger\r\nwhose rent was regularly paid, and whose ways were always quiet and\r\ncivil from one year\xe2\x80\x99s end to another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you please to want, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the landlady. \xe2\x80\x9cBoiling water,\r\nis it? Did you ever know the water boil, Mr. Bashwood, when you wanted\r\nit? Did you ever see a sulkier fire than that? I\xe2\x80\x99ll put a stick or two\r\nin, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll wait a little, and give me the chance. Dear, dear me,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse my mentioning it, sir, but how poorly you do look to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe strain on Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s mind was beginning to tell. Something of\r\nthe helplessness which he had shown at the station appeared again in his\r\nface and manner as he put his teapot on the kitchen table and sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in trouble, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly; \xe2\x80\x9cand I find trouble gets\r\nharder to bear than it used to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you may well say that!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned the landlady. \xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99m_ ready for the\r\nundertaker, Mr. Bashwood, when _my_ time comes, whatever you may be.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re too lonely, sir. When you\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble, it\xe2\x80\x99s some help--though\r\nnot much--to shift a share of it off on another person\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. If\r\nyour good lady had only been alive now, sir, what a comfort you would\r\nhave found her, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA momentary spasm of pain passed across Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s face. The\r\nlandlady had ignorantly recalled him to the misfortunes of his married\r\nlife. He had been long since forced to quiet her curiosity about his\r\nfamily affairs by telling her that he was a widower, and that his\r\ndomestic circumstances had not been happy ones; but he had taken her\r\nno further into his confidence than this. The sad story which he had\r\nrelated to Midwinter, of his drunken wife who had ended her miserable\r\nlife in a lunatic asylum, was a story which he had shrunk from confiding\r\nto the talkative woman, who would have confided it in her turn to every\r\none else in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I always say to my husband when he\xe2\x80\x99s low, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the\r\nlandlady, intent on the kettle, \xe2\x80\x9cis, \xe2\x80\x98What would you do _now_, Sam,\r\nwithout me?\xe2\x80\x99 When his temper don\xe2\x80\x99t get the better of him (it will boil\r\ndirectly, Mr. Bashwood), he says, \xe2\x80\x98Elizabeth, I could do nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWhen his temper does get the better of him, he says, \xe2\x80\x98I should try the\r\npublic-house, missus; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it now.\xe2\x80\x99 Ah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got _my_ troubles!\r\nA man with grown-up sons and daughters tippling in a public-house! I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t call to mind, Mr. Bashwood, whether _you_ ever had any sons and\r\ndaughters? And yet, now I think of it, I seem to fancy you said yes, you\r\nhad. Daughters, sir, weren\xe2\x80\x99t they? and, ah, dear! dear! to be sure! all\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had one daughter, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bashwood, patiently--\xe2\x80\x9conly one,\r\nwho died before she was a year old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the sympathizing landlady. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as near boiling\r\nas it ever will be, sir; give me the tea-pot. Only one! Ah, it comes\r\nheavier (don\xe2\x80\x99t it?) when it\xe2\x80\x99s an only child? You said it was an only\r\nchild, I think, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Mr. Bashwood looked at the woman with vacant eyes, and\r\nwithout attempting to answer her. After ignorantly recalling the memory\r\nof the wife who had disgraced him, she was now, as ignorantly, forcing\r\nhim back on the miserable remembrance of the son who had ruined and\r\ndeserted him. For the first time, since he had told his story to\r\nMidwinter, at their introductory interview in the great house, his mind\r\nreverted once more to the bitter disappointment and disaster of the\r\npast. Again he thought of the bygone days, when he had become security\r\nfor his son, and when that son\xe2\x80\x99s dishonesty had forced him to sell\r\neverything he possessed to pay the forfeit that was exacted when the\r\nforfeit was due. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a son, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, becoming conscious that\r\nthe landlady was looking at him in mute and melancholy surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cI did\r\nmy best to help him forward in the world, and he has behaved very badly\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he, now?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the landlady, with an appearance of the greatest\r\ninterest. \xe2\x80\x9cBehaved badly to you--almost broke your heart, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Ah,\r\nit will come home to him, sooner or later. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you fear! \xe2\x80\x98Honor your\r\nfather and mother,\xe2\x80\x99 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t put on Moses\xe2\x80\x99s tables of stone for nothing,\r\nMr. Bashwood. Where may he be, and what is he doing now, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question was in effect almost the same as the question which\r\nMidwinter had put when the circumstances had been described to him. As\r\nMr. Bashwood had answered it on the former occasion, so (in nearly the\r\nsame words) he answered it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son is in London, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, for all I know to the contrary. He was\r\nemployed, when I last heard of him, in no very creditable way, at the\r\nPrivate Inquiry Office--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those words he suddenly checked himself. His face flushed, his eyes\r\nbrightened; he pushed away the cup which had just been filled for him,\r\nand rose from his seat. The landlady started back a step. There was\r\nsomething in her lodger\xe2\x80\x99s face that she had never seen in it before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I\xe2\x80\x99ve not offended you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, recovering her\r\nself-possession, and looking a little too ready to take offense on her\r\nside, at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar from it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, far from it!\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, in a strangely\r\neager, hurried way. \xe2\x80\x9cI have just remembered something--something very\r\nimportant. I must go upstairs--it\xe2\x80\x99s a letter, a letter, a letter. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome back to my tea, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. I beg your pardon, I\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to you,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been very kind--I\xe2\x80\x99ll say good-by, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me, for the\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d To the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s amazement, he cordially shook hands with\r\nher, and made for the door, leaving tea and tea-pot to take care of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe moment he reached his own room, he locked himself in. For a little\r\nwhile he stood holding by the chimney-piece, waiting to recover his\r\nbreath. The moment he could move again, he opened his writing-desk on\r\nthe table. \xe2\x80\x9cThat for you, Mr. Pedgift and Son!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a snap of\r\nhis fingers as he sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a son too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door--a knock, soft, considerate, and\r\nconfidential. The anxious landlady wished to know whether Mr. Bashwood\r\nwas ill, and begged to intimate for the second time that she earnestly\r\ntrusted she had given him no offense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! no!\xe2\x80\x9d he called through the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite well--I\xe2\x80\x99m writing,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, I\xe2\x80\x99m writing--please to excuse me. She\xe2\x80\x99s a good woman; she\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nexcellent woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, when the landlady had retired. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nher a little present. My mind\xe2\x80\x99s so unsettled, I might never have thought\r\nof it but for her. Oh, if my boy is at the office still! Oh, if I can\r\nonly write a letter that will make him pity me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took up his pen, and sat thinking anxiously, thinking long, before he\r\ntouched the paper. Slowly, with many patient pauses to think and think\r\nagain, and with more than ordinary care to make his writing legible, he\r\ntraced these lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR JAMES--You will be surprised, I am afraid, to see my\r\nhandwriting. Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I am going to ask you for money, or to\r\nreproach you for having sold me out of house and home when you forfeited\r\nyour security, and I had to pay. I am willing and anxious to let\r\nby-gones be by-gones, and to forget the past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is in your power (if you are still at the Private Inquiry Office) to\r\ndo me a great service. I am in sore anxiety and trouble on the subject\r\nof a person in whom I am interested. The person is a lady. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake game of me for confessing this, if you can help it. If you knew\r\nwhat I am now suffering, I think you would be more inclined to pity than\r\nto make game of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would enter into particulars, only I know your quick temper, and I\r\nfear exhausting your patience. Perhaps it may be enough to say that\r\nI have reason to believe the lady\xe2\x80\x99s past life has not been a very\r\ncreditable one, and that I am interested--more interested than words can\r\ntell--in finding out what her life has really been, and in making the\r\ndiscovery within a fortnight from the present time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough I know very little about the ways of business in an office like\r\nyours, I can understand that, without first having the lady\xe2\x80\x99s present\r\naddress, nothing can be done to help me. Unfortunately, I am not yet\r\nacquainted with her present address. I only know that she went to town\r\nto-day, accompanied by a gentleman, in whose employment I now am, and\r\nwho (as I believe) will be likely to write to me for money before many\r\ndays more are over his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this circumstance of a nature to help us? I venture to say \xe2\x80\x98us,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbecause I count already, my dear boy, on your kind assistance and\r\nadvice. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let money stand between us; I have saved a little\r\nsomething, and it is all freely at your disposal. Pray, pray write to\r\nme by return of post! If you will only try your best to end the dreadful\r\nsuspense under which I am now suffering, you will atone for all the\r\ngrief and disappointment you caused me in times that are past, and you\r\nwill confer an obligation that he will never forget on\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour affectionate father,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFELIX BASHWOOD.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a little, to dry his eyes, Mr. Bashwood added the date\r\nand address, and directed the letter to his son, at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Private Inquiry\r\nOffice, Shadyside Place, London.\xe2\x80\x9d That done, he went out at once, and\r\nposted his letter with his own hands. It was then Monday; and, if the\r\nanswer was sent by return of post, the answer would be received on\r\nWednesday morning.\r\n\r\nThe interval day, the Tuesday, was passed by Mr. Bashwood in the\r\nsteward\xe2\x80\x99s office at the great house. He had a double motive for\r\nabsorbing himself as deeply as might be in the various occupations\r\nconnected with the management of the estate. In the first place,\r\nemployment helped him to control the devouring impatience with which\r\nhe looked for the coming of the next day. In the second place, the more\r\nforward he was with the business of the office, the more free he would\r\nbe to join his son in London, without attracting suspicion to himself by\r\nopenly neglecting the interests placed under his charge.\r\n\r\nToward the Tuesday afternoon, vague rumors of something wrong at\r\nthe cottage found their way (through Major Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s servants) to the\r\nservants at the great house, and attempted ineffectually through this\r\nlatter channel to engage the attention of Mr. Bashwood, impenetrably\r\nfixed on other things. The major and Miss Neelie had been shut up\r\ntogether in mysterious conference; and Miss Neelie\xe2\x80\x99s appearance after\r\nthe close of the interview plainly showed that she had been crying. This\r\nhad happened on the Monday afternoon; and on the next day (that present\r\nTuesday) the major had startled the household by announcing briefly\r\nthat his daughter wanted a change to the air of the seaside, and that\r\nhe proposed taking her himself, by the next train, to Lowestoft. The\r\ntwo had gone away together, both very serious and silent, but both,\r\napparently, very good friends, for all that. Opinions at the great\r\nhouse attributed this domestic revolution to the reports current on the\r\nsubject of Allan and Miss Gwilt. Opinions at the cottage rejected\r\nthat solution of the difficulty, on practical grounds. Miss Neelie had\r\nremained inaccessibly shut up in her own room, from the Monday afternoon\r\nto the Tuesday morning when her father took her away. The major, during\r\nthe same interval, had not been outside the door, and had spoken to\r\nnobody And Mrs. Milroy, at the first attempt of her new attendant\r\nto inform her of the prevailing scandal in the town, had sealed the\r\nservant\xe2\x80\x99s lips by flying into one of her terrible passions the instant\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s name was mentioned. Something must have happened, of\r\ncourse, to take Major Milroy and his daughter so suddenly from home; but\r\nthat something was certainly not Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s scandalous elopement, in\r\nbroad daylight, with Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon passed, and the evening passed, and no other event\r\nhappened but the purely private and personal event which had taken place\r\nat the cottage. Nothing occurred (for nothing in the nature of things\r\n_could_ occur) to dissipate the delusion on which Miss Gwilt had\r\ncounted--the delusion which all Thorpe Ambrose now shared with Mr.\r\nBashwood, that she had gone privately to London with Allan in the\r\ncharacter of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s future wife.\r\n\r\nOn the Wednesday morning, the postman, entering the street in which Mr.\r\nBashwood lived, was encountered by Mr. Bashwood himself, so eager to\r\nknow if there was a letter for him that he had come out without his hat.\r\nThere _was_ a letter for him--the letter that he longed for from his\r\nvagabond son.\r\n\r\nThese were the terms in which Bashwood the younger answered his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupplication for help--after having previously ruined his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprospects for life:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShadyside Place. Tuesday, July 29th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR DAD--We have some little practice in dealing with mysteries at\r\nthis office; but the mystery of your letter beats me altogether. Are you\r\nspeculating on the interesting hidden frailties of some charming woman?\r\nOr, after _your_ experience of matrimony, are you actually going to give\r\nme a stepmother at this time of day? Whichever it is, upon my life your\r\nletter interests me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not joking, mind--though the temptation is not an easy one to\r\nresist. On the contrary, I have given you a quarter of an hour of my\r\nvaluable time already. The place you date from sounded somehow familiar\r\nto me. I referred back to the memorandum book, and found that I was sent\r\ndown to Thorpe Ambrose to make private inquiries not very long since.\r\nMy employer was a lively old lady, who was too sly to give us her right\r\nname and address. As a matter of course, we set to work at once, and\r\nfound out who she was. Her name is Mrs. Oldershaw; and, if you think of\r\n_her_ for my stepmother, I strongly recommend you to think again before\r\nyou make her Mrs. Bashwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is not Mrs. Oldershaw, then all I can do, so far, is to tell you\r\nhow you may find out the unknown lady\xe2\x80\x99s address. Come to town yourself\r\nas soon as you get the letter you expect from the gentleman who has gone\r\naway with her (I hope he is not a handsome young man, for your sake)\r\nand call here. I will send somebody to help you in watching his hotel\r\nor lodgings; and if he communicates with the lady, or the lady with him,\r\nyou may consider her address discovered from that moment. Once let me\r\nidentify her, and know where she is, and you shall see all her\r\ncharming little secrets as plainly as you see the paper on which your\r\naffectionate son is now writing to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA word more about the terms. I am as willing as you are to be friends\r\nagain; but, though I own you were out of pocket by me once, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nafford to be out of pocket by you. It must be understood that you are\r\nanswerable for all the expenses of the inquiry. We may have to employ\r\nsome of the women attached to this office, if your lady is too wideawake\r\nor too nice-looking to be dealt with by a man. There will be cab hire,\r\nand postage-stamps--admissions to public amusements, if she is inclined\r\nthat way--shillings for pew-openers, if she is serious, and takes\r\nour people into churches to hear popular preachers, and so on. My own\r\nprofessional services you shall have gratis; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t lose by you as\r\nwell. Only remember that, and you shall have your way. By-gones shall be\r\nby-gones, and we will forget the past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour affectionate son,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJAMES BASHWOOD.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ecstasy of seeing help placed at last within his reach, the\r\nfather put his son\xe2\x80\x99s atrocious letter to his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cMy good boy!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmurmured, tenderly--\xe2\x80\x9cmy dear, good boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put the letter down, and fell into a new train of thought. The next\r\nquestion to face was the serious question of time. Mr. Pedgift had told\r\nhim Miss Gwilt might be married in a fortnight. One day of the\r\nfourteen had passed already, and another was passing. He beat his hand\r\nimpatiently on the table at his side, wondering how soon the want of\r\nmoney would force Allan to write to him from London. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cOr next day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe morrow passed, and nothing happened. The next day came, and the\r\nletter arrived! It was on business, as he had anticipated; it asked\r\nfor money, as he had anticipated; and there, at the end of it, in a\r\npostscript, was the address added, concluding with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cYou may\r\ncount on my staying here till further notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave one deep gasp of relief, and instantly busied himself--though\r\nthere were nearly two hours to spare before the train started for\r\nLondon--in packing his bag. The last thing he put in was his blue satin\r\ncravat. \xe2\x80\x9cShe likes bright colors,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand she may see me in it\r\nyet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. MISS GWILT\xe2\x80\x99S DIARY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll Saints\xe2\x80\x99 Terrace, New Road, London, July 28th, Monday night.--I can\r\nhardly hold my head up, I am so tired. But in my situation, I dare not\r\ntrust anything to memory. Before I go to bed, I must write my customary\r\nrecord of the events of the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far, the turn of luck in my favor (it was long enough before it\r\ntook the turn!) seems likely to continue. I succeeded in forcing\r\nArmadale--the brute required nothing short of forcing!--to leave Thorpe\r\nAmbrose for London, alone in the same carriage with me, before all the\r\npeople in the station. There was a full attendance of dealers in small\r\nscandal, all staring hard at us, and all evidently drawing their own\r\nconclusions. Either I knew nothing of Thorpe Ambrose--or the town gossip\r\nis busy enough by this time with Mr. Armadale and Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had some difficulty with him for the first half-hour after we left\r\nthe station. The guard (delightful man! I felt so grateful to him!) had\r\nshut us up together, in expectation of half a crown at the end of the\r\njourney. Armadale was suspicious of me, and he showed it plainly. Little\r\nby little I tamed my wild beast--partly by taking care to display no\r\ncuriosity about his journey to town, and partly by interesting him\r\non the subject of his friend Midwinter; dwelling especially on the\r\nopportunity that now offered itself for a reconciliation between them.\r\nI kept harping on this string till I set his tongue going, and made\r\nhim amuse me as a gentleman is bound to do when he has the honor of\r\nescorting a lady on a long railway journey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat little mind he has was full, of course, of his own affairs and\r\nMiss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s. No words can express the clumsiness he showed in\r\ntrying to talk about himself, without taking me into his confidence or\r\nmentioning Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was going to London, he gravely informed me, on a matter of\r\nindescribable interest to him. It was a secret for the present, but he\r\nhoped to tell it me soon; it had made a great difference already in the\r\nway in which he looked at the slanders spoken of him in Thorpe Ambrose;\r\nhe was too happy to care what the scandal-mongers said of him now, and\r\nhe should soon stop their mouths by appearing in a new character that\r\nwould surprise them all. So he blundered on, with the firm persuasion\r\nthat he was keeping me quite in the dark. It was hard not to laugh, when\r\nI thought of my anonymous letter on its way to the major; but I managed\r\nto control myself--though, I must own, with some difficulty. As the\r\ntime wore on, I began to feel a terrible excitement; the position was, I\r\nthink, a little too much for me. There I was, alone with him, talking in\r\nthe most innocent, easy, familiar manner, and having it in my mind all\r\nthe time to brush his life out of my way, when the moment comes, as I\r\nmight brush a stain off my gown. It made my blood leap, and my cheeks\r\nflush. I caught myself laughing once or twice much louder than I ought;\r\nand long before we got to London I thought it desirable to put my face\r\nin hiding by pulling down my veil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no difficulty, on reaching the terminus, in getting him to\r\ncome in the cab with me to the hotel where Midwinter is staying. He was\r\nall eagerness to be reconciled with his dear friend--principally, I have\r\nno doubt, because he wants the dear friend to lend a helping hand to the\r\nelopement. The real difficulty lay, of course, with Midwinter. My sudden\r\njourney to London had allowed me no opportunity of writing to combat his\r\nsuperstitious conviction that he and his former friend are better apart.\r\nI thought it wise to leave Armadale in the cab at the door, and to go\r\ninto the hotel by myself to pave the way for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately, Midwinter had not gone out. His delight at seeing me some\r\ndays sooner than he had hoped had something infectious in it, I suppose.\r\nPooh! I may own the truth to my own diary! There was a moment when _I_\r\nforgot everything in the world but our two selves as completely as he\r\ndid. I felt as if I was back in my teens--until I remembered the lout in\r\nthe cab at the door. And then I was five-and-thirty again in an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis face altered when he heard who was below, and what it was I wanted\r\nof him; he looked not angry, but distressed. He yielded, however, before\r\nlong, not to my reasons, for I gave him none, but to my entreaties.\r\nHis old fondness for his friend might possibly have had some share in\r\npersuading him against his will; but my own opinion is that he acted\r\nentirely under the influence of his fondness for Me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waited in the sitting-room while he went down to the door; so I\r\nknew nothing of what passed between them when they first saw each other\r\nagain. But oh, the difference between the two men when the interval had\r\npassed, and they came upstairs together and joined me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were both agitated, but in such different ways! The hateful\r\nArmadale, so loud and red and clumsy; the dear, lovable Midwinter, so\r\npale and quiet, with such a gentleness in his voice when he spoke, and\r\nsuch tenderness in his eyes every time they turned my way. Armadale\r\noverlooked me as completely as if I had not been in the room. _He_\r\nreferred to me over and over again in the conversation; _he_ constantly\r\nlooked at me to see what I thought, while I sat in my corner silently\r\nwatching them; _he_ wanted to go with me and see me safe to my lodgings,\r\nand spare me all trouble with the cabman and the luggage. When I thanked\r\nhim and declined, Armadale looked unaffectedly relieved at the prospect\r\nof seeing my back turned, and of having his friend all to himself.\r\nI left him, with his awkward elbows half over the table, scrawling a\r\nletter (no doubt to Miss Milroy), and shouting to the waiter that he\r\nwanted a bed at the hotel. I had calculated on his staying, as a matter\r\nof course, where he found his friend staying. It was pleasant to find my\r\nanticipations realized, and to know that I have as good as got him now\r\nunder my own eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter promising to let Midwinter know where he could see me to-morrow,\r\nI went away in the cab to hunt for lodgings by myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith some difficulty I have succeeded in getting an endurable\r\nsitting-room and bedroom in this house, where the people are perfect\r\nstrangers to me. Having paid a week\xe2\x80\x99s rent in advance (for I naturally\r\npreferred dispensing with a reference), I find myself with exactly\r\nthree shillings and ninepence left in my purse. It is impossible to ask\r\nMidwinter for money, after he has already paid Mrs. Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s note\r\nof hand. I must borrow something to-morrow on my watch and chain at the\r\npawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s. Enough to keep me going for a fortnight is all, and\r\nmore than all, that I want. In that time, or in less than that time,\r\nMidwinter will have married me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 29th.--Two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--Early in the morning I sent a line to\r\nMidwinter, telling him that he would find me here at three this\r\nafternoon. That done, I devoted the morning to two errands of my own.\r\nOne is hardly worth mentioning--it was only to raise money on my watch\r\nand chain. I got more than I expected; and more (even supposing I buy\r\nmyself one or two little things in the way of cheap summer dress) than I\r\nam at all likely to spend before the wedding-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other errand was of a far more serious kind. It led me into an\r\nattorney\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was well aware last night (though I was too weary to put it down in\r\nmy diary), that I could not possibly see Midwinter this morning--in the\r\nposition he now occupies toward me--without at least _appearing_ to take\r\nhim into my confidence on the subject of myself and my circumstances.\r\nExcepting one necessary consideration which I must be careful not\r\nto overlook. There is not the least difficulty in my drawing on my\r\ninvention, and telling him any story I please--for thus far I have\r\ntold no story to anybody. Midwinter went away to London before it was\r\npossible to approach the subject. As to the Milroys (having provided\r\nthem with the customary reference), I could fortunately keep them at\r\narms-length on all questions relating purely to myself. And lastly, when\r\nI affected my reconciliation with Armadale on the drive in front of\r\nthe house, he was fool enough to be too generous to let me defend my\r\ncharacter. When I had expressed my regret for having lost my temper and\r\nthreatened Miss Milroy, and when I had accepted his assurance that\r\nmy pupil had never done or meant to do me any injury, he was too\r\nmagnanimous to hear a word on the subject of my private affairs. Thus I\r\nam quite unfettered by any former assertions of my own; and I may tell\r\nany story I please--with the one drawback hinted at already in the shape\r\nof a restraint. Whatever I may invent in the way of pure fiction, I must\r\npreserve the character in which I have appeared at Thorpe Ambrose; for,\r\nwith the notoriety that is attached to _my other name_, I have no other\r\nchoice but to marry Midwinter in my maiden name as \xe2\x80\x98Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was the consideration that took me into the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s office. I\r\nfelt that I must inform myself, before I saw Midwinter later in the day,\r\nof any awkward consequences that may follow the marriage of a widow if\r\nshe conceals her widow\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnowing of no other professional person whom I could trust, I went\r\nboldly to the lawyer who had my interests in his charge, at that\r\nterrible past time in my life, which I have more reason than ever to\r\nshrink from thinking of now. He was astonished, and, as I could plainly\r\ndetect, by no means pleased to see me. I had hardly opened my lips\r\nbefore he said he hoped I was not consulting him _again_ (with a strong\r\nemphasis on the word) on my own account. I took the hint, and put the\r\nquestion I had come to ask, in the interests of that accommodating\r\npersonage on such occasions--an absent friend. The lawyer evidently saw\r\nthrough it at once; but he was sharp enough to turn my \xe2\x80\x98friend\xe2\x80\x99 to good\r\naccount on his side. He said he would answer the question as a matter\r\nof courtesy toward a lady represented by myself; but he must make it a\r\ncondition that this consultation of him by deputy should go no further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accepted his terms; for I really respected the clever manner in which\r\nhe contrived to keep me at arms-length without violating the laws of\r\ngood-breeding. In two minutes I heard what he had to say, mastered it in\r\nmy own mind, and went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShort as it was, the consultation told me everything I wanted to know.\r\nI risk nothing by marrying Midwinter in my maiden instead of my widow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname. The marriage is a good marriage in this way: that it can only be\r\nset aside if my husband finds out the imposture, and takes proceedings\r\nto invalidate our marriage in my lifetime. That is the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s answer\r\nin the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s own words. It relieves me at once--in this direction,\r\nat any rate--of all apprehension about the future. The only imposture\r\nmy husband will ever discover--and then only if he happens to be on\r\nthe spot--is the imposture that puts me in the place, and gives me the\r\nincome of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow; and by that time I shall have invalidated\r\nmy own marriage forever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf-past two! Midwinter will be here in half an hour. I must go and\r\nask my glass how I look. I must rouse my invention, and make up my\r\nlittle domestic romance. Am I feeling nervous about it? Something\r\nflutters in the place where my heart used to be. At five-and-thirty,\r\ntoo! and after such a life as mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSix o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--He has just gone. The day for our marriage is a day\r\ndetermined on already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have tried to rest and recover myself. I can\xe2\x80\x99t rest. I have come back\r\nto these leaves. There is much to be written in them since Midwinter has\r\nbeen here, that concerns me nearly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me begin with what I hate most to remember, and so be the sooner\r\ndone with it--let me begin with the paltry string of falsehoods which I\r\ntold him about my family troubles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _can_ be the secret of this man\xe2\x80\x99s hold on me? How is it that he\r\nalters me so that I hardly know myself again? I was like myself in the\r\nrailway carriage yesterday with Armadale. It was surely frightful to be\r\ntalking to the living man, through the whole of that long journey, with\r\nthe knowledge in me all the while that I meant to be his widow--and yet\r\nI was only excited and fevered. Hour after hour I never shrunk once from\r\nspeaking to Armadale; but the first trumpery falsehood I told Midwinter\r\nturned me cold when I saw that he believed it! I felt a dreadful\r\nhysterical choking in the throat when he entreated me not to reveal my\r\ntroubles. And once--I am horrified when I think of it--once, when he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98If I _could_ love you more dearly, I should love you more dearly\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x99 I was within a hair-breadth of turning traitor to myself. I was\r\non the very point of crying out to him, \xe2\x80\x98Lies! all lies! I\xe2\x80\x99m a fiend in\r\nhuman shape! Marry the wretchedest creature that prowls the streets,\r\nand you will marry a better woman than me!\xe2\x80\x99 Yes! the seeing his eyes\r\nmoisten, the hearing his voice tremble, while I was deceiving him, shook\r\nme in that way. I have seen handsomer men by hundreds, cleverer men by\r\ndozens. What can this man have roused in me? Is it Love? I thought I\r\n_had_ loved, never to love again. Does a woman not love when the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhardness to her drives her to drown herself? A man drove _me_ to that\r\nlast despair in days gone by. Did all my misery at that time come from\r\nsomething which was not Love? Have I lived to be five-and-thirty, and\r\nam I only feeling now what Love really is?--now, when it is too late?\r\nRidiculous! Besides, what is the use of asking? What do I know about\r\nit? What does any woman ever know? The more we think of it, the more\r\nwe deceive ourselves. I wish I had been born an animal. My beauty might\r\nhave been of some use to me then--it might have got me a good master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a whole page of my diary filled; and nothing written yet that\r\nis of the slightest use to me! My miserable made-up story must be told\r\nover again here, while the incidents are fresh in my memory--or how am I\r\nto refer to it consistently on after-occasions when I may be obliged to\r\nspeak of it again?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was nothing new in what I told him; it was the commonplace\r\nrubbish of the circulating libraries. A dead father; a lost fortune;\r\nvagabond brothers, whom I dread ever seeing again; a bedridden mother\r\ndependent on my exertions--No! I can\xe2\x80\x99t write it down! I hate myself,\r\nI despise myself, when I remember that _he_ believed it because I said\r\nit--that _he_ was distressed by it because it was my story! I will\r\nface the chances of contradicting myself--I will risk discovery and\r\nruin--anything rather than dwell on that contemptible deception of him a\r\nmoment longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lies came to an end at last. And then he talked to me of himself and\r\nof his prospects. Oh, what a relief it was to turn to that at the time!\r\nWhat a relief it is to come to it now!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has accepted the offer about which he wrote to me at Thorpe Ambrose;\r\nand he is now engaged as occasional foreign correspondent to the new\r\nnewspaper. His first destination is Naples. I wish it had been some\r\nother place, for I have certain past associations with Naples which I\r\nam not at all anxious to renew. It has been arranged that he is to\r\nleave England not later than the eleventh of next month. By that time,\r\ntherefore, I, who am to go with him, must go with him as his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not the slightest difficulty about the marriage. All this part\r\nof it is so easy that I begin to dread an accident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe proposal to keep the thing strictly private--which it might have\r\nembarrassed me to make--comes from Midwinter. Marrying me in his own\r\nname--the name that he has kept concealed from every living creature but\r\nmyself and Mr. Brock--it is his interest that not a soul who knows him\r\nshould be present at the ceremony; his friend Armadale least of all.\r\nHe has been a week in London already. When another week has passed, he\r\nproposes to get the License, and to be married in the church belonging\r\nto the parish in which the hotel is situated. These are the only\r\nnecessary formalities. I had but to say \xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x99 (he told me), and to feel\r\nno further anxiety about the future. I said \xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x99 with such a devouring\r\nanxiety about the future that I was afraid he would see it. What minutes\r\nthe next few minutes were, when he whispered delicious words to me,\r\nwhile I hid my face on his breast!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recovered myself first, and led him back to the subject of Armadale,\r\nhaving my own reasons for wanting to know what they said to each other\r\nafter I had left them yesterday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe manner in which Midwinter replied showed me that he was speaking\r\nunder the restraint of respecting a confidence placed in him by his\r\nfriend. Long before he had done, I detected what the confidence was.\r\nArmadale had been consulting him (exactly as I anticipated) on the\r\nsubject of the elopement. Although he appears to have remonstrated\r\nagainst taking the girl secretly away from her home, Midwinter seems\r\nto have felt some delicacy about speaking strongly, remembering (widely\r\ndifferent as the circumstances are) that he was contemplating a private\r\nmarriage himself. I gathered, at any rate, that he had produced very\r\nlittle effect by what he had said; and that Armadale had already carried\r\nout his absurd intention of consulting the head-clerk in the office of\r\nhis London lawyers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving got as far as this, Midwinter put the question which I felt must\r\ncome sooner or later. He asked if I objected to our engagement being\r\nmentioned, in the strictest secrecy, to his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I will answer,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98for Allan\xe2\x80\x99s respecting any confidence that\r\nI place in him. And I will undertake, when the time comes, so to use my\r\ninfluence over him as to prevent his being present at the marriage, and\r\ndiscovering (what he must never know) that my name is the same as his\r\nown. It would help me,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, \xe2\x80\x98to speak more strongly about the\r\nobject that has brought him to London, if I can requite the frankness\r\nwith which he has spoken of his private affairs to me by the same\r\nfrankness on my side.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no choice but to give the necessary permission, and I gave it. It\r\nis of the utmost importance to me to know what course Major Milroy takes\r\nwith his daughter and Armadale after receiving my anonymous letter; and,\r\nunless I invite Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in some way, I am nearly certain\r\nto be kept in the dark. Let him once be trusted with the knowledge that\r\nI am to be Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and what he tells his friend about his love\r\naffair he will tell me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it had been understood between us that Armadale was to be taken\r\ninto our confidence, we began to talk about ourselves again. How the\r\ntime flew! What a sweet enchantment it was to forget everything in his\r\narms! How he loves me!--ah, poor fellow, how he loves me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have promised to meet him to-morrow morning in the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park. The\r\nless he is seen here the better. The people in this house are strangers\r\nto me, certainly; but it may be wise to consult appearances, as if I\r\nwas still at Thorpe Ambrose, and not to produce the impression, even on\r\ntheir minds, that Midwinter is engaged to me. If any after-inquiries are\r\nmade, when I have run my grand risk, the testimony of my London landlady\r\nmight be testimony worth having.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat wretched old Bashwood! Writing of Thorpe Ambrose reminds me of\r\nhim. What will he say when the town gossip tells him that Armadale has\r\ntaken me to London, in a carriage reserved for ourselves? It really is\r\ntoo absurd in a man of Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s age and appearance to presume to be in\r\nlove!....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 30th.--News at last! Armadale has heard from Miss Milroy. My\r\nanonymous letter has produced its effect. The girl is removed from\r\nThorpe Ambrose already; and the whole project of the elopement is\r\nblown to the winds at once and forever. This was the substance of what\r\nMidwinter had to tell me when I met him in the Park. I affected to be\r\nexcessively astonished, and to feel the necessary feminine longing\r\nto know all the particulars. \xe2\x80\x98Not that I expect to have my curiosity\r\nsatisfied,\xe2\x80\x99 I added, \xe2\x80\x98for Mr. Armadale and I are little better than mere\r\nacquaintances, after all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You are far more than a mere acquaintance in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMidwinter. \xe2\x80\x98Having your permission to trust him, I have already told him\r\nhow near and dear you are to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHearing this, I thought it desirable, before I put any questions about\r\nMiss Milroy, to attend to my own interests first, and to find out what\r\neffect the announcement of my coming marriage had produced on Armadale.\r\nIt was possible that he might be still suspicious of me, and that the\r\ninquiries he made in London, at Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s instigation, might be\r\nstill hanging on his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Did Mr. Armadale seem surprised,\xe2\x80\x99 I asked, \xe2\x80\x98when you told him of\r\nour engagement, and when you said it was to be kept a secret from\r\neverybody?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He seemed greatly surprised,\xe2\x80\x99 said Midwinter, \xe2\x80\x98to hear that we were\r\ngoing to be married. All he said when I told him it must be kept a\r\nsecret was that he supposed there were reasons on your side for making\r\nthe marriage a private one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What did you say,\xe2\x80\x99 I inquired, \xe2\x80\x98when he made that remark?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I said the reasons were on my side,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x98And I\r\nthought it right to add--considering that Allan had allowed himself to\r\nbe misled by the ignorant distrust of you at Thorpe Ambrose--that you\r\nhad confided to me the whole of your sad family story, and that you had\r\namply justified your unwillingness; under any ordinary circumstances, to\r\nspeak of your private affairs.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cI breathed freely again. He had said just what was wanted, just in the\r\nright way.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98for putting me right in your friend\xe2\x80\x99s estimation.\r\nDoes he wish to see me?\xe2\x80\x99 I added, by way of getting back to the other\r\nsubject of Miss Milroy and the elopement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He is longing to see you,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x98He is in great\r\ndistress, poor fellow--distress which I have done my best to soothe,\r\nbut which, I believe, would yield far more readily to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy\r\nthan to mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Where is he now?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was at the hotel; and to the hotel I instantly proposed that we\r\nshould go. It is a busy, crowded place; and (with my veil down) I\r\nhave less fear of compromising myself there than at my quiet lodgings.\r\nBesides, it is vitally important to me to know what Armadale does next,\r\nunder this total change of circumstances--for I must so control his\r\nproceedings as to get him away from England if I can. We took a cab:\r\nsuch was my eagerness to sympathize with the heart-broken lover, that we\r\ntook a cab!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything so ridiculous as Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s behavior under the double shock of\r\ndiscovering that his young lady has been taken away from him, and that\r\nI am to be married to Midwinter, I never before witnessed in all my\r\nexperience. To say that he was like a child is a libel on all children\r\nwho are not born idiots. He congratulated me on my coming marriage,\r\nand execrated the unknown wretch who had written the anonymous letter,\r\nlittle thinking that he was speaking of one and the same person in one\r\nand the same breath. Now he submissively acknowledged that Major Milroy\r\nhad his rights as a father, and now he reviled the major as having no\r\nfeeling for anything but his mechanics and his clock. At one moment he\r\nstarted up, with the tears in his eyes, and declared that his \xe2\x80\x98darling\r\nNeelie\xe2\x80\x99 was an angel on earth. At another he sat down sulkily, and\r\nthought that a girl of her spirit might have run away on the spot and\r\njoined him in London. After a good half-hour of this absurd exhibition,\r\nI succeeded in quieting him; and then a few words of tender inquiry\r\nproduced what I had expressly come to the hotel to see--Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was outrageously long, and rambling, and confused; in short, the\r\nletter of a fool. I had to wade through plenty of vulgar sentiment and\r\nlamentation, and to lose time and patience over maudlin outbursts of\r\naffection, and nauseous kisses inclosed in circles of ink. However, I\r\ncontrived to extract the information I wanted at last; and here it is:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe major, on receipt of my anonymous warning, appears to have sent at\r\nonce for his daughter, and to have shown her the letter. \xe2\x80\x98You know what\r\na hard life I lead with your mother; don\xe2\x80\x99t make it harder still, Neelie,\r\nby deceiving me.\xe2\x80\x99 That was all the poor old gentleman said. I always did\r\nlike the major; and, though he was afraid to show it, I know he always\r\nliked me. His appeal to his daughter (if _her_ account of it is to be\r\nbelieved) cut her to the heart. She burst out crying (let her alone for\r\ncrying at the right moment!) and confessed everything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter giving her time to recover herself (if he had given her a good\r\nbox on the ears it would have been more to the purpose!), the major\r\nseems to have put certain questions, and to have become convinced (as I\r\nwas convinced myself) that his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s heart, or fancy, or whatever\r\nshe calls it, was really and truly set on Armadale. The discovery\r\nevidently distressed as well as surprised him. He appears to have\r\nhesitated, and to have maintained his own unfavorable opinion of Miss\r\nNeelie\xe2\x80\x99s lover for some little time. But his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s tears and\r\nentreaties (so like the weakness of the dear old gentleman!) shook him\r\nat last. Though he firmly refused to allow of any marriage engagement at\r\npresent, he consented to overlook the clandestine meetings in the park,\r\nand to put Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s fitness to become his son-in-law to the test, on\r\ncertain conditions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese conditions are, that for the next six months to come all\r\ncommunication is to be broken off, both personally and by writing,\r\nbetween Armadale and Miss Milroy. That space of time is to be occupied\r\nby the young gentleman as he himself thinks best, and by the young lady\r\nin completing her education at school. If, when the six months have\r\npassed, they are both still of the same mind, and if Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\r\nin the interval has been such as to improve the major\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of him,\r\nhe will be allowed to present himself in the character of Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuitor, and, in six months more, if all goes well, the marriage may take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare I could kiss the dear old major, if I was only within reach\r\nof him! If I had been at his elbow, and had dictated the conditions\r\nmyself, I could have asked for nothing better than this. Six months\r\nof total separation between Armadale and Miss Milroy! In half that\r\ntime--with all communication cut off between the two--it must go\r\nhard with me, indeed, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t find myself dressed in the necessary\r\nmourning, and publicly recognized as Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am forgetting the girl\xe2\x80\x99s letter. She gives her father\xe2\x80\x99s reasons\r\nfor making his conditions, in her father\xe2\x80\x99s own words. The major seems\r\nto have spoken so sensibly and so feelingly that he left his daughter no\r\ndecent alternative--and he leaves Armadale no decent alternative--but to\r\nsubmit. As well as I can remember, he seems to have expressed himself to\r\nMiss Neelie in these, or nearly in these terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am behaving cruelly to you, my dear: I am merely asking\r\nyou to put Mr. Armadale to the proof. It is not only right, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary, that you should hold no communication with him for\r\nsome time to come; and I will show you why. In the first place, if you\r\ngo to school, the necessary rules in such places--necessary for the\r\nsake of the other girls--would not permit you to see Mr. Armadale or to\r\nreceive letters from him; and, if you are to become mistress of Thorpe\r\nAmbrose, to school you must go, for you would be ashamed, and I should\r\nbe ashamed, if you occupied the position of a lady of station without\r\nhaving the accomplishments which all ladies of station are expected to\r\npossess. In the second place, I want to see whether Mr. Armadale will\r\ncontinue to think of you as he thinks now, without being encouraged in\r\nhis attachment by seeing you, or reminded of it by hearing from you. If\r\nI am wrong in thinking him flighty and unreliable, and if your opinion\r\nof him is the right one, this is not putting the young man to an unfair\r\ntest--true love survives much longer separations than a separation of\r\nsix months. And when that time is over, and well over; and when I have\r\nhad him under my own eye for another six months, and have learned to\r\nthink as highly of him as you do--even then, my dear, after all that\r\nterrible delay, you will still be a married woman before you are\r\neighteen. Think of this, Neelie, and show that you love me and trust me,\r\nby accepting my proposal. I will hold no communication with Mr. Armadale\r\nmyself. I will leave it to you to write and tell him what has been\r\ndecided on. He may write back one letter, and one only, to acquaint you\r\nwith his decision. After that, for the sake of your reputation, nothing\r\nmore is to be said, and nothing more is to be done, and the matter is to\r\nbe kept strictly private until the six months\xe2\x80\x99 interval is at an end.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo this effect the major spoke. His behavior to that little slut of a\r\ngirl has produced a stronger impression on me than anything else in the\r\nletter. It has set me thinking (me, of all the people in the world!) of\r\nwhat they call \xe2\x80\x98a moral difficulty.\xe2\x80\x99 We are perpetually told that there\r\ncan be no possible connection between virtue and vice. Can there not?\r\nHere is Major Milroy doing exactly what an excellent father, at\r\nonce kind and prudent, affectionate and firm, would do under the\r\ncircumstances; and by that very course of conduct he has now smoothed\r\nthe way for _me_, as completely as if he had been the chosen accomplice\r\nof that abominable creature, Miss Gwilt. Only think of my reasoning in\r\nthis way! But I am in such good spirits, I can do anything to-day. I\r\nhave not looked so bright and so young as I look now for months past!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo return to the letter, for the last time--it is so excessively\r\ndull and stupid that I really can\xe2\x80\x99t help wandering away from it into\r\nreflections of my own, as a mere relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter solemnly announcing that she meant to sacrifice herself to her\r\nbeloved father\xe2\x80\x99s wishes (the brazen assurance of her setting up for a\r\nmartyr after what has happened exceeds anything I ever heard or read\r\nof!), Miss Neelie next mentioned that the major proposed taking her to\r\nthe seaside for change of air, during the few days that were still to\r\nelapse before she went to school. Armadale was to send his answer\r\nby return of post, and to address her, under cover to her father, at\r\nLowestoft. With this, and with a last outburst of tender protestation,\r\ncrammed crookedly into a corner of the page, the letter ended.\r\n(N.B.--The major\xe2\x80\x99s object in taking her to the seaside is plain enough.\r\nHe still privately distrusts Armadale, and he is wisely determined to\r\nprevent any more clandestine meetings in the park before the girl is\r\nsafely disposed of at school.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I had done with the letter--I had requested permission to read\r\nparts of it which I particularly admired, for the second and third\r\ntime!--we all consulted together in a friendly way about what Armadale\r\nwas to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was fool enough, at the outset, to protest against submitting to\r\nMajor Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s conditions. He declared, with his odious red face looking\r\nthe picture of brute health, that he should never survive a six\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x99 separation from his beloved Neelie. Midwinter (as may easily be\r\nimagined) seemed a little ashamed of him, and joined me in bringing\r\nhim to his senses. We showed him, what would have been plain enough\r\nto anybody but a booby, that there was no honorable or even decent\r\nalternative left but to follow the example of submission set by the\r\nyoung lady. \xe2\x80\x98Wait, and you will have her for your wife,\xe2\x80\x99 was what I\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x98Wait, and you will force the major to alter his unjust opinion of\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x99 was what Midwinter added. With two clever people hammering common\r\nsense into his head at that rate, it is needless to say that his head\r\ngave way, and he submitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving decided him to accept the major\xe2\x80\x99s conditions (I was careful\r\nto warn him, before he wrote to Miss Milroy, that my engagement to\r\nMidwinter was to be kept as strictly secret from her as from everybody\r\nelse), the next question we had to settle related to his future\r\nproceedings. I was ready with the necessary arguments to stop him, if he\r\nhad proposed returning to Thorpe Ambrose. But he proposed nothing of\r\nthe sort. On the contrary, he declared, of his own accord, that nothing\r\nwould induce him to go back. The place and the people were associated\r\nwith everything that was hateful to him. There would be no Miss Milroy\r\nnow to meet him in the park, and no Midwinter to keep him company in the\r\nsolitary house. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d rather break stones on the road,\xe2\x80\x99 was the sensible\r\nand cheerful way in which he put it, \xe2\x80\x98than go back to Thorpe Ambrose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first suggestion after this came from Midwinter. The sly old\r\nclergyman who gave Mrs. Oldershaw and me so much trouble has, it\r\nseems, been ill, but has been latterly reported better. \xe2\x80\x98Why not go to\r\nSomersetshire,\xe2\x80\x99 said Midwinter, \xe2\x80\x98and see your good friend, and my good\r\nfriend, Mr. Brock?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale caught at the proposal readily enough. He longed, in the first\r\nplace, to see \xe2\x80\x98dear old Brock,\xe2\x80\x99 and he longed, in the second place, to\r\nsee his yacht. After staying a few days more in London with Midwinter,\r\nhe would gladly go to Somersetshire. But what after that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing my opportunity, _I_ came to the rescue this time. \xe2\x80\x98You have got\r\na yacht, Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98and you know that Midwinter is going to\r\nItaly. When you are tired of Somersetshire, why not make a voyage to the\r\nMediterranean, and meet your friend, and your friend\xe2\x80\x99s wife, at Naples?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made the allusion to \xe2\x80\x98his friend\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x99 with the most becoming\r\nmodesty and confusion. Armadale was enchanted. I had hit on the best of\r\nall ways of occupying the weary time. He started up, and wrung my hand\r\nin quite an ecstasy of gratitude. How I do hate people who can only\r\nexpress their feelings by hurting other people\xe2\x80\x99s hands!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMidwinter was as pleased with my proposal as Armadale; but he saw\r\ndifficulties in the way of carrying it out. He considered the yacht too\r\nsmall for a cruise to the Mediterranean, and he thought it desirable to\r\nhire a larger vessel. His friend thought otherwise. I left them arguing\r\nthe question. It was quite enough for me to have made sure, in the first\r\nplace, that Armadale will not return to Thorpe Ambrose; and to have\r\ndecided him, in the second place, on going abroad. He may go how he\r\nlikes. I should prefer the small yacht myself; for there seems to be\r\na chance that the small yacht might do me the inestimable service of\r\ndrowning him....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--The excitement of feeling that I had got Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfuture movements completely under my own control made me so restless,\r\nwhen I returned to my lodgings, that I was obliged to go out again, and\r\ndo something. A new interest to occupy me being what I wanted, I went to\r\nPimlico to have it out with Mother Oldershaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI walked; and made up my mind, on the way, that I would begin by\r\nquarreling with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of my notes of hand being paid already, and Midwinter being willing\r\nto pay the other two when they fall due, my present position with the\r\nold wretch is as independent a one as I could desire. I always get the\r\nbetter of her when it comes to a downright battle between us, and find\r\nher wonderfully civil and obliging the moment I have made her feel that\r\nmine is the strongest will of the two. In my present situation, she\r\nmight be of use to me in various ways, if I could secure her assistance,\r\nwithout trusting her with secrets which I am now more than ever\r\ndetermined to keep to myself. That was my idea as I walked to Pimlico.\r\nUpsetting Mother Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s nerves, in the first place, and then\r\ntwisting her round my little finger, in the second, promised me, as I\r\nthought, an interesting occupation for the rest of the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I got to Pimlico, a surprise was in store for we. The house was\r\nshut up--not only on Mrs. Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s side, but on Doctor Downward\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nwell. A padlock was on the shop door; and a man was hanging about on the\r\nwatch, who might have been an ordinary idler certainly, but who looked,\r\nto my mind, like a policeman in disguise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnowing the risks the doctor runs in his particular form of practice,\r\nI suspected at once that something serious had happened, and that even\r\ncunning Mrs. Oldershaw was compromised this time. Without stopping, or\r\nmaking any inquiry, therefore, I called the first cab that passed me,\r\nand drove to the post-office to which I had desired my letters to be\r\nforwarded if any came for me after I left my Thorpe Ambrose lodging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn inquiry a letter was produced for \xe2\x80\x98Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x99 It was in Mother\r\nOldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, and it told me (as I had supposed) that the\r\ndoctor had got into a serious difficulty--that she was herself most\r\nunfortunately mixed up in the matter, and that they were both in hiding\r\nfor the present. The letter ended with some sufficiently venomous\r\nsentences about my conduct at Thorpe Ambrose, and with a warning that\r\nI have not heard the last of Mrs. Oldershaw yet. It relieved me to find\r\nher writing in this way--for she would have been civil and cringing if\r\nshe had had any suspicion of what I have really got in view. I burned\r\nthe letter as soon as the candles came up. And there, for the present,\r\nis an end of the connection between Mother Jezebel and me. I must do\r\nall my own dirty work now; and I shall be all the safer, perhaps, for\r\ntrusting nobody\xe2\x80\x99s hands to do it but my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 31st.--More useful information for me. I met Midwinter again in\r\nthe Park (on the pretext that my reputation might suffer if he called\r\ntoo often at my lodgings), and heard the last news of Armadale since I\r\nleft the hotel yesterday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter he had written to Miss Milroy, Midwinter took the opportunity\r\nof speaking to him about the necessary business arrangements during his\r\nabsence from the great house. It was decided that the servants should\r\nbe put on board wages, and that Mr. Bashwood should be left in charge.\r\n(Somehow, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like this re-appearance of Mr. Bashwood in connection\r\nwith my present interests, but there is no help for it.) The next\r\nquestion--the question of money--was settled at once by Mr. Armadale\r\nhimself. All his available ready-money (a large sum) is to be lodged by\r\nMr. Bashwood in Coutts\xe2\x80\x99s Bank, and to be there deposited in Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname. This, he said, would save him the worry of any further\r\nletter-writing to his steward, and would enable him to get what he\r\nwanted, when he went abroad, at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. The plan thus\r\nproposed, being certainly the simplest and the safest, was adopted with\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s full concurrence; and here the business discussion would\r\nhave ended, if the everlasting Mr. Bashwood had not turned up again in\r\nthe conversation, and prolonged it in an entirely new direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn reflection, it seems to have struck Midwinter that the whole\r\nresponsibility at Thorpe Ambrose ought not to rest on Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders. Without in the least distrusting him, Midwinter felt,\r\nnevertheless, that he ought to have somebody set over him, to apply to\r\nin case of emergency. Armadale made no objection to this; he only asked,\r\nin his helpless way, who the person was to be?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe answer was not an easy one to arrive at.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither of the two solicitors at Thorpe Ambrose might have been\r\nemployed, but Armadale was on bad terms with both of them. Any\r\nreconciliation with such a bitter enemy as the elder lawyer, Mr. Darch,\r\nwas out of the question; and reinstating Mr. Pedgift in his former\r\nposition implied a tacit sanction on Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s part of the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabominable conduct toward _me_, which was scarcely consistent with\r\nthe respect and regard that he felt for a lady who was soon to be his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s wife. After some further discussion, Midwinter hit on a new\r\nsuggestion which appeared to meet the difficulty. He proposed that\r\nArmadale should write to a respectable solicitor at Norwich, stating his\r\nposition in general terms, and requesting that gentleman to act as Mr.\r\nBashwood\xe2\x80\x99s adviser and superintendent when occasion required. Norwich\r\nbeing within an easy railway ride of Thorpe Ambrose, Armadale saw no\r\nobjection to the proposal, and promised to write to the Norwich lawyer.\r\nFearing that he might make some mistake if he wrote without assistance,\r\nMidwinter had drawn him out a draft of the necessary letter, and\r\nArmadale was now engaged in copying the draft, and also in writing to\r\nMr. Bashwood to lodge the money immediately in Coutts\xe2\x80\x99s Bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese details are so dry and uninteresting in themselves that I\r\nhesitated at first about putting them down in my diary. But a little\r\nreflection has convinced me that they are too important to be passed\r\nover. Looked at from my point of view, they mean this--that Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown act is now cutting him off from all communication with Thorpe\r\nAmbrose, even by letter. _He is as good as dead already to everybody he\r\nleaves behind him_. The causes which have led to such a result as that\r\nare causes which certainly claim the best place I can give them in these\r\npages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 1st.--Nothing to record, but that I have had a long, quiet,\r\nhappy day with Midwinter. He hired a carriage, and we drove to Richmond,\r\nand dined there. After to-day\xe2\x80\x99s experience, it is impossible to deceive\r\nmyself any longer. Come what may of it, I love him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have fallen into low spirits since he left me. A persuasion has\r\ntaken possession of my mind that the smooth and prosperous course of\r\nmy affairs since I have been in London is too smooth and prosperous to\r\nlast. There is something oppressing me to-night, which is more than the\r\noppression of the heavy London air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 2d.--Three o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--My presentiments, like other people\xe2\x80\x99s, have\r\ndeceived me often enough; but I am almost afraid that my presentiment of\r\nlast night was really prophetic, for once in a way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went after breakfast to a milliner\xe2\x80\x99s in this neighborhood to order a\r\nfew cheap summer things, and thence to Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s hotel to arrange with\r\nhim for another day in the country. I drove to the milliner\xe2\x80\x99s and to the\r\nhotel, and part of the way back. Then, feeling disgusted with the horrid\r\nclose smell of the cab (somebody had been smoking in it, I suppose), I\r\ngot out to walk the rest of the way. Before I had been two minutes on my\r\nfeet, I discovered that I was being followed by a strange man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis may mean nothing but that an idle fellow has been struck by\r\nmy figure, and my appearance generally. My face could have made no\r\nimpression on him, for it was hidden as usual by my veil. Whether he\r\nfollowed me (in a cab, of course) from the milliner\xe2\x80\x99s, or from the\r\nhotel, I cannot say. Nor am I quite certain whether he did or did not\r\ntrack me to this door. I only know that I lost sight of him before I got\r\nback. There is no help for it but to wait till events enlighten me. If\r\nthere is anything serious in what has happened, I shall soon discover\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--It _is_ serious. Ten minutes since, I was in my bedroom,\r\nwhich communicates with the sitting-room. I was just coming out, when I\r\nheard a strange voice on the landing outside--a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice. The next\r\ninstant the sitting-room door was suddenly opened; the woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Are these the apartments you have got to let?\xe2\x80\x99 and though the\r\nlandlady, behind her, answered, \xe2\x80\x98No! higher up, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 the woman came\r\non straight to my bedroom, as if she had not heard. I had just time to\r\nslam the door in her face before she saw me. The necessary explanations\r\nand apologies followed between the landlady and the stranger in the\r\nsitting-room, and then I was left alone again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no time to write more. It is plain that somebody has an interest\r\nin trying to identify me, and that, but for my own quickness, the\r\nstrange woman would have accomplished this object by taking me by\r\nsurprise. She and the man who followed me in the street are, I suspect,\r\nin league together; and there is probably somebody in the background\r\nwhose interests they are serving. Is Mother Oldershaw attacking me\r\nin the dark? or who else can it be? No matter who it is; my present\r\nsituation is too critical to be trifled with. I must get away from this\r\nhouse to-night, and leave no trace behind me by which I can be followed\r\nto another place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 3d.--Gary Street, Tottenham Court Road.--I got away last night\r\n(after writing an excuse to Midwinter, in which \xe2\x80\x98my invalid mother\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfigured as the all-sufficient cause of my disappearance); and I have\r\nfound refuge here. It has cost me some money; but my object is attained!\r\nNobody can possibly have traced me from All Saints\xe2\x80\x99 Terrace to this\r\naddress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter paying my landlady the necessary forfeit for leaving her without\r\nnotice, I arranged with her son that he should take my boxes in a cab to\r\nthe cloak-room at the nearest railway station, and send me the ticket\r\nin a letter, to wait my application for it at the post-office. While he\r\nwent his way in one cab, I went mine in another, with a few things for\r\nthe night in my little hand-bag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI drove straight to the milliner\xe2\x80\x99s shop, which I had observed, when\r\nI was there yesterday, had a back entrance into a mews, for the\r\napprentices to go in and out by. I went in at once, leaving the cab\r\nwaiting for me at the door. \xe2\x80\x98A man is following me,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98and I want\r\nto get rid of him. Here is my cab fare; wait ten minutes before you give\r\nit to the driver, and let me out at once by the back way!\xe2\x80\x99 In a moment I\r\nwas out in the mews; in another, I was in the next street; in a third, I\r\nhailed a passing omnibus, and was a free woman again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving now cut off all communication between me and my last lodgings,\r\nthe next precaution (in case Midwinter or Armadale are watched) is to\r\ncut off all communication, for some days to come at least, between me\r\nand the hotel. I have written to Midwinter--making my supposititious\r\nmother once more the excuse--to say that I am tied to my nursing duties,\r\nand that we must communicate by writing only for the present. Doubtful\r\nas I still am of who my hidden enemy really is, I can do no more to\r\ndefend myself than I have done now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 4th.--The two friends at the hotel had both written to me.\r\nMidwinter expresses his regret at our separation, in the tenderest\r\nterms. Armadale writes an entreaty for help under very awkward\r\ncircumstances. A letter from Major Milroy has been forwarded to him from\r\nthe great house, and he incloses it in his letter to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving left the seaside, and placed his daughter safely at the school\r\noriginally chosen for her (in the neighborhood of Ely), the major\r\nappears to have returned to Thorpe Ambrose at the close of last week; to\r\nhave heard then, for the first time, the reports about Armadale and me;\r\nand to have written instantly to Armadale to tell him so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter is stern and short. Major Milroy dismisses the report as\r\nunworthy of credit, because it is impossible for him to believe in such\r\nan act of \xe2\x80\x98cold-blooded treachery,\xe2\x80\x99 as the scandal would imply, if the\r\nscandal were true. He simply writes to warn Armadale that, if he is\r\nnot more careful in his actions for the future, he must resign all\r\npretensions to Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x98I neither expect, nor wish for,\r\nan answer to this\xe2\x80\x99 (the letter ends), \xe2\x80\x98for I desire to receive no mere\r\nprotestations in words. By your conduct, and by your conduct alone,\r\nI shall judge you as time goes on. Let me also add that I positively\r\nforbid you to consider this letter as an excuse for violating the terms\r\nagreed on between us, by writing again to my daughter. You have no need\r\nto justify yourself in her eyes, for I fortunately removed her from\r\nThorpe Ambrose before this abominable report had time to reach her;\r\nand I shall take good care, for her sake, that she is not agitated and\r\nunsettled by hearing it where she is now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s petition to me, under these circumstances, entreats (as I am\r\nthe innocent cause of the new attack on his character) that I will write\r\nto the major to absolve him of all indiscretion in the matter, and to\r\nsay that he could not, in common politeness, do otherwise than accompany\r\nme to London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgive the impudence of his request, in consideration of the news\r\nthat he sends me. It is certainly another circumstance in my favor\r\nthat the scandal at Thorpe Ambrose is not to be allowed to reach\r\nMiss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s ears. With her temper (if she did hear it) she might\r\ndo something desperate in the way of claiming her lover, and might\r\ncompromise me seriously. As for my own course with Armadale, it is easy\r\nenough. I shall quiet him by promising to write to Major Milroy; and I\r\nshall take the liberty, in my own private interests, of not keeping my\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing in the least suspicious has happened to-day. Whoever my enemies\r\nare, they have lost me, and between this and the time when I leave\r\nEngland they shall not find me again. I have been to the post-office,\r\nand have got the ticket for my luggage, inclosed to me in a letter from\r\nAll Saints\xe2\x80\x99 Terrace, as I directed. The luggage itself I shall still\r\nleave at the cloak-room, until I see the way before me more clearly than\r\nI see it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 5th.--Two letters again from the hotel. Midwinter writes to\r\nremind me, in the prettiest possible manner, that he will have\r\nlived long enough in the parish by to-morrow to be able to get our\r\nmarriage-license, and that he proposes applying for it in the usual way\r\nat Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons. Now, if I am ever to say it, is the time to say No.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t say No. There is the plain truth--and there is an end of it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s letter is a letter of farewell. He thanks me for my kindness\r\nin consenting to write to the major, and bids me good-by, till we meet\r\nagain at Naples. He has learned from his friend that there are private\r\nreasons which will oblige him to forbid himself the pleasure of being\r\npresent at our marriage. Under these circumstances, there is nothing to\r\nkeep him in London. He has made all his business arrangements; he goes\r\nto Somersetshire by to-night\xe2\x80\x99s train; and, after staying some time with\r\nMr. Brock, he will sail for the Mediterranean from the Bristol Channel\r\n(in spite of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s objections) in his own yacht.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter incloses a jeweler\xe2\x80\x99s box, with a ring in it--Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresent to me on my marriage. It is a ruby--but rather a small one, and\r\nset in the worst possible taste. He would have given Miss Milroy a ring\r\nworth ten times the money, if it had been _her_ marriage present. There\r\nis no more hateful creature, in my opinion, than a miserly young man. I\r\nwonder whether his trumpery little yacht will drown him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so excited and fluttered, I hardly know what I am writing. Not\r\nthat I shrink from what is coming--I only feel as if I was being hurried\r\non faster than I quite like to go. At this rate, if nothing happens,\r\nMidwinter will have married me by the end of the week. And then--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 6th.--If anything could startle me now, I should feel startled\r\nby the news that has reached me to-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn his return to the hotel this morning, after getting the\r\nmarriage-license, Midwinter found a telegram waiting for him. It\r\ncontained an urgent message from Armadale, announcing that Mr. Brock had\r\nhad a relapse, and that all hope of his recovery was pronounced by the\r\ndoctors to be at an end. By the dying man\xe2\x80\x99s own desire, Midwinter was\r\nsummoned to take leave of him, and was entreated by Armadale not to lose\r\na moment in starting for the rectory by the first train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hurried letter which tells me this tells me also that, by the time\r\nI receive it, Midwinter will be on his way to the West. He promises\r\nto write at greater length, after he has seen Mr. Brock, by to-night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis news has an interest for me, which Midwinter little suspects.\r\nThere is but one human creature, besides myself, who knows the secret of\r\nhis birth and his name; and that one is the old man who now lies waiting\r\nfor him at the point of death. What will they say to each other at the\r\nlast moment? Will some chance word take them back to the time when I was\r\nin Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s service at Madeira? Will they speak of Me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 7th.--The promised letter has just reached me. No parting words\r\nhave been exchanged between them: it was all over before Midwinter\r\nreached Somersetshire. Armadale met him at the rectory gate with the\r\nnews that Mr. Brock was dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI try to struggle against it, but, coming after the strange\r\ncomplication of circumstances that has been closing round me for weeks\r\npast, there is something in this latest event of all that shakes my\r\nnerves. But one last chance of detection stood in my way when I opened\r\nmy diary yesterday. When I open it to-day, that chance is removed by Mr.\r\nBrock\xe2\x80\x99s death. It means something; I wish I knew what.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe funeral is to be on Saturday morning. Midwinter will attend it\r\nas well as Armadale. But he proposes returning to London first; and he\r\nwrites word that he will call to-night, in the hope of seeing me, on his\r\nway from the station to the hotel. Even if there was any risk in it, I\r\nshould see him, as things are now. But there is no risk if he comes here\r\nfrom the station instead of coming from the hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--I was not mistaken in believing that my nerves were all\r\nunstrung. Trifles that would not have cost me a second thought at other\r\ntimes weigh heavily on my mind now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo hours since, in despair of knowing how to get through the day, I\r\nbethought myself of the milliner who is making my summer dress. I had\r\nintended to go and try it on yesterday; but it slipped out of my memory\r\nin the excitement of hearing about Mr. Brock. So I went this afternoon,\r\neager to do anything that might help me to get rid of myself. I have\r\nreturned, feeling more uneasy and more depressed than I felt when I went\r\nout; for I have come back fearing that I may yet have reason to repent\r\nnot having left my unfinished dress on the milliner\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing happened to me, this time, in the street. It was only in the\r\ntrying-on room that my suspicions were roused; and there it certainly\r\ndid cross my mind that the attempt to discover me, which I defeated\r\nat All Saints\xe2\x80\x99 Terrace, was not given up yet, and that some of the\r\nshop-women had been tampered with, if not the mistress herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I give myself anything in the shape of a reason for this\r\nimpression? Let me think a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly noticed two things which were out of the ordinary routine,\r\nunder the circumstances. In the first place, there were twice as many\r\nwomen as were needed in the trying-on room. This looked suspicious; and\r\nyet I might have accounted for it in more ways than one. Is it not the\r\nslack time now? and don\xe2\x80\x99t I know by experience that I am the sort of\r\nwoman about whom other women are always spitefully curious? I thought\r\nagain, in the second place, that one of the assistants persisted rather\r\noddly in keeping me turned in a particular direction, with my face\r\ntoward the glazed and curtained door that led into the work-room. But,\r\nafter all, she gave a reason when I asked for it. She said the light\r\nfell better on me that way; and, when I looked round, there was the\r\nwindow to prove her right. Still, these trifles produced such an effect\r\non me, at the time, that I purposely found fault with the dress, so as\r\nto have an excuse for trying it on again, before I told them where\r\nI lived, and had it sent home. Pure fancy, I dare say. Pure fancy,\r\nperhaps, at the present moment. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care; I shall act on instinct\r\n(as they say), and give up the dress. In plainer words still, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMidnight.--Midwinter came to see me as he promised. An hour has passed\r\nsince we said good-night; and here I still sit, with my pen in my hand,\r\nthinking of him. No words of mine can describe what has passed between\r\nus. The end of it is all I can write in these pages; and the end of it\r\nis that he has shaken my resolution. For the first time since I saw the\r\neasy way to Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s life at Thorpe Ambrose, I feel as if the man whom\r\nI have doomed in my own thoughts had a chance of escaping me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it my love for Midwinter that has altered me? Or is it _his_ love\r\nfor _me_ that has taken possession not only of all I wish to give him,\r\nbut of all I wish to keep from him as well? I feel as if I had lost\r\nmyself--lost myself, I mean, in _him_--all through the evening. He was\r\nin great agitation about what had happened in Somersetshire; and he made\r\nme feel as disheartened and as wretched about it as he did. Though he\r\nnever confessed it in words, I know that Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s death has startled\r\nhim as an ill omen for our marriage--I know it, because I feel\r\nMr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s death as an ill omen too. The superstition--_his_\r\nsuperstition--took so strong a hold on me, that when we grew calmer and\r\nhe spoke of time future--when he told me that he must either break his\r\nengagement with his new employers or go abroad, as he is pledged to\r\ngo, on Monday next--I actually shrank at the thought of our marriage\r\nfollowing close on Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s funeral; I actually said to him, in the\r\nimpulse of the moment, \xe2\x80\x98Go, and begin your new life alone! go, and leave\r\nme here to wait for happier times.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe took me in his arms. He sighed, and kissed me with an angelic\r\ntenderness. He said--oh, so softly and so sadly!--I have no life now,\r\napart from _you_.\xe2\x80\x99 As those words passed his lips, the thought seemed\r\nto rise in my mind like an echo, \xe2\x80\x98Why not live out all the days that\r\nare left to me, happy and harmless in a love like this!\xe2\x80\x99 I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain\r\nit--I can\xe2\x80\x99t realize it. That was the thought in me at the time; and\r\nthat is the thought in me still. I see my own hand while I write the\r\nwords--and I ask myself whether it is really the hand of Lydia Gwilt!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! I will never write, I will never think of Armadale again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! Let me write once more--let me think once more of him, because\r\nit quiets me to know that he is going away, and that the sea will have\r\nparted us before I am married. His old home is home to him no longer,\r\nnow that the loss of his mother has been followed by the loss of his\r\nbest and earliest friend. When the funeral is over, he has decided to\r\nsail the same day for the foreign seas. We may, or we may not, meet at\r\nNaples. Shall I be an altered woman if we do? I wonder; I wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 8th.--A line from Midwinter. He has gone back to Somersetshire\r\nto be in readiness for the funeral to-morrow; and he will return here\r\n(after bidding Armadale good-by) to-morrow evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last forms and ceremonies preliminary to our marriage have been\r\ncomplied with. I am to be his wife on Monday next. The hour must not be\r\nlater than half-past ten--which will give us just time, when the service\r\nis over, to get from the church door to the railway, and to start on our\r\njourney to Naples the same day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day--Saturday--Sunday! I am not afraid of the time; the time will\r\npass. I am not afraid of myself, if I can only keep all thoughts but\r\none out of my mind. I love him! Day and night, till Monday comes, I will\r\nthink of nothing but that. I love him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--Other thoughts are forced into my mind in spite of me.\r\nMy suspicions of yesterday were no mere fancies; the milliner has been\r\ntampered with. My folly in going back to her house has led to my being\r\ntraced here. I am absolutely certain that I never gave the woman my\r\naddress; and yet my new gown was sent home to me at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-day!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man brought it with the bill, and a civil message, to say that, as I\r\nhad not called at the appointed time to try it on again, the dress had\r\nbeen finished and sent to me. He caught me in the passage; I had no\r\nchoice but to pay the bill, and dismiss him. Any other proceeding, as\r\nevents have now turned out, would have been pure folly. The messenger\r\n(not the man who followed me in the street, but another spy sent to look\r\nat me, beyond all doubt) would have declared he knew nothing about it,\r\nif I had spoken to him. The milliner would tell me to my face, if I went\r\nto her, that I had given her my address. The one useful thing to do now\r\nis to set my wits to work in the interests of my own security, and\r\nto step out of the false position in which my own rashness has placed\r\nme--if I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--My spirits have risen again. I believe I am in a fair\r\nway of extricating myself already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just come back from a long round in a cab. First, to the\r\ncloak-room of the Great Western, to get the luggage which I sent there\r\nfrom All Saints\xe2\x80\x99 Terrace. Next, to the cloak-room of the Southeastern,\r\nto leave my luggage (labeled in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s name), to wait for me\r\ntill the starting of the tidal train on Monday. Next, to the General\r\nPost-office, to post a letter to Midwinter at the rectory, which he will\r\nreceive to-morrow morning. Lastly, back again to this house--from which\r\nI shall move no more till Monday comes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy letter to Midwinter will, I have little doubt, lead to his seconding\r\n(quite innocently) the precautions that I am taking for my own safety.\r\nThe shortness of the time at our disposal on Monday will oblige him to\r\npay his bill at the hotel and to remove his luggage before the marriage\r\nceremony takes place. All I ask him to do beyond this is to take the\r\nluggage himself to the Southeastern (so as to make any inquiries useless\r\nwhich may address themselves to the servants at the hotel)--and, that\r\ndone, to meet me at the church door, instead of calling for me here.\r\nThe rest concerns nobody but myself. When Sunday night or Monday\r\nmorning comes, it will be hard, indeed--freed as I am now from all\r\nincumbrances--if I can\xe2\x80\x99t give the people who are watching me the slip\r\nfor the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems needless enough to have written to Midwinter to-day, when he\r\nis coming back to me to-morrow night. But it was impossible to ask,\r\nwhat I have been obliged to ask of him, without making my false family\r\ncircumstances once more the excuse; and having this to do--I must own\r\nthe truth--I wrote to him because, after what I suffered on the last\r\noccasion, I can never again deceive him to his face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 9th.--Two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--I rose early this morning, more depressed in\r\nspirits than usual. The re-beginning of one\xe2\x80\x99s life, at the re-beginning\r\nof every day, has already been something weary and hopeless to me for\r\nyears past. I dreamed, too, all through the night--not of Midwinter\r\nand of my married life, as I had hoped to dream--but of the wretched\r\nconspiracy to discover me, by which I have been driven from one place to\r\nanother, like a hunted animal. Nothing in the shape of a new revelation\r\nenlightened me in my sleep. All I could guess dreaming was what I had\r\nguessed waking, that Mother Oldershaw is the enemy who is attacking me\r\nin the dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy restless night has, however, produced one satisfactory result. It\r\nhas led to my winning the good graces of the servant here, and securing\r\nall the assistance she can give me when the time comes for making my\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girl noticed this morning that I looked pale and anxious. I\r\ntook her into my confidence, to the extent of telling her that I was\r\nprivately engaged to be married, and that I had enemies who were trying\r\nto part me from my sweetheart. This instantly roused her sympathy, and\r\na present of a ten-shilling piece for her kind services to me did the\r\nrest. In the intervals of her housework she has been with me nearly\r\nthe whole morning; and I found out, among other things, that _her_\r\nsweetheart is a private soldier in the Guards, and that she expects to\r\nsee him to-morrow. I have got money enough left, little as it is, to\r\nturn the head of any Private in the British army; and, if the person\r\nappointed to watch me to-morrow is a man, I think it just possible that\r\nhe may find his attention disagreeably diverted from Miss Gwilt in the\r\ncourse of the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Midwinter came here last from the railway, he came at half-past\r\neight. How am I to get through the weary, weary hours between this and\r\nthe evening? I think I shall darken my bedroom, and drink the blessing\r\nof oblivion from my bottle of Drops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--We have parted for the last time before the day comes\r\nthat makes us man and wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has left me, as he left me before, with an absorbing subject of\r\ninterest to think of in his absence. I noticed a change in him the\r\nmoment he entered the room. When he told me of the funeral, and of his\r\nparting with Armadale on board the yacht, though he spoke with feelings\r\ndeeply moved, he spoke with a mastery over himself which is new to me in\r\nmy experience of him. It was the same when our talk turned next on our\r\nown hopes and prospects. He was plainly disappointed when he found\r\nthat my family embarrassments would prevent our meeting to-morrow, and\r\nplainly uneasy at the prospect of leaving me to find my way by myself on\r\nMonday to the church. But there was a certain hopefulness and composure\r\nof manner underlying it all, which produced so strong an impression on\r\nme that I was obliged to notice it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You know what odd fancies take possession of me sometimes,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I tell you the fancy that has taken possession of me now? I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp thinking that something has happened since we last saw each other\r\nwhich you have not told me yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Something _has_ happened,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered. \xe2\x80\x98And it is something which you\r\nought to know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith those words he took out his pocket-book, and produced two written\r\npapers from it. One he looked at and put back. The other he placed on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Before I tell you what this is, and how it came into my possession,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x98I must own something that I have concealed from you. It is no\r\nmore serious confession than the confession of my own weakness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe then acknowledged to me that the renewal of his friendship with\r\nArmadale had been clouded, through the whole period of their intercourse\r\nin London, by his own superstitious misgivings. He had obeyed the\r\nsummons which called him to the rector\xe2\x80\x99s bedside, with the firm\r\nintention of confiding his previsions of coming trouble to Mr. Brock;\r\nand he had been doubly confirmed in his superstition when he found that\r\nDeath had entered the house before him, and had parted them, in this\r\nworld, forever. More than this, he had traveled back to be present at\r\nthe funeral, with a secret sense of relief at the prospect of being\r\nparted from Armadale, and with a secret resolution to make the\r\nafter-meeting agreed on between us three at Naples a meeting that should\r\nnever take place. With that purpose in his heart, he had gone up alone\r\nto the room prepared for him on his arrival at the rectory, and had\r\nopened a letter which he found waiting for him on the table. The letter\r\nhad only that day been discovered--dropped and lost--under the bed on\r\nwhich Mr. Brock had died. It was in the rector\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting throughout;\r\nand the person to whom it was addressed was Midwinter himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving told me this, nearly in the words in which I have written it, he\r\ngave me the written paper that lay on the table between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Read it,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98and you will not need to be told that my mind\r\nis at peace again, and that I took Allan\xe2\x80\x99s hand at parting with a heart\r\nthat was worthier of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read the letter. There was no superstition to be conquered in _my_\r\nmind; there were no old feelings of gratitude toward Armadale to be\r\nroused in _my_ heart; and yet, the effect which the letter had had on\r\nMidwinter was, I firmly believe, more than matched by the effect that\r\nthe letter now produced on me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was vain to ask him to leave it, and to let me read it again (as I\r\nwished) when I was left by myself. He is determined to keep it side\r\nby side with that other paper which I had seen him take out of his\r\npocket-book, and which contains the written narrative of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDream. All I could do was to ask his leave to copy it; and this he\r\ngranted readily. I wrote the copy in his presence; and I now place it\r\nhere in my diary, to mark a day which is one of the memorable days in my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoscombe Rectory, August 2d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MIDWINTER--For the first time since the beginning of my\r\nillness, I found strength enough yesterday to look over my letters. One\r\namong them is a letter from Allan, which has been lying unopened on my\r\ntable for ten days past. He writes to me in great distress, to say that\r\nthere has been dissension between you, and that you have left him. If\r\nyou still remember what passed between us, when you first opened your\r\nheart to me in the Isle of Man, you will be at no loss to understand how\r\nI have thought over this miserable news, through the night that has now\r\npassed, and you will not be surprised to hear that I have roused myself\r\nthis morning to make the effort of writing to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want no explanation of the circumstances which have parted you from\r\nyour friend. If my estimate of your character is not founded on\r\nan entire delusion, the one influence which can have led to your\r\nestrangement from Allan is the influence of that evil spirit of\r\nSuperstition which I have once already cast out of your heart--which I\r\nwill once again conquer, please God, if I have strength enough to make\r\nmy pen speak my mind to you in this letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no part of my design to combat the belief which I know you\r\nto hold, that mortal creatures may be the objects of supernatural\r\nintervention in their pilgrimage through this world. Speaking as a\r\nreasonable man, I own that I cannot prove you to be wrong. Speaking as\r\na believer in the Bible, I am bound to go further, and to admit that you\r\npossess a higher than any human warrant for the faith that is in you.\r\nThe one object which I have it at heart to attain is to induce you\r\nto free yourself from the paralyzing fatalism of the heathen and the\r\nsavage, and to look at the mysteries that perplex, and the portents that\r\ndaunt you, from the Christian\xe2\x80\x99s point of view. If I can succeed in this,\r\nI shall clear your mind of the ghastly doubts that now oppress it, and I\r\nshall reunite you to your friend, never to be parted from him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no means of seeing and questioning you. I can only send this\r\nletter to Allan to be forwarded, if he knows, or can discover, your\r\npresent address. Placed in this position toward you, I am bound to\r\nassume all that _can_ be assumed in your favor. I will take it for\r\ngranted that something has happened to you or to Allan which to your\r\nmind has not only confirmed the fatalist conviction in which your father\r\ndied, but has added a new and terrible meaning to the warning which he\r\nsent you in his death-bed letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn this common ground I meet you. On this common ground I appeal to\r\nyour higher nature and your better sense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPreserve your present conviction that the events which have happened\r\n(be they what they may) are not to be reconciled with ordinary mortal\r\ncoincidences and ordinary mortal laws; and view your own position by the\r\nbest and clearest light that your superstition can throw on it. What are\r\nyou? You are a helpless instrument in the hands of Fate. You are doomed,\r\nbeyond all human capacity of resistance, to bring misery and destruction\r\nblindfold on a man to whom you have harmlessly and gratefully united\r\nyourself in the bonds of a brother\xe2\x80\x99s love. All that is morally firmest\r\nin your will and morally purest in your aspirations avails nothing\r\nagainst the hereditary impulsion of you toward evil, caused by a crime\r\nwhich your father committed before you were born. In what does that\r\nbelief end? It ends in the darkness in which you are now lost; in the\r\nself-contradictions in which you are now bewildered; in the stubborn\r\ndespair by which a man profanes his own soul, and lowers himself to the\r\nlevel of the brutes that perish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook up, my poor suffering brother--look up, my hardly tried, my\r\nwell-loved friend, higher than this! Meet the doubts that now assail you\r\nfrom the blessed vantage-ground of Christian courage and Christian hope;\r\nand your heart will turn again to Allan, and your mind will be at\r\npeace. Happen what may, God is all-merciful, God is all-wise: natural or\r\nsupernatural, it happens through Him. The mystery of Evil that perplexes\r\nour feeble minds, the sorrow and the suffering that torture us in this\r\nlittle life, leave the one great truth unshaken that the destiny of man\r\nis in the hands of his Creator, and that God\xe2\x80\x99s blessed Son died to make\r\nus worthier of it. Nothing that is done in unquestioning submission to\r\nthe wisdom of the Almighty is done wrong. No evil exists out of which,\r\nin obedience to his laws, Good may not come. Be true to what Christ\r\ntells you is true. Encourage in yourself, be the circumstances what they\r\nmay, all that is loving, all that is grateful, all that is patient, all\r\nthat is forgiving, toward your fellow-men. And humbly and trustfully\r\nleave the rest to the God who made you, and to the Saviour who loved you\r\nbetter than his own life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the faith in which I have lived, by the Divine help and mercy,\r\nfrom my youth upward. I ask you earnestly, I ask you confidently, to\r\nmake it your faith, too. It is the mainspring of all the good I have\r\never done, of all the happiness I have ever known; it lightens my\r\ndarkness, it sustains my hope; it comforts and quiets me, lying here,\r\nto live or die, I know not which. Let it sustain, comfort, and enlighten\r\nyou. It will help you in your sorest need, as it has helped me in mine.\r\nIt will show you another purpose in the events which brought you and\r\nAllan together than the purpose which your guilty father foresaw.\r\nStrange things, I do not deny it, have happened to you already. Stranger\r\nthings still may happen before long, which I may not live to see.\r\nRemember, if that time comes, that I died firmly disbelieving in your\r\ninfluence over Allan being other than an influence for good. The\r\ngreat sacrifice of the Atonement--I say it reverently--has its mortal\r\nreflections, even in this world. If danger ever threatens Allan, you,\r\nwhose father took his father\xe2\x80\x99s life--YOU, and no other, may be the man\r\nwhom the providence of God has appointed to save him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to me if I live. Go back to the friend who loves you, whether I\r\nlive or die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours affectionately to the last,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDECIMUS BROCK.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You, and no other, may be the man whom the providence of God has\r\nappointed to save him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are the words which have shaken me to the soul. Those are the\r\nwords which make me feel as if the dead man had left his grave, and\r\nhad put his hand on the place in my heart where my terrible secret lies\r\nhidden from every living creature but myself. One part of the letter\r\nhas come true already. The danger that it foresees threatens Armadale at\r\nthis moment--and threatens him from Me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the favoring circumstances which have driven me thus far drive me on\r\nto the end, and if that old man\xe2\x80\x99s last earthly conviction is prophetic\r\nof the truth, Armadale will escape me, do what I may. And Midwinter will\r\nbe the victim who is sacrificed to save his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is horrible! it is impossible! it shall never be! At the thinking of\r\nit only, my hand trembles and my heart sinks. I bless the trembling\r\nthat unnerves me! I bless the sinking that turns me faint! I bless those\r\nwords in the letter which have revived the relenting thoughts that first\r\ncame to me two days since! Is it hard, now that events are taking me,\r\nsmoothly and safely, nearer and nearer to the End--is it hard to conquer\r\nthe temptation to go on? No! If there is only a chance of harm coming\r\nto Midwinter, the dread of that chance is enough to decide me--enough\r\nto strengthen me to conquer the temptation, for his sake. I have never\r\nloved him yet, never, never, never as I love him now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSunday, August 10th.--The eve of my wedding-day! I close and lock this\r\nbook, never to write in it, never to open it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have won the great victory; I have trampled my own wickedness under\r\nfoot. I am innocent; I am happy again. My love! my angel! when to-morrow\r\ngives me to you, I will not have a thought in my heart which is not\r\n_your_ thought, as well as mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. THE WEDDING-DAY.\r\n\r\nThe time was nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. The place was a private room\r\nin one of the old-fashioned inns which still remain on the Borough side\r\nof the Thames. The date was Monday, the 11th of August. And the person\r\nwas Mr. Bashwood, who had traveled to London on a summons from his son,\r\nand had taken up his abode at the inn on the previous day.\r\n\r\nHe had never yet looked so pitiably old and helpless as he looked now.\r\nThe fever and chill of alternating hope and despair had dried, and\r\nwithered, and wasted him. The angles of his figure had sharpened. The\r\noutline of his face had shrunk. His dress pointed the melancholy change\r\nin him with a merciless and shocking emphasis. Never, even in his youth,\r\nhad he worn such clothes as he wore now. With the desperate resolution\r\nto leave no chance untried of producing an impression on Miss Gwilt,\r\nhe had cast aside his dreary black garments; he had even mustered the\r\ncourage to wear his blue satin cravat. His coat was a riding-coat of\r\nlight gray. He had ordered it, with a vindictive subtlety of purpose,\r\nto be made on the pattern of a coat that he had seen Allan wear. His\r\nwaistcoat was white; his trousers were of the gayest summer pattern, in\r\nthe largest check. His wig was oiled and scented, and brushed round, on\r\neither side, to hide the wrinkles on his temples. He was an object to\r\nlaugh at; he was an object to weep over. His enemies, if a creature so\r\nwretched could have had enemies, would have forgiven him, on seeing him\r\nin his new dress. His friends--had any of his friends been left--would\r\nhave been less distressed if they had looked at him in his coffin than\r\nif they had looked at him as he was now. Incessantly restless, he paced\r\nthe room from end to end. Now he looked at his watch; now he\r\nlooked out of the window; now he looked at the well-furnished\r\nbreakfast-table--always with the same wistful, uneasy inquiry in his\r\neyes. The waiter coming in, with the urn of boiling water, was addressed\r\nfor the fiftieth time in the one form of words which the miserable\r\ncreature seemed to be capable of uttering that morning: \xe2\x80\x9cMy son is\r\ncoming to breakfast. My son is very particular. I want everything of the\r\nbest--hot things and cold things--and tea and coffee--and all the\r\nrest of it, waiter; all the rest of it.\xe2\x80\x9d For the fiftieth time, he now\r\nreiterated those anxious words. For the fiftieth time, the impenetrable\r\nwaiter had just returned his one pacifying answer, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, sir; you\r\nmay leave it to me\xe2\x80\x9d--when the sound of leisurely footsteps was heard\r\non the stairs; the door opened; and the long-expected son sauntered\r\nindolently into the room, with a neat little black leather bag in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, old gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bashwood the younger, surveying his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s dress with a smile of sardonic encouragement. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re ready to\r\nbe married to Miss Gwilt at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father took the son\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and tried to echo the son\xe2\x80\x99s laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have such good spirits, Jemmy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, using the name in its\r\nfamiliar form, as he had been accustomed to use it in happier days. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nalways had good spirits, my dear, from a child. Come and sit down; I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nordered you a nice breakfast. Everything of the best! everything of the\r\nbest! What a relief it is to see you! Oh, dear, dear, what a relief it\r\nis to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped and sat down at the table, his face flushed\r\nwith the effort to control the impatience that was devouring him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about her!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out, giving up the effort with a sudden\r\nself-abandonment. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall die, Jemmy, if I wait for it any longer. Tell\r\nme! tell me! tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing at a time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bashwood the younger, perfectly unmoved by\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll try the breakfast first, and come to the\r\nlady afterward! Gently does it, old gentleman--gently does it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his leather bag on a chair, and sat down opposite to his father,\r\ncomposed, and smiling, and humming a little tune.\r\n\r\nNo ordinary observation, applying the ordinary rules of analysis, would\r\nhave detected the character of Bashwood the younger in his face. His\r\nyouthful look, aided by his light hair and his plump beardless\r\ncheeks, his easy manner and his ever-ready smile, his eyes which met\r\nunshrinkingly the eyes of every one whom he addressed, all combined to\r\nmake the impression of him a favorable impression in the general mind.\r\nNo eye for reading character, but such an eye as belongs to one person,\r\nperhaps, in ten thousand, could have penetrated the smoothly deceptive\r\nsurface of this man, and have seen him for what he really was--the vile\r\ncreature whom the viler need of Society has fashioned for its own use.\r\nThere he sat--the Confidential Spy of modern times, whose business is\r\nsteadily enlarging, whose Private Inquiry Offices are steadily on\r\nthe increase. There he sat--the necessary Detective attendant on the\r\nprogress of our national civilization; a man who was, in this instance\r\nat least, the legitimate and intelligible product of the vocation that\r\nemployed him; a man professionally ready on the merest suspicion (if the\r\nmerest suspicion paid him) to get under our beds, and to look through\r\ngimlet-holes in our doors; a man who would have been useless to his\r\nemployers if he could have felt a touch of human sympathy in his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s presence; and who would have deservedly forfeited his situation\r\nif, under any circumstances whatever, he had been personally accessible\r\nto a sense of pity or a sense of shame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently does it, old gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, lifting the covers from\r\nthe dishes, and looking under them one after the other all round the\r\ntable. \xe2\x80\x9cGently does it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me, Jemmy,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded his father. \xe2\x80\x9cTry, if you\r\ncan, to think how anxious I must be. I got your letter so long ago\r\nas yesterday morning. I have had to travel all the way from Thorpe\r\nAmbrose--I have had to get through the dreadful long evening and the\r\ndreadful long night--with your letter telling me that you had found out\r\nwho she is, and telling me nothing more. Suspense is very hard to bear,\r\nJemmy, when you come to my age. What was it prevented you, my dear, from\r\ncoming to me when I got here yesterday evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little dinner at Richmond,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bashwood the younger. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me some\r\ntea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood tried to comply with the request; but the hand with which\r\nhe lifted the teapot trembled so unmanageably that the tea missed\r\nthe cup and streamed out on the cloth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry; I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\ntrembling when I\xe2\x80\x99m anxious,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, as his son took the\r\ntea-pot out of his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you bear me malice, Jemmy, for what\r\nhappened when I was last in town. I own I was obstinate and unreasonable\r\nabout going back to Thorpe Ambrose. I\xe2\x80\x99m more sensible now. You were\r\nquite right in taking it all on yourself, as soon as I showed you the\r\nveiled lady when we saw her come out of the hotel; and you were quite\r\nright to send me back the same day to my business in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice at the Great House.\xe2\x80\x9d He watched the effect of these concessions\r\non his son, and ventured doubtfully on another entreaty. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell me anything else just yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, faintly, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you tell me how\r\nyou found her out. Do, Jemmy, do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBashwood the younger looked up from his plate. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reckoning up of Miss Gwilt has cost more money and taken more\r\ntime than I expected; and the sooner we come to a settlement about it,\r\nthe sooner we shall get to what you want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a word of expostulation, the father laid his dingy old\r\npocket-book and his purse on the table before the son. Bashwood the\r\nyounger looked into the purse; observed, with a contemptuous elevation\r\nof the eyebrows, that it held no more than a sovereign and some silver;\r\nand returned it intact. The pocket-book, on being opened next, proved to\r\ncontain four five-pound notes. Bashwood the younger transferred three\r\nof the notes to his own keeping; and handed the pocket-book back to his\r\nfather, with a bow expressive of mock gratitude and sarcastic respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of it is for the people at our\r\noffice, and the balance is for myself. One of the few stupid things,\r\nmy dear sir, that I have done in the course of my life was to write\r\nyou word, when you first consulted me, that you might have my services\r\ngratis. As you see, I hasten to repair the error. An hour or two at odd\r\ntimes I was ready enough to give you. But this business has taken days,\r\nand has got in the way of other jobs. I told you I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be out of\r\npocket by you--I put it in my letter, as plain as words could say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, Jemmy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain, my dear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain. Never\r\nmind the money--tell me how you found her out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Bashwood, the younger, proceeding impenetrably\r\nwith his justification of himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI have given you the benefit of my\r\nexperience; I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it cheap. It would have cost double the money if\r\nanother man had taken this in hand. Another man would have kept a watch\r\non Mr. Armadale as well as Miss Gwilt. I have saved you that expense.\r\nYou are certain that Mr. Armadale is bent on marrying her. Very good.\r\nIn that case, while we have our eye on _her_, we have, for all useful\r\npurposes, got our eye on _him_. Know where the lady is, and you know\r\nthat the gentleman can\xe2\x80\x99t be far off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite true, Jemmy. But how was it Miss Gwilt came to give you so much\r\ntrouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a devilish clever woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bashwood the younger; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s how\r\nit was. She gave us the slip at a milliner\xe2\x80\x99s shop. We made it all right\r\nwith the milliner, and speculated on the chance of her coming back to\r\ntry on a gown she had ordered. The cleverest women lose the use of their\r\nwits in nine cases out of ten where there\xe2\x80\x99s a new dress in the case, and\r\neven Miss Gwilt was rash enough to go back. That was all we wanted. One\r\nof the women from our office helped to try on her new gown, and put her\r\nin the right position to be seen by one of our men behind the door. He\r\ninstantly suspected who she was, on the strength of what he had been\r\ntold of her; for she\xe2\x80\x99s a famous woman in her way. Of course, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrust to that. We traced her to her new address; and we got a man from\r\nScotland Yard, who was certain to know her, if our own man\xe2\x80\x99s idea was\r\nthe right one. The man from Scotland Yard turned milliner\xe2\x80\x99s lad for\r\nthe occasion, and took her gown home. He saw her in the passage, and\r\nidentified her in an instant. You\xe2\x80\x99re in luck, I can tell you. Miss\r\nGwilt\xe2\x80\x99s a public character. If we had had a less notorious woman to deal\r\nwith, she might have cost us weeks of inquiry, and you might have had to\r\npay hundreds of pounds. A day did it in Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s case; and another\r\nday put the whole story of her life, in black and white, into my hand.\r\nThere it is at the present moment, old gentleman, in my black bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBashwood the father made straight for the bag with eager eyes and\r\noutstretched hand. Bashwood the son took a little key out of his\r\nwaistcoat pocket, winked, shook his head, and put the key back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t done breakfast yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGently does it, my dear\r\nsir--gently does it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t wait!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man, struggling vainly to preserve his\r\nself-control. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s past nine! It\xe2\x80\x99s a fortnight to-day since she went to\r\nLondon with Mr. Armadale! She may be married to him in a fortnight! She\r\nmay be married to him this morning! I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait! I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing what you can do till you try,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Bashwood\r\nthe younger. \xe2\x80\x9cTry, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find you can wait. What has become of your\r\ncuriosity?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, feeding the fire ingeniously with a stick at a\r\ntime. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you ask me what I mean by calling Miss Gwilt a public\r\ncharacter? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you wonder how I came to lay my hand on the story\r\nof her life, in black and white? If you\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou. If you won\xe2\x80\x99t, I shall confine myself to my breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood sighed heavily, and went back to his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you were not so fond of your joke, Jemmy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish, my\r\ndear, you were not quite so fond of your joke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoke?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated his son. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be serious enough in some people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes, I can tell you. Miss Gwilt has been tried for her life; and the\r\npapers in that black bag are the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions for the Defense.\r\nDo you call that a joke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father started to his feet, and looked straight across the table at\r\nthe son with a smile of exultation that was terrible to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been tried for her life!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out, with a deep gasp of\r\nsatisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been tried for her life!\xe2\x80\x9d He broke into a low,\r\nprolonged laugh, and snapped his fingers exultingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAha-ha-ha!\r\nSomething to frighten Mr. Armadale in _that_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScoundrel as he was, the son was daunted by the explosion of pent-up\r\npassion which burst on him in those words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t excite yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a sullen suppression of the\r\nmocking manner in which he had spoken thus far.\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood sat down again, and passed his handkerchief over his\r\nforehead. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, nodding and smiling at his son. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no--no\r\nexcitement, as you say--I can wait now, Jemmy; I can wait now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited with immovable patience. At intervals, he nodded, and smiled,\r\nand whispered to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cSomething to frighten Mr. Armadale in\r\n_that_!\xe2\x80\x9d But he made no further attempt, by word, look, or action, to\r\nhurry his son.\r\n\r\nBashwood the younger finished his breakfast slowly, out of pure bravado;\r\nlit a cigar with the utmost deliberation; looked at his father, and,\r\nseeing him still as immovably patient as ever, opened the black bag at\r\nlast, and spread the papers on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you have it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cLong or short? I have got her whole\r\nlife here. The counsel who defended her at the trial was instructed to\r\nhammer hard at the sympathies of the jury: he went head over ears into\r\nthe miseries of her past career, and shocked everybody in court in the\r\nmost workman-like manner. Shall I take the same line? Do you want to\r\nknow all about her, from the time when she was in short frocks and\r\nfrilled trousers? or do you prefer getting on at once to her first\r\nappearance as a prisoner in the dock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know all about her,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nworst, and the best--the worst particularly. Don\xe2\x80\x99t spare my feelings,\r\nJemmy--whatever you do, don\xe2\x80\x99t spare my feelings! Can\xe2\x80\x99t I look at the\r\npapers myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you can\xe2\x80\x99t. They would be all Greek and Hebrew to you. Thank your\r\nstars that you have got a sharp son, who can take the pith out of these\r\npapers, and give it a smack of the right flavor in serving it up. There\r\nare not ten men in England who could tell you this woman\xe2\x80\x99s story as I\r\ncan tell it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a gift, old gentleman, of the sort that is given to\r\nvery few people--and it lodges here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tapped his forehead smartly, and turned to the first page of the\r\nmanuscript before him, with an unconcealed triumph at the prospect\r\nof exhibiting his own cleverness, which was the first expression of a\r\ngenuine feeling of any sort that had escaped him yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s story begins,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bashwood the younger, \xe2\x80\x9cin the\r\nmarket-place at Thorpe Ambrose. One day, something like a quarter of a\r\ncentury ago, a traveling quack doctor, who dealt in perfumery as well\r\nas medicines, came to the town with his cart, and exhibited, as a living\r\nexample of the excellence of his washes and hair-oils and so on, a\r\npretty little girl, with a beautiful complexion and wonderful hair. His\r\nname was Oldershaw. He had a wife, who helped him in the perfumery part\r\nof his business, and who carried it on by herself after his death. She\r\nhas risen in the world of late years; and she is identical with that sly\r\nold lady who employed me professionally a short time since. As for the\r\npretty little girl, you know who she was as well as I do. While the\r\nquack was haranguing the mob and showing them the child\xe2\x80\x99s hair, a young\r\nlady, driving through the marketplace, stopped her carriage to hear what\r\nit was all about, saw the little girl, and took a violent fancy to her\r\non the spot. The young lady was the daughter of Mr. Blanchard, of Thorpe\r\nAmbrose. She went home, and interested her father in the fate of the\r\ninnocent little victim of the quack doctor. The same evening, the\r\nOldershaws were sent for to the great house and were questioned. They\r\ndeclared themselves to be her uncle and aunt--a lie, of course!--and\r\nthey were quite willing to let her attend the village school, while they\r\nstayed at Thorpe Ambrose, when the proposal was made to them. The new\r\narrangement was carried out the next day. And the day after that, the\r\nOldershaws had disappeared, and had left the little girl on the squire\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands! She evidently hadn\xe2\x80\x99t answered as they expected in the capacity\r\nof an advertisement, and that was the way they took of providing for her\r\nfor life. There is the first act of the play for you! Clear enough, so\r\nfar, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear enough, Jemmy, to clever people. But I\xe2\x80\x99m old and slow. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand one thing. Whose child was she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very sensible question. Sorry to inform you that nobody can answer\r\nit--Miss Gwilt herself included. These Instructions that I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to\r\nare founded, of course, on her own statements, sifted by her attorney.\r\nAll she could remember, on being questioned, was that she was beaten and\r\nhalf starved, somewhere in the country, by a woman who took in children\r\nat nurse. The woman had a card with her, stating that her name was Lydia\r\nGwilt, and got a yearly allowance for taking care of her (paid through\r\na lawyer) till she was eight years old. At that time, the allowance\r\nstopped; the lawyer had no explanation to offer; nobody came to look\r\nafter her; nobody wrote. The Oldershaws saw her, and thought she might\r\nanswer to exhibit; and the woman parted with her for a trifle to the\r\nOldershaws; and the Oldershaws parted with her for good and all to the\r\nBlanchards. That\xe2\x80\x99s the story of her birth, parentage, and education! She\r\nmay be the daughter of a duke, or the daughter of a costermonger. The\r\ncircumstances may be highly romantic, or utterly commonplace. Fancy\r\nanything you like--there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to stop you. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve had your\r\nfancy out, say the word, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn over the leaves and go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to go on, Jemmy--please to go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next glimpse of Miss Gwilt,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Bashwood the younger, turning\r\nover the papers, \xe2\x80\x9cis a glimpse at a family mystery. The deserted child\r\nwas in luck\xe2\x80\x99s way at last. She had taken the fancy of an amiable young\r\nlady with a rich father, and she was petted and made much of at the\r\ngreat house, in the character of Miss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s last new plaything.\r\nNot long afterward Mr. Blanchard and his daughter went abroad, and took\r\nthe girl with them in the capacity of Miss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s little maid. When\r\nthey came back, the daughter had married, and become a widow, in the\r\ninterval; and the pretty little maid, instead of returning with them to\r\nThorpe Ambrose, turns up suddenly, all alone, as a pupil at a school\r\nin France. There she was, at a first-rate establishment, with her\r\nmaintenance and education secured until she married and settled in life,\r\non this understanding--that she never returned to England. Those were\r\nall the particulars she could be prevailed on to give the lawyer who\r\ndrew up these instructions. She declined to say what had happened\r\nabroad; she declined even, after all the years that had passed, to\r\nmention her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s married name. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite clear, of course, that\r\nshe was in possession of some family secret; and that the Blanchards\r\npaid for her schooling on the Continent to keep her out of the way. And\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s equally plain that she would never have kept her secret as she did\r\nif she had not seen her way to trading on it for her own advantage at\r\nsome future time. A clever woman, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you already! A devilish\r\nclever woman, who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been knocked about in the world, and seen the\r\nups and downs of life abroad and at home, for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, Jemmy; quite true. How long did she stop, please, at the\r\nschool in France?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBashwood the younger referred to the papers. \xe2\x80\x9cShe stopped at the French\r\nschool,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9ctill she was seventeen. At that time something\r\nhappened at the school which I find mildly described in these papers\r\nas \xe2\x80\x98something unpleasant.\xe2\x80\x99 The plain fact was that the music-master\r\nattached to the establishment fell in love with Miss Gwilt. He was a\r\nrespectable middle-aged man, with a wife and family; and, finding the\r\ncircumstances entirely hopeless, he took a pistol, and, rashly assuming\r\nthat he had brains in his head, tried to blow them out. The doctor saved\r\nhis life, but not his reason; he ended, where he had better have begun,\r\nin an asylum. Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s beauty having been at the bottom of the\r\nscandal, it was, of course, impossible--though she was proved to have\r\nbeen otherwise quite blameless in the matter--for her to remain at the\r\nschool after what had happened. Her \xe2\x80\x98friends\xe2\x80\x99 (the Blanchards) were\r\ncommunicated with. And her friends transferred her to another school; at\r\nBrussels, this time--What are you sighing about? What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling a little for the poor music-master, Jemmy. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to her own account of it, dad, Miss Gwilt seems to have felt\r\nfor him too. She took a serious turn; and was \xe2\x80\x98converted\xe2\x80\x99 (as they call\r\nit) by the lady who had charge of her in the interval before she went to\r\nBrussels. The priest at the Belgium school appears to have been a man\r\nof some discretion, and to have seen that the girl\xe2\x80\x99s sensibilities were\r\ngetting into a dangerously excited state. Before he could quiet her\r\ndown, he fell ill, and was succeeded by another priest, who was a\r\nfanatic. You will understand the sort of interest he took in the girl,\r\nand the way in which he worked on her feelings, when I tell you that she\r\nannounced it as her decision, after having been nearly two years at the\r\nschool, to end her days in a convent! You may well stare! Miss Gwilt, in\r\nthe character of a Nun, is the sort of female phenomenon you don\xe2\x80\x99t often\r\nset eyes on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she go into the convent?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bashwood. \xe2\x80\x9cDid they let her go\r\nin, so friendless and so young, with nobody to advise her for the best?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Blanchards were consulted, as a matter of form,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Bashwood\r\nthe younger. \xe2\x80\x9c_They_ had no objection to her shutting herself up in a\r\nconvent, as you may well imagine. The pleasantest letter they ever had\r\nfrom her, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for it, was the letter in which she solemnly took\r\nleave of them in this world forever. The people at the convent were as\r\ncareful as usual not to commit themselves. Their rules wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow\r\nher to take the veil till she had tried the life for a year first, and\r\nthen, if she had any doubt, for another year after that. She tried the\r\nlife for the first year, accordingly, and doubted. She tried it for the\r\nsecond year, and was wise enough, by that time, to give it up without\r\nfurther hesitation. Her position was rather an awkward one when she\r\nfound herself at liberty again. The sisters at the convent had lost\r\ntheir interest in her; the mistress at the school declined to take her\r\nback as teacher, on the ground that she was too nice-looking for the\r\nplace; the priest considered her to be possessed by the devil. There\r\nwas nothing for it but to write to the Blanchards again, and ask them to\r\nstart her in life as a teacher of music on her own account. She wrote\r\nto her former mistress accordingly. Her former mistress had evidently\r\ndoubted the genuineness of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s resolution to be a nun, and had\r\nseized the opportunity offered by her entry into the convent to cut off\r\nall further communication between her ex-waiting-maid and herself. Miss\r\nGwilt\xe2\x80\x99s letter was returned by the post-office. She caused inquiries to\r\nbe made; and found that Mr. Blanchard was dead, and that his daughter\r\nhad left the great house for some place of retirement unknown. The next\r\nthing she did, upon this, was to write to the heir in possession of the\r\nestate. The letter was answered by his solicitors, who were instructed\r\nto put the law in force at the first attempt she made to extort money\r\nfrom any member of the family at Thorpe Ambrose. The last chance was\r\nto get at the address of her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s place of retirement. The family\r\nbankers, to whom she wrote, wrote back to say that they were instructed\r\nnot to give the lady\xe2\x80\x99s address to any one applying for it, without being\r\npreviously empowered to do so by the lady herself. That last letter\r\nsettled the question--Miss Gwilt could do nothing more. With money at\r\nher command, she might have gone to England and made the Blanchards\r\nthink twice before they carried things with too high a hand. Not having\r\na half-penny at command, she was helpless. Without money and\r\nwithout friends, you may wonder how she supported herself while the\r\ncorrespondence was going on. She supported herself by playing the\r\npiano-forte at a low concert-room in Brussels. The men laid siege to\r\nher, of course, in all directions; but they found her insensible as\r\nadamant. One of these rejected gentlemen was a Russian; and he was the\r\nmeans of making her acquainted with a countrywoman of his, whose name is\r\nunpronounceable by English lips. Let us give her her title, and call\r\nher the baroness. The two women liked each other at their first\r\nintroduction; and a new scene opened in Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s life. She became\r\nreader and companion to the baroness. Everything was right, everything\r\nwas smooth on the surface. Everything was rotten and everything was\r\nwrong under it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way, Jemmy? Please to wait a little, and tell me in what way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this way. The baroness was fond of traveling, and she had a select\r\nset of friends about her who were quite of her way of thinking. They\r\nwent from one city on the Continent to another, and were such charming\r\npeople that they picked up acquaintances everywhere. The acquaintances\r\nwere invited to the baroness\xe2\x80\x99s receptions, and card-tables were\r\ninvariably a part of the baroness\xe2\x80\x99s furniture. Do you see it now?\r\nor must I tell you, in the strictest confidence, that cards were not\r\nconsidered sinful on these festive occasions, and that the luck, at the\r\nend of the evening, turned out to be almost invariably on the side of\r\nthe baroness and her friends? Swindlers, all of them; and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na doubt on my mind, whatever there may be on yours, that Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanners and appearance made her a valuable member of the society in the\r\ncapacity of a decoy. Her own statement is that she was innocent of\r\nall knowledge of what really went on; that she was quite ignorant of\r\ncard-playing; that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t such a thing as a respectable friend to\r\nturn to in the world; and that she honestly liked the baroness, for the\r\nsimple reason that the baroness was a hearty good friend to her from\r\nfirst to last. Believe that or not, as you please. For five years she\r\ntraveled about all over the Continent with these card-sharpers in high\r\nlife, and she might have been among them at this moment, for anything I\r\nknow to the contrary, if the baroness had not caught a Tartar at Naples,\r\nin the shape of a rich traveling Englishman, named Waldron. Aha! that\r\nname startles you, does it? You\xe2\x80\x99ve read the Trial of the famous Mrs.\r\nWaldron, like the rest of the world? And you know who Miss Gwilt is now,\r\nwithout my telling you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and looked at his father in sudden perplexity. Far from being\r\noverwhelmed by the discovery which had just burst on him, Mr. Bashwood,\r\nafter the first natural movement of surprise, faced his son with a\r\nself-possession which was nothing short of extraordinary under the\r\ncircumstances. There was a new brightness in his eyes, and a new color\r\nin his face. If it had been possible to conceive such a thing of a\r\nman in his position, he seemed to be absolutely encouraged instead of\r\ndepressed by what he had just heard. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Jemmy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am one of the few people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t read the trial; I only heard of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill wondering inwardly, Bashwood the younger recovered himself, and\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always were, and you always will be, behind the age,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we come to the trial, I can tell you as much about it as you need\r\nknow. In the meantime, we must go back to the baroness and Mr. Waldron.\r\nFor a certain number of nights the Englishman let the card-sharpers\r\nhave it all their own way; in other words, he paid for the privilege of\r\nmaking himself agreeable to Miss Gwilt. When he thought he had produced\r\nthe necessary impression on her, he exposed the whole confederacy\r\nwithout mercy. The police interfered; the baroness found herself in\r\nprison; and Miss Gwilt was put between the two alternatives of accepting\r\nMr. Waldron\xe2\x80\x99s protection or being thrown on the world again. She was\r\namazingly virtuous, or amazingly clever, which you please. To Mr.\r\nWaldron\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment, she told him that she could face the prospect\r\nof being thrown on the world; and that he must address her honorably or\r\nleave her forever. The end of it was what the end always is, where the\r\nman is infatuated and the woman is determined. To the disgust of his\r\nfamily and friends, Mr. Waldron made a virtue of necessity, and married\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old was he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bashwood the elder, eagerly.\r\n\r\nBashwood the younger burst out laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was about old enough,\r\ndaddy, to be your son, and rich enough to have burst that precious\r\npocket-book of yours with thousand-pound notes! Don\xe2\x80\x99t hang your head.\r\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a happy marriage, though he _was_ so young and so rich. They\r\nlived abroad, and got on well enough at first. He made a new will, of\r\ncourse, as soon as he was married, and provided handsomely for his wife,\r\nunder the tender pressure of the honey-moon. But women wear out, like\r\nother things, with time; and one fine morning Mr. Waldron woke up with\r\na doubt in his mind whether he had not acted like a fool. He was an\r\nill-tempered man; he was discontented with himself; and of course he\r\nmade his wife feel it. Having begun by quarreling with her, he got on to\r\nsuspecting her, and became savagely jealous of every male creature who\r\nentered the house. They had no incumbrances in the shape of children,\r\nand they moved from one place to another, just as his jealousy inclined\r\nhim, till they moved back to England at last, after having been married\r\nclose on four years. He had a lonely old house of his own among the\r\nYorkshire moors, and there he shut his wife and himself up from every\r\nliving creature, except his servants and his dogs. Only one result could\r\ncome, of course, of treating a high-spirited young woman in that way.\r\nIt may be her fate, or it may be chance; but, whenever a woman is\r\ndesperate, there is sure to be a man handy to take advantage of it. The\r\nman in this case was rather a \xe2\x80\x98dark horse,\xe2\x80\x99 as they say on the turf. He\r\nwas a certain Captain Manuel, a native of Cuba, and (according to his\r\nown account) an ex-officer in the Spanish navy. He had met Mr. Waldron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeautiful wife on the journey back to England; had contrived to speak\r\nto her in spite of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy; and had followed her to her\r\nplace of imprisonment in Mr. Waldron\xe2\x80\x99s house on the moors. The captain\r\nis described as a clever, determined fellow--of the daring piratical\r\nsort--with the dash of mystery about him that women like--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not the same as other women!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mr. Bashwood, suddenly\r\ninterrupting his son. \xe2\x80\x9cDid she--?\xe2\x80\x9d His voice failed him, and he stopped\r\nwithout bringing the question to an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she like the captain?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Bashwood the younger, with another\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAccording to her own account of it, she adored him. At the same\r\ntime her conduct (as represented by herself) was perfectly innocent.\r\nConsidering how carefully her husband watched her, the statement\r\n(incredible as it appears) is probably true. For six weeks or so they\r\nconfined themselves to corresponding privately, the Cuban captain (who\r\nspoke and wrote English perfectly) having contrived to make a go-between\r\nof one of the female servants in the Yorkshire house. How it might\r\nhave ended we needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble ourselves to inquire--Mr. Waldron himself\r\nbrought matters to a crisis. Whether he got wind of the clandestine\r\ncorrespondence or not, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear. But this is certain, that he came\r\nhome from a ride one day in a fiercer temper than usual; that his wife\r\nshowed him a sample of that high spirit of hers which he had never yet\r\nbeen able to break; and that it ended in his striking her across the\r\nface with his riding-whip. Ungentlemanly conduct, I am afraid we must\r\nadmit; but, to all outward appearance, the riding-whip produced the\r\nmost astonishing results. From that moment the lady submitted as she had\r\nnever submitted before. For a fortnight afterward he did what he liked,\r\nand she never thwarted him; he said what he liked, and she never uttered\r\na word of protest. Some men might have suspected this sudden reformation\r\nof hiding something dangerous under the surface. Whether Mr. Waldron\r\nlooked at it in that light, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. All that is known is that,\r\nbefore the mark of the whip was off his wife\xe2\x80\x99s face, he fell ill, and\r\nthat in two days afterward he was a dead man. What do you say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say he deserved it!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Bashwood, striking his hand\r\nexcitedly on the table, as his son paused and looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor who attended the dying man was not of your way of thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n remarked Bashwood the younger, dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe called in two other medical\r\nmen, and they all three refused to certify the death. The usual legal\r\ninvestigation followed. The evidence of the doctors and the evidence\r\nof the servants pointed irresistibly in one and the same direction; and\r\nMrs. Waldron was committed for trial, on the charge of murdering her\r\nhusband by poison. A solicitor in first-rate criminal practice was\r\nsent for from London to get up the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s defense, and these\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Instructions\xe2\x80\x99 took their form and shape accordingly.--What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter? What do you want now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly rising from his chair, Mr. Bashwood stretched across the table,\r\nand tried to take the papers from his son. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to look at them,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nburst out, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see what they say about the captain from\r\nCuba. He was at the bottom of it, Jemmy--I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear he was at the bottom\r\nof it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody doubted that who was in the secret of the case at the time,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n rejoined his son. \xe2\x80\x9cBut nobody could prove it. Sit down again, dad, and\r\ncompose yourself. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing here about Captain Manuel but the\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s private suspicions of him, for the counsel to act on or not, at\r\nthe counsel\xe2\x80\x99s discretion. From first to last she persisted in screening\r\nthe captain. At the outset of the business she volunteered two\r\nstatements to the lawyer--both of which he suspected to be false. In the\r\nfirst place she declared that she was innocent of the crime. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsurprised, of course, so far; his clients were, as a general rule,\r\nin the habit of deceiving him in that way. In the second place, while\r\nadmitting her private correspondence with the Cuban captain, she\r\ndeclared that the letters on both sides related solely to a proposed\r\nelopement, to which her husband\xe2\x80\x99s barbarous treatment had induced her to\r\nconsent. The lawyer naturally asked to see the letters. \xe2\x80\x98He has burned\r\nall my letters, and I have burned all his,\xe2\x80\x99 was the only answer he\r\ngot. It was quite possible that Captain Manuel might have burned _her_\r\nletters when he heard there was a coroner\xe2\x80\x99s inquest in the house. But it\r\nwas in her solicitor\xe2\x80\x99s experience (as it is in my experience too) that,\r\nwhen a woman is fond of a man, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred,\r\nrisk or no risk, she keeps his letters. Having his suspicions roused\r\nin this way, the lawyer privately made some inquiries about the foreign\r\ncaptain, and found that he was as short of money as a foreign captain\r\ncould be. At the same time, he put some questions to his client about\r\nher expectations from her deceased husband. She answered, in high\r\nindignation, that a will had been found among her husband\xe2\x80\x99s papers,\r\nprivately executed only a few days before his death, and leaving her no\r\nmore, out of all his immense fortune, than five thousand pounds.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was there an older will, then,\xe2\x80\x99 says the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x98which the new\r\nwill revoked?\xe2\x80\x99 Yes, there was; a will that he had given into her own\r\npossession--a will made when they were first married. \xe2\x80\x98Leaving his widow\r\nwell provided for?\xe2\x80\x99 Leaving her just ten times as much as the second\r\nwill left her. \xe2\x80\x98Had she ever mentioned that first will, now revoked, to\r\nCaptain Manuel?\xe2\x80\x99 She saw the trap set for her, and said, \xe2\x80\x98No, never!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwithout an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation. That reply confirmed the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicions. He tried to frighten her by declaring that her life might\r\npay the forfeit of her deceiving him in this matter. With the usual\r\nobstinacy of women, she remained just as immovable as ever. The captain,\r\non his side, behaved in the most exemplary manner. He confessed to\r\nplanning the elopement; he declared that he had burned all the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletters as they reached him, out of regard for her reputation; he\r\nremained in the neighborhood; and he volunteered to attend before the\r\nmagistrates. Nothing was discovered that could legally connect him with\r\nthe crime, or that could put him into court on the day of the trial,\r\nin any other capacity than the capacity of a witness. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nmyself that there\xe2\x80\x99s any moral doubt (as they call it) that Manuel knew\r\nof the will which left her mistress of fifty thousand pounds; and that\r\nhe was ready and willing, in virtue of that circumstance, to marry her\r\non Mr. Waldron\xe2\x80\x99s death. If anybody tempted her to effect her own release\r\nfrom her husband by making herself a widow, the captain must have been\r\nthe man. And unless she contrived, guarded and watched as she was, to\r\nget the poison for herself, the poison must have come to her in one of\r\nthe captain\xe2\x80\x99s letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she used it, if it did come to her!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr.\r\nBashwood. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe it was the captain himself who poisoned her\r\nhusband!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBashwood the younger, without noticing the interruption, folded up the\r\nInstructions for the Defense, which had now served their purpose, put\r\nthem back in his bag, and produced a printed pamphlet in their place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is one of the published Reports of the Trial,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich\r\nyou can read at your leisure, if you like. We needn\xe2\x80\x99t waste time now\r\nby going into details. I have told you already how cleverly her counsel\r\npaved his way for treating the charge of murder as the crowning calamity\r\nof the many that had already fallen on an innocent woman. The two legal\r\npoints relied on for the defense (after this preliminary flourish) were:\r\nFirst, that there was no evidence to connect her with the possession\r\nof poison; and, secondly, that the medical witnesses, while positively\r\ndeclaring that her husband had died by poison, differed in their\r\nconclusions as to the particular drug that had killed him. Both good\r\npoints, and both well worked; but the evidence on the other side bore\r\ndown everything before it. The prisoner was proved to have had no less\r\nthan three excellent reasons for killing her husband. He had treated her\r\nwith almost unexampled barbarity; he had left her in a will (unrevoked\r\nso far as she knew) mistress of a fortune on his death; and she was, by\r\nher own confession, contemplating an elopement with another man. Having\r\nset forth these motives, the prosecution next showed by evidence, which\r\nwas never once shaken on any single point, that the one person in the\r\nhouse who could by any human possibility have administered the poison\r\nwas the prisoner at the bar. What could the judge and jury do, with such\r\nevidence before them as this? The verdict was Guilty, as a matter of\r\ncourse; and the judge declared that he agreed with it. The female part\r\nof the audience was in hysterics; and the male part was not much better.\r\nThe judge sobbed, and the bar shuddered. She was sentenced to death in\r\nsuch a scene as had never been previously witnessed in an English court\r\nof justice. And she is alive and hearty at the present moment; free\r\nto do any mischief she pleases, and to poison, at her own entire\r\nconvenience, any man, woman, or child that happens to stand in her way.\r\nA most interesting woman! Keep on good terms with her, my dear sir,\r\nwhatever you do, for the Law has said to her in the plainest possible\r\nEnglish, \xe2\x80\x98My charming friend, I have no terrors for _you_!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was she pardoned?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bashwood, breathlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey told me\r\nat the time, but I have forgotten. Was it the Home Secretary? If it was,\r\nI respect the Home Secretary! I say the Home Secretary was deserving of\r\nhis place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, old gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Bashwood the younger. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Home\r\nSecretary was the obedient humble servant of an enlightened Free Press,\r\nand he _was_ deserving of his place. Is it possible you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nshe cheated the gallows? If you don\xe2\x80\x99t, I must tell you. On the evening\r\nof the trial, two or three of the young buccaneers of literature\r\nwent down to two or three newspaper offices, and wrote two or three\r\nheart-rending leading articles on the subject of the proceedings in\r\ncourt. The next morning the public caught light like tinder; and the\r\nprisoner was tried over again, before an amateur court of justice,\r\nin the columns of the newspapers. All the people who had no personal\r\nexperience whatever on the subject seized their pens, and rushed\r\n(by kind permission of the editor) into print. Doctors who had _not_\r\nattended the sick man, and who had _not_ been present at the examination\r\nof the body, declared by dozens that he had died a natural death.\r\nBarristers without business, who had _not_ heard the evidence, attacked\r\nthe jury who had heard it, and judged the judge, who had sat on the\r\nbench before some of them were born. The general public followed the\r\nlead of the barristers and the doctors, and the young buccaneers who had\r\nset the thing going. Here was the law that they all paid to protect them\r\nactually doing its duty in dreadful earnest! Shocking! shocking! The\r\nBritish Public rose to protest as one man against the working of its own\r\nmachinery; and the Home Secretary, in a state of distraction, went to\r\nthe judge. The judge held firm. He had said it was the right verdict at\r\nthe time, and he said so still. \xe2\x80\x98But suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 says the Home Secretary,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that the prosecution had tried some other way of proving her guilty at\r\nthe trial than the way they did try, what would you and the jury have\r\ndone then?\xe2\x80\x99 Of course it was quite impossible for the judge to say.\r\nThis comforted the Home Secretary, to begin with. And, when he got the\r\njudge\xe2\x80\x99s consent, after that, to having the conflict of medical evidence\r\nsubmitted to one great doctor; and when the one great doctor took the\r\nmerciful view, after expressly stating, in the first instance, that he\r\nknew nothing practically of the merits of the case, the Home Secretary\r\nwas perfectly satisfied. The prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s death-warrant went into the\r\nwaste-paper basket; the verdict of the law was reversed by general\r\nacclamation; and the verdict of the newspapers carried the day. But\r\nthe best of it is to come. You know what happened when the people found\r\nthemselves with the pet object of their sympathy suddenly cast loose on\r\ntheir hands? A general impression prevailed directly that she was not\r\nquite innocent enough, after all, to be let out of prison then\r\nand there! Punish her a little--that was the state of the popular\r\nfeeling--punish her a little, Mr. Home Secretary, on general moral\r\ngrounds. A small course of gentle legal medicine, if you love us, and\r\nthen we shall feel perfectly easy on the subject to the end of our\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t joke about it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his father. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t, Jemmy!\r\nDid they try her again? They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t! They durs\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t! Nobody can be tried\r\ntwice over for the same offense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! pooh! she could be tried a second time for a second offense,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n retorted Bashwood the younger--\xe2\x80\x9cand tried she was. Luckily for the\r\npacification of the public mind, she had rushed headlong into redressing\r\nher own grievances (as women will), when she discovered that her husband\r\nhad cut her down from a legacy of fifty thousand pounds to a legacy\r\nof five thousand by a stroke of his pen. The day before the inquest a\r\nlocked drawer in Mr. Waldron\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room table, which contained some\r\nvaluable jewelry, was discovered to have been opened and emptied; and\r\nwhen the prisoner was committed by the magistrates, the precious stones\r\nwere found torn out of their settings and sewed up in her stays. The\r\nlady considered it a case of justifiable self-compensation. The law\r\ndeclared it to be a robbery committed on the executors of the dead man.\r\nThe lighter offense--which had been passed over when such a charge as\r\nmurder was brought against her--was just the thing to revive, to save\r\nappearances in the eyes of the public. They had stopped the course of\r\njustice, in the case of the prisoner, at one trial; and now all they\r\nwanted was to set the course of justice going again, in the case of the\r\nprisoner, at another! She was arraigned for the robbery, after having\r\nbeen pardoned for the murder. And, what is more, if her beauty and her\r\nmisfortunes hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made a strong impression on her lawyer, she would not\r\nonly have had to stand another trial, but would have had even the five\r\nthousand pounds, to which she was entitled by the second will, taken\r\naway from her, as a felon, by the Crown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI respect her lawyer! I admire her lawyer!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Bashwood. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould like to take his hand, and tell him so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t thank you, if you did,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Bashwood the younger. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nis under a comfortable impression that nobody knows how he saved Mrs.\r\nWaldron\xe2\x80\x99s legacy for her but himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Jemmy,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed his father. \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t call her\r\nMrs. Waldron. Speak of her, please, by her name when she was innocent,\r\nand young, and a girl at school. Would you mind, for my sake, calling\r\nher Miss Gwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I! It makes no difference to me what name I give her. Bother your\r\nsentiment! let\xe2\x80\x99s go on with the facts. This is what the lawyer did\r\nbefore the second trial came off. He told her she would be found guilty\r\n_again_, to a dead certainty. \xe2\x80\x98And this time,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98the public will\r\nlet the law take its course. Have you got an old friend whom you can\r\ntrust?\xe2\x80\x99 She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t such a thing as an old friend in the world. \xe2\x80\x98Very\r\nwell, then,\xe2\x80\x99 says the lawyer, you must trust me. Sign this paper; and\r\nyou will have executed a fictitious sale of all your property to myself.\r\nWhen the right time comes, I shall first carefully settle with your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s executors; and I shall then reconvey the money to you,\r\nsecuring it properly (in case you ever marry again) in your own\r\npossession. The Crown, in other transactions of this kind, frequently\r\nwaives its right of disputing the validity of the sale; and, if the\r\nCrown is no harder on you than on other people, when you come out of\r\nprison you will have your five thousand pounds to begin the world with\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99 Neat of the lawyer, when she was going to be tried for robbing\r\nthe executors, to put her up to a way of robbing the Crown, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nHa! ha! what a world it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last effort of the son\xe2\x80\x99s sarcasm passed unheeded by the father. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nprison!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cOh me, after all that misery, in prison\r\nagain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bashwood the younger, rising and stretching himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhow it ended. The verdict was Guilty; and the sentence was imprisonment\r\nfor two years. She served her time; and came out, as well as I can\r\nreckon it, about three years since. If you want to know what she did\r\nwhen she recovered her liberty, and how she went on afterward, I may be\r\nable to tell you something about it--say, on another occasion, when you\r\nhave got an extra note or two in your pocket-book. For the present, all\r\nyou need know, you do know. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t the shadow of a doubt that this\r\nfascinating lady has the double slur on her of having been found guilty\r\nof murder, and of having served her term of imprisonment for theft.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s your money\xe2\x80\x99s worth for your money--with the whole of my\r\nwonderful knack at stating a case clearly, thrown in for nothing. If you\r\nhave any gratitude in you, you ought to do something handsome, one of\r\nthese days, for your son. But for me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what you would have\r\ndone, old gentleman. If you could have had your own way, you would have\r\nmarried Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood rose to his feet, and looked his son steadily in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could have my own way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would marry her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBashwood the younger started back a step. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all I have told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he asked, in the blankest astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all you have told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the chance of being poisoned, the first time you happened to\r\noffend her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the chance of being poisoned,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Bashwood, \xe2\x80\x9cin\r\nfour-and-twenty hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Spy of the Private Inquiry Office dropped back into his chair, cowed\r\nby his father\xe2\x80\x99s words and his father\xe2\x80\x99s looks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMad!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cStark mad, by jingo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood looked at his watch, and hurriedly took his hat from a\r\nside-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to hear the rest of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to hear\r\nevery word you have to tell me about her, to the very last. But the\r\ntime, the dreadful, galloping time, is getting on. For all I know, they\r\nmay be on their way to be married at this very moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bashwood the younger, getting between\r\nhis father and the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to the hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, trying to pass him. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngoing to see Mr. Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell him everything you have told me.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused after making that\r\nreply. The terrible smile of triumph which had once already appeared on\r\nhis face overspread it again. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale is young; Mr. Armadale has\r\nall his life before him,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, cunningly, with his trembling\r\nfingers clutching his son\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t frighten _me_ will\r\nfrighten _him_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bashwood the younger. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you as certain as ever\r\nthat Mr. Armadale is the man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who is going to marry her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! yes! yes! Let me go, Jemmy--let me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe spy set his back against the door, and considered for a moment. Mr.\r\nArmadale was rich--Mr. Armadale (if _he_ was not stark mad too) might be\r\nmade to put the right money-value on information that saved him from\r\nthe disgrace of marrying Miss Gwilt. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a hundred pounds in my\r\npocket if I work it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Bashwood the younger. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe a half-penny if I leave it to my father.\xe2\x80\x9d He took up his hat and his\r\nleather bag. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you carry it all in your own addled old head, daddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he asked, with his easiest impudence of manner. \xe2\x80\x9cNot you! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with\r\nyou and help you. What do you think of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father threw his arms in an ecstasy round the son\xe2\x80\x99s neck. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it, Jemmy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in broken tones. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are so good to me. Take\r\nthe other note, my dear--I\xe2\x80\x99ll manage without it--take the other note.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe son threw open the door with a flourish; and magnanimously turned\r\nhis back on the father\xe2\x80\x99s offered pocket-book. \xe2\x80\x9cHang it, old gentleman,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not quite so mercenary as _that_!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with an appearance of\r\nthe deepest feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cPut up your pocket-book, and let\xe2\x80\x99s be off.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\ntook my respected parent\xe2\x80\x99s last five-pound note,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself,\r\nas he led the way downstairs, \xe2\x80\x9chow do I know he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t cry halves\r\nwhen he sees the color of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s money?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCome along, dad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll take a cab and catch the happy bridegroom before he\r\nstarts for the church!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey hailed a cab in the street, and started for the hotel which had\r\nbeen the residence of Midwinter and Allan during their stay in London.\r\nThe instant the door of the vehicle had closed, Mr. Bashwood returned to\r\nthe subject of Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me the rest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking his son\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and patting it\r\ntenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go on talking about her all the way to the hotel. Help\r\nme through the time, Jemmy--help me through the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBashwood the younger was in high spirits at the prospect of seeing the\r\ncolor of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s money. He trifled with his father\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety to\r\nthe very last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s see if you remember what I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you already,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a character in the story that\xe2\x80\x99s dropped out of it without being\r\naccounted for. Come! can you tell me who it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had reckoned on finding his father unable to answer the question. But\r\nMr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s memory, for anything that related to Miss Gwilt, was as\r\nclear and ready as his son\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cThe foreign scoundrel who tempted her,\r\nand let her screen him at the risk of her own life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without\r\nan instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak of him, Jemmy--don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of him\r\nagain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _must_ speak of him,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the other. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to know what\r\nbecame of Miss Gwilt when she got out of prison, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Very\r\ngood--I\xe2\x80\x99m in a position to tell you. She became Mrs. Manuel. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use\r\nstaring at me, old gentleman. I know it officially. At the latter part\r\nof last year, a foreign lady came to our place, with evidence to prove\r\nthat she had been lawfully married to Captain Manuel, at a former period\r\nof his career, when he had visited England for the first time. She had\r\nonly lately discovered that he had been in this country again; and she\r\nhad reason to believe that he had married another woman in Scotland.\r\nOur people were employed to make the necessary inquiries. Comparison of\r\ndates showed that the Scotch marriage--if it was a marriage at all, and\r\nnot a sham--had taken place just about the time when Miss Gwilt was a\r\nfree woman again. And a little further investigation showed us that the\r\nsecond Mrs. Manuel was no other than the heroine of the famous criminal\r\ntrial--whom we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know then, but whom we do know now, to be\r\nidentical with your fascinating friend, Miss Gwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s head sank on his breast. He clasped his trembling hands\r\nfast in each other, and waited in silence to hear the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer up!\xe2\x80\x9d pursued his son. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was no more the captain\xe2\x80\x99s wife than\r\nyou are; and what is more, the captain himself is out of your way now.\r\nOne foggy day in December last he gave us the slip; and was off to the\r\ncontinent, nobody knew where. He had spent the whole of the second Mrs.\r\nManuel\xe2\x80\x99s five thousand pounds, in the time that had elapsed (between two\r\nand three years) since she had come out of prison; and the wonder was,\r\nwhere he had got the money to pay his traveling expenses. It turned out\r\nthat he had got it from the second Mrs. Manuel herself. She had filled\r\nhis empty pockets; and there she was, waiting confidently in a miserable\r\nLondon lodging, to hear from him and join him as soon as he was safely\r\nsettled in foreign parts! Where had _she_ got the money, you may ask\r\nnaturally enough? Nobody could tell at the time. My own notion is, now,\r\nthat her former mistress must have been still living, and that she must\r\nhave turned her knowledge of the Blanchards\xe2\x80\x99 family secret to profitable\r\naccount at last. This is mere guess-work, of course; but there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncircumstance that makes it likely guess-work to my mind. She had an\r\nelderly female friend to apply to at the time, who was just the woman to\r\nhelp her in ferreting out her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s address. Can you guess the name\r\nof the elderly female friend? Not you! Mrs. Oldershaw, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood suddenly looked up. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should she go back,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nthe woman who had deserted her when she was a child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined his son, \xe2\x80\x9cunless she went back in the interests\r\nof her own magnificent head of hair. The prison-scissors, I needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nyou, had made short work of it with Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s love-locks, in every\r\nsense of the word and Mrs. Oldershaw, I beg to add, is the most eminent\r\nwoman in England, as restorer-general of the dilapidated heads and faces\r\nof the female sex. Put two and two together; and perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll agree\r\nwith me, in this case, that they make four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; two and two make four,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated his father, impatiently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I want to know something else. Did she hear from him again? Did he\r\nsend for her after he had gone away to foreign parts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe captain? Why, what on earth can you be thinking of? Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he spent\r\nevery farthing of her money? and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he loose on the Continent out of\r\nher reach? She waited to hear from him. I dare say, for she persisted in\r\nbelieving in him. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay you any wager you like, she never saw the\r\nsight of his handwriting again. We did our best at the office to open\r\nher eyes; we told her plainly that he had a first wife living, and that\r\nshe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the shadow of a claim on him. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe us, though\r\nwe met her with the evidence. Obstinate, devilish obstinate. I dare say\r\nshe waited for months together before she gave up the last hope of ever\r\nseeing him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood looked aside quickly out of the cab window. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere could\r\nshe turn for refuge next?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, not to his son, but to himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, could she do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJudging by my experience of women,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Bashwood the younger,\r\noverhearing him, \xe2\x80\x9cI should say she probably tried to drown herself. But\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s only guess-work again: it\xe2\x80\x99s all guess-work at this part of her\r\nstory. You catch me at the end of my evidence, dad, when you come to\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings in the spring and summer of the present year.\r\nShe might, or she might not, have been desperate enough to attempt\r\nsuicide; and she might, or she might not, have been at the bottom of\r\nthose inquiries that I made for Mrs. Oldershaw. I dare say you\xe2\x80\x99ll see\r\nher this morning; and perhaps, if you use your influence, you may be\r\nable to make her finish her own story herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood, still looking out of the cab window, suddenly laid his\r\nhand on his son\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! hush!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, in violent agitation. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have got there at\r\nlast. Oh, Jemmy, feel how my heart beats! Here is the hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother your heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bashwood the younger. \xe2\x80\x9cWait here while I make\r\nthe inquiries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come with you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his father. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t wait! I tell you, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t wait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went into the hotel together, and asked for \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer, after some little hesitation and delay, was that Mr.\r\nArmadale had gone away six days since. A second waiter added that Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s friend--Mr. Midwinter--had only left that morning. Where had\r\nMr. Armadale gone? Somewhere into the country. Where had Mr. Midwinter\r\ngone? Nobody knew.\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood looked at his son in speechless and helpless dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff and nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bashwood the younger, pushing his father\r\nback roughly into the cab. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s safe enough. We shall find him at Miss\r\nGwilt\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man took his son\xe2\x80\x99s hand and kissed it. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, gratefully. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for comforting me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cab was driven next to the second lodging which Miss Gwilt had\r\noccupied, in the neighborhood of Tottenham Court Road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the spy, getting out, and shutting his father into the\r\ncab. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to manage this part of the business myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knocked at the house door. \xe2\x80\x9cI have got a note for Miss Gwilt,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, walking into the passage, the moment the door was opened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the servant. \xe2\x80\x9cShe went away last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBashwood the younger wasted no more words with the servant. He insisted\r\non seeing the mistress. The mistress confirmed the announcement of Miss\r\nGwilt\xe2\x80\x99s departure on the previous evening. Where had she gone to? The\r\nwoman couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say. How had she left? On foot. At what hour? Between\r\nnine and ten. What had she done with her luggage? She had no luggage.\r\nHad a gentleman been to see her on the previous day? Not a soul, gentle\r\nor simple, had come to the house to see Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\nThe father\xe2\x80\x99s face, pale and wild, was looking out of the cab window as\r\nthe son descended the house steps. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she there, Jemmy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nfaintly--\xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t she there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the spy, with the native coarseness of\r\nhis nature rising to the surface at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not at the end of my\r\ninquiries yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe crossed the road, and entered a coffee-shop situated exactly opposite\r\nthe house he had just left.\r\n\r\nIn the box nearest the window two men were sitting talking together\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of you was on duty yesterday evening, between nine and ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bashwood the younger, suddenly joining them, and putting\r\nhis question in a quick, peremptory whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the men, unwillingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you lose sight of the house?--Yes! I see you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly for a minute, sir. An infernal blackguard of a soldier came in--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bashwood the younger. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what the soldier did,\r\nand who sent him to do it. She has given us the slip again. You are the\r\ngreatest ass living. Consider yourself dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d With those words, and\r\nwith an oath to emphasize them, he left the coffee-shop and returned to\r\nthe cab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his father. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Jemmy, Jemmy, I see it in your\r\nface!\xe2\x80\x9d He fell back into his own corner of the cab, with a faint,\r\nwailing cry. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re married,\xe2\x80\x9d he moaned to himself; his hands falling\r\nhelplessly on his knees; his hat falling unregarded from his head. \xe2\x80\x9cStop\r\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, suddenly rousing himself, and seizing his son in a\r\nfrenzy by the collar of the coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back to the hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Bashwood the younger to the cabman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your noise!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning fiercely on his father. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe varnish of smoothness was all off him by this time. His temper was\r\nroused. His pride--even such a man has his pride!--was wounded to the\r\nquick. Twice had he matched his wits against a woman\xe2\x80\x99s; and twice the\r\nwoman had baffled him.\r\n\r\nHe got out, on reaching the hotel for the second time, and privately\r\ntried the servants with the offer of money. The result of the experiment\r\nsatisfied him that they had, in this instance, really and truly no\r\ninformation to sell. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, he stopped, before\r\nleaving the hotel, to ask the way to the parish church. \xe2\x80\x9cThe chance may\r\nbe worth trying,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself, as he gave the address to the\r\ndriver. \xe2\x80\x9cFaster!\xe2\x80\x9d he called out, looking first at his watch, and then at\r\nhis father. \xe2\x80\x9cThe minutes are precious this morning; and the old one is\r\nbeginning to give in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was true. Still capable of hearing and of understanding, Mr. Bashwood\r\nwas past speaking by this time. He clung with both hands to his son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrudging arm, and let his head fall helplessly on his son\xe2\x80\x99s averted\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nThe parish church stood back from the street, protected by gates and\r\nrailings, and surrounded by a space of open ground. Shaking off his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s hold, Bashwood the younger made straight for the vestry. The\r\nclerk, putting away the books, and the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, hanging up a\r\nsurplice, were the only persons in the room when he entered it and asked\r\nleave to look at the marriage register for the day.\r\n\r\nThe clerk gravely opened the book, and stood aside from the desk on\r\nwhich it lay.\r\n\r\nThe day\xe2\x80\x99s register comprised three marriages solemnized that morning;\r\nand the first two signatures on the page were \xe2\x80\x9cAllan Armadale\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLydia Gwilt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven the spy--ignorant as he was of the truth, unsuspicious as he was of\r\nthe terrible future consequences to which the act of that morning might\r\nlead--even the spy started, when his eye first fell on the page. It was\r\ndone! Come what might of it, it was done now. There, in black and white,\r\nwas the registered evidence of the marriage, which was at once a truth\r\nin itself, and a lie in the conclusion to which it led! There--through\r\nthe fatal similarity in the names--there, in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s own signature,\r\nwas the proof to persuade everybody that, not Midwinter, but Allan, was\r\nthe husband of Miss Gwilt!\r\n\r\nBashwood the younger closed the book, and returned it to the clerk.\r\nHe descended the vestry steps, with his hands thrust doggedly into\r\nhis pockets, and with a serious shock inflicted on his professional\r\nself-esteem.\r\n\r\nThe beadle met him under the church wall. He considered for a moment\r\nwhether it was worth while to spend a shilling in questioning the man,\r\nand decided in the affirmative. If they could be traced and overtaken,\r\nthere might be a chance of seeing the color of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s money even\r\nyet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long is it,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9csince the first couple married here this\r\nmorning left the church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did they go away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe beadle deferred answering that second question until he had first\r\npocketed his fee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t trace them from here, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when he had got his\r\nshilling. \xe2\x80\x9cThey went away on foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is all you know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, sir, is all I know about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeft by himself, even the Detective of the Private Inquiry Office paused\r\nfor a moment before he returned to his father at the gate. He was\r\nroused from his hesitation by the sudden appearance, within the church\r\ninclosure, of the driver of the cab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid the old gentleman is going to be taken ill, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBashwood the younger frowned angrily, and walked back to the cab. As he\r\nopened the door and looked in, his father leaned forward and confronted\r\nhim, with lips that moved speechlessly, and with a white stillness over\r\nall the rest of his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s done us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the spy. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were married here this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s body swayed for a moment from one side to the other. The\r\ninstant after, his eyes closed and his head fell forward toward the\r\nfront seat of the cab. \xe2\x80\x9cDrive to the hospital!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his son. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\na fit. This is what comes of putting myself out of my way to please\r\nmy father,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, sullenly raising Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s head, and\r\nloosening his cravat. \xe2\x80\x9cA nice morning\xe2\x80\x99s work. Upon my soul, a nice\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x99s work!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hospital was near, and the house surgeon was at his post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he come out of it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bashwood the younger, roughly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are _you_?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the surgeon, sharply, on his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am his son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought it,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the surgeon, taking the\r\nrestoratives that were handed to him by the nurse, and turning from\r\nthe son to the father with an air of relief which he was at no pains to\r\nconceal. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, after a minute or two; \xe2\x80\x9cyour father will come\r\nout of it this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen can he be moved away from here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can be moved from the hospital in an hour or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe spy laid a card on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come back for him or send for\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I can go now, if I leave my name and address?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n With those words, he put on his hat, and walked out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a brute!\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the surgeon, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * * * *\r\n\r\nBetween nine and ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock that night, Mr. Bashwood awoke in his bed\r\nat the inn in the Borough. He had slept for some hours since he had been\r\nbrought back from the hospital; and his mind and body were now slowly\r\nrecovering together.\r\n\r\nA light was burning on the bedside table, and a letter lay on it,\r\nwaiting for him till he was awake. It was in his son\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, and\r\nit contained these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR DAD--Having seen you safe out of the hospital, and back at your\r\nhotel, I think I may fairly claim to have done my duty by you, and may\r\nconsider myself free to look after my own affairs. Business will prevent\r\nme from seeing you to-night; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it at all likely I shall\r\nbe in your neighborhood to-morrow morning. My advice to you is to go\r\nback to Thorpe Ambrose, and to stick to your employment in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice. Wherever Mr. Armadale may be, he must, sooner or later, write to\r\nyou on business. I wash my hands of the whole matter, mind, so far as I\r\nam concerned, from this time forth. But if _you_ like to go on with it,\r\nmy professional opinion is (though you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hinder his marriage),\r\nyou may part him from his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray take care of yourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour affectionate son,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJAMES BASHWOOD.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter dropped from the old man\xe2\x80\x99s feeble hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish Jemmy could\r\nhave come to see me to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of him to\r\nadvise me, all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned wearily on the pillow, and read the letter a second time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing left for me but to go back. I\xe2\x80\x99m too\r\npoor and too old to hunt after them all by myself.\xe2\x80\x9d He closed his eyes:\r\nthe tears trickled slowly over his wrinkled cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a trouble\r\nto Jemmy,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, faintly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a sad trouble, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\r\nto poor Jemmy!\xe2\x80\x9d In a minute more his weakness overpowered him, and he\r\nfell asleep again.\r\n\r\nThe clock of the neighboring church struck. It was ten. As the bell\r\ntolled the hour, the tidal train--with Midwinter and his wife among the\r\npassengers--was speeding nearer and nearer to Paris. As the bell tolled\r\nthe hour, the watch on board Allan\xe2\x80\x99s outward-bound yacht had sighted the\r\nlight-house off the Land\xe2\x80\x99s End, and had set the course of the vessel for\r\nUshant and Finisterre.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE THIRD BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MISS GWILT\xe2\x80\x99S DIARY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNAPLES, October 10th.--It is two months to-day since I declared that I\r\nhad closed my Diary, never to open it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have I broken my resolution? Why have I gone back to this secret\r\nfriend of my wretchedest and wickedest hours? Because I am more\r\nfriendless than ever; because I am more lonely than ever, though my\r\nhusband is sitting writing in the next room to me. My misery is a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s misery, and it _will_ speak--here, rather than nowhere; to my\r\nsecond self, in this book, if I have no one else to hear me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow happy I was in the first days that followed our marriage, and how\r\nhappy I made _him_! Only two months have passed, and that time is a\r\nby-gone time already! I try to think of anything I might have said\r\nor done wrongly, on my side--of anything he might have said or done\r\nwrongly, on his; and I can remember nothing unworthy of my husband,\r\nnothing unworthy of myself. I cannot even lay my finger on the day when\r\nthe cloud first rose between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could bear it, if I loved him less dearly than I do. I could conquer\r\nthe misery of our estrangement, if he only showed the change in him as\r\nbrutally as other men would show it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this never has happened--never will happen. It is not in his\r\nnature to inflict suffering on others. Not a hard word, not a hard look,\r\nescapes him. It is only at night, when I hear him sighing in his sleep,\r\nand sometimes when I see him dreaming in the morning hours, that I know\r\nhow hopelessly I am losing the love he once felt for me. He hides, or\r\ntries to hide, it in the day, for my sake. He is all gentleness, all\r\nkindness; but his heart is not on his lips when he kisses me now; his\r\nhand tells me nothing when it touches mine. Day after day the hours that\r\nhe gives to his hateful writing grow longer and longer; day after day he\r\nbecomes more and more silent in the hours that he gives to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, with all this, there is nothing that I can complain of--nothing\r\nmarked enough to justify me in noticing it. His disappointment shrinks\r\nfrom all open confession; his resignation collects itself by such fine\r\ndegrees that even my watchfulness fails to see the growth of it. Fifty\r\ntimes a day I feel the longing in me to throw my arms round his neck,\r\nand say: \xe2\x80\x98For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, do anything to me, rather than treat me like\r\nthis!\xe2\x80\x99 and fifty times a day the words are forced back into my heart by\r\nthe cruel considerateness of his conduct; which gives me no excuse for\r\nspeaking them. I thought I had suffered the sharpest pain that I could\r\nfeel when my first husband laid his whip across my face. I thought I\r\nknew the worst that despair could do on the day when I knew that the\r\nother villain, the meaner villain still, had cast me off. Live and\r\nlearn. There is sharper pain than I felt under Waldron\xe2\x80\x99s whip; there is\r\nbitterer despair than the despair I knew when Manuel deserted me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I too old for him? Surely not yet! Have I lost my beauty? Not a man\r\npasses me in the street but his eyes tell me I am as handsome as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no! no! the secret lies deeper than _that_! I have thought and\r\nthought about it till a horrible fancy has taken possession of me. He\r\nhas been noble and good in his past life, and I have been wicked and\r\ndisgraced. Who can tell what a gap that dreadful difference may make\r\nbetween us, unknown to him and unknown to me? It is folly, it is\r\nmadness; but, when I lie awake by him in the darkness, I ask myself\r\nwhether any unconscious disclosure of the truth escapes me in the close\r\nintimacy that now unites us? Is there an unutterable Something left by\r\nthe horror of my past life, which clings invisibly to me still? And is\r\nhe feeling the influence of it, sensibly, and yet incomprehensibly to\r\nhimself? Oh me! is there no purifying power in such love as mine?\r\nAre there plague-spots of past wickedness on my heart which no\r\nafter-repentance can wash out?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho can tell? There is something wrong in our married life--I can only\r\ncome back to that. There is some adverse influence that neither he nor I\r\ncan trace which is parting us further and further from each other day by\r\nday. Well! I suppose I shall be hardened in time, and learn to bear it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn open carriage has just driven by my window, with a nicely dressed\r\nlady in it. She had her husband by her side, and her children on the\r\nseat opposite. At the moment when I saw her she was laughing and talking\r\nin high spirits--a sparkling, light-hearted, happy woman. Ah, my lady,\r\nwhen you were a few years younger, if you had been left to yourself, and\r\nthrown on the world like me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 11th.--The eleventh day of the month was the day (two months\r\nsince) when we were married. He said nothing about it to me when we\r\nwoke, nor I to him. But I thought I would make it the occasion, at\r\nbreakfast-time, of trying to win him back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever took such pains with my toilet before. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I ever looked better than I looked when I went downstairs this\r\nmorning. He had breakfasted by himself, and I found a little slip of\r\npaper on the table with an apology written on it. The post to England,\r\nhe said, went out that day and his letter to the newspaper must be\r\nfinished. In his place I would have let fifty posts go out rather than\r\nbreakfast without him. I went into his room. There he was, immersed body\r\nand soul in his hateful writing! \xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t you give me a little time this\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. He got up with a start. \xe2\x80\x98Certainly, if you wish it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe never even looked at me as he said the words. The very sound of his\r\nvoice told me that all his interest was centered in the pen that he had\r\njust laid down. \xe2\x80\x98I see you are occupied,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBefore I had closed the door on him he was back at his desk. I have\r\noften heard that the wives of authors have been for the most part\r\nunhappy women. And now I know why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, as I said yesterday, I shall learn to bear it. (What\r\n_stuff_, by-the-by, I seem to have written yesterday! How ashamed I\r\nshould be if anybody saw it but myself!) I hope the trumpery newspaper\r\nhe writes for won\xe2\x80\x99t succeed! I hope his rubbishing letter will be well\r\ncut up by some other newspaper as soon as it gets into print!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do with myself all the morning? I can\xe2\x80\x99t go out, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nraining. If I open the piano, I shall disturb the industrious journalist\r\nwho is scribbling in the next room. Oh, dear, it was lonely enough in\r\nmy lodging in Thorpe Ambrose, but how much lonelier it is here! Shall I\r\nread? No; books don\xe2\x80\x99t interest me; I hate the whole tribe of authors. I\r\nthink I shall look back through these pages, and live my life over again\r\nwhen I was plotting and planning, and finding a new excitement to occupy\r\nme in every new hour of the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might have looked at me, though he _was_ so busy with his\r\nwriting.--He might have said, \xe2\x80\x98How nicely you are dressed this morning!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe might have remembered--never mind what! All he remembers is the\r\nnewspaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--I have been reading and thinking; and, thanks to my\r\nDiary, I have got through an hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a time it was--what a life it was, at Thorpe Ambrose! I wonder I\r\nkept my senses. It makes my heart beat, it makes my face flush, only to\r\nread about it now!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rain still falls, and the journalist still scribbles. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto think the thoughts of that past time over again. And yet, what else\r\ncan I do?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing--I only say supposing--I felt now, as I felt when I traveled\r\nto London with Armadale; and when I saw my way to his life as plainly as\r\nI saw the man himself all through the journey...?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and look out of the window. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and count the people as\r\nthey pass by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA funeral has gone by, with the penitents in their black hoods, and the\r\nwax torches sputtering in the wet, and the little bell ringing, and the\r\npriests droning their monotonous chant. A pleasant sight to meet me at\r\nthe window! I shall go back to my Diary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing I was not the altered woman I am--I only say, supposing--how\r\nwould the Grand Risk that I once thought of running look now? I have\r\nmarried Midwinter in the name that is really his own. And by doing that\r\nI have taken the first of those three steps which were once to lead me,\r\nthrough Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s life, to the fortune and the station of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwidow. No matter how innocent my intentions might have been on the\r\nwedding-day--and they _were_ innocent--this is one of the unalterable\r\nresults of the marriage. Well, having taken the first step, then,\r\nwhether I would or no, how--supposing I meant to take the second step,\r\nwhich I don\xe2\x80\x99t--how would present circumstances stand toward me? Would\r\nthey warn me to draw back, I wonder? or would they encourage me to go\r\non?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will interest me to calculate the chances; and I can easily tear the\r\nleaf out, and destroy it, if the prospect looks too encouraging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are living here (for economy\xe2\x80\x99s sake) far away from the expensive\r\nEnglish quarter, in a suburb of the city, on the Portici side. We\r\nhave made no traveling acquaintances among our own country people. Our\r\npoverty is against us; Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s shyness is against us; and (with\r\nthe women) my personal appearance is against us. The men from whom my\r\nhusband gets his information for the newspaper meet him at the cafe, and\r\nnever come here. I discourage his bringing any strangers to see me; for,\r\nthough years have passed since I was last at Naples, I cannot be sure\r\nthat some of the many people I once knew in this place may not be living\r\nstill. The moral of all this is (as the children\xe2\x80\x99s storybooks say), that\r\nnot a single witness has come to this house who could declare, if any\r\nafter-inquiry took place in England, that Midwinter and I had been\r\nliving here as man and wife. So much for present circumstances as they\r\naffect me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale next. Has any unforeseen accident led him to communicate with\r\nThorpe Ambrose? Has he broken the conditions which the major imposed\r\non him, and asserted himself in the character of Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s promised\r\nhusband since I saw him last?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the sort has taken place. No unforeseen accident has altered\r\nhis position--his tempting position--toward myself. I know all that\r\nhas happened to him since he left England, through the letters which he\r\nwrites to Midwinter, and which Midwinter shows to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been wrecked, to begin with. His trumpery little yacht has\r\nactually tried to drown him, after all, and has failed! It happened (as\r\nMidwinter warned him it might happen with so small a vessel) in a sudden\r\nstorm. They were blown ashore on the coast of Portugal. The yacht went\r\nto pieces, but the lives, and papers, and so on, were saved. The men\r\nhave been sent back to Bristol, with recommendations from their master\r\nwhich have already got them employment on board an outward-bound ship.\r\nAnd the master himself is on his way here, after stopping first at\r\nLisbon, and next at Gibraltar, and trying ineffectually in both places\r\nto supply himself with another vessel. His third attempt is to be made\r\nat Naples, where there is an English yacht \xe2\x80\x98laid up,\xe2\x80\x99 as they call it,\r\nto be had for sale or hire. He has had no occasion to write home since\r\nthe wreck; for he took away from Coutts\xe2\x80\x99s the whole of the large sum\r\nof money lodged there for him, in circular notes. And he has felt no\r\ninclination to go back to England himself; for, with Mr. Brock dead,\r\nMiss Milroy at school, and Midwinter here, he has not a living creature\r\nin whom he is interested to welcome him if he returned. To see us, and\r\nto see the new yacht, are the only two present objects he has in view.\r\nMidwinter has been expecting him for a week past, and he may walk into\r\nthis very room in which I am writing, at this very moment, for all I\r\nknow to the contrary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTempting circumstances, these--with all the wrongs I have suffered\r\nat his mother\xe2\x80\x99s hands and at his, still alive in my memory; with\r\nMiss Milroy confidently waiting to take her place at the head of his\r\nhousehold; with my dream of living happy and innocent in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlove dispelled forever, and with nothing left in its place to help me\r\nagainst myself. I wish it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t raining; I wish I could go out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps something may happen to prevent Armadale from coming to Naples?\r\nWhen he last wrote, he was waiting at Gibraltar for an English steamer\r\nin the Mediterranean trade to bring him on here. He may get tired of\r\nwaiting before the steamer comes, or he may hear of a yacht at some\r\nother place than this. A little bird whispers in my ear that it may\r\npossibly be the wisest thing he ever did in his life if he breaks his\r\nengagement to join us at Naples.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tear out the leaf on which all these shocking things have been\r\nwritten? No. My Diary is so nicely bound--it would be positive barbarity\r\nto tear out a leaf. Let me occupy myself harmlessly with something else.\r\nWhat shall it be? My dressing-case--I will put my dressing-case tidy,\r\nand polish up the few little things in it which my misfortunes have\r\nstill left in my possession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have shut up the dressing-case again. The first thing I found in\r\nit was Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s shabby present to me on my marriage--the rubbishing\r\nlittle ruby ring. That irritated me, to begin with. The second thing\r\nthat turned up was my bottle of Drops. I caught myself measuring the\r\ndoses with my eye, and calculating how many of them would be enough to\r\ntake a living creature over the border-land between sleep and death. Why\r\nI should have locked the dressing-case in a fright, before I had quite\r\ncompleted my calculation, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but I did lock it. And here I\r\nam back again at my Diary, with nothing, absolutely nothing, to write\r\nabout. Oh, the weary day! the weary day! Will nothing happen to excite\r\nme a little in this horrible place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 12th.--Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s all-important letter to the newspaper was\r\ndispatched by the post last night. I was foolish enough to suppose that\r\nI might be honored by having some of his spare attention bestowed on\r\nme to-day. Nothing of the sort! He had a restless night, after all his\r\nwriting, and got up with his head aching, and his spirits miserably\r\ndepressed. When he is in this state, his favorite remedy is to return\r\nto his old vagabond habits, and go roaming away by himself nobody knows\r\nwhere. He went through the form this morning (knowing I had no riding\r\nhabit) of offering to hire a little broken-kneed brute of a pony for me,\r\nin case I wished to accompany him! I preferred remaining at home. I will\r\nhave a handsome horse and a handsome habit, or I won\xe2\x80\x99t ride at all.\r\nHe went away, without attempting to persuade me to change my mind. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have changed it, of course; but he might have tried to persuade\r\nme all the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can open the piano in his absence--that is one comfort. And I am in\r\na fine humor for playing--that is another. There is a sonata of\r\nBeethoven\xe2\x80\x99s (I forget the number), which always suggests to me the agony\r\nof lost spirits in a place of torment. Come, my fingers and thumbs, and\r\ntake me among the lost spirits this morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 13th.--Our windows look out on the sea. At noon to-day we saw\r\na steamer coming in, with the English flag flying. Midwinter has gone to\r\nthe port, on the chance that this may be the vessel from Gibraltar, with\r\nArmadale on board.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--It is the vessel from Gibraltar. Armadale has added one\r\nmore to the long list of his blunders: he has kept his engagement to\r\njoin us at Naples.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will it end _now_?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 16th.--Two days missed out of my Diary! I can hardly tell why,\r\nunless it is that Armadale irritates me beyond all endurance. The mere\r\nsight of him takes me back to Thorpe Ambrose. I fancy I must have been\r\nafraid of what I might write about him, in the course of the last two\r\ndays, if I indulged myself in the dangerous luxury of opening these\r\npages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning I am afraid of nothing, and I take up my pen again\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any limit, I wonder, to the brutish stupidity of some men?\r\nI thought I had discovered Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s limit when I was his neighbor in\r\nNorfolk; but my later experience at Naples shows me that I was wrong. He\r\nis perpetually in and out of this house (crossing over to us in a boat\r\nfrom the hotel at Santa Lucia, where he sleeps); and he has exactly two\r\nsubjects of conversation--the yacht for sale in the harbor here, and\r\nMiss Milroy. Yes! he selects ME as the _confidante_ of his devoted\r\nattachment to the major\xe2\x80\x99s daughter! \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s so nice to talk to a woman\r\nabout it!\xe2\x80\x99 That is all the apology he has thought it necessary to make\r\nfor appealing to my sympathies--_my_ sympathies!--on the subject of \xe2\x80\x98his\r\ndarling Neelie,\xe2\x80\x99 fifty times a day. He is evidently persuaded (if he\r\nthinks about it at all) that I have forgotten, as completely as he has\r\nforgotten, all that once passed between us when I was first at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose. Such an utter want of the commonest delicacy and the commonest\r\ntact, in a creature who is, to all appearance, possessed of a skin, and\r\nnot a hide, and who does, unless my ears deceive me, talk, and not bray,\r\nis really quite incredible when one comes to think of it. But it is, for\r\nall that, quite true. He asked me--he actually asked me, last night--how\r\nmany hundreds a year the wife of a rich man could spend on her dress.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t put it too low,\xe2\x80\x99 the idiot added, with his intolerable grin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neelie shall be one of the best-dressed women in England when I have\r\nmarried her.\xe2\x80\x99 And this to me, after having had him at my feet, and then\r\nlosing him again through Miss Milroy! This to me, with an alpaca gown\r\non, and a husband whose income must be helped by a newspaper!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had better not dwell on it any longer. I had better think and write\r\nof something else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe yacht. As a relief from hearing about Miss Milroy, I declare the\r\nyacht in the harbor is quite an interesting subject to me! She (the men\r\ncall a vessel \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99; and I suppose, if the women took an interest in\r\nsuch things, _they_ would call a vessel \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99)--she is a beautiful model;\r\nand her \xe2\x80\x98top-sides\xe2\x80\x99 (whatever they may be) are especially distinguished\r\nby being built of mahogany. But, with these merits, she has the defect,\r\non the other hand, of being old--which is a sad drawback--and the\r\ncrew and the sailing-master have been \xe2\x80\x98paid off,\xe2\x80\x99 and sent home to\r\nEngland--which is additionally distressing. Still, if a new crew and\r\na new sailing-master can be picked up here, such a beautiful creature\r\n(with all her drawbacks), is not to be despised. It might answer to hire\r\nher for a cruise, and to see how she behaves. (If she is of _my_ mind,\r\nher behavior will rather astonish her new master!) The cruise will\r\ndetermine what faults she has, and what repairs, through the unlucky\r\ncircumstance of her age, she really stands in need of. And then it will\r\nbe time to settle whether to buy her outright or not. Such is Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconversation when he is not talking of \xe2\x80\x98his darling Neelie.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nMidwinter, who can steal no time from his newspaper work for his wife,\r\ncan steal hours for his friend, and can offer them unreservedly to my\r\nirresistible rival, the new yacht.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall write no more to-day. If so lady-like a person as I am could\r\nfeel a tigerish tingling all over her to the very tips of her fingers, I\r\nshould suspect myself of being in that condition at the present moment.\r\nBut, with _my_ manners and accomplishments, the thing is, of course, out\r\nof the question. We all know that a lady has no passions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 17th.--A letter for Midwinter this morning from the\r\nslave-owners--I mean the newspaper people in London--which has set him\r\nat work again harder than ever. A visit at luncheon-time and another\r\nvisit at dinner-time from Armadale. Conversation at luncheon about the\r\nyacht. Conversation at dinner about Miss Milroy. I have been honored,\r\nin regard to that young lady, by an invitation to go with Armadale\r\nto-morrow to the Toledo, and help him to buy some presents for the\r\nbeloved object. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t fly out at him--I only made an excuse. Can\r\nwords express the astonishment I feel at my own patience? No words can\r\nexpress it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 18th.--Armadale came to breakfast this morning, by way of\r\ncatching Midwinter before he shuts himself up over his work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConversation the same as yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s conversation at lunch. Armadale\r\nhas made his bargain with the agent for hiring the yacht. The agent\r\n(compassionating his total ignorance of the language) has helped him to\r\nfind an interpreter, but can\xe2\x80\x99t help him to find a crew. The interpreter\r\nis civil and willing, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the sea. Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassistance is indispensable; and Midwinter is requested (and consents!)\r\nto work harder than ever, so as to make time for helping his friend.\r\nWhen the crew is found, the merits and defects of the vessel are to\r\nbe tried by a cruise to Sicily, with Midwinter on board to give his\r\nopinion. Lastly (in case she should feel lonely), the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 cabin is\r\nmost obligingly placed at the disposal of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s wife. All this\r\nwas settled at the breakfast-table; and it ended with one of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneatly-turned compliments, addressed to myself: \xe2\x80\x98I mean to take Neelie\r\nsailing with me, when we are married. And you have such good taste, you\r\nwill be able to tell me everything the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 cabin wants between that\r\ntime and this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf some women bring such men as this into the world, ought other women\r\nto allow them to live? It is a matter of opinion. _I_ think not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat maddens me is to see, as I do see plainly, that Midwinter finds in\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s company, and in Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s new yacht, a refuge from me. He\r\nis always in better spirits when Armadale is here. He forgets me in\r\nArmadale almost as completely as he forgets me in his work. And I bear\r\nit! What a pattern wife, what an excellent Christian I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 19th.--Nothing new. Yesterday over again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 20th.--One piece of news. Midwinter is suffering from nervous\r\nheadache; and is working in spite of it, to make time for his holiday\r\nwith his friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 21st.--Midwinter is worse. Angry and wild and unapproachable,\r\nafter two bad nights, and two uninterrupted days at his desk. Under any\r\nother circumstances he would take the warning and leave off. But nothing\r\nwarns him now. He is still working as hard as ever, for Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\nHow much longer will my patience last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 22d.--Signs, last night, that Midwinter is taxing his brains\r\nbeyond what his brains will bear. When he did fall asleep, he was\r\nfrightfully restless; groaning and talking and grinding his teeth. From\r\nsome of the words I heard, he seemed at one time to be dreaming of his\r\nlife when he was a boy, roaming the country with the dancing dogs. At\r\nanother time he was back again with Armadale, imprisoned all night on\r\nthe wrecked ship. Toward the early morning hours he grew quieter. I fell\r\nasleep; and, waking after a short interval, found myself alone. My first\r\nglance round showed me a light burning in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room. I\r\nrose softly, and went to look at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was seated in the great, ugly, old-fashioned chair, which I ordered\r\nto be removed into the dressing-room out of the way when we first came\r\nhere. His head lay back, and one of his hands hung listlessly over\r\nthe arm of the chair. The other hand was on his lap. I stole a little\r\nnearer, and saw that exhaustion had overpowered him while he was either\r\nreading or writing, for there were books, pens, ink, and paper on the\r\ntable before him. What had he got up to do secretly, at that hour of\r\nthe morning? I looked closer at the papers on the table. They were all\r\nneatly folded (as he usually keeps them), with one exception; and that\r\nexception, lying open on the rest, was Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked round at him again, after making this discovery, and then\r\nnoticed for the first time another written paper, lying under the hand\r\nthat rested on his lap. There was no moving it away without the risk of\r\nwaking him. Part of the open manuscript, however, was not covered by his\r\nhand. I looked at it to see what he had secretly stolen away to read,\r\nbesides Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s letter; and made out enough to tell me that it was\r\nthe Narrative of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s Dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat second discovery sent me back at once to my bed--with something\r\nserious to think of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTraveling through France, on our way to this place, Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s shyness\r\nwas conquered for once, by a very pleasant man--an Irish doctor--whom\r\nwe met in the railway carriage, and who quite insisted on being friendly\r\nand sociable with us all through the day\xe2\x80\x99s journey. Finding that\r\nMidwinter was devoting himself to literary pursuits, our traveling\r\ncompanion warned him not to pass too many hours together at his desk.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your face tells me more than you think,\xe2\x80\x99 the doctor said: \xe2\x80\x98If you are\r\never tempted to overwork your brain, you will feel it sooner than most\r\nmen. When you find your nerves playing you strange tricks, don\xe2\x80\x99t neglect\r\nthe warning--drop your pen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter my last night\xe2\x80\x99s discovery in the dressing-room, it looks as\r\nif Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s nerves were beginning already to justify the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion of them. If one of the tricks they are playing him is the trick\r\nof tormenting him again with his old superstitious terrors, there will\r\nbe a change in our lives here before long. I shall wait curiously to see\r\nwhether the conviction that we two are destined to bring fatal danger to\r\nArmadale takes possession of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s mind once more. If it does, I\r\nknow what will happen. He will not stir a step toward helping his friend\r\nto find a crew for the yacht; and he will certainly refuse to sail with\r\nArmadale, or to let me sail with him, on the trial cruise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 23d.--Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s letter has, apparently, not lost its\r\ninfluence yet. Midwinter is working again to-day, and is as anxious as\r\never for the holiday-time that he is to pass with his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--Armadale here as usual; eager to know when Midwinter will\r\nbe at his service. No definite answer to be given to the question yet,\r\nseeing that it all depends on Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to continue at his\r\ndesk. Armadale sat down disappointed; he yawned, and put his great\r\nclumsy hands in his pockets. I took up a book. The brute didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand that I wanted to be left alone; he began again on the\r\nunendurable subject of Miss Milroy, and of all the fine things she\r\nwas to have when he married her. Her own riding-horse; her own\r\npony-carriage; her own beautiful little sitting-room upstairs at the\r\ngreat house, and so on. All that I might have had once Miss Milroy is to\r\nhave now--_if I let her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--More of the everlasting Armadale! Half an hour since,\r\nMidwinter came in from his writing, giddy and exhausted. I had been\r\npining all day for a little music, and I knew they were giving \xe2\x80\x98Norma\xe2\x80\x99\r\nat the theater here. It struck me that an hour or two at the opera might\r\ndo Midwinter good, as well as me; and I said: \xe2\x80\x98Why not take a box at the\r\nSan Carlo to-night?\xe2\x80\x99 He answered, in a dull, uninterested manner,\r\nthat he was not rich enough to take a box. Armadale was present, and\r\nflourished his well-filled purse in his usual insufferable way. \xe2\x80\x98_I\xe2\x80\x99m_\r\nrich enough, old boy, and it comes to the same thing.\xe2\x80\x99 With those words\r\nhe took up his hat, and trampled out on his great elephant\xe2\x80\x99s feet to get\r\nthe box. I looked after him from the window as he went down the street.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your widow, with her twelve hundred a year,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought to myself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98might take a box at the San Carlo whenever she pleased, without being\r\nbeholden to anybody.\xe2\x80\x99 The empty-headed wretch whistled as he went his\r\nway to the theater, and tossed his loose silver magnificently to every\r\nbeggar who ran after him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMidnight.--I am alone again at last. Have I nerve enough to write the\r\nhistory of this terrible evening, just as it has passed? I have nerve\r\nenough, at any rate, to turn to a new leaf, and try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE DIARY CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe went to the San Carlo. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s stupidity showed itself, even in\r\nsuch a simple matter as taking a box. He had confounded an opera with a\r\nplay, and had chosen a box close to the stage, with the idea that one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchief object at a musical performance is to see the faces of the singers\r\nas plainly as possible! Fortunately for our ears, Bellini\xe2\x80\x99s lovely\r\nmelodies are, for the most part, tenderly and delicately accompanied--or\r\nthe orchestra might have deafened us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sat back in the box at first, well out of sight; for it was\r\nimpossible to be sure that some of my old friends of former days at\r\nNaples might not be in the theater. But the sweet music gradually\r\ntempted me out of my seclusion. I was so charmed and interested that I\r\nleaned forward without knowing it, and looked at the stage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was made aware of my own imprudence by a discovery which, for the\r\nmoment, literally chilled my blood. One of the singers, among the chorus\r\nof Druids, was looking at me while he sang with the rest. His head was\r\ndisguised in the long white hair, and the lower part of his face was\r\ncompletely covered with the flowing white beard proper to the character.\r\nBut the eyes with which he looked at me were the eyes of the one man on\r\nearth whom I have most reason to dread ever seeing again--Manuel!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it had not been for my smelling-bottle, I believe I should have lost\r\nmy senses. As it was, I drew back again into the shadow. Even Armadale\r\nnoticed the sudden change in me: he, as well as Midwinter, asked if I\r\nwas ill. I said I felt the heat, but hoped I should be better presently;\r\nand then leaned back in the box, and tried to rally my courage. I\r\nsucceeded in recovering self-possession enough to be able to look again\r\nat the stage (without showing myself) the next time the chorus appeared.\r\nThere was the man again! But to my infinite relief he never looked\r\ntoward our box a second time. This welcome indifference, on his part,\r\nhelped to satisfy me that I had seen an extraordinary accidental\r\nresemblance, and nothing more. I still hold to this conclusion, after\r\nhaving had leisure to think; but my mind would be more completely at\r\nease than it is if I had seen the rest of the man\xe2\x80\x99s face without the\r\nstage disguises that hid it from all investigation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the curtain fell on the first act, there was a tiresome ballet to\r\nbe performed (according to the absurd Italian custom), before the opera\r\nwent on. Though I had got over my first fright, I had been far too\r\nseriously startled to feel comfortable in the theater. I dreaded all\r\nsorts of impossible accidents; and when Midwinter and Armadale put the\r\nquestion to me, I told them I was not well enough to stay through the\r\nrest of the performance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the door of the theater Armadale proposed to say good-night. But\r\nMidwinter--evidently dreading the evening with _me_--asked him to come\r\nback to supper, if I had no objection. I said the necessary words, and\r\nwe all three returned together to this house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen minutes\xe2\x80\x99 quiet in my own room (assisted by a little dose of\r\neau-de-cologne and water) restored me to myself. I joined the men at the\r\nsupper-table. They received my apologies for taking them away from the\r\nopera, with the complimentary assurance that I had not cost either of\r\nthem the slightest sacrifice of his own pleasure. Midwinter declared\r\nthat he was too completely worn out to care for anything but the two\r\ngreat blessings, unattainable at the theater, of quiet and fresh air.\r\nArmadale said--with an Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s exasperating pride in his own\r\nstupidity wherever a matter of art is concerned--that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nhead or tail of the performance. The principal disappointment, he was\r\ngood enough to add, was mine, for I evidently understood foreign music,\r\nand enjoyed it. Ladies generally did. His darling little Neelie--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in no humor to be persecuted with his \xe2\x80\x98Darling Neelie\xe2\x80\x99 after\r\nwhat I had gone through at the theater. It might have been the irritated\r\nstate of my nerves, or it might have been the eau-de-cologne flying to\r\nmy head, but the bare mention of the girl seemed to set me in a flame. I\r\ntried to turn Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s attention in the direction of the supper-table.\r\nHe was much obliged, but he had no appetite for more. I offered him wine\r\nnext, the wine of the country, which is all that our poverty allows us\r\nto place on the table. He was much obliged again. The foreign wine was\r\nvery little more to his taste than the foreign music; but he would\r\ntake some because I asked him; and he would drink my health in the\r\nold-fashioned way, with his best wishes for the happy time when we\r\nshould all meet again at Thorpe Ambrose, and when there would be a\r\nmistress to welcome me at the great house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he mad to persist in this way? No; his face answered for him.\r\nHe was under the impression that he was making himself particularly\r\nagreeable to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked at Midwinter. He might have seen some reason for interfering\r\nto change the conversation, if he had looked at me in return. But he\r\nsat silent in his chair, irritable and overworked, with his eyes on the\r\nground, thinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got up and went to the window. Still impenetrable to a sense of his\r\nown clumsiness, Armadale followed me. If I had been strong enough to\r\ntoss him out of the window into the sea, I should certainly have done it\r\nat that moment. Not being strong enough, I looked steadily at the view\r\nover the bay, and gave him a hint, the broadest and rudest I could think\r\nof, to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A lovely night for a walk,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98if you are tempted to walk back\r\nto the hotel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt if he heard me. At any rate, I produced no sort of effect on\r\nhim. He stood staring sentimentally at the moonlight; and--there is\r\nreally no other word to express it--_blew_ a sigh. I felt a presentiment\r\nof what was coming, unless I stopped his mouth by speaking first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98With all your fondness for England,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98you must own that we\r\nhave no such moonlight as that at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looked at me vacantly, and blew another sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I wonder whether it is fine to-night in England as it is here?\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x98I wonder whether my dear little girl at home is looking at the\r\nmoonlight, and thinking of me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could endure it no longer. I flew out at him at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Good heavens, Mr. Armadale!\xe2\x80\x99 I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98is there only one subject\r\nworth mentioning, in the narrow little world you live in? I\xe2\x80\x99m sick to\r\ndeath of Miss Milroy. Do pray talk of something else?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis great, broad, stupid face colored up to the roots of his hideous\r\nyellow hair. \xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 he stammered, with a kind of sulky\r\nsurprise. \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose--\xe2\x80\x99 He stopped confusedly, and looked from\r\nme to Midwinter. I understood what the look meant. \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose she\r\ncould be jealous of Miss Milroy after marrying _you_!\xe2\x80\x99 That is what he\r\nwould have said to Midwinter, if I had left them alone together in the\r\nroom!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs it was, Midwinter had heard us. Before I could speak again--before\r\nArmadale could add another word--he finished his friend\xe2\x80\x99s uncompleted\r\nsentence, in a tone that I now heard, and with a look that I now saw,\r\nfor the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose, Allan,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98that a lady\xe2\x80\x99s temper could be so\r\neasily provoked.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first bitter word of irony, the first hard look of contempt, I had\r\never had from him! And Armadale the cause of it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy anger suddenly left me. Something came in its place which steadied\r\nme in an instant, and took me silently out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sat down alone in the bedroom. I had a few minutes of thought with\r\nmyself, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t choose to put into words, even in these secret\r\npages. I got up, and unlocked--never mind what. I went round to\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s side of the bed, and took--no matter what I took. The last\r\nthing I did before I left the room was to look at my watch. It was\r\nhalf-past ten, Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s usual time for leaving us. I went back at once\r\nand joined the two men again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI approached Armadale good-humoredly, and said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! On second thoughts. I won\xe2\x80\x99t put down what I said to him, or what I\r\ndid afterward. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of Armadale! he turns up at every second word\r\nI write. I shall pass over what happened in the course of the next\r\nhour--the hour between half-past ten and half-past eleven--and take up\r\nmy story again at the time when Armadale had left us. Can I tell what\r\ntook place, as soon as our visitor\xe2\x80\x99s back was turned, between Midwinter\r\nand me in our own room? Why not pass over what happened, in that case\r\nas well as in the other? Why agitate myself by writing it down? I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow! Why do I keep a diary at all? Why did the clever thief the other\r\nday (in the English newspaper) keep the very thing to convict him in\r\nthe shape of a record of everything he stole? Why are we not perfectly\r\nreasonable in all that we do? Why am I not always on my guard and never\r\ninconsistent with myself, like a wicked character in a novel? Why? why?\r\nwhy?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care why! I must write down what happened between Midwinter\r\nand me to-night, _because_ I must. There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason that nobody can\r\nanswer--myself included.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was half-past eleven. Armadale had gone. I had put on my\r\ndressing-gown, and had just sat down to arrange my hair for the night,\r\nwhen I was surprised by a knock at the door, and Midwinter came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was frightfully pale. His eyes looked at me with a terrible despair\r\nin them. He never answered when I expressed my surprise at his coming\r\nin so much sooner than usual; he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even tell me, when I asked the\r\nquestion, if he was ill. Pointing peremptorily to the chair from which\r\nI had risen on his entering the room, he told me to sit down again; and\r\nthen, after a moment, added these words: \xe2\x80\x98I have something serious to\r\nsay to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought of what I had done--or, no, of what I had tried to do--in\r\nthat interval between half-past ten and half-past eleven, which I have\r\nleft unnoticed in my diary--and the deadly sickness of terror, which\r\nI never felt at the time, came upon me now. I sat down again, as I had\r\nbeen told, without speaking to Midwinter, and without looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe took a turn up and down the room, and then came and stood over me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If Allan comes here to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, \xe2\x80\x98and if you see him--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis voice faltered, and he said no more. There was some dreadful grief\r\nat his heart that was trying to master him. But there are times when his\r\nwill is a will of iron. He took another turn in the room, and crushed it\r\ndown. He came back, and stood over me again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98When Allan comes here to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 he resumed, \xe2\x80\x98let him come into my\r\nroom, if he wants to see me. I shall tell him that I find it impossible\r\nto finish the work I now have on hand as soon as I had hoped, and that\r\nhe must, therefore, arrange to find a crew for the yacht without any\r\nassistance on my part. If he comes, in his disappointment, to appeal to\r\nyou, give him no hope of my being free in time to help him if he waits.\r\nEncourage him to take the best assistance he can get from strangers,\r\nand to set about manning the yacht without any further delay. The more\r\noccupation he has to keep him away from this house, and the less you\r\nencourage him to stay here if he does come, the better I shall be\r\npleased. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget one last direction which I\r\nhave now to give you. When the vessel is ready for sea, and when Allan\r\ninvites us to sail with him, it is my wish that you should positively\r\ndecline to go. He will try to make you change your mind; for I shall, of\r\ncourse, decline, on my side, to leave you in this strange house, and in\r\nthis foreign country, by yourself. No matter what he says, let nothing\r\npersuade you to alter your decision. Refuse, positively and finally!\r\nRefuse, I insist on it, to set your foot on the new yacht!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ended quietly and firmly, with no faltering in his voice, and no\r\nsigns of hesitation or relenting in his face. The sense of surprise\r\nwhich I might otherwise have felt at the strange words he had addressed\r\nto me was lost in the sense of relief that they brought to my mind. The\r\ndread of _those other words_ that I had expected to hear from him left\r\nme as suddenly as it had come. I could look at him, I could speak to him\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You may depend,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered, \xe2\x80\x98on my doing exactly what you order me\r\nto do. Must I obey you blindly? Or may I know your reason for the\r\nextraordinary directions you have just given to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis, face darkened, and he sat down on the other side of my\r\ndressing-table, with a heavy, hopeless sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You may know the reason,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98if you wish it.\xe2\x80\x99 He waited a\r\nlittle, and considered. \xe2\x80\x98You have a right to know the reason,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nresumed, \xe2\x80\x98for you yourself are concerned in it.\xe2\x80\x99 He waited a little\r\nagain, and again went on. \xe2\x80\x98I can only explain the strange request I have\r\njust made to you in one way,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98I must ask you to recall what\r\nhappened in the next room, before Allan left us to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looked at me with a strange mixture of expressions in his face. At\r\none moment I thought he felt pity for me. At another, it seemed more\r\nlike horror of me. I began to feel frightened again; I waited for his\r\nnext words in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I know that I have been working too hard lately,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nthat my nerves are sadly shaken. It is possible, in the state I am in\r\nnow, that I may have unconsciously misinterpreted, or distorted, the\r\ncircumstances that really took place. You will do me a favor if you will\r\ntest my recollection of what has happened by your own. If my fancy\r\nhas exaggerated anything, if my memory is playing me false anywhere, I\r\nentreat you to stop me, and tell me of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI commanded myself sufficiently to ask what the circumstances were to\r\nwhich he referred, and in what way I was personally concerned in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You were personally concerned in them in this way,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\ncircumstances to which I refer began with your speaking to Allan about\r\nMiss Milroy, in what I thought a very inconsiderate and very impatient\r\nmanner. I am afraid I spoke just as petulantly on my side, and I beg\r\nyour pardon for what I said to you in the irritation of the moment. You\r\nleft the room. After a short absence, you came back again, and made\r\na perfectly proper apology to Allan, which he received with his usual\r\nkindness and sweetness of temper. While this went on, you and he were\r\nboth standing by the supper-table; and Allan resumed some conversation\r\nwhich had already passed between you about the Neapolitan wine. He said\r\nhe thought he should learn to like it in time, and he asked leave to\r\ntake another glass of the wine we had on the table. Am I right so far?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe words almost died on my lips; but I forced them out, and answered\r\nhim that he was right so far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You took the flask out of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\xe2\x80\x99 he proceeded. \xe2\x80\x98You said\r\nto him, good-humoredly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you don\xe2\x80\x99t really like the wine, Mr.\r\nArmadale. Let me make you something which may be more to your taste. I\r\nhave a recipe of my own for lemonade. Will you favor me by trying it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n In those words, you made your proposal to him, and he accepted it. Did\r\nhe also ask leave to look on, and learn how the lemonade was made? and\r\ndid you tell him that he would only confuse you, and that you would give\r\nhim the recipe in writing, if he wanted it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time the words did really die on my lips. I could only bow my\r\nhead, and answer \xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x99 mutely in that way. Midwinter went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Allan laughed, and went to the window to look out at the Bay, and I\r\nwent with him. After a while Allan remarked, jocosely, that the mere\r\nsound of the liquids you were pouring out made him thirsty. When he said\r\nthis, I turned round from the window. I approached you, and said the\r\nlemonade took a long time to make. You touched me, as I was walking away\r\nagain, and handed me the tumbler filled to the brim. At the same time,\r\nAllan turned round from the window; and I, in my turn, handed the\r\ntumbler to _him_.--Is there any mistake so far?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe quick throbbing of my heart almost choked me. I could just shake my\r\nhead--I could do no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I saw Allan raise the tumbler to his lips.--Did _you_ see it? I saw\r\nhis face turn white in an instant.--Did _you_? I saw the glass fall from\r\nhis hand on the floor. I saw him stagger, and caught him before he fell.\r\nAre these things true? For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, search your memory, and tell\r\nme--are these things true?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe throbbing at my heart seemed, for one breathless instant, to stop.\r\nThe next moment something fiery, something maddening, flew through me.\r\nI started to my feet, with my temper in a flame, reckless of all\r\nconsequences, desperate enough to say anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Your questions are an insult! Your looks are an insult!\xe2\x80\x99 I burst out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Do you think I tried to poison him_?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe words rushed out of my lips in spite of me. They were the last\r\nwords under heaven that any woman, in such a situation as mine, ought to\r\nhave spoken. And yet I spoke them!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe rose in alarm and gave me my smelling-bottle. \xe2\x80\x98Hush! hush!\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You, too, are overwrought--you, too, are overexcited by all that has\r\nhappened to-night. You are talking wildly and shockingly. Good God!\r\nhow can you have so utterly misunderstood me? Compose yourself--pray,\r\ncompose yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might as well have told a wild animal to compose herself. Having\r\nbeen mad enough to say the words, I was mad enough next to return to the\r\nsubject of the lemonade, in spite of his entreaties to me to be silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I told you what I had put in the glass, the moment Mr. Armadale\r\nfainted,\xe2\x80\x99 I went on; insisting furiously on defending myself, when no\r\nattack was made on me. \xe2\x80\x98I told you I had taken the flask of brandy which\r\nyou kept at your bedside, and mixed some of it with the lemonade. How\r\ncould I know that he had a nervous horror of the smell and taste of\r\nbrandy? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he say to me himself, when he came to his senses, It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy fault; I ought to have warned you to put no brandy in it? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\nremind you afterward of the time when you and he were in the Isle of\r\nMan together, and when the doctor there innocently made the same mistake\r\nwith him that I made to-night?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x9cI laid a great stress on my innocence--and with some reason too.\r\nWhatever else I may be, I pride myself on not being a hypocrite. I _was_\r\ninnocent--so far as the brandy was concerned. I had put it into the\r\nlemonade, in pure ignorance of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s nervous peculiarity, to\r\ndisguise the taste of--never mind what! Another of the things I pride\r\nmyself on is that I never wander from my subject. What Midwinter said\r\nnext is what I ought to be writing about now.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looked at me for a moment, as if he thought I had taken leave of\r\nmy senses. Then he came round to my side of the table and stood over me\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If nothing else will satisfy you that you are entirely misinterpreting\r\nmy motives,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t an idea of blaming _you_ in\r\nthe matter--read this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe took a paper from the breast-pocket of his coat, and spread it open\r\nunder my eyes. It was the Narrative of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s Dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn an instant the whole weight on my mind was lifted off it. I felt\r\nmistress of myself again--I understood him at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do you know what this is?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked. \xe2\x80\x98Do you remember what I said to\r\nyou at Thorpe Ambrose about Allan\xe2\x80\x99s Dream? I told you then that two\r\nout of the three Visions had already come true. I tell you now that the\r\nthird Vision has been fulfilled in this house to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe turned over the leaves of the manuscript, and pointed to the lines\r\nthat he wished me to read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read these, or nearly read these words, from the Narrative of the\r\nDream, as Midwinter had taken it down from Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s own lips:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The darkness opened for the third time, and showed me the Shadow of\r\nthe Man and the Shadow of the Woman together. The Man-Shade was the\r\nnearest; the Woman-Shadow stood back. From where she stood, I heard\r\na sound like the pouring out of a liquid softly. I saw her touch the\r\nShadow of the Man with one hand, and give him a glass with the other.\r\nHe took the glass and handed it to me. At the moment when I put it to my\r\nlips, a deadly faintness overcame me. When I recovered my senses again,\r\nthe Shadows had vanished, and the Vision was at an end.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the moment, I was as completely staggered by this extraordinary\r\ncoincidence as Midwinter himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe put one hand on the open narrative and laid the other heavily on my\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_Now_ do you understand my motive in coming here?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked. \xe2\x80\x98_Now_\r\ndo you see that the last hope I had to cling to was the hope that your\r\nmemory of the night\xe2\x80\x99s events might prove my memory to be wrong? _Now_\r\ndo you know why I won\xe2\x80\x99t help Allan? Why I won\xe2\x80\x99t sail with him? Why I am\r\nplotting and lying, and making you plot and lie too, to keep my best and\r\ndearest friend out of the house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Have you forgotten Mr. Brock\xe2\x80\x99s letter?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe struck his hand passionately on the open manuscript. \xe2\x80\x98If Mr. Brook\r\nhad lived to see what we have seen to-night he would have felt what I\r\nfeel, he would have said what I say!\xe2\x80\x99 His voice sank mysteriously, and\r\nhis great black eyes glittered at me as he made that answer. \xe2\x80\x98Thrice\r\nthe Shadows of the Vision warned Allan in his sleep,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on; \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nthrice those Shadows have been embodied in the after-time by You and by\r\nMe! You, and no other, stood in the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s place at the pool. I, and no\r\nother, stood in the Man\xe2\x80\x99s place at the window. And you and I together,\r\nwhen the last Vision showed the Shadows together, stand in the Man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace and the Woman\xe2\x80\x99s place still! For _this_, the miserable day dawned\r\nwhen you and I first met. For _this_, your influence drew me to you,\r\nwhen my better angel warned me to fly the sight of your face. There is a\r\ncurse on our lives! there is a fatality in our footsteps! Allan\xe2\x80\x99s future\r\ndepends on his separation from us at once and forever. Drive him\r\nfrom the place we live in, and the air we breathe. Force him among\r\nstrangers--the worst and wickedest of them will be more harmless to him\r\nthan we are! Let his yacht sail, though he goes on his knees to ask us,\r\nwithout you and without me; and let him know how I loved him in another\r\nworld than this, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary\r\nare at rest!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis grief conquered him; his voice broke into a sob when he spoke those\r\nlast words. He took the Narrative of the Dream from the table, and left\r\nme as abruptly as he had come in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I heard his door locked between us, my mind went back to what he\r\nhad said to me about myself. In remembering \xe2\x80\x98the miserable day\xe2\x80\x99 when we\r\nfirst saw each other, and \xe2\x80\x98the better angel\xe2\x80\x99 that had warned him to\r\n\xe2\x80\x98fly the sight of my face,\xe2\x80\x99 I forgot all else. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what I\r\nfelt--I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t own it, even if I had a friend to speak to. Who cares\r\nfor the misery of such a woman as I am? who believes in it? Besides, he\r\nspoke under the influence of a mad superstition that has got possession\r\nof him again. There is every excuse for _him_--there is no excuse for\r\n_me_. If I can\xe2\x80\x99t help being fond of him through it all, I must take the\r\nconsequences and suffer. I deserve to suffer; I deserve neither love nor\r\npity from anybody.--Good heavens, what a fool I am! And how unnatural\r\nall this would be, if it was written in a book!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has struck one. I can hear Midwinter still, pacing to and fro in his\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is thinking, I suppose? Well! I can think too. What am I to do next?\r\nI shall wait and see. Events take odd turns sometimes; and events may\r\njustify the fatalism of the amiable man in the next room, who curses the\r\nday when he first saw my face. He may live to curse it for other reasons\r\nthan he has now. If I am the Woman pointed at in the Dream, there will\r\nbe another temptation put in my way before long; and there will be no\r\nbrandy in Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s lemonade if I mix it for him a second time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 24th.--Barely twelve hours have passed since I wrote my\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s entry; and that other temptation has come, tried, and\r\nconquered me already!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time there was no alternative. Instant exposure and ruin stared me\r\nin the face: I had no choice but to yield in my own defense. In plainer\r\nwords still, it was no accidental resemblance that startled me at the\r\ntheater last night. The chorus-singer at the opera was Manuel himself!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot ten minutes after Midwinter had left the sitting-room for his\r\nstudy, the woman of the house came in with a dirty little three-cornered\r\nnote in her hand. One look at the writing on the address was enough.\r\nHe had recognized me in the box; and the ballet between the acts of the\r\nopera had given him time to trace me home. I drew that plain conclusion\r\nin the moment that elapsed before I opened the letter. It informed me,\r\nin two lines, that he was waiting in a by-street leading to the beach;\r\nand that, if I failed to make my appearance in ten minutes, he should\r\ninterpret my absence as my invitation to him to call at the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I went through yesterday must have hardened me, I suppose. At any\r\nrate, after reading the letter, I felt more like the woman I once\r\nwas than I have felt for months past. I put on my bonnet and went\r\ndownstairs, and left the house as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was waiting for me at the entrance to the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the instant when we stood face to face, all my wretched life with\r\nhim came back to me. I thought of my trust that he had betrayed; I\r\nthought of the cruel mockery of a marriage that he had practiced on me,\r\nwhen he knew that he had a wife living; I thought of the time when I had\r\nfelt despair enough at his desertion of me to attempt my own life. When\r\nI recalled all this, and when the comparison between Midwinter and the\r\nmean, miserable villain whom I had once believed in forced itself into\r\nmy mind, I knew for the first time what a woman feels when every atom\r\nof respect for herself has left her. If he had personally insulted me at\r\nthat moment, I believe I should have submitted to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he had no idea of insulting me, in the more brutal meaning of the\r\nword. He had me at his mercy, and his way of making me feel it was to\r\nbehave with an elaborate mockery of penitence and respect. I let him\r\nspeak as he pleased, without interrupting him, without looking at him a\r\nsecond time, without even allowing my dress to touch him, as we walked\r\ntogether toward the quieter part of the beach. I had noticed the\r\nwretched state of his clothes, and the greedy glitter in his eyes, in my\r\nfirst look at him. And I knew it would end--as it did end--in a demand\r\non me for money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! After taking from me the last farthing I possessed of my own, and\r\nthe last farthing I could extort for him from my old mistress, he\r\nturned on me as we stood by the margin of the sea, and asked if I could\r\nreconcile it to my conscience to let him be wearing such a coat as\r\nhe then had on his back, and earning his miserable living as a\r\nchorus-singer at the opera!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy disgust, rather than my indignation, roused me into speaking to him\r\nat last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You want money,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98Suppose I am too poor to give it to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In that case,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, \xe2\x80\x98I shall be forced to remember that you are\r\na treasure in yourself. And I shall be under the painful necessity of\r\npressing my claim to you on the attention of one of those two gentlemen\r\nwhom I saw with you at the opera--the gentleman, of course, who is now\r\nhonored by your preference, and who lives provisionally in the light of\r\nyour smiles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made him no answer, for I had no answer to give. Disputing his right\r\nto claim me from anybody would have been a mere waste of words. He knew\r\nas well as I did that he had not the shadow of a claim on me. But the\r\nmere attempt to raise it would, as he was well aware, lead necessarily\r\nto the exposure of my whole past life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill keeping silence, I looked out over the sea. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why,\r\nexcept that I instinctively looked anywhere rather than look at _him_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little sailing-boat was approaching the shore. The man steering was\r\nhidden from me by the sail; but the boat was so near that I thought\r\nI recognized the flag on the mast. I looked at my watch. Yes! It was\r\nArmadale coming over from Santa Lucia at his usual time, to visit us in\r\nhis usual way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I had put my watch back in my belt, the means of extricating\r\nmyself from the frightful position I was placed in showed themselves to\r\nme as plainly as I see them now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI turned and led the way to the higher part of the beach, where some\r\nfishing-boats were drawn up which completely screened us from the view\r\nof any one landing on the shore below. Seeing probably that I had a\r\npurpose of some kind, Manuel followed me without uttering a word. As\r\nsoon as we were safely under the shelter of the boats, I forced myself,\r\nin my own defense, to look at him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What should you say,\xe2\x80\x99 I asked, \xe2\x80\x98if I was rich instead of poor? What\r\nshould you say if I could afford to give you a hundred pounds?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe started. I saw plainly that he had not expected so much as half the\r\nsum I had mentioned. It is needless to add that his tongue lied, while\r\nhis face spoke the truth, and that when he replied to me the answer was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing like enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 I went on, without taking any notice of what he had said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that I could show you a way of helping yourself to twice as much--three\r\ntimes as much--five times as much as a hundred pounds, are you bold\r\nenough to put out your hand and take it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greedy glitter came into his eyes once more. His voice dropped low,\r\nin breathless expectation of my next words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Who is the person?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked. \xe2\x80\x98And what is the risk?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answered him at once, in the plainest terms. I threw Armadale to him,\r\nas I might have thrown a piece of meat to a wild beast who was pursuing\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The person is a rich young Englishman,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98He has just hired the\r\nyacht called the _Dorothea_, in the harbor here; and he stands in need\r\nof a sailing-master and a crew. You were once an officer in the Spanish\r\nnavy--you speak English and Italian perfectly--you are thoroughly\r\nwell acquainted with Naples and all that belongs to it. The rich young\r\nEnglishman is ignorant of the language, and the interpreter who assists\r\nhim knows nothing of the sea. He is at his wits\xe2\x80\x99 end for want of useful\r\nhelp in this strange place; he has no more knowledge of the world than\r\nthat child who is digging holes with a stick there in the sand; and\r\nhe carries all his money with him in circular notes. So much for the\r\nperson. As for the risk, estimate it for yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greedy glitter in his eyes grew brighter and brighter with every\r\nword I said. He was plainly ready to face the risk before I had done\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98When can I see the Englishman?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI moved to the seaward end of the fishing-boat, and saw that Armadale\r\nwas at that moment disembarking on the shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You can see him now,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered, and pointed to the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a long look at Armadale walking carelessly up the slope of the\r\nbeach, Manuel drew back again under the shelter of the boat. He waited\r\na moment, considering something carefully with himself, and put another\r\nquestion to me, in a whisper this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98When the vessel is manned,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and the Englishman sails from\r\nNaples, how many friends sail with him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He has but two friends here,\xe2\x80\x99 I replied; \xe2\x80\x98that other gentleman whom\r\nyou saw with me at the opera, and myself. He will invite us both to sail\r\nwith him; and when the time comes, we shall both refuse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do you answer for that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I answer for it positively.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe walked a few steps away, and stood with his face hidden from me,\r\nthinking again. All I could see was that he took off his hat and passed\r\nhis handkerchief over his forehead. All I could hear was that he talked\r\nto himself excitedly in his own language.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a change in him when he came back. His face had turned to a\r\nlivid yellow, and his eyes looked at me with a hideous distrust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98One last question,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and suddenly came closer to me, suddenly\r\nspoke with a marked emphasis on his next words: \xe2\x80\x98_What is your interest\r\nin this_?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI started back from him. The question reminded me that I _had_ an\r\ninterest in the matter, which was entirely unconnected with the interest\r\nof keeping Manuel and Midwinter apart. Thus far I had only remembered\r\nthat Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s fatalism had smoothed the way for me, by abandoning\r\nArmadale beforehand to any stranger who might come forward to help him.\r\nThus far the sole object I had kept in view was to protect myself, by\r\nthe sacrifice of Armadale, from the exposure that threatened me. I\r\ntell no lies to my Diary. I don\xe2\x80\x99t affect to have felt a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsideration for the interests of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s purse or the safety of\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s life. I hated him too savagely to care what pitfalls my\r\ntongue might be the means of opening under his feet. But I certainly did\r\nnot see (until that last question was put to me) that, in serving his\r\nown designs, Manuel might--if he dared go all lengths for the money--be\r\nserving my designs too. The one overpowering anxiety to protect myself\r\nfrom exposure before Midwinter had (I suppose) filled all my mind, to\r\nthe exclusion of everything else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinding that I made no reply for the moment, Manuel reiterated his\r\nquestion, putting it in a new form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You have cast your Englishman at me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98like the sop to\r\nCerberus. Would you have been quite so ready to do that if you had not\r\nhad a motive of your own? I repeat my question. You have an interest in\r\nthis--what is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I have two interests,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered. \xe2\x80\x98The interest of forcing you to\r\nrespect my position here, and the interest of ridding myself of the\r\nsight of you at once and forever!\xe2\x80\x99 I spoke with a boldness he had not\r\nyet heard from me. The sense that I was making the villain an instrument\r\nin my hands, and forcing him to help my purpose blindly, while he was\r\nhelping his own, roused my spirits, and made me feel like myself again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe laughed. \xe2\x80\x98Strong language, on certain occasions, is a lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprivilege,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98You may, or may not, rid yourself of the sight of\r\nme, at once and forever. We will leave that question to be settled in\r\nthe future. But your other interest in this matter puzzles me. You have\r\ntold me all I need know about the Englishman and his yacht, and you have\r\nmade no conditions before you opened your lips. Pray, how are you to\r\nforce me, as you say, to respect your position here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I will tell you how,\xe2\x80\x99 I rejoined. \xe2\x80\x98You shall hear my conditions first.\r\nI insist on your leaving me in five minutes more. I insist on your never\r\nagain coming near the house where I live; and I forbid your attempting\r\nto communicate in any way either with me or with that other gentleman\r\nwhom you saw with me at the theater--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And suppose I say no?\xe2\x80\x99 he interposed. \xe2\x80\x98In that case, what will you\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In that case,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered, \xe2\x80\x98I shall say two words in private to the\r\nrich young Englishman, and you will find yourself back again among the\r\nchorus at the opera.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You are a bold woman to take it for granted that I have my designs on\r\nthe Englishman already, and that I am certain to succeed in them. How do\r\nyou know--?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I know _you_,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98And that is enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence between us. He looked at me, and I looked\r\nat him. We understood each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was the first to speak. The villainous smile died out of his face,\r\nand his voice dropped again distrustfully to its lowest tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I accept your terms,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98As long as your lips are closed, my\r\nlips shall be closed too--except in the event of my finding that you\r\nhave deceived me; in which case the bargain is at an end, and you will\r\nsee me again. I shall present myself to the Englishman to-morrow, with\r\nthe necessary credentials to establish me in his confidence. Tell me his\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Give me his address?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave it, and turned to leave him. Before I had stepped out of the\r\nshelter of the boats, I heard him behind me again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98One last word,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Accidents sometimes happen at sea. Have\r\nyou interest enough in the Englishman--if an accident happens in his\r\ncase--to wish to know what has become of him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stopped, and considered on my side. I had plainly failed to persuade\r\nhim that I had no secret to serve in placing Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s money and (as\r\na probable consequence) Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s life at his mercy. And it was now\r\nequally clear that he was cunningly attempting to associate himself\r\nwith my private objects (whatever they might be) by opening a means of\r\ncommunication between us in the future. There could be no hesitation\r\nabout how to answer him under such circumstances as these. If the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98accident\xe2\x80\x99 at which he hinted did really happen to Armadale, I stood in\r\nno need of Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s intervention to give me the intelligence of it. An\r\neasy search through the obituary columns of the English papers would\r\ntell me the news--with the great additional advantage that the papers\r\nmight be relied on, in such a matter as this, to tell the truth. I\r\nformally thanked Manuel, and declined to accept his proposal. \xe2\x80\x98Having\r\nno interest in the Englishman,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98I have no wish whatever to know\r\nwhat becomes of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looked at me for a moment with steady attention, and with an\r\ninterest in me which he had not shown yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What the game you are playing may be,\xe2\x80\x99 he rejoined, speaking slowly\r\nand significantly, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know. But I venture on a\r\nprophecy, nevertheless--_you will win it_! If we ever meet again,\r\nremember I said that.\xe2\x80\x99 He took off his hat, and bowed to me gravely. \xe2\x80\x98Go\r\nyour way, madam. And leave me to go mine!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith those words, he released me from the sight of him. I waited a\r\nminute alone, to recover myself in the air, and then returned to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first object that met my eyes, on entering the sitting-room,\r\nwas--Armadale himself!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was waiting on the chance of seeing me, to beg that I would exert\r\nmy influence with his friend. I made the needful inquiry as to what he\r\nmeant, and found that Midwinter had spoken as he had warned me he would\r\nspeak when he and Armadale next met. He had announced that he was unable\r\nto finish his work for the newspaper as soon as he had hoped; and he had\r\nadvised Armadale to find a crew for the yacht without waiting for any\r\nassistance on his part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that it was necessary for me to do, on hearing this, was to perform\r\nthe promise I had made to Midwinter, when he gave me my directions how\r\nto act in the matter. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s vexation on finding me resolved not\r\nto interfere expressed itself in the form of all others that is most\r\npersonally offensive to me. He declined to believe my reiterated\r\nassurances that I possessed no influence to exert in his favor. \xe2\x80\x98If I\r\nwas married to Neelie,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98she could do anything she liked with\r\nme; and I am sure, when you choose, you can do anything you like with\r\nMidwinter.\xe2\x80\x99 If the infatuated fool had actually tried to stifle the last\r\nfaint struggles of remorse and pity left stirring in my heart, he could\r\nhave said nothing more fatally to the purpose than this! I gave him a\r\nlook which effectually silenced him, so far as I was concerned. He went\r\nout of the room grumbling and growling to himself. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all very well\r\nto talk about manning the yacht. I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak a word of their gibberish\r\nhere; and the interpreter thinks a fisherman and a sailor means the\r\nsame thing. Hang me if I know what to do with the vessel, now I have got\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will probably know by to-morrow. And if he only comes here as usual,\r\nI shall know too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 25th.--Ten at night.--Manuel has got him!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has just left us, after staying here more than an hour, and talking\r\nthe whole time of nothing but his own wonderful luck in finding the very\r\nhelp he wanted, at the time when he needed it most.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt noon to-day he was on the Mole, it seems, with his interpreter,\r\ntrying vainly to make himself understood by the vagabond population\r\nof the water-side. Just as he was giving it up in despair, a stranger\r\nstanding by (Manuel had followed him, I suppose, to the Mole from his\r\nhotel) kindly interfered to put things right. He said, \xe2\x80\x98I speak your\r\nlanguage and their language, sir. I know Naples well; and I have been\r\nprofessionally accustomed to the sea. Can I help you?\xe2\x80\x99 The inevitable\r\nresult followed. Armadale shifted all his difficulties on to the\r\nshoulders of the polite stranger, in his usual helpless, headlong way.\r\nHis new friend, however, insisted, in the most honorable manner, on\r\ncomplying with the customary formalities before he would consent to take\r\nthe matter into his own hands. He begged leave to wait on Mr. Armadale,\r\nwith his testimonials to character and capacity. The same afternoon he\r\nhad come by appointment to the hotel, with all his papers, and with \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nsaddest story\xe2\x80\x99 of his sufferings and privations as \xe2\x80\x98a political refugee\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat Armadale had ever heard. The interview was decisive. Manuel left\r\nthe hotel, commissioned to find a crew for the yacht, and to fill the\r\npost of sailing-master on the trial cruise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI watched Midwinter anxiously, while Armadale was telling us these\r\nparticulars, and afterward, when he produced the new sailing-master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntestimonials, which he had brought with him for his friend to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the moment, Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s superstitious misgivings seemed to be all\r\nlost in his natural anxiety for his friend. He examined the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npapers--after having told me that the sooner Armadale was in the\r\nhands of strangers the better!--with the closest scrutiny and the most\r\nbusiness-like distrust. It is needless to say that the credentials were\r\nas perfectly regular and satisfactory as credentials could be. When\r\nMidwinter handed them back, his color rose: he seemed to feel the\r\ninconsistency of his conduct, and to observe for the first time that\r\nI was present noticing it. \xe2\x80\x98There is nothing to object to in the\r\ntestimonials, Allan: I am glad you have got the help you want at last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThat was all he said at parting. As soon as Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s back was turned,\r\nI saw no more of him. He has locked himself up again for the night, in\r\nhis own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is now--so far as I am concerned--but one anxiety left. When the\r\nyacht is ready for sea, and when I decline to occupy the lady\xe2\x80\x99s cabin,\r\nwill Midwinter hold to his resolution, and refuse to sail without me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 26th.--Warnings already of the coming ordeal. A letter from\r\nArmadale to Midwinter, which Midwinter has just sent in to me. Here it\r\nis:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98DEAR MID--I am too busy to come to-day. Get on with your work, for\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake! The new sailing-master is a man of ten thousand. He has\r\ngot an Englishman whom he knows to serve as mate on board already; and\r\nhe is positively certain of getting the crew together in three or four\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 time. I am dying for a whiff of the sea, and so are you, or you\r\nare no sailor. The rigging is set up, the stores are coming on board,\r\nand we shall bend the sails to-morrow or next day. I never was in such\r\nspirits in my life. Remember me to your wife, and tell her she will\r\nbe doing me a favor if she will come at once, and order everything she\r\nwants in the lady\xe2\x80\x99s cabin. Yours affectionately, A. A.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder this was written, in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s hand: \xe2\x80\x98Remember what I told you.\r\nWrite (it will break it to him more gently in that way), and beg him\r\nto accept your apologies, and to excuse you from sailing on the trial\r\ncruise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have written without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s loss of time. The sooner Manuel knows\r\n(which he is certain to do through Armadale) that the promise not to\r\nsail in the yacht is performed already, so far as I am concerned, the\r\nsafer I shall feel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 27th.--A letter from Armadale, in answer to mine. He is full\r\nof ceremonious regrets at the loss of my company on the cruise; and he\r\npolitely hopes that Midwinter may yet induce me to alter my mind. Wait a\r\nlittle, till he finds that Midwinter won\xe2\x80\x99t sail with him either!....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctober 30th.--Nothing new to record until to-day. To-day the change in\r\nour lives here has come at last!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale presented himself this morning, in his noisiest high spirits,\r\nto announce that the yacht was ready for sea, and to ask when Midwinter\r\nwould be able to go on board. I told him to make the inquiry himself in\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s room. He left me, with a last request that I would consider\r\nmy refusal to sail with him. I answered by a last apology for persisting\r\nin my resolution, and then took a chair alone at the window to wait the\r\nevent of the interview in the next room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy whole future depended now on what passed between Midwinter and his\r\nfriend! Everything had gone smoothly up to this time. The one danger to\r\ndread was the danger of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s resolution, or rather of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfatalism, giving way at the last moment. If he allowed himself to\r\nbe persuaded into accompanying Armadale on the cruise, Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexasperation against me would hesitate at nothing--he would remember\r\nthat I had answered to him for Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s sailing from Naples alone; and\r\nhe would be capable of exposing my whole past life to Midwinter before\r\nthe vessel left the port. As I thought of this, and as the slow minutes\r\nfollowed each other, and nothing reached my ears but the hum of voices\r\nin the next room, my suspense became almost unendurable. It was vain\r\nto try and fix my attention on what was going on in the street. I sat\r\nlooking mechanically out of the window, and seeing nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly--I can\xe2\x80\x99t say in how long or how short a time--the hum of\r\nvoices ceased; the door opened; and Armadale showed himself on the\r\nthreshold, alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I wish you good-by,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, roughly. \xe2\x80\x98And I hope, when I am married,\r\nmy wife may never cause Midwinter the disappointment that Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife has caused _me_!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave me an angry look, and made me an angry bow, and, turning\r\nsharply, left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the people in the street again! I saw the calm sea, and the masts\r\nof the shipping in the harbor where the yacht lay! I could think, I\r\ncould breathe freely once more! The words that saved me from Manuel--the\r\nwords that might be Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s sentence of death--had been spoken. The\r\nyacht was to sail without Midwinter, as well as without me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first feeling of exultation was almost maddening. But it was the\r\nfeeling of a moment only. My heart sank in me again when I thought of\r\nMidwinter alone in the next room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went out into the passage to listen, and heard nothing. I tapped\r\ngently at his door, and got no answer. I opened the door and looked in.\r\nHe was sitting at the table, with his face hidden in his hands. I looked\r\nat him in silence, and saw the glistening of the tears as they trickled\r\nthrough his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Leave me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, without moving his hands. \xe2\x80\x98I must get over it by\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went back into the sitting-room. Who can understand women? we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven understand ourselves. His sending me away from him in that manner\r\ncut me to the heart. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the most harmless and most gentle\r\nwoman living could have felt it more acutely than I felt it. And this,\r\nafter what I have been doing! this, after what I was thinking of, the\r\nmoment before I went into his room! Who can account for it? Nobody--I\r\nleast of all!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour later his door opened, and I heard him hurrying down the\r\nstairs. I ran on without waiting to think, and asked if I might go with\r\nhim. He neither stopped nor answered. I went back to the window, and saw\r\nhim pass, walking rapidly away, with his back turned on Naples and the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can understand now that he might not have heard me. At the time I\r\nthought him inexcusably and brutally unkind to me. I put on my bonnet,\r\nin a frenzy of rage with him; I sent out for a carriage, and told the\r\nman to take me where he liked. He took me, as he took other strangers,\r\nto the Museum to see the statues and the pictures. I flounced from room\r\nto room, with my face in a flame, and the people all staring at me. I\r\ncame to myself again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how. I returned to the carriage,\r\nand made the man drive me back in a violent hurry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. I\r\ntossed off my cloak and bonnet, and sat down once more at the window.\r\nThe sight of the sea cooled me. I forgot Midwinter, and thought of\r\nArmadale and his yacht. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a breath of wind; there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na cloud in the sky; the wide waters of the Bay were as smooth as the\r\nsurface of a glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sun sank; the short twilight came and went. I had some tea, and\r\nsat at the table thinking and dreaming over it. When I roused myself and\r\nwent back to the window, the moon was up; but the quiet sea was as quiet\r\nas ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was still looking out, when I saw Midwinter in the street below,\r\ncoming back. I was composed enough by this time to remember his habits,\r\nand to guess that he had been trying to relieve the oppression on his\r\nmind by one of his long solitary walks. When I heard him go into his\r\nown room, I was too prudent to disturb him again: I waited his pleasure\r\nwhere I was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore long I heard his window opened, and I saw him, from my window,\r\nstep into the balcony, and, after a look at the sea, hold up his hand to\r\nthe air. I was too stupid, for the moment, to remember that he had once\r\nbeen a sailor, and to know what this meant. I waited, and wondered what\r\nwould happen next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went in again; and, after an interval, came out once more, and held\r\nup his hand as before to the air. This time he waited, leaning on the\r\nbalcony rail, and looking out steadily, with all his attention absorbed\r\nby the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a long, long time he never moved. Then, on a sudden, I saw him\r\nstart. The next moment he sank on his knees, with his clasped hands\r\nresting on the balcony rail. \xe2\x80\x98God Almighty bless and keep you, Allan!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said, fervently. \xe2\x80\x98Good-by, forever!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked out to the sea. A soft, steady breeze was blowing, and the\r\nrippled surface of the water was sparkling in the quiet moonlight. I\r\nlooked again, and there passed slowly, between me and the track of the\r\nmoon, a long black vessel with tall, shadowy, ghostlike sails, gliding\r\nsmooth and noiseless through the water, like a snake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wind had come fair with the night; and Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s yacht had sailed\r\non the trial cruise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE DIARY BROKEN OFF.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLondon, November 19th.--I am alone again in the Great City; alone, for\r\nthe first time since our marriage. Nearly a week since I started on my\r\nhomeward journey, leaving Midwinter behind me at Turin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe days have been so full of events since the month began, and I have\r\nbeen so harassed, in mind and body both, for the greater part of the\r\ntime, that my Diary has been wretchedly neglected. A few notes, written\r\nin such hurry and confusion that I can hardly understand them myself,\r\nare all that I possess to remind me of what has happened since the night\r\nwhen Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s yacht left Naples. Let me try if I can set this right\r\nwithout more loss of time; let me try if I can recall the circumstances\r\nin their order as they have followed each other from the beginning of\r\nthe month.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the 3d of November--being then still at Naples--Midwinter received\r\na hurried letter from Armadale, date \xe2\x80\x98Messina.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98The weather,\xe2\x80\x99 he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98had been lovely, and the yacht had made one of the quickest passages on\r\nrecord. The crew were rather a rough set to look at; but Captain\r\nManuel and his English mate\xe2\x80\x99 (the latter described as \xe2\x80\x98the best of good\r\nfellows\xe2\x80\x99) \xe2\x80\x98managed them admirably.\xe2\x80\x99 After this prosperous beginning,\r\nArmadale had arranged, as a matter of course, to prolong the cruise;\r\nand, at the sailing-master\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, he had decided to visit some\r\nof the ports in the Adriatic, which the captain had described as full of\r\ncharacter, and well worth seeing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA postscript followed, explaining that Armadale had written in a hurry\r\nto catch the steamer to Naples, and that he had opened his letter again,\r\nbefore sending it off, to add something that he had forgotten. On the\r\nday before the yacht sailed, he had been at the banker\xe2\x80\x99s to get \xe2\x80\x98a few\r\nhundreds in gold,\xe2\x80\x99 and he believed he had left his cigar-case there. It\r\nwas an old friend of his, and he begged that Midwinter would oblige him\r\nby endeavoring recover it, and keeping it for him till they met again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the substance of the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought over it carefully when Midwinter had left me alone again,\r\nafter reading it. My idea was then (and is still) that Manuel had not\r\npersuaded Armadale to cruise in a sea like the Adriatic, so much less\r\nfrequented by ships than the Mediterranean, for nothing. The terms, too,\r\nin which the trifling loss of the cigar-case was mentioned struck me as\r\nbeing equally suggestive of what was coming. I concluded that Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncircular notes had not been transformed into those \xe2\x80\x98few hundreds in\r\ngold\xe2\x80\x99 through any forethought or business knowledge of his own. Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence, I suspected, had been exerted in this matter also, and once\r\nmore not without reason. At intervals through the wakeful night these\r\nconsiderations came back again and again to me; and time after time they\r\npointed obstinately (so far as my next movements were concerned) in one\r\nand the same way--the way back to England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow to get there, and especially how to get there unaccompanied by\r\nMidwinter, was more than I had wit enough to discover that night. I\r\ntried and tried to meet the difficulty, and fell asleep exhausted toward\r\nthe morning without having met it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome hours later, as soon as I was dressed, Midwinter came in, with\r\nnews received by that morning\xe2\x80\x99s post from his employers in London. The\r\nproprietors of the newspaper had received from the editor so favorable\r\na report of his correspondence from Naples that they had determined on\r\nadvancing him to a place of greater responsibility and greater emolument\r\nat Turin. His instructions were inclosed in the letter, and he was\r\nrequested to lose no time in leaving Naples for his new post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn hearing this, I relieved his mind, before he could put the question,\r\nof all anxiety about my willingness to remove. Turin had the great\r\nattraction, in my eyes, of being on the road to England. I assured him\r\nat once that I was ready to travel as soon as he pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thanked me for suiting myself to his plans, with more of his old\r\ngentleness and kindness than I had seen in him for some time past. The\r\ngood news from Armadale on the previous day seemed to have roused him a\r\nlittle from the dull despair in which he had been sunk since the sailing\r\nof the yacht. And now the prospect of advancement in his profession,\r\nand, more than that, the prospect of leaving the fatal place in which\r\nthe Third Vision of the Dream had come true, had (as he owned himself)\r\nadditionally cheered and relieved him. He asked, before he went away to\r\nmake the arrangements for our journey, whether I expected to hear from\r\nmy \xe2\x80\x98family\xe2\x80\x99 in England, and whether he should give instructions for the\r\nforwarding of my letters with his own to the _poste restante_ at Turin.\r\nI instantly thanked him, and accepted the offer. His proposal had\r\nsuggested to me, the moment he made it, that my fictitious \xe2\x80\x98family\r\ncircumstances\xe2\x80\x99 might be turned to good account once more, as a reason\r\nfor unexpectedly summoning me from Italy to England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the ninth of the month we were installed at Turin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the thirteenth, Midwinter--being then very busy--asked if I would\r\nsave him a loss of time by applying for any letters which might have\r\nfollowed us from Naples. I had been waiting for the opportunity he now\r\noffered me; and I determined to snatch at it without allowing myself\r\ntime to hesitate. There were no letters at the _poste restante_ for\r\neither of us. But when he put the question on my return, I told him\r\nthat there had been a letter for me, with alarming news from \xe2\x80\x98home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMy \xe2\x80\x98mother\xe2\x80\x99 was dangerously ill, and I was entreated to lose no time in\r\nhurrying back to England to see her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems quite unaccountable--now that I am away from him--but it is\r\nnone the less true, that I could not, even yet, tell him a downright\r\npremeditated falsehood, without a sense of shrinking and shame, which\r\nother people would think, and which I think myself, utterly inconsistent\r\nwith such a character as mine. Inconsistent or not, I felt it. And what\r\nis stranger--perhaps I ought to say madder--still, if he had persisted\r\nin his first resolution to accompany me himself to England rather than\r\nallow me to travel alone, I firmly believe I should have turned my back\r\non temptation for the second time, and have lulled myself to rest once\r\nmore in the old dream of living out my life happy and harmless in my\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I deceiving myself in this? It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter--I dare say I am.\r\nNever mind what _might_ have happened. What _did_ happen is the only\r\nthing of any importance now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ended in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s letting me persuade him that I was old enough\r\nto take care of myself on the journey to England, and that he owed it to\r\nthe newspaper people, who had trusted their interests in his hands, not\r\nto leave Turin just as he was established there. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer at\r\ntaking leave of me as he suffered when he saw the last of his friend. I\r\nsaw that, and set down the anxiety he expressed that I should write to\r\nhim at its proper value. I have quite got over my weakness for him at\r\nlast. No man who really loved me would have put what he owed to a peck\r\nof newspaper people before what he owed to his wife. I hate him for\r\nletting me convince him! I believe he was glad to get rid of me. I\r\nbelieve he has seen some woman whom he likes at Turin. Well, let\r\nhim follow his new fancy, if he pleases! I shall be the widow of Mr.\r\nArmadale of Thorpe Ambrose before long; and what will his likes or\r\ndislikes matter to me then?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe events on the journey were not worth mentioning, and my arrival in\r\nLondon stands recorded already on the top of the new page.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for to-day, the one thing of any importance that I have done since I\r\ngot to the cheap and quiet hotel at which I am now staying, has been\r\nto send for the landlord, and ask him to help me to a sight of the back\r\nnumbers of _The Times_ newspaper. He has politely offered to accompany\r\nme himself to-morrow morning to some place in the City where all the\r\npapers are kept, as he calls it, in file. Till to-morrow, then, I must\r\ncontrol my impatience for news of Armadale as well as I can. And so\r\ngood-night to the pretty reflection of myself that appears in these\r\npages!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 20th.--Not a word of news yet, either in the obituary column\r\nor in any other part of the paper. I looked carefully through each\r\nnumber in succession, dating from the day when Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s letter was\r\nwritten at Messina to this present 20th of the month, and I am certain,\r\nwhatever may have happened, that nothing is known in England as yet.\r\nPatience! The newspaper is to meet me at the breakfast-table every\r\nmorning till further notice; and any day now may show me what I most\r\nwant to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 21st.--No news again. I wrote to Midwinter to-day, to keep up\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the letter was done, I fell into wretchedly low spirits--I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nimagine why--and felt such a longing for a little company that, in\r\ndespair of knowing where else to go, I actually went to Pimlico, on the\r\nchance that Mother Oldershaw might have returned to her old quarters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were changes since I had seen the place during my former stay\r\nin London. Doctor Downward\xe2\x80\x99s side of the house was still empty. But\r\nthe shop was being brightened up for the occupation of a milliner and\r\ndress-maker. The people, when I went in to make inquiries, were all\r\nstrangers to me. They showed, however, no hesitation in giving me Mrs.\r\nOldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s address when I asked for it--from which I infer that the\r\nlittle \xe2\x80\x98difficulty\xe2\x80\x99 which forced her to be in hiding in August last is\r\nat an end, so far as she is concerned. As for the doctor, the people at\r\nthe shop either were, or pretended to be, quite unable to tell me what\r\nhad become of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it was the sight of the place at Pimlico that\r\nsickened me, or whether it was my own perversity, or what. But now that\r\nI had got Mrs. Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s address, I felt as if she was the very last\r\nperson in the world that I wanted to see. I took a cab, and told the man\r\nto drive to the street she lived in, and then told him to drive back to\r\nthe hotel. I hardly know what is the matter with me--unless it is that\r\nI am getting more impatient every hour for information about Armadale.\r\nWhen will the future look a little less dark, I wonder? To-morrow is\r\nSaturday. Will to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper lift the veil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 22d.--Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper _has_ lifted the veil! Words are\r\nvain to express the panic of astonishment in which I write. I never once\r\nanticipated it; I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it or realize it, now it has happened.\r\nThe winds and waves themselves have turned my accomplices! The yacht has\r\nfoundered at sea, and every soul on board has perished!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the account cut out of this morning\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98DISASTER AT SEA.--Intelligence has reached the Royal Yacht Squadron\r\nand the insurers which leaves no reasonable doubt, we regret to say,\r\nof the total loss, on the fifth of the present month, of the yacht\r\n_Dorothea_, with every soul on board. The particulars are as follows:\r\nAt daylight, on the morning of the sixth, the Italian brig _Speranza_,\r\nbound from Venice to Marsala for orders, encountered some floating\r\nobjects off Cape Spartivento (at the southernmost extremity of Italy)\r\nwhich attracted the curiosity of the people of the brig. The previous\r\nday had been marked by one of the most severe of the sudden and violent\r\nstorms, peculiar to these southern seas, which has been remembered\r\nfor years. The _Speranza_ herself having been in danger while the gale\r\nlasted, the captain and crew concluded that they were on the traces of\r\na wreck, and a boat was lowered for the purpose of examining the objects\r\nin the water. A hen-coop, some broken spars, and fragments of shattered\r\nplank were the first evidences discovered of the terrible disaster that\r\nhad happened. Some of the lighter articles of cabin furniture, wrenched\r\nand shattered, were found next. And, lastly, a memento of melancholy\r\ninterest turned up, in the shape of a lifebuoy, with a corked bottle\r\nattached to it. These latter objects, with the relics of cabin\r\nfurniture, were brought on board the _Speranza_. On the buoy the name\r\nof the vessel was painted, as follows: \xe2\x80\x9c_Dorothea, R. Y. S._\xe2\x80\x9d (meaning\r\nRoyal Yacht Squadron). The bottle, on being uncorked, contained a sheet\r\nof note-paper, on which the following lines were hurriedly traced in\r\npencil: \xe2\x80\x9cOff Cape Spartivento; two days out from Messina. Nov. 5th, 4\r\nP.M.\xe2\x80\x9d (being the hour at which the log of the Italian brig showed the\r\nstorm to have been at its height). \xe2\x80\x9cBoth our boats are stove in by the\r\nsea. The rudder is gone, and we have sprung a leak astern which is more\r\nthan we can stop. The Lord help us all--we are sinking. (Signed) John\r\nMitchenden, Mate.\xe2\x80\x9d On reaching Marsala, the captain of the brig made his\r\nreport to the British consul, and left the objects discovered in that\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s charge. Inquiry at Messina showed that the ill-fated vessel\r\nhad arrived there from Naples. At the latter port it was ascertained\r\nthat the _Dorothea_ had been hired from the owner\xe2\x80\x99s agent by an English\r\ngentleman, Mr. Armadale, of Thorpe Ambrose, Norfolk. Whether Mr.\r\nArmadale had any friends on board with him has not been clearly\r\ndiscovered. But there is unhappily no doubt that the ill-fated gentleman\r\nhimself sailed in the yacht from Naples, and that he was also on board\r\nof the vessel when she left Messina.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch is the story of the wreck, as the newspaper tells it in the\r\nplainest and fewest words. My head is in a whirl; my confusion is so\r\ngreat that I think of fifty different things in trying to think of one.\r\nI must wait--a day more or less is of no consequence now--I must wait\r\ntill I can face my new position, without feeling bewildered by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 23d.--Eight in the morning.--I rose an hour ago, and saw\r\nmy way clearly to the first step that I must take under present\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is of the utmost importance to me to know what is doing at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose; and it would be the height of rashness, while I am quite in the\r\ndark in this matter, to venture there myself. The only other alternative\r\nis to write to somebody on the spot for news; and the only person I can\r\nwrite to is--Bashwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just finished the letter. It is headed \xe2\x80\x98private and\r\nconfidential,\xe2\x80\x99 and signed \xe2\x80\x98Lydia Armadale.\xe2\x80\x99 There is nothing in it to\r\ncompromise me, if the old fool is mortally offended by my treatment of\r\nhim, and if he spitefully shows my letter to other people. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve he will do this. A man at his age forgives a woman anything,\r\nif the woman only encourages him. I have requested him, as a personal\r\nfavor, to keep our correspondence for the present strictly private. I\r\nhave hinted that my married life with my deceased husband has not been\r\na happy one; and that I feel the injudiciousness of having married a\r\n_young_ man. In the postscript I go further still, and venture boldly on\r\nthese comforting words: \xe2\x80\x98I can explain, dear Mr. Bashwood, what may have\r\nseemed fake and deceitful in my conduct toward you when you give me a\r\npersonal opportunity.\xe2\x80\x99 If he was on the right side of sixty, I should\r\nfeel doubtful of results. But he is on the wrong side of sixty, and I\r\nbelieve he will give me my personal opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--I have been looking over the copy of my marriage\r\ncertificate, with which I took care to provide myself on the\r\nwedding-day; and I have discovered, to my inexpressible dismay, an\r\nobstacle to my appearance in the character of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow which I\r\nnow see for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe description of Midwinter (under his own name) which the certificate\r\npresents answers in every important particular to what would have been\r\nthe description of Armadale of Thorpe Ambrose, if I had really married\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x98Name and Surname\xe2\x80\x99--Allan Armadale. \xe2\x80\x98Age\xe2\x80\x99--twenty-one,\r\ninstead of twenty-two, which might easily pass for a mistake.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Condition\xe2\x80\x99--Bachelor. \xe2\x80\x98Rank or profession\xe2\x80\x99--Gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98Residence at\r\nthe time of Marriage\xe2\x80\x99--Frant\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, Darley Street. \xe2\x80\x98Father\xe2\x80\x99s Name and\r\nSurname\xe2\x80\x99--Allan Armadale. \xe2\x80\x98Rank or Profession of Father\xe2\x80\x99--Gentleman.\r\nEvery particular (except the year\xe2\x80\x99s difference in their two ages) which\r\nanswers for the one answers for the other. But suppose, when I produce\r\nmy copy of the certificate, that some meddlesome lawyer insists on\r\nlooking at the original register? Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s writing is as different as\r\npossible from the writing of his dead friend. The hand in which he has\r\nwritten \xe2\x80\x98Allan Armadale\xe2\x80\x99 in the book has not a chance of passing for\r\nthe hand in which Armadale of Thorpe Ambrose was accustomed to sign his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I move safely in the matter, with such a pitfall as I see here open\r\nunder my feet? How can I tell? Where can I find an experienced person to\r\ninform me? I must shut up my diary and think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--My prospects have changed again since I made my last\r\nentry. I have received a warning to be careful in the future which I\r\nshall not neglect; and I have (I believe) succeeded in providing myself\r\nwith the advice and assistance of which I stand in need.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter vainly trying to think of some better person to apply to in the\r\ndifficulty which embarrassed me, I made a virtue of necessity, and set\r\nforth to surprise Mrs. Oldershaw by a visit from her darling Lydia! It\r\nis almost needless to add that I determined to sound her carefully, and\r\nnot to let any secret of importance out of my own possession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sour and solemn old maid-servant admitted me into the house. When I\r\nasked for her mistress, I was reminded with the bitterest emphasis that\r\nI had committed the impropriety of calling on a Sunday. Mrs. Oldershaw\r\nwas at home, solely in consequence of being too unwell to go to church!\r\nThe servant thought it very unlikely that she would see me. I thought\r\nit highly probable, on the contrary, that she would honor me with\r\nan interview in her own interests, if I sent in my name as \xe2\x80\x98Miss\r\nGwilt\xe2\x80\x99--and the event proved that I was right. After being kept waiting\r\nsome minutes I was shown into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere sat Mother Jezebel, with the air of a woman resting on the\r\nhigh-road to heaven, dressed in a slate-colored gown, with gray mittens\r\non her hands, a severely simple cap on her head, and a volume of sermons\r\non her lap. She turned up the whites of her eyes devoutly at the sight\r\nof me, and the first words she said were--\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Lydia! Lydia! why are you\r\nnot at church?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had been less anxious, the sudden presentation of Mrs. Oldershaw\r\nin an entirely new character might have amused me. But I was in no\r\nhumor for laughing, and (my notes of hand being all paid) I was under\r\nno obligation to restrain my natural freedom of speech. \xe2\x80\x98Stuff and\r\nnonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98Put your Sunday face in your pocket. I have got some\r\nnews for you, since I last wrote from Thorpe Ambrose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe instant I mentioned \xe2\x80\x98Thorpe Ambrose,\xe2\x80\x99 the whites of the old\r\nhypocrite\xe2\x80\x99s eyes showed themselves again, and she flatly refused to\r\nhear a word more from me on the subject of my proceedings in Norfolk. I\r\ninsisted; but it was quite useless. Mother Oldershaw only shook her\r\nhead and groaned, and informed me that her connection with the pomps and\r\nvanities of the world was at an end forever. \xe2\x80\x98I have been born again,\r\nLydia,\xe2\x80\x99 said the brazen old wretch, wiping her eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Nothing will\r\ninduce me to return to the subject of that wicked speculation of yours\r\non the folly of a rich young man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter hearing this, I should have left her on the spot, but for one\r\nconsideration which delayed me a moment longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was easy to see, by this time, that the circumstances (whatever they\r\nmight have been) which had obliged Mother Oldershaw to keep in hiding,\r\non the occasion of my former visit to London, had been sufficiently\r\nserious to force her into giving up, or appearing to give up, her old\r\nbusiness. And it was hardly less plain that she had found it to her\r\nadvantage--everybody in England finds it to their advantage in some way\r\nto cover the outer side of her character carefully with a smooth varnish\r\nof Cant. This was, however, no business of mine; and I should have made\r\nthese reflections outside instead of inside the house, if my interests\r\nhad not been involved in putting the sincerity of Mother Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreformation to the test--so far as it affected her past connection with\r\nmyself. At the time when she had fitted me out for our enterprise, I\r\nremembered signing a certain business document which gave her a handsome\r\npecuniary interest in my success, if I became Mrs. Armadale of Thorpe\r\nAmbrose. The chance of turning this mischievous morsel of paper to\r\ngood account, in the capacity of a touchstone, was too tempting to be\r\nresisted. I asked my devout friend\xe2\x80\x99s permission to say one last word\r\nbefore I left the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98As you have no further interest in my wicked speculation at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98perhaps you will give me back the written paper that\r\nI signed, when you were not quite such an exemplary person as you are\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe shameless old hypocrite instantly shut her eyes and shuddered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Does that mean Yes, or No\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98On moral and religious grounds, Lydia,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Oldershaw, \xe2\x80\x98it means\r\nNo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98On wicked and worldly grounds,\xe2\x80\x99 I rejoined, \xe2\x80\x98I beg to thank you for\r\nshowing me your hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere could, indeed, be no doubt now about the object she really had\r\nin view. She would run no more risks and lend no more money; she would\r\nleave me to win or lose single-handed. If I lost, she would not be\r\ncompromised. If I won, she would produce the paper I had signed, and\r\nprofit by it without remorse. In my present situation, it was mere waste\r\nof time and words to prolong the matter by any useless recrimination on\r\nmy side. I put the warning away privately in my memory for future use,\r\nand got up to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the moment when I left my chair there was a sharp double knock at\r\nthe street door. Mrs. Oldershaw evidently recognized it. She rose in a\r\nviolent hurry, and rang the bell. \xe2\x80\x98I am too unwell to see anybody,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid, when the servant appeared. \xe2\x80\x98Wait a moment, if you please,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nadded, turning sharply on me, when the woman had left us to answer the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was small, very small, spitefulness on my part, I know; but the\r\nsatisfaction of thwarting Mother Jezebel, even in a trifle, was not to\r\nbe resisted. \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98you reminded me just now that I\r\nought to be at church.\xe2\x80\x99 Before she could answer I was out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I put my foot on the first stair the street door was opened, and a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s voice inquired whether Mrs. Oldershaw was at home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI instantly recognized the voice. Doctor Downward!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor repeated the servant\xe2\x80\x99s message in a tone which betrayed\r\nunmistakable irritation at finding himself admitted no further than the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Your mistress is not well enough to see visitors? Give her that card,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the doctor, \xe2\x80\x98and say I expect her, the next time I call, to be well\r\nenough to see _me_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf his voice had not told me plainly that he felt in no friendly mood\r\ntoward Mrs. Oldershaw, I dare say I should have let him go without\r\nclaiming his acquaintance; but, as things were, I felt an impulse to\r\nspeak to him or to anybody who had a grudge against Mother Jezebel.\r\nThere was more of my small spitefulness in this, I suppose. Anyway, I\r\nslipped downstairs; and, following the doctor out quietly, overtook him\r\nin the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had recognized his voice, and I recognized his back as I walked\r\nbehind him. But when I called him by his name, and when he turned round\r\nwith a start and confronted me, I followed his example, and started on\r\nmy side. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s face was transformed into the face of a perfect\r\nstranger! His baldness had hidden itself under an artfully grizzled wig.\r\nHe had allowed his whiskers to grow, and had dyed them to match his new\r\nhead of hair. Hideous circular spectacles bestrode his nose in place of\r\nthe neat double eyeglass that he used to carry in his hand; and a\r\nblack neckerchief, surmounted by immense shirt-collars, appeared as the\r\nunworthy successor of the clerical white cravat of former times. Nothing\r\nremained of the man I once knew but the comfortable plumpness of his\r\nfigure, and the confidential courtesy and smoothness of his manner and\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Charmed to see you again,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, looking about him a little\r\nanxiously, and producing his card-case in a very precipitate manner.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, my dear Miss Gwilt, permit me to rectify a slight mistake on\r\nyour part. Doctor Downward of Pimlico is dead and buried; and you will\r\ninfinitely oblige me if you will never, on any consideration, mention\r\nhim again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took the card he offered me, and discovered that I was now supposed\r\nto be speaking to \xe2\x80\x98Doctor Le Doux, of the Sanitarium, Fairweather Vale,\r\nHampstead!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You seem to have found it necessary,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98to change a great many\r\nthings since I last saw you? Your name, your residence, your personal\r\nappearance--?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And my branch of practice,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the doctor. \xe2\x80\x98I have purchased\r\nof the original possessor (a person of feeble enterprise and no\r\nresources) a name, a diploma, and a partially completed sanitarium for\r\nthe reception of nervous invalids. We are open already to the inspection\r\nof a few privileged friends--come and see us. Are you walking my way?\r\nPray take my arm, and tell me to what happy chance I am indebted for the\r\npleasure of seeing you again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told him the circumstances exactly as they had happened, and I added\r\n(with a view to making sure of his relations with his former ally at\r\nPimlico) that I had been greatly surprised to hear Mrs. Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s door\r\nshut on such an old friend as himself. Cautious as he was, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner of receiving my remark satisfied me at once that my suspicions\r\nof an estrangement were well founded. His smile vanished, and he settled\r\nhis hideous spectacles irritably on the bridge of his nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me if I leave you to draw your own conclusions,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nsubject of Mrs. Oldershaw is, I regret to say, far from agreeable to me\r\nunder existing circumstances--a business difficulty connected with our\r\nlate partnership at Pimlico, entirely without interest for a young and\r\nbrilliant woman like yourself. Tell me your news! Have you left your\r\nsituation at Thorpe Ambrose? Are you residing in London? Is there\r\nanything, professional or otherwise, that I can do for you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat last question was a more important one than he supposed. Before\r\nI answered it, I felt the necessity of parting company with him and of\r\ngetting a little time to think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You have kindly asked me, doctor, to pay you a visit,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98In\r\nyour quiet house at Hampstead, I may possibly have something to say to\r\nyou which I can\xe2\x80\x99t say in this noisy street. When are you at home at the\r\nSanitarium? Should I find you there later in the day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor assured me that he was then on his way back, and begged that\r\nI would name my own hour. I said, \xe2\x80\x98Toward the afternoon;\xe2\x80\x99 and, pleading\r\nan engagement, hailed the first omnibus that passed us. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget\r\nthe address,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, as he handed me in. \xe2\x80\x98I have got your\r\ncard,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered, and so we parted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI returned to the hotel, and went up into my room, and thought over it\r\nvery anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe serious obstacle of the signature on the marriage register still\r\nstood in my way as unmanageably as ever. All hope of getting assistance\r\nfrom Mrs. Oldershaw was at an end. I could only regard her henceforth\r\nas an enemy hidden in the dark--the enemy, beyond all doubt now, who\r\nhad had me followed and watched when I was last in London. To what other\r\ncounselor could I turn for the advice which my unlucky ignorance of\r\nlaw and business obliged me to seek from some one more experienced than\r\nmyself? Could I go to the lawyer whom I consulted when I was about to\r\nmarry Midwinter in my maiden name? Impossible! To say nothing of his\r\ncold reception of me when I had last seen him, the advice I wanted this\r\ntime related (disguise the facts as I might) to commission of a Fraud--a\r\nfraud of the sort that no prosperous lawyer would consent to assist if\r\nhe had a character to lose. Was there any other competent person I\r\ncould think of? There was one, and one only--the doctor who had died at\r\nPimlico, and had revived again at Hampstead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew him to be entirely without scruples; to have the business\r\nexperience that I wanted myself; and to be as cunning, as clever, and\r\nas far-seeing a man as could be found in all London. Beyond this, I had\r\nmade two important discoveries in connection with him that morning. In\r\nthe first place, he was on bad terms with Mrs. Oldershaw, which would\r\nprotect me from all danger of the two leaguing together against me if\r\nI trusted him. In the second place, circumstances still obliged him to\r\nkeep his identity carefully disguised, which gave me a hold over him in\r\nno respect inferior to any hold that _I_ might give him over _me_. In\r\nevery way he was the right man, the only man, for my purpose; and yet I\r\nhesitated at going to him--hesitated for a full hour and more, without\r\nknowing why!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was two o\xe2\x80\x99clock before I finally decided on paying the doctor a\r\nvisit. Having, after this, occupied nearly another hour in determining\r\nto a hair-breadth how far I should take him into my confidence, I\r\nsent for a cab at last, and set off toward three in the afternoon for\r\nHampstead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found the Sanitarium with some little difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFairweather Vale proved to be a new neighborhood, situated below the\r\nhigh ground of Hampstead, on the southern side. The day was overcast,\r\nand the place looked very dreary. We approached it by a new road running\r\nbetween trees, which might once have been the park avenue of a country\r\nhouse. At the end we came upon a wilderness of open ground, with\r\nhalf-finished villas dotted about, and a hideous litter of boards,\r\nwheelbarrows, and building materials of all sorts scattered in every\r\ndirection. At one corner of this scene of desolation, stood a great\r\novergrown dismal house, plastered with drab-colored stucco, and\r\nsurrounded by a naked, unfinished garden, without a shrub or a flower\r\nin it, frightful to behold. On the open iron gate that led into this\r\ninclosure was a new brass plate, with \xe2\x80\x98Sanitarium\xe2\x80\x99 inscribed on it in\r\ngreat black letters. The bell, when the cabman rang it, pealed through\r\nthe empty house like a knell; and the pallid, withered old man-servant\r\nin black who answered the door looked as if he had stepped up out of his\r\ngrave to perform that service. He let out on me a smell of damp plaster\r\nand new varnish; and he let in with me a chilling draft of the damp\r\nNovember air. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice it at the time, but, writing of it now, I\r\nremember that I shivered as I crossed the threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave my name to the servant as \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x99 and was shown into\r\nthe waiting-room. The very fire itself was dying of damp in the grate.\r\nThe only books on the table were the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Works, in sober drab\r\ncovers; and the only object that ornamented the walls was the foreign\r\nDiploma (handsomely framed and glazed), of which the doctor had\r\npossessed himself by purchase, along with the foreign name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a moment or two, the proprietor of the Sanitarium came in, and\r\nheld up his hands in cheerful astonishment at the sight of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t an idea who \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x9d was!\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98My dear lady,\r\nhave _you_ changed your name too? How sly of you not to tell me when\r\nwe met this morning! Come into my private snuggery--I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of\r\nkeeping an old and dear friend like you in the patients\xe2\x80\x99 waiting-room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s private snuggery was at the back of the house, looking\r\nout on fields and trees, doomed but not yet destroyed by the builder.\r\nHorrible objects in brass and leather and glass, twisted and turned as\r\nif they were sentient things writhing in agonies of pain, filled up one\r\nend of the room. A great book-case with glass doors extended over the\r\nwhole of the opposite wall, and exhibited on its shelves long rows of\r\nglass jars, in which shapeless dead creatures of a dull white color\r\nfloated in yellow liquid. Above the fireplace hung a collection of\r\nphotographic portraits of men and women, inclosed in two large frames\r\nhanging side by side with a space between them. The left-hand frame\r\nillustrated the effects of nervous suffering as seen in the face; the\r\nright-hand frame exhibited the ravages of insanity from the same\r\npoint of view; while the space between was occupied by an elegantly\r\nilluminated scroll, bearing inscribed on it the time-honored motto,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Prevention is better than Cure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Here I am, with my galvanic apparatus, and my preserved specimens,\r\nand all the rest of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, placing me in a chair by the\r\nfireside. \xe2\x80\x98And there is my System mutely addressing you just above\r\nyour head, under a form of exposition which I venture to describe as\r\nfrankness itself. This is no mad-house, my dear lady. Let other men\r\ntreat insanity, if they like--_I_ stop it! No patients in the house as\r\nyet. But we live in an age when nervous derangement (parent of insanity)\r\nis steadily on the increase; and in due time the sufferers will come. I\r\ncan wait as Harvey waited, as Jenner waited. And now do put your feet up\r\non the fender, and tell me about yourself. You are married, of\r\ncourse? And what a pretty name! Accept my best and most heart-felt\r\ncongratulations. You have the two greatest blessings that can fall to a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s lot; the two capital H\xe2\x80\x99s, as I call them--Husband and Home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI interrupted the genial flow of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s congratulations at the\r\nfirst opportunity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I am married; but the circumstances are by no means of the ordinary\r\nkind,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, seriously. My present position includes none of the\r\nblessings that are usually supposed to fall to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s lot. I am\r\nalready in a situation of very serious difficulty; and before long I may\r\nbe in a situation of very serious danger as well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor drew his chair a little nearer to me, and fell at once into\r\nhis old professional manner and his old confidential tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If you wish to consult me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, softly, \xe2\x80\x98you know that I have\r\nkept some dangerous secrets in my time, and you also know that I possess\r\ntwo valuable qualities as an adviser. I am not easily shocked; and I can\r\nbe implicitly trusted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hesitated even now, at the eleventh hour, sitting alone with him\r\nin his own room. It was so strange to me to be trusting to anybody\r\nbut myself! And yet, how could I help trusting another person in a\r\ndifficulty which turned on a matter of law?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Just as you please, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 added the doctor. \xe2\x80\x98I never invite\r\nconfidences. I merely receive them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no help for it; I had come there not to hesitate, but to\r\nspeak. I risked it, and spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The matter on which I wish to consult you,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98is not (as you\r\nseem to think) within your experience as a professional man. But I\r\nbelieve you may be of assistance to me, if I trust myself to your larger\r\nexperience as a man of the world. I warn you beforehand that I shall\r\ncertainly surprise, and possibly alarm, you before I have done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith that preface I entered on my story, telling him what I had settled\r\nto tell him, and no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made no secret, at the outset, of my intention to personate\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow; and I mentioned without reserve (knowing that the\r\ndoctor could go to the office and examine the will for himself) the\r\nhandsome income that would be settled on me in the event of my success.\r\nSome of the circumstances that followed next in succession I thought it\r\ndesirable to alter or conceal. I showed him the newspaper account of the\r\nloss of the yacht, but I said nothing about events at Naples. I informed\r\nhim of the exact similarity of the two names; leaving him to imagine\r\nthat it was accidental. I told him, as an important element in the\r\nmatter, that my husband had kept his real name a profound secret from\r\neverybody but myself; but (to prevent any communication between them)\r\nI carefully concealed from the doctor what the assumed name under which\r\nMidwinter had lived all his life really was. I acknowledged that I had\r\nleft my husband behind me on the Continent; but when the doctor put the\r\nquestion, I allowed him to conclude--I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, with all my resolution,\r\ntell him positively!--that Midwinter knew of the contemplated Fraud, and\r\nthat he was staying away purposely, so as not to compromise me by his\r\npresence. This difficulty smoothed over--or, as I feel it now, this\r\nbaseness committed--I reverted to myself, and came back again to the\r\ntruth. One after another I mentioned all the circumstances connected\r\nwith my private marriage, and with the movements of Armadale and\r\nMidwinter, which rendered any discovery of the false personation\r\n(through the evidence of other people) a downright impossibility. \xe2\x80\x98So\r\nmuch,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, in conclusion, \xe2\x80\x98for the object in view. The next thing is\r\nto tell you plainly of a very serious obstacle that stands in my way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor, who had listened thus far without interrupting me, begged\r\npermission here to say a few words on his side before I went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98few words\xe2\x80\x99 proved to be all questions--clever, searching,\r\nsuspicious questions--which I was, however, able to answer with little\r\nor no reserve, for they related, in almost every instance, to the\r\ncircumstances under which I had been married, and to the chances for and\r\nagainst my lawful husband if he chose to assert his claim to me at any\r\nfuture time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy replies informed the doctor, in the first place, that I had so\r\nmanaged matters at Thorpe Ambrose as to produce a general impression\r\nthat Armadale intended to marry me; in the second place, that my\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s early life had not been of a kind to exhibit him favorably\r\nin the eyes of the world; in the third place, that we had been married,\r\nwithout any witnesses present who knew us, at a large parish church\r\nin which two other couples had been married the same morning, to\r\nsay nothing of the dozens on dozens of other couples (confusing all\r\nremembrance of us in the minds of the officiating people) who had\r\nbeen married since. When I had put the doctor in possession of these\r\nfacts--and when he had further ascertained that Midwinter and I had gone\r\nabroad among strangers immediately after leaving the church; and that\r\nthe men employed on board the yacht in which Armadale had sailed from\r\nSomersetshire (before my marriage) were now away in ships voyaging to\r\nthe other end of the world--his confidence in my prospects showed itself\r\nplainly in his face. \xe2\x80\x98So far as I can see,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98your husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclaim to you (after you have stepped into the place of the dead Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow) would rest on nothing but his own bare assertion.\r\nAnd _that_ I think you may safely set at defiance. Excuse my apparent\r\ndistrust of the gentleman. But there might be a misunderstanding between\r\nyou in the future, and it is highly desirable to ascertain beforehand\r\nexactly what he could or could not do under those circumstances. And now\r\nthat we have done with the main obstacle that _I_ see in the way of your\r\nsuccess, let us by all means come to the obstacle that _you_ see next!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was willing enough to come to it. The tone in which he spoke\r\nof Midwinter, though I myself was responsible for it, jarred on me\r\nhorribly, and roused for the moment some of the old folly of feeling\r\nwhich I fancied I had laid asleep forever. I rushed at the chance of\r\nchanging the subject, and mentioned the discrepancy in the register\r\nbetween the hand in which Midwinter had signed the name of Allan\r\nArmadale, and the hand in which Armadale of Thorpe Ambrose had been\r\naccustomed to write his name, with an eagerness which it quite diverted\r\nthe doctor to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Is _that_ all?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, to my infinite surprise and relief, when\r\nI had done. \xe2\x80\x98My dear lady, pray set your mind at ease! If the late Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers want a proof of your marriage, they won\xe2\x80\x99t go to the\r\nchurch-register for it, I can promise you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 I exclaimed, in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x98Do you mean to say that the\r\nentry in the register is not a proof of my marriage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is a proof,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x98that you have been married to\r\nsomebody. But it is no proof that you have been married to Mr. Armadale\r\nof Thorpe Ambrose. Jack Nokes or Tom Styles (excuse the homeliness of\r\nthe illustration!) might have got the license, and gone to the church to\r\nbe married to you under Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s name; and the register (how\r\ncould it do otherwise?) must in that case have innocently assisted the\r\ndeception. I see I surprise you. My dear madam, when you opened this\r\ninteresting business you surprised _me_--I may own it now--by laying so\r\nmuch stress on the curious similarity between the two names. You might\r\nhave entered on the very daring and romantic enterprise in which you\r\nare now engaged, without necessarily marrying your present husband. Any\r\nother man would have done just as well, provided he was willing to take\r\nMr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s name for the purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt my temper going at this. \xe2\x80\x98Any other man would _not_ have done\r\njust as well,\xe2\x80\x99 I rejoined, instantly. \xe2\x80\x98But for the similarity of the\r\nnames, I should never have thought of the enterprise at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor admitted that he had spoken too hastily. \xe2\x80\x98That personal view\r\nof the subject had, I confess, escaped me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98However, let us\r\nget back to the matter in hand. In the course of what I may term an\r\nadventurous medical life, I have been brought more than once into\r\ncontact with the gentlemen of the law, and have had opportunities\r\nof observing their proceedings in cases of, let us say, Domestic\r\nJurisprudence. I am quite sure I am correct in informing you that the\r\nproof which will be required by Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s representatives will be\r\nthe evidence of a witness present at the marriage who can speak to the\r\nidentity of the bride and bridegroom from his own personal knowledge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But I have already told you,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98that there was no such person\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Precisely,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the doctor. \xe2\x80\x98In that case, what you now want,\r\nbefore you can safely stir a step in the matter, is--if you will pardon\r\nme the expression--a ready-made witness, possessed of rare moral\r\nand personal resources, who can be trusted to assume the necessary\r\ncharacter, and to make the necessary Declaration before a magistrate. Do\r\nyou know of any such person?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the doctor, throwing himself back in\r\nhis chair, and looking at me with the utmost innocence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I only know you,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor laughed softly. \xe2\x80\x98So like a woman!\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked, with the\r\nmost exasperating good humor. \xe2\x80\x98The moment she sees her object, she\r\ndashes at it headlong the nearest way. Oh, the sex! the sex!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Never mind the sex!\xe2\x80\x99 I broke out, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x98I want a serious\r\nanswer--Yes or No?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor rose, and waved his hand with great gravity and dignity all\r\nround the room. \xe2\x80\x98You see this vast establishment,\xe2\x80\x99 he began; \xe2\x80\x98you\r\ncan possibly estimate to some extent the immense stake I have in its\r\nprosperity and success. Your excellent natural sense will tell you that\r\nthe Principal of this Sanitarium must be a man of the most unblemished\r\ncharacter--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why waste so many words,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98when one word will do? You mean\r\nNo!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Principal of the Sanitarium suddenly relapsed into the character of\r\nmy confidential friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My dear lady,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Yes, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t No, at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotice. Give me till to-morrow afternoon. By that time I engage to\r\nbe ready to do one of two things--either to withdraw myself from this\r\nbusiness at once, or to go into it with you heart and soul. Do you agree\r\nto that? Very good; we may drop the subject, then, till to-morrow. Where\r\ncan I call on you when I have decided what to do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no objection to my trusting him with my address at the hotel.\r\nI had taken care to present myself there as \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99; and I had\r\ngiven Midwinter an address at the neighboring post-office to write to\r\nwhen he answered my letters. We settled the hour at which the doctor was\r\nto call on me; and, that matter arranged, I rose to go, resisting all\r\noffers of refreshment, and all proposals to show me over the house. His\r\nsmooth persistence in keeping up appearances after we had thoroughly\r\nunderstood each other disgusted me. I got away from him as soon as I\r\ncould, and came back to my diary and my own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see how it ends to-morrow. My own idea is that my confidential\r\nfriend will say Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 24th.--The doctor has said Yes, as I supposed; but on terms\r\nwhich I never anticipated. The condition on which I have secured his\r\nservices amounts to nothing less than the payment to him, on my stepping\r\ninto the place of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow, of half my first year\xe2\x80\x99s income--in\r\nother words, six hundred pounds!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI protested against this extortionate demand in every way I could\r\nthink of. All to no purpose. The doctor met me with the most engaging\r\nfrankness. Nothing, he said, but the accidental embarrassment of his\r\nposition at the present time would have induced him to mix himself up in\r\nthe matter at all. He would honestly confess that he had exhausted his\r\nown resources, and the resources of other persons whom he described as\r\nhis \xe2\x80\x98backers,\xe2\x80\x99 in the purchase and completion of the Sanitarium. Under\r\nthose circumstances, six hundred pounds in prospect was an object\r\nto him. For that sum he would run the serious risk of advising and\r\nassisting me. Not a farthing less would tempt him; and there he left it,\r\nwith his best and friendliest wishes, in my hands!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ended in the only way in which it could end. I had no choice but to\r\naccept the terms, and to let the doctor settle things on the spot as he\r\npleased. The arrangement once made between us, I must do him the justice\r\nto say that he showed no disposition to let the grass grow under his\r\nfeet. He called briskly for pen, ink and paper, and suggested opening\r\nthe campaign at Thorpe Ambrose by to-night\xe2\x80\x99s post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe agreed on a form of letter which I wrote, and which he copied on the\r\nspot. I entered into no particulars at starting. I simply asserted that\r\nI was the widow of the deceased Mr. Armadale; that I had been privately\r\nmarried to him; that I had returned to England on his sailing in the\r\nyacht from Naples; and that I begged to inclose a copy of my marriage\r\ncertificate, as a matter of form with which I presumed it was customary\r\nto comply. The letter was addressed to \xe2\x80\x98The Representatives of the late\r\nAllan Armadale, Esq., Thorpe Ambrose, Norfolk.\xe2\x80\x99 And the doctor himself\r\ncarried it away, and put it in the post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so excited and so impatient for results as I expected to be,\r\nnow that the first step is taken. The thought of Midwinter haunts me\r\nlike a ghost. I have been writing to him again--as before, to keep\r\nup appearances. It will be my last letter, I think. My courage feels\r\nshaken, my spirits get depressed, when my thoughts go back to Turin.\r\nI am no more capable of facing the consideration of Midwinter at this\r\nmoment than I was in the by-gone time, The day of reckoning with him,\r\nonce distant and doubtful, is a day that may come to me now, I know\r\nnot how soon. And here I am, trusting myself blindly to the chapter of\r\nAccidents still!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 25th.--At two o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-day the doctor called again by\r\nappointment. He has been to his lawyers (of course without taking them\r\ninto our confidence) to put the case simply of proving my marriage.\r\nThe result confirms what he has already told me. The pivot on which the\r\nwhole matter will turn, if my claim is disputed, will be the question\r\nof identity; and it may be necessary for the witness to make his\r\nDeclaration in the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s presence before the week is out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this position of affairs, the doctor thinks it important that we\r\nshould be within easy reach of each other, and proposes to find a quiet\r\nlodging for me in his neighborhood. I am quite willing to go anywhere;\r\nfor, among the other strange fancies that have got possession of me, I\r\nhave an idea that I shall feel more completely lost to Midwinter if I\r\nmove out of the neighborhood in which his letters are addressed to me.\r\nI was awake and thinking of him again last night. This morning I have\r\nfinally decided to write to him no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter staying half an hour, the doctor left me, having first inquired\r\nwhether I would like to accompany him to Hampstead to look for lodgings.\r\nI informed him that I had some business of my own which would keep me\r\nin London. He inquired what the business was. \xe2\x80\x98You will see,\xe2\x80\x99 I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98to-morrow or next day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a moment\xe2\x80\x99s nervous trembling when I was by myself again. My\r\nbusiness in London, besides being a serious business in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\ntook my mind back to Midwinter in spite of me. The prospect of removing\r\nto my new lodging had reminded me of the necessity of dressing in my new\r\ncharacter. The time had come now for getting _my widow\xe2\x80\x99s weeds_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first proceeding, after putting my bonnet on, was to provide myself\r\nwith money. I got what I wanted to fit me out for the character of\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow by nothing less than the sale of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s own present\r\nto me on my marriage--the ruby ring! It proved to be a more valuable\r\njewel than I had supposed. I am likely to be spared all money anxieties\r\nfor some time to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn leaving the jeweler\xe2\x80\x99s, I went to the great mourning shop in Regent\r\nStreet. In four-and-twenty hours (if I can give them no more) they\r\nhave engaged to dress me in my widow\xe2\x80\x99s costume from head to foot. I had\r\nanother feverish moment when I left the shop; and, by way of further\r\nexcitement on this agitating day, I found a surprise in store for me on\r\nmy return to the hotel. An elderly gentleman was announced to be waiting\r\nto see me. I opened my sitting-room door, and there was old Bashwood!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had got my letter that morning, and had started for London by the\r\nnext train to answer it in person. I had expected a great deal from\r\nhim, but I had certainly not expected _that_. It flattered me. For the\r\nmoment, I declare it flattered me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pass over the wretched old creature\xe2\x80\x99s raptures and reproaches, and\r\ngroans and tears, and weary long prosings about the lonely months he\r\nhad passed at Thorpe Ambrose, brooding over my desertion of him. He\r\nwas quite eloquent at times; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want his eloquence here. It\r\nis needless to say that I put myself right with him, and consulted his\r\nfeelings before I asked him for his news. What a blessing a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvanity is sometimes! I almost forgot my risks and responsibilities in\r\nmy anxieties to be charming. For a minute or two I felt a warm little\r\nflutter of triumph. And it was a triumph--even with an old man! In\r\na quarter of an hour I had him smirking and smiling, hanging on my\r\nlightest words in an ecstasy, and answering all the questions I put to\r\nhim like a good little child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is his account of affairs at Thorpe Ambrose, as I gently extracted\r\nit from him bit by bit:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, the news of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s death has reached Miss\r\nMilroy. It has so completely overwhelmed her that her father has been\r\ncompelled to remove her from the school. She is back at the cottage,\r\nand the doctor is in daily attendance. Do I pity her? Yes! I pity her\r\nexactly as much as she once pitied me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the next place, the state of affairs at the great house, which I\r\nexpected to find some difficulty in comprehending, turns out to be quite\r\nintelligible, and certainly not discouraging so far. Only yesterday, the\r\nlawyers on both sides came to an understanding. Mr. Darch (the family\r\nsolicitor of the Blanchards, and Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s bitter enemy in past times)\r\nrepresents the interests of Miss Blanchard, who (in the absence of any\r\nmale heir) is next heir to the estate, and who has, it appears, been in\r\nLondon for some time past. Mr. Smart, of Norwich (originally employed to\r\noverlook Bashwood), represents the deceased Armadale. And this is what\r\nthe two lawyers have settled between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Darch, acting for Miss Blanchard, has claimed the possession of the\r\nestate, and the right of receiving the rents at the Christmas audit,\r\nin her name. Mr. Smart, on his side, has admitted that there is great\r\nweight in the family solicitor\xe2\x80\x99s application. He cannot see his way, as\r\nthings are now, to contesting the question of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s death, and he\r\nwill consent to offer no resistance to the application, if Mr. Darch\r\nwill consent, on his side, to assume the responsibility of taking\r\npossession in Miss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s name. This Mr. Darch has already done;\r\nand the estate is now virtually in Miss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s possession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne result of this course of proceeding will be (as Bashwood thinks)\r\nto put Mr. Darch in the position of the person who really decides on\r\nmy claim to the widow\xe2\x80\x99s place and the widow\xe2\x80\x99s money. The income being\r\ncharged on the estate, it must come out of Miss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s pocket; and\r\nthe question of paying it would appear, therefore, to be a question for\r\nMiss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer. To-morrow will probably decide whether this\r\nview is the right one, for my letter to Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s representatives will\r\nhave been delivered at the great house this morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much for what old Bashwood had to tell me. Having recovered my\r\ninfluence over him, and possessed myself of all his information so\r\nfar, the next thing to consider was the right use to turn him to in the\r\nfuture. He was entirely at my disposal, for his place at the steward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice has been already taken by Miss Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s man of business, and\r\nhe pleaded hard to be allowed to stay and serve my interests in London.\r\nThere would not have been the least danger in letting him stay, for I\r\nhad, as a matter of course, left him undisturbed in his conviction\r\nthat I really am the widow of Armadale of Thorpe Ambrose. But with the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s resources at my command, I wanted no assistance of any sort in\r\nLondon; and it occurred to me that I might make Bashwood more useful by\r\nsending him back to Norfolk to watch events there in my interests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looked sorely disappointed (having had an eye evidently to paying\r\nhis court to me in my widowed condition!) when I told him of the\r\nconclusion at which I had arrived. But a few words of persuasion, and\r\na modest hint that he might cherish hopes in the future if he served\r\nme obediently in the present, did wonders in reconciling him to the\r\nnecessity of meeting my wishes. He asked helplessly for \xe2\x80\x98instructions\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhen it was time for him to leave me and travel back by the evening\r\ntrain. I could give him none, for I had no idea as yet of what the\r\nlegal people might or might not do. \xe2\x80\x98But suppose something happens,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\npersisted, \xe2\x80\x98that I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, what am I to do, so far away from\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99 I could only give him one answer. \xe2\x80\x98Do nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98Whatever\r\nit is, hold your tongue about it, and write, or come up to London\r\nimmediately to consult me.\xe2\x80\x99 With those parting directions, and with an\r\nunderstanding that we were to correspond regularly, I let him kiss my\r\nhand, and sent him off to the train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that I am alone again, and able to think calmly of the interview\r\nbetween me and my elderly admirer, I find myself recalling a certain\r\nchange in old Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s manner which puzzled me at the time, and which\r\npuzzles me still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven in his first moments of agitation at seeing me, I thought that his\r\neyes rested on my face with a new kind of interest while I was speaking\r\nto him. Besides this, he dropped a word or two afterward, in telling me\r\nof his lonely life at Thorpe Ambrose, which seemed to imply that he\r\nhad been sustained in his solitude by a feeling of confidence about his\r\nfuture relations with me when we next met. If he had been a younger and\r\na bolder man (and if any such discovery had been possible), I should\r\nalmost have suspected him of having found out something about my past\r\nlife which had made him privately confident of controlling me, if I\r\nshowed any disposition to deceive and desert him again. But such an idea\r\nas this in connection with old Bashwood is simply absurd. Perhaps I am\r\noverexcited by the suspense and anxiety of my present position? Perhaps\r\nthe merest fancies and suspicions are leading me astray? Let this be as\r\nit may, I have, at any rate, more serious subjects than the subject\r\nof old Bashwood to occupy me now. Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s post may tell me what\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s representatives think of the claim of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 26th.--The answer has arrived this morning, in the form (as\r\nBashwood supposed) of a letter from Mr. Darch. The crabbed old lawyer\r\nacknowledges my letter in three lines. Before he takes any steps, or\r\nexpresses any opinion on the subject, he wants evidence of identity as\r\nwell as the evidence of the certificate; and he ventures to suggest that\r\nit may be desirable, before we go any further, to refer him to my legal\r\nadvisers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock.--The doctor called shortly after twelve to say that he had\r\nfound a lodging for me within twenty minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk of the Sanitarium. In\r\nreturn for his news, I showed him Mr. Darch\xe2\x80\x99s letter. He took it away at\r\nonce to his lawyers, and came back with the necessary information for\r\nmy guidance. I have answered Mr. Darch by sending him the address of\r\nmy legal advisers--otherwise, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers--without making any\r\ncomment on the desire that he has expressed for additional evidence of\r\nthe marriage. This is all that can be done to-day. To-morrow will bring\r\nwith it events of greater interest, for to-morrow the doctor is to make\r\nhis Declaration before the magistrate, and to-morrow I am to move to my\r\nnew lodging in my widow\xe2\x80\x99s weeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 27th.--Fairweather Vale Villas.--The Declaration has been\r\nmade, with all the necessary formalities. And I have taken possession,\r\nin my widow\xe2\x80\x99s costume, of my new rooms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to be excited by the opening of this new act in the drama, and\r\nby the venturesome part that I am playing in it myself. Strange to say,\r\nI am quiet and depressed. The thought of Midwinter has followed me to my\r\nnew abode, and is pressing on me heavily at this moment. I have no fear\r\nof any accident happening, in the interval that must still pass before\r\nI step publicly into the place of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow. But when that time\r\ncomes, and when Midwinter finds me (as sooner or later find me he must!)\r\nfiguring in my false character, and settled in the position that I have\r\nusurped--_then_, I ask myself, What will happen? The answer still comes\r\nas it first came to me this morning, when I put on my widow\xe2\x80\x99s dress.\r\nNow, as then, the presentiment is fixed in my mind that he will kill me.\r\nIf it was not too late to draw back--Absurd! I shall shut up my journal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovember 28th.--The lawyers have heard from Mr. Darch, and have sent\r\nhim the Declaration by return of post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the doctor brought me this news, I asked him whether his lawyers\r\nwere aware of my present address; and, finding that he had not yet\r\nmentioned it to them, I begged that he would continue to keep it a\r\nsecret for the future. The doctor laughed. \xe2\x80\x98Are you afraid of Mr.\r\nDarch\xe2\x80\x99s stealing a march on us, and coming to attack you personally?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe asked. I accepted the imputation, as the easiest way of making him\r\ncomply with my request. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98I am afraid of Mr. Darch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy spirits have risen since the doctor left me. There is a pleasant\r\nsensation of security in feeling that no strangers are in possession of\r\nmy address. I am easy enough in my mind to-day to notice how wonderfully\r\nwell I look in my widow\xe2\x80\x99s weeds, and to make myself agreeable to the\r\npeople of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMidwinter disturbed me a little again last night; but I have got over\r\nthe ghastly delusion which possessed me yesterday. I know better now\r\nthan to dread violence from him when he discovers what I have done. And\r\nthere is still less fear of his stooping to assert his claim to a woman\r\nwho has practiced on him such a deception as mine. The one serious trial\r\nthat I shall be put to when the day of reckoning comes will be the trial\r\nof preserving my false character in his presence. I shall be safe in his\r\nloathing and contempt for me, after that. On the day when I have denied\r\nhim to his face, I shall have seen the last of him forever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I be able to deny him to his face? Shall I be able to look at him\r\nand speak to him as if he had never been more to me than a friend? How\r\ndo I know till the time comes? Was there ever such an infatuated fool\r\nas I am, to be writing of him at all, when writing only encourages me\r\nto think of him? I will make a new resolution. From this time forth, his\r\nname shall appear no more in these pages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonday, December 1st.--The last month of the worn-out old year 1851! If\r\nI allowed myself to look back, what a miserable year I should see added\r\nto all the other miserable years that are gone! But I have made my\r\nresolution to look forward only, and I mean to keep it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to record of the last two days, except that on the\r\ntwenty-ninth I remembered Bashwood, and wrote to tell him of my new\r\naddress. This morning the lawyers heard again from Mr. Darch. He\r\nacknowledges the receipt of the Declaration, but postpones stating the\r\ndecision at which he has arrived until he has communicated with the\r\ntrustees under the late Mr. Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s will, and has received his\r\nfinal instructions from his client, Miss Blanchard. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers\r\ndeclare that this last letter is a mere device for gaining time--with\r\nwhat object they are, of course, not in a position to guess. The doctor\r\nhimself says, facetiously, it is the usual lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s object of making a\r\nlong bill. My own idea is that Mr. Darch has his suspicions of something\r\nwrong, and that his purpose in trying to gain time--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen, at night.--I had written as far as that last unfinished sentence\r\n(toward four in the afternoon) when I was startled by hearing a cab\r\ndrive up to the door. I went to the window, and got there just in time\r\nto see old Bashwood getting out with an activity of which I should never\r\nhave supposed him capable. So little did I anticipate the tremendous\r\ndiscovery that was going to burst on me in another minute, that I turned\r\nto the glass, and wondered what the susceptible old gentleman would say\r\nto me in my widow\xe2\x80\x99s cap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe instant he entered the room, I saw that some serious disaster had\r\nhappened. His eyes were wild, his wig was awry. He approached me with a\r\nstrange mixture of eagerness and dismay. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve done as you told me,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe whispered, breathlessly. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve held my tongue about it, and come\r\nstraight to _you_!\xe2\x80\x99 He caught me by the hand before I could speak, with\r\na boldness quite new in my experience of him. \xe2\x80\x98Oh how can I break it to\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x99 he burst out. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m beside myself when I think of it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98When you _can_ speak,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, putting him into a chair, \xe2\x80\x98speak out.\r\nI see in your face that you bring me news I don\xe2\x80\x99t look for from Thorpe\r\nAmbrose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe put his hand into the breast-pocket of his coat, and drew out a\r\nletter. He looked at the letter, and looked at me. \xe2\x80\x98New--new--news you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t look for,\xe2\x80\x99 he stammered; \xe2\x80\x98but not from Thorpe Ambrose!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Not from Thorpe Ambrose!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No. From the sea!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first dawning of the truth broke on me at those words. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspeak--I could only hold out my hand to him for the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe still shrank from giving it to me. \xe2\x80\x98I daren\xe2\x80\x99t! I daren\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 he said\r\nto himself, vacantly. \xe2\x80\x98The shock of it might be the death of her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI snatched the letter from him. One glance at the writing on the\r\naddress was enough. My hands fell on my lap, with the letter fast held\r\nin them. I sat petrified, without moving, without speaking, without\r\nhearing a word of what Bashwood was saying to me, and slowly realized\r\nthe terrible truth. The man whose widow I had claimed to be was a living\r\nman to confront me! In vain I had mixed the drink at Naples--in vain I\r\nhad betrayed him into Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Twice I had set the deadly snare\r\nfor him, and twice Armadale had escaped me! I came to my sense of\r\noutward things again, and found Bashwood on his knees at my feet,\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You look angry,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured, helplessly. \xe2\x80\x98Are you angry with _me_?\r\nOh, if you only knew what hopes I had when we last saw each other, and\r\nhow cruelly that letter has dashed them all to the ground!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put the miserable old creature back from me, but very gently. \xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI said. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t distress me now. I want composure; I want to read the\r\nletter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went away submissively to the other end of the room. As soon as my\r\neye was off him, I heard him say to himself, with impotent malignity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If the sea had been of my mind, the sea would have drowned him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne by one I slowly opened the folds of the letter; feeling, while I\r\ndid so, the strangest incapability of fixing my attention on the very\r\nlines that I was burning to read. But why dwell any longer on sensations\r\nwhich I can\xe2\x80\x99t describe? It will be more to the purpose if I place the\r\nletter itself, for future reference, on this page of my journal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Fiume, Illyria, November 21, 1851.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMR. BASHWOOD--The address I date from will surprise you; and you will\r\nbe more surprised still when you hear how it is that I come to write to\r\nyou from a port on the Adriatic Sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been the victim of a rascally attempt at robbery and murder. The\r\nrobbery has succeeded; and it is only through the mercy of God that the\r\nmurder did not succeed too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hired a yacht rather more than a month ago at Naples; and sailed\r\n(I am glad to think now) without any friend with me, for Messina. From\r\nMessina I went for a cruise in the Adriatic. Two days out we were caught\r\nin a storm. Storms get up in a hurry, and go down in a hurry, in those\r\nparts. The vessel behaved nobly: I declare I feel the tears in my eyes\r\nnow, when I think of her at the bottom of the sea! Toward sunset it\r\nbegan to moderate; and by midnight, except for a long, smooth swell, the\r\nsea was as quiet as need be. I went below, a little tired (having helped\r\nin working the yacht while the gale lasted), and fell asleep in five\r\nminutes. About two hours after, I was woke by something falling into my\r\ncabin through a chink of the ventilator in the upper part of the door.\r\nI jumped up, and found a bit of paper with a key wrapped in it, and with\r\nwriting on the inner side, in a hand which it was not very easy to read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp to this time I had not had the ghost of a suspicion that I was alone\r\nat sea with a gang of murderous vagabonds (excepting one only) who would\r\nstick at nothing. I had got on very well with my sailing-master (the\r\nworst scoundrel of the lot), and better still with his English mate.\r\nThe sailors, being all foreigners, I had very little to say to. They did\r\ntheir work, and no quarrels and nothing unpleasant happened. If anybody\r\nhad told me, before I went to bed on the night after the storm, that the\r\nsailing-master and the crew and the mate (who had been no better than\r\nthe rest of them at starting) were all in a conspiracy to rob me of the\r\nmoney I had on board, and then to drown me in my own vessel afterward, I\r\nshould have laughed in his face. Just remember that; and then fancy for\r\nyourself (for I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you) what I must have thought when\r\nI opened the paper round the key, and read what I now copy (from the\r\nmate\xe2\x80\x99s writing), as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98SIR--Stay in your bed till you hear a boat shove off from the\r\nstarboard side, or you are a dead man. Your money is stolen; and in five\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x99 time the yacht will be scuttled, and the cabin hatch will be\r\nnailed down on you. Dead men tell no tales; and the sailing-master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotion is to leave proofs afloat that the vessel has foundered with\r\nall on board. It was his doing, to begin with, and we were all in it. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t find it in my heart not to give you a chance for your life. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na bad chance, but I can do no more. I should be murdered myself if I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to go with the rest. The key of your cabin door is thrown\r\nback to you, inside this. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed when you hear the hammer\r\nabove. I shall do it, and I shall have short nails in my hand as well as\r\nlong, and use the short ones only. Wait till you hear the boat with all\r\nof us shove off, and then pry up the cabin hatch with your back. The\r\nvessel will float a quarter of an hour after the holes are bored in her.\r\nSlip into the sea on the port side, and keep the vessel between you\r\nand the boat. You will find plenty of loose lumber, wrenched away on\r\npurpose, drifting about to hold on by. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fine night and a smooth\r\nsea, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance that a ship may pick you up while there\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\nleft in you. I can do no more.--Yours truly, J. M.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I came to those last words, I heard the hammering down of the hatch\r\nover my head. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m more of a coward than most people, but\r\nthere was a moment when the sweat poured down me like rain. I got to\r\nbe my own man again before the hammering was done, and found myself\r\nthinking of somebody very dear to me in England. I said to myself:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a try for my life, for her sake, though the chances are dead\r\nagainst me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put a letter from that person I have mentioned into one of the\r\nstoppered bottles of my dressing-case, along with the mate\xe2\x80\x99s warning, in\r\ncase I lived to see him again. I hung this, and a flask of whisky, in a\r\nsling round my neck; and, after first dressing myself in my confusion,\r\nthought better of it, and stripped, again, for swimming, to my shirt and\r\ndrawers. By the time I had done that the hammering was over and there\r\nwas such a silence that I could hear the water bubbling into the\r\nscuttled vessel amidships. The next noise was the noise of the boat and\r\nthe villains in her (always excepting my friend, the mate) shoving off\r\nfrom the starboard side. I waited for the splash of the oars in the\r\nwater, and then got my back under the hatch. The mate had kept his\r\npromise. I lifted it easily--crept across the deck, under cover of the\r\nbulwarks, on all fours--and slipped into the sea on the port side.\r\nLots of things were floating about. I took the first thing I came to--a\r\nhen-coop--and swam away with it about a couple of hundred yards, keeping\r\nthe yacht between me and the boat. Having got that distance, I was\r\nseized with a shivering fit, and I stopped (fearing the cramp next) to\r\ntake a pull at my flask. When I had closed the flask again, I turned\r\nfor a moment to look back, and saw the yacht in the act of sinking. In a\r\nminute more there was nothing between me and the boat but the pieces of\r\nwreck that had been purposely thrown out to float. The moon was shining;\r\nand, if they had had a glass in the boat, I believe they might have seen\r\nmy head, though I carefully kept the hen-coop between me and them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs it was, they laid on their oars; and I heard loud voices among them\r\ndisputing. After what seemed an age to me, I discovered what the dispute\r\nwas about. The boat\xe2\x80\x99s head was suddenly turned my way. Some cleverer\r\nscoundrel than the rest (the sailing-master, I dare say) had evidently\r\npersuaded them to row back over the place where the yacht had gone down,\r\nand make quite sure that I had gone down with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were more than half-way across the distance that separated us, and\r\nI had given myself up for lost, when I heard a cry from one of them, and\r\nsaw the boat\xe2\x80\x99s progress suddenly checked. In a minute or two more the\r\nboat\xe2\x80\x99s head was turned again; and they rowed straight away from me like\r\nmen rowing for their lives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked on one side toward the land, and saw nothing. I looked on the\r\nother toward the sea, and discovered what the boat\xe2\x80\x99s crew had discovered\r\nbefore me--a sail in the distance, growing steadily brighter and bigger\r\nin the moonlight the longer I looked at it. In a quarter of an hour more\r\nthe vessel was within hail of me, and the crew had got me on board.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were all foreigners, and they quite deafened me by their jabber.\r\nI tried signs, but before I could make them understand me I was seized\r\nwith another shivering fit, and was carried below. The vessel held on\r\nher course, I have no doubt, but I was in no condition to know anything\r\nabout it. Before morning I was in a fever; and from that time I can\r\nremember nothing clearly till I came to my senses at this place, and\r\nfound myself under the care of a Hungarian merchant, the consignee (as\r\nthey call it) of the coasting vessel that had picked me up. He speaks\r\nEnglish as well or better than I do; and he has treated me with a\r\nkindness which I can find no words to praise. When he was a young man\r\nhe was in England himself, learning business, and he says he has\r\nremembrances of our country which make his heart warm toward an\r\nEnglishman. He has fitted me out with clothes, and has lent me the\r\nmoney to travel with, as soon as the doctor allows me to start for home.\r\nSupposing I don\xe2\x80\x99t get a relapse, I shall be fit to travel in a week\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime from this. If I can catch the mail at Trieste, and stand the\r\nfatigue, I shall be back again at Thorpe Ambrose in a week or ten days\r\nat most after you get my letter. You will agree with me that it is a\r\nterribly long letter. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t help that. I seem to have lost my old\r\nknack at putting things short, and finishing on the first page. However,\r\nI am near the end now; for I have nothing left to mention but the reason\r\nwhy I write about what has happened to me, instead of waiting till I get\r\nhome, and telling it all by word of mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy my head is still muddled by my illness. At any rate, it only\r\nstruck me this morning that there is barely a chance of some vessel\r\nhaving passed the place where the yacht foundered, and having picked up\r\nthe furniture, and other things wrenched out of her and left to float.\r\nSome false report of my being drowned may, in that case, have reached\r\nEngland. If this has happened (which I hope to God may be an unfounded\r\nfear on my part), go directly to Major Milroy at the cottage. Show\r\nhim this letter--I have written it quite as much for his eye as for\r\nyours--and then give him the inclosed note, and ask him if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink the circumstances justify me in hoping he will send it to Miss\r\nMilroy. I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain why I don\xe2\x80\x99t write directly to the major, or to\r\nMiss Milroy, instead of to you. I can only say there are considerations\r\nI am bound in honor to respect, which oblige me to act in this\r\nroundabout way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to answer this, for I shall be on my way home, I hope,\r\nlong before your letter could reach me in this out-of-the-way place.\r\nWhatever you do, don\xe2\x80\x99t lose a moment in going to Major Milroy. Go, on\r\nsecond thoughts, whether the loss of the yacht is known in England or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours truly, ALLAN ARMADALE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked up when I had come to the end of the letter, and saw, for\r\nthe first time, that Bashwood had left his chair and had placed himself\r\nopposite to me. He was intently studying my face, with the inquiring\r\nexpression of a man who was trying to read my thoughts. His eyes fell\r\nguiltily when they met mine, and he shrank away to his chair. Believing,\r\nas he did, that I was really married to Armadale, was he trying to\r\ndiscover whether the news of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s rescue from the sea was good\r\nnews or bad news in my estimation? It was no time then for entering into\r\nexplanations with him. The first thing to be done was to communicate\r\ninstantly with the doctor. I called Bashwood back to me and gave him my\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You have done me a service,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98which makes us closer friends\r\nthan ever. I shall say more about this, and about other matters of some\r\ninterest to both of us, later in the day. I want you now to lend me Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s letter (which I promise to bring back) and to wait here till\r\nI return. Will you do that for me, Mr. Bashwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would do anything I asked him, he said. I went into the bedroom and\r\nput on my bonnet and shawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Let me be quite sure of the facts before I leave you,\xe2\x80\x99 I resumed, when\r\nI was ready to go out. \xe2\x80\x98You have not shown this letter to anybody but\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Not a living soul has seen it but our two selves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What have you done with the note inclosed to Miss Milroy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe produced it from his pocket. I ran it over rapidly--saw that there\r\nwas nothing in it of the slightest importance--and put it in the fire\r\non the spot. That done, I left Bashwood in the sitting-room, and went to\r\nthe Sanitarium, with Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s letter in my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor had gone out, and the servant was unable to say positively\r\nat what time he would be back. I went into his study, and wrote a line\r\npreparing him for the news I had brought with me, which I sealed up,\r\nwith Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s letter, in an envelope, to await his return. Having told\r\nthe servant I would call again in an hour, I left the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was useless to go back to my lodgings and speak to Bashwood, until I\r\nknew first what the doctor meant to do. I walked about the neighborhood,\r\nup and down new streets and crescents and squares, with a kind of dull,\r\nnumbed feeling in me, which prevented, not only all voluntary exercise\r\nof thought, but all sensation of bodily fatigue. I remembered the same\r\nfeeling overpowering me, years ago, on the morning when the people of\r\nthe prison came to take me into court to be tried for my life. All that\r\nfrightful scene came back again to my mind in the strangest manner, as\r\nif it had been a scene in which some other person had figured. Once or\r\ntwice I wondered, in a heavy, senseless way, why they had not hanged me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I went back to the Sanitarium, I was informed that the doctor had\r\nreturned half an hour since, and that he was in his own room anxiously\r\nwaiting to see me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went into the study, and found him sitting close by the fire with\r\nhis head down and his hands on his knees. On the table near him, beside\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s letter and my note, I saw, in the little circle of light\r\nthrown by the reading-lamp, an open railway guide. Was he meditating\r\nflight? It was impossible to tell from his face, when he looked up at\r\nme, what he was meditating, or how the shock had struck him when he\r\nfirst discovered that Armadale was a living man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Take a seat near the fire,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s very raw and cold to-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took a chair in silence. In silence, on his side, the doctor sat\r\nrubbing his knees before the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Have you nothing to say to me?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe rose, and suddenly removed the shade from the reading-lamp, so that\r\nthe light fell on my face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You are not looking well,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My head feels dull, and my eyes are heavy and hot,\xe2\x80\x99 I replied. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nweather, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was strange how we both got further and further from the one vitally\r\nimportant subject which we had both come together to discuss!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I think a cup of tea would do you good,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accepted his suggestion; and he ordered the tea. While it was coming,\r\nhe walked up and down the room, and I sat by the fire, and not a word\r\npassed between us on either side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tea revived me; and the doctor noticed a change for the better in\r\nmy face. He sat down opposite to me at the table, and spoke out at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If I had ten thousand pounds at this moment,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, \xe2\x80\x98I would\r\ngive the whole of it never to have compromised myself in your desperate\r\nspeculation on Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s death!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said those words with an abruptness, almost with a violence, which\r\nwas strangely uncharacteristic of his ordinary manner. Was he frightened\r\nhimself, or was he trying to frighten me? I determined to make him\r\nexplain himself at the outset, so far as I was concerned. \xe2\x80\x98Wait a\r\nmoment, doctor,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98Do you hold me responsible for what has\r\nhappened?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, stiffly. \xe2\x80\x98Neither you nor anybody could\r\nhave foreseen what has happened. When I say I would give ten thousand\r\npounds to be out of this business, I am blaming nobody but myself.\r\nAnd when I tell you next that I, for one, won\xe2\x80\x99t allow Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresurrection from the sea to be the ruin of me without a fight for it,\r\nI tell you, my dear madam, one of the plainest truths I ever told to man\r\nor woman in the whole course of my life. Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I am invidiously\r\nseparating my interests from yours in the common danger that now\r\nthreatens us both. I simply indicate the difference in the risk that we\r\nhave respectively run. _You_ have not sunk the whole of your resources\r\nin establishing a Sanitarium; and _you_ have not made a false\r\ndeclaration before a magistrate, which is punishable as perjury by the\r\nlaw.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI interrupted him again. His selfishness did me more good than his tea:\r\nit roused my temper effectually. \xe2\x80\x98Suppose we let your risk and my risk\r\nalone, and come to the point,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by making a\r\nfight for it? I see a railway guide on your table. Does making a fight\r\nfor it mean--running away?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Running away?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the doctor. \xe2\x80\x98You appear to forget that every\r\nfarthing I have in the world is embarked in this establishment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You stop here, then?\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Unquestionably!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And what do you mean to do when Mr. Armadale comes to England?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA solitary fly, the last of his race whom the winter had spared, was\r\nbuzzing feebly about the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s face. He caught it before he answered\r\nme, and held it out across the table in his closed hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If this fly\xe2\x80\x99s name was Armadale,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and if you had got him as\r\nI have got him now, what would _you_ do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis eyes, fixed on my face up to this time, turned significantly, as he\r\nended this question, to my widow\xe2\x80\x99s dress. I, too, looked at it when\r\nhe looked. A thrill of the old deadly hatred and the old deadly\r\ndetermination ran through me again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I should kill him,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor started to his feet (with the fly still in his hand), and\r\nlooked at me--a little too theatrically--with an expression of the\r\nutmost horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Kill him!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the doctor, in a paroxysm of virtuous alarm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Violence--murderous violence--in My Sanitarium! You take my breath\r\naway!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI caught his eye while he was expressing himself in this elaborately\r\nindignant manner, scrutinizing me with a searching curiosity which was,\r\nto say the least of it, a little at variance with the vehemence of his\r\nlanguage and the warmth of his tone. He laughed uneasily when our eyes\r\nmet, and recovered his smoothly confidential manner in the instant that\r\nelapsed before he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I beg a thousand pardons,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98I ought to have known better\r\nthan to take a lady too literally at her word. Permit me to remind you,\r\nhowever, that the circumstances are too serious for anything in the\r\nnature of--let us say, an exaggeration or a joke. You shall hear what I\r\npropose, without further preface.\xe2\x80\x99 He paused, and resumed his figurative\r\nuse of the fly imprisoned in his hand. \xe2\x80\x98Here is Mr. Armadale. I can let\r\nhim out, or keep him in, just as I please--and he knows it. I say to\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the doctor, facetiously addressing the fly, \xe2\x80\x98Give me\r\nproper security, Mr. Armadale, that no proceedings of any sort shall be\r\ntaken against either this lady or myself, and I will let you out of the\r\nhollow of my hand. Refuse--and, be the risk what it may, I will keep you\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d Can you doubt, my dear madam, what Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s answer is, sooner\r\nor later, certain to be? Can you doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, suiting the\r\naction to the word, and letting the fly go, \xe2\x80\x98that it will end to the\r\nentire satisfaction of all parties, in this way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t say at present,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered, \xe2\x80\x98whether I doubt or not. Let\r\nme make sure that I understand you first. You propose, if I am not\r\nmistaken, to shut the doors of this place on Mr. Armadale, and not\r\nto let him out again until he has agreed to the terms which it is our\r\ninterest to impose on him? May I ask, in that case, how you mean to make\r\nhim walk into the trap that you have set for him here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I propose,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, with his hand on the railway guide,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ascertaining first at what time during every evening of this month the\r\ntidal trains from Dover and Folkestone reach the London Bridge terminus.\r\nAnd I propose, next, posting a person whom Mr. Armadale knows, and whom\r\nyou and I can trust, to wait the arrival of the trains, and to meet our\r\nman at the moment when he steps out of the railway carriage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Have you thought,\xe2\x80\x99 I inquired, \xe2\x80\x98of who the person is to be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I have thought,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, taking up Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s letter \xe2\x80\x98of the\r\nperson to whom this letter is addressed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe answer startled me. Was it possible that he and Bashwood knew one\r\nanother? I put the question immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Until to-day I never so much as heard of the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe doctor. \xe2\x80\x98I have simply pursued the inductive process of reasoning,\r\nfor which we are indebted to the immortal Bacon. How does this very\r\nimportant letter come into your possession? I can\xe2\x80\x99t insult you by\r\nsupposing it to have been stolen. Consequently, it has come to you\r\nwith the leave and license of the person to whom it is addressed.\r\nConsequently, that person is in your confidence. Consequently, he is\r\nthe first person I think of. You see the process? Very good. Permit me\r\na question or two, on the subject of Mr. Bashwood, before we go on any\r\nfurther.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s questions went as straight to the point as usual. My\r\nanswers informed him that Mr. Bashwood stood toward Armadale in the\r\nrelation of steward; that he had received the letter at Thorpe Ambrose\r\nthat morning, and had brought it straight to me by the first train; that\r\nhe had not shown it, or spoken of it before leaving, to Major Milroy or\r\nto any one else; that I had not obtained this service at his hands by\r\ntrusting him with my secret; that I had communicated with him in the\r\ncharacter of Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s widow; that he had suppressed the letter, under\r\nthose circumstances, solely in obedience to a general caution I had\r\ngiven him to keep his own counsel, if anything strange happened at\r\nThorpe Ambrose, until he had first consulted me; and, lastly, that the\r\nreason why he had done as I told him in this matter, was that in this\r\nmatter, and in all others, Mr. Bashwood was blindly devoted to my\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt that point in the interrogatory, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes began to look at\r\nme distrustfully behind the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s spectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What is the secret of this blind devotion of Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s to your\r\ninterests?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hesitated for a moment--in pity to Bashwood, not in pity to myself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you must know,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bashwood is in love with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ay! ay!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the doctor, with an air of relief. \xe2\x80\x98I begin to\r\nunderstand now. Is he a young man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He is an old man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor laid himself back in his chair, and chuckled softly. \xe2\x80\x98Better\r\nand better!\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Here is the very man we want. Who so fit as Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s steward to meet Mr. Armadale on his return to London? And who\r\nso capable of influencing Mr. Bashwood in the proper way as the charming\r\nobject of Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s admiration?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere could be no doubt that Bashwood was the man to serve the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npurpose, and that my influence was to be trusted to make him serve\r\nit. The difficulty was not here: the difficulty was in the unanswered\r\nquestion that I had put to the doctor a minute since. I put it to him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Suppose Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s steward meets his employer at the terminus,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x98May I ask once more how Mr. Armadale is to be persuaded to come\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t think me ungallant,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined the doctor in his gentlest manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98if I ask, on my side, how are men persuaded to do nine-tenths of the\r\nfoolish acts of their lives? They are persuaded by your charming sex.\r\nThe weak side of every man is the woman\xe2\x80\x99s side of him. We have only\r\nto discover the woman\xe2\x80\x99s side of Mr. Armadale--to tickle him on it\r\ngently--and to lead him our way with a silken string. I observe here,\xe2\x80\x99\r\npursued the doctor, opening Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s letter, \xe2\x80\x98a reference to a certain\r\nyoung lady, which looks promising. Where is the note that Mr. Armadale\r\nspeaks of as addressed to Miss Milroy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of answering him, I started, in a sudden burst of excitement,\r\nto my feet. The instant he mentioned Miss Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s name all that I had\r\nheard from Bashwood of her illness, and of the cause of it, rushed back\r\ninto my memory. I saw the means of decoying Armadale into the Sanitarium\r\nas plainly as I saw the doctor on the other side of the table, wondering\r\nat the extraordinary change in me. What a luxury it was to make Miss\r\nMilroy serve my interests at last!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Never mind the note,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s burned, for fear of accidents.\r\nI can tell you all (and more) than the note could have told you. Miss\r\nMilroy cuts the knot! Miss Milroy ends the difficulty! She is privately\r\nengaged to him. She has heard the false report of his death; and she has\r\nbeen seriously ill at Thorpe Ambrose ever since. When Bashwood meets him\r\nat the station, the very first question he is certain to ask--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I see!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the doctor, anticipating me. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bashwood has\r\nnothing to do but to help the truth with a touch of fiction. When he\r\ntells his master that the false report has reached Miss Milroy, he has\r\nonly to add that the shock has affected her head, and that she is\r\nhere under medical care. Perfect! perfect! We shall have him at the\r\nSanitarium as fast as the fastest cab-horse in London can bring him to\r\nus. And mind! no risk--no necessity for trusting other people. This\r\nis not a mad-house; this is not a licensed establishment; no doctors\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncertificates are necessary here! My dear lady, I congratulate you; I\r\ncongratulate myself. Permit me to hand you the railway guide, with my\r\nbest compliments to Mr. Bashwood, and with the page turned down for him,\r\nas an additional attention, at the right place.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemembering how long I had kept Bashwood waiting for me, I took\r\nthe book at once, and wished the doctor good-evening without further\r\nceremony. As he politely opened the door for me, he reverted, without\r\nthe slightest necessity for doing so, and without a word from me to lead\r\nto it, to the outburst of virtuous alarm which had escaped him at the\r\nearlier part of our interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I do hope,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98that you will kindly forget and forgive my\r\nextraordinary want of tact and perception when--in short, when I caught\r\nthe fly. I positively blush at my own stupidity in putting a literal\r\ninterpretation on a lady\xe2\x80\x99s little joke! Violence in My Sanitarium!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexclaimed the doctor, with his eyes once more fixed attentively on my\r\nface--\xe2\x80\x98violence in this enlightened nineteenth century! Was there ever\r\nanything so ridiculous? Do fasten your cloak before you go out, it is so\r\ncold and raw! Shall I escort you? Shall I send my servant? Ah, you were\r\nalways independent! always, if I may say so, a host in yourself! May\r\nI call to-morrow morning, and hear what you have settled with Mr.\r\nBashwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said yes, and got away from him at last. In a quarter of an hour more\r\nI was back at my lodgings, and was informed by the servant that \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nelderly gentleman\xe2\x80\x99 was still waiting for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not got the heart or the patience--I hardly know which--to waste\r\nmany words on what passed between me and Bashwood. It was so easy, so\r\ndegradingly easy, to pull the strings of the poor old puppet in any\r\nway I pleased! I met none of the difficulties which I should have\r\nbeen obliged to meet in the case of a younger man, or of a man less\r\ninfatuated with admiration for me. I left the allusions to Miss Milroy\r\nin Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s letter, which had naturally puzzled him, to be explained\r\nat a future time. I never even troubled myself to invent a plausible\r\nreason for wishing him to meet Armadale at the terminus, and to entrap\r\nhim by a stratagem into the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Sanitarium. All that I found it\r\nnecessary to do was to refer to what I had written to Mr. Bashwood, on\r\nmy arrival in London, and to what I had afterward said to him, when he\r\ncame to answer my letter personally at the hotel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You know already,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98that my marriage has not been a happy\r\none. Draw your own conclusions from that; and don\xe2\x80\x99t press me to tell you\r\nwhether the news of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s rescue from the sea is, or is not,\r\nthe welcome news that it ought to be to his wife!\xe2\x80\x99 That was enough to\r\nput his withered old face in a glow, and to set his withered old hopes\r\ngrowing again. I had only to add, \xe2\x80\x98If you will do what I ask you to do,\r\nno matter how incomprehensible and how mysterious my request may seem\r\nto be; and if you will accept my assurances that you shall run no risk\r\nyourself, and that you shall receive the proper explanations at the\r\nproper time, you will have such a claim on my gratitude and my regard as\r\nno man living has ever had yet!\xe2\x80\x99 I had only to say those words, and to\r\npoint them by a look and a stolen pressure of his hand, and I had him at\r\nmy feet, blindly eager to obey me. If he could have seen what I thought\r\nof myself; but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter: he saw nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHours have passed since I sent him away (pledged to secrecy, possessed\r\nof his instructions, and provided with his time-table) to the hotel\r\nnear the terminus, at which he is to stay till Armadale appears on the\r\nrailway platform. The excitement of the earlier part of the evening has\r\nall worn off; and the dull, numbed sensation has got me again. Are my\r\nenergies wearing out, I wonder, just at the time when I most want them?\r\nOr is some foreshadowing of disaster creeping over me which I don\xe2\x80\x99t yet\r\nunderstand?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might be in a humor to sit here for some time longer, thinking\r\nthoughts like these, and letting them find their way into words at their\r\nown will and pleasure, if my Diary would only let me. But my idle pen\r\nhas been busy enough to make its way to the end of the volume. I have\r\nreached the last morsel of space left on the last page; and whether I\r\nlike it or not, I must close the book this time for good and all, when I\r\nclose it to-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, my old friend and companion of many a miserable day! Having\r\nnothing else to be fond of, I half suspect myself of having been\r\nunreasonably fond of _you_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE FOURTH BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE LAST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. AT THE TERMINUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 2d of December, Mr. Bashwood took up his post of\r\nobservation at the terminus of the South-eastern Railway for the first\r\ntime. It was an earlier date, by six days, than the date which Allan\r\nhad himself fixed for his return. But the doctor, taking counsel of his\r\nmedical experience, had considered it just probable that \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale\r\nmight be perverse enough, at his enviable age, to recover sooner than\r\nhis medical advisers might have anticipated.\xe2\x80\x9d For caution\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\ntherefore, Mr. Bashwood was instructed to begin watching the arrival of\r\nthe tidal trains on the day after he had received his employer\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\nFrom the 2d to the 7th of December, the steward waited punctually on the\r\nplatform, saw the trains come in, and satisfied himself, evening after\r\nevening, that the travelers were all strangers to him. From the 2d to\r\nthe 7th of December, Miss Gwilt (to return to the name under which\r\nshe is best known in these pages) received his daily report, sometimes\r\ndelivered personally, sometimes sent by letter. The doctor, to whom\r\nthe reports were communicated, received them in his turn with unabated\r\nconfidence in the precautions that had been adopted up to the morning of\r\nthe 8th. On that date the irritation of continued suspense had produced\r\na change for the worse in Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s variable temper, which was\r\nperceptible to every one about her, and which, strangely enough, was\r\nreflected by an equally marked change in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s manner when he\r\ncame to pay his usual visit. By a coincidence so extraordinary that his\r\nenemies might have suspected it of not being a coincidence at all, the\r\nmorning on which Miss Gwilt lost her patience proved to be also the\r\nmorning on which the doctor lost his confidence for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo news, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sitting down with a heavy sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cWell!\r\nwell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gwilt looked up at him irritably from her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem strangely depressed this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you\r\nafraid of now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe imputation of being afraid, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the doctor, solemnly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis not an imputation to cast rashly on any man--even when he belongs to\r\nsuch an essentially peaceful profession as mine. I am not afraid. I\r\nam (as you more correctly put it in the first instance) strangely\r\ndepressed. My nature is, as you know, naturally sanguine, and I only see\r\nto-day what but for my habitual hopefulness I might have seen, and ought\r\nto have seen, a week since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gwilt impatiently threw down her work. \xe2\x80\x9cIf words cost money,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cthe luxury of talking would be rather an expensive luxury in your\r\ncase!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I might have seen, and ought to have seen,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated the\r\ndoctor, without taking the slightest notice of the interruption, \xe2\x80\x9ca week\r\nsince. To put it plainly, I feel by no means so certain as I did that\r\nMr. Armadale will consent, without a struggle, to the terms which it is\r\nmy interest (and in a minor degree yours) to impose on him. Observe! I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t question our entrapping him successfully into the Sanitarium: I\r\nonly doubt whether he will prove quite as manageable as I originally\r\nanticipated when we have got him there. Say,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the doctor,\r\nraising his eyes for the first time, and fixing them in steady inquiry\r\non Miss Gwilt--\xe2\x80\x9csay that he is bold, obstinate, what you please; and\r\nthat he holds out--holds out for weeks together, for months together, as\r\nmen in similar situations to his have held out before him. What follows?\r\nThe risk of keeping him forcibly in concealment--of suppressing him,\r\nif I may so express myself--increases at compound interest, and becomes\r\nEnormous! My house is at this moment virtually ready for patients.\r\nPatients may present themselves in a week\xe2\x80\x99s time. Patients may\r\ncommunicate with Mr. Armadale, or Mr. Armadale may communicate with\r\npatients. A note may be smuggled out of the house, and may reach the\r\nCommissioners in Lunacy. Even in the case of an unlicensed establishment\r\nlike mine, those gentlemen--no! those chartered despots in a land of\r\nliberty--have only to apply to the Lord Chancellor for an order, and to\r\nenter (by heavens, to enter My Sanitarium!) and search the house from\r\ntop to bottom at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice! I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to despond; I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwish to alarm you; I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to say that the means we are taking\r\nto secure your own safety are any other than the best means at our\r\ndisposal. All I ask you to do is to imagine the Commissioners in\r\nthe house--and then to conceive the consequences. The consequences!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n repeated the doctor, getting sternly on his feet, and taking up his hat\r\nas if he meant to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything more to say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any remarks,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cto offer on your side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood, hat in hand, waiting. For a full minute the two looked at each\r\nother in silence.\r\n\r\nMiss Gwilt spoke first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, suddenly recovering her composure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the doctor, with his hand to his ear.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you happened to catch another fly this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gwilt,\r\nwith a bitterly sarcastic emphasis on the words, \xe2\x80\x9cI might be capable of\r\nshocking you by another \xe2\x80\x98little joke.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor held up both hands, in polite deprecation, and looked as if\r\nhe was beginning to recover his good humor again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, gently, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to have forgiven me that unlucky\r\nblunder of mine, even yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else have you to say? I am waiting for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gwilt. She\r\nturned her chair to the window scornfully, and took up her work again,\r\nas she spoke.\r\n\r\nThe doctor came behind her, and put his hand on the back of her chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a question to ask, in the first place,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand a measure\r\nof necessary precaution to suggest, in the second. If you will honor me\r\nwith your attention, I will put the question first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am listening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that Mr. Armadale is alive,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nknow that he is coming back to England. Why do you continue to wear your\r\nwidow\xe2\x80\x99s dress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered him without an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, steadily going on with\r\nher work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am of a sanguine disposition, like you. I mean to trust to\r\nthe chapter of accidents to the very last. Mr. Armadale may die yet, on\r\nhis way home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd suppose he gets home alive--what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there is another chance still left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may die in your Sanitarium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam!\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the doctor, in the deep bass which he reserved for\r\nhis outbursts of virtuous indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cWait! you spoke of the chapter\r\nof accidents,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, gliding back into his softer conversational\r\ntones. \xe2\x80\x9cYes! yes! of course. I understand you this time. Even the\r\nhealing art is at the mercy of accidents; even such a Sanitarium as mine\r\nis liable to be surprised by Death. Just so! just so!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor,\r\nconceding the question with the utmost impartiality. \xe2\x80\x9cThere _is_ the\r\nchapter of accidents, I admit--if you choose to trust to it.\r\nMind! I say emphatically, _if_ you choose to trust to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another moment of silence--silence so profound that nothing\r\nwas audible in the room but the rapid _click_ of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s needle\r\nthrough her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou haven\xe2\x80\x99t done yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cHaving put my question, I have my measure of\r\nprecaution to impress on you next. You will see, my dear madam, that\r\nI am not disposed to trust to the chapter of accidents on my side.\r\nReflection has convinced me that you and I are not (logically speaking)\r\nso conveniently situated as we might be in case of emergency. Cabs\r\nare, as yet, rare in this rapidly improving neighborhood. I am twenty\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk from you; you are twenty minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk from me. I know\r\nnothing of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s character; you know it well. It might be\r\nnecessary--vitally necessary--to appeal to your superior knowledge of\r\nhim at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. And how am I to do that unless we are within\r\neasy reach of each other, under the same roof? In both our interests,\r\nI beg to invite you, my dear madam, to become for a limited period an\r\ninmate of My Sanitarium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s rapid needle suddenly stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nagain, as quietly as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, with another attack of deafness,\r\nand with his hand once more at his ear.\r\n\r\nShe laughed to herself--a low, terrible laugh, which startled even the\r\ndoctor into taking his hand off the back of her chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn inmate of your Sanitarium?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou consult appearances\r\nin everything else; do you propose to consult appearances in receiving\r\nme into your house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost assuredly!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, with enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cI am surprised\r\nat your asking me the question! Did you ever know a man of any eminence\r\nin my profession who set appearances at defiance? If you honor me\r\nby accepting my invitation, you enter My Sanitarium in the most\r\nunimpeachable of all possible characters--in the character of a\r\nPatient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you want my answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you decide to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Have you anything more to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me, then. _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t keep up appearances. I wish to be alone, and\r\nI say so. Good-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the sex! the sex!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, with his excellent temper in\r\nperfect working order again. \xe2\x80\x9cSo delightfully impulsive! so charmingly\r\nreckless of what they say or how they say it! \xe2\x80\x98Oh, woman, in our hours\r\nof ease, uncertain, coy, and hard to please!\xe2\x80\x99 There! there! there!\r\nGood-morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gwilt rose and looked after him contemptuously from the window,\r\nwhen the street door had closed, and he had left the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale himself drove me to it the first time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cManuel\r\ndrove me to it the second time.--You cowardly scoundrel! shall I let\r\n_you_ drive me to it for the third time, and the last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned from the window, and looked thoughtfully at her widow\xe2\x80\x99s dress\r\nin the glass.\r\n\r\nThe hours of the day passed--and she decided nothing. The night\r\ncame--and she hesitated still. The new morning dawned--and the terrible\r\nquestion was still unanswered.\r\n\r\nBy the early post there came a letter for her. It was Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nusual report. Again he had watched for Allan\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, and again in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have more time!\xe2\x80\x9d she determined, passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cNo man alive shall\r\nhurry me faster than I like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt breakfast that morning (the morning of the 9th) the doctor was\r\nsurprised in his study by a visit from Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want another day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, the moment the servant had closed the\r\ndoor on her.\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at her before he answered, and saw the danger of\r\ndriving her to extremities plainly expressed in her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time is getting on,\xe2\x80\x9d he remonstrated, in his most persuasive\r\nmanner. \xe2\x80\x9cFor all we know to the contrary, Mr. Armadale may be here\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want another day!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, loudly and passionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranted!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, looking nervously toward the door. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ntoo loud--the servants may hear you. Mind!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI depend on your\r\nhonor not to press me for any further delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better depend on my despair,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and left him.\r\n\r\nThe doctor chipped the shell of his egg, and laughed softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember where your despair led\r\nyou in past times; and I think I may trust it to lead you the same way\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt a quarter to eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock that night Mr. Bashwood took up his post\r\nof observation, as usual, on the platform of the terminus at London\r\nBridge. He was in the highest good spirits; he smiled and smirked in\r\nirrepressible exultation. The sense that he held in reserve a means\r\nof influence over Miss Gwilt, in virtue of his knowledge of her past\r\ncareer, had had no share in effecting the transformation that now\r\nappeared in him. It had upheld his courage in his forlorn life at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose, and it had given him that increased confidence of manner\r\nwhich Miss Gwilt herself had noticed; but, from the moment when he had\r\nregained his old place in her favor, it had vanished as a motive power\r\nin him, annihilated by the electric shock of her touch and her look.\r\nHis vanity--the vanity which in men at his age is only despair in\r\ndisguise--had now lifted him to the seventh heaven of fatuous happiness\r\nonce more. He believed in her again as he believed in the smart new\r\nwinter overcoat that he wore--as he believed in the dainty little cane\r\n(appropriate to the dawning dandyism of lads in their teens) that he\r\nflourished in his hand. He hummed! The worn-out old creature, who had\r\nnot sung since his childhood, hummed, as he paced the platform, the few\r\nfragments he could remember of a worn-out old song.\r\n\r\nThe train was due as early as eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock that night. At five minutes\r\npast the hour the whistle sounded. In less than five minutes more the\r\npassengers were getting out on the platform.\r\n\r\nFollowing the instructions that had been given to him, Mr. Bashwood\r\nmade his way, as well as the crowd would let him, along the line\r\nof carriages, and, discovering no familiar face on that first\r\ninvestigation, joined the passengers for a second search among them in\r\nthe custom-house waiting-room next.\r\n\r\nHe had looked round the room, and had satisfied himself that the persons\r\noccupying it were all strangers, when he heard a voice behind him,\r\nexclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cCan that be Mr. Bashwood!\xe2\x80\x9d He turned in eager expectation,\r\nand found himself face to face with the last man under heaven whom he\r\nhad expected to see.\r\n\r\nThe man was MIDWINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. IN THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoticing Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s confusion (after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s glance at the change\r\nin his personal appearance), Midwinter spoke first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see I have surprised you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are looking, I suppose, for\r\nsomebody else? Have you heard from Allan? Is he on his way home again\r\nalready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe inquiry about Allan, though it would naturally have suggested\r\nitself to any one in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s position at that moment, added to Mr.\r\nBashwood\xe2\x80\x99s confusion. Not knowing how else to extricate himself from\r\nthe critical position in which he was placed, he took refuge in simple\r\ndenial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about Mr. Armadale--oh dear, no, sir, I know nothing\r\nabout Mr. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with needless eagerness and hurry.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome back to England, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, changing the subject in his\r\nnervously talkative manner. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you had been abroad. It\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nlong since we have had the pleasure--since I have had the pleasure. Have\r\nyou enjoyed yourself, sir, in foreign parts? Such different manners from\r\nours--yes, yes, yes--such different manners from ours! Do you make a\r\nlong stay in England, now you have come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been obliged to alter my plans,\r\nand to come to England unexpectedly.\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated a little; his manner\r\nchanged, and he added, in lower tones: \xe2\x80\x9cA serious anxiety has brought\r\nme back. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say what my plans will be until that anxiety is set at\r\nrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe light of a lamp fell on his face while he spoke, and Mr. Bashwood\r\nobserved, for the first time, that he looked sadly worn and changed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, sir--I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry. If I could be of any use--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n suggested Mr. Bashwood, speaking under the influence in some degree of\r\nhis nervous politeness, and in some degree of his remembrance of what\r\nMidwinter had done for him at Thorpe Ambrose in the by-gone time.\r\n\r\nMidwinter thanked him and turned away sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you can be of\r\nno use, Mr. Bashwood--but I am obliged to you for your offer, all the\r\nsame.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, and considered a little, \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose she should _not_ be\r\nill? Suppose some misfortune should have happened?\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, speaking\r\nto himself, and turning again toward the steward. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she has left\r\nher mother, some trace of her _might_ be found by inquiring at Thorpe\r\nAmbrose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity was instantly aroused. The whole sex was\r\ninteresting to him now, for the sake of Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you looking for a lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am looking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, simply, \xe2\x80\x9cfor my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Bashwood. \xe2\x80\x9cMarried since I last had the\r\npleasure of seeing you! Might I take the liberty of asking--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter\xe2\x80\x99s eyes dropped uneasily to the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew the lady in former times,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have married Miss\r\nGwilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe steward started back as he might have started back from a loaded\r\npistol leveled at his head. His eyes glared as if he had suddenly lost\r\nhis senses, and the nervous trembling to which he was subject shook him\r\nfrom head to foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter. There was no answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there\r\nso very startling,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, a little impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cin Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeing my wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Your_ wife?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Bashwood, helplessly. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Armadale--!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nchecked himself by a desperate effort, and said no more.\r\n\r\nThe stupor of astonishment which possessed the steward was instantly\r\nreflected in Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s face. The name in which he had secretly married\r\nhis wife had passed the lips of the last man in the world whom he would\r\nhave dreamed of admitting into his confidence! He took Mr. Bashwood by\r\nthe arm, and led him away to a quieter part of the terminus than the\r\npart of it in which they had hitherto spoken to each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou referred to my wife just now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand you spoke of _Mrs.\r\nArmadale_ in the same breath. What do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain there was no answer. Utterly incapable of understanding more than\r\nthat he had involved himself in some serious complication which was a\r\ncomplete mystery to him, Mr. Bashwood struggled to extricate himself\r\nfrom the grasp that was laid on him, and struggled in vain.\r\n\r\nMidwinter sternly repeated the question. \xe2\x80\x9cI ask you again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you mean by it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, sir! I give you my word of honor, I meant nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d He felt\r\nthe hand on his arm tightening its grasp; he saw, even in the obscurity\r\nof the remote corner in which they stood, that Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s fiery temper\r\nwas rising, and was not to be trifled with. The extremity of his danger\r\ninspired him with the one ready capacity that a timid man possesses when\r\nhe is compelled by main force to face an emergency--the capacity to lie.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only meant to say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out, with a desperate effort to\r\nlook and speak confidently, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Armadale would be surprised--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said _Mrs._ Armadale!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir--on my word of honor, on my sacred word of honor, you are\r\nmistaken--you are, indeed! I said _Mr._ Armadale--how could I say\r\nanything else? Please to let me go, sir--I\xe2\x80\x99m pressed for time. I do\r\nassure you I\xe2\x80\x99m dreadfully pressed for time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment longer Midwinter maintained his hold, and in that moment he\r\ndecided what to do.\r\n\r\nHe had accurately stated his motive for returning to England as\r\nproceeding from anxiety about his wife--anxiety naturally caused (after\r\nthe regular receipt of a letter from her every other, or every third\r\nday) by the sudden cessation of the correspondence between them on her\r\nside for a whole week. The first vaguely terrible suspicion of some\r\nother reason for her silence than the reason of accident or of illness,\r\nto which he had hitherto attributed it, had struck through him like\r\na sudden chill the instant he heard the steward associate the name of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x9d with the idea of his wife. Little irregularities in her\r\ncorrespondence with him, which he had thus far only thought strange,\r\nnow came back on his mind, and proclaimed themselves to be suspicions as\r\nwell. He had hitherto believed the reasons she had given for referring\r\nhim, when he answered her letters, to no more definite address than\r\nan address at a post-office. _Now_ he suspected her reasons of being\r\nexcuses, for the first time. He had hitherto resolved, on reaching\r\nLondon, to inquire at the only place he knew of at which a clew to her\r\ncould be found--the address she had given him as the address at which\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cher mother\xe2\x80\x9d lived. _Now_ (with a motive which he was afraid to define\r\neven to himself, but which was strong enough to overbear every other\r\nconsideration in his mind) he determined, before all things, to solve\r\nthe mystery of Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s familiarity with a secret, which was a\r\nmarriage secret between himself and his wife. Any direct appeal to a man\r\nof the steward\xe2\x80\x99s disposition, in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s present state of mind,\r\nwould be evidently useless. The weapon of deception was, in this case,\r\na weapon literally forced into Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s hands. He let go of Mr.\r\nBashwood\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and accepted Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt you are right. Pray\r\nattribute my rudeness to over-anxiety and over-fatigue. I wish you\r\ngood-evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe station was by this time almost a solitude, the passengers by\r\nthe train being assembled at the examination of their luggage in the\r\ncustom-house waiting-room. It was no easy matter, ostensibly to take\r\nleave of Mr. Bashwood, and really to keep him in view. But Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nearly life with the gypsy master had been of a nature to practice him in\r\nsuch stratagems as he was now compelled to adopt. He walked away toward\r\nthe waiting-room by the line of empty carriages; opened the door of\r\none of them, as if to look after something that he had left behind, and\r\ndetected Mr. Bashwood making for the cab-rank on the opposite side\r\nof the platform. In an instant Midwinter had crossed, and had passed\r\nthrough the long row of vehicles, so as to skirt it on the side furthest\r\nfrom the platform. He entered the second cab by the left-hand door the\r\nmoment after Mr. Bashwood had entered the first cab by the right-hand\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cDouble your fare, whatever it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the driver, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\nkeep the cab before you in view, and follow it wherever it goes.\xe2\x80\x9d In a\r\nminute more both vehicles were on their way out of the station.\r\n\r\nThe clerk sat in the sentry-box at the gate, taking down the\r\ndestinations of the cabs as they passed. Midwinter heard the man who was\r\ndriving him call out \xe2\x80\x9cHampstead!\xe2\x80\x9d as he went by the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you say \xe2\x80\x98Hampstead\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, when they had left the station.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the man before me said \xe2\x80\x98Hampstead,\xe2\x80\x99 sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the driver.\r\n\r\nOver and over again, on the wearisome journey to the northwestern\r\nsuburb, Midwinter asked if the cab was still in sight. Over and over\r\nagain, the man answered, \xe2\x80\x9cRight in front of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was between nine and ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock when the driver pulled up his horse\r\nat last. Midwinter got out, and saw the cab before them waiting at a\r\nhouse door. As soon as he had satisfied himself that the driver was\r\nthe man whom Mr. Bashwood had hired, he paid the promised reward, and\r\ndismissed his own cab.\r\n\r\nHe took a turn backward and forward before the door. The vaguely\r\nterrible suspicion which had risen in his mind at the terminus had\r\nforced itself by this time into a definite form which was abhorrent to\r\nhim. Without the shadow of an assignable reason for it, he found himself\r\nblindly distrusting his wife\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity, and blindly suspecting Mr.\r\nBashwood of serving her in the capacity of go-between. In sheer horror\r\nof his own morbid fancy, he determined to take down the number of\r\nthe house, and the name of the street in which it stood; and then, in\r\njustice to his wife, to return at once to the address which she had\r\ngiven him as the address at which her mother lived. He had taken out\r\nhis pocket-book, and was on his way to the corner of the street, when\r\nhe observed the man who had driven Mr. Bashwood looking at him with\r\nan expression of inquisitive surprise. The idea of questioning the\r\ncab-driver, while he had the opportunity, instantly occurred to him. He\r\ntook a half-crown from his pocket and put it into the man\xe2\x80\x99s ready hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the gentleman whom you drove from the station gone into that\r\nhouse?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear him inquire for anybody when the door was opened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked for a lady, sir. Mrs.--\xe2\x80\x9d The man hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ncommon name, sir; I should know it again if I heard it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it \xe2\x80\x98Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, sir. Mrs. Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure it was \xe2\x80\x98Mrs.\xe2\x80\x99 and not \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m as sure as a man can be who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken any particular notice,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doubt implied in that last answer decided Midwinter to investigate\r\nthe matter on the spot. He ascended the house steps. As he raised his\r\nhand to the bell at the side of the door, the violence of his agitation\r\nmastered him physically for the moment. A strange sensation, as of\r\nsomething leaping up from his heart to his brain, turned his head wildly\r\ngiddy. He held by the house railings and kept his face to the air, and\r\nresolutely waited till he was steady again. Then he rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs?\xe2\x80\x9d--he tried to ask for \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Armadale,\xe2\x80\x9d when the maid-servant had\r\nopened the door, but not even his resolution could force the name to\r\npass his lips--\xe2\x80\x9cis your mistress at home?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl showed him into a back parlor, and presented him to a little\r\nold lady, with an obliging manner and a bright pair of eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter. \xe2\x80\x9cI wished to see--\xe2\x80\x9d Once more\r\nhe tried to utter the name, and once more he failed to force it to his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Armadale?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the little old lady, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow the gentleman upstairs, Jenny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl led the way to the drawing-room floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny name, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood had barely completed his report of what had happened at the\r\nterminus; Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s imperious mistress was still sitting speechless\r\nunder the shock of the discovery that had burst on her--when the door\r\nof the room opened; and, without a word of warning to proceed him,\r\nMidwinter appeared on the threshold. He took one step into the room, and\r\nmechanically pushed the door to behind him. He stood in dead silence,\r\nand confronted his wife, with a scrutiny that was terrible in its\r\nunnatural self-possession, and that enveloped her steadily in one\r\ncomprehensive look from head to foot.\r\n\r\nIn dead silence on her side, she rose from her chair. In dead silence\r\nshe stood erect on the hearth-rug, and faced her husband in widow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nweeds.\r\n\r\nHe took one step nearer to her, and stopped again. He lifted his\r\nhand, and pointed with his lean brown finger at her dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, without losing his terrible\r\nself-possession, and without moving his outstretched hand.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his voice, the quick rise and fall of her bosom--which\r\nhad been the one outward betrayal thus far of the inner agony that\r\ntortured her--suddenly stopped. She stood impenetrably silent,\r\nbreathlessly still--as if his question had struck her dead, and his\r\npointing hand had petrified her.\r\n\r\nHe advanced one step nearer, and reiterated his words in a voice even\r\nlower and quieter than the voice in which he had spoken first.\r\n\r\nOne moment more of silence, one moment more of inaction, might have been\r\nthe salvation of her. But the fatal force of her character triumphed\r\nat the crisis of her destiny, and his. White and still, and haggard and\r\nold, she met the dreadful emergency with a dreadful courage, and spoke\r\nthe irrevocable words which renounced him to his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Midwinter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in tones unnaturally hard and unnaturally\r\nclear, \xe2\x80\x9cour acquaintance hardly entitles you to speak to me in that\r\nmanner.\xe2\x80\x9d Those were her words. She never lifted her eyes from the ground\r\nwhile she spoke them. When she had done, the last faint vestige of color\r\nin her cheeks faded out.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Still steadily looking at her, he set himself to\r\nfix the language she had used to him in his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cShe calls me\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Midwinter,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said, slowly, in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cShe speaks of \xe2\x80\x98our\r\nacquaintance.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He waited a little and looked round the room. His\r\nwandering eyes encountered Mr. Bashwood for the first time. He saw the\r\nsteward standing near the fireplace, trembling, and watching him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI once did you a service,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand you once told me you were not\r\nan ungrateful man. Are you grateful enough to answer me if I ask you\r\nsomething?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited a little again. Mr. Bashwood still stood trembling at the\r\nfireplace, silently watching him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you looking at me,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there some change in me that\r\nI am not conscious of myself? Am I seeing things that you don\xe2\x80\x99t see? Am\r\nI hearing words that you don\xe2\x80\x99t hear? Am I looking or speaking like a man\r\nout of his senses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he waited, and again the silence was unbroken. His eyes began to\r\nglitter; and the savage blood that he had inherited from his mother rose\r\ndark and slow in his ashy cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthe woman whom you once knew, whose name was\r\nMiss Gwilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more his wife collected her fatal courage. Once more his wife spoke\r\nher fatal words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou compel me to repeat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are presuming on our\r\nacquaintance, and that you are forgetting what is due to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned upon her, with a savage suddenness which forced a cry of alarm\r\nfrom Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you, or are you not, My Wife?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, through his set teeth.\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to his for the first time. Her lost spirit looked at\r\nhim, steadily defiant, out of the hell of its own despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am _not_ your wife,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe staggered back, with his hands groping for something to hold by, like\r\nthe hands of a man in the dark. He leaned heavily against the wall of\r\nthe room, and looked at the woman who had slept on his bosom, and who\r\nhad denied him to his face.\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood stole panic-stricken to her side. \xe2\x80\x9cGo in there!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered, trying to draw her toward the folding-doors which led into\r\nthe next room. \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, be quick! He\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put the old man back with her hand. She looked at him with a sudden\r\nirradiation of her blank face. She answered him with lips that struggled\r\nslowly into a frightful smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Let_ him kill me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAs the words passed her lips, he sprang forward from the wall, with a\r\ncry that rang through the house. The frenzy of a maddened man flashed at\r\nher from his glassy eyes, and clutched at her in his threatening hands.\r\nHe came on till he was within arms-length of her--and suddenly stood\r\nstill. The black flush died out of his face in the instant when he\r\nstopped. His eyelids fell, his outstretched hands wavered and sank\r\nhelpless. He dropped, as the dead drop. He lay as the dead lie, in the\r\narms of the wife who had denied him.\r\n\r\nShe knelt on the floor, and rested his head on her knee. She caught the\r\narm of the steward hurrying to help her, with a hand that closed round\r\nit like a vise. \xe2\x80\x9cGo for a doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand keep the people of the\r\nhouse away till he comes.\xe2\x80\x9d There was that in her eye, there was that\r\nin her voice, which would have warned any man living to obey her in\r\nsilence. In silence Mr. Bashwood submitted, and hurried out of the room.\r\n\r\nThe instant she was alone she raised him from her knee. With both arms\r\nclasped round him, the miserable woman lifted his lifeless face to hers\r\nand rocked him on her bosom in an agony of tenderness beyond all relief\r\nin tears, in a passion of remorse beyond all expression in words.\r\nIn silence she held him to her breast, in silence she devoured his\r\nforehead, his cheeks, his lips, with kisses. Not a sound escaped her\r\ntill she heard the trampling footsteps outside, hurrying up the stairs.\r\nThen a low moan burst from her lips, as she looked her last at him, and\r\nlowered his head again to her knee, before the strangers came in.\r\n\r\nThe landlady and the steward were the first persons whom she saw when\r\nthe door was opened. The medical man (a surgeon living in the street)\r\nfollowed. The horror and the beauty of her face as she looked up at him\r\nabsorbed the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s attention for the moment, to the exclusion of\r\neverything else. She had to beckon to him, she had to point to the\r\nsenseless man, before she could claim his attention for his patient and\r\ndivert it from herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he dead?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon carried Midwinter to the sofa, and ordered the windows to be\r\nopened. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fainting fit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cnothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that answer her strength failed her for the first time. She drew a\r\ndeep breath of relief, and leaned on the chimney-piece for support. Mr.\r\nBashwood was the only person present who noticed that she was overcome.\r\nHe led her to the opposite end of the room, where there was an\r\neasy-chair, leaving the landlady to hand the restoratives to the surgeon\r\nas they were wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to wait here till he recovers?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the steward,\r\nlooking toward the sofa, and trembling as he looked.\r\n\r\nThe question forced her to a sense of her position--to a knowledge\r\nof the merciless necessities which that position now forced her to\r\nconfront. With a heavy sigh she looked toward the sofa, considered with\r\nherself for a moment, and answered Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry by a question\r\non her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the cab that brought you here from the railway still at the door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive at once to the gates of the Sanitarium, and wait there till I\r\njoin you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood hesitated. She lifted her eyes to his, and, with a look,\r\nsent him out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman is coming to, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlady, as the steward\r\nclosed the door. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has just breathed again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bowed in mute reply, rose, and considered with herself once\r\nmore--looked toward the sofa for the second time--then passed through\r\nthe folding-doors into her own room.\r\n\r\nAfter a short lapse of time the surgeon drew back from the sofa and\r\nmotioned to the landlady to stand aside. The bodily recovery of the\r\npatient was assured. There was nothing to be done now but to wait, and\r\nlet his mind slowly recall its sense of what had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d were the first words he said to the surgeon, and the\r\nlandlady anxiously watching him.\r\n\r\nThe landlady knocked at the folding-doors, and received no answer. She\r\nwent in, and found the room empty. A sheet of note-paper was on the\r\ndressing-table, with the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s fee placed on it. The paper contained\r\nthese lines, evidently written in great agitation or in great haste: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis impossible for me to remain here to-night, after what has happened.\r\nI will return to-morrow to take away my luggage, and to pay what I owe\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d Midwinter asked again, when the landlady returned alone\r\nto the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady\xe2\x80\x99s color rose. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you know her handwriting, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered, handing him the sheet of note-paper, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps you may believe\r\n_that_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the paper. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he\r\nhanded it back--\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something in his face as he spoke those words which more than\r\nsoothed the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s irritation: it touched her with a sudden pity\r\nfor the man who had offended her. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid there is some dreadful\r\ntrouble, sir, at the bottom of all this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, simply. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish\r\nme to give any message to the lady when she comes back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter rose and steadied himself for a moment against the sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill bring my own message to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI must see her before\r\nshe leaves your house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon accompanied his patient into the street. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I see you\r\nhome?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not walk, if it is far. You\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t overexert yourself; you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t catch a chill this cold night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter took his hand and thanked him. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been used to hard\r\nwalking and cold nights, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand I am not easily worn out,\r\neven when I look so broken as I do now. If you will tell me the nearest\r\nway out of these streets, I think the quiet of the country and the quiet\r\nof the night will help me. I have something serious to do to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, in a lower tone; \xe2\x80\x9cand I can\xe2\x80\x99t rest or sleep till I have thought\r\nover it to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon understood that he had no common man to deal with. He gave\r\nthe necessary directions without any further remark, and parted with his\r\npatient at his own door.\r\n\r\nLeft by himself, Midwinter paused, and looked up at the heavens in\r\nsilence. The night had cleared, and the stars were out--the stars which\r\nhe had first learned to know from his gypsy master on the hillside. For\r\nthe first time his mind went back regretfully to his boyish days. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nfor the old life!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, longingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew till now how\r\nhappy the old life was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe roused himself, and went on toward the open country. His face\r\ndarkened as he left the streets behind him and advanced into the\r\nsolitude and obscurity that lay beyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has denied her husband to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe shall know her\r\nmaster to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE PURPLE FLASK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cab was waiting at the gates as Miss Gwilt approached the\r\nSanitarium. Mr. Bashwood got out and advanced to meet her. She took his\r\narm and led him aside a few steps, out of the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s hearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink what you like of me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, keeping her thick black veil down\r\nover her face, \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me to-night. Drive back to your hotel\r\nas if nothing had happened. Meet the tidal train to-morrow as usual, and\r\ncome to me afterward at the Sanitarium. Go without a word, and I shall\r\nbelieve there is one man in the world who really loves me. Stay and ask\r\nquestions, and I shall bid you good-by at once and forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the cab. In a minute more it had left the Sanitarium and\r\nwas taking Mr. Bashwood back to his hotel.\r\n\r\nShe opened the iron gate and walked slowly up to the house door. A\r\nshudder ran through her as she rang the bell. She laughed bitterly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShivering again!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cWho would have thought I had so\r\nmuch feeling left in me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor once in her life the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s face told the truth, when the study\r\ndoor opened between ten and eleven at night, and Miss Gwilt entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy on me!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with a look of the blankest bewilderment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have decided to-night instead of\r\ndeciding to-morrow. You, who know women so well, ought to know that they\r\nact on impulse. I am here on an impulse. Take me or leave me, just as\r\nyou like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake you or leave you?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the doctor, recovering his presence of\r\nmind. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lady, what a dreadful way of putting it! Your room shall\r\nbe got ready instantly! Where is your luggage? Will you let me send\r\nfor it? No? You can do without your luggage to-night? What admirable\r\nfortitude! You will fetch it yourself to-morrow? What extraordinary\r\nindependence! Do take off your bonnet. Do draw in to the fire! What can\r\nI offer you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOffer me the strongest sleeping draught you ever made in your life,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd leave me alone till the time comes to take it. I\r\nshall be your patient in earnest!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, fiercely, as the doctor\r\nattempted to remonstrate. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be the maddest of the mad if you\r\nirritate me to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Principal of the Sanitarium became gravely and briefly professional\r\nin an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down in that dark corner,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a soul shall disturb you.\r\nIn half an hour you will find your room ready, and your sleeping\r\ndraught on the table.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a harder struggle for her than\r\nI anticipated,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, as he left the room, and crossed to his\r\nDispensary on the opposite side of the hall. \xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, what\r\nbusiness has she with a conscience, after such a life as hers has been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Dispensary was elaborately fitted up with all the latest\r\nimprovements in medical furniture. But one of the four walls of the room\r\nwas unoccupied by shelves, and here the vacant space was filled by a\r\nhandsome antique cabinet of carved wood, curiously out of harmony, as an\r\nobject, with the unornamented utilitarian aspect of the place generally.\r\nOn either side of the cabinet two speaking-tubes were inserted in the\r\nwall, communicating with the upper regions of the house, and labeled\r\nrespectively \xe2\x80\x9cResident Dispenser\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHead Nurse.\xe2\x80\x9d Into the second of\r\nthese tubes the doctor spoke, on entering the room. An elderly woman\r\nappeared, took her orders for preparing Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s bed-chamber,\r\ncourtesied, and retired.\r\n\r\nLeft alone again in the Dispensary, the doctor unlocked the center\r\ncompartment of the cabinet, and disclosed a collection of bottles\r\ninside, containing the various poisons used in medicine. After taking\r\nout the laudanum wanted for the sleeping draught, and placing it on\r\nthe dispensary table, he went back to the cabinet, looked into it for a\r\nlittle while, shook his head doubtfully, and crossed to the open shelves\r\non the opposite side of the room.\r\n\r\nHere, after more consideration, he took down one out of the row of large\r\nchemical bottles before him, filled with a yellow liquid; placing the\r\nbottle on the table, he returned to the cabinet, and opened a side\r\ncompartment, containing some specimens of Bohemian glass-work. After\r\nmeasuring it with his eye, he took from the specimens a handsome purple\r\nflask, high and narrow in form, and closed by a glass stopper. This\r\nhe filled with the yellow liquid, leaving a small quantity only at the\r\nbottom of the bottle, and locking up the flask again in the place from\r\nwhich he had taken it. The bottle was next restored to its place, after\r\nhaving been filled up with water from the cistern in the Dispensary,\r\nmixed with certain chemical liquids in small quantities, which restored\r\nit (so far as appearances went) to the condition in which it had\r\nbeen when it was first removed from the shelf. Having completed these\r\nmysterious proceedings, the doctor laughed softly, and went back to his\r\nspeaking-tubes to summon the Resident Dispenser next.\r\n\r\nThe Resident Dispenser made his appearance shrouded in the necessary\r\nwhite apron from his waist to his feet. The doctor solemnly wrote a\r\nprescription for a composing draught, and handed it to his assistant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanted immediately, Benjamin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a soft and melancholy voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady patient--Mrs. Armadale, Room No. 1, second floor. Ah, dear,\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned the doctor, absently; \xe2\x80\x9can anxious case, Benjamin--an\r\nanxious case.\xe2\x80\x9d He opened the brand-new ledger of the establishment,\r\nand entered the Case at full length, with a brief abstract of the\r\nprescription. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you done with the laudanum? Put it back, and lock\r\nthe cabinet, and give me the key. Is the draught ready? Label it, \xe2\x80\x98To\r\nbe taken at bedtime,\xe2\x80\x99 and give it to the nurse, Benjamin--give it to the\r\nnurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s lips were issuing these directions, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands were occupied in opening a drawer under the desk on which the\r\nledger was placed. He took out some gayly printed cards of admission \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nview the Sanitarium, between the hours of two and four P.M.,\xe2\x80\x9d and filled\r\nthem up with the date of the next day, \xe2\x80\x9cDecember 10th.\xe2\x80\x9d When a dozen\r\nof the cards had been wrapped up in a dozen lithographed letters of\r\ninvitation, and inclosed in a dozen envelopes, he next consulted a list\r\nof the families resident in the neighborhood, and directed the envelopes\r\nfrom the list. Ringing a bell this time, instead of speaking through\r\na tube, he summoned the man-servant, and gave him the letters, to be\r\ndelivered by hand the first thing the next morning. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it will\r\ndo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, taking a turn in the Dispensary when the servant\r\nhad gone out--\xe2\x80\x9cI think it will do.\xe2\x80\x9d While he was still absorbed in his\r\nown reflections, the nurse re-appeared to announce that the lady\xe2\x80\x99s room\r\nwas ready; and the doctor thereupon formally returned to the study to\r\ncommunicate the information to Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\nShe had not moved since he left her. She rose from her dark corner when\r\nhe made his announcement, and, without speaking or raising her veil,\r\nglided out of the room like a ghost.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief interval, the nurse came downstairs again, with a word for\r\nher master\xe2\x80\x99s private ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady has ordered me to call her to-morrow at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe means to fetch her luggage herself, and she wants to have\r\na cab at the door as soon as she is dressed. What am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what the lady tells you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cShe may be safely\r\ntrusted to return to the Sanitarium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe breakfast hour at the Sanitarium was half-past eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. By\r\nthat time Miss Gwilt had settled everything at her lodgings, and had\r\nreturned with her luggage in her own possession. The doctor was quite\r\namazed at the promptitude of his patient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy waste so much energy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, when they met at the\r\nbreakfast-table. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy be in such a hurry, my dear lady, when you had all\r\nthe morning before you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMere restlessness!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, briefly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe longer I live, the more\r\nimpatient I get.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who had noticed before she spoke that her face looked\r\nstrangely pale and old that morning, observed, when she answered him,\r\nthat her expression--naturally mobile in no ordinary degree--remained\r\nquite unaltered by the effort of speaking. There was none of the usual\r\nanimation on her lips, none of the usual temper in her eyes. He had\r\nnever seen her so impenetrably and coldly composed as he saw her now.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has made up her mind at last,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI may say to her this\r\nmorning what I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say to her last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe prefaced the coming remarks by a warning look at her widow\xe2\x80\x99s dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you have got your luggage,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cpermit me to\r\nsuggest putting that cap away, and wearing another gown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember what you told me a day or two since?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the doctor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said there was a chance of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s dying in my Sanitarium?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say it again, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA more unlikely chance,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the doctor, deaf as ever to all\r\nawkward interruptions, \xe2\x80\x9cit is hardly possible to imagine! But as long\r\nas it is a chance at all, it is worth considering. Say, then, that he\r\ndies--dies suddenly and unexpectedly, and makes a Coroner\xe2\x80\x99s Inquest\r\nnecessary in the house. What is our course in that case? Our course is\r\nto preserve the characters to which we have committed ourselves--you\r\nas his widow, and I as the witness of your marriage--and, _in_ those\r\ncharacters, to court the fullest inquiry. In the entirely improbable\r\nevent of his dying just when we want him to die, my idea--I might even\r\nsay, my resolution--is to admit that we knew of his resurrection from\r\nthe sea; and to acknowledge that we instructed Mr. Bashwood to entrap\r\nhim into this house, by means of a false statement about Miss Milroy.\r\nWhen the inevitable questions follow, I propose to assert that he\r\nexhibited symptoms of mental alienation shortly after your marriage;\r\nthat his delusion consisted in denying that you were his wife, and in\r\ndeclaring that he was engaged to be married to Miss Milroy; that you\r\nwere in such terror of him on this account, when you heard he was alive\r\nand coming back, as to be in a state of nervous agitation that required\r\nmy care; that at your request, and to calm that nervous agitation, I saw\r\nhim professionally, and got him quietly into the house by a humoring of\r\nhis delusion, perfectly justifiable in such a case; and, lastly, that I\r\ncan certify his brain to have been affected by one of those mysterious\r\ndisorders, eminently incurable, eminently fatal, in relation to which\r\nmedical science is still in the dark. Such a course as this (in the\r\nremotely possible event which we are now supposing) would be, in your\r\ninterests and mine, unquestionably the right course to take; and such a\r\ndress as _that_ is, just as certainly, under existing circumstances, the\r\nwrong dress to wear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I take it off at once?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, rising from the\r\nbreakfast-table, without a word of remark on what had just been said to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnytime before two o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-day will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a languid curiosity--nothing more. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy before\r\ntwo?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause this is one of my \xe2\x80\x98Visitors\xe2\x80\x99 Days,\xe2\x80\x99 And the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 time is\r\nfrom two to four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I to do with your visitors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply this. I think it important that perfectly respectable and\r\nperfectly disinterested witnesses should see you, in my house, in the\r\ncharacter of a lady who has come to consult me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour motive seems rather far-fetched. Is it the only motive you have in\r\nthe matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, dear lady!\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9chave I any concealments\r\nfrom _you_? Surely, you ought to know me better than that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a weary contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s dull enough of me not to\r\nunderstand you by this time. Send word upstairs when I am wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nleft him, and went back to her room.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock came; and in a quarter of an hour afterward the visitors\r\nhad arrived. Short as the notice had been, cheerless as the Sanitarium\r\nlooked to spectators from without, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s invitation had been\r\nlargely accepted, nevertheless, by the female members of the families\r\nwhom he had addressed. In the miserable monotony of the lives led by a\r\nlarge section of the middle classes of England, anything is welcome\r\nto the women which offers them any sort of harmless refuge from the\r\nestablished tyranny of the principle that all human happiness begins and\r\nends at home. While the imperious needs of a commercial country limited\r\nthe representatives of the male sex, among the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s visitors, to one\r\nfeeble old man and one sleepy little boy, the women, poor souls, to the\r\nnumber of no less than sixteen--old and young, married and single--had\r\nseized the golden opportunity of a plunge into public life. Harmoniously\r\nunited by the two common objects which they all had in view--in the\r\nfirst place, to look at each other, and, in the second place, to look at\r\nthe Sanitarium--they streamed in neatly dressed procession through the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s dreary iron gates, with a thin varnish over them of assumed\r\nsuperiority to all unladylike excitement, most significant and most\r\npitiable to see!\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of the Sanitarium received his visitors in the hall with\r\nMiss Gwilt on his arm. The hungry eyes of every woman in the company\r\noverlooked the doctor as if no such person had existed; and, fixing on\r\nthe strange lady, devoured her from head to foot in an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy First Inmate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, presenting Miss Gwilt. \xe2\x80\x9cThis lady\r\nonly arrived late last night; and she takes the present opportunity (the\r\nonly one my morning\xe2\x80\x99s engagements have allowed me to give her) of going\r\nover the Sanitarium.--Allow me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, releasing Miss\r\nGwilt, and giving his arm to the eldest lady among the visitors.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShattered nerves--domestic anxiety,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, confidentially.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSweet woman! sad case!\xe2\x80\x9d He sighed softly, and led the old lady across\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\nThe flock of visitors followed, Miss Gwilt accompanying them in silence,\r\nand walking alone--among them, but not of them--the last of all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe grounds, ladies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, wheeling round,\r\nand addressing his audience from the foot of the stairs, \xe2\x80\x9care, as you\r\nhave seen, in a partially unfinished condition. Under any circumstances,\r\nI should lay little stress on the grounds, having Hampstead Heath so\r\nnear at hand, and carriage exercise and horse exercise being parts of\r\nmy System. In a lesser degree, it is also necessary for me to ask\r\nyour indulgence for the basement floor, on which we now stand. The\r\nwaiting-room and study on that side, and the Dispensary on the other\r\n(to which I shall presently ask your attention), are completed. But the\r\nlarge drawing-room is still in the decorator\xe2\x80\x99s hands. In that room (when\r\nthe walls are dry--not a moment before) my inmates will assemble for\r\ncheerful society. Nothing will be spared that can improve, elevate, and\r\nadorn life at these happy little gatherings. Every evening, for example,\r\nthere will be music for those who like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point there was a faint stir among the visitors. A mother of a\r\nfamily interrupted the doctor. She begged to know whether music \xe2\x80\x9cevery\r\nevening\xe2\x80\x9d included Sunday evening; and, if so, what music was performed?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSacred music, of course, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cHandel on Sunday\r\nevening--and Haydn occasionally, when not too cheerful. But, as I was\r\nabout to say, music is not the only entertainment offered to my nervous\r\ninmates. Amusing reading is provided for those who prefer books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another stir among the visitors. Another mother of a family\r\nwished to know whether amusing reading meant novels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly such novels as I have selected and perused myself, in the first\r\ninstance,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing painful, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! There may be plenty\r\nthat is painful in real life; but for that very reason, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want it\r\nin books. The English novelist who enters my house (no foreign novelist\r\nwill be admitted) must understand his art as the healthy-minded English\r\nreader understands it in our time. He must know that our purer modern\r\ntaste, our higher modern morality, limits him to doing exactly\r\ntwo things for us, when he writes us a book. All we want of him\r\nis--occasionally to make us laugh; and invariably to make us\r\ncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a third stir among the visitors--caused plainly this time by\r\napproval of the sentiments which they had just heard. The doctor, wisely\r\ncautious of disturbing the favorable impression that he had produced,\r\ndropped the subject of the drawing-room, and led the way upstairs. As\r\nbefore, the company followed; and, as before, Miss Gwilt walked silently\r\nbehind them, last of all. One after another the ladies looked at her\r\nwith the idea of speaking, and saw something in her face, utterly\r\nunintelligible to them, which checked the well-meant words on their\r\nlips. The prevalent impression was that the Principal of the Sanitarium\r\nhad been delicately concealing the truth, and that his first inmate was\r\nmad.\r\n\r\nThe doctor led the way--with intervals of breathing-time accorded to the\r\nold lady on his arm--straight to the top of the house. Having collected\r\nhis visitors in the corridor, and having waved his hand indicatively\r\nat the numbered doors opening out of it on either side, he invited the\r\ncompany to look into any or all of the rooms at their own pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNumbers one to four, ladies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cinclude\r\nthe dormitories of the attendants. Numbers four to eight are rooms\r\nintended for the accommodation of the poorer class of patients, whom I\r\nreceive on terms which simply cover my expenditure--nothing more. In\r\nthe cases of these poorer persons among my suffering fellow creatures,\r\npersonal piety and the recommendation of two clergymen are indispensable\r\nto admission. Those are the only conditions I make; but those I insist\r\non. Pray observe that the rooms are all ventilated, and the bedsteads\r\nall iron and kindly notice, as we descend again to the second floor,\r\nthat there is a door shutting off all communication between the second\r\nstory and the top story when necessary. The rooms on the second floor,\r\nwhich we have now reached, are (with the exception of my own room)\r\nentirely devoted to the reception of lady-inmates--experience having\r\nconvinced me that the greater sensitiveness of the female constitution\r\nnecessitates the higher position of the sleeping apartment, with a view\r\nto the greater purity and freer circulation of the air. Here the ladies\r\nare established immediately under my care, while my assistant-physician\r\n(whom I expect to arrive in a week\xe2\x80\x99s time) looks after the gentlemen on\r\nthe floor beneath. Observe, again, as we descend to this lower, or first\r\nfloor, a second door, closing all communication at night between the\r\ntwo stories to every one but the assistant physician and myself. And\r\nnow that we have reached the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s part of the house, and that\r\nyou have observed for yourselves the regulations of the establishment,\r\npermit me to introduce you to a specimen of my system of treatment next.\r\nI can exemplify it practically, by introducing you to a room fitted up,\r\nunder my own direction, for the accommodation of the most complicated\r\ncases of nervous suffering and nervous delusion that can come under my\r\ncare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe threw open the door of a room at one extremity of the corridor,\r\nnumbered Four. \xe2\x80\x9cLook in, ladies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand, if you\r\nsee anything remarkable, pray mention it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe room was not very large, but it was well lit by one broad window.\r\nComfortably furnished as a bedroom, it was only remarkable among other\r\nrooms of the same sort in one way. It had no fireplace. The visitors\r\nhaving noticed this, were informed that the room was warmed in winter by\r\nmeans of hot water; and were then invited back again into the corridor,\r\nto make the discoveries, under professional direction, which they were\r\nunable to make for themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA word, ladies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cliterally a word, on\r\nnervous derangement first. What is the process of treatment, when,\r\nlet us say, mental anxiety has broken you down, and you apply to your\r\ndoctor? He sees you, hears you, and gives you two prescriptions. One\r\nis written on paper, and made up at the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s. The other is\r\nadministered by word of mouth, at the propitious moment when the fee is\r\nready; and consists in a general recommendation to you to keep your\r\nmind easy. That excellent advice given, your doctor leaves you to spare\r\nyourself all earthly annoyances by your own unaided efforts, until he\r\ncalls again. Here my System steps in and helps you! When _I_ see the\r\nnecessity of keeping your mind easy, I take the bull by the horns and do\r\nit for you. I place you in a sphere of action in which the ten thousand\r\ntrifles which must, and do, irritate nervous people at home are\r\nexpressly considered and provided against. I throw up impregnable moral\r\nintrenchments between Worry and You. Find a door banging in _this_\r\nhouse, if you can! Catch a servant in _this_ house rattling the\r\ntea-things when he takes away the tray! Discover barking dogs, crowing\r\ncocks, hammering workmen, screeching children _here_--and I engage to\r\nclose My Sanitarium to-morrow! Are these nuisances laughing matters to\r\nnervous people? Ask them! Can they escape these nuisances at home? Ask\r\nthem! Will ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 irritation from a barking dog or a screeching\r\nchild undo every atom of good done to a nervous sufferer by a month\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmedical treatment? There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a competent doctor in England who will\r\nventure to deny it! On those plain grounds my System is based. I assert\r\nthe medical treatment of nervous suffering to be entirely subsidiary\r\nto the moral treatment of it. That moral treatment of it you find here.\r\nThat moral treatment, sedulously pursued throughout the day, follows\r\nthe sufferer into his room at night; and soothes, helps and cures him,\r\nwithout his own knowledge--you shall see how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor paused to take breath and looked, for the first time since\r\nthe visitors had entered the house, at Miss Gwilt. For the first time,\r\non her side, she stepped forward among the audience, and looked at him\r\nin return. After a momentary obstruction in the shape of a cough, the\r\ndoctor went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, ladies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my patient has just\r\ncome in. His mind is one mass of nervous fancies and caprices, which\r\nhis friends (with the best possible intentions) have been ignorantly\r\nirritating at home. They have been afraid of him, for instance, at\r\nnight. They have forced him to have somebody to sleep in the room with\r\nhim, or they have forbidden him, in case of accidents, to lock his door.\r\nHe comes to me the first night, and says: \xe2\x80\x98Mind, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have anybody\r\nin my room!\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not!\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98I insist on locking my door.\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98By all\r\nmeans!\xe2\x80\x99 In he goes, and locks his door; and there he is, soothed and\r\nquieted, predisposed to confidence, predisposed to sleep, by having his\r\nown way. \xe2\x80\x98This is all very well,\xe2\x80\x99 you may say; \xe2\x80\x98but suppose something\r\nhappens, suppose he has a fit in the night, what then?\xe2\x80\x99 You shall see!\r\nHallo, my young friend!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the doctor, suddenly addressing the\r\nsleepy little boy. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a game. You shall be the poor sick\r\nman, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the good doctor. Go into that room and lock the door.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a brave boy! Have you locked it? Very good! Do you think I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget at you if I like? I wait till you\xe2\x80\x99re asleep--I press this little\r\nwhite button, hidden here in the stencilled pattern of the outer\r\nwall--the mortise of the lock inside falls back silently against the\r\ndoor-post--and I walk into the room whenever I like. The same plan is\r\npursued with the window. My capricious patient won\xe2\x80\x99t open it at night,\r\nwhen he ought. I humor him again. \xe2\x80\x98Shut it, dear sir, by all means!\xe2\x80\x99 As\r\nsoon as he is asleep, I pull the black handle hidden here, in the corner\r\nof the wall. The window of the room inside noiselessly opens, as you\r\nsee. Say the patient\xe2\x80\x99s caprice is the other way--he persists in opening\r\nthe window when he ought to shut it. Let him! by all means, let him!\r\nI pull a second handle when he is snug in his bed, and the window\r\nnoiselessly closes in a moment. Nothing to irritate him, ladies and\r\ngentlemen--absolutely nothing to irritate him! But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done with\r\nhim yet. Epidemic disease, in spite of all my precautions, may\r\nenter this Sanitarium, and may render the purifying of the sick-room\r\nnecessary. Or the patient\xe2\x80\x99s case may be complicated by other than\r\nnervous malady--say, for instance, asthmatic difficulty of breathing. In\r\nthe one case, fumigation is necessary; in the other, additional oxygen\r\nin the air will give relief. The epidemic nervous patient says, \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe smoked under my own nose!\xe2\x80\x99 The asthmatic nervous patient gasps with\r\nterror at the idea of a chemical explosion in his room. I noiselessly\r\nfumigate one of them; I noiselessly oxygenize the other, by means of a\r\nsimple Apparatus fixed outside in the corner here. It is protected by\r\nthis wooden casing; it is locked with my own key; and it communicates by\r\nmeans of a tube with the interior of the room. Look at it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a preliminary glance at Miss Gwilt, the doctor unlocked the lid of\r\nthe wooden casing, and disclosed inside nothing more remarkable than a\r\nlarge stone jar, having a glass funnel, and a pipe communicating with\r\nthe wall, inserted in the cork which closed the mouth of it. With\r\nanother look at Miss Gwilt, the doctor locked the lid again, and asked,\r\nin the blandest manner, whether his System was intelligible now?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might introduce you to all sorts of other contrivances of the same\r\nkind,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, leading the way downstairs; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it would be only the\r\nsame thing over and over again. A nervous patient who always has his own\r\nway is a nervous patient who is never worried; and a nervous patient who\r\nis never worried is a nervous patient cured. There it is in a nutshell!\r\nCome and see the Dispensary, ladies; the Dispensary and the kitchen\r\nnext!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more, Miss Gwilt dropped behind the visitors, and waited\r\nalone--looking steadfastly at the Room which the doctor had opened, and\r\nat the apparatus which the doctor had unlocked. Again, without a word\r\npassing between them, she had understood him. She knew, as well as if he\r\nhad confessed it, that he was craftily putting the necessary temptation\r\nin her way, before witnesses who could speak to the superficially\r\ninnocent acts which they had seen, if anything serious happened. The\r\napparatus, originally constructed to serve the purpose of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmedical crotchets, was evidently to be put to some other use, of which\r\nthe doctor himself had probably never dreamed till now. And the chances\r\nwere that, before the day was over, that other use would be privately\r\nrevealed to her at the right moment, in the presence of the right\r\nwitness. \xe2\x80\x9cArmadale will die this time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, as she went\r\nslowly down the stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor will kill him, by my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visitors were in the Dispensary when she joined them. All the ladies\r\nwere admiring the beauty of the antique cabinet; and, as a necessary\r\nconsequence, all the ladies were desirous of seeing what was inside. The\r\ndoctor--after a preliminary look at Miss Gwilt--good-humoredly shook his\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to interest you inside,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing but\r\nrows of little shabby bottles containing the poisons used in medicine\r\nwhich I keep under lock and key. Come to the kitchen, ladies, and honor\r\nme with your advice on domestic matters below stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d He glanced again\r\nat Miss Gwilt as the company crossed the hall, with a look which said\r\nplainly, \xe2\x80\x9cWait here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn another quarter of an hour the doctor had expounded his views on\r\ncookery and diet, and the visitors (duly furnished with prospectuses)\r\nwere taking leave of him at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite an intellectual treat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n they said to each other, as they streamed out again in neatly dressed\r\nprocession through the iron gates. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what a very superior man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor turned back to the Dispensary, humming absently to himself,\r\nand failing entirely to observe the corner of the hall in which Miss\r\nGwilt stood retired. After an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, she followed him.\r\nThe assistant was in the room when she entered it--summoned by his\r\nemployer the moment before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, coldly and mechanically, as if she was repeating a\r\nlesson, \xe2\x80\x9cI am as curious as the other ladies about that pretty cabinet\r\nof yours. Now they are all gone, won\xe2\x80\x99t you show the inside of it to\r\n_me_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor laughed in his pleasantest manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old story,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBlue-Beard\xe2\x80\x99s locked chamber, and female\r\ncuriosity! (Don\xe2\x80\x99t go, Benjamin, don\xe2\x80\x99t go.) My dear lady, what interest\r\ncan you possibly have in looking at a medical bottle, simply because it\r\nhappens to be a bottle of poison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe repeated her lesson for the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the interest of looking at it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand of thinking, if\r\nit got into some people\xe2\x80\x99s hands, of the terrible things it might do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor glanced at his assistant with a compassionate smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurious, Benjamin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe romantic view taken of these drugs of\r\nours by the unscientific mind! My dear lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to Miss\r\nGwilt, \xe2\x80\x9cif _that_ is the interest you attach to looking at poisons, you\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to unlock my cabinet--you need only look about you round\r\nthe shelves of this room. There are all sorts of medical liquids\r\nand substances in those bottles--most innocent, most useful in\r\nthemselves--which, in combination with other substances and other\r\nliquids, become poisons as terrible and as deadly as any that I have in\r\nmy cabinet under lock and key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for a moment, and creased to the opposite side of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me one,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\r\nStill smiling as good-humoredly as ever, the doctor humored his nervous\r\npatient. He pointed to the bottle from which he had privately removed\r\nthe yellow liquid on the previous day, and which he had filled up again\r\nwith a carefully-colored imitation in the shape of a mixture of his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see that bottle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said--\xe2\x80\x9cthat plump, round,\r\ncomfortable-looking bottle? Never mind the name of what is beside it;\r\nlet us stick to the bottle, and distinguish it, if you like, by giving\r\nit a name of our own. Suppose we call it \xe2\x80\x98our Stout Friend\xe2\x80\x99? Very good.\r\nOur Stout Friend, by himself, is a most harmless and useful medicine. He\r\nis freely dispensed every day to tens of thousands of patients all over\r\nthe civilized world. He has made no romantic appearances in courts of\r\nlaw; he has excited no breathless interest in novels; he has played\r\nno terrifying part on the stage. There he is, an innocent, inoffensive\r\ncreature, who troubles nobody with the responsibility of locking him up!\r\n_But_ bring him into contact with something else--introduce him to the\r\nacquaintance of a certain common mineral substance, of a universally\r\naccessible kind, broken into fragments; provide yourself with (say) six\r\ndoses of our Stout Friend, and pour those doses consecutively on the\r\nfragments I have mentioned, at intervals of not less than five minutes.\r\nQuantities of little bubbles will rise at every pouring; collect the gas\r\nin those bubbles, and convey it into a closed chamber--and let Samson\r\nhimself be in that closed chamber; our stout Friend will kill him in\r\nhalf an hour! Will kill him slowly, without his seeing anything, without\r\nhis smelling anything, without his feeling anything but sleepiness.\r\nWill kill him, and tell the whole College of Surgeons nothing, if they\r\nexamine him after death, but that he died of apoplexy or congestion\r\nof the lungs! What do you think of _that_, my dear lady, in the way of\r\nmystery and romance? Is our harmless Stout Friend as interesting _now_\r\nas if he rejoiced in the terrible popular fame of the Arsenic and\r\nthe Strychnine which I keep locked up there? Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I am\r\nexaggerating! Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m inventing a story to put you off with,\r\nas the children say. Ask Benjamin there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, appealing\r\nto his assistant, with his eyes fixed on Miss Gwilt. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk Benjamin,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated, with the steadiest emphasis on the next words, \xe2\x80\x9cif six doses\r\nfrom that bottle, at intervals of five minutes each, would not, under\r\nthe conditions I have stated, produce the results I have described?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Resident Dispenser, modestly admiring Miss Gwilt at a distance,\r\nstarted and colored up. He was plainly gratified by the little attention\r\nwhich had included him in the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor is quite right, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing Miss Gwilt, with\r\nhis best bow; \xe2\x80\x9cthe production of the gas, extended over half an hour,\r\nwould be quite gradual enough. And,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Dispenser, silently\r\nappealing to his employer to let him exhibit a little chemical knowledge\r\non his own account, \xe2\x80\x9cthe volume of the gas would be sufficient at the\r\nend of the time--if I am not mistaken, sir?--to be fatal to any person\r\nentering the room in less than five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnquestionably, Benjamin,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think we have\r\nhad enough of chemistry for the present,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to Miss\r\nGwilt. \xe2\x80\x9cWith every desire, my dear lady, to gratify every passing wish\r\nyou may form, I venture to propose trying a more cheerful subject.\r\nSuppose we leave the Dispensary, before it suggests any more inquiries\r\nto that active mind of yours? No? You want to see an experiment? You\r\nwant to see how the little bubbles are made? Well, well! there is no\r\nharm in that. We will let Mrs. Armadale see the bubbles,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\ndoctor, in the tone of a parent humoring a spoiled child. \xe2\x80\x9cTry if you\r\ncan find a few of those fragments that we want, Benjamin. I dare say the\r\nworkmen (slovenly fellows!) have left something of the sort about the\r\nhouse or the grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Resident Dispenser left the room.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his back was turned, the doctor began opening and shutting\r\ndrawers in various parts of the Dispensary, with the air of a man who\r\nwants something in a hurry, and does not know where to find it. \xe2\x80\x9cBless\r\nmy soul!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, suddenly stopping at the drawer from which he\r\nhad taken his cards of invitation on the previous day, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s this? A\r\nkey? A duplicate key, as I\xe2\x80\x99m alive, of my fumigating apparatus upstairs!\r\nOh dear, dear, how careless I get,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, turning round\r\nbriskly to Miss Gwilt. \xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea that I possessed this\r\nsecond key. I should never have missed it. I do assure you I should\r\nnever have missed it if anybody had taken it out of the drawer!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nbustled away to the other end of the room--without closing the drawer,\r\nand without taking away the duplicate key.\r\n\r\nIn silence, Miss Gwilt listened till he had done. In silence, she glided\r\nto the drawer. In silence, she took the key and hid it in her apron\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nThe Dispenser came back, with the fragments required of him, collected\r\nin a basin. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Benjamin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cKindly cover them\r\nwith water, while I get the bottle down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs accidents sometimes happen in the most perfectly regulated families,\r\nso clumsiness sometimes possesses itself of the most perfectly\r\ndisciplined hands. In the process of its transfer from the shelf to the\r\ndoctor, the bottle slipped and fell smashed to pieces on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my fingers and thumbs!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the doctor, with an air of comic\r\nvexation, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat in the world do you mean by playing me such a wicked\r\ntrick as that? Well, well, well--it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped. Have we got any\r\nmore of it, Benjamin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a drop, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a drop!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear madam, what excuses can I\r\noffer you? My clumsiness has made our little experiment impossible for\r\nto-day. Remind me to order some more to-morrow, Benjamin, and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink of troubling yourself to put that mess to rights. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send the\r\nman here to mop it all up. Our Stout Friend is harmless enough now, my\r\ndear lady--in combination with a boarded floor and a coming mop! I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nso sorry; I really am so sorry to have disappointed you.\xe2\x80\x9d With those\r\nsoothing words, he offered his arm, and led Miss Gwilt out of the\r\nDispensary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you done with me for the present?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, when they were in\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, dear, what a way of putting it!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the doctor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinner at six,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with his politest emphasis, as she turned\r\nfrom him in disdainful silence, and slowly mounted the stairs to her own\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\nA clock of the noiseless sort--incapable of offending irritable\r\nnerves--was fixed in the wall, above the first-floor landing, at the\r\nSanitarium. At the moment when the hands pointed to a quarter before\r\nsix, the silence of the lonely upper regions was softly broken by the\r\nrustling of Miss Gwilt\xe2\x80\x99s dress. She advanced along the corridor of the\r\nfirst floor--paused at the covered apparatus fixed outside the room\r\nnumbered Four--listened for a moment--and then unlocked the cover with\r\nthe duplicate key.\r\n\r\nThe open lid cast a shadow over the inside of the casing. All she saw\r\nat first was what she had seen already--the jar, and the pipe and glass\r\nfunnel inserted in the cork. She removed the funnel; and, looking about\r\nher, observed on the window-sill close by a wax-tipped wand used for\r\nlighting the gas. She took the wand, and, introducing it through the\r\naperture occupied by the funnel, moved it to and fro in the jar. The\r\nfaint splash of some liquid, and the grating noise of certain hard\r\nsubstances which she was stirring about, were the two sounds that caught\r\nher ear. She drew out the wand, and cautiously touched the wet left on\r\nit with the tip of her tongue. Caution was quite needless in this case.\r\nThe liquid was--water.\r\n\r\nIn putting the funnel back in its place, she noticed something faintly\r\nshining in the obscurely lit vacant space at the side of the jar. She\r\ndrew it out, and produced a Purple Flask. The liquid with which it was\r\nfilled showed dark through the transparent coloring of the glass; and\r\nfastened at regular intervals down one side of the Flask were six thin\r\nstrips of paper, which divided the contents into six equal parts.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt now that the apparatus had been secretly prepared for\r\nher--the apparatus of which she alone (besides the doctor) possessed the\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nShe put back the Flask, and locked the cover of the casing. For a moment\r\nshe stood looking at it, with the key in her hand. On a sudden, her lost\r\ncolor came back. On a sudden, its natural animation returned, for the\r\nfirst time that day, to her face. She turned and hurried breathlessly\r\nupstairs to her room on the second floor. With eager hands she snatched\r\nher cloak out of the wardrobe, and took her bonnet from the box. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot in prison!\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out, impetuously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got the use of my\r\nlimbs! I can go--no matter where, as long as I am out of this house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith her cloak on her shoulders, with her bonnet in her hand, she\r\ncrossed the room to the door. A moment more--and she would have been out\r\nin the passage. In that moment the remembrance flashed back on her of\r\nthe husband whom she had denied to his face. She stopped instantly, and\r\nthrew the cloak and bonnet from her on the bed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ngulf is dug between us--the worst is done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s voice outside politely\r\nreminded her that it was six o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door, and stopped him on his way downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time is the train due to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt ten,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the doctor, in a voice which all the world might\r\nhear, and welcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat room is Mr. Armadale to have when he comes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat room would you like him to have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNumber Four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor kept up appearances to the very last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNumber Four let it be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, graciously. \xe2\x80\x9cProvided, of course, that\r\nNumber Four is unoccupied at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe evening wore on, and the night came.\r\n\r\nAt a few minutes before ten, Mr. Bashwood was again at his post, once\r\nmore on the watch for the coming of the tidal train.\r\n\r\nThe inspector on duty, who knew him by sight, and who had personally\r\nascertained that his regular attendance at the terminus implied no\r\ndesigns on the purses and portmanteaus of the passengers, noticed two\r\nnew circumstances in connection with Mr. Bashwood that night. In the\r\nfirst place, instead of exhibiting his customary cheerfulness, he looked\r\nanxious and depressed. In the second place, while he was watching for\r\nthe train, he was to all appearance being watched in his turn, by a\r\nslim, dark, undersized man, who had left his luggage (marked with the\r\nname of Midwinter) at the custom-house department the evening before,\r\nand who had returned to have it examined about half an hour since.\r\n\r\nWhat had brought Midwinter to the terminus? And why was he, too, waiting\r\nfor the tidal train?\r\n\r\nAfter straying as far as Hendon during his lonely walk of the previous\r\nnight, he had taken refuge at the village inn, and had fallen asleep\r\n(from sheer exhaustion) toward those later hours of the morning which\r\nwere the hours that his wife\xe2\x80\x99s foresight had turned to account. When\r\nhe returned to the lodging, the landlady could only inform him that\r\nher tenant had settled everything with her, and had left (for what\r\ndestination neither she nor her servant could tell) more than two hours\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nHaving given some little time to inquiries, the result of which\r\nconvinced him that the clew was lost so far, Midwinter had quitted\r\nthe house, and had pursued his way mechanically to the busier and more\r\ncentral parts of the metropolis. With the light now thrown on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter, to call at the address she had given him as the address at\r\nwhich her mother lived would be plainly useless. He went on through the\r\nstreets, resolute to discover her, and trying vainly to see the means\r\nto his end, till the sense of fatigue forced itself on him once more.\r\nStopping to rest and recruit his strength at the first hotel he came\r\nto, a chance dispute between the waiter and a stranger about a lost\r\nportmanteau reminded him of his own luggage, left at the terminus, and\r\ninstantly took his mind back to the circumstances under which he and\r\nMr. Bashwood had met. In a moment more, the idea that he had been vainly\r\nseeking on his way through the streets flashed on him. In a moment more,\r\nhe had determined to try the chance of finding the steward again on\r\nthe watch for the person whose arrival he had evidently expected by the\r\nprevious evening\xe2\x80\x99s train.\r\n\r\nIgnorant of the report of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s death at sea; uninformed, at the\r\nterrible interview with his wife, of the purpose which her assumption of\r\na widow\xe2\x80\x99s dress really had in view, Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s first vague suspicions\r\nof her fidelity had now inevitably developed into the conviction\r\nthat she was false. He could place but one interpretation on her open\r\ndisavowal of him, and on her taking the name under which he had secretly\r\nmarried her. Her conduct forced the conclusion on him that she was\r\nengaged in some infamous intrigue; and that she had basely secured\r\nherself beforehand in the position of all others in which she knew it\r\nwould be most odious and most repellent to him to claim his authority\r\nover her. With that conviction he was now watching Mr. Bashwood, firmly\r\npersuaded that his wife\xe2\x80\x99s hiding-place was known to the vile servant of\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s vices; and darkly suspecting, as the time wore on, that the\r\nunknown man who had wronged him, and the unknown traveler for whose\r\narrival the steward was waiting, were one and the same.\r\n\r\nThe train was late that night, and the carriages were more than usually\r\ncrowded when they arrived at last. Midwinter became involved in the\r\nconfusion on the platform, and in the effort to extricate himself he\r\nlost sight of Mr. Bashwood for the first time.\r\n\r\nA lapse of some few minutes had passed before he again discovered the\r\nsteward talking eagerly to a man in a loose shaggy coat, whose back was\r\nturned toward him. Forgetful of all the cautions and restraints which\r\nhe had imposed on himself before the train appeared, Midwinter instantly\r\nadvanced on them. Mr. Bashwood saw his threatening face as he came on,\r\nand fell back in silence. The man in the loose coat turned to look where\r\nthe steward was looking, and disclosed to Midwinter, in the full light\r\nof the station-lamp, Allan\xe2\x80\x99s face!\r\n\r\nFor the moment they both stood speechless, hand in hand, looking at each\r\nother. Allan was the first to recover himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God for this!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, fervently. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ask how you came\r\nhere: it\xe2\x80\x99s enough for me that you have come. Miserable news has met me\r\nalready, Midwinter. Nobody but you can comfort me, and help me to bear\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice faltered over those last words, and he said no more.\r\n\r\nThe tone in which he had spoken roused Midwinter to meet the\r\ncircumstances as they were, by appealing to the old grateful interest\r\nin his friend which had once been the foremost interest of his life. He\r\nmastered his personal misery for the first time since it had fallen on\r\nhim, and gently taking Allan aside, asked what had happened.\r\n\r\nThe answer--after informing him of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s reported death at\r\nsea--announced (on Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s authority) that the news had reached\r\nMiss Milroy, and that the deplorable result of the shock thus inflicted\r\nhad obliged the major to place his daughter in the neighborhood of\r\nLondon, under medical care.\r\n\r\nBefore saying a word on his side, Midwinter looked distrustfully behind\r\nhim. Mr. Bashwood had followed them. Mr. Bashwood was watching to see\r\nwhat they did next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he waiting your arrival here to tell you this about Miss Milroy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n asked Midwinter, looking again from the steward to Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been kindly waiting here, night after night,\r\nto meet me, and break the news to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter paused once more. The attempt to reconcile the conclusion he\r\nhad drawn from his wife\xe2\x80\x99s conduct with the discovery that Allan was the\r\nman for whose arrival Mr. Bashwood had been waiting was hopeless. The\r\none present chance of discovering a truer solution of the mystery was\r\nto press the steward on the one available point in which he had laid\r\nhimself open to attack. He had positively denied on the previous evening\r\nthat he knew anything of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s movements, or that he had any interest\r\nin Allan\xe2\x80\x99s return to England. Having detected Mr. Bashwood in one lie\r\ntold to himself. Midwinter instantly suspected him of telling another\r\nto Allan. He seized the opportunity of sifting the statement about Miss\r\nMilroy on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow have you become acquainted with this sad news?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired,\r\nturning suddenly on Mr. Bashwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough the major, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan, before the steward could\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the doctor who has the care of Miss Milroy?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted\r\nMidwinter, still addressing Mr. Bashwood.\r\n\r\nFor the second time the steward made no reply. For the second time,\r\nAllan answered for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a man with a foreign name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cHe keeps a Sanitarium\r\nnear Hampstead. What did you say the place was called, Mr. Bashwood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFairweather Vale, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the steward, answering his employer, as a\r\nmatter of necessity, but answering very unwillingly.\r\n\r\nThe address of the Sanitarium instantly reminded Midwinter that he had\r\ntraced his wife to Fairweather Vale Villas the previous night. He\r\nbegan to see light through the darkness, dimly, for the first time. The\r\ninstinct which comes with emergency, before the slower process of reason\r\ncan assert itself, brought him at a leap to the conclusion that Mr.\r\nBashwood--who had been certainly acting under his wife\xe2\x80\x99s influence the\r\nprevious day--might be acting again under his wife\xe2\x80\x99s influence now.\r\nHe persisted in sifting the steward\xe2\x80\x99s statement, with the conviction\r\ngrowing firmer and firmer in his mind that the statement was a lie, and\r\nthat his wife was concerned in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the major in Norfolk?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cor is he near his daughter in\r\nLondon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Norfolk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bashwood. Having answered Allan\xe2\x80\x99s look of\r\ninquiry, instead of Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s spoken question, in those words, he\r\nhesitated, looked Midwinter in the face for the first time, and added,\r\nsuddenly: \xe2\x80\x9cI object, if you please, to be cross-examined, sir. I know\r\nwhat I have told Mr. Armadale, and I know no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words, and the voice in which they were spoken, were alike at\r\nvariance with Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s usual language and Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s usual\r\ntone. There was a sullen depression in his face--there was a furtive\r\ndistrust and dislike in his eyes when they looked at Midwinter, which\r\nMidwinter himself now noticed for the first time. Before he could answer\r\nthe steward\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary outbreak, Allan interfered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think me impatient,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s getting late; it\xe2\x80\x99s a long\r\nway to Hampstead. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid the Sanitarium will be shut up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter started. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not going to the Sanitarium to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nAllan took his friend\xe2\x80\x99s hand and wrung it hard. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were as fond of\r\nher as I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would take no rest, you could get no\r\nsleep, till you had seen the doctor, and heard the best and the worst he\r\nhad to tell you. Poor dear little soul! who knows, if she could only see\r\nme alive and well--\xe2\x80\x9d The tears came into his eyes, and he turned away\r\nhis head in silence.\r\n\r\nMidwinter looked at the steward. \xe2\x80\x9cStand back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak\r\nto Mr. Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d There was something in his eye which it was not safe\r\nto trifle with. Mr. Bashwood drew back out of hearing, but not out of\r\nsight. Midwinter laid his hand fondly on his friend\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have reasons--\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped. Could the reasons be\r\ngiven before he had fairly realized them himself; at that time, too,\r\nand under those circumstances? Impossible! \xe2\x80\x9cI have reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor advising you not to believe too readily what Mr. Bashwood may say.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell him this, but take the warning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllan looked at his friend in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was you who always liked\r\nMr. Bashwood!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was you who trusted him, when he first\r\ncame to the great house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I was wrong, Allan, and perhaps you were right. Will you only\r\nwait till we can telegraph to Major Milroy and get his answer? Will you\r\nonly wait over the night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go mad if I wait over the night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have made\r\nme more anxious than I was before. If I am not to speak about it to\r\nBashwood, I must and will go to the Sanitarium, and find out whether she\r\nis or is not there, from the doctor himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter saw that it was useless. In Allan\xe2\x80\x99s interests there was only\r\none other course left to take. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me go with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s face brightened for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cYou dear, good fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the very thing I was going to beg of you myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter beckoned to the steward. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale is going to the\r\nSanitarium,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I mean to accompany him. Get a cab and come\r\nwith us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited, to see whether Mr. Bashwood would comply. Having been\r\nstrictly ordered, when Allan did arrive, not to lose sight of him,\r\nand having, in his own interests, Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected appearance\r\nto explain to Miss Gwilt, the steward had no choice but to comply.\r\nIn sullen submission he did as he had been told. The keys of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbaggage was given to the foreign traveling servant whom he had brought\r\nwith him, and the man was instructed to wait his master\xe2\x80\x99s orders at\r\nthe terminus hotel. In a minute more the cab was on its way out of the\r\nstation--with Midwinter and Allan inside, and Mr. Bashwood by the driver\r\non the box.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nBetween eleven and twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock that night, Miss Gwilt, standing alone\r\nat the window which lit the corridor of the Sanitarium on the second\r\nfloor, heard the roll of wheels coming toward her. The sound, gathering\r\nrapidly in volume through the silence of the lonely neighborhood,\r\nstopped at the iron gates. In another minute she saw the cab draw up\r\nbeneath her, at the house door.\r\n\r\nThe earlier night had been cloudy, but the sky was clearing now and the\r\nmoon was out. She opened the window to see and hear more clearly. By the\r\nlight of the moon she saw Allan get out of the cab, and turn round to\r\nspeak to some other person inside. The answering voice told her, before\r\nhe appeared in his turn, that Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s companion was her husband.\r\n\r\nThe same petrifying influence that had fallen on her at the interview\r\nwith him of the previous day fell on her now. She stood by the window,\r\nwhite and still, and haggard and old--as she had stood when she first\r\nfaced him in her widow\xe2\x80\x99s weeds.\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood, stealing up alone to the second floor to make his report,\r\nknew, the instant he set eyes on her, that the report was needless.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault,\xe2\x80\x9d was all he said, as she slowly turned her head and\r\nlooked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cThey met together, and there was no parting them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew a long breath, and motioned him to be silent. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a little,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI know all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning from him at those words, she slowly paced the corridor to its\r\nfurthest end; turned, and slowly came back to him with frowning brow\r\nand drooping head--with all the grace and beauty gone from her, but the\r\ninbred grace and beauty in the movement of her limbs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to speak to me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked; her mind far away from him, and\r\nher eyes looking at him vacantly as she put the question.\r\n\r\nHe roused his courage as he had never roused it in her presence yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t drive me to despair!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, with a startling abruptness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look at me in that way, now I have found it out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you found out?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a momentary surprise on her\r\nface, which faded from it again before he could gather breath enough to\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Armadale is not the man who took you away from me,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Midwinter is the man. I found it out in your face yesterday. I\r\nsee it in your face now. Why did you sign your name \xe2\x80\x98Armadale\xe2\x80\x99 when you\r\nwrote to me? Why do you call yourself \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99 still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke those bold words at long intervals, with an effort to resist\r\nher influence over him, pitiable and terrible to see.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for the first time with softened eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had\r\npitied you when we first met,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gently, \xe2\x80\x9cas I pity you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe struggled desperately to go on and say the words to her which he had\r\nstrung himself to the pitch of saying on the drive from the terminus.\r\nThey were words which hinted darkly at his knowledge of her past life;\r\nwords which warned her--do what else she might, commit what crimes she\r\npleased--to think twice before she deceived and deserted him again. In\r\nthose terms he had vowed to himself to address her. He had the phrases\r\npicked and chosen; he had the sentences ranged and ordered in his mind;\r\nnothing was wanting but to make the one crowning effort of speaking\r\nthem--and, even now, after all he had said and all he had dared, the\r\neffort was more than he could compass! In helpless gratitude, even for\r\nso little as her pity, he stood looking at her, and wept the silent,\r\nwomanish tears that fall from old men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nShe took his hand and spoke to him--with marked forbearance, but without\r\nthe slightest sign of emotion on her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have waited already at my request,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till to-morrow,\r\nand you will know all. If you trust nothing else that I have told you,\r\nyou may trust what I tell you now. _It will end to-night_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she said the words, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s step was heard on the stairs. Mr.\r\nBashwood drew back from her, with his heart beating fast in unutterable\r\nexpectation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will end to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated to himself, under his\r\nbreath, as he moved away toward the far end of the corridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me disturb you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, cheerfully, as they\r\nmet. \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to say to Mrs. Armadale but what you or anybody may\r\nhear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood went on, without answering, to the far end of the corridor,\r\nstill repeating to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cIt will end to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d The doctor, passing\r\nhim in the opposite direction, joined Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, in his blandest manner and his\r\nroundest tones, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Armadale has arrived. Permit me to add, my\r\ndear lady, that there is not the least reason for any nervous agitation\r\non your part. He has been carefully humored, and he is as quiet and\r\nmanageable as his best friends could wish. I have informed him that it\r\nis impossible to allow him an interview with the young lady to-night;\r\nbut that he may count on seeing her (with the proper precautions) at the\r\nearliest propitious hour, after she is awake to-morrow morning. As there\r\nis no hotel near, and as the propitious hour may occur at a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, it was clearly incumbent on me, under the peculiar\r\ncircumstances, to offer him the hospitality of the Sanitarium. He has\r\naccepted it with the utmost gratitude; and has thanked me in a most\r\ngentlemanly and touching manner for the pains I have taken to set his\r\nmind at ease. Perfectly gratifying, perfectly satisfactory, so far! But\r\nthere has been a little hitch--now happily got over--which I think it\r\nright to mention to you before we all retire for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving paved the way in those words (and in Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s hearing) for\r\nthe statement which he had previously announced his intention of making,\r\nin the event of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s dying in the Sanitarium, the doctor was about\r\nto proceed, when his attention was attracted by a sound below like the\r\ntrying of a door.\r\n\r\nHe instantly descended the stairs, and unlocked the door of\r\ncommunication between the first and second floors, which he had locked\r\nbehind him on his way up. But the person who had tried the door--if such\r\na person there really had been--was too quick for him. He looked along\r\nthe corridor, and over the staircase into the hall, and, discovering\r\nnothing, returned to Miss Gwilt, after securing the door of\r\ncommunication behind him once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I heard something downstairs. With\r\nregard to the little hitch that I adverted to just now, permit me to\r\ninform you that Mr. Armadale has brought a friend here with him, who\r\nbears the strange name of Midwinter. Do you know the gentleman at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n asked the doctor, with a suspicious anxiety in his eyes, which strangely\r\nbelied the elaborate indifference of his tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know him to be an old friend of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes\r\nhe--?\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice failed her, and her eyes fell before the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsteady scrutiny. She mastered the momentary weakness, and finished her\r\nquestion. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he, too, stay here to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Midwinter is a person of coarse manners and suspicious temper,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n rejoined the doctor, steadily watching her. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was rude enough\r\nto insist on staying here as soon as Mr. Armadale had accepted my\r\ninvitation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused to note the effect of those words on her. Left utterly in the\r\ndark by the caution with which she had avoided mentioning her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassumed name to him at their first interview, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s distrust of\r\nher was necessarily of the vaguest kind. He had heard her voice\r\nfail her--he had seen her color change. He suspected her of a mental\r\nreservation on the subject of Midwinter--and of nothing more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you permit him to have his way?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIn your place, I\r\nshould have shown him the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe impenetrable composure of her tone warned the doctor that her\r\nself-command was not to be further shaken that night. He resumed the\r\ncharacter of Mrs. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s medical referee on the subject of Mr.\r\nArmadale\xe2\x80\x99s mental health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had only had my own feelings to consult,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndisguise from you that I should (as you say) have shown Mr. Midwinter\r\nthe door. But on appealing to Mr. Armadale, I found he was himself\r\nanxious not to be parted from his friend. Under those circumstances,\r\nbut one alternative was left--the alternative of humoring him again.\r\nThe responsibility of thwarting him--to say nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d added the doctor,\r\ndrifting for a moment toward the truth, \xe2\x80\x9cof my natural apprehension,\r\nwith such a temper as his friend\xe2\x80\x99s, of a scandal and disturbance in the\r\nhouse--was not to be thought of for a moment. Mr. Midwinter accordingly\r\nremains here for the night; and occupies (I ought to say, insists on\r\noccupying) the next room to Mr. Armadale. Advise me, my dear madam, in\r\nthis emergency,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the doctor, with his loudest emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nrooms shall we put them in, on the first floor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut Mr. Armadale in Number Four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd his friend next to him, in Number Three?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cWell!\r\nwell! well! perhaps they _are_ the most comfortable rooms. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give\r\nmy orders immediately. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hurry away, Mr. Bashwood,\xe2\x80\x9d he called out,\r\ncheerfully, as he reached the top of the staircase. \xe2\x80\x9cI have left the\r\nassistant physician\xe2\x80\x99s key on the window-sill yonder, and Mrs. Armadale\r\ncan let you out at the staircase door whenever she pleases. Don\xe2\x80\x99t sit up\r\nlate, Mrs. Armadale! Yours is a nervous system that requires plenty of\r\nsleep. \xe2\x80\x98Tired nature\xe2\x80\x99s sweet restorer, balmy sleep.\xe2\x80\x99 Grand line! God\r\nbless you--good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood came back from the far end of the corridor--still\r\npondering, in unutterable expectation, on what was to come with the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to go now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You are to stay. I said you should know all if you waited till the\r\nmorning. Wait here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, and looked about him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d he faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought the doctor said--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor will interfere with nothing that I do in this house\r\nto-night. I tell you to stay. There are empty rooms on the floor above\r\nthis. Take one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood felt the trembling fit coming on him again as he looked at\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask--?\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk nothing. I want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you please to tell me--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you nothing till the night is over and the morning has\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis curiosity conquered his fear. He persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it something dreadful?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cToo dreadful to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stamped her foot with a sudden outbreak of impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, snatching the key of the staircase door from the window-sill.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do quite right to distrust me--you do quite right to follow me no\r\nfurther in the dark. Go before the house is shut up. I can do without\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d She led the way to the stairs, with the key in one hand, and the\r\ncandle in the other.\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood followed her in silence. No one, knowing what he knew of\r\nher earlier life, could have failed to perceive that she was a woman\r\ndriven to the last extremity, and standing consciously on the brink of a\r\nCrime. In the first terror of the discovery, he broke free from the hold\r\nshe had on him: he thought and acted like a man who had a will of his\r\nown again.\r\n\r\nShe put the key in the door, and turned to him before she opened it,\r\nwith the light of the candle on her face. \xe2\x80\x9cForget me, and forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe meet no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened the door, and, standing inside it, after he had passed her,\r\ngave him her hand. He had resisted her look, he had resisted her words,\r\nbut the magnetic fascination of her touch conquered him at the final\r\nmoment. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t leave you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding helplessly by the hand she\r\nhad given him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and see,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, without allowing him an instant to\r\nreflect.\r\n\r\nClosing her hand firmly on his, she led him along the first floor\r\ncorridor to the room numbered Four. \xe2\x80\x9cNotice that room,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\nAfter a look over the stairs to see that they were alone, she retraced\r\nher steps with him to the opposite extremity of the corridor. Here,\r\nfacing the window which lit the place at the other end, was one little\r\nroom, with a narrow grating in the higher part of the door, intended for\r\nthe sleeping apartment of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s deputy. From the position of this\r\nroom, the grating commanded a view of the bed-chambers down each side of\r\nthe corridor, and so enabled the deputy-physician to inform himself of\r\nany irregular proceedings on the part of the patients under his care,\r\nwith little or no chance of being detected in watching them. Miss Gwilt\r\nopened the door and led the way into the empty room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile I go back upstairs; and lock yourself in,\r\nif you like. You will be in the dark, but the gas will be burning in the\r\ncorridor. Keep at the grating, and make sure that Mr. Armadale goes into\r\nthe room I have just pointed out to you, and that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave it\r\nafterward. If you lose sight of the room for a single moment before I\r\ncome back, you will repent it to the end of your life. If you do as I\r\ntell you, you shall see me to-morrow, and claim your own reward. Quick\r\nwith your answer! Is it Yes or No?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could make no reply in words. He raised her hand to his lips, and\r\nkissed it rapturously. She left him in the room. From his place at the\r\ngrating he saw her glide down the corridor to the staircase door. She\r\npassed through it, and locked it. Then there was silence.\r\n\r\nThe next sound was the sound of the women-servants\xe2\x80\x99 voices. Two of them\r\ncame up to put the sheets on the beds in Number Three and Number Four.\r\nThe women were in high good-humor, laughing and talking to each other\r\nthrough the open doors of the rooms. The master\xe2\x80\x99s customers were coming\r\nin at last, they said, with a vengeance; the house would soon begin to\r\nlook cheerful, if things went on like this.\r\n\r\nAfter a little, the beds were got ready and the women returned to the\r\nkitchen floor, on which the sleeping-rooms of the domestic servants were\r\nall situated. Then there was silence again.\r\n\r\nThe next sound was the sound of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s voice. He appeared at the\r\nend of the corridor, showing Allan and Midwinter the way to their rooms.\r\nThey all went together into Number Four. After a little, the doctor\r\ncame out first. He waited till Midwinter joined him, and pointed with\r\na formal bow to the door of Number Three. Midwinter entered the room\r\nwithout speaking, and shut himself in. The doctor, left alone, withdrew\r\nto the staircase door and unlocked it, then waited in the corridor,\r\nwhistling to himself softly, under his breath.\r\n\r\nVoices pitched cautiously low became audible in a minute more in the\r\nhall. The Resident Dispenser and the Head Nurse appeared, on their way\r\nto the dormitories of the attendants at the top of the house. The man\r\nbowed silently, and passed the doctor; the woman courtesied silently,\r\nand followed the man. The doctor acknowledged their salutations by a\r\ncourteous wave of his hand; and, once more left alone, paused a moment,\r\nstill whistling softly to himself, then walked to the door of Number\r\nFour, and opened the case of the fumigating apparatus fixed near it\r\nin the corner of the wall. As he lifted the lid and looked in, his\r\nwhistling ceased. He took a long purple bottle out, examined it by the\r\ngas-light, put it back, and closed the case. This done, he advanced on\r\ntiptoe to the open staircase door, passed through it, and secured it on\r\nthe inner side as usual.\r\n\r\nMr. Bashwood had seen him at the apparatus; Mr. Bashwood had noticed the\r\nmanner of his withdrawal through the staircase door. Again the sense of\r\nan unutterable expectation throbbed at his heart. A terror that was slow\r\nand cold and deadly crept into his hands, and guided them in the dark\r\nto the key that had been left for him in the inner side of the door. He\r\nturned it in vague distrust of what might happen next, and waited.\r\n\r\nThe slow minutes passed, and nothing happened. The silence was horrible;\r\nthe solitude of the lonely corridor was a solitude of invisible\r\ntreacheries. He began to count to keep his mind employed--to keep his\r\nown growing dread away from him. The numbers, as he whispered them,\r\nfollowed each other slowly up to a hundred, and still nothing happened.\r\nHe had begun the second hundred; he had got on to twenty--when, without\r\na sound to betray that he had been moving in his room, Midwinter\r\nsuddenly appeared in the corridor.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment and listened; he went to the stairs and looked\r\nover into the hall beneath. Then, for the second time that night, he\r\ntried the staircase door, and for the second time found it fast. After\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, he tried the doors of the bedrooms on his right\r\nhand next, looked into one after the other, and saw that they were\r\nempty, then came to the door of the end room in which the steward was\r\nconcealed. Here, again, the lock resisted him. He listened, and looked\r\nup at the grating. No sound was to be heard, no light was to be seen\r\ninside. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I break the door in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cand make sure?\r\nNo; it would be giving the doctor an excuse for turning me out of the\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d He moved away, and looked into the two empty rooms in the\r\nrow occupied by Allan and himself, then walked to the window at the\r\nstaircase end of the corridor. Here the case of the fumigating apparatus\r\nattracted his attention. After trying vainly to open it, his suspicion\r\nseemed to be aroused. He searched back along the corridor, and observed\r\nthat no object of a similar kind appeared outside any of the other\r\nbed-chambers. Again at the window, he looked again at the apparatus, and\r\nturned away from it with a gesture which plainly indicated that he had\r\ntried, and failed, to guess what it might be.\r\n\r\nBaffled at all points, he still showed no sign of returning to his\r\nbed-chamber. He stood at the window, with his eyes fixed on the door of\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s room, thinking. If Mr. Bashwood, furtively watching him through\r\nthe grating, could have seen him at that moment in the mind as well as\r\nin the body, Mr. Bashwood\xe2\x80\x99s heart might have throbbed even faster than\r\nit was throbbing now, in expectation of the next event which Midwinter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndecision of the next minute was to bring forth.\r\n\r\nOn what was his mind occupied as he stood alone, at the dead of night,\r\nin the strange house?\r\n\r\nHis mind was occupied in drawing its disconnected impressions together,\r\nlittle by little, to one point. Convinced from the first that some\r\nhidden danger threatened Allan in the Sanitarium, his distrust--vaguely\r\nassociated, thus far, with the place itself; with his wife (whom he\r\nfirmly believed to be now under the same roof with him); with\r\nthe doctor, who was as plainly in her confidence as Mr. Bashwood\r\nhimself--now narrowed its range, and centered itself obstinately in\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s room. Resigning all further effort to connect his suspicion of a\r\nconspiracy against his friend with the outrage which had the day before\r\nbeen offered to himself--an effort which would have led him, if he could\r\nhave maintained it, to a discovery of the fraud really contemplated\r\nby his wife--his mind, clouded and confused by disturbing influences,\r\ninstinctively took refuge in its impressions of facts as they had\r\nshown themselves since he had entered the house. Everything that he had\r\nnoticed below stairs suggested that there was some secret purpose to be\r\nanswered by getting Allan to sleep in the Sanitarium. Everything that\r\nhe had noticed above stairs associated the lurking-place in which the\r\ndanger lay hid with Allan\xe2\x80\x99s room. To reach this conclusion, and to\r\ndecide on baffling the conspiracy, whatever it might be, by taking\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s place, was with Midwinter the work of an instant. Confronted by\r\nactual peril, the great nature of the man intuitively freed itself from\r\nthe weaknesses that had beset it in happier and safer times. Not even\r\nthe shadow of the old superstition rested on his mind now--no fatalist\r\nsuspicion of himself disturbed the steady resolution that was in\r\nhim. The one last doubt that troubled him, as he stood at the window\r\nthinking, was the doubt whether he could persuade Allan to change rooms\r\nwith him, without involving himself in an explanation which might lead\r\nAllan to suspect the truth.\r\n\r\nIn the minute that elapsed, while he waited with his eyes on the room,\r\nthe doubt was resolved--he found the trivial, yet sufficient, excuse of\r\nwhich he was in search. Mr. Bashwood saw him rouse himself and go to the\r\ndoor. Mr. Bashwood heard him knock softly, and whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cAllan, are you\r\nin bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the voice inside; \xe2\x80\x9ccome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe appeared to be on the point of entering the room, when he checked\r\nhimself as if he had suddenly remembered something. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, through the door, and, turning away, went straight to the end\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is anybody watching us in there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9clet\r\nhim watch us through this!\xe2\x80\x9d He took out his handkerchief, and stuffed it\r\ninto the wires of the grating, so as completely to close the aperture.\r\nHaving thus forced the spy inside (if there was one) either to betray\r\nhimself by moving the handkerchief, or to remain blinded to all view of\r\nwhat might happen next, Midwinter presented himself in Allan\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what poor nerves I have,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand what a wretched\r\nsleeper I am at the best of times. I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep to-night. The window in\r\nmy room rattles every time the wind blows. I wish it was as fast as your\r\nwindow here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a rattling window. Let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchange rooms. Nonsense! Why should you make excuses to _me_? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nknow how easily trifles upset those excitable nerves of yours? Now the\r\ndoctor has quieted my mind about my poor little Neelie, I begin to\r\nfeel the journey; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for sleeping anywhere till to-morrow\r\ncomes.\xe2\x80\x9d He took up his traveling-bag. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must be quick about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, pointing to his candle. \xe2\x80\x9cThey haven\xe2\x80\x99t left me much candle to go\r\nto bed by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe very quiet, Allan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, opening the door for him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t disturb the house at this time of night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Allan, in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night; I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsleep as well as I shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwinter saw him into Number Three, and noticed that his own candle\r\n(which he had left there) was as short as Allan\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, and came out again into the corridor.\r\n\r\nHe went straight to the grating, and looked and listened once more. The\r\nhandkerchief remained exactly as he had left it, and still there was\r\nno sound to be heard within. He returned slowly along the corridor, and\r\nthought of the precautions he had taken, for the last time. Was there\r\nno other way than the way he was trying now? There was none. Any openly\r\navowed posture of defense--while the nature of the danger, and the\r\nquarter from which it might come, were alike unknown--would be useless\r\nin itself, and worse than useless in the consequences which it might\r\nproduce by putting the people of the house on their guard. Without a\r\nfact that could justify to other minds his distrust of what might happen\r\nwith the night, incapable of shaking Allan\xe2\x80\x99s ready faith in the fair\r\noutside which the doctor had presented to him, the one safeguard in\r\nhis friend\xe2\x80\x99s interests that Midwinter could set up was the safeguard of\r\nchanging the rooms--the one policy he could follow, come what might of\r\nit, was the policy of waiting for events. \xe2\x80\x9cI can trust to one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said to himself, as he looked for the last time up and down the\r\ncorridor--\xe2\x80\x9cI can trust myself to keep awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a glance at the clock on the wall opposite, he went into Number\r\nFour. The sound of the closing door was heard, the sound of the turning\r\nlock followed it. Then the dead silence fell over the house once more.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, the steward\xe2\x80\x99s horror of the stillness and the darkness\r\novercame his dread of moving the handkerchief. He cautiously drew aside\r\none corner of it, waited, looked, and took courage at last to draw the\r\nwhole handkerchief through the wires of the grating. After first hiding\r\nit in his pocket, he thought of the consequences if it was found on him,\r\nand threw it down in a corner of the room. He trembled when he had cast\r\nit from him, as he looked at his watch and placed himself again at the\r\ngrating to wait for Miss Gwilt.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter to one. The moon had come round from the side to the\r\nfront of the Sanitarium. From time to time her light gleamed on the\r\nwindow of the corridor when the gaps in the flying clouds let it\r\nthrough. The wind had risen, and sung its mournful song faintly, as it\r\nswept at intervals over the desert ground in front of the house.\r\n\r\nThe minute hand of the clock traveled on halfway round the circle of the\r\ndial. As it touched the quarter-past one, Miss Gwilt stepped noiselessly\r\ninto the corridor. \xe2\x80\x9cLet yourself out,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered through the\r\ngrating, \xe2\x80\x9cand follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d She returned to the stairs by which she\r\nhad just descended, pushed the door to softly after Mr. Bashwood had\r\nfollowed her and led the way up to the landing of the second floor.\r\nThere she put the question to him which she had not ventured to put\r\nbelow stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas Mr. Armadale shown into Number Four?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe bowed his head without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me in words. Has Mr. Armadale left the room since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never lost sight of Number Four since I left you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered, \xe2\x80\x9c_Never_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething strange in his manner, something unfamiliar in his voice, as\r\nhe made that last reply, attracted her attention. She took her candle\r\nfrom a table near, on which she had left it, and threw its light on\r\nhim. His eyes were staring, his teeth chattered. There was everything to\r\nbetray him to her as a terrified man; there was nothing to tell her that\r\nthe terror was caused by his consciousness of deceiving her, for the\r\nfirst time in his life, to her face. If she had threatened him less\r\nopenly when she placed him on the watch; if she had spoken less\r\nunreservedly of the interview which was to reward him in the morning,\r\nhe might have owned the truth. As it was, his strongest fears and his\r\ndearest hopes were alike interested in telling her the fatal lie that\r\nhe had now told--the fatal lie which he reiterated when she put her\r\nquestion for the second time.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, deceived by the last man on earth whom she would have\r\nsuspected of deception--the man whom she had deceived herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be overexcited,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe night has been too\r\nmuch for you. Go upstairs, and rest. You will find the door of one of\r\nthe rooms left open. That is the room you are to occupy. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put the candle (which she had left burning for him) on the table,\r\nand gave him her hand. He held her back by it desperately as she turned\r\nto leave him. His horror of what might happen when she was left by\r\nherself forced the words to his lips which he would have feared to speak\r\nto her at any other time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded, in a whisper; \xe2\x80\x9coh, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\ndownstairs to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe released her hand, and signed to him to take the candle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall\r\nsee me to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a word more now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer stronger will conquered him at that last moment, as it had conquered\r\nhim throughout. He took the candle and waited, following her eagerly\r\nwith his eyes as she descended the stairs. The cold of the December\r\nnight seemed to have found its way to her through the warmth of the\r\nhouse. She had put on a long, heavy black shawl, and had fastened it\r\nclose over her breast. The plaited coronet in which she wore her hair\r\nseemed to have weighed too heavily on her head. She had untwisted it,\r\nand thrown it back over her shoulders. The old man looked at her flowing\r\nhair, as it lay red over the black shawl--at her supple, long-fingered\r\nhand, as it slid down the banisters--at the smooth, seductive grace of\r\nevery movement that took her further and further away from him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nnight will go quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, as she passed from his view;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall dream of her till the morning comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe secured the staircase door, after she had passed through\r\nit--listened, and satisfied herself that nothing was stirring--then went\r\non slowly along the corridor to the window. Leaning on the window-sill,\r\nshe looked out at the night. The clouds were over the moon at that\r\nmoment; nothing was to be seen through the darkness but the scattered\r\ngas-lights in the suburb. Turning from the window, she looked at the\r\nclock. It was twenty minutes past one.\r\n\r\nFor the last time, the resolution that had come to her in the earlier\r\nnight, with the knowledge that her husband was in the house, forced\r\nitself uppermost in her mind. For the last time, the voice within her\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cThink if there is no other way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pondered over it till the minute-hand of the clock pointed to the\r\nhalf-hour. \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still thinking of her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cThe one\r\nchance left is to go through with it to the end. He will leave the thing\r\nundone which he has come here to do; he will leave the words unspoken\r\nwhich he has come here to say--when he knows that the act may make me\r\na public scandal, and that the words may send me to the scaffold!\xe2\x80\x9d Her\r\ncolor rose, and she smiled with a terrible irony as she looked for the\r\nfirst time at the door of the Room. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be your widow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cin half an hour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened the case of the apparatus and took the Purple Flask in her\r\nhand. After marking the time by a glance at the clock, she dropped\r\ninto the glass funnel the first of the six separate Pourings that were\r\nmeasured for her by the paper slips.\r\n\r\nWhen she had put the Flask back, she listened at the mouth of the\r\nfunnel. Not a sound reached her ear: the deadly process did its work in\r\nthe silence of death itself. When she rose and looked up the moon was\r\nshining in at the window, and the moaning wind was quiet.\r\n\r\nOh, the time! the time! If it could only have been begun and ended with\r\nthe first Pouring!\r\n\r\nShe went downstairs into the hall; she walked to and fro, and listened\r\nat the open door that led to the kitchen stairs. She came up again; she\r\nwent down again. The first of the intervals of five minutes was endless.\r\nThe time stood still. The suspense was maddening.\r\n\r\nThe interval passed. As she took the Flask for the second time, and\r\ndropped in the second Pouring, the clouds floated over the moon, and the\r\nnight view through the window slowly darkened.\r\n\r\nThe restlessness that had driven her up and down the stairs, and\r\nbackward and forward in the hall, left her as suddenly as it had come.\r\nShe waited through the second interval, leaning on the window-sill, and\r\nstaring, without conscious thought of any kind, into the black night.\r\nThe howling of a belated dog was borne toward her on the wind, at\r\nintervals, from some distant part of the suburb. She found herself\r\nfollowing the faint sound as it died away into silence with a dull\r\nattention, and listening for its coming again with an expectation\r\nthat was duller still. Her arms lay like lead on the window-sill; her\r\nforehead rested against the glass without feeling the cold. It was not\r\ntill the moon struggled out again that she was startled into sudden\r\nself-remembrance. She turned quickly, and looked at the clock; seven\r\nminutes had passed since the second Pouring.\r\n\r\nAs she snatched up the Flask, and fed the funnel for the third time,\r\nthe full consciousness of her position came back to her. The fever-heat\r\nthrobbed again in her blood, and flushed fiercely in her cheeks. Swift,\r\nsmooth, and noiseless, she paced from end to end of the corridor, with\r\nher arms folded in her shawl and her eye moment after moment on the\r\nclock.\r\n\r\nThree out of the next five minutes passed, and again the suspense began\r\nto madden her. The space in the corridor grew too confined for the\r\nillimitable restlessness that possessed her limbs. She went down into\r\nthe hall again, and circled round and round it like a wild creature in\r\na cage. At the third turn, she felt something moving softly against her\r\ndress. The house-cat had come up through the open kitchen door--a large,\r\ntawny, companionable cat that purred in high good temper, and followed\r\nher for company. She took the animal up in her arms--it rubbed its\r\nsleek head luxuriously against her chin as she bent her face over it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale hates cats,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered in the creature\xe2\x80\x99s ear. \xe2\x80\x9cCome up and\r\nsee Armadale killed!\xe2\x80\x9d The next moment her own frightful fancy horrified\r\nher. She dropped the cat with a shudder; she drove it below again with\r\nthreatening hands. For a moment after, she stood still, then in headlong\r\nhaste suddenly mounted the stairs. Her husband had forced his way back\r\nagain into her thoughts; her husband threatened her with a danger which\r\nhad never entered her mind till now. What if he were not asleep? What if\r\nhe came out upon her, and found her with the Purple Flask in her hand?\r\n\r\nShe stole to the door of Number Three and listened. The slow, regular\r\nbreathing of a sleeping man was just audible. After waiting a moment to\r\nlet the feeling of relief quiet her, she took a step toward Number\r\nFour, and checked herself. It was needless to listen at _that_ door.\r\nThe doctor had told her that Sleep came first, as certainly as Death\r\nafterward, in the poisoned air. She looked aside at the clock. The time\r\nhad come for the fourth Pouring.\r\n\r\nHer hand began to tremble violently as she fed the funnel for the fourth\r\ntime. The fear of her husband was back again in her heart. What if\r\nsome noise disturbed him before the sixth Pouring? What if he woke on\r\na sudden (as she had often seen him wake) without any noise at all? She\r\nlooked up and down the corridor. The end room, in which Mr. Bashwood had\r\nbeen concealed, offered itself to her as a place of refuge. \xe2\x80\x9cI might go\r\nin there!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he left the key?\xe2\x80\x9d She opened the door to\r\nlook, and saw the handkerchief thrown down on the floor. Was it Mr.\r\nBashwood\xe2\x80\x99s handkerchief, left there by accident? She examined it at the\r\ncorners. In the second corner she found her husband\xe2\x80\x99s name!\r\n\r\nHer first impulse hurried her to the staircase door, to rouse the\r\nsteward and insist on an explanation. The next moment she remembered the\r\nPurple Flask, and the danger of leaving the corridor. She turned, and\r\nlooked at the door of Number Three. Her husband, on the evidence of the\r\nhandkerchief had unquestionably been out of his room--and Mr. Bashwood\r\nhad not told her. Was he in his room now? In the violence of her\r\nagitation, as the question passed through her mind, she forgot the\r\ndiscovery which she had herself made not a minute before. Again she\r\nlistened at the door; again she heard the slow, regular breathing of the\r\nsleeping man. The first time the evidence of her ears had been enough to\r\nquiet her; _this_ time, in the tenfold aggravation of her suspicion and\r\nher alarm, she was determined to have the evidence of her eyes as well.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the doors open softly in this house,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno fear of my waking him.\xe2\x80\x9d Noiselessly, by an inch at a time, she\r\nopened the unlocked door, and looked in the moment the aperture was wide\r\nenough. In the little light she had let into the room, the sleeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead was just visible on the pillow. Was it quite as dark against the\r\nwhite pillow as her husband\xe2\x80\x99s head looked when he was in bed? Was the\r\nbreathing as light as her husband\xe2\x80\x99s breathing when he was asleep?\r\n\r\nShe opened the door more widely, and looked in by the clearer light.\r\n\r\nThere lay the man whose life she had attempted for the third time,\r\npeacefully sleeping in the room that had been given to her husband, and\r\nin the air that could harm nobody!\r\n\r\nThe inevitable conclusion overwhelmed her on the instant. With a frantic\r\nupward action of her hands she staggered back into the passage. The door\r\nof Allan\xe2\x80\x99s room fell to, but not noisily enough to wake him. She turned\r\nas she heard it close. For one moment she stood staring at it like a\r\nwoman stupefied. The next, her instinct rushed into action, before her\r\nreason recovered itself. In two steps she was at the door of Number\r\nFour.\r\n\r\nThe door was locked.\r\n\r\nShe felt over the wall with both hands, wildly and clumsily, for the\r\nbutton which she had seen the doctor press when he was showing the room\r\nto the visitors. Twice she missed it. The third time her eyes helped her\r\nhands; she found the button and pressed on it. The mortise of the lock\r\ninside fell back, and the door yielded to her.\r\n\r\nWithout an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation she entered the room. Though the door\r\nwas open--though so short a time had elapsed since the fourth Pouring\r\nthat but little more than half the contemplated volume of gas had been\r\nproduced as yet--the poisoned air seized her, like the grasp of a hand\r\nat her throat, like the twisting of a wire round her head. She found him\r\non the floor at the foot of the bed: his head and one arm were toward\r\nthe door, as if he had risen under the first feeling of drowsiness,\r\nand had sunk in the effort to leave the room. With the desperate\r\nconcentration of strength of which women are capable in emergencies, she\r\nlifted him and dragged him out into the corridor. Her brain reeled as\r\nshe laid him down, and crawled back on her knees to the room to shut out\r\nthe poisoned air from pursuing them into the passage. After closing the\r\ndoor, she waited, without daring to look at him the while, for strength\r\nenough to rise and get to the window over the stairs. When the window\r\nwas opened, when the keen air of the early winter morning blew steadily\r\nin, she ventured back to him and raised his head, and looked for the\r\nfirst time closely at his face.\r\n\r\nWas it death that spread the livid pallor over his forehead and his\r\ncheeks, and the dull leaden hue on his eyelids and his lips?\r\n\r\nShe loosened his cravat and opened his waistcoat, and bared his throat\r\nand breast to the air. With her hand on his heart, with her bosom\r\nsupporting his head, so that he fronted the window, she waited the\r\nevent. A time passed: a time short enough to be reckoned by minutes\r\non the clock; and yet long enough to take her memory back over all her\r\nmarried life with him--long enough to mature the resolution that now\r\nrose in her mind as the one result that could come of the retrospect. As\r\nher eyes rested on him, a strange composure settled slowly on her face.\r\nShe bore the look of a woman who was equally resigned to welcome the\r\nchance of his recovery, or to accept the certainty of his death.\r\n\r\nNot a cry or a tear had escaped her yet. Not a cry or a tear escaped her\r\nwhen the interval had passed, and she felt the first faint fluttering of\r\nhis heart, and heard the first faint catching of the breath of his lips.\r\nShe silently bent over him and kissed his forehead. When she looked up\r\nagain, the hard despair had melted from her face. There was something\r\nsoftly radiant in her eyes, which lit her whole countenance as with an\r\ninner light, and made her womanly and lovely once more.\r\n\r\nShe laid him down, and, taking off her shawl, made a pillow of it to\r\nsupport his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt might have been hard, love,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she felt\r\nthe faint pulsation strengthening at his heart. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have made it easy\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, and, turning from him, noticed the Purple Flask in the place\r\nwhere she had left it since the fourth Pouring. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought,\r\nquietly, \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten my best friend--I had forgotten that there is\r\nmore to pour in yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a steady hand, with a calm, attentive face, she fed the funnel\r\nfor the fifth time. \xe2\x80\x9cFive minutes more,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when she had put the\r\nFlask back, after a look at the clock.\r\n\r\nShe fell into thought--thought that only deepened the grave and gentle\r\ncomposure of her face. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I write him a farewell word?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell him the truth before I leave him forever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer little gold pencil-case hung with the other toys at her watch-chain.\r\nAfter looking about her for a moment, she knelt over her husband and put\r\nher hand into the breast-pocket of his coat.\r\n\r\nHis pocket-book was there. Some papers fell from it as she unfastened\r\nthe clasp. One of them was the letter which had come to him from Mr.\r\nBrock\xe2\x80\x99s death-bed. She turned over the two sheets of note-paper on which\r\nthe rector had written the words that had now come true, and found the\r\nlast page of the last sheet a blank. On that page she wrote her farewell\r\nwords, kneeling at her husband\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am worse than the worst you can think of me. You have saved Armadale\r\nby changing rooms with him to-night; and you have saved him from me. You\r\ncan guess now whose widow I should have claimed to be, if you had not\r\npreserved his life; and you will know what a wretch you married when\r\nyou married the woman who writes these lines. Still, I had some innocent\r\nmoments, and then I loved you dearly. Forget me, my darling, in the love\r\nof a better woman than I am. I might, perhaps, have been that better\r\nwoman myself, if I had not lived a miserable life before you met with\r\nme. It matters little now. The one atonement I can make for all the\r\nwrong I have done you is the atonement of my death. It is not hard\r\nfor me to die, now I know you will live. Even my wickedness has one\r\nmerit--it has not prospered. I have never been a happy woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe folded the letter again, and put it into his hand, to attract his\r\nattention in that way when he came to himself. As she gently closed his\r\nfingers on the paper and looked up, the last minute of the last interval\r\nfaced her, recorded on the clock.\r\n\r\nShe bent over him, and gave him her farewell kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLive, my angel, live!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, tenderly, with her lips just\r\ntouching his. \xe2\x80\x9cAll your life is before you--a happy life, and an honored\r\nlife, if you are freed from _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a last, lingering tenderness, she parted the hair back from his\r\nforehead. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no merit to have loved you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are one of\r\nthe men whom women all like.\xe2\x80\x9d She sighed and left him. It was her last\r\nweakness. She bent her head affirmatively to the clock, as if it had\r\nbeen a living creature speaking to her; and fed the funnel for the last\r\ntime, to the last drop left in the Flask.\r\n\r\nThe waning moon shone in faintly at the window. With her hand on the\r\ndoor of the room, she turned and looked at the light that was slowly\r\nfading out of the murky sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, God, forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Christ, bear witness that I have\r\nsuffered!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne moment more she lingered on the threshold; lingered for her last\r\nlook in this world--and turned that look on _him_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, softly.\r\n\r\nThe door of the room opened, and closed on her. There was an interval of\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThen a sound came dull and sudden, like the sound of a fall.\r\n\r\nThen there was silence again.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe hands of the clock, following their steady course, reckoned the\r\nminutes of the morning as one by one they lapsed away. It was the\r\ntenth minute since the door of the room had opened and closed, before\r\nMidwinter stirred on his pillow, and, struggling to raise himself, felt\r\nthe letter in his hand.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment a key was turned in the staircase door. And the\r\ndoctor, looking expectantly toward the fatal room, saw the Purple Flask\r\non the window-sill, and the prostrate man trying to raise himself from\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. NEWS FROM NORFOLK.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. Pedgift, Senior (Thorpe Ambrose), to Mr. Pedgift, Junior\r\n(Paris)_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh Street, December 20th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR AUGUSTUS--Your letter reached me yesterday. You seem to be\r\nmaking the most of your youth (as you call it) with a vengeance. Well!\r\nenjoy your holiday. I made the most of my youth when I was your age;\r\nand, wonderful to relate, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten it yet!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask me for a good budget of news, and especially for more\r\ninformation about that mysterious business at the Sanitarium.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCuriosity, my dear boy, is a quality which (in our profession\r\nespecially) sometimes leads to great results. I doubt, however, if you\r\nwill find it leading to much on this occasion. All I know of the mystery\r\nof the Sanitarium, I know from Mr. Armadale: and he is entirely in the\r\ndark on more than one point of importance. I have already told you how\r\nthey were entrapped into the house, and how they passed the night\r\nthere. To this I can now add that something did certainly happen to Mr.\r\nMidwinter, which deprived him of consciousness; and that the doctor, who\r\nappears to have been mixed up in the matter, carried things with a high\r\nhand, and insisted on taking his own course in his own Sanitarium. There\r\nis not the least doubt that the miserable woman (however she might have\r\ncome by her death) was found dead--that a coroner\xe2\x80\x99s inquest inquired\r\ninto the circumstances--that the evidence showed her to have entered\r\nthe house as a patient--and that the medical investigation ended in\r\ndiscovering that she had died of apoplexy. My idea is that Mr. Midwinter\r\nhad a motive of his own for not coming forward with the evidence that he\r\nmight have given. I have also reason to suspect that Mr. Armadale,\r\nout of regard for him, followed his lead, and that the verdict at the\r\ninquest (attaching no blame to anybody) proceeded, like many other\r\nverdicts of the same kind, from an entirely superficial investigation of\r\nthe circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe key to the whole mystery is to be found, I firmly believe, in that\r\nwretched woman\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to personate the character of Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwidow when the news of his death appeared in the papers. But what first\r\nset her on this, and by what inconceivable process of deception she\r\ncan have induced Mr. Midwinter to marry her (as the certificate proves)\r\nunder Mr. Armadale\xe2\x80\x99s name, is more than Mr. Armadale himself knows. The\r\npoint was not touched at the inquest, for the simple reason that the\r\ninquest only concerned itself with the circumstances attending her\r\ndeath. Mr. Armadale, at his friend\xe2\x80\x99s request, saw Miss Blanchard, and\r\ninduced her to silence old Darch on the subject of the claim that had\r\nbeen made relating to the widow\xe2\x80\x99s income. As the claim had never been\r\nadmitted, even our stiff-necked brother practitioner consented for once\r\nto do as he was asked. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s statement that his patient was the\r\nwidow of a gentleman named Armadale was accordingly left unchallenged,\r\nand so the matter has been hushed up. She is buried in the great\r\ncemetery, near the place where she died. Nobody but Mr. Midwinter and\r\nMr. Armadale (who insisted on going with him) followed her to the grave;\r\nand nothing has been inscribed on the tombstone but the initial letter\r\nof her Christian name and the date of her death. So, after all the harm\r\nshe has done, she rests at last; and so the two men whom she has injured\r\nhave forgiven her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there more to say on this subject before we leave it? On referring\r\nto your letter, I find you have raised one other point, which may be\r\nworth a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask if there is reason to suppose that the doctor comes out of\r\nthe matter with hands which are really as clean as they look? My dear\r\nAugustus, I believe the doctor to have been at the bottom of more of\r\nthis mischief than we shall ever find out; and to have profited by\r\nthe self-imposed silence of Mr. Midwinter and Mr. Armadale, as rogues\r\nperpetually profit by the misfortunes and necessities of honest men.\r\nIt is an ascertained fact that he connived at the false statement about\r\nMiss Milroy, which entrapped the two gentlemen into his house; and that\r\none circumstance (after my Old Bailey experience) is enough for _me_.\r\nAs to evidence against him, there is not a jot; and as to Retribution\r\novertaking him, I can only say I heartily hope Retribution may prove, in\r\nthe long run, to be the more cunning customer of the two. There is not\r\nmuch prospect of it at present. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s friends and admirers are,\r\nI understand, about to present him with a Testimonial, \xe2\x80\x98expressive of\r\ntheir sympathy under the sad occurrence which has thrown a cloud over\r\nthe opening of his Sanitarium, and of their undiminished confidence in\r\nhis integrity and ability as a medical man.\xe2\x80\x99 We live, Augustus, in an\r\nage eminently favorable to the growth of all roguery which is careful\r\nenough to keep up appearances. In this enlightened nineteenth century, I\r\nlook upon the doctor as one of our rising men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo turn now to pleasanter subjects than Sanitariums, I may tell you\r\nthat Miss Neelie is as good as well again, and is, in my humble opinion,\r\nprettier than ever. She is staying in London under the care of a female\r\nrelative; and Mr. Armadale satisfies her of the fact of his existence\r\n(in case she should forget it) regularly every day. They are to be\r\nmarried in the spring, unless Mrs. Milroy\xe2\x80\x99s death causes the ceremony\r\nto be postponed. The medical men are of opinion that the poor lady is\r\nsinking at last. It may be a question of weeks or a question of months,\r\nthey can say no more. She is greatly altered--quiet and gentle, and\r\nanxiously affectionate with her husband and her child. But in her case\r\nthis happy change is, it seems, a sign of approaching dissolution, from\r\nthe medical point of view. There is a difficulty in making the poor\r\nold, major understand this. He only sees that she has gone back to the\r\nlikeness of her better self when he first married her; and he sits for\r\nhours by her bedside now, and tells her about his wonderful clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Midwinter, of whom you will next expect me to say something, is\r\nimproving rapidly. After causing some anxiety at first to the medical\r\nmen (who declared that he was suffering from a serious nervous shock,\r\nproduced by circumstances about which their patient\xe2\x80\x99s obstinate silence\r\nkept them quite in the dark), he has rallied, as only men of his\r\nsensitive temperament (to quote the doctors again) can rally. He and Mr.\r\nArmadale are together in a quiet lodging. I saw him last week when I was\r\nin London. His face showed signs of wear and tear, very sad to see in so\r\nyoung a man. But he spoke of himself and his future with a courage\r\nand hopefulness which men of twice his years (if he has suffered as I\r\nsuspect him to have suffered) might have envied. If I know anything\r\nof humanity, this is no common man; and we shall hear of him yet in no\r\ncommon way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will wonder how I came to be in London. I went up, with a return\r\nticket (from Saturday to Monday), about that matter in dispute at our\r\nagent\xe2\x80\x99s. We had a tough fight; but, curiously enough, a point occurred\r\nto me just as I got up to go; and I went back to my chair, and settled\r\nthe question in no time. Of course I stayed at Our Hotel in Covent\r\nGarden. William, the waiter, asked after you with the affection of a\r\nfather; and Matilda, the chamber-maid, said you almost persuaded her\r\nthat last time to have the hollow tooth taken out of her lower jaw. I\r\nhad the agent\xe2\x80\x99s second son (the young chap you nicknamed Mustapha, when\r\nhe made that dreadful mess about the Turkish Securities) to dine with me\r\non Sunday. A little incident happened in the evening which may be worth\r\nrecording, as it connected itself with a certain old lady who was not\r\n\xe2\x80\x98at home\xe2\x80\x99 when you and Mr. Armadale blundered on that house in Pimlico\r\nin the bygone time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMustapha was like all the rest of you young men of the present\r\nday--he got restless after dinner. \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to a public amusement, Mr.\r\nPedgift,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. \xe2\x80\x98Public amusement? Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday evening!\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mustapha. \xe2\x80\x98They stop acting on the stage, I grant\r\nyou, on Sunday evening--but they don\xe2\x80\x99t stop acting in the pulpit. Come\r\nand see the last new Sunday performer of our time.\xe2\x80\x99 As he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nany more wine, there was nothing else for it but to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe went to a street at the West End, and found it blocked up with\r\ncarriages. If it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been Sunday night, I should have thought we were\r\ngoing to the opera. \xe2\x80\x98What did I tell you?\xe2\x80\x99 says Mustapha, taking me up\r\nto an open door with a gas star outside and a bill of the performance.\r\nI had just time to notice that I was going to one of a series of \xe2\x80\x98Sunday\r\nEvening Discourses on the Pomps and Vanities of the World, by A Sinner\r\nWho Has Served Them,\xe2\x80\x99 when Mustapha jogged my elbow, and whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Half a crown is the fashionable tip.\xe2\x80\x99 I found myself between two demure\r\nand silent gentlemen, with plates in their hands, uncommonly well filled\r\nalready with the fashionable tip. Mustapha patronized one plate, and I\r\nthe other. We passed through two doors into a long room, crammed with\r\npeople. And there, on a platform at the further end, holding forth to\r\nthe audience, was--not a man, as I had expected--but a Woman, and that\r\nwoman, MOTHER OLDERSHAW! You never listened to anything more eloquent\r\nin your life. As long as I heard her she was never once at a loss for a\r\nword anywhere. I shall think less of oratory as a human accomplishment,\r\nfor the rest of my days, after that Sunday evening. As for the matter\r\nof the sermon, I may describe it as a narrative of Mrs. Oldershaw\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexperience among dilapidated women, profusely illustrated in the pious\r\nand penitential style. You will ask what sort of audience it was.\r\nPrincipally Women, Augustus--and, as I hope to be saved, all the old\r\nharridans of the world of fashion whom Mother Oldershaw had enameled in\r\nher time, sitting boldly in the front places, with their cheeks ruddled\r\nwith paint, in a state of devout enjoyment wonderful to see! I left\r\nMustapha to hear the end of it. And I thought to myself, as I went out,\r\nof what Shakespeare says somewhere, \xe2\x80\x98Lord, what fools we mortals be!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I anything more to tell you before I leave off? Only one thing\r\nthat I can remember.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat wretched old Bashwood has confirmed the fears I told you I had\r\nabout him when he was brought back here from London. There is no kind of\r\ndoubt that he has really lost all the little reason he ever had. He is\r\nperfectly harmless, and perfectly happy. And he would do very well if we\r\ncould only prevent him from going out in his last new suit of clothes,\r\nsmirking and smiling and inviting everybody to his approaching marriage\r\nwith the handsomest woman in England. It ends of course in the boys\r\npelting him, and in his coming here crying to me, covered with mud. The\r\nmoment his clothes are cleaned again he falls back into his favorite\r\ndelusion, and struts about before the church gates, in the character of\r\na bridegroom, waiting for Miss Gwilt. We must get the poor wretch taken\r\ncare of somewhere for the rest of the little time he has to live. Who\r\nwould ever have thought of a man at his age falling in love? And who\r\nwould ever have believed that the mischief that woman\xe2\x80\x99s beauty has done\r\ncould have reached as far in the downward direction as our superannuated\r\nold clerk?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, for the present, my dear boy. If you see a particularly\r\nhandsome snuff-box in Paris, remember--though your father scorns\r\nTestimonials--he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t object to receive a present from his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours affectionately,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA. PEDGIFT, Sen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPOSTSCRIPT.--I think it likely that the account you mention in the\r\nFrench papers, of a fatal quarrel among some foreign sailors in one of\r\nthe Lipari Islands, and of the death of their captain, among others, may\r\nreally have been a quarrel among the scoundrels who robbed Mr. Armadale\r\nand scuttled his yacht. _Those_ fellows, luckily for society, can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nalways keep up appearances; and, in their case, Rogues and Retribution\r\ndo occasionally come into collision with each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MIDWINTER.\r\n\r\nThe spring had advanced to the end of April. It was the eve of Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwedding-day. Midwinter and he had sat talking together at the great\r\nhouse till far into the night--till so far that it had struck twelve\r\nlong since, and the wedding day was already some hours old.\r\n\r\nFor the most part the conversation had turned on the bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s plans\r\nand projects. It was not till the two friends rose to go to rest that\r\nAllan insisted on making Midwinter speak of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have had enough, and more than enough, of _my_ future,\xe2\x80\x9d he began,\r\nin his bluntly straightforward way. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s say something now, Midwinter,\r\nabout yours. You have promised me, I know, that, if you take to\r\nliterature, it shan\xe2\x80\x99t part us, and that, if you go on a sea-voyage, you\r\nwill remember, when you come back, that my house is your home. But this\r\nis the last chance we have of being together in our old way; and I own\r\nI should like to know--\xe2\x80\x9d His voice faltered, and his eyes moistened a\r\nlittle. He left the sentence unfinished.\r\n\r\nMidwinter took his hand and helped him, as he had often helped him to\r\nthe words that he wanted in the by-gone time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would like to know, Allan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall not bring an\r\naching heart with me to your wedding day? If you will let me go back for\r\na moment to the past, I think I can satisfy you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey took their chairs again. Allan saw that Midwinter was moved. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\ndistress yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, kindly--\xe2\x80\x9cwhy go back to the past?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor two reasons, Allan. I ought to have thanked you long since for\r\nthe silence you have observed, for my sake, on a matter that must have\r\nseemed very strange to you. You know what the name is which appears on\r\nthe register of my marriage, and yet you have forborne to speak of it,\r\nfrom the fear of distressing me. Before you enter on your new life, let\r\nus come to a first and last understanding about this. I ask you--as one\r\nmore kindness to me--to accept my assurance (strange as the thing may\r\nseem to you) that I am blameless in this matter; and I entreat you to\r\nbelieve that the reasons I have for leaving it unexplained are reasons\r\nwhich, if Mr. Brock was living, Mr. Brock himself would approve.\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\nthose words he kept the secret of the two names; and left the memory of\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s mother, what he had found it, a sacred memory in the heart of\r\nher son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word more,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on--\xe2\x80\x9ca word which will take us, this time, from\r\npast to future. It has been said, and truly said, that out of Evil may\r\ncome Good. Out of the horror and the misery of that night you know of\r\nhas come the silencing of a doubt which once made my life miserable with\r\ngroundless anxiety about you and about myself. No clouds raised by my\r\nsuperstition will ever come between us again. I can\xe2\x80\x99t honestly tell you\r\nthat I am more willing now than I was when we were in the Isle of Man to\r\ntake what is called the rational view of your Dream. Though I know what\r\nextraordinary coincidences are perpetually happening in the experience\r\nof all of us, still I cannot accept coincidences as explaining the\r\nfulfillment of the Visions which our own eyes have seen. All I can\r\nsincerely say for myself is, what I think it will satisfy you to know,\r\nthat I have learned to view the purpose of the Dream with a new mind. I\r\nonce believed that it was sent to rouse your distrust of the friendless\r\nman whom you had taken as a brother to your heart. I now _know_ that it\r\ncame to you as a timely warning to take him closer still. Does this help\r\nto satisfy you that I, too, am standing hopefully on the brink of a new\r\nlife, and that while we live, brother, your love and mine will never be\r\ndivided again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey shook hands in silence. Allan was the first to recover himself. He\r\nanswered in the few words of kindly assurance which were the best words\r\nthat he could address to his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard all I ever want to hear about the past,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI know what I most wanted to know about the future. Everybody says,\r\nMidwinter, you have a career before you, and I believe that everybody is\r\nright. Who knows what great things may happen before you and I are many\r\nyears older?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho _need_ know?\xe2\x80\x9d said Midwinter, calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cHappen what may, God is\r\nall-merciful, God is all-wise. In those words your dear old friend once\r\nwrote to me. In that faith I can look back without murmuring at the\r\nyears that are past, and can look on without doubting to the years that\r\nare to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose, and walked to the window. While they had been speaking together\r\nthe darkness had passed. The first light of the new day met him as he\r\nlooked out, and rested tenderly on his face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE--My readers will perceive that I have purposely left them, with\r\nreference to the Dream in this story, in the position which they would\r\noccupy in the case of a dream in real life: they are free to interpret\r\nit by the natural or the supernatural theory, as the bent of their own\r\nminds may incline them. Persons disposed to take the rational view may,\r\nunder these circumstances, be interested in hearing of a coincidence\r\nrelating to the present story, which actually happened, and which in\r\nthe matter of \xe2\x80\x9cextravagant improbability\xe2\x80\x9d sets anything of the same kind\r\nthat a novelist could imagine at flat defiance.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1865, that is to say, when thirteen monthly parts of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmadale\xe2\x80\x9d had been published, and, I may add, when more than a year and\r\na half had elapsed since the end of the story, as it now appears, was\r\nfirst sketched in my notebook--a vessel lay in the Huskisson Dock at\r\nLiverpool which was looked after by one man, who slept on board, in the\r\ncapacity of shipkeeper. On a certain day in the week this man was found\r\ndead in the deck-house. On the next day a second man, who had taken his\r\nplace, was carried dying to the Northern Hospital. On the third day a\r\nthird ship-keeper was appointed, and was found dead in the deck-house\r\nwhich had already proved fatal to the other two. _The name of that ship\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cThe Armadale.\xe2\x80\x9d_ And the proceedings at the Inquest proved that the\r\nthree men had been all suffocated _by sleeping in poisoned air_!\r\n\r\nI am indebted for these particulars to the kindness of the reporters at\r\nLiverpool, who sent me their statement of the facts. The case found its\r\nway into most of the newspapers. It was noticed--to give two instances\r\nin which I can cite the dates--in the _Times_ of November 30th, 1865,\r\nand was more fully described in the _Daily News_ of November 28th, in\r\nthe same year.\r\n\r\nBefore taking leave of \xe2\x80\x9cArmadale,\xe2\x80\x9d I may perhaps be allowed to mention,\r\nfor the benefit of any readers who may be curious on such points, that\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cNorfolk Broads\xe2\x80\x9d are here described after personal investigation\r\nof them. In this, as in other cases, I have spared no pains to instruct\r\nmyself on matters of fact. Wherever the story touches on questions\r\nconnected with Law, Medicine, or Chemistry, it has been submitted before\r\npublication to the experience of professional men. The kindness of a\r\nfriend supplied me with a plan of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s apparatus, and I saw the\r\nchemical ingredients at work before I ventured on describing the action\r\nof them in the closing scenes of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Armadale, by Wilkie Collins\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ARMADALE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1895-0.txt or 1895-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/9/1895/\r\n\r\nProduced by James Rusk\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations. Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
